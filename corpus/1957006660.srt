00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,916
so you can propose to Mom, is it?

173
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,083
Kate! Sorry.

174
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,666
Okay, first, you make us spend Christmas
on the freaking equator,

175
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,708
and now you don't even
wanna spend it together?

176
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,708
Okay. Excuse us.

177
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,708
- Come on.
- [Kate huffs]

178
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,500
Why are you acting so rude to Bob?

179
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,875
He's treating us to this incredible trip.
You should try not to forget that.

180
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,000
And you should try not to forget Dad.

181
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,750
["O Christmas Tree" playing]

182
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:28,375
[sighs] Look, just because I care for Bob,

183
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,375
and… and I do.

184
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,041
I… I care about him very much…

185
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,500
That doesn't mean
I love your father any less.

186
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,958
Yeah, well,
I just don't see how that's possible.

187
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,750
[Claire sighs, clicks tongue]

188
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,000
- All right. [scoffs]
- [horn honks]

189
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,333
Look, I'm just gonna tell Bob
we can't go to Tulum.

190
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,708
We'll just… We'll stay here with you guys.

191
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,375
- [passengers chattering]
- Um, no. Um, actually, um, you should go.

192
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,416
But I can't. I'm not…

193
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,666
I'm not gonna just
leave you here like this.

194
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,416
It's okay, Mom.

195
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,208
I was being a brat.
I don't know what came over me.

196
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,375
You and Bob deserve to have some fun.

197
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:09,333
And I know how much you've been dying
to see those Mayan ruins.

198
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,583
[chortles] Really?
You honestly feel that way?

199
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,791
I do.

200
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:18,333
And I promise, you won't have to worry
about me for the rest of the trip.

201
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,708
[tense orchestral music plays]

202
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:22,833
Yeah, hi.

203
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:27,000
I was wondering if you had any more room
on today's flight back to Boston.

204
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,208
Yeah,
I was thinking about ending my trip early.

205
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,583
I can change it at the airport?

206
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,958
- Great. Thanks.
- [cell phone locks]

207
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,125
All right, we'll be back
by late afternoon tomorrow.

208
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,250
I know I was talking a big game
this morning, Dad,

209
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,875
but I'm starting to have
second thoughts about this.

210
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,125
[sighs] You sure you need
to be away for a whole day?

211
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,208
[Bob sighs, clears throat]

212
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,041
[clicks tongue] Uh… Look, man, all right?

213
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,208
I know it's been rough
ever since your mom died.

214
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,166
But we have to keep moving.
We have to keep moving ahead.

215
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,458
[gentle music playing]

216
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:06,541
Plus, I think a little independence
might be good for you.

217
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,041
I just wish we could be independent
in closer proximity.

218
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,125
[chuckles softly, clicks tongue]
You got this. Bring it in.

219
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,083
You got this, all right?

220
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,166
- [Claire] Good?
- Yeah, he's good.

221
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,791
[woman] Everybody going to Tulum,
I need your tickets, please.

222
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,041
Oh, all right. You guys, take care.

223
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,291
- Teddy...
- I know, Mom. No alcohol.

224
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,708
Yes, and I was hoping
you could check in on them, please?

225
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,750
Yeah, I… I got it covered. Okay?

226
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,791
- Okay, uh, love you.
- [Kate] Love you.

227
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,125
- [inhales sharply] All right. Have fun.
- Okay, guys. See you soon.

228
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,583
[Teddy exhales]

229
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,791
You know,
you really don't have to check in on us.

230
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,083
- Yeah, I wasn't planning on it.
- [girl] Teddy!

231
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,708
See you tomorrow.

232
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:55,333
Hey, um, Kate! Where are you going?
Kids Club is this way.

233
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,458
Right. Um, yeah.

234
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,333
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,

235
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,458
but why don't you go ahead
and head over there,

236
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,750
and I'll meet you in a few?

237
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,291
I'll wait for you.

238
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,708
Go to the Kids Club, Jack.
That is a direct babysitter's order.

239
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,541
You're only three years older than me.

240
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,458
But I believe in a chain of command,

241
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,541
so I'll save you a spot
at the slime-making station.

242
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,916
[tense orchestral music playing]

243
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,083
[children chattering and laughing]

244
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,083
[Jack exhales]

245
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,416
Hello.
Are you waiting for the airport shuttle?

246
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,541
Yeah.

247
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,541
Driver just popped a tire,
so I'm taking people over in the meantime.

248
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,333
Okay, cool.

249
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,833
I'm gonna take a little shortcut.
Should get us there in half the time.

250
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,333
- Sounds great.
- [golf cart engine revs]

251

[birds calling]

252
00:12:56,416 --> 00:13:00,041
So, I take it by the early checkout,
your vacation isn't going so well.

253
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,833
Ugh, it's complicated. My mom and...

254
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:03,791
Say no more.

255
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,125
My family was a real drag, too.

256
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,375
Ran away from that nightmare
a couple years ago.

257
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,125
Right around your age.

258
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,291
I just thought it was best for everybody
if I wasn't even here.

259
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,791
They can have their new little family
without me.

260
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:20,708
Kate!

261
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,125
Are you running away?

262
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,291
- You're supposed to be watching me.
- [device beeping]

263
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,208

don't take this personally or anything…

- [wormhole whooshing]
- [suspenseful orchestral music playing]

265

266
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,458
Looks like a wor...

267
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,958
Have a nice trip.

[groans]

275
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,250
I don't think we're in Mexico anymore.

276
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,916
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
there aren't any glaciers

277
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,250

[Jack] This looks like the North Pole!

281

He heard me.

282
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,833
[Jack] I knew
I should've brought my puffy jacket.

283
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,833
We're gonna freeze to death out here.

284
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,625
Don't worry, Jack. It's gonna be okay.

285
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,250
He'll come for us… I hope.

286
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,541

Did we just crash through a kaleidoscope?
There were so many different colors.

397
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,833
Oh, no. That was just us
coming back through the Veil of Borealis.

398
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,500
You see, we live under its shield here.

399

Uh, it keeps us hidden and protected
from the outside world.

400

[chuckles] But tell me,
how in the name of all things sacred

401
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,875
did you end up
in the middle of the North Pole?

402

- Wait, you didn't bring me here?
- No, I didn't bring you here.

Yeah. I feel… really good.

My special recipe.

410
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,958
You're just lucky
I was out there hunting Jola the Yule Cat.

411
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,083
Otherwise, I never would have seen you.

412
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,583
But I thought this was,
like, part of your plan.

413
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,375
You know, to grant my Christmas wish.

414
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:52,791
Um…

- No, not the... [scoffs]

[whispers] …the wish.

418
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,958
Yes. Wow, the other wish. Mm-hmm.

419
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:09,208
Yeah. Well, I figured it was a stretch,
so I took matters into my own hands,

420
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:14,208
and I was on my way to the airport
when our shuttle fell into this wormhole.

421
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,833
Wormhole?

422
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,083

00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,250
- [elf 2 speaking Elvish]
- [elf 3 chuckles, grunts]

514
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,750
[laughs]

515
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,416
[elves chattering]

516
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
- [elf 4] Mm.
- [machinery squeaking]

517
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,208
[elf 4 smacks lips] Mm!

518
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:48,708
[elf 5] Ah.

519
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,000
- [elf 6] Hmm?
- [elf 7] Ah?

520
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,958
[Bjorn munching] Mm-mm!

521
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:58,041
[Jack] Wow. Look at all those candy canes.

522
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:01,291
Enough to stuff billions
of stockings every year.

523
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:02,500
[Jack chuckles softly]

524
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:05,416
- [elf 6] Mm.
- [Bjorn munches]

525
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,625
- [Mrs. Claus] Bjorn!
- [gasps]

526
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,583
{\an8}[in Elvish]

527
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:09,583
[chuckles]

528
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,708
- [belches]
- Ugh!

529
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,041
[elf 8 and elf 9] Bjorn!

530
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,041
[elves chattering]

531
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:21,916
[Santa, in English] Oh, now, Kate,
I think you might recognize this place.

532
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,458
- [Kate] Is that the Hall of Letters?
- [Santa] Uh-huh.

533
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,750
[Jack] Wait a minute.
You've been here before?

534
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,666
[Kate] Well, I've been in there,
but never out here.

535
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,291
[Jack] How come you never told me?

536
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,583
There's a lot of things
I haven't told you, Jack.

537
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,125
- [Jack sighs]
- [Kate chuckles]

538
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:38,416
What is that?

539
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,541
That is the Christmas Star.

540
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,041
[majestic music playing]

541
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,375
[Mrs. Claus]
It powers up the entire village.

542
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:49,083
I devised a way to connect
the light from the Star of Bethlehem

543
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:52,208
to the borealis,
and that's what creates the veil.

544
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:56,750
And Santa is the only one who knows
how to get in and out of the veil safely.

545
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:01,166
Wait. The light inside the star is
from the real Star of Bethlehem?

546
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,833
Tiny sliver of it.

547
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:05,791
Just as bright and powerful
as the day the elves gave it to me

548
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,041
almost 1,700 years ago.

549
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,583
- 1,700 years ago?
- [Santa] Mm-hmm.

550
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,041
You're that old?

551
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:15,833
Mm-hmm. You see, time stands still
here in the North Pole, Jack.

552
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,291
That's why you don't age.

553
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,916
- [blasting]
- What was that?

554
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,666
- [laughs]
- That's the cannons.

555
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,875
- Cannons?
- Yeah, it's okay, Jack.

556
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:24,791
[cannons blast]

557
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,541
[Mrs. Claus] The veil keeps everyone
and everything

558
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:30,208
from getting into the North Pole,
including snow,

559
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:34,208
so the elves have to pipe it in
from the outside. Look.

560
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:37,500
- [elves chattering]
- [majestic music continues playing]

561
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,500
- [Santa chuckles]
- [Jack] Wow.

562
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:47,666
It looks like we're in a giant snow globe.

563
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,583
Yeah.

564
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,333
{\an8}[in Elvish]

565
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,666
- [in English] What?
- Come on, Jack.

566
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,750
[elves laughing and cheering]

567
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,250
Ah, Nick, look at them.
They're having the time of their lives.

568
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,875
- [chuckles] Yes, they are. And so are you.
- [chuckles, sighs]

569
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:25,666
Real children.

570
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,791
[inhales sharply] It's just been so long.

571
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:30,875
[chuckles]

572
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:34,666
- [sighs] I'll be sad to see them leave.
- [Santa] Mm.

573
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,541
[clicks tongue]
Well, we can't send them home

574
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,791
on an empty stomach.

575
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,458
- Certainly not.
- That would be rude.

576
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,708
- Oh, very unthoughtful.
- We can't have that.

577
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:46,416
No. No. Well, then it's decided.

578
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,791
They'll come for dinner,
and then you'll take them back.

579
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,375
Exactly what I was thinking.

580
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:53,416
And I have to prepare.
Oh, I have to prepare.

581
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,541
- Jojo.
- [Jojo] Uh-huh?

582
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,708
- I need corn for popping.
- [Jojo repeats]

583
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,291
Uh, three French hens,

584
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:01,666
a partridge, a pear, and figgy pudding!

585
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,958
- [elf] Ooh, figgy pudding.
- [elves chatter]

586
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,583
- [fire crackling]
- [elf] Ah.

587
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:08,333
- [Santa] All right.
- [elf squeaks, grunts]

588
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,166
[Jojo] Ah. Ooh.

589
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,250
Wow!

590
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,250
- This is dinner?
- Uh-huh.

591
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:17,833
[Santa] Prepared by the North Pole's
executive chef, Mrs. Claus.

592
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:20,291
Well, a little something
I whipped up last minute.

593
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,041
- [both chuckle]
- Okay, let's sit down.

594
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:26,583
- You're over here, Kate. [clears throat]
- [Jack] I don't know, Mrs. Claus.

595
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:27,791
My dad's really strict

596
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:31,208
about me eating my protein and vegetables
before I have dessert.

597
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:34,250
Well, as he should be,
but this isn't dessert.

598
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,250
It's not?

599
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:39,333
No, everything on this table
is super healthy for you.

600
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,750
How is that possible?

601
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:44,041
Well, I've created some new recipes.

602
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,583
Recipes that make all the food you hate

603
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:49,125
look and taste like all the food you love.

604
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:50,458
- [Santa chuckles]
- Wow.

605
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,416
Would you like some broccoli?

606
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,416
[Jack gasps]

607
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,291
[clock chiming]

608
00:29:58,791 --> 00:29:59,833
[Jack exhales]

609
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:03,750
This is the most delicious thing
I've ever tasted!

610
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,500
- All right!
- [Santa laughs]

611
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:08,083
Well, now, don't miss
the lima beans and carrots.

612
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,166
Wow!

613
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:13,541
So…

614
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,708
[chewing] …I've been thinking…

615
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:19,708
About how you got here.

616
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,791
All this business
about coming through a wormhole.

617
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,583
It's true.
It was just like on your sleigh.

618
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:29,583
Only, instead of a sleigh,
it was a golf cart.

619
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,500
[Santa] Hmm.

620
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:31,625
- [Mrs. Claus] Nick?
- Hmm?

621
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:35,708
I have a feeling this has something to do
with Kate being a True Believer.

622
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,208
[Santa] Hmm.

623
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:39,916
Yeah. What if it means
that I'm supposed to live here

624
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,541
with you guys in the North Pole?

625
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:44,958
[spits, coughs] Excuse me?

626
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:48,250
Come on, Santa. I already speak Elvish,
I've been on the big ride,

627
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,875
and I could bring a fresh perspective
to the whole operation.

628
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,833
When did this turn into a job interview?
[chuckles]

629
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:55,916
[Kate] Please, Santa.

630
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,291
Anything would be better than going home
to my mom and her boyfriend.

631
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,333
I'm sitting right here, you know.

632
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:02,583
[Kate sighs]

633
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:05,333
I'm sure your mother loves you very much.

634
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,916
More than you can ever imagine.

635
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,541
I don't know, Mrs. Claus.

636
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:13,500
You should've seen how fast she ditched me
for those stupid Mayan ruins.

637
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,916
[Jack] She's right about that.

638
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,666
And besides, our parents
aren't even gonna get back to the resort

639
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,125
until tomorrow afternoon.

640
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,250
[Santa] Hmm.

641
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,958
Come on, Santa, let us stay.
Even just for a little bit?

642
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:27,333
Hmm. Um… [smacks lips]

643
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:29,125
Mrs. Claus?

644
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:34,041
[takes a deep breath] Well, it would be
so nice having children here…

645
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,541
If only just for one night. [sighs]

646
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,625
[gentle orchestral music playing]

647
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:43,791
- Please, Santa. Let us stay.
- We'll be good. I promise.

648
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,750
- Just for one night. Please?
- [Jack] Come on.

649
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:49,041
Well, I don't…
I don't see the harm in it, but, uh…

650
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:52,583
- Oh, why not? Absolutely.
- [Kate and Jack] Yes!

651
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:54,416
- Thank you, Santa.
- [sighs]

652
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,625
But then first thing in the morning,
it's right back to Cancun, huh?

653
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,375
Mrs. Claus's Village
is the best place on earth!

654
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,458
Oh! [laughs]

655
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:04,250
[chuckles, grunts]

656
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:07,166
[Mina grunting and straining]

657
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:10,333
[Belsnickel] So, Mina,
this is what you get for spying on me.

658
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:15,208
[sighs] Speck,
bring me the rest of my toys.

659
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:17,041
[Speck straining]

660
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:21,375
[grunts, panting]

661
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:28,625
[Belsnickel] Ah. Okay.

662
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,250
You know what to do.

663
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:33,291
- [robot beeps]
- [Belsnickel chuckles softly]

664
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,333
[robot whirring]

665
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:48,375
In a few hours, this entire village
will be nothing but a distant memory.

666
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:52,583
[menacing orchestral music plays]

667
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,291
[Mrs. Claus] Good night, sweet Jack.

668
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,291
- [kisses]
- Good night, Mrs. Claus.

669
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,250
Sleep tight.

670
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:00,083
Oh!

671
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:02,750
Sweetheart, sleep tight. [kisses]

672
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,333
[Kate] Good night, Mrs. Claus.

673
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:09,041
<i>The Christmas Chronicles</i>?

674
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,208
- Jack!
- [gasps]

675
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:17,041
I wouldn't touch those if I were you.
They look pretty rare.

676
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:20,750
- [Mrs. Claus] Yes, they are very rare.
- Oh, they're one of a kind, actually.

677
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:24,500
[chuckles softly, sighs]
Would you like to hear a bedtime story?

678
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:27,000
- Man, that would be awesome!
- That'd be amazing.

679
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,958
- Oh, okay.

- Well, here. Come on, follow me.

681
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,916
Well, have a cozy winter's nap, children.

682
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,125
Good night, Santa.

683
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:41,708
Sweet dreams.

684
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:44,916
- Good night, Santa Claus.
- You know, you can just call him Santa.

685
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,458
[all chuckle]

686
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:49,958
[Mrs. Claus sighs]
All right, now. Here we go.

687
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:51,375
[pages rustle]

688
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:55,083
[Mrs. Claus] So, yeah. Okay.

689
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,708
[sighs] Look closely, children.

690
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:01,416
Very,

691
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,083
very closely.

692
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,875
- [wind blows]
- [Mrs. Claus] This is where it all began.

693
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:09,416
<i>- Back in 312 AD.</i>
- [gentle flute music playing]

694
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,000
[Mrs. Claus] <i>Santa was living</i>
<i>in Asia Minor. Today, it's called Turkey.</i>

[coins jingling]

696
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,458
[Mrs. Claus]
<i>Santa was known as Saint Nicholas.</i>

697
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:18,750
[Santa chuckles]

698
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:22,041
[Mrs. Claus] <i>He was a bishop</i>
<i>who discovered the joy of giving.</i>

- [crickets chirping]
- [Santa grunts]

700
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,375
[Mrs. Claus]
<i>Became something of a local hero.</i>

701
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:32,791
<i>And his legend spread far and wide,
eventually reaching the Forest Elves.</i>

702
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,333
Wait, you mean
there are different kinds of elves?

703
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:41,000
Oh, of course. They're an ancient species
of very magical and wild creatures.

704
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:44,166
For centuries, they were hunted
for their magical powers,

705
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,125
<i>and then they were captured by humans
to the brink of extinction.</i>

706

708
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,750
[sighs, in English] That's awful.

709
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,041
Oh, it was.

710
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,083
[sighs] But in elf lore,

711
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,500
there was a prophecy

712
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:05,041
about a man
who would be king of the elves,

713
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,791
who would, one day, lead them to safety.

714
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,541
[wind whistling]

715
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:13,833
[Mrs. Claus] Their leader, Hakan,
knew that Saint Nicholas was the only one

716
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:16,708
<i>who could channel
the Star of Bethlehem's power.</i>

717
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,208
<i>From that day forward,</i>

718
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:22,125
<i>they no longer referred to him
as Saint Nicholas.</i>

719
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:26,208
<i>- They called him Santa Claus.</i>
- [elves murmuring]

720
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,208
[Mrs. Claus] <i>And he led the elves</i>
<i>on a mystical journey</i>

721
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:33,666

722
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:36,708
[Jack] <i>That's here. That's the North Pole.</i>

723
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,666
[Mrs. Claus chuckles] <i>Yes.</i>

724
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,875
[elves chatter]

725
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,916
Weird. That one elf,

726
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,250
he looks kinda familiar.

727
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:46,708
Yeah.

728
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:47,666
[Mrs. Claus] Hmm.

729
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,208
Belsnickel.

730
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:51,791
[softly] Here.

731
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,875
[chimes jingle]

[book whooshes]

733
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,000
[both chuckle] Whoa!

734
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:00,958
[softly] Okay.

735
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:05,291
Now… [sighs]

736
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:09,125
{\an8}Belsnickel was a precocious
and brilliant elf

737
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,750
who was very popular here in the village.

738
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:14,458
<i>I taught him the art
of magical potion-making,</i>

739
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:17,375
<i>and Santa taught him the art of invention.</i>

740
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:18,916
- [speaking Elvish]
- [Belsnickel] Ooh.

741
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,958
- [electricity pops]
- [Belsnickel groans]

742
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:24,333
- [toy clicks]
- [chuckles, in English] Hey. Okay.

743
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,833
- [piece dings]
- [Santa] Uh-huh.

744
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:27,833
[toy whirring]

745
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:29,166
- [Santa laughs]
- Wow.

746
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,250
[Santa sighs]

747
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,166
Oh.

748
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,166
[Mrs. Claus]
<i>We had so many good times together.</i>

749
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,958
<i>Santa and I grew
to love him very, very much.</i>

750
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:43,166
But, by the time Belsnickel
became a teenager, everything changed.

751
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,291
The spirit of Christmas
had grown around the world.

752
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,500
Santa had less time for Belsnickel,

753
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:53,583
so Belsnickel became resentful
of Santa, and more rebellious.

754
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:57,541
Until, one day, he broke the Elves' Code.

755
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,500
What's the Elves' Code?

756
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:03,541
Ego, lying, viciousness,

757
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:06,000
envy, and selfishness.

758
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:10,041
And if an elf commits
every single one of those transgressions,

759
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,000
they become cursed.

760
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,458
[clicks tongue]
And Belsnickel, well, he broke all five.

761
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:18,125
[wind whistles]

762
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,625

Oh.

[Santa] Ah.

784
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,833
- Belsnickel! What is this?
- [Belsnickel] Ah.

785
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:20,000
I build all the best toys around here.
It's about time I get some of the credit.

788
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:28,875
<i>Belsnickel was stripped
of the joy of being an elf.</i>

789

- [paint sprays]
- Belsnickel!

790
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:31,625
What are you doing?

791
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:34,083
- [Belsnickel grunts]
- [Santa] Why would you do that?

792
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:37,333
Because you care more
about children all over the world

793
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,791
than you care about me.

794
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:44,583

[sighs] Hello, Santa.

927
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,416
Missing something?

928
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,500
You've played a lot of nasty tricks
in your time, Belsnickel,

929
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:01,708
but sending Jola into the stables?

930
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:02,666
[Belsnickel] Big deal.

931
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,125
So, he scared the reindeer,
and they ran off into the forest.

932
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,666
He attacked Dasher!

933
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:11,458
- That wasn't supposed to happen.
- [Santa] Well, it did.

934
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:13,958
- Hey, is that him?
- [Santa] She's very badly wounded.

935
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:17,375
- [Belsnickel sighs]
- So… it <i>was</i> you.

936
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:19,458
Hello, Mrs. Claus.

937
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:22,916
My apologies for any inconvenience.

938
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,708
Inconvenience?

939
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:27,250
Dasher is fighting for her life!

940
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,541
Belsnickel, how could you?

941
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,166
That's Belsnickel…

942
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:34,666
From the story.

943
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,708
- [Santa] Mm-hmm.
- I knew I recognized him.

944
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:40,000
That's the guy who drove the shuttle
back in Cancun.

945
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:41,833
- [Jack] Yeah.
- Yep.

946
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:44,083
And I gotta thank you, Kate,
because, without you,

947
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:46,541
I never could have got
back inside Santa's Village.

948
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:49,250
That's Mrs. Claus's Village to you!

949
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,833
That's… That's not official.

950
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,333
[sighs] Well, folks,
this little family reunion's been sweet,

951
00:45:57,416 --> 00:45:59,625
but it's time for me to leave.

952
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:03,083
Not until that star is back on the tree.

953
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:06,291
Agreed, but not this tree.

954
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,791
This star's for my tree
back at the South Pole.

955
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:12,250
Ooh, it's gonna be the shiz.
I am starting a new village.

956
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:14,791
I can see it now. "Belsnickel's Village."

957
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:17,958
- There's gonna be another village?
- [Belsnickel] You bet there is.

958
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,083
And I'm gonna round up
my own band of elves,

959
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:22,833
and I'm gonna invent my own stuff,
really cool stuff,

960
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:25,958
that will make everybody forget
that the North Pole

961
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,458
and Santa Claus ever existed.

962
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:32,250
[chuckles] Oh, here we go.
Pout, pout, pout!

963
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:33,291
Whatever.

964
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:38,375
I am taking the star to the South Pole
so I can stop aging and buy some time

965
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:41,541
to figure out a way
to break this awful curse.

966
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,875
What's so bad about being human?

967
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,083
Humans suck!

968
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,416
Elves rule.

969
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,208
And I am tired of being a human!

970
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:54,500
Belsnickel, there's only one way
to break the curse,

971
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:57,375
and that's for you
to come back home to the village

972
00:46:57,458 --> 00:46:59,000
and embrace your family.

973
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,916
I know that deep down inside…

974
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:04,125
It's what you want.

975
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:06,208
[gentle orchestral music plays]

976
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:09,708
Bah, humbug!

977
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:12,875
[huffs] You watch your mouth, young elf!

978
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:17,083
- [chimes jingle]
- Hi. Thank you.

979
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,500

[star whooshes]

981
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:26,083
[exhales]
How do you like my new gravity glove?

982
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,500
[chuckles] Not bad, kid.

983
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,291
- But it's no match for real magic.
- [chimes jingle]

984
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:35,458
- [glove whirs]
- Give it up, Bels.

985
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:36,541
[Belsnickel] Not a chance.

986
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:39,083
The only thing you ever cared about
was your stupid holiday.

987
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:40,375
That stupid holiday

988
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:43,375
makes billions of people
feel love and happiness.

989
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:45,375
Well, I'm about to change all of that.

990
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:46,916
Change, ha!

991
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,916
You couldn't handle
any of the little changes

992
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,458
that were going on around here,
so you ran away.

993
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:55,625
Because you spend every hour of every year
getting ready for one lousy day.

994
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:58,833
A day that brings joy
to children all over the world,

995
00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:01,541
and that will never change.

996
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:03,958

997
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,500

- Oh!

998
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:10,541
Belsnickel, stop!

[glove whirring]

1000
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:12,750
[Mrs. Claus] Nick!

00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:39,291
[Belsnickel breathing shakily]

1012
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,125
This is… [gasps]

1013
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,000
This is bad.

1014
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:00,291
Without the star,

1015
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:04,166
the North Pole, the village,
Christmas itself is doomed!

1016
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:06,416
Like, for this year?

1017
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,333
Like, forever.

1018
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:11,125
You're right. This is bad.

1019
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,916
But we can't let that happen.

1020
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,500
Christmas must endure.

1021
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,708
[grunts] To the stables.

1022
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,791

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,666
[in English] Why don't they recognize you?

1200
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,958
Oh, they're just kids.

1201
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:10,958
Look at 'em.

1202
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:14,916
Can't be more than... What?
Two, three hundred years old?

1203
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,875
They've never seen me. [chuckles]

1204
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:19,625
I haven't been back here in,

1205

oh, I don't know,
maybe 500 years. [chuckles]

Five hundred and twenty-two,

Hakan. [clicks tongue]

1208

You look well and wise.

You as well, Nicholas.

1210

Your Elvish is impressive.

So is your English.

1214
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:45,125
Thank you.

1215
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:48,958
So, what brings you both here?

1216
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:53,666
- Belsnickel.
- Oh. What's he done now?

1217
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:56,375
Destroyed the Christmas Star.

Well, we can build a new container.

1221

But only you, Nicholas,

1222
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:11,916
can harness the power
of the Star of Bethlehem.

1223
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:16,250
And as you know,
the ritual is very dangerous.

1224
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,625
[Santa] We have no other choice.

1225
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:20,458

1237
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,833
I'm gonna go with the gingerbread man.

Oh, don't get me wrong.

1521
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:35,666
I love drinking hot cocoa by the fire,
ice skating, all that good stuff.

1522
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:39,833
But my grandparents live in Florida,
and they're too old to travel.

1523
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:44,833
And who knows how many more Christmases
I'm gonna spend with them, you know?

1524
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,500
That's really sweet of you.

1525
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,125
It's like my mom always says,

1526
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:54,708
"Christmas isn't about where you are
but who you're with."

1527
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:01,416
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. It's just…

1528
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:03,916
[scoffs] I'm such a bad person.

1529
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:09,708
Hey, it's okay.
You couldn't have done anything that bad.

1530
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:13,833
Oh, I ran away and probably broke up
my mom's engagement.

1531
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:17,250
Okay, that's bad. [chuckles slightly]

1532
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,583
But this guy your mom's with,
he must be pretty horrible.

1533
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:26,541
No, Bob's a really great guy.
And he makes her so happy.

1534
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:31,458
Okay. So now I'm really confused.

1535
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:38,041
It's just, it's only been
a couple years since my… my dad…

1536
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:44,291
And, well, if my mom marries Bob,
then it means…

1537
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,625
Your dad is really gone.

1538
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,166
Yeah. Even though he's not here anymore,

1539
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:54,666
it still feels like he's with us,
you know?

1540
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:58,833
And… I just really wanted
to say goodbye to him.

1541
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,958
And I guess I felt so sad about it,

1542
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:04,583
I wanted everyone else
to feel the same way I did.

1543
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,000
But the truth is, now,

1544
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:11,291
I'd do anything
to spend Christmas with them.

1545
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:14,125
Mom, Teddy, and, yeah, even Bob.

1546
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:20,750
Well, we'll just have to make that happen,
won't we?

1547
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,125
- [chuckles]
- [Kate chuckles softly]

1548
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:26,625

Oh, yeah, Santa.
I want you to meet someone.

This is… I didn't get your name.

1600
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:41,375
It's Doug.

1601
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:43,000
- Pierce.

That's right. [chuckles]

Wait. Your name is Doug Pierce?

1605
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:53,666
That's me, but how did you know my…

1606
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,500
[Santa exhales, clears throat]

1607
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:58,416
- Is he really Santa?
- Just... Wait. Okay.

1608
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,125
You're Doug Pierce.

1609
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:02,416
Are you from Lowell, Massachusetts?

1610
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:06,708
Yeah, but I never told you
where I was from.

1611
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:10,166
- ["O Christmas Tree" playing]
- So, you're my…

1612
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,166
You're my…

1613
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:16,083
Santa, is he my… my…?

1614
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:20,500
I hate to cut this short, kids,
but we need to get going, Kate.

1615
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,625
[takes a deep breath] Time to say goodbye.

1616
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:32,750
[sighs] Goodbye, Dad.

1617
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:36,375
Excuse me?

1618
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,958
I mean, Doug.

1619
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:49,125
Think you need
to let Doug up for some air, Katie Cat.

1620
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:57,375
Thank you for everything.

1621
01:19:58,416 --> 01:20:01,125
Yeah, well,
a Pierce always sees it through.

1622
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:03,250
[chuckles softly] Yes, we do.

01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:12,541
Kate!

1625
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:16,625
Merry Christmas, Doug.

1626
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:19,708
[Doug] Merry Christmas, Kate.

1627
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:23,791
[sighs] And Merry Christmas, Santa!

1628
01:20:25,416 --> 01:20:27,458
[exhales] Note to self.

1629
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:31,791
From now on, always bring
a video camera wherever you go.

[Mrs. Claus] Now…

1631
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:39,333
There's only one way
to administer this to every elf.

1632
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:40,291
The cannons.

1633
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:43,000
Exactly. Think you can do it?

1634
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:45,041
I got this, Mrs. C.

1635
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:48,791
Oh, Jack, I can't send you out there
alone without protection.

1636
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:50,083
More cookies?

1637
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:55,125
No cookies are gonna stop
thousands of maniacal elves.

1638
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:56,666
Okay? So, follow me.

01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:20,833
All right, ladies.
This is our last chance to get back.

1646
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:23,750
But, Santa, when we do get back,

1647
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:25,583
how're we gonna get the star
from Belsnickel?

1648
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:28,208
I mean, he's probably already
at the South Pole.

1649
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:33,083
Well, that's a very good point.
Unless, of course, we set this little baby

1650
01:21:33,166 --> 01:21:36,875

He's still in there.
You just need to believe it.

1863
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:49,166
[sighs, voice breaking]
We had some good times.

1864
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:54,166
But I'll never be that elf again.

1865
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:55,583
Of course you will.

1866
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:58,416
[scoffs] Easy for you to say.

1867
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:02,375
You don't know what this feels like.

1868
01:33:02,458 --> 01:33:05,000
Belsnickel, you don't need to be an elf

1869
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:09,291
to realize that running away
doesn't solve all your problems.

1870
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:12,708
And sometimes,

1871
01:33:12,791 --> 01:33:15,625
we need to listen
to the ones that we love the most.

1872
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,708
Because at the end of the day,

1873
01:33:20,416 --> 01:33:23,000
your family are the only ones
in the whole world

1874
01:33:23,083 --> 01:33:24,500
who really understand you.

1875
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:29,916
They're the only ones that will always
be there for you, no matter what.

1876
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:33,666
Someone really cool once told me

1877
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:37,583
that Christmas isn't about where you are
but who you're with.

1878
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:44,166
We love you, Belsnickel.

1879
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:45,958
Always have, Bels.

1880
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:53,041

are you sure you're ready for this trip?

[Dasher grunts]

1896

1897
01:34:50,208 --> 01:34:52,875
All right. Last sleigh to Cancun.

1898
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:55,375
- All aboard.
- [Jack gasps] Oh, my God.

1899
01:34:55,458 --> 01:34:58,750
This is probably gonna be
my first and only trip in the sleigh.

1900
01:34:58,833 --> 01:35:01,958
- Can I sit up front, Santa?
- Well, you can't drive from the back.

1901
01:35:02,041 --> 01:35:03,458
- What?
- [laughs] Yeah.

1902
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:06,750
Now, this puppy's got some serious jump.
You think you can handle it?

1903
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:09,708
- Well, yeah!
- All right. Jump in and get the reins.

1904
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:11,750
There you go. [grunts]

1905
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:15,000
- Hey, Santa?
- [Santa exhales]

1906
01:35:16,208 --> 01:35:18,208
I just wanted to say thank you.

1907
01:35:19,333 --> 01:35:20,208
For what?

1908
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:22,916
For letting me say goodbye to my dad.

1909
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:27,250
Now, Kate, that was purely coincidental.

1910
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:29,666
[chuckles] Yeah, right.

1911
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:32,708
Jump in. [chuckles]

1912
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:34,416
Children! Children!

1913
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:38,958
[panting] In case
you get a little peckish on the ride.

1914
01:35:39,458 --> 01:35:40,458
What's in these?

1915
01:35:40,541 --> 01:35:44,666
Um, eggs, butter, flour, sugar.

1916
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,625
No. What kinda magic is in them?

1917
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:50,791
I mean, when I ate one in the forest,
I lost all my fears.

1918
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:53,208
The snowman cookie made me feel stronger.

1919
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:59,083
Well, only the gingerbread man
had magic ingredients.

1920
01:35:59,791 --> 01:36:01,375
The snowman didn't have any.

1921
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:04,833
But wait.

1922
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:07,666
So, that means…

1923
01:36:08,375 --> 01:36:11,166
The hero was always inside you.

1924
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:16,416
[sighs] I'll never forget you, Mrs. Claus.

1925
01:36:17,916 --> 01:36:23,458
Oh… you will from time to time,
and that's as it should be.

[Jack sighs]

1927
01:36:27,166 --> 01:36:29,916
[sighs] Have a great journey.

1928
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:33,958
- [both] Merry Christmas, Mrs. Claus.
- Merry Christmas.

1929
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:36,250
- [grunts] Hey, guys.
- [Kate] Yeah?

1930
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:37,416
One last thing.

1931
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:41,083
- [Jack] What's that?
- Stay away from strangers in golf carts.

1932
01:36:41,166 --> 01:36:43,291
- [all laugh]
- Will do.

On, Prancer! On, Vixen!

That's it. That's it.
Now, pull 'em back! Pull 'em!

- Harder!

- [shouts in Elvish]
- [laughing] Not bad. Not bad at all, Jack!

1945

All right, kids. We're here.

1946
01:37:24,541 --> 01:37:25,458
Ready to jump?

1947
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:26,458
Jump?

1948
01:37:28,666 --> 01:37:30,458
All the way down there?

1949
01:37:30,541 --> 01:37:33,250
- [Santa] Mm-hmm.
- Trust me, Jack. You'll be fine.

1950
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:36,250
I don't know, Kate.
I fought a village of crazy elves,

1951
01:37:36,333 --> 01:37:38,750
but this seems kinda dangerous,
if you ask me.

1952
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:41,208
You'll be okay. I promise.

1953

1954
01:37:44,041 --> 01:37:45,041
Yeah?

1955
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:46,916
Will we ever see you again?

1956
01:37:48,125 --> 01:37:49,583
Not if he can help it.

1957
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:53,916
We did it again.

1958
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:56,500
Yes, we did.

1959
01:37:57,833 --> 01:37:58,791
Uh…

1960
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,000
Just one thing, Katie Cat.

1961
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:05,666

Well, let me put it this way.

1975
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,250
I met Mrs. Claus,

1976
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:59,666
and I helped save Christmas
with Dad when he was 13.

1977
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:01,833
Are… Are you serio... No way.

1978
01:39:01,916 --> 01:39:03,625
- Yes way.
- [chuckles]

1979
01:39:03,708 --> 01:39:06,875
Yeah, well, I climbed a glacier
and fought off a Yule cat,

1980
01:39:06,958 --> 01:39:09,875
so I'm kind of a big deal
at the North Pole now.

1981
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:11,250
- Is that right?
- [Jack] Yeah.

1982
01:39:11,333 --> 01:39:13,916
Me and Mrs. Claus are like this.

1983
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,583
Wow. You guys gotta tell me everything,

1984
01:39:16,666 --> 01:39:20,000

waiting for us, so we gotta go.

01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:24,208
When I last saw you,
you were heading to Kids Club.

1987
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,083
How'd you get
from there onto Santa's sleigh?

1988
01:39:26,166 --> 01:39:28,541
You know, that was a life-changing trip.

1989
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:29,833
- It was.
- [Bob] Mm.

- Come on! What?

- I'm so happy to see you, honey!
- [Bob] That's my main man!

- Ah, I missed you so much!
- Yeah!

I really care for your mother.

01:40:01,125 --> 01:40:03,375
And I hope
that me and you can continue to bond.

2004

You know, guys, I was thinking,
maybe tonight…

2007
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,458
Maybe we should have a caroling party.

2008

- [softly] Wow!
- Seriously?

2009

Sure.
