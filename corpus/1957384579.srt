What? Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

Fuck.

00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:57,672
Shit.

00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:16,690
Oh.

00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh.

Woman: Hey, babe.
What's taking so long?

17
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:40,628
What's going on?
Where are you?

18
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:42,325
Are you... Are you safe?

19
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:47,025
Hmm, yes, I'm safe.
I'm at home.

20
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,418
Where are you?

21
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:51,682
I'm at home.
I'm... just...

22
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:53,945
Just come up to the bedroom
and let me out.

23
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:57,645
I don't know what the fuck
is happening.

24
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,777
Wait. What?
Wait. You're...

25
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:01,866
when did you get home?

26
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,869
I... I have no idea.

27
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:06,871
You're in the bedroom?
Just come...

28
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:08,355
can you just come
downstairs, please?

29
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:10,048
I... I...
I can't. I'm...

30
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,050
I'm locked up.

31
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:14,096
The door is locked?
No!

32
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,838
No, I'm literally chained up.

33
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:19,536
I'm... I'm locked up
with chains.

34
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,364
Just... Just come up
and let me out.

35
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,888
Please. Please.

36
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,368
Okay.
I'm coming.

37
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,501
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.

38
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:31,896
So...

39
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,550
where are you?

40
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:36,336
I'm in the bedroom.

41
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,121
I'm in the bedroom.

42
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:42,254
No, you're not.

43
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,778
What are you doing right now?

44
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:46,084
Honestly you had me
scared for a second.

45
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,367
Look, is this because the store
didn't have any toilet paper?

46
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,524
Because you know
you can just tell me.

47
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,395
I swear everything
I'm telling you is true!

48
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,049
I... I... Stop playing games.

49
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:55,964
I was out for toilet paper. Exhausting.

50
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,400
I got the toilet paper.

51
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:58,749
You sound like a crazy person.

52
00:05:58,793 --> 00:05:59,750
And now I'm...

53
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:01,578
I'm chained to the bed!

54
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:04,364
I... I think it's our bedroom.

55
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:07,845
It looks like our bedroom.
I guess I don't know.

56
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,934
I'm fucked.
I'm fucked right now.

57
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:11,762
I'm... I'm in trouble.

58
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,201
So you're not playing games?

59
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:19,117
No! I need help.

60
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,299
Okay. Um...
Well...

61
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:29,301
Did you call the police?

62
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:32,043
No! No.
I-I... I called you first.

63
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,087
I was worried.

64
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,355
Holy shit. Someone's coming.

65
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,052
Oh, shit.
Babe?

66
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:43,664
Wait what's happening?
Babe, what's happening?

67
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:48,712
Um... Babe...
I-I... I love you.

68
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:04,511
Zookeeper, please put
on your protective gear.

69
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,513
Listen.
I have money. I can...

70
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:08,515
Put on your protective gear.

71
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:24,835
Come on, Zookeeper, put it on.

72
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,666
Like I said.
I...

73
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,452
I have money.
I ca... I can pay!

74
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,192
Okay! Uhh...

75
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:37,805
I-I don't know what's going on.

76
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:41,199
There's a virus, Zookeeper.

77
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,724
What?
That's what's going on.

78
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,856
There's a virus.
Yeah.

79
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,641
Yeah, I know that.

80
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:49,207
Why do you keep calling me
Zookeeper?

81
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:50,600
Swab?

82
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:52,602
What?

83
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:54,386
Swab.

84
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:08,052
Okay! Okay.
Look.

85
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:10,794
I know you don't think
you have it,

86
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:12,317
but we need to be sure.

87
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,015
Incubation periods,

88
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:16,060
asymptomatic carriers,

89
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:17,714
liars?

90
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,413
I guess I can just take it
anally.

91
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,250
There we go.

92
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,039
What are you doing with me?

93
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:42,565
I'm keeping you safe.

94
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:46,003
For now.

95
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:48,702
You're at home.

96
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:50,225
There's a safer at home order.

97
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,749
This isn't my home.

98
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:55,578
My blanket is red, not purple.

99
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,756
Now you listen to me.

100
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,238
You... here...
in your pajamas,

101
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:04,587
abducting me,

102
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,154
trying to intimidate me.

103
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:09,287
You tell me what's happening
right this second

104
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,725
and let me go!
Let me out of these chains,

105
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:14,554
you coward!
You gutless, spineless...

106
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,819
Welcome to my personal hell,
Zookeeper!

107
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:20,081
How about this, fucker?

108
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:21,212
Huh, how about this?

109
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,084
Tell me your crimes!

110
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:26,174
Confess your crimes! What crimes?

111
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,045
I didn't do anything! Confess, Zookeeper!

112
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:31,048
Confess! Confess!
Confess! Confess!

113
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,833
Why do you keep
calling me Zookeeper?

114
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:35,575
I'm not a zookeeper!

115
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,707
You have the wrong person.

116
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:40,754
I swear you have
the wrong person.

117
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,063
You're not a zookeeper?

118
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,329
Well, I mean, I wasa zookeeper.

119
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,288
Ahh!
But that was back

120
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:54,637
when I lived in Cincinnati!

121
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:57,422
I'm not the guy
you're looking for!

122
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,772
Oh, we shall see, Zookeeper.

123
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,948
We shall see.
Yeah.

124
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,646
But see right now,
you're in my playground.

125
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,693
And you'll see that your time
here is much more pleasant

126
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,042
if you just follow the rules.

127
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:10,435
And they're
very reasonable rules.

128
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,828
I'm a good guy.

129
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:15,702
All I want from you
is a confession.

130
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:18,095
You confess.

131
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,401
I'm the Zookeeper.

132
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:21,011
What are you?

133
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:25,973
I'm an economist.

134
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,198
Okay.

135
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:36,374
Fine.
You know, I'll just...

136
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:37,700
have to get the confession
from you later.

137
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:40,378
But do not...
Do not betray my trust,

138
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,816
Zookeeper.
I promise.

139
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:45,209
I will not betray your trust.

140
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,472
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

141
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:48,648
Thank you.
But...

142
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,562
but can that go two ways?

143
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:53,696
What do you mean?

144
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,394
I need a sign of good faith.

145
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,788
A sign of good faith?

146
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:00,660
You want a sign of
good faith? Okay.

147
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,618
Okay, I'll give you a sign
of good faith.

148
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,359
I'll give you a fucking sign
of good faith!

149
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:15,936
A... A real sign of good faith.

150
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:20,070
A banana...

151
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:21,681
is a real sign of good faith.

152
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,597
Can't you loosen these chains?

153
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:28,513
You know, Let me sit down
somewhere a little more comf...

154
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,646
Or... or lie down?

155
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,866
Well I-I guess you did give me
the swab sample

156
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,737
and I did not
have to take anally.

157
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,086
Yeah.

158
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,740
Thank you.

159
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,309
Okay.

160
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:42,939
Come downstairs when
you're ready to confess.

161
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,138
Wait. Wait!

162
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:45,487
Aren't... Aren't you gonna...

163
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,488
Aren't you gonna loosen
the chains?

164
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:47,663
They're off.

165
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:08,075
Okay. 9-1-1.

166
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:12,949
Operator: We're sorry.

167
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:14,884
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

168
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:15,908
or is no longer in...

00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:22,176
Operator: We're sorry.

170
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:24,526
You have reached a number

or is no longer in service.

172
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:47,854
Ahh.

173
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,335
Jesus Christ.

174
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,907
What the fuck.

175
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:21,121

Ahh!
Confession time?

183
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:09,952
Oh.
Lunch is keeping warm

184
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,649
in the oven if you want some.

185
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,103
Hey, come here.
Take a look at this meme.

186
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,866
I've been developing it
for some time now

187
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,457
and I really think
it's gonna change

188
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,502
the course of the war... Hey!

189
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,203
We are still testing
your sample.

190
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,817
Is that a children's
chemistry set?

191
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:56,520
Just...

192
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:58,696
take a look at... take...
Look... look at this meme.

193
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,308
Okay?

194
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:06,269
Now.

195
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:10,186
What I've discovered is that
you can take any quote

196
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,101
and it becomes ten times funnier

197
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,886
if you say that it was spoken
the day before 9/11.

198
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:35,298
9/11 jokes aren't funny.

199
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:37,387
That's serious stuff.

200
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,999
Says the guy hugging toilet
paper like it's his teddy bear.

201
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:43,567
I need this.

202
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:44,980
I need this a lot more
than you need

203
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,310
to be making memes right now.

204
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,312
It's my job.

205
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:50,748
I'm a professional.

206
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,291
I thought you said
you were an economist.

207
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,447
I'm a meme economist.

208
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,796
That's not a thing.

209
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,233
Then what the fuck
am I doing right now?!

210
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:03,022
Fuck.

211
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:08,069
Alright just...

212
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,420
come here and just take a look
at this meme, huh?

213
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,167
I used to work for the
Ministry of Propaganda

214
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:22,824
before I got fired
by the Overlords.

215
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:24,391
Propaganda?

216
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,784
Memes are just propaganda.
You know?

217
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:28,917
Information or misinformation,

218
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,876
or a diversion, you know,
hidden in a joke or a picture.

219
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,835
Whatever.

220
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:36,098
But I think this is
my best meme yet.

221
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:38,753
Once this hits the masses?

222
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:42,235
Imagine all those
people on the Internet.

223
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:43,584
All finding quotes.

224
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:47,675
Helping the war effort?

225
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,372
It's absolutely beautiful.

226
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:56,205
Are you making those memes
in Microsoft Paint?

227
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:14,745
You know, you're being
rather judgmental, Zookeeper.

228
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:19,315
Sure you don't have anything
you wanna confess now?

229
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,580
I confess that memes are stupid.

230
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:30,500
Memes are civilization's
foremost method

231
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,154
of communication.

232
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:33,982
He who disregards the memes

233
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:35,549
disregards life itself.

234
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:36,898
Are you fucking kidding?

235
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,161
You know what?

236
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,467
I think you should make a meme.

237
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,555
No.
Yeah!

238
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,122
Come on.
What do you say?

239
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,100
Tell me what your favorite quote
is and we'll pretend

240
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,995
that it inspired 9/11.
Huh?

241
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:48,953
I'm not doing this. Come on, make a meme.

242
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:50,259
No, this is ridiculous.

243
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:51,521
Come on make a meme!

244
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:52,783
What are you saying?
You know.

245
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,872
Look. Hey.
You say you want answers?

246
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,372
You know, you wanna know
what you're doing here?

247
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:58,398
Do me a favor.
Make a meme.

248
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:00,027
Make a meme, make a meme,
make a meme, meme, meme.

249
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,290
Make a meme, make a meme,
make a meme, meme, meme.

250
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:04,230
Make a meme-I swore an oath, okay?

251
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:07,407
I have a bad history
with them and I swore

252
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,148
I would never make memes.

253
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,367
Ever.

254
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:13,543
Well...

255
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,719
that is a silly thing...

256
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,330
to make an oath for.

257
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:24,728
Well I did.

258
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:28,167
Are you sure...
there isn't something

259
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,733
that you wanna confess?

260
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,657
Okay.

261
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:44,095
Come on.

262
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:45,358
Let's, uh...

263
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:46,968
Let's look outside.

264
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,822
Look outside.
What do you see?

265
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:19,130
People? No.
Why? Because everyone's at home.

266
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:21,350
No one's going anywhere
and no one's doing anything.

267
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:23,222
Couples should be walking by,
holding hands,

268
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,267
and then waving to us
as if to say,

269
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,835
"Hey, everything's okay,"
but everything's not okay.

270
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:30,229
Everything's fucked.

271
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,143
Murder hornets.
Carole Baskin.

272
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:33,686
When did everything start
getting fucked, huh?

273
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,016
Doesn't that seem
strange to you?

274
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:38,193
Everything being fucked up
all the time?

275
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,370
The world's gonna end.
The world's gonna end.

276
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,766
You realize that, right?

277
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,160
Everything?
Destroyed?

278
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:52,599
And it's all happening
for a reason.

279
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:53,817
Hey. Hey!

280
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,471
Are you listening to me?

281
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:57,560
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm listening.

282
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,606
I just...
I don't see what...

283
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:01,869
memes have to do
with the end of the world.

284
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:10,921
Go. Move!
No!

285
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:28,330
I don't think
you fucking understand.

286
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,940
This is it.
It's fucking over.

287
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,900
Everything you know and love
is gonna fucking die!

288
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:34,205
And this battlefield?

289
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:35,661
It's not a real battlefield
some place

290
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:39,036
with, like, grass and water
and sand and shit.

291
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,647
The battlefield is here.

292
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:47,654
We are in the midst
of the great meme war.

293
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,699
Memes from all around the world.

294
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,310
All around the galaxy...
the universe...

295
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:54,356
from every culture and era,

296
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,403
all clashing right now
in one final battle for mankind.

297
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:06,063
Let me try and take you
through it, okay?

298
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:07,650
You don't give a shit
about the Internet.

299
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:08,936
That's fucking fine.

300
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:10,435
I don't care.
Go fuck yourself, alright?

301
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:12,263
But you know who thinks
it's the greatest shit ever?

302
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:15,159
Yeah? India.
Pakistan.

303
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,509
The Planet of Galgalon Prime.

304
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:17,921
Any fucking shitty
third world country

305
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:19,575
that just got an Internet
connection, alright?

306
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,919
And they're being ushered into
the world of memes, alright?

307
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:24,778
Without any context
of how to understand it.

308
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:26,321
We live in the era
of the post-ironic meme.

309
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,911
Alright?

310
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:29,715
First there was the classic era,
then there was the ironic era,

311
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,262
and now there's
the post-ironic era.

312
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:33,395
Okay? Where memes don't make
any fucking sense.

313
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,503
Okay. You know.
It doesn't matter

314
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:35,919
if they're funny or reverent.

315
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:37,201
It doesn't fucking matter.
Okay?

316
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:39,140
As long as it exists
it's a fucking meme.

317
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:40,813
But those third world fuckers?
Who are, like,

318
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:42,926
logging onto the Internet
for the first fucking time?

319
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,319
Those fucks? Yeah!

320
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,888
See, our post-ironic era
is their classic era.

321
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:50,412
You know? And they have
no context to understand

322
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,414
where the memes
first developed from.

323
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,898
So they're just fucking
making memes.

324
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:55,437
Just going along.
Copying whatever they see.

325
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:56,916
And they're not making
any fucking sense.

326
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,289
And here the weird thing,
alright?

327
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,117
Because memes never made
any fucking sense

328
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:03,773
in the first fucking place!

329
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:06,689
So how to you tell
the good memes

330
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:10,127
from the shitty
third world memes?

331
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:11,564
You fucking can't!

332
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,043
You can't tell the difference.

333
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:14,673
No one can! Alright?
No one knows what's happening

334
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:16,351
or which fucking side
they're on.

335
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,634
Do you have any idea how many
fucking people live in India?

336
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:21,617
You have any idea?
1.3 billion fucking people!

337
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:24,794
1.3 billion. If each one of them
makes 10 memes every day

338
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,405
for an entire year,
you end up with

339
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:29,190
4.75 trillion fucking memes!

340
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,713
Trillion with a fucking T!

341
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:32,082
How the fuck do you compete
with that?

342
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:33,977
How do you fucking compete?
You can't!

343
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:36,676
You can't compete
with fucking India! Fuck!

344
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:39,853
Those little fucking Bangladesh
little fucking bitches!

345
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:42,333
Those fucking bitches!

346
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:44,292
God damn it!

347
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:49,950
You won't confess
for your crimes.

348
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:51,821
You won't make
a fucking meme with me?

349
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:55,651
If you got drafted
into the great meme war

350
00:23:55,695 --> 00:24:00,221
you would have to make
42.2 memes every fucking day

351
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:04,660
just for us to maintain
production with fucking India.

352
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:06,967
Oh, my god.

353
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,492
Oh, my god.
Fuck India.

354
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:13,364
Fuck you!

355
00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:15,366
Fuck you and fucking India!

356
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:29,206
Okay.

357
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,209
If I make a meme...

358
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:35,430
will you promise to tell me what
the fuck you're talking about?

359
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,258
You'll explain everything?

360
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,228
"Be the change you wish
to see in the world." Gandhi.

361
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:57,321
September 10th, 2001.

362
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,565
Okay.

363
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:27,395
Why am I in a place
that looks like my house?

364
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:29,528
But I know it's not.

365
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:34,271
And why is time and reality
bending in front of my eyes?

366
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:40,495
Wrong question.

367
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,541
And what would
the right question be?

368
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:49,460
Well.

369
00:25:49,504 --> 00:25:51,700
You said you wanted to get to
the bottom of everything, right?

370
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:53,682
You wanna understand everything?

371
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:57,077
Why don't you let me ask you
some questions, huh?

372
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,601
Where did it all start?

373
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:01,168
All what?

374
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:02,561
What do you mean, all what?

375
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:10,569
Oh.
A wet market in Wuhan.

376
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:13,484
No.

377
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:16,487
I guess, well, you know,
nobody can be certain.

378
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:17,706
What do you think?

379
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,317
A bio-lab in Wuhan?

380
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:23,669
No.

381
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:25,864
You think this was the
Chinese government or something?

382
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:28,325
That they released this
on purpose?

383
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:30,153
Nope.
American government?

384
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,590
Come on, Zookeeper.
Alright?

385
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,089
You're thinking too
short-sighted, you know?

386
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:34,723
I need you to think bigger.
You know?

387
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:35,831
Where do you think it all began?

388
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:37,378
Come on.
All of it.

389
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:44,994
It was a...
A wet market in Wuhan.

390
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,127
Unsanitary conditions.

391
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,651
You know, bats and dogs
and pangolins

392
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,522
all shitting
on each other and...

393
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:53,350
And getting cooked
in the street.

394
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:56,658
No! No!
Before that, Zookeeper!

395
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,921
Before that! Look.
Okay.

396
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:00,531
Okay, look.
Here's the thing.

397
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:03,447
I need you to think about
the thing that happened

398
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:06,537
that everybody
was talking about. Okay?

399
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:08,452
The crisis that took
the world by storm.

400
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:10,629
Before the virus.

401
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:17,331
Um...
I don't know.

402
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:19,463
Australian wildfires?

403
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:21,422
Ahhh.

404
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:24,904
See, you do remember.

405
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:27,210
The wildfires
didn't cause coronavirus.

406
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:29,038
I didn't say that
they caused it.

407
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:30,605
No. But...

408
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,087
before the wildfires. Right?
What happened before that?

409
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,523
I...
I don't remember.

410
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:37,177
Yeah, you do.
Come on.

411
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,179
What was the thing?
What was the crisis?

412
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:42,051
Uhhh...

413
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:43,792
Oh! Uh, World War III.

414
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:45,489
We were gonna go to war
with Iran.

415
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,404
Yeah! See. That's it.
Keep going. Think bigger.

416
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:50,233
Ukraine? Impeachment? Keep going.

417
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:51,515
You're saying these things
are connected?

418
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,629
Come on! Keep going.
Keep going.

419
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,980
Before that?

420
00:27:58,024 --> 00:27:59,547
Cats.
Yes.

421
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,244
The Hong Kong protests.

422
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:02,855
School shootings.
Yeah.

423
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:04,726
Jeffrey Epstein killed himself.

424
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,727
No, he didn't.

425
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:06,989
Right.
Of course.

426
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,730
Alright, keep going.
Before that.

427
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:14,170
Trump's election?

428
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:17,260
I mean, sure. That was
part of it. Yeah.

429
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:20,437
Before that, uh...
I don't know.

430
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:22,744
I mean, things got pretty weird
sometimes.

431
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:25,791
But ever since then, that's when
the crazy shit

432
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,662
really started picking up.

433
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:31,927
You're saying that's where
this started?

434
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,276
You're not making sense.

435
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,626
You said you would make sense.

436
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,193
It's all Trump's fault?

437
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:42,938
There was one more thing
before Trump.

438
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:45,767
You really think memes
have no relevance?

439
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:50,293
Think that a meme economist
can't have any insight?

440
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:04,830
It was the most important meme
of them all.

441
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:08,659
The meme that ushered the world
into the post-ironic era...

442
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:10,966
The era that doesn't
make any sense.

443
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,534
Stop it with all this meme
bullshit, okay?

444
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:15,449
It was the flashpoint.

445
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,190
Shut up.
The genesis.

446
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:18,495
Shut up.

447
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,149
You caused it all, Zookeeper.

448
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:21,455
Shut the fuck up.

449
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:22,978
You killed him, didn't you?

450
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:24,719
I didn't do anything wrong.

451
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,981
It was you.

452
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:28,157
Let me go.
To my real house.

453
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:30,290
Not wherever I am now.Confess.

454
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,249
I'm a good person, okay?
I did the right thing!

455
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:34,903
Confess! Confess!
Confess!

456
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:36,513
This is bullshit. Confess! Confess!

457
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:38,689
Confess! Confess!
Confess! Confess!

458
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,213
Confess! Confess!

459
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:43,085
Okay!
O-fucking-kay.

460
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,305
I shot Harambe!

461
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:47,220
I shot him in the fucking head!

462
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:48,830
I'm the guy!

463
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,314
What the fuck
are you talking about?

464
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:56,055
I started everything?

465
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:59,319
Trump? The coronavirus?
The shootings? Fuck you!

466
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:00,668
It's the truth!

467
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:02,365
I saved a boy's life.

468
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:05,586
I saved a 3-year-old boy's life.

469
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:07,849
You should have let him die.

470
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:09,372
You're an idiot.

471
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:13,115
You're a stupid fucking
asshole idiot!

472
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:14,551
And I'm leaving.

473
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:15,901
Lockdown, fuck face.

474
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,859
There's a safer at home order.

475
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:20,688
That doesn't mean I can't leave!

476
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,733
You can't kidnap somebody
just because

477
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:24,387
there's a safer at home order!

478
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:26,476
Have you forgotten
who has the gun, here?

479
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,349
Fuck you!
And fuck your gun.

480
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:31,133
I'd rather be shot
in the back of the head

481
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:33,179
like that piece of shit Harambe

482
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:35,529
than stay here
another god damn second.

483
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:38,401
Fuck you!

484
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:39,489
Fuck you!

485
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:41,840
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

486
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,232
Fuck you!

487
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:44,886
Fuck you, murderer!

488
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,888
Murderer?
I'm a hero!

489
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:49,499
That's kid's alive
because of me.

490
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:56,202
Who are you?
Really? Really?

491
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:59,945
I'm a monkey who was fired
by the monkey Overlords

492
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:04,601
from the Ministry of Propaganda
and I want revenge.

493
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:11,130
No. No. You?

494
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:13,219
You're just a crazy
Internet troll

495
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:15,090
who decided to hunt me down.

496
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:16,875
Well here's what you should do.

497
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:20,269
Just accept that I did
the right thing.

498
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:23,185
I did something more
significant and meaningful

499
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:25,100
than you'll ever do.

500
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:31,280
Okay. Sure.

501
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:35,632
So, I guess that means that
you're innocent and free to go.

502
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:36,938
Right?

503
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:38,897
So fuck off.

504
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,202
Get the fuck out of here.

505
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:41,508
Don't forget the toilet paper.

506
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:43,075
It's super important, isn't it?

507
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:44,728
Shut up.

508
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:54,042
Hi.

509
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:05,271
God damn it!

510
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:13,148
No, no.

511
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:23,115
No! Please!

512
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:25,726
Oh, you think you're so smart,
don't you?

513
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:43,787
You thought you were just,
like, free to go?

514
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:47,182
The chains came off
and you could just leave?

515
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:56,626
In this house,

516
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,280
you can go
wherever you wanna go,

517
00:32:58,324 --> 00:33:02,197
you can do
whatever you wanna do.

518
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:04,112
But you can't leave.

519
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:06,375
Not till I'm finished with you.

520
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,116
See, this is my playground.

521
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:15,297
And I have a rendezvous
with the Overlords.

522
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:17,952
And I need to tell them that...

523
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,694
that we need to make a deal.

524
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:25,742
Because I have the Zookeeper.

525
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,243
Hey Overlords.

526
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:51,507
It's me. Ya boy.

527
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:53,466
Remember me?
The guy you threw into prison?

528
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:56,034
Have I got a surprise for you...
Oh, fuck, that's stupid.

529
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,600
Shit.

530
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:03,432
Just do it, just do it.

531
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:05,782
Yeah, they're gonna be happy
to hear from you.

532
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,007
Operator: We're sorry.

533
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,942
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

534
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:18,882
or is no longer in service.

535
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:20,493
What the fuck?

536
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:27,108
Zookeeper: So he has no idea
I'm able to call you.

537
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:29,067
Wife: But you can't
call the police?

538
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,330
No. No.
I tried, but it...

539
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:33,723
My phone just acts like it's
disconnected or something.

540
00:34:33,766 --> 00:34:35,092
Yeah. Wait. Yeah.
Because I've been trying

541
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,615
to call you for hours
and it says that the number

542
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,077
isn't even in service.

543
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,733
So I can call you,
but nothing else.

544
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:45,257
Look, I've been talking
to the police

545
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,085
and they're searching.
Okay? So don't worry.

546
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,000
Thanks, babe.

547
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:52,132
I love you so much.

548
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:55,571
I love you, too.

549
00:34:55,614 --> 00:34:59,009
There is something else
that the police told me but...

550
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:03,492
I don't know
if you want to hear it.

551
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:06,060
Hey. Hey.
You know...

552
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,976
You know you can be
honest with me.

553
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:11,457
I know. I know. This is important.

554
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,285
We can't hide things right now.

555
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,116
There are others missing.

556
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,684
Others?
Others like who?

557
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,923
Like a bunch of people who
worked at the Cincinnati Zoo.

558
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:25,601
Like ten of them.

559
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:27,405
They all went missing over
the last few months and I...

560
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:30,128
I don't know. I guess that
maybe we were so distracted

561
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:32,086
with the virus
and stuff that we missed it?

562
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,870
Plus... Plus the toilet paper.

563
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:35,263
We are all out.
Okay?

564
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:36,656
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

565
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,745
So what happened?

566
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:41,356
I finished it all.
I'm sorry.

567
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,271
What?
The toilet paper.

568
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:45,186
I finished it.
No, no, no.

569
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,102
My old co-workers.
What happened to them?

570
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,931
Oh! Yeah. Nobody knows.
They're gone.

571
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:52,814
The police think that
this guy's hunting people

572
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:55,065
who worked there,
but they don't know why.

573
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:01,898
I know why.

574
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:07,861
And he was only hunting one.

575
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:12,387
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Okay, okay.

576
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:14,128
Umm. Okay.
I promise the police

577
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,130
are looking for the house, okay?

578
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,134
And look, they said that if
it's an exact replica,

579
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,916
then that should
be easy to find. Shit!

580
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,092
I don't know why they haven't
found it yet.

581
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:23,592
I can't believe this.
Okay, you just went out

582
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,159
for a regular trip
to the grocery store.

583
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,010
Now this?
Oh, my god!

584
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:28,379
You should be here with me
right now.

585
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:29,859
You should be here with me
with the...

586
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:32,625
With the toilet paper.
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

587
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,586
Babe.

588
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,936
I'm bringing home
this toilet paper to you.

589
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,157
I'm not dropping the ball
this time.

590
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,813
Wait. This time?
What does that mean?

591
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:50,773
No, no, no.
I... I... I mean...

592
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:53,298
I'm bringing home
the toilet paper to you.

593
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:55,125
Because it's important.

594
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:58,172
And this asshole
isn't stopping me.

595
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:01,567
I'm taking action.

596
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,483
You know I can take action,
right?

597
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:06,441
He's such an idiot.

598
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:09,270
Letting me walk around
like this.

599
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:13,927
I love you, babe.

600
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,189
I love you so much.

601
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,973
More than you can ever know.

602
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:21,413
I love you too, babe.

603
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:29,899
You can do this.

604
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:40,606
God damn it!

605
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,876
Economist: Come on,
you piece of shit phone.

606
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:52,487
Why don't you call?

607
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:53,923
Why don't you?

608
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:56,012
Fucking.

609
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:58,493
God damn it.

610
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:01,670
Fuck you.

611
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:04,107
Hey.

612
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:06,371
I want to apologize.

613
00:38:06,414 --> 00:38:08,590
I was, um...

614
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:10,462
wrong to judge you.

615
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:13,943
And make fun of your memes.

616
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:16,294
I'm just a little confused
right now

617
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:19,384
and under a lot of pressure
if you can't tell.

618
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:26,565
I was upset when you threw
those accusations at me and...

619
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:30,133
I hope you'll understand it's...

620
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:34,964
it's not easy to accept
fault sometimes.

621
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,575
Well, it's important.

622
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,449
Your test came back negative.

623
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:43,451
Come here.
Take a look at this meme.

624
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:51,720
"Beware the Jabberwock,"
Lewis Carroll.

625
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:53,374
The day before 9/11.

626
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:02,949
You don't like Lewis Carroll?

627
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:10,913
Okay!

628
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,393
Okay.

629
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:15,396
Whatever you're doing, Stop.

630
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,051
Just let me go.
Let me out of here.

631
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:23,404
Hey.
I'll shoot you!

632
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:25,537
It wouldn't be the first time,
remember?

633
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:34,894
Economist:
You never learn, Zookeeper.

634
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:38,767
I give you freedom because
you have no power here.

635
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:40,769
What's going on?

636
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:43,424
How is any of this possible?

637
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,774
You want another explanation?

638
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:47,297
We already went down that
rabbit hole

639
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:50,300
and you walked out on me.

640
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:51,867
This is impossible!

641
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:54,783
No. Eating your own ass
is impossible.

642
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:57,220
How do you do that?

643
00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:59,484
You're in a computer
simulation, dumb-ass.

644
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:01,311
That's not true!

645
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:02,487
Your gun is a banana now.

646
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:08,536
Let me out.
I don't...

647
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,669
I don't want to be in here
anymore.

648
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:13,367
Tough shit.
I don't want to be here either.

649
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:19,504
Then let's leave!

650
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:21,593
Just go back home.

651
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:24,247
Back to my wife.
Back to reality.

652
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:25,771
That's a simulation too!

653
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:27,468
There is no Earth anymore.

654
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:29,165
Earth is gone.

655
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:31,298
H-How? Why?

656
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:34,388
Data collection. Of what?

657
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,348
Like their own would react
to a series

658
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:40,742
of catastrophic scenarios.

659
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:42,483
Intelligent species?

660
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:46,008
Viruses. Terrorist attacks.
Natural disasters.

661
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:50,012
And guess what?
It's almost over!

662
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:51,492
They have their information.

663
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:53,407
They tested every scenario!

664
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,236
Wildfires. Coronavirus.
Meme war.

665
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,933
Boom! Done!

666
00:40:57,977 --> 00:41:01,197
So it's ending? Then...
Then things go back to normal?

667
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:03,591
No!
Don't you understand?

668
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:05,375
They don't need you anymore!

669
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:07,290
They're ending the simulation!

670
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:09,031
Reformatting the hard drive.

671
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:10,859
It's over.

672
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:17,692
I, Donald John Trump...

673
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:18,824
Grab 'em by the pussy...

674
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:20,521
Do solemnly swear.

675
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:25,700
Basket of deplorables.
Racist. Sexist.

676
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:27,659
I love kids jumping on my lap.

677
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:36,232
Why did they choose us?

678
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:37,799
Why did they choose us?

679
00:41:41,455 --> 00:41:43,675
Because I shot a gorilla?

680
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:53,554
Not any gorilla.

681
00:41:53,598 --> 00:41:55,948
The royal gorilla.

682
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:59,429
First in line for the throne.

683
00:41:59,473 --> 00:42:00,953
What the fuck!

684
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:04,846
Our prince was only on earth
as part of a foreign

685
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,088
exchange program,

686
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:07,394
learning your culture.

687
00:42:07,437 --> 00:42:10,440
He was a Simian of culture!
Shot dead!

688
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:12,921
An undisputed
declaration of war!

689
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,358
So the Overlords took
your planet, destroyed it,

690
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,578
and re-uploaded it
onto a computer server,

691
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:19,580
along with everyone's
digital consciousness.

692
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,147
You never even knew it happened.

693
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,845
They decided to use your planet
as a testing ground...

694
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,151
Introduce stimuli,

695
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:27,849
study it, take notes,
like rats in a maze.

696
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:30,330
And you know what happens
to rats in a maze, don't you?

697
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:33,507
They're disposed of once
they're no longer useful.

698
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:37,467
Wait. You're an alien
anda monkey?

699
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,731
Duh!
My skin right now?

700
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:41,471
This is just a virtual avatar.

701
00:42:41,515 --> 00:42:42,908
You think I wanna
look like this?

702
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:44,126
Look like you?

703
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,606
You don't look like me.

704
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,999
What?
Of course I do.

705
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,696
All you people look the same.

706
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,176
Jesus Christ.

707
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:51,612
Jesus Christ?

708
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:54,963
So you enslave us
but pray to our gods?

709
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,052
Jesus Christ was
a bonobo ape, you dope,

710
00:42:57,096 --> 00:42:59,620
and you killed him too!
Now, listen to me!

711
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:02,405
I was the leading meme economist
at the Ministry of Propaganda,

712
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:04,756
but I couldn't contain
the spread of Harambe memes.

713
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:05,974
No one could have done it.

714
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:07,541
It was an impossible task.

715
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,021
The royal family experienced

716
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:11,327
not just the heartbreaking loss
of their prince,

717
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:14,635
but complete humiliation on
the interstellar Internet too.

718
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:16,811
So I was punished.
They sent me here,

719
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:18,508
to a virtual
and isolated prison.

720
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:20,206
A prison for my mind,

721
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:23,470
built on the very computer
server now housing humanity.

722
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:25,211
And honestly?
I don't blame them.

723
00:43:25,254 --> 00:43:27,169
I blame you.

724
00:43:27,213 --> 00:43:29,476
Years I've waited.
Going mad.

725
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:31,521
Nothing to do and no one
to talk to.

726
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:33,828
And knowing that the eventual
end of the simulation

727
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:35,525
would mean my end as well.

728
00:43:35,569 --> 00:43:36,918
So with time, I found a way

729
00:43:36,962 --> 00:43:39,355
to hack into the coding
of my virtual prison.

730
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:41,836
I learned to bend its reality
to my will.

731
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,318
I started by spawning food,
a bed, material comforts.

732
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:49,539
And with time,
my power over this domain grew.

733
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,716
On rare occasions,
I learned to cross over,

734
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:53,195
and for brief moments,

735
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:55,676
I could pass into
the larger human simulation.

736
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,374
And I had only one mission...

737
00:43:58,418 --> 00:44:00,202
To find you, Zookeeper.

738
00:44:00,246 --> 00:44:02,378
The man who uprooted my life
and cost me everything.

739
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:05,468
The man who sent me here
to my own personal hell!

740
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:08,167
And when I present your digital
consciousness to the Overlords?

741
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:16,210
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
I will earn back my freedom!

742
00:44:31,016 --> 00:44:34,323
So I've been kidnapped
by an alien monkey economist.

743
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:36,499
Yeah.

744
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:38,588
On the verge of the apocalypse.

745
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:40,199
Mm-hmm.

746
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:43,811
Where my wife, my friends,
and my family are gonna die?

747
00:44:43,855 --> 00:44:45,595
Yeah.
But not me.

748
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:48,555
And not you yet either,
because I'm using you

749
00:44:48,598 --> 00:44:50,165
as leverage
against the Overlords.

750
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:54,430
In 2016, the Overlords
tried to find you,

751
00:44:54,474 --> 00:44:57,085
but the Cincinnati Zoo did
such a good job of hiding you

752
00:44:57,129 --> 00:44:58,628
that they couldn't find you
and they had to give up.

753
00:44:58,652 --> 00:45:02,264
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

754
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:05,180
You said
I'm not gonna die... yet?

755
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:06,834
Well, I can't imagine

756
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:08,290
that the Overlords
are gonna be kind to you

757
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:09,857
when they get their hands
on you, Zookeeper.

758
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:12,666
No, no, no. You can't just
hand me over to them.

759
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,624
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I totally can.

760
00:45:14,668 --> 00:45:16,278
You ruined my life.

761
00:45:16,322 --> 00:45:20,065
I won't go.
I won't let you touch me.

762
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:22,284
Yeah, see,
I think you forgot something.

763
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:24,688
I can, like, make a baseball
bat, like, spawn out of nowhere

764
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,898
into my hands and just beat
the living shit out of you,

765
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:30,553
so I think you'll go wherever
I tell you to go.

766
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:32,947
Fuck!

767
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:35,950
Can't you just...
look into your heart?

768
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:39,998
Please?
Find some forgiveness?

769
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:41,695
Forgiveness?

770
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:48,876
Forgiveness.

771
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:57,885
You know how you mentioned
Jesus Christ before?

772
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:03,021
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

773
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:06,111
I am awaiting the return
of the one and only savior

774
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:08,983
Harambe himself.

775
00:46:09,027 --> 00:46:10,811
And after he returns
and tells us

776
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:15,294
what the meaning of life is,
then and only then,

777
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:17,383
would I consider
putting our differences aside.

778
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:20,212
But if I were you, I would not
keep my fingers crossed,

779
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:22,997
because I don't think he's gonna
be lowering from the heavens

780
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,173
anytime soon
to absolve us of our sins.

781
00:46:25,217 --> 00:46:28,350
So, please, you'll have to
excuse me if I don't roll over

782
00:46:28,394 --> 00:46:30,483
and die in this virtual prison
just because

783
00:46:30,526 --> 00:46:32,833
you're throwing yourself
some sort of pity party.

784
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:34,487
I don't understand.

785
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,315
Don't you control
the simulation?

786
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:38,012
Can't you stop it from ending?

787
00:46:38,056 --> 00:46:40,710
Okay. No.
We are not in the simulation.

788
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:42,495
We are adjacent
to the simulation,

789
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:47,326
on the same hard drive,
in the prison that I hacked.

790
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:49,197
Look.

791
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:52,548
Stop trying to negotiate
with me.

792
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:56,770
Zookeeper, you are fucked.

793
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,250
I am meeting with the Overlords

794
00:46:58,293 --> 00:46:59,817
and I am going
to make the exchange,

795
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,863
and there is nothing
that you can do about it.

796
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:16,268
You say this is my fault?

797
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:18,139
I do.
You know what I think?

798
00:47:18,183 --> 00:47:21,229
I don't.

799
00:47:21,273 --> 00:47:24,972
I think this is your fault.

800
00:47:25,016 --> 00:47:28,497
My fault? You think this is
my... okay. Okay.

801
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:31,892
Yeah. You and
the stupid Overlords!

802
00:47:31,936 --> 00:47:35,504
One gorilla dies and you
genocide an entire planet?

803
00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:37,115
We needed the data!
Alright?

804
00:47:37,158 --> 00:47:38,657
Like, we were gonna go
to another planet,

805
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:39,813
but you fucked up.

806
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,294
No, you fucked up.

807
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:44,078
Aren't you the guy
who's supposed to control

808
00:47:44,122 --> 00:47:45,558
the floodgate of memes?

809
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:49,344
Mister fucking
meme economist? Huh?

810
00:47:49,388 --> 00:47:51,869
And you're so proud
of the prison

811
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:53,827
that you've seized control over.

812
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,437
Well, tell me this.

813
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:58,701
How come you weren't afraid
of the gun

814
00:47:58,745 --> 00:48:00,834
but you were afraid
of the virus?

815
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,444
What's up with that?

816
00:48:02,488 --> 00:48:04,055
It's a computer virus.

817
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:11,932
Well, your world in here
still sucks.

818
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,760
It's state of the art, bitch.

819
00:48:13,803 --> 00:48:15,805
Bugging out.

820
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:18,373
Bumping into doors and shit
wherever I go?

821
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:20,114
Fuck you! Alright?
It does its job.

822
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:21,768
It keeps you isolated.

823
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:22,856
Oh, does it, now?

824
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,336
Yeah. It does.

825
00:48:24,379 --> 00:48:27,295
Then how come I was able
to call my wife?

826
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:28,949
Huh?

827
00:48:33,823 --> 00:48:35,477
You can't call your wife.

828
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:37,044
I know you have that phone.

829
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:39,351
But you can't use the phone.
The phone doesn't work here.

830
00:48:39,394 --> 00:48:42,223
Go ahead! Call your wife.
The phone does not work!

831
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:44,878
Motherfucker,
I called her twice!

832
00:48:50,101 --> 00:48:51,493
What?

833
00:48:51,537 --> 00:48:53,626
Yeah!
And she's got the police

834
00:48:53,669 --> 00:48:54,975
looking for me and everything,

835
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,257
and I know they're not
gonna find me,

836
00:48:56,281 --> 00:49:00,154
but still.
You had no idea.

837
00:49:00,198 --> 00:49:02,765
That... that's not possible.

838
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:04,680
Oh, yeah?
Well maybe I should

839
00:49:04,724 --> 00:49:06,769
just call her right now, huh?

840
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,344
I said maybe I should call her
right now?

841
00:49:22,437 --> 00:49:24,700
The... the firewall's
malfunctioning.

842
00:49:24,744 --> 00:49:26,876
All the inputs and outputs
are crossing.

843
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,704
The whole code is going haywire!

844
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:30,271
Wait, what does that mean?

845
00:49:30,315 --> 00:49:32,708
It means some fucked up shit
is happening right now?

846
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:34,406
Like what?

847
00:49:36,103 --> 00:49:37,104
Oh.

848
00:49:37,148 --> 00:49:40,629
Like that.
Oh, no.

849
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:42,370
No, no, no, no, no shit!

850
00:49:42,414 --> 00:49:44,416
What's going on?
I think...

851
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:46,287
I think the Overlords
are reformatting

852
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:49,029
the hard drive, like, right now.

853
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:51,597
They're destroying
the whole simulation now?

854
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,383
Overlords!
I have the Zookeeper!

855
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:57,037
Can you, like,
take us out of here?

856
00:49:57,081 --> 00:49:58,212
You know?

857
00:49:58,256 --> 00:50:00,736
Before it all ends, please?

858
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,608
So they're not coming for us?

859
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:07,352
Overlords!
I have the Zookeeper!

860
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:09,571
Overlords!

861
00:50:09,615 --> 00:50:12,270
Wait.
So you never talked to them,

862
00:50:12,313 --> 00:50:13,923
did you?
Shut up.

863
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:16,274
You couldn't call 'cause
your phone didn't work!

864
00:50:16,317 --> 00:50:17,623
Shut the fuck up!

865
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:20,278
So you're just gonna die
like the rest of us!

866
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:21,714
Fuck you!
Just shut up!

867
00:50:21,757 --> 00:50:23,455
That's what you get!

868
00:50:23,498 --> 00:50:26,936
Using a hero like me
as leverage to go free!

869
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,331
While I get tortured
and killed by monkeys!

870
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,333
Okay.
I ran a diagnostic test.

871
00:50:32,377 --> 00:50:34,596
This is how much time
we have until the world ends.

872
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:40,211
Now, I need you
to call your wife.

873
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:41,560
What? Why?

874
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:42,928
The whole simulation is
breaking down

875
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:44,278
and disintegrating
until there's nothing.

876
00:50:44,302 --> 00:50:45,714
Okay? You understand that?
That's why you can call

877
00:50:45,738 --> 00:50:47,435
your wife even though
I programmed it

878
00:50:47,479 --> 00:50:49,046
so you could not do that.
Alright?

879
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:51,004
It's because of the breakdown
in the code

880
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,615
that every connection is
falling apart and going haywire.

881
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:56,792
Now, clearly, some connections
are working and some are not.

882
00:50:56,836 --> 00:50:58,620
That is why I need you
to call your wife

883
00:50:58,664 --> 00:51:00,144
so that I can hack
into the program

884
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:02,276
and fill in all the stupid
little fucking holes.

885
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,104
You want to take the call
to my wife

886
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:05,975
and re-route
it to the Overlords?

887
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:07,151
Yes.
That's right.

888
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:08,519
That's exactly what
I want you to do.

889
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:09,999
And I want you to do that
before this gets to zero

890
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:11,590
and everything goes poof.

891
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:18,466
Why in the hell would I do that?

892
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:21,339
Why shouldn't I let you die here
with the rest of us?

893
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:23,123
Call your wife.
No.

894
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:25,169
Call your wife, Zookeeper!

895
00:51:25,212 --> 00:51:27,823
No! We are running out of time!

896
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:30,130
Alright? We need to re-route
the connection!

897
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:31,697
God damn it!

898
00:51:35,701 --> 00:51:37,877
Don't you wanna
say goodbye to her?

899
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:46,277
Okay.
Good.

900
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,539
But.
What?

901
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:48,888
I want something from you first.

902
00:51:48,931 --> 00:51:50,803
Before I make the call.

903
00:51:50,846 --> 00:51:55,460
I want you to admit to me,
right here, right now,

904
00:51:55,503 --> 00:51:57,244
that everything
that's happened...

905
00:51:57,288 --> 00:51:59,333
The extinction of homo sapiens,

906
00:51:59,377 --> 00:52:00,508
the apocalypse,

907
00:52:00,552 --> 00:52:02,336
it's all your fault!

908
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,990
Not mine.

909
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:16,916
Fine.
Okay, fucking fine!

910
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:19,614
I've got her on speed dial.
I mean, of course I do.

911
00:52:19,658 --> 00:52:21,529
She's my wife.

912
00:52:23,401 --> 00:52:26,230
Wife: I'm so scared, baby.
I don't know what's going on.

913
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:27,598
Things are vanishing around
the house

914
00:52:27,622 --> 00:52:29,189
without me touching them.

915
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:32,671
I keep appearing
in random hallways.

916
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:34,281
I told you.
That's the hard drive

917
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:36,936
getting reformatted. What does that mean?

918
00:52:36,979 --> 00:52:39,547
I don't understand
and I'm scared!

919
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:42,637
It... It means...

920
00:52:43,595 --> 00:52:46,685
it means you should try to
call your mom and dad.

921
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:48,426
Say goodbye.

922
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:51,559
Babe?
Baby, I love you

923
00:52:51,603 --> 00:52:54,736
so much.
You have no idea.

924
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,261
I wish I could see your face
one more time.

925
00:52:57,304 --> 00:53:01,874
Just to kiss you
and love you again.

926
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:07,445
Babe?

927
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,449
Babe?

928
00:53:11,492 --> 00:53:15,017
You...
you wanna what?

929
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:16,628
Really? Why?

930
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:22,111
Um...

931
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:25,202
She... She...
She wants to talk to you.

932
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:38,824
Wife:
So you're that kidnapper...

933
00:53:38,867 --> 00:53:42,262
economist guy?

934
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:45,918
Yeah.
That's me. Hi.

935
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:50,096
Can you...
Can you just clarify things?

936
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:51,793
Because I don't understand.

937
00:53:51,837 --> 00:53:54,622
Babe! I already explained
everything to you

938
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:57,234
exactly how he explained
it to me.

939
00:53:57,277 --> 00:53:59,540
No I...
I want to hear it from him.

940
00:53:59,584 --> 00:54:00,976
Babe...
No. I've got this.

941
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,109
I've got this.
Alright? Uh...

942
00:54:03,152 --> 00:54:06,199
simulation,
catastrophic scenarios,

943
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:10,508
data collection,
destruction, done.

944
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:14,033
And I'm gonna die?

945
00:54:14,076 --> 00:54:15,382
Yeah.

946
00:54:15,426 --> 00:54:16,514
Everyone's gonna die?

947
00:54:16,557 --> 00:54:18,777
Yeah.

948
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,822
Why?

949
00:54:20,866 --> 00:54:22,215
How could you do this to us?

950
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,957
Babe, that's exactly
what I've been asking.

951
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,265
They're just a bunch of
incompetent, butt-hurt monkeys!

952
00:54:28,308 --> 00:54:29,570
What? No!

953
00:54:29,614 --> 00:54:31,572
You're the bloodthirsty
Zookeeper.

954
00:54:31,616 --> 00:54:33,487
No way!
Babe, tell him!

955
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:36,142
Tell him who's fault
this really is!

956
00:54:42,714 --> 00:54:46,108
Babe?

957
00:54:46,152 --> 00:54:49,938
Well...
I... I mean you...

958
00:54:49,982 --> 00:54:53,855
You shot the gorilla.

959
00:54:53,899 --> 00:54:56,380
What? You're actually
taking his side?

960
00:54:56,423 --> 00:54:57,511
The right side.

961
00:54:57,555 --> 00:54:58,947
I'm just saying I don't know.

962
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:01,733
You should be taking my side!

963
00:55:01,776 --> 00:55:03,561
I don't know!

964
00:55:03,604 --> 00:55:05,650
It might be his fault, sure!

965
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:07,129
But maybe it's yours!

966
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:09,784
I mean, have you even
considered that?

967
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:12,047
The world is ending and there
are other people in it

968
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:13,397
other than you.

969
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,313
Are we really doing this
right now? Really?

970
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:17,705
I'm not doing anything.

971
00:55:17,749 --> 00:55:19,751
Of course you are!
Um...

972
00:55:19,794 --> 00:55:21,927
Oh, I am, am I?
Oh, yeah?

973
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,450
Well, tell me, babe.

974
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:27,106
Where is my god damn
toilet paper? Hmm?

975
00:55:27,149 --> 00:55:29,064
Too much of a hassle for you?

976
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:30,762
You just had to go
and get kidnapped

977
00:55:30,805 --> 00:55:33,547
while you were out getting
my fucking toilet paper!

978
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:40,337
I hate you!
I fucking hate you so much!

979
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,730
I hate you too,
you fucking miserable asshole!

980
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:46,473
You have never brought
anything positive into my life!

981
00:55:46,517 --> 00:55:48,910
Oh!
That's all I do!

982
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:50,695
I try to bring positivity
into your life.

983
00:55:50,738 --> 00:55:53,524
By... By eating away
at my fucking soul?

984
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:55,482
I hate you.
I hate you!

985
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:58,093
I fucking hate your fucking
stupid face

986
00:55:58,137 --> 00:55:59,767
and I'm so fucking happy
that I never have

987
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:01,053
to fucking see it again!

988
00:56:01,096 --> 00:56:03,229
You know what?
Hey. You know what?

989
00:56:03,272 --> 00:56:04,361
Oh.
What's that, my love?

990
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:06,754
I'm glad you fucked Jeremy!

991
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:10,410
Let him cradle you in his arms
as you both fucking die!

992
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:12,412
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

993
00:56:12,456 --> 00:56:15,154
Well I'm glad
I fucked Jeremy, too.

994
00:56:15,197 --> 00:56:17,112
Don't you fucking say that!

995
00:56:17,156 --> 00:56:20,377
At least he knows how to
provide for me. Be a man.

996
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:25,164
Why are you so obsessed
with this toilet paper?

997
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:27,340
It's insane!

998
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,212
Because I need to wipe my ass!
That's why!

999
00:56:30,256 --> 00:56:32,084
Well, maybe you should just
get Jeremy

1000
00:56:32,127 --> 00:56:34,042
to wipe your ass for you?

1001
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:35,609
Oh!
Well, he may as well.

1002
00:56:35,653 --> 00:56:38,438
He's been doing plenty
to my ass already.

1003
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:41,789
Shut the fuck up!

1004
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,008
Shut up!

1005
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,371
Is your marriage my fault too?

1006
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,330
Shut up!
You know what I'm gonna do?

1007
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:03,507
You know what
I'm gonna do, babe?

1008
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:06,988
You have no idea
what I'm gonna do.

1009
00:57:07,032 --> 00:57:08,468
Fuck the toilet paper!

1010
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:13,386
I can do so much more
than petty little tasks.

1011
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,084
I'm gonna make the ultimate
sacrifice for you.

1012
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:18,173
Just to show you how much
of a hero

1013
00:57:18,217 --> 00:57:20,001
I really am!

1014
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:21,481
Oh. Oh, are you?

1015
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:24,353
Yeah! Yeah.
Economist and I are...

1016
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:26,399
are gonna call the Overlords
to negotiate.

1017
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,359
And I'm gonna negotiate that
they keep the simulation going.

1018
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:36,061
Just to take me and torture me
or kill me, or whatever!

1019
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:40,152
But to just let the rest
of humanity live!

1020
00:57:40,195 --> 00:57:41,545
You're not Jesus Christ, babe.

1021
00:57:41,588 --> 00:57:43,329
You're not dying for my sins.

1022
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:45,026
You're not Harambe either.

1023
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:48,726
Fuck you!
And fuckyou!

1024
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:51,032
I'm gonna save you
and the rest of the Earth!

1025
00:57:51,076 --> 00:57:53,078
Because I'm a hero!

1026
00:57:53,121 --> 00:57:55,863
That's what I am!
And you're a bitch!

1027
00:57:55,907 --> 00:57:59,084
So go choke on
Jeremy's cock, bitch!

1028
00:58:04,437 --> 00:58:06,546
So you're officially on board
with contacting the Overlords?

1029
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,049
Let's just get it
over with, okay?

1030
00:58:08,093 --> 00:58:09,810
And you really think you can
convince them to, like,

1031
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:11,488
spare the rest of humanity?

1032
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:12,924
It's worth a shot, isn't it?

1033
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:14,597
I have a question. Like,
if you hate your wife so much,

1034
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:16,077
why are you trying to save her?
I just wanna know?

1035
00:58:16,101 --> 00:58:18,538
Let's just fucking make
the call, okay?

1036
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:19,844
Okay, okay, okay!

1037
00:58:19,887 --> 00:58:22,716
That's what I'm trying to do,
alright?

1038
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,719
But first this is
what's gotta happen.

1039
00:58:25,763 --> 00:58:27,895
I think I found the hole
in the firewall

1040
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:30,115
so I need to reboot
my prison's hard drive

1041
00:58:30,158 --> 00:58:31,788
and after I do
that we can start over to see

1042
00:58:31,812 --> 00:58:33,692
if the communication
is routed for the new call.

1043
00:58:33,727 --> 00:58:34,685
That's what we need.

1044
00:58:34,728 --> 00:58:37,209
Reboot it?
Yeah. Yeah.

1045
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:39,733
When I reboot the prison's
hard drive I get to re-write

1046
00:58:39,777 --> 00:58:41,779
the code which allows me
to re-set the parameters.

1047
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:43,998
If I re-set the parameters
I get to do whatever I want.

1048
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:46,000
Kinda like how I built
this house for you. Right?

1049
00:58:46,044 --> 00:58:47,915
So, alright, let's go.

1050
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:49,613
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1051
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:53,834
You said we can reboot it
with any parameter that we want?

1052
00:58:53,878 --> 00:58:56,358
Yeah. Whatever. Why?
What are you getting at?

1053
00:58:56,402 --> 00:59:01,276
When you reboot this simulation,
add a parameter for me.

1054
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,715
Make it a world
where Harambe never died,

1055
00:59:04,758 --> 00:59:07,369
and then we'll see how
things would've turned out!

1056
00:59:07,413 --> 00:59:09,023
You want me to do that
so you can see

1057
00:59:09,067 --> 00:59:10,590
what a perfect world
would look like!

1058
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:13,288
With, like, flowers and rainbows
and bananas everywhere!

1059
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:14,855
Right?
No!

1060
00:59:14,899 --> 00:59:17,162
I want to see a world where you
and your species

1061
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:19,077
fuck humanity up the ass anyway.

1062
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,382
Oh!
Because that's what

1063
00:59:20,426 --> 00:59:21,645
you guys would've done!
Okay.

1064
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:22,907
Even if I'd done nothing,

1065
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,125
that's what you would've done!

1066
00:59:24,169 --> 00:59:25,562
Yeah. Yeah.
Of course. Of course!

1067
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:26,954
You guys are perfect, alright?

1068
00:59:26,998 --> 00:59:29,217
Sure!
I call bullshit!

1069
00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:31,002
Then do it!

1070
00:59:31,045 --> 00:59:32,351
Let's find out.

1071
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:33,961
You know what your problem is?

1072
00:59:34,005 --> 00:59:35,330
You're one of these crazy
motherfuckers

1073
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:36,877
who will just find
any justification

1074
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:39,532
he can so he doesn't
look like a fucking dick!

1075
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,187
Yeah! Yeah, you!
Hey, you know what?

1076
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:44,208
You know, you sit there
after years of fucking ridicule

1077
00:59:44,232 --> 00:59:45,712
and years of Harambe memes,

1078
00:59:45,756 --> 00:59:47,472
you think you would've, like,
developed a thick skin.

1079
00:59:47,496 --> 00:59:48,822
But no.
Just the opposite with you!

1080
00:59:48,846 --> 00:59:50,325
You just became stubborn.

1081
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:51,936
Refusing to compromise.

1082
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:53,720
That's what fucking happened
to you!

1083
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:57,811
Says the guy who won't test
out my scenario.

1084
00:59:57,855 --> 00:59:59,900
I'm a zookeeper.

1085
00:59:59,944 --> 01:00:01,641
I did my job.

1086
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:03,382
And did it well.

1087
01:00:03,425 --> 01:00:07,299
And you're the guy
who couldn't do his job!

1088
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:10,041
A... A... A so-called
meme economist

1089
01:00:10,084 --> 01:00:12,260
from the Ministry of Propaganda!

1090
01:00:12,304 --> 01:00:15,960
Who let one dead monkey
tank his career!

1091
01:00:16,003 --> 01:00:19,093
And now looks to blame
everybody else but himself

1092
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:22,183
when he couldn't do
his fucking job!

1093
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:27,145
Boot it up.

1094
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:30,322
Or are you just afraid
it'll prove me right?

1095
01:00:32,759 --> 01:00:34,021
Fine. Fuck it.

1096
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:35,414
Fuck it. Fuck it.

1097
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:37,634
Fuck it!
Fuck it!

1098
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,426
What the shit?

1099
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:49,123
Oh.

1100
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:51,778
Before I reboot,
I have to clear out the cache.

1101
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:53,171
Oh. Okay.

1102
01:00:56,435 --> 01:00:59,177
Is this whole thing
running on Windows XP?

1103
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:50,794
Fucking bullshit.

1104
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:53,448
Stupid-ass motherfucking phone.

1105
01:01:53,492 --> 01:01:57,322
God damn it.
It didn't work.

1106
01:01:57,365 --> 01:02:00,412
The phone call to the Overlords
still didn't fucking go through!

1107
01:02:00,455 --> 01:02:02,631
God!

1108
01:02:02,675 --> 01:02:04,851
Okay.
Call your wife.

1109
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:06,984
I'm gonna hack back
into the code, alright?

1110
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:10,988
What are you doing?

1111
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:12,990
Where are you going?
Yo. Hey, hey!

1112
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:14,643
Where you going?
Where you going?!

1113
01:02:14,687 --> 01:02:16,645
I want to see what
this world is like!

1114
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:32,226
Is this better or worse
than the other reality?

1115
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:34,751
Probably better.

1116
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,709
Harambe's alive now.

1117
01:02:45,152 --> 01:02:47,285
It can't be.

1118
01:02:47,328 --> 01:02:51,158
It can't be.

1119
01:02:51,202 --> 01:02:54,466
It's paradise.

1120
01:03:05,564 --> 01:03:07,740
See?

1121
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,699
You could've had a perfect
and peaceful utopia.

1122
01:03:10,743 --> 01:03:13,180
I bet you and your wife would've
still been in love, too.

1123
01:03:13,224 --> 01:03:15,356
Right? But no.
You just had to go along

1124
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,619
and you had to kill
our prince, right?

1125
01:03:17,663 --> 01:03:19,099
That's great.
That's great.

1126
01:03:19,143 --> 01:03:21,101
So, the end of the world
wasyour fault.

1127
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:22,799
Now, I need you
to call your wife,

1128
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,496
get on the phone,
so I can go back

1129
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,846
and hack into the code, and
possibly reroute this call

1130
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:29,327
that I've been trying to do
for-fucking-ever!

1131
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,680
Do it!

1132
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:44,646
Hello? Hey, babe, it's me.

1133
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:48,389
Whoa. Uh, hey.

1134
01:03:48,433 --> 01:03:49,608
Yeah.

1135
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:52,219
Hey.

1136
01:03:52,263 --> 01:03:54,047
I'm sorry I blew up at you

1137
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:58,225
about Jeremy and
all that other stuff.

1138
01:03:58,269 --> 01:04:00,880
What?

1139
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:04,753
But I am still working
on saving you.

1140
01:04:04,797 --> 01:04:08,105
Seriously.

1141
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:12,239
I may not like you,
but there's more at stake here.

1142
01:04:16,374 --> 01:04:18,593
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1143
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:22,075
Listen, why are you calling me
after all these years?

1144
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:24,948
Okay, I'm not gonna give you
any more money.

1145
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:29,909
Hey! Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

1146
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:32,303
Say... Say that again.
Wife: Say what again?

1147
01:04:32,346 --> 01:04:34,783
Uh, just, uh, uh...
How's Jeremy?

1148
01:04:34,827 --> 01:04:37,264
I don't know who the hell
you're talking about.

1149
01:04:37,308 --> 01:04:39,963
Are you drunk?
I'm married to Jeff now.

1150
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:41,355
Wait. Jeff?

1151
01:04:41,399 --> 01:04:43,009
Jeff, as in
tennis-instructor Jeff?

1152
01:04:43,053 --> 01:04:44,619
You can't call me like this!

1153
01:04:44,663 --> 01:04:47,100
The restraining order
is still in place.

1154
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:48,928
You're not my wife, are you?

1155
01:04:48,972 --> 01:04:51,539
You changed the code.

1156
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:53,280
And this is how my marriage
would've gone.

1157
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:54,803
Still fucked up.

1158
01:04:54,847 --> 01:04:56,457
God, I fucking hate you.

1159
01:04:56,501 --> 01:04:59,504
I fucking hate you, too!

1160
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:01,810
Is your chip malfunctioning?

1161
01:05:01,854 --> 01:05:03,812
My what? Your chip.

1162
01:05:03,856 --> 01:05:05,945
The Phil administration
just put out a statement.

1163
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:07,338
If your chip's malfunctioning,

1164
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:08,948
you can get it fixed at the DMV.

1165
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:10,404
Wait, wait, wait!
What administration?

1166
01:05:10,428 --> 01:05:11,951
Could you please say that again?

1167
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:13,344
What?
The Phil administration.

1168
01:05:13,387 --> 01:05:14,911
Wait. Who is this?

1169
01:05:14,954 --> 01:05:16,956
Who is the president?
Is that your boyfriend?

1170
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,740
Hold on. Am I gay
in this timeline?

1171
01:05:18,784 --> 01:05:21,091
Who is the president?!
Who is the president?!

1172
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:23,745
Calm down!
Who do you think?

1173
01:05:23,789 --> 01:05:25,878
Dr. Phil.

1174
01:05:29,055 --> 01:05:31,318
Jesus fucking Christ.

1175
01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:33,253
Does your boyfriend not know
who the president is?

1176
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:34,887
You two realize
it's against the law

1177
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,977
not to update
your microchip implants, right?

1178
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:39,152
Well...

1179
01:05:39,196 --> 01:05:40,893
what do you know?

1180
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:44,549
President Dr. Phil created
a surveillance state.

1181
01:05:44,592 --> 01:05:46,309
That... That... That...
That doesn't mean that...

1182
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:49,119
Doesn't mean what?
That I was right?

1183
01:05:49,162 --> 01:05:51,077
That I... our world
would've been fucked

1184
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:52,600
for data collection anyway?

1185
01:05:52,644 --> 01:05:54,211
You don't know that!
You know?

1186
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:56,450
It's very possible that a bunch
of people really voted...

1187
01:05:56,474 --> 01:05:59,259
For Dr. Phil?
For president?

1188
01:05:59,303 --> 01:06:00,739
I don't know.

1189
01:06:00,782 --> 01:06:02,610
That sounds like some simulated

1190
01:06:02,654 --> 01:06:05,787
catastrophic-scenario
bullshit to me!

1191
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:07,528
But let's find out!

1192
01:06:07,572 --> 01:06:09,922
L-L-Let's check the Internet.

1193
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,576
Let's see what else
we had going on

1194
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:13,491
in current events
from the last few years.

1195
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:14,796
Right? Let's see!

1196
01:06:56,403 --> 01:06:58,057
You see? You see?

1197
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:00,755
Fuck this, okay?
No, fuck it. Fuck it!

1198
01:07:02,888 --> 01:07:04,803
Fucking bullshit!

1199
01:07:04,846 --> 01:07:06,544
Fuck!

1200
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:11,940
So, what do you think happened
in that timeline, huh?

1201
01:07:11,984 --> 01:07:15,074
The royal gorilla crashed
his car in a tunnel in Paris,

1202
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:17,990
and your species wanted revenge
against the tunnel?

1203
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,359
It doesn't make sense.
You know, it just...

1204
01:07:19,383 --> 01:07:20,993
It just fucking
doesn't make sense!

1205
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,169
I bet you still got fired
in that timeline, too.

1206
01:07:23,213 --> 01:07:24,431
Sent to virtual prison.

1207
01:07:24,475 --> 01:07:26,738
Hey, fuck you!
Fuck you!

1208
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:28,435
Let's just make the call
to the Overlords

1209
01:07:28,479 --> 01:07:30,872
so I can save my bitch
fucking wife.

1210
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:32,918
That's what I'm fucking
doing, asshole.

1211
01:07:32,961 --> 01:07:35,181
I'm rebooting!

1212
01:07:35,225 --> 01:07:39,316
But this time, a new scenario
with new parameters.

1213
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,970
What you got this time?
More brilliant ideas?

1214
01:07:42,014 --> 01:07:43,624
I'm setting up a scenario

1215
01:07:43,668 --> 01:07:46,627
where I successfully controlled
the floodgate of memes,

1216
01:07:46,671 --> 01:07:49,282
stayed in my job
at the Ministry of Propaganda,

1217
01:07:49,326 --> 01:07:53,417
while humans were left totally
isolated to fuck themselves!

1218
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:55,462
You're creating
the perfect scenario.

1219
01:07:55,506 --> 01:07:56,768
You realize that?

1220
01:07:56,811 --> 01:07:58,509
Finally, a world where humanity

1221
01:07:58,552 --> 01:08:01,077
can come together
and solve our ownproblems.

1222
01:08:49,211 --> 01:08:50,952
Babe, who are you fucking?

1223
01:08:50,996 --> 01:08:52,737
Vladimir?
Who's Vladimir?

1224
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:54,478
Hey, you!

1225
01:08:54,521 --> 01:08:57,828
Hey, you!

1226
01:08:57,871 --> 01:09:00,005
Who's the president? What?

1227
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:02,442
Who's the fucking president
of the United States?!

1228
01:09:02,486 --> 01:09:06,751
Who the hell do you think?

1229
01:09:06,794 --> 01:09:08,100
Kid Rock.

1230
01:09:13,452 --> 01:09:16,326
♪ Born to the crime

1231
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:24,334

Ugh. Ew.
Ugh.

1250
01:10:23,088 --> 01:10:25,090
No. 9/11.

1251
01:10:25,133 --> 01:10:27,135
9/11?

1252
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:29,007
Yeah, 9/11.

1253
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:31,618
Why are you so obsessed
with 9/11?

1254
01:10:31,662 --> 01:10:33,248
Because its proof that humans
are the worst,

1255
01:10:33,272 --> 01:10:35,492
and there was no simian
interference at all.

1256
01:10:35,535 --> 01:10:38,712
Monkeys couldn't do 9/11.

1257
01:10:38,755 --> 01:10:40,671
Monkeys could've
done 9/11 twice!

1258
01:10:40,714 --> 01:10:43,239
But we wouldn't, because
we're not fucking assholes!

1259
01:10:43,282 --> 01:10:44,544
Oh, yeah?!

1260
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:45,999
Well, why don't you create
a scenario

1261
01:10:46,023 --> 01:10:48,418
where monkeys did do 9/11?

1262
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,071
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1263
01:10:50,115 --> 01:10:51,421
Yeah?
Yeah!

1264
01:10:51,464 --> 01:10:52,639
Yeah?!
Yeah!

1265
01:10:52,683 --> 01:10:54,293
Yeah!
Yeah!

1266
01:10:54,337 --> 01:10:56,295
Let's do this!

1267
01:11:07,045 --> 01:11:09,090
Who's the president?

1268
01:11:09,134 --> 01:11:10,701
Ni yiwéi shi shéi?
Chénglóng.

1269
01:11:10,744 --> 01:11:12,311
Is that French?

1270
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:18,186
I told you we could do it twice!

1271
01:11:24,236 --> 01:11:25,759
But who's the president?

1272
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,286
Aw, come on, what the fuck?! Fuck!

1273
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:32,462
You know what I want?
I want to see a world

1274
01:11:32,505 --> 01:11:34,464
where 9/11
never happened at all!

1275
01:11:34,507 --> 01:11:36,074
What's that gonna prove?

1276
01:11:36,117 --> 01:11:38,139
9/11 wasn't the flashpoint for
everything wrong with humanity!

1277
01:11:38,163 --> 01:11:39,860
You wanna bet?!

1278
01:11:42,385 --> 01:11:43,951
Uh!
Ugh!

1279
01:11:53,221 --> 01:11:55,485
Economist: You are
such a fucking puss!

1280
01:11:55,528 --> 01:11:57,748
Fight me like a man!

1281
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,753
Son of a...
I will fucking crush you!

1282
01:12:09,193 --> 01:12:11,215
See, your species wanted to
evolve to be more like us.

1283
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:12,719
More like de-evolution!

1284
01:12:12,763 --> 01:12:13,957
Well, how about
a scenario where...

1285
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:15,418
Where... Where what?!

1286
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,811
Where humans didn't crash
their own economy in 2008.

1287
01:12:17,855 --> 01:12:19,509
How about that?!

1288
01:12:23,904 --> 01:12:25,079
Uh, uh, uh, uh, ugh...

1289
01:12:29,954 --> 01:12:31,085
What you gonna do?

1290
01:12:31,129 --> 01:12:32,260
Mmm.
Mmm.

1291
01:12:32,304 --> 01:12:34,219
Aaah! Aah.

1292
01:12:39,093 --> 01:12:40,312
Fuck these bananas!

1293
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:45,404
How about a world
without Hurricane Katrina?

1294
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:46,536
Deal.

1295
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:57,503
Fucking eat the banana!
Eat it!

1296
01:12:57,547 --> 01:12:59,549
No Waco.
Waco never happened.

1297
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:00,767
No Waco!

1298
01:13:10,995 --> 01:13:12,823
Aah!
Ha-ha!

1299
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:14,215
Fuck you!

1300
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:16,957
What if Hitler got into
art school?

1301
01:13:27,446 --> 01:13:30,144
What if America
was never founded?

1302
01:13:37,717 --> 01:13:38,936
Fuck you!

1303
01:13:42,243 --> 01:13:44,898
Both: The national anthem
is "Ram Ranch"?

1304
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:47,291
Aaah! Aaah!

1305
01:13:47,335 --> 01:13:48,859
Dickhead!

1306
01:13:48,902 --> 01:13:51,862
I'd love to shit on you
and let flies cover you

1307
01:13:51,905 --> 01:13:54,691
and coat you with honey!
Shit, you fuckin' pea-brain.

1308
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:58,041
You motherfucking stupid
motherfucking son

1309
01:13:58,085 --> 01:14:00,478
of a bitch pussy
wiping-ass fuck!

1310
01:14:00,523 --> 01:14:02,786
You stupid fucking asshole!

1311
01:14:02,829 --> 01:14:07,486
Yeah, you're
a little ape with a...

1312
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:10,402
Oh, yeah, you've got
a big cock, huh?

1313
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,057
How about you let
your little red thing come out?

1314
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:17,103
I know what apes do!
You throw your shit at people!

1315
01:14:17,148 --> 01:14:18,976
How about rubbing it...

1316
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:38,778
What...

1317
01:14:38,822 --> 01:14:41,259
What if Jesus Christ
was never crucified?

1318
01:14:41,302 --> 01:14:43,914
No. No, no.

1319
01:14:43,957 --> 01:14:46,916
What if the asteroid
never killed the dinosaurs?

1320
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,440
What... Oh, what...

1321
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,007
What if the big bang
never happened?

1322
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:53,837
No. Wait.

1323
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,273
Wait, weren't...

1324
01:14:56,317 --> 01:14:58,842
Weren't we trying
to do something?

1325
01:14:58,885 --> 01:15:01,018
What?
Yeah.

1326
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:03,716
Before we made
all the scenarios,

1327
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,719
wasn't there something important
we were trying to do?

1328
01:15:06,763 --> 01:15:08,764
I... I don't...
I don't think so.

1329
01:15:08,808 --> 01:15:10,505
Oh.

1330
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:14,466
Both: Oh, shit!

1331
01:15:24,737 --> 01:15:27,478
God damn it, this is all
your fault for distracting me!

1332
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:28,741
It's your fault!

1333
01:15:28,785 --> 01:15:30,351
Obviously,
you didn't care enough

1334
01:15:30,395 --> 01:15:31,570
to pay attention to the clock!

1335
01:15:31,614 --> 01:15:33,398
Oh, really?
Yeah!

1336
01:15:33,441 --> 01:15:35,269
Well, I can reboot
a new scenario

1337
01:15:35,313 --> 01:15:36,487
and prove it's your fault.

1338
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,708
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1339
01:15:38,751 --> 01:15:40,318
Yeah?
Yeah!

1340
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:42,450
Yeah?!
Yeah!

1341
01:15:42,494 --> 01:15:44,844
Aah.

1342
01:15:44,888 --> 01:15:46,585
Oh.

1343
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:14,570
Harambe?

1344
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:16,746
My lord.

1345
01:16:16,789 --> 01:16:20,706
My savior.

1346
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,403
You've returned.

1347
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:24,275
How did I not realize?

1348
01:16:24,318 --> 01:16:27,407
When we rebooted,
we created a scenario

1349
01:16:27,452 --> 01:16:28,888
where you were still alive!

1350
01:16:28,932 --> 01:16:34,023
And we awoke your digital
consciousness, didn't we?

1351
01:16:34,067 --> 01:16:36,460
My beautiful children.

1352
01:16:36,504 --> 01:16:38,550
It's like no matter what you do,

1353
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,727
no matter how many times
you change history,

1354
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:43,903
it still doesn't change the fact

1355
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:47,210
that it is yourselves
who need the fixing.

1356
01:16:47,254 --> 01:16:50,388
No.
I did everything right!

1357
01:16:50,431 --> 01:16:53,304
It... It was him.
He...

1358
01:16:53,347 --> 01:16:54,542
He... He screwed up everything!

1359
01:16:54,566 --> 01:16:56,829
He...

1360
01:16:56,873 --> 01:16:59,223
Harambe, please.

1361
01:16:59,266 --> 01:17:01,617
Please.
Tell me what to do.

1362
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,053
The simulation's about to end.

1363
01:17:03,096 --> 01:17:06,012
And the Overlords,
I can't contact them.

1364
01:17:06,056 --> 01:17:10,016
Well, first off, you can quit
being a dumb fuck.

1365
01:17:12,236 --> 01:17:14,978
You too. You shot me
in the fucking head.

1366
01:17:16,893 --> 01:17:19,156
Hah. Please.

1367
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:24,204
Just... Just impart your wisdom
upon us, oh, great one.

1368
01:17:24,814 --> 01:17:27,077
Umm...

1369
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,166
no.

1370
01:17:29,209 --> 01:17:30,602
What?

1371
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,431
Even if I did, you wouldn't
do anything with it.

1372
01:17:33,474 --> 01:17:35,607
Yeah... Yes, we would.

1373
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:38,305
All you do is yell at each other
and blame each other

1374
01:17:38,349 --> 01:17:39,611
for everything.

1375
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,700
In fact, I've been forced
to sit here

1376
01:17:41,744 --> 01:17:43,876
and watch each and every
goddamn scenario

1377
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,575
you guys just played out,
and I'm going fucking bananas.

1378
01:17:47,619 --> 01:17:50,100
Do you not see the futility
of placing blame

1379
01:17:50,143 --> 01:17:52,145
in the face of destruction?

1380
01:17:52,189 --> 01:17:55,061
But of course, it's
much more fun to die

1381
01:17:55,105 --> 01:17:57,716
being correct
than live being wrong.

1382
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,413
The solutions to
all your problems

1383
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:01,371
could literally be
right in front of you,

1384
01:18:01,415 --> 01:18:03,591
and you'd just
call each other cunts

1385
01:18:03,635 --> 01:18:06,072
and feel accomplished.

1386
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:08,379
Anyways, goodbye.

1387
01:18:08,422 --> 01:18:11,208
Uh, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

1388
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:14,254
My child, I'm going to
kill myself again.

1389
01:18:14,298 --> 01:18:15,821
What?

1390
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:18,389
You think I wanna be stuck
in here with you two assholes?

1391
01:18:18,432 --> 01:18:19,607
Really?

1392
01:18:19,651 --> 01:18:21,131
But, Harambe!
Think of all the good...

1393
01:18:26,876 --> 01:18:31,880
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

1394
01:18:57,907 --> 01:18:59,822
Hmm.

1395
01:20:58,766 --> 01:21:00,898
Economist, I'm sorry.

1396
01:21:00,943 --> 01:21:03,119
No, I'msorry.

1397
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:08,298
I know who's fault
this really is.

1398
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:12,041
So do I.

1399
01:21:15,392 --> 01:21:17,655
It's Harambe!
Fuck him!

1400
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:20,571
That fucker! He's such a fucker!

1401
01:21:20,614 --> 01:21:22,660
This is all his fucking fault!
You know that?

1402
01:21:22,702 --> 01:21:24,767
I mean, he didn't even tell us
the meaning of life, right?

1403
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:26,664
Yeah, and if he were here
right now,

1404
01:21:26,707 --> 01:21:29,275
I'd fucking tell himsomething!

1405
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:31,755
I don't know why he had to
talk that way to me!

1406
01:21:31,799 --> 01:21:35,325
Yeah! Fuck... talk down at us
like a fucker!

1407
01:21:35,368 --> 01:21:37,327
That's exactly what I'm saying.
A dick.

1408
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:40,939
You know, I have an idea of what
we could do to get back at him.

1409
01:21:40,983 --> 01:21:42,767
So do I.

1410
01:21:46,335 --> 01:21:48,816
Oh, hey. Look.

1411
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:51,123
The Overlords are calling.

1412
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:53,343
Oh, no shit?
Yeah.

1413
01:21:55,648 --> 01:21:57,651
Oh, hey, Overlords!

1414
01:21:57,695 --> 01:21:59,001
Hey, it's the Economist.

1415
01:21:59,044 --> 01:22:00,175
How's it hangin'?

1416
01:22:00,219 --> 01:22:02,178
Bitches.

1417
01:22:18,803 --> 01:22:21,675
Wife: Hello?

1418
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:23,112
Hey, babe.
It's me.

1419
01:22:23,155 --> 01:22:25,636
Oh, thank God.
Where have you been?

1420
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,290
You know, I've been going crazy.

1421
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:28,963
I'm, like... I'm, like,
sick to my stomach.

1422
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:30,510
I mean, you call me, you tell me

1423
01:22:30,554 --> 01:22:31,879
that the world is ending,
then sucker me

1424
01:22:31,903 --> 01:22:33,425
into a fight about Jeremy.

1425
01:22:33,469 --> 01:22:35,514
And then you hang up
and then disappear!

1426
01:22:35,559 --> 01:22:36,690
Oh, okay. Good!

1427
01:22:36,734 --> 01:22:38,344
It's the real version of you.

1428
01:22:38,388 --> 01:22:39,824
What are you talking about?

1429
01:22:39,867 --> 01:22:42,478
And why on Earth
do you sound so happy?

1430
01:22:42,522 --> 01:22:44,175
We are all about to die!

1431
01:22:44,219 --> 01:22:47,657
No, no! We...
We fixed it!

1432
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:49,050
What?

1433
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:51,009
Yeah, the world
isn't ending anymore.

1434
01:22:51,053 --> 01:22:53,359
Hey, yeah, it's your boy
the Economist!

1435
01:22:53,403 --> 01:22:55,492
Yeah, he's telling the truth.

1436
01:22:55,535 --> 01:22:57,189
What the fuck are you guys
talking about?

1437
01:22:57,233 --> 01:22:59,103
I just spent the last
three hours crying,

1438
01:22:59,148 --> 01:23:00,888
throwing up.
I...

1439
01:23:00,932 --> 01:23:03,041
I barely managed to call my mum
and dad to say goodbye.

1440
01:23:03,065 --> 01:23:05,023
Well, call them back
and say un-goodbye.

1441
01:23:07,504 --> 01:23:09,375
Yeah! No.
It's all good.

1442
01:23:09,419 --> 01:23:11,987
What the fuck?
Wait. How? How?

1443
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:14,293
We brought Harambe back to life.

1444
01:23:14,337 --> 01:23:15,947
We did it by accident.

1445
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:17,557
But we brought him
back digitally.

1446
01:23:17,601 --> 01:23:19,168
And then he killed himself.

1447
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:21,059
So we brought him back again,
but this time with no arms,

1448
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:22,736
so he couldn't
blow his brains out!

1449
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,410
And then we took
his digital consciousness

1450
01:23:24,434 --> 01:23:26,044
and we handed him over
to the Overlords,

1451
01:23:26,088 --> 01:23:28,240
and he took him out of this
prison and put him into theirs!

1452
01:23:28,264 --> 01:23:30,135
And they were so happy.

1453
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:31,745
Oh, God, they were so happy.

1454
01:23:31,789 --> 01:23:33,593
They couldn't believe they
didn't think of it themselves.

1455
01:23:33,617 --> 01:23:35,923
And now they're not ending
the simulation anymore.

1456
01:23:35,967 --> 01:23:37,142
As a reward!

1457
01:23:37,186 --> 01:23:38,839
I fucking told you
I could do it.

1458
01:23:38,883 --> 01:23:40,362
Wait. Really?

1459
01:23:40,406 --> 01:23:42,059
You actually fixed
something, for once?

1460
01:23:42,103 --> 01:23:43,322
Oh! And...

1461
01:23:43,366 --> 01:23:44,671
And they gave me
my old job back!

1462
01:23:44,715 --> 01:23:45,865
Well, actually they
gave me a promotion.

1463
01:23:45,889 --> 01:23:47,152
They made me a general.

1464
01:23:47,196 --> 01:23:49,675
A general for what?

1465
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:52,114
The great meme war!
You'll hear about it.

1466
01:23:52,157 --> 01:23:54,246
And get this!
The simulation?

1467
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:56,379
They're completely retooling it.

1468
01:23:56,422 --> 01:24:00,252
Instead of one simulation
for 7.5 billion minds,

1469
01:24:00,296 --> 01:24:03,342
they're gonna have
7.4 billion simulations.

1470
01:24:03,386 --> 01:24:05,040
One for each of us! Yeah!

1471
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:07,105
And they're basing them off
the programming from my prison.

1472
01:24:07,129 --> 01:24:09,609
And the best part is,
is that everyone's prison

1473
01:24:09,653 --> 01:24:11,611
will be tailored just for them.

1474
01:24:11,655 --> 01:24:14,136
In everyone's prison,
they'll be right

1475
01:24:14,179 --> 01:24:17,443
about everything
100% of the time.

1476
01:24:17,487 --> 01:24:20,142
None of our problems
will be our own fault!

1477
01:24:20,184 --> 01:24:21,577
It's perfect!

1478
01:24:21,621 --> 01:24:24,710
Humans and simians
living in perfect harmony.

1479
01:24:24,755 --> 01:24:26,148
Except for the great meme war.

1480
01:24:29,412 --> 01:24:32,154
Are you... Are you still there?

1481
01:24:33,851 --> 01:24:36,332
Yeah. Yeah.
I... I'm still here.

1482
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:38,334
I just, um...
Well, it sounds like

1483
01:24:38,377 --> 01:24:40,291
you didn't actually
solve anything.

1484
01:24:40,335 --> 01:24:42,077
You just stumbled
onto a solution

1485
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,600
by pure dumb luck.

1486
01:24:43,643 --> 01:24:45,950
And, like, did you even
ask the Overlords

1487
01:24:45,993 --> 01:24:48,126
to stop introducing
crazy stimuli?

1488
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:50,911
To stop experimenting on us
and studying us

1489
01:24:50,955 --> 01:24:53,000
like we're rats?

1490
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,072
Of course we did.

1491
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,813
