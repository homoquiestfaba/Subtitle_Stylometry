00:00:00,613 --> 00:00:02,583
(high-pitch engine rumbling)

2
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:11,121
[Voiceover] I came to Romania

3
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:14,583
to find my sister,
Michelle, but the police

4
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,836
and the American Embassy found her first.

5
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:19,923
This may sound a little strange,

6
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:21,298
but yesterday afternoon

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,676
your sister Michelle was found unconscious

8
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:25,261
in her hotel room.

9
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:28,390
If what you say is true,

10
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:31,560
the vampire Radu is here in Bucharest

11
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:34,728
and your sister is his disciple.

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,523
[Voiceover] With the
help of Professor Popescu

13
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:38,358
from the Folk Art Museum...

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,068
(door creaks)

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,155
I discovered the awful truth.

16
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:50,946
(squish, splatter)

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,960
And fell into the clutches of
an ancient family of vampires.

18
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,838
(groaning)

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,590
No, please!

20
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:06,260
Let her go.

21
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:09,555
Drink will be fed to me.

22
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:14,556
Savor the taste of your
sister's suffering.

23
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:17,940
No!

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,078
Die, you bastard.

25
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:46,926
Come on, Michelle.

26
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:49,095
I can't.

27
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:50,513
The sun...

28
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:51,848
Okay,

29
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,975
I'll wait for you 'til dark.

30
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:56,228
(sobbing)

31
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:15,456
(grunts)

32
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,268
(whimpering, screaming)

33
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:36,216
(ominous music)

34
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:37,950
(screeches)

35
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:49,711
(screeches)

36
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:59,970
I curse you for your beauty,

37
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:04,971
for the innocence of your flesh,

38
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:10,143
for the power you hold over my child.

39
00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:26,415
(hisses)

40
00:06:46,768 --> 00:06:49,438
Her blood will give you life.

41
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,108
(slurps)

42
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:30,223
(soft music)

43
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:04,303
(speaks Romanian)

44
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:07,223
Is there a telephone here, please?

45
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:08,350
Telephone?

46
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:10,185
Da.

47
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,025
(rattling)

48
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:22,988
Hello?

49
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,036
Uh, Bucharest, the
American Embassy, please.

50
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:28,955
Uh...

51
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,082
(speaks Romanian)

52
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:51,643
(shutter clicks)

53
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,173
Lieutenant?

54
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:24,013
Yeah?

55
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:38,816
(speaks Romanian)

56
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,661
What's the story, Lieutenant?

57
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:19,773
What about Michelle?

58
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:24,401
Sorry miss, no sister.

59
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:28,490
No Radu, no little witch.

60
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:32,075
She's in there somewhere, she has to be.

61
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:34,370
Please miss, tell me again

62
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:36,288
what's happening here.

63
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,791
Who killed Popescu?

64
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:43,461
Becca, we want to believe you.

65
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:45,756
They're vampires, Mel.

66
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:47,593
Vampires, Marin.

67
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,721
Or something worse.

68
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,681
Marin, can I talk to you for a moment?

69
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:55,808
Yes.

70
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,103
Excuse me, miss.

71
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:04,235
(speaks Romanian)

72
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,798
(eerie music)

73
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:43,940
(gasps)

74
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:47,298
(cackling)

75
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,083
(gasps)

76
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:15,346
(sobs)
Oh, no!

77
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,891
I'm sorry.

78
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:20,935
I'm sorry, please.

79
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:22,978
(whimpers) No!

80
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,065
Don't hurt me.

81
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:29,401
We're together now,

82
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:31,653
pretty one.

83
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:34,073
(zap)

84
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:39,075
Mortals have defiled my sanctuary.

85
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:41,706
We must fly.

86
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:49,648
(overlapping chanting)

87
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,793
(screams)

88
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:18,160
(yelps)

89
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:47,315
(groaning, yelling, cackling)

90
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:50,901
Rebecca!

91
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:06,748
I'm sorry.

92
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,418
Okay, there's definitely
something weird going on here.

93
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,378
Some kind of explosion, yeah?

94
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,380
No!

95
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:14,465
It was them leaving.

96
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:18,345
I could hear Michelle screaming in there.

97
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:27,731
(screaming, cackling)

98
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,065
(thud)

99
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,035
Our sanctuary.

100
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:45,873
Returned to us at last.

101
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:16,778
Call me when you wake up.

102
00:15:17,738 --> 00:15:19,115
I'll come get you.

103
00:15:20,156 --> 00:15:22,575
Would you stay with me tonight?

104
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:24,868
I don't want to be alone.

105
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,911
Yeah.

106
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:27,706
Sure.

107
00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:44,641
(eerie music)

108
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:49,643
From this night forward

109
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:51,895
we shall be as one.

110
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:55,358
All that is mine will be yours.

111
00:16:07,746 --> 00:16:10,748
Kneel before your master.

112
00:16:25,346 --> 00:16:26,596
Let me out of here.

113
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:29,308
I will let you out.

114
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,270
I might even set you free.

115
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:35,900
When you're ready.

116
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:39,153
You promised you would
teach me everything.

117
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:51,415
First you must learn patience.

118
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:58,046
We have all the time in the world.

119
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,303
(ghostly breathing)

120
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:39,776
(snarls)

121
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:55,395
(singing)

122
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,018
(screams)

123
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:11,321
(chuckling)

124
00:18:12,663 --> 00:18:14,830
Some day child,

125
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:18,125
when Radu tires of you

126
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:21,461
you'll belong to me.

127
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:25,006
Then you'll know horror.

128
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:28,186
(giggles)

129
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:39,356
(whimpering)

130
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,788
(moaning)

131
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,911
(cackling)

132
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:12,998
(slurping)

133
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,801
(sobbing)

134
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:32,676
(screams)

135
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:32,068
(sobbing)

136
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,280
My Nikolai...

137
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:41,328
I'm sorry.

138
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,621
My condolences, ma'am.

139
00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:46,708
He was a fine scholar, and uh,

140
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,001
a delightful gentleman.

141
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:53,340
He was a crazy old fool.

142
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:58,341
(sobs) Such a stupid way to die!

143
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:01,473
Ma'am, last time we were here I...

144
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:03,350
I left some papers in his office.

145
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:04,810
I was wondering-

146
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:06,770
- Yes, go ahead.

147
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:10,025
But please don't disturb anything.

148
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:33,798
(clattering)

149
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:26,225
This is Lieutenant Marin,

150
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:28,143
Police of Dublin.

151
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:30,895
Where is the gate, please?

152
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:32,481
How do we get inside?

153
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:51,833
(speaks Romanian)

154
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:39,298
Hello!

155
00:24:43,303 --> 00:24:44,805
For Christ's sake.

156
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:50,725
Should we drop the stakes or what?

157
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:53,936
Uh, no, just um...

158
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:55,190
Act natural.

159
00:25:01,738 --> 00:25:02,905
Buna ziua, my friend.

160
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:05,116
Marin.

161
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,783
I'm glad to see you're finally

162
00:25:07,785 --> 00:25:09,535
taking me seriously, Lieutenant.

163
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:11,245
It's very serious.

164
00:25:11,246 --> 00:25:12,206
Murder.

165
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:16,793
And now, uh, why are you here?

166
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:18,920
To see if Marin is doing duty?

167
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:22,048
Uh no, we're just, uh...

168
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,300
Looking around.

169
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:26,720
(speaks Romanian)

170
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:28,431
Look, come here.

171
00:25:29,598 --> 00:25:31,391
Empty graves,

172
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:33,351
missing persons,

173
00:25:33,353 --> 00:25:35,311
dead Popescu.

174
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:37,855
This case making me crazy!

175
00:25:37,856 --> 00:25:39,941
Have you gotten into the
castle yet, Lieutenant?

176
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:41,901
No, no, it's no one to open gate.

177
00:25:41,903 --> 00:25:44,780
No, we need written permission to enter.

178
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:46,365
- Permission?
- [Marin] Yeah.

179
00:25:46,366 --> 00:25:47,323
From whom?

180
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:49,075
Oh, the keeper of antiquities.

181
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:50,826
How long is that gonna take?

182
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:52,078
Two weeks.

183
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,705
Maybe two months.

184
00:25:53,706 --> 00:25:55,040
We can't wait that long!

185
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,375
God knows what could happen by then.

186
00:25:56,376 --> 00:25:57,958
Now listen!

187
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,878
Listen to me, miss.

188
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,215
I wish this case to be
solved as much as you!

189
00:26:03,216 --> 00:26:05,633
Calm down, Marin.

190
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:07,801
I'm calm, but...

191
00:26:07,803 --> 00:26:10,930
I told big boss your vampire story.

192
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:12,765
You know what's happening?

193
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:14,016
What?

194
00:26:14,018 --> 00:26:17,186
He scream at me for half hour.

195
00:26:17,188 --> 00:26:20,731
Now I am big trouble thank you to you!

196
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:21,858
Yeah well...

197
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,235
The trouble is just beginning, Marin.

198
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:26,153
Department of Police is not believing

199
00:26:26,155 --> 00:26:28,281
in the vampires.

200
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:30,825
What are you doing here Lieutenant?

201
00:26:30,826 --> 00:26:32,743
What is your theory?

202
00:26:32,745 --> 00:26:36,205
Your sister is mixed up in black magics.

203
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:39,500
Antiques stolen from graves.

204
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:42,211
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

205
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:43,340
Please.

206
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:49,345
- Thanks, Marin.
- [Marin] It's alright.

207
00:26:51,388 --> 00:26:53,640
(speaks Romanian)

208
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:55,766
[Mel] Becca!

209
00:26:55,768 --> 00:26:56,811
Becca.

210
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:03,318
Hey!

211
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,111
You know, you really shouldn't

212
00:27:07,113 --> 00:27:11,240
try so hard to piss people off.

213
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:12,408
I'm sorry Mel,

214
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,286
but with him it just comes so naturally.

215
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:18,248
Hey, I told you:

216
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,458
he's not the smartest guy in town,

217
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,806
but he can be a good ally.

218
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,588
(sighs)

219
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,381
Come on.

220
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:44,358
Here.

221
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,780
I can't believe I'm doing this.

222
00:27:50,365 --> 00:27:52,200
Hey, wait!

223
00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:59,413
Uh-huh.

224
00:27:59,415 --> 00:28:01,290
My friends...

225
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:02,625
What's happening?

226
00:28:02,626 --> 00:28:04,543
This is Popescu's secret way in.

227
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:07,671
It's not enough I am
in big trouble, huh?

228
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:10,801
You want me to be fired, too?

229
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:16,725
Okay.

230
00:28:19,143 --> 00:28:20,643
Okay.

231
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:21,520
Go on.

232
00:28:21,521 --> 00:28:22,936
Okay, go on!

233
00:28:22,938 --> 00:28:25,775
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

234
00:28:47,588 --> 00:28:50,553
(ominous music)

235
00:29:11,863 --> 00:29:12,863
[Mel] Oh no...

236
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:16,490
It's blocked.

237
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:18,868
They've blocked the passageway.

238
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,305
[Marin] You are sure?

239
00:29:20,306 --> 00:29:22,288
You are sure this is correct way?

240
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,248
[Mel] Yes, Marin.

241
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,125
It wasn't like this before.

242
00:29:25,126 --> 00:29:29,255
[Rebecca] Obviously
they were expecting us.

243
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:52,151
Tomorrow morning.

244
00:29:52,153 --> 00:29:53,820
Come talk to big boss.

245
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:55,780
Speak for yourself, yeah?
Yes.

246
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:56,865
We'll do that, Marin.

247
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:58,618
Can't wait to meet him, Lieutenant.

248
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:13,771
(dramatic orchestral music)

249
00:30:33,986 --> 00:30:35,363
Wait, Rebecca!

250
00:30:37,615 --> 00:30:40,075
Look, it's getting late.

251
00:30:40,076 --> 00:30:41,993
We should get out of here before dark.

252
00:30:41,995 --> 00:30:43,076
Okay.

253
00:30:43,078 --> 00:30:45,081
I just want to watch the
place for a little while.

254
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,638
They're in there.

255
00:31:05,768 --> 00:31:08,226
Don't let them see us!

256
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:09,980
Jesus...

257
00:31:10,898 --> 00:31:12,273
We're not safe here.

258
00:31:12,275 --> 00:31:13,900
Come on, let's go.

259
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:15,860
Come on, we can't do anything
'til daylight anyway.

260
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:16,905
Come on!

261
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:28,251
(doors click)

262
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,623
[Rebecca] Go, go!

263
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:32,768
(engine turns over, revs)

264
00:31:38,258 --> 00:31:39,593
What are you doing? Just go!

265
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:55,358
They dare to challenge us?

266
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,028
Your sister is a foolish one!

267
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,698
Leave her alone.

268
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:13,043
I'll do anything.

269
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:19,420
Sever the ties to your
mortality, Michelle.

270
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:23,301
All your pain will turn to pleasure.

271
00:32:23,303 --> 00:32:25,011
She's my sister.

272
00:32:25,013 --> 00:32:26,890
I love her.

273
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:31,311
There's no love between
the living and the dead.

274
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:36,565
What you feel is hunger.

275
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:38,528
Hunger for life.

276
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:45,116
Kneel before your master.

277
00:32:45,118 --> 00:32:47,203
You promised to teach me.

278
00:32:50,206 --> 00:32:52,875
Destroy her, Radu!

279
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:58,213
She curses you in her heart.

280
00:33:08,808 --> 00:33:12,978
I shall grant you all I promised...

281
00:33:14,188 --> 00:33:18,315
When you prove yourself worthy.

282
00:33:18,316 --> 00:33:21,375
(jazzy party music)

283
00:35:27,571 --> 00:35:29,323
What's it say?

284
00:35:30,073 --> 00:35:33,491
Man, this is some wild stuff.

285
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:35,911
According to this legend, the castle

286
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:39,248
was originally owned by
this family of sorcerers,

287
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,416
until this Vladislas guy

288
00:35:41,418 --> 00:35:43,671
came along and seduced the daughter...

289
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:46,380
Cerise.

290
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:48,841
She gave birth to the monstrous Radu,

291
00:35:48,843 --> 00:35:51,551
and then apparently...

292
00:35:51,553 --> 00:35:54,388
Vladislas murdered most of the family off,

293
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,390
drove the rest of them from the region,

294
00:35:56,391 --> 00:35:59,476
and claimed the castle as his own.

295
00:35:59,478 --> 00:36:03,898
This Vladislas sounds
like a ruthless character.

296
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,775
No...

297
00:36:05,776 --> 00:36:09,403
Apparently he was the good guy.

298
00:36:09,405 --> 00:36:10,698
(chuckles)

299
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:39,565
(eerie whispering)

300
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,451
(cackling)

301
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:57,425
(screaming)

302
00:36:57,426 --> 00:36:59,663
Michelle, please!

303
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,251
What's wrong?

304
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:07,670
I can't.

305
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:09,380
I can't.
Okay.

306
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:11,923
(panting)
It's just...

307
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:13,301
It's just too much right now.

308
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,178
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

309
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,806
I'm sorry too.

310
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:24,416
(owl hoots)

311
00:37:27,983 --> 00:37:28,985
What is it?

312
00:37:34,323 --> 00:37:36,866
Reach out with your senses.

313
00:37:48,586 --> 00:37:51,965
The violinist is a disgrace.

314
00:37:56,345 --> 00:37:58,678
Teach me to fly.

315
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,766
As you do.
Patience, pretty one.

316
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,271
Before the mysteries, you must...

317
00:38:07,523 --> 00:38:10,065
Learn to survive,

318
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:11,776
to hunt...

319
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:16,613
To move with stealth.

320
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:19,118
(ghostly breathing)

321
00:38:25,331 --> 00:38:27,041
Vex your inner powers.

322
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:31,630
(mystic zap)

323
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:40,000
You are a magnificent creature.

324
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:42,781
(upbeat music)

325
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,323
(eerie music)

326
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,741
(hissing)

327
00:39:31,981 --> 00:39:35,523
(mysterious, suspenseful music)

328
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,950
(speaks Romanian)

329
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:02,011
Take him!

330
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,640
(intense music)

331
00:40:20,196 --> 00:40:22,075
(screams)

332
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,796
(speaks Romanian)

333
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:48,571
(screams)

334
00:40:52,771 --> 00:40:53,938
What? What is it?

335
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,231
I heard a scream.

336
00:40:57,943 --> 00:41:00,401
Oh, it must've just come from the tavern.

337
00:41:00,403 --> 00:41:03,363
(engine turns over)

338
00:41:03,365 --> 00:41:04,531
Hey,

339
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:06,658
there's your friend Lieutenant Marin.

340
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,118
No!

341
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,163
Yeah.

342
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:13,665
I'll be darned.

343
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,376
He's spying on us.

344
00:42:03,425 --> 00:42:05,093
We must go now.

345
00:42:07,638 --> 00:42:09,471
The sun has come.

346
00:42:09,473 --> 00:42:11,223
Wait.

347
00:42:11,225 --> 00:42:12,685
I want to see the dawn.

348
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:18,190
We will wait.

349
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:21,735
Until the pain begins.

350
00:42:23,778 --> 00:42:25,780
Is it true?

351
00:42:25,781 --> 00:42:27,658
That the sunlight can kill us?

352
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:31,536
Yes.

353
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:36,375
What else?

354
00:42:38,626 --> 00:42:40,586
What else can kill a vampire?

355
00:42:48,803 --> 00:42:50,180
Many things.

356
00:42:56,936 --> 00:42:59,480
Kill me, Radu.

357
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:01,856
You've destroyed me.

358
00:43:01,858 --> 00:43:04,193
Some day...

359
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:08,031
The sadness you feel
will be a sweet memory.

360
00:43:11,493 --> 00:43:13,286
I can't bear this any longer.

361
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,081
I love you, Michelle.

362
00:43:19,085 --> 00:43:21,836
I shall love you until the end of time.

363
00:43:25,131 --> 00:43:26,841
I offer you...

364
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,096
My most precious gift.

365
00:43:48,571 --> 00:43:51,090
(orchestral music)

366
00:44:06,465 --> 00:44:08,425
I hate you.

367
00:44:10,468 --> 00:44:13,055
I'll hate you for all eternity.

368
00:44:16,475 --> 00:44:17,976
We must go now.

369
00:44:20,228 --> 00:44:22,940
Our powers will weaken with the light.

370
00:44:36,411 --> 00:44:38,955
(speaking Romanian)

371
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:49,590
You're gonna like this guy.

372
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,801
He's CIA, but he's totally cool.

373
00:44:53,636 --> 00:44:57,511
(speaking Romanian)

374
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:09,318
Bob?

375
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,526
Hey, it's Mel.

376
00:45:10,528 --> 00:45:11,736
Put up your tape recorder, buddy.

377
00:45:11,738 --> 00:45:13,198
I've got a favor to ask.

378
00:45:14,115 --> 00:45:16,075
Totally off the record.

379
00:45:16,076 --> 00:45:18,848
(speaking Romanian)

380
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,085
Good morning, miss.

381
00:45:27,086 --> 00:45:28,211
What's going on here?

382
00:45:28,213 --> 00:45:29,296
Good morning, Marin.

383
00:45:29,298 --> 00:45:31,423
Truthfully, it's a bad morning.

384
00:45:31,425 --> 00:45:34,301
Two peoples gone from village last night.

385
00:45:34,303 --> 00:45:37,178
A violin boy from
cantina, a woman from car.

386
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,388
- Gone?
- [Marin] Yeah.

387
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,473
Like how?

388
00:45:39,475 --> 00:45:42,350
Oh, like poof!

389
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:44,185
Disappearing.

390
00:45:44,186 --> 00:45:48,940
Now everybody in village talking crazy.

391
00:45:48,941 --> 00:45:51,341
(yelling in Romanian)

392
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:56,200
What's she saying?

393
00:45:57,618 --> 00:46:00,118
That we shouldn't
have gone to the castle.

394
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,370
That we reawakened...

395
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:03,371
Something.

396
00:46:03,373 --> 00:46:07,416
Stre-
(speaks Romanian)

397
00:46:07,418 --> 00:46:08,835
Vampires!

398
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:10,628
Do you believe me now, Lieutenant?

399
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,715
No, no, no I don't believe.

400
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:16,051
It's a black magic, this violin boy.

401
00:46:16,053 --> 00:46:18,595
He's no good, he's no
good violining for sure.

402
00:46:18,596 --> 00:46:21,141
You are hopeless, Lieutenant.

403
00:46:22,308 --> 00:46:23,100
Come on, Mel.

404
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:24,393
Right.

405
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:25,685
Save it, Marin.

406
00:46:25,686 --> 00:46:26,895
Miss!

407
00:46:26,896 --> 00:46:30,290
(people yelling)

408
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:53,023
(soft music)

409
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:02,471
[Mel] Okay.

410
00:47:02,473 --> 00:47:03,890
Bob won't be here 'til about noon.

411
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:06,270
That gives us some time to look around.

412
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:29,208
Come on.

413
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,631
(grunts)

414
00:47:38,593 --> 00:47:39,801
Jesus, Marin.

415
00:47:39,803 --> 00:47:41,470
Don't worry.

416
00:47:41,471 --> 00:47:43,305
I'm only me.

417
00:47:43,306 --> 00:47:44,725
What's happening?

418
00:47:45,975 --> 00:47:48,060
Just exploring, Marin.

419
00:47:48,061 --> 00:47:48,976
Ah.

420
00:47:48,978 --> 00:47:51,271
Looking for vampire, eh?

421
00:47:51,273 --> 00:47:53,106
Oh, Americans.

422
00:47:53,108 --> 00:47:54,816
Crazy people.

423
00:47:54,818 --> 00:47:55,776
Vampires.

424
00:47:57,361 --> 00:47:59,696
It's very nice up here.

425
00:47:59,698 --> 00:48:02,281
Maybe I stay here today.

426
00:48:02,283 --> 00:48:03,575
With you.

427
00:48:03,576 --> 00:48:05,160
Huh?

428
00:48:05,161 --> 00:48:07,161
Suit yourself, Marin.

429
00:48:07,163 --> 00:48:09,498
Just don't be surprised at what you see.

430
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,081
(suspenseful music)

431
00:48:32,605 --> 00:48:33,646
Hey bud.

432
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:35,856
Jesus Bob! Hey, Marin!

433
00:48:35,858 --> 00:48:37,860
It's okay, he's a friend.

434
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:38,943
Everybody cool here?

435
00:48:38,945 --> 00:48:40,570
[Mel] Yeah.

436
00:48:40,571 --> 00:48:41,988
Bob, this is Rebecca.

437
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:43,573
Rebecca, this is my friend Bob.

438
00:48:43,575 --> 00:48:44,950
Hi Bob.

439
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:46,076
Nice to meet you.

440
00:48:46,078 --> 00:48:47,076
Ma'am.

441
00:48:47,078 --> 00:48:48,870
And Lieutenant Marin,

442
00:48:48,871 --> 00:48:49,913
Bucharest Police.

443
00:48:49,915 --> 00:48:51,038
I know.

444
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,248
Sir.

445
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,291
Hello. CIA Bob, eh?

446
00:48:54,293 --> 00:48:56,295
I thought you were a smuggler at first.

447
00:48:56,296 --> 00:48:58,338
- No sir.
- [Marin] Okay.

448
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,631
What's the target here?

449
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:01,968
We gotta get inside.

450
00:49:03,095 --> 00:49:04,513
You think we can make it up this wall?

451
00:49:05,971 --> 00:49:07,596
Give it a shot.

452
00:49:07,598 --> 00:49:08,640
Good.

453
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:11,186
Uh, you got the stuff?

454
00:49:18,068 --> 00:49:20,318
Weird shopping list, buddy.

455
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,613
What are we, vampire hunting?

456
00:49:29,411 --> 00:49:31,956
Your show man, I'm just doing a cameo.

457
00:49:35,001 --> 00:49:37,085
(rustling)

458
00:49:37,086 --> 00:49:39,003
This body bag light tight?

459
00:49:39,005 --> 00:49:40,630
100% opaque.

460
00:49:40,631 --> 00:49:42,715
Whoa, whoa, whoa Lieutenant.

461
00:49:42,716 --> 00:49:44,258
Night viewing device.

462
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,178
Don't want to mess with it in daylight.

463
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,390
You're gonna love this.

464
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,893
Silver bullets, melted down from my

465
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:55,645
neighbor's antique crucifix.

466
00:49:55,646 --> 00:49:57,771
You owe her 500 bucks, pal.

467
00:49:57,773 --> 00:49:59,065
500 bucks?

468
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:00,818
She started out asking $750.

469
00:50:03,655 --> 00:50:05,030
Nice work, Bob.

470
00:50:05,031 --> 00:50:07,406
Hey man, it's my pleasure.

471
00:50:07,408 --> 00:50:09,701
This makes six rounds each.

472
00:50:09,703 --> 00:50:12,120
That's if we're all participating.

473
00:50:12,121 --> 00:50:13,246
Ma'am,

474
00:50:13,248 --> 00:50:15,206
you know how to use it?

475
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:16,375
Yeah.

476
00:50:16,376 --> 00:50:18,420
I think I can handle it.
No, no, no.

477
00:50:20,671 --> 00:50:21,881
Are you with us, Marin?

478
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:25,425
Okay.

479
00:50:25,426 --> 00:50:27,888
But don't tell big boss, okay?

480
00:50:28,805 --> 00:50:29,846
Ma'am.

481
00:50:29,848 --> 00:50:31,723
Rebecca.

482
00:50:31,725 --> 00:50:32,683
Yes ma'am.

483
00:50:44,195 --> 00:50:45,820
What are you doing?

484
00:50:45,821 --> 00:50:47,196
Going up.

485
00:50:47,198 --> 00:50:49,325
Bob and I were old rock climbing buddies.

486
00:50:50,076 --> 00:50:51,328
Are you a climber?

487
00:50:52,871 --> 00:50:53,913
Nuh-uh.

488
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,918
We'll find a way to get you in.

489
00:51:00,003 --> 00:51:01,711
Be careful.

490
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:02,586
Don't worry.

491
00:51:02,588 --> 00:51:06,598
(soft orchestral music)

492
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:15,725
Think we can make it?

493
00:51:15,726 --> 00:51:16,811
No problem.

494
00:51:24,778 --> 00:51:29,778
(suspenseful music)

495
00:51:56,268 --> 00:51:58,268
Your turn, man.

496
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:59,605
You can do that?

497
00:52:00,605 --> 00:52:01,523
No.

498
00:52:02,565 --> 00:52:04,025
That's why I climb with him.

499
00:52:07,695 --> 00:52:08,863
Good luck.

500
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:42,646
(grunting)

501
00:52:57,328 --> 00:52:59,495
Thanks, man.

502
00:52:59,496 --> 00:53:00,248
You ready?

503
00:53:30,653 --> 00:53:32,570
Jesus.

504
00:53:32,571 --> 00:53:34,030
Good climbing, man.

505
00:53:34,031 --> 00:53:35,531
We're in.
(static)

506
00:53:35,533 --> 00:53:37,491
We're gonna go offline now.

507
00:53:37,493 --> 00:53:39,576
Unless you have an
emergency don't call us.

508
00:53:39,578 --> 00:53:41,036
We'll call you.

509
00:53:41,038 --> 00:53:42,538
No!

510
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,500
Mel!

511
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:52,758
(door creaks)

512
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,248
(screaming)

513
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:18,283
Sounds like trouble ahead.

514
00:54:18,285 --> 00:54:19,951
Female voice. We're gonna check it out.

515
00:54:19,953 --> 00:54:21,078
No.

516
00:54:22,705 --> 00:54:24,875
The witch doesn't sleep by day.

517
00:54:40,098 --> 00:54:41,390
(screaming)

518
00:54:45,436 --> 00:54:48,066
(cackling)

519
00:54:59,075 --> 00:55:00,793
(screaming)

520
00:55:00,795 --> 00:55:02,370
Heads up, granny!

521
00:55:03,663 --> 00:55:05,165
(shrieks)

522
00:55:08,376 --> 00:55:10,710
(rapid gunfire)

523
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:11,336
(thud)

524
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,013
(shrieks)

525
00:55:23,015 --> 00:55:24,016
(gunfire)

526
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:27,435
Bob?

527
00:55:27,436 --> 00:55:28,438
Come in!

528
00:55:29,438 --> 00:55:30,938
Mel, please!

529
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:33,190
Answer me!

530
00:55:40,116 --> 00:55:43,658
(cackling)

531
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,083
Hello?

532
00:55:50,085 --> 00:55:51,041
Hello?

533
00:55:51,043 --> 00:55:52,795
(speaks Romanian)

534
00:55:56,675 --> 00:55:58,760
(static)

535
00:55:59,635 --> 00:56:00,303
Hello?

536
00:56:03,013 --> 00:56:05,723
It's too much mountains for radio.

537
00:56:05,725 --> 00:56:07,225
We should go for help.

538
00:56:07,226 --> 00:56:09,018
We can't leave yet!

539
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,186
What if they got away?

540
00:56:11,188 --> 00:56:12,355
Okay.

541
00:56:12,356 --> 00:56:14,108
We wait and see.

542
00:56:44,305 --> 00:56:46,265
No matter what happens...

543
00:56:47,266 --> 00:56:48,808
Don't hurt Michelle.

544
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,060
Yes, of course.

545
00:56:50,061 --> 00:56:52,478
You understand what
I'm telling you, Marin?

546
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,521
Yes, don't hurt sister.

547
00:56:54,523 --> 00:56:55,983
Yes.

548
00:57:06,911 --> 00:57:08,911
Wait until it is most dark,

549
00:57:08,913 --> 00:57:10,915
so no one seeing me.

550
00:57:23,553 --> 00:57:24,301
(gasps)

551
00:57:24,303 --> 00:57:27,875
(eerie music)

552
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:46,700
Don't...

553
00:57:46,701 --> 00:57:48,411
Touch me.

554
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:52,706
Be kind to me...

555
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:59,670
And I shall bestow upon you...

556
00:57:59,671 --> 00:58:02,258
Priceless treasure.

557
00:58:32,955 --> 00:58:33,915
(moans)

558
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,001
(slurping, groan)

559
00:58:51,975 --> 00:58:54,018
Your blood grows bitter.

560
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,230
Soon you'll be mine.

561
00:58:59,756 --> 00:59:01,066
Completely.

562
00:59:04,986 --> 00:59:08,511
(ominous music)

563
00:59:18,585 --> 00:59:20,290
(cackling)

564
00:59:36,518 --> 00:59:38,228
The throne is mine.

565
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:44,443
My treasure!

566
00:59:48,823 --> 00:59:52,158
Give it to me.

567
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,161
At once!
No.

568
00:59:55,163 --> 00:59:57,621
You defy me?

569
00:59:57,623 --> 01:00:00,168
It belongs to the fledgling mother.

570
01:00:02,545 --> 01:00:04,588
I bestowed it upon her.

571
01:00:07,716 --> 01:00:12,345
You are forbidden my spoils!

572
01:00:12,346 --> 01:00:15,475
Lowly treasures are my birthright.

573
01:00:18,686 --> 01:00:20,686
They are mine

574
01:00:20,688 --> 01:00:22,730
alone!

575
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:24,650
Anger me not, mother.

576
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:32,990
Or there will be a bloodbath.

577
01:00:32,991 --> 01:00:36,618
She is the cause of your treachery!

578
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,580
Destroy her!

579
01:00:38,581 --> 01:00:41,875
She's my chosen disciple.

580
01:00:41,876 --> 01:00:44,876
She acts as your master.

581
01:00:44,878 --> 01:00:48,631
You are her master.

582
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:52,135
As I am yours!

583
01:00:52,136 --> 01:00:54,720
I have no master.

584
01:00:54,721 --> 01:00:57,391
She must die!

585
01:00:59,476 --> 01:01:01,061
(shrieks)

586
01:01:06,608 --> 01:01:08,570
(cracking)

587
01:01:12,198 --> 01:01:13,783
(shrieking)

588
01:01:23,876 --> 01:01:27,005
Forgive me, mother.

589
01:01:32,468 --> 01:01:33,553
(yelps)

590
01:01:45,063 --> 01:01:48,693
You dare to desecrate me?

591
01:02:01,538 --> 01:02:06,168
Curse you forever.

592
01:02:28,148 --> 01:02:29,900
Now I am alone.

593
01:02:31,776 --> 01:02:32,918
Aren't I?

594
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:37,450
Pretty one?

595
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:46,375
Let me drink from the bloodstone.

596
01:02:50,255 --> 01:02:51,923
You're not ready.

597
01:02:53,758 --> 01:02:56,218
Its power will drive you mad.

598
01:03:08,563 --> 01:03:10,065
I killed my father...

599
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:12,235
My mother...

600
01:03:13,986 --> 01:03:16,655
My entire bloodline.

601
01:03:19,616 --> 01:03:20,868
For you.

602
01:03:24,288 --> 01:03:26,706
What will you grant me in return?

603
01:03:29,543 --> 01:03:31,918
Forgiveness.

604
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,715
For what you've done to me.

605
01:03:42,306 --> 01:03:45,685
There is not enough
forgiveness in the universe...

606
01:03:47,978 --> 01:03:49,646
For all I have done.

607
01:03:55,026 --> 01:03:55,778
Ms. Morgan!

608
01:03:58,321 --> 01:03:59,535
Ms. Morgan.

609
01:04:16,131 --> 01:04:19,633
I'm from the US Embassy.

610
01:04:19,635 --> 01:04:21,885
I'm a friend of Rebecca's.

611
01:04:21,886 --> 01:04:24,971
I would very much like to help you.

612
01:04:24,973 --> 01:04:27,810
I know Rebecca would too.

613
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:29,895
(yells)

614
01:04:30,605 --> 01:04:34,315
This mortal has seen too much.

615
01:04:34,316 --> 01:04:36,233
Please sir,

616
01:04:36,235 --> 01:04:36,900
no.

617
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:40,446
Feast upon him, Michelle.

618
01:04:40,448 --> 01:04:42,031
[Mel] No!

619
01:04:42,033 --> 01:04:44,075
See the fear

620
01:04:44,076 --> 01:04:47,328
pulsing in his veins?

621
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:48,328
Drink!

622
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:49,706
No, please!

623
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:54,961
Savor the sweetness of his agony.

624
01:04:59,633 --> 01:05:02,051
Please, Ms. Morgan, don't.

625
01:05:02,053 --> 01:05:03,761
We can get you out of here.

626
01:05:03,763 --> 01:05:06,263
Drink, Michelle.

627
01:05:06,265 --> 01:05:08,681
Forget you were ever mortal.

628
01:05:08,683 --> 01:05:10,183
No, please!

629
01:05:10,185 --> 01:05:11,976
(screams) No!

630
01:05:11,978 --> 01:05:14,980
[Rebecca] Michelle, can you hear me?

631
01:05:14,981 --> 01:05:15,856
Rebecca?

632
01:05:15,858 --> 01:05:16,690
[Rebecca] Michelle?

633
01:05:16,691 --> 01:05:18,235
It's me.

634
01:05:19,986 --> 01:05:20,738
Mel?

635
01:05:22,448 --> 01:05:24,198
Can you hear me?

636
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,785
(eerie music)

637
01:05:29,746 --> 01:05:31,331
Please Michelle, answer me!

638
01:05:34,085 --> 01:05:35,961
Mel, please. Somebody!

639
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:40,048
Can anybody hear me? Please?

640
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,676
Michelle?

641
01:05:44,303 --> 01:05:45,553
Michelle, please.

642
01:05:45,555 --> 01:05:46,971
It's Becky. Please!

643
01:05:49,475 --> 01:05:51,433
Mel?

644
01:05:51,435 --> 01:05:53,353
Where are you?

645
01:05:58,066 --> 01:05:59,941
I can see you.

646
01:05:59,943 --> 01:06:03,865
If you can hear me, please answer me.

647
01:06:05,825 --> 01:06:07,450
(yells)

648
01:06:07,451 --> 01:06:08,368
(cracks)

649
01:06:13,081 --> 01:06:14,415
Michelle?

650
01:06:14,416 --> 01:06:16,293
Mel, somebody, please!

651
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,670
Please answer me.

652
01:06:19,671 --> 01:06:24,300
This mortal love you bear
is a threat to our existence.

653
01:06:24,301 --> 01:06:27,221
Please Radu, I have to speak to her.

654
01:06:28,513 --> 01:06:30,641
I'll come back, I promise.

655
01:06:48,951 --> 01:06:52,371
I'll do anything if you spare her life.

656
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:57,626
Very well.

657
01:07:00,713 --> 01:07:02,921
Your sister's life

658
01:07:02,923 --> 01:07:06,510
in return for your absolute devotion.

659
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,105
Michelle?

660
01:07:20,106 --> 01:07:23,776
(ominous music)

661
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:39,001
Michelle!

662
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:43,965
Don't come any closer, Becky.

663
01:07:45,925 --> 01:07:48,258
Come back with me, Michelle.

664
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:49,636
I can't.

665
01:07:51,305 --> 01:07:53,306
I have to stay here.

666
01:08:05,151 --> 01:08:06,236
You're so cold.

667
01:08:08,948 --> 01:08:09,946
You...

668
01:08:09,948 --> 01:08:11,366
You're dead?

669
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,930
(groans)

670
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,725
You have to go now, Becky.

671
01:09:22,604 --> 01:09:24,481
- Not without you.
- [Michelle] Please!

672
01:09:26,024 --> 01:09:28,899
Or he'll destroy you, too.

673
01:09:28,901 --> 01:09:30,486
What about my friend?

674
01:09:35,075 --> 01:09:36,910
He's Radu's prisoner.

675
01:09:38,578 --> 01:09:39,703
Please.

676
01:09:39,705 --> 01:09:42,622
Please take me to him.

677
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:45,167
Curse this sweet reunion.

678
01:09:47,587 --> 01:09:48,380
Marin?

679
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,506
He's dead.

680
01:09:55,053 --> 01:09:59,265
This gun is loaded with silver bullets.

681
01:09:59,266 --> 01:10:03,060
And I will use it if I have to.

682
01:10:03,061 --> 01:10:05,938
I want you to release my friends

683
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:09,816
and then Michelle and I are leaving,

684
01:10:09,818 --> 01:10:13,570
and you better not try and stop us.

685
01:10:13,571 --> 01:10:15,615
Do you understand?

686
01:10:21,288 --> 01:10:22,496
Perfectly.

687
01:10:22,498 --> 01:10:25,625
(ominous music)

688
01:10:32,675 --> 01:10:33,841
Becca!

689
01:10:45,228 --> 01:10:46,146
Thank God.

690
01:10:48,481 --> 01:10:50,233
Let them go.

691
01:10:54,655 --> 01:10:56,448
As you wish.

692
01:11:12,756 --> 01:11:14,298
Okay Michelle,

693
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,800
let's get out of here.

694
01:11:15,801 --> 01:11:18,386
Take them, fledgling.

695
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:22,975
Let there be a bloodbath.

696
01:11:26,353 --> 01:11:28,186
Come on, Michelle.

697
01:11:28,188 --> 01:11:29,231
We're leaving.

698
01:11:44,746 --> 01:11:46,373
Kill me, Becky.

699
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:49,626
No!

700
01:11:51,586 --> 01:11:53,630
Get out of the way, Michelle.

701
01:11:57,216 --> 01:11:59,301
Please,

702
01:11:59,303 --> 01:12:01,096
end this nightmare.

703
01:12:16,153 --> 01:12:17,945
No!

704
01:12:17,946 --> 01:12:19,156
Michelle, don't!

705
01:12:22,366 --> 01:12:24,493
No, Michelle!

706
01:12:24,495 --> 01:12:26,121
You're mine!

707
01:12:28,665 --> 01:12:30,541
(whimpering)

708
01:12:33,711 --> 01:12:34,671
(gunshot echoes)

709
01:12:35,965 --> 01:12:38,715
(groaning)

710
01:12:38,716 --> 01:12:41,053
(gunshot echoes, girl screams)

711
01:12:57,401 --> 01:12:58,925
(yelps)

712
01:13:16,921 --> 01:13:21,168
(suspenseful music)

713
01:13:40,905 --> 01:13:42,950
(groans)

714
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:44,615
What is it?

715
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:45,951
The daylight.

716
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:54,335
(screams)

717
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,795
Go!

718
01:13:58,796 --> 01:14:00,006
Go!

719
01:14:15,021 --> 01:14:15,896
(screams)

720
01:14:18,733 --> 01:14:19,858
Come on, Michelle!

721
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,901
No, I can't.

722
01:14:21,903 --> 01:14:23,155
Leave me!

723
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,375
(groaning)

724
01:14:36,751 --> 01:14:38,376
Please Becky,

725
01:14:38,378 --> 01:14:40,295
let me die.

726
01:14:40,296 --> 01:14:42,923
No Ms. Morgan, we're
gonna get you out of here.

727
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:44,131
No!

728
01:14:44,133 --> 01:14:46,345
(groans)

729
01:14:51,391 --> 01:14:52,431
[Mel] Oh God!

730
01:14:52,433 --> 01:14:55,270
(groaning)

731
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:04,821
Lift!

732
01:15:11,161 --> 01:15:12,118
Cover her!

733
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,830
Cover her please!

734
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:17,208
Cover her!

735
01:15:21,796 --> 01:15:23,090
(screams)

736
01:15:24,466 --> 01:15:28,845
The bloodstone, give it to me.

737
01:15:40,648 --> 01:15:43,443
Give it to me and I shall set you free.

738
01:15:45,486 --> 01:15:46,821
You want it?

739
01:15:49,408 --> 01:15:51,325
Go for it!

740
01:15:51,326 --> 01:15:53,078
(screams)

741
01:16:02,461 --> 01:16:05,913
(wheezing)

742
01:16:08,718 --> 01:16:10,965
(sizzling)

743
01:16:38,956 --> 01:16:41,255
(yells)

744
01:17:02,188 --> 01:17:05,713
(suspenseful music)

745
01:18:05,251 --> 01:18:07,360
(crackling)

746
01:18:29,275 --> 01:18:32,300
(static crackle)

747
01:18:32,301 --> 01:18:37,230
(dramatic music)
