1
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,750
Come on.

2
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,960
Come on, mutt.
Now, look at that ball. All right.

3
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,240
Come on. Get that ball. Ah-

4
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,960
There's no problem with that.

5
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,110
Oh, God damn it.

6
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,790
- If it happens, let me know.
- What the hell are you doing here?
This is not the office.

7
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,950
- This is my private time.
- Five minutes.

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,710
No- I said no Tuesday,
I said no last week...

9
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,560
and I'm gonna keep saying no
till you hear me.

10
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,310
Five minutes, Mr Chairman.

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,280
It's all I ask-- five minutes.

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,680
- Want some coffee?
- No, I don't want any coffee.

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,120
I want to play with my dog.

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,040
Look, I'm not asking you
to vote for it.

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,760
I know you can't.
Just release your people.

16
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,680
Let them go the way they want.

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,680
Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act-

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,120
Invasion of privacy is more like it.

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,790
You read the Post?
"This bill is not the first step
toward the surveillance society.

20
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,840
It is the surveillance society."

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,710
- Uh, liberal hysteria.
- Oh, listen.
I'm not gonna sit in Congress...

22
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,840
and pass a law
that lets the government...

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,200
point a camera and a microphone
at anything they damn well please.

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Phil, look.
I don't care who bangs who...

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,510
what cabinet officers get stoned.

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,120
But this is the richest,
most powerful nation on Earth,
and therefore the most hated.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,590
And you and I know
what the average citizen does not:

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,240
that we are at war
24 hours of every day.

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,430
Do I have to itemize the number
of American lives we've saved...

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,430
in the past 12 months alone
with judicious use
of surveillance intelligence?

32
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,120
Thomas, cut the crap.
I've got three major employers...

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,430
in the Syracuse area alone who are
gonna get just killed by this bill.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,910
I promise to get you funds
equal to or greater than...

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
whatever those companies
gave your last campaign.

36
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm not talking about
campaign contributions, damn it.

37
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm talking about my constituents
being out of work.

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,470
Jesus, man- Wake up-

39
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,840
National security isn't the only thing
going on in this country.

40
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,360
God.

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,000
This conversation is over.

42
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,710
I beg of you, Phil.
Please don't.

43
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,520
I've been there for you in the past,
haven't I? There have been times...

44
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,470
personal situations, when you needed
my assistance and my confidence.

45
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,960
Are you blackmailing me,
you ambitious shit?

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,430
I'm sorry we can't find a common ground
on this one, Congressman.

47
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,360
You're a good man.
People of your district are lucky...

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,680
to have you representing them.

49
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,870
Come on. Come on.

50
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,800
Come on.

51
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,870
Let me fight management.
Okay, I can accept that.

52
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,310
But this is our own
goddamned union leadership...

53
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,830
trying to railroad us into signing
some, some sweetheart contract.

54
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,830
Look-- Look, everybody knows...

55
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,480
that, that the mob
has been controlling these guys since,
since as long as I can remember.

56
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,830
And now, uh-- now we got Pintero's goons
down there tuning up my people.

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,360
Well, first off, that's a Hobbs Act
violation, probably a RICO.

58
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,720
- Hey.
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Thanks.

59
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,510
- How you doing?
- Great.
- All right.
- Thanks.

60
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,160
- Robert Dean.
- Tony O'Neill. Nice to meet you.

61
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,190
A Hobbs and a RICO.
Ooh, baby, don't stop.

62
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,720
Sounds like you guys need
a labor lawyer. What happened?

63
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,430
We were in Louie's two nights ago.
I go to use the bathroom...

64
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,000
and these two fucking guidos jump me.

65
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,830
Uh, I prefer we use the term
"Italian-Americans."

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,430
Eh, whatever, but they were
really going to work on me.
It could've gotten serious.

67
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,480
- But then Larry Cash came in
and he went after 'em.
- Uh, Larry Cash is in the hospital...

68
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,310
with a broken jaw
and a ruptured kidney.

69
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,920
Is this becoming
a criminal investigation, Robert?

70
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,510
Um, no, it would take years
to see that thing through.

71
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,390
Besides, these people have families
that are living through this every day.

72
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,680
Hey, Julie, can we send
a case of Chianti over to Larry Cash?

73
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,680
- Larry Cash?
- Yes, he's at St. Luke's.

74
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,830
And send some flowers to his wife,
Brenda. They're both in the Rolodex.

75
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,270
Yes, Mr Dean.

76
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,390
- Well, why don't you guys
just head on home?
- All right.

77
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,310
I'm your lawyer. I'm in the process of
dealing with these guido motherfuckers.

78
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,720
Pintero doesn't stand a chance.

79
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,600
So, how's the trout?

80
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,190
- Tastes like fish.
- It is fish.

81
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,800
No, I mean it tastes like
every other fish I've ever had.

82
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay.

83
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,680
Brill's note said that this
is the videotape that you need
to convince Pintero with.

84
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,190
And watch out for the FBI. Brill says
the place is under surveillance.

85
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,240
- So when do I get to meet him?
- Pintero?

86
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,040
Brill.

87
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,560
Never.

88
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,630
Okay. Um--

89
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,360
Wow. That's not exactly
the answer I was hoping for.

90
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,510
Oh, and what was the answer
you were hoping for?

91
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,040
Oh, I don't know. Soon.
Uh, definitely sooner than never.

92
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,190
Bobby, why do we have to
go through this every time?

93
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,150
Brill talks to me, I talk to you.
That's the way it works.

94
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,270
Well, pardon me for being
a little uncomfortable...

95
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,000
with hiring someone that I don't know
and I've never even met.

96
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,440
Then don't hire him.

97
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,600
Ten thousand dollars.

98
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,870
And I'm also a little
uncomfortable having to carry
that kind of cash around.

99
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,840
Well, this should lighten your load.

100
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,870
I don't know if it's Brill's price
that's going up or your commission.

101
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,790
I take 15%, as always.

102
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,870
Brill's fee varies with risk.

103
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,600
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
using someone else.

104
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,480
- What, other than Brill?
- Other than me.

105
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,550
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, there's nothing wrong with me.

106
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,670
Just, you know, someone
with whom you don't have
quite so complicated a history.

107
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,030
I like our history, and I like you.

108
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,600
I like you too.

109
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,030
Look, I-I just want to make sure that
I'm not breaking the law in any way.

110
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,320
- You're not.
- And how can I be so sure?

111
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,080
Because I wouldn't let you.

112
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:49,080
So, Mr Pintero, the guy on the left is
Carl Matthews, president of Local 6650.

113
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,870
And this is Dave Early,
secretary-treasurer of the National.

114
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,670
Oh, right there, you see--
you see the guy there?

115
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,510
Uh, that's Hugh Simic.
He administers the pension fund.

116
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,600
Hey, you're going to recognize
this fellow right here.

117
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,080
That's you.
Am I correct, Mr Pintero?

118
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,120
That ain't me.

119
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,320
Let's watch a little more of this.

120
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,360
- Take a-- Take a picture of this.
- Everybody say "money."

121
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,550
Here comes a great shot right here.

122
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,750
Wait. Everybody say "not guilty."

123
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,790
Right here; here it comes.

124
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,390
- That's not you?
- That ain't me.

125
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,390
Well, you know, that-that's actually
really great news for me.

126
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,150
It lifts a huge weight
off of my shoulders.

127
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,150
Because, you know, the conditions of
your parole specifically forbid you...

128
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,200
from having any contact of any kind
with any union officials.

129
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,790
- I know that.
- Well, I'm-- I'm saying,
so hypothetically...

130
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,320
had that been you, I mean,
you'd be headed back to prison for...

131
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,150
15-- I don't know--
maybe 20 years-- even more.

132
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,750
But, you know, I mean, that ain't you,
as you so eloquently put it.

133
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,030
Are you fucking with me?
Eloquently? That's not me.

134
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,030
Oh, that's not you. Well, I'm sorry
that I've wasted your time, gentlemen...

135
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,910
you know, since
that's not you, um--

136
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,240
Oh, you know what? I'm thinking.
Maybe I'll just, you know...

137
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,960
run this tape past
the federal prosecutor.

138
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,150
You know, they have
really great VCRs down there.

139
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,790
A lot of times, they can see
some things that we can't see.

140
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,510
You ain't running this by nobody.

141
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,670
- What do you want?
- My clients want to vote
their contract up or down...

142
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,000
as they see fit, without,
shall we say, any outside influences.

143
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,910
Okay. Sit down.

144
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,480
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- No, you are not fine.

145
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,200
Now sit your ass down.

146
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,510
I would like my clients to be able
to exercise their constitutional rights.

147
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,440
And if that happens,
that tape will disappear forever
into my private collection...

148
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,750
along with the Zapruder film
and the porno from Hitler's bunker.

149
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,080
- Do you got any copies of this thing?
- Absolutely.

150
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,320
Who made it? You make it?

151
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm an attorney.
I don't make videotapes.

152
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,000
Now you listen to me,
you fucking eggplant.

153
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,080
This fucking videotape
may save your clients' asses...

154
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,030
but you can be goddamned sure
it ain't gonna save yours.

155
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,550
Now, who made
the fucking videotape?

156
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,790
- I don't know.
- How'd you get it?

157
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,120
Through an acquaintance.

158
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,270
Mr Dean, he's got acquaintances.
Me, I got friends. I don't know.

159
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,670
Vic, get outside. See if they're
any acquaintances out there...

160
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,910
that are of the black persuasion.

161
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,960
Carlos, why don't you
get out of that chair?

162
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,080
Talk to Mr Dean.

163
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,600
Who's your fucking acquaintance?

164
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,960
Listen to me. I wanna know
who made that videotape...

165
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,550
but I wanna know in a week...

166
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,120
or I'll kill ya.

167
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,790
Hey, smile.

168
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,270
- What?
- Smile for the FBI.

169
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,840
- Who's the brother?
- I don't know, but he doesn't
look Italian to me, does he?

170
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,360
Table Harvest to 101.
We got a blue overcoat heading east.

171
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,200
Give me a loose one.
See if we can get his plates.

172
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,030
I'm standing by live at the
Lockraven Reservoir right now...

173
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,910
where police and fire officials
are in the process of removing...

174
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,630
a classic Mercedes owned
by Republican Congressman...

175
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,440
Phillip Hamersly
of Syracuse, New York.

176
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,870
This accident comes
at a very untimely juncture...

177
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:02,080
since the congressman was
working on a controversial
piece of legislation, Dale...

178
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,440
opposing the Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act.

179
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,630
Fire officials do tell me
that it appears the congressman...

180
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,670
was by himself in the car.

181
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,080
We have confirmed that.
However, strangely enough...

182
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,390
his favorite dog, Bob,
is currently with police.

183
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,200
I understand there was
a history of heart problems.

184
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,320
There was, in fact,
a history of heart problems.

185
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,790
In fact, the congressman
endured open-heart surgery
just a couple of years ago.

186
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,080
Homicide investigators have told me they
did find a bottle of pills in his lap.

187
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,240
That might mean that the congressman--
and I speculate here--

188
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,120
may have suffered a heart attack before
going into the Lockraven Reservoir.

189
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,440
He leaves behind a family of four.

190
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,480
We'll have more details
as the story develops.

191
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,480
I need a 10-27 on a...

192
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:17,080
brown and tan '75 GMC Jimmy.

193
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,790
D.C. tags. Eight, kilo...

194
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,320
six, three, nine, four.

195
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,550
And a 10-28 on the registered owner.

196
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,790
Jake, please do not give me
optimistic numbers. I hate optimism.

197
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,390
- Sir?
- I want to know how many votes
we have in the bank...

198
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,440
aren't gonna change their mind
every time the wind blows.

199
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,080
Thank you.

200
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,670
We may have a problem
out at the lake.

201
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,000
This is Daniel Zavitz.
He's a nature photographer
who was in government grants.

202
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,600
One of them is for monitoring
migratory patterns of Canadian geese.

203
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,670
Or lack thereof.

204
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,390
The box is called a hide.
It contains a motion-activated...

205
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,790
digital video camera
with a compound lens.

206
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,390
It was aimed directly
at the boat ramp across the lake.

207
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,120
We need two techs with full electronic
capabilities-- two humpty-dumpties.

208
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,390
Get Fiedler to organize it,
and call Kramer...

209
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,240
to get us some ex-military cutouts.

210
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,870
How do I describe the project?

211
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:46,150
Call it a training op hosted here.
Set up a link with the NRO.

212
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,630
- That's good.
- Falsify FBI approval.

213
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,790
And none of this goes beyond our team.
And get that videotape.

214
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,910
- Of course.
- Get a wire on our bird-watcher.

215
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,390
You got it.

216
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,790
Fiedler, it's Hicks. I need
an intercept on a Daniel Leon Zavitz.

217
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,000
202-555-0108.

218
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,480
And, uh, what's our authorization?

219
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,960
We're calling it a P-1 training op.
FBI approval.

220
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,590
Krug and Jones, sir.

221
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,880
We were with the 22nd Marine
expeditionary unit. Kramer sent us.

222
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,510
- Oh, nice haircut.
- Thirty months in
a federal penitentiary...

223
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,720
at Marion, Illinois, for a GVH-1--
on your gunnery sergeant--
what's that about?

224
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,400
The guy was an asshole, sir,
and he deserved it, if you'll excuse me.

225
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,070
All new, designed for today.

226
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,200
The electric car is here.

227
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,880
A sedan for you.

228
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm standing by live
at the Lockraven Reservoir...

229
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,070
right now, where police
and fire officials are
in the process of removing...

230
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,000
a classic Mercedes owned by
Republican congressman Phillip Hamersly.

231
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,720
You may be able to see it here,
being removed in the background.

232
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,440
Now, fire and police officials
aren't saying much at this point.

233
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,480
Here's what I do know.
I have been told that the congressman...

234
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,880
was alone in the vehicle
when this accident happened
just under an hour ago.

235
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,790
You may know that the congressman
suffers from a heart condition.

236
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,790
Homicide investigators
have told me that they did find
a bottle of pills in his lap.

237
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,110
That might mean that the congressman--
and I speculate here--

238
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,310
may have suffered a heart attack before
going into the Lockraven Reservoir.

239
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,590
I am also told that there was no one
in the car with him at the time of the--

240
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,790
- Fuck a duck.
- However, curiously enough,
the congressman's dog Bob--

241
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,070
Holy shit-

242
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,480
...on the ground,
and is currently with police.

243
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
He's from Syracuse, New York.

244
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:38,110
The congressman was a key opponent
to the Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act.

245
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,680
- News desk.
- Lenny...

246
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,000
you are not going to believe
what I have in my possession.

247
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,720
- Zavitz. Long time.
- Lenny, I've got...

248
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,790
the Phil Hamersly murder on videotape.

249
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,160
Phil Hamersly died
of a heart attack.

250
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,400
Negative. Hamersly was professionally
wasted under the direction...

251
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,920
of some anal-retentive with what looks
like a serious vitamin D deficiency.

252
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,350
- Well, how did you get this tape?
- My conservation study at the
lake photographed the murder.

253
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,880
- You're kidding me-
- The camera was aimed
straight across at the pier...

254
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,880
right where Phil Hamersly was killed.

255
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,880
- How fast can you get
that tape over here?
- I'm making a copy right now.

256
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,440
Uh, Mark, I have to take this.

257
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,160
Good. Thank you.
Call if you need anything.

258
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,030
- Fiedler, is this line secure?
- Yes, it is, sir.
- Go ahead.

259
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,110
Zavitz is speaking
to a Lenny Bloom...

260
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,240
a former anti-war activist.

261
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,310
He publishes a variety
of left-wing newsletters
on various political subjects.

262
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,200
- He's taking the tape now
to Bloom's offices. Over.
- Put a tap on Bloom.

263
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,240
- And give us a dedicated
satellite for this operation.
- It's already done.

264
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,880
Yeah, so, Julie, I'm gonna take
the rest of the day.

265
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,550
Uh, finish up my Christmas shopping.
Take my mind off things.

266
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,270
Hey, do chicks dig lingerie?

267
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,400
All right.
I'll see you in the morning.

268
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,310
- Hi.
- Hi.

269
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,310
How you doing?

270
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,550
Why, hello.

271
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,920
- Hi.
- Hey, hi.
- Can I help you?

272
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,510
- Uh, yes.
- Do you see something you like?

273
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,920
- Uh, I'm married.
- That's allowed.

274
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,270
Uh-- Uh, um, I just--
I need-- I need some...

275
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,750
uh, a-- a Christmas present.

276
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,000
- For your wife ?
- Yes, of-of several years.
We're ver-- We're, uh, yes.

277
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,110
- So you want some
lingerie for your wife?
- Yes, yes, I-I would.

278
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,400
Do you like Christian Dior?

279
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:38,110
You know, I have to be really
honest with you. Um, I'm not
really experienced in this.

280
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,830
- I don't--
- Get out of town-

281
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,680
I-I mean, don't get me wrong. I mean,
I'm-I'm experienced, you know, from--

282
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,240
- Yeah.
- from a certain perspective.
- Right.
- I-I just--

283
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,000
You know, I don't want to come in here
and, you know, look stupid.

284
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,000
Too late.

285
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,590
- Yeah. What size?
- I'm sorry?

286
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,440
- Oh, my wife. Oh.
- Yeah.
- Uh, she-she's, um--

287
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,000
- She's about, uh-- She--
- Size six.

288
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,310
Yeah, right, she's, uh--
She's ab-- She's a six.

289
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Right. And what about cup size?

290
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,790
Um--

291
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,400
Oh- Oh, she's way bigger than that.

292
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,440
I mean, uh, not--
I mean, not noticeably.

293
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,790
- Oops.
- Should have gotten her a watch.

294
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,270
- So far--
- Hello?

295
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,790
- It's me, Ruthie.
- Shit.
- Uh, they disconnected my phone again.

296
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,640
Uh, mine's not working either.
I think it's a problem with the line.

297
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,550
Um--

298
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,310
Let me borrow some change
for the pay phone, man.

299
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,070
Come on. I gotta call Dr Mike.

300
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,920
Danny-

301
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,310
Danny, I always pay you back.
Come on-

302
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,590
Danny-

303
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,440
Open the door-

304
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,590
Shit. Fuck.

305
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,400
- Come on, man-
- Uh, one minute.

306
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,920
- I'm going.
- Come on, Danny-

307
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,000
Come on. Come on.

308
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,790
Oh, shit.

309
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,510
Ah, shit.
It's not working.

310
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,880
I got him- I got him-
He's rabbiting-

311
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,160
- He's out the back.
- Give me real-time imagery coverage
at LAT 38, 55, LONG 77, 00.

312
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,400
Got it. Base, this is local control.

313
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,790
Request immediate keyhole
visual tasking. Maximum resolution.

314
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,590
LAT 38, 55, LONG 77, 00. Over.

315
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,680
Roger that. I'll need a minute
on satellite visual. Over.

316
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,000
Run, run, Danny-
They got guns- Go-

317
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,350
- Where is he?
- He's on the roof. Right there. Go-

318
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,680
-Okay, satellite imagery coming through.
-Roger that. Patch visual, my location.

319
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,110
Confirm visual. Thank you much.
Air One, ahead.

320
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,400
All units:
Target heading north on rooftop.

321
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,400
Columbia and 18th.
Request immediate visual support. Over.

322
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,310
Roger that. We have visual.

323
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,960
Everybody move.
He just jumped to the adjacent building.

324
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,720
- All units,
he is entering rear entrance--
- Entering entrance of Captain Ike's.

325
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,750
- Captain Ike 's.
- Roger.

326
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,310
Get out of the way-

327
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,440
Hey-

328
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,790
- Air One, be advised, suspect
heading towards front entrance.
- Front of Columbia.

329
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,240
- Detail front of building on Columbia.
- Copy that.

330
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,240
I got him- I got him-

331
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,680
All units, target
entering the barber-shop.

332
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,920
- Hah- Bullshit-
We lost him; we lost him.
- We've lost him-

333
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,270
- I can't--
- Units in pursuit, target seen exiting
rear of barber-shop in alley. Follow.

334
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,160
- Okay, I'm blank. I can't see anything.
- Air One, we've lost the visual.

335
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,030
- I'm blank. What do you got?
- Who's got him?

336
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,240
Zavitz- Dan Zavitz-

337
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,240
Hey, uh-- It's me, Bobby Dean. We were
at Georgetown together. You okay?

338
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,640
- Help me.
- Are you hurt?
- What do you think of this one, sir?

339
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,480
Yeah, this is Becky.
Becky, say hi.

340
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,920
I'm s-- Can I have one second, please?

341
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,550
Oh, he's right on top of Pratt.
He's running from Pratt on Connecticut.

342
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,880
- Pratt, he's on your 6:00. Turn around.
- Got him-

343
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,640
Move, move, move.
Get out of the way-

344
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:26,270
Hey, hey-
Come back, man- Come back-

345
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,750
Hey, I got him-

346
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,960
Target northbound--
northbound on Connecticut.

347
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,920
Okay, got him.

348
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,880
Go, go, go, go-

349
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,030
Switching targets. Switching.
Now heading southbound
towards DuPont circle.

350
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,030
Stop-

351
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,790
Target down on Connecticut Avenue.
Air One, confirm.

352
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,880
Target is down.
Target is down permanently.

353
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,400
- What happened?
- A guy on a bike got creamed.

354
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,400
Oh, Jesus.

355
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,270
- I'm beating you.
- Yeah, right.

356
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,590
- Oh, you are.
- Oh, sh--

357
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,030
- Hey, hey-
- I'm beating you.
- No, I'm beating you.

358
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,110
- I just caught up.
- Hello.
- Oh, yeah?
- Hi, Mr Dean.

359
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,720
Am I in the wrong house?

360
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,480
I'm looking for an eight-year-old boy,
about yea high.

361
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,270
- Kinda good-looking. Allegedly my son.
- No.

362
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,070
- Hmm. Maybe he's behind the TV.
- Eric?
- Mr Dean-
- Dad-

363
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,920
- Eric?
- Mr Dean, get out-
- Get out of the way-

364
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,350
What? What? Oh, I'm sorry.

365
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,720
- Are those my Christmas presents?
- Yep, some of 'em.

366
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,000
- Can I open 'em?
- Yeah, sure. Here you go.

367
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,240
- Seriously?
- In your dreams, buddy. Beat it.
- Dad-

368
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,960
- Are you staying for dinner
tonight, Dylan?
- If it's okay with you.

369
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,830
- Got any money?
- Money?
- He's kidding.

370
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,830
- I'm going to sleep over
at Dylan's, okay?
- Did you ask your mother?

371
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,550
I was going to, but she's
too busy yelling at the TV.

372
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,640
Oh, well, there goes the Fourth
Amendment-- what's left of it.

373
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,440
- Hey, Maria.
- Hello, Mr Bobby.

374
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,550
Don't you honestly doubt
that the average citizen--

375
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,270
Hey, you're about a bark-and-a-half
from being homeless.

376
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,880
Baby, listen to
this fascist gas bag.

377
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,590
- Uh-oh.
- ...and freedom have
always existed in a--

378
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,750
in a very precarious balance,
and when buildings start blowing up,
people's priorities tend to change.

379
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,000
- He's got a point there, sweetie.
- Bobby-

380
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,480
- I mean, who is this idiot?
- He is talking about ending
personal privacy.

381
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,550
- Do you want your phone tapped?
- I'm not planning on
blowing up the country.

382
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,000
Well, how do we know until we've heard
all your dirty little secrets?

383
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,070
You're just gonna have to trust me.

384
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,030
Oh, I know.
We'll just tap the criminals.

385
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,550
We won't suspend the civil rights
of the good people.

386
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,440
- Right.
- Then who decides which is which?

387
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:56,310
- I think you should.
- You know, Bobby, I think you
should take this more seriously.

388
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,110
Honey, I think you're taking it
seriously enough for both of us...

389
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,240
and half the people on the block.

390
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,680
Tens of millions of foreign nationals
living within our borders...

391
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,640
and many of these people consider
the United States their enemy.

392
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:15,400
- And they see acts of terrorism as--
- You remember Daniel Zavitz?

393
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,240
- We were at Georgetown together?
- Vaguely.

394
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,790
- I saw him today.
- How's he doing?

395
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,510
- He's dead.
- What?

396
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,920
- He got hit by a fire engine
pretty much in front of my eyes.
- Oh, my God-

397
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,790
I ran into him in a store,
and he was upset about something.

398
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,920
- About what?
- I don't know.

399
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,000
Before we had a chance to talk about it,
he ran out of the store...

400
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,790
and next time I saw him,
he was dead.

401
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,590
Baby- Come here.

402
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,110
Ohh, I love you so much-

403
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,270
I love you, too, sweetie.

404
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,310
Oh, that's not even to mention
the gangster that threatened
to kill me today.

405
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,590
- Hah- Very funny-
- Oh, you think? Hilarious.

406
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,440
- Hmm. What'd you get me?
- A bowling ball.

407
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,680
No more of that MSNBC terrorist talk.
You're scaring the kids.

408
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,200
We'll be back with your phone calls for
Congressman Sam Albert right after this.

409
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,030
- Tell me.
- Zavitz is dead. So is Lenny,
the guy from the paper.

410
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,680
- What about the tape?
- We found the original
in Zavitz's apartment.

411
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,550
- The original?
- There was a copy.

412
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,030
- There was a copy?
- I think so, sir.
- Any more good news?

413
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,750
They never made it to the newspaper,
but there was a private sector contact.

414
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,000
- Who was that?
- Several indiscriminants
and one primary.

415
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,240
- Who?
- Robert Dean.
He's a D.C. Labor lawyer.

416
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,070
Lives in Georgetown with his wife,
Carla Dean. She's also an attorney.

417
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
She's with the ACLU, as it happens.

418
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,270
Well, I suppose he could've given it
directly to Bob Woodward.

419
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,790
Maybe we dodged a bullet.
Find out what Dean knows.

420
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,790
- Make contact.
- Yes, sir.

421
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,000
I hate doing this at Christmas.

422
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,680
Fiedler, we need
a complete FinCEN, EPIC...

423
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,960
and a DRD work-up
on a Robert Clayton Dean.

424
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:59,790
His social's 986-26-0901.
Pull up keyhole data files, okay?

425
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,160
Let's go-
Let's get this show on the road-

426
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:07,240
Eric, just call me in the morning
when you want me to come pick you up.

427
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,200
You know, if you decide
you want to stay at Dylan's
till the end of the weekend...

428
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,680
or the end of the century,
your mom and I have discussed it.

429
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,240
It'll be difficult initially,
but we think we can live with it.

430
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,510
Dad's kidding.
He's gonna miss you, just like me.

431
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,920
Honey, hurry back.
You know what that means.

432
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,350
Mm-hmm. That you're gonna
be asleep when I get back.

433
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,160
That only happened
one time, sweetie.

434
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,680
We're running
a comprehensive database search.

435
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,960
Brian did a preliminary
analysis and comparison...

436
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,960
and he came up with
some pretty interesting stuff.

437
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,070
Thanks, Brian.

438
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,640
Thank you.

439
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,790
Prioritize his phone bill.

440
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,440
Who's he been calling?

441
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,400
- Oh, man. Check this one.
- Who?

442
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:01,160
Rachel F-For-You-Know-What Banks. God,
would I love to have her ruin my life.

443
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,510
Do a cross.

444
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,920
They were at Georgetown
together, sophomore year.

445
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,920
They have the same address,
same phone number.

446
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:12,920
They remain close.
Many calls, regardless of marriage.

447
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,310
- Oh, here we go.
- What?

448
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,070
Dean, over the past 18 months...

449
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,550
has four, five, seven cash
withdrawals of 4,000, 5,000...

450
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,030
and up, and up...

451
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,590
and each time,
the delectable Miss Banks...

452
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,310
makes large cash deposits
of her own within a day or two.

453
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,270
- Blackmail?
- Well, her deposits aren't the same,
but let me figure this out.

454
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,480
Ah, yes, they're exactly-- exactly
15 percent of the amount Dean withdrew.

455
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,510
Brian, can we get some more?

456
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,920
I mean, you know, we got the blimp cam,
we got the police officer cam...

457
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,000
we've got, uh, two ATM cameras,
but this is the one showing promise.

458
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,000
This is the security camera
at the underwear store. Freeze there.

459
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,790
Rotate us 75 degrees
around the vertical, please.

460
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,510
Freeze there. Times ten.

461
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,880
Focus on the drop.

462
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Enhance, then forward frame-by-frame.

463
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,480
All right. Now, just before
the view's blocked, there's
a shape change in Dean's bag.

464
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,750
See the shadow variance? See?

465
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,400
The shadow's wrong. Zavitz changed
the configuration of Dean's packages.

466
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,510
- Is it a tape?
- It's hard to say for sure.
These things are--

467
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,350
- Can the computer take us
around to the other side?
- It can hypothesize. Chris?

468
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,400
- Yeah?
- Can you rotate us 75 degrees
around the vertical, please?

469
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,160
- What do you think it is?
- It looks a lot bigger than a tape.

470
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:46,070
Zavitz had digital compression
equipment in his apartment.
He could've downloaded it to anything.

471
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,070
Or maybe the bag twisted
in Dean's hand.

472
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,680
Or something moved in front
of the light and altered
the shadow. Maybe it's nothing.

473
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,720
Maybe it's everything.
Let's get it and find out.

474
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,480
Beat it. I got work to do.

475
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,350
Go. Porsche-

476
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,030
Go away-

477
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,630
Damn it, Porsche-

478
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,110
- Hello, Mr Dean?
- Uh, yes. Can I help you?

479
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,070
This is Detective Benning.
I'm Pratt. We're with D.C. Metro.

480
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,840
Uh, sorry to bother you at home, sir.
We were just hoping to ask you
a few questions about Daniel Zavitz.

481
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,590
- Wh-- I'm s-- Can I see
your badges, please?
- Certainly, sir.

482
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,920
Sure.

483
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,880
All right. Come on.
Back up, Porsche.

484
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,510
- All right. Nice and smooth.
Come on, boys.
- Okay.

485
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,710
I didn't really see the accident.
I don't know whose fault it was.

486
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,480
- Oh, we're not here to talk
about the accident, Mr Dean.
- I'm sorry, I thought you said
you were here--

487
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,880
We should apologize
for the confusion, sir.

488
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,190
It's just that we're handling
a different aspect of the inquiry.

489
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,880
Um, it turns out Mr Zavitz was
involved in an extortion scheme.

490
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,070
- What kind of watch is that?
- Did you represent Mr Zavitz
as an attorney?
- It's an Omega.

491
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,320
- No, I didn't.
- So you're not constrained
by attorney-client privilege?

492
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,030
- Shh-shh. Yeah, that's correct.
- You see, Mr Dean...

493
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,480
we have reason to believe
that Mr Zavitz may have passed
sensitive materials to you.

494
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,590
- What kind of materials?
- Well, sensitive, so we're hoping
that you could tell us that.

495
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,760
Uh, no, he-he didn't pass me anything.

496
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,190
These voice stress points indicate
a really high degree of anxiety.

497
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,440
- Anxiety about what?
- That's the nature of physics.

498
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,400
If he'd have given me something,
I would've known.

499
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,670
- Oh, he's lying-
- What about your packages, sir?

500
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,630
Could something have slipped in amongst
the purchases without your knowledge?

501
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,630
Excuse me. Daniel Zavitz
did not give me anything.

502
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,670
- That's a Parker pen.
- It's a Mont Blanc.

503
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,800
He didn't secrete it
into any of my bodily orifices.

504
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,840
- Whatever it is, I don't have it.
- Could we look at them?

505
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,110
- I don't think so.
Not without a warrant.
- Oh, Christ.

506
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,710
- This guy's good.
- How did you happen
to be at Ruby's today?

507
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,110
I was shopping for some lingerie.
That's still legal, isn't it?

508
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,800
- You buying that for your wife?
- No, I was, uh, picking
something up for myself.

509
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,960
I do a little cross-dressing
on the weekends.
You know, you'd be surprised...

510
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,880
how a nice pair of edible panties
can make a guy feel sexy.

511
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,840
We thought it might be
for Rachel Banks.

512
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,230
Good night, gentlemen.

513
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,510
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Mr Dean.

514
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,960
What are they talking about, Porsche?
There's nothing here.

515
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,280
Honey, I'm home.

516
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,710
Uh, yeah, uh, just a second, sweetie.

517
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,840
Well, either he's getting ready
to do something with it,
or he doesn't know he has it.

518
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,030
Or he doesn't have it.

519
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,320
You know what I've seen?

520
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,150
I've seen killers walk free
because the eyewitness was an alcoholic.

521
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,320
I've seen sex offenders
that couldn't be touched
because the victim was a call girl.

522
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,070
Credibility-- It's the only
currency that means anything
on this kind of playing field.

523
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,150
Dean's got the tape,
and he's gonna come out with it; and
when he does, I want his credibility.

524
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,920
I want people to know he's lying
before they hear what he says.

525
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,070
We could take his wife and kid.
He'd give it up for them.

526
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,670
We'd have the police and the FBI
all over this in 24 hours.

527
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,030
Put taps on his 20
most frequently called numbers,
and let's get into his life.

528
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,920
The union situation has--
has mob written all over it.

529
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,030
And he's definitely vulnerable
on Rachel Banks.

530
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,920
I want to know about his wife,
I want to know about his parents...

531
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:36,230
I want to know about
his gambling problems,
his urine samples, his porno rentals.

532
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,000
I want to use every means possible
to get what we need...

533
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,030
because this little
son of a bitch is not going to be
the final chapter of my life.

534
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,630
- Tell me something.
- Uh-oh.

535
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,590
How did you find out Pintero
was associated with union officials?

536
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,550
I'm just that good.

537
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,320
I hired an investigator.

538
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,840
- Hey.
- Shut up the dog-

539
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,110
My mom used to have one of these.
Come on. Ow- The dog bit me-

540
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,480
- Oh, who was the investigator?
- Wh-- I-- What do you mean? His name?

541
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,510
Come on, Bobby. You know what I'm
asking. Is it the guy who Rachel knows?

542
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,670
Ca-- Why do we-- Why do we have
to go through this every time?

543
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,480
- Bobby, I'm just asking, okay?
- Carla, Rachel Banks is not
an issue any more.

544
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,070
You are the only woman
in the world for me.

545
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,590
You and Janet Jackson.

546
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,190
I-I have to be honest.
If-If Janet Jackson called me...

547
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,070
I w-- I-- I might have to change
my last name to Jackson.

548
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:04,110
Yeah, right. I'd have to break
that woman's legs too.

549
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,590
- Lower, lower,
like kids would do it, damn it.
- You sound like a fucking old lady.
Shut up.

550
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Ooh, sensitive.

551
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,000
All right. Jones has some issues
we need to resolve.

552
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,320
- Oh. Hey, Control, they are home.
- Uh-oh.

553
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,320
Move, guys.

554
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,280
Oh, nice blender.

555
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,840
Oh, my God.

556
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,320
Oh, Porsche.

557
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,920
Oh, damn. The dog is green.

558
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:00,000
Jones painted the-- the dog-

559
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,880
This is Robert Dean, 2811 Sutton.
I'd like to report a break-in.

560
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,880
I don't know. Um, it's been vandalized.
From the looks of it, i-it's kids...

561
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,360
but I need a squad car
here immediately.

562
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,840
- Here we go.
- We'll be checking out the rest
of the house, sir, ma'am.

563
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,440
At least they left me one.

564
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,190
How do you know
it wasn't Pintero?

565
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,110
I don't. It was just
kind of frivolous.

566
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,190
I guess I'm just hoping
it was kids.

567
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,320
John.

568
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,030
What have we here?

569
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,440
I think we have a winner.

570
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,630
Phone for phone.

571
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,110
- Take any of your clothes?
- No.

572
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,590
They threw all my shoes
and suits in the tub...

573
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,590
and spray painted my damn dog.

574
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,110
- Black.
- Black.

575
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,190
Perfect. How does that look?

576
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,800
Paging Mr Dean.

577
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,360
We have you bugged, Mr Dean.

578
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:38,150
They thrashed my computers,
my big-screen TV-- They took my blender.

579
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,630
- What about jewelery?
- Nope.

580
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,510
- What about silverware?
- Nope. Just my blender.

581
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,320
- Blender, huh?
- Loved that blender.

582
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,190
You know, I did stuff
when I was a kid.

583
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,030
I mean, not breaking-and-entering,
but, you know, stuff.

584
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,360
Yeah, we all did stuff. I just wish
they hadn't stolen my damn blender.

585
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,190
You seem a little attached
to this blender, Robert.

586
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,800
Yeah, well, some people meditate,
some people get massages.

587
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,590
- I blend.
- You're really weird, you know that?

588
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,840
Yeah, then on top of it, the only suit
they leave me is three years old.

589
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,800
Hasn't gotten any better with age.

590
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,400
Blow over? I'm not--
I'm not gonna sit around
and wait for this to blow over-

591
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,030
Jerry, I-- I'm, I'm suing their
right-wing asses right into Chapter 11-

592
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,230
This is flagrant- They never even called
to see what my side of the story was-

593
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,110
- They have no Sullivan
protection with this-
- Mr Dean?

594
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,440
- Yes.
- Rachel Banks is on line one...

595
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,960
and, uh, Silverberg and Blake
would like to see you
in the conference room.

596
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,800
All right. Uh, Jerry, uh,
I got to take this call. All right.

597
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,400
- Hey, what's up?
- My firm called me this morning
telling me not to come in.

598
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,800
- What? Why not?
- I don't know.

599
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,710
Reporters are calling, asking me
about my relationship with you...

600
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,440
and how long
I've worked for the mob.

601
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,070
- The mob, Bobby.
- Jesus.

602
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,710
- Do you know how hard
I worked to get this job?
- Yeah, I know. I know.

603
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,840
Mr Dean, Silverberg and Blake
are still waiting to see you
in the conference room.

604
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,030
- I heard you the first time.
Thank you.
- Look. You got your own problems.

605
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:04,110
Uh, no, Rachel. It's fine.

606
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,400
Oh, g--

607
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,110
I just got off the phone
with a source that I trust.

608
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,230
A grand jury is being convened
to look into your labor practice...

609
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,030
as far back as the
electrical workers' strike.

610
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:27,190
- And why is that?
- They claim you helped create a shell
company for Sam Villotti in Zurich...

611
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,110
and that through your continuing
relationship, the Peitso family
has been able...

612
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,070
to exert influence and provide
false witness to discredit our case.

613
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,070
- Oh, well, that's true.
- You're admitting it?

614
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:42,190
Sure. Everything except
setting up a company in Zurich...

615
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,590
or even knowing anyone
named Sam Villotti...

616
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,630
or having any relationship
whatsoever to the Peitso family-

617
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,670
- This is ridiculous-
- Robert--
- Uh, Mark, I'm tell you.

618
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,480
This is Pintero.
He's coming back after me.

619
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,320
You give me one week-- one week
and four guys from litigation...

620
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,230
and I guarantee you,
we have this guy begging us--

621
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,670
Tell us about Rachel Banks.

622
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,840
Tell you what. Uh, she was my girlfriend
the second year of law school.

623
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,320
We keep in touch.
We-We toss one another some work
every once in a while. Uh, that's it.

624
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,590
Did you have an affair
with her four years ago?

625
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,670
You ever beat off
in the shower, Brian?

626
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,800
Hmm? You ever have
any homosexual thoughts?

627
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,800
- Bobby, that is--
- None of my fucking business-
You're damn right it's not-

628
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,710
I love my wife,
and I love my son absolutely...

629
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,670
with no equivocations, and that's
none of your fucking business either-

630
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,000
Uh, we think that you
should take a leave of absence...

631
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,070
until we're able
to, uh, sort all this out.

632
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:42,030
- Are you firing me?
- I think you just fired yourself.

633
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,590
Carla-

634
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,590
Where is she, Jen?

635
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,110
- Don't go in there.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
- Why not?

636
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,070
Because she's reading the paper.

637
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,590
- Asshole.
- Carla--

638
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,960
- How could you let me
find out like this?
- I'm finding out like this.

639
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:20,670
This is all lies.
Th-- None of this stuff is true.

640
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,440
- So you're saying
you weren't there with her?
- Yes, I had lunch with her.

641
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:27,070
We have lunch once a month. She's the
contact for the investigator, Brill.

642
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:31,360
You were right about that. Someone
must have taken this picture off the
security camera outside the restaurant.

643
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:35,320
- You said she wasn't an issue.
- She's not- I have to see her
for business.

644
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,710
-And I-- And I knew if I told you that--
-Bobby, you had an affair
with this woman- An affair.

645
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,440
We went to a counselor for a year-

646
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:46,510
And now you're standing there lying
about even seeing her? You make me sick-

647
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,590
Carla, I am smeared all over
the newspapers for money-laundering
schemes, mob ties--

648
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,630
I lost my job. I am asking you--

649
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,880
I'm asking you to please just trust me
on this Rachel Banks thing right now.

650
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:05,710
How in God's name can I trust you?
Bobby, I want you to leave.

651
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,440
- Carla, I'm telling you
that this is all bullshit-
- I don't wanna hear anything else.

652
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:12,550
I don't wanna hear anything else.
I cannot think with you in my face.
I want you to leave.

653
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,840
- What do you need to think about?
- Bobby, get out-
- I'm telling you it's bullshit-
- Get out-

654
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,550
Just leave, so I can think-
For me, okay? Just leave.

655
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:22,070
Just go, Bobby. Go. Go.

656
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,920
- You want a blend?
- Yeah.

657
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,710
Thanks.

658
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,590
- Hi.
- Hi. Uh, I'd like to have a room
for the evening, please.

659
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,920
Okay. Thank you.

660
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:51,320
-I'm sorry, sir. This card was declined.
-Declined? This is a brand-new card.
Try it again, please.

661
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,400
Yes, sir.

662
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,550
You know, maybe it's
not activated yet.

663
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,320
Thank you.
Run this one, please. Thank you.

664
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,230
Yes, sir.

665
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,840
No, it didn't go through.

666
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,800
- But I'll try it again.
- N-No, thank you.

667
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,880
- My briefcase is gone.
- Excuse me, sir?

668
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,590
- My briefcase was right here.
- Are you sure you brought it in?

669
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,400
Yes, I'm sure I brought it in-

670
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,280
Hi. This is Rachel.
Leave a message after the beep.

671
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,800
Hey, Rachel, it's Bobby.
Uh, I need to talk to you...

672
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,960
and I need to talk to you
face-to-face.

673
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:34,150
Uh, meet me tomorrow, 11:00 a.m.,
Mount Vernon Square. I'll see you then.

674
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,590
Yes.

675
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,400
All right, we're moving into
phase two of the training op.

676
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:51,480
Selb's gonna brief you on it,
so listen up, all right?

677
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,480
We're gonna be following
the subjects through the square.

678
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:57,670
We're gonna have three listening
stations and two video surveillance
units with unidirectional mikes.

679
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,710
Pratt, you're three.
Jones, Fiedler, Krug...

680
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,030
you guys are at ground level.
You'll be following the targets.

681
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,230
You move when I say,
you go when I say.

682
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,710
All handoffs go on my command.

683
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,440
Now, for the uninitiated,
if we don't have line-of-sight...

684
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:13,110
we can't hear
what they say, right?

685
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,280
- Right?
- Yeah. Got it.

686
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,320
- All right. You guys clear?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

687
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,550
Jones, Krug, what, are you guys
from communications?

688
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,510
- No, we're ops.
- You can tell by their haircuts.

689
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,480
I would like to sit down
with Mr Pintero in private...

690
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,400
so he and I can discuss
what's happening to me.

691
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,510
I called; they said he was here.

692
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:41,070
Mr Pintero would like to help you.

693
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,030
- But he won't.
- And why not?

694
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,480
Well, because first, you haven't
told him who made the tape...

695
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:53,630
and second, we've spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars...

696
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,960
on shyster lawyers just like you...

697
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:00,360
because of shyster lawyers
just like you.

698
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,800
Actually, I believe
the slur "shyster"...

699
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,000
is generally reserved
for Jewish attorneys.

700
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,960
I believe the proper slur
for someone like myself...

701
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,230
would be, uh, "eggplant."

702
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,360
Boom. This kid gets brighter
every time I see him.

703
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:24,440
- You said 11:00 sharp.
- I know. Uh, Christmas
traffic is horrible.

704
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:31,590
You know, it's not so smart, us being
seen together in public like this.

705
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,880
- Do we have anything to hide?
- Heavy background on one.
Could we do better on audio two?

706
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:37,880
- Unfortunately not.
- Two is better.

707
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:39,920
IRS contacted me this morning.

708
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:44,280
- Two, you're good. Hold position.
- They say my lifestyle
exceeds my income.

709
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,400
Ohh. You're being audited?

710
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:50,110
For the last four years.
What's going on, Bobby?

711
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,320
Uh, look, don't worry about that.
W-- My firm will represent you
completely free of charge.

712
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,590
- Eighty percent.
- You don't work there
any more, remember?

713
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,710
- It's a temporary situation.
- Your 80's becoming a 20.
- Bullshit.
- Move to audio three.

714
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,670
- On three. Much better. Much better.
- We're screwed.

715
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,190
- Wake up, one.
- We are out.

716
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,510
Rachel, I'm going to fix this.

717
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,480
- How?
- Tell me about Brill.

718
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:18,360
- Did he say "Bill"?
- No, "Brill," with an "R."
- I can't do that.

719
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,150
- Cross-reference Rachel's file.
See if the name "Brill" comes up.
- Got it.

720
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:25,320
Rachel, don't you see that he is
the key to this whole mess?

721
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,320
From the second you gave me that tape,
my life has been falling apart.

722
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,510
You assured me
that this-this guy was legit.

723
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:34,030
- You needed information;
I got it for you.
- Two, you're good. Hold position.

724
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,840
- Three is good.
- This conversation is over.

725
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,070
- Okay, here we go.
- What are you gonna do?
You gonna wander around--
- Two, you gotta do better.

726
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:46,000
- Want your job back--
- Shit.
- Do you want your life back?

727
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,710
I don't have a life.

728
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,440
I'm in love with a married man.

729
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:59,320
Okay, I have 'em on the bench.

730
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,510
Rachel, I'm sorry, but there's
nothing I can do about that.

731
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:08,000
What makes you think it's you?

732
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:12,400
It's not me?

733
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:14,400
I j-- I just as-assumed from--

734
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,960
- You're a moron, you know that?
- Yes. I know.

735
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,840
Rachel, you're gonna have
to tell me about Brill.

736
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
Let's get outta here.

737
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,880
All right. They're on the move.

738
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,880
- Coming to three.
- Stay with 'em.
- I got 40's, 20--

739
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,590
- You're following through trees.
Two, can you track them?
- I lost line-of-sight.

740
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,550
- Repeat, I have lost line-of-sight.
- Three, you've got nothing.

741
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:49,150
- Lost line-of-sight. I'm out.
- We lost audio. It's gone. But we have
his tracers. We can still follow 'em.

742
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,150
When I need to reach Brill, I--

743
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,440
I chalk the mailbox
outside my house.

744
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:57,510
When he crosses the mark,
I make the drop.

745
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:01,510
The location's always the same--
same time, same place.

746
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:04,800
3:00 p.m. ferry to Gibson Island.

747
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,630
- You ever see him in person?
- He's the cautious type.

748
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,030
He's not gonna like you
tracking him down.

749
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,630
The drop is behind seat 32.

750
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,280
I leave something;
he picks it up later.

751
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:13,550
I'm sorry it took so long. I had to
make sure you weren't being followed.

752
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,030
- Brill.
- Brill's dead.

753
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:19,230
Died of smallpox when he was two.
Buried in a field in Kansas.

754
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,230
- What is that ?
- It's a bug-sweeper.

755
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,880
- Take off your left shoe.
- What does it mean when--

756
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:30,710
Take off your shoe. I don't have time to
explain. Take off your shoe right now.

757
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,840
Come on.

758
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,880
It's a beacon transmitter.
Thousand-yard range.

759
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,150
They're close. Let's go.

760
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,000
Who is "they"?

761
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,710
And why are they putting things
in my shoes?

762
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,550
No, get in the back,
like you're a customer.

763
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,960
Everything's gone--
the wife, job...

764
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,880
bank accounts, everything.

765
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,510
You said Zavitz was behind
an extortion scheme?

766
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,230
- No, they said it.
- You were the last one
that talked to him?

767
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,190
- Yeah.
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.
He said, uh, "Help me, Bobby."

768
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,630
- Help me with what?
- I don't know. We never got
around to that.

769
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,320
- What did he give you?
- Nothing. He didn't give me anything.

770
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,880
Listen, you gotta come clean.
If you bullshit me, I can't help you.

771
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,150
- No- I'm telling ya,
he didn't give me anything. Nothing.
- A name? A phone number?

772
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,670
No, nothing-
He didn't give me anything-

773
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,880
- Who the hell is that?
- Oh, just somebody trying
to get our attention.

774
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,800
Well, he's doing
a good job.

775
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,190
Two-zero-nine to anybody.
I need help.

776
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,440
- Who you calling?
I thought you worked alone.
- Just shut up a second.

777
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,110
- Stay exactly where you are.
- Hey-

778
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,440
Look what you did to my car-

779
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,550
Shit-

780
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:54,150
Okay, gentlemen, we have a subject
entering the structure on the
northeast corner of Chambers and Light.

781
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,920
That's 105 Chambers Avenue.

782
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:01,070
- Run a check on all six tracers.
- All six tracers are operative.

783
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:04,070
- Call up geo-position.
- Yeah, I got it. No problem.
- Task keyhole their coordinates.

784
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:08,590
All right. LAT, 39 degrees, 14 minutes.
LONG, 74 degrees, 39 minutes.

785
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,670
- Hello.
- Carla, don't hang up on me.

786
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,920
- Robert, do you know what
I'm looking at right now?
- Carla, listen.

787
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:33,360
Photographs of you and Rachel
taken today. Is this true?

788
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,280
Carla-- Carla, how did
you get the pictures?

789
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,510
By messenger, Robert-
By messenger.

790
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:41,590
- What does it matter?
- Look, all right, um--

791
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,510
Some-- Something's going on.
I don't-- I don't know who it is.

792
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:47,030
Robert,
I went to the store today...

793
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,760
and my ATM and my credit cards
didn't work.

794
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,480
- I know. Mine either.
- I couldn't buy food.

795
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,030
- I gotta go.
- What do you mean you gotta go?

796
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:01,400
- Carla-- Carla, I gotta-- I gotta go.
- Robert, wait a minute.

797
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,480
Get on the fucking elevator.

798
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:19,630
Oh, really?

799
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:26,800
Got vertical movement here.

800
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,840
Elevator.
He's in an elevator.

801
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,190
- We're losing our tracking.
- Anybody got a visual?
- We need to move location
and get better signal.

802
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,840
- I'm on it.
- Are you guys there yet?
- Negative.

803
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,190
What the fuck is going on?

804
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,760
- Shh.
- Wait. They stopped.

805
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,280
Hold it.

806
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:11,000
- I don't know what your problem--
- Shh.

807
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,110
I'm getting high-frequency clutter.
We lost tracers one, two and six.

808
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,320
Their signals are completely dead.
Something is wrong here.

809
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,000
Get up.

810
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:59,320
- Tracers three, four and five
are on their way up.
- He's getting help, boys.
He's getting help.

811
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,840
We had an arrangement.
No contact. You broke the rules.

812
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,550
They got to be heading for the roof.
Air One, we need to establish
visual on the rooftop...

813
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,480
northeast corner,
Chambers and Light.

814
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,190
Copy that. Rooftop,
northeast corner, Chambers and Light.

815
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,480
Do you know how many federal agents
you had following you on that ferry?

816
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:16,400
- I-I don't--
- Who are you working for?
- What are you talking about? I'm not--

817
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,480
Is that about me? Am I a target here?
Do they know me?

818
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:23,280
-Who is "they"?
-Do they know me?
-I don't know what you're talking about-

819
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,360
You're either very smart
or incredibly stupid.

820
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,550
Get off. Come on.

821
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,630
- I got separating signals here.
- Tracer three is on its way down.
Four and five are still together.

822
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,840
Where did he go?

823
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:44,550
- How'd you find out about the ferry?
Who set that up for you?
- Rachel did. Who was that other guy?

824
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:48,280
- What did he say, exactly?
- He said he was Brill.

825
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,070
Did he say it or did you say it,
and he picked up on it? Come on. Think.

826
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:55,280
- Shit, I said it.
- God damn it. You see,
that's why I have rules.

827
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,360
- Is all this about Pintero?
- You think the mob
uses devices like this?

828
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,550
-Excuse me, sir.
Where are your elevators?
-Right over there.
-In your phone was a GPS sat-tracker.

829
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:11,030
- Pulse is at 24 gigahertz.
- I don't know what that means.

830
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,190
It's like a Lo Jack,
only two generations better
than what the police have.

831
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,400
- And what does that mean?
- Do you speak English?
- Obviously not that well.

832
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:21,800
You're kind of a jerk, aren't you?
It means the NSA can read the time
off your fucking wristwatch.

833
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,280
All right. Enough of this bullshit.
Right now, you either shoot me
or tell me what the fuck is going on-

834
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,320
- Jones, you take the stairs.
- Krug, hold the perimeter.
Come in on my signal.

835
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,030
The National Security Agency
conducts worldwide surveillance--

836
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:36,440
fax, phones,
satellite communication.

837
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:40,070
They're the only ones in the country,
including the military, who could
possibly have anything like this.

838
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,880
- Why are they after me?
- I don't know, and I don't wanna know.

839
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:46,550
Here they come. I thought these
sat dishes would scramble their signals.

840
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,760
Control, this is Air One.
Repeat coordinates.

841
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,800
105 Chambers Avenue.

842
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,590
You're transmitting.
They still have a signal on you.

843
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,590
Your collar, your belt, your zipper.
Get rid of your clothes.
All of them.

844
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:01,190
- And then what am I supposed to do?
- Nothing. You live another day,
I'll be very impressed.

845
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,360
- Two targets, rooftop, north side.
- Understood. Two targets, rooftop.
Maintain visual, please.

846
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:08,070
- You have something they want.
- Look, I don't have anything-

847
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:11,630
Maybe you do and you don't know it.
You stay away from Rachel
and you stay away from me.

848
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,000
You come near either one of us, I'm
gonna kill you. Get rid of your watch.

849
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:19,630
- My wife gave me this
for our anniversary.
- Then keep it. Stay off the phone.

850
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,480
- Wait a minute. Either he just
committed suicide here--
- Or he learned to fly.

851
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:33,800
- Air One, stay with him.
- Target's on the move.

852
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,440
Satellite imagery
coming through.

853
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:40,760
One meter res layering wireframe
coming your way. Over.

854
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,800
Okay, gentlemen,
we're back on-line.

855
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,190
Okay. Wireframe download complete.

856
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,590
All right. We have a tracer
in the stairwell on 20 traveling down.

857
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,670
Nineteen, eighteen...

858
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,760
seventeen...

859
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,670
Moving up-

860
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:05,070
He's out of the stairwell
on 17. Go to 17.

861
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:13,070
Oh, shit.

862
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:27,840
Shit. Mr Wu.

863
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,630
- Target is holding on 17.
Zoom three Mag.
- Zooming.

864
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:34,440
Mr Wu.

865
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,400
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

866
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:41,880
Hi. I'm from hotel hospitality
and evaluation.

867
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:44,760
Oh, no, no. No tip. I'm fine.
Thank you. No tip.

868
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,550
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I just wanna make sure that you folks
have absolutely everything you need...

869
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:52,150
- to be completely comfortable.
- I got something here.

870
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:55,960
- We got him.
- Krug, Jones...

871
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:58,070
get your asses up here
to the 17th floor right now.

872
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:01,510
That's really important
to us here.

873
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,070
- Okay, that's our last tracer.
- Mr Dean-

874
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:56,150
Let's not let this get out of hand.
Let's not involve
the hotel guests in this.

875
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,380
Down, ma'am, sir.
Sit down. Please? Thank you. Thank you.

876
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,570
-Door-
-Everything's gonna be all right, folks.

877
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:14,340
Krug, balcony-

878
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,900
Air One and Control, we got him.
He's dropped to the 16th floor.

879
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:21,380
Air One, visual support. Check
perimeter, south side of the building.

880
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:24,130
Ten-four, Control.
We have visual.

881
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:33,210
- He jumped to 15. Go to 15.
- Go-
