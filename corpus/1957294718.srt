YOUR PARTNER,

1066
01:15:32,309 --> 01:15:34,355
YOUR ACCOMPLICE,
YOUR SLAVE, ANYTHING.

1067
01:15:34,355 --> 01:15:35,400
PLEASE JUST
LET ME PLAY.

1068
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,010
IT'S NOT A GAME.

1069
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:39,404
IT'S ARMED ROBBERY.
YOU DON'T PRACTICE.

1070
01:15:39,404 --> 01:15:40,666
LET'S GO.
FILL IT UP.

1071
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:42,712
PUT THE MONEY
IN THE BAG.

1072
01:15:42,712 --> 01:15:44,365
PUT THE MONEY
IN THE BAG.

1073
01:15:44,365 --> 01:15:46,019
COME ON.
I'LL KILL YOU.

1074
01:15:46,019 --> 01:15:47,455
PUT IT IN.

1075
01:15:47,455 --> 01:15:48,978
PUT THE BAG IN THERE.

1076
01:15:48,978 --> 01:15:50,458
GIVE IT TO ME.

1077
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:51,982
LAY DOWN!

1078
01:15:55,072 --> 01:15:56,377
YEAH.

1079
01:16:01,034 --> 01:16:02,862
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ABOUT?

1080
01:16:02,862 --> 01:16:05,778
YOU COULD'VE GOT US
KILLED BACK THERE.

1081
01:16:05,778 --> 01:16:08,564
IT WAS
JUST FOR FUN.

1082
01:16:10,087 --> 01:16:12,175
PULL OVER.

1083
01:16:44,338 --> 01:16:45,252
STAY DOWN.

1084
01:16:45,252 --> 01:16:47,254
IF I SAY GO,
YOU GO.

1085
01:16:47,254 --> 01:16:50,431
IF I SAY GO,
YOU GO!

1086
01:17:11,844 --> 01:17:12,671
CHRIS.

1087
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:13,585
WHAT?

1088
01:17:13,585 --> 01:17:15,152
DO YOU THINK HE'LL DIE?

1089
01:17:15,152 --> 01:17:16,849
NO.
NO, HE WON'T DIE.

1090
01:17:16,849 --> 01:17:19,286
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.
I JUST STOPPED HIM.

1091
01:17:19,286 --> 01:17:22,289
SHOT HIM
IN THE SHOULDER.
HE'LL BE O.K.

1092
01:17:22,289 --> 01:17:23,202
DON'T WORRY.

1093
01:17:23,202 --> 01:17:24,857
I'M NOT WORRIED.

1094
01:17:24,857 --> 01:17:27,817
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HAPPENS,

1095
01:17:27,817 --> 01:17:29,688
IT'S EASY
TO GET FREAKED OUT.

1096
01:17:29,688 --> 01:17:33,300
YOU GET SCARED,
BUT YOU CAN'T LOSE
YOUR MOMENTUM.

1097
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:36,434
YOU GOT TO GET RIGHT
BACK ON THE HORSE.

1098
01:17:36,434 --> 01:17:38,130
YOU FALL OFF,
YOU GET BACK ON.

1099
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,523
WHAT HORSE?

1100
01:17:39,523 --> 01:17:44,050
I THINK WE SHOULD ROB
ANOTHER BANK RIGHT AWAY.

1101
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:47,880
IT'S OVER.
DON'T YOU SEE?

1102
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,228
WE'RE HOME FREE.

1103
01:17:49,228 --> 01:17:52,058
BILLS ARE PAID.
WE OWN THIS HOUSE.

1104
01:17:52,058 --> 01:17:55,409
WE GOT CAPITAL
TO START OUR OWN
BUSINESS.

1105
01:17:55,409 --> 01:17:58,195
I SAW A PLACE
THE OTHER DAY

1106
01:17:58,195 --> 01:17:59,762
OVER AT HARRIS PARK.

1107
01:17:59,762 --> 01:18:03,026
IT HAD
GREAT PARKING,
LOTS OF TRAFFIC.

1108
01:18:03,026 --> 01:18:04,853
WE GOT
THE INITIAL STOCK

1109
01:18:04,853 --> 01:18:07,900
AND THE FIRST-YEAR
EXPENSES COVERED.

1110
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,249

1111
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:10,598
HOW CAN YOU QUIT?

1112
01:18:10,598 --> 01:18:11,991
ONCE YOU'RE INTO IT,

1113
01:18:11,991 --> 01:18:13,384
HOW CAN YOU STOP?

1114
01:18:13,384 --> 01:18:15,865
IT'S THE WAY
IT'S GOT TO BE.

1115
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:20,434
THE TIME COMES,
YOU JUST WALK AWAY.

1116
01:18:20,434 --> 01:18:22,088
SINCE HE SHOT
ONE OF THEIR OWN,

1117
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:25,264
THE LOCALS HAVE
A REAL HARD-ON
FOR THIS GUY.

1118
01:18:25,264 --> 01:18:26,614
WE HAVE THEIR FULL
COOPERATION.

1119
01:18:26,614 --> 01:18:28,268
GOOD. FROM NOW ON,

01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:38,844
WE STAKE IT OUT,
WE NAIL HIM.

1124
01:18:56,818 --> 01:18:58,907
DRAMA.

1125
01:18:58,907 --> 01:19:00,518
UH, PUT THOSE

1126
01:19:00,518 --> 01:19:01,780
SHIT, MAN.

1127

OH, COME ON.
THERE'S ONLY ONE BULLET.

1131

THAT'S GOOD ODDS,
OR BAD, DEPENDING.

WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU, CHRIS?

1133
01:19:43,517 --> 01:19:46,607
YOU USED TO BE FUN.

1134
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:50,698

YOU CAN'T TAKE A JOKE.

1135

WHY DON'T YOU COME
IN AND TAKE A LOOK?

1144
01:20:21,728 --> 01:20:23,079

DO SOMETHING ELSE.

DREAMING ME DEAD.

I TELL HER
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS
