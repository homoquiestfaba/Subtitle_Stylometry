1
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,726
Hello?
Hello?

2
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,978
Christ.

3
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,619
Help!

4
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,453
Over here!

5
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:09,292
Help!

6
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,459
I couldn't find
any of you.

7
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,129
How far did we drift?

8
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,104
It was about
a kilometer maybe.

9
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,572
That's some
freaky pull.

10
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:24,634
You couldn't see anything,
just a load of bubbles.

11
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,440
I reckon he probably
got drunk

12
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,539
- and fell asleep on his lilo.
- We're too far out.

13
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,415
Jesus!

14
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,128
Christ.

15
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,973
We've come too far down.
We must have.

16
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,006
That's the hotel.

17
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,550
John, John!

18
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,932
Martha, where are you?

19
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,264
Hurry up, there may
be another wave.

20
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,133
No no no!

21
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,197
Wait! Ian!

22
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,582
John!

23
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,147
Dad, Dad!

24
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,919
Ian!

25
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,154
- Dad!
- John!

26
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,094
Martha!

27
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,959
Ian!

28
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:02,406
Oh my God.
Martha... Ian!

29
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,059
Daddy-- Daddy.

30
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,257
Hey, you.

31
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,170
- You forgot to post the paychecks.
- Oh no, I did it today.

32
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,196
Don't worry.
Look at that.

33
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,573
What do you think, sweetheart?
Look at that.

34
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,407
What do you think, baby?

35
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,107
Listen, take her.
I'm just going to check in.

36
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,446
Right.

37
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,941
What's first?
What are we doing first?

38
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,921
- Swimming.
- Swimming.

39
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,215
You have the passports,
darling?

40
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,862
Stop it.

41
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,422
Adam, help your brother.

42
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,627
Sa-wat dee kha.

43
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,930
Excuse me,
I was about to--

44
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,129
Uh...

45
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,436
That's fine.
Go ahead.

46
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,907
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

47
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,910
Merry Christmas.

48
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,673
- Carters.
- Yes, thank you.

49
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,317
- Don't embarrass me.
- Chill, Mom.

50
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,945
Come on,
bring the bags.

51
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,391
Hi!

52
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,731
Sorry, I'm late.

53
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,366
Hey, hey...
what are you doing?

54
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,969
You've lost a button.

55
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,002
Than! Get those plates
to table two.

56
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,708
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,620
Cheers,
my darling.

58
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,859
One two three--

59
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,733
Wobbly custard.

60
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,933
Oh, that's great.

61
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,371
That'll make
Granddad jealous.

62
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,278
I told you this would be
more fun than skiing.

63
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,304
I'm telling you again,

64
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,182
we came here to dive.

65
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,209
Shit.

66
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,515
Thank you.

67
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,855
Okay okay.
I'll go diving.

68
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,919
Are you sure they have
a mask that fits you?

69
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,555
Not too early.

70
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,131
You shouldn't tease
him like that.

71
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,229
It's his holiday too.

72
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,240
Two weeks
in a luxury resort--

73
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,401
that boy's got nothing
to complain about.

74
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,876
Oh, no no no.
Not that one.

75
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,780
I think that's us.

76
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,445
- I don't think Daddy likes that music.
- Yeah, let's go.

77
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,919
You won't get up in time.

78
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,751
What? Are you scared
of the water?

79
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,689
No, I'm not scared
of the water-- I told you.

80
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,351
- You're just like Dad.
- What?

81
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,951
- Seriously, no--
- Come with me.

82
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,825
No...

83
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,831
What do you reckon?

84
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,332
Ooh.

85
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,391
No rush hour and you
get to see dolphins.

86
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:53,633
Go on, you go.
I left my snorkel at home anyways.

87
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,072
Yeah?

88
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,577
Just...

89
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,411
don't get
eaten by sharks.

90
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,644
- There aren't any sharks.
- Oh yeah.

91
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,653
Whale sharks.
Native to Thailand.

92
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,521
Also known
as blah chalalam nah.

93
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,253
Hey hey hey.
No no no.

94
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,194
If you watched
a little bit more TV, see--

95
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,495
- you'd know.
- Blah belplsey?

96
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,934
No no no--
blah chalalam nah.

97
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,961
Blah blah blah.

98
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,419
- Hello, friend.
- Hi, hi.

99
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,391
- Not in bed yet?
- No-- just listening to the radio.

100
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,916
- I'm on my way home.
- Good night then.

101
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,643
Grandma...

102
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,619
You stink of fried fish.
Give me your shirt to wash.

103
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,821
- I have something for you.
- Thank you.

104
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,925
You're up early!

105
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,124
Hurry up-- you have
to go to school.

106
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,300
- Thank you, Grandma.
- Have a good day.

107
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,835
Goodbye.

108
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,813
Hurry-- eat up and then
you can go to school.

109
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,799
That's kind of doing it
for me actually.

110
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,206
Oh, no ice cream
before lunch.

111
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,181
What are you
on about?

112
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,739
Beach equals ice cream.

113
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,514
That's like toast
without butter.

114
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,445
No, I'm not
talking about Martha.

115
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,821
No no. You've got
to be kidding.

116
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,193
Oh, who are they?

117
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,666
That's us
swimming in the sea.

118
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,261
Oh yeah?
Where are the sharks?

119
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:47,534
- Shh.
- Come on. Teeth.

120
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,009
- Right, I'm off.
- All right.

121
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,914
In front.

122
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,946
In back.

123
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,633
Hello.

124
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,100
- Am I late?
- Don't worry, it's okay.

125
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,514
What are you
looking at?

126
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,038
Come on--
clear the tables.

127
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,176
Excuse me.

128
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,153
Could we wait
for my husband please?

129
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,781
Sorry, we really
have to get going.

130
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,519
Great.

131
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,493
- Hi, hello.
- Hi.

132
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,961
- Hello.
- Hello.

133
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,657
Bye, Mommy.

134
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,799
Bye, Mommy.

135
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,027
So we're going
to say hello to Mommy.

136
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,194
- Mommy!
- Hello hello.

137
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,726
- Hello, Mommy.
- Bye bye.

138
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,329
Come on, hurry up!

139
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,381
You gonna say hello
to Granddad?

140
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,475
- Hello, Granddad.
- Hello, Granddad.

141
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,580
The fish are all funny.

142
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,352
Yeah.

143
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,054
- Daft buggers.
- Buggers?

144
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,120
Hey, don't let your mother
hear you say that, okay?

145
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,133
Come on, oh, seriously.
Seriously, all right?

146
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,399
Let's go get
your water wings.

147
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,066
John!

148
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,503
Why the hell
didn't Mom wake us?

149
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:11,038
- She did but we ignored her.
- What?

150
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,517
What's happened
to the sea?

151
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,350
It's cool.

152
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,895
What fish
is Nemo?

153
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,836
- Well, he's blue so--
- Orange.

154
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,603
- Well, he's blue so--
- Orange!

155
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,738
- Hi.
- Good morning.

156
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,577
- I'd have Nemo with chips.
- No, Daddy.

157
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,881
A little bit
of ketchup. Oh...

158
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,405
What's happening, Daddy?

159
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,242
Daddy Daddy?

160
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,740
Come on!

161
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,718
Get in, get in! Come on!

162
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,912
Daddy, Daddy.

163
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,830
Don't let go!

164
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,698
Don't let--

165
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,002
Martha!
Hold on!

166
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,377
Martha, hold on!

167
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,376
Daddy!

168
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,946
- Daddy!
- Martha, hold on!

169
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,583
- Hold the tree!
- Daddy, save me!

170
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,422
Hold it, Martha!
Hold the--

171
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,690
- Daddy!
- Hold the tree! Grab the tree!

172
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,890
Grab the tree!

173
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,762
Hold on, Martha!

174
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,290
That's it, baby!
Hold on!

175
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,565
Hold on!
Hold on!

176
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,797
Hold on!

177
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,166
Hold on!
Hold on, baby!

178
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,677
Hold on!
Hold tight!

179
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,079
- Mommy!
- Hold on, Marth--

180
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,758
Guys, guys.
A bit of hush in the back.

181
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,663
Thank you.

182
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,692
So I've asked myself,
how is it

183
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,399
that I've ended up lumbered
with you lot over Christmas?

184
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,100
I mean, what a ragbag collection
of waifs and strays we are.

185
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,874
You know, we're going to be
found out one of these days.

186
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,381
I mean, just look at it.

187
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,543
As many of you know,
my ex-wife used to say,

188
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,746
"You might as well
be married to the job."

189
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,347
All I can say is
it's been a very happy affair.

190
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,858
And it's time for some
thank yous:

191
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,884
To the lovely Sue,
for keeping my diary in shape;

192
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:13,420
And to all of you who are
committed to working so hard

193
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,433
with the people
of Thailand.

194
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,662
I certainly couldn't do
my job without you.

195
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,403
So to those of us

196
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,898
- who haven't skived off on holiday...
- Hi.

197
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,036
...I'd like to raise
my glass of festive fizz

198
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,775
and wish you all
a very happy Christmas.

199
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,407
Happy Christmas!

200
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,348
Alec, this is Tom Philips,
who's recently joined us.

201
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,292
Hello, Tom.
Nice to meet you.

202
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:46,286
Lovely children, they're from the
coastal villages. Aren't they fantastic?

203
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,889
Absolutely charming.

204
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,435
I think the...

205
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,499
little one's meant to be
the evil twin.

206
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,907
Will you excuse me?

207
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,648
Reports are sketchy,

208
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,089
but it seems to have hit
Indonesia and Sri Lanka first.

209
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,922
- Bev?
- Drafting in everyone she can.

210
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,689
The phones have
gone ballistic.

211
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,787
And here, Patong
and possibly Krabi.

212
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,790
Ah, I've already had calls from CNN,
BBC World, and uh--

213
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,996
- Put London straight through.
- Sir.

214
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,631
Robert, Christine, both Peters
are out of the country.

215
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,800
Daniel and his girlfriend
are on holiday.

216
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,436
Well, call him in. We're gonna
need his input on this.

217
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,606
No one's answering.
They were staying near Phuket.

218
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,547
We're gonna need
more phone lines.

219
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,313
Get one of Hanuman's boys
to set that up as soon as possible.

220
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,843
The emails coming in
have crashed the system.

221
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,285
London...

222
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,295
line one.

223
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,691
Mark?

224
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,701
What have you got
for me?

225
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,362
Yes, I'm just looking.

226
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,175
Christ.

227
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,763
Yeah?

228
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,002
Nick, Nick,
turn on the TV.

229
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:41,342
Some kind of wave's
hit the south.

230
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,371
Chaku Chak Park,
10 minutes, okay?

231
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,280
Suk?

232
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,807
Simone wants us
to cover it.

233
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,252
Simone fired me,
right?

234
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,812
You got
your job back.

235
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,619
It's Christmas.
I swung it.

236
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,717
Don't be late,
they're closing the airport.

237
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,195
Where are we going?

238
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,994
Phuket. Look, I'm serious,
don't be late, okay?

239
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,043
Ah.

240
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,723
Help--

241
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,826
Help me!

242
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,497
Martha!

243
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,999
Somebody help me!

244
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,020
Martha!

245
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,059
Higher ground.

246
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,731
We have to go
higher ground.

247
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,208
- Martha!
- Maybe second wave coming.

248
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,040
There more wave.

249
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,909
Martha!

250
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,245
Everything gone.

251
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,729
Run, run!

252
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,430
We must get
to safe place.

253
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,233
She was holding
the tree.

254
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,502
Martha!

255
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,771
They have gone
to higher ground.

256
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,869
Please?

257
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,743
- If it come again--
- Martha!

258
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,823
Martha!

259
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,933
Martha!

260
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,812
Martha!

261
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,919
We take Jim's car.
Bev, Sue and the others will follow.

262
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,717
You sure there's
no way we can fly?

263
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,690
The runway at Phuket's
been hit pretty bad.

264
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,125
They've cleared a section.
There's a couple of flights

265
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,458
leaving Bangkok as we speak
but you won't make it.

266
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,589
I think the plan is
to shut it down completely

267
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,462
until they're sure
it's safe to land.

268
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,094
Oh, Kathy,
Kathy Graham, Rama Kids.

269
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,468
Ah, you head up
the Education Outreach.

270
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,029
Yeah.

271
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,871
Which brought you
your entertainment today.

272
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,647
Yeah, we're working with villages
all along the Phuket coastline.

273
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,842
We don't know how many
of them have been hit yet.

274
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,441
Joe, I'll drive.

275
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,181
I can't get through to any
of my colleagues down there.

276
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,680
12 hours is
the best I can do.

277
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,692
Well, 11 if you
know the back roads.

278
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,217
You will need to do press
along the way, sir.

279
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,560
BBC want a live link.

280
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,499
Rama Kids,
that a Christian organization?

281
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,264
Mm-hmm.
But I promise no smells,

282
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,533
bells or songs for the duration
of the journey.

283
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,401
Come on?

284
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,569
All right.
Okay, let's get going.

285
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,408
Yes, sir!

286
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,990
You can't mess
this one up, Nick.

287
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,591
Simone's still sore
from Burma.

288
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,694
She really made me sweat
to get you this gig.

289
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,568
All right.
It was one lost weekend.

290
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,937
It was a month.
I bailed you.

291
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,135
- What, are you still sore at me?
- Yeah.

292
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,475
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you very much.

293
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,224
She...

294
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,097
Where is it?

295
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,929
Have to get away.

296
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,458
If the wave
come again--

297
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,801
I can't just
leave her!

298
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,774
Martha!

299
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,252
Martha? Martha!

300
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,254
Please...

301
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,921
please... my son.

302
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,395
Jesus Christ.

303
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,042
John.

304
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,077
John.

305
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,776
He need to go
to hospital.

306
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,308
John.

307
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,849
Please?

308
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,086
My wife...

309
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,720
was in the water.

310
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,724
I have to find them.

311
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,864
No, I have
to find them.

312
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,932
They look for you
on higher ground.

313
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:47,172
Everyone moving
to higher ground.

314
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,150
John.

315
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,750
One, two...

316
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,732
One, two, three!

317
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,464
Where are they?

318
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,232
One, two...

319
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,832
Susie!

320
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,169
Susie!

321
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,212
Were you with my wife?

322
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,383
Khao Lak?
On the boat?

323
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,585
Khao Lak!
Were you on the boat?

324
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,949
- Was there any kind of warning sign?
- You could hear it.

325
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:46,089
Like lots and lots
of crashing glass. We just ran.

326
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,860
And you said
that the wave...?

327
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,164
The wave was high. Three--
three floors, something like that.

328
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:54,262
Mm-hmm.
Hang on one sec.

329
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:59,105
- Simone?
- Welcome back. No fuckups this time.

330
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,009
Yeah.

331
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,604
Hang on a sec.

332
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,415
Yeah, Phuket Airport,
scenes of exodus

333
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,181
synonymous with
a war-torn country;

334
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,120
Evacuation flights

335
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,386
so far being laid on
only by the Thais.

336
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,256
Nothing in or out
until the end of the day.

337
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,761
There's talk of another wave,
currently unfounded,

338
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,492
though it looks like this one ricocheted
down the coast.

339
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,092
Uh, we're talking...
10 feet.

340
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,761
15 feet.

341
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,270
Maybe more, actually.

342
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,899
Z.N.P. are reporting figures of 10,
maybe 20 were students?

343
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,806
Z.N.P. are talking
out of their ass.

344
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,038
We're the first
foreign press down here.

345
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,207
There's a couple of local news crews.
They got some interviews.

346
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,240
Okay, I want
casualty figures,

347
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,752
numbers of dead.

348
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,515
Nick?

349
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,455
Simone?

350
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,856
- Nick!
- My cell's fucked.

351
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,921
What's that?

352
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,058
Best I could do.
Come on, get in.

353
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,934
Phuket's
the nearest hospital.

354
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,905
Get some shots
over there.

355
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,707
Stop leaning so far back,
you're pulling us over.

356
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,373
Shut up and drive.

357
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,418
You--

358
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,896
you served us
at the hotel, yeah?

359
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,359
I was with my daughter.
She's--

360
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,768
she's about
this high.

361
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,502
Cocoa Pop, banana...

362
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,036
play under table.

363
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,674
Yeah.

364
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,312
I told her to hold on.

365
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,686
She was holding on.

366
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,660
My wife...
was diving.

367
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,955
If she was in the water
between 9:00 and 10:00 then...

368
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,567
What was it?

369
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,007
I don't even know
what it was.

370
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,605
He need to drink.

371
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,513
There you go.

372
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,854
My son...

373
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,725
John.

374
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,994
How is John?

375
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:42,463
My wife.
She was with Adam.

376
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,636
We need to get back
to the main road.

377
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,909
He has to get
to a hospital.

378
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,416
You must have relatives.
I have to find my family.

379
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,760
- Nice deep breath.
- Come on.

380
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,289
You need someone
to look at that cut.

381
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,961
My village back there.

382
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,971
My grandmother won't
leave without me.

383
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:17,099
You get to hospital,
look for wife and daughter.

384
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,144
See ya.

385
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,513
- Than.
- Thank you.

386
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,721
Has anybody
seen my wife?

387
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,886
She's dark-skinned.

388
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:40,659
She's got curly hair,
about 5'9"?

389
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:44,156
My daughter, uh...

390
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,193
Martha, Martha Carter.

391
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,728
She-- uh,
she's six years old.

392
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,333
I left her holding
a tree in Khao Lak.

393
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,606
She was wearing
a pink swimming costume.

394
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,840
Picked up baby
on the truck ahead.

395
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,110
About six years old?

396
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,140
Yeah, about six.

397
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,311
That's her.

398
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,983
We're-- we're on our way
down right now.

399
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:13,555
There's a Liverpudlian man,
he can't locate his wife or his son.

400
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,466
Well, perhaps you can
find a contact point?

401
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,164
I'm being told
Phuket town hall.

402
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,798
Now how far are you
from the--?

403
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,037
Well, perhaps if you
can find a hotel?

404
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,601
Yes, I see.

405
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,345
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I-- I am truly sorry,

406
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,543
I don't know what
you do tonight.

407
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:37,281
Until our systems are in place,
it's impossible for us to--

408
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,063
I can't afford to deal
with everyone individually.

409
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,999
- We'd get nowhere.
- Hang on. Here he is.

410
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,899
Who is it?

411
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,233
Ah, Miles, hi.

412
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,976
I'll go this way.

413
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,502
- Simone?
- The main cellphone networks are down.

414
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,665
- Where are you?
- Phuket-- Phuket Hospital.

415
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,368
Okay, what you got?

416
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,276
A number of Westerners dead.
I counted...

417
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,211
20 already.
I got thr-- three kids--

418
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,805
one, two, three,
four, five--

419
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,146
nine women, and...

420
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,617
well, the rest are men.

421
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:17,485
Age range between 20 and a couple
of really old guys.

422
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,853
Hey.

423
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,380
Yeah, thanks.

424
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,329
Red Cross.

425
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,457
Just drafting
in backup.

426
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,797
Nick, Nick!

427
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,142
Whoa.

428
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,612
Sorry.

429
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:45,207
I couldn't
hold on to him.

430
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,114
I couldn't.

431
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,812
It came up to
the third floor.

432
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,117
- Where were you, love?
- Khao Lak.

433
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,383
In Khao Lak?

434
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,220
Oasis Hotel,
Khao Lak.

435
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,053
Chai?

436
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,189
It's Khao Lak!

437
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,317
The relief's getting in,
why can't we?

438
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,953
What are you
hiding from us, mate?

439
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,759
Here.

440
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,826
Anybody here
lose family?

441
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,894
Anybody here lose family?

442
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:41,768
Are you
from an embassy?

443
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,206
My-- my daughter,
Martha Carter.

444
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:47,143
She's been seen in a truck up ahead,
and my wife Susan Carter.

445
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,475
I haven't found her yet.

446
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,980
Are you
from an embassy?

447
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,983
Did anybody actually
see the wave hit?

448
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,713
- Are you press?
- Yeah.

449
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,712
Go away.

450
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,797
- Go away!
- Chai?

451
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,766
Chai?

452
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,535
Hey!

453
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,543
Hey hey!

454
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,155
Jesus Christ.

455
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,517
Have you seen
my grandmother...?

456
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,489
- My sister's children?
- I found it.

457
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,057
I found it...

458
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,471
Ya?

459
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,162
Help... we need help.

460
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,126
- Please help us
- It's okay...

461
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,153
I'll get someone.

462
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:06,936
I'll get you some help.

463
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,534
Hey!

464
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,876
Easy, we're press.
We're press.

465
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,886
Let's go, let's go!
Nick!

466
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,048
Let's go.
Nick, come on!

467
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,004
Nick!

468
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,947
Nick, come here.
You okay?

469
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,181
Ah!

470
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,212
Let's go.
Nick, come on!

471
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:22,965
Ahhhh!

472
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,505
Jesus.

473
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,845
Where are they
taking them?

474
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,696
I don't know.
Come on, come on.

475
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,373
We've been
at the hospital.

476
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,644
They told us to come here.
Check your list again.

477
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,151
I'm looking for my father,
James Robert Peabody.

478
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,653
11th of the 11th, '60.

479
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:15,387
And my brother John David Peabody.
10th of the 9th, '88.

480
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,190
It's useless.

481
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,162
- Look at this place.
- Adam.

482
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,392
We just need
to keep searching.

483
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,799
Adam, don't--
excuse me.

484
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,374
Be careful.

485
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,690
I'll just be a minute.

486
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,593
I'll just be a minute.
I'm gonna check something.

487
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:24,417
There, Nick,
over there.

488
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,416
Chai.

489
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,505
Jesus.

490
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,370
It stinks.

491
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:13,467
You count Westerners,
I'll count Thai.

492
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,704
Okay okay.

493
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,683
Come on, man,
have some respect.

494
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,696
Your phone-- what
network are you on?

495
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,143
How much?
To buy your SIM-card?

496
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,942
No.

497
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:18,459
No no no!

498
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,733
No, you can't do this.
You can't burn these people.

499
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,899
You can't burn
these people.

500
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,772
Do their--
do their family know?

501
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:28,039
Do their family know?

502
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,773
- You okay?
- Take a photo!

503
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,747
Take a photo,
they're burning people!

504
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:34,444
They're burning...

505
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,918
Jesus.

506
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,615
Chai, take a picture.

507
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,987
Chai, take
the fucking picture.

508
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,199
Have you identified
these people?

509
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,564
Have you told
their families?

510
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,475
They're trying to stop infection.
There's too many of them.

511
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,375
Just take
the fucking picture, Chai.

512
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,607
There's plenty of shots
around the front.

513
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,445
Take the fucking picture.

514
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,247
- Take the fucking--
- Give it back, Nick!

515
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,947
- Give it back.
- Fuck you.

516
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,824
- Give it back.
- Fuck!

517
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,695
For fuck's sake.

518
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,098
This is what
they do, Nick.

519
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,864
They're monks.

520
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,498
What difference
does that make?

521
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,280
Nothing's moving.

522
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:40,875
The driver thinks there is
a small clinic in the hills.

523
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,284
In the other way.
They may have a doctor there.

524
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,448
No no, he needs a proper hospital.
He needs proper medical--

525
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,571
We should leave him here,
at the temple.

526
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,804
No.
They're burning bodies.

527
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:10,438
He won't be safe here.
His family...

528
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,311
they'll wanna bury him.

529
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,553
I have to find
my family.

530
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:22,187
Make sure he's okay.

531
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,523
His name's James.

532
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,860
He was staying
at the Khao Lak Oasis.

533
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,866
Don't leave him here.

534
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,899
Oliver! Go!

535
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,022
Run! Run!
The police are here!

536
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,286
It's just milk!

537
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,354
It's not for me.

538
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,833
I'm heading back
to my village.

539
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,426
There are people
trapped...

540
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,835
I can't find anyone
to help.

541
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:47,165
You've been stealing
from the tourists?

542
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,371
No-- they're
my grandmother's...

543
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,838
They took
her body away.

544
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,361
I'm looking
for my wife.

545
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,335
Oh...

546
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:58,433
I-I-- I saw... a bed,
it was empty.

547
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,516
Where do I go?

548
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,076
Ah...

549
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:44,609
Hang on a sec.

550
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:54,687
They're burning
unidentified bodies, Simone.

551
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,457
I saw... a woman,

552
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,489
a child.
I saw two men.

553
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,660
- Westerners?
- Yeah, Thais, too.

554
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,296
There's 50 or 60 bodies
lined up, ready to go.

555
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:11,102
- Okay, Chai got shots?
- Yeah, we'll send them to you now.

556
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,938
Shots from the beach,
give her those.

557
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,910
Back off, Nick.

558
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,037
They're burning
Westerners, Chai.

559
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:20,576
- They're dead.
- I got the shot.

560
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,881
- It's my camera.
- Those people have families, Chai.

561
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:25,888
You felt the heat today.
The monks have to protect the living,

562
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,822
and those bodies will
spread infection.

563
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,620
Yeah well, we like
our bodies in a box.

564
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,490
It's more than just
a souvenir to take home.

565
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:34,088
Families like
to gather together, say goodbye...

566
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:37,395
...maybe even say
the odd prayer.

567
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,129
It's what we
call a funeral.

568
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,763
Don't patronize me.
We syndicate that shot--

569
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:44,569
- It's a good shot.
- It says we don't care.

570
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:47,235
You don't get it because you don't
live your life like we do.

571
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:50,644
To us, the body is just a vessel,
what carries us through this life.

572
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,410
And when it dies, the spirit's
released into the next.

573
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,309
I'm sorry, Chai.

574
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:04,023
You saw the monks
helping people.

575
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,723
You saw them praying. But who cares
about that as long as you get the shot?

576
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,994
- It'll stop it.
- People will look at that shot,

577
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,501
and even though it's fine for you
to come here for holidays

578
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,833
and drop your tabs on the beach
and love the food, yeah?

579
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,169
- That shot--
- It'll make governments listen.

580
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,334
It slams us right back
into the Third World,

581
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,368
and that's fine for you.
You're not Thai.

582
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,711
I need a photo
of my wife and daughter.

583
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,654
I'm sorry?

584
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,987
I need to use
a phone.

585
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:36,457
Oh.

586
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,461
Here you go.

587
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:43,296
I sent one
to my dad yesterday.

588
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,733
Want me to do that
for you?

589
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,910
- It's U.K.?
- Yeah.

590
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,037
It's London.
0-2-0-7--

591
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,486
Mm-hmm.

592
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,435
Now it's ringing.

593
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,134
Hi, Dad.

594
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,220
Right.

595
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:42,622
BBC, CNN, Asian News,
they're all here.

596
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,355
Grab your powder puffs,
ladies.

597
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,392
Right, we need to get
our office set up.

598
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,434
Tony?

599
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,045
I'll set up a press briefing,
A.S.A.P.

600
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:06,048
No, I'd like to hit the hotel first.
Maybe a quick debrief.

601
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,573
Make sense of how
we're gonna coordinate things.

602
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,347
You're kidding,
right?

603
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:13,446
Tony, you're not going to be seeing
a hotel room for quite awhile.

604
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,959
They have it
upstairs.

605
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:30,837
Okay?

606
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,673
Well, the Aussies look
pretty settled.

607
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:43,481
Where do we sit?

608
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,149
I think people have got a grip
on what's actually happened here.

609
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,283
Excuse me,
excuse me.

610
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:52,158
Joe, clear all that stuff,
will you?

611
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:55,360
Are you
from the British consul?

612
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,059
Look, we're gonna need
some sort of flag--

613
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,499
- Helen!
- Maybe some notepaper.

614
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,901
And coffee--
I'm gonna need coffee.

615
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,666
Where the fuck
have you been?

616
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,605
I lost my son
and my daughters.

617
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,508
All right, all right, one at a time,
please. Just one at a time.

618
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,342
Joe, Joe, Joe!

619
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,145
What's your name, sir?

620
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:18,582
We're-- we're gonna need
some more volunteers.

621
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,111
All right, all right,
please--

622
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,825
Thanks.

623
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:40,774
We were just standing
on the beach.

624
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,643
We went back 'cause--

625
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,080
my wife...

626
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:48,413
she always wants her
to wear her water wings.

627
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,687
She was holding on
to a tree.

628
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,293
She's only six,
but she's--

629
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,595
she's got a real
strong grip.

630
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,704
What do you think?

631
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,104
She was holding on
to a tree.

632
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:23,752
I'd say your kid's
still alive.

633
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:39,332
"I'd say your kid's
still alive"?

634
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:03,886
...arriving here
in the disaster zone.

635
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:06,190
Britain's representative,
Tony Whittaker,

636
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:09,665
arrived early this morning,
and is here with me now.

637
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:12,463
Do you as yet
have any figure

638
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,970
as to how high the death toll
could climb?

639
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,165
It's really too early
to say, but what is clear

640
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:19,367
is that this is
a catastrophe for Thailand,

641
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,536
and indeed the whole
of the Andaman Coast.

642
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:24,478
Right now, we're trying to assess
which areas have been worst hit.

643
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,880
- Khao Lak looks very bad.
- Are you aware that bodies

644
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,384
are being burned in the temple
just outside of there?

645
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:32,047
- There are a number of rumors--
- No, I've seen the bodies.

646
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:35,148
Westerners and Thais being
cremated without identification.

647
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:38,592
I-- I'm following it up.
But, it's my understanding

648
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:41,222
that no Western bodies
are being cremated.

649
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,061
Their focus is very much

650
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:46,068
on the identification,
preservation and return

651
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,468
- of those bodies to loved ones.
- The Thai government--

652
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:51,098
That's really all we have time for.
There's a lot to do.

653
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,869
Get London
on the phone.

654
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,368
Excuse me?
Excuse me, I'm--

655
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,813
we're-- I'm trying to find
my husband and my son,

656
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:02,374
but nobody-- nobody seems
to know where we should be.

657
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,716
Have you tried talking
to your tour operator?

658
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:07,814
I don't have a tour operator.
We organized this holiday ourselves.

659
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:10,257
We're hoping to arrange
some evacuation flights,

660
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:12,227
but at the present
it's impractical.

661
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:13,455
Is that Mark?

662
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,828
- Uh--
- Mark?

663
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:17,560
Nice one, Mom.

664
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,163
If you can
head back to Krabi,

665
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:25,766
I'll head up as far North
as I can.

666
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:28,641
Let's cover five villages
each today.

667
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:31,647
That's fifteen between us.

668
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:33,649
Hi, Kathy speaking.

669
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,150
Mm-hmm?

670
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:37,209
I'm looking for my father
and my brother.

671
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,515
Here, take this.

672
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,351
I don't want
a bar of soap.

673
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:41,913
Adam, look,
calm down.

674
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,687
They could be dead.

675
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:45,990
Hey hey.

676
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:47,518
I don't need
a bar of soap.

677
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,258
No, but you do
need some sleep.

678
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:51,528
Across the street and to the left,
they've opened up

679
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,797
the college gym.
You can get a bed and a hot shower.

680
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:55,667
You should take
all you can right now.

681
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:57,570
You don't know how long
it's gonna last.

682
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,098
Thank you,
thanks.

683
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,940
It's James...

684
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,239
sorry.

685
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,611
It's okay.

686
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:06,910
James Robert Peabody.

687
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,441
11th of the 11th, 1960;

688
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:13,353
and John David Peabody,
10th of the 9th, '88.

689
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,254
Yes, they're
on the list.

690
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,054
Okay.

691
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,255
Thank you.

692
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:26,293
Next, please.

693
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:28,826
We're moving.
Joe's found us a proper office

694
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,862
around the corner
with air conditioning.

695
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,534
You got room
for another one?

696
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:34,236
It's really just
for U.K. use.

697
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,774
I've got 600 children
missing, Tony.

698
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,340
So far I know 12 of them
are still alive.

699
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,550
It's a bit
rough and ready.

700
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,783
"Chaos is a friend
of mine."

701
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,519
It's Bob Dylan.

702
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,888
So what are you saying?

703
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,922
No one's
picking up the story.

704
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:58,831
You're kidding me?

705
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:00,961
There are no Westerners
on the photo.

706
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,198
There was a woman,
she had light brown hair...

707
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:04,763
she's probably
European.

708
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:07,742
Yeah, she looks black,
bloody and dead.

709
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:11,076
Look, your word isn't enough
for anyone to print it. It's too risky.

710
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,411
They're burning Thais.
Adds up to the same thing.

711
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,974
They're incinerating people
without identification.

712
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,816
It's been stopped.
Someone yelled at the Thais.

713
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,948
Reuters just
tipped me off.

714
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,356
The story's done.
Move on.

715
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,292
People need evidence.

716
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,159
I gave you evidence.

717
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:29,596
Next Christmas
I'm going to Malibu.

718
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,660
This is
a 20-minute walk.

719
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,760
15 if you're brisk.

720
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:11,534
You're not worried that people
won't be able to find you?

721
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,506
Phone sockets,
internet points.

722
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:19,002
We've got more volunteers arriving
tomorrow. They'll need every line.

723
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:22,984
We can field calls, relatives
can make "missing" posters.

724
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,317
You'll need a contact point
in every hospital.

725
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:27,584
Yeah, I think if we
make this our base...

726
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,353
Khao Lak is over
an hour away.

727
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:32,827
It's a long way to walk
if you've lost your family

728
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:35,160
and all your money
and don't speak Thai.

729
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:39,398
Just an observation.

730
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:44,402
Good good.
If you want to get some tea going?

731
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,671
Call's just come through.
Attaché's arriving at 4:00.

732
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,773
Hello?

733
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,476
Yeah.

734
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,187
I'm lost.

735
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:10,562
Come.
Come sit down.

736
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:14,228
I need to get back
to my village!

737
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:18,206
There are people
trapped...

738
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,107
Please...
Please let me out.

739
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,400
Is this it?

740
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:51,304
Came through
from your dad.

741
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:58,675
Shall I?

742
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:17,196
They're some
of my kids.

743
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:19,428
I work with
an education program,

744
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,561
mainly in
the fishing villages.

745
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:24,129
Those are the ones
we've found so far.

746
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,903
- That's good.
- It's a start.

747
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,251
Maybe you should try
and get some sleep?

748
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,161
Ian!

749
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,864
Oh my God!

750
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,038
Susan!

751
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,240
Susan, I thought
you were dead.

752
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:38,007
I thought-- I thought you--
I thought you were dead.

753
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,981
The boat came back,
everything was gone.

754
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,643
Everything--
the chalet, the hotel,

755
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:44,915
it was all gone.
Where's Martha?

756
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,717
Where's Martha?
She was with you.

757
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:50,316
We were-- we were coming back
to the hotel. She got hold of a tree,

758
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,054
I don't know where she is.

759
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:56,588
No no, she's alive.
Susan, Martha's-- Martha's alive.

760
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:59,430
This guy, he said he
saw her, just outside--

761
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,629
- What guy saw her?
- This guy.

762
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,968
She wasn't letting go.

763
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:07,806
Nothing was gonna
make her let go, see?

764
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:10,978
She's alive.
We're gonna find her.

765
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:13,846
Baby...

766
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:16,943
- never leave me again.
- No.

767
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,454
You never leave me.

768
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,750
Oh no.

769
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,005
We're gonna
find her, baby.

770
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,842
We're gonna find her.

771
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,332
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hey, Nick.

772
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,739
Ron.

773
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:15,437
Wanker.

774
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:18,340
Here.

775
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,109
Thanks.

776
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:29,421
How come is all the
palm trees still standing

777
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:30,982
and the buildings
are gone?

778
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:33,392
There you are.
Do we have a rebuilt timeline?

779
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:34,919
Too early to tell.

780
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:37,558
- You've got figures?
- 700 missing.

781
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,593
At Khao Lak Oasis,
the occupancy was around 300.

782
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,901
Jesus.

783
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:47,901
I need to get
more information.

784
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,043
Right.

785
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,115
Let's go.

786
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,521
- Let's go.
- I'm not done.

787
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,788
You okay?

788
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:51,839
Here.

789
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:54,240
Put some of this
around your nose.

790
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:56,301
It helps
with the smell.

791
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:57,869
Thanks.

792
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:09,286
Ellen. Ellen Webb.

793
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:13,193
I work for S.Q.A. Hotels,
managing their properties down here.

794
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:16,720
Nick Fraser,
East Asia Press.

795
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:22,195
I was just here
a couple of weeks ago.

796
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:27,436
We've got hotels
all over the world, but this place--

797
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:28,909
Mm.

798
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:30,844
this was really special.

799
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:36,440
People come here to forget the shit
in their lives and then this happens.

800
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,715
700 missing guests,

801
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:42,554
that's a lot of unpaid
room service, isn't it?

802
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:45,321
That's not
what I meant.

803
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:48,797
Will you be offering some kind
of compensation package?

804
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,793
I just manage
the properties.

805
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,779
I just gotta--
I've just gotta see someone.

806
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:24,095
- Hi.
- Hi.

807
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:27,330
We were staying
at the same hotel.

808
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,599
Yeah.

809
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:42,244
Everyone is calling this
a natural disaster.

810
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,216
I don't know what's natural
about something

811
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,281
that flips
the world on its head.

812
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:56,022
People monitor earthquakes,
don't they?

813
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,962
It doesn't make sense.

814
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,942
Your husband's dead.

815
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:23,247
He, um, he died en route
to the hospital.

816
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,227
Yesterday.

817
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:29,253
About...

818
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,459
it was late.

819
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,162
I don't know
where his body is.

820
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,068
I had to leave him

821
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:39,937
just north of Khao Lak.

822
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:43,436
I'm sorry.

823
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:46,314
Mom!

824
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:48,714
There's a John Peabody
at Takua Pa Clinic.

825
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,147
He's injured, but--

826
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:53,586
Please...

827
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:55,613
don't tell my son yet.

828
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,522
Please.

829
01:14:57,559 --> 01:15:01,656
We're going that way.

830
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:37,021
Someone said they're
burning the bodies.

831
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,431
What do you mean?

832
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:43,563
The monks.
They're trying to clear space.

833
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:47,006
- There's too many dead--
- Adam. Stop it.

834
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:50,478
- Dad's not here.
- We need to take care of John now.

835
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,343
Dad was half cut
when we left him.

836
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,474
It probably hit him
when he was still in bed--

837
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:04,758
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I'm sorry.

838
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:07,523
- Dad'll be okay.
- I have to go.

839
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,333
Take it, take it.

840
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:16,269
Susan, Susan!

841
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,271
Susan!

842
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:24,543
We need to deal
with John now.

843
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,610
And Daddy...

844
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:36,213
he'd want me
to look after John.

845
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:44,393
Susan! Don't go
in there, babe.

846
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:50,031
What if she's dead, Ian?
What if they've burned her body?

847
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:52,905
Well, you'd just
left the beach.

848
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,239
You'd already--
you'd already been swimming.

849
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,972
She was wearing
her water wings.

850
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:59,879
No, we were going back
to the room. I'd left them in the room.

851
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:01,576
She wasn't wearing them?

852
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,017
I had her
in my arms.

853
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:05,883
You let go?

854
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:12,559
She got hold
of a tree.

855
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:15,324
If we go back...

856
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:19,531
You didn't feel it,
Suze.

857
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:21,593
You couldn't.

858
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:26,131
If we go back
to the tree...

859
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,708
Come on, baby.

860
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:33,738
We'll find her,
we'll find her, baby.

861
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:40,252
Come on, come on.

862
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:42,153
Come on.

863
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,384
Careful.

864
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,763
Excuse me?

865
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,599
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
I'm looking for my son?

866
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:11,037
Do you speak English?

867
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:12,835
Mom.

868
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:26,082
Tony. There's a boy
at a clinic in Takua Pa.

869
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:29,056
John Peabody, 16 years old,
he's badly injured.

870
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:32,253
His mother called while you were out
and she needs a flight evacuation.

871
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:34,558
There are spaces on the commercial
charters if need be.

872
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:36,063
Do people know that?

873
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:39,199
The second team
arrive tomorrow.

874
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:41,464
I'll post someone out there
as soon as it's feasible.

875
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,027
His mother's pretty
distressed.

876
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:45,801
We have limited resources, Kathy.
I have to coordinate the volunteers

877
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,536
- as best as I can.
- Yeah, I know but--

878
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,874
Why don't you just let me
get on with my job

879
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:52,072
- and you get back to yours?
- Kathy?

880
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:57,413
They've arrested some
of the villagers

881
01:20:57,452 --> 01:21:00,615
for looting food
and water.

882
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:11,629
I can get an official
down here.

883
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,293
One phone call.

884
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:20,573
Have they been given
food and water?

885
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:29,249
Does anyone need a lift
to their village?

886
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:41,692
I need to get
to Kaw Tai village...

887
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:48,033
They took
Grandmother's bracelets...

888
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:56,202
No, Mr. Whittaker's
not here at the moment.

889
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:57,802
What time
will he be back?

890
01:21:57,846 --> 01:22:00,246
He's on an inspection tour,
but there is an open meeting

891
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:02,716
tonight at the town hall
if you want to ask any questions.

892
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,811
Does anybody-- does anybody in the U.K.
even know what's happening here?

893
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:08,084
People can't get home.
We don't have any money.

894
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:09,715
We-- we can't find
our daughter.

895
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,192
You understand?
This is madness.

896
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:14,388
Ian, Ian!

897
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:20,565
She's at Takua Pa Clinic.

898
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:23,264
Oh my God.

899
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:25,273
It's her?

900
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,832
It's her.

901
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:29,173
It is her.

902
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,735
Come on.

903
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:37,712
Hey hey, Takua Pa?
Takua Pa.

904
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:39,310
Takua Pa.

905
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:51,930
I think he's just
dehydrated,

906
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:54,162
but he has a cut
on his side.

907
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:17,216
I'm going around
in circles.

908
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:22,059
Been calling
the help line.

909
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:26,627
They just say,
"Go to your embassy."

910
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:28,135
I'll see what
I can do but--

911
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,830
When Dad gets here--

912
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:32,339
Your dad's not
getting here, is he?

913
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:35,738
Who says?

914
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:39,178
Who says?

915
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:53,384
Adam...

916
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:04,666
Dad's--
Dad's dead, darling.

917
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:11,878
Okay.

918
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:16,809
Call them again.

919
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,487
What'll they do?

920
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:24,458
Give us another wash bag
and a mat in the gym?

921
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,821
I want someone here now.
Someone with authority.

922
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:32,856
Someone who can
get my son home.

923
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:35,426
These-- these two boys
are all I've got

924
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:38,633
and I will not lose
another member of my family.

925
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:41,665
Phuket town hall.
Tonight there's a meeting

926
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:43,472
for British survivors.

927
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:45,274
You're his mother.

928
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:49,477
There's no one better to convince them
if you want John on a flight.

929
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:05,096
You stay here with your brother.
Don't move.

930
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:07,693
All right?

931
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:32,287
Martha, Martha Carter?

932
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,989
Martha Carter--
she's down as, um, 573

933
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:38,021
- at your website.
- Over there.

934
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,468
Martha baby?

935
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:57,174
It's, uh, we're looking
at the wrong girl.

936
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,379
It's the wrong--

937
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:11,326
It's not her.

938
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,406
It looked like her.

939
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:29,917
- Photo all scratched up...
- Yeah.

940
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:32,442
She looked like her.

941
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:42,463
We could take her.

942
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:45,892
She's got no parents.

943
01:26:45,934 --> 01:26:48,459
Maybe she's lost her parents,
we could take her.

944
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:54,400
Susie, baby.

945
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:58,643
We can't take her, no.

946
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:03,848
I should never have
left Martha.

947
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:07,184
I should never have
left her with you.

948
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:20,259
That's a very pretty dress
that dolly has on.

949
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:25,633
You have a duck here.

950
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:30,703
That the duck
to kiss the dolly?

951
01:27:57,572 --> 01:27:59,938
You might want to change
to a Thai network, love.

952
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:01,168
Sorry?

953
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,769
I said you might want
to change to a Thai network.

954
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:05,779
For some reason,
their masts were barely hit.

955
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:08,111
Or you could use
the public phone.

956
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:10,379
But my friend might
be some time.

957
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:12,318
You've got a friend.

958
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:14,378
Yes, I have.

959
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:16,447
Technology's never
been my thing.

960
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:18,721
Anything technical,
I always defer to him.

961
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:22,188
First rule in life.

962
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:24,960
Always trust the geeks.

963
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:27,559
Thanks for the tip.

964
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:29,695
You are most welcome.

965
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,903
You know who he is?

966
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:42,108
Should I?

967
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,584
Maybe.

968
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:54,494
Hello, Dr. Meeko.

969
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:56,156
Boonma.

970
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:58,825
Look at you,
all smartened up.

971
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:00,834
Have a seat.

972
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:09,375
You've been waiting
for this moment a long time.

973
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,008
How can I help you?

974
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:19,643
On behalf
of the Thai government...

975
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:25,789
I've a proposition to make,
Dr. Meeko.

976
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:52,050
Than?
Be back in a sec.

977
01:29:53,154 --> 01:29:54,519
Hey hey.

978
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:58,324
I have to get back
to my village.

979
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:01,889
There are people
still alive.

980
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:03,362
I have to do something.

981
01:30:04,866 --> 01:30:06,993
The villagers have all
run to the hills.

982
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:09,059
Okay. Okay.

983
01:30:09,103 --> 01:30:11,128
Let's get you cleaned up.

984
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:12,935
I'll drive you down there.

985
01:30:12,974 --> 01:30:14,771
It'll be okay.

986
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:28,614
Holy shit.

987
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:11,590
Tony, the meeting's starting.
We've got to go.

988
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:13,719
Just coming.

989
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:24,436
I've been here since last night.
And what have you done? Nothing.

990
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:28,101
Please, I know you all have questions,
but in a natural disaster of this sort--

991
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:30,872
No. No.

992
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:33,107
No.

993
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:37,948
No, I last saw my daughter
36 hours ago.

994
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:43,388
She was screaming
for help.

995
01:32:43,424 --> 01:32:45,722
She was alone.

996
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,627
And she was afraid.

997
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:51,791
There is nothing natural
about any of this.

998
01:32:55,102 --> 01:32:57,400
- I appreciate--
- I want my daughter back.

999
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:02,675
I want her here,
and I want her now.

1000
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:06,703
You have to tell me
how to do this.

1001
01:33:08,215 --> 01:33:11,810
Because I'm not leaving
until you do.

1002
01:33:11,852 --> 01:33:14,787
Until all of us...

1003
01:33:16,157 --> 01:33:18,455
get our kids back.

1004
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:24,230
Believe me, I am going
to do everything I can to help you--

1005
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:26,597
My wife is dead.
I want her body back.

1006
01:33:26,634 --> 01:33:30,229
My-- my son is lying
in Takua Pa Clinic.

1007
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:33,638
He will die if he
isn't evacuated tonight.

1008
01:33:33,674 --> 01:33:37,201
Can you guarantee we're
gonna get our bodies back?

1009
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:41,078
As far we know, there are
up to 10,000 British nationals

1010
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:43,174
in Thailand at this time.
You can appreciate

1011
01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:45,913
they're trying to coordinate
with the Thai government

1012
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:49,286
and the other foreign embassies
to locate and identify

1013
01:33:49,323 --> 01:33:52,053
as many bodies as we can
as quickly as possible,

1014
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:55,995
and to repatriate people,
either to medevac...

1015
01:33:57,531 --> 01:34:00,125
...commercial flights
to get home as soon as possible.
