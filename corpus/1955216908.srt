00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:23,416
Opening day of a
brand-new water park, Squeaks.

7
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:26,791
Water slides, wave pools,
perfect weather...

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,416
Hello, ladies. After you.

9
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:37,374
- Me first.
- Sheesh...

10
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,416
Come on, Squeaks. Let's go
find a place to sit, huh?

11
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:46,166
These two chairs are perfect.

12
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,166
Me first.

13
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,374
Squeaks, I know I promised you

14
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,708
a fun day at Splash World.

15
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,791
But we need to address
the elephant seal

16
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:05,250
in the room first.

17
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,916
Hey, who do you think you are,

18
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:10,165
pushin' us into the water,

19
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,874
then stealin'
our chairs like that?

20
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,666
I'm Slugsworthy the First.

21
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:18,916
Like my father before me
and his father before him,

22
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:21,666
Slugsworthys are always first.

23
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,165
These are my chairs
'cause I saw them first.

24
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,999
Uh, just 'cause you
saw them first,

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,874
doesn't mean they're yours.

26
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,958
Oh, gee, I hadn't realized.

27
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,792
Let me make it up to you.

28
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,624
You can go first, Squeaks.

29
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,457
Sorry, gents, but it's my turn.

30
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:59,249
What are you talkin'... -I'm a
leader, not a follower, rabbit.

31
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,666
Me first. Whee!

32
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:04,542
Whee!

33
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,416
I'm chafing! Now I'm burning!

34
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:16,667
Now, I'm chafing and burning!

35
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:22,499
I got first-degree burns.

36
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,624
Wait till I get my... Whoa.

37
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:30,791
Babes. Hello, ladies.

38
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:33,207
Who wants the honors
of rubbing sunscreen

39
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,874
all over this beautiful body?

40
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,916
- Ew.
- Hey.

41
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:40,874
Well, their loss. I would've
done it first, anyway.

42
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,958
Hmm, where's that sunscreen?

43
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,250
Right here.

44
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,374
Hmm.

45
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,750
Is that a coffee-glazed ham?

46
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,375
Man, I was really bacon.

47
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,874
That Slugsworthy is
somethin' else, eh, Squeaks?

48
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,124
This is your favorite part
of the park?

49
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,207
- Move it.
- Look out!

50
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,582
Oh, my God!

51
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,833
Oh, man. I love water cannons.

52
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,959
A-ha!

53
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:59,917
Oh, no, I'm so scared
of your teeny-tiny squirt gun.

54
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,624
Tell you what,

55
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,249
this time, and this time only,

56
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,457
I'll let you go first.

57
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,541
Take your best shot.

58
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,165
Oh, that's convenient.

59
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,207
I'm sure his lips
are sealed. Get it?

60
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,249
Nobody makes a fool
of Slugsworthy the First

61
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,625
without getting
my permission first.

62
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,874
Squeaks.

63
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,667
Huh?

64
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,249
Huh?

65
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,208
Huh? Huh? Huh?

66
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,542
Ready, Squeaks?

67
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,625
Yoo-hoo.

68
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:09,083
Ha-ha. Now, I got you... Whoa!

69
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,333
This is a bad first.

70
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,165
Let's get 'em, boys!

71
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,542
Oh, no.

72
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:35,958
Look at that, Squeaks.

73
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:39,499
I can honestly say
that's a first.

74
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,374
Welcome, <i>madame.</i>

75
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,290
Ahem, the specials, please.

76
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,749
Just the specials.

77
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,333
Of course. May I recommend
the steak, <i>madame?</i>

78
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:59,290
It has been gently massaged
by seven shiatsu masters.

79
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,958
No, I'd eaten that before.

80
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,499
How about a thousand-year-old
quail's egg?

81
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,916
With baby field greens grown
in zero gravity

82
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:08,624
- on the international space station?
- Eaten it.

83
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,165
Have you had
the Harvard-educated unicorn

84
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,917
in 30-karat-gold sauce,

85
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,290
stuffed with crisp
thousand dollar bills?

86
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,457
Eaten it! Eaten it! Eaten it!

87
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,541
Query, what haven't I eaten?

88
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:22,040
<i>- Rabbit.</i>
- That's what I want.

89
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,833
But, madam, rabbit is the
only thing we do not have.

90
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:29,290
Query, find me the wildest,
freshest rabbit in town.

91
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,040
<i>Get out of your chair.</i>

92
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,917
<i>Walk 30 feet to door.</i>

93
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:39,916
<i>Turn right on Sixth Avenue.</i>

94
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:44,750
<i>In 14,577 feet turn left
at Albuquerque.</i>

95
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,207
I'm hungry, too, Squeaks.

96
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,374
But without our manners,

97
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,207
we're no better than animals.

98
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,583
There. Now, we can eat.

99
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,082
<i>You have arrived.</i>

100
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,332
And you are?

101
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm here for the rabbit.

102
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,290
Sorry, lady, but we're just about to...

103
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,958
Hey!

104
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,666
What do you think you are doing?

105
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,375
Done. Now clear this away
and bring me a menu.

106
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,624
If you're looking
for a restaurant,

107
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,999
you've come to the wrong place.

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,916
<i>This is the right place.</i>

109
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,207
Now, look, the only thing
left in the world

110
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,290
that I haven't eaten is rabbit.

111
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,040
I'm not leaving...

112
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,833
- ...until I've had
all the rabbit I can stand.

113
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,249
Why didn't she say so?

114
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,040
If rabbit is what you want,

115
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,542
rabbit you'll get.

116
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,500
But first, a person
of your eating expertise

117
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:38,749
will no doubt require
a battery of appetizers

118
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,583
to prepare the palette.

119
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,749
- Huh?
<i>- Voila!</i>

120
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,749
Ugh! What is all this?

121
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,207
We have a side of aged
cherry yogurt reduction

122
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,833
with a dusting of coffee
grounds and sofa crumbs...

123
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:53,457
Ugh! - ...Besides some
decomposed cantaloupe rinds

124
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,124
in a ketchup glaze, served

125
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,332
over a bit of crisp gas station receipts.

126
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,040
Finally, room temperature
fat trimmings... -Ugh.

127
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,666
Wrapped in a vinegar-soaked
paper towel,

128
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:06,082
all covered
in previously live ants.

129
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,833
<i>Bon appetit!</i>

130
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,207
These appetizers
aren't fresh at all.

131
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,541
Now, let's have that rabbit,

132
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,708
and I want to see it
before it's prepared.

133
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:16,874
I want it fresh.

134
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,833
You won't
be disappointed, ma'am.

135
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:20,917
I personally vouch
for the rabbit.

136
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,416
Pleased to meet you, doc.

137
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,082
Oh. Hello.

138
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,541
What you're getting here
is premium Grade A rabbit.

139
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:31,791
I see a therapist twice a week

140
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,249
and drink nothing
but mineral water.

141
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,666
I teach Pilates,
and my credit score is 836.

142
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,582
Well, that all
sounds exceptional.

143
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,791
Don't worry about me.

144
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,332
I volunteered for this.

145
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,624
It's an honor to serve.

146
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,708
But I've only got
one favor to ask.

147
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:49,000
It's my mom, you see.
I'm all she's got.

148
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,290
Would you mind checkin'
on her now and then?

149
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,624
Of course,
it's the least I can do.

150
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,874
You're a real piece of work.

151
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,750
I think I'm ready now.

152
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,582
I'm getting warmer.

153
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,624
I'm getting warmer. Oh...

154
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,207
That's hot!

155
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,207
I'm almost done now.

156
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,499
Here I go!

157
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,666
- Going, going, gone.
- No!

158
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,791
Rabbit, please for...

159
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:24,708
Oh! This is the worst
restaurant I've ever been to.

160
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,624
Where's the manager?

161
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,874
I'm not telling.

162
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,791
Query, where is the...

163
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:32,250
Uh, Query? Did you see my phone?

164
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,791
Is this it?

165
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:37,791
Query. Find me the manager
of this restaurant.

166
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:39,624
<i>Proceed 10 steps.</i>

167
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,625
Open the refrigerator.

168
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:42,708
Nicely done,
Squeaks.

169
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,041
The old switcheroo.

170
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,082
<i>Eat a jar of mayonnaise.</i>

171
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,834
Um, this will take me to
the manager's office? <i>-Yes.</i>

172
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,624
<i>Proceed to exit.</i>

173
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,874
<i>In 20 feet, eat a fried pickle.</i>

174
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,207
<i>- Continue 30
feet to food trucks.</i>

175
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,582
<i>Proceed to drink the grease
traps of each truck.</i>

176
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,207
<i>Take a spin
on the carnival ride.</i>

177
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,207
<i>- Proceed 30
feet to destination.</i>

178
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,374
<i>Arriving at destination.</i>

179
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,000
How can I help you, <i>madame?</i>

180
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,958
Ah, yes, the rabbit.

181
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,249
We'd like to make this right

182
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,165
by offering you
the full rabbit dinner

183
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,792
free of charge.

184
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,040
No, I just... Check, please.

185
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,874
Thank you.

186
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,375
And here's your phone.

187
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,457
Whenever you're ready, sir.

188
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,000
- Keep the change.
<i>- Merci, Monsieur.</i>

189
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:00,833
Don't mention it, my good man.

190
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,207
After all, without our manners,

191
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,082
we're just animals.
