1
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:15,699
Come here, crafty dwarf!
You shall be pitilessly pinched ...

2
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:19,779
... if you haven't finished
the fine-wrought gold on time

3
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:27,684
Let me go! lt's ready as ordered

4
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:35,925
- Why are you so slow to show it?
- Lest something was lacking

5
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:39,465
- What is not ready?
- Here ... and there

6
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:41,927
Give me the work!

7
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:08,526
See, scoundrel,
everything finished!

8
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:13,157
Did the simpleton seek
to deceive ...

9
00:01:14,636 --> 00:01:19,596
... and keep for himself the object
my craft taught him how to forge?

10
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:41,893
The helmet fits.
Will the spell work too?

11
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:50,664
''Night and mist, like to no one!''

12
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,011
Can you see me, brother?

13
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:04,476
Where are you? l cannot see you

14
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:09,784
Then feel me, rascal! Take that
for your thieving thoughts!

15
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:19,523
Thank you, stupid!
Your work has stood the test

16
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,440
Nibelungs, bow down to Alberich!

17
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:35,375
Now he is watching you everywhere
and rest is refused you

18
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:40,077
Work for him though he is unseen

19
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:44,189
You are his vassals for ever!

20
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:52,299
Listen for him, he is near,
the Lord of the Nibelungs

21
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:40,139
Here is Nibelheim.
What fiery sparks are flashing?

22
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:48,818
What is that among the rocks?

23
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,093
Why are you whimpering?

24
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:00,364
Hey, Mime! What torments you so?

25
00:04:02,404 --> 00:04:04,338
Leave me in peace!

26
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:10,437
More yet, l would help you, Mime!

27
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:28,362
l must obey my own brother
who brought these bonds on me

28
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:32,695
What gave him the power
to bind you?

29
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:44,770
Cunning Alberich wrought himself
a ring from the Rhine's gold

30
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:59,551
With it he has overcome us,
the Nibelungs' nocturnal race

31
00:05:03,064 --> 00:05:12,371
Carefree smiths, once we created
ornaments for our women ...

32
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:20,875
... and lightly laughed at our work

33
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:33,691
This villain compels us to creep
into caverns and toil for him

34
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:41,896
Through the ring his greed divines
where a new gleam is concealed

35
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:49,534
We have to dig it out, melt the
booty and forge the cast ...

36
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:59,416
... to pile up our master's hoard

37
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:07,552
Your idleness brought on his ire?

38
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,999
On me he forced the heaviest task

39
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,506
He bade me forge and weld a helmet

40
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:36,686
l noted what power
lay in the work l fashioned

41
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:43,529
l wanted to keep the helmet
and escape from Alberich's sway ...

42
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:50,296
... perhaps get him in my power ...

43
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:57,773
... and snatch the ring so that
l might be free and he my slave!

44
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:05,513
Why did you not succeed?

45
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:09,983
Though l fashioned the work ...

46
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:18,524
... l did not guess
the spell aright

47
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:29,233
He who planned the work
and snatched it from me ...

48
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,244
... has taught me
what cunning lay in the helmet

49
00:07:37,686 --> 00:07:42,646
He vanished from my sight,
but unseen his arm raised weals

50
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:49,286
That's what thanks l earned!

51
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,367
- Our capture will not be easy
- He will fall with your cunning

52
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:09,948
Who are you, then, strangers?

53
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:14,879
Friends. We will free the Nibelungs

54
00:08:23,131 --> 00:08:25,395
Beware! Alberich draws near

55
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:32,437
We'll wait here for him

56
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,940
ldle herd, pile up the hoard!

57
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:51,651
Put down the treasure!
Must l help?

58
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:59,094
Who is there?

59
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:04,736
Here, scamp! Have you
been chattering to these tramps?

60
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,002
Be off, idler! Back to your bench!

61
00:09:10,478 --> 00:09:15,438
Out of here, all of you!
Find me gold from the new veins!

62
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:22,979
My whip waits
for those that don't dig deep!

63
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:34,363
l am everywhere
though none can tell where

64
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:45,470
Are you still lingering?
Still loitering?

65
00:09:57,725 --> 00:10:01,161
Tremble, abject throng!

66
00:10:03,998 --> 00:10:09,868
Obey the master of the ring!

67
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,100
What do you want here?

68
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:55,276
From Nibelheim's land of night
we have heard new rumours

69
00:10:57,785 --> 00:11:04,452
Mighty marvels Alberich works.
Greed brought us as guests to gorge

70
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:14,925
Envy led you, that l well know

71
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:21,803
Do you know me well?
Who am l that you should snarl?

72
00:11:22,744 --> 00:11:29,149
ln your cave Loge smiled on you,
gave light and warming flames ...

73
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:33,382
... and fired your forge

74
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:40,857
l am your kinsman, was your friend.
You show little thanks

75
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:47,958
Loge smiles now with elves of light

76
00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:55,041
lf, false one, you're their friend
as you once were mine ...

77
00:12:00,448 --> 00:12:01,881
... l have nothing to fear

78
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:08,580
- You can have faith in me
- ln faithlessness not fidelity

79
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:14,490
But dauntlessly l defy you all!

80
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:18,893
Your power lends you assurance

81
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:23,330
Great has grown your strength

82
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:27,640
Do you see the hoard heaped up?

83
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:32,041
l never yet saw one so enviable

84
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:42,178
That is today's paltry pile.
lt will increase in the future

85
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:49,053
But Nibelheim is joyless ...

86
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:56,767
... and treasure can buy nothing

87
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,942
Nibelheim's night serves me
to create and conceal treasure

88
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:16,523
With the hoard in the cave
l intend to work wonders

89
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:24,057
l will win the world for my own

90
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:32,768
How will you start on that?

91
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:46,717
You who aloft in the breeze
live, laugh and love ...

92
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,620
... all you gods l'll grip
in my golden grasp!

93
00:14:08,276 --> 00:14:14,215
As l renounced love ...

94
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,681
... all shall renounce it!

95
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:35,394
Allured by gold,
for gold alone shall you hunger

96
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:54,283
On radiant peaks you live in bliss

97
00:15:03,097 --> 00:15:11,129
The black gnome you despise,
you eternal revellers!

98
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,849
Beware!

99
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:37,457
When you men serve my might the
dwarf will take his pleasure ...

100
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:45,330
... with your pretty women,
though love does not smile on him

101
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:51,408
Did you hear?

102
00:15:55,116 --> 00:15:59,246
Beware when the Nibelung horde ...

103
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:07,088
... rises from the depths
to the light!

104
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,696
- Blasphemous fool!
- What?

105
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:16,462
Keep your head!

106
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:26,278
Faced with Alberich's work
who would not feel wonder?

107
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:33,981
lf you win, with your treasure,
all you demand ...

108
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:39,126
... l must acclaim you
the mightiest

109
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:44,864
Moon, stars, and radiant sun ...

110
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,693
... can do no other but serve you

111
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,232
But ...

112
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:05,210
... l deem it significant
that those who heap the hoard ...

113
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:12,515
... obey you ungrudgingly

114
00:17:16,597 --> 00:17:19,964
Boldly you fingered a ring ...

115
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:29,574
... before which they trembled

116
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:39,519
But if a thief by stealth ...

117
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:44,282
... snatched the ring?

118
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:52,723
How would you guard yourself?

119
00:17:55,803 --> 00:18:00,103
Loge thinks himself most artful

120
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:07,407
Others seem stupid to him

121
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:19,283
That l should need his counsel,
the thief would rejoice to hear

122
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:30,294
l conceived the concealing helmet
and had Mime fashion it for me

123
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:44,875
The helmet allows me
to change my shape at will

124
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:57,526
No one can see me, yet l am
everywhere

125
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:13,369
l can live safe even from you ...

126
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,511
... kind, considerate friend!

127
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:31,529
l have seen many strange things,
but never witnessed such a wonder

128
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:38,237
l cannot credit this unique work

129
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,100
Were this possible,
your power would last for ever

130
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:50,950
- Do you think l lie like Loge?
- Until l see for myself

131
00:19:52,686 --> 00:19:54,779
The fool is bursting with wisdom

132
00:19:56,857 --> 00:20:01,260
Now may envy devour you!
ln what shape shall l appear?

133
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:03,330
Whatever you will

134
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:07,160
Strike me dumb with astonishment!

135
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:26,410
Giant serpent, curl and coil!

136
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:26,206
Oh, do not swallow me!
Spare Loge's life!

137
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:34,612
Good, you villain! How quickly
the dwarf turned to a dragon!

138
00:21:51,972 --> 00:21:55,169
Do you believe me now?

139
00:21:56,977 --> 00:22:00,469
My trembling testifies to it

140
00:22:05,753 --> 00:22:09,450
Now that l have seen it
l readily believe the marvel

141
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:18,788
But can you make yourself tiny?

142
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:23,401
That would be the subtle way
to escape danger

143
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:26,606
But that would be too hard!

144
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:31,439
How small shall l be?

145
00:22:32,713 --> 00:22:36,740
So that a crevice might hold you
where a toad timidly hides

146
00:22:37,818 --> 00:22:38,785
Nothing simpler!

147
00:22:41,322 --> 00:22:43,313
Watch me!

148
00:22:51,398 --> 00:22:55,960
Crawl, crooked grey toad!

149
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,752
Seize it quickly!

150
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:27,155
- l am captured!
- Hold him till l tie him!

151
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:35,601
Up we go. There he will be ours

152
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,328
Sit tight there, kinsman!

153
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:28,239
Look, there lies the world
that you wanted to win

154
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:35,339
What spot, tell me,
will you allow for my sty?

155
00:27:42,022 --> 00:27:51,226
Rogue! Ruffian! Loosen my
bonds or you'll rue this outrage!

156
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:57,732
You are caught in my chains

157
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:07,245
You fancied the world lay
in your power

158
00:28:15,322 --> 00:28:19,053
Wretch, you cannot deny it!

159
00:28:20,794 --> 00:28:24,628
To free you a ransom is demanded

160
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:33,101
Dolt l am, to trust this trick!
Terrible vengeance l vow!

161
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:38,075
First you must set yourself free

162
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:45,015
To a fettered man
no free soul makes amends

163
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:53,655
lf you relish thoughts of revenge,
first think about the ransom

164
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:04,400
- Say what it is you want
- The treasure and your gold

165
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,838
Greedy gang of rogues!

166
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:15,878
But if l keep the ring
l could spare the treasure

167
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:23,922
New wealth would soon be won
at the ring's command

168
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:31,420
l shall not pay too dear
if the lesson costs only baubles

169
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,774
- Will you yield the treasure?
- Loosen my hand and l'll summon it

170
00:30:15,642 --> 00:30:18,770
l have called the Nibelungs

171
00:30:21,982 --> 00:30:26,646
l hear them hauling
the hoard from the depths

172
00:30:30,123 --> 00:30:31,556
Now loosen my bonds!

173
00:30:33,126 --> 00:30:36,095
Not until all has been paid

174
00:30:57,184 --> 00:31:01,678
Oh humiliation that my slaves
should see me captive!

175
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:09,685
Bring it in as l command!
Pile the hoard into a heap!

176
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:15,060
Don't glance over here!
Quick there, quick

177
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:20,028
Then get back to your labour!

178
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:26,979
Woe betide if l find you idle!
l am following at your heels

179
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:04,179
l have paid. Now let me depart

180
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:12,916
And the helmet that Loge holds,
now kindly give back to me

181
00:32:16,196 --> 00:32:18,187
This belongs to the ransom

182
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:21,028
Accursed thief!

183
00:32:23,703 --> 00:32:25,568
But patience!

184
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,140
He who made it can make another

185
00:32:30,944 --> 00:32:33,606
Mine is the might that Mime obeys

186
00:32:35,816 --> 00:32:43,723
Yet it's hard to leave
my weapon to my foes

187
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,465
Alberich has left you everything.
Now, bullies, loosen my bonds!

188
00:32:59,606 --> 00:33:02,837
Shall l untie him?

189
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:09,540
A golden ring rests on your finger

190
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:15,278
- That belongs to the hoard
- The ring?

191
00:33:17,157 --> 00:33:23,756
- To be freed you must forfeit it
- My life, but not the ring!

192
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:28,998
l require the ring.
With your life do what you will!

193
00:33:30,136 --> 00:33:34,038
l lose limb and life
if l must lose the ring too

194
00:33:35,242 --> 00:33:40,646
Hand and head, eye and ear
are not more my own than this!

195
00:33:45,685 --> 00:33:48,984
You call the ring your own?

196
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,681
Are you raving, shameless gnome?

197
00:33:54,261 --> 00:34:00,200
From whom did you take the gold
from which you made the ring?

198
00:34:02,202 --> 00:34:08,198
Was it your own,
that you stole it from the depths?

199
00:34:10,343 --> 00:34:12,311
Ask the Rhine's daughters ...

200
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:19,345
... whether they gave you
the gold you robbed

201
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:26,748
Base trickery! Vile deceit!

202
00:34:28,895 --> 00:34:33,923
Do you throw on me the blame
for what you so dearly desired?

203
00:34:36,036 --> 00:34:40,496
Gladly you would have robbed
the Rhine of its gold ...

204
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:46,075
... had you so easily
found the way to forge it!

205
00:34:49,282 --> 00:34:52,843
How well it worked for you ...

206
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:59,752
... that l, in shame and fury ...

207
00:35:00,827 --> 00:35:06,766
... gained the terrible magic
whose work now gladdens you!

208
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:15,064
Must this fatal, fearful deed ...

209
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:24,047
... serve you as a royal toy,
my curse serve for your pleasure?

210
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:32,519
Take heed, haughty god!

211
00:35:38,665 --> 00:35:42,157
lf l sinned it was against myself

212
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:51,403
But you sin against all that was,
is and shall be ...

213
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:55,872
... if you seize my ring!

214
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:00,249
Surrender the ring!

215
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:06,755
No right to it can you prove

216
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:24,803
Crushed!

217
00:36:27,714 --> 00:36:28,874
Shattered!

218
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:38,120
Of wretches the wretchedest slave!

219
00:36:45,231 --> 00:36:52,467
Now l possess what will make me
the mightiest of mighty lords!

220
00:37:07,587 --> 00:37:08,554
ls he to go?

221
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:11,747
Set him free!

222
00:37:26,005 --> 00:37:31,409
Slink off home! No knot holds you

223
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,919
Am l free?

224
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:49,926
Truly free?

225
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:05,644
Then thus l give you
my freedom's first greeting!

226
00:38:16,823 --> 00:38:25,925
Since by curse it came to me,
accursed be this ring!

227
00:38:31,704 --> 00:38:36,437
Since its gold gave me might ...

228
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:45,876
... may its magic bring death
to whoever wears it!

229
00:38:48,855 --> 00:38:53,417
lt shall gladden no happy man

230
00:38:55,395 --> 00:39:00,196
lts gleam shall light
on no one lucky!

231
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:12,874
Whoever possesses it
shall be consumed with care ...

232
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:19,079
... whoever has it not
shall be gnawed with envy!

233
00:39:23,456 --> 00:39:31,921
Each shall itch to possess it,
but none shall find in it pleasure!

234
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:37,360
lts owner shall guard it
profitlessly

235
00:39:39,038 --> 00:39:43,407
Through it he shall
meet his executioner!

236
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:53,511
Forfeit to death, faint with fear
shall he be fettered

237
00:39:55,154 --> 00:40:00,421
The length of his life
he shall long to die ...

238
00:40:01,894 --> 00:40:08,265
... the ring's master to
the ring a slave ...

239
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:23,905
... until again l hold
in my hand what was stolen!

240
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,999
Thus in direst distress ...

241
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,999
... the Nibelung blesses his ring!

242
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:06,690
Keep it now, guard it well!

243
00:41:09,662 --> 00:41:15,999
My curse you cannot escape!

244
00:41:48,868 --> 00:41:53,271
Did you heed his fond farewell?

245
00:41:55,975 --> 00:41:58,705
Let him give vent to his fury

246
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:42,381
Fasolt and Fafner are approaching

247
00:42:46,392 --> 00:42:49,759
They are bringing Freia back

248
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:17,586
- They have returned
- Welcome, brother!

249
00:43:19,325 --> 00:43:21,759
Do you bring good tidings?

250
00:43:23,563 --> 00:43:29,229
We carried out the task.
There lies what will free Freia

251
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:38,638
From the giants' grasp
our fair one approaches

252
00:43:41,314 --> 00:43:46,445
The breeze breathes on us again

253
00:43:48,221 --> 00:43:53,352
Bliss fills our senses

254
00:43:55,161 --> 00:44:04,559
lt would be gloomy to be
for ever separated from her ...

255
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:14,937
... who gives us perpetual youth
and joyous delight!

256
00:44:31,464 --> 00:44:38,563
Dearest sister!
Are you restored to me?

257
00:44:43,242 --> 00:44:49,909
Do not touch her!
She still belongs to us

258
00:44:55,321 --> 00:45:01,590
At Riesenheim's boundary
we stopped to rest

259
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:11,762
Honourably we tended
the pledge for the pact

260
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:22,105
l regret l am returning her ...

261
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:31,914
... for us to be paid her ransom

262
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:39,464
The ransom lies ready

263
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:44,193
Now the gold shall be measured

264
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,382
To do without the woman
saddens us sorely

265
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:05,220
lf she is to be
banished from my mind ...

266
00:46:07,326 --> 00:46:15,461
... the treasure must be so high
that it hides her from my sight!

267
00:46:30,216 --> 00:46:35,176
Freia's form shall be the measure

268
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:14,084
These poles measure the pledge.
Now fill the space with the hoard

269
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:18,454
Hurry! The work is repugnant!

270
00:47:20,433 --> 00:47:25,962
- Help me, Froh!
- l'll end Freia's shame

271
00:47:51,897 --> 00:47:53,728
Not so loosely packed!

272
00:48:01,307 --> 00:48:03,036
Fill the measure tightly!

273
00:48:06,278 --> 00:48:09,111
l can still see through it.
Stop up these chinks!

274
00:48:10,616 --> 00:48:12,481
Stand back, clod!

275
00:48:12,985 --> 00:48:16,318
- Keep your hands off!
- Close these crevices!

276
00:48:18,324 --> 00:48:20,588
Deep in me burns my disgrace

277
00:48:22,828 --> 00:48:26,229
Our pure one stands humiliated

278
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:33,095
Her look mutely pleads for release

279
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:40,937
Wicked man, to ask this
of a loved one!

280
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:44,739
Still more!

281
00:48:47,186 --> 00:48:51,987
Rage this rogue rouses in me!

282
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:58,394
You cur! lf you want to measure,
measure yourself against me!

283
00:48:59,098 --> 00:49:03,626
Your din avails you nothing!

284
00:49:04,737 --> 00:49:06,034
Not even to crush you?

285
00:49:07,006 --> 00:49:08,132
Peace!

286
00:49:12,444 --> 00:49:14,674
l think Freia is covered now

287
00:49:18,484 --> 00:49:19,951
The hoard is used up

288
00:49:31,697 --> 00:49:35,895
l still see the gleam of her hair.
Throw that object on the pile!

289
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:37,967
The helmet too?

290
00:49:38,504 --> 00:49:41,405
- Here with it!
- Let it go!

291
00:49:45,878 --> 00:49:48,278
Are you satisfied?

292
00:49:54,587 --> 00:50:01,186
Freia the fair l see no more

293
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:10,699
Must l let her go?

294
00:50:33,859 --> 00:50:39,263
Her gaze still gleams on me here,
through a crack

295
00:50:44,737 --> 00:50:51,006
As long as l see those lovely eyes
l cannot tear myself away!

296
00:50:53,078 --> 00:50:55,103
l advise you, stop up this crack!

297
00:50:56,282 --> 00:51:00,343
Can't you see the gold has gone?

298
00:51:01,453 --> 00:51:04,217
By no means. On Wotan's finger ...

299
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:10,228
... still glints a ring of gold.
Give it here to fill the crack!

300
00:51:10,796 --> 00:51:12,423
What! This ring?

301
00:51:13,632 --> 00:51:17,659
Listen! This gold belongs
to the Rhinemaidens

302
00:51:19,004 --> 00:51:21,666
Wotan will give it back to them

303
00:51:23,342 --> 00:51:29,872
What idle chatter is this?
What l won l'll keep for myself

304
00:51:32,484 --> 00:51:37,512
lt goes badly with the promise
l gave the lamenting maidens

305
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:42,324
Your promise does not bind me.
The ring remains with me

306
00:51:44,463 --> 00:51:46,761
But you must yield it here

307
00:51:48,267 --> 00:51:50,497
l will grant you everything ...

308
00:51:53,205 --> 00:51:56,402
... but for all the world
l will not surrender the ring!

309
00:51:59,111 --> 00:52:02,342
Then our first bargain stands.
Freia follows us for ever!

310
00:52:03,115 --> 00:52:06,084
- Help!
- Give in to them!

311
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,955
- Do not hold back!
- Give up the ring!

312
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:16,989
Leave me in peace!
The ring l'll not surrender

313
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:50,460
Yield, Wotan, yield!

314
00:52:52,498 --> 00:52:56,434
Escape from the ring's curse

315
00:52:59,671 --> 00:53:05,041
To dark destruction ...

316
00:53:07,146 --> 00:53:11,480
... its possession dooms you

317
00:53:16,755 --> 00:53:21,055
Who is this woman who threatens?

318
00:53:27,466 --> 00:53:34,804
l know whatever was

319
00:53:41,213 --> 00:53:48,745
Whatever is, whatever shall be ...

320
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:56,050
... l also see

321
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:06,793
The eternal world's first
ancestress ...

322
00:54:11,844 --> 00:54:16,941
... Erda warns you

323
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:28,983
My womb bore three daughters,
conceived before the start of time

324
00:54:35,067 --> 00:54:45,671
What l see, the Norns
nightly tell you

325
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:03,186
But direst danger
today brings me in person to you

326
00:55:11,637 --> 00:55:15,073
Hear me!

327
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:35,155
All that is shall come to an end

328
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:50,604
A dark day dawns for the gods

329
00:55:56,815 --> 00:55:59,545
l charge you ...

330
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,419
... shun the ring!

331
00:56:19,805 --> 00:56:28,270
Mysterious your words sound

332
00:56:35,587 --> 00:56:39,387
Stay that l may know more!

333
00:56:47,432 --> 00:56:51,459
l have warned you

334
00:56:53,905 --> 00:56:57,841
You know enough

335
00:57:00,512 --> 00:57:06,781
Reflect in fear and dread!

336
00:57:08,587 --> 00:57:12,523
lf l must fear and dread,
l must seize you and learn all!

337
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:14,791
What would you do, madman?

338
00:57:15,861 --> 00:57:23,063
Desist, Wotan! Touch not
the noble one. Heed her words!

339
00:57:34,279 --> 00:57:38,579
Listen, you giants! Wait!

340
00:57:40,285 --> 00:57:43,550
You shall be given the gold

341
00:57:46,325 --> 00:57:49,260
Dare l hope so?

342
00:57:52,497 --> 00:58:02,031
Do you think me
truly worth this ransom?

343
00:58:30,535 --> 00:58:33,504
Come to me, Freia!

344
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:37,838
You are freed

345
00:58:40,645 --> 00:58:48,882
Bought back, restore our youth!

346
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:57,727
You giants, take your ring!

347
00:59:36,668 --> 00:59:43,801
Stop, greedy! Leave some for me.
A fair division will be best

348
00:59:46,111 --> 00:59:49,842
You longed more for the maid than
for gold, lovesick loon!

349
00:59:50,682 --> 00:59:55,312
l persuaded you to exchange her.
You would not have shared Freia ...

350
00:59:56,121 --> 00:59:59,716
... so l retain more for myself

351
01:00:00,992 --> 01:00:03,722
Do you insult me?
l call on you as judges

352
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:07,122
Divide the treasure between us

353
01:00:08,633 --> 01:00:12,000
Let him take the treasure.
Only keep the ring!

354
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:18,437
Back! Mine is the ring!
For it l gave up Freia's gaze

355
01:00:19,177 --> 01:00:21,042
Hands away! The ring is mine!

356
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:25,508
l hold it. lt belongs to me!

357
01:00:26,551 --> 01:00:28,542
Hold it fast in case it falls!

358
01:00:39,764 --> 01:00:48,866
Now blink at Freia's gaze.
The ring you will not touch again!

359
01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:21,129
Terrible now l find the curse

360
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:55,300
What luck, Wotan! Great your gain
when you won the ring

361
01:01:57,842 --> 01:02:00,310
More it profits now it is taken

362
01:02:04,382 --> 01:02:14,087
See, your foes fell each other
for the gold that you gave up

363
01:02:20,231 --> 01:02:24,668
Yet anxiety weighs upon me

364
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:34,645
Dread and fear fetter my mind

365
01:02:39,584 --> 01:02:44,886
How to end it Erda must teach me

366
01:02:46,224 --> 01:02:49,387
l must go down to her

367
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:59,999
Why do you tarry, Wotan?

368
01:03:10,181 --> 01:03:18,611
Does the noble fort not beckon
as it waits to welcome its owner?

369
01:03:21,426 --> 01:03:25,954
l paid for it with unclean wages!

370
01:03:44,616 --> 01:03:50,555
A sultry haze hangs in the air.
lts dull weight oppresses me

371
01:03:53,024 --> 01:03:58,621
l will collect the clouds
in a storm to sweep the sky

372
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:27,385
Come to me, mists and vapours!
Donner, your master, summons you

373
01:04:36,401 --> 01:04:40,462
As l swing my hammer, hover here!

374
01:04:49,314 --> 01:04:52,283
Misty moisture, hanging haze!

375
01:04:54,352 --> 01:04:58,379
Donner, your master, summons you

376
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:56,040
Brother, point out the path!

377
01:06:33,218 --> 01:06:36,779
The bridge leads to the fort ...

378
01:06:39,257 --> 01:06:44,923
... light but firm below your feet

379
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:53,766
Boldly tread its terrorless path!

380
01:07:34,178 --> 01:07:39,878
The sun sheds its evening beams

381
01:07:45,556 --> 01:07:51,392
ln its gleam the castle shines

382
01:08:00,872 --> 01:08:09,041
ln the radiance of the morning
it stood tenantless ...

383
01:08:12,216 --> 01:08:18,177
... grand and inviting before me

384
01:08:23,828 --> 01:08:31,200
From morn to eve, in care
and anxiety ...

385
01:08:34,339 --> 01:08:41,336
... not lightly was it won

386
01:08:46,584 --> 01:08:49,747
Night draws on

387
01:08:52,724 --> 01:08:57,457
From envy it now offers shelter

388
01:09:11,876 --> 01:09:15,778
Thus l salute the fortress ...

389
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:21,617
... safe from terror and dread

390
01:09:29,827 --> 01:09:32,796
Wife, follow me

391
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:42,706
Dwell in Valhalla with me!

392
01:09:48,413 --> 01:09:53,680
What means the name?
Never have l heard it before

393
01:09:55,019 --> 01:09:59,683
What my courage found for me

394
01:10:04,062 --> 01:10:12,367
lf it lives on victorious,
it will make its meaning plain

395
01:10:16,841 --> 01:10:20,607
They hasten to their end,
though they think themselves strong

396
01:10:22,346 --> 01:10:24,507
l am almost ashamed
to share their doings

397
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:30,387
Fancy lures me to transform
myself back into flames

398
01:10:31,055 --> 01:10:35,321
To burn them who tamed me
rather than end with the blind!

399
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:40,026
lt doesn't seem stupid

400
01:10:41,299 --> 01:10:42,630
l'll think it over

401
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:45,362
Who knows what l'll do?

402
01:10:58,783 --> 01:11:04,153
Rhinegold! Purest gold!

403
01:11:05,823 --> 01:11:09,350
How bright you once shone on us!

404
01:11:12,763 --> 01:11:16,699
What lamenting assails me here?

405
01:11:18,202 --> 01:11:20,636
Give us the gold!

406
01:11:22,306 --> 01:11:27,334
The children of the Rhine
lament their looted gold

407
01:11:29,113 --> 01:11:30,080
Accursed nymphs!

408
01:11:31,582 --> 01:11:35,348
Give us its glory again!

409
01:11:35,853 --> 01:11:37,548
Stop them annoying us!

410
01:11:39,724 --> 01:11:46,129
You in the water, why wail to us?
Hear what Wotan wills for you

411
01:11:48,132 --> 01:11:54,799
No more gleams the gold on you

412
01:11:56,874 --> 01:12:00,241
Henceforth bask in bliss ...

413
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,048
... in the gods' new radiance!

414
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:22,691
Rhinegold! lf but your gleam
still glittered in the deep!

415
01:12:29,173 --> 01:12:36,875
Now only in the depths lie
tenderness and truth

416
01:12:41,852 --> 01:12:46,915
False and faint-hearted
are those who revel above!
