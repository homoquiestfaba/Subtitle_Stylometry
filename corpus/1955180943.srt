that it'd be worth your while,

a couple of hundred bucks

to the airport.

You're looking fine there, woman.

What we got here?

00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,717
A twin pack.

349

these are two friends of mine

350
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,183
and I was
wondering, Patsy,

351
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,383
if you could keep these two boys
occupied for about five minutes

Wow, I'm really happy
to see you.

you'd be mad at me.

You specifically said
she wanted to see me.

00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,438
I did?

365
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,037
You lied to me
to get me back here.

366
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:55,376
Never. I told you we needed your rig
to get the bear out of the woods.

367
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,181
You knew that if you told me she
wanted to see me, I'd come back.

You're mad.

369

I've got another job to do.

wants to marry him,

to stop her, again.

to marry him.

She wouldn't have
told you that.

Would she?

Yes.

Yes.

00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,712
Yes.

512
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,545
It was your great
grandmama Olsen's.

513
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:49,121
But I still don't see how you're
going to marry that girl from jail.

514
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,460
Don't tell me how to
do my business, Ma.

515
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,060
Don't you sass me, boy.

516
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,072
Hey. Oh, no, no, no.
Not so fast.

517
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,074
Hey, you have
any luck?

518
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,107
Any luck?
She shot at me.

519
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,405
Did she hit you?
No.

520
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,502
Then she wasn't serious.

521
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:11,603
What do you mean
she wasn't serious?

522
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,704
She shot at me.
She could have hit me.

523
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,114
But she didn't. I'd say
that's a good sign, son.

524
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,340
Good, I'm out of here.

525
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,784
No, wait, wait.
You can't leave.

526
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,877
I can't leave.
Watch me.

527
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,445
No, we need your rig
to get the bear.

528
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,956
I see. You don't need the
rig to get the bear!

529
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,253
'Cause you're not going to get the bear.

530
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,349
You never have
and you never will.

531
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,485
Forget the bear!

532
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,927
You might
as well tell him.

533
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,858
The boys found the bear.

534
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,358
Yes.

535
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,695
No way.

536
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:33,961
Bear?

537
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,304
Oh, this is great.

538
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,838
Listen, the last thing I need right
now is a little lip from you, okay.

539
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,570
So, cut it out,
city slicker.

540
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,168
Bear! Ooh.

541
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,577
(SHUSHING)

542
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,108
What is he, some kind of good
luck symbol or something?

543
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,814
You're kidding.
I was just guessing.

544
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,420
Johnny Bruce and the boys
found the hiding place,

545
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,891
snuck right in underneath their
noses and took it out of there.

546
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,488
Fifty years we've been
trying to find that bear.

547
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,962
You actually
found the bear?

548
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,690
That's why we needed
you to come home.

549
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,631
I don't believe it.
You got the bear.

550
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,761
Yes. But we need to
bring it back to town.

551
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,566
I guess that's where
you come in, slick.

552
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,634
I got the picture.
But thank you.

553
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,037
We really need
your help.

554
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,670
Look, this has been, may I say a
lot of fun, but can we go now?

555
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,214
(LAUGHS)

556
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,011
So, I guess you won
the drawing.

557
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:27,415
We have one more thing to take care of
and then we'll finally be on our way.

558
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:28,649
What now?

559
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,624
We got to see a man
about a bear.

560
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,225
Oh, no!

561
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,556
Yeah, J.B. is gonna tell
you about the whole thing.

562
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,763
Now, get yourselves
cleaned up, huh?

563
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,495
Come on. Yeah.

564
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,364
(CHUCKLES)

565
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:45,630
Patsy, you got to tell me
the truth, here.

566
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:46,902
Always.

567
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,000
Is she really thinking
about marrying Jake?

568
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,275
The Wedding's taking place
right after the parade.

569
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,516
Whoa, whoa. What? Why
didn't you tell me that?

570
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,384
You didn't ask.

571
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,352
I mean, his people have already
made all the arrangements.

572
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,619
I mean, they've even decorated up
the old saw mill for the ceremony.

573
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,091
The saw mill?

574
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,221
He's gonna marry her
at the saw mill.

575
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,960
Tradition!

576
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,126
I mean Jake's daddy married
Jake's ma at the saw mill.

577
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,460
(sums)

578
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,731
I'd say this is about
your last chance.

579
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:17,933
What you going to do?

580
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,474
Get the bear.

581
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,442
Talk to Beth.

582
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,906
Get married.

583
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:25,970
(LAUGHS)

584
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,209
What else can I do?

585
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,409
Atta boy!

586
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,780
See ya.

and a whole lot of down-home fun,</i>

through town.</i>

589
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,495
<i>So, put on your dancing shoes
and hang around.</i>

590
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,995
Let's go on down there
and arrest them.

591
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,831
Without the goods?

592
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,600
We lose them now, we may never
catch 'em with the goods.

593
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,644
Then let's not
lose them.

594
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,879
First we get the bear,
then we get the Bandit.

595
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,588
Well?

596
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,860
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

597

MEN: Whoa!

598
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,308
Son, I kind of like that little
spitfire you brought along.

599
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,973
Oh, J.B. You're not serious.
Come on, now.

600
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,606
Nah, she's got some style.

601
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,217
Style?

602
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,718
I tell you what I wanna
know is who's the...

603
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,382
Who's the young man in little
Jennifer's life there, huh?

604
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,789
What do you mean?

605
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,625
Oh, come on now, cousin. You can can the
innocent expressions with me, buddy.

606
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,061
Who is it?

607
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,291
Well, if you want to say something
to me, just say it in English.

608
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,832
You haven't noticed?

609
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,660
Noticed what?

610
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,303
She's all moony-eyed, her
cheeks are flushed. Come on.

611
00:39:58,362 --> 00:39:59,534

J.B.: They're after me.

God damn!

620
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,292
Sorry.

621
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,659
But unless you want to
see me do some hard time,

622
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,200
you'd better lose them
in the woods.

623
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,925
I don't believe this.

624
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,462
Lynn, you just keep
heading along there

625
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,097
until somebody stops you,
and you...

I don't know, tell them
I'll be there shortly.

leaving the road.

628
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,009
Well, what do you want
me to do about it?

629
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,606
They've got the stuff with them.
The truck is a decoy.

630
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:42,776
No, we don't know that.

631
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,615
We can't lose
Johnny Bruce.

They're behind us!

00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,380
Okay. Okay.

635
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,114
Damn!

636
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,509
What should I do?

after Johnny Bruce.

638
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,524
Now I'm in charge.

639
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,457
I thought you
promised me

640
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,400
you were going to get out of the
shine business, didn't you?

641
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,528
I know, I did.

642
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,971
Now, did I or did I not tell you
I was not gonna come back here

643
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,668
and help you out ever again unless
you got rid of the stills, J.B.?

644
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:41,903
Yes, yes, you did.

645
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,707
Well, what then?

646
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,610
Blue bird,
three o'clock.

647
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:47,841
Four o'clock.

Now maybe
it's six o'clock.

649
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,075
Hold on.

00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,287
Don't back off.

Where did you
learn to drive?

655
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,108
I ought to bring them right
to the stills right now.

00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,476
You watch me,
I'll do it!

657

(SIGHS) What?

659
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,555
Well, I got rid of them,
just like you asked me to.

00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,488
Then who are these guys
following us?

661
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,523
Got me
a new business.

662
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,690
Which is?

663
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,232
Doing pretty well.

this new business is about?

665

boutique business.

Yeah, consisting of?

667
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,243
Just me.

668
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,510

marketable products.

drive, drive.

you going?
