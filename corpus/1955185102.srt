00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,084
Roger that, Carl.

184
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,782
Hey, where's Sammy?

185
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,427
Last I saw her,
she cut her arm

186
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:52,218
with some glass.

187
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,620
Yeah, it looked pretty bad.

188
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,792
I thought she came back here
to the van for some first aid.

189
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:57,965
Like they'd have anything more
than a 10-year-old Band-Aid.

190
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,192
- So, where is she?
- Beats me.

191
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,770
Maybe she took
an unscheduled vacation.

192
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,528
Get my drift?

193
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,934
That wouldn't be wise.

194
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,882
- Where's Pines?
- She cut her arm.

195
00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:08,701
I sent her to you
to get it fixed.

196
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,245
Well, she never showed.
You better go find her.

197
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,726
Ladies, question.

198
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:18,478
Where's Pines?

199
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:20,613
All right, look,

200
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,683
if you know something,
anything,

201
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:24,753
it'd be better
if you tell me now

202
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:25,751
before it goes any further.

203
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:26,786
Understood?

204
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,459
Okay, three words,

205
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:31,124
guilt by association.

206
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,945
You know
what the warden's like.

207
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:34,766
This will not go good
for any of us

208
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:36,466
if Pines somehow gets away.

209
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:37,964
Just a guess,
she was jonesing

210
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,269
for a swim in that stream
over there all afternoon.

211
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:41,609
Maybe she went skinny-dipping.

212
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,841
Mike, she may be down
by the stream.

213
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:45,772
- Go check it out.
- But...

214
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,612
No "but," all right?
Just check it out now.

215
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:49,552
Right.

216
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,978
Let's just hope

217
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,680
this is one
big misunderstanding.

218
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,854
Hey, Carl, get down
to the stream quick.

219
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,389
All right, ladies,
let's go see

220
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:03,492
what Mike has found.

221
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:04,657
After you, sir.

222
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,327
On the contrary,
Ms. Gunners, after you.

223
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,171
Arkansas manners
still apply here.

224
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,212
Is that...

225
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,480
Yeah, it's hers.

226
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,216
So, what'd she do,
strip down and escape

227
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,116
in her undies?

228
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,693
Not if some accomplice
was waiting

229
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:33,163
with a new wardrobe for her.

230
00:17:33,363 --> 00:17:34,053
That's not possible.

231
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,596
One of us would have known.

232
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:36,456
Yeah.

233
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,033
Tough keeping secrets
in stir,

234
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:38,891
especially an escape.

235
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,126
How would someone
from the outside

236
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,862
have known we were gonna
pull over right here?

237
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:42,862
I didn't even know
where we were

238
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,682
gonna stop till we got here.

239
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:46,299
Nevertheless, she's gone.

240
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,938
I gotta call this in
immediately.

241
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:49,578
Mike,
take 'em back to the van.

242
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:50,877
Keep 'em rounded up close.

243
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:52,338
Yes, sir, boss.

244
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,848
You heard the man, ladies.
Let's get moving.

245
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:56,183
Michelle,
you're bleeding, girl.

246
00:17:56,383 --> 00:17:57,176
- What?
- Your arm

247
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,583
- is covered in blood.
- How'd you get cut?

248
00:17:59,783 --> 00:18:02,287
It's not me bleeding,
hitches.

249
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,227
It's this tree.
It's covered in blood.

250
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,369
That's right, sir.
She just up and disappeared.

251
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:16,362
Seems weird.

252
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,633
Her sentence was up
the end of next month.

253
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,599
That's right, Warden.

254
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,143
Chopper's in the air
before we left the site.

255
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:23,636
I'm sure we'll find her.

256
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,206
Warden, I...

257
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,716
Sir, are you there?

258
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,051
Sir?

259
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,548
Damn cell towers
ain't worth a damn.

260
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,820
Yeah, I lost my bars
about ten miles back.

261
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,825
Stop, and see if we can help.

262
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,024
That's against regulations.

263
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,294
Clearly states
that you're not...

264
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:47,669
Give it a rest, will you?

265
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,806
Stop the van.

266
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,291
Do you need a doctor?

267
00:19:00,491 --> 00:19:01,307
Our cell phones are down,

268
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,959
but we can take you
to the nearest hospital.

269
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:04,611
Y'all might need
some looking after yourself,

270
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,521
kind sirs.

271
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,622
You, we can do this
one of two ways,

272
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:12,796
slow and easy
or just plain dead.

273
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:14,321
Your choice.

274
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,588
Easy.

275
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,529
We do it easy.
Just keep your cool.

276
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:19,766
- We'll cooperate.
- Good.

277
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:22,004
Hand over your guns.
Slowly.

278
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,336
Good buy.

279
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,604
Now, it's time
for all of us ladies

280
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,784
- to mosey on out of here.
- Now, hold on there.

281
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,650
You got something to say,
cowboy?

282
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,484
No, nothing.
Nothing at all.

283
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:38,778
I didn't think so.

284
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,857
Now, open up the side door,
and let 'em all go.

285
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,116
- Whoa there, dude.
- Easy, lady.

286
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,728
- I'll do it from my side.
- Good idea.

287
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,230
So long, suckers.

288
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,829
Baby, you just rock my world.

289
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:56,806
Hmm.

290
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,466
This is seriously messed up.

291
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,077
<i>It's the last thing I need.</i>

292
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,044
Look, just stick close to me.
You'll be fine.

293
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:07,974
To be continued, sweetheart.

294
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:11,678
We're in the middle
of a felony here.

295
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,645
Try that again, cop,

296
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,115
and you'll be playing
pocket pool with no balls.

297
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,586
Yeah, creep. My girl here
means what she says.

298
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:18,684
All right, listen.

299
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,488
Nobody wants to he
a hero here,

300
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:21,354
right, Mike?

301
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,055
- Right, sir.
- All right,

302
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,360
let's just stay calm,
and we'll all get along.

303
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,837
I don't know about
these two prom queens.

304
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,464
I'm in.

305
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:32,965
What do I do?

306
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,838
Well, for now,
until they decide to join us,

307
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:35,635
cover 'em.

308
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,075
You two screws
back in the back

309
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,515
with the regular folk.

310
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:40,707
Now.

311
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,735
Earth to Adam.
Come in, Adam.

312
00:20:58,935 --> 00:20:59,859
Over.

313
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,595
Ah. I'm sorry.

314
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,230
What you thinking 'bout?

315
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,068
How impressed you are
with my detective skills?

316
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:09,235
Nah, not exactly, no.
1..

317
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,210
Just thinking about that scene
back there, you know?

318
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,605
I... I don't really know

319
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,507
if I'm cut out
for this kind of work.

320
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,153
Hey, I felt the same way
when I first started.

321
00:21:17,353 --> 00:21:18,622
No joke.

322
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,385
- You just gotta do what I do.
- What's that?

323
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:24,923
Whenever you want a break
from the job,

324
00:21:25,123 --> 00:21:27,253
just crank up the tunes.

325
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,006
This? This is what you do
to unwind?

326
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,760
This is what you like
to listen to?

327
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,781
What's that
supposed to mean?

328
00:21:31,981 --> 00:21:33,788
What do you like listening to,

329
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:35,796
that techno music,
some disco?

330
00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:37,001
Terrible.

331
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,336
Reporter:
So, be on the lookout

332
00:21:40,536 --> 00:21:41,942
for these
four female escapees

333
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:43,135
and their driver.

334
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,973
Once again,
these women escaped

335
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:46,072
from custody earlier today

336
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,683
and should be
considered armed

337
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:49,448
and extremely dangerous.

338
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,781
If you encounter them,
call your local law enforce...

339
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,947
So much for getting
your mind off it.

340
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,457
Looks like our laundry list
just got longer.

341
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,820
♪♪

342
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,234
Ladies and gentlemen,

343
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,380
I'd like to welcome you
nice people

344
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,270
on this nonstop service

345
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,773
from the big house
to freedom.

346
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:21,075
We'll be going at the speed

347
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:22,377
of whatever
Captain Honey here

348
00:22:22,577 --> 00:22:23,509
damn well pleases,

349
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,411
so at this time,
I'd like to invite you

350
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,716
to fasten your seat belts
and make sure your tray tables

351
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,021
and seat backs
are in their full

352
00:22:29,221 --> 00:22:30,416
upright position.

353
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,152
Lastly, if anyone decides
to get cute

354
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,419
or do anything stupid,

355
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:36,293
I will gladly
blow your heads off.

356
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,761
They got
some surveillance cameras

357
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,668
a couple miles up
where Route 40 crosses.

358
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:45,972
Maybe we can attract
some attention.

359
00:22:46,172 --> 00:22:48,912
Do what, dance?
Tell jokes?

360
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,776
Now what?

361
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,081
So much for our act
for the cameras.

362
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,520
So, where the hell
is she going?

363
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,995
Who the hell knows?

364
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,227
Excuse me. Excuse me.

365
00:23:10,427 --> 00:23:11,490
This is my stop.

366
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,992
Just hold your water, babe.

367
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,536
It'll be everyone's stop
in just about two minutes.

368
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,357
Okay, baby,
get everybody out.

369
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,191
Out, out. Everybody out.

370
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:46,492
Move, move.

371
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,514
Move it. Get over there.

372
00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:50,536
Get over there. Move.

373
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,238
What now?

374
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,213
What's wrong with you,
princess?

375
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:02,446
I'll tell you what's wrong.

376
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:03,275
I got six months left,

377
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,386
and you just tacked on
ten easy.

378
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:07,003
Give it a rest, dragon lady.

379
00:24:07,203 --> 00:24:08,621
What do you got
waiting for you

380
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:10,457
when you get out, anyway?

381
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,326
My boy.

382
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,222
Got a little boy.

383
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,457
Okay, ladies, strip.

384
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,292
Get rid of what
you're wearing.

385
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,769
- Even me?
- Yeah, sweetheart, even you.

386
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:25,173
Here. Put this on.

387
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,248
You ain't got nothing
we haven't seen, girl.

388
00:24:32,448 --> 00:24:33,973
- Do it.
- You first.

389
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,449
Hey, if you feeling froggy,
you might as well jump.

390
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:39,616
Come on, soy sauce,
make your move.

391
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:41,247
I told you.

392
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:42,983
I'm gonna rip your eyes out.

393
00:24:43,183 --> 00:24:44,634
You don't...

394
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:46,085
You know what?

395
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,696
Get your hands off me.

396
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,193
- Enough.
- How you like that, huh?

397
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,438
♪♪

398
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,116
- Off me.
- Get off me.

399
00:24:56,316 --> 00:24:57,263
Honey, he's getting away.

400
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,650
Oh, no, he's not.
Cover the old fart.

401
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,038
- Got it.
- Keep your hands off my head.

402
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,450
I ain't going anywhere.

403
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,287
Damn you.

404
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,296
I think your boy
just bought it.

405
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,526
You didn't think
you could outrun old Honey,

406
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:57,728
now, did you?

407
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,112
Crap on a cracker.

408
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,226
Where are they?

409
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,347
I got 'em waiting
in the other van.

410
00:26:36,547 --> 00:26:38,468
- Did you get him?
- I got him.

411
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:40,866
I just hope you don't have

412
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:44,104
any of the same stupid ideas
your friend had.

413
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:46,777
No, not at all.

414
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:47,773
Good.

415
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,419
Let's get the hell
out of here.

416
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,556
Water.

417
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,329
Water.

418
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,988
Water.

419
00:27:19,188 --> 00:27:20,775
Thank God.

420
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,037
Ah, yeah.

421
00:28:22,237 --> 00:28:23,575
Oh, yeah.

422
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,383
I hope this baby
has four-wheel drive.

423
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,477
Why is that, Screw?

424
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,764
This is the old road
to Wrightson Swamp,

425
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:10,051
gets pretty mucky
the further you get in.

426
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:12,317
We'll just see about that.

427
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,360
Honey, did you hear
what he just said?

428
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,187
What's that?

429
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,472
That we're headed
into the swamp.

430
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,757
Yeah, I heard that
from the guy

431
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,311
who rented me the place.

432
00:29:19,511 --> 00:29:20,790
- What place?
- You'll see.

433
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,061
It's only a few more miles.

434
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,298
Sure as hell hope
this place of yours

435
00:29:24,498 --> 00:29:25,600
has indoor plumbing.

436
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,698
As a matter of fact,

437
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,401
the old man said it
was pretty well-equipped.

438
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,971
- What old man?
- Don't worry, baby.

439
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:32,380
He won't be talking
to anyone.

440
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,405
How's that?

441
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,415
Let's just say I pushed him
into early retirement.

442
00:29:36,615 --> 00:29:37,614
Aha.

443
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,499
Hell, it's even nicer
than I expected.

444
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:58,897
It's even got a hot tub.

445
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,933
Excuse me, but what the hell
are we doing here?

446
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,135
You know, for someone enjoying
a little taste of freedom,

447
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,222
you sure got a hell
of a mouth on you, girl.

448
00:30:05,422 --> 00:30:07,310
So I've been told,
but answer the question.

449
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,874
Just chill. Chill.

450
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,309
We're gonna settle in here

451
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,989
- and just wait.
- Wait for what?

452
00:30:13,189 --> 00:30:14,780
Cops?
Bloodhounds? Choppers?

453
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,459
- Et cetera, et cetera?
- Yeah, yeah.

454
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:17,888
Something like that.

455
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:19,118
Nah, this is gonna he

456
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,106
our little home away
from home.

457
00:30:21,306 --> 00:30:22,632
Ladies,
pardon your delusion,

458
00:30:22,832 --> 00:30:23,956
but this is the first door

459
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,464
they're gonna come
knocking on.

460
00:30:25,664 --> 00:30:26,663
- Trust me.
- She's right.

461
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:27,960
This is absolute B.S.

462
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,428
All you crazy bitches
are gonna do

463
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:32,871
is get more time for us
or worse yet, get us killed.

464
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:34,466
I want out, now.

465
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,373
You ain't going nowhere,
bitch.

466
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:41,777
I'd think twice about
doing that again, sweetie.

467
00:30:41,977 --> 00:30:43,446
Next time, I might get mad.

468
00:30:43,646 --> 00:30:44,943
Soy sauce.

469
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,555
You are here,
and you are going to stay here

470
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:48,280
with the rest of us

471
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,082
until I say different,
understand?

472
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:53,661
Yeah, I get it,
but I don't gotta like it.

473
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:55,454
That's all I'm asking for,
really.

474
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,558
You got anything else to say,
sweetness?

475
00:30:57,758 --> 00:30:59,663
- Yeah, one thing.
- And what's that?

476
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:01,126
Don't go to sleep.

477
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:04,466
All right,
everybody get in the house.

478
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,375
Make sure the man here
is tied up good.

479
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:11,075
He's our insurance policy.

480
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:12,693
You got it, baby.

481
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:14,387
And by the way,

482
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:15,970
thanks for earlier.

483
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,553
Don't mention it.

484
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,219
You, out.

485
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,737
Boss.

486
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,267
Here you go.
It's still hot, I think.

487
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,534
Thanks, kid.

488
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,407
Yeah, might be
a little watered down, though.

489
00:31:44,607 --> 00:31:47,350
- I couldn't find a lid.
- Cop coffee.

490
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,208
It's supposed
to be watered down.

491
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,164
- I think it's in the bylaws.
- Right.

492
00:31:51,364 --> 00:31:53,120
Did you hear anything
from the hospital

493
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,852
- about the call today?
- Yeah.

494
00:31:55,052 --> 00:31:55,681
I talked to the doctor.

495
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,137
He says the guy's
still in shock.

496
00:31:57,337 --> 00:31:58,593
He keeps raving
about his buddy

497
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,152
being eaten by a shark.

498
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,696
Well, after what we saw,
I kind of half believe him.

499
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:04,758
Yeah, right. What about you?
You find anything?

500
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,192
What is that, evidence?

501
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,379
No,
but don't you just love it?

502
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:11,567
It's a vintage
Coca-Cola bottle,

503
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:13,031
solid glass,

504
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,371
not like this plastic and cans
we have today.

505
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,540
It must have been
lying around here

506
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,537
for 80 years.

507
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,047
Now, mind you,
it needs a little work,

508
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:21,873
but once it's polished up,

509
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,009
it's gonna look great
in my minibar.

510
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:26,780
- I meant about the case.
- I know what you meant.

511
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,848
Take a look around.

512
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:28,714
It's pretty obvious

513
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,791
this is where
they changed vehicles.

514
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,706
Yeah,
but what make and model?

515
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:34,419
I don't know.
Something big.

516
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,407
The warden said
one prisoner escaped.

517
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:38,396
That still leaves
six more passengers

518
00:32:38,596 --> 00:32:39,391
to cart around.

519
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,097
- True.
- Let's get on the horn

520
00:32:41,297 --> 00:32:42,803
to all
the rental car companies

521
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,463
within a 50-mile radius,

522
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:45,733
see what
they've got on the road

523
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:46,731
that meets our criteria.

524
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:47,599
I don't know.

525
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,600
I think most of those places

526
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,177
are gonna be closed now,
don't you think?

527
00:32:50,377 --> 00:32:52,910
Let's go wake 'em up.

528
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,247
All right.

529
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,086
Now stay put,

530
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,788
and you might just make it
through the night.

531
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,361
Yeah,
like that's gonna happen.

532
00:33:11,561 --> 00:33:12,934
Your girlfriend'll
put a slug in me

533
00:33:13,134 --> 00:33:14,282
the moment
I'm no use to you.

534
00:33:14,482 --> 00:33:15,427
- That's not true.
- Yeah?

535
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,300
Then who made
Samantha disappear?

536
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,618
It was her, right?

537
00:33:18,818 --> 00:33:19,731
She knocked off Pines

538
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,605
to put us on the road
before nightfall, right?

539
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:24,547
You're crazy.
She's not like that.

540
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:26,672
Yeah.
Tell that to Mike.

541
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:29,944
Just shut up,
or I'll kill you myself.

542
00:33:30,144 --> 00:33:30,776
So, what now?

543
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:34,048
I've been in stir
for five years.

544
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:34,813
I'm gonna go slip

545
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,959
into something
more comfortable.

546
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,489
I hate the rain.

547
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,191
Really?
I kind of like it.

548
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,526
Sounds like a...

549
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,528
like an atmosphere
or something.

550
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,084
So better than the cell block,
isn't it?

551
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:54,640
It's the same thing.
We're trapped here.

552
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,667
Prison's a prison.

553
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,972
Suit yourself,
but I'm gonna make

554
00:33:58,172 --> 00:33:58,970
the best of it.

555
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,972
Well, I know how
you could start.

556
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,413
How 'bout a hot bath
before we go to bed?

557
00:34:03,613 --> 00:34:05,065
Now, that sounds
like a good idea.

558
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:06,717
I haven't had one of those
in so long.

559
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:07,612
Where is it?

560
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,314
Second bathroom
down the hall.

561
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,849
I turned it on
the minute we got here.

562
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,384
Should be coming to a boil
just about now.

563
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,372
Sounds good.
I'm game.

564
00:34:14,572 --> 00:34:16,114
How 'bout you, Sarah?

565
00:34:16,314 --> 00:34:17,656
No, you guys go ahead.

566
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,358
I'll meet you
in a few minutes.

567
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,200
Suit yourself.

568
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,046
Anything good?

569
00:34:54,246 --> 00:34:55,861
Yeah, actually.

570
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,096
I just found
this first-edition copy

571
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,368
of Charles Dickens'
"A Tale of Two Cities."

572
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,435
Yeah, so?

573
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:06,357
You've heard of it, right?

574
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:09,074
You actually read books?

575
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:13,051
In prison, there ain't nothing
better to do.

576
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,323
Let me see that.

577
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,893
"It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times."

578
00:35:22,093 --> 00:35:24,289
Honey, I don't want nothing

579
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,901
but good times
from here on in.

580
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:27,726
I know, hut...

581
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:30,930
I've had enough
of the bad times.

582
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,069
I know, baby.
I know.

583
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,921
Where the hell is she,
for God's sake?

584
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:56,455
Relax.
Enjoy her not being here.

585
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,135
Sharon, you know
we have to get out of here

586
00:35:59,335 --> 00:36:00,535
more sooner than later,
right?

587
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,102
<i>- You think it's gonna get bad?
- Girl,</i>

588
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,137
I've been smelling bad crap
all my life,

589
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:07,610
and this is the limburger
of bad.

590
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,101
I know what you mean.

591
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:09,935
Yeah, you do.

592
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:11,375
Someone does
something stupid,

593
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:12,237
a gun goes off,

594
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,139
and we're all
accessories to murder.

595
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,979
I got a kid back home.
I can't go back to the joint.

596
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,147
I know.

597
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,482
<i>- Hey, guys. What'd I miss?
- Not a thing, girl.</i>

598
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,087
Michelle and I
were just talking

599
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:27,137
about our recent benefactors.

600
00:36:27,337 --> 00:36:29,732
Yeah, they are kind of harsh.

601
00:36:29,932 --> 00:36:32,327
Harsh? Heh. Nice word.
Love it.

602
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:33,810
They did get us out.

603
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,093
Get us out to where,

604
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,413
some "Friday the 13th" cabin
in the woods?

605
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:39,733
Yeah, this is not my idea
of getting us out.

606
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:41,335
Look,
tomorrow they'll most likely

607
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:42,367
go their separate ways.

608
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,979
Then you'll have the option
to either give up

609
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:46,471
or take off running.

610
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,309
You're forgetting
the third option.

611
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:49,174
Yeah, what's that?

612
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,149
They shoot us all
to keep us from talking.

613
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:53,278
Bad option, very bad.

614
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,013
You think
they'd go that far?

615
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,516
"Do you think
they'd go that far?"

616
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:58,020
Do you remember
what they just did

617
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,428
to Mike a couple hours ago?

618
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,026
Yeah. You got
a point there, girl.

619
00:37:04,226 --> 00:37:06,161
Yeah, I most certainly do.

620
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,888
Yes.

621
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:51,703
If you don't mind,

622
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,410
I could really use
a bathroom break.

623
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:57,118
You, untie him,
and watch him unload.

624
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:58,314
What'd you say to me?

625
00:37:58,514 --> 00:37:59,444
"Untie him..."

626
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,385
No,
I heard what you said first.

627
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:02,722
What came after that?

628
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,535
Egg roll,
either you watch him poop,

629
00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:08,322
or you watch him
poop his pants.

630
00:38:08,522 --> 00:38:09,423
Your choice.

631
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,092
If it's any consolation,

632
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,894
it's not a lat of fun
for me either.

633
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:18,783
Yeah, it better not be.
I'll tell you that.

634
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:21,673
This may take a while.
I have prostate issues.

635
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:27,011
Lord, what did I do
to deserve this?

636
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,103
Help. Oh, my God.

637
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,119
Yes, sir,
we're looking into it

638
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,686
right now.

639
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:21,052
Yes, he is.

640
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,732
I'll let you know
as soon as I hear something.

641
00:40:23,932 --> 00:40:26,024
Of course. Okay.

642
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:28,465
Give it to me, Chin.
What you got?

643
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:29,394
Chin?

644
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,198
Obscure reference.
Never mind.

645
00:40:31,398 --> 00:40:31,996
What'd he say?

646
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,732
Well, turns out
you were right.

647
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,502
The guy inside says
he rented a minivan

648
00:40:35,702 --> 00:40:37,272
to a lady
using a stolen credit card

649
00:40:37,472 --> 00:40:38,503
yesterday morning.

650
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,444
And they decided to keep it
secret till this morning?

651
00:40:40,644 --> 00:40:41,542
Well, the card
only got flagged

652
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:42,407
late last night

653
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:43,984
after the place
had already closed, so...

654
00:40:44,184 --> 00:40:46,956
Let me guess.
White minivan.

655
00:40:47,156 --> 00:40:48,046
Yeah. How'd you know?

656
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,590
It's the most popular color
in rental car ﬂeets,

657
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,391
followed by black,
off-white, and beige.

658
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:54,419
You're good, boss.

659
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,508
- You're real good.
- That's what they tell me.

660
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:58,389
Listen, now we actually caught
a lucky break.

661
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,569
There's two blue stripes
running down the side of it.

662
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:02,083
Excellent.
You get the plate?

663
00:41:02,283 --> 00:41:03,598
Already up
on the comm lines.

664
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:04,429
And by any chance,

665
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,734
is there LoJack
on any of these vehicles?

666
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:07,866
I don't think so.

667
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,535
Mm. How 'bout a description
of the woman?

668
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,840
Well, the guy inside said
she was a real looker,

669
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,805
had red hair.

670
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,310
Hmm. That's helpful.
You pull the videotape?

671
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,815
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, "nothing"?

672
00:41:19,015 --> 00:41:20,187
Well, they have
two video cameras,

673
00:41:20,387 --> 00:41:21,401
but both of them are fake.

674
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:23,247
Well, that'll teach 'em.

675
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,093
Yeah.
So, where to new?

676
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:26,994
I'm hungry. Lunch.

677
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:28,157
Good idea.

678
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:39,063
Here we are.

679
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,132
Peaches and beans,
my specialty.

680
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,401
- Breakfast is served.
- Oh, no, I'm good.

681
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,343
I just got a heaping helping
of Carl's peaches and beans,

682
00:41:46,543 --> 00:41:47,605
and I'm done.

683
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:50,479
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I bet you are,

684
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:51,932
Spungebob Brownpants.

685
00:41:52,132 --> 00:41:53,178
Tie him up again.

686
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,221
He's an old man.
He's not going anywhere.

687
00:41:55,421 --> 00:41:56,874
Just let him sit here.

688
00:41:57,074 --> 00:41:58,316
I said tie him up.

689
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,784
Why don't you tie him up?

690
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,920
I'm gonna go
have a cigarette.

691
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,157
Hey, hey.
Just wait a hot second here.

692
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:06,396
I'm tired of waiting.

693
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,836
So, can I interest anyone?

694
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,143
<i>Sarah.</i>

695
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,175
Everybody.

696
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,644
- Oh, no. Sarah.
- What's going on?

697
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,017
Something's happened to her.
Come on. Hurry.

698
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,054
What happened?

699
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,289
I don't know,
but she's dead.

700
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,594
Looks like she fell
into a wood chipper.

701
00:42:40,794 --> 00:42:43,047
Come on. We better go
take a look around.

702
00:42:43,247 --> 00:42:45,500
That is so not a good idea
right now.

703
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,531
But we're doing it anyway.

704
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:49,371
- Even him?
- Him most of all.

705
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:50,568
Come on.

706
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,406
Okay, move it.

707
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,456
♪♪

708
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:04,284
Here. Over here.

709
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,865
Oh, my God.

710
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,735
That was no wood chipper.

711
00:43:15,935 --> 00:43:17,362
This is a tooth.

712
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:20,441
Not just a tooth.
That's a shark tooth...

713
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:22,035
like this.

714
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,703
But then
what happened to her?

715
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,610
Yeah, there ain't no sharks
in these woods.

716
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:28,773
Yeah, not that we know of.

717
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,413
How do you know
there ain't one

718
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:32,054
swimming in that stream
over there?

719
00:43:32,254 --> 00:43:32,911
Last time I saws "Jaws,"

720
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,846
they were limited
to salt water.

721
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:37,966
Plus, when she crawled in,
she was bone-dry.

722
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:41,086
Those ruts over there,
they were made recently.

723
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,288
Whatever killed Sarah
made them.

724
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:45,490
What kind of creature
does that?

725
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,471
Honey, have you got an idea?

726
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,596
Not a clue,

727
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,902
but we got a body to bury,
ladies.

728
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,180
You want to tell me
how she ended up here

729
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,623
with this sticking
out of her leg?

730
00:44:08,823 --> 00:44:09,480
I don't know.

731
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,091
Maybe it was
just laying on the ground

732
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:12,283
for some strange reason.

733
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,622
Yeah, it could be
a fossil or something.

734
00:44:14,822 --> 00:44:15,620
It's a shark's tooth.

735
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,266
It's some kind of mutation,
a monster.

736
00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:19,884
Oh, it's a monster,
all right.

737
00:44:20,084 --> 00:44:21,292
Hold it right there, buddy.

738
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,302
Whoa, nice to meet you, too.
Put that away.

739
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:26,230
Or don't.

740
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,168
What the hell
are you two doing here?

741
00:44:28,368 --> 00:44:30,107
Ah, we're waiting
on the next bus

742
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:31,069
out of the swamp.

743
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,180
Why?
What happened to your ride?

744
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,739
- It was eaten.
- Eaten?

745
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:37,028
Eaten by a monstrous
prehistoric shark.

746
00:44:37,228 --> 00:44:39,110
- Oh, my God.
- We gotta get out of here.

747
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,187
Sorry, ladies, but our van
is staying put right here,

748
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,080
and so are you.

749
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,398
You two, come along.

750
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,591
- You got this?
- Yeah.

751
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:45,785
They're kidnapping us.

752
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,792
I know,
but look at that rack.

753
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:51,288
What were you two
really doing out there?

754
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,426
Hold on. I got a question
for you first.

755
00:44:53,626 --> 00:44:55,565
Do you know of anyone
doing any blasting

756
00:44:55,765 --> 00:44:56,494
or drilling in the area?

757
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,675
We're not from around here.
Don't know.

758
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:01,666
All right, look,
I'm a geologist.

759
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:02,467
John here is my assistant.

760
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,374
We're here
to monitor vibrations.

761
00:45:04,574 --> 00:45:05,436
What kind of vibrations?

762
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:08,173
What, like good vibrations,
like the song?

763
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,874
Bad vibrations, actually.

764
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:12,111
Yeah, about two weeks ago,
Delgado Petroleum

765
00:45:12,311 --> 00:45:14,348
started fracking
some old wells in the area.

766
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:15,813
What the hell's farking?

767
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:18,166
Fracking. It's short
for hydraulic fracturing,

768
00:45:18,366 --> 00:45:20,318
and it seems like Delgado
may have gone too far

769
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:22,725
and completely shattered
the subterranean shale bed.

770
00:45:22,925 --> 00:45:24,825
Mister, all I just heard
was blah-blah- blah.

771
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:26,024
Now, you start making sense

772
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,947
before my trigger finger
gets itchy.

773
00:45:29,147 --> 00:45:31,058
Hold on a second.
Look, in 2007,

774
00:45:31,258 --> 00:45:32,964
scientists discovered
an ocean

775
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:36,077
lying 1,400 kilometers
below eastern Asia

776
00:45:36,277 --> 00:45:37,969
about the size of Texas.

777
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,158
Now, if I was a betting man,
and I am,

778
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:41,971
I would say
the good old U.S. of A.

779
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:43,509
Has an underground ocean
of its own.

780
00:45:43,709 --> 00:45:44,842
What the hell
does that have to do

781
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,682
with what happened to Sarah
and your van?

782
00:45:47,882 --> 00:45:50,285
Oceans are teeming with life,

783
00:45:50,485 --> 00:45:52,683
including predators
like sharks.

784
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:55,106
Now, my fear is that Delgado
may have inadvertently

785
00:45:55,306 --> 00:45:57,530
opened a superhighway
between the Earth's surface

786
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,364
and one of these vast
underground waterways.

787
00:45:59,564 --> 00:46:00,716
And while
Delgado's greasing palms

788
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:02,068
in Little Rock
and Washington,

789
00:46:02,268 --> 00:46:02,894
we might be facing

790
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,368
a prehistoric monster
we haven't seen

791
00:46:04,568 --> 00:46:05,830
in about 40 million years.

792
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,320
A sharkasaurus
13 to 20 feet long,

793
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,810
and a natural-born
killing machine,

794
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,372
both in water and on land.

795
00:46:13,572 --> 00:46:14,105
On land?

796
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:15,606
And believe me when I say

797
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,442
this is definitely not
a fossil.

798
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:20,545
Crap on a cracker.
Everybody listen up.

799
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:22,725
We are getting the hell
out of here right now.

800
00:46:22,925 --> 00:46:23,714
- Hallelujah.
- But how?

801
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,087
That creature may be out there
waiting for us.

802
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:28,927
We'll figure a way.
Pack your stuff.

803
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,905
Shannon:
You think we can make it?

804
00:46:42,105 --> 00:46:43,656
Who can tell?

805
00:46:43,856 --> 00:46:45,203
I say we risk it.

806
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:46,804
It's only 100 sweet yards
to that van.

807
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,943
Then by all means,
chopstick, lead the way.

808
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:51,083
Here's the keys.
We're right behind you.

809
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,221
Well, what's the matter,
Tokyo Rose?

810
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:20,808
Thought you were willing
to risk it.

811
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,640
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

812
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,842
Give me those.
I'll do it myself.

813
00:47:34,118 --> 00:47:35,688
Hey, get back here!

814
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,457
Come on!

815
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:41,859
Get back here.

816
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:42,994
Get, come on, come on.

817
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,696
Anita:
Hurry! Come inside!

818
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,466
Come on, come on.

819
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,310
Anita:
What is he doing?

820
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,141
Oh! what's going on?

821
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,163
What are the... Oh!

822
00:47:59,363 --> 00:48:01,186
Just... Just go.

823
00:48:01,386 --> 00:48:02,717
Oh, my God.

824
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:04,048
This is crazed.

825
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:07,229
Okay, does someone have
just a cell phone, a AAA card?

826
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:09,131
So, what do we do now,
professor?

827
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:10,821
Well, first,
stop waving those guns.

828
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,023
I don't know.
I need to think for a minute.

829
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,195
Oh, come on.

830
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:18,696
Pretty hyped-up group.

831
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,565
Yeah, they got good reason.

832
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:22,767
I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

833
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:24,001
I'm John.

834
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,681
Shannon.
Pleased to meet you.

835
00:48:26,881 --> 00:48:28,172
50, what do you do

836
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,943
when you're not fleeing
prehistoric monsters?

837
00:48:31,143 --> 00:48:32,420
Five to ten.

838
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,224
♪♪

839
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:43,890
I'll take this
when you guys are ready.

840
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,535
- Yours from Wilson, too?
- Yeah.

841
00:48:53,735 --> 00:48:55,340
Read it to me, will you?

842
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,145
Left my glasses in the car.

843
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:01,038
What?

844
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,582
Nothing. I just thought
I saw something.

845
00:49:03,782 --> 00:49:04,875
Um...

846
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,487
says the choppers
may have spotted a van

847
00:49:07,687 --> 00:49:09,386
parked nut
near Wrightson Swamp.

848
00:49:09,586 --> 00:49:11,082
So, did they land
and check it out?

849
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,455
Negative. Wilson says the area
was too heavily wooded

850
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:14,759
to put the choppers down.

851
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:17,888
Pack up your chalupas.

852
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,227
Let's blow this taco stand.

853
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:21,393
Did you pay?

854
00:49:21,593 --> 00:49:22,560
It's your turn.

855
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,299
It's always my turn.

856
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,305
What's cooking?

857
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,941
Just more peaches and beans.

858
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,587
- Hold the beans, please.
- Yeah, me, too.

859
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,949
My Lord.

860
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,322
God bless Ronald Reagan.

861
00:49:47,522 --> 00:49:48,592
What is it?

862
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:49,863
Two words...

863
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:53,867
Merry Christmas.

864
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,604
Well, this ought to even
the odds a little bit.

865
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,636
And there's a lot more
in there.

866
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,485
You okay?

867
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,821
We're gonna get through this,
you and me.

868
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:21,485
I'm tired.

869
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,322
It wasn't supposed
to be this way.

870
00:50:23,522 --> 00:50:25,160
When you grow up
the prettiest girl

871
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,624
in Martin Springs,

872
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:29,532
you think everything's
gonna be a bed of roses.

873
00:50:29,732 --> 00:50:31,700
Marry the captain
of the football team

874
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,764
and live happily ever after,

875
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:36,137
but he turns out to be
a raging psychotic

876
00:50:36,337 --> 00:50:37,806
who gets
hooked on OxyContin.

877
00:50:38,006 --> 00:50:38,836
Every night he heats you,

878
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,857
and every morning,
he begs your forgiveness.

879
00:50:41,057 --> 00:50:42,878
You wake up wondering
if this is the day

880
00:50:43,078 --> 00:50:44,475
he finally kills you,

881
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:47,378
and then you do
something about it.

882
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:50,531
I'm tired of being so scared
all the damn time.

883
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:53,684
I'm tired of just getting by
instead of living.

884
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,591
Excuse me, if I could just
have a moment of your time.

885
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,461
What was that?

886
00:51:32,661 --> 00:51:33,934
I don't know.

887
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:39,867
The man asked
for a moment of your time.

888
00:51:40,067 --> 00:51:42,166
Is that too much to ask?

889
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:43,936
All right,
so if you don't mind

890
00:51:44,136 --> 00:51:45,336
giving my man Carl here

891
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:48,779
your undivided attention,
that would be great.

892
00:51:48,979 --> 00:51:50,763
- Go ahead, sir.
- To begin with,

893
00:51:50,963 --> 00:51:52,747
the kidnapping
and prison escape

894
00:51:52,947 --> 00:51:54,545
is now officially over.

895
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:56,315
Sorry, folks.
Better luck next time.

896
00:51:56,515 --> 00:51:58,086
The business
of getting out of here

897
00:51:58,286 --> 00:51:58,916
without getting eaten

898
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,120
by whatever's outside
has begun.

899
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,521
Where did you get those?

900
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:04,855
Well, the owner
of this cabin

901
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,057
is obviously
a crackerjack survivalist,

902
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:09,430
and we found enough guns here
to start World War III.

903
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,028
So, if you're good

904
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,063
and promise not to shoot
each other in the head,

905
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:16,301
my friend Carl will give you
the weapon of your choice.

906
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:19,338
But should you choose to he
a fool or a hothead,

907
00:52:19,538 --> 00:52:21,389
<i>and I am talking
to you and you,</i>

908
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:23,240
then my good friend Carl here

909
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,095
will have to blow
your heads clean off.

910
00:52:26,295 --> 00:52:28,806
- And I will do that.
- So, that's that.

911
00:52:29,006 --> 00:52:31,517
Let's go into the kitchen
and load up.

912
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:45,062
Well, it looks quiet enough.

913
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,970
Maybe it went away,
just some dumb animal.

914
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:49,205
Smart enough
to flatten our tires

915
00:52:49,405 --> 00:52:50,100
and maroon us here.

916
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,644
Let's see if this
stirs the pot a little.

917
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,021
Must be gone.

918
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:08,819
Wrong, buddy.

919
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,955
Wrong in a big way, junior.

920
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:13,157
I got a had feeling
about this.

921
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,360
All right,
everyone hold your ears.

922
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,202
Fire in the hole.

923
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,878
It's just as I thought.
There's more than one.

924
00:53:24,078 --> 00:53:25,445
You gotta be kidding me.
How many?

925
00:53:25,645 --> 00:53:27,013
Six, seven,
maybe a whole mess of 'em

926
00:53:27,213 --> 00:53:28,005
by now, I don't know.

927
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,828
All is I know is
when they smelled blood,

928
00:53:30,028 --> 00:53:31,651
this place became
the hometown Buffet.

929
00:53:31,851 --> 00:53:33,352
We're never
getting out here now.

930
00:53:33,552 --> 00:53:34,845
- Damn.
- "Damn" is right, girl.

931
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,585
You bitches hadn't done
what you done,

932
00:53:36,785 --> 00:53:38,218
I'd be sitting in a warm cell
right now

933
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:39,773
waiting for my dinner
like these sharks.

934
00:53:39,973 --> 00:53:41,329
Carl: All right,
enough of the blame game.

935
00:53:41,529 --> 00:53:42,653
This is serious.

936
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:44,792
We're almost out of food,

937
00:53:44,992 --> 00:53:46,932
and we're next on the menu.

938
00:53:47,132 --> 00:53:47,892
Hey, wait a minute.

939
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:49,196
Anyone notice
if there's a well

940
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:50,361
anywhere on this property?

941
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,508
No well, but I think I saw
some sort of cave out back.

942
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:56,166
- Cave, even better.
- Why's that?

943
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,937
All right, everyone,
back porch right now.

944
00:53:59,137 --> 00:54:00,239
He's right.
Let's go. Hurry.

945
00:54:00,439 --> 00:54:01,542
- Come on.
- Come on. Hurry.

946
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:11,052
What would you say, fellas?

947
00:54:11,252 --> 00:54:12,349
300 feet maybe.

948
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:13,851
I'd say more like 400.

949
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:16,258
- What do you think, professor?
- Well, I asked for a well

950
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:17,891
'cause I was hoping
we could climb down

951
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:19,390
and reach
the subterranean caverns

952
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,069
that are known
to crisscross this area,

953
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:22,359
but a cave's even better.

954
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,894
It's sure
to lead us downward.

955
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,732
But how do we all
get over there safely?

956
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:26,987
And how do you know
that shark's

957
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:28,878
not gonna follow us
into the cave?

958
00:54:29,078 --> 00:54:30,769
First question,
not exactly sure.

959
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:32,321
Second question, cave floors

960
00:54:32,521 --> 00:54:33,671
usually consist
of solid stone,

961
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:36,078
so sharks won't be able
to burrow through.

962
00:54:36,278 --> 00:54:37,841
Anita: Okay,
I've got a great idea.

963
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:41,045
Why don't we just stay put
right here till help comes?

964
00:54:41,245 --> 00:54:43,447
Not a great idea, babe.

965
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,285
We don't want
that kind of help.

966
00:54:45,485 --> 00:54:47,017
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I forgot.

967
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:49,053
There's an even better reason
to leave soon.

968
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:51,089
- Well, spit it out.
- Yeah, give, professor.

969
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,356
What's got you so spooked?

970
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:55,392
Well, every year,
sharks swarm,

971
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:59,597
sometimes 15,000 in an area
less than two miles wide.

972
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,366
They define
hunting territory, mate,

973
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:04,301
devour everything in sight,
then move on.

974
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,503
I'm concerned that what
we've got in the front yard

975
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:07,705
is just a scouting party

976
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:10,112
waiting on a thousand
of their dearest friends.

977
00:55:10,312 --> 00:55:11,108
No, this doesn't sound good
at all.

978
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,394
- No, it doesn't.
- So, we gotta figure a way

979
00:55:13,594 --> 00:55:15,680
to get to that cave
without becoming fish food.

980
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,413
Exactly.

981
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:19,492
And how the hell
do we do that?

982
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:20,951
Professor, you said sharks

983
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,290
gravitate toward human blood,
right?

984
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:24,655
Like ants to honey, Honey.

985
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:27,301
So, let's just give 'em
what they want.

986
00:55:27,501 --> 00:55:28,770
What?

987
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,629
Got 'em.

988
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,001
I found this shirt.

989
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,804
Pants.

990
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,546
♪♪

991
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:40,942
These might work.

992
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:46,954
It's ready.

993
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,326
Come and get it.

994
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,055
Okay. Ready?

995
00:55:57,255 --> 00:55:58,255
Let's do it.

996
00:55:58,455 --> 00:55:59,957
Hey, guys, how's it
looking over there?

997
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:00,924
Nothing in sight.

998
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,126
Let's hope
it stays that way.

999
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:04,469
Who's the best shot?

1000
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,266
- Just don't miss.
- I don't intend to.

1001
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:12,140
All right, everybody,
let's get ready to rumble.

1002
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,058
Okay, how do we know
exactly when?

1003
00:56:14,258 --> 00:56:15,773
- Oh, you'll know.
- Don't worry.

1004
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:17,748
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1005
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,259
Stay frosty, everybody.

1006
00:56:34,459 --> 00:56:35,862
Here goes nothing.

1007
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,547
Oh, my God.
There are six of 'em.

1008
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:54,611
I sure hope Dirty Harriet
can shoot a gun

1009
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:56,056
as well as she
shoots her mouth off.

1010
00:56:56,256 --> 00:56:56,847
Get ready.

1011
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,425
Don't sweat it.
I was born to do this.

1012
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:00,317
Better.

1013
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,588
Let's hope so
for everybody's sake.

1014
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:09,932
Right. Go, go, go.

1015
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:13,197
Nice work.

1016
00:57:13,397 --> 00:57:14,774
Thank me later.

1017
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:17,973
Quick.

1018
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:20,413
- Quick.
- Go.

1019
00:57:20,613 --> 00:57:21,883
Go, go.

1020
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:46,347
Oh, my God.
Come on, you guys.

1021
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:48,167
Here comes one now.
Hurry, hurry.

1022
00:57:48,367 --> 00:57:49,533
Get up, get up.

1023
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:52,270
I think I sprained my ankle.

1024
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,240
They're coming.

1025
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,474
Guys, one of 'em now.

1026
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:59,176
Hey, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

1027
00:57:59,376 --> 00:57:59,910
Sprain or no sprain,

1028
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,612
you gotta rise
to the occasion.

1029
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,580
Come on.

1030
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,952
- Let's go.
- Anita: Hurry.

1031
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,052
Honey, they're coming.

1032
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,187
- Hurry.
- Honey: But it won't stop.

1033
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,323
Won't stop.
Bullets aren't working.

1034
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,392
Just go.
Save yourself. Go.

1035
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,128
- I've gotta help him.
- No, stay here.

1036
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:18,504
- You'll get killed.
- I'm going.

1037
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:20,099
Michelle:
Bad idea.

1038
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:24,373
Guys, get hack.

1039
00:58:24,573 --> 00:58:26,348
Hey! Hey!

1040
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,318
Look over here!

1041
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,181
John, no.
Get out of there.

1042
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,791
No.

1043
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,501
Come on, dollface,
help me get him up.

1044
00:58:46,701 --> 00:58:47,798
What'd you call me?

1045
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,197
God help me.

1046
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:54,765
Come on, guys. Come on.

1047
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:56,837
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1048
00:58:57,037 --> 00:58:58,909
- Wait. Wait.
- Come on, come on.

1049
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:03,351
[crying ]

1050
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:11,425
He gave his life.

1051
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:13,350
I know.

1052
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,771
John was a fine young man.

1053
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:17,988
He left us much too soon.

1054
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:19,909
I'll mourn him
for the rest of my life,

1055
00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:21,831
but I know
he'd want us to push on,

1056
00:59:22,031 --> 00:59:22,826
so just follow me,

1057
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,835
and let's just get
the hell out of here.

1058
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:39,782
You know,
if we go by the G.P.S.

1059
00:59:39,982 --> 00:59:40,911
we got from Wilson,

1060
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:43,557
we're just about a mile away
from the coordinates.

1061
00:59:43,757 --> 00:59:44,719
Is that so?

1062
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,360
Yeah, but don't you think
we should call him,

1063
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,587
let him know
we're going in without backup?

1064
00:59:48,787 --> 00:59:49,653
- No.
- Why not?

1065
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:50,839
'Cause the minute
we call it in,

1066
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:52,050
every black-and-white
from here

1067
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,262
to Fort Smith
is gonna come blazing

1068
00:59:53,462 --> 00:59:54,258
through these gullies

1069
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:56,199
like they're gunning
for Bonnie and Clyde.

1070
00:59:56,399 --> 00:59:57,995
- Who?
- What?

1071
00:59:58,195 --> 00:59:59,896
Who are Bonnie and Clyde?

1072
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,598
- How old are you?
- 29.

1073
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,573
And you've never heard
of Bonnie and Clyde?

1074
01:00:03,773 --> 01:00:05,402
- No.
- How 'bout Ma Barker?

1075
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,048
- From "The Price is Right."
- Oh, for the love of...

1076
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:15,953
Hey, look.
White van, blue stripes.

1077
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:18,927
Oh, yeah. I see it.

1078
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:25,594
Where you going?

1079
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,429
I don't know.
Just anxious, I guess.

1080
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:29,393
Well, relax.

1081
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:31,072
If they're in there,
we have to wait for them

1082
01:00:31,272 --> 01:00:32,404
to make the first move.

1083
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,902
- If we wait for them...
- I said get your ass

1084
01:00:36,102 --> 01:00:37,003
back in here.

1085
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:38,936
Sorry.

1086
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,480
Give me the binoc.

1087
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,110
Here.

1088
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,811
See anything?

1089
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,991
Well, we got a plate match.

1090
01:00:50,191 --> 01:00:51,152
Then we got 'em.

1091
01:00:51,352 --> 01:00:53,128
Not yet.

1092
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,819
- Huh.
- What?

1093
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:57,587
They got four flat tires,

1094
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:00,131
and there's something weird
laying in the front yard.

1095
01:01:00,331 --> 01:01:03,104
Here. Take a look.
Tell me what you think it is.

1096
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,263
Adam:
That is strange.

1097
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:07,999
It looks like
a piece of a dummy

1098
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:09,099
all ripped up.

1099
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:11,210
That's exactly
what I thought.

1100
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,180
So, how do you want
to play this?

1101
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,650
Like always.

1102
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,677
Did you see that?
What is that thing?

1103
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:20,677
Let's get out of here.

1104
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:36,426
Wow.

1105
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:39,505
- This place is huge.
- Cavernous.

1106
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,539
♪♪

1107
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,114
You sure there's another way
out of here, Doc?

1108
01:01:56,314 --> 01:01:58,217
It does, and I'd imagine
we just need to find one

1109
01:01:58,417 --> 01:02:00,320
with easy access
to the surface.

1110
01:02:19,002 --> 01:02:21,505
So, once we're up top,
what next, girl?

1111
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:23,542
- Quiet.
- No.

1112
01:02:23,742 --> 01:02:25,375
Quiet time's over.

1113
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,312
These people have worked
way too hard

1114
01:02:27,512 --> 01:02:29,046
and lost too much
to have it end badly

1115
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,453
once you and Blondie here
take off to parts unknown.

1116
01:02:31,653 --> 01:02:33,894
Listen, bitch,
I'm the one who came up

1117
01:02:34,094 --> 01:02:34,885
with the escape plan.

1118
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,720
I'm the one who rescued us
from those sharks.

1119
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,958
Now, don't make me shoot you
out of lack of respect.

1120
01:02:40,158 --> 01:02:42,392
Excuse me.

1121
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,401
The only one allowed
to shoot anybody

1122
01:02:44,601 --> 01:02:46,430
anymore is me.

1123
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,371
And how do you figure that,
cop?

1124
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:53,537
Because you're out
of bullets.

1125
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:55,944
You blew your last round
shooting at the sharks.

1126
01:02:56,144 --> 01:02:58,886
Okay, you need to give her
her weapon back

1127
01:02:59,086 --> 01:03:00,410
right now,

1128
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,648
along with whatever
leftover ammo you might have.

1129
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:07,090
Do you really think
I'd give a psychotic like you

1130
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,251
live ammo?

1131
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,590
What? I was defenseless
hack there.

1132
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:11,555
No, you weren't.

1133
01:03:11,755 --> 01:03:13,757
You had me, John,
Michelle, the professor.

1134
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,960
You don't have
any faith in me either?

1135
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,928
Sweetie,
I know your backstory.

1136
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,937
There's no way
you'd ever raise your gun

1137
01:03:20,137 --> 01:03:21,499
to shoot at anything.

1138
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:27,738
What the hell was that?

1139
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:29,739
It's those creatures.

1140
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,193
They're speaking
to each other like whales.

1141
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:34,648
- Crap on a cracker.
- For once, professor,

1142
01:03:34,848 --> 01:03:35,967
I agree
with Honey's assessment.

1143
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:37,080
I say the sooner
we get out of here,

1144
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,658
- the better off we'll be.
- Speak for yourself.

1145
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:40,951
Yeah, Screw.

1146
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,994
There's a breeze
coming from this direction.

1147
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:43,887
Good possibility

1148
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:45,608
there's an opening
somewhere up ahead.

1149
01:03:45,808 --> 01:03:47,329
All right.
You heard the man, ladies.

1150
01:03:47,529 --> 01:03:48,325
Let's move.

1151
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:54,886
- You know what, boss?
- What?

1152
01:03:55,086 --> 01:03:56,877
You're okay.
Thanks for the trust.

1153
01:03:57,077 --> 01:03:58,602
You're welcome.

1154
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:00,509
Don't make me regret it.

1155
01:04:00,709 --> 01:04:02,005
Thank you.

1156
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:05,653
♪♪

1157
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:59,296
So, doc,
why so bright down here?

1158
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:01,339
Yeah, it looks like the walls
are lit from behind.

1159
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:02,537
Professor:
It's the phosphorous

1160
01:05:02,737 --> 01:05:03,400
from the limestone.

1161
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,802
It creates its awn type
of cold light.

1162
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:08,004
Michelle: Learn something new
every day, huh?

1163
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,044
Sounds like water running.

1164
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,080
There's a good chance.

1165
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:34,331
Guess we're not
the first ones here, huh?

1166
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:36,033
Carl: No, I read they were
mining for minerals

1167
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:36,933
about a decade ago,

1168
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,735
but they didn't find anything
worthwhile.

1169
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,040
So, they just left their stuff
there and lit off?

1170
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,380
Guess so.

1171
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,664
I don't blame 'em one bit.

1172
01:05:49,864 --> 01:05:51,881
Is that water, professor?

1173
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:53,550
I think that's
an underground river.

1174
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,560
That could lead us
to the surface. Let's go.

1175
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:09,672
Hey, come here,
all of you.

1176
01:06:09,872 --> 01:06:11,111
Is that daylight?

1177
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:14,571
- It sure is.
- Maybe we're saved.

1178
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:16,773
That's most definitely
a way out.

1179
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:17,907
- Only...
- Only what?

1180
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,595
Only to get to it,
we're all gonna have to wade

1181
01:06:19,795 --> 01:06:21,283
through about 100 yards
of water waist-deep,

1182
01:06:21,483 --> 01:06:22,078
maybe higher.

1183
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:23,313
You're thinking
some of our friends

1184
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:25,515
are just below the surface
lying in wait?

1185
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,252
It's a distinct possibility.

1186
01:06:27,452 --> 01:06:28,990
Well, I don't see any fins.

1187
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:30,157
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1188
01:06:30,357 --> 01:06:31,121
We could get ten feet out,

1189
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,800
and they'd be on us
before we knew what hit us.

1190
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:33,590
What can we do?

1191
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,558
Well,
we got a couple options.

1192
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:37,499
We can go back the way we came
and choose another path...

1193
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:39,337
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Miss me with that crap.

1194
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:40,463
That ain't happening.

1195
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,099
Oh, I actually agree
with you.

1196
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,355
Plus there's no guarantee
we'd find another exit.

1197
01:06:45,555 --> 01:06:47,611
Or we may find more water
we can't get through.

1198
01:06:47,811 --> 01:06:50,608
- Precisely.
- What's our other option?

1199
01:06:50,808 --> 01:06:51,574
Send one of us through

1200
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:53,720
to test the waters,
if you get my drift.

1201
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,851
<i>Oh, I get it, all right.</i>

1202
01:06:55,051 --> 01:06:55,779
One of us goes through,

1203
01:06:55,979 --> 01:06:57,649
and if he or she
doesn't get eaten,

1204
01:06:57,849 --> 01:06:59,419
we send the rest of 'em
through, right?

1205
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:01,189
I didn't say
it was a great option.

1206
01:07:01,389 --> 01:07:03,186
Well, I, for one,
am not down

1207
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:05,322
for a fun game
of sharkasaurus roulette.

1208
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:07,140
Look, the water
may ultimately recede,

1209
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,758
but not necessarily
on our timeline.

1210
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:12,337
Okay, so what you're saying
is we'll run out of,

1211
01:07:12,537 --> 01:07:14,531
like, food and air?

1212
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:16,499
Air, we got.
We got plenty of water.

1213
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:20,010
Food, I got a protein bar
and a pack of Twinkies.

1214
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,438
Yeah, I'm in the same boat.

1215
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:23,515
All I've got left
is half a pack of Tic Tacs.

1216
01:07:23,715 --> 01:07:24,541
Wait a minute.

1217
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,186
Michelle, you may be
on to something.

1218
01:07:26,386 --> 01:07:27,677
What? Tic Tacs?

1219
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,322
Yeah, I don't think sharks
eat Tic Tacs.

1220
01:07:29,522 --> 01:07:31,656
No, you said, "Boat."

1221
01:07:31,848 --> 01:07:35,057
- We got a raft.
- Oh, shoot. That's right.

1222
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:36,486
Well, let's go get it.

1223
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:39,166
Easy now.
You two stay here.

1224
01:07:39,366 --> 01:07:40,390
You monitor the water.

1225
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,696
You see a ripple, vibration,
anything, you take note.

1226
01:07:43,896 --> 01:07:45,195
Aren't you afraid
we'll try to escape?

1227
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,333
Nope, not at all.

1228
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:09,794
- You still see it?
- No, I think it's gone.

1229
01:08:09,994 --> 01:08:10,887
Jeez, what was that thing?

1230
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,794
I don't know,
but if I didn't know better,

1231
01:08:12,994 --> 01:08:13,927
I'd think we just had
an encounter

1232
01:08:14,127 --> 01:08:15,903
with a land shark.

1233
01:08:16,103 --> 01:08:17,093
A land shark?

1234
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:19,398
I mean, what, you mean like
from "Saturday Night Live"?

1235
01:08:19,598 --> 01:08:21,498
Oh, that, you remember?

1236
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:24,542
So, that guy was right.
It is a shark.

1237
01:08:24,742 --> 01:08:25,435
Oh, we gotta warn somebody.

1238
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:27,154
What are we gonna say?
Who's gonna believe us?

1239
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:28,874
I mean, they're gonna think
we skipped the donuts

1240
01:08:29,074 --> 01:08:30,540
and went right
for the hard stuff.

1241
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,448
Yeah, but I mean, it was real.
We saw it. We felt it.

1242
01:08:33,648 --> 01:08:34,411
Yeah, and if we did,

1243
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,818
I'm sure the escaped convicts
did as well.

1244
01:08:37,018 --> 01:08:38,081
Wait. You mean...

1245
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,783
I think that that thing,
it took away

1246
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:40,550
their only means of escape,

1247
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:43,220
and it trapped them
in the hideout.

1248
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,692
50, that ripped-up dummy
that we saw,

1249
01:08:45,892 --> 01:08:48,164
what was that,
some sort of a decoy?

1250
01:08:48,364 --> 01:08:49,626
I'd stake my pension on it.

1251
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:51,567
What do you think?
Are they still trapped inside?

1252
01:08:51,767 --> 01:08:52,562
Hard to tell.

1253
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:54,183
Pull up
the geological schematics

1254
01:08:54,383 --> 01:08:56,077
on that fancy gadget
of yours.

1255
01:08:56,277 --> 01:08:57,971
- You mean the iPad?
- Whatever.

1256
01:08:58,171 --> 01:08:59,102
See if there's anyplace

1257
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,976
they could have escaped to
given the chance.

1258
01:09:02,176 --> 01:09:03,951
- Come on.
- All right, all right.

1259
01:09:04,151 --> 01:09:04,808
According to this,

1260
01:09:05,008 --> 01:09:06,776
there is a cave entrance

1261
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,819
about 200 yards
from the back of the cabin.

1262
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:10,347
That's it, then.

1263
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:11,214
What's it?

1264
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:12,825
They threw the dummy
to the wolf,

1265
01:09:13,025 --> 01:09:14,050
and they made a run for it.

1266
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,491
Well, assuming they made it,
where do you think they went?

1267
01:09:16,691 --> 01:09:17,954
If it were me,
I'd use that cave

1268
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,878
to get the heck out of there
as quick as I could.

1269
01:09:20,078 --> 01:09:22,353
I mean, not only
do they have us hunting them,

1270
01:09:22,553 --> 01:09:24,829
they've got that creature
hunting them, too.

1271
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:26,429
Where did they come from?

1272
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:29,303
I think Hell'd
be a good place to start.

1273
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:40,243
Se?

1274
01:09:40,443 --> 01:09:41,845
Well, it looks sound enough,

1275
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:44,150
provided those things
don't slice it in half.

1276
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:45,820
Distinct possibility,
my friend.

1277
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,488
Distinct possibility.

1278
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:48,952
Yeah, and we have oars,

1279
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:50,222
so I don't have
to stick my hands

1280
01:09:50,422 --> 01:09:51,087
in the water.

1281
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,156
Yeah, I wouldn't suggest
doing that.

1282
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:55,094
Yeah, why make yourself
an appetizer?

1283
01:09:55,294 --> 01:09:57,311
Look, I found some rope,
lots of it.

1284
01:09:57,511 --> 01:09:59,329
Good girl, Michelle.
Bring it all.

1285
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:00,837
It'll make things
a hell of a lot easier.

1286
01:10:01,037 --> 01:10:01,965
Sounds good to me.

1287
01:10:02,165 --> 01:10:04,202
You ready to see
daylight again, professor?

1288
01:10:04,402 --> 01:10:06,510
Oh, I'm looking forward
to it.

1289
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:16,100
Oh, my God.
Did you just hear that?

1290
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,825
- Yeah.
- Do you think that maybe...

1291
01:10:19,025 --> 01:10:20,692
I don't know. I don't know.

1292
01:10:20,892 --> 01:10:22,318
I don't know.

1293
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:27,263
Honey, we are officially
in the sauce.

1294
01:10:27,463 --> 01:10:29,292
Take it easy, baby.

1295
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:31,494
If we have to go this alone,
we will.

1296
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,197
- Yeah, but how are we gonna...
- Put a hold on the play.

1297
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,677
I still got a good feeling
about this.

1298
01:10:36,877 --> 01:10:38,167
He may be a relic,

1299
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:40,870
but that old guard
has what it takes.

1300
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,907
I hope you're right.

1301
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,514
Come on, Sham.

1302
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,421
You can't afford
to go to pieces right now.

1303
01:10:53,621 --> 01:10:54,717
We've come too far.

1304
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:58,455
Just leave me. I don't care.
I don't care.

1305
01:10:58,655 --> 01:10:59,322
Look at me, little girl.

1306
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:00,899
I know
you didn't ask for this,

1307
01:11:01,099 --> 01:11:01,858
but we're here.

1308
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:03,211
Now, we gotta make
the best of it.

1309
01:11:03,411 --> 01:11:04,565
And that young man
who put his life

1310
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:05,695
on the line for you,

1311
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:08,205
he wouldn't want you
to give up,

1312
01:11:08,405 --> 01:11:09,499
and neither do I.

1313
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:11,200
That goes ditto for me,
girl.

1314
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,609
So, dry those eyes,
and let's get topside, okay?

1315
01:11:14,809 --> 01:11:16,773
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1316
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:18,258
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't worry.

1317
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:19,743
Now, listen,
we get out of here

1318
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:20,577
in one piece,

1319
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,256
I'll have a nice, long talk
with the warden

1320
01:11:22,456 --> 01:11:23,746
about your case, okay?

1321
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,602
Michelle:
Hey, what about me?

1322
01:11:25,802 --> 01:11:27,459
No love
for your lotus blossom?

1323
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:28,929
You, too, Michelle.

1324
01:11:29,129 --> 01:11:30,124
You, too.

1325
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,665
Anita:
There hasn't been a ripple.

1326
01:11:39,865 --> 01:11:41,107
Maybe we should
just risk it.

1327
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,635
Personally, I'd rather wait
for the raft.

1328
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:48,339
Yeah, the raft
that may or may not be coming.

1329
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,679
Hey, you two.

1330
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:54,611
Honey:
Praise the Lord.

1331
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,688
I thought you were
never coming back.

1332
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,041
Where's the professor?

1333
01:12:04,241 --> 01:12:05,922
He didn't make it.

1334
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:08,891
We heard gunshots.
What happened?

1335
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,968
Let's just leave it at,
"He didn't make it."

1336
01:12:11,168 --> 01:12:11,961
Okay, well,

1337
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,915
how are we gonna get
this party started?

1338
01:12:14,115 --> 01:12:15,869
Okay, listen,
I'll go first, all right?

1339
01:12:16,069 --> 01:12:17,233
If I get across safely,

1340
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,276
tie a rope
to both ends of the boat,

1341
01:12:19,476 --> 01:12:20,503
pull you all across.

1342
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,240
In this thing?

1343
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,773
Good idea.

1344
01:12:23,973 --> 01:12:25,714
Michelle,
help me with the ropes.

1345
01:12:25,914 --> 01:12:27,016
Done.

1346
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:33,119
All right, make a left
at the mile marker.

1347
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:34,617
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1348
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,353
According to the geological
survey map,

1349
01:12:36,553 --> 01:12:37,756
there's an entrance
to the cave

1350
01:12:37,956 --> 01:12:39,159
about a half a mile
west of here.

1351
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:40,957
Okeydokey.

1352
01:12:41,157 --> 01:12:43,897
Just watch out for any more
of those land sharks.

1353
01:12:44,097 --> 01:12:46,837
- You had to remind me.
- How could you forget?

1354
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:00,880
Now,
if something goes wrong,

1355
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:01,811
I'm counting on you.

1356
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:03,581
Pull me back
with all you got.

1357
01:13:03,781 --> 01:13:04,819
We've got your back, sir.

1358
01:13:05,019 --> 01:13:05,986
Good luck.

1359
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,275
- He made it.
- That, he did.

1360
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,645
See, I told you
he had the guts.

1361
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:10,868
Okay, pull the boat back.

1362
01:14:11,068 --> 01:14:13,091
Come across two by two.

1363
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:14,083
Will do.

1364
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,901
Honey:
Come on, pull.

1365
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,571
All right, ladies.
See you on the other side.

1366
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,583
Gut it?

1367
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:01,063
Oh, what is that?

1368
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:03,750
I don't know.
Let's just keep on rowing.

1369
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:06,438
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no. Don't worry.

1370
01:15:06,638 --> 01:15:08,307
- Oh, my God.
- Don't get scared.

1371
01:15:08,507 --> 01:15:10,177
No, let's go.
We can do this.

1372
01:15:44,173 --> 01:15:45,709
Okay, I got it.

1373
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:47,977
I see him.

1374
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:49,178
There he is.
Go, go, go.

1375
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,555
I'm going.

1376
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,392
Oh, my God.

1377
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:00,356
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1378
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,891
We're almost there.
We made it. We made it.

1379
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:03,734
- We got it.
- Give me your hand.

1380
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,501
Here we go.

1381
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:09,938
All right, pull it back.

1382
01:16:22,445 --> 01:16:24,948
All right, baby,
time to get the hell out.

1383
01:16:25,148 --> 01:16:26,517
I'm right behind you.

1384
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,499
Come on. come on.

1385
01:16:40,699 --> 01:16:42,472
Come on. We gut this.

1386
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:16,906
Whoa.

1387
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,811
- Whoa.
- Watch out.

1388
01:17:30,613 --> 01:17:32,183
Shannon.

1389
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:37,029
Anita.

1390
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,346
Let's get the hell
out of here.

1391
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,157
Give me your hand.

1392
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,716
Suppose you'll be wanting this
back now.

1393
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:40,349
You know, I been thinking...

1394
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:44,497
it's too bad everyone but me
had to die down there.

1395
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:48,457
Only Shannon's body
to recover,

1396
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:52,461
the rest devoured
by those creatures.

1397
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:56,370
It's gonna make recovery
and identification

1398
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:57,867
damn near impossible.

1399
01:18:59,702 --> 01:19:02,338
The girl I feel
most sorry for

1400
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:04,347
is the one with a kid
waiting for her.

1401
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,417
Child needs a mom
to grow up well.

1402
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:13,117
So, I'm gonna turn around now

1403
01:19:13,317 --> 01:19:16,318
and start looking for help.

1404
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:20,022
If I see one
of those damn land sharks,

1405
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:20,890
I'm gonna look
that son of a bitch

1406
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:24,230
right in the eye
and tell him to bugger off.

1407
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:25,569
