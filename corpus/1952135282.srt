1
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:06,661
Yeah, Kirk with the scene
down here at the county line.

2
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,208
We have nine officers along the route,

3
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:11,574
and we are here standing by.

4
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:20,111
Come on!

5
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,007
Hold on,
Sal!

6
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:29,559
Advise Highway Patrol
to set up roadblocks. Over.

7
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:30,653
Move it.

8
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,061
I'm coming. I'm coming.

9
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:33,827
Two escaped felons
last seen heading eastbound.

10
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,367
Could be armed and dangerous.

11
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:41,433
Advise the Highway Patrol
to set up roadblocks. Over.

12
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:56,752
Advise Highway Patrol
to set up roadblocks. Over.

13
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:09,992
Dispatch, this is Bravo.

14
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,198
Requesting an additional
K9 unit confirmed to Sector 4.

15
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:15,867
- Hold position.
- Anybody see tracks?

16
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:17,705
Okay, Bravo. On their way. Over.

17
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:19,210
Nothing this way.

18
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,116
Crap. Sergeant?

19
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:27,915
Do something! Shoot!

20
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,125
Hit him back.

21
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,666
Get out of there.
Get out of there.

22
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:42,224
They're shooting.

23
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,058
Why? No, no!

24
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:07,491
Please, help!

25
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,231
Let's get out of here, huh?

26
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:22,267
Come on, Sal.

27
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:24,902
Listen.

28
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:42,058
Can anybody hear me? Over.

29
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:45,097
This is bad, Sal.

30
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:46,257
Let's get the hell out of here.

31
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,561
Captain Bradford, this is Dispatch.

32
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:49,295
- Unable to receive last message.
- Shut up.

33
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:50,859
Please repeat. John?

34
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:54,373
- This is bad.
- John? You there?

35
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:56,102
Can anybody hear me?

36
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:57,609
Over.

37
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:02,204
All units report
to Sector 4 immediately.

38
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:04,045
Over.

39
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:06,813
All units report to Sector 4 immediately.

40
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:08,285
Over.

41
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:10,949
Can anybody hear me?

42
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:16,093
Can anybody hear me?

43
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:17,356
Repeat, this is...

44
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,455
Eddie, the shotgun.

45
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:21,500
- Can anybody hear me?
- Eddie, the shotgun.

46
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:36,976
What did this?

47
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:39,649
I don't know.

48
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:43,479
Could have been a gator.

49
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:45,251
But I'd rather not find out.

50
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:46,883
Come on, let's move.

51
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:50,886
Good morning, Delmar.

52
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:53,721
Five more feet to the truck
and it would've been.

53
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:55,351
What's that?

54
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:58,192
I said, "My sweet Lord, I'm in luck.

55
00:06:58,264 --> 00:06:59,993
It's Mrs. Brannigan."

56
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:03,331
I used that cream that you recommended
on Fluffy's sores,

57
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:04,927
and they cleared right up.

58
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:07,165
But now she's got this terrible gas.

59
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:10,705
Fluffy!

60
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:11,801
Do you have any suggestions?

61
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,904
Yeah. Stop feeding her fruit.

62
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:17,472
But oranges are her favorite.

63
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,780
Have a nice day.

64
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:40,367
Today's special.

65
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,203
Rats à la carte.

66
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,641
Delmar, would you
get rid of them things?

67
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:46,474
You know, with
the breeding rate in rats,

68
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:48,514
in just about 18 months,

69
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:52,210
two of these little hairballs can produce
one-and-a-half million offspring.

70
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:54,446
It's too bad you're not a rat, Delmar.

71
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:57,490
With odds like that,
you might actually get laid.

72
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:00,988
Yeah, said the man
in the grease-stained apron

73
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,722
with the rotten teeth
and breath to match.

74
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:07,062
Esther, next time you hear
scurrying around in the cupboards,

75
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,862
might I suggest an exterminator?

76
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:11,062
Thanks, Delmar.

77
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:17,709
Good afternoon, ladies.

78
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:20,109
Hi, Doll-mar.

79
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:22,608
Doll-mar.

80
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:25,116
That's cute. That's real cute.

81
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,551
You ladies weren't swimming
down at Bailey Pond, were you?

82
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,645
Yeah. So?

83
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:31,553
That's too bad.

84
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:35,526
I was just headed down that way
to post the signs.

85
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:37,460
There's no swimming
down at Bailey Pond.

86
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,555
Why not?

87
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:41,725
A couple of fishermen
pulled some trout out of there,

88
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:45,931
and they had these big,
bloody sores on them.

89
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:47,336
I can't confirm it yet,

90
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,875
but I think it's
them flesh-eating bacteria.

91
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:51,843
Young man!

92
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,469
Can I get my check, please?

93
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:54,979
Yeah.

94
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:57,278
You have a good day.

95
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:06,683
Animal Control to Officer Coates.

96
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,626
Animal Control to Officer Coates.

97
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:13,132
Officer Coates, this is
Animal Control Headquarters.

98
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:15,190
Come in, Delmar. It's me, Cleavis.

99
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:17,236
It's Cleavis.

100
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:20,795
Cleavis, what's my day look like?

101
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:22,569
Oh, yeah, boss.

102
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:26,373
Some lady out at the trailer park
says her dog's gone missing.

103
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:30,610
And Mel Gordon says
he's got a snake living under his porch

104
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:34,141
with a mouth so big,
it could eat a basketball.

105
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,744
I told him to lay off the sauce,

106
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:38,814
but he insists that you
go out and take a look.

107
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:41,417
So what are you doing?

108
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:44,019
Holding down the fort.

109
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:47,533
Why don't you get off your lazy butt
and help me out?

110
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,261
What's that?

111
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:51,633
I said, Mel Gordon sounds crazy.

112
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:52,728
I'll check it out.

113
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:54,238
Copy.

114
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,123
Jay, in case you hadn't noticed,

115
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,057
the road has now ceased being a road.

116
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:15,719
Yeah, dude.
Where the hell you taking us?

117
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:18,958
I'm just following the directions
Dr. Abramson gave us.

118
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:20,693
Dr. Abramson.

119
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:23,759
Dr. Abramson is a well-known
and well-respected scientist.

120
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,394
He's head of the ETF.

121
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:27,098
ETF.

122
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:28,401
What's that stand for?

123
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:29,998
Equal Treatment for Fat Girls?

124
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,135
Try again, Einstein.

125
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:34,679
It's the Environmental Task Force.

126
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:37,045
Bunch of lab coats
sent down here on the federal payroll

127
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:39,243
to find a solution to our eel problem.

128
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:40,718
Didn't know we had an eel problem.

129
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:42,186
Monopterus albus, boys.

130
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:43,950
Asian swamp eels.

131
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:46,116
No one knows exactly when the first one

132
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:47,819
came off the ballast of some cargo ship,

133
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:49,919
but indeed they came,

134
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,395
they stayed,

135
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:54,092
and now they're taking over.

136
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:06,478
I don't know why you always call that guy.

137
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:07,843
He's such a joke.

138
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:10,348
Delmar's cute.

139
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,883
You want to get rid of them rats?

140
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:13,316
Feed them some of your chili.

141
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:14,819
Get back to work.

142
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,878
Watch out.

143
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,786
Excuse me.

144
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:37,006
Damn dogs been in the trash again!

145
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:41,337
Damn dogs.

146
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:25,215
Don't do that!

147
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,883
You call me?

148
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,824
Never mind.

149
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:58,988
Where the hell is that little panty-sniffer?

150
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:00,320
Yeah.

151
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:01,985
Where is your dad, loser?

152
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,722
Like to launch the canoes
before Christmas.

153
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:08,699
He said he w-would be here.

154
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:11,498
Did he happen to say
wh-wh-wh-wh-when?

155
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:16,304
I'm here! I'm here!

156
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:18,603
Sorry I'm late.

157
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:20,339
Casey, don't forget your sunblock.

158
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:21,846
Ass-crack.

159
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,644
10 means 10. You got it?

160
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:27,584
Thank you, Lott, for your
constructive criticism.

161
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:29,780
All right, are we ready to go?

162
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:31,380
How about you, Everett?

163
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:32,685
You ready to go?

164
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:35,226
Sure, Dad.

165
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:36,454
Okay.

166
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:41,364
I got some extra just in case,
so keep it with you.

167
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:43,902
Hey, Cliff, let me talk to you a minute.

168
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,665
Listen.

169
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:48,673
If anything happens
to my boy out there, I mean anything,

170
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:51,710
I'm going to jam this stick up your ass

171
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:54,473
and roast you like a marshmallow.

172
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:56,378
We understand one another?

173
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:57,609
Yeah.

174
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,150
Good.

175
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:02,312
Let's go over some safety instructions
before we get going.

176
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:04,913
While you jocks are
doing this for extra credit,

177
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:08,051
we're doing research
that could save the environment.

178
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,029
The eels are threatening
the entire ecosystem.

179
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:16,398
This guy, Dr. Abram-injun-son,

180
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:17,731
he's going to get rid of them?

181
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:21,102
Yeah. He's looking
for some kind of weakness.

182
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:24,610
Dude, an Achilles eel.

183
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,309
Extra credit kicks ass.

184
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,041
C-minus, here I come.

185
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:34,115
- Okay, guys.
- Paddle faster.

186
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,348
Let's get our gear
and have a great weekend.

187
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,683
You might want to
actually try to paddle.

188
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,557
- Now, you kids have fun.
- All right.

189
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:44,687
- Bye.
- Bye.

190
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:48,326
See you, buddy.

191
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:49,891
Y'all be safe out there!
You hear me?

192
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:52,130
Bye. Love you.

193
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:07,619
What are you looking at, dork?

194
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:09,052
Just paddle.

195
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,054
We're not trying to cause
any unnecessary anxiety.

196
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:17,561
We just ask that you keep
your eyes and ears open

197
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,495
and your doors locked.

198
00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:21,465
If you go out at night,
make sure you take

199
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:23,468
a flashlight, mace, and your cell phone.

200
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:26,403
I would also recommend
going in pairs or groups.

201
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:29,870
Dogcatcher's here.

202
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:32,809
Otherwise, just go back
to your normal routine.

203
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,743
Chicken and beer.

204
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:36,805
That's my normal routine.

205
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:40,215
Maybe you could add a breath mint
and a shower to the list.

206
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:44,314
You heard the sheriff.
Let's clear out of here.

207
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,483
You're just jealous.

208
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:52,153
Hey, Delmar.

209
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:53,892
Hey, Sheriff.

210
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,298
That's how it's gonna be, huh?

211
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:58,860
The divorce was your idea, remember?

212
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:00,132
Let's not start.

213
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:03,538
So what's all the hubbub?

214
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:06,373
Two prisoners escaped from
County Penitentiary last night.

215
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,913
The search party is missing
and hasn't reported in.

216
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:10,312
I saw the APB.

217
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:12,248
You think they're headed our way?

218
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:13,512
We're just playing it safe.

219
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:14,883
We're warning everybody
that lives along the river.

220
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:19,220
Yeah, well, escaped convicts,
it's outside of my area of expertise.

221
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:21,317
You know somebody
that's missing a dog?

222
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:23,885
I did. That was me.

223
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:25,760
Delmar Coates, Animal Control.

224
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:26,820
How you doin', ma'am?

225
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,560
Well, hello there.

226
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:30,625
Uh, what kind of dog is it?

227
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,398
An Irish Wolfhound.

228
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:34,405
Big dog, hard to miss. Name's Duke.

229
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:35,735
I'd just set out dinner.

230
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:37,207
How long has he been missing?

231
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:38,675
Since last night.

232
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:40,837
Has he been sick at all lately?

233
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:42,107
Oh, no.

234
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:44,012
Duke's as healthy as a horse.

235
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,813
Only three months old.

236
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:48,410
Well, I'll check it out.
Wait here, ma'am...

237
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:49,511
Like I was saying,

238
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:51,215
Duke's never not
come home for dinner.

239
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,451
I even made
his favorite food... watermelon.

240
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:55,426
He just loves watermelon.

241
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:58,787
What's with all the fruit?

242
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,422
Hasn't anyone heard of pet food?

243
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:06,703
Now, if I were Duke,
where would I be hiding?

244
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:16,406
Did you find something?

245
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:22,919
I don't know. Maybe.

246
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,218
Cliff's Canoe Club.

247
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:28,658
My office warned Cliff
about the convicts.

248
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:30,059
He'll take care of the kids.

249
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:31,960
59 bottles of beer

250
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,431
Take one down, pass it around

251
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,934
58 bottles of beer on the wall

252
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:56,780
Whoa.

253
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:59,017
What happened here?

254
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:00,922
Dr. Abramson?

255
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:02,324
Yo, Doc.

256
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:09,423
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

257
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:10,799
Careful. That might be loaded.

258
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,235
Hey, hey, hey.

259
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:14,169
Don't point that thing
at a lady. Come on.

260
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,537
You all right, Holly?

261
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:18,168
- Don't point it at a guy.
- Sorry.

262
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,271
Dr. Abramson?

263
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:30,112
That must be Dr. Abramson's hat.

264
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:33,022
- Dude, I've seen this movie.
- Yeah.

265
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:35,424
The guy's missing,
and all they find is his hat.

266
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:38,361
Yeah, and when he goes to pick it up,

267
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:40,831
only thing under there
is his decapitated head.

268
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:45,033
That's so funny.

269
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:46,469
That's real mature.

270
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:49,007
I'm telling you.

271
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,451
- You're such infants.
- No!

272
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:11,962
Don't do that! Stupid!

273
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:15,391
What was that?

274
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,246
Please tell me that was just
a harmless little guppy.

275
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:33,785
Shoot it, dude.

276
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:35,821
Shoot what, Mark?
I don't see anything.

277
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:37,446
Over there.

278
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:40,047
What are we looking at?

279
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:47,561
Dr. Abramson?

280
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:48,930
Well, that depends.

281
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,765
Are you my interns
or are you with the EPA?

282
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:53,828
Uh, we're from the university.

283
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,364
Dr. Soren Abramson,

284
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:59,377
and welcome to my laboratory.

285
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:02,141
Dr. Abramson, I'm Holly Shubert.

286
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:03,704
It's a pleasure.

287
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:05,716
I've admired you...

288
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:08,048
your work for...

289
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,644
The pleasure is mine.

290
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:11,917
And you can call me Soren.

291
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,822
Uh, Jay Wells, sir.

292
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,918
It's just... It's a pleasure to meet you.

293
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:18,327
- We talked on the phone.
- How do you do?

294
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:20,729
Mark.

295
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,289
Hello.

296
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:24,700
- Dean.
- Yes.

297
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,136
Well, it's absolutely
wonderful to have you all.

298
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:28,264
If I may.

299
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,639
Thank you very much. Right.

300
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,770
As you can see from the current state
of my organizational system,

301
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:37,816
I am in desperate need
of a few extra hands at the moment.

302
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:40,681
So if you'll all get your equipment,
we'll get started.

303
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,459
How much further?

304
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:54,465
Not much farther.

305
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:55,625
I recognize these trees.

306
00:20:57,903 --> 00:20:59,734
Is this it?

307
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:03,169
Duke? Come on, boy!

308
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:04,300
Duke.

309
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:09,337
Come on, Duke.

310
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:11,440
I never meant to hurt you, you know.

311
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:14,213
Okay. Here, Duke.

312
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:16,686
Here, Duke.

313
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:27,296
Here, Duke.

314
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:29,826
Delmar.

315
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:31,597
It's gonna be dark soon.
We gotta get back.

316
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,399
I was hoping we could still be friends?

317
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,075
Of course we can, Sheriff.

318
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:42,309
Something just
brushed up against my leg.

319
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:44,042
- There! There it is again!
- Whoa!

320
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:45,208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Annie Oakley.

321
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:46,273
What the hell is it?

322
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:48,650
It's just an eel. It's a baby eel.

323
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,154
Jeez, I thought
it was a water snake.

324
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:51,655
There it goes.

325
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:59,030
Aw, damn.

326
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:00,531
Is that Duke?

327
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,396
Well, what's left of him.

328
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:04,561
Oh, what could have done that?

329
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:06,867
Gator, probably.

330
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:09,464
A very, very hungry gator.

331
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:12,767
Come on, let's head back.

332
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:18,282
Oh, great. Oh, what the hell?

333
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:21,382
Oh, my God.

334
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:23,444
You wouldn't be overdoing
the chocolate again, would you?

335
00:22:23,522 --> 00:22:25,490
Because I know how you tend
to be an emotional eater.

336
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:27,855
Screw you, Delmar.
The hole was here. I didn't do this.

337
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:30,360
Forget it.

338
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:31,896
I wouldn't do that.

339
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:33,556
Why not?

340
00:22:33,632 --> 00:22:34,997
You don't know what
made that hole, Ruth.

341
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:40,301
Well, I can't walk back all that way
with one damn shoe.

342
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:42,101
Come here.

343
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:43,163
What?

344
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:44,436
Come here.

345
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:48,611
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.

346
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:50,046
Just shut up.

347
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:51,104
Enjoy the ride.

348
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:17,802
Pepper.

349
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:20,140
Pepper, Daddy's home.

350
00:23:24,616 --> 00:23:26,413
Pepper?

351
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,830
Pepper!

352
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:01,483
Wow.

353
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:03,487
She's taking it hard.

354
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:07,389
Yeah. Well, a lot of people can get
real attached to their pets.

355
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:12,522
Some folks actually prefer
animals over people.

356
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:14,725
Yeah. I was married
to somebody like that.

357
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:18,235
Well, from what I understand,
it has something to do

358
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:20,567
with the fact that pets
don't want us to be different.

359
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:23,904
They accept us the way we are.

360
00:24:25,577 --> 00:24:29,377
Well, I really appreciate
what you did back there.

361
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:30,437
You didn't... You didn't have to do that.

362
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:33,383
No, but I wanted to.

363
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,346
Well...

364
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:39,447
I better get back to work.

365
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:41,891
Hey, Ruth.

366
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,120
Yeah?

367
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,561
It really wasn't all that bad, was it?

368
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:50,828
I remember some good parts.

369
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,467
Pepper!

370
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,474
Pepper!

371
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:11,153
This is gonna be a big one.

372
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:14,216
Oh, yeah.

373
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:22,628
What?

374
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:24,859
I see.

375
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:28,058
Take a look.

376
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:34,136
Notice anything unusual?

377
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:38,866
Looks like some kind of
chromosomal disorder.

378
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:40,411
Exactly.

379
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:42,344
I call it the Abramson gene.

380
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:44,780
It's a defect I discovered
in some of the eels.

381
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,318
It causes sterility
both in the male and female.

382
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:49,820
I found a way to reconstruct it.

383
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:52,880
Genetic engineering.

384
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,721
Is that legal?

385
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:58,251
I assure you, from a scientific
point of view, it's quite legal.

386
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,662
But is it ethical?

387
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:03,132
These eels have no known predator.

388
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:04,998
They're at the top of the food chain.

389
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,904
They devour everything.

390
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:11,067
It'll save the ecosystem.

391
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:13,634
Now, is that ethical?

392
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:15,339
Hey, Doc!

393
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:16,745
What are these?

394
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,544
Eel traps.

395
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:20,551
We'll use them
to collect eels downriver.

396
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,918
So these are, like,
to catch the babies?

397
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:25,081
No, adults.

398
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:28,058
We could run into some
as large as 3 feet.

399
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:31,061
How in the hell's a 3-foot eel
gonna fit through a hole this size?

400
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:32,653
Same way I do, dude.

401
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:34,221
Lubricated.

402
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:37,293
You're half-right.

403
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,896
The eel secretes a mucus to facilitate
its movement over dry land.

404
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:42,338
It can be quite slippery.

405
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:45,342
But more to the point,
the eel is almost completely muscle.

406
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,809
Like me.

407
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:50,972
It can redistribute its mass to fit in
almost anywhere it wants to go.

408
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:52,038
Wait a minute.

409
00:27:52,117 --> 00:27:55,553
You just said that
they move over dry land?

410
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,087
Won't they die out of water?

411
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:59,282
They have gills for their
primary oxygen intake,

412
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:01,485
but they can also respire
through their snout.

413
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,755
Pretty bad-ass, then?

414
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:05,023
You don't know the half of it.

415
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:08,533
They have a mouth
full of razor-sharp teeth

416
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,696
and a jaw so powerful...

417
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:14,238
I knew a man.

418
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:18,106
Eel got hold of his leg.

419
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:22,978
He had to cut off its head
before it'd let go of him.

420
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:28,915
Did that really happen?

421
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:31,854
What do you think?

422
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:07,852
Fluffy?

423
00:29:18,437 --> 00:29:19,631
Hold on.

424
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:29,804
Sure you want to do this?

425
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:31,815
No.

426
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,022
Then why are we...

427
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:42,652
'Cause life is complicated.

428
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:45,560
Let's get complicated.

429
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,237
What about...

430
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:07,874
Fluffy?

431
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:30,706
Fluffy.

432
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:51,682
Fluffy.

433
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:56,690
Sweetie.

434
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:02,862
Fluffy.

435
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:08,672
Sweetie, where are you?

436
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:21,680
Did you hear something?

437
00:32:21,753 --> 00:32:23,550
No.

438
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:33,690
Help!

439
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:45,576
Dude, this sucks butt.

440
00:32:45,644 --> 00:32:49,045
Yeah, it does suck.

441
00:32:49,114 --> 00:32:52,208
But we need the extra credit.

442
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:01,284
What are those?

443
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,884
A little power-up.

444
00:33:03,962 --> 00:33:05,793
Man, I thought you were off the juice.

445
00:33:05,864 --> 00:33:08,059
Look, this isn't steroids, dawg.

446
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:12,968
It's Gluco-Zee supplement tablets.

447
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:15,438
I don't know, some kind of new
instant energy thing, dude.

448
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:18,806
They taste like sugar.

449
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,538
It's 'cause they are sugar, idiot.

450
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:22,739
Jeez.

451
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:26,777
Just shut up and pull up the trap.

452
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:31,185
You know what? This does suck.

453
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:34,487
Jay's probably back there
all cuddled up with Holly in the truck,

454
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,652
and we're out here with the freakin' eels.

455
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:42,230
What's so funny?

456
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,234
You like her.

457
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:45,667
No.

458
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:47,102
I know that look, dude. You're lying.

459
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:48,196
No, I don't.

460
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:49,399
Yeah, whatever, Gaylord.

461
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:53,337
Dude.

462
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:54,776
Look in the window.

463
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:58,077
She's hot and naked and ready.

464
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:01,346
Dude, dude, dude, dude,
dude, dude...

465
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,614
Dude.

466
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:06,623
That is the extra credit
we've been waiting for.

467
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:11,327
Get out of here!

468
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:12,829
Perverts!

469
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:14,694
Thank you.

470
00:34:16,134 --> 00:34:18,602
- Thank you very much!
- Yeah!

471
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:24,933
Holy crap!

472
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:43,460
Dude, someone lost a canoe.

473
00:35:57,869 --> 00:35:59,461
Animal Control.

474
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:02,836
Where's that joker Delmar?

475
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:05,774
Why didn't he come out here
to check on this damn snake?

476
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:07,038
Oh, hey, Mel.

477
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:08,703
He's probably been busy.

478
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,510
You sure what you saw was a snake

479
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,279
and not maybe a pink elephant?

480
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:21,020
You take yourself, and you go
straight to H-E double toothpicks.

481
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:22,855
I know what I seen!

482
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:27,159
Give me 15 minutes.

483
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:30,565
But, Mel, there better
be a snake out there,

484
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:33,763
or I'm gonna break that bottle
over your head.

485
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:49,453
Delmar?

486
00:36:50,455 --> 00:36:52,218
Delmar?

487
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,908
How is it I don't remember

488
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:22,646
having this much sex
when we were married?

489
00:37:24,689 --> 00:37:26,987
When did you have the time?

490
00:37:27,058 --> 00:37:28,355
If I wanted your attention,

491
00:37:28,426 --> 00:37:30,951
I had to dress up like a bear

492
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:35,398
or paint myself like
a deadly African swamp fish.

493
00:37:38,202 --> 00:37:40,295
Not a swamp fish.

494
00:37:40,371 --> 00:37:44,603
More like a blowfish.

495
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:54,644
You want to get something?

496
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,186
Starving.

497
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:58,313
And you want to go to the diner.

498
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:09,263
Mel?

499
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:11,165
Mel Gordon!

500
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:15,933
Oh, come on, Mel.

501
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:18,669
Don't go playing games with me now.

502
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:22,076
Son of a...

503
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,710
Aw, gee, Mel.

504
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:28,752
What'd you go and do to yourself?

505
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:55,910
- Something's wrong.
- This is weird.

506
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:02,416
Are they closed?

507
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:06,317
That would be a first.

508
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:25,005
Well, looks like someone tried the chili.

509
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:29,011
Think it was those two
escaped from County?

510
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:34,074
Let's take a look.

511
00:39:57,075 --> 00:39:59,043
Aw, jeez.

512
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,010
I thought I got rid of all those.

513
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:16,289
I have to call this in.

514
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,486
There is food all over the...

515
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:21,759
That's not food.

516
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:31,041
Ruthie!

517
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:33,600
All hell's breaking loose.

518
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:34,975
I've just come
from Mel Gordon's place.

519
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:36,741
I found him up on the roof dead.

520
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:39,544
Something took a bite
out of him, a big bite.

521
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:41,949
Hell, Ruthie, he was gone
from the waist down.

522
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:45,445
Delmar, one of your
trucks was out there.

523
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:49,050
Excuse me. Coming through.

524
00:40:49,127 --> 00:40:51,186
I found this.

525
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,261
Aw, Cleavis.

526
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:58,393
That ain't the half of it.

527
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:01,029
I just got a call from Dr. Abramson.

528
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:02,766
Some of his college interns
found a canoe

529
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,932
out by Kerchner Crossing.

530
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:06,238
Problem is last anybody
saw this canoe,

531
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,938
it was full of members of
the Mountain View Canoe Club.

532
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:11,208
All right. I'd better head up there.

533
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:12,374
Wait.

534
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,247
One of them boys missing
is Lott Dryer's son.

535
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:16,786
He's out there now. He's all riled up.

536
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:18,719
He's putting together
some sort of damn posse.

537
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,223
Gonna hunt down whoever's responsible.

538
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,417
I'll deal with it.

539
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:23,187
Get me the most recent
mug shots on those convicts.

540
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:24,922
You don't think they had
something to do with this?

541
00:41:24,996 --> 00:41:27,362
Somebody did a number on this place.

542
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:28,489
Or some thing.

543
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:33,931
You okay?

544
00:41:34,005 --> 00:41:35,973
Yeah.

545
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:50,813
See that?

546
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:51,877
Just like I told you.

547
00:41:51,956 --> 00:41:53,480
This is your cousin's place?

548
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:54,616
Yeah. Come on.

549
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,750
Come on.

550
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:16,877
Contact Fire and Rescue.

551
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:19,007
See if we can one
of their choppers in the air.

552
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:20,880
We're gonna need
eyes on the ground, too.

553
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:23,216
Get as many volunteers as you can.

554
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:25,414
I want a deputy assigned to each group.

555
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:26,922
Make sure they all have maps
and communications.

556
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:28,015
Got it.

557
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:31,425
They were last seen right here,
moving in this direction.

558
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:32,928
Now, we form a line.

559
00:42:32,997 --> 00:42:35,727
Push those sons of bitches northwest.

560
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,325
Sheriff, our kids are out there.

561
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:40,632
Ladies, we're going to find your kids.

562
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:42,764
Just give all your information
to Deputy Horner.

563
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,001
It'll be okay.

564
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:46,236
Look out!

565
00:42:47,745 --> 00:42:50,805
If you see anything...
I mean anything... suspicious,

566
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:53,578
don't worry about the ammo.

567
00:42:53,651 --> 00:42:54,913
Rounds are on me.

568
00:42:56,053 --> 00:42:57,782
You want to talk to them students,

569
00:42:57,855 --> 00:42:59,447
that's them over there
with Dr. Abramson.

570
00:42:59,523 --> 00:43:00,751
What are we looking for, exactly?

571
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:03,385
Delmar, will you take that?

572
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:06,055
I've got bigger fish to fry.

573
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,030
Okay, now, right here...

574
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:09,896
Lott Dryer.

575
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,936
You can just climb back into that truck
and head yourself on home.

576
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:15,097
One of those boys out there's mine.

577
00:43:15,172 --> 00:43:18,164
And I'm gonna help find him
whether you like it or not.

578
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:19,800
We're going to find your son.

579
00:43:19,877 --> 00:43:22,903
It's the cowboy tactics
that's not the kind of help I need.

580
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:33,385
Ruth... he's the only boy I got.

581
00:43:35,693 --> 00:43:40,096
Fine. But if you get in my way,
I'll have you arrested.

582
00:43:40,164 --> 00:43:43,224
Any of those sons of bitches
lay a hand on my boy...

583
00:43:45,169 --> 00:43:46,864
you'll arrest me...

584
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:48,428
for murder.

585
00:43:55,212 --> 00:43:57,737
I knew I'd find you
slithering around out here.

586
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:00,914
Delmar.

587
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:03,852
Somehow, I knew our paths
would cross again.

588
00:44:03,988 --> 00:44:05,285
Tell me about the eel.

589
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:07,381
Eel? What eel?

590
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:17,393
Esther out at the diner is dead.

591
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:19,663
Cleavis is dead.

592
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:20,829
Mel Gordon, all dead.

593
00:44:20,905 --> 00:44:22,702
Now, you tell me
about the goddamn eel.

594
00:44:22,773 --> 00:44:24,832
What is happening here?

595
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:26,638
Ask him.

596
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:28,303
What's the story?

597
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:30,313
Officer Coates seems to believe

598
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,508
that I might be partially responsible

599
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:33,709
for what's been going on around here.

600
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:36,184
Not partially. Entirely.

601
00:44:36,253 --> 00:44:38,687
We're talking about a giant eel here, Ruth.

602
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:39,882
A mutant.

603
00:44:39,957 --> 00:44:41,390
One of Dr. Frankenstein's monsters.

604
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:44,553
Really, Delmar. Monsters?

605
00:44:44,628 --> 00:44:46,721
Delmar, I've got two escaped felons,

606
00:44:46,797 --> 00:44:48,890
a dozen parents worried
half out of their minds.

607
00:44:48,966 --> 00:44:50,331
Now, I'm sorry.

608
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:53,302
You can't expect me
to spend my resources on a witch hunt.

609
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:54,531
Besides, do you really think

610
00:44:54,605 --> 00:44:56,869
the ETF would have
one of their top scientists

611
00:44:56,941 --> 00:45:00,468
going around creating
a race of killer eel?

612
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:03,638
No. Not since they suspended him
six months ago.

613
00:45:04,982 --> 00:45:06,574
Doc?

614
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,277
Tell them the truth.

615
00:45:10,254 --> 00:45:13,155
We hatched a specimen in the lab.

616
00:45:13,224 --> 00:45:15,920
It grew to 6 feet in the first two months.

617
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:20,862
I was about to publish our results
when it attacked a colleague.

618
00:45:20,931 --> 00:45:23,058
Killed him.

619
00:45:23,134 --> 00:45:25,159
I mean, she escaped
before we could trap her.

620
00:45:25,236 --> 00:45:26,396
And you didn't tell anyone?

621
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,961
Nobody in the task force

622
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,702
wanted to admit that we'd
made the problem worse.

623
00:45:31,776 --> 00:45:33,038
God help us.

624
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,977
We embedded a tracking chip
in the eel's jaw.

625
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:38,447
I've been out here
looking for her ever since.

626
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:41,314
Dude, this so isn't worth the extra credit.

627
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:43,945
Sheriff, I had no idea
this was going to happen.

628
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:47,752
But if I can catch her, I can destroy her.

629
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:55,829
Oh, Dr. Abramson.

630
00:45:59,537 --> 00:46:00,868
Lou!

631
00:46:06,477 --> 00:46:09,446
Lou?

632
00:46:09,513 --> 00:46:11,743
Where are you hiding,

633
00:46:11,816 --> 00:46:15,775
you fat, chicken-eating bastard?

634
00:46:15,853 --> 00:46:18,617
Well, somebody's been here.

635
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:23,325
Hey, let's see what's for dinner.

636
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:36,066
Lou.

637
00:46:48,919 --> 00:46:51,114
If that's dinner,

638
00:46:51,188 --> 00:46:53,679
maybe we should have
stayed in the joint.

639
00:46:53,757 --> 00:46:55,622
Tonight was meatloaf and gravy.

640
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:58,958
Eddie, don't be a jerk.

641
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:00,553
Eel's a delicacy.

642
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:03,327
The Greeks eat that crap
for their Christmas dinner.

643
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,166
Yeah, I'll stick with turkey and trimmings,
if you don't mind.

644
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:18,278
So where's this cousin of yours?

645
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:22,410
Well, my guess is

646
00:47:22,486 --> 00:47:24,044
he's out picking dingleberries

647
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:25,952
to bake us a dingleberry pie.

648
00:47:26,023 --> 00:47:28,958
How the hell am I supposed
to know where he is?

649
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:30,152
Take a seat,

650
00:47:30,227 --> 00:47:34,220
'cause we are not going anywhere.

651
00:47:34,298 --> 00:47:36,163
Sit down.

652
00:47:38,169 --> 00:47:39,796
I'll find him.

653
00:47:44,775 --> 00:47:46,766
Sal, I'm hungry.

654
00:47:55,953 --> 00:47:58,820
This is where the scouts
left yesterday.

655
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:00,584
This is where
the canoes were found.

656
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:01,818
I've marked with an X

657
00:48:01,892 --> 00:48:05,328
the places of potential eel attacks.

658
00:48:05,396 --> 00:48:07,762
Diner, trailer park,
Mel Gordon's place.

659
00:48:07,831 --> 00:48:10,994
This modulator controls
a small electrical current

660
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:13,036
that will draw the eel towards us.

661
00:48:13,103 --> 00:48:14,832
When she gets close enough,

662
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:18,238
we'll track her using this device.

663
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:20,573
Now, the signal isn't very strong,

664
00:48:20,644 --> 00:48:25,047
so she'll be right on top of someone
before you know it.

665
00:48:25,115 --> 00:48:27,743
And when she's close?

666
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:31,219
I've packed enough cyanide
in this crossbow bolt

667
00:48:31,288 --> 00:48:33,279
to drop an elephant.

668
00:48:33,357 --> 00:48:35,120
One shot and it's
calamari for everyone.

669
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:38,423
Calamari is squid, you idiot.

670
00:48:38,495 --> 00:48:40,827
Now, the eels will generally
stick close to their dens,

671
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:42,957
provided there's an ample food supply.

672
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:45,627
Any sign of this thing,
anything abnormal,

673
00:48:45,703 --> 00:48:47,568
give me a holler and I'll get there.

674
00:48:47,638 --> 00:48:49,003
What about a unicorn?

675
00:48:49,073 --> 00:48:51,166
Should we give you a call
if we see one of those?

676
00:48:51,242 --> 00:48:53,039
Can it, Lott.

677
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:54,577
Listen, Sheriff.

678
00:48:54,645 --> 00:48:56,408
There's no way in hell
I'm walking in that water

679
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,938
if this wacko's firin' off
one of those battery charges.

680
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:01,279
We're searching for convicts.

681
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:03,718
If there's a big bad eel out there,

682
00:49:03,787 --> 00:49:05,277
I'll take care of it.

683
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:07,415
How you plan to do that?

684
00:49:07,491 --> 00:49:09,322
The old-fashioned way.

685
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:12,317
Watch out!

686
00:49:12,396 --> 00:49:14,296
- Look out.
- Cool.

687
00:49:14,365 --> 00:49:15,559
That's just great, Lott.

688
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:17,066
How much you know about eels?

689
00:49:17,134 --> 00:49:18,499
I know enough to kill 'em.

690
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:20,196
It's not that simple.

691
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:22,296
They're quiet, and they're hard to find.

692
00:49:22,373 --> 00:49:24,136
And if they're under
the water out there,

693
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:26,142
you won't see them
and you won't hear them.

694
00:49:27,544 --> 00:49:30,035
Delmar, you're scaring me.

695
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:33,106
If I might interject, Delmar's correct.

696
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,151
You can be right on top of one

697
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:38,655
and not know it
until the creature pulls you under.

698
00:49:38,722 --> 00:49:39,814
All right, Doc.

699
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:43,018
If I say I can handle it,
I can handle it.

700
00:49:44,495 --> 00:49:45,462
All right.

701
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:47,224
My team will search the nest area.

702
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:49,289
Deputy, take yours up north
to Kerchner Crossing.

703
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:51,664
Everybody else,
follow the river along south

704
00:49:51,735 --> 00:49:52,929
down to Elliot's Station.

705
00:49:53,003 --> 00:49:55,471
Right, the only question remaining is

706
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:58,167
who's going to carry
the tracking devices?

707
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:02,335
No way.

708
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:03,345
I'll take it.

709
00:50:03,414 --> 00:50:05,609
I think I should...

710
00:50:05,683 --> 00:50:07,241
I should probably take that.

711
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:08,910
Agreed.

712
00:50:08,986 --> 00:50:11,216
All right. Any more questions?

713
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:12,482
Yeah, I have one more...

714
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:14,990
Great. Let's move out.

715
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:17,152
All right, guys. Let's go.

716
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:20,190
- Yeah!
- It's on!

717
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,905
Keep your eyes peeled.

718
00:50:31,975 --> 00:50:33,966
She could be anywhere.

719
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:42,344
How come I didn't get a gun?

720
00:50:42,419 --> 00:50:44,011
Shut up, retard.

721
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:45,112
Follow me.

722
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:47,823
Don't piss me off, kid.

723
00:51:10,814 --> 00:51:13,112
Not funny.

724
00:51:34,138 --> 00:51:36,038
Any sign of it?

725
00:51:36,106 --> 00:51:37,073
Not yet.

726
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:39,439
I suggest we change positions.

727
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:42,639
Here. Catch.

728
00:51:55,025 --> 00:51:56,652
Doc?

729
00:51:56,727 --> 00:52:00,754
You said this eel was 6 feet
at two months, right?

730
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:02,594
Well, it's four months old now.

731
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:04,793
Wouldn't that mean it's,
like, 12 feet or more?

732
00:52:06,537 --> 00:52:08,596
Could be, yes.

733
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:10,071
That's an awful lot of fish.

734
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,631
You think there's enough
cyanide in that thing to stop it?

735
00:52:12,709 --> 00:52:13,767
Well, there'd better be.

736
00:52:13,844 --> 00:52:15,903
Otherwise, we're in
an awful lot of trouble.

737
00:52:15,979 --> 00:52:19,107
This thing could live
for a few hours after we hit it.

738
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:22,380
Did you get a chance to study
the eel's metabolism in the lab?

739
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:25,911
No. Apart from the specific
mutation we made to the gene,

740
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:27,149
we didn't look at it.

741
00:52:27,224 --> 00:52:29,920
What specific mutation?

742
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:34,496
It can't metabolize sugar.

743
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:35,862
Sugar?

744
00:52:35,933 --> 00:52:38,925
Yes, well, the orange growers
in this particular area

745
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:40,469
are a powerful lobby,

746
00:52:40,537 --> 00:52:42,505
and they were afraid
that the eels would devour

747
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:44,006
the nearby orange groves.

748
00:52:45,943 --> 00:52:47,467
Anyway, shall we?

749
00:52:57,454 --> 00:52:59,581
Lou, you taking a dump?

750
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,990
He ain't got anything to eat in this place.

751
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:07,826
You eat what you catch here.

752
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:10,264
- That's the rule.
- Sal, I'm hungry.

753
00:53:10,334 --> 00:53:11,733
And I just sprung you from jail.

754
00:53:11,802 --> 00:53:13,497
Now keep quiet, okay?

755
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:14,628
I'll be quiet.

756
00:53:14,705 --> 00:53:17,230
Hungry and quiet.

757
00:53:19,176 --> 00:53:21,110
What in the hell?

758
00:53:22,446 --> 00:53:25,210
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

759
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:29,408
I bet them kids got plenty of food.

760
00:53:31,054 --> 00:53:33,284
Yeah.

761
00:53:33,357 --> 00:53:35,291
Let's go visit the camp a little bit later.

762
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,883
Come on.

763
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,894
Maybe they went this way.

764
00:53:38,962 --> 00:53:41,328
Come on, guys. We have to find them.

765
00:53:41,398 --> 00:53:42,956
You heard what Lott said.

766
00:53:43,033 --> 00:53:46,059
He's gonna roast me
like a marshmallow.

767
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10,085
Real charmer, isn't he?

768
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,923
Yeah, sweet as vinegar.

769
00:54:35,953 --> 00:54:37,352
Anybody got any chaw?

770
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:38,945
I got some jerky.

771
00:54:39,022 --> 00:54:41,684
I got some turkey jerky.

772
00:54:43,694 --> 00:54:44,854
Hey, Chubby.

773
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:47,795
You know, you really need
those complex amino acids

774
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:49,855
to keep your blood sugar up

775
00:54:49,933 --> 00:54:53,164
because breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

776
00:54:53,236 --> 00:54:54,498
Come on, Pete.

777
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:57,039
Don't lag so far back.

778
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:15,653
Come on, Pete.

779
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,090
Pete?

780
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:41,209
Pete?

781
00:55:41,284 --> 00:55:43,878
Aw, no, Blinky, run!

782
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:48,591
Go faster!

783
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:50,650
Don't look back!
Don't look back!

784
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:53,389
Come on, Blinky!

785
00:55:53,463 --> 00:55:55,226
Go. Go, go, go, go, go!

786
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:57,630
Come on!

787
00:55:59,136 --> 00:56:00,125
Run, Blinky, run!

788
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,937
Come on, Blinky!

789
00:56:05,008 --> 00:56:06,805
Keep running!

790
00:56:06,877 --> 00:56:09,505
Don't look back!

791
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:15,181
Run, Blinky!

792
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:03,595
They're having cheerleader
tryouts next week.

793
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:04,793
I'm gonna be sick.

794
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:06,267
So, Holly, how does it feel

795
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:09,635
to ride on the varsity bus
for a while instead of Jay-Vee?

796
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:10,866
Excuse me?

797
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:13,136
Well, I was just saying it must be nice

798
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:16,441
to shake yourself
of Jay the Super Brain for a change.

799
00:57:16,513 --> 00:57:17,946
I'm not interested in Jay.

800
00:57:18,014 --> 00:57:19,413
We're just friends.

801
00:57:19,483 --> 00:57:21,883
I think what the moron's
trying to say is it's nice

802
00:57:21,952 --> 00:57:24,079
you're hanging with us for a change.

803
00:57:24,154 --> 00:57:27,885
So is that supposed
to be a compliment?

804
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,482
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

805
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:31,424
Well, thank you.

806
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:36,888
So, Holly, you don't really
hate football, do you?

807
00:57:36,967 --> 00:57:39,026
I mean, that's just a joke, right?

808
00:57:41,671 --> 00:57:42,933
No.

809
00:57:43,006 --> 00:57:44,633
I really do hate football.

810
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:46,369
How about you guys?

811
00:57:46,443 --> 00:57:51,005
You don't really hate reading books
and expanding your mind, do you?

812
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:52,070
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

813
00:57:52,149 --> 00:57:54,276
I think reading pretty much sucks.

814
00:57:54,351 --> 00:58:00,950
But then again, I've never had somebody
to talk to about books or foreign films

815
00:58:01,024 --> 00:58:04,289
or anything mind-expanding like that.

816
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:06,886
Well...

817
00:58:06,963 --> 00:58:09,329
you could always...

818
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:15,665
talk to Jay.

819
00:58:21,077 --> 00:58:23,170
Dude, she played you so good.

820
00:58:23,246 --> 00:58:24,338
- That was sweet.
- Yeah.

821
00:58:24,414 --> 00:58:26,006
Mark, take a walk.

822
00:58:27,017 --> 00:58:29,508
Holly, wait up.

823
00:58:29,586 --> 00:58:32,020
Oh. I see how it is.

824
00:58:32,088 --> 00:58:33,646
You guys go have fun.

825
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:35,350
I'm just gonna...

826
00:58:35,425 --> 00:58:37,893
Don't give me another thought.

827
00:58:57,113 --> 00:58:59,741
Guys!

828
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:00,976
Guys! Sheriff!

829
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:03,144
Sheriff, come over here!

830
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,085
Guys, come over here!

831
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:16,629
Oh, my gosh.

832
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,792
It's the Canoe Club.

833
00:59:17,868 --> 00:59:20,029
The camp's been torn to pieces.

834
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,735
That's got to be the eel.

835
00:59:27,978 --> 00:59:29,468
Hey, Sheriff.

836
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:32,913
You think that eel wears
a prison-issued work boot?

837
00:59:32,983 --> 00:59:34,883
Do you?

838
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:37,078
A boot doesn't prove anything, Lott.

839
00:59:37,153 --> 00:59:40,714
Proves those sons of bitches
are out there with my boy.

840
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:43,554
We've got plenty of tracks to follow.

841
00:59:45,729 --> 00:59:47,162
Yeah, it looks like they head west.

842
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:07,542
Doc, you better bring the boat.

843
01:00:07,617 --> 01:00:09,710
Dude, don't you ever leave me.

844
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:11,549
See what happens?

845
01:00:39,482 --> 01:00:40,176
All right, everyone.

846
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:42,884
Let's spread out.

847
01:00:42,953 --> 01:00:44,887
20-yard intervals.

848
01:00:45,889 --> 01:00:47,447
All right.

849
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:50,357
You heard her, men. Let's go!

850
01:00:52,395 --> 01:00:53,828
Give me that. Thanks, bro.

851
01:00:53,897 --> 01:00:55,228
Bye, Holly.

852
01:00:57,901 --> 01:01:02,668
I'll be nearby if you need me,
so just holler, okay?

853
01:01:29,799 --> 01:01:32,597
Alone at last.

854
01:01:32,669 --> 01:01:34,398
What's that supposed to mean?

855
01:01:34,471 --> 01:01:37,201
Nothing. So which one am I,
Dumb or Dumber?

856
01:01:37,273 --> 01:01:39,707
Please tell me Mark is Dumber.

857
01:01:39,776 --> 01:01:41,334
Yeah, you're just Dumb.

858
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:46,574
You think about it?

859
01:01:48,284 --> 01:01:50,184
Yeah, I think about it.

860
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:51,550
With me or just in general?

861
01:01:51,621 --> 01:01:52,952
I told you I think about it!

862
01:02:01,831 --> 01:02:06,029
I think, according to some researchers,

863
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:07,865
opposites attract in about 75% of...

864
01:02:07,937 --> 01:02:09,495
Shut up.

865
01:02:31,628 --> 01:02:33,425
What was that?

866
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:35,726
What was it?

867
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,198
Oh, my God!

868
01:02:39,269 --> 01:02:41,066
Oh, make it go away!

869
01:02:41,137 --> 01:02:42,365
Please.

870
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:47,937
Hey! Hey, guys!

871
01:02:52,315 --> 01:02:55,182
What the hell is going on here?

872
01:02:56,252 --> 01:02:57,742
Jay, don't. It's here.

873
01:02:57,821 --> 01:02:59,482
Where?

874
01:03:01,124 --> 01:03:03,149
In the water!

875
01:03:03,226 --> 01:03:04,853
It's here?

876
01:03:04,928 --> 01:03:06,793
It's here?

877
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:10,963
Holly?

878
01:03:17,073 --> 01:03:19,473
Holly...

879
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:34,852
Where is she?

880
01:03:34,924 --> 01:03:36,414
Look at it.

881
01:03:38,228 --> 01:03:41,493
Damn. Did you see that thing?
15 feet, easy.

882
01:03:41,564 --> 01:03:44,658
We hit it. It's like it didn't even faze it.

883
01:03:44,734 --> 01:03:46,793
Unless you hit it in the head,

884
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:49,498
these little guns are
not going to help at all.

885
01:03:49,572 --> 01:03:51,335
What happened?

886
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:52,999
Jay's gone.

887
01:03:54,344 --> 01:03:55,538
Damn it.

888
01:03:58,848 --> 01:04:01,578
- You guys, bring the boat around.
- Let's go!

889
01:04:01,651 --> 01:04:03,118
Shots came from over there.

890
01:04:03,186 --> 01:04:04,881
Let's move it!

891
01:04:06,189 --> 01:04:08,817
I don't know how you stayed alive, kid!

892
01:04:08,892 --> 01:04:10,621
We're the only ones left!

893
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:11,955
You and me!

894
01:04:12,028 --> 01:04:13,256
Run!

895
01:04:16,132 --> 01:04:17,793
Run!

896
01:04:17,867 --> 01:04:20,836
Run, kid!

897
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:39,187
Come on, kid. Run!

898
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:46,549
Who is it?

899
01:05:46,623 --> 01:05:48,386
Think you mean, who was it?

900
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:50,551
Eddie Mason.

901
01:05:50,627 --> 01:05:53,061
One of the escaped convicts.

902
01:05:53,129 --> 01:05:55,461
Or what's left of him.

903
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:58,125
She is really close.

904
01:05:58,201 --> 01:06:00,135
This way, everybody.

905
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:16,604
Everett, honey.

906
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:18,943
Do you think you can
tell us what happened?

907
01:07:19,015 --> 01:07:21,575
I mean, where are the other kids?

908
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:26,916
Sweetheart,

909
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:29,184
I know you're scared, and that's okay.

910
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:30,850
But we need to find the others.

911
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:32,519
Do you think you can tell us

912
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:35,325
what happened and where they are?

913
01:07:35,398 --> 01:07:37,127
Listen, you little retard,

914
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,168
you tell me where my son is
before I knock your head off!

915
01:07:39,235 --> 01:07:40,759
Lott, I am handling this.

916
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:42,737
You're doing a bang-up job, Sheriff.

917
01:07:42,805 --> 01:07:44,568
Look at all the useful information
you got out of him.

918
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,369
Nothing! Dumb bitch.

919
01:07:46,442 --> 01:07:48,376
Back off, Lott.

920
01:07:48,444 --> 01:07:50,776
Go to hell, you little dogcatcher.

921
01:07:50,847 --> 01:07:51,836
Come here, boy!

922
01:07:51,914 --> 01:07:54,144
- I want to know!
- I said back off!

923
01:07:54,217 --> 01:07:56,208
You're not in charge here.

924
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:59,743
If we're going to survive this thing
and find your son,

925
01:07:59,822 --> 01:08:01,380
we need to work together, you got it?

926
01:08:01,457 --> 01:08:02,446
You got it?

927
01:08:02,525 --> 01:08:04,322
Okay. Okay.

928
01:08:04,394 --> 01:08:05,452
Let go.

929
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:18,771
It's okay. You don't have to talk.

930
01:08:18,841 --> 01:08:20,138
It's okay.

931
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:23,406
Maybe you could just show us.

932
01:08:39,128 --> 01:08:40,459
Let's take a closer look.

933
01:08:42,131 --> 01:08:44,224
Doc, you and the kids hang back.

934
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,460
Let's go.

935
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:09,650
Lott, don't go in there.

936
01:09:09,725 --> 01:09:11,784
No, don't.

937
01:09:11,861 --> 01:09:12,885
- What?
- Don't.

938
01:09:12,962 --> 01:09:14,759
It's my boy?

939
01:09:14,831 --> 01:09:15,923
It's my boy?

940
01:09:15,998 --> 01:09:17,989
Get out of my way.

941
01:10:05,548 --> 01:10:07,015
Take a good look, Doc.

942
01:10:09,452 --> 01:10:11,545
How you gonna make this one right?

943
01:10:28,804 --> 01:10:30,237
How'd it get in?

944
01:10:31,974 --> 01:10:33,999
Where are the bodies?

945
01:10:56,299 --> 01:10:58,267
You're telling me it chewed its way in?

946
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,617
I guess we found the bodies.

947
01:12:02,398 --> 01:12:04,389
Everett, are you okay?

948
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:11,001
The search is over. We have to go back.

949
01:12:12,575 --> 01:12:15,305
I need to get the coroner's unit out here.

950
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:35,291
Lott, I'm sorry.

951
01:12:35,364 --> 01:12:36,854
Me, too.

952
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:41,069
The search ain't over.

953
01:12:41,137 --> 01:12:44,698
We might have found them kids,

954
01:12:44,774 --> 01:12:46,207
but we haven't found that beast.

955
01:12:59,021 --> 01:13:01,114
Everett, what's wrong?

956
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,565
What is it, kid?

957
01:13:12,635 --> 01:13:14,398
Everett, what's wrong?

958
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:19,565
Dude, you're freaking me out.

959
01:13:24,213 --> 01:13:26,147
Gonna kill ourselves an eel.

960
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:28,546
Hey...

961
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:31,017
there's something wrong
with that stuttering dude.

962
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:44,156
Son of a bitch.

963
01:13:45,534 --> 01:13:46,558
Everett, wait here.

964
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:47,795
What happened?

965
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:51,404
Mark!

966
01:13:51,474 --> 01:13:53,408
Mark!

967
01:13:53,476 --> 01:13:55,376
You get the kids inside now.

968
01:13:55,444 --> 01:13:56,911
Now!

969
01:13:58,514 --> 01:14:00,607
Come on, let's go.

970
01:14:05,187 --> 01:14:06,711
Start the generator, Doc.

971
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:16,422
Get ready.

972
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:21,230
This'll bring her in closer to us.

973
01:14:21,303 --> 01:14:22,565
Perfect.

974
01:14:33,816 --> 01:14:36,182
It's circling us.

975
01:14:36,252 --> 01:14:37,719
Where?

976
01:14:39,088 --> 01:14:41,556
She's studying us.

977
01:14:45,327 --> 01:14:46,521
She's very close now,

978
01:14:46,595 --> 01:14:49,325
and in for quite a shock, I might add.

979
01:14:53,502 --> 01:14:54,469
There it is.

980
01:14:54,537 --> 01:14:56,129
Coming your way, Doc!

981
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:57,968
Doc! Doc!

982
01:14:59,241 --> 01:15:00,572
Shoot it, Doc!

983
01:15:00,643 --> 01:15:01,871
Shoot it!

984
01:15:08,751 --> 01:15:10,480
I can hack it.

985
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:20,118
Doc!

986
01:15:20,196 --> 01:15:21,356
Doc.

987
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:23,489
Give me your hand.

988
01:15:23,566 --> 01:15:24,828
Stay out of the water!

989
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,094
No!

990
01:15:26,168 --> 01:15:27,658
No, Doc!

991
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,020
Is it dead?

992
01:15:54,296 --> 01:15:55,923
Doc?

993
01:15:57,132 --> 01:15:58,463
Wow.

994
01:16:00,236 --> 01:16:03,069
Dr. Abramson killed it, right?

995
01:16:03,138 --> 01:16:05,072
Yeah.

996
01:16:06,575 --> 01:16:09,339
So he's a hero.

997
01:16:13,482 --> 01:16:14,915
It's gone.

998
01:16:14,984 --> 01:16:16,781
What do you mean, it's gone?

999
01:16:16,852 --> 01:16:19,412
Let's go
before it decides to come back.

1000
01:16:21,824 --> 01:16:23,917
Get the kid. We're out of here.

1001
01:16:23,993 --> 01:16:25,961
Delmar, what are we going to do?

1002
01:16:26,028 --> 01:16:28,019
I told you, we're leaving.

1003
01:16:29,465 --> 01:16:30,796
Delmar.

1004
01:16:33,869 --> 01:16:35,029
We'll never make it.

1005
01:16:35,104 --> 01:16:37,095
The guns are ineffective
without the cyanide.

1006
01:16:37,172 --> 01:16:38,503
We'll never make it.

1007
01:16:38,574 --> 01:16:40,007
What do you want me to do, Ruth?

1008
01:16:40,075 --> 01:16:42,942
Well, that thing is an animal,

1009
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:44,775
and that's your area of expertise.

1010
01:16:44,847 --> 01:16:46,781
There's got to be something.

1011
01:16:48,651 --> 01:16:49,948
Hey, guys!

1012
01:16:50,019 --> 01:16:52,180
There's something
wrong with the kid!

1013
01:16:53,756 --> 01:16:54,984
This is a medical ID.

1014
01:16:55,057 --> 01:16:58,458
Look. He's diabetic.
He's going into shock.

1015
01:16:58,527 --> 01:17:01,121
Check his pockets for insulin.

1016
01:17:01,196 --> 01:17:02,720
Here we go.

1017
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:06,166
Hold on.

1018
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:10,699
Come on, kid.

1019
01:17:16,645 --> 01:17:19,443
Oh, my God. That's it.

1020
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:21,107
That's the reason the eel didn't kill him.

1021
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:22,309
He's diabetic.

1022
01:17:22,384 --> 01:17:24,409
What are you talking about?

1023
01:17:24,486 --> 01:17:27,319
Soren said that the eel
can't digest sugar.

1024
01:17:27,389 --> 01:17:29,584
So it's essentially a Type II diabetic.

1025
01:17:29,658 --> 01:17:32,183
If Everett's blood sugar
level was too high,

1026
01:17:32,261 --> 01:17:34,627
the eel would have been
repulsed by the sweetness.

1027
01:17:34,697 --> 01:17:37,131
That's why he didn't finish the job.

1028
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,531
We need sugar, a lot of it,

1029
01:17:39,601 --> 01:17:41,125
and very concentrated.

1030
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:43,103
Sugar? I got sugar.

1031
01:17:43,172 --> 01:17:45,640
Mark's glucose pills.

1032
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:49,041
Ruth, prep one
of those syringes, empty it out.

1033
01:17:49,111 --> 01:17:50,578
Get something to boil some water.

1034
01:17:50,646 --> 01:17:52,341
We need to liquefy the glucose.

1035
01:17:52,414 --> 01:17:55,076
Do you really think
this is going to work?

1036
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:56,811
It just might.

1037
01:18:08,364 --> 01:18:09,729
Here you go.

1038
01:18:13,769 --> 01:18:15,862
You only got one shot
with this, you know.

1039
01:18:15,938 --> 01:18:17,599
Yeah, I know.

1040
01:18:19,608 --> 01:18:21,872
All right, you guys,

1041
01:18:21,944 --> 01:18:23,468
take Everett and head east.

1042
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:26,207
Do not stop till you
get to base camp,

1043
01:18:26,281 --> 01:18:27,680
no matter what.

1044
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:29,411
Okay, run. Go.

1045
01:18:29,485 --> 01:18:31,043
Good luck, you guys.

1046
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,611
You're short on daylight.
You'd better hurry.

1047
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:36,288
Keep going!

1048
01:18:43,298 --> 01:18:45,823
You ready to do this?

1049
01:18:45,901 --> 01:18:48,062
You?

1050
01:18:48,137 --> 01:18:49,900
It's animal control.

1051
01:18:49,972 --> 01:18:52,202
It's what I do.

1052
01:18:52,274 --> 01:18:53,935
Let's roll.

1053
01:19:10,192 --> 01:19:12,319
Come and get it!

1054
01:19:12,394 --> 01:19:14,089
Tasty human here.

1055
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:17,223
If you can catch me, you can eat me.

1056
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:18,766
Come on!

1057
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,729
Where are you?

1058
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:43,348
Come and get it, you dumb eel.

1059
01:19:44,393 --> 01:19:45,724
Come on!

1060
01:19:50,532 --> 01:19:51,464
Come on, you dumb eel!

1061
01:19:51,533 --> 01:19:53,433
Come and get me!

1062
01:20:10,586 --> 01:20:11,575
Come on!

1063
01:20:14,289 --> 01:20:16,553
Come and get it! Come on!

1064
01:20:20,028 --> 01:20:21,620
Come get me now!

1065
01:20:33,876 --> 01:20:35,810
Get ready!

1066
01:20:39,848 --> 01:20:41,008
Now!

1067
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:42,710
Hey!

1068
01:21:02,004 --> 01:21:04,234
The Doc's poison,

1069
01:21:04,306 --> 01:21:05,466
it worked.

1070
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:06,838
It worked, Ruth.

1071
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:09,002
I think it's dead.

1072
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:11,341
Come on down.

1073
01:21:16,118 --> 01:21:17,312
You okay?

1074
01:21:17,386 --> 01:21:18,876
I'm fine.

1075
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:49,583
Yeah.

1076
01:21:50,986 --> 01:21:52,180
Nice shot, Sheriff.

1077
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:53,551
Thank you.

1078
01:21:53,622 --> 01:21:56,250
That is one shot I will take credit for.

1079
01:21:57,993 --> 01:21:59,255
What the...

1080
01:22:03,065 --> 01:22:04,498
Unbelievable.

1081
01:22:04,566 --> 01:22:07,501
We're running out of options here.

1082
01:22:08,503 --> 01:22:10,494
Any more ideas?

1083
01:22:16,245 --> 01:22:17,803
Lott.

1084
01:22:17,879 --> 01:22:19,403
He's dead.

1085
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:24,647
Yeah, but he's always prepared.

1086
01:22:35,964 --> 01:22:38,023
Lott, you son of a bitch.

1087
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,534
I love you.

1088
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,670
In case I don't make it.

1089
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:51,074
You're gonna make it.

1090
01:22:56,618 --> 01:22:58,609
Be careful.

1091
01:23:01,223 --> 01:23:02,815
Daddy's home!

1092
01:23:02,891 --> 01:23:04,688
And he's got a present for you!

1093
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,625
I'll cover you.

1094
01:23:09,231 --> 01:23:12,257
Chew on this, you big bitch!

1095
01:23:12,334 --> 01:23:14,859
Watch behind you.

1096
01:23:16,838 --> 01:23:19,204
Come on!

1097
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:21,936
Come on!

1098
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:24,478
Come on!

1099
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:26,377
Come on!

1100
01:23:26,448 --> 01:23:28,973
Come on!

1101
01:23:32,754 --> 01:23:34,813
I'm hungry,

1102
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:37,484
and I feel like unagi tonight.

1103
01:23:45,067 --> 01:23:46,398
Come on!

1104
01:24:19,334 --> 01:24:21,097
That's it.

1105
01:24:21,169 --> 01:24:23,137
Come to Papa.

1106
01:24:27,642 --> 01:24:28,768
Not yet.

1107
01:24:54,169 --> 01:24:55,431
Delmar!

1108
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:09,807
Do it!

1109
01:25:13,688 --> 01:25:15,019
Kill it!

1110
01:25:16,191 --> 01:25:17,681
Delmar!

1111
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:49,783
Come on, we've got
about nine seconds.

1112
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:00,260
- Sit down.
- What...

1113
01:26:00,335 --> 01:26:01,927
Sit down.

1114
01:26:51,953 --> 01:26:54,319
I think we got it this time?

1115
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:02,458
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

1116
01:27:02,531 --> 01:27:03,725
Me, too.

1117
01:27:03,798 --> 01:27:05,629
What are you in the mood for?

1118
01:27:07,335 --> 01:27:09,496
Anything but seafood.

1119
01:27:12,474 --> 01:27:14,738
I've been meaning to ask you something.

1120
01:27:14,809 --> 01:27:17,073
Well, you first.

1121
01:27:18,313 --> 01:27:20,474
A blowfish?

1122
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:28,392
