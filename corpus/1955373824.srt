1
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,440
<i> This was one</i>
<i> of the deadliest times</i>

2
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,940
to be on the battlefield
in Afghanistan.

3
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,350
<i> We were going into an area</i>

4
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,950
<i> that was nothing</i>
<i> but insurgents,</i>

5
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,680
so that we can
draw these guys out to fight.

6
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,420
<i> Something detonating</i>

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,320
<i> very often means the loss</i>
<i> of somebody's life.</i>

8
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,490
<i> The last thing</i>
<i> that I ever did</i>

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,090
<i> on the battlefield</i>

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,860
<i> was to put myself</i>
<i> in between these guys</i>

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,330
that I call my brothers
and impossible death.

12
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,180
<i> This is tracking</i>
<i> to be a very violent month</i>

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,540
<i> here in Afghanistan.</i>

14
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,350
<i> Across the country,</i>

15
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,450
<i> these last few months</i>
<i> have been</i>

16
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,150
<i> the deadliest of the war.</i>

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,950
<i> 4,900 mortars, rockets, IEDs,</i>

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,860
<i> a 7% increase</i>
<i> over the month before.</i>

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,160
<i> The surge of troops</i>
<i> are in country,</i>

20
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,790
<i> going through every single</i>
<i> compound in an area</i>

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,330
<i> that they have</i>
<i> never been in before.</i>

22
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,070
<i> The biggest threats</i>
<i> are the IEDs.</i>

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,200
They're targeting us
dismounted

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,670
walking through the fields.

25
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,340
<i> In the summer of 2010,</i>

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,670
<i> it was</i>
<i> an incredibly intense period</i>

27
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,710
<i> of being at war</i>
<i> in Afghanistan.</i>

28
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,980
We had so many targets
to go after

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,150
and so many casualties
across the board,

30
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,750
his was just
one of the deadliest times

31
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,190
to be on the battlefield.

32
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,050
The country
was a little out of control

33
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,090
in the areas
we were working in.

34
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,920
You know, casualty rates
started going up,

35
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,630
firefights
started getting longer,

36
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,360
helicopters were being shot at
or shot down.

37
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,840
<i> Team Merrill is a task force</i>
<i> that was created</i>

38
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,880
to gather intelligence
for the conventional military

39
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,210
by entering areas
that coalition forces

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,680
had not been in,
in a recent time.

41
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,020
<i> We were able to give</i>
<i> good intelligence</i>

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,130
<i> by being up front,</i>
<i> for lack of a better word,</i>
<i> behind enemy lines.</i>

43
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,860
We didn't have
specific people, usually,

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,030
that we were going after.

45
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,430
We would have a specific area
that is a hotspot, you know,

46
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,970
and we would target that area
because we knew

47
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,570
that there was a lot
of enemy activity there.

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,540
We were all,
all over the country,

49
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,610
so different terrain
and different compounds,

50
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,050
different people, so, like,

51
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,580
anything can go on
at any time.

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,750
<i> It's often nothing</i>

53
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,320
<i> but military-aged</i>
<i> male fighters,</i>

54
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,120
<i> you know,</i>
<i> no women, no children,</i>

55
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,590
<i> so you know</i>
<i> those are all people</i>

56
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,160
<i> that are there to be</i>
<i> in the fight,</i>

57
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,630
and we are gonna go
in the middle of them,

58
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,400
and we're going to hoist up
an American flag,

59
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,770
<i> and we're gonna stir up</i>

60
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,270
<i> this beehive</i>
<i> as much as we can</i>

61
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,740
so that we can
draw these guys out to fight.

62
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,910
We were essentially just
the worm on the end of a hook,

63
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,680
<i> but it was a great way</i>
<i> to spark things up.</i>

64
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,350
That's kind of
every Ranger's dream,

65
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,350
to go get in a fight.

66
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,780
That's what you sign up for.

67
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,750
That's what I signed up for.

68
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,660
Hey, take this corner.

69
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,130
<i> When you have</i>
<i> a enemy fighter,</i>

70
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,330
<i> and you know about</i>
<i> where he's at,</i>

71
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,000
<i> and you know about</i>
<i> what he looks like,</i>

72
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,700
<i> and you know what</i>
<i> he's shooting at you with,</i>

73
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,300
<i> you know, that's,</i>
<i> that's a, that's a problem,</i>

74
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,170
<i> but it's a problem</i>
<i> you can deal with.</i>

75
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,810
But when you have these,
these IEDs that are hidden
in all sorts of places

76
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,280
where they think
that you're gonna walk,

77
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,640
and you have no,
no way to detect them,

78
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,210
<i> sometimes it's, that's,</i>
<i> that's a scary thought.</i>

79
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,780
<i> Get up! Get up!</i>

80
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,850
<i> Get up!</i>

81
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,320
The term IED simply means
Improvised Explosive Device,

82
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,790
<i> and that was</i>
<i> the largest killer</i>

83
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,530
<i> on our battlefield</i>
<i> at that time.</i>

84
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,230
This is nothing
but insurgents

85
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,530
taking what they can find
or they can buy

86
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,970
<i> and manufacturing</i>
<i> a homemade explosive,</i>

87
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,370
<i> and then</i>
<i> manufacturing a system</i>

88
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,380
<i> to detonate that device</i>
<i> on the battlefield somewhere.</i>

89
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,980
As we became more advanced
and became better troops,

90
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,350
they got better
at what they did.

91
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,590
<i> IED! IED!</i>

92
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,490
We were having to combat,
you know, vehicle-borne IEDs

93
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,030
<i> and IEDs buried in the road</i>
<i> and IEDs attached to trees</i>

94
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,990
<i> and IEDs attached</i>
<i> to trip wires</i>

95
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,600
<i> and IEDs attached</i>
<i> to pressure plates.</i>

96
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,880
<i> As a bomb technician,</i>
<i> you are at the tip</i>
<i> of the spear,</i>

97
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,020
<i> and that's</i>
<i> a very dangerous place to be.</i>

98
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,620
You're likely gonna be
the first one

99
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,690
to run into an Improvised
Explosive Device,

100
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,790
<i> or if there is a tripwire,</i>

101
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,890
you're the one
that's gonna run

102
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,130
<i> into that tripwire.</i>

103
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,230
<i> You're taking the hazard</i>

104
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,460
<i> that everybody else</i>
<i> wants to move away from,</i>

105
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,970
and you are the person
that has to move very calmly

106
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:23,940
and very purposefully
towards that hazard.

107
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,650
It wasn't me using my rifle
to look for enemy combatants.

108
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,950
<i> It was me using the tools</i>
<i> that I had</i>

109
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,750
<i> to look off to the left</i>
<i> and off to the right</i>

110
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,750
<i> to make sure there were not</i>
<i> any explosive hazards</i>

111
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,150
<i> that were buried off</i>
<i> in the bush.</i>

112
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,330
EOB techs have a special job,
obviously.

113
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,790
<i> Their job is to keep people</i>

114
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,000
alive
and to keep people safe.

115
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,230
<i> You're having to learn</i>

116
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,270
<i> a lot of things</i>
<i> about physics,</i>

117
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,170
<i> or the chemistry</i>
<i> that's associated</i>
<i> with explosives,</i>

118
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,070
but you also have to be
a person that is,

119
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,080
say, capable of opening up
the hood of a car

120
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,580
and working on an engine,
and then on top of that,

121
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,610
you have to have a person
that has the stones

122
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,480
to go stand on top of a bomb

123
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,520
<i> and say,</i>
<i> "I'm gonna disarm this."</i>

124
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,960
<i> It wasn't too long ago,</i>
<i> my old high school</i>

125
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,460
<i> reached out to me to go</i>
<i> to a speaking engagement.</i>

126
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,370
The principal,
he was introducing me,

127
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,970
telling the story of,
you know,

128
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,370
"I pulled your file, Brian.

129
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,540
The very first thing
on the top of that page,

130
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,210
the very first incident
you ever did

131
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,640
when you were a freshman
here in high school

132
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,610
is you let
a few stink bombs off.

133
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,340
I think we could've predicted
back then

134
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,380
that you might have a future
in, in blowing things up."

135
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,520
So, and I guess I did.

136
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,660
<i> I was raised</i>
<i> in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</i>

137
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,320
<i> It's like</i>
<i> a great blue-collar area.</i>

138
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,230
It's just close enough
to a city,

139
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,230
but I was in the suburbs.

140
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,230
<i> You know,</i>
<i> I grew up watching GI Joe,</i>

141
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,300
<i> and I grew up rolling</i>
<i> and playing in the mud</i>

142
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,230
<i> and playing with guns</i>
<i> and being a kid</i>

143
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,200
<i> that was out there hunting.</i>

144
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,140
And so, I always wanted to be
in the military.

145
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,540
I think it was something
that I knew probably
from a very young age,

146
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,380
and I think at the time
that I was raised,

147
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,580
in the place
that I was raised,

148
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,410
it was just
so proudly touted,

149
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
you know, the pride
that everybody has in America,

150
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,190
and I wanted to be
a part of that growing up.

151
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,990
<i> When I first entered</i>
<i> the military,</i>

152
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,560
I became a combat engineer,
and a part of what you do is,

153
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,360
you do a little bit of work
with explosives.

154
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,160
You do work with landmines,
with cratering,

155
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,070
with things like that,
and that's kind of where I got

156
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,700
my first real taste
of working with demolition.

157
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,500
And so I said okay, I'm gonna
become a bomb technician.

158
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,710
<i> It's something</i>
<i> that you actually</i>

159
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,740
<i> have to volunteer for.</i>

160
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,010
I basically began the process
to select and assess

161
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,020
for an Army special operations
bomb technician unit

162
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,450
that was being newly created

163
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,920
specifically to support
the Army Rangers.

164
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,270
I had known
about the tradition

165
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,100
of Army Rangers, you know,
long ago,

166
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,300
<i> and I had some opportunities</i>
<i> to work with those guys,</i>

167
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,370
<i> and I was always</i>
<i> very impressed</i>

168
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,240
<i> by the work that they did</i>

169
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,110
<i> and, you know, impressed</i>
<i> with the ethic that they had.</i>

170
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,210
<i> And so when this unit</i>
<i> was being created,</i>

171
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,980
basically saying
Army Rangers are out there
on the battlefield,

172
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,280
they don't have
a specific group

173
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,790
of bomb technicians
that can meet the need

174
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,460
of, of working
on the battlefield.

175
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
I went through
a very rigorous

176
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,830
selection
and assessment process

177
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,260
as a part
of joining this team.

178
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,800
<i> He's probably one</i>
<i> of the best techs</i>

179
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,630
<i> that we've had</i>
<i>that I worked with, hands down.</i>

180
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,230
I mean, he would move through,
through areas

181
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,770
where I was kind of,
you know, tiptoeing around,

182
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,600
hoping I don't step
on something.

183
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,270
He'd just walk
right by me like,
"Get outta the way.

184
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,740
I'm trying to look
for something," you know.

185
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,440
Looking for tripwire
and stuff like that,

186
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,280
and here I am on eggshells.

187
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,310
You know, that's a big
threat factor, these IEDs,

188
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,820
and Brian is the one that's

189
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,250
eliminating
this threat factor.

190
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,150
<i> And he saved our butts</i>
<i> a few times beforehand,</i>

191
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,460
<i> so, you know,</i>
<i> we have confidence.</i>

192
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,760
<i> You learn the--</i>
<i> the hazards of the job,</i>

193
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,160
<i> and you learn the best way</i>
<i> that you can combat</i>
<i> those hazards.</i>

194
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,660
<i> You're never gonna</i>
<i> completely remove risk</i>

195
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,630
<i> from the job</i>
<i> that you're doing,</i>

196
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,170
but you know
what the risks are,

197
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,770
and you know that somebody

198
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,340
has to take those risks
for the purpose of something

199
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,370
that's bigger
and more important

200
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,040
than ourselves
as individuals.

201
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,380
<i> I knew that</i>
<i> every single night</i>

202
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,650
<i> that I was</i>
<i> going out with them,</i>

203
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,720
I was going to have
the opportunity

204
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,480
to, very likely,

205
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,820
put myself in between,
you know,

206
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,390
these guys
that I call my brothers

207
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,590
and something that,
that's trying to kill them.

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,070
playing ]

209
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,520
<i> Working out there</i>
<i> on the battlefield</i>

210
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,550
<i> during this time frame,</i>

211
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,660
we were seeing
Improvised Explosive Devices,

212
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,530
ambushes, and enemy gunfire

213
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,930
on practically
every single mission
that we were a part of,

214
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,270
and it seemed like
90% of the people
that we were going after

215
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,600
were IED builders,
IED, you know, facilitators.

216
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,610
<i> We would use</i>
<i> satellite imagery</i>

217
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,310
<i> to figure out,</i>
<i> "Okay this is where</i>
<i> we're gonna land,</i>

218
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,480
<i> and this is gonna be</i>
<i> the best route</i>

219
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,840
<i> to walk to this compound,</i>

220
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,850
and sometimes you'd have
to sacrifice safety

221
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,280
for efficiency
and vice-versa,

222
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,980
and depending on
whatever intel

223
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,120
you had about that.

224
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,020
<i> As the explosive expert</i>

225
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,520
<i> that was</i>
<i> a part of that team,</i>

226
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,560
<i> part of my job</i>
<i> during the planning phases</i>

227
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,890
was to say,
"This is where our target is.

228
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,330
Here's every
Improvised Explosive Device
that's gone off

229
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,870
as long as I can find history
for this."

230
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,830
<i> I would actually</i>
<i> get some reports</i>

231
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,700
<i> because I would work</i>
<i> in a conjunction</i>

232
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
<i> with the guys who did my job</i>
<i> from Special Forces teams,</i>

233
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,570
and I share it
with the platoon leader,

234
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,380
which is what I do
for a job.

235
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,180
<i> I always wanted</i>
<i> to be in the military.</i>

236
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,980
When I was really small,
you know, Rambo and Top Gun

237
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,820
and all these movies
were coming out,

238
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,820
and Arnold Schwarzenegger
in Commando,

239
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,820
and I really got interested
in the military

240
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,660
at a very young age.

241
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,560
<i> I-- My mom wanted me</i>
<i> to go to college</i>

242
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,560
<i> because my two older brothers</i>
<i> were already in the Army.</i>

243
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,270
So, I went
for one semester,

244
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,770
didn't tell them
I dropped out,

245
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,740
went and signed up
and got into the military.

246
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,540
They weren't too happy
about that, so.

247
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,510
<i> My father</i>
<i> always raised us up,</i>

248
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,280
<i> you did something,</i>
<i> you have to do it</i>
<i> to the finish.</i>

249
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,250
<i> That carried on</i>
<i> to the military also.</i>

250
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,850
<i> I mean, obviously that's how</i>
<i> I got to the Ranger Regiment.</i>

251
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,780
<i> I, I didn't ever go</i>
<i> to the conventional Army.</i>

252
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,390
<i> I went straight through--</i>
<i> From selection,</i>

253
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,850
<i> I went straight</i>
<i> to Second Ranger Battalion.</i>

254
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,720
At that time
they were revamping

255
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,930
our reconnaissance section,
and I went and tried out.

256
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,600
For me, it was everything
that I wanted to do,
and I was good at it.

257
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,560
<i> Individuals who are</i>
<i> in the reconnaissance section</i>

258
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,470
<i> are kind of like</i>
<i> the computer geeks, you know.</i>

259
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,770
We gather intelligence
via different means.

260
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,900
They can be
sitting on the side

261
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,940
of a mountain
taking pictures

262
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,740
that help us hone in
on certain individuals
that we're looking for.

263
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,380
<i> Then we use certain devices</i>

264
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,880
<i> to help us</i>
<i> accomplish the mission.</i>

265
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:27,060
<i> We would have a compound</i>
<i> that we had preselected.</i>

266
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,730
These compounds were chosen
because they were, you know,

267
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,000
advantageous to us
in some fashion,

268
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,440
and they were chosen
because they were
in a particular hotspot,

269
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,840
<i> and this is</i>
<i> where the Taliban is.</i>

270
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,170
<i> And we would go in</i>
<i> at night.</i>

271
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,680
<i> As soon as you</i>
<i> get on the bird,</i>

272
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,780
you're kinda thinking
and practicing in your head,

273
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,350
like, what to do
when this happens,

274
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,820
what to do when that happens,
just trying to be

275
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,320
<i> mentally prepared</i>
<i> as much as you can.</i>

276
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,120
<i> We'd get out, form up,</i>

277
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,360
<i> and wait</i>
<i> for the helicopters</i>

278
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,660
to take off,
just kind of listen,

279
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,690
look, listen for a while,

280
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,030
and then we make a formation
and start walking.

281
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,530
<i> There's a lot of nights</i>
<i> of walking</i>

282
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,840
<i> some pretty long miles</i>

283
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,110
to take over
a very specific area.

284
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,340
<i> So, we would raid</i>
<i> one of these compounds,</i>

285
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,710
<i> clear it,</i>
<i> secure all the people</i>

286
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,380
<i> that are living in there,</i>
<i> and then we'd fortify it.</i>

287
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,050
Get down,
get down, get down!

288
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,120
We busted out
the sledgehammers
and the shovels

289
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,650
and started putting holes
in the walls

290
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,720
<i> and sandbagging everything</i>
<i> we could do</i>

291
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,350
<i> and, and set up our gun ports</i>
<i> and gun points</i>

292
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,860
and set up as best we could.

293
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,230
<i> And then we'd take</i>
<i> all these inhabitants</i>

294
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,700
that were living there
and we'd say, "Hey, you guys
know where the Taliban are.

295
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,000
We want you to go out there
and go find somewhere safe
to be,

296
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,000
leave the area, and tell them
that we're right here

297
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,400
and that
we're here to fight.

298
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,670
<i> A couple of times</i>
<i> we would take</i>

299
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,470
<i> a big old American flag,</i>
<i> and we would throw it up</i>
<i> on the roof,</i>

300
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,740
<i> and we would wait for them</i>
<i> to start shooting at us.</i>

301
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,010
You know,
the sun would come up,

302
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,240
and we'd get
that first little burst

303
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,710
of machine gun fire
or something

304
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,380
that was aimed at us,
and then it was on.

305
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,250
<i> We'd let them</i>
<i> kind of surround us.</i>

306
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,150
We'd let them close in on us,
get real close.

307
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,360
<i> If we can draw them in</i>
<i> and get them into places</i>

308
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,060
<i> where we can see them</i>
<i> we know where they're at</i>

309
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
you know, because
they don't wear a uniform.

310
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,330
It's difficult, you know,
but if we can get
all of the civilians

311
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,900
<i> out of an area,</i>
<i> like we were doing,</i>

312
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,530
<i> and draw</i>
<i> all of the combatants in,</i>

313
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,840
<i> so that we--</i>
<i> They were clearly identified,</i>

314
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,940
<i> then we could just</i>
<i> let the planes go to work</i>
<i> and do their thing.</i>

315
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,710
The Taliban was getting
pretty dialed into where,

316
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,680
where we were,
and they were starting
to get closer and closer

317
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,720
with their mortar strengths,
and one of them came in

318
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,290
and landed right
in the mortar pit,

319
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,560
right where our guys were.

320
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,860
<i> Doing this mission,</i>

321
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,560
<i> they were just</i>
<i> getting beat up,</i>

322
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,260
<i> casualties left and right,</i>
<i> losing some guys.</i>

323
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,900
As a medic, I have to be
the guy with the answers.

324
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,300
I have to be the guy
who knows what to do.

325
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,370
You want to do your job
and actually be fulfilled,

326
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,970
but again you don't want
your guys to be hurt.

327
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,580
<i> Growing up</i>
<i> in Columbus, Nebraska,</i>

328
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,710
<i> I kind of wanted</i>
<i> a fresh start,</i>

329
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,080
just kind of wanted
to venture out a little bit

330
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,750
and kind of see maybe
who I was, you know,

331
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,260
like what I could get into,
you know.

332
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,460
Going into military I knew
just one thing,

333
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,160
like I wanted to be a medic,

334
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,400
and so, as close
to a paramedic as I could be.

335
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,100
But being a 20-year-old kid,
I definitely didn't feel ready

336
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,340
to be able to take care
of someone,

337
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,670
until I got a slot
for SOCM,

338
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,570
for a Special Operation
Combat Medic course,

339
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,840
so that helped out a lot.

340
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,240
I'd just run through
our training

341
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,510
and our medical assessment

342
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,350
just over and over
and over again,

343
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,650
and just, you know,
really pound it in.

344
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,320
<i> My first deployment</i>
<i> was to Kandahar.</i>

345
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,460
We had 50, 60, 70 missions
that first deployment.

346
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,960
I mean, no one got hurt,
I didn't have to do anything.

347
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,090
<i> My second deployment</i>
<i> with Team Merrill</i>

348
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,600
<i> was pretty much completely</i>
<i> different.</i>

349
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,200
You're gonna take casualties,
you're gonna take contact,

350
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,700
like you definitely
will be tested as a medic.

351
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,710
And so me,
me with one deployment,

352
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,670
I mean that was kind of
very nerve-wracking.

353
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,780
<i> Our ranger medics are awesome,</i>

354
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,150
<i> and to see Cody just be</i>
<i> just as professional</i>

355
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,380
<i> and just as elite</i>
<i> as every other medic</i>

356
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,880
<i> that I held</i>
<i> at a very high standard.</i>

357
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,350
Those guys,
for me

358
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,850
are the kind of guys that,
I would say,

359
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,790
are more of like our heroes,
because while everybody else

360
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,520
is getting to fight,
they're trying to save lives.

361
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,060
This is, you know,
a very dangerous mission that,

362
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,200
that we were all a part of,
as is very evident

363
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,240
by the number of casualties
that were incurred.

364
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,840
We went into some really
hot places,

365
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,540
and we were usually going
into compounds

366
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,140
where we had
traditionally found

367
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,150
a lot of Improvised
Explosive Devices.

368
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,080
But in order for me
to save the lives that,
that I was able to affect,

369
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,050
I had to also be there
for the day that, you know,

370
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,590
being on the battlefield
almost claimed my own life.

371
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,310
<i> September 19, 2010.</i>

372
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,650
<i> We were going out</i>
<i> for a whole night.</i>

373
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,920
We were gonna try
to draw in the enemy

374
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,550
to combat us all day long.

375
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,690
<i> It was about my 40th,</i>
<i> maybe 45th mission</i>
<i> with this unit.</i>

376
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,730
<i> We had been doing</i>
<i> these missions already.</i>

377
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,060
It was no different
than what we had been doing.

378
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,600
<i> The objective</i>
<i> we were actually going to</i>
<i> was a Taliban stronghold.</i>

379
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,840
We had an intelligence and,
from Special Forces guys

380
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,040
that we knew that
that was a safe house for them.

381
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,040
<i> A lot of missions,</i>
<i> as soon as the birds</i>

382
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,810
<i> are coming in the area,</i>
<i> they are taking fire.</i>

383
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,910
This particular one,
it was dead quiet, dead quiet.

384
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,290
<i> Coming into an area</i>
<i> that we knew</i>

385
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,420
<i> was a Taliban stronghold,</i>

386
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,030
and nobody in the area
kind of flicking their lights
off and on,

387
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,630
nobody is checking up on us.

388
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,530
<i> We just pull our security,</i>
<i> and we take a knee,</i>

389
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,030
and kinda hear that eerie
silence and, you know.

390
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,770
All the dust is settling
and it's clear again,

391
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,470
it's quiet,
like almost too quiet.

392
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,780
My job basically was just follow
the platoon sergeant around,

393
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,210
that's the easiest
way for me.

394
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,780
Again, this is
my second deployment,

395
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,720
so I was just kind of
lost in the sauce I guess.

396
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,150
<i> My partner, James</i>
<i> was walking point.</i>

397
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,490
Brian Mast, our EOD tech,
was right behind him.

398
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,720
We would walk,
usually maybe like 100 meters

399
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,260
ahead of the rest
of the platoon,

400
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,560
and they would follow
right behind us.

401
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,130
But when you have 50,
you know, some odd Rangers

402
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,770
with all this gear,
all this equipment,
it gets loud.

403
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,070
And when it's just
the four of us up front,
it was pretty quiet.

404
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,580
Maybe I perceive it as safe,
and it really isn't.

405
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,940
As a sniper,
we would use spotting scopes

406
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,580
in our riflescopes
to just look.

407
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,580
We're just looking
for target indicators.

408
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,350
We're looking for Taliban
that are moving into position.

409
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,660
<i>- Working with the snipers,</i>
<i>- I put the same trust in them</i>

410
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,420
that they were protecting me,
that they had my back,

411
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,290
that I didn't have to worry
for one second

412
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,530
about somebody jumping out
and putting a bullet in me

413
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,800
because they were gonna
put a bullet in them

414
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,470
before they could ever
get to me.

415
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,700
In our job, you know,
we don't deal with explosives.

416
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,600
They, they're terrifying to us,
and they ask us to navigate

417
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,310
and to walk point
and to lead out.

418
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,680
I've always been enamored
with snipers.

419
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,780
I always thought
that was the coolest thing ever.

420
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,450
I shot a lot of guns growing up.
You know, your dad's a cop,

421
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,190
he's got a safe
full of guns

422
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,260
that we would always
go out and go shoot.

423
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,560
I learned that early on
and I learned a love for that
early on.

424
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,530
Maybe that translated
into wanting to do that job,
or being able to.

425
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,400
And I would watch war movies,
Black Hawk Down specifically.

426
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,600
I watched that movie
75 times.

427
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,370
I was just obsessed with,
with being a part of that.

428
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,480
<i> So, my heart was always set</i>
<i> on going and being a Ranger.</i>

429
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,550
<i>Maybe it was just the mystique.</i>
<i> Maybe it was just, you know,</i>

430
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,820
<i> they have a phenomenal</i>
<i> reputation.</i>

431
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,150
So I kind of thought,
you know, Ranger Regiment,

432
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,350
these people here, you know,
they want to be here.

433
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,230
They've all endured
the same amount of, of--

434
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,390
of suck,
I guess is the word.

435
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,760
That's the only one
I can think of.

436
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,570
<i> I wanted to do</i>
<i> the team Merrill deployment.</i>

437
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:23,170
<i> I wanted the, the action.</i>
<i> I wanted to test myself.</i>

438
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,240
I'm not the strongest,
I'm not the fastest or anything,

439
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,080
but I'll just keep putting
one foot in front of the other.

440
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,880
Can't make me quit, so.

441
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,750
As snipers, we were in charge
of navigating,

442
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,190
planning routes before
the mission even kicked off

443
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,690
and getting that platoon
to and from the compound
that we were going to.

444
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,920
<i> So basically</i>
<i> we ended up walking</i>

445
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,260
<i> a very rudimentary dirt road</i>

446
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,530
with brush and weeds and,
and trees on both sides.

447
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,560
<i> Just to the right of that,</i>
<i> right off the edge,</i>

448
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,570
you have this, maybe six,
seven-foot deep sewage canal.

449
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,870
<i> The waterways are disgusting,</i>

450
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,940
but these are basically outflows
for, you know, for human waste.

451
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,650
<i> On the other side</i>
<i> of that canal there's a wall,</i>

452
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,880
<i> and the wall is probably</i>
<i> eight feet high.</i>

453
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,250
<i> We had to get, you know,</i>
<i> all 50 dudes across this area</i>

454
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,060
<i> to get to where the possible</i>
<i> Taliban stronghold was.</i>

455
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,660
<i> Because of the combination</i>

456
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,760
<i> of the steep embankment</i>
<i> and the very high wall,</i>

457
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,930
it was something that
we couldn't just ladder over.

458
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,160
That's the, the normal way
that we would have preferred

459
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,130
to cross a wall like that.

460
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,100
We found a break in the wall

461
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,100
that we had previously
identified

462
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,840
and thought that could be
a potential crossing point.

463
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,470
<i> As we approached, I said,</i>

464
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,410
"Look, if I was a bomber
living anywhere around here,

465
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,840
this is exactly
where I would place a device.

466
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,620
<i> We took this ladder,</i>

467
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,590
<i> and we laid it</i>
<i> across the canal,</i>

468
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,020
and my partner James
walked across,

469
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,190
then Brian walks across.

470
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,300
<i> Walking on the battlefield</i>
<i> puckers you up.</i>

471
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,930
Walking across
one of these bridging ladders

472
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,000
in a wide-open area,
it's very likely a place

473
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,540
that they might also conduct
an ambush.

474
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,040
There might very well be
somebody's sights

475
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,310
trained on me right now,

476
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,380
and so it becomes
very precarious.

477
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,780
Brian gets over there,
and they do their thing.

478
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,520
They look for tripwires,
kind of check the ground to see

479
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,620
if there is disturbed earth and
see if there's pressure plates

480
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,620
or something
that was recently dug there.

481
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,660
<i>I'm making sure there's nothing</i>

482
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,960
<i> where the water</i>
<i> meets the embankment.</i>

483
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,530
Eventually I think I got down
on my hands and knees,

484
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,370
and I pulled that small handheld
metal detector out of my pocket,

485
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,970
and I gently probed the earth
in front of me to, you know,

486
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,840
to look and see
if I could find anything

487
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,440
because I was so convinced
that there was something there.

488
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,570
There had
to be something there.

489
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,350
We were waiting for them
to give us the okay to cross.

490
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,590
<i> We can't take forever</i>
<i> doing that, you know.</i>

491
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,720
<i> The mission, it has to go on.</i>

492
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,560
<i> The things that we're doing</i>
<i> are time-sensitive.</i>

493
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,820
And as I remember,
you know,

494
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,830
I gave the snipers
the signal,

495
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,560
indicated that we were gonna
move ahead.

496
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,230
<i> I start walking across,</i>

497
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,530
<i> and you're doing all this</i>
<i> in the middle of the night,</i>

498
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,040
<i> and you're doing it</i>
<i> weighed down by, you know,</i>

499
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,040
however heavy your rifle
and machine gun is.

500
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,670
You're doing it with a helmet
with night vision on.

501
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,280
That is very disorienting.

502
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,350
And I slipped.

503
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,090
It's sewage,
It's gross, you know.

504
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,690
And you're soaking wet.

505
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,960
I remember dropping
just about every curse word

506
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,960
in the dictionary,
just furious.

507
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,700
Brian turns around
to come back

508
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,030
and help pull me
out of that creek.

509
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,540
I took maybe one or two steps
towards that river way...

510
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,580
<i> There's just a cloud</i>
<i> of-- of dirt,</i>

511
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,550
which browns out
your night vision,
you can't see a thing.

512
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,480
The blast and the concussion,

513
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,720
it's so, so fast, you know,
you don't know what that was.

514
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,380
<i> We're stopped up at the wall</i>

515
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,920
<i> within the first 10 minutes,</i>
<i>15 minutes of, of the objective</i>

516
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,320
and where everybody
is taking a knee and facing out,

517
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,360
and we're figuring out
how we're going to get
past this obstacle.

518
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,230
And the blast went off.

519
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,940
The plume of smoke went up
easily 60, 70 feet into the air.

520
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,770
To be honest,
my first assessment was

521
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,140
whoever was hit by that,
is probably not alive anymore.

522
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,820
The Improvised Explosive Device
that I thought was there

523
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,890
found me,
or, or I found it.

524
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,390
It was just
the brightest white flash

525
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,730
that I can remember,
and, and it blinding me.

526
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,100
You know, in the movies
people always think,

527
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,470
you hear this click,
and then you have time to think,

528
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,600
what was that?
And then an explosion happens.

529
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,300
This just,
it happened immediately

530
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,910
just as quick
as you flick on the lights,

531
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,610
and to me
it felt like this punch

532
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,240
from some heavyweight boxer
had just landed on my chin,

533
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,680
and it tumbled me
through the air.

534
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,350
I can remember feeling
like my teeth were rattled

535
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,620
from this explosion,
and as I'm laying there,

536
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,360
I still had my earphones on
and I could hear at that point,

537
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,030
"EOD was hit, that EOD is down."
And that's me.

538
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,000
That's what really
brought it home,

539
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,370
to say I was the one that,
that triggered this device.

540
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,140
<i> I had no idea</i>
<i> what had just happened.</i>

541
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,540
<i> I thought maybe</i>
<i> it had something</i>
<i> to do with me falling in</i>

542
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,340
<i> or something because</i>
<i> it all happened at, like,</i>
<i> the exact same moment</i>

543
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:07,450
Brian was coming back to help
pull me out of that creek.

544
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,850
I started climbing my way
out of the canal.

545
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:15,490
I got up there,
and Brian was laying on his back

546
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,460
right in front
of this break in the wall.

547
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,030
<i> The wind is knocked out of me,</i>
<i> and I can remember,</i>

548
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,470
all this dust
and dirt that had buried
this IED in the ground,

549
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,470
that was all blown up into me.
And I'm laying there,

550
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,610
and I'm realizing, okay,
there's some good reason

551
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,710
that I can't stand up right now,
and I was in a lot of pain.

552
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,550
<i> I still can't see anything</i>

553
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,350
<i> but just like the outline</i>
<i> of a person</i>

554
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,880
<i> because it's so browned out</i>
<i> with sand and dust.</i>

555
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,350
So I started patting down
his arms and his legs,

556
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,760
and I get to where
his knees are, and it stops.

557
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,390
And that didn't click, again.

558
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,060
I didn't realize what had just
happened, what I was feeling.

559
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,100
And I did it again,
and I looked down to his,

560
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,830
about his knees, and then
I didn't feel anything else,

561
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,730
and I thought,
that's really weird.

562
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,900
And that's when my partner
started screaming for a medic.

563
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,370
As soon as I hear that,
you know, it's just,

564
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,540
I don't know
if it's instinct or what,

565
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,540
like I started booking
straight through towards the,

566
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,780
the bridge point.

567
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,580
The training kicks over.
You go on autopilot almost.

568
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,590
<i> It was awesome to see Cody</i>

569
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,590
immediately react
without regard
for his own safety.

570
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,590
We could be in a minefield,
we don't know,

571
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,790
and he didn't care.

572
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,560
It was his job
to be there,

573
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,530
and that's what Rangers do,
we're there for each other.

574
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,400
And he just deadlined
straight for him.

575
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,230
I didn't really think of,
you know,

576
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,240
there could be more IEDs,
or could be an ambush

577
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,600
or something like that.

578
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,770
I just, you know,
someone yelled "medic."

579
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,640
and that's where I'm gonna go.

580
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,980
Cody comes up there,
and he just starts rattling,

581
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,810
rattling off tasks,
"All right, we gotta
get this done,"

582
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,710
and he's just displaying nothing
but the utmost confidence.

583
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,250
<i>- I still didn't know who it was.</i>
<i>- I mean, I think I saw EOD,</i>

584
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,390
<i> so I knew, like,</i>
<i> That's our EOD guy.</i>
<i> That's Mast.</i>

585
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,060
The first thing I look at,
I see his legs.

586
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,490
I'm like,
that's weird.

587
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,960
What the heck are those
tree branches doing

588
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,100
sticking out of his legs,

589
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,330
like is he laying under,
under like a tree branch
or something?

590
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,630
Like, what's going on here?
And I throw my aid bag down,

591
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,070
and I look like, My God,
those are his femurs.

592
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,270
And I think he
said, like,

593
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,640
"I can't breathe"
or whatnot,

594
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,480
so that alarmed me,
so I threw his body armor off,
didn't find any holes.

595
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,820
<i> You know, my lungs feel</i>
<i> like they are filled with,</i>

596
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,750
you know, chalk or something.
It was making me cough,

597
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,860
and I feel like I'm blinded.
I'm having to wipe all the--

598
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,260
all the dirt
and, and all of this
out of my eyes,

599
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
And it was right about
at that time that I really

600
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,460
started to figure out
that I was seriously injured.

601
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,330
I'm, I'm looking
at my left arm,

602
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,840
And my left arm,
all of these fingers,
they were broken,

603
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,540
and they were pointing
in just really crazy directions.

604
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,480
<i> This scenario.</i>

605
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,110
<i> I had been trained on</i>
<i> what to do</i>

606
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,380
in situations like this
a hundred times over,

607
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,450
and I froze.

608
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,820
It took a minute, it was weird,
definitely took a minute,

609
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,690
but finally the medic said,
"Throw a tourniquet on him,"

610
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,290
and that's when everything
clicked.

611
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,300
That's about when I kind of
came out of the haze,

612
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,200
and everything kind of
kicked back on, you know.

613
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,410
I had a little system reboot
and kinda thought,

614
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,210
Okay, I know what to do here.

615
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,740
I put a tourniquet
on one of his legs,

616
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,250
the medics put one on his
other leg and then on his arm.

617
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,480
It's probably
the most painful thing

618
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,720
that I can remember
ever happening.

619
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,060
You know, if the end of my limb
looked something like this,

620
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,660
they were wrenching a tourniquet
down on top of it

621
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,390
to tighten it down
as tight as they possibly could

622
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,060
to make sure I don't hemorrhage
out on the battlefield.

623
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,270
We're lucky that, you know,
the blast cauterized his legs,

624
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,700
and he wasn't bleeding
very much.

625
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,740
And then they start
working on other things,

626
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,280
getting his equipment off,
you know, running fluids on him

627
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,450
and doing their thing,
and at that point
I stepped back.

628
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,880
<i> The platoon sergeant is like,</i>

629
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,350
"Doc, you have two minutes
to get over across the river

630
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,420
before the medevac bird
comes down.

631
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,720
Like, he wasn't even
on the cot at all,

632
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,030
the blanket was,
like, getting set up,

633
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,960
so we had to start,
start booking it.

634
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,570
I remember thinking,
"My gosh," you know,
"this is crazy."

635
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,260
<i> After the blast,</i>
<i> we pulled security,</i>

636
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,460
held on tight.
They continued to work on Brian.

637
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,030
We had, you know,
our medics working on him.

638
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,200
<i> I'm working on the edge</i>
<i> of this riverbank,</i>

639
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,940
so I'm like, partly falling off
and trying not to lose my bag

640
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,440
and my gear and not let him
fall in, you know,

641
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,610
and trying to get him
packaged up, so we're like,

642
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,910
we got two minutes
to get over across the river.

643
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,220
I'm kind of talking to Brian,
trying to get IV access.

644
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,490
I asked him to see if he was,
like, with it or not,
alert and oriented.

645
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,320
So like, "Hey, Mast, can you
tell me your first name?"

646
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,660
He was asking me questions
that they're trained to ask,

647
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,660
you know, things to basically
help keep my mind sharp

648
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,760
and my mind focused
and prevent shock.

649
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,970
And he said that I was almost
offended as though, you know,

650
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:31,240
What, you don't,
how do you not know my name?

651
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,940
<i> He wasn't screaming</i>
<i> or anything like that,</i>

652
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,810
so it kinda, kinda threw me off
initially, like I mean,

653
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,850
he's lost both your legs,
a big wound on your arm,

654
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,120
just kind of inappropriately
calm, you know?

655
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,620
Before really getting ready
to lift him and move him,

656
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,360
he's like, "Hey, can I have
something for the med--

657
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,990
for the pain?"
I'm like, that hit me like,

658
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,990
Crap, like, how did I
completely forget about this?

659
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,860
I grabbed one of our
fentanyl lollipops,

660
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,330
just kinda like a morphine
derivative.

661
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,200
So then we taped it
to his finger and told him

662
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,040
to put it in his mouth
and just suck on it.

663
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,610
<i> After that, they got</i>
<i> me onto the stretcher,</i>

664
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:13,150
and this all happened
in a really quick period
of time.

665
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,810
<i>- This canal that</i>
<i>- I was doing everything</i>

666
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,880
<i> I could to not fall into,</i>

667
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,350
we had to have a bunch of guys,
like, dive in there.

668
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,720
We had a four-person carry team,
one on each--

669
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,790
one of the legs
of the stretcher.

670
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,830
We kind of had to ladder down.

671
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,830
<i> Brian is a big dude,</i>

672
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,400
and he's weighed down
by all of his equipment,

673
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,000
and carrying him,
it was tough, you know.

674
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,030
<i> It was a very surreal</i>
<i> experience</i>

675
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,540
<i> being transported</i>
<i> on the stretcher.</i>

676
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,210
We're used to seeing
the world go by

677
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,310
as we walk around the world
vertically,

678
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,780
and all of a sudden I'm laying
on the flat of my back,

679
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,050
and I'm seeing
the world go by like this.

680
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,150
As we get close
to that helicopter,

681
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,050
it kicks up a huge amount
of dust and dirt
and hay and straw

682
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,990
and anything else
that might be on the ground.

683
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,230
I don't have any goggles on,
and so all of that

684
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,060
that the helicopters kick up,
it's all landing on top of me.

685
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,570
And it was just,
it was a very surreal
experience.

686
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,200
You know,
somebody gave me a salute

687
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,800
and told me
that I was gonna be okay.

688
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:14,040
And that's the last thing
that I remember from that night.

689
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,680
<i> We got him out of that field,</i>

690
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,080
and the helicopters
picked him up and took off,

691
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,950
and it was dead silent.

692
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,650
And we're right back
where we started,

693
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,260
just short one guy.

694
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,560
<i> As soon as that bird</i>
<i> left, I was just exhausted,</i>

695
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,230
<i> like, mentally</i>
<i> and kind of physically, too,</i>

696
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,600
but we had a whole
30-hour mission ahead of us,

697
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,870
so, you know,
you don't really
have time to relax

698
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,640
and just do the next part.

699
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,110
<i> We took a quick</i>
<i> regrouping break</i>

700
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,370
<i> to kind of figure out where</i>
<i> we were gonna go from there.</i>

701
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,440
It was about that time
that we started to realize

702
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,480
that this area
that we're working in right now,

703
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,450
there's nobody here,
and there's all these mines

704
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,450
and explosives everywhere,
and I just kinda thought,

705
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:00,650
you know, it's like this is like
one giant trap that they set.

706
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,220
You have to fight on
to the Ranger objective.

707
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,290
That's, that's the creed.
That's what we do.

708
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,090
<i> And so we made a decision</i>
<i> to move on</i>

709
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,230
<i> and to continue the mission</i>
<i> and find a new route.</i>

710
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,300
I was terrified.
Terrified.

711
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,330
And, you know,
I'm not ashamed to admit that.

712
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,570
I think there's a lot of people
that won't,

713
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,410
but, you know,
that's how I felt.

714
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,840
<i> We would cross</i>
<i> the river, waist deep,</i>

715
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,310
<i> and cross back</i>
<i> and kinda go back and forth.</i>

716
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,750
I feel like we crossed it, like,
four or five different times,

717
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,150
and it sucks getting wet.

718
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,690
<i> It was a little</i>
<i> nerve-wracking to be walking</i>

719
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,160
in waist deep, and up to
some parts chest-deep water,

720
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,030
and not knowing
the next step.

721
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:43,130
<i> It took hour, hour and a half,</i>
<i> to get to our objective.</i>

722
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,600
That was an occupied compound,
people lived there,

723
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,500
and we set up shop
just like we always do.

724
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,540
<i> Once we were all</i>
<i> in the compound,</i>

725
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,640
<i> and we had all our positions,</i>
<i> you just kind of sit there</i>

726
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,140
and wait and pull security,
kind of calm down

727
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,050
and let all this
kind of come over you.

728
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,010
That's when I kinda realized
that when this blast went off,

729
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,790
I was in this canal,
and Brian's standing

730
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:09,960
maybe at four feet offset
from where my head was.

731
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,990
Throughout my entire
military career,

732
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,190
through all the training,
through all the missions prior,

733
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,400
I had had nothing
but the utmost confidence

734
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,900
that I was never frightened
by anything.

735
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,070
I had been in, you know,
numerous firefights.

736
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,200
I always felt, you know,
comfortable in my element,

737
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,840
and this totally
threw me off.

738
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,870
I was terrified.

739
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,810
<i> I thought we were,</i>
<i> like, the best, you know.</i>

740
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,540
<i> No one can touch us.</i>
<i> We're invincible.</i>

741
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,550
<i> It's part of the training,</i>
<i> part of the mentality,</i>

742
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:36,320
<i> and, you know, once you,</i>
<i> like, have a casualty</i>

743
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,550
or lose one of your own,
it's very humbling.

744
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,820
Going through all this stuff
together

745
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,820
just kind of solidifies
your unity.

746
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,860
Say you have bad moments
here and there, but, you know,

747
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,560
when you're down,
someone else is right there

748
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,700
to pick you up, too,
and you kind of just feed off

749
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,870
each other's strength
and courage.

750
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,840
<i> We were really tired,</i>
<i> and when you deal</i>

751
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,440
<i> with something</i>
<i> like a medevac,</i>

752
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,510
or you see somebody
get injured,

753
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,610
your adrenaline wears down,
and you get a little
more drained.

754
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,840
So mentally
I was a little more drained,
and I was ready to leave.

755
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,950
We had very, very sparse
contact that whole day.

756
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,750
It was a very,
very quiet mission

757
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,450
relative to all the other
missions that we had been on.

758
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,690
<i> I think it was</i>
<i> 10:00 PM local time,</i>

759
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,690
<i> it's when we kind of</i>
<i> make our way to exfil.</i>

760
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,230
Once I got back to base,
not a lot of time

761
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,430
to kind of sit and ponder
"what if's"

762
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,700
or what happened here,

763
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,260
or I wonder
how Brian is doing

764
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,130
because you start planning
for the next mission,

765
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,440
and we gotta go do the same
thing the next day.

766
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,090
The next memory that I have
is about five days later,

767
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,090
when I woke up to this nurse
asking me if I knew where I was,

768
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,560
and, to which I said,
"I have no idea where I am."

769
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,900
And she said, you know,
"Your name is Brian Mast.

770
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,970
You're in Washington DC at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center,

771
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,870
and you're gonna be in surgery
in a couple of hours.

772
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,640
<i> I didn't even know</i>
<i> at that point</i>

773
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,910
<i> really what my injuries were.</i>

774
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,620
I didn't know
that I had just, you know,

775
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,780
had both of my legs amputated
somewhere above my knees,

776
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:22,290
or that I had
a missing index finger
or damage to my forearm.

777
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,590
I really didn't know
what the injuries were.

778
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,830
I honestly believed, you know,
in those first couple of weeks

779
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:35,940
after injury that I was gonna
slap on a pair of prosthetics,

780
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,400
do physical therapy
for a couple of weeks,

781
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,940
<i> and I was gonna</i>
<i> be out on the next rotation,</i>

782
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,280
<i> you know,</i>
<i> with those guys,</i>

783
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,140
<i> working on</i>
<i> the battlefield again.</i>

784
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:49,850
<i> I didn't fully realize</i>
<i> that I was about to enter</i>
<i> a new normal to life</i>

785
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,850
<i> that didn't involve</i>
<i> being on the battlefield,</i>

786
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,320
<i> you know, with these guys</i>
<i> that I call my brothers.</i>

787
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:02,360
I would no longer
be able to be an asset
to the mission that,

788
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,000
you know, if I ever ended up
on the battlefield again,

789
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,870
I would probably,
in all reality,

790
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,670
be a detriment to the mission,
and I think that's something

791
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:13,510
that can be very difficult
for a lot, for a lot of guys

792
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:17,240
to come to grips with,
to some degree.

793
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,180
<i> The way that I perceive</i>
<i> this whole thing,</i>

794
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,220
<i> I think</i>
<i> it's luck of the draw.</i>

795
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,890
You know, you have
50-some people,

796
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,060
so it's inevitable
that somebody is probably
gonna step on that.

797
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,030
But I think it was because
Brian was coming back

798
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,060
to help pull me
out of that creek,

799
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:42,300
which was a crazy thought,

800
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,470
something I thought
about a lot.

801
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,840
I don't think there's,
for even one second,

802
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,080
that Zach should feel guilty
about anything.

803
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:57,150
We're on the battlefield,
and we do the best that we can

804
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,690
for each other,
for as long as we can do it,

805
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:02,360
in the best way that we know it
at that specific second.

806
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,060
So I like to think that,
you know, the last thing

807
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,860
that I ever did
on the battlefield

808
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,000
was to put myself between,
you know, one of those brothers

809
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,930
and possible injury
and possible death.

810
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,770
It was supposed to be me.

811
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:18,840
It wasn't supposed to be him
or any of the other Rangers.

812
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,440
<i> It wasn't until</i>
<i> after this incident</i>

813
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,350
that I really got to,
you know, see him,

814
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,080
see his personality,

815
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,380
kind of see how he handles
tragedy, how he handles this,

816
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,690
you know, this, this horrible
thing that's happened to him.

817
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,290
Being able to walk
and regain his normal
functioning is just,

818
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:41,030
you know, it's quite
the testament of, you know,

819
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,200
his strength and his drive.

820
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,600
It's awesome to see
a guy like that

821
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,470
have so much determination,
and he's an inspiration

822
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,500
to other veterans
who have gone through,

823
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,870
you know,
situations like his.

824
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,080
<i> The thing</i>
<i> that I'm most proud of,</i>

825
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,380
it's not any,
any medal or award.

826
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,420
<i> It's when the Rangers</i>
<i> gave me a ceremony</i>

827
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,560
<i> to make me an honorary member</i>
<i> of the 75th Ranger Regiment.</i>

828
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,390
That day they said,

829
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:15,060
"You're officially a Ranger.
You're officially one of us."

830
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,270
<i> He is a Ranger in my book.</i>

831
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,640
There is no question about that,
and a lot of guys

832
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,570
are just as hard as him
and just as determined as him.

833
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,910
<i> That was part of what</i>
<i> makes me so proud</i>

834
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,610
<i> about these guys</i>
<i> that I work with,</i>

835
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,250
is they are the tip
of the spear.

836
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,520
<i> Going out every single night,</i>
<i> knowing the hazards</i>

837
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,820
<i> that they were going</i>
<i> to have to combat.</i>

838
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,530
Taking contact and losing guys,
it's just kinda,

839
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,200
it's hard to put into words
that kind of experience.

840
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,270
Just very thankful that you
get home alive, in one piece.

841
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:56,340
I learned more about myself,
and more especially

842
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,040
about the people
that I was working with

843
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,640
on that deployment
than any other.

844
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,440
<i> It was a real learning curve</i>

845
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,180
and involved
life and death.

846
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,150
You couldn't ask for a better
group of guys to be with.

847
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,050
<i> This Merrill deployment</i>
<i> changed the game.</i>

848
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,020
<i> We had lost several guys,</i>
<i> we lost dogs.</i>

849
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,790
We had at least a quarter,
if not a third,

850
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,160
of everybody there
had received a Purple Heart

851
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,890
for getting wounded
in some other fashion,

852
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,230
<i> whether</i>
<i> it was something</i>
<i> on a grand scale</i>

853
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,760
<i> like Brian</i>
<i> losing his legs,</i>

854
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,330
or somebody just catching
a piece of shrapnel.

855
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,970
Americans have always been
willing to pay that price,

856
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,400
and those Rangers
that I work with,

857
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,370
they, they embody
that every single night.
