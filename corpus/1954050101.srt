1
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,995
<i>Five years.</i>

2
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,562
<i>I remember when I
couldn't get five days.</i>

3
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,442
<i>What's your name?</i>

4
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,781
<i>Hey. Adam. Sex addict.</i>

5
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,083
<i>- Hi, Adam.
-Hi, Adam.</i>

6
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,591
<i>I never want to get cocky
about this, you know?</i>

7
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,858
I never want to be,
like, "Yo, look at me.

8
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,992
"I got it all. I got five years.
I got it all figured out."

9
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,831
<i>I've had to make it
a practice.</i>

10
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:44,706
<i>I have to remind myself every day
where this disease could take me.</i>

11
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:54,951
I have to remember jonesing, feeling like I
was gonna fucking die if I didn't have sex.

12
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,618
I've got to be vigilant, you know?
I can't...

13
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,216
I can't be easy with
myself in this program.

14
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,567
<i>So, yeah.</i>

15
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,469
<i>lam grateful to be
sober today.</i>

16
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,529
<i>Thanks.</i>

17
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,473
Thanks for letting me share.

18
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,843
What are you doing?

19
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,143
Hey, I'm Neil. I'm a sexy...

20
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,045
I'm a sex addict.

21
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,845
- Hi, Neil.
-Hi, Neil.

22
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,911
Thanks so much for your share, Adam.
That's some powerful shit, man. Damn.

23
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,617
All right, so let me check in.

24
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,322
How am I doing?

25
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,219
You know, I'm good, actually.

26
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,328
I'm feeling pretty good.

27
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,426
Work's good. Work's great.

28
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,402
All right, what do we got?

29
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,701
Twenty-something male
presenting polysubstance OD.

30
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,208
We gave him the Narcan, then he 
woke up, starting pulling everything,

31
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,505
-and then went out again.
-Got it.

32
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,404
Sir? Can you hear me?

33
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,541
Can you tell me your name, bud?

34
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,879
All right, belly's distended.

35
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,942
Let's get an IV set up
and then put a Foley in.

36
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,420
Put it in what?

37
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,881
Damn.

38
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,893
Looks like a bird egg in a nest.

39
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,789
Poor guy probably
needs a squirrel to jerk him off.

40
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:46,956
Don't you think?

41
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,762
It kind of looks like
an elevator button.

42
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,824
Third floor. Beep.

43
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,564
Dr. Garalla?

44
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,404
Can I see you over here
for a second, please?

45
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,602
<i>You know, but I gotta say it's working.
Totally working.</i>

46
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:07,542
I haven't touched myself in
about a month, which is crazy,

47
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,647
'cause I remember, you know, when I first
heard about the no masturbation rule,

48
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,683
I was, like, "Okay, should I
not breathe while I'm at it?"

49
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,221
Should I not breathe while I'm at it?

50
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,592
All right, well, that wraps it up.

51
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,268
Thanks for letting me share.

52
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,993
Yeah.

53
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,636
Thanks. I'm Mike,
gratefully recovering sex addict.

54
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,971
- Hi, Mike.
-Hi, Mike.

55
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,568
I'm proud of you, birthday boy.

56
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,704
- Really proud.
-Thanks.

57
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,475
And I'm proud to be your sponsor.

58
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,883
<i>So, what's going on with me?Let's see.</i>

59
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,654
<i>Well, I'm grateful to be sober.</i>

60
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:51,996
<i>Been taking
some visual drinks on the streets.</i>

61
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,333
<i>Is it me, or is Manhattan</i>
<i>just one big fucking catwalk?</i>

62
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,836
Hey.

63
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,930
Hey.

64
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:09,745
I'm really embarrassed to say this,
but I forgot your name.

65
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,710
You guys have heard me say this before.
This disease is a fucking bitch.

66
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:21,758
Now I have been sober
15 years in the beverage program.

67
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,384
No problem.

68
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,760
This thing is a whole
different animal.

69
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:32,126
It's like trying to quit crack while
the pipe's attached to your body.

70
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,435
Who serves stale bread?
It's completely stale.

71
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,606
- Have you decided yet?
-Yeah, just one moment.

72
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,307
What's tempeh again?

73
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,511
- Just order the pancakes, Mike.
-Maybe I want to try something different.

74
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:53,922
You know what you should get?
It's the salmon scramble. It's so good.

75
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,621
This time I'm going to go for the

76
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,958
pancakes.

77
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,164
Get off my back.

78
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,631
How's work?

79
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,041
It's pretty good.
We just landed the postal service.

80
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,098
What?

81
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,372
Yup, we're going to be helping
them green all their packaging.

82
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,004
- That's huge. The postal service.
-Right. Yeah.

83
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,709
That's an oxymoron, right?
The postal service.

84
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:24,482
It's like jumbo shrimp
or military intelligence.

85
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,115
No. It's actually not
an oxymoron at all.

86
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,423
They actually deliver the mail.
Postal service.

87
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,090
- But the...
-See, there's no... There's actually no...

88
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,999
- No, but there is. They're having issues.
-Not at all. Not an oxymoron.

89
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,537
So how's the dating?

90
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,736
- What?
-it's...

91
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,945
Come on, you got five years.
It's time.

92
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,745
The point isn't to live like a monk.

93
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,354
-It's easy to be skinny on a desert island.
-I know. I know. I know.

94
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,890
It's not like booze or drugs.
You don't have to shut it off completely.

95
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:00,981
Jesus, I'll start dating.

96
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,391
- Don't just say that to shut me up.
-What do you want me to say?

97
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,859
I don't want you to say anything.
I want you to do.

98
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,487
- Okay, fine. I'll do it.
-Do. Date.

99
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,929
- You are?
-Yes. I'm doing it.

100
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,022
Yeah? Good.

101
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,761
Why couldn't I have
picked an easy sponsor?

102
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,137
Why?

103
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:12,418
I don't know. Maybe
you wanted to recover.

104
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,404
Why are you riding me?

105
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,965
Here. This is for you.

106
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,075
- Subtle.
-If you want to bust my balls...

107
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,275
No! No, no, no! I love it!
Are you kidding me?

108
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,376
I always wanted
one of your touchy-feely rocks.

109
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,443
I want one.
I want a touchy-feely rock, too.

110
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,750
So fucking earn it.

111
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,930
So I'm going to hear your
first step after this, right?

112
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,757
Oh, shit.

113
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,157
Neil.

114
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,602
Dude, I've been working
on it all week.

115
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,571
I totally, totally forgot
that we were doing that today.

116
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,303
You do remember
why you're in this program, right?

117
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,540
- Free bagels?
-You were court ordered.

118
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,639
- Frottage.
-I know.

119
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,708
- Unconsensual touching of other people.
-I know.

120
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,414
Listen, Neil, you gotta do the work.

121
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,320
You have to do whatever it takes.

122
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,417
You think I like
not having a television or a laptop?

123
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:13,089
It fucking blows. But guess what?
It's saving my life, so I do it.

124
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,533
- Is any of this of interest to you, Neil?
-Yes, it's all of interest to me.

125
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,093
Can we please move on?
I'll get it done this week. Thank you.

126
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,166
What happened to your face?

127
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,775
Nothing.

128
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,084
My fellow gastronauts.

129
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,562
I bring you good tidings
and good eatings.

130
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,661
Let's bug out.

131
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:47,211
No, Pinocch, don't do it!
It's me, Jimmy. Put the stick down!

132
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,120
Well, you should have thought about that
before you ratted me out to Geppetto.

133
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,887
That's not my real voice.

134
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,225
Well, then sorry, I'm...

135
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,924
No! Come back! I'm Adam.

136
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,092
- I'm Phoebe.
-Hi, Phoebe.

137
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,136
You are a very cruel man, Adam.

138
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,297
Believe me, it hurts them
far more than it hurts me.

139
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,642
Don't you mean that
the other way around?

140
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,836
No, Phoebe, I don't.

141
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,471
So what you making?

142
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,748
- Flip phone, huh?
-Yeah.

143
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,584
You ever carbon dated this thing?

144
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,760
What are you doing?

145
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,560
Don't be so slow, Pinocchio.

146
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,119
Mike.

147
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,995
Mike, there's someone downstairs.

148
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,325
What?

149
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,162
There's someone downstairs. Get up.

150
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,785
Dad! It's me.

151
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,055
Danny?

152
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,954
I used the Hide-a-Key.

153
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:18,363
- What the fuck are you doing here?
-I wanted to come see you guys.

154
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,637
So you just decided
you'd stop by for a midnight chat?

155
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,800
I've been driving all day.
I didn't have a chance...

156
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,138
So you're hungry.

157
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,940
So you figured
you'd eat our food and then rob us.

158
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:35,283
I'm not going to rob you, Dad.
I haven't used in eight months.

159
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,684
Yeah, right.

160
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,955
I wouldn't believe me either,
I guess, but it's true.

161
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,490
You know how I know
an addict is lying?

162
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,762
His lips are moving.

163
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,257
Mom up there?

164
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,497
She's sleeping.

165
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,035
Danny?

166
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,869
Hey, Mom.

167
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,198
Danny!

168
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,542
Hey.

169
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,211
Oh, my...

170
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,814
Look at you!

171
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:17,959
Kid's stolen money,
sports equipment, his mom's necklace.

172
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,995
Never once said he's sorry.

173
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,927
You know, I've tried to
get him in the rooms.

174
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,767
And you know what they say,

175
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,365
"This is a program for people that
want it, not for people who need it."

176
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:40,177
Hi. Dede. New to the program.

177
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,042
- Hi, Dede.
-Hi, Dede.

178
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,384
There's a lot of dudes in here.

179
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,357
Sorry, my other program
isn't such a sausage fest.

180
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:59,129
My NA sponsor said I needed
to come here because...

181
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,332
"Tell the truth and tell it fast."

182
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,203
The only way
I know how to relate to men is sex.

183
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,145
It's been that way forever.

184
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:14,250
I can remember my mom screaming at me

185
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,879
for grinding on my cousin
when I was, like, four years old.

186
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,551
I took my neighbor's virginity by force
when I was 12,

187
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:27,456
seduced my high school English teacher, got
him fired when he tried to break it off.

188
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,422
My 20s,

189
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:35,567
two abortions,
one long game of musical fuck chairs.

190
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:43,271
So now I'm 30, single,
no dude, no kids.

191
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:51,987
And I just lost my best friend in the
whole world because I fucked her old man.

192
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,758
I didn't even like the douchebag.

193
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,561
But that's what I do.

194
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,361
There's gotta be another way.

195
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,942
There has to be,
or I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

196
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,311
So that's what I got.

197
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,009
Thanks.

198
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,384
- Keep coming back.
-Keep coming back.

199
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,092
At this meeting, we give out chips

200
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,857
to recognize and celebrate sexual
sobriety and to help us in our recovery.

201
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,296
We have found through
our experience that sobriety

202
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:39,234
includes freedom from masturbation and
sex outside of a committed relationship.

203
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,971
Is anybody celebrating 30 days?

204
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,182
Good for you. Good going.

205
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,985
Anybody else, 30 days?

206
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,323
All right, all right!

207
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,026
Anybody else? Anybody else?
Thirty days?

208
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,539
Hey, Friar Tuck. What's going on?

209
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,202
Friar Tuck is going on a date.

210
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,213
- Yeah.
-Way to go!

211
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,684
Well, so what are we talking?
Male, female or shemale?

212
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,312
Hey, babe, you told
me to get out there.

213
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,350
Well, I'm proud of you.
That's good news. That's good news.

214
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,292
- You going to fellowship?
-No, I can't.

215
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,821
I'm meeting up with my sponsee
to go over his first step.

216
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,060
Who, Shecky Greene?

217
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,640
So let's get started. Got your book?

218
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,109
Yeah, my book. So here's the deal.
I didn't really get to...

219
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,044
It's okay. Just let me see it.

220
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,877
I'm operating on, like,
four hours of sleep.

221
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,213
It's fine. We'll just... We'll get it.
We'll get started.

222
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,152
I just... I would have liked
a little bit more time.

223
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,586
Is this it?

224
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,958
I didn't get a chance
to do what I wanted to do.

225
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,521
So, no.

226
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,187
I'm gonna have a lot more time
this week to work on it.

227
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,721
No, man.
This isn't gonna work for me. No.

228
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:16,952
What do you want?

229
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:22,237
Look, you're wasting my time.
This is a complete waste of my time.

230
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,637
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
I can't work with you.

231
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,733
Take it. Take the book.

232
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,744
You can't... 
What, are you dropping me?

233
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,111
I am sorry. What else...
What other choice do I have, really?

234
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,152
I just got a 30-day chip in there,
and you're firing me?

235
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,710
- Neil...
-No, that is all sorts of fucked up, man.

236
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,189
Neil, I told you from the beginning
that you had to do the work.

237
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,385
You haven't done
a single thing in this book.

238
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,950
- Try doing my job.
-What are you talking about?

239
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,327
- This is bullshit.
-Are you out of your mind?

240
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,195
I need this, okay?

241
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,368
I need you to sign my court card.

242
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:56,134
- There it is. That's what this is about?
-That's not what this is about.

243
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,176
Don't worry, Neil.
The chairperson can sign your card.

244
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,734
You don't need me and
I don't need this.

245
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,789
The pages are all stuck fucking together.
If it wasn't you, then who?

246
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:21,258
Who the fuck brought my book outside?
Who the fuck left my book outside?

247
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,798
Who?

248
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,394
Who?

249
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,263
Just tell me who.

250
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,636
If it wasn't you, then who?

251
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,003
Who?

252
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,204
- Who? You know what...
-Shut the fuck up!

253
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,477
Asshole.

254
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,310
What's all this?

255
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,778
Danny's making us breakfast.

256
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,816
This will be interesting.

257
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,186
I have not seen my son in years.
Can you try not chasing him away?

258
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,491
Here we go.

259
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,325
Breakfast a la Danny.

260
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,700
Look at this. It's so fancy.

261
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,098
What's this gonna cost us?

262
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,976
- Nothing.
-Okay.

263
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,637
There's some butter there
if you want it, Ma.

264
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,339
Thank you.

265
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,713
This is really good.

266
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,619
I tried to get yours back, but...

267
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,628
- Oh, honey.
-it's the best I could do.

268
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,304
- Will you put it on me?
-Yeah, of course.

269
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:42,938
So, yeah, I mean, after my
stretch, I bounced around a lot.

270
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:48,450
I worked an oil rig off the Gulf of Mexico,
picked spinach in Central Valley, California.

271
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,647
- Really?
-Yeah. Just basically saw the country.

272
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,554
And you've been sober the whole time?

273
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,455
Yeah.

274
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,425
Just white-knuckling it?

275
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,559
Yeah, you know, not everybody
needs to go with AA, Dad.

276
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,794
Is that right?

277
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,104
Yeah, some people
don't need a group to lean on.

278
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,665
Some people can do it on their own.

279
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,609
Hasn't been my experience.

280
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,516
- You want more coffee?
-Yes, please.

281
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,322
What?

282
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,868
Hey.

283
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,875
- Hello.
-Hello.

284
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,647
If I knew we were gonna be racing, I
would have worn my Livestrong bracelet.

285
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,654
You know,
this actually might be a good time

286
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:01,555
to tell you that
I had breast cancer five years ago.

287
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,488
Oh, God, really?

288
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,763
Yeah.

289
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:14,299
- That's a tough break. I'm sorry.
-Yeah, it was.

290
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,102
But it's fine. I'm fine now, so...

291
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,074
I'm glad to hear that.

292
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,346
So I see you're perspiring a tad.

293
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,907
I just ran 10K.

294
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:33,551
Okay, my initial reaction is to say,
"Well, I just ran a marathon."

295
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,115
But I can't tell
if you're joking or if you're serious.

296
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,161
I'm as serious as cancer.

297
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,655
Wait, you just ran a 10K?

298
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,459
I'm training for the
New York Triathlon.

299
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:54,769
Okay, we need a system here,
some signs to signify.

300
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,904
So when we're serious,
we have to do this.

301
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:01,474
I love that. Okay. Yes, Adam, I'm serious.
I'm training for a triathlon.

302
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,010
Okay.
Okay, you seriously scare/impress me.

303
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,146
Thank you.

304
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,885
And when we're joking,
we can do that.

305
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,522
Did you just pay homage to The Sting?

306
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,487
- My God, you're hot.
-No, you're hot.

307
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,763
What? No, you are.
You're actually very hot.

308
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,862
- Thanks.
-You're extremely hot.

309
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,101
- Let's do this.
-Okay.

310
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:32,774
I'm just getting warmed up here.
I'm ready to go now.

311
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,324
How you doing back there?

312
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:48,125
I'm fine. I'm just drafting.

313
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,460
Okay.

314
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,012
Doctor.

315
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,147
- Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

316
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,487
Yeah, you know, I just...

317
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,058
I really wanted to
apologize for all the

318
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:23,921
joking around and stuff
that I do around here.

319
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:29,303
You know, I think it's really, to be
honest, like, a defense mechanism.

320
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:32,737
You know, for all the pressures
we have here as doctors.

321
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,073
Thank you.
Thank you, that's good to hear.

322
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,543
I think it's also a...

323
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:41,049
I think it's also
kind of a product of my childhood.

324
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,583
My mom, God bless her,

325
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:47,147
she's still alive, but, you know, she was
really sick a lot when I was growing up.

326
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,919
She had IBS, bad,

327
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,326
and the only thing that really made her feel
better was when I would make her laugh.

328
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,161
Apology accepted, okay?
Now if you'll excuse me...

329
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,470
Wait...

330
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:16,082
So I think we can go ahead
and untuck that now.

331
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,054
But that's part of my
intended ensemble.

332
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,886
Okay. And then I'll tuck it back in.

333
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,720
Nice re-tucking.

334
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,118
Would you care for a little GU?

335
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,792
Goo?

336
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,464
I'm new to goo. I...

337
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,366
Oh, dear.

338
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,306
You kind of got some
on your face there.

339
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,903
- Did I get it?
-Lower. Lower.

340
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,313
-It's still there?
-Nope. It's on your chin.

341
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,816
My Shin?

342
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,984
It's on your chin.

343
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,248
My chin. Which one?

344
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,888
Just... Right...

345
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,585
- That...
-Right there.

346
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:24,478
- I think I need a drink.
-I think I need one, too.

347
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:28,180
Wait, you're not an
alcoholic, are you?

348
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,759
- No. Why?
-Okay.

349
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,424
No, because
my last boyfriend was an alcoholic,

350
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,262
and I promised myself
I'd never date an addict again.

351
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:44,867
Well, I'm not an alcoholic.

352
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,207
Great.

353
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:58,610
So my son got really
upset the other day

354
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,749
'cause I told him he had to
stop playing and do his homework.

355
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,152
And I understand how he feels,

356
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:07,628
but I couldn't say to him,
like, you know, "Don't you think

357
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,691
"I'd rather be alone with ajar of blow
and a couple of transsexual hookers?"

358
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,062
Not that he would know...

359
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:20,268
I mean, he doesn't know
what the word "jar" means, but...

360
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,275
Neil.

361
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,552
Hey. Neil. Sex addict.

362
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:30,950
- Hi, Neil.
-Hi, Neil.

363
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,181
Hey.

364
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:38,458
I dreamed of being a doctor
since I was 10 years old.

365
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,594
It all started with ER.

366
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,999
I knew I could never be George Clooney,
but Anthony Edwards...

367
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:51,505
Bald, glasses, saving lives like
a superhero, that I could do.

368
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:59,577
So I worked nonstop for many years with
no social life, and I finally did it.

369
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,609
I became a doctor.

370
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,049
I was really good at it, too.

371
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:12,161
Until I got fired yesterday
for filming up my boss' skirt.

372
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,923
I told her it was for a documentary
called What the Ground Sees.

373
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,964
Oddly enough, she didn't buy it.

374
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,401
Stop fucking around, asshole!

375
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,811
It's not funny anymore, is it? Nope.

376
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,346
I've been lying about my day count
this entire time.

377
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,293
I've never actually
even gotten one day.

378
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,330
I can't lie anymore.

379
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,834
Not to you, not to myself.

380
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:01,975
So from now on, no more bullshit.

381
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,611
Just the truth.

382
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,145
And the truth is...

383
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,988
I'm out of control.

384
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,491
I'm scared.

385
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,763
And I need help.

386
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,670
I need help.

387
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,072
Okay, Neil, if we're gonna do this again,
then you gotta give me 150%.

388
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,133
Okay.

389
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,147
And since you're not working,
you have to do a 90 in 90.

390
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,444
- What is that?
-Ninety meetings in 90 days.

391
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,643
Okay.

392
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,117
- Call me every day.
-Fine.

393
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,585
You pray every day.

394
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,752
- I'm kind of an atheist.
-All right.

395
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,759
Okay! All right, fine.
Dude, I'll do whatever I gotta do.

396
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:51,883
Listen to me.

397
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,055
Higher power doesn't have to be some
old dude with a beard in the sky, okay?

398
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,894
It just has to be something
that's bigger than you.

399
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,363
I'm pretty big.

400
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,801
- And no more lame jokes, all right?
-Okay.

401
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,499
- Stop that shit.
-Okay.

402
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,801
No subway, no Internet.

403
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,174
- Are you fucking serious, dude?
-I am serious, are you?

404
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,507
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

405
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,012
- No. No worries.
-Not a problem.

406
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,710
- I can... I'll talk to you later.
-We'll talk and I'll... You can call me.

407
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:18,310
- That was a stupid share, dude.
-Thanks.

408
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,755
I love when people just bring it.

409
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,123
It was... You were, like,
an open wound out there.

410
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,891
It was... Your guts
were flopping out all over the place.

411
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:28,987
Thanks.

412
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,761
- That was some inspiring shit, yo.
-Yeah.

413
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:32,824
I'm Dede.

414
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,599
- I know who you are.
-Can I get your number?

415
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,369
My sponsor told me to get numbers, but
I'm not good at that reaching out shit.

416
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,534
It's...

417
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,710
- You ready?
-Yeah. Okay.

418
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,611
-6-4-6.
-Okay.

419
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,708
-5-5-5.
-Yeah.

420
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:52,050
<i>Zero-uno-cuatro-niner.</i>

421
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,558
646-555-0149.

422
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:00,721
Dude, you're a doorbell. Ding dong.

423
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:04,597
- I'm gonna call you.
-I'm gonna friggin' answer.

424
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,068
How's it going with the girl?

425
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,572
- Good. We had our first date.
-Nice.

426
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,197
Is she a friend of Bill?

427
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:16,370
No, she's a civilian. She's
great, she's funny, she's smart.

428
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,573
And you're a shallow prick,
so she must be gorgeous.

429
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:23,619
No, man, at this point in my sobriety, I
don't even notice the externals of a woman.

430
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,154
Yeah, fuck you, Deepak.

431
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,189
I'm just focused
right in on her heart and soul.

432
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,553
- Yeah, right.
-I swear.

433
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,648
Yeah.

434
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,285
You know if it keeps going well,
you got to tell her, right?

435
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,556
- Yeah.
-Full disclosure.

436
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,393
I'm a little worried about that.

437
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,263
Well, worry is just a
meditation on shit.

438
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,180
Good morning.

439
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,193
Morning.

440
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,789
So...

441
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,197
What the fuck, Danny?

442
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,158
Building you guys a koi pond.

443
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,334
Koi pond?

444
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,695
Yeah.

445
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,505
Thought it would go good with the whole,
you know, Zen vibe you guys got going on.

446
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:25,243
Just curious, you ever think about
running the idea by someone first?

447
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,977
Like, I don't know,
maybe the guy who owns the backyard?

448
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:31,086
Well, you know, I wanted
it to be a surprise.

449
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,886
It is.

450
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,151
- So fish go in there?
-Yeah.

451
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,060
- You know, koi, those big orange carp.
-I know what koi are.

452
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,896
So what happens in the winter when
they freeze their little koi nuts off?

453
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,706
No, look, I built one
for a guy in Michigan.

454
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,743
You just poke a hole in the ice.
It's no problem.

455
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:54,799
You sure about that?

456
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,041
Trust me.
You're gonna love it, Dad.

457
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,983
God.

458
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,480
Yeah, can I get someone to remove
this television from my room, please?

459
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:38,377
No, it's not broken.
I just don't want it here. Thanks.

460
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,092
Here you go.

461
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,825
- Did you block the...
-Yeah, boss.

462
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,663
You're all good. You're blocked.
So you want to go get dinner?

463
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,329
No, I've got to make a call.

464
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,370
<i>Nice flourish.</i>

465
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,073
Wait, what are you eating?

466
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,645
Just a little healthy
plate of veggies.

467
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,309
<i>- Hold up your plate again.
-What?</i>

468
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,975
I just want to see something.

469
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:17,589
Look at your cute little plate with
your vegetables all segregated and such.

470
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,891
<i>Yeah, I just don't think that
foods of different color should mix.</i>

471
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,525
Hey, I hear you. Separate
but equal. Plessy v. Ferguson.

472
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,233
God, I really like you.
And I don't like anybody.

473
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,001
I know, right?
I hate everyone except for you.

474
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,235
<i>Me, too.</i>

475
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,613
<i>I thought about you fast night.</i>

476
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:40,912
Yeah?

477
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:46,744
Actually, I thought
about you three times.

478
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,986
<i>Have you ever
"thought" about me?</i>

479
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,496
Hold on a second.

480
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,174
<i>Yeah. Hey, come on in.</i>

481
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,604
<i>I unplugged it already.</i>

482
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,414
<i>Okay. Sorry about that.</i>

483
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,579
Where did we leave off?

484
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,619
Are they taking the
TV out of your room?

485
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,988
<i>What?</i>

486
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,584
What are you, Amish?

487
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,724
<i>Yes, and I was hoping to escort you
to a barn raising upon my return.</i>

488
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:36,360
Oh, my God, seriously, why are
they taking the TV out of your room?

489
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,608
I just can't have it in my room.

490
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,403
<i>And why not?</i>

491
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,448
You...

492
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,118
You know when you don't
have control over something?

493
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:56,318
<i>No. I have control over
everything in my life.</i>

494
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,494
<i>I'm kidding. I'm sorry.
Go ahead.</i>

495
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:01,859
Well...

496
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,898
I just...

497
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,874
I can't have any distractions
on these business trips.

498
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,540
Like me?

499
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,843
No. Like TV.

500
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,080
Hey, what's going on?

501
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:31,555
Owner said my seams suck.
Been sanding this shit for two days.

502
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,554
Welcome to residential construction.

503
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,992
Hey, I'm not complaining though.

504
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:40,433
I mean, I know
you're taking a flyer on me and all.

505
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:46,873
No, seriously, I just want to say how much
I appreciate what you're doing for me.

506
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,604
Hey. United, we stand.
Divided, we stagger.

507
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,414
-It's just that...
-Hey, hey, hey.

508
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,214
Ever since I put the liquor down,

509
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,123
the slightest thing makes me start
crying like a little bitch.

510
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:07,025
I get these feelings
coming up inside of me, you know?

511
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,729
Feelings are like children.

512
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,360
You don't want them driving the car, but you
don't want to stuff them in the trunk, either.

513
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,903
Where do you get this shit?

514
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,235
Meetings.

515
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,735
Lots and lots and lots of meetings.

516
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,784
- Hey, Mom. I'm kind of busy right now.
-That's funny.

517
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:40,556
I wasn't too busy
to give birth to you 28 years ago.

518
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,296
I'm sorry. How are you?

519
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:46,392
So Judy Berger's son, Howard,
is doing his premed at Tufts,

520
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,529
<i>and he's thinking about
going into emergency medicine.</i>

521
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:54,133
<i>So I told her that you would take him around
one day next week, show him the ropes.</i>

522
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,542
- No! I can't.
-Why not?

523
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,412
We're gearing up for our yearly reviews.
It's just a really bad time.

524
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,475
- Yeah, but I promised her. I promised her.
<i>-Hang on, Mom.</i>

525
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,316
<i>- What? Code blue?
-She's counting on...</i>

526
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,982
Get him into trauma room three stat!
I'll be right there!

527
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,615
I gotta go, Mom!

528
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,860
Hold on.

529
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,093
Hey, Neil.

530
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,762
Where have you been, man?
Dude, I'm losing it.

531
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:55,997
What's happening?

532
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,064
Everything in this goddamn city
makes me want to act out.

533
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,135
- Get to a meeting.
-Yeah, I am, I am. I'm going right now.

534
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,440
Good.

535
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,607
Neil, how are you getting there?

536
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,660
That's good.

537
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,477
Good to see you, brother.

538
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,224
It's looking good.

539
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:05,830
Can I get you some iced tea?
Hungry?

540
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,005
Yeah. Tea sounds good.

541
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,738
David, what's up?

542
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:12,703
Oh, shit.

543
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,560
All right. Well, don't
get into it with him.

544
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:20,886
I'll be right there.
All right. I'm sorry. Okay.

545
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,249
Guy on the job just slipped.
I gotta go.

546
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,420
Come on, you guys are having fun.
Stay and finish.

547
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,464
It's all right, Ma.
If he's gotta go, he's gotta go.

548
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:31,027
He doesn't have to go.
He wants to go.

549
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:34,126
Don't make a thing of this, okay?

550
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,831
The guy's having a nervous breakdown.

551
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,939
You wanna go with me?

552
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,311
Chuck!

553
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,816
Put this down.
Put that down! Put that down!

554
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,754
Thinks he can talk to me like that?
Fuck you!

555
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:57,520
David, I'm sorry. He's off the job.
This is coming out of my pocket.

556
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,685
Yeah, no shit it will.

557
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,161
- You got a new window now, bitch!
-Okay. All right.

558
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,390
- Fuck you!
-Give me a hand here?

559
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,432
Look at me! Stop it!

560
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:06,897
Stop it!

561
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:11,130
Hey. Look at me. We're gonna go now.

562
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,233
You okay to go?

563
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,402
You okay to go?

564
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,877
Yeah.

565
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,314
All right, come on.

566
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,115
We're not gonna do anything stupid.
We're gonna walk out of here, okay?

567
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,176
Yeah.

568
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:29,952
All right? Look at me.
We're gonna do this, all right?

569
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,467
Now he's all right?

570
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,239
Yeah.

571
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,175
Sorry I've been a shitty son, Dad.

572
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:35,990
Sorry for all the lying
and the stealing...

573
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,292
The worry and all the bullshit.

574
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,389
I don't...

575
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:48,235
I don't want to disappoint you
anymore, Pop.

576
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,941
I want you to be proud of me.

577
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,014
Hey.

578
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,279
Jesus, you're beautiful.

579
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,222
What time is our reservation?

580
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,855
About a half an hour.

581
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,162
Plenty of time.

582
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,152
Yes, my tits are fake.

583
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,582
That's what happens
when your real ones try to kill you.

584
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,451
Is that what they mean
by a booby prize?

585
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,216
I have been wanting to do that
since the bug party.

586
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,149
Oh, God. Me, too.

587
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,320
I'm really sorry for my brevity.

588
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:20,817
-It's just been a really long time for me.
-Yeah, right.

589
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:25,560
A gorgeous, single hetero
with a job in Manhattan?

590
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:29,069
No, I'm serious.
It's been really long.

591
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,100
Hey.

592
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,372
Will you go with me?

593
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,169
Where?

594
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,239
You know, like, exclusively?
You and me?

595
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:44,747
Yeah.

596
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:46,379
Totally.

597
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:47,615
- Really?
-Yeah.

598
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,555
That's awesome.

599
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,487
No, our reservation.

600
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:56,622
It's fine. We still
have, like, 28 minutes.

601
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:57,089
Hey.

602
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,726
Is that a sobriety medallion?

603
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,810
Yeah.

604
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,752
I had been in recovery
for five years.

605
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,049
For what?

606
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:32,894
Sex addiction.

607
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,392
What?

608
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,668
I'm sorry. I know I should have told you.
I've been meaning to tell you for a long time.

609
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,328
Is that even a thing? Is that like...

610
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:46,033
Isn't that something that guys just say as
an excuse when they get caught cheating?

611
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:49,475
No. No. It's not an
excuse, it's a disease.

612
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:56,980
I don't understand
why you didn't just tell me.

613
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,383
I don't understand.

614
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,752
I told you right away
that I had had cancer.

615
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,815
- Why didn't you tell me?
-it's different. There's a stigma.

616
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,417
There's no stigma to cancer?

617
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:09,055
Cancer gets you sympathy.
My thing gets you judgment.

618
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,626
Okay, do you remember when on our
first date, when you said to me

619
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,466
that you couldn't date another addict
and you wouldn't date another addict?

620
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:20,931
So there I am, I'm having a great time
with a woman that I really like,

621
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,501
and I'm thinking, "Fuck!

622
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,907
"I don't want this to be over
before it even gets to be started."

623
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:30,844
Phoebe, I'm sorry.

624
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,910
I should have told you sooner.
I know I should have.

625
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:38,517
But I'm telling you now, and I promise you
from now on, it'll be full disclosure, okay?

626
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,420
I just...

627
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:50,404
I need some time to just
think about all this.

628
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,677
Okay, I understand.

629
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,985
Just get a pen, douchebag.

630
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:07,812
Just get a fucking pen
and a piece of paper.

631
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,586
Get a pen.

632
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:13,793
- Get a pen.
-This guy...

633
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,263
Hey, pal! Take it inside, will you?
We're trying to meditate here.

634
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,733
- Yeah? Fuck you!
-What'd you say?

635
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,703
Why don't you come over the fence?
I'll shove that fucking thing up your ass!

636
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,170
Take it inside!

637
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,274
What?

638
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:39,014
I was just remembering how when you were
a kid, you used to love to wrestle me.

639
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:40,817
Yeah.

640
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,517
Cute little honey badger
hanging on my leg.

641
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,558
You used to pin me in,
like, one move every damn time.

642
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:50,620
Yeah, I could probably
still do that.

643
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:53,531
Maybe... I don't know,
maybe take me two, three moves.

644
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,297
- Yeah? You think so? Two or three?
-You know, I'm...

645
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,963
- Well, I'm getting old. So...
-Yeah.

646
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,098
- I can't do the one anymore.
-Yeah, all right.

647
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,445
You motherfucker!

648
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,381
Shit! You're big!

649
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:13,710
Shit.

650
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,289
- You okay?
-Fuck.

651
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,358
- You all right?
-My God.

652
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,556
One! Two!

653
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,689
--Three!
-All right, all right, all right.

654
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,430
Winner and still champion!

655
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,631
You fucking sandbagged me.
That's bullshit.

656
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,571
I'm too fast. I'm too pretty.

657
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,938
All right, that's it. Round two, let's go.
You're going down, old man.

658
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,337
- Come on.
-Shit.

659
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,637
- You got a phone call.
-Yeah.

660
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,074
My sponsee.

661
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,315
Hey, Adam, what's up?

662
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,019
Let me go somewhere I can talk.

663
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,617
Rain check.

664
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:01,766
It's just all so fucking complicated,
man. I just... I really am feeling

665
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:05,431
like just grabbing a fuck-it bucket
and going down in a blaze of glory.

666
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,135
- You know what I'm saying?
-Hold on. Hold on.

667
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,036
Listen, Adam.

668
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:16,277
If I may, you have a slight tendency to
live in the, shall we say, extremes.

669
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:19,911
Look, life is gonna
throw shit at you.

670
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,479
There's gonna be disappointments,
betrayals,

671
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,684
and I know it hurts
like a back alley colonoscopy.

672
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,628
<i>But look, whether it's this
girl or the next girl,</i>

673
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:34,197
you need to find someone that accepts
the whole you, warts and all.

674
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:39,672
Listen, I gave Katie Hep C, and she
stuck it out with my sorry ass.

675
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:43,039
You really are a lucky son of a bitch.
You do know that, don't you?

676
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,109
I do know that.

677
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,307
And I'm grateful for it every day.

678
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,581
And you will be, too.

679
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,866
Yeah, hello?

680
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:52,778
Hey, Neil, it's Dede.
I met you the other day at the meeting.

681
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:56,013
<i>- Yeah. Hey, how...
-Can you talk? Is this a bad time?</i>

682
00:52:56,072 --> 00:53:00,953
No, no. Now's a good time.
What's going on?

683
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,855
My sponsor's not calling me back,
and I'm freaking the fuck out.

684
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,823
Okay, okay. Well, what's happening?

685
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:10,490
<i>My ex just called.
He wants me to come over.</i>

686
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:17,563
The guy is a total lying, toxic sack of
shit, but I really wanna go fuck him.

687
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:22,301
Well, you know, that's maybe not good.
That's not good, I think.

688
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,845
So let's just...

689
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,006
Let's talk this through.

690
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,374
All right, what would happen
if you went over there?

691
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,214
It would be a shit show.

692
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:35,518
Be specific now.
What would happen?

693
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:38,451
I'd get inside and he'd attack me.

694
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,892
Right. And after that?

695
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,896
<i>He'd rip my pants off
and start eating me out.</i>

696
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,363
- Wait. What? What?
<i>-'Cause that's his thing.</i>

697
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,297
I mean, the guy's,
like, a fucking pussy fanatic.

698
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:46,925
No, after that, skipping ahead.

699
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,501
We'd fuck like animals.

700
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,664
No, I'm talking after all of that,
after you finish.

701
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,298
How would you feel?

702
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,209
You mean, like, emotionally?

703
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:56,266
Yes.

704
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,303
I'd be all open and
vulnerable and shit,

705
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:02,179
and he'd be a million miles away,
back with his family.

706
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:03,810
And then?

707
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,614
Then I'd be so depressed,
I'd call up my guy.

708
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:07,978
And?

709
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,816
And a half hour later, I'm using.

710
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:16,093
- See where this goes?
-Yeah.

711
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,290
Good.

712
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,001
But I want to so bad.

713
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,161
No, Dede, don't.
Where are you?

714
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,497
Outside his place.

715
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:27,564
<i>- What? No!
-I can't help it.</i>

716
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,406
All right. Listen to me, okay?

717
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,742
I want you to turn around
and go someplace safe.

718
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,007
What's near you?

719
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,377
<i>- I don't know.
-Think!</i>

720
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,646
Okay, fuck! The salon where
I work is pretty close.

721
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:38,742
<i>Where is it?</i>

722
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:39,912
Tell me!

723
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:42,752
Damn, dude.
You just got all Jack Bauer on me.

724
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,121
Seriously?

725
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:55,063
You know what? Forget it.
I'm just gonna get out here.

726
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,435
Thank you. How much?
Yeah. Here you go.

727
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:41,311
- Hi. Can I help you?
-Dede. Where's Dede?

728
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,748
Do you have an appointment?

729
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,110
Holy shit, Neil.

730
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,513
- I made it.
-Are you okay?

731
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:50,080
- Lester hands paper.
-What?

732
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:56,192
You seem better.

733
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,263
Trade ya.

734
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:04,100
Sorry I went all Linda Blair on you.
Here you go. Thank you.

735
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,342
It's the least I can do.
You saved my ass.

736
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,875
Come on.
I'll give you a shave while you wait.

737
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:16,478
- Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

738
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,110
So, what are your, like,
you know, I don't know...

739
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,745
What's your big trigger?

740
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,050
I don't know.

741
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:26,492
For me, it's, like, when I'm sad,
I wanna have sex...

742
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:32,295
- So if you...
-Or if I'm happy, or tired, or bored.

743
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:36,432
- So pretty much just emotions?
-You get the point.

744
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:40,131
- What about you?
-Me, yeah, you know...

745
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:44,335
- I'd say my big thing is anxiety.
-Yeah, that's a big one.

746
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:48,076
Yeah, I'm pretty much anxious all
the time, so it's just, like...

747
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,977
Hey. What are you doing?

748
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,911
Am I making you anxious?

749
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,943
No, seriously, what
the fuck are you doing?

750
00:56:55,969 --> 00:56:56,710
Relax.

751
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,886
I'm about to give you
the best shave of your life.

752
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:02,657
- Please don't hurt me.
-Don't make me laugh.

753
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,495
You got a weapon to my throat.
Why would I do that?

754
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:13,174
You know, it's weird, but from the moment
you answered, I started to feel better.

755
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:15,686
Come on. Don't...

756
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:18,971
I'm completely serious.
I swear, it's true.

757
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:27,649
You know, when you called,
I was this close to losing my day count.

758
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,388
Really?

759
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:34,487
Sounds like we both had a God shot.

760
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:38,559
Yeah, you know, the whole higher power
thing kind of trips me up a little bit.

761
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,295
I mean, I don't know if I believe it.

762
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:46,698
You know, my sponsor tells me that it's just
gotta be about something bigger than me,

763
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:49,676
but I don't know what that means.

764
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,939
Well, don't over-think it.
It could be anything.

765
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:55,107
It's, like, service, like coming
here right now, helping me.

766
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:56,445
That's higher power.

767
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:06,049
You, like, literally
transplanted a baby's butt on my face.

768
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:09,187
That was so solid of you
to come all this way for me.

769
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:10,287
Thank you.

770
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,599
God. That's right.
I almost forgot.

771
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,829
I have to get home
without using the subway.

772
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:17,965
Why don't you just use my bike?

773
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:21,406
- No, I can't.
-It's okay. I have another one.

774
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,670
No, I mean, I literally can't.

775
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,409
I'm not a good rider of bikes.

776
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,162
- Hey, move your shit, fat girl.
-I'm a guy, asshole!

777
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,595
I'm a fat guy!

778
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:53,070
Yield, please.

779
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,506
Who lives like this?

780
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,406
Hey, sorry.

781
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:07,810
Hey. How's it going?

782
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:11,081
I'm gonna finish this
90 in 90 if it kills me.

783
00:59:11,107 --> 00:59:11,707
Good.

784
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:15,195
But just remember, one day at a time.

785
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,462
Biking now?

786
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:20,965
- Can't forget to tuck in the cuff, man.
-Yeah. Yeah, I know.

787
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:22,970
- That's a nice helmet you got there.
-Thank you. Appreciate it.

788
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:25,370
- What shade of pink is that again?
-I'm gonna get a new one, okay?

789
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,704
-It matches your shirt.
-Fuck you, dude.

790
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:30,244
You're the one who told me
I couldn't take the subway anymore,

791
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,544
so now I'm out there in the streets, biking
for my life like fuckin' <i>Il Postino.</i>

792
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,510
Okay. I'm sorry.

793
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,077
- Why are you riding me?
-I'm sorry.

794
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,384
I'm just... I'm going through
some stuff right now.

795
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:45,426
It's fine. I'm sorry.

796
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:48,291
I just haven't jerked
off in over a week.

797
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,888
You know, I just feel like
one giant blue ball right now.

798
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:51,955
Right.

799
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,405
Yo, two after.
Can we do this?

800
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:16,747
Okay, Adam, I'm gonna need, like, some
specifics here, so that I can understand.

801
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,419
You really wanna look
under that rock?

802
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,595
I mean, if we're gonna do this,
you know, I gotta know.

803
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:26,957
Oh, God...

804
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:32,331
Compulsive masturbation.

805
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:37,868
Hitting on every girl
that I come across.

806
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:41,246
Lots of one-night stands.

807
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:43,873
Juggling multiple girlfriends.

808
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,380
Prostitutes?

809
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:48,383
Prostitutes, yeah.

810
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,024
I'm sorry.

811
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:56,393
- It's hard for me to picture you like that.
-That's it. That's the disease.

812
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:02,429
It makes you do things that violate
everything that you believe in.

813
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,301
I wanted to stop so badly,
I can't tell you, but I couldn't.

814
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,901
I understand. I just...

815
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:14,308
The thing that scares
me, if I'm honest,

816
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:18,950
is how do you know
you're not gonna fall off the wagon?

817
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,247
All I can say to you is this.

818
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:26,125
I have been sober for five years.

819
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:29,220
It is the most important
thing in my life.

820
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,259
And I am not planning
to let anything fuck that up.

821
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:38,964
Okay.

822
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:48,540
I'm just gonna go in there, pick up
my laundry and tell her my truth.

823
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:50,543
Fuckin' A you are.

824
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:54,855
<i>- Thanks for bookending this with me, Dede.</i>
-Thanks for letting me be of service.

825
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,454
Now, go tell Mommy
you're a sex addict.

826
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,231
- Hi.
-Hi, Mom.

827
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,499
- Honey.
-Hey.

828
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,598
What's... Okay.

829
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:17,267
- Why are you so sweaty?
-I rode my bike here. Can I...

830
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,177
- Since when do you bike?
-Since yesterday...

831
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,806
Can I come in for a second?
Can we talk about something?

832
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:24,852
Yeah, sure. But I just need you
to change one light bulb first.

833
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:30,514
I mean, why should I even have this
big house if you're never gonna be home?

834
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,821
Okay, so, Mom, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

835
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,486
What's going on back here?

836
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,585
What?

837
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:39,758
All this sweat and schmutz
in your tuchus. What is it?

838
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:43,235
-It's from the bike seat.
-Well, I can't take it. It's disgusting.

839
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:44,293
Mom!

840
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,203
What? You're, like, a
homeless in these pants.

841
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,070
Okay, can you please just
listen to me for one second?

842
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:50,907
No. Take them off.
Just take them off.

843
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:56,709
Okay, take these off.
I'll wash 'em for you.

844
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:07,885
Okay, so it was one of those things where
you work out, and then you're perspiring,

845
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,726
and you take a shower,
but not for long enough, apparently.

846
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,528
'Cause I'm giving this presentation,

847
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:16,092
and I was, like,
schvitzing like a Russian gangster.

848
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,570
It was...

849
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,905
What?

850
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,571
Nothing.

851
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,269
This is nice.

852
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,850
- No PDA?
-No. Yes. Yes, on the PDA.

853
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,250
- Yes?
-Most definitely, yes.

854
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,982
Okay. Well, what about if I do this?

855
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,213
Yeah, always.

856
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,691
- Really?
-Yeah.

857
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:43,163
What if I just wanna
kind of upgrade it to, like...

858
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:44,823
- Yeah.
-Like a TMJ.

859
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,161
Yeah...

860
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:53,169
What if I... But what if I go like this?
Is that...

861
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:56,699
- Yeah, do that forever.
-Really?

862
01:03:56,766 --> 01:04:02,079
Even when I'm an old, stinking man
with claw-like, arthritic claw hands?

863
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:03,742
Will you love me then?

864
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,278
Adam.

865
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,117
You're killing me.

866
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,320
Hey.

867
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,294
Becky.

868
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,587
Yeah, I know.
I remember.

869
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:19,491
Oh, my God.

870
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,865
It's been years. How are you?

871
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,804
Do you still have
that great apartment downtown?

872
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,993
Yep. Still in the same place.
This is Phoebe.

873
01:04:29,019 --> 01:04:29,801
Hello.

874
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:35,009
- Have you seen his place?
-Yes, I have, and it is great.

875
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:41,046
Great. Good.
Good seeing you, Becky.

876
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,660
"Hint, hint, Becky, leave now."

877
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:55,234
It's nice to see you, too, Adam.

878
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,505
Here we are.

879
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,574
Make yourself at home.
I'm gonna go change.

880
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:29,662
Hey, baby.

881
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,140
You want a dance?

882
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,589
Yeah.

883
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,460
Hey, let's ease...

884
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,301
Just kiss me, okay?

885
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,370
You know the rules.

886
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,074
No touching.

887
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,247
Hey.

888
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,122
What's wrong?

889
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,023
Listen, I...

890
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,324
This is taking me to places
where I've been in the past,

891
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,891
where I just don't
wanna go right now.

892
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,464
I'm sorry.

893
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:42,669
It's all right. I know you...
I mean, you gotta be careful, I get that.

894
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:45,736
But, I mean, aren't we allowed
to be a little playful?

895
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:47,144
Absolutely.

896
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:52,911
Adam, I am a very sexual person,

897
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:56,548
and I'm gonna need to be able to
express that side of myself with you.

898
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:58,922
And I want you to, believe me.

899
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:02,485
I just would like to take it
a little bit more slowly.

900
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:05,063
Did Becky go slow?

901
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:00,219
Oh, shit!

902
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,251
- Yeah, it's looking good.
-Yeah.

903
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:06,884
Yeah, there it goes. Finish it up.

904
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:11,522
Hey, so you really want me there?
I mean, I can find somewhere else...

905
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,691
No, I want you to meet Adam.

906
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,792
He's a good guy.
He's got a good head. He's smart.

907
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,131
Smart? Like, I'm gonna
need a thesaurus to...

908
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:20,697
No, I'm just saying that
he's been through some hard times,

909
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,640
-and now he's doing great.
-Hard times.

910
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:24,735
And he's bringing his new lady friend over.
You'll like him.

911
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,838
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I get it. Positive role model.

912
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:32,352
Jesus, Danny, it's just dinner.
Just show up and eat the food.

913
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:35,655
God, this house is amazing.

914
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:39,215
I love all the woodwork and stuff.
It's so beautiful.

915
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:44,595
- When was the house built?
-1898.

916
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,391
I've been renovating it since then.

917
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:54,168
You've done a really great job.
It's very homey. It's nice.

918
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,437
- We like it.
-Thank you.

919
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:03,876
You know, let's start. It's, you
know, family style. Here we go.

920
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:09,385
That's... No, that's way too much for me.
Here, babe, let's...

921
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:14,053
- How much do you want?
-I'll just serve myself, it's fine. I just...

922
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:22,467
What are you, a smurf?

923
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:25,828
Here we go.

924
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:30,571
First off, you could not
pay me enough to do a triathlon.

925
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,306
Secondly, and furthermore,

926
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:36,507
I cannot believe you are voluntarily going
to swim in the Hudson fuckin' River.

927
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:39,985
- Mike.
-What? Honey, she's a big girl.

928
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:44,354
- Sorry about the language.
-That's okay. I accept your fucking apology.

929
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,658
Now you owe me an apology.

930
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:52,964
Sorry I'm late. There was
an accident on the BQE.

931
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:56,660
- The food was getting cold, so we started.
-I'll make you a plate.

932
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:58,261
That's all right.

933
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:01,701
Don't worry about it.
I'm not hungry anyway.

934
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:10,842
So Adam told me that you guys
were high school sweethearts.

935
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,146
Yeah.

936
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,447
God, we were stupid.

937
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:18,352
What?

938
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,690
I was just thinking about
what my life would've been like

939
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:23,025
if I had married my
high school sweetheart.

940
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,564
Scary, huh?

941
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,194
Horror movie scary.

942
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:33,205
Yeah, Mike and I, we just got lucky.

943
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:35,733
Lucky's good.

944
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:38,744
Well, you may be getting lucky.

945
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:42,312
Adam is a good guy.

946
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,882
Yeah, he is.

947
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:54,184
Hey.

948
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,456
What's wrong?

949
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:06,901
I just think I'm worried about
this whole addict thing, you know?

950
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,370
I mean, I just...

951
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:13,406
Do you ever worry
that you'll be just humming along,

952
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:17,076
and then he's just gonna
veer off back into the darkness?

953
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,083
In my experience,

954
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:25,082
the only way that I can do this
is just to keep the focus on myself.

955
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,056
Meaning?

956
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,127
Meaning...

957
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,131
What about my side of the street?

958
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:36,135
What are my issues that
I have to deal with?

959
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:40,470
After all, I picked an addict,
that says something.

960
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:49,639
Yeah, so, I mean, it's pretty
much self-sustaining, you know?

961
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:54,120
The fish, they do their thing
in the water, and that...

962
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,952
Yeah, and then the phytoplankton
eat the fish's waste,

963
01:11:57,012 --> 01:12:00,255
and then they create oxygen,
which the fish use,

964
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,920
so it's, like, a closed loop, right?

965
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,898
Yeah. Exactly.

966
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:07,560
Adam's an environmental wizard.

967
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:09,434
Is that right?

968
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,937
You know, I had a cell mate once
who thought he was a warlock.

969
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,438
So...

970
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,769
So nice job on the girl.

971
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,205
- I like her a lot.
-Yeah.

972
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:24,507
I really like her.
I think this might have legs.

973
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,244
Hey, listen, if it works out,
no one will be happier than me.

974
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:29,846
And if you don't make me the best man,
I will fuck up your wedding.

975
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:32,252
Mike, you're the best, man.

976
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,620
What are you saying?
I'm the best man, or I'm, like...

977
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:36,458
You're the best...

978
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:37,954
Man.

979
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,728
That's not a committal.
You're not committing.

980
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:42,359
- I will fuck up your wedding.
-You're the best man.

981
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:44,734
- I will fall into the wedding cake.
-You are the best, man.

982
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,467
I will be the one
that will not forever hold his peace.

983
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,438
Hey.

984
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:52,940
You think I could be your best man
when you two get married?

985
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:57,917
Nothing? All right.

986
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:17,097
A lot of smells going on in here.
You getting that?

987
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:21,201
It's like patchouli mixed
with BO and hugs.

988
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,833
Hey, Judgie Judgerstein,
I'm glad you could make it.

989
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:26,903
You know, I'm not really a
dancer so much as a walker.

990
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:30,507
- You gotta let your spontanuity go.
-I don't think that's actually a word.

991
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:31,949
Relax.

992
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,782
Ecstatic dancing is not
about looking good.

993
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:37,649
It's about getting in touch
with your higher power.

994
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,852
You're gonna make me find this higher
power even if it kills ya, huh?

995
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,954
Relax, babe.
Let your inhibitions run wild.

996
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:46,226
I don't think inhibitions can...

997
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,585
I like that Phoebe, babe.

998
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:19,427
And I like her for him.
I think they could make it.

999
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:22,430
What do you think?

1000
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,737
I'm not so sure.

1001
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:30,232
- What are you talking about?
-I don't know. I'm just not so sure.

1002
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,869
Are you kidding me?

1003
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,538
You didn't see
how they were looking at each other?

1004
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:38,745
That's the same kind of look we used to
give each other, like, 30 years ago.

1005
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:42,415
Have you seen my pain pills?

1006
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:44,914
They're not in the cabinet?

1007
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,789
No. Weird.

1008
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,859
I don't fuckin' believe it.

1009
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,831
Mike, you don't know that.

1010
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:03,208
Gotta tell you, Mike
really liked you.

1011
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,174
- Yeah?
-Yeah.

1012
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:08,939
Believe me, he's a hard sell.

1013
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,242
I'm glad I passed the test.

1014
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:15,148
Come on, I didn't mean it like that.

1015
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:17,550
What's the matter?

1016
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,457
Nothing.
I'm just cranky. I missed my run.

1017
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,325
I know that's your drug.

1018
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:24,589
What? Nothing.

1019
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:29,867
I know another way
to get endorphins going.

1020
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,201
God, I'm about to crash.

1021
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,765
I have a 7:30 breakfast.

1022
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:41,504
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

1023
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:45,548
You don't have to promise me sex.

1024
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:24,608
Sounds like you had
a really good time.

1025
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:30,748
You know, I don't know
if I could approve

1026
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:36,228
of you grinding up against
a bunch of sweaty undulating bodies.

1027
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,862
No, no, no, I'm in for the night.

1028
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:46,198
Maybe I could get away
for a few minutes tomorrow at lunch.

1029
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:48,465
Sounds like fun.

1030
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:51,770
Okay, good. Good night.

1031
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,743
Hey. Did I wake you up?

1032
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,847
Who was that?
Who are you talking to?

1033
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,250
What?

1034
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,879
- Who are you on the phone with?
-My sponsee.

1035
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,587
Really? At 2:00 in the morning?

1036
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,162
Yeah, he was calling to check in.

1037
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:14,091
Can I see your phone?

1038
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:15,928
Are you serious?

1039
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:20,997
- You don't want me to see your phone?
-No, and I resent you asking me to see it.

1040
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:23,576
Which makes me think
that you're hiding something.

1041
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:24,838
You know what, Phoebe?

1042
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,777
This isn't gonna work
without a little bit of trust.

1043
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:30,340
- Let me see your phone.
-No.

1044
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:31,849
- Give me your phone.
-No.

1045
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:33,215
- Just give me your phone.
-I'm not letting you...

1046
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:34,948
Just give me the fuckin' phone.

1047
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:42,523
Happy?

1048
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:49,067
- What's going on with you?
-What's going on with you, Adam?

1049
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:50,535
What is going on?

1050
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:54,001
I feel like you're starting
to pull away from me.

1051
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:55,900
I mean, am I crazy?

1052
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,876
Yeah, you're right, I know.

1053
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,681
So are you gonna
talk to me about it?

1054
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:06,211
Yeah.

1055
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:11,691
I guess, you know...

1056
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:17,597
For me, for so long,
you know,

1057
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:24,727
sex was, like, this secretive
chase for a fix, right?

1058
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:27,532
And now, with us,

1059
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:31,144
it's really hard for
me to connect that

1060
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:35,477
to something that's
loving and intimate and real.

1061
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:37,483
And it's not you.

1062
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,048
What?

1063
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,651
- What?
-I just don't...

1064
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,216
I don't know if I can do this.

1065
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,055
Why? Why not? What do you mean?

1066
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:49,354
We can do it.
We just have to do the work.

1067
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,761
Do the work? Adam, we just met.

1068
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:56,427
I mean, this is crazy.
We should be in the honeymoon phase.

1069
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:58,471
What do you mean honeymoon?
Where do you get that from?

1070
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:00,564
What, did you read that in a book?

1071
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,538
I think that I might...

1072
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:10,945
- What?
-Need someone who's healthier.

1073
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:12,815
- Healthier?
-Or not healthier, but...

1074
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:16,321
No. Because I'm sick,
and you, you're healthy

1075
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:21,123
with your compulsive exercising
and your crazy fucking food bullshit?

1076
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,155
I think you're a really
great guy, Adam.

1077
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:28,951
No, you think that I'm a sick 
piece of shit. But don't worry.

1078
01:20:28,977 --> 01:20:30,661
You, you're perfect, right?

1079
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:52,481
What's up?

1080
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,623
Honey, sit down.

1081
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,258
What happened?

1082
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:00,296
Did you take your mom's pain pills?

1083
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:04,103
- Did I what?
-Simple question.

1084
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:07,436
Did you go into our bathroom
and steal your mother's pills?

1085
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:10,040
No. I told you guys, I'm clean.

1086
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:13,341
Then what happened?
Did they just sprout wings and fly away?

1087
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:14,675
Mike, come on.

1088
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:18,607
I'm never gonna be anything
but a fuck-up to you, am I?

1089
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:20,710
Honey, we won't be mad.

1090
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,080
Give us the goddamn pills.

1091
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:25,556
What pills?

1092
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:28,458
You mean the pills she has to take
'cause of what you gave her?

1093
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:30,359
- Those pills?
-You watch your tone.

1094
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:32,193
What tone, huh? The
tone I learned from you

1095
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:35,030
when you used to come into my room
at night with your fuckin' Jameson's breath

1096
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,967
-and smack me around? That tone?
-What are you talking about?

1097
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:38,470
- Right, Ma?
-What are you talking about?

1098
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:39,766
Say something!

1099
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,271
Yeah, take his side
like you always fuckin' did.

1100
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:43,434
- Stop talking ancient history!
-That always fuckin' worked.

1101
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:46,741
- We're talking about right now.
-Good. Fine. Right now, I want an apology.

1102
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:48,041
- You want an apology?
-Yeah.

1103
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:51,141
You got some fuckin' stones, kid.
Apology for what?

1104
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,413
For accusing me
of something I didn't fuckin' do!

1105
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,421
- Are you kidding me?
-Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

1106
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:59,914
That's right, 'cause that would mean
admitting that you're wrong, wouldn't it?

1107
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:01,289
Big Mike's never wrong.

1108
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:04,796
- What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about you, Mr. 12-Step.

1109
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:06,730
You can go pretend that
you're Mr. Recovery

1110
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:10,098
to all your sponsees who think
you're Jesus fucking Christ.

1111
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:11,761
Guess what, Dad?

1112
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:14,932
I know the truth about you.
You were a monster then.

1113
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:18,637
You're a goddamn hypocrite now,
telling them to go make amends.

1114
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,873
You've never even
made amends to your own son

1115
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,542
for all the shit that you did to me,
all the shit that you put me through.

1116
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:24,845
Yes, I did, I did.

1117
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:27,216
You did? When did you ever
make an amends to me?

1118
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:28,879
- When?

1119
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:32,854
That's right, never.
You never did. You can start right now.

1120
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:36,588
- Dad, say you're sorry to me.
-I'm not saying I'm sorry to you.

1121
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:40,423
- Say you're sorry to me.
-I am not saying I'm sorry to you.

1122
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:43,332
- Say you're fucking sorry to me!
-I am not saying I'm sorry to you!

1123
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,735
That's right, 'cause you're
a fuckin' coward!

1124
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:51,443
Stop it!

1125
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:56,711
Stop it! Stop it!

1126
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:16,218
Hey, Mike, it's Adam.

1127
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:20,323
Yeah, I'm in DC
for this postal service meeting,

1128
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,560
and I'm not doing so good, man.

1129
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,828
Yeah, it's over with Phoebe.

1130
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:30,502
And I'm having some really
dark thoughts here, brother.

1131
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:33,469
So, can you give me a call
when you get this, please?

1132
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:35,071
Okay, thanks, man. Bye.

1133
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:39,243
Come on, come on.

1134
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,154
Hey, Margo. Hey, it's Adam.

1135
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:43,780
How you doing?

1136
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:45,051
I'm great.

1137
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:49,323
Hey, listen. Do you think I could
swing by there and grab the computer?

1138
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:51,921
There's a couple edits
I wanna make on the...

1139
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:57,897
You know what? I'm fine. Let's just...
We'll bang it out in the morning.

1140
01:24:57,959 --> 01:24:59,996
Okay, good night. Thanks, bye.

1141
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:02,537
Fucking idiot.

1142
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:35,000
Yeah.

1143
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:38,210
Yeah.

1144
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:22,414
Adam?

1145
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:32,556
Yeah, slow.

1146
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:34,628
Yeah, slow.

1147
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:58,388
- Hey.
-Hi, baby.

1148
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,982
I am so happy to see you.

1149
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:03,719
Thanks for coming.
I was seriously bugging out.

1150
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:06,924
Jesus. There's more
shit than air in here.

1151
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:08,190
Yeah, I know.

1152
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:11,634
You gotta do something about this, dude.
This is not conclusive to your sobriety.

1153
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:14,105
- I think you mean conducive.
-You got any garbage bags?

1154
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:17,237
Yes. Yes, I do. Hang on.

1155
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:29,248
Dude, explain this to me.

1156
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:32,454
You're trying to stay sober and you
still have your porn collection?

1157
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:36,427
Yeah, I'm really just stashing it up here.
I don't actually watch any of it anymore.

1158
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,861
- We need to get rid of this.
-I know.

1159
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,059
No. We need to get rid of this now.

1160
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:03,151
You okay with this?

1161
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:06,021
It's like burying an old friend.

1162
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,803
<i>Burning porn, My Lord</i>

1163
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,836
<i>Kumbaya</i>

1164
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:24,137
Really?

1165
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:26,374
<i>Neil's shit's burning, My Lord</i>

1166
01:28:26,434 --> 01:28:27,708
Okay.

1167
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,843
<i>Kumbaya</i>

1168
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:36,384
<i>How am I gonna jack
off now, My Lord?</i>

1169
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:39,149
<i>Kumbaya</i>

1170
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:44,291
<i>Oh, Lord, Kumbaya</i>

1171
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:47,463
You were a little high.

1172
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:51,435
What's wrong?

1173
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:57,041
I've never been just friends
with a guy before.

1174
01:28:57,198 --> 01:28:58,472
It's so...

1175
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,279
What?

1176
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:02,876
Hot.

1177
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:08,945
I love you, big man.

1178
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:12,253
I love you, too, small
tattooed woman.

1179
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:42,945
I fucked up.

1180
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:58,766
You always have to be right,
don't you, Mike?

1181
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:00,999
- Always.
-Really? You gonna start this?

1182
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:02,735
Just get out.

1183
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:11,246
Fuck it. I'm gonna go.

1184
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,790
Danny, come on, call us.

1185
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,217
Your mom is worried.

1186
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:24,723
Really? Really?

1187
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:02,734
Hey, it's Adam.

1188
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:05,433
You wanna come by?

1189
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:23,022
Give me a five scratches.

1190
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:31,694
3 Musketeers bar.

1191
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:36,391
Is that it?

1192
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:40,636
Yeah. Let me have...

1193
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,704
A bottle of bourbon,
fifth of bourbon.

1194
01:31:46,734 --> 01:31:47,906
Yeah.

1195
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,437
Hey.

1196
01:32:15,596 --> 01:32:17,041
What happened?

1197
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:18,505
Where is he?

1198
01:32:18,566 --> 01:32:20,170
Katie, breathe.

1199
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:37,653
<i>And then at the last minute, this guy just,
like, jumps in front of me and takes my cab.</i>

1200
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:38,788
<i>I go down to the subway.</i>

1201
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:40,799
<i>I'm waiting for the subway for,
like, 20 minutes.</i>

1202
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:45,167
<i>I get on, and after two stops, they stop it,
and they say it's 'cause of a sick passenger.</i>

1203
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:48,833
Like, how much of a diva do you
have to be to stop a whole train?

1204
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:51,103
The gumption, it's crazy.

1205
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:54,406
I remember this place.

1206
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:57,347
Oh, my God. I love this rug.

1207
01:32:57,872 --> 01:32:59,852
Are you sure you're not gay?

1208
01:33:00,508 --> 01:33:01,953
Pretty sure.

1209
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:05,616
Okay.

1210
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,818
Give it a second.

1211
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:09,885
- You're so fucking hot.
-Thank you.

1212
01:33:10,785 --> 01:33:12,264
Time out.

1213
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,856
Why don't you
make me a drink or something?

1214
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:17,926
Of course. I'm sorry. How rude of me.
What would the lady like?

1215
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:22,065
The lady would like a glass of red
wine if the gentleman has one.

1216
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:23,767
The lady's in luck.

1217
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:30,709
I was so surprised
when you called me.

1218
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,976
It's been a very long time.

1219
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:36,043
I'm glad you picked up.

1220
01:33:38,412 --> 01:33:41,393
So what was the deal
with that girl?

1221
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,156
Is she your girlfriend?

1222
01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:45,561
Yeah, that's pretty much over.

1223
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:50,101
Well, I'm glad you called.

1224
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:55,198
Gives me an excuse to wear this
brand-new little dress I bought.

1225
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:56,934
I know.

1226
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:00,473
Yeah, I love this dress.

1227
01:34:00,935 --> 01:34:02,243
Yeah.

1228
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,481
You don't think it's too short?

1229
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:07,452
Not at all.

1230
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:09,617
Really?

1231
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:15,988
You don't think it's,
like, a little naughty?

1232
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:18,953
I don't know.

1233
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:22,697
I do.

1234
01:34:25,459 --> 01:34:30,340
I don't think I should be allowed
to go out like this, right?

1235
01:34:33,234 --> 01:34:35,339
No, you shouldn't.

1236
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:37,110
Go on.

1237
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:38,616
Go change your dress.

1238
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,815
But I don't wanna change.

1239
01:34:41,776 --> 01:34:45,588
Becky, did you hear me?
I told you to go change, now.

1240
01:34:45,646 --> 01:34:48,252
- Or what?
-Becky, I said change your dress.

1241
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:49,851
Fuck you. I'm not a child anymore.

1242
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:53,091
Hey, this is my house.
You're ruled by my rules.

1243
01:34:53,154 --> 01:34:55,225
Daddy, stop it! You're hurting me.

1244
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:57,769
Becky, you gonna change your dress?

1245
01:34:57,825 --> 01:34:58,929
No.

1246
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:02,670
You wanna be a big girl?
Fine. I'll treat you like a big girl.

1247
01:35:03,564 --> 01:35:05,601
- No, Daddy!
-Yeah.

1248
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:07,577
- What are you doing? Stop.
-Yeah.

1249
01:35:07,635 --> 01:35:09,444
You want me to stop, huh?

1250
01:35:09,503 --> 01:35:13,110
Just say it. I'll stop.
Go ahead, tell me to stop.

1251
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:16,920
Fuck me.

1252
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:29,331
Yeah.

1253
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:31,594
Okay, now.

1254
01:35:33,294 --> 01:35:35,797
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1255
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:38,002
Come on, slap me.

1256
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:41,244
I'm not gonna slap you.

1257
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:44,544
- Fuckin' slap me.
-I said I'm not gonna slap you.

1258
01:35:44,605 --> 01:35:46,050
Come on, fuckin' slap me,
you fucking pussy.

1259
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:48,451
I'm not into that.
I'm not into that.

1260
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:50,918
Okay?

1261
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:52,418
Becky.

1262
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,824
- Fuckin' slap me. Come on!
-Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

1263
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:56,418
- You know you want to. Fuckin' slap me!
-Hey, hey.

1264
01:35:56,484 --> 01:35:58,020
- Come on, fuckin' slap me!
-Hey!

1265
01:35:58,085 --> 01:36:00,929
Fuckin' slap me!
Come on, fuckin' slap me!

1266
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:02,399
- Listen to me.
-Fuckin' slap me!

1267
01:36:02,456 --> 01:36:03,764
- Stop it.
-Fuckin' slap me!

1268
01:36:03,824 --> 01:36:05,428
- Hey, hey.
-Fuckin' slap me!

1269
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:07,097
Stop, stop.

1270
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:09,770
Stop.

1271
01:36:14,068 --> 01:36:15,376
Stop.

1272
01:36:18,906 --> 01:36:20,317
It's okay.

1273
01:36:20,808 --> 01:36:22,048
All right?

1274
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:24,089
- Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

1275
01:36:25,146 --> 01:36:26,887
- Come on, talk to me.
-Don't touch me!

1276
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:34,065
- Hey, I...
-Don't fucking touch me!

1277
01:36:40,761 --> 01:36:43,435
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

1278
01:36:45,366 --> 01:36:46,936
Jesus Christ.

1279
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:48,173
Becky?

1280
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:50,711
Hey, Becky.

1281
01:36:54,508 --> 01:36:57,546
It's all right. It's okay.
It's okay.

1282
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:00,619
Get away from me!

1283
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:08,861
What?

1284
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:11,497
Becky, hey.

1285
01:37:12,092 --> 01:37:13,571
Becky, come on.

1286
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,368
Get away from me!

1287
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:19,275
Open the door, okay?
Come on. Come on out of there.

1288
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:21,579
Fuck.

1289
01:37:21,635 --> 01:37:23,637
Hey, come on.
Talk to me.

1290
01:37:23,938 --> 01:37:26,282
Get away from me!

1291
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:30,550
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing in there?
What are you doing in there?

1292
01:37:30,611 --> 01:37:32,113
Hey, hey!

1293
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:36,158
You know what? Becky, 
this isn't funny. Come on now.

1294
01:37:38,919 --> 01:37:41,627
I can't take it.

1295
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:50,266
Mike, I need your help.
Call me ASAP, man, seriously.

1296
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:03,253
Dude, where have you been?
I've been trying to call you.

1297
01:38:05,246 --> 01:38:06,452
Who?

1298
01:38:07,414 --> 01:38:08,757
What girl?

1299
01:38:10,618 --> 01:38:12,620
All right. Text me
your address. I'm on my way.

1300
01:38:17,157 --> 01:38:18,397
No!

1301
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:21,370
Fuckin' animals!

1302
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:24,604
You see who did this?

1303
01:38:25,366 --> 01:38:26,367
Fuck!

1304
01:39:13,547 --> 01:39:14,617
- Dude.
-Hey.

1305
01:39:14,682 --> 01:39:15,717
Where is she?

1306
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:19,424
Right here, in the bathroom.
She's right there on the left.

1307
01:39:19,553 --> 01:39:20,657
- Hey...
-Becky.

1308
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:23,292
Becky, listen. My name is Neil.
I'm friends with Adam.

1309
01:39:23,357 --> 01:39:25,268
We're worried about you, sweetie.
How about you open the door?

1310
01:39:28,862 --> 01:39:30,307
Becky! Hey!

1311
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:32,772
Becky!

1312
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:35,311
- Adam, move!
-Shit!

1313
01:39:38,572 --> 01:39:39,915
- Becky. Come on.
-No.

1314
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:41,247
Talk to me, sweetie.

1315
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:44,721
Come on. You talk to me here.

1316
01:39:44,778 --> 01:39:45,848
Call 9-1-1.

1317
01:39:47,414 --> 01:39:48,950
Adam, 9-1-1!

1318
01:39:54,722 --> 01:39:59,728
Yeah, we need an ambulance quick
at 135 West 3rd Street, apartment 2B.

1319
01:39:59,793 --> 01:40:02,171
Young female,
polysubstance overdose.

1320
01:40:02,363 --> 01:40:06,436
- Did you get that? Okay. Please hurry.
-Stay with me, Becky.

1321
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:09,175
Oh, man.

1322
01:40:09,803 --> 01:40:12,113
Dude, it's all right.
She's gonna be okay.

1323
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:24,324
Dude, you really are
Anthony Edwards.

1324
01:40:25,552 --> 01:40:27,122
Fuck that.

1325
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:29,162
I'm George Clooney.

1326
01:40:35,295 --> 01:40:39,334
We're looking for our son, Danny Burns.
We've heard he's on the fifth floor.

1327
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:47,352
Baby.

1328
01:40:55,315 --> 01:40:56,919
Are you okay?

1329
01:40:57,017 --> 01:41:00,055
Yeah, I'm fine, Ma.
Are you all right?

1330
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,622
Yeah, I'm...

1331
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:03,827
Are you in pain?

1332
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:05,432
No.

1333
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:08,634
They got me on the good stuff.

1334
01:41:11,331 --> 01:41:13,436
I didn't even have to steal it.

1335
01:41:15,202 --> 01:41:18,411
We know that you
didn't take the pills.

1336
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:21,181
Right, Mike?

1337
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:24,952
Will you tell him?

1338
01:41:26,847 --> 01:41:28,554
Fuckin' hysterical.

1339
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:33,498
First drink or drug in
eight months.

1340
01:41:33,754 --> 01:41:36,530
I total the car.
I get arrested for DUI.

1341
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,570
You must be fuckin' loving this.

1342
01:41:44,731 --> 01:41:46,074
Look at you.

1343
01:41:47,634 --> 01:41:49,580
What's on your mind, Pop?

1344
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,680
Why don't you tell me?

1345
01:41:54,341 --> 01:41:57,447
Tell me this is what I get
for white-knuckling it.

1346
01:42:12,059 --> 01:42:13,561
I'm sorry.

1347
01:42:14,862 --> 01:42:16,500
I'm so sorry.

1348
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:19,971
I'm sorry.

1349
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,148
Thanks for meeting me.
It's really good to see you.

1350
01:42:56,203 --> 01:42:57,773
Yeah, you, too.

1351
01:42:57,938 --> 01:43:03,320
I thought a lot about what happened,
and I wanted to clear the air between us.

1352
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:12,491
I just wanna say that I really regret some
of the things I said to you that night.

1353
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:15,532
I'm sorry.

1354
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:17,533
I'm not.

1355
01:43:18,292 --> 01:43:20,363
It was good. I...

1356
01:43:20,427 --> 01:43:23,704
You forced me to look at myself.
I needed to hear it.

1357
01:43:24,765 --> 01:43:26,403
How'd that go?

1358
01:43:26,833 --> 01:43:29,404
Not so good, yeah.

1359
01:43:29,636 --> 01:43:32,583
Turns out, I'm not perfect.

1360
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:36,019
No, but you're pretty
fuckin' awesome.

1361
01:43:39,446 --> 01:43:42,620
Oh, God. It's not fair, you know?

1362
01:43:43,283 --> 01:43:44,728
What?

1363
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:48,860
I still hate everybody but you.

1364
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:15,992
I'm gonna ask you to sit
and listen to me for one second.

1365
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:20,425
Things are going to
change between us.

1366
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:26,033
From now on, I'm going to be a son.

1367
01:44:27,127 --> 01:44:31,371
I should do something for myself
to show that I love myself.

1368
01:44:31,732 --> 01:44:36,203
Give me the most damaged guy you could
find and I was, like, in heaven.

1369
01:44:36,603 --> 01:44:39,846
I'm halfway through
my ninth step list.

1370
01:44:39,906 --> 01:44:42,113
Just did my first wife.

1371
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:43,745
That was fun.

1372
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:47,251
I miss acting out.

1373
01:44:47,848 --> 01:44:49,953
I do, I'm serious.

1374
01:44:50,217 --> 01:44:53,221
This disease won't let
me take a compliment

1375
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:59,393
unless it comes from, like, I don't 
know, a muscley, tattooed Latino man.

1376
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:03,506
My wife would ask where I was, and I
would say I was at meetings at work,

1377
01:45:03,563 --> 01:45:05,634
and I led a double
life for a long time.

1378
01:45:05,932 --> 01:45:07,434
There are keep-coming-back chips

1379
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:11,415
for newcomers and members wishing to
reaffirm their commitment to sobriety.

1380
01:45:11,672 --> 01:45:14,778
Is anyone celebrating 30 days?

1381
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:54,719
You're welcome.
