00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:33,501
I KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY

17

SOME SIGNS UP SAYING,

OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TAPING THIS.

A LOT OF FLASHING,

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,634
BE A LITTLE DISTRACTING

ON THE PERFORMANCE.

32
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:49,400

33
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:49,400
PEOPLE DON'T GIVE A SHIT,

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,434

132
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,567
AND SURE, THAT'S A LITTLE BIT

133
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,567
OF AN EXAGGERATION,

134
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,334
BUT THAT IS

135
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,334
HOW IT FEELS SOMETIMES.

136
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:21,734
I ONCE WENT UP

137
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:21,734
TO THIS GIRL

138
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:23,868
'CAUSE I THOUGHT SHE HAD

139
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:23,868
A COOL PURSE ON HER SHOULDER.

140
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:25,534
I SAID,

141
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:25,534
"HEY, THAT'S A NICE BAG."

142
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:27,300
AND SHE SAID, "THANK YOU,"

143
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:27,300
AND WE STARTED TALKING,

144
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,601
AND SHE SEEMED NICE.

145
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,334
THEN AT ONE POINT,

146
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,334
HER FRIEND COMES OVER,

147
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,868
AND WHEN THE GIRL'S FRIEND

148
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,868
COMES OVER, SHE GOES,

149
00:04:31,868 --> 00:04:33,634
"OH, HEY. THIS IS AZIZ.

150
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:36,234
HE CAME TO TALK TO ME 'CAUSE

151
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:36,234
HE THOUGHT I HAD A COOL BAG."

152
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,434
AND ROLLED HER EYES.

153
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:39,801
AND I THOUGHT,

154
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:39,801
"WOW, THAT'S REALLY RUDE.

155
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,834
NO REASON TO DO THAT.

156
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,834
I WAS JUST BEING NICE," RIGHT?

157
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,167
SO, I SAID TO MYSELF

158
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,167
RIGHT THERE,

159
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,901
"WHENEVER I LEAVE

160
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,901
THIS CONVERSATION,

161
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,868
"I'M GONNA MAKE SURE

162
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,868
THIS GIRL KNOWS

163
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:49,801
"I DON'T GIVE A SHIT

164
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:49,801
ABOUT HER,

165
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:54,801
AND I REALLY

166
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:54,801
LIKE HER BAG."

167
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:56,400
SO, AT ONE POINT, WE'RE SITTING

168
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:56,400
THERE TALKING, AND I WAS LIKE,

169
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,968
"YEAH..."

170
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,968
[feigns laughter]

171
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:59,067
"HEY, WHAT'S THAT

172
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:59,067
OVER THERE?"

173
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,868
AND THEN I STOLE HER PURSE.

174
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:06,567
YEAH.

175
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:06,567
THAT BAG'S MINE NOW.

176
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,467
I NEVER KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO

177
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,467
GIRLS IN SITUATIONS LIKE THAT.

178
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:12,734
IT'S ALWAYS SO AWKWARD.

179
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:14,467
I WAS HAVING LUNCH

180
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:14,467
WITH A FRIEND OF MINE ONCE,

181
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:16,267
AND I TOLD HIM,

182
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:16,267
"HEY, THERE'S THIS ONE GIRL

183
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,734
"THAT WORKS

184
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,734
IN THIS RESTAURANT.

185
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,934
SHE'S SO CUTE, BUT I DON'T

186
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,934
KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HER."

187
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,634
AND HE GOES,

188
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,634
"OH, MAN, ALL YOU GOTTA DO

189
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:24,167
IS GO OVER THERE AND BE HONEST

190
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:24,167
WITH HER FOR A MINUTE."

191
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,434
REALLY?

192
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,434
THAT'S ALL I GOTTA DO?

193
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:28,901
SO, I JUST NEED TO WALK OVER--

194
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:28,901
"EXCUSE ME, MISS.

195
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,434
"I JUST NEED TO BE REAL HONEST

196
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,434
WITH YOU FOR A MINUTE.

197
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,834
"I EAT HERE ALL THE TIME,

198
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,834
AND WHEN I DO,

199
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,968
"I STARE AT YOUR FACE.

200
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:42,000
"AND I IMAGINE US FUCKING

201
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:42,000
WHILE I EAT MY SANDWICHES.

202
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,133
"LET ME KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE

203
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:46,334
TO TURN MY FANTASY

204
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:46,334
INTO YOUR REALITY."

205
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:50,234
I'M NOT SURE THAT WOULD

206
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:50,234
WORK OUT TOO WELL.

207
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:52,033
PEOPLE ALWAYS GIVE YOU

208
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:52,033
THE SAME DUMB ADVICE

209
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,701
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THAT.

210
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,968
THEY'LL SAY THINGS LIKE,

211
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,968
"OH, JUST LEAVE HER A BIG TIP."

212
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:57,434
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

213
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:57,434
I JUST WALK OVER--

214
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:59,601
"YES, CAN I

215
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:59,601
GET A MUFFIN, PLEASE?

216
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,300
"HERE'S $100.

217
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,534
"I THINK YOU KNOW

218
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,534
WHAT THAT MEANS.

219
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:08,834
I'M WILLING TO HAVE SEX

220
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:08,834
WITH YOU FOR THE PRICE OF $98."

221
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,634
I WAS DOING

222
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,634
THAT JOKE ONE NIGHT,

223
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:15,701
AND THIS GUY

224
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:15,701
IN THE AUDIENCE JUST YELLS,

225
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:17,901
"JUST TELL HER

226
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:17,901
YOU'RE ON TV!"

227
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:20,000
YEAH. THERE'S NO WAY

228
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:20,000
I'LL SOUND LIKE A JERK

229
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,067
IF I DO THAT, RIGHT?

230
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:26,000
"EXCUSE ME, MISS.

231
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:26,000
I'M ON TV."

232
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,400
[clears throat]

233
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,400
"I SAID...

234
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,200
"I'M ON TV.

235
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,734
"I DON'T KNOW

236
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,734
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

237
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:37,334
BUT THIS IS THE PART WHERE

238
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:37,334
YOU START SUCKING MY DICK."

239
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,133
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT SOME DUDES

240
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,133
THINK BEING ON TV'S LIKE.

241
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,334
I JUST WALK INTO BARS...

242
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:47,133
"WHAT'S UP, EVERYBODY?

243
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:47,133
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

244
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,334
"SOMEONE THAT'S APPEARED

245
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,334
ON TELEVISION IS HERE.

246
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:51,000
"SO, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED

247
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:51,000
IN GIVING ME A HANDJOB

248
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,334
IN THE RESTROOM,

249
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,334
LET'S LINE UP TO THE LEFT."

250
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,667
NO. THAT'S NOT

251
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,667
HOW IT WORKS AT ALL.

252
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,167
HOW IT WORKS

253
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,167
IS I WALK INTO A BAR,

254
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,434
AND FIVE DUDES ARE LIKE,

255
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:03,400
"OH, MAN, IT'S THAT BROWN GUY

256
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:03,400
I SAW ON THAT THING!"

257
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,000
[whining groan]

258
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,567
"OH, MAN, OH, MAN, BRO,

259
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,567
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE!

260
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,467
"YOU GOTTA TAKE A PHOTO

261
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,467
WITH ME AND MY PUPPY.

262
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,033
"MY PUPPY'S

263
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,033
BACK AT MY HOUSE, THOUGH.

264
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:15,801
WE GOTTA DRIVE THERE.

265
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:15,801
NOW."

266
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:18,367
THAT DOESN'T SOUND SAFE.

267
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,501
I WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP

268
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,501
FOR A FEW YEARS,

269
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:25,501
AND I THINK IN THE TIME

270
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:25,501
I WAS IN THE RELATIONSHIP,

271
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:29,434
ALL DATING COMMUNICATION

272
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:29,434
WENT EXCLUSIVELY TO TEXT.

273
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:30,667
YOU CAN'T CALL

274
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:30,667
ANYBODY ANYMORE.

275
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,834
IF YOU CALL SOMEONE,

276
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,834
THEY'RE LIKE,

277
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,467
"WHAT? ARE YOU ON FIRE?

278
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:38,067
THEN QUIT WASTING MY TIME.

279
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:38,067
TEXT ME THAT SHIT."

280
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,133
AND I DON'T LIKE TEXTING PEOPLE.

281
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,133
ESPECIALLY GIRLS.

282
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,267
THERE'S ALWAYS MISCOMMUNICATION

283
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,267
THAT HAPPENS.

284
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,167
THIS IS A SITUATION

285
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,167
I GET INTO ALL THE TIME.

286
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:46,367
I'LL TEXT A GIRL,

287
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:46,367
SHE TEXTS ME BACK RIGHT AWAY.

288
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,434
I TEXT HER BACK RIGHT AWAY,

289
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,434
SHE TEXTS ME BACK RIGHT AWAY,

290
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,634
I TEXT HER BACK RIGHT AWAY,

291
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,634
SHE TEXTS ME BACK RIGHT AWAY,

292
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,200
I TEXT HER BACK RIGHT AWAY,

293
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,200
SHE TEXTS ME BACK RIGHT AWAY.

294
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,567
THEN I'LL SAY

295
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,567
SOMETHING LIKE,

296
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:57,000
"ALL RIGHT, COOL, SO YOU WANNA

297
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:57,000
GET PIZZA ON TUESDAY?"

298
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,100
AND THEN I DON'T

299
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,100
HEAR ANYTHING.

300
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,501
AND I'M LIKE,

301
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,501
"WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

302
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:03,200
"I KNOW YOU READ THAT SHIT.

303
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,000
"YOU RESPONDED TO 20 OTHER

304
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,000
THINGS I JUST SAID.

305
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,601
"WHAT, DO YOU

306
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,601
NOT LIKE ME ANYMORE?

307
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:08,167
"YOU DON'T HAVE TWO SECONDS TO

308
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:08,167
SAY, 'YES, I WANT TO GET PIZZA''

309
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,901
"OR, 'NO, I DON'T

310
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,901
WANT TO GET PIZZA'?

311
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,367
"WHAT, DID YOU CHECK

312
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,367
YOUR PHONE INTO A LOCKER

313
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,100
"AND GO RIDE A ROLLER COASTER

314
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,100
FOR A FEW HOURS?

315
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,501
WHAT'S THE DEAL?"

316
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:20,934
AND AFTER A FEW HOURS OF

317
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:20,934
NO RESPONSE, I GET REAL UPSET.

318
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,868
AND I JUST WANT TO SEND A TEXT

319
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,868
THAT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE,

320
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:26,601
"WELL, GUESS WHO JUST GOT

321
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:26,601
UNINVITED TO THE PIZZA PARTY.

322
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:29,868
YOU DID,

323
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:29,868
'CAUSE I HATE YOU NOW."

324
00:08:29,868 --> 00:08:31,300
GIRL ALWAYS WRITES

325
00:08:29,868 --> 00:08:31,300
SOMETHING BACK.

326
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,300
"SORRY, I WAS AT MY NIECE'S

327
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,300
BALLET RECITAL.

328
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,667
WE HAD TO TURN OFF

329
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,667
OUR PHONES."

330
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:37,133
"WHATEVER. WE'RE DONE.

331
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:37,133
I FINISHED THAT PIZZA HOURS AGO.

332
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:40,033
I WENT WITH MY FRIEND BRIAN.

333
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:40,033
HE'S NICE TO ME."

334
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:45,367
I WENT OUT WITH THIS GIRL

335
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:45,367
IN L.A. A FEW TIMES.

336
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:46,634
SHE WAS REALLY NICE.

337
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:48,801
AND LAST TIME I WAS IN L.A.,

338
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:48,801
I CALLED HER UP

339
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:49,968
AND ASKED HER OUT

340
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:49,968
FOR DINNER.

341
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:51,701
AND SHE WAS LIKE,

342
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:51,701
"YEAH, SURE."

343
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:55,400
THEN TWO HOURS BEFORE OUR DATE,

344
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:55,400
SHE CALLS ME UP.

345
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,934
SHE GOES, "AZIZ, I REALLY WANT

346
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,934
TO GO OUT TO DINNER WITH YOU,

347
00:08:57,934 --> 00:08:59,434
"BUT I KIND OF

00:08:57,934 --> 00:08:59,434
HAVE A BOYFRIEND NOW.

349
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:01,234
IS THAT A PROBLEM?"

350
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:02,934
AND I SAID,

351
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:02,934
"YEAH, IT'S KIND OF

352
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:05,567
"THE BIGGEST PROBLEM

353
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:05,567
WE COULD HAVE.

354
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:06,634
"WHY WOULD I

355
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:06,634
GO OUT WITH YOU

356
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:08,801
"IF YOU KIND OF

00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:08,801
HAVE A BOYFRIEND NOW?

00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:11,267
"WHAT'S NEXT? 'HEY, AZIZ, I GOT

"BUT YOU CAN'T RIDE ANY RIDES.

361
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,634
IS THAT A PROBLEM?'

362
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:16,501
"YEAH, IT'S A PROBLEM.

363
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:16,501
I WANTED TO RIDE THOSE RIDES.

364
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:18,667
"THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT

365
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:18,667
OF ME GOING TO THE CARNIVAL.

366
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:22,834
THESE TICKETS

367
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:22,834
YOU GAVE ME ARE USELESS."

368
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:24,901
"HEY, AZIZ, I GOT YOU

369
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:24,901

IS THAT A PROBLEM?"

373
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,434
"YEAH, IT'S A PROBLEM.

374
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,434

"AND I DON'T HAVE

PANINIS, I REALLY WANT ONE."

379
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,767
WHAT'S THE BEST-CASE

380
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,767
SCENARIO?

381
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:43,934
WE GO OUT ON THIS AMAZING DINNER

382
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:43,934
DATE, HAVE A FANTASTIC TIME,

383
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:45,534
WE COME BACK TO MY PLACE.

384
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:46,734
SHE'S LIKE, "AZIZ,

385
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,167
"I HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME

386
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,167
AT DINNER TONIGHT,

387
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,534
"AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU

388
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,534
A BLOWJOB.

389
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:51,467
"BUT I'M GONNA

390
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:51,467
USE MY BOYFRIEND'S PENIS

391
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:54,667
INSTEAD OF YOURS.

392
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:54,667
IS THAT A PROBLEM?"

393
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,334
"YEAH, IT'S A PROBLEM.

394
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,434
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA

395
00:09:57,434 --> 00:10:00,300
SUCK YOUR BOYFRIEND'S DICK

396
00:09:57,434 --> 00:10:00,300
AT MY HOUSE."

397
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,567
IT'S ALWAYS KIND OF

398
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,567
DEPRESSING TO ME

399
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,067
WHEN I TALK TO GIRLS

400
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,067
THAT HAVE BOYFRIENDS,

401
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,434
BECAUSE WHEN YOU ASK THEM

402
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,434
HOW THEY MET THEIR BOYFRIEND,

403
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:16,434
IT'S NEVER A SWEET STORY LIKE,

404
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:16,434
"OH, HE WAS THIS NICE GUY,

405
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:18,100
"AND HE WAS DOING

406
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:18,100
VOLUNTEER WORK,

407
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,334
"AND ONE DAY HE SAID

408
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,334
SOMETHING NICE TO ME,

409
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:21,167
AND GAVE ME A FLOWER,

410
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:21,167
AND WE STARTED GOING OUT."

411
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,534
NO, IT'S ALWAYS

412
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,534
STORIES LIKE,

413
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:26,100
"I WAS AT THE CLUB,

414
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:26,100
AND THIS GUY CAME UP TO ME,

415
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,834
"AND WAS LIKE, 'I BEEN

416
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,834
STARING AT YOUR ASS ALL NIGHT.

417
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,868
"IS IT COOL IF I

418
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,868
TAKE YOU OUT SOMETIME?'

419
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:34,100
AND I WAS LIKE, 'YEAH.'"

420
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,300
"WHY WOULD YOU

421
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,300
SAY YES TO THAT?"

422
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,067
"I DON'T KNOW, WHAT'S

423
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,067
THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?"

424
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:40,400
WHAT'S THE WORST

425
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:40,400
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

426
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,000
HE COULD PUT SOMETHING

427
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,000
IN YOUR DRINK AND RAPE YOU.

428
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,734
THAT'S THE WORST

429
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,734
THAT COULD HAPPEN.

430
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:45,300
HE COULD MURDER YOU

431
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:45,300
AND USE YOUR LEGS

432
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,367
TO MAKE STILTS

433
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,367
THAT LOOK LIKE LEGS.

434
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:50,567
ANOTHER THING

435
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:50,567
THAT CAN HAPPEN.

436
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,968
BUT THAT'S MY PROBLEM,

437
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:54,234
IS I THINK TOO MUCH,

438
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:54,234
YOU KNOW.

439
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:55,901
GO TO A BAR,

440
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:55,901
AND WATCH PEOPLE.

441
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:57,734
YOU'LL SEE TWO DIFFERENT

442
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:57,734
TYPES OF GUYS.

443
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:59,667
THERE'S ONE TYPE OF GUY

444
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:59,667
THAT'S A GUY LIKE ME.

445
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,534
WE'RE USUALLY SITTING IN THE

446
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,534
CORNER, TALKING TO EACH OTHER.

447
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:04,934
"EH, EH, I DON'T KNOW..."

448
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:04,934
[whiny mumbling]

449
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:07,000
"LET'S JUST TALK TO

450
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:07,000
EACH OTHER TONIGHT, BRIAN."

451
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,167
THEN THERE'S

452
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,167
A SECOND TYPE OF DUDE.

453
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,501
THE DUMB DUDES.

454
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:14,033
THEY'RE AT THE BAR,

455
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:14,033
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING.

456
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,868
THEY'RE LIKE,

457
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,868
"GIMME A SHOT OF JAGERMEISTER!

458
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:17,701
"DROP IT IN A BEER WITH

459
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:17,701
A BUNCH OF OTHER SHIT!

460
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:19,534
"BLEH!

461
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:22,601
I'LL SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY!

462
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:22,601
WAAH!"

463
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:24,434
AND THEY GO UP TO SOME GIRL,

464
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:24,434
THEY'RE LIKE,

465
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,701
"EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.

466
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:29,601
"UH, I JUST WANTED TO SAY

467
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,734
"YOU LOOK REALLY

468
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,734
BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT.

469
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,434
"AND I WAS HOPING ONE DAY

470
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,434
I MIGHT BE ABLE

471
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:36,367
"TO PUT MY HANDS

472
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:36,367
ON YOUR TITTIES.

473
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:37,467
MY NAME'S KEVIN."

474
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,367
"HI, KEVIN. I'M LISA.

475
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:42,100
DO YOU WANT TO BE MY BOYFRIEND

476
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:42,100
FOR THREE YEARS?"

477
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,334
"I DON'T KNOW.

478
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,300
"IS IT OKAY

479
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,300
IF I'M REALLY SHITTY TO YOU,

480
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,767
AND CHEAT ON YOU

481
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,767
WHENEVER I WANT?"

482
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:49,834
"YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

483
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:49,834
I'LL NEVER BREAK UP WITH YOU."

484
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,901
THEN THEY LEAVE TOGETHER.

485
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:52,534
MEANWHILE, I FINALLY

486
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:52,534
GET UP MY COURAGE.

487
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:53,934
"UH, THAT'S

488
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:53,934
A NICE JACKET."

489
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:57,767
"GET THE FUCK

490
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:57,767
OUTTA MY FACE!"

491
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,868
AND THEN SOME INDIAN DUDE

492
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,868
THAT RECOGNIZES ME FROM THE TV

493
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:04,801
WILL INVITE ME BACK TO HIS DORM

494
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:04,801
TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES.

495
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:07,868
[cheers and applause]

496
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,300
TELL ME IF THIS

497
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,300
EVER HAPPENS TO YOU GUYS.

498
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,167
YOU'RE EVER AT A PARTY,

499
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,167
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

500
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,534
AND YOU'RE

501
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,534
TALKING TO A GUY,

502
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:23,367
AND YOU THINK,

503
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:23,367
"WOW, THIS GUY IS SO DUMB.

504
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,834
"THIS IS THE DUMBEST GUY

505
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,834
I'VE MET MAYBE ALL YEAR.

506
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:28,234
"WHAT A DUMB PERSON.

507
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:28,234
I CANNOT WAIT TO GET OUT

508
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:30,267
OF THIS CONVERSATION

509
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:30,267
WITH THIS DUMB PERSON."

510
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,367
AND THEN THEY

511
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,367
SAY SOMETHING LIKE,

512
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,701
"YEAH, AND I GOT TWO KIDS."

513
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:34,734
AND YOU'RE LIKE--

514
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:34,734
[gasps] "NO!

515
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:37,467
"YOU CAN'T HAVE TWO KIDS,

516
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:37,467
YOU'RE SO STUPID!

517
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,267
"WHAT'RE YOU DOING RAISING KIDS?

518
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,267
YOU'RE SO DUMB!

519
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,968
YOU'RE RAISING MURDERERS!"

520
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:45,767
THIS HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME.

521
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:45,767
IT'S SO TERRIFYING.

522
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,234
I WAS TALKING

523
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,234
TO A DUDE AT A PARTY.

524
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,667
HE WAS 26 YEARS OLD,

525
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,667
HE HAD A 3-YEAR-OLD SON.

526
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,067
AND I WAS LIKE,

527
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,067
"WOW, THAT'S AMAZING."

528
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,367
THEN A FEW MINUTES LATER,

529
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,367
I OVERHEARD HIM

530
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,367
TELLING A GROUP OF PEOPLE

531
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:56,567
THIS STORY ABOUT HOW

532
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:56,567
A WEEK EARLIER,

533
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,934
HE TRIED TO HAVE SEX

534
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:02,067
WITH A BOWL

535
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:02,067
OF MACARONI AND CHEESE.

536
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:04,033
AND I SAID,

537
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:04,033
"WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

538
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,300
"YOU CAN'T BE A FATHER,

539
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,868
"AND THEN FUCK A BOWL

540
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,868
OF MACARONI AND CHEESE.

541
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:09,033
"ONCE YOU HAVE A KID,

542
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:12,367
THE MACARONI-AND-CHEESE-FUCKING

543
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:12,367
DAYS ARE OVER."

544
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,434
AND HE'S SITTING HERE

545
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,434
TELLING PEOPLE THE STORY.

546
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:16,534
HE'S LIKE, "YEAH, AND THEN

547
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:16,534
I PUT THE CONDOM ON."

548
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,601
AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT'D

549
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,601
YOU PUT A CONDOM ON FOR?"

550
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:24,667
AND HE'S LIKE, "I'M NOT TRYING

551
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:24,667
TO GET CHEESE ALL OVER MY DICK."

552
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:28,167
AS IF THAT WERE A TOTALLY

553
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:28,167
REASONABLE THING TO SAY.

554
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:31,834
AS IF I WAS THE WEIRD ONE FOR

555
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:31,834
EVEN BRINGING UP THE QUESTION.

556
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:36,267
YEAH, ME.

557
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:36,267
THE GUY NOT FUCKING MACARONI.

558
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:37,968
AND I TOLD HIM,

559
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:37,968
"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

560
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:39,567
"IN THIS SITUATION,

561
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:39,567
PUTTING A CONDOM ON

562
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,000
MAKES EVERYTHING WAY WORSE."

563
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,501
'CAUSE THAT MEANS

564
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,501
THE WHOLE TIME

565
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:44,334
HE WENT TO GO

566
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:44,334
FIND A BOX OF CONDOMS,

567
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:46,767
OPEN THE BOX OF CONDOMS,

568
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:46,767
TAKE THE CONDOM OUT,

569
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,734
OPEN THE CONDOM WRAPPER,

570
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,734
PUT THE CONDOM ON HIS PENIS,

571
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:49,834
GO BACK TO THE MACARONI--

572
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,133
THAT WHOLE TIME,

573
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,133
HE NEVER ONCE THOUGHT,

574
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,701
"YOU KNOW WHAT,

575
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,701
MAYBE I DON'T NEED TO FUCK

576
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,934
"A BOWL OF MACARONI

577
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,934
AND CHEESE.

578
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:57,667
"MAYBE I CAN DO

579
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:57,667
LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE,

580
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:01,200
AND IT'LL BE

581
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:01,200
A BETTER USE OF MY TIME."

582
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,267
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO SOMETHING

583
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,267
LIKE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A KID?

584
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:05,501
WHAT IF HIS KID SAW THAT?

585
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,567
HE'D NEVER BE ABLE

586
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,567
TO TELL THAT KID ANYTHING.

587
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:10,033
"HEY, SON, BE NICE TO PEOPLE.

588
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:10,033
DO GOOD IN SCHOOL."

589
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:13,534
"REALLY? I SAW YOU FUCK

590
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:13,534
A BOWL OF MACARONI AND CHEESE.

591
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:15,400
"SO, WHY WOULD I

592
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:15,400
TAKE YOUR ADVICE?

593
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,033
"BY THE WAY,

594
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,033
I'M THREE YEARS OLD.

595
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:18,634
"MY LANGUAGE SKILLS

596
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:18,634
ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE.

597

MAYBE I SHOULD JUST

598
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:20,701
RIDE THIS SHIT OUT ON MY OWN."

599
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:23,767
[cheers and applause]

600
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,267
I HAVE, UH, INTERNET ACCESS

601
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,267
RIGHT NOW,

602
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:32,901
'CAUSE THINGS

603
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:32,901
ARE GOING PRETTY WELL.

604
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:37,267
AND...I'M SURE SOME OF

605
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:37,267
YOU GUYS ARE ONLINE AS WELL,

606
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:38,534
AND I LIKE THE INTERNET,

607
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:40,767
BUT IT'S VERY

608
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:40,767
ANNOYING SOMETIMES.

609
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:42,534
DOES THIS SITUATION

610
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:42,534
HAPPEN TO YOU?

611
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:44,267
YOU'RE SITTING

612
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:44,267
AT YOUR COMPUTER,

613
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,167
WORKING ON SOMETHING

614
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,167
REALLY IMPORTANT.

615
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,834
AND THEN YOU THINK,

616
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,834
"MAN, I WONDER IF<i> HOME ALONE 2</i>

617
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:52,367
"MADE MORE MONEY

618
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:52,367
THAN<i> HOME ALONE 1.</i>

619
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:55,734
"I GOTTA LOOK INTO THIS NOW.

620
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:55,734
SORRY, IMPORTANT WORK.

621
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:59,868
SOMETHING MORE PRESSING

622
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:59,868
HAS COME UP."

623
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:01,801
I DO STUFF LIKE THAT

624
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:01,801
ALL THE TIME.

625
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,000
AND WHAT'S SO ANNOYING

626
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,868
IS ONCE I START

627
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,868
LOOKING INTO ONE THING,

628
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:06,701
I'LL SEE SOMETHING ELSE

629
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:06,701
I WANT TO RESEARCH.

630
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:08,601
FOR EXAMPLE,

631
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:08,601
IN THE<i> HOME ALONE</i> SITUATION,

632
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:09,767
I'LL BE LOOKING AT THAT,

633
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:09,767
AND I'LL SAY,

634
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:12,000
"OH, WOW.

635
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:12,000
JOE PESCI'S IN THAT MOVIE.

636
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,434
"I DON'T KNOW MUCH

637
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,434
ABOUT JOE PESCI.

638
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:17,434
MAYBE I SHOULD LEARN EVERYTHING

639
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:17,434
ABOUT JOE PESCI!"

640
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:18,934
AND THEN I'LL SPEND HOURS

641
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:20,801
DOING ALL THIS

642
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:20,801
JOE PESCI RESEARCH,

643
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:23,300
AND NOW I KNOW SO MUCH

644
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:23,300
ABOUT JOE PESCI.

645
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,267
BUT IT'S USELESS INFORMATION.

646
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,267
IT'S NEVER GONNA HELP ME.

647
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:28,734
I NEVER HEARD OF A SITUATION

648
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:28,734
WHERE A GUY'S BEEN IN AN ALLEY

649
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:30,067
WITH A DUDE

650
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:30,067
WITH A KNIFE JUST LIKE,

651
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,968
"YOU'RE GONNA DIE TONIGHT...

652
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:33,367
"UNLESS YOU CAN TELL ME

653
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:33,367
THE NAME OF THE ALBUM

654
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,501
JOE PESCI PUT OUT

655
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,501
WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE KID."

656
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,300
<i>"LITTLE JOE</i>

657
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,300
<i>SURE CAN SING?"</i>

658
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,934
"DAMN IT!

659
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,934
YOU'RE FREE TO GO!

660
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:42,567
"HOW COME SO MANY PEOPLE

661
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:42,567
KNOW THAT?

662
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,701
"I GOTTA STOP

00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:46,367
"INTEGRATING JOE PESCI

TRIVIA INTO MY MURDERS.

665
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:50,067
PEOPLE KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM

666
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:50,067
THAN I ANTICIPATED."

667
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:55,033
I ALWAYS WASTE TIME

668
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:55,033
LIKE THAT.

669
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:56,667
THE OTHER NIGHT,

670
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:56,667
I WAS UP LATE.

671
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:59,701
I REMEMBERED I'D NEVER SEEN

672
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:59,701
ANY OF THOSE<i> SAW</i> MOVIES BEFORE.

673
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:01,567
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED

674
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:01,567
TO BE PARTICULARLY GOOD MOVIES,

675
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:04,634
BUT A FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME,

676
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:04,634
"AZIZ, YOU GOTTA WATCH<i> SAW 1.</i>

677
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:07,234
THE TWIST AT THE END

678
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:07,234
OF<i> SAW 1</i> IS CRAZY."

679
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,667
AND I LOVE TWISTS

680
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,667
AT THE END OF MOVIES.

681
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:12,667
SO I WENT ON YOUTUBE,

682
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:12,667
AND I TYPED,<i> "SAW</i> ENDING."

683
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,167
SURE ENOUGH, CLIP COMES UP.

684
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,834
I KNOW

685
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,834
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

686
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,534
"UH, AZIZ, YOU DIDN'T SEE

687
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,534
THE REST OF THE MOVIE.

688
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:18,801
THE CLIP WON'T

689
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:18,801
MAKE ANY SENSE."

690
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,701
DON'T WORRY.

691
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,701
I'M NOT STUPID.

692
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:22,634
FIRST, I WENT ON

693
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:22,634
THE<i> SAW</i> WIKIPEDIA PAGE,

694
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:24,133
AND I READ

695
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:24,133
THE PLOT SUMMARY.

696
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,534
AND WHEN I GOT TO

697
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,534
THE LAST PARAGRAPH, I STOPPED,

698
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:28,234
THEN I WENT BACK

699
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:28,234
AND WATCHED THAT VIDEO,

700
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:31,501
AND LET ME TELL YOU,

701
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:31,501
I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

702
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,501
SOMEONE RECENTLY

703
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,501
SENT ME A PASSWORD

704
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,033
TO ONE OF THOSE

705
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,033
ONLINE PORN SITES.

706
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:45,267
AND THE PASSWORD WORKED.

707
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:47,400
AND I DON'T KNOW

708
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:47,400
IF ANYONE HERE'S EVER HAD

709
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,634
MEMBERSHIP ACCESS

710
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,634
TO ANY OF THOSE SITES,

711
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,567
BUT IT IS INCREDIBLE.

712
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:53,868
IF YOU'RE KIND OF

713
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:53,868

IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

716
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:56,334
IT WOULD BE WORTH IT

717
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:56,334
TO SPEND--"

718
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:59,100
DO IT.

719
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,334
NOW, THE TREND

720
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,334
IN THESE SITES IS

721
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,701
THEY TRY TO MAKE IT SEEM

722
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,701
LIKE THIS STUFF

723
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:04,868
ALL REALLY HAPPENED.

724
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:06,234
LIKE THIS IS REAL LIFE.

725

727
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,400
SO THEY HAVE

728
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,400
DUMB NAMES LIKE,

729
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,400
"REAL-LIFE-DICK-PARTY.COM."

730
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,734
AND THE VIDEOS

731
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,734
ARE ALL THE SAME.

732
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,734
THESE GUYS GO UP TO SOME GIRLS,

733
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,734
THEY'RE LIKE,

734
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,834
"EXCUSE ME, YOU GIRLS

00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,834
WANT TO COME BACK TO OUR PLACE

736

AND HAVE A DICK PARTY?"

737
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:23,033
AND THE GIRLS

738
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:23,033
ARE ALWAYS LIKE, "UH, YEAH!"

739
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:25,100
AND THEY GET IN THEIR CAR,

740
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:25,100
THEY DRIVE BACK TO THE HOUSE,

741
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,400
THEY HAVE SEX,

742
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,400
THEY FILM IT,

743
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,000
AND IT GOES

744
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,000
"REAL-LIFE-DICK-PARTY.COM."

745
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,601
DOES ANYONE THINK

746
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,601
THOSE CLIPS ARE REAL?

747
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:33,200
IF THEY WANT PEOPLE

748
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:33,200
TO THINK IT'S REAL,

749
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,434
EVERY NOW AND THEN

750
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,434
THEY SHOULD HAVE A CLIP

751
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:36,868
WHERE SOME GUYS

00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:42,634
"WHAT? THAT'S DISGUSTING!

760
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,634
"REAL-LIFE-DICK-PARTY.COM."

761
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,334

762
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,334

00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:53,901
"THOSE GIRLS DIDN'T WANT

764
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:53,901
TO HAVE A DICK PARTY AT ALL.

765
00:17:53,901 --> 00:17:58,434
THEY JUST CONTINUED ON

766
00:17:53,901 --> 00:17:58,434
TO WHOLE FOODS."

767
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:01,067
NOW, THE FIRST VIDEO

768
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:01,067
I WATCHED ON THE SITE,

769
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:04,100
THESE GUYS GO INTO

770
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:04,100
A DOUGHNUT SHOP, RIGHT?

771
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,267
AND THEY'RE TALKING TO THE GIRLS

772
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,267
IN THE DOUGHNUT SHOP,

773
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:07,968
THEY'RE LIKE, "HEY, SO,

774
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:07,968
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF US

775
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:09,634
"MAYBE GIVING YOU SOME MONEY,

776
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:09,634
AND THEN WE CAN HOOK UP

777
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:11,501
IN THE BACK

778
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:11,501
OF THE DOUGHNUT SHOP?"

779
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:15,133
AND THE GIRLS ARE LIKE,

780
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:15,133
"OKAY, THAT SOUNDS GOOD."

781
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,501
SHE WAS NOT

782
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,501
A VERY GOOD ACTRESS.

783
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:20,767
SO, THEY GO IN THE BACK,

784
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:20,767
AND THEY START HOOKING UP.

785
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,067
SO, THERE'S A GUY

786
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,067
HOOKING UP WITH A GIRL

787
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,968
IN THE BACK

788
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,968
OF A DOUGHNUT SHOP.

789
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:27,634
NOW, THIS GUY

790
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:27,634
EVENTUALLY DOES

791
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:30,634
WHAT ANY REASONABLE PERSON

792
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:30,634
WOULD DO IN THAT SITUATION,

793
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:33,634
AND HE PUTS A DOUGHNUT

794
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:33,634
AROUND HIS DICK.

795
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:37,667
NOW, THE WOMAN IS PERFORMING

796
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:37,667
FELLATIO-TYPE SERVICES,

797
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:42,400
AND SHE'S GETTING DANGEROUSLY

798
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:42,400
CLOSE TO THIS DOUGHNUT.

799
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,567
AND THEN AT ONE POINT, SHE JUST

800
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,567
TAKES A BITE OF THE DOUGHNUT.

801
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,300
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY,

802
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,300
BUT AS SOON AS THAT HAPPENED,

803
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,067
I JUST WENT,

804
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,067
"WHOA, THAT WAS AWESOME!

805
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:53,400
WHAT AN AMAZING CHOICE

806
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:53,400
BY THAT ACTRESS."

807
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,801
I WONDER IF THAT

808
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,801
WAS IMPROVISED,

809
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:55,934
LIKE THE DOUGHNUT

810
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:55,934
WAS JUST THERE,

811
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,267
AND SHE'S JUST LIKE...

812
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,267
[chomps]

813
00:18:57,267 --> 00:19:00,501
AND THE DIRECTOR'S LIKE...

814
00:18:57,267 --> 00:19:00,501
[mouths words]

815
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,934
BUT WHAT DOES THAT SAY

816
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,934
ABOUT ME AS A PERSON

817
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:13,901
THAT I GOT SO EXCITED?

818
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:16,534
I GUESS I JUST

819
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:16,534
LIKE FOOD TOO MUCH.

820
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:19,567
IT'S A GOOD THING I DON'T WRITE

821
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:19,567
THE SCRIPTS FOR THOSE VIDEOS.

822
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:20,767
MY SCRIPT WOULD BE LIKE,

823
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:23,100
"ALL RIGHT, SO, YOU PICK

824
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:23,100

841
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:44,033
"REAL-LIFE-DICK-PARTY.COM."

842
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,267
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD

843
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,267
ABOUT THAT DOUGHNUT VIDEO

844
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:56,167
IS THEY FILMED IT

845
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:56,167
IN A REAL DOUGHNUT SHOP.

846
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:58,534
WHICH MEANS THEY HAD TO PAY

847
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:58,534
A DOUGHNUT SHOP OWNER

848
00:19:58,534 --> 00:20:01,067
TO USE THAT AS A LOCATION.

849
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,434
BUT I GUESS IF YOU'RE

850
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,434
A DOUGHNUT SHOP OWNER,

851
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:04,934
THE RISK IS PRETTY LOW.

852
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:05,934
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES

853
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:05,934
OF SOMEONE AT HOME

854
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:07,167
WATCHING THE VIDEO

855
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:07,167

"OH, NO, THAT'S WHERE

864
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:18,801
BUT THAT'S GOT TO BE

865
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:18,801
HAPPENING TO SOME DUDE.

866
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,334
THEY FILM ALL THESE VIDEOS

867
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,334
IN THE SAME TOWN, I IMAGINE.

868
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:24,133
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME DUDE

869
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:24,133
WAKING UP EVERY MORNING LIKE,

870
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,033
"OH, NO, NOT THE BANK TOO!

I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE BEST THING

00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,033
THAT COULD HAPPEN

877
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,801
IN THE DOUGHNUT VIDEO

878
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,801
IS THE GIRL

879
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:38,133
TAKES A BITE

880
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:38,133
OF THE DOUGHNUT,

881
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:39,934
AND THEN SHE JUST

882
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:39,934
STARTS WALKING AWAY.

883
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:42,000

885
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,067

894
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:59,300
I WAS DOING A SHOW

895
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:59,300
ONE NIGHT,

896
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,434
AND THEY HAD A WOMAN

897
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,434
SIGNING MY ENTIRE ACT

898
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:02,601
TO THE LEFT OF THE STAGE,

899

"JIZZ EVERYWHERE,"

903
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:12,434
SHE WENT LIKE THIS...

904
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:17,067
AND IT WAS AMAZING.

905
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,133
I SAID, "JIZZ EVERYWHERE,"

906
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,133
A FEW MORE TIMES

907
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:23,267
JUST TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD

908
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:23,267
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

909
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:25,801

[whines]

916

YOU'D LOOK CRAZY EVERY TIME

917
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:38,367

"HEY, I'M NEW IN TOWN.

919

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,267
THAT'S GOTTA BE

924
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,267
CUSTOM FOR "JIZZ."

00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,067
"A FEW MORE WORDS? FINE.

945
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,067
WHAT'S THE NEXT WORD?

946
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,968
'JIZZ'? THAT'S 'JIZZ.'"

947
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:16,901
"WHAT IF IT'S EVERYWHERE?"

948
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:18,868
"THAT'S 'JIZZ EVERYWHERE'!

949
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:20,234
"HOW COME I GET

950
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:20,234
ALL THE DIRTY WORDS?

951
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:23,701
BRIAN GOT 'PUPPY,'

952
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:23,701
I GOT 'JIZZ EVERYWHERE'?"

953
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:29,934
AND THE ONLY REASON

954
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:29,934
I BRING THIS UP

955
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:33,267
IS, YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE

956
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:33,267
DAYS FROM NOW, WEEKS FROM NOW,

957
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:34,734
MONTHS FROM NOW,

958
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:34,734
YEARS FROM NOW,

959
00:22:34,734 --> 00:22:39,167
BUT ONE DAY, ONE OF YOU GUYS

960
00:22:34,734 --> 00:22:39,167
COULD BE WALKING AROUND

961
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:42,100
AND SEE A DEAF PERSON

962
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:42,100
ABOUT TO WALK INTO A ROOM

963
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,934
WHERE THERE'S

964
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,934
JIZZ EVERYWHERE,

965
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:46,467
AND YOU'LL BE LIKE...

966
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:49,367
AND THEY'LL BE LIKE...

967
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,634
AND THEY'LL HEAD

968
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,634
SOMEWHERE ELSE, FREE OF JIZZ.

969
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:55,701
[cheers and applause]

970
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:05,934
I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, AND...

971
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:05,934
[scattered cheering]

972
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:07,300
THANK YOU.

973
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,267
AND WHENEVER I TELL PEOPLE

974
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,267
THAT, THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE,

975
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:13,100
[gasps] "OH, NO.

976
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,834
"BUT IT'S SO RACIST THERE.

977
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:20,667
AND YOUR SKIN IS BROWN.

978
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:20,667
HOW DID YOU SURVIVE?"

979
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,434
AND SURE, CERTAIN PARTS

980
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,434
OF SOUTH CAROLINA

981
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:24,701
CAN BE PRETTY RACIST.

982
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:26,667
MORE RACIST THAN OTHER

983
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:26,667
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

984
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:27,901
BUT WHAT

985
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:27,901
THESE PEOPLE FORGET

986
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:31,601
IS THAT THE FOOD THERE

987
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:31,601
IS DELICIOUS.

988
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:33,167
SO GROWING UP IN SOUTH CAROLINA,

989
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:33,167
IT'S KIND OF LIKE,

990
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,567
"OH, DID THAT GUY

991
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,567
JUST SAY THE N-WORD?

992
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:36,567
"OOH, FRIED CHICKEN

993
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:36,567
AND BISCUITS. NEVER MIND!

994
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:38,868
NOM YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!"

995
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:40,901
EVEN IF RIGHT NOW SOME DUDE

996
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:40,901
STOOD UP AND WAS LIKE,

997
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,334
"HEY, I'M GONNA SAY

998
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,334
A BUNCH OF RACIST STUFF,

999
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,801
BUT AFTERWARDS

1000
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,801
I'LL GIVE YOU A BISCUIT,"

1001
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,200
I'D BE LIKE,

1002
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,200
"THAT'S A WEIRD DEAL,

1003
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,033
BUT I'LL TAKE IT."

1004
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:53,033
'CAUSE I HATE RACISM,

1005
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:53,033
BUT I LOVE A GOOD BISCUIT.

1006
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:55,234
I JUST THINK

1007
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:55,234
IT'S A LITTLE SILLY

1008
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:56,601
WHEN SOMETIMES

1009
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:56,601
PEOPLE ACT AS IF

1010
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,334
ALL THE REALLY CRAZY RACISM

1011
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,334
IS JUST IN PLACES

1012
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:01,567
LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA, ALABAMA,

1013
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:01,567
MISSISSIPPI, OR WHATEVER,

1014
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:04,701
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN CRAZY

1015
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:04,701
RACIST STUFF HAPPEN EVERYWHERE.

1016
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,601
I HAVE A FRIEND IN L.A.

1017
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,601
HE'S KOREAN, RIGHT?

1018
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:09,834
AND HE GOT LOCKED

1019
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:09,834
OUT OF HIS APARTMENT.

1020
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:12,567
SO, HE CALLED

1021
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:12,567
A LOCKSMITH, OKAY?

1022
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:14,434
AND THE LOCKSMITH'S

1023
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:14,434
GETTING ALL HIS INFO.

1024
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:15,701
HE'S LIKE,

1025
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:15,701
"WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME?"

1026
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:16,901
AND HE'S LIKE, "CHUN."

1027
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:19,734
THE GUY GOES, "WHAT KIND

1028
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:19,734
OF LAST NAME IS THAT?"

1029
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:21,534
THE GUY GOES,

1030
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:21,534
"UH, KOREAN-AMERICAN."

1031
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:24,501
AND THE GUY GOES,

1032
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:24,501
"I HATE KOREAN-AMERICANS.

1033
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,767
KOREAN-AMERICANS ARE TRYING

1034
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,767
TO DESTROY AMERICA."

1035
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:30,100
AND HE HUNG UP ON HIM.

1036
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:30,100
WOULDN'T UNLOCK HIS DOOR.

1037
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,801
AND I THOUGHT, "WOW.

1038
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:36,234
SO, THIS LOCKSMITH DOES NO

1039
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:36,234
BUSINESS WITH KOREAN-AMERICANS."

1040
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:40,167
BUT I WONDERED,

1041
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:40,167
"HOW MANY KOREAN-AMERICANS

1042
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:43,367
"WOULD HAVE TO CALL HIM,

1043
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:43,367
BEFORE ECONOMICALLY,

1044
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:46,567
HE COULDN'T AFFORD

1045
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:46,567
TO BE THAT RACIST?"

1046
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:48,667
LIKE, WHAT IF KOREAN PEOPLE

1047
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:48,667
JUST KEPT CALLING?

1048
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,534
WOULD HE EVENTUALLY BE LIKE,

1049
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,534
"DAMN IT, MAN,

1050
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:52,000
"I WOULD'VE MADE $5,000

1051
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:52,000
YESTERDAY

1052
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,300
"IF I DIDN'T HATE

1053
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,300
KOREAN PEOPLE!

1054
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,567
"THIS IS SO STUPID!

1055
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,234
"KOREAN-AMERICANS AREN'T

00:24:56,234 --> 00:25:00,334
THEY CAN'T EVEN

1058
00:24:56,234 --> 00:25:00,334
FIND THEIR KEYS!"

1059
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:01,634
BUT THEN, WEIRDLY,

1060
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:04,234
THAT STEREOTYPE WOULD GET

1061
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:04,234
INTEGRATED INTO HIS RACISM.

1062
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:05,601
LIKE, HE WOULD SEE KOREAN

1063
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:05,601
PEOPLE, AND HE'D BE LIKE,

1064
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,734
"PSSH, LET ME GUESS.

1065
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,734

00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:13,968
HE SEES A KOREAN DUDE

1069
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:13,968
OPENING A DOOR, HE'S LIKE,

00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:17,334

00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:31,501
WHEN PEOPLE ARE RACIST,

1080
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:35,467
BUT I AM WEIRDLY FASCINATED

1081
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:35,467

1089
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:46,634
NO ONE WAS LOST.

1090
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:49,734

1092
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:51,567

1105
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:07,200
ONE DAY, I DECIDED

1106
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:07,200
TO DO SOME RESEARCH

1107
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,234
ON RACIAL SLURS, AND SEE

1108
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,234
IF I COULD LEARN ANYTHING.

1109
00:26:10,234 --> 00:26:12,667
AND I FOUND A VERY

1110
00:26:10,234 --> 00:26:12,667
INTERESTING ARTICLE.

1111
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:17,300
IT WAS TITLED,

1112
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:17,300
"LIST OF EVERY ETHNIC SLUR."

1113
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,434
AND IT WAS 21 PAGES LONG.

1114
00:26:19,434 --> 00:26:23,834
AND I READ ALL OF 'EM.

1115
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,100
AND IF IT'S COOL

1116
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,100
WITH YOU GUYS,

1117
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,000
I'D NOW LIKE TO SHARE

1118
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,000
A FEW OF MY FAVORITES.

[cheers and applause]

1120
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:34,100
NOW, THESE ARE RACIAL SLURS,

1121
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:34,100
ETHNIC SLURS, OKAY?

1122
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,334
SO, THEY'RE OFFENSIVE.

1123
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:37,133
THEY'RE OFFENSIVE

1124
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:37,133
BY THEIR VERY NATURE.

1125
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:39,834
SO, IF I SAY ONE,

1126
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:39,834
OR I DESCRIBE ONE,

1127
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:41,934
AND YOU'RE OFFENDED,

1128
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:41,934
THERE'S NO REASON TO BE LIKE,

1129
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:46,701
"OH..."

1130
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:46,701
[trails off]

1131
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:50,501
'CAUSE WE ALL KNOW

1132
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:50,501
THEY'RE OFFENSIVE.

1133
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:54,000
SO INSTEAD, YOU CAN

1134
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:54,000
SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH.

1135
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,701
AT THE SAME TIME,

1136
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,701
THOUGH, AT THE SAME TIME,

1137
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,067
I DON'T WANNA

1138
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,067
DO THIS BIT,

1139
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:00,133
AND LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE

1140
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:00,133
AND SEE SOME GUY JUST LIKE,

1141
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,601
"YEAH!

1142
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,601
[excited laughter]

1143
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:06,100
YEAH!"

1144
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:06,100
[grunting]

1145
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,601
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE

1146
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,601
TERRIFYING

1147
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:09,467
ON THE OTHER END

1148
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:09,467
OF THE SPECTRUM.

1149
00:27:09,467 --> 00:27:14,100
SO, HERE WE GO.

1150
00:27:09,467 --> 00:27:14,100
MY FAVORITE RACIAL SLURS, OKAY?

1151
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,367
THE FIRST ONE--

1152
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,400
IT'S DEFINED AS,

1153
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,400
"A DEROGATORY DESCRIPTIVE PHRASE

1154
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,701
"FOR A PERSON OF PREDOMINANTLY

1155
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,701
CAUCASIAN ANCESTRY

1156
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:24,567
"WITH REAL

1157
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:24,567
OR SUSPECTED

1158
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:27,834
DISTANT ASIAN

1159
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:27,834
OR AFRICAN ANCESTRY."

1160
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:31,400
NOW, THIS IS A PRETTY

1161
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:31,400
SPECIFIC SITUATION

1162
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,367
TO NEED TO BUST OUT

1163
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,367
A RACIAL SLUR,

1164
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:35,033
BUT, UH, IF YOU'RE EVER

1165
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:35,033
CAUGHT IN A JAM,

1166
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:36,400
ALL YOU GOTTA SAY IS,

1167
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,234
"YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN?

1168
00:27:38,234 --> 00:27:40,567
"YOU GOT A TOUCH

1169
00:27:38,234 --> 00:27:40,567
OF THE TAR BRUSH!

1170
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:44,367
"YEAH, YOU HEARD ME. YOU GOT

1171
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:44,367
A TOUCH OF THE TAR BRUSH.

1172
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:48,701
"THIS IS A TAR BRUSH,

1173
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:48,701
THIS IS YOU. BOOP!

1174
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:51,033
"YOU DON'T THINK I SEE

1175
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:51,033
THAT DISTANT ASIAN ANCESTRY

1176
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:54,901
IN YOUR PREDOMINANTLY

1177
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:54,901
CAUCASIAN FACE?"

1178
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:00,801
SOME OF

1179
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:00,801
THE RACIAL SLURS, UH,

1180
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:04,300
CONTAINED OTHER RACIAL SLURS

1181
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:04,300
WITHIN THEMSELVES.

1182
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,267
THEY WERE COMBINATIONS,

1183
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,868
WHICH SEEMED

1184
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,868
VERY INCONVENIENT TO ME.

1185
00:28:07,868 --> 00:28:10,901
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE WAS ONE

1186
00:28:07,868 --> 00:28:10,901
FOR NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE--

1187
00:28:10,901 --> 00:28:13,534
"PRAIRIE N-WORD."

1188
00:28:10,901 --> 00:28:13,534
"PRAIRIE N-WORD"?

1189
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:15,901
WHENEVER I HEAR THAT,

1190
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:15,901
I IMAGINE THIS SCENARIO:

1191
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:17,801
SOME GUY'S TALKING

1192
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:17,801
TO A NATIVE-AMERICAN DUDE.

1193
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:18,968
"GET OUTTA HERE,

1194
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:18,968
PRAIRIE N-WORD."

1195
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:20,467
SOME BLACK GUY'S LIKE,

1196
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:20,467
"WHAT'D YOU SAY?"

1197
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:24,667
"DUDE, I SAID, 'PRAIRIE.'

1198
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:24,667
THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

1199
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:29,033
STEP OFF."

1200
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:32,634
BUT A LOT OF TIMES,

1201
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:32,634
YOU READ THE RACIAL SLUR,

1202
00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:33,968
AND IT'S LIKE, WHAT?

1203
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:37,133
WHAT ETHNICITY IS THAT FOR?

1204
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:37,133
WHO WOULD YOU SAY THAT TO?

1205
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,234
SEE IF YOU CAN GUESS ONE.

1206
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,234
SEE IF YOU CAN GUESS THIS ONE.

1207
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:40,601
"DOGAN."

1208
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:43,133
IT'S IRISH CATHOLIC. SEE?

1209
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:43,133
NO ONE COULD GUESS IT.

1210
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:44,667
SEE IF YOU CAN

1211
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:44,667
GUESS THIS ONE.

1212
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,734
"CHRIST KILLER."

1213
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:49,067
ANYONE HAVE A GUESS

1214
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:49,067
ON THAT ONE?

1215
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:51,601
"CHRIST KILLER."

1216
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:51,601
WHO WOULD YOU SAY THAT TO?

1217
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:55,834
CHRIST KILLER.

1218
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:55,834
KILLER OF CHRIST.

1219
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,400
DID SOMEONE SAY,

1220
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,400
"JEWISH PEOPLE"? NO.

1221
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,133
IT'S ACTUALLY

1222
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,133
FOR ASIAN PEOPLE.

1223
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,400
IT'S USED BY PEOPLE

1224
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,400
THAT HATE ASIANS SO MUCH

1225
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,267
THEY BLAME 'EM

1226
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,267
FOR THE DEATH OF CHRIST.

1227
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:07,234
"CHRIST KILLER!"

1228
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:08,501
"BUT I'M ASIAN!"

1229
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:11,200
"I KNOW. WHY YOU THINK

1230
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:11,200
GOD CREATED LOCKS?

1231
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,367
CHING-CHONG, BING-BONG,

1232
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,367
YOU KILLED CHRIST."

1233
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,000
BUT WHAT I LEARNED

1234
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,000
READING THAT LIST, THOUGH,

1235
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,367
WAS I THINK YOU CAN MAKE

1236
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:27,000
ANYTHING SOUND

1237
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:27,000
RACIST OR HATEFUL.

1238
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,234
WITH THE RIGHT TONE IN YOUR

1239
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,234
VOICE, THE RIGHT INFLECTION,

1240
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,067
YOU CAN MAKE ANYTHING

1241
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,067
SOUND HATEFUL.

1242
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:34,567
LET ME SEE IF I CAN CREATE

1243
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:34,567
A RACIAL SLUR RIGHT NOW.

1244
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,167
LIKE, UH, SIR,

1245
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,167
YOU SITTING RIGHT THERE.

1246
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:39,067
UH, WHAT IS YOUR ETHNICITY?

1247
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:39,067
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

1248
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:43,234
SHUT UP, KIT-KAT!

1249
00:29:43,234 --> 00:29:45,767
QUIT LAUGHING, KIT-KAT!

1250
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:49,934
SEE? THAT STARTED TO SOUND

1251
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:49,934
REAL RACIST.

1252
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:51,868
'CAUSE YOU'RE THINKING,

1253
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:51,868
"WHOA, WHOA.

1254
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:55,701
"THAT GUY'S NOT A KIT-KAT.

1255
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:55,701
HE'S A PERSON.

1256
00:29:55,701 --> 00:29:58,267
"AZIZ MUST BE IMPLYING

1257
00:29:55,701 --> 00:29:58,267
HE'S BROWN ON THE OUTSIDE,

1258
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:02,968
WAFER-LIKE ON THE INSIDE."

1259
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:07,400
I'VE BEEN HAVING FUN

1260
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:07,400
DOING THIS TOUR.

1261
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,734
WHEN I STARTED THE TOUR,

1262
00:30:08,734 --> 00:30:11,701
I WAS READING THIS

1263
00:30:08,734 --> 00:30:11,701
MOTLEY CRUE AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

1264
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:14,267
AND IT WAS

1265
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:14,267
REALLY INTERESTING.

1266
00:30:14,267 --> 00:30:16,701
I QUICKLY LEARNED

1267
00:30:14,267 --> 00:30:16,701
THAT MOTLEY CRUE TOURS--

1268
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:19,167
WAY CRAZIER

1269
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:19,167
THAN AN AZIZ TOUR.

1270
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:22,834
IT'S FASCINATING BECAUSE

1271
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:22,834
THESE GUYS WERE AT ONE POINT

1272
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:25,601
THE BIGGEST BAND IN THE WORLD,

1273
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:25,601
PERFORMING AT ARENAS AND STUFF,

1274
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:27,701
BUT AT THE SAME TIME

1275
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:27,701
THEY WERE DOING MASSIVE AMOUNTS

1276
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,434
OF COCAINE AND HEROIN

1277
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,434
ALL THE TIME,

1278
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:32,167
AND MY BODY JUST COULD NOT

1279
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:32,167
TAKE ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

1280
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,367
EVEN IF JUST TONIGHT,

1281
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,367
I WAS LIKE, "LET'S DO HEROIN!"

1282
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:37,567
THE NEXT DAY, IT'D BE LIKE,

1283
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:37,567
"AZIZ IS DEAD!

1284
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:40,567
YEAH, HE DID HEROIN ONCE,

1285
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:40,567
AND HE DIED."

1286
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:41,868
"HOW MUCH HEROIN

1287
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:41,868
DID HE DO?"

1288
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:43,434
"NONE, HE JUST

1289
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:43,434
HAD A NEEDLE IN HIS ARM,

1290
00:30:43,434 --> 00:30:46,000
AND FELT WOOZY

1291
00:30:43,434 --> 00:30:46,000
AND FELL OF A BUILDING."

1292
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:51,267
THEY HAVE ALL THESE

1293
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:51,267
INSANE STORIES ABOUT GIRLS.

1294
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:52,667
LIKE, AT ONE POINT,

1295
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,033
THEY'RE HAVING SEX

1296
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,033
WITH ALL THESE GROUPIES, RIGHT?

1297
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:56,868
BUT THEY HAD

1298
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:56,868
GIRLFRIENDS AT HOME.

1299
00:30:56,868 --> 00:30:59,033
SO AT THE END OF THE NIGHT,

1300
00:30:56,868 --> 00:30:59,033
TO COVER THEIR TRACKS,

1301
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:03,901
THEY WOULD PUT THEIR PENISES

1302
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:03,901
INSIDE BURRITOS.

1303
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:08,834
HOW DID THAT

1304
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:08,834
BECOME THE PLAN?

1305
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,434
WAS A MOTLEY CRUE GUY

1306
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,434
JUST RUNNING AROUND?

1307
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:12,834
"OH, MY GOD, MY DICK SMELLS LIKE

1308
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:12,834
ALL THESE OTHER VAGINAS!

1309
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,501
"MY GIRLFRIEND'S GONNA FIND OUT

1310
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,501
I'M CHEATING ON HER!

1311
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:16,033
"WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

1312
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:16,033
WHAT I'MA DO? WHAT I'MA DO?

1313
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:17,634
"CAN I WASH MY DICK

1314
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:17,634
WITH SOAP AND WATER?

1315
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:21,000
"NO! THAT WON'T WORK!

1316
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:21,000
WHY? I DON'T KNOW!

1317
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,100
"QUICK, GIMME THAT BURRITO.

1318
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,567
"IT'S PERFECT.

1319
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,567
THE SCENT OF PICO DE GALLO

1320
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:31,067
WILL TOTALLY THROW OFF

1321
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:31,067
MY GIRLFRIEND."

1322
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:32,767
THAT STORY'S

1323
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:32,767
A QUINTESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE

1324
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:36,133
BETWEEN A COMEDY TOUR

1325
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:36,133
AND A ROCK TOUR.

1326
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:38,133
A ROCK TOUR, SOME DUDE'S

1327
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:38,133
FUCKING A BURRITO, IT'S LIKE,

1328
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:39,534
"YEAH, MAN,

1329
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:39,534
GOTTA GET THE SMELL

1330
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:41,200
OF ALL THESE OTHER VAGINAS

1331
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:41,200
OFF MY DICK."

1332
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,033
COMEDY TOUR, IT'S LIKE...

1333
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,033
[cries] "I'M SO ALONE!"

1334
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:52,167
I LIKE TOURING.

1335
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,067
THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE

1336
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,067
IS THE ACTUAL TRAVEL ITSELF.

1337
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:57,000
'CAUSE PEOPLE CAN BE SO RUDE

1338
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:57,000
WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELING.

1339
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,667
THE RUDEST PERSON I'VE EVER MET

1340
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,667
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE

1341
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:04,033
IS THE EASTERN EUROPEAN CUSTOMS

1342
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:04,033
LADY AT THE TORONTO AIRPORT.

1343
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:06,868
WHAT'S THAT LADY'S PROBLEM?

1344
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:06,868
WHY SHE GOTTA BE SO RUDE?

1345
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:08,801
CUSTOMS PEOPLE

1346
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:08,801
ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE YOU MEET

1347
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:09,901
WHEN YOU GO

1348
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:09,901
TO A NEW COUNTRY.

1349
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:11,467
THEY SHOULD BE NICE,

1350
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:11,467
WELCOMING.

1351
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:13,934
THIS LADY, AS SOON AS YOU

1352
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:13,934
WALK UP, SHE JUST GOES,

1353
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,834
"WHAT YOU ARE

1354
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,834
DOING HERE?"

1355
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,968
AND I WAS LIKE,

1356
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,968
"UH, I'M SHOOTING A MOVIE."

1357
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:22,000
SHE GOES, "WHAT IT MEAN,

1358
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:22,000
'SHOOTING MOVIE'?"

1359
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,767
LIKE, "YOU KNOW,

1360
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,767

1361
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,734
SHE GOES, "I KNOW

1362
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,734

1363
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:27,267
"I MEAN ARE YOU DOING

1364
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:27,267
THE LIGHTS? ARE YOU ACTING?

1365
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:30,567
ARE YOU DIRECTING? I COULD DO

1366
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:30,567
WITHOUT YOUR SARCASM."

1367
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:32,567
I WAS LIKE,

1368
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:32,567
"WHY ARE YOU BEING SO MEAN?

1369
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:33,601
"I SAID SOMETHING,

1370
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:33,601
AND YOU WENT,

1371
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:35,634
"'WHAT IT MEAN,

1372
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:35,634

1373
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:36,901
"SO I JUST ASSUMED

1374
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:36,901
YOU'RE KIND OF DUMB,

1375
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:39,000
"AND I'M TRYING

1376
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:39,000
TO EXPLAIN THINGS TO YOU.

1377
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,734
"I'M STUNNED YOU KNOW

1378
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,734
WHAT THE WORD 'SARCASM' MEANS.

1379
00:32:41,734 --> 00:32:43,167
"YOUR ENGLISH

1380
00:32:41,734 --> 00:32:43,167
IS SLIGHTLY BETTER

"THAN ANIMAL

AND YOU'RE YELLING AT ME

1384
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:47,801
LIKE A PSYCHOPATH."

1385
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,367
AND I GOT MY STAMP,

1386
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,367
AND I WALKED ON.

1387
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:52,167
BUT I KIND OF WISH

1388
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:52,167
AFTER I'D GOTTEN THE STAMP,

1389
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:55,834
I TURNED AROUND, AND I WAS LIKE,

1390
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:55,834
"GUESS WHAT. I LIED."

1391
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:58,434
AND THEN PULLED OUT A DVD

1392
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:58,434
OF<i> JURASSIC PARK</i> AND A HANDGUN,

1393
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,200
WAS LIKE, "THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS

1394
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,200
'SHOOTING MOVIE.'"

1395
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,667
BANG, BANG,

1396
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,667
BANG, BANG, BANG!

1397
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:10,767
PASSENGERS CAN ALSO

1398
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:10,767
BE RUDE TO YOU ALSO.

1399
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:13,501
I WAS FLYING HOME ONCE, AND I

1400
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:13,501
WAS SITTING NEXT TO THIS COUPLE.

1401
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:15,000
THEY HAD THESE TWO PUPPIES

1402
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,767
THAT THEY PUT UNDER THE SEATS

1403
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,767
IN FRONT OF US.

1404
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:19,000
AND THERE WAS AN OLDER COUPLE

1405
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:19,000
SITTING THERE, AND THEY SAID,

1406
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,300
"HEY, UH, YOU GUYS MIND MOVING

1407
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,300
THE PUPPIES OVER A LITTLE BIT

1408
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,767
SO WE'LL PUT

1409
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,767
OUR JACKETS UNDER THERE?"

1410
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,701
AND THE LADY

1411
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,701
WITH THE PUPPIES IS LIKE,

1412
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:28,067
"UH, NO. WE HAVE TWO PUPPIES,

1413
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:28,067
THEY NEED ALL THE ROOM.

1414
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:30,434
THANK YOU VERY MUCH."

1415
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:31,834
AND I WAS LIKE,

1416
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:31,834
"WHOA, WHY'D SHE NEED TO BE

1417
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,467
SO RUDE ABOUT THAT?"

1418
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:35,000
AND THEN SHE STARTED TALKING

1419
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:35,000
TO HER HUSBAND.

1420
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,634
SHE'S LIKE, "UGH, CAN YOU

1421
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,634
BELIEVE THOSE PEOPLE,

1422
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:38,534
"ASKING US TO MOVE THE PUPPIES

1423
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:38,534
FOR THEIR JACKETS?

1424
00:33:38,534 --> 00:33:41,000
WHAT KIND OF NERVE DO THEY HAVE?

1425
00:33:38,534 --> 00:33:41,000
WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE?"

1426
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,100
AND I WAS LIKE...

1427
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,467
[whispers]

1428
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,467
"I FUCKIN' HATE THIS LADY."

1429
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:48,167
SO I STARTED CHIMING IN.

1430
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:48,167
I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I HEARD THAT.

1431
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:50,167
"I COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY'D

1432
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:50,167
ASK SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1433
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:53,234
"THOSE PEOPLE ARE AWFUL.

1434
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:53,234
THOSE PEOPLE ARE TERRIBLE.

1435
00:33:53,234 --> 00:33:58,501
THOSE PEOPLE

1436
00:33:53,234 --> 00:33:58,501
DESERVE TO BE MURDERED."

1437
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:02,300
AND I DIDN'T SAY ANOTHER WORD

1438
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:02,300
THE WHOLE FLIGHT.

1439
00:34:04,901 --> 00:34:08,167
AND THEN THE FLIGHT LANDS.

1440
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,601
AND THE OLD COUPLE GETS UP,

1441
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,601
THEY LEAVE THE PLANE.

1442
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:11,968
NOW THE YOUNG COUPLE'S

1443
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:11,968
ABOUT TO GET UP,

1444
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:17,033
BUT I HOLD 'EM DOWN, AND I GO,

1445
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:17,033
"NO, NO. I GOT THIS."

1446
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:18,334
AND I STEP OVER 'EM,

1447
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:20,701
AND I START FOLLOWING

1448
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:20,701
THE OLD PEOPLE, RIGHT?

1449
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:23,300
YOUNG COUPLE'S BEHIND ME,

1450
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:23,300
WE GET OUTSIDE THE AIRPORT,

1451
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,968
I PULL OUT THE GUN THAT I HAD

1452
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,968
FROM THE PREVIOUS JOKE,

1453
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:27,968
LOAD IN TWO BULLETS.

1454
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,334
I AIM IT AT THE OLD PEOPLE,

1455
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,400
BUT THEN I SPIN AROUND

1456
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,400
AND I AIM IT AT THE PUPPIES.

1457
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
BANG, BANG!

1458
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,934
I SHOOT BOTH THOSE PUPPIES

1459
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,934
IN THE FACE.

1460
00:34:35,934 --> 00:34:38,467
AND I GO, "NEVER BE RUDE

1461
00:34:35,934 --> 00:34:38,467
TO THE ELDERLY AGAIN.

1462
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:41,534
HAVE FUN BURYING

1463
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:41,534
YOUR DEAD PUPPIES."

1464
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:46,567
I KNOW WHAT SOME OF YOU

1465
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:46,567
ARE THINKING.

1466
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,234
"OH, NO!

1467
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,234
WHY'D THE PUPPIES GET SHOT?

1468
00:34:48,234 --> 00:34:50,734
THE PUPPIES DIDN'T

1469
00:34:48,234 --> 00:34:50,734
DO ANYTHING!"

1470
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:52,133
I DIDN'T REALLY SHOOT

1471
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:52,133
ANY PUPPIES.

1472
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,501
YOU'RE BEING STUPID.

1473
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:02,200
I HAVE MET SOME REALLY

1474
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:02,200
INTERESTING PEOPLE ON TOUR.

1475
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,634
ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE

1476
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,634
THAT I MET

1477
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:06,901
WAS THIS GENTLEMAN WHO ONCE

1478
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:06,901
PICKED ME UP FROM THE AIRPORT

1479
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:08,100
AND DROVE ME

1480
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:08,100
TO THE VENUE.

1481
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,501
AND I WAS TALKING TO THIS GUY,

1482
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,501
AND I WAS LIKE,

1483
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:13,634
"WHAT DID YOU DO

1484
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:13,634
BEFORE YOU WERE A DRIVER?"

1485
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:15,934
AND HE GOES, "I USED TO BE

1486
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:15,934
A CELEBRITY BODYGUARD."

1487
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:18,367
I WAS LIKE, "WHOA.

1488
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:18,367
WHO'D YOU BODYGUARD FOR?"

1489
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:19,467
HE'S LIKE, "YOU NAME IT.

1490
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:21,901

JONAS BROTHERS."

1492
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:24,400
LIKE, "WHOA. OUT OF ALL

1493
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:24,400
THE PEOPLE YOU BODYGUARDED FOR,

1494
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,601
"WHO WAS THE TOUGHEST PERSON

1495
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,601
TO DO SECURITY FOR?

1496
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:27,901
WHO HAD

1497
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:27,901
THE CRAZIEST FANS?"

1498
00:35:27,901 --> 00:35:30,934
HE GOES, "TOUGHEST PERSON

1499
00:35:27,901 --> 00:35:30,934
TO DO SECURITY FOR? CHER.

1500
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:35,934
CRAZIEST FANS?

1501
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:35,934
PAULY SHORE."

1502
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:39,901
AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?

1503
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:39,901
THOSE ARE BOTH WRONG ANSWERS."

1504
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:41,667
I CAN DO SECURITY

1505
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:41,667
FOR PAULY SHORE.

1506
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:43,801
"HEY, MAN, CAN YOU LEAVE

1507
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:43,801
PAULY SHORE ALONE? THANKS.

1508
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:47,534
ALL RIGHT, PAULY, LET'S GO.

1509
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:47,534
THOSE TWO GUYS ARE GONE."

1510
00:35:50,267 --> 00:35:52,334
AND THEN I ASKED HIM--

1511
00:35:50,267 --> 00:35:52,334
I SAID, "WHAT'D YOU DO

1512
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:53,667
BEFORE YOU WERE

1513
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:53,667
A CELEBRITY BODYGUARD?"

1514
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:56,267
HE GOES, "USED TO DRIVE

1515
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:56,267
MADONNA'S TOUR BUS."

1516
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:57,234
I SAID, "HOW WAS THAT?"

1517
00:35:57,234 --> 00:35:59,534
"NOT FUN."

1518
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:00,801
I SAID, "WHY?"

1519
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:03,868
HE GOES, "'CAUSE EVERY TIME

1520
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:03,868
I DROVE THE BUS,

1521
00:36:03,868 --> 00:36:08,000
ONE OF HER DANCERS

1522
00:36:03,868 --> 00:36:08,000
PUT HIS DICK ON MY SHOULDER."

1523
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
THAT WAS NOT WHAT

1524
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I WAS EXPECTING HIM TO SAY.

1525
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,167
SO I SAID, "SIR, YOU'RE

1526
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,167
GONNA HAVE TO ELABORATE."

1527
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:18,133
AND HE TOLD ME THE STORY,

1528
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:18,133
AND BASICALLY,

1529
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:20,334
ANY TIME HE WAS DRIVING THE BUS,

1530
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:20,334
AT ONE POINT,

1531
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:22,501
ONE OF MADONNA'S DANCERS

1532
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:22,501
WOULD JUST COME UP AND...

1533
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:25,467
[thumps mic]

1534
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:27,100
THROW A DICK

1535
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:27,100
ON HIS SHOULDER.

1536
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,234
AND THIS HAPPENED SO MANY TIMES

1537
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,234
HE HAD TO QUIT HIS JOB

1538
00:36:30,234 --> 00:36:33,300
AND GET INTO

1539
00:36:30,234 --> 00:36:33,300
A NEW PROFESSION.

1540
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,000
BUT I GUESS THAT WOULD

1541
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,000
MAKE YOU QUIT ANY JOB.

1542
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,267
YOU COULD BE A LAWYER.

1543
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:37,667
PEOPLE WOULD GO, "HEY, MAN,

1544
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:37,667
WEREN'T YOU A LAWYER?"

1545
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:42,133
"YEAH, I WAS. TILL THIS NEW

1546
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:42,133
PARTNER JOINED THE FIRM.

1547
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,167
"AND EVERY TIME

1548
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,167
I PRESENTED A CASE,

1549
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,767
"HE PUT HIS DICK

1550
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,767
ON MY SHOULDER.

1551
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:49,667
SO NOW I WORK AT QUIZNOS."

1552
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,300
EVEN IF YOUR JOB

1553
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,300
WAS JUST STARING AT A DICK

1554
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,667
ON YOUR LEFT SHOULDER

1555
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,667

IF AT SOME POINT,

1557
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,400
ANOTHER GUY CAME

1558
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,934
AND PUT HIS DICK

1559
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,934
ON YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER,

1560
00:36:57,934 --> 00:37:00,334
YOU'D BE LIKE, "WHOA, WHOA,

00:36:57,934 --> 00:37:00,334

1562
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:01,734

I DON'T NEED THIS SHIT!"

1581
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:29,767
RIGHT NOW, I WANTED TO TAKE

1582
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:29,767
A COUPLE OF MINUTES

1583
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:32,400
TO UPDATE YOU ON ONE OF MY

1584
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:32,400
FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD,

1585
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,234
AND THAT'S MY CHUBBY

1586

[cheers and applause]

1588
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:41,000
[chuckles]

1589
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,467
HARRIS IS A LITTLE COUSIN

1590
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,467
OF MINE THAT LIVES IN GEORGIA

1591
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:45,300
AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE

1592
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:45,300
ANY KIDS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

1593
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,968
SO I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD UPDATE

1594
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,968
YOU ON WHAT HE'S BEEN UP TO.

1595
00:37:47,968 --> 00:37:50,701
UH, HARRIS IS A WEIRD KID.

1596
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,367
YOU KNOW, I DON'T GET TO SPEND

1597
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,367
A TON OF TIME WITH HIM.

1598
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:55,400
BUT I DO CHECK UP ON HIM

1599
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:55,400
REGULARLY ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE,

1600
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,033
AND READ HIS

1601
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,033
STATUS UPDATES.

1602
00:37:57,033 --> 00:37:58,234
HE RECENTLY

1603
00:37:57,033 --> 00:37:58,234
HAD A QUOTE UP THERE.

1604
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,534
AND THE QUOTE SAID,

1605
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:04,701
"LIFE'S A DIRTY GAME.

1606
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:04,701
YOU GOTTA PLAY DIRTY TO WIN IT."

1607
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,567
DASH, "HARRIS."

1608
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:09,033
HE'S QUOTING HIMSELF

1609
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:09,033
ON THIS ONE.

1610
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,868
YUP, THAT'S

1611
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,868
A HARRIS ORIGINAL.

1612
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:12,767
THAT'S NOT

1613
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:12,767
FROM SEASON FOUR OF<i> THE WIRE.</i>

1614
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:14,400
THAT'S FROM A CHUBBY KID

1615
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:14,400
NAMED HARRIS

1616
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,100
WHO ONCE TOLD ME HIS

1617
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,100
FAVORITE FOOD IS HOT POCKETS.

1618
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,767
WHAT A DARK THING TO SAY.

1619
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,868
"LIFE'S A DIRTY GAME.

1620
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,868
YOU GOTTA PLAY DIRTY TO WIN IT."

1621
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:26,400
WHEN HAS HARRIS

1622
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:26,400
PLAYED DIRTY IN LIFE?

1623
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,667
I CAN ONLY THINK

1624
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,667
OF ONE INSTANCE.

1625
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:28,834
IT'S WHEN

1626
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:28,834
HE'S PLAYING<i> HALO.</i>

1627
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:30,267
'CAUSE AS SOON AS

1628
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:30,267
THE BOARD STARTS,

1629
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,601
HE ALWAYS KNOWS WHERE

1630
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,601
THE ROCKET LAUNCHERS ARE,

1631
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,133
AND HE GRABS 'EM AND STARTS

1632
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,133
BLOWING EVERYBODY UP.

1633
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:34,701
IT'S FUCKED UP,

1634
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:34,701
HE DOES THIS SHIT EVERY TIME,

1635
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:37,534
THAT'S WHY I DON'T

1636
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:37,534
PLAY<i> HALO</i> WITH HIM ANYMORE.

1637
00:38:37,534 --> 00:38:39,534
NOW, I'M SURE THERE'S

1638
00:38:37,534 --> 00:38:39,534
SOME PEOPLE HERE

1639
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:40,667
THAT HAVE NEVER PLAYED<i> HALO,</i>

1640
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:42,300
AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE

1641
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:42,300
ANY SENSE,

1642
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,601
SO I WILL GIVE YOU

1643
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,601
AN ANALOGY, OKAY?

1644
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:48,033
IT WOULD BE AS IF YOU'RE

1645
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:48,033
PLAYING MONOPOLY, RIGHT?

1646
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:51,267
AND, UM, SOMEONE ROLLED A 10

1647
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:51,267
AND LANDED ON PARK PLACE,

1648
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:52,968
AND THEN HARRIS CAME IN

1649
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:52,968
WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER

1650
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:55,467
AND BLEW EVERYBODY UP.

1651
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:01,067
LAST TIME

1652
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:01,067
I SPOKE WITH HARRIS,

1653
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:03,467
I SAID, "WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON?"

1654
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:03,467
AND HE SAID,

1655
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:04,901
"I'M APPLYING FOR COLLEGE.

1656
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:09,133
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN HELP ME

1657
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:09,133
WITH MY COLLEGE ESSAYS?"

1658
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:12,834
AND I WAS LIKE, "YES.

1659
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:16,067
"'CAUSE YOU'RE A WEIRDO,

1660
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:16,067
AND WHATEVER YOU'RE GONNA WRITE

1661
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:20,100
"IS GONNA BE INSANE, SO I COULD

1662
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:20,100
READ IT TO PEOPLE IN PUBLIC,

1663
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,267
AND IT'LL HELP ME

1664
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,267
WITH MY JOB."

1665
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:25,300
[cheers and applause]

1666
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,968
SO I BROUGHT ALONG...

1667
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,100
A COPY OF HIS ESSAY.

1668
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,467
AND THIS IS 100% REAL.

1669
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:37,067
THE ESSAY IS TITLED,

1670
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:41,667
"ALL THE SMALL THINGS."

1671
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,367
"TAKE THE THUMB.

00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:45,734
"EVEN THOUGH IT IS

1673
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:45,734
JUST ANOTHER FINGER,

1674
00:39:45,734 --> 00:39:47,501
"IT IS THE MOST ESSENTIAL.

1675
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:48,567
"IT CONTROLS EVERYTHING

IN LIFE TO BE THE SAME WAY."

1681
00:39:54,734 --> 00:39:58,300
ALREADY, THE ESSAY

1682
00:39:54,734 --> 00:39:58,300
MAKES NO SENSE.

1683
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,467

IN YOUR LIFE HAPPENED,

1686
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:04,033
YOU THOUGHT,

1687
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:04,033
"THIS REMINDS ME OF MY THUMB"?

1688
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:07,234
NEVER.

1689
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:07,234
HE GOES ON.

1690
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:11,133
"IT'S ALWAYS THE SIMPLE THINGS

1691
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:11,133

1701
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:31,968
YEAH, THOSE TWO THINGS

1702
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:31,968
ARE COMPARABLE.

1703
00:40:31,968 --> 00:40:35,033
200,000 PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

1704
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,000

1708
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:47,033
A PARTICULARLY

1709
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:47,033
INTERESTING SUMMER

1710
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:49,601
WHERE HE VOLUNTEERED

1711
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:49,601
AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL.

1712
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:52,901
THIS IS HOW HE DESCRIBED

1713
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:52,901
THAT EXPERIENCE.

1714
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:54,868
"I WAS A HUMAN

1715
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:54,868

1716
00:40:54,868 --> 00:40:59,834
AND LET ME TELL YOU,

1717
00:40:54,868 --> 00:40:59,834
IT SUCKED."

1718
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:04,934
YOU CAN'T SAY "IT SUCKED"

1719
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:04,934
IN A COLLEGE ESSAY.

1720
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:07,000
WHEN YOU USE LANGUAGE

1721
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:07,000
LIKE THAT,

1722
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,834
YOU KNOW WHAT

1723
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,834
"IT SUCKS" MEANS?

1724
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,300
YOU'RE REFERRING

1725
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,300
TO SUCKING DICK.

1726
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,734
SO WHAT HARRIS JUST SAID

1727
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,734
IS LIKE, UH,

1728
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:15,734
"HEY, UNIVERSITY,

1729
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:15,734

1736
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:27,100
LATER ON,

1737
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,234
HE TALKS ABOUT A PARTICULARLY

1738
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,234
CRAZY DAY AT THE HOSPITAL.

1739
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:34,200
"A WEEK AFTER I STARTED,

1740
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:34,200
THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.

1741
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,400
"WHEN I SET FOOT

1742
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,400

00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
"IT WAS MORE

00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
CROWDED THAN EVER.

1745
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,100
THERE WEREN'T ANY NURSES

1746
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,100
ASKING ME IF I WANTED COOKIES."

1747
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:47,767
THAT'S HIS GAUGE OF HOW CRAZY

1748
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:47,767
THINGS ARE AT THE HOSPITAL?

1749
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:50,901
"WHY ISN'T ANYONE ASKING ME

1750
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:50,901
IF I WANT COOKIES?

1751
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:56,234
[scoffs] A LOT OF PEOPLE

1752
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:56,234
MUST HAVE CANCER."

1753
00:41:56,234 --> 00:41:58,901
BUT WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY

1754
00:41:56,234 --> 00:41:58,901
WAS HARRIS ENDED UP

1755
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:01,601
MEETING A GENTLEMEN

1756
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:01,601
WHO WAS ILLITERATE.

1757
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:04,434
AND HE'D NEVER MET ANYONE

1758
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:04,434
ILLITERATE BEFORE.

1759
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:06,033
AND THIS REALLY

1760
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:06,033
AFFECTED HIM.

1761
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:08,767
HE DESCRIBED HOW HE FELT

1762
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:08,767
WHEN HE DROVE HOME THAT DAY.

1763
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,801
"I REMEMBERED THINKING

1764
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,801
HOW BIZARRE IT WAS

1765
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:13,868
"THAT SOMEONE

1766
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:13,868
COULD NOT READ.

1767
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:15,334
"WHAT IF I COULDN'T READ?

1768
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:17,968
"I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TEXT

1769
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:17,968

1770
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:23,801
OR EVEN ORDER CHEESE BISCUITS

1771
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:23,801
FROM RED LOBSTER."

1772
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:26,868
THESE ARE THE THINGS

1773
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:26,868
THAT COME TO HARRIS'S MIND

1774
00:42:26,868 --> 00:42:31,934
WHEN HE IMAGINES A WORLD

1775
00:42:26,868 --> 00:42:31,934
WHERE HE CAN'T READ.

1776
00:42:31,934 --> 00:42:34,868
FIRST OF ALL, YOU COULD EASILY

1777
00:42:31,934 --> 00:42:34,868
DO BOTH THOSE THINGS

1778
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:36,300
IF YOU COULDN'T READ.

1779
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,234
I DON'T THINK

1780
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,234
ILLITERATE PEOPLE

1781
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:39,934
SEE MOVIE POSTERS

1782
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:39,934
AND NUMBERS

1783
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:43,701
AND ARE LIKE,

1784
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:43,701
"NO CLUE WHAT THAT MEANS.

1785
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:47,033
CAN'T PIECE THAT

1786
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:47,033
TOGETHER."

1787
00:42:47,033 --> 00:42:50,601
NOW, THE RED LOBSTER THING

1788
00:42:47,033 --> 00:42:50,601
IS WEIRD ALSO,

1789
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,267
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW

1790
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,267
HOW MANY OF YOU ALL

1791
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:53,701
HAVE BEEN

1792
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:53,701
TO RED LOBSTER,

1793
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:55,200
BUT IF YOU'VE BEEN THERE,

1794
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:55,200
YOU KNOW

1795
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,567
NO ONE ORDERS

1796
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,567
THE CHEESE BISCUITS.

1797
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,000
THOSE ARE COMPLIMENTARY.

1798
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,367
THEY JUST SIT 'EM DOWN AT YOUR

1799
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,367
TABLE AS SOON AS YOU GET THERE.

1800
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:04,267
SO WHAT'S HARRIS

1801
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:04,267
TALKING ABOUT?

1802
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:06,067
I'M GUESSING

1803
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:06,067
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

1804
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:08,767
HE FINISHES HIS BISCUITS,

1805
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:08,767
AND HE SEES ON THE MENU IT SAYS,

1806
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:10,868
"IF YOU FINISH YOUR BISCUITS,

1807
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:10,868
FEEL FREE TO ORDER MORE."

1808
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:12,834
HE'S LIKE, "WHEW!

1809
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:12,834
THANK GOD I CAN READ.

1810
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:17,367
MORE BISCUITS, PLEASE!"

1811
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:20,701
SO I TOLD HIM, I SAID, "HARRIS,

1812
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:20,701
YOU CAN'T SEND THIS ESSAY.

1813
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:23,100
IT'S TOO CRAZY.

1814
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:23,100
LET ME DO A REWRITE."

1815
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,901
I DID A REWRITE,

1816
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,901
WHICH HE REJECTED,

1817
00:43:24,901 --> 00:43:27,467
BUT I WILL

1818
00:43:24,901 --> 00:43:27,467
SHARE WITH YOU NOW.

1819
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:29,934

00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:33,133
BUT HE'S ACTUALLY

1862
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:33,133
NOT CHUBBY ANYMORE.

1863
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:34,667
HE HAD A GROWTH SPURT,

1864
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:34,667
AND HE STRETCHED OUT.

1865
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:35,767
HE'S FINE.

1866
00:44:35,767 --> 00:44:37,000
BUT A FEW MONTHS AGO,

1867
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,534
I WAS ACTUALLY WORRIED

1868
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,534
THAT I WAS GETTING CHUBBY.

1869
00:44:38,534 --> 00:44:40,934
I SAW A PHOTO OF ME

1870
00:44:38,534 --> 00:44:40,934
ON THE INTERNET,

1871
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:42,801
AND IN THE COMMENTS,

1872
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:42,801
SOMEONE WROTE,

1873
00:44:42,801 --> 00:44:47,033
"WHOA!

1874
00:44:42,801 --> 00:44:47,033
WHO ATE AZIZ ANSARI?"

1875
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:49,534
WHICH--HOLD ON--

1876
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:49,534
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

1877
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:50,667
IF SOMEONE ATE ME,

1878
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:52,767
THEY WOULDN'T ASSUME MY FORM

1879
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:52,767
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

1880
00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:54,234
"WHY DO YOU LOOK

1881
00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:54,234
LIKE THAT G--"

1882
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:58,033
"I JUST ATE HIM!"

1883
00:44:58,033 --> 00:45:01,367
BUT THE PERSON WAS RIGHT.

1884
00:44:58,033 --> 00:45:01,367
I GAINED 12 POUNDS.

1885
00:45:01,367 --> 00:45:03,434
SO I STARTED

1886
00:45:01,367 --> 00:45:03,434
EXERCISING AT THE GYM,

1887
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,634
LOST THE WEIGHT RIGHT AWAY.

1888
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:05,834
BUT I DIDN'T ALWAYS

1889
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:05,834
LIKE THE STUFF

1890
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:07,133
THE PEOPLE AT THE GYM

1891
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:07,133
WOULD TELL ME.

1892
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:08,367
THEY WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE,

1893
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:10,534
"HEY, AZIZ, YOU SEE

1894
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:10,534
THIS NEW STUDY ON YAHOO NEWS?

1895
00:45:10,534 --> 00:45:12,000
"IT SAYS ANY FOOD

1896
00:45:10,534 --> 00:45:12,000
YOU EAT AFTER 11:00

1897
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,200
"GOES STRAIGHT

1898
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,200
TO YOUR BELLY.

1899
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,300
YOU SHOULD CUT OUT

1900
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,300
THOSE LATE-NIGHT SNACKS."

1901
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,467
AND I WOULD ALWAYS

1902
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,467
WANT TO SAY,

1903
00:45:16,467 --> 00:45:17,634
"OH, REALLY?

1904
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:19,100
"THERE'S THIS OTHER STUDY

1905
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:19,100
I HEARD ABOUT

1906
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,667
"THAT SAYS, UH, IF YOU HAVE

1907
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,667
A LOT OF ALCOHOL IN YOUR SYSTEM,

1908
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:23,767
"AND YOU EAT A QUESADILLA

1909
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:23,767
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING,

1910
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:25,734
"IT'S DELICIOUS.

1911
00:45:25,734 --> 00:45:29,067
"YEAH. I DID THAT STUDY

1912
00:45:25,734 --> 00:45:29,067
LAST NIGHT.

1913
00:45:29,067 --> 00:45:30,567
TWICE."

1914
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:33,634
[cheers and applause]

1915
00:45:35,634 --> 00:45:36,801
BUT I LOVE FOOD.

1916
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:38,901
I LOVE GOING OUT TO EAT

1917
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:38,901
AT RESTAURANTS AND STUFF.

1918
00:45:38,901 --> 00:45:40,367
IT'S REALLY SOMETHING

1919
00:45:38,901 --> 00:45:40,367
I LIKE A LOT.

1920
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:42,601
I WAS EATING AT ONE OF

1921
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:42,601
MY FAVORITE RESTAURANTS

1922
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:44,133
IN NEW YORK

1923
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:44,133
NOT TOO LONG AGO,

1924
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:45,467
AND I WAS HAVING DINNER

1925
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:45,467
WITH A FRIEND,

1926
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:47,167
AND HE'S LIKE,

1927
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:47,167
"AZIZ, WHAT YOU BEEN UP TO?"

1928
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,934
AND I SAID, "SHUT UP.

1929
00:45:48,934 --> 00:45:50,567
"50 CENT IS SITTING

1930
00:45:48,934 --> 00:45:50,567
OVER THERE,

1931
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:53,767
AND I NEED TO HEAR

1932
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:53,767
EVERYTHING HE SAYS."

1933
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:57,200
AND 50 CENT

1934
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:57,200
DID NOT DISAPPOINT.

1935
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,267
50 CENT THE RAPPER

1936
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,267
ORDERED A GRAPEFRUIT SODA.

1937
00:46:01,267 --> 00:46:03,801
THE WAITER BRINGS HIM

1938
00:46:01,267 --> 00:46:03,801
A GRAPEFRUIT SODA.

1939
00:46:03,801 --> 00:46:05,868
AND THEN 50 CENT

1940
00:46:03,801 --> 00:46:05,868
SAID THE GREATEST THING

1941
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:08,934
ANYONE COULD EVER SAY

1942
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:08,934
WHEN THEY SEE A GRAPEFRUIT SODA.

1943
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:11,968
HE LOOKS AT THE WAITER,

1944
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:11,968
AND HE GOES,

1945
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:15,033
"WHY ISN'T THIS PURPLE?"

1946
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,267
AND IT TOOK ME

1947
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,267
A FEW SECONDS,

1948
00:46:21,267 --> 00:46:23,000
AND THEN I REALIZED,

1949
00:46:21,267 --> 00:46:23,000
"OH, MY GOD.

1950
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,033
"50 CENT HAS NO IDEA

1951
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,033
WHAT A GRAPEFRUIT IS.

1952
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,734
"EXCUSE ME, EVERYBODY

1953
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,734
IN THE RESTAURANT, SHUT UP.

1954
00:46:28,734 --> 00:46:30,567
"A WAITER'S ABOUT TO

1955
00:46:28,734 --> 00:46:30,567
EXPLAIN TO A GROWN MAN

1956
00:46:30,567 --> 00:46:33,067
WHAT A GRAPEFRUIT IS."

1957
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:35,167
YOU REALIZE

1958
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:35,167
HOW AMAZING THIS IS?

1959
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,534
THERE ARE PARENTS

1960
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,534
THAT AREN'T THERE

1961
00:46:36,534 --> 00:46:37,901
WHEN THEIR CHILDREN LEARNS

1962
00:46:36,534 --> 00:46:37,901
WHAT A GRAPEFRUIT IS.

1963
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:42,901
I AM THERE FOR THAT MOMENT

1964
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:42,901
IN RAPPER 50 CENT'S LIFE.

1965
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,234
THIS GUY LEAVES

1966
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,234
THE RESTAURANT,

1967
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:47,000
HE'S GONNA KNOW

1968
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:47,000
ABOUT A NEW FRUIT.

1969
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,367
AND THE EXCHANGE

1970
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,367
WAS JUST GLORIOUS.

1971
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:51,434
THE WAITER STRUGGLING

1972
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:51,434
TO EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT

1973
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,934
OF A GRAPEFRUIT TO A MAN

1974
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,934
WHO JUST DIDN'T GET IT.

1975
00:46:54,934 --> 00:46:56,400
HE WAS LIKE,

1976
00:46:54,934 --> 00:46:56,400
"NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1977
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,934
"THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

1978
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,934
GRAPE, GRAPEFRUIT.

1979
00:46:57,934 --> 00:46:58,934
GRAPE, GRAPEFRUIT."

1980
00:46:58,934 --> 00:47:00,801
"I KNOW GRAPES ARE FRUITS.

1981
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:02,567
WHY DO YOU KEEP

1982
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:02,567
SAYING IT LIKE THAT?"

1983
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:05,934
"NO, IT'S JUST ONE WORD.

1984
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:05,934
'GRAPEFRUIT.'

1985
00:47:05,934 --> 00:47:07,267
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST ONE--

1986
00:47:05,934 --> 00:47:07,267
IT'S A DIFFERENT--"

1987
00:47:07,267 --> 00:47:08,534
"I GET IT.

1988
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:12,501
GRAPEFRUIT, APPLEFRUIT,

1989
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:12,501
ORANGEFRUIT, CARROTVEGETABLE."

1990
00:47:12,501 --> 00:47:16,467
"NO. THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL."

1991
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:18,133
AND IT JUST BLEW MY MIND.

1992
00:47:18,133 --> 00:47:20,100
HOW DOES 50 CENT NOT KNOW

1993
00:47:18,133 --> 00:47:20,100
WHAT A GRAPEFRUIT IS?

1994
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,934
THIS GUY'S BEEN RICH

1995
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,934
FOR SO LONG.

1996
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:25,534
HE HAS TO RUN INTO A GRAPEFRUIT

1997
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:25,534
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

1998
00:47:25,534 --> 00:47:26,734
I DO OKAY.

1999
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:31,968
I SEE GRAPEFRUITS

2000
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:31,968
EVERY FUCKIN' DAY.

2001
00:47:31,968 --> 00:47:34,067
WHAT HAPPENS

2002
00:47:31,968 --> 00:47:34,067
WHEN HE SEES A GRAPEFRUIT?

2003
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:38,367
IS HE JUST LIKE...

2004
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:42,300
"WHAT'S UP

2005
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:42,300
WITH THOSE ORANGES?

2006
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,400
"THEY'RE

2007
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,400
ALL RED AND SHIT.

2008
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,634
"AND THEY'RE BIG AS FUCK!

2009
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,634
THEY'RE LOOKING AT ME WEIRD!

2010
00:47:46,634 --> 00:47:51,067
SHOOT THOSE THINGS!"

2011
00:47:46,634 --> 00:47:51,067
[imitates gunfire]

2012
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:57,100
WHEN YOU DO THIS

2013
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:57,100
KIND OF WORK,

2014
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,934
A LOT OF PEOPLE WRITE STUFF

2015
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,934
ABOUT YOU ON THE INTERNET,

2016
00:47:58,934 --> 00:48:00,167
AND SOMETIMES

2017
00:47:58,934 --> 00:48:00,167
PEOPLE WRITE MEAN THINGS.

2018
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:03,133
AND THE SMART THING TO DO

2019
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:03,133
IS JUST IGNORE THAT.

2020
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:05,968
BUT SOMETIMES I WOULD

2021
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:05,968
ARGUE WITH PEOPLE,

2022
00:48:05,968 --> 00:48:07,334
BECAUSE I LIKE ARGUING.

2023
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:08,534
AND I WOULD DO THAT

2024
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:08,534
EVERY NOW AND THEN,

2025
00:48:08,534 --> 00:48:10,300
BUT I RECENTLY PUT AN END

2026
00:48:08,534 --> 00:48:10,300
TO ALL OF IT.

2027
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,467
AND I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU

2028
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,467
GUYS WHAT HAPPENED

2029
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:14,901
THE LAST TIME I GOT

2030
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:14,901
INTO AN ARGUMENT ONLINE.

2031
00:48:14,901 --> 00:48:19,100
IT STARTED WHEN MY EMAIL

2032
00:48:14,901 --> 00:48:19,100
WASN'T WORKING.

2033
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,267
SO I WENT ON MY WEBSITE

2034
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,267
AND I WROTE,

2035
00:48:21,267 --> 00:48:23,400
"IF GMAIL EVEN MESSES UP

2036
00:48:21,267 --> 00:48:23,400
A LITTLE BIT,

2037
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,901
"I GET UPSET.

2038
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,901
IT'S A LITTLE UNREASONABLE,

2039
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:28,200
BUT SERIOUSLY,

2040
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:28,200
SEND MY EMAIL, GMAIL."

2041
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,234
AND THEN A GUY

2042
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,234
WRITES BACK AND SAYS,

2043
00:48:31,234 --> 00:48:34,667
"DUDE, YOU'RE COMPLAINING

2044
00:48:31,234 --> 00:48:34,667
ABOUT A FREE EMAIL SERVICE?

2045
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:36,567

2050
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:46,567
A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE.

2051
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:49,467
SO, I WROTE HIM BACK, AND SAID,

2052
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:49,467
"HEY, MAN, I WAS JOKING,

2063
00:49:01,701 --> 00:49:06,100
AT THIS POINT, I DECIDED

2064
00:49:01,701 --> 00:49:06,100

2065
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,434

TO END THIS ARGUMENT,

2129
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:43,901

2138
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,067

2153
00:51:16,534 --> 00:51:19,567
AND THEN HE WROTE BACK

2154
00:51:16,534 --> 00:51:19,567
AND SAID,

"WHATEVER, YOU JAWA."

2156
00:51:22,334 --> 00:51:24,234
AND I DIDN'T KNOW

2157
00:51:22,334 --> 00:51:24,234
WHAT THAT MEANT.

2158
00:51:24,234 --> 00:51:25,734
I HAD TO LOOK IT UP.

2159
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:29,167
THAT'S A SIGN OF TERRIBLY

2160
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:29,167
INEFFECTIVE RACISM.

2161
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:31,234
YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING RACIST

2162
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:31,234
TO SOMEONE AND THEY'LL GO,

2163
00:51:31,234 --> 00:51:33,067

2166
00:51:38,033 --> 00:51:39,701
IT'S GOTTA BE IMMEDIATE.

2167
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:41,334
BUT I LOOKED IT UP,

2168
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:41,334
AND APPARENTLY "JAWA"

2169
00:51:41,334 --> 00:51:43,334

2174
00:51:46,634 --> 00:51:48,467
I DON'T KNOW.

2175
00:51:46,634 --> 00:51:48,467
IT DOESN'T OFFEND ME.

2176
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:52,267
BUT I LOVE THE IDEA

2177
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:52,267

2178
00:51:52,267 --> 00:51:56,734

2179
00:51:52,267 --> 00:51:56,734
AND REALLY INTO<i> STAR WARS.</i>

2180
00:51:56,734 --> 00:51:59,300
THAT IS

2181
00:51:56,734 --> 00:51:59,300

2182
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,267
I WOULD LOVE TO HANG OUT

2183
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,267
WITH THAT DUDE FOR A WHILE.

2184
00:52:02,267 --> 00:52:04,667
I WOULD GO TO THE MOVIES

WITH HIM WHENEVER I COULD,

2186
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:08,133
BECAUSE AT ONE POINT,

2187
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:08,133
I FEEL LIKE HE WOULD STAND UP

2188
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,467
AND HE'D SAY

2189
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,467

00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,234
I WENT TO A JAY-Z CONCERT

2230
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,234
IN LAS VEGAS FOR NEW YEAR'S.

2231
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:16,701
[scattered cheers]

2232
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:16,701
WHICH WAS--YES.

2233
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:18,501
HE'S A LOT OF FUN.

2234
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:21,767
AND, UH, AFTER THE SHOW

2235
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:21,767
THEY HAD AN AFTER PARTY

2236
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:23,000
FOR EVERYONE THAT WENT

2237
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:23,000
TO THE CONCERT,

2238
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,901
AND IT WAS A LOT OF FUN,

2239
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,901
EVERYONE'S HANGING OUT.

2240
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,334
THEN AT ONE POINT,

2241
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,334
JAY-Z CAME OUT

2242
00:53:27,334 --> 00:53:29,467
BEHIND THE DJ BOOTH

2243
00:53:27,334 --> 00:53:29,467
AND WAS RAPPING ALONG

2244
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:31,434
WITH ALL HIS SONGS,

2245
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:31,434
AND EVERYONE WAS GOING CRAZY

2246
00:53:31,434 --> 00:53:33,100
AND HAVING A GOOD TIME.

2247
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,567
AND JAY-Z BROUGHT

2248
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,567
THE MUSIC DOWN,

2249
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:37,434
AND HE STARTED TALKING

2250
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:37,434
TO THE CROWD.

2251
00:53:37,434 --> 00:53:39,467
AND HE WAS LIKE,

2252
00:53:37,434 --> 00:53:39,467
"HEY, EVERYBODY,

2253
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:40,734
"JUST WANTED TO WISH EVERYBODY

2254
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:40,734
A HAPPY NEW YEAR.

2255
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:42,200
"IT'S A REALLY SPECIAL

2256
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:42,200
NIGHT TONIGHT.

2257
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,834
"WE'VE GOT A LOT OF GREAT

2258
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,834
PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING TONIGHT.

2259
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:45,567
"WE GOT ME, JAY-Z,

2260
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:45,567
IN BUILDING.

2261
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:46,801
"WE GOT BEYONCE

2262
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:46,801
IN THE BUILDING.

2263
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:48,734
WE GOT RIHANNA

2264
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:48,734
IN THE BUILDING."

2265
00:53:48,734 --> 00:53:50,267
AND I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND

2266
00:53:48,734 --> 00:53:50,267
ALAN, AND I WAS LIKE,

2267
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:52,868
"WE GOT AZIZ

2268
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:52,868
IN THE BUILDING."

2269
00:53:52,868 --> 00:53:55,267
AND THEN JAY-Z GOES, "WE GOT

2270
00:53:52,868 --> 00:53:55,267
AZIZ IN THE BUILDING."

2271
00:53:55,267 --> 00:53:58,334
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, SHIT!

2272
00:53:55,267 --> 00:53:58,334
I'M IN THE BUILDING.

2273
00:53:58,334 --> 00:54:01,000
I HAD NO IDEA I WAS

2274
00:53:58,334 --> 00:54:01,000
IN THE BUILDING."

2275
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,133
I'VE NEVER BEEN A PART

2276
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:03,834
OF BUILDING

2277
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:03,834
ANNOUNCEMENTS BEFORE.

2278
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:06,033
NO ONE'S EVER EXCITED ABOUT

2279
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:06,033
ME BEING IN THE BUILDING.

2280
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:08,334
IT'S NEVER LIKE,

2281
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:08,334
"AZIZ IS IN THE BUILDING!"

2282
00:54:08,334 --> 00:54:11,200
IT'S ALWAYS LIKE,

2283
00:54:08,334 --> 00:54:11,200
"AZIZ IS IN THE BUILDING?

2284
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,167
"LET'S GO

2285
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,167
TO ANOTHER BUILDING.

2286
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:18,467
THIS BUILDING'S GOT

2287
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:18,467
REALLY LOW STANDARDS."

2288
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:20,300
SO HE SAID THAT,

2289
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:20,300
AND I WAS LIKE,

2290
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,567
"OH, THAT WAS NICE OF HIM

2291
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,567
TO GIVE ME

2292
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:22,734
A LITTLE SHOUT OUT

2293
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:22,734
OR WHATEVER."

2294
00:54:22,734 --> 00:54:24,434
BUT THAT'S WHEN THINGS

2295
00:54:22,734 --> 00:54:24,434
GOT TERRIBLE.

2296
00:54:24,434 --> 00:54:25,767
'CAUSE RIGHT AFTER

2297
00:54:24,434 --> 00:54:25,767
HE SAID THAT, HE GOES,

2298
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:27,200
"YO, AZIZ, COME UP HERE

2299
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,033
AND TELL EVERYBODY A JOKE."

2300
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:31,400
AND I WAS LIKE,

2301
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:31,400
"AAH, NO!"

2302
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,667
IT'S 4:00 A.M. ON NEW YEAR'S.

2303
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,667
I'M OUT OF MY HEAD.

2304
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:36,334
I'M NOT IN THE CONDITION

2305
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:36,334
TO TELL JOKES.

2306
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:37,300
BUT HE KEEPS PUSHING IT.

2307
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,100
HE'S LIKE, "NO, MAN,

2308
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,100
COME UP HERE

2309
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,434
AND TELL EVERYBODY

2310
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,434
A NEW YEAR'S DAY JOKE."

2311
00:54:41,434 --> 00:54:45,634
A NEW YEAR'S DAY JOKE?

2312
00:54:45,634 --> 00:54:49,200
THAT'S A REALLY

2313
00:54:45,634 --> 00:54:49,200
SPECIFIC REQUEST.

2314
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,834
WHAT WOULD THAT

2315
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,834
EVEN BE?

2316
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:54,567
WHAT DID ONE BIRD SAY

2317
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:54,567
TO THE OTHER BIRD?

2318
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:56,133
"WOW, THIS YEAR

2319
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:56,133
REALLY FLEW BY."

2320
00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:58,501
BACK TO JAY-Z, EVERYONE!

2321
00:54:58,501 --> 00:55:01,567
[laughter and applause]

2322
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:04,634
BUT HE KEPT PUSHING THIS,

2323
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:04,634
AND HE WOULD NOT STOP.

2324
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,734
AND EVENTUALLY,

2325
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,734
I JUST HAD TO GO UP THERE.

2326
00:55:06,734 --> 00:55:08,801
AND I'M GONNA DO MY BEST

2327
00:55:06,734 --> 00:55:08,801
TO RECREATE WHAT HAPPENED

2328
00:55:08,801 --> 00:55:10,968
WHEN I TOOK THE STAGE.

2329
00:55:10,968 --> 00:55:13,968
HE PASSES ME

2330
00:55:10,968 --> 00:55:13,968
THE MICROPHONE.

2331
00:55:13,968 --> 00:55:16,868
"UM...

2332
00:55:16,868 --> 00:55:19,467
"HELLO.

2333
00:55:19,467 --> 00:55:21,634
"OKAY, UH, ONE TIME,

2334
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:24,334
"UM, THIS RESTAURANT--

2335
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:24,334
I WENT TO MY HOUSE--

2336
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:26,567
[forced laughter]

2337
00:55:26,567 --> 00:55:28,601
"THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

2338
00:55:26,567 --> 00:55:28,601
THAT'S NOT--

2339
00:55:28,601 --> 00:55:31,901
"THAT'S NOT HOW THAT ONE GOES.

2340
00:55:28,601 --> 00:55:31,901
[chuckles]

2341
00:55:31,901 --> 00:55:34,000
[yawns]

2342
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,701
"I'M SLEEPY.

2343
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:40,334
HAPPY NEW YEAR."

2344
00:55:40,334 --> 00:55:42,400
AND I GAVE THE MIC

2345
00:55:40,334 --> 00:55:42,400
BACK TO JAY-Z,

2346
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,968
AND THE JIGGA MAN

2347
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,968
WAS NOT PLEASED.

2348
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,567
HE GRABBED THE MIC.

2349
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,567
HE MADE THIS WEIRD FACE.

2350
00:55:47,567 --> 00:55:49,200
HE WAS LIKE...

2351
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,901
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, NO,

2352
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,901
I LET HIM DOWN.

2353
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:52,067
I GOTTA, LIKE, THINK

2354
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:52,067
OF SOMETHING FUNNY."

2355
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:53,133
SO I THOUGHT

2356
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:53,133
OF SOMETHING FUNNY TO SAY.

2357
00:55:53,133 --> 00:55:54,601
AND I REACH BACK

2358
00:55:53,133 --> 00:55:54,601
FOR THE MIC,

2359
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,067
AND HE WAS LIKE, "NO!

2360
00:55:56,067 --> 00:55:57,434
"YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE

2361
00:55:56,067 --> 00:55:57,434
TO BE FUNNY

2362
00:55:57,434 --> 00:55:58,634
AND YOU MISSED IT."

2363
00:55:58,634 --> 00:56:01,868
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, NO!"

2364
00:55:58,634 --> 00:56:01,868
BUT I GET IT.

2365
00:56:01,868 --> 00:56:04,801
'CAUSE JAY-Z IS

2366
00:56:01,868 --> 00:56:04,801
THE SMOOTHEST MAN OF ALL TIME.

2367
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:07,133
HIS LIFE OPERATES

2368
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:07,133
IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN MINE.

2369
00:56:07,133 --> 00:56:09,667
HE CAN'T COMPREHEND

2370
00:56:07,133 --> 00:56:09,667
THE LEVELS OF UNSMOOTHNESS

2371
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:11,267
THAT GO ON WITH ME.

2372
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,734
LIKE, IF JAY-Z SLIPPED

2373
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,734
ON A BANANA PEEL,

2374
00:56:13,734 --> 00:56:15,300
HE WOULD JUST PUT HIS OTHER

2375
00:56:13,734 --> 00:56:15,300
FOOT ON THE BANANA PEEL

2376
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,400
AND SLIDE TO WHEREVER

2377
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,400
HE WAS GOING.

2378
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,601
"MAN, I GOT HERE EVEN FASTER

2379
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,601
THAN I ANTICIPATED.

2380
00:56:19,601 --> 00:56:22,367
HA HA!

2381
00:56:19,601 --> 00:56:22,367
THANKS, BANANA PEEL."

2382
00:56:22,367 --> 00:56:25,033
MY LIFE IS THE OPPOSITE.

2383
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:28,000
MY LIFE IS ME SPILLING MUSTARD

2384
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:28,000
ON MY SHIRT ALL THE TIME.

2385
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,734
JAY-Z IS NEVER GONNA SPILL

2386
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,734
MUSTARD ON HIS SHIRT.

2387
00:56:30,734 --> 00:56:33,400
EVEN IF MUSTARD WAS ABOUT

2388
00:56:30,734 --> 00:56:33,400
TO LAND ON HIS SHIRT,

2389
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,734
SOMEONE ELSE WOULD

2390
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,734
COINCIDENTALLY BE PASSING HIM

2391
00:56:35,734 --> 00:56:37,200
A HOT DOG, AND THE MUSTARD

2392
00:56:35,734 --> 00:56:37,200
WOULD JUST GO,

2393
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,934
"BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP."

2394
00:56:39,934 --> 00:56:41,234
AND HE'D GRAB THE HOT DOG

2395
00:56:39,934 --> 00:56:41,234
AND BE LIKE,

2396
00:56:41,234 --> 00:56:42,801
"YO, MAN, CAN I GET

2397
00:56:41,234 --> 00:56:42,801
SOME MUST--HA HA!

2398
00:56:42,801 --> 00:56:44,567
YOU ABOUT TO TAKE A BITE

2399
00:56:42,801 --> 00:56:44,567
OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST."

2400
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,767
[humming and chewing]

2401
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:52,934
[cheers and applause]

2402
00:56:52,934 --> 00:56:55,033
BEFORE I LEAVE, I WANTED

2403
00:56:52,934 --> 00:56:55,033
TO TALK ABOUT R. KELLY

2404
00:56:55,033 --> 00:56:56,234
FOR A SECOND.

2405
00:56:56,234 --> 00:57:00,634
[cheers and applause]

2406
00:57:00,634 --> 00:57:03,167
UM, WHEN I WAS

2407
00:57:00,634 --> 00:57:03,167
PUTTING TOGETHER

2408
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:05,801
THE MATERIAL FOR THIS SPECIAL,

2409
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:05,801
I WAS THINKING LIKE,

2410
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:07,300
YOU KNOW, I DON'T NEED

2411
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:07,300
TO TALK ABOUT R. KELLY.

2412
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,701
I'VE DISCUSSED HIM

2413
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,701
IN THE PAST.

2414
00:57:08,701 --> 00:57:10,534
NO REASON TO TALK ABOUT HIM

2415
00:57:08,701 --> 00:57:10,534
ANYMORE.

2416
00:57:10,534 --> 00:57:12,167
AND I WASN'T GONNA DO IT.

2417
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:13,534
BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

2418
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:17,334
R. KELLY KEEPS DOING

2419
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:17,334
AMAZING THINGS.

2420
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:20,767
SO I'M VERY CONFLICTED

2421
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:20,767
ABOUT THIS, BUT...

2422
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:23,000
THIS IS WHAT R. KELLY'S

2423
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:23,000
BEEN UP TO.

2424
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
HE PUT OUT A SONG

2425
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
LAST YEAR CALLED<i> ECHO,</i>

2426
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,934
AND IN THE SONG, HE'S TALKING

2427
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,934
ABOUT HOOKING UP WITH A GIRL

2428
00:57:30,934 --> 00:57:34,434
AND TRYING

2429
00:57:30,934 --> 00:57:34,434
TO MAKE HER ECHO.

2430
00:57:34,434 --> 00:57:36,767
THAT'S WEIRD.

2431
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,133
UM, I HAVE NEVER BEEN

2432
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,133
HOOKING UP WITH A WOMAN,

2433
00:57:39,133 --> 00:57:41,100
AND HER BEEN LIKE,

2434
00:57:39,133 --> 00:57:41,100
"AZIZ! AZIZ!

2435
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,701
[trailing off]

2436
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,701

2437
00:57:43,701 --> 00:57:45,734
'CAUSE I WOULD THINK,

2438
00:57:43,701 --> 00:57:45,734
"OH, NO!

2439
00:57:45,734 --> 00:57:50,901
I'M HOOKING UP

2440
00:57:45,734 --> 00:57:50,901
WITH A GHOST."

2441
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:53,367
BUT HE PUT THIS SONG OUT,

2442
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:53,367
AND I GUESS WHAT HAPPENED IS

2443
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:55,534
THERE WERE SOME R. KELLY FANS

2444
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:55,534
THAT DIDN'T KNOW

2445
00:57:55,534 --> 00:57:57,300
WHAT AN ECHO IS.

2446
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,067
SO WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU'RE

2447
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,067
R. KELLY IN THAT SITUATION?

2448
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:00,601
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA POST

2449
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:00,601

2450
00:58:00,601 --> 00:58:01,968

2451
00:58:01,968 --> 00:58:05,734
YES! THAT'S EXACTLY

2452
00:58:01,968 --> 00:58:05,734
WHAT HE DID.

2453
00:58:05,734 --> 00:58:07,868
AND THE VIDEO WENT LIKE THIS.

2454
00:58:07,868 --> 00:58:09,100
HE COMES ON THE SCREEN,

2455
