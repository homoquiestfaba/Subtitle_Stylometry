1
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,143
Don't come here...

2
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,338
Give way! Give way!

3
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,352
Give way!

4
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,001
It's a very lucky omen, sir.
All troubles turn out blissful.

5
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:25,416
But you should be careful with your health.
Fine. Pay for it. Extra two hundred.

6
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,884
Three hundred. Thank you.

7
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,123
You've got a bamboo stick
of a very bad omen for Hong Kong.

8
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,788
Leave it for him!

9
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,458
Does it mean in the coming year, Hong Kong...
It shouldn't be the case. The fortune-teller's said...

10
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:45,630
Hong Kong's in the deepest of the valley...
If we work in unity,

11
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,639
we can definitely get out of the valley.

12
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:28,767
You look tired. You didn't sleep well?
I got many patients last night. I worked until ten.

13
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:33,278
Don't fag next time. Is it worth doing
something harmful to your health?

14
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:39,046
They were nearly finished. Just get the jobs done.
Play tennis this morning? How can I beat you?

15
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,449
Daily exercise's good to health.

16
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,880
No. I'm exhausted after working.
I'd rather sleep than tennis.

17
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:03,671
I've kept an eye on you. You always put
one and a half sachets of sugar into coffee.

18
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,007
Don't you think it's wasteful to
leave the sugar unused?

19
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,742
My parents have diabetes.
So I can't eat too much sugar.

20
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,547
And it's also wasteful if you
force yourself to eat. Right.

21
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,212
But now there's artificial sweetener.

22
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:21,249
Don't you know there're many people starved?
The resource allocation's always uneven.

23
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:27,197
OK, even I don't waste this sachet of sugar, it won't
fall into the hands of the starved people, right?

24
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,263
Both have a point.

25
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,544
Nothing changed, doctor.

26
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:45,910
Still I have bad cough...
Bad cough?

27
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,780
I've told you. Mr. Kan has bronchiolitis.
We've prescribed a nebuliser as a treatment.

28
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,349
Let's check the status.

29
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,191
This is Mr. Kan's X-ray film.

30
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:06,365
The image shows contraction of bronchi.
It could be emphysema.

31
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,672
But as he still has bronchiolitis,
we still prescribe a nebuliser.

32
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:17,341
For emphysema, we can prescribe ventolin or
ß-agonist. Also a large dose of vitamins.

33
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:18,645
Clear?

34
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:26,116
When patients try a nebuliser,
it's easy for the treachea to have allergy.

35
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:32,427
Cos the treachea encounter allergen like
nebulisers; allergy and cough occur easily.

36
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:39,802
So we must be cautious with the dosage.
Before the patients adapt to the medicine,

37
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,601
we can't use a large dosage.

38
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,279
Raise your head, Mr. Kan. Right...
Breath slowly... right...

39
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,439
Breath slowly

40
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:54,816
We go there.

41
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,364
Hong Kong reported the first case
of atypical pneumonia.

42
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,533
Morning, mum. Morning, dad.
Morning.

43
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:15,097
It's still early. Sleep for a while. I call you.
I'm a new comer. I don't want to be late for work.

44
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:20,612
Do you adapt to the new environment?
That's fine. The colleagues are nice.

45
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,480
You work like machines.

46
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,213
I've been on placement in the college.
I can handle it. Don't worry.

47
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:29,882
Viola.

48
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:34,952
The anchor's said in the hospital you worked
there's a patient with atypical pneumonia.

49
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,655
Really? Yes
Such a big trouble.

50
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,724
It's said that this disease spread
rapidly in Guangdong. Yeah.

51
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:47,466
You must be careful, Viola.

52
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,874
If the patients have bad cough,
try to avoid them.

53
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:56,005
Mum if all the nurses avoid the patients,
who looks after them?

54
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,881
It's only a job.
You should think of your safety.

55
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:04,389
The facilities in hospital are sufficient, dad.
Don't worry.

56
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,725
Gotta go to work.
Enough?

57
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,766
I go. Bye. Be careful!
Remember my words.

58
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,539
The rabbits and monkeys fight.
Don't fight. Let's kiss the kids first.

59
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,082
Then it rushes to your side...

60
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,654
Then rushes to your side...
Then to your side...

61
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,385
Go to bed after taking sweets.

62
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,223
Listen to the nurses.
Well.

63
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:47,994
Are you sick, Dr. Li?

64
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,862
It's alright. I have fever.
I bring some medicine for you.

65
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:57,205
No, thanks. I've already taken some.
Go back and take a rest.

66
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,268
No, I'll be OK after a break.
There're so many patients.

67
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:03,873
We only work, not risk our lives.
Let me take a break. I'll be fine soon.

68
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,678
Don't force yourself.

69
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,637
What's the problem? Still have headache?
It's the same. Still got headache.

70
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:28,832
Viola.

71
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:35,011
Viola. Yeah.
Give her a pain-killing injection.

72
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,618
Better today?
It's nearly the same.

73
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,121
Take medicine as per instructions.
You'll be fine.

74
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:45,985
Viola.

75
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,893
Viola. Yeah.
What's the matter, Dr. Chen?

76
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,994
This patient's prescription: The same
as it did last time. OK. Sorry, Dr. Chen.

77
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,701
When I was a novice, I also had a
heart like you. Later... you'll understand.

78
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,113
Why? We're medical workers.
Shouldn't we try our best to help every patient?

79
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:14,277
Yes! We make it.
We work nine hours a day.

80
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:18,984
But we have over a hundred patients.
How much time can we spend on each patient?

81
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:20,820
Just five minutes.

82
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,793
Dr. Li...
Dr. Li!

83
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,737
Dr. Li faints.
What's happening?

84
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,707
He has high fever.
Move him to the bed.

85
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,004
Look out. Go.

86
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,523
Dr. Li fainted this morning.
He has high fever.

87
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:02,763
Rapid test confirms that
he has atypical pneumonia.

88
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:07,670
For this reason, all medical workers
who had close contact with Dr. Li

89
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:14,339
must do chest x-ray immediately. We haven't
known the ways of spreading the disease.

90
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,541
All medical workers must
take the preventive measures.

91
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,609
Wear masks and gloves
when contact the patients

92
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:24,554
to prevent the spread of virus in the hospital.
Any problems? No...

93
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,994
Meeting adjourned.
For the details, I'll issue you a memo.

94
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,261
Dr. Chen, are you tired?
No... nothing.

95
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:14,170
How's Dr. Li going on?
Well, he's fine.

96
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,439
I saw him during lunchtime.
The CXR film shows his lungs look good.

97
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,410
That's great.

98
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:30,011
What's the result, Dr. Liu?
Don't worry. Both of you are negative.

99
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,219
But the medical students led by Dr. Li...
they all have positive test result.

100
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:40,394
And several doctors and nurses of 8A ward...
are confirmed to be SARS infection.

101
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:47,639
It seems that this disease's highly infectious.
It is. So I've requested hostel to self-quarantine.

102
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,641
You know, we face so many
SARS patients every day.

103
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,111
T's very risky. And it's
easy to spread to the family.

104
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,010
I think you should also request hostel.

105
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,008
Dr. Chen, please come to ICU.

106
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:16,132
Haven't seen pneumonia spread so
quickly like this. Why does it go like this?

107
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,105
It's much more horrible than expected.

108
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,094
Doctor... I’m very sick.

109
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,291
All pneumonia patients're very sick.
Rest and will get well soon.

110
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,834
I wanna leave...
Let me go, doctor!

111
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,302
Mr. Kan!

112
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,741
Mr. Kan, what's up?
Press him!

113
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,282
It's OK...

114
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,450
Dr. Chen!
Dr. Chen, Come!

115
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,011
Calm down!
Mr. Kan, don't move.

116
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,995
Calm down!
Press him. Help me!

117
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:24,695
Lie down! Lie down first!
Lie down first.

118
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,466
Press him! Mr. Kan!
No, don't do that.

119
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,805
Mr. Kan...
Lie down first. Calm down.

120
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,572
Lie down...
It's alright. Don't worry.

121
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,732
Why are there so many medical
workers infected by SARS?

122
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,902
It's probably because they had
close contact with the SARS patients.

123
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,929
So they contracted the disease. Does
it mean the preventive measures aren't enough?

124
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:08,170
These are individual cases.
The hospitals have sufficient facilities.

125
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:17,855
In good condition. Disease under control.
And they're likely to recover.

126
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:22,189
I say again: The hygienic facilities and
precautions in hospitals are sufficient.

127
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,526
The disease doesn't spread in
the community. Thank you.

128
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,563
Mr. Lau...

129
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,142
Viola
Mum

130
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,671
What's the matter?
Why don't you let us approach you?

131
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,653
Nothing. Just for the SARS virus spreads through
close contacts with sick people within one metre.

132
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,780
You contracted?

133
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,957
No... But if I infected SARS,
I'd spread the disease to you.

134
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:10,594
What's the life in these days?
I'll take care of myself. Don't worry.

135
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:15,834
Can I? Now the medical
workers are also contracted.

136
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,307
What's happening?

137
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:23,047
It's life-threatening to be
a nurse. You can't go home.

138
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,243
Don't do this job,
Viola. Resign, OK?

139
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,411
No, mum. Don't weep.

140
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:34,381
I stay in the hospital...
just because it's safe.

141
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:40,330
Hospital's not a safe place.
Don't fool me. It's a highly risky place!

142
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,359
Your colleagues haven't get well.
Some are even in ICU.

143
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:51,603
I can't bear this. You know,
even the phone ring gives me scare.

144
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:58,173
I don't know how to... face it.
Listen to me: Resign.

145
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,016
Don't you know...
you're the only daughter in the family?

146
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:07,286
If you have any accident, what
should we do? What should we do?

147
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,919
Mum, don't be like this...
Honey, let me talk to her.

148
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,098
Viola, listen to me. Resign now.

149
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:24,870
No. If all nurses resign,
who takes care of the patients?

150
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,171
Sorry, dad.

151
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,748
Sorry, mum.

152
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:41,487
Viola... I’ve made some soup for you.
I put it here. Bring it back and eat.

153
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,586
Thank you, mum.
Remember to eat them all.

154
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:48,929
Remember: Take care
of yourself. Remember!

155
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,595
Got it.
Bye.

156
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,349
You can't get in...

157
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,089
Dad! Dad!
Let me see him...

158
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,687
Mrs. Kan, calm down please.

159
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,359
Please... please let me see him.
Let me see his corpse.

160
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,426
Sorry, Mrs. Kan.
All the patients dying of SARS...

161
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,303
Their body must be sealed and
cremated immediately. You can't approach it!

162
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:33,572
Why? Why it goes like this?
It's the last chance to see him.

163
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,510
Why can't I take a look at him?
You still have humanity?

164
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:39,073
It's inhumane... Mum, don't...
Mrs. Kan, this is regulation.

165
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:41,617
We can't help you, sorry.

166
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,884
It's inhumane
Let me take a look at him. I see...

167
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,322
Keep an eye on her.

168
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,490
Mum.

169
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,934
Mr. Lau's confirmed
to be SARS infection.

170
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,993
CY, you should understand there're still
many SARS patients in our hospital.

171
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:36,439
And many co-workers have contracted. So we
don't have enough workers to perform the duties.

172
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,942
I think we'd better talk
about your request later.

173
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,071
I understand, so I want to
transfer to another hospital.

174
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,480
Why?
Why?

175
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,417
At first, it was Dr. Li.
Then it went to Dr. Liu.

176
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:53,288
And Mr. Lau, who said the facilities
were sufficient, also contracted SARS.

177
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,258
How can you tell us
to perform the duties?

178
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,693
Don't worry. We can
put the disease under control.

179
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:06,602
No! No... We've lost the
control over the epidemic.

180
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,139
In the morning, Dr. Li was
fine and I chatted with him.

181
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,042
In the afternoon, he was sent
to ICU and incubated.

182
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,911
I see. But the patients
need us to treat for the disease.

183
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:21,316
We treat the patients, right? Several
medical workers take care of one SARS patient.

184
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:26,517
Then they all contract. Is it worth doing?
How could we calculate?

185
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,117
If so, it's hard to do the calculations.

186
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:38,702
Yeah, it is. Today I infected SARS;
you treated me and you contracted.

187
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,366
Tomorrow it's my turn to treat you and you
contracted... I don't know. Can't make it clear.

188
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,501
If we go on like this,
all of us will die!

189
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,880
I'm medical practitioner,
not Aussie battler.

190
00:20:54,386 --> 00:21:03,886
Do me a favour, please. My parents brought
me up and supported me to study medicine.

191
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,930
I can't let them down.

192
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:14,972
Do me a favour. Before I died,
I also want a last chance to see them.

193
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,904
Please.

194
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:21,506
I want to tell you: Medical workers
have their own responsibility.

195
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,574
I know but I just want a transfer.
But we're actually short of staff.

196
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:30,918
Well. If you turn down
my request, I resign.

197
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:42,359
Sigh... I gotta make some manpower
arrangement first. Talk to you later, OK?

198
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,819
Dr. Chen, are you OK?
Anything wrong with me?

199
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,054
You look bad.

200
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,757
I just lost temper in the Chief's office.
It's alright. Go work now.

201
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,099
Ms. Tam, do you get a thermometer?
Yes, here you are.

202
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:26,073
Oh you have fever.
Really?

203
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:28,943
Thanks.

204
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:38,040
Dr. Chen...
Dr. Chen faints! Nursing Officer!

205
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:47,978
Let me help you.

206
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,120
Drink some water.

207
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,767
Thanks.

208
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,509
Dr. Chen, you'll get well soon.

209
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:25,653
I wanted to transfer to another
hospital. But it's too late.

210
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:31,360
We medical workers
shouldn't worry too much.

211
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:33,826
You don't fear?

212
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:43,103
What's the matter?
Actually...

213
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:50,307
my parents worry about me very much...
They told me to resign.

214
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,280
What do you think?

215
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:04,661
I wanna be a nurse just for helping patients.
If I resign right off,

216
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,525
it seems that I flee from the battle field.

217
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:19,209
Your parents brought you up,
they don't want you suffer.

218
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,740
Me too.

219
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:34,015
Lf... they all contracted the disease,
you'd feel sorry, wouldn't you?

220
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,827
But isn't it too selfish?

221
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:48,464
Listen to me...
Don't hesitate...

222
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:53,204
I don't want...
you'd be the next patient.

223
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,984
Nursing officer, what's the matter?
Dr. Chen's suddenly in critical condition.

224
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,330
Check blood pressure!

225
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,763
Hold on, Dr. Chen.
We're here. You'll be fine.

226
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,828
What's his BP?
BP 70 over 50, pulse 140.

227
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:59,138
Check again!
BP 66 over 45, pulse150.

228
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,604
Vital signs?
He's getting weaker.

229
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:03,272
Tube!

230
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:14,820
Again.

231
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,898
Gonna flatline!
Paddles!

232
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,240
Dr. Chen, hold on.

233
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:37,979
Clear!

234
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,050
Dr. Chen.
Clear!

235
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,251
Hold on.

236
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,057
What should we do?

237
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,793
Clear!
Dr. Chen...

238
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,831
The Hospital Authority invites
two Guangdong Chinese Medicine professors

239
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:06,639
to introduce new treatment for SARS

240
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:13,649
OK. We integrate the western and Chinese
medicines as alternative clinical treatment

241
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:17,051
to cure SARS and prevent
the spread of the disease.

242
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,684
Yes, Chinese medical
practitioners have much

243
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,592
experience in this treatment and
we got many formulas.

244
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,275
Sweet pea, mum's coming home.
Be a good girl. Listen to dad.

245
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:48,143
I wish every patient and colleague
recover and reunite with the family soon.

246
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,452
Sorry, mum; sorry dad.
I haven't resigned

247
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,219
cos I think...

248
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,786
every patient needs our care.
Each medical worker is vital in this battle.

249
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:02,799
But I promise you: I'll take care of
myself. And come back to have dinner with you.

250
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:11,175
First of all, I thank my colleagues.
When I was deadly ill,

251
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:15,338
they were great... they
faced me... and saved me.

252
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,146
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

253
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:30,619
My colleagues and I do... try our best to
treat every patient for the disease.

254
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,526
And we shall overcome SARS.

255
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:38,397
Doctors, I back you up!
Hip, hip, hurray!

256
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,705
Several suspected SARS
patients admitted, doctor.

257
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:33,682
Bro, you come to see me?

258
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,922
Yeah, open the door. Quick.
I gotta go to the toilet.

259
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:04,553
News headline Today new SARS cases
at Amok Garden are confirmed again.

260
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:09,525
Two victims live in Block E. One is
twenty-nine and the other is thirty-five.

261
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,587
And a 4-member family also contracted
the disease. Martin, what're you doing?

262
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:18,602
I... have a meeting. How about you?
I don't tell you.

263
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:23,505
Have you bought my birthday present?
Your birthday's our love anniversary.

264
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:28,205
I won't forget. Really?
Then I wait for your present.

265
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:33,808
And you make the schedule of
the events. Alright. I've made it.

266
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:40,654
We'll see the night scenery of Victoria Harbour
while we enjoy the candle-light dinner.

267
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,488
Do you like French cuisine?

268
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:47,621
Who tell you to let me know before
my birthday? No surprise for my birthday.

269
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,361
Have you had dinner? Or we...

270
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:56,871
Sorry. I gotta work overtime.
I can't eat dinner with you.

271
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,432
I'm busy. Call you later.
Bye.

272
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,241
Martin... Hello...

273
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,320
Morning.

274
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:21,592
Morning.

275
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,548
Wendy, please come in.

276
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,515
Put on the mask, please.

277
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:00,960
Sit down. Thanks.
Take some precautions...

278
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,998
It's routine.
Never mind.

279
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:11,208
Well... You're granted
a ten-day holiday.

280
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:15,776
Effective immediately...
You may take a break.

281
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:20,790
Please don't mind this arrangement.
You know... the SARS epidemic's serious.

282
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:26,819
And you live in Amok Garden.
To allow our colleagues to work lightly,

283
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:32,859
we hope you take a leave.
Man will take over your work.

284
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:36,668
We don't discriminate
against you... I know. Thanks.

285
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,336
Thanks for your cooperation.
You may transfer your work to Man.

286
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,112
Have a nice holiday.

287
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,892
What's the matter?
Give way. Disinfection.

288
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:11,301
Martin, I'm on vacation.
What happens?

289
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:16,074
Boss said I live in Amok Garden. They fear...
I spread the virus, so they granted me a holiday.

290
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,647
They did?
Yes.

291
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,845
I'm on holiday for
ten days. Let's travel.

292
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:25,548
Travel? You're kidding! How can I
take a leave to travel with you?

293
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,888
Don't let me down, Martin.
Ten days! How can I kill the time alone?

294
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,053
I call you later. That's it.

295
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:36,724
Wait. Hello? Martin...
It's a bit much!

296
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:20,008
I'm not available right now.
Please leave your message.

297
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:33,317
Don't press it, Mike. There're a lot of germs!
Follow me: Press the button with a toothpick.

298
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:34,516
Got it?

299
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,122
Yeah, use toothpick.

300
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,224
Ms. Li, you're sick?
Gotta go far away from us.

301
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:48,967
Right. You'll spread the disease to others.
Or wear more masks. Such a wicked person.

302
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,806
Or call an ambulance to
send you to hospital. Such a fart!

303
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,645
I don't take this lift.
Give way!

304
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:03,651
Henry!

305
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:08,982
Faggot! The toothpick is
used to press the buttons, not bite.

306
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,724
Rinse your mouth after getting into the flat,
OK? Brush your teeth and rinse with disinfectant.

307
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,794
What's the matter? Hello. I come to inform
you... the Government has decided

308
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,166
to move all E block residents
to the quarantine camp.

309
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:25,666
Please pack your luggage.
We'll inform you later.

310
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,472
How many days?
Ten days.

311
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,375
Ten days?

312
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:04,974
Oh, where're the crotchet hooks?

313
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:14,087
Please... please give way.
Sorry... please give way.

314
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:17,321
Sorry. Please.
Give way...

315
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,474
Aunt Sun.
Don't worry.

316
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,244
The residents committee organises
a 10-day tour for us.

317
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:45,154
Fresh air in the camp site.
Good for morning exercise.

318
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:56,825
Hi I live on the nineteenth floor.
My name's Henry. What's your name?

319
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:57,993
Wendy.

320
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,997
The number you dialled is temporarily
disconnected. Please try again later.

321
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:20,722
Welcome to this...
ten-day 'compul-luxry tour'.

322
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:28,698
We'll live in the five-star camps. With
beautiful scenery and peaceful environment.

323
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,394
No one answer you even
you shout, I guarantee.

324
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:40,670
And there's a special audio system. How special?
You'll hear your neighbour with this system.

325
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:45,739
If you're bored, you may listen to your
neighbour. Enjoy the holiday here, OK?

326
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,249
Be happy!

327
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,959
Sorry. I got a call.

328
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:04,563
Hello? Speaking. I'm on the way
to the quarantine camp.

329
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,001
OK. I'll take care of myself.

330
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:13,567
Call you every morning, OK?
OK... talk to you later. Bye.

331
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:52,511
There's no sheet.
Only a mattress provided. But it's wet.

332
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:56,747
How can we sleep? Right!
Where's the toilet? Let's have a look.

333
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:57,810
Let's go.

334
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,290
No TV?
Poor facilities. Really poor!

335
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,426
Have you brought playing card?
No.

336
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,491
Go see if the neighbours
bring the mahjong. Let's go.

337
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,550
Morning!
Morning!

338
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,024
Morning! Morning! Breakfast time!

339
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:47,069
VCD for amusement!
Thanks...

340
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,970
Wash hands before
eating. C'mon.

341
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:57,312
What's the matter? I haven't brought
the charger. Our model is the same.

342
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:00,873
Have you got an extra
battery? I've only got one.

343
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:01,940
Forget it.

344
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,317
Well... you take my
battery first. Thanks.

345
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:12,151
And I recharge yours.
I'll return you later. Thanks.

346
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:13,662
Welcome.

347
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:20,462
Have you had breakfast?
Or I give you a ride to canteen.

348
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,868
Hurry!
Why so hurry?

349
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,208
Take more water.
Two bottles more.

350
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,209
Take it.

351
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,084
What? How can you
put the mask in this way?

352
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,124
It doesn't matter.
You should put it in the bag.

353
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,783
I don't really care.

354
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:53,398
Martin... answer the call. I'm not available
right now. Please leave your message.

355
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:57,096
Hurry. Answer...

356
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:01,206
What's that? Glutinous rice dumpling?
You think we're beggars. I don't eat it!

357
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,741
Even beggars don't eat this kind of things!
What the hell place is!

358
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:09,513
No desk for my son to do the homework.
No TV. Like a prison.

359
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,282
I can't sleep if I don't watch TV.

360
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,872
Lunch time.
Haven't seen you in the canteen.

361
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:58,796
Sorry. I'm looking for the
woollen thread. What's the matter?

362
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,669
Nothing. Haven't seen you in
the canteen. So I come see you.

363
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,207
I lose appetite.

364
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,743
Can you help me to do something?
What's that?

365
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,473
Do something happy.

366
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:13,372
Sit down.

367
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:23,221
Why do you bring so many things? Stay
here for ten days. Without amusement, it's boring.

368
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:27,086
What do you want?
Come here.

369
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,265
Draw something on the masks.

370
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,838
Sit down. I tell you.
Draw something on the masks?

371
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:42,369
If we write some encouraging words
or draw pictures on the masks,

372
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:46,041
the kids and elderly will find it funny
to wear masks. They won't be so bored.

373
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,549
Let's try. C'mon.

374
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:58,455
What're you doing? Just make
a set of mahjong to Aunt Sun.

375
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,760
She told me she's extremely bored.
These are mahjong?

376
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:05,359
This is character four.
This is one dot.

377
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:06,801
Let's try. Make more.

378
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,116
Quick...

379
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:28,584
I'm not available right now.
Please leave your message.

380
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:32,095
Hurry. It's your turn...
Go. Next... yeah.

381
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:33,994
Good!

382
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:42,361
What's wrong?
Nothing. It's raining.

383
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:48,400
Well... it's only raining. Don't be so miserable.
Like you? Always laugh?

384
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,713
Of course, it's happy in the sunny days. But
you don't need to be desolate in the rainy days.

385
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:55,809
Look at them.

386
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:03,720
There're two sides of a coin.
It's you who choose to be happy or sad.

387
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:08,060
Things doesn't change no matter you're
happy or not. So I must choose 'happy'.

388
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:09,121
Remember.

389
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,734
Coming!

390
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:50,373
What's wrong?
Stomachache.

391
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,000
Are you OK?
Watch out!

392
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,044
Get up. Lean on the wall.

393
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,773
Did you eat something dirty?
Should I send you to the doctor?

394
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:58,837
No.

395
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:04,752
Haven't reached you nor seen
you in the canteen. Are you OK?

396
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,585
Nothing. I've taken some drugs.

397
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:12,086
Where's my cell phone?
Cell phone?

398
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,053
Here it is.

399
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,036
Today's my birthday.

400
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:22,935
It's the fifth day...

401
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,699
He hasn't called me.

402
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,708
Does he see me as his girlfriend?

403
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:43,120
Don't be like this.
Maybe he's too busy. Don't weep.

404
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:48,324
Night scenery, French cuisine...
All are fake.

405
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:57,396
Don't weep.
It's unlucky to weep on the birthday.

406
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:06,106
Don't weep. Be good...
I've made...

407
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,777
I've made you some birthday presents. I don't
want them! You see. So many presents.

408
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,149
Take away...

409
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:16,159
Take some. No...
I don't want them.

410
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,853
Go away.

411
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:46,448
Please come in.

412
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:51,049
You bring me here for what?
It must be something good.

413
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,120
Here's canteen. Anything good?
Wait a minute. You'll know soon.

414
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:01,693
Henry, where're you?
Don't play the game!

415
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:06,072
Henry!
Come out.

416
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,167
Ma'am.

417
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:09,537
What're you doing?

418
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,677
This way.

419
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:33,098
Martin's sick, so he can't speak to you. But
he's reserved a table in this French restaurant

420
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,334
as remedy of missing your birthday.
Look. It's beautiful.

421
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:41,867
Sea view and moonlight.
It's a romantic.

422
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,505
Please try our house wine.

423
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,248
Well try the appetizer first.

424
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:58,920
It's Foie Gras Saute.
Isn't it a luncheon meat?

425
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:03,456
Don't see it with contempt.
It's much more rare than Foie Gras in the camp.

426
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:07,401
I used a whole set of VCD to trade.
Let me have a try. Just one minute.

427
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:10,338
Let me tell you what the main course is.
Fine.

428
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:18,472
Salmon in French style.
Salmon? It's canned tuna. Where do you get it?

429
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:23,747
From Aunt Sun. I played mahjong for
eight round with her. You must cheat her.

430
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:28,553
No, I lost the games on purpose. Lf not,
would she give me her private canned tuna?

431
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:32,752
Let me try it. Wait.
I tell you what's the dessert.

432
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,797
It must be...
It's souffle.

433
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:41,463
It's easy. I used a gameboy to trade.
Enjoy them.

434
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,936
I'm the chef. Don't worry.

435
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,507
Henry, can I take my doll away?

436
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:57,315
I go to bed now.
I can't sleep without it.

437
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,322
Sorry... it’s my fault. Sorry.
Go to bed now.

438
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,153
Go back.
Sorry.

439
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,826
It's OK without a imitated Martin.
I imitate Martin.

440
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:13,999
Happy Birthday, Wendy.

441
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:26,015
No. Be the real you.

442
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:30,885
Then... Happy birthday.
Thank you.

443
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,517
Eat them.

444
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,926
Try the carrots. They're fresh.
I haven't cooked them.

445
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:51,739
It's me who cut the cucumbers. You're
so attentive. You must be a good boyfriend.

446
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:55,141
I haven't got a girlfriend.
You mean the lady talked to me on the phone?

447
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:59,011
It's my mum. She runs a
restaurant in Shenzhen.

448
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:02,842
I buy you dinner after
leaving the camp. Sounds great.

449
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:25,207
Hello. Sunshine on your ankle.
You just wake up?

450
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,709
Yeah. I call you immediately.

451
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:32,848
Well, see you in the
canteen thirty minutes later. Bye.

452
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,260
Morning, mum.

453
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:38,502
News about the atypical pneumonia.
Today 56 new SARS cases are confirmed.

454
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:43,137
The total number of the cases is 604.
And 6 new cases of death are reported today.

455
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:48,981
The age is between 25 and 58.
Only one case is resident of Amok Garden.

456
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:52,218
Poor! The young guy also
infected with the disease...

457
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:55,657
Yeah. I just think only the
elderly will contract

458
00:54:56,226 --> 00:55:02,426
Now even the young guys can't
resist the disease. Yeah. Who's so poor?

459
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,271
Ma'am, you can't get in!

460
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,341
Where's Henry?
Ma'am, you can't come in!

461
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,076
Where's Henry? Please get out!

462
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:25,918
What's the matter? He was sent to the
hospital this morning. What happens?

463
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,720
He had high fever last night. The officers
suspected that he has atypical pneumonia.

464
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,385
He's under observation for SARS.

465
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:16,395
Henry...

466
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:18,933
Sunshine on your ankle.

467
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,397
Are you OK?

468
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:28,534
I worry about you.
I really worry about you...

469
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:38,184
It's you who gave me the helping hand.
When I fell down, you gave me the helping hand.

470
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:45,755
I'm afraid I can't see you again.
I'm afraid I can't see you any more.

471
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:50,596
Silly girl. I just contract
atypical pneumonia.

472
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:53,636
But I'm young. It'll be OK.

473
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,571
You forget what I said? There're two
sides of a coin. Don't weep, OK?

474
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,942
Don't weep, silly girl.

475
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:13,514
It's you who're silly.
It's two o'clock...

476
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,854
Who can see the sun?

477
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:19,383
It is?
I used to call you when I woke up.

478
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,020
I haven't check the time.

479
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:28,670
Don't weep. You leave the
quarantine camp tomorrow. Free again.

480
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:37,773
I miss you...
I really miss you.

481
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,714
I miss you...

482
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:57,697
It's me, Martin.
What's the matter, Wendy?

483
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,827
I got something to talk with you.
Let's have lunch.

484
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:03,839
Lunch?
Aren't you under quarantine?

485
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:07,035
The quarantine period's over.
I'm at home.

486
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:11,910
Then you should take a rest first. And...
we meet next week, OK?

487
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:15,678
You don't want to see me again?
Alright. Let me talk to you now.

488
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:19,051
I don't want to be your girlfriend.
We break up.

489
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:22,819
Wendy can you stop losing temper?
What do you want?

490
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:27,090
I mean it.
Don't call me any more. Bye.

491
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:28,221
Wendy!

492
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:48,114
Morning, Henry.
You're at home, Wendy?

493
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,618
I'm at the bus stop outside the hospital.
You can see me if you come out.

494
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:07,767
I leave the camp. How about you? When'll
you be discharge? Dunno. I'll try my best.

495
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:11,500
Hurry up. You promise to bring
me to your mum's restaurant.

496
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:15,408
I can make it.

497
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:18,914
Can you promise me
one more thing? What?

498
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:22,008
Promise me:
Call me every morning.

499
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:27,847
Alright.
But you also promise me one thing:

500
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:30,222
Don't weep again.

501
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,558
With you,
I won't weep again.

502
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:37,794
OK. I promise you.
When the sunshine's on your ankle,

503
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,425
I call you.

504
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:50,770
Well. Go back and
I call you tomorrow.

505
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,413
Bye. Bye.

506
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:13,125
Bro Hung, congratulation.
Wish you good business! Cheers!

507
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:18,606
My business is always fine. Please
be seated... Don't get into a fuss.

508
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:23,043
Try my Boston aerobic lobsters.
The lobsters spring like the aerobic dancers.

509
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:28,277
For vegetarian, try ambrosia.
In Greek mythology, gods

510
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:32,014
eat nothing but this stuff. You needn't
go to Mt Olympus now. Taste it here.

511
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,816
Bro Hung, isn't it a bit of hype?
No!

512
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:39,692
You know. Wanna earn your bread?
You have to bluff, sham and hype up.

513
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:42,697
Hype comes last.
That's not much of a hype.

514
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:45,256
Yes. Bro Hung,
what comes next to your mind?

515
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:48,826
Listen, I'll open a tourist agency next week.
I'll treat you guys to the global tour!

516
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:50,964
Thanks!

517
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,136
You're welcome... Once my dream
comes true at the end of the year,

518
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,475
You'll be grateful.
What's your dream?

519
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:01,313
I'd like to...
open a funeral home.

520
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,477
Terrific...

521
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,490
It's the so-called through-train service.
Eat and play,

522
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,321
dead or alive, all on me.

523
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:13,719
That's too good to be true, Bro Hung. My mom
has got leukaemia and was sent to the hospital.

524
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:16,264
A leukaemia patient cannot
last so long. Your mom...

525
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:43,451
Bro. I know you're with this
guy when I can't see you home.

526
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:45,494
Ling, you're here?

527
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,397
You're drunk. Go home.

528
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:55,063
What're you doing, dude?
Sell weeds again?

529
01:02:55,138 --> 01:03:02,203
A dime a dozen, can you earn a living? Can
you make a good living with the chicken feed?

530
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,578
You even give out banlangen tea for free?
Do you know what business is?

531
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,139
Let me show you.

532
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:13,314
Seeing the outbreak of SARS,
I made the banlangen tea for the neighbors.

533
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:17,723
Wanna marry him?
Why not marry the guy opposite?

534
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,628
Look down, the one with long hair.
Not the gold-haired one.

535
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:24,291
Very long and tangled hair... The guy
with eight pouches... I mean the beggar.

536
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:27,768
Bro, don't go too far!
Pong, leave him alone.

537
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:31,933
It's OK. He's drunk.
Would you see him home?

538
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:33,600
Call you later.
I go now.

539
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:39,274
Bye. No need to see me home!
See your banlangen tea.

540
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:40,406
Goodbye.

541
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:52,327
Still mad at me?
You really went too far.

542
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,831
Am I wrong? Selling
herbs makes no money.

543
01:03:55,898 --> 01:04:00,392
You think you're someone? If you haven't
won the Mark Six, we're no more than hawkers.

544
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,666
We've been poor. So, I don't
want you to suffer anymore.

545
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:07,573
Pong's a nice guy. I'm happy with
him. Don't poke your nose into my affairs.

546
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:12,012
You'll suffer if you turn a deaf ear
to my warning. Go now!

547
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,447
Hello.

548
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:25,017
Would you like to dine... with my boss? Do me
a favor, please. My boss wants to dine with you.

549
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:32,023
Would you... Don't give me
a hard time. I'm just a small potato.

550
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:36,868
You know life is hard.
Say yes please. I'll call my boss.

551
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,740
Thanks.

552
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:49,309
Mr Lam, what does SARS
to do with your business?

553
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,752
I sell no pig lung. What does it to do
with me? I'll open more branches!

554
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:58,117
But the business of karaoke lounge is slumping.
The turnover of your competitors drops by 70%%% .

555
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,092
They are planning to
close down their business.

556
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:03,427
They close their business, not mine.
I'll take over their shops.

557
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,095
But the turnover of your karaoke
lounges slumps by 90%%% .

558
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:09,934
Who said that?
Slump? Impossible.

559
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,598
Why I've never heard of that?

560
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:16,202
The newspapers said that.
Which one? Impossible!

561
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:17,712
Jackie Chan...

562
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:25,781
Are the reporters right?
Yes.

563
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:28,346
Why not told me before?
I've told you long ago.

564
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:31,416
Where?
At the restaurant last week.

565
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:35,430
Restaurant? I can hear nothing when drunk.
Why not told me when I fall asleep?

566
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:39,798
No, boss. You were not drunk.
You were talking on phone.

567
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,302
Talking on phone?

568
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,763
No business at all now?

569
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:51,075
We've got business, but it drops by 90%%% .
Some branches drop by 80%%% .

570
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:55,174
We've got business then.
I think SARS will be over soon.

571
01:05:57,019 --> 01:06:03,948
Yet... We gotta...
take action to deal with SARS.

572
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:07,757
Let's begin with the pay cut.
Let me jot it down.

573
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:13,900
But... boss, how do you cut the pay? The more
the turnover drops, the more pay to be cut.

574
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,906
The turnover drops by 90%%% . Cut the pay
by 90%%% . Then, sack the workers.

575
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:22,240
Who will be sacked?
Sack the grumblers first.

576
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,871
Then, sack those who work for less than
three months. Sack the pregnant women.

577
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:27,381
Sack the ugly ones.
Sack the ugly ones?

578
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:30,809
And sack the tall ones.

579
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,480
Boss, only a few staff
will be left in our company.

580
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:38,459
Why so many staff? Poor business
needs fewer staff. I like it quiet... Quiet...

581
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:43,592
Have you called Ling for me?
You haven't called her?

582
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,260
Yes, I have.
But she doesn't reply.

583
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:52,400
I'll treat her to a meal of abalone mushroom.
Why doesn't she reply? What's wrong?

584
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:55,239
Boss, what abalone?

585
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:57,677
Abalone mushroom,
have you seen that?

586
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:01,410
Never.
Is it a bit of hype?

587
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:05,750
Not abalone. It's mushroom.
Mushroom?

588
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:09,587
Someone treated me to a meal of caviar.
It turns out to be sesame paste!

589
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:11,785
So I treat her to a meal
of abalone mushroom.

590
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:20,765
What time is it?
One o'clock.

591
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:23,964
Day or night?
Day.

592
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,669
Not a soul in the daytime?
Manager, come over here!

593
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:32,044
Boss, would you like something
to eat? Bullshit. You see.

594
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:35,277
Boss, SARS is raging now.
Everyone fears to be infected when dining out.

595
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:38,252
What's with you?
SARS, I fear to be infected.

596
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,720
You've scared away all my diners!
Take it off!

597
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,652
Boss, we gotta get some gimmicks.

598
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:49,457
How?
What are you doing?

599
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:50,863
Racking my brains.

600
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:54,391
You can take my post if you can make it.
You needn't be a manager anymore.

601
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:55,732
Get out of my face.

602
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:03,809
Boss, let's try one dollar meal.
50%% % discount for the senior.

603
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:08,714
Buy garoupa, get lobster free.
You can only make it with something special.

604
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:13,949
But...
Think something to do with my business.

605
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:17,823
Like...
Clients of our travel agency...

606
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:21,090
enjoy their meals here for free on the trip.

607
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:25,592
Can they enjoy their meals here on the trip
outside? So, that wouldn't cost me a dime.

608
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:31,873
The gimmick of boss, I got it.
Or the customers of our karaoke lounge...

609
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:37,072
dine here for free at midnight. We close
at 11 o'clock. No dinners offered at midnight.

610
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:43,710
Awesome...
Dine here at seven thirty evening,

611
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:49,053
get five matinee tickets of that
day free. As souvenirs only.

612
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:53,653
OK... Any more? For the cinema,
I'd like to suggest...

613
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:58,098
that... for the two thirty matinee,
buy one cinema ticket, get one airline ticket free.

614
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,931
I'll be broke. You won't.
The ticket is to Shenzhen.

615
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:05,099
There's no flight to Shenzhen.
The tickets'll not take effect until there's one.

616
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:07,540
Terrific!
Such gimmicks are cruel.

617
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,840
Damn the guy who
thought up those gimmicks.

618
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,642
Boss, those're your own ideas.

619
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,110
How much is the turnover?

620
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:18,141
Five grand odd.
Five grand odd?

621
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:23,453
It was fifty grand odd for a branch before.
Only tenth now. Which one? Close it down.

622
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:26,723
Not one. The sum of eight
branches is five grand odd.

623
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:29,992
Eight branches? Too bad.
Too bad.

624
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,532
Close down all branches.
That's even worse.

625
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:36,935
The sum of severance payment for eight
branches... is more than that for opening them.

626
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:42,273
Or...
In the name of renovation,

627
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:46,781
tell the staff to go home.
Reinstate them when we restart our business.

628
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:52,219
I've told them. They said...
they're no fool.

629
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:56,384
Sharing my troubles is caring.
They said you never share with them your money.

630
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,018
Who's that cocky?
Everyone.

631
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,390
Let me talk with you.
Didn't you wanna be a boss?

632
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:06,456
Let me sell all eight branches to you.

633
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:10,699
No kidding, boss.
Can you last with five grand a day?

634
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:12,001
Come up with something.

635
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:18,870
Tell them to move our branches.
Move to Amok Garden.

636
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:21,712
See if they dare to work there.
Sack the absentees.

637
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:26,414
Boss, moving to Amok Garden costs a lot.
The banks trust me. Borrow from them.

638
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:27,580
No problems then.

639
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:33,390
Mr Lam, you're our long-term client.
We know you do very big business.

640
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:36,488
But SARS is affecting the economy.
The banks are prudent in making loans.

641
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:40,865
And all your business is affected by SARS.
All belongs to the troubled industries.

642
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:42,164
What's more, all your
properties are under mortgage.

643
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,436
You haven't pay off
your mortgage payments.

644
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:48,305
Your request for loan...
Save your breath!

645
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:52,780
I don't want to spend money
spilling kerosene on your door!

646
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:54,679
OK... Don't be mad, sir.
I see you out...

647
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:58,243
Check us out later, sir. Sorry...

648
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:04,816
Hello. Wait.
Boss, Auntie Silly's calling you.

649
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,197
Auntie Silly, what's up?
Hung, something's wrong with my son.

650
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,790
Who?
Henry.

651
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:14,335
What?
SARS!

652
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:16,371
Congratulation.
What...

653
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:19,703
You can save your grub for your son.
You know, studying in university costs you a lot.

654
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:24,644
You can save a lot now. And there's a
saying goes/SARS brings you riches.

655
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:28,114
The government'll pay for your loss.
No, I wanna borrow money from you.

656
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:30,481
I'm poorer than you.
How can I lend you money? That's that.

657
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,317
Boss...
What boss?

658
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:36,119
Mr Lam!

659
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,228
Bro Hung!
What's your hurry?

660
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,285
You wanna escape me?

661
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:44,332
That's not the case. The dishes're not
enough. So I tell them to bring in more.

662
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,460
American steak, African antelope...

663
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:50,801
Save it. Pay my bills.
Seafood bill.

664
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:54,104
We sell no seafood for long.
Where comes the bill?

665
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:57,441
What's this? So fresh.
And more...

666
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:59,572
Fee for renovation.
You've never paid me a dime.

667
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:02,310
I did pay you.
I've given the money to the manager.

668
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:05,842
How about the red wine bill?

669
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:08,651
I warn you... Stop your show.
Pay me off now.

670
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:12,524
Or we'll stay here for good!
And if you don't pay off your debts,

671
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:16,052
we'll have breakfast, lunch and dinner
here. I take the meals as interest, OK?

672
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:17,758
Got it?

673
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,230
Go ahead!
Gulp!

674
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:27,938
Bro Hung.

675
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:35,717
I've counted it.
You sell your properties off cheap...

676
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:39,948
together with the severance payment...
There's 15 million left.

677
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,014
It's OK. I can turn
a new leaf with the money.

678
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:47,859
No. You have 15 million left to pay.
Can't you speak it straight?

679
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,501
Boss, have you thought of
applying for bankruptcy?

680
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:57,835
I'll have no face if I go bankrupt.
If Ling learns that...

681
01:12:57,906 --> 01:13:00,898
Oh, Ling has made you a reply.
What did she tell you?

682
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:02,204
She tell you to go to hell.

683
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:06,670
Actually,
she made a good suggestion.

684
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:09,980
I fear no death, but who
looks after my sis then?
I.

685
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:10,984
Go to hell.

686
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,819
No, boss. My death
won't help, but yours will.

687
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:19,190
You're insured. Lf you die,
the insurance company will pay your sister.

688
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:21,821
But that's not for
the case of suicide.

689
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:25,355
Accident insurance doesn't cover
suicidal cases. But life insurance does.

690
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,571
Is this the best way out?

691
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:39,205
According to this book,
The maximum fatality is five. It's got four.

692
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:41,306
The torture of it is only one.

693
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:46,649
Highly recommended?
Yes, you've got the right place.

694
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:52,558
Make sure you jump from over twenty meters
high, nothing's around your landing spot,

695
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:58,294
the ground's hard concrete. And no man,
no tree on the ground. Do you know why?

696
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:03,566
If you jump and hit someone, you gotta
pay him. The insurance will not pay your sister,

697
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,163
But the one hit by you.

698
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:18,311
Which part of my
body hits the ground best?

699
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:22,414
Boss, the head makes the best hit. You
can see nothing when you land on head.

700
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,391
If you land on feet,
seeing your height, your leg

701
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:28,124
bones'll poke into
your body and you'll die a mess.

702
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:39,263
Boss...
Boss, wait a minute.

703
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:41,206
You... haven't pay me the wage.

704
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:47,811
I've forgotten that. I'm going to pay you.
And the bonus. Can you do me a favor?

705
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:48,941
Yes.

706
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:50,109
Push me down, OK?

707
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:57,488
Damn it! Why all the hurry?
Help me up!

708
01:14:57,559 --> 01:15:02,292
Sorry, boss. Let me help you!
And try another suicidal method.

709
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:13,838
Bro Hung, how about charcoal burning?
According to my information,

710
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:17,401
The torture is only three.
If you has a good setting,

711
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:21,347
no one ever find you,
it is very likely you can make it.

712
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:29,254
There's little torture for charcoal burning.
You'll got a headache at the beginning...

713
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:33,920
feel a bit tired,
then, you'll feel sick...

714
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:41,232
and worn-out.
And then, your body temperature'll drop...

715
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:50,507
You'll become incontinent and go into spasm.
Then, your breath'll die away...

716
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,706
And then... you die.

717
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:59,013
So, all that matters is before you kill yourself,
take a dump.

718
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:37,617
Boss.
Where's the charcoal?

719
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,957
Nil.
Nil? What's eating you?

720
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:46,228
Today is Easter. Everyone has
barbecue in the suburb.

721
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:46,528
The charcoal is sold out.
So I've got no charcoal.

722
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,194
Only you can mess up such...

723
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:51,364
Don't be disappointed.
According to the survey,

724
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,532
85%% % of people who burn the
charcoal fail to kill themselves.

725
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:57,308
They become cabbages
coz their brains lack oxygen.

726
01:16:57,379 --> 01:17:01,816
Paralyzed and staying at the hospital,
they need caring. This'll affect your sister.

727
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:05,046
And since you lie all the time,
your back muscles will decay,

728
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,920
bleed and breed the worms,
This'll affect the medical staff.

729
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:13,485
What's more, if your corners of mouth decay,
You can't brush your teeth. Your mouth stinks.

730
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:16,554
Ling'll not come see you.
You have only yourself to blame.

731
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:18,760
And more, you can't go to
the toilet by yourself.

732
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:21,769
You shit here and there. I gotta buy
diapers for you. This'll affect me.

733
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:22,929
OK...

734
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,270
You dare not jump nor bump.
You may...

735
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:35,579
What makes the insurance and the
government pays? SARS, give it a try? Boss?

736
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:40,953
It’ll be cool if you're the first one to be infected.
It'll be striking as soon as the press covers you.

737
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:45,084
Officials' attendance at your
funeral makes you a big time.

738
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:48,290
Wait!

739
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:53,596
SARS? All wearing facemasks? I'm alright.
Fear to press it? Let me help you, which floor?

740
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:55,733
Thanks.

741
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:02,110
What's with you?

742
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:05,874
Fear? Hong Kong people
gotta have faith in Hong Kong.

743
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:10,884
See.
I don't wanna. I'm fine.

744
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,247
I'm fine.

745
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:27,197
I've had too much last night.
Take a bird's nest weight loss pill before I go out.

746
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:32,330
Remember to wear a facemask.

747
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:34,234
Bro.

748
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:38,140
How're you feeling?

749
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:41,913
I've forgotten that.

750
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:48,720
Bro, why you turn the facemask over?
Just the same.

751
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:49,950
You don't need to wear a facemask at home.

752
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:52,550
I should wear it at home.
It does no harm to infect someone outside.

753
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,322
But it'll be no good to infect you.

754
01:18:56,832 --> 01:19:00,199
Bro! What's up?
Stay there, take off your shoes.

755
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:03,999
Why?
You bring in many germs, so dirty.

756
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:06,006
Take the shoes off and put them outside.
Outside.

757
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:10,807
I'm in a hurry, take off your clothes and
wash them. There're many germs, you know?

758
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:11,743
Talk to you later, bye.

759
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,715
I'm sorry, Ling.
I don't know you're here.

760
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:22,189
Hurry, Pong said there're many people
queuing at the shop. Bro, I go now.

761
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,249
Wear your facemask! You gotta
change clothes. Be ware of the germs.

762
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:26,555
Don't put the shoes inside.

763
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,109
Who said SARS is
highly infectious? Nonsense.

764
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:53,783
Twenty cases of SARS added to the list.
Among them four are medical staff.

765
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:58,315
They're suspected to be infected by the
SARS patients. Hospital Authority is reinforcing...

766
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:10,296
Sir... where do you want to go?
I'd like to see the patient.

767
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:12,067
Who?
My friend.

768
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,370
You're not allowed to see
your friend here. My relative...

769
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:16,205
What's his name?

770
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,508
I don't know all the names of my relatives.
I can't recall the names of some relatives.

771
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,572
Now's critical period. I won't let
you in unless you know the name.

772
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,017
Tom, check if any.
No Tom.

773
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:26,519
Dick?
No Dick.

774
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:30,785
Harry, there must be a Harry!
Stop messing around, sir.

775
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:33,054
If you go on like that,
I'll call the security guard.

776
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:37,260
We're fellows.
What fellows?

777
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:43,066
That's... I donated a few hundreds in the charity
show... for the performance of Michael Jackson.

778
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:43,661
So we're fellows.

779
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,402
I think he'll be grateful.
Go back and check it out.

780
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:51,411
How dare you! I've paid you!
Get out of here.

781
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,949
Your salary... I’ve paid you.
Check the name first.

782
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,278
Or I'll call the security guard.

783
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:11,731
Mike, how are you?
Any SARS at your home?

784
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:16,362
Coke only.
I mean atypical pneumonia.

785
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:21,466
Nutty?
Nutty? SARS is everywhere!

786
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,374
You're nutty as a fruitcake!

787
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:33,020
Uncle Keith! I'm Hung.

788
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:37,286
Your birthday? What a
coincidence. Happy birthday!

789
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:40,692
Nothing special. I'd like to ask...
Any SARS patients at your home?

790
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:48,268
Goddam?
Maybe there're SARS patients at your home.

791
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:54,806
Wow, Auntie Silly.

792
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:03,210
Auntie Silly, I'm Hung.
Yes, Hung Lam...

793
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:10,418
Nothing special, haven't you said your son...
Yes... that SARS...

794
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:16,055
Have he died? No...
Is he fine?

795
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:21,899
At hospital? Not yet go home? Fine! No...
I wish he get well.

796
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:27,237
Staying at hospital? Sorry, I've forgotten...
What's the name of your son?

797
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,044
Sir...
Have you checked it?

798
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:42,078
Yes, L...
Lee, Henry Lee!

799
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:46,059
Bed no.10 on eighth floor, right?

800
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,960
I can't see him without his name.
But I've got it now. Why?

801
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,759
He's a SARS patient,
living in isolation ward.

802
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:52,595
He's a SARS patient.
He'll die soon. So I...

803
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:59,437
Except medical staff, no one is allowed to
access him. The truth is I studied medicine before.

804
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:03,739
I'm a vet. Is it OK? Sorry.
For the safety of others, I'd like to...

805
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:04,779
request you to leave here.

806
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:08,578
No! I really in a hurry...
Life and death, let me in!

807
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:12,517
Sorry, sir. Please leave.
Or I'll call the security guard.

808
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:14,555
A security guard can't help you.
I get someone beats you.

809
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:18,183
I know someone, you know...
If you mess around, I'll call the police!

810
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:05,570
The one without the tube... Is he
serious? I don't care. Suck him.

811
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:14,906
Doctor, what're you doing?

812
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:18,947
I see the patient is breathing hard.
So I do the artificial respiration for him.

813
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,851
Artificial respiration?
He's dead.

814
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:23,254
We're going to wrap him.

815
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:26,360
Dead?
Really?

816
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:33,993
Shit.
I come here for SARS,

817
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,434
but I suck a corpse.

818
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:44,244
This world is ridiculous.
You can die of a rupture...

819
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:45,370
So dangerous!

820
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:49,349
I'd never eat a bad egg again.

821
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:55,049
Sis, what are you doing? Here's
Super Oxide Dismutase package. Bro.

822
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:56,521
Specially For you.

823
01:24:57,092 --> 01:25:00,653
I drink red wine every day, why this?
Have you got it wrong?

824
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:01,626
This one is different.

825
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:05,098
Alcohol is bad for your liver.
This one does no harm to liver?

826
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:09,830
SOD has the function of red wine,
but not the damage of it.

827
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:12,031
What's more, you'll sleep
well with this. You see,

828
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:16,477
your face is yellow coz you
always work overnight.

829
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:21,243
SOD'll bleach your face.
Above all, it strengthens your immunity.

830
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:26,515
You know, the outbreak of SARS
is scary. I hope you well.

831
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:30,752
Quick, drink it. Remember to
drink it every day. Drink it now.

832
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:34,921
You take me as a guinea pig? Wonders'll
never cease. I do that for your goodness.

833
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:43,301
Bro, I've washed all filters in the morning.
And, I installed many air-cleaners at home.

834
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:46,568
The clearer the air, the happier we live.

835
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:52,637
Yes, I've told the administration office...
to check the drain pipes in this building more.

836
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:57,913
You know, if the drain pipes burst without
repairing, the outcome can be very serious.

837
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:00,386
Just like Amok Garden... what a disaster.

838
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:06,583
Bro, where're you going?
Going to hell!

839
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:52,035
No... going to help my friends.
My friends are in trouble.

840
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:53,073
Bro!
Bro Hung...

841
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:57,372
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

842
01:26:57,445 --> 01:26:59,811
Come out.
Here's very dirty.

843
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,644
How come you're so silly? Bro!

844
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:08,748
Banlangen prevents SARS, get one.
Thanks.

845
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:11,258
Banlangen prevents SARS, get one.

846
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:15,155
Ever since herbal treatment's
introduced, most SARS

847
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:19,622
patients recovered.
The outcome is remarkable.

848
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:21,168
The combination of Chinese and
Western methods to cure SARS

849
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,434
reduced the fatality in
Guangdong to 6%% % only.

850
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:30,274
Bankruptcy is no big deal.
Do you need to die?

851
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:33,006
If you die, what'll I do?
What'll your sister do?

852
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:37,244
Not if Pong and I arrived,
you're done. Pong.

853
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:41,447
I'd rather suffer...

854
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:46,756
by myself. I don't want you to suffer.
When you get the insurance...

855
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:49,228
You don't need to suffer anymore.

856
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:52,698
What does the insurance mean to me
if you die? Have you seen me as your sister?

857
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:56,761
Bro Hung...

858
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:01,100
Have you sacked your workers?

859
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:04,633
Not yet.
That's good. Because...

860
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:10,116
Other than this drugstore,
my dad left me... a workshop...

861
01:28:10,184 --> 01:28:13,085
which makes face masks
and medical instruments.

862
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:19,221
The fact is...
SARS is raging now.

863
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:22,229
The orders of my workshop rise and
I need a lot of helpers.

864
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:27,224
I've thought it over.
I can't use all your workers.

865
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:32,103
You may save some of them to help
you. Once the situation goes better,

866
01:28:32,173 --> 01:28:35,973
the business of my workshop'll drop. That of
your restaurant and karaoke lounge'll rise.

867
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:41,641
You can reinstate your workers, OK?
You solve the problem of workers, but...

868
01:28:41,716 --> 01:28:47,780
I owe a lot of money. I've thought
it over also, see if it works.

869
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:52,451
No harm to try. I've got more
prepayment as my business rise.

870
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:56,520
If you need money,
I can lend you.

871
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:58,960
I have nothing to do with you,
why do you help me?

872
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:04,695
I've never got such motive.
I help you, Bro Hung, in fact...

873
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:09,710
I want you to agree to the marriage...
I got it. OK...

874
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:14,305
That means we are relatives now.
You must help me then.

875
01:29:14,382 --> 01:29:20,878
It's solved. Come up with
something for my business.

876
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:25,187
I must solve the problem of rent. The news
said the developers are planning to cut the rent.

877
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:27,124
Talk to them.
You talk to them?

878
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:31,324
Bro Hung, remember Ling's a negotiator?
Yes.

879
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:35,563
Oh, yes. A negotiator specializes
in dissuading suicide.

880
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:38,662
That's right, Ling. You may talk with
Bro more. He wanted to kill himself.

881
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:41,200
Let's go.

882
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:48,046
Why are your hands so hot?
Bro, you have fever!

883
01:29:48,116 --> 01:29:50,448
Very hot!
Pong, where's the toilet?

884
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:51,485
I've got stomach ache.

885
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,348
Special news roundup.

886
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:55,320
Who declares to lift the
travel advisory on Hong Kong.

887
01:29:56,324 --> 01:29:58,554
The clinical test was
proved to be 100%% % successful.

888
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:01,322
The government earmarked money
for the research of vaccine.

889
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:05,060
All SARS patients recovered and
were discharged,

890
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:07,124
except for one special case.

891
01:30:07,702 --> 01:30:11,729
The medical staff suspected this patient
had taken in many immune enhancing food.

892
01:30:12,306 --> 01:30:16,970
His cells is extraordinarily strong.
But at the same time,

893
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:22,004
he inhaled many SARS viruses. Therefore,
the cells are fighting against the viruses

894
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:23,550
His condition greatly fluctuates...
