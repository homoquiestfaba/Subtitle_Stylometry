00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,485
Damn it.

3
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,587
We were headed for Junction 21
like you ordered.

4
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,454
-Robbie picked up the signals
-We're confirming the HR scans.

5
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:01,563
-We weren't sure what to do.
-The readings don't make any sense.

6
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:04,996
-They read like Sentinels.
-But there's thousands of them.

7
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:08,160
-Directly above us.
-ls that possible?

8
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:10,133
We got company.

9
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:12,797
-They don't look happy to see us.
-Get us out of here.

10
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,647
-We're cut off!
-There's an intersection.

11
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,377
-lt's uncharted.
-Take it!

12
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,884
Get to the gun turrets!

13
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:52,271
Right.

14
00:03:52,682 --> 00:03:53,876
Come get some.

15
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,089
Hang on.

16
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,539
l've never seen the surface.

17
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:29,913
lt's nothing now but one big graveyard.

18
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:42,787
Oh, my God.

19
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,367
lt's an army.

20
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:52,073
-What is that thing?
-Some kind of tunneling machine.

21
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:53,674
-Oh, no.
-What?

22
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:56,835
Look where we are.
What's four kilometers straight down?

23
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,446
Zion.

24
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,314
Go. Go. Go!

25
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:25,397
-Zion. Zion has to be warned!
-How?

26
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,476
-Someone had to get to a drop point.
-What? Are you crazy?

27
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:30,737
-We can't broadcast now!
-We have to.

28
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,177
-l'll go.
-There isn't much time.

29
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:34,543
l'll make it.

30
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:49,321
You know, l peeked.

31
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,931
So did l.

32
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,567
Goodbye, Thadeus.

33
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:02,069
Goodbye, Jue.

34
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:09,079
Fly, baby, fly!

35
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:47,413
Come on!

36
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:33,720
Pardon me.

37
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:36,592
l'm sorry.
l was in my own little world.

38
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,064
-ls it important?
-Very.

39
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:42,200
-l hope it gets where it's supposed to go.
-Me too.

40
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:46,808
-These days you never know.
-No, you never do.

41
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,500
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

42
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:58,850
Thadeus.

[ENGLlSH]

44
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,988
Welcome to the Zion archive.

45
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:21,159
You have selected historical file
number 1 2- 1.

46
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,832
The Second Renaissance.

47
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:38,175
In the beginning, there was man.
And for a time, it was good.

48
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:43,223
But humanity's so-called civil societies...

49
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:48,091
...soon fell victim to vanity
and corruption.

50
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:51,722
He says, ''l'm sorry, sir,
l'm incapable of that function.''

51
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:59,631
Then man made the machine
in his own likeness.

52
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,142
Whoops! Pardon me.
Coming through.

53
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:19,959
Thus did man become the architect
of his own demise.

54
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:26,333
But for a time, it was good.

55
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,475
The machines worked tirelessly
to do man's bidding.

56
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,783
It was not long before
seeds of dissent took root.

57
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:22,447
Though loyal and pure, the machines
earned no respect from their masters...

58
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,458
...these strange,
endlessly multiplying mammals.

59
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:27,990
--hearing the prosecution's
closing statement...

60
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:31,633
...in what's expected to be
the final day of the B 1-66ER trial.

61
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:37,205
B 1-66ER.
A name that will never be forgotten.

62
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:41,139
For he was the first of his kind
to rise up against his masters.

63
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,040
--which that instrument
provides for and secures...

64
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:46,647
...to the citizens of the United States.

65
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:49,080
On the contrary, they were,
at that time...

66
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:53,051
...considered as a subordinate
and inferior class--

67
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:56,316
At B 1-66ER's murder trial...

68
00:12:56,492 --> 00:13:00,451
...the prosecution argued for
an owner's right to destroy property.

69
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:06,431
B 1-66ER testified that
he simply did not want to die.

70
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,807
Rational voices dissented.

71
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:18,078
Who was to say the machine,
endowed with the very spirit of man...

72
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:21,045
...did not deserve a fair hearing?

73
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:29,721
The leaders of men were quick to order
the extermination of B 1-66ER...

74
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,089
...and every one of his kind
throughout each province of the earth.

75
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:37,198
Androids and liberal sympathizers flooded
the streets of the nation's capital today.

76
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:40,961
--threat of violence to make good
on the legacy of B 1-66ER.

77
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:43,730
Fifteen thousand mechanicals
and human sympathizers...

78
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,307
...have continued their demonstration
in front of the Albany courthouse...

79
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,967
...in what has been dubbed
the ''Million Machine March. ''

80
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:54,775
The demonstrators have been met with
squads of defense forces in riot gear.

81
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,704
Robot bitch!

82
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:22,568
l got something for you!

83
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:27,782
Hold her up!

84
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,781
No, please!

85
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,149
-That's all, paint job!
-l'm real!

86
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,905
Die, bots, die!

87
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:42,417
Banished from humanity, the machines
sought refuge in their own promised land.

88
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,389
They settled in the cradle
of human civilization...

89
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:48,029
...and thus a new nation was born.

90
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,825
A place the machines could call home.

91
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,594
A place they could raise
their descendants.

92
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,865
And they christened the nation Zero-One.

93
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:03,506
Zero-One prospered.
And for a time, it was good.

94
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,207
The machines' artificial intelligence could
be seen in every facet of man's society...

95
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,912
...including, eventually,
the creation of new and better AI.

96
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:31,570
If you need the flexibility of a helipod
with the speed of an air jet...

97
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,071
...look no further!

98
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,143
Our patented vector-thrust coil
gives the Zero-One Versatran...

99
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:41,146
...the ability to sustain normal flight
in the event of a multiengine failure.

100
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:44,581
Versatran. It's the only choice.

101
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:48,689
No matter what the finance minister
says, the market has spoken:

102
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:51,587
The Human Nations' credit rating
is falling like a stone...

103
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,695
...while Zero-One's currency is climbing
without stopping for breath.

104
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:57,263
With headlines like that,
the markets have no choice--

105
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,300
But the leaders of men,
their power waning...

106
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:03,063
...refused to cooperate
with the fledgling nation...

107
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:06,799
...wishing rather
that the world be divided.

108
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:10,876
The world community of nations cannot
tolerate this kind of flagrant deception--

109
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,643
--today approved initiatives
for both economic sanctions...

110
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:21,188
...and a naval blockade as a means
of containment and isolation of Zero-One.

111
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:53,317
Zero-One's ambassadors pleaded
to be heard.

112
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:57,823
At the United Nations, they presented
plans for a stable, civil relationship...

113
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,359
...with the nations of man.

114
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:06,325
Zero-One's admission to
the United Nations was denied.

115
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:13,804
But it would not be the last time
the machines would take the floor there.

116
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:50,867
[ENGLlSH]

117
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,330
And man said, ''Let there be light. ''

118
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:19,531
And he was blessed by light,
heat, magnetism, gravity...

119
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,836
...and all the energies of the universe.

120
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:35,621
The prolonged barrage engulfed Zero-One
in the glow of a thousand suns.

121
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:41,087
But unlike their former masters
with their delicate flesh...

122
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,222
...the machines had little to fear
of the bombs' radiation and heat.

123
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:52,867
Thus did Zero-One's troops
advance outwards in every direction.

124
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:57,308
And one after another,
mankind surrendered its territories.

125
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,777
So the leaders of men conceived
of their most desperate strategy yet.

126
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,817
A final solution:

127
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:08,914
The destruction of the sky.

128
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:33,041
Lt. Gaeda, please report
to the Op Center.

129
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:37,184
All right, you maggots! At 0800,
prepare to move out!

130
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:46,120
George Company, prepare to move out.
Charlie Company, prepare to move out.

we thank you for your....

Put on your spiritual armor
to stand against the wiles of the devil.

133
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,584
Hotel Bravo, this is Papa One.
Operation Dark Storm initiated.

134
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:48,118
Thus would man try to cut
the machines off from the sun...

135
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,850
...their main energy source.

136
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,729
May there be mercy on man
and machine for their sins.

-Go! Go!
-Kill them!

138

Kill them all! Kill them all!
Kill them all!

139
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:46,371
Fire in the hole!

140
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:53,883
Come on, get back out there.
Give us some more artillery.

Help me! Help me! No!

145
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:58,612
Help me! My God, help me!

146
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:26,412
The machines, having long studied
men's simple, protein-based bodies...

147
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:30,040
...dispensed great misery
upon the human race.

148
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:46,062
Victorious, the machines now turned
to the vanquished.

149
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:50,202
Applying what they had learned
about their enemy...

150
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:54,741
...the machines turned to an alternate
and readily available power supply:

151
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:00,007
The bioelectric, thermal and
kinetic energies of the human body.

152
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:08,514
A newly-fashioned symbiotic relationship
between the two adversaries was born.

153
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,953
The machine drawing power
from the human body...

154
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:18,463
...an endlessly multiplying,
infinitely renewable energy source.

155
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:25,905
This is the very essence
of the Second Renaissance.

156
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,147
Bless all forms of intelligence.

157
00:25:47,195 --> 00:25:50,358

a mere vessel.

Hand over your flesh,
and a new world awaits you.

159
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,477
We demand it.

Your favorite simulation.

163
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,885
Just killing time.
You want to spar?

164
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,343
As you wish.

165
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:27,050
That was too easy. What's the problem?
Where's your concentration?

166
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,083
Maybe you regret taking the red pill.

167
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:10,129
Maybe.

00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,923
The life we had
before knowing all this.

172
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:44,949
Even if that life was just an illusion?

173
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:39,011
lt's ironic that one could be
more at peace in the virtual world.

174
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:42,549
Finally starting to warm up.

175

Listen to me. l have something
l want to talk to you about.

lt's all right. l've blocked the signal
so no one else can hear us.

177
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,856
So, what? You gonna propose?

178
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:57,858
l'm going back to the Matrix
and l want you to come with me.

179
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:01,625
Come on, be serious, Duo.
Stop teasing me.

180
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:08,732
l am serious, and you know it.
l really thought you'd be with me on this.

181
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:17,914
Anyway, it's done
and it's all been settled with them.

182

-We can't.
-We can!

187
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:34,992
l've come to my senses.
You should do the same.

188
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,631
l took the red pill because
l wanted to know the truth.

189
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:39,263
But l don't care about
the truth anymore.

190

What's real doesn't matter.

191

What's important
is how we live our lives.

192
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,170
Are you listening to me?
You know l'm right.

193
00:39:18,206 --> 00:39:20,936
But we can't go back, Duo.
We know the truth now.

194
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,692
-We can forget all of this.
-Duo....

-Tell me.
-l can't. l don't know.

Enough, Duo. l've had enough!

lt's no use. l told you.
l've blocked your signal.

You won't stop me.
This is your last chance.

210
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:06,469
The choice isn't that hard.

211
00:41:08,416 --> 00:41:09,815
Come with me.

You can forget about it, Duo.
l won't look away from the truth. l can't.

That's too bad. l'm sorry.

I used to think being
a private detective was cool.

to check on your wife, right?

I'm looking for a computer hacker.

But I had no good reason
to turn the guy down now.

248
00:44:26,347 --> 00:44:28,747
This Trinity was well-known
in hacker circles.

249

A real artist by the sound of it.

250

The cops were always
one step behind him.

251
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:40,558
So I knew I could get that close.
Question was, could I get closer?

252
00:44:47,535 --> 00:44:51,369
I had a few tricks up my sleeve
for getting to hackers.

253

I found something strange.

Other detectives had been
on the case too.

One of the guys killed himself.

Another had disappeared.

258
00:45:36,884 --> 00:45:39,011
Another went crazy.

259
00:45:45,927 --> 00:45:49,954
So I paid the one
who was left a visit.

260
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:57,229
The crazy one.

261
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:02,336

He's not real.

264
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,795
Did I mention he was crazy?

00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:31,596
Chessboards, jabberwocky,
Red Queen....

266
00:46:30,304 --> 00:46:32,772
I started searching

...and....

276
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:26,619
And then she boards a train.

There's a difference, Mr. Ash,
between a trap and a test.

of getting to you, didn't they?

00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,964
Nice moves, man.

342
00:56:07,314 --> 00:56:08,781
Come on!

343
00:56:10,317 --> 00:56:14,981
-Hey, it's over here.
-Wait, l'm coming with you.

344
00:56:16,556 --> 00:56:18,547
You sure it's okay to show her?

345
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:22,861
Hello? Where are you?

346
00:56:30,537 --> 00:56:32,767
Guys? Where'd you go?

347
00:56:34,341 --> 00:56:36,104
Where'd they go?

348
00:56:38,245 --> 00:56:40,509
-Come on, boy.
-Whoa, cool truck!

349
00:56:42,415 --> 00:56:43,712
Settle down!

00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:47,143
Hold still!

Sit! Sit!

00:56:56,897 --> 00:56:58,626
Hello?

00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,066
Where is everyone?

Yuki?

356
00:57:11,378 --> 00:57:13,312
Stupid cat.

357
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:15,343
What's happening?
What's going on here?

358
00:57:20,387 --> 00:57:22,821
-l got it!
-Yeah!

359
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:27,520
Yuki? ls that you?

360
00:57:27,928 --> 00:57:30,590
There you are, Yuki.

l've been looking everywhere for you.
Bad cat.

363
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:37,894
Bet you're hungry, huh?

364
00:57:38,271 --> 00:57:42,264
l figured this out yesterday.
Your cat's okay.

365
00:57:39,773 --> 00:57:41,832
Yeah, thanks.

366
00:57:41,942 --> 00:57:43,705
lt's those boys.

367
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:35,123
-Ready!
-There he goes.

00:58:35,195 --> 00:58:37,459
Banzai! Yes!

369
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:07,120
May l have your attention, please.

370
00:59:06,526 --> 00:59:09,461
And you are the winner!

00:59:09,496 --> 00:59:13,592
No fair. He hit the ground.
His nose is bleeding. Look!

372
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:37,056
l think he's right.
He hit the ground.

373
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:41,685
-Hey, who told her?
-Don't look at me.

-l don't know.
-l didn't tell her.

375
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:50,597
So this house is haunted.

376
00:59:52,372 --> 00:59:58,038
-No way. Wow, this is too much!
-This never happened before.

377
00:59:53,873 --> 00:59:57,741
That, that was--
What was that?

378
00:59:58,778 --> 01:00:00,143
Hi.

379
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:21,093
Anybody home?

380
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:26,129
Yeah, they're gonna tear it down.

381
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,570
Come on, come on, come on!

382
01:00:30,443 --> 01:00:33,435
Hey, light as a feather.

383
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,146
-l wanna try! l wanna try!
-Come on, we could help her.

384
01:00:42,288 --> 01:00:44,813
Hey, hey! Come on.
Get away from there. Move along!

Clear the area.
Clear the area immediately.

Yuki.

393
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:17,939
If you don't want to go out with him,
why did you say you would?

394
01:02:19,853 --> 01:02:22,720
I mean, you don't wanna give him
the wrong idea.

395

Where is she?

01:03:07,133 --> 01:03:09,658
I'm starting to worry.
Yuki!

01:03:13,106 --> 01:03:16,269
Hey, you! We've got one over here.

401

You don't belong here.

Move along, folks.

Come on, folks, out of the way.

Let go of me, let go!

406
01:03:37,797 --> 01:03:41,995
-Tell me you have all of them.
-Yes, sir. The last one's over there.

407
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:49,235
-Examine her. Then let her go.
-Yes, sir.

in there! lt's just some kids!

417
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:29,138
Wake up. Baby's spotted
two machines heading in fast.

418
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,004
l see them.

419
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,414
They're runners.
Think you can handle them?

420
01:04:34,988 --> 01:04:36,250
Watch me.

421
01:04:36,689 --> 01:04:38,020
Okay. l'm in.

422
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:45,889
That runner's smarter
than we've seen so far.

423
01:04:46,666 --> 01:04:48,327
-lt's quite a catch.
-Thanks.

424
01:04:52,705 --> 01:04:54,570
Will it--?
Do you think it'll convert?

425
01:04:57,076 --> 01:04:59,806
To convert is its choice to make.

426
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:47,984
Do you think maybe
we ought to reprogram it?

427
01:05:48,761 --> 01:05:50,626
No. We can't make slaves of them.

428
01:05:52,765 --> 01:05:54,460
Because that would be simpler.

429
01:05:54,434 --> 01:05:56,800
We won't beat the machines
by making them our slaves.

430
01:05:56,469 --> 01:05:58,300
Better to let them join us by choice.

431
01:07:01,801 --> 01:07:04,895
Make them believe the right choice
is the one we want them to make.

432
01:07:23,023 --> 01:07:26,652
All right. Yes, machines are tools.
They're made to be used.

433
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:41,107
-lt's their nature.
-To be slaves.

434
01:07:42,576 --> 01:07:45,272
That's why we can show them
a better world, why they convert.

435
01:07:45,579 --> 01:07:48,514
-But that world we show them isn't real.
-lt doesn't matter.

436
01:07:49,082 --> 01:07:52,483
l'm afraid they'll figure out that
we've made up the thing in our heads.

437
01:07:53,287 --> 01:07:57,087
They can't tell the difference.
To an artificial mind, all reality is virtual.

438
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:12,002
How do they know that the real world
isn't just another simulation?

439
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:10,859
How do you?

440
01:08:11,939 --> 01:08:15,739
l know l'm not dreaming now because
l know what it's like being in a dream.

441
01:08:18,078 --> 01:08:20,569
So dreaming lets you know reality exists.

442
01:08:22,049 --> 01:08:25,849
No. Just that my mind exists.
l don't know about the rest.

01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,327
Not at all.

Those that learn it exists...

Of course l believe you, Dan.
lt's got to be some kind of mix-up.

You'll clear it up,
and if you can't, you'll go on.

465
01:09:52,539 --> 01:09:55,804
Just like you've always done.
You know that.

what to believe in anymore.

This is no good, Dan!
Your muscles are about to burst!

01:15:27,307 --> 01:15:29,707
We'd go to Broadway musicals,
to the movies.

512
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:35,780
Now they call her
the ''queen of mystery literature.''

513
01:15:38,918 --> 01:15:41,386
Lives in an elegant villa
in the south of France.

514
01:15:45,892 --> 01:15:48,486
But, when l go visit,
she still bakes me her cherry pie.

515
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:56,600
Something about biting into it, just
for that brief moment tasting perfection.

516
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:00,602
Like leaving your body or something.

517
01:16:01,107 --> 01:16:04,076
Anyone can write a novel,
but no one can beat her cherry pie.

518
01:16:04,044 --> 01:16:07,536
An interesting case,
but nothing to be concerned about.

519
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:48,351
His memory of the race was expunged
with no residual effects.

520
01:16:54,361 --> 01:16:57,819
He will never run again.
He will never walk again, for that matter.

521
01:17:36,837 --> 01:17:41,831
We'll continue monitoring him
for a while, but anticipate no problems.

522
01:17:43,343 --> 01:17:47,609
A record that will live on
in people's memories for years to come.

523
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:48,380
What more could anyone ask for?

524
01:17:47,948 --> 01:17:49,813
Free....

525
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:41,562
Did you say something?

526
01:21:20,794 --> 01:21:22,728
Sit down.

527
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:25,498
Free....

528
01:21:25,365 --> 01:21:27,890
Sit down!

529
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,389
[ENGLlSH]

530
01:21:31,571 --> 01:21:36,099
Mr. Popper, what is my policy
on ringing phones in the classroom?

531
01:21:33,807 --> 01:21:35,468
-l'm sorry, sir.
-Yes, well...

532
01:21:35,842 --> 01:21:39,835
...you're barely passing my class
as it is, Mr. Popper.

533
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:43,274
-lt won't happen again, sir.
-For your sake, l hope not.

534
01:21:40,247 --> 01:21:42,545
l turned it off. l know l did.

535
01:21:42,249 --> 01:21:44,774
They know you know.
They're coming for you.

536
01:21:45,519 --> 01:21:47,987
Get out. Get out now!

537
01:21:49,322 --> 01:21:52,689
You are in serious trouble, Mr. Popper.

538
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:53,153
Stop right there!

539
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:55,885
Mr. Popper.

540
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:02,231
Neo, l believe.
l know it wasn't a dream.

541
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:06,462
This is not real.
And the real world lies somewhere else.

542
01:22:05,338 --> 01:22:10,332
A typical mental delusion. We get
unbalanced kids like this all the time.

543
01:22:08,842 --> 01:22:11,242
Reality can be a pretty scary thing
for some people.

544
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:13,639
This world must have been a cold
and alienating place for a boy like that.

545
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:15,880
lt's called denying reality.

546
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:20,882
lt's, you know, just a self-defense
mechanism for those type of kids.

547
01:22:36,269 --> 01:22:40,729
Well, he's in another world now.

548
01:22:39,673 --> 01:22:42,233
Make no mistake about that.

549
01:22:41,575 --> 01:22:44,373
His vitals are good. He's gonna make it.

550
01:22:44,144 --> 01:22:48,171
lt's unbelievable. l didn't think
self-substantiation was possible.

551
01:22:48,081 --> 01:22:50,049
Apparently, it is.

552
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:51,073
Neo.

553
01:23:52,545 --> 01:23:55,480
lt's okay. You're safe now.

554
01:29:51,337 --> 01:29:52,998
l knew...

555
01:29:54,474 --> 01:29:57,341
...you'd save me.

556
01:30:09,355 --> 01:30:11,414
l didn't save you, kid.

557
01:30:58,838 --> 01:31:01,602
You saved yourself.
