00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,274
Well, I haven't even decided if...
I haven't even decided if I'm going.

174
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,717
If you wanna come up here,
we'd be more than happy

175
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,220
to help you get accustomed
to living here in Winnipeg,

176
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,055
including finding a Canadian
to marry for your citizenship.

177
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,822
Did you get a chance
to look at the profiles on our website?

178
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,362
Yeah, I...

179
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,863
I thought it was a joke.

180
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,165
We've had some American news
organizations treating it like a joke.

181
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:41,035
And these women are willing to marry me?

182
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:45,703
Well, it's a little more involved than that.
I mean, they gotta like you.

183
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,944
Look, this is really...

184
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,980
This is really nice of you, Gloria.

185
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,384
Well, we're nice up here sometimes
for no good reason.

186
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,979
Thank you, I'll be in touch.

187
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,415
LARRY: I wanna get out
of corporate America, man.

188
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,249
You know, you've got a computer,
they'll read your files.

189
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,016
Track everything you do.

190
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,287
I got my FBI file once
under the Freedom of Information Act.

191
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,453
This fucking thick, man.

192
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:47,363
My girlfriend lives in Vancouver,
and I've got a week's vacation.

193
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,334
Tall latte, no fat, extra foam.

194
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,393
So I saw your post,
and I thought a road trip would be neat.

195
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:56,296
Last road trip I took, I listened to
Neil Diamond, like, 70.// of the trip.

196
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,400
Something about it
just clicked with the landscape.

197
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,535
Right.

198
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,241
You got those multinationals
just pouring propaganda into your brain.

199
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,883
And what are your political views?

200
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,216
(LAUGHING) Yeah, I saw that on the flier.
Does it really matter?

201
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,448
You voted for Bush, didn't you?

202
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,022
So, it's cool if I bring my pet snake?

203
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,183
Well, you know...

204
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,759
Marry a Canadian, huh?

205
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,591
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, man,
I'll have to look into that.

206
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,492
- All righty.
- Looking forward to hearing from you.

207
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,862
- Okay.
- Thanks a lot, Jack.

208
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,424
Okay. It's John.

209
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,782
Are you John?

210
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,557
Yeah.

211
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,321
Hi. Chloe.

212
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,419
Hi.

213
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,361
Sorry. I'm like an hour late.

214
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,991
Hi, you want a coffee or tea or...

215
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,534
No, I'm okay.

216
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,070
Oh, okay. Have a seat.

217
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,765
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

218
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,671
Sorry...

219
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,142
Chloe. Chloe Haymon or Hamon?

220
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,411
Hamon.

221
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,882
You know, that's Spanish for ham,
you know. Or it's jamon.

222
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,787
I think it's an English name.

223
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,626
No one's ever pointed that out to you?
Hamon, jamon?

224
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,824
You're the first. Congrats.

225
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,758
Well.

226
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,631
So what do you do, John?

227
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,797
I was a graphic designer.
I mean, I am still a graphic designer,

228
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,706
but I gave up my job
to work on the campaign.

229
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,938
So, you're gonna be looking for work
up in Canada?

230
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,344
Well, my moving to Canada is a protest

231
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,178
against the recently
re-elected administration.

232
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,687
Why? Are you somebody I should know
or something?

233
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:49,982
What do you mean?

234
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,024
I mean, who's gonna care
if you move to Canada?

235
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,926
Well, you don't have to be a somebody
to make a political statement.

236
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,897
But, yeah, actually,
the local news did a piece on me

237
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,093
and I write a blog
called the Donkey Revolution.

238
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:07,696
Cool. So are you gonna have,
like, cameras following you or something?

239
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:13,109
No, but I'll be documenting it on the blog.
Pen's mightier than the sword.

240
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,112
What about you? Why do you want to go?

241
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,879
Oh, I'm with you. I just wanna get
out of here as fast as fucking possible.

242
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:21,878
Were you working on the campaign?

243
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,615
Yeah.

244
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,384
Which group?

245
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,122
The main one. For Kerry.

246
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,218
The D.N.C.?

247
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,320
Yeah.

248
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,695
I heard you guys were more
on the ball than the 527s.

249
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,563
Yeah, yeah, they were pretty good
to work for.

250
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,397
Not good enough, though.

251
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:41,098
Yeah, I'm just so sick of it all.
I mean, the dude lied to us.

252
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,233
And there's people dying over there
for no reason.

253
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,143
And then he gets re-elected?

254
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,839
Exactly.

255
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:54,379
So, are you gonna be
making a decision soon?

256
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,652
Well, I have a couple of more people to...

257
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,386
Yeah, yeah, yeah, very soon.

258
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,951
'Cause I could leave tomorrow.

259
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,996
Great.

260
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,998
HAL: I can't believe she's hot.

261
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,298
You could come, too.

262
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,272
- Are you two gonna share a hotel room?
- We didn't discuss that.

263
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,740
Are you gonna share a bed?

264
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,401
It's only a few days' drive.

265
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,809
- Gonna share your fluids?
- Oh, shut the fuck up, Hal.

266
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,040
I'm going up there
to make a political statement.

267
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,209
Please. Did Gandhi go
on a sex-fueled road trip

268
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,516
with some little communist hottie
to protest British occupation?

269
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,816
- No.
- No.

270
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,652
He fasted for weeks.

271
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:38,360
Martin Luther King, did he desegregate
the South by boning white women?

272
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,298
I don't think so. He marched,
he got spit on, he got attacked by dogs

273
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,427
and honky policemen, and then he got shot.

274
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:49,531
You're going on what I believe will be
described by historians as a sex romp.

275
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,508
You were practically forcing me into this
a week ago.

276
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,603
- He'll be gone in four years.
- And then we get to get ready for Jeb.

277
00:16:55,481 --> 00:17:00,384
JOHN... This country is too conservative.
And it's not gonna change any time soon.

278
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,278
HAL... And you're really gonna give up
your American citizenship?

279
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,084
JOHN... That's my plan.

280
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,672
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

281
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,798
Here, let me help you with that.

282
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,864
Nah, I got it.

283
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,116
- Ready to hit the road?
- Yep.

284
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,913
I was thinking maybe we'll stop
and pick up some groceries and a cooler.

285
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,047
I don't know your financial situation, but...

286
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,921
No, no, that's good. That's great.

287
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:14,981
Okay.

288
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,056
'Cause it can get kind of tense,
two people traveling together,

289
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,826
if they're on totally separate budgets,
you know.

290
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,265
One person wants to go
to the finest restaurants in town...

291
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,166
No, no, no, I totally agree.

292
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,934
Good, I'm really glad to hear you say that.

293
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,942
If you open the glove compartment there...

294
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,803
What is this?

295
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,144
JOHN: That is a budget I put together.

296
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:41,346
It's got meals, gas, hotel rates,
tolls along the route.

297
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,857
And also, I mapped out the best route
to take. There it is.

298
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,087
Thanks. Thanks for doing this.

299
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,026
You're welcome.

300
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,395
CHLOE: Good to know
you've got everything under control.

301
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,400
Yeah, well, I think it's best to do that
before each trip.

302
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,733
You know, before each adventure,
so to speak.

303
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,363
CHLOE: Should we stop for gas?

304
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,806
Yeah, but we gotta wait
for a Coorco station.

305
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,468
Why?

306
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:09,913
Coorco is a Venezuelan company.
No support for Middle East oil, right?

307
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,850
I know, Chavez is no saint,
but at least he cares about his people.

308
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,580
What if we don't pass one?

309
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,112
No, we will. I mapped out
all the locations along the route.

310
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,752
If you go to the tab marked "gas."
There it is.

311
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,391
This is really detailed.

312
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,593
It's a program on the computer.
It's just a spreadsheet, but...

313
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,365
It's more for fun, I do it. But I enjoy it.

314
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,310
Are you a vegetarian?

315
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,745
- Me?
- Yeah.

316
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,441
No.

317
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,840
Huh.

318
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,688
Are you?

319
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:52,917
Yeah.

320
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,333
CASHIER: That'll be $7.55, please.

321
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,842
CUSTOMER: All right, there you go.

322
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,275
CASHIER: All right, here's your change.

323
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,635
You wanna drive for a while?

324
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,762
Isn't it stick?

325
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,738
Yeah.

326
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,968
I can't drive stick.

327
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,600
What?

328
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,941
I don't know how.

329
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,311
But the flier said you needed to know
how to drive stick.

330
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,680
Didn't it say standard?

331
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,241
Standard is stick.

332
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,378
Oh, I thought standard was regular.

333
00:20:56,455 --> 00:21:00,448
No, there's automatic and there's stan...
You know, forget it.

334
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,016
It's my fault,
I forgot to ask you about it when we met.

335
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,723
I've been meaning to learn.
People are always ragging on me.

336
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,526
Yeah, it's okay.

337
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:25,040
You know, we never actually talked
about the rooming situation.

338
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,914
Oh, right. Yeah.

339
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,719
You know, if we were gonna get
one room or two.

340
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,121
I mean, I don't care either way.

341
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,215
Me neither.

342
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,261
Okay. Good.

343
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,263
How about, if they have single rooms
with two beds, we take that,

344
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,789
but if they only have rooms with one bed,
then we spring for two rooms?

345
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:46,167
Sure, or whatever... I could sleep
on the floor. If we wanna save money.

346
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,262
I could sleep on the floor, too.

347
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,705
- Right. We could switch off.
- Sure.

348
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,767
We only have rooms available
with one king-sized bed.

349
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,746
A king's pretty big.

350
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,081
Let's get two rooms.

351
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,986
Sure. Yeah. There's probably more stuff
once we get north. This will be easier.

352
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,853
Yeah.

353
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,119
- Two rooms?
- Two rooms. Yeah.

354
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,093
- That's better.
- Yeah.

355
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,088
Do you have Internet access anywhere?

356
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,065
Yes, there's wireless in all the rooms.

357
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,498
Oh, great.

358
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,829
Well, they have a... This way.
They have a coffee shop downstairs.

359
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,170
Or I saw a diner
when we got off the freeway.

360
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,674
Sure. I'll eat anything.

361
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:25,869
Okay.

362
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,970
So, just knock on my door
in a few minutes, okay?

363
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,241
Okay.

364
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,396
When you win, there is a feeling

365
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:53,165
that the people have spoken
and embraced your point of view.

366
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,536
And that's what I intend
to tell the Congress.

367
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:59,065
I made it clear
what I intend to do as the President.

368
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,874
It's one of the wonderful...

369
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,782
It's like earning capital.

370
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,182
You asked, "Do I feel free?"
Let me put it to you this way.

371
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,743
I earned capital in the campaign,
political capital,

372
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,153
and now I intend to spend it.

373
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:16,225
It is my style. That's what happened
after the 2000 election.

374
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:19,525
I earned some capital.
I've earned capital in this election.

375
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,123
And I'm gonna spend it for what...

376
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,300
...I've told the people I'd spend it on.

377
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,734
Come on.

378
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,364
BUSH... Been a fantastic experience,
campaigning the country.

379
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,429
Come on.

380
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,033
You've seen it from one perspective,
I've seen it from another.

381
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,910
Saw you standing there at the last,
final rally in Texas, to my right over there.

382
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:40,077
I was observing you observe, and you saw
the energy. There was just something...

383
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,861
What are you doing?

384
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,989
I was just... I'll figure this out later.

385
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,090
BUSH ON TV... Now that I've got
the will of the people at my back,

386
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,399
I'm going to start enforcing
the one-question rule.

387
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,598
That was three questions.

388
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,104
Our president, ladies and gentleman.

389
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,008
As far as Tony Blair's comments,
I agree with him.

390
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,308
Middle East peace
is a very important part of...

391
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,372
JOHN... I always hate when people
tell me what to do, you know,

392
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,181
tie my shoes, or shave,
or get a haircut, anything like that.

Anything else you don't like?

394
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,889
Sorry.

395
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,257
So what did you do
before you worked on the campaign?

396
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,795
I was a teacher.

397
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,660
Really? What'd you teach?

398
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,198

399
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,100

406
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:47,208
So, tell me about that organization thing
up in Canada.

407
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:51,984
Well, it's a group that helps people like us,
who are moving up there,

408
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:57,586
find jobs and, you know, meet Canadians.

409
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,687
Sounds perfect.

410
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,894
Yeah, and the lady who runs it, Gloria,
seemed really nice on the phone.

411
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,301
Aren't you worried
about looking for work up there?

412
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:10,171
Well, graphic design's pretty portable,
and I can always do some freelance.

413

Plus, I'd really like to focus
on the Donkey Revolution.

...and three other Cabinet members have
apparently submitted their resignations,

429
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,490
though Powell has told reporters
that he will remain in the post

430
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,397
until a successor is named.

431
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:14,166

by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham,

Yeah. I...

I'm in Oregon and I'm driving north.

455
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,694
Yeah. Exactly.

456
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,259
I guess around 4:00.

to predict exactly when I'm going to arrive

eight hours away.

459

I will call you when I'm closer, okay?

460
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,611
Just me and a friend.

461
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:13,547
Yes, and she has blue hair,
and she might be a lesbian.

462

I'm just gonna tell you this now,
so you don't faint when you see her.

to mention to you.

00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,613
I don't know.

516
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,036
It's a little more than that.

shotgun beers and bare-knuckle box him

was just for this trip,

That's what my dad does.

Just drive me back to Spokane,

Yeah, but I changed my mind.

go back to Iraq and get killed?

the name of the group. Not literal.

851
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,542
Yeah, when you were flagging girls?

852
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,534
Do you want beer or wine?

853
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:10,011
Both.

855
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,415
Hi. Scott. First time in Canada?

856
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:19,614
Yeah.

857
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:23,489
We got this thing here called
the Tall Poppy Syndrome. You know it?

858
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,720
No.

859
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,489
Well, see, in a field of poppies,

860
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:29,589
they'll cut down the ones
that stand above the rest.

861
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,726
So, no one wants to stand out too much.

862
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:35,297
You're welcome.

863
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:39,172
We've got everything you need.
All the artsy stuff, if you're into that.

864
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,176
- Sure.
- All the sports stuff, too.

865
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,111
I'm surprised you haven't heard of that.
Really famous.

866
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:48,514
Well, I arrived at
about 3:00 yesterday or so.

867
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,314
- "About"?
- About.

868
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,376
I'm sorry, "Aboot."

869
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,251
"Aboot"? No, I mean...
What do you mean, "Aboot"?

870
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,883
Well, you're saying it funny.
You're going, "Aboot."

871
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,053
People who used to vote Democrat
for economic reasons,

872
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,689
well, they're now voting Republican
because they think it's more in line

873
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:03,255
with their moral values.

874
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,460
Well, when we were working in Ohio,

875
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,400
all they had us doing
was going to supporters' houses...

876
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:11,531
Why don't you pass me
one of them cold ones, little lady?

877
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,502
So, do you wanna get married?

878
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:21,312
No. And, anyway, I'm an American, too.

879
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:24,285
So? How about get laid?

880
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,015
No.

881
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,149
You wanna know a secret?

882
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,059
I don't even hate Bush.

883
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:37,589
I mean, that's what I came here for,
the bush!

884
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:41,933
Oh, jeez, sorry. I've got... I'll be right back.

885
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,031
Hey! We're putting you in the penalty box.

886

Sorry, I'll be right back.

Are you having fun?

888
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,907
Yeah. You?

889
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,176
This is like a bad seventh-grade dance.

890
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,376
Excuse me. John?

891
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:56,510
Yeah. That's me.

892
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,282
I saw your profile on the website.
I'm Rebecca.

894
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,148
So, you're a blogger?
I'm a bloggee. I've read your blogs.

895
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:05,694
Oh, we should totally blog.

896
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:08,458
Fuck him! Fuck it!
I don't wanna hear what he says.

897
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,590
In fact, I wish that motherfucker was dead.

898
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:12,965
I'm running from my own country
like a refugee.

899
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,138
Baby, listen to my wordplay

900
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,040
The time's short
You better get onboard

901
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,807
Before the bandwagon
fills up and we on tour

902
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,508
And we don't care
We making money off rap

903
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,847
And I didn't used to
sell crack laughing at

904
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:32,046
All these dudes telling
lies for the fame and wealth

905

I don't mean to put you on the spot.

908
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:47,829
No.

909
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,236
No, we just met a few days ago.

910
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:53,173
(CHUCKLES) Around here,
that means you could be married.

911
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,178
Okay, Chloe, I'll give you
the last free bedroom.

912
00:56:56,246 --> 00:57:00,012
You look like you need it.
And feel free to use the computer.

913
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,744
This way, John.

914
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:07,079
I've got this foldout for you.

915
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,822
Okay.

916
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:15,592
So did you meet anyone you like?

917
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:23,171
Did you notice that the people here
are not very political?

918
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,730
I know. I know.

919
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:30,007
When you start something like this,
you take what comes.

920
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,776
Sex and politics.
What do you think the '60s were like?

921
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:40,687
I don't know. I wasn't born.

922
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:47,488
I'm gonna get my stuff for the...

923
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:51,662
For that. You're there. Okay.

924
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,836
Gloria offered to show us
around Winnipeg tomorrow.

925
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:00,705
Great, that should take about 10 minutes.

926
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:01,744
I thought it was nice of her.

927
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,871
Yeah, everyone here's real nice.

928
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:06,437
What's your problem?

929
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,347
It's freezing.

930
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:09,942
It's not always this cold.
It was 27 degrees...

931
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,384
27 degrees last weekend.

932
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,184
Yeah, I heard that
about a billion times already.

933
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:17,055
That, and the tall poppies,
and the universal health care.

934
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:20,357
You know what? My health care
was covered just fine by the US Army.

935
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,593
Yeah, I hear Baghdad Medical has really
great treatment for car bomb accidents.

936
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,361
Yeah, real funny, John.

937
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,993
What are you so mad about?

938
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,628
You lied to me.

939
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:30,070
I lied? I never lie.

940
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,300
Lying by not saying something is still lying.

941
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:35,606
You didn't tell me this thing was
about getting people to marry each other!

942
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,770
I didn't know.

943
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,974
You didn't know? The goddamn thing
is called Marry-A-Canadian.

944
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,643
What about a certain lie by omission
about you being in the Army?

945
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:43,743
That's different.

946
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,845
Yeah, it's much worse.

947
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,719
Who the fuck are you, John?

948
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,623
You know, you're not making
some big statement by coming up here!

949
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:55,187
You're just some big, hypocritical,
liberal pussy. All talk and no action!

950
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:56,789
- I was on the news!
- Big deal!

You don't think the Donkey Revolution
affects people?

952
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,095
Six people have read your blog, John!
More people have read my diary!

953
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:04,298
What about the fact
that I went to Ohio for the election?

954
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,432
Yeah, for like a week.

955
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:06,702
Oh, I bet you didn't even vote for Kerry.

956
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,801
I didn't vote at all!

957
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:16,375
You know, I was gonna ask
if I could sleep in your room tonight.

958
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:18,784
After you ignored me all night?

959

What are you doing?

960
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,330
You think I'm all talk?

961
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:31,127
I'm gonna do something right now.

962
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,189
You're drunk.

963
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:34,133
I was gonna do this last night, but...

964
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:36,337
Ow!

965
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,103
You would've been a lot better off
trying that last night.

966
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:43,669
Ow!

00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,077
CHLOE: Pussy!

968
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:48,742
Must've been a nasty slip.
Here put this on it.

969
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:51,718
Yeah, it was.

970
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:54,689
Yeah, stairs can be tricky sometimes.

971
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,584

You don't have to wear those jeans to bed.

You certainly don't have to sleep
on that sorry little death trap

Let me get that for you.

1021
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:17,784
Oh, no, I can do it.

1022
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,923
I thought after lunch we could go down
to City Hall and get our marriage license.

1023
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,259
I don't know.

1024
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:27,199
Well, don't worry. It just means that

1025
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:30,239
we have up to three months
to actually do the deed.

1026
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:34,606
Oh, okay, great... Good, so no rush.

1027
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:36,235
'Cause, you know,
I've only been here a day.

1028
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:39,748
No, I don't wanna force you
into anything, sweetheart.

1029
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:43,809
It's just that you wanna be able to do
what you came here for

1030
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:46,377
and, like, really make a difference.

1031
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:47,479
Yeah.

1032
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:51,721
So you need to start the process
to become a Canadian citizen.

1033
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:54,262
Well, I can apply for asylum.

1034
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:59,728
I wanna tell you something, John.

1035
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:00,928
Okay.

1036
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:05,633
You're the one I've had my eye on
ever since we first talked on the phone.

1037
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:06,800
Really?

1038
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:08,639
Yeah.

1039
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:13,145
I read your blog. You're an amazing writer.

1040
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:17,542
You've got brilliant ideas.

1041
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:22,523
I think you're a genius.

1042
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:25,288
No, I'm not. Well...

1043
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:29,161
You need to keep writing.
Keep experiencing.

1044
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,490
True.

1045
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:38,199
Wasn't last night incredible?

1046
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:42,534
Mmm-hmm.

1047
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,011
We're not in love with each other, John.

1048
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,069
Oh, I...

1049
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:48,014
I know, we're political activists.

1050
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:52,316
I wanna do this for you.
I wanna make you whole.

1051
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:20,943
Can I talk to you for a second?

1052
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,006
About what?

1053
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,711
I think you know.

1054
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:25,651
Isn't this what you came for?

1055
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:27,655
I don't know if I'm ready to do this.

1056
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:30,385
Hey, if the fact that she's a freaking
cult leader doesn't bother you,

1057
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:31,892
neither should the fact
that she's almost 50.

1058
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,792
No, it's not Gloria. I like Gloria.

1059
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,125
Good for you.

1060
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,757
Listen, I know you punched me
in the face last night, but...

1061
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:39,357
And I'll do it again.

1062
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:42,700
I just wanna talk to you
before I go in there and do this.

1063
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,935
I'm not your girlfriend.
I'm not your babysitter.

1064
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:49,375
You tried to kiss me last night,
and now you're marrying her?

1065
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,776
No, but I'm making a statement.

1066
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:52,541
Yes, you are.

1067
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,747
Gloria, how are you?

1068
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,120
Been showing my friends here
around the Peg this morning.

1069
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:04,159
SECRETARY: Oh, jeez, with the traffic
downtown these days, eh?

1070
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:05,523
Oh, it wasn't bad.

1071
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:08,256
So, what can we do you for today?

1072
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:11,098
We're getting married.

1073
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:13,931
People are just less selfish
around here, you know?

1074
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:16,801
Not always trying to get ahead.
Just seems in the States,

1075
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,773
people don't realize
that they're living in a society.

1076
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,833
And you'll have health care
once you're married,

1077
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:24,778
which is pretty darn important.

1078
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:27,941
Is it true that 45 million Americans
are not insured?

1079
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,315
How do Canadians know
all these facts about us?

1080
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,377
It's like a one-way mirror
across the border, right?

1081
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:35,185
We look across and see you,
and your movies,

1082
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:37,623
and your politicians, and your Paris Hiltons.

1083
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:41,356
Then you look across the border,
and you just see yourselves.

1084
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,419
Like I said, selfish.

1085
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,022
You know what I said to a friend of mine

1086
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,830
when he told me
he was moving to the States?

1087
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:50,599
I said, "Finally, you can tell me
how 300 million fat, stupid people

1088
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,300
"manage to run the world."

1089
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,501
Badly.

1090
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:54,702
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1091
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:57,109
Well, it's not that everyone's stupid.

1092
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,113
Right, fat and stupid.

1093
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,808
I thought Canadians
were supposed to be nice.

1094
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:03,613
We try to be, but you guys
have been pushing it lately.

1095
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,551
It's not us. It's our leaders.

1096
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:07,213
Who elects the leaders? The people.

1097
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:09,280
Technically, in the States
it's the Electoral College.

1098
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,087
See, that. How do you know that fact?

1099
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,220
Because we have to take a whole year
of stupid US history.

1100
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:18,357
Could you imagine if you had to take
a whole year of Canadian history?

1101
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,425
No. No, I couldn't.

1102
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:24,997
Now, let me get your witnesses in here,
and we'll have you ready to go.

1103
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:29,607
He doesn't like us very much.

1104
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:31,168
Oh, he likes you.

1105
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,442
No, I mean Americans. The US.

1106
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:36,781
Oh, don't worry,
you're one of the good guys now.

1107
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,919
Now, sign here.

1108
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:47,224
And you're one step closer
to being a Canadian.

1109
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,162
There.

1110
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:29,068
All I can see
is black and white

1111
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:31,504
And white and pink
with blades of blue

1112
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:35,305
That lay between the words
I think on a page

1113
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:37,004
I was meaning to send to you

1114
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:39,438

And I have an announcement to make.
John, get up here. Come on.

1119
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:01,263
I did my own piece of salvation today.

1120
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:04,864
John and I went down to City Hall
to get our marriage license.

01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:17,912
I'm the man who loves you

1125
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,168
We're leaving.

1126
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:44,371
Shouldn't you ask your wife first?

1127
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,778
I'm serious. Look, go upstairs, get the bags.

1128
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,579
I'll meet you outside with the car, okay?

1129
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,449
You're just gonna sneak out like that?

1130
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,646
You can't go.

1131
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:55,884
What do you think the mother hen
over there is gonna do when she finds out?

1132
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,653
We'll be gone before it matters.

1133
01:09:57,726 --> 01:10:00,718
This is how John takes a stand.
He runs away.

1134
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:03,827
Fine.

1135
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:09,564
That's how John makes a stand.

1136
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:11,369
I can't let you go, Chlo.

1137
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,464
We just met.

1138
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,099
You can handle a piece, right?

1139
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,200
What?

1140
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:18,474
We cross at Niagara Falls,
and then we head south.

1141
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:21,812
When we get to D.C.,
we go straight to the White House.

1142
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:25,012
We track them for a while.
And then when we get a chance,

1143
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:28,284
I take out Bush and you hit Cheney.

You're leaving?

1155
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:05,427
Yeah, I know we said some things,

1156
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:09,396
and, well, we did some things that
maybe gave you the wrong impression,

1157

but Chloe and I have to be going.

1158
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:14,901

- What?

Everyone has to do what you want,
on your schedule. And you bring a gun!

1162
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:31,276
Okay, now, I'm getting a little pissed off

all the time.

I'm sure we will, eventually.

01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:20,193
There are a thousand of them.
And we're not gonna run out of gas,

1188
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:23,095
we still have a quarter of a tank.

1189
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:26,100
And it's not a theory, it's a fact.

1190
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,098
I'm sorry.

1191
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:44,950
Sit anywhere you like.

1192
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:48,080
Actually, we had some car trouble.

1193
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:51,217
What's wrong with it?

1194
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:52,419
This is the man you wanna talk to.

1195
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:53,961
We ran out of gas.

1196
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:56,520
Gas station's closed this time of night.

1197
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,897
- Great.
- But I could siphon you some if you want.

1198
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:01,060
That would be great.

1199
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:02,398
Here, let me finish my food.

1200
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:05,804
Why don't you sit down
and order something?

1201
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:11,240
So what brings you to this
sparsely-populated neck of the woods?

1202
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:12,575
We came up from San Francisco.

1203
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,445
No shit! That's where I'm from.

1204
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:15,949
CHLOE: You're American?

1205
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:19,613
Yeah, but I been living here
more than 35 years, now.

1206
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:29,792
I'm afraid that won't take you very far.
Listen, I only live a few minutes away.

1207
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:33,426
Why don't you crash at my place tonight
and fill your tank up in the morning?

1208
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:34,526
You sure?

1209
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:38,061
Yeah, no problem. Company's a rare
commodity up here. It's always welcome.

1210
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,801
Follow my truck.

1211
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:49,075
JOHN: How'd you find this place?

1212
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,278
I built it.

1213
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:54,946
Old school, just like the trappers
and settlers used to do it.

1214
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:57,048
It's kind of like a...

1215
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,821
Lincoln Log house.

1216
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,260
Yeah, it's got everything you need.

1217
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:07,132
Heat, water, comfort. Excuse me.

1218
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:15,803
Here you go.

1219
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:18,210
- What is this?
- Charlie's Best.

1220
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:22,876
Yeah, I make beer. That's a lager.
I also make a Manitoba Pale Ale

1221
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:27,354
and a Strawberry Statement Stout.
That's a fruity kind of darker brew.

1222
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:30,357
Strawberry Statement, wasn't that,
that thing at Columbia University?

1223
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:31,449
(BEER CAP POPPING)

1224
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,519
You know about that? That's me.

1225
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:35,722
(CHARLIE LAUGHING)

1226
01:15:35,797 --> 01:15:37,162
You wrote The Strawberry Statement?

1227
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:40,224
No, no, I was just involved in all that.

1228
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:45,469
CHLOE: I'm sorry for sounding ignorant,
but what is The Strawberry Statement?

1229
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,908
Oh, when I was in college, a bunch of us
took over the university buildings

1230
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,707
to protest the war in Vietnam.
Then I got drafted,

1231
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:55,648
and when they refused to accept me
as a conscientious objector, I moved here

1232
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,379
and I've been here ever since.

1233
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:01,486
So you were a draft dodger?

1234
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,025
Yeah, I don't particularly like
to use that word, but...

1235
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:07,892
I think it's great. We're actually
moving up here to protest the war.

1236
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,021
You don't say?

1237
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:11,531
JOHN: Make a change
in the current administration.

1238
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,864
What a bunch of assholes, huh?

1239
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:17,167
So, in a way,
it's like we're carrying on your work.

1240
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,470
You know, I always say that people my age
don't have the dedication to their beliefs

1241
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:23,010
that people from your generation had.

1242
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:27,777
They say they believe in something,
but they don't do anything about it.

1243
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,510
Do you like it here?

1244
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,554
Well, it's my life.

1245
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:36,523
Would I do anything different? Probably.

1246
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:43,492
But what you did stood for something.
You took a stand against an unjust war.

1247
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:48,059
Yeah, and you think anybody gave a shit?
I mean, that's what I thought at the time.

1248
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:52,436
But in reality, I was just saving my ass.

1249
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:57,336
You know, nowadays, hell,
they don't even have the draft.

1250
01:16:57,412 --> 01:17:01,678
These soldiers that come up here,
what are they running from?

1251
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,183
So, what do you think?

1252
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,111
It's good.

1253
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:09,919
JOHN: Can I try the Strawberry Statement?

1254
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:12,688
It's not available right now.
It's a seasonal brew.

1255
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:21,894
Well, I gotta get some sleep.

1256
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:26,407
Have as much of the brew as you want.
The bathroom is the outhouse.

1257
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:30,844
And there's buffalo skins in that chest
over there if you get cold.

1258
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:32,971
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

1259
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,147
Wow.

1260
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:46,750
It's good.

1261
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,591
It is.

1262
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:51,090
Oh, come on, drink it.

1263
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,999
I am, I just wanna let it breathe.

1264
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:57,569
(GIGGLING) Yeah, right.

1265
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:02,577
It's true. We really didn't do anything.

1266
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,606
I was too drunk.

1267
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,048
You mean you couldn't get it up.

1268
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,778
I was too drunk.

1269
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:13,047
That's perfect.

1270
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:16,519
I thought something was going on
between you and Randall.

1271
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:19,059
He was a terrorist.

1272
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:22,153
But at least he was talking to me.

1273
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:24,690
I'm sorry I was an asshole.

1274
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:28,463
Yeah, you're pretty insensitive
for a liberal pussy.

1275
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:34,097
You want another beer?

1276
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:37,712
- Sure.
- Allow the liberal pussy to go get them.

1277
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:00,626
So where to now?

1278
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,966
I thought we'd live here.

1279
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,353
I'm gonna go back.

1280
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,483
If I don't face it all now,

1281
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:28,495
I'm gonna end up living in a log cabin
in 30 years in the middle of nowhere.

1282
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:30,360
That won't happen unless you let it.

1283
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,729
Or I'll end up marrying

1284
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,997
some crazy Canadian hockey player
just for the citizenship.

1285
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:38,597
No, there's people we can talk to.
They have lawyers that deal with this.

1286
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:42,973
What would your brother think? Honestly.

1287
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:47,879
Because I know what the rest of the troops
in my squad are thinking right now.

1288
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:52,052
My brother's dead.

1289
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:56,521
You serious?

1290
01:19:56,591 --> 01:20:00,652
It happened about three months
after "mission accomplished" and all that.

1291
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:03,289
His Chinook went down near Basra.

1292
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:07,659
It was totally pointless.

1293
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,463
And your parents? They don't know?

1294
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:16,907
Denial.

1295
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:19,276
I'm so sorry.

1296
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:23,340
We couldn't go five minutes
without getting into an argument,

1297
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:27,650
so I didn't talk to him
for about four months before it happened.

1298
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:31,584
He was just doing his job.

1299
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:37,330
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

1300
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,468
Listen,

1301
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:51,536
just drop me a mile from the border
or something, and I'll walk over.

1302
01:20:55,150 --> 01:21:00,110
You know, the election, my stupid blog,
this whole trip,

1303
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,452
you're the only good thing
that's happened in quite a while.

1304
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,322
So, I can take you.

1305
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:09,595
If you're with me,
you might end up getting involved.

1306
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:11,928
Getting detained or something.

1307
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:19,702
Just drop me off,
and then you can head on to Vancouver.

1308
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:27,805
If I kiss you now, are you gonna punch me?

1309
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:32,351
No.

1310
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,354
Are you sure? 'Cause...

1311
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:35,912
Yeah.

1312
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,856
'Cause it hurt.

1313
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,107
Hey, you gotta get up.

1314
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:34,209
Hi.

1315
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,215
We have to go.

1316
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:42,279
Wait, did you kill a bear last night?

1317
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:43,881
(CHUCKLING)

1318
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,451
Give me your hand

1319
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:55,427
The dog in the garden row
is covered in mud

1320
01:22:57,539 --> 01:23:02,306
And dragging
your mother's clothes

1321
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:11,217
I can walk from here.

1322
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:12,651
I'm gonna take you.

1323
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:15,121
Seriously, you don't have to.

1324
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:19,416
John, stop the car.

1325
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:38,305
You gonna be okay?

1326
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:40,636
Sure.

1327
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:45,317
When do think your trial's gonna be?

1328
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:46,979
Can't say.

1329
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:50,350
And what then?

1330
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:54,452
If I'm lucky,
I get some kind of dishonorable discharge.

1331
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:58,689
What about you and me?

1332
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:00,857
Seriously?

1333
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:02,892
Yeah.

1334
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:08,974
"Politics makes strange bedfellows."

1335
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:12,411
I read that on thedonkeyrevolution.com.

1336
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,209
You read that?

1337
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:19,915
You're pretty good.
More people should be reading.

1338
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:29,673
Hi, there. What's your citizenship?

1339
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:31,150
JOHN: US.

1340
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:34,554
How long have you been
outside the country?

1341
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:36,180
Just a few days.

1342
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:41,058
OFFICER: Have you been to any farms
while visiting Canada?

1343
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:42,357
JOHN: Does a log cabin count?

1344
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:43,419
OFFICER: No.

1345
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:44,153
(GATE BUZZING)

1346
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:05,879
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

1347
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:15,989
I got something to show you.

1348
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:21,795
I can't believe you're really doing this.

1349
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:25,526
Well, if I don't, who will?

1350
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:29,163
Missed you.

1351
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:31,034
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1352
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:43,048
It's all here

1353
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:46,512
Today is the only day

1354
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:50,648
The old times make way for the new

1355
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:10,771
Some fruit punch spills on a tablecloth

1356
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:14,804
But there ain't no mess to clean up

1357
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:21,511
Garbage in a can sticks together

1358
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:27,253
The tiniest of things are forever

1359
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:32,422
Drop a couple coins and a feather

1360
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:40,034
And watch them
float away at the same time

1361
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:45,876
Song is made with sugar and lemonade

1362
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:49,883
Sing on the porch, swing along

1363
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:57,482
Me and you having a barbecue

1364
01:29:57,558 --> 01:30:01,688
Sticking our thumbs in the air

1365
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:07,661
Meeting of some notes on a pocket

1366
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:13,568
Sitting in the sun with some chocolate

1367
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:19,704
Drop a couple pens and some pencils

1368
01:30:20,782 --> 01:30:25,344
And watch it all fall right into place
