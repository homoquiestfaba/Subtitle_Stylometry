1
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,703
Can I borrow that for a second?

2
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:42,674
[Breaking glass]

3
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,043
Ugh.

4
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,483
Jim?

5
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:52,651
Sup stupid?

6
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,197
So dad...

7
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,131
Like, dad, dad?

8
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,434
Like our- like our dad?

9
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:11,537
Who else's dad would I
be talking to you about?

10
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,238
That's nuts.

11
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,374
When's the funeral?

12
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:18,377
In Kansas City, which
means we have to leave...

13
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,379
Wait, did you say tomorrow?
-Yeah.

14
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,814
Oh, I can't go to that, dude.

15
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:24,083
What do you mean? Yeah you can.

16
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:27,186
No I can't. I have a lot
of shit going on here.

17
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,554
I can't just leave
everything, ok?

18
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,823
Ten minutes ago you were
passed out in a wigwam.

19
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:32,624
Yeah, well... no
it wasn't a wigwam.

20
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,393
Name one thing that
you have to do.

21
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:35,160
One.

22
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:35,828
Like tomorrow?

23
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,764
Well tomorrow is kind
of more of a setup day.

24
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,433
But I've got a lot
of things to...

25
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,170
If I named it, you wouldn't
understand it because...

26
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:47,139
It would- they're so
long-range that you wouldn't

27
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,140
understand how they work.

28
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,141
Just name one thing. One thing.

29
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,309
I'm getting a bird tomorrow.

30
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,215
I'm getting a bird. I can't
have the guy drop the bird

31
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,483
off tomorrow and me not be there

32
00:01:57,485 --> 00:02:00,352
Yeah, I'm being
extremely serious, dude.

33
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,820
It sounds like it's
not a big thing...

34
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,622
That doesn't count, Dave.
That's not...

35
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:08,360
Dude, I appreciate this
whole thing about you

36
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:12,764
And don't think it doesn't
touch me right here, dude.

37
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,867
But... bottom line,
I just can't go.

38
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,502
I'll give you a hundred
and fifty dollars if you

39
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,903
get in my car right now.

40
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,305
Let's go.

41
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,323
Hey dude, get dressed.

42
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,892
We got to meet mom and
Michelle at the steak-

43
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:40,726
get out of my room!

44
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:41,760
It's my room too, Dave.

45
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,563
You left and now
it's my room, ok?

46
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,298
Yeah, that's not how it works.

47
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,866
That's kind of exactly
how it works. It's called

48
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:52,304
the case of finders versus
keepers, and you're not involved

49
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,772
what are you looking for?

50
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,542
I'm looking for my Alonzo
mourning rookie card.

51
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,910
And please get out, because
I'm trying to find it and

52
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,545
your gonna screw up my
whole process.

53
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:03,482
But that's not why I want the
card. The card's worth like-

54
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:06,185
where the hell are my avs
posters?

55
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,886
You're avs posters are gone.
I took those down.

56
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,321
Why'd you take down
my avalanche posters?

57
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,722
Because the
avalanche suck, dude. Ok?

58
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,257
Redwings are where it was at.

59
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,725
I don't want any
losers on my walls.

60
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:14,927
Well where'd you put 'em?

61
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,696
I don't- I don't want people
thinking I'm a chelio's fan.

62
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,767
Nobody's gonna mistake
you for a chelios fan, ok.

63
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,335
Dude's a fucking warrior.

64
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,570
You're definitely more
of a forsberg guy.

65
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,305
I think people can tell that.

66
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,775
Please, get out of my room!

67
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:30,676
I'm trying to help you.

68
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,945
You're trying to bother me
when I'm trying to work.

69
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,546
Stop!

70
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,317
If I wasn't so scared about
tombstome pile driving you on

71
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,352
top of the card I'm looking for
and breaking it, your ass would

72
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:41,720
be on the ground right now. Ok?

73
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,490
Dude, an Alonzo mourning card
is not worth a lot of money.

74
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:48,260
It's gotta be worth at least
ten grand by right now.

75
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,495
I bet you ten grand that
it's not worth ten grand.

76
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,331
I'll be you ten grand that
if you hit me with that

77
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,765
umbrella again, I'm gonna
knock your teeth out.

78
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,637
Oww! Fuck, stop doing that!

79
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,506
So you wanna shove that whole
garbage bag behind the toilet

80
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,308
for like... two weeks, right?

81
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,577
Pop a straw in it, make
sure it doesn't blow up.

82
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,679
There you go, you have
a big bag of wine.

83
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,549
You know it's free, right?

84
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,684
What? Yeah. Just uh...

85
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,787
Saving this for later.
Jeez is that ok?

86
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,023
My dad's dead, and this guy's
being a fucking asshole.

87
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,858
Yeah, last time I saw
Devin he looked horrible.

88
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,993
Devin? Who's that?

89
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,461
Shut up, you don't know 'em.

90
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,463
His hair's falling out.
-Gross.

91
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,331
He's super fat.
-Woof.

92
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,499
Looks like he has a
sunburn all the time.

93
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,967
My two boys!

94
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,969
Oh mom, you found the wine.

95
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,771
Hi mom.

96
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,575
It's so good to see the
two of you together again.

97
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,443
I'm just glad we could
get this guy down here.

98
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,946
I just wish your
father was here to see

99
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,949
how handsome you both look.

100
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,852
He always was so...

101
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:50,756
It made him so happy to
see his two boys together.

102
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,858
Oh, I'm sorry honey.

103
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,728
I... I'm going to go grab
some of nonna's biscotti.

104
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,398
Can I bring either of
you anything?

105
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,932
I'm good.
-It's fine, thank you.

106
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,934
Bye mom.

107
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,569
Ok, here we go.

108
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,909
I'll tell you what,she's right
though. We do look pretty fly.

109
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,077
You look like an idiot.

110
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,746
You're wearing a
tuxedo to a funeral.

111
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:15,914
You look like a valet.

112
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,616
It's what you wear to a funeral.

113
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:21,486
You don't wear a sweater
and like a sweater tie,

114
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,521
or whatever that is, ok?

115
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:23,789
A sweater tie?
-You wear black.

116
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,057
Hey, you know what time it is?

117
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,692
Oh.

118
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:30,429
You're wearing a watch
which is what's fucked up.

119
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,732
Hey, what are you doing?

120
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,701
Hey, what's up?

121
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:36,768
What's that?

122
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,370
Uh... our inheritance.

123
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,771
Oh, nice. We rich, man?

124
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,107
Not quite. We did get
the lake house though.

125
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,342
Awesome, what else?

126
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,110
Uh, that's it.

127
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,512
Yeah, but apparently
it's worth a fortune.

128
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,848
Great. So I need
you to sign here.

129
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,352
Then I'm going to go down
to branson, talk to dad's

130
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,753
business partner charbineau.

131
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,956
He's gonna sell it for us,
we'll get big checks,

132
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,725
I'll give you yours,
I'll get mine...

133
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:02,094
Because I need to get
changed before we go.

134
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,896
I'm definitely coming with-
you're not going by yourself.

135
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,098
Dude, you're not coming with me.

136
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,700
You're- I know what
you're trying to do.

137
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:13,372
Dude, there's no deal. It's
all laid out in the will.

138
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,741
It's simple. We sign it over.

139
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:19,978
not gonna know what to get,
and what I need, ok?

140
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,714
Oh, all my fucking basketball-
-of value.

141
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,683
All my fucking baseball cards.
-Of value.

142
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,084
My Alonzo mourning rookie card.

143
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:29,621
I have a game worn belford
Jersey, three or four Simon

144
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,990
games, I don't think you
can even buy anymore.

145
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,960
I don't even think Milton
Bradley makes those anymore.

146
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:39,398
Six month's later, everything
seems to be ok, right?

147
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,467
No he didn't say I could borrow
the car, but I knew he was gonna

148
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,035
be passed out all day, so
the next thing I know,

149
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,137
I'm getting pulled over.

150
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:47,038
Whatever. I gotta
couple fake ids.

151
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,775
What's in the trunk? Case of
Antonio menderes cologne.

152
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,777
Stolen. Hot.
Malik told me it fell

153
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,112
off a truck later, I
don't believe that

154
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,615
anyway, I get called in, become
a guest of the state for a

155
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,717
couple months, and uh...

156
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,552
Jim!
-Stop! Did you see that?

157
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:01,553
I didn't do anything.

158
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,554
It's an umbrella.

159
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,023
Jim?
-It's an umbrella.

160
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,491
Bad luck, illegal.

161
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,593
Not- shouldn't be
doing it at dinner.

162
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,828
Why would you do that?
-Are you twelve?

163
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,763
Anyway, what were
we talkin' about?

164
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,532
Horsemilk? You said horsemilk.

165
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:14,733
I like chocolate milk.

166
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,736
That's why that whole
story came out of that.

167
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,805
Speaking of horsemilk,
where's Matt?

168
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,906
Max.

169
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,140
His name's Max.

170
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,475
He's asleep.

171
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:24,543
He's tired.

172
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,811
He's sleeping?

173
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,512

00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:02,525
She's already hooking us up.
I like this already.

862
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:03,860
For drink wise...

863
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:07,030
Other then these, just three
Tequila shots,

864
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:09,132
three orange whips, three beers.

865
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,100
That's it, for right now.

866
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,502
And you?

867
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:13,703
Oh no, it's for both of us.

868
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,205
We're brothers.
This is my brother.

869
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:15,905
Hi.

870
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:17,574
Oh hi.

871
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:19,943
I'm Dave by the way.
I forgot to- so rude.

872
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:21,077
Oh these are beautiful rings.

873
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:21,978
[Kisses]

874
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,112
Are those mood rings?

875
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,014
I can tell because you
look so happy.

876
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:26,015
And you are?

877
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,083
Jim.

878
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:27,984
Petra.

879
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,520
You have really nice hands.

880
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:31,988
I'm actually married so, uh...

881
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,756
Oh, me too.

882
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:36,159
Hey me too. We're all married.

883
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:36,993
No you're not.

884
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:41,498
I'm gonna get your food order
and deal with some other

885
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,700
costumers. I will be back.

886
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:46,636
Enjoy these drinks.
See you soon.

887
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:48,238
Thank you, bye.

888
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Dude, what the fuck
was that all about?

889
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:52,976
You talking about
being married and shit?

890
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:54,844
Like she doesn't wanna know-
she didn't ask you that.

891
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,646
She doesn't care about that, ok?

892
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:57,947
Me and her had a thing going.

893
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,517
You jumped in and tried to
get in on it too,

894
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:03,987
Ok, first off, she was
flirting with both of us.

895
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:06,890
No, first off, she was
being polite to you.

896
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:09,959
We had a flirt going, and you,
you kind of snuck in and she

897
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:12,962
felt kind of obligated because
this is like her job to like

898
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:14,664
make the costumers happy.

899
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,066
You know that girl's a hooker,
right?

900
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,669
Sorry. That was inappropriate.

901
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:22,005
That just shows what
my feelings are.

902
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:25,308
You talk about a guy's
girl like that...

903
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,811
I just had no idea that you
had such a thing for hookers.

904
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:32,015
She comes to this country from
Russia to try to make a living

905
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:34,050
for herself and you are
belittling her-

906
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,552
she's totally British.

907
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,321
She's not... I know what
Russian girls sound like.

908
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:39,822
You are the dumbest
person I've ever met.

909
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,190
She's Russian doing
a British accent.

910
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,159
You think she's a Russian
non-hooker, and

911
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,028
she's a British whore.

912
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,930
Let's just drop it.

913
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,165
She's a whore.

914
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:53,169
I'll do one for my
wife and one for me.

915
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:54,170
I love facial hair.

916
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,572
Facial hair is so sexy.

917
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:56,272
Right?

918
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:57,574
Let's do one before I go.

919
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,245
I'd grind you up and
turn you into a hotdog.

920
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,179
To your wife.

921
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:07,650
I feel like we're really putting
this in progress tonight.

922
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:13,056
Ebony and ivory go together...

923
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:14,023
Who am I?

924
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:14,857
Stevie wonder.

925
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:16,092
Ray Charles.

926
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,995
I don't smell like an idiot?
This is Louie ck, man.

927
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:19,896
Yeah?

928
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:20,763
Well. Good shit.

929
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,231
Haha, look at these guys.

930
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:25,168
What, this guy ever make
out with a girl before?

931
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,202
Look at him.

932
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:27,604
He's fumbling around.

933
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:29,872
Yeah, that's a joke.

934
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:31,007
She's not that hot.

935
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,241
Yeah, get it buddy.

936
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:33,209
Yeah.

937
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,744
Grab her ass.

938
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:37,680
Grab her ass. Finish.

939
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:42,919
business in an alley way.

940
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:44,087
Oww.

941
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:45,254
What the fuck?

942
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:49,025
How did a Latino bean and
broccoli turtle

943
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:50,293
end up in branson?

944
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,200
What happened to you?

945
00:43:57,202 --> 00:43:58,968
I just got my ass kicked.

946
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,703
I told you that
girl was trouble.

947
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:02,338
It wasn't her.
It was these guys.

948
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,106
Those guys?

949
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:04,807
Yeah.

950
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,776
Well I guess we should get rid
of your karate trophies 'cuz...

951
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:09,012
Me and my brother need
to tell you a secret.

952
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:10,213
Come here real quick.

953
00:44:10,215 --> 00:44:12,915
We just want to
bury the hatchet.

954
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:13,850
What are you doing, Dave?

955
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:18,354
Jim, we'll figure it out.
We always do.

956
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:19,389
No, we never do.

957
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:22,659
Now, what I don't understand
is, if these two guys

958
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:23,793
are from Cleveland,
then where are you-

959
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:24,927
[punch]

960
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,765
[Sigh]

961
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,300
You boys gonna be
here a long time.

962
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,986
See that?

963
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:51,287
Aviator.

964
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:52,689
That's me.

965
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:54,724
Flying this ship.

966
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,293
Now pick 'em up.

967
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:58,895
What? No.

968
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,432
That's alright.

969
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:05,968
The point I'm trying to
make is, I'm in charge.

970
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,070
You understand?

971
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:08,738
I'm the boss!

972
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,939
Bruce!

973
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:11,874
Heel.

974
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,245
Well, well, well.

975
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:17,113
[Chuckles]

976
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:18,715
I see you met my killer.

977
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:24,153
Y'all be careful, because
I say the word, he attacks.

978
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,756
What's the word?

979
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:27,957
Go.

980
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:28,825
Stop.

981
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:30,126
Did you say it?

982
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:31,494
Or were you just
telling 'em the word?

983
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:33,062
I was telling 'em
the word, Bruce.

984
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,330
Alright, 'cuz I just
wanted that word.

985
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:35,164
He's anxious.

986
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,332
He's hungry to kill.

987
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:37,433
I want the word.

988
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:40,169
Just like I'm
hungry for a snack.

989
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,072
Mmm.

990
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:46,275
He's hungry.

991
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,945
Do you want like a spoon?

992
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:49,946
Huh?

993
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:51,748
That you can eat with?

994
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:52,849
We got spoons here.

995
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:55,518
I happen to enjoy
it oyster style.

996
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,388
Are we actually being
charged with anything?

997
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,958
'Cuz legally if you're gonna
charge me with something,

998
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,293
you need to present me
with a police report.

999
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:06,496
Mm, yeah we got one.

1000
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:08,164
Gonna print out two
copies right now.

1001
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:10,266
Oh I don't actually have it.

1002
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,235
Well, y'all don't go nowhere.

1003
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,137
Bruce and I'll be right back.

1004
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:17,807
Donna, can you print out
them a police reports?

1005
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:19,442
Yeah.

1006
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:23,346
Smart shit with that
police report, dude.

1007
00:46:23,348 --> 00:46:25,114
Not really. I made it up.

1008
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,816
Really?

1009
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:29,252
It sounded real. Do you
think they know that?

1010
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:32,088
I don't know, but we gotta get
out of here as soon as possible,

1011
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,956
because you've already
cost us a day on the house.

1012
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,825
Fuck you, give me a
fucking break, dude.

1013
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,996
Everything I do is
just so fucking stupid.

1014
00:46:39,998 --> 00:46:41,998
And you have, like, so much more
important shit you have to do.

1015
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,199
Yeah, I agree.

1016
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:45,268
At least I'm there
when people need me.

1017
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,302
Oh, come on.

1018
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,571
I had to drive halfway across
the country to take you to your

1019
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:51,474
Oh, now you're the fucking
hero of the family.

1020
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:52,542
You can do whatever
the fuck you want.

1021
00:46:52,544 --> 00:46:54,143
Call everbody shitheads.

1022
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:54,977
That's all I'm saying.

1023
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:55,912
Yeah right.

1024
00:46:55,914 --> 00:46:57,213
I'm there and you're not.

1025
00:46:57,215 --> 00:46:58,281
When have I not been there?

1026
00:46:58,283 --> 00:46:59,348
A ton of times, like...

1027
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:02,451
That time I went to rehab.

1028
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:03,953
Remember? Remember that?

1029
00:47:03,955 --> 00:47:08,057
I was- I was like- I was having
some problems and you know mom

1030
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:10,259
and dad were there, and a couple
of other people were there,

1031
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:13,129
You know, everyone
was there but you. You know?

1032
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:17,466
You had some- you had some kind
of desimination you had to do.

1033
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:21,470
Yeah, and that's like a
book report kind of thing.

1034
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:24,006
It sounds like a really
important book report.

1035
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:27,877
Yeah I've got a fucking
book report to do. Whatever.

1036
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:32,315
The time I got arrested.
Remember when I got arrested?

1037
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:34,250
Mom and dad were in Europe.

1038
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:36,018

00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:51,680
Yes, I'm still going. Go away!

1209
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,649
Fucking pervert.

1210
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,418
I just feel like, I feel like
you're gonna break that window.

1211
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,353
I'm not gonna break
that window, ok?

1212
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:58,120
It's a tennis ball, ok?

1213
00:55:58,122 --> 00:55:59,455
Don't worry about it.

1214
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:00,823
You throw the ball up.

1215
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:03,359
I hit the ball, hits the
wasp nest, wasp nest falls.

1216
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,693
We run, lock
ourselves in the car.

1217
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,995
Pull around, run over the
wasp nest with the car.

1218
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:08,997
Killing the wasps, k?

1219
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:11,066
This seems like a
really shitty plan.

1220
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:12,868
It's not a shitty plan, ok?

1221
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,670
I've done this four times, dude.

1222
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:15,604
You've done this four times?

1223
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:16,105
Yeah.

1224
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:16,972
Did it work?

1225
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,474
Yeah, it worked.

1226
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:19,675
Three times.

1227
00:56:19,677 --> 00:56:21,410
What happened the fourth time?

1228
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:22,845
Ball guy fucked up.

1229
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:24,413
So...

1230
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:25,581
Don't screw this up.

1231
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:26,982
Ready?

1232
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:27,716
Yep.

1233
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:31,453
Get ready to run, 'cuz these
guys are going to be pissed.

1234
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,458
[Glass breaking]

1235
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:42,931
That's coming out of your half.

1236
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:45,801
Fuckin' bat had like pine
tar on it, or something.

1237
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,137
You did?

1238
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:50,906
That's awesome.

1239
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:53,809
Hold on, hold on.

1240
00:56:53,811 --> 00:56:56,111
What are you...? Stop, stop.

1241
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,719
Dude, all I'm saying is- like
irregardless of whether it's a

1242
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,654
good idea or not, you
can bet on wrestlemania.

1243
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:08,624
It's just like paying
attention to the characters.

1244
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:10,692
Well, they're not characters.
They're athletes.

1245
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:12,428
Oh, score dude.

1246
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:15,597
Check it out. Surge alert.
Take a rip, dude.

1247
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,165
Gross.

1248
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:17,866
I'll race ya.

1249
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,769
You're gonna get sick.

1250
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,039
That's like fifteen years old,
and surge is gross anyway.

1251
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:27,209
These are worth a ton. I
shouldn't of fucking drank that.

1252
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,977
You didn't open yours. That was
smart, dude. Profit.

1253
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:31,079
You totally overestimate
the collectables market.

1254
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,815
Dude, shit is worth
a lot of money.

1255
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:34,950
No, it's not. It's really not.

1256
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,452
Oh, shit dude.

1257
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:39,621
This might be a little
more your speed.

1258
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,660
Oh dude. Super Jack pot.

1259
00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:45,828
What's that?

1260
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:46,762
Party pills.

1261
00:57:46,764 --> 00:57:48,864
These are like tranquilizers.

1262
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:51,066
Let's get this
party started, dude.

1263
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,770
Dude, these are for Steve
when he got heartworms.

1264
00:57:54,772 --> 00:57:58,207
Yeah, they're tranqs dude.
They're like xanaxs.

1265
00:57:58,209 --> 00:58:00,943
You just gotta take like...

1266
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:03,679
You gotta get the ratio
of like dog to person.

1267
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:06,748
So like if he needed two,
I'll have like twelve.

1268
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:08,951
It's not rocket science, dude.

1269
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:10,953
Yeah, you're right. It's
like actual science.

1270
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,156
You alright, man?

1271
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:16,692
You look fucked up.

1272
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:19,728
I just chugged that
surge too fast.

1273
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,498
Shit's like fifteen cups of
coffee straight to the dong.

1274
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,166
I'm pretty sure it's
those dog pills.

1275
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,001
Want me to take you to the vet?

1276
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,236
Uneccessary.

1277
00:58:27,238 --> 00:58:29,905
Iron stomache man, I told you.

1278
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:36,278
Oh hey, I got it.

1279
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,913
Check it out. I'm gonna kill
so many fucking wasps.

1280
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:41,183
I'm gonna go kill some,
like, churros real quick.

1281
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:41,984
I'll be right back.

1282
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,621
[Crash]

1283
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:56,131
[Cell ringing]

1284
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:07,776
[Home phone ringing]

1285
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,681
Jim, what is taking so long?

1286
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:13,782
We're fixing a house.

1287
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:14,883
This isn't easy.

1288
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:18,253
Didn't you say that your dad's
business partner had some

1289
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:19,721
crew that he could hire?

1290
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:21,823
That's gonna cost like
thousands of dollars,

1291
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:24,826
and Dave and I are doing this.
It's like a brother thing...

1292
00:59:24,828 --> 00:59:28,096
This isn't an excuse for you to
go run off and, like, live out

1293
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:29,765
your childhood
with your brother.

1294
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:31,833
I'm not reliving my childhood.

1295
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:32,935
I'm doing the best that I can.

1296
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:34,169
I need you do something, Jim.

1297
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:35,704
I need you to take action.

1298
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:37,606
Like what? What do
you want me to do?

1299
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:41,877
Hire the guys, get the
money, and come home.

1300
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,315
Yeah, it's right
off seventy-five.

1301
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:49,851
What's up, big brother?

1302
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:51,019
Go on a little nature hike?

1303
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:52,654
Yeah I wanted to
walk around the lake.

1304
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,058
You look like you've
had a productive day.

1305
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,326
You fix that screen door.

1306
00:59:57,328 --> 01:00:00,596
I stole a bunch of this screen
door stuff from this

1307
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,798
country club down the street.

1308
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:09,104
He was like... he said he paid
for all this shit that we broke

1309
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:12,240
But I don't know what
he's talking about there.

1310
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:15,043
He also said he wanted to
take us out to dinner tonight.

1311
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:15,944
And I was like, I
don't know about that.

1312
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,045
Sounds kinda weird.

1313
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:20,382
They were giving them away.
Can you believe that?

1314
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:23,385
Just like some kind of
jacket giveaway or something.

1315
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:28,256
There was just like a whole room
of 'em just like racked up,

1316
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,626
and I'm like, oh awesome.
I took like five.

1317
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:32,828
Did you rob a coat room?

1318
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,098
Rob a? No man.

1319
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:36,999
Oh dude, check this out.

1320
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,067
That's badass.

1321
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:43,805
I did a bunch while you were
gone doing whatever,

1322
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,774
but we got like a ton of work.
I gotta big list.

1323
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:46,742

That's yours.

This is awesome.

1326
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,278
We got two.

1327
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,279
It's like Batman and Robin.

1328
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,948
Suit up.

1329
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,650
We gotta lot of work today.

1330
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:56,952
What the fuck is that?

1331
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:58,687
Hold on, we got intruders.

Hey, asshole.

1335
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:05,327

1336
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:07,162
I'm giving you ten seconds to
get out of my fucking driveway.

1337

Chill out. Chill out, chill out.

01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:16,271
I'm giving you ten seconds to
get your piece of shit truck

1339
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:18,874
out of my driveway, ok?
This is my property.

1340
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:20,308
I was over there. I could
not hear you well.

1341
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:23,211
Get your fuckin' goon
squad out of my property.

1342
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:24,112
[Laughing]

1343
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:25,881
What is this? What?

1344
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:26,682
He's just joking.

1345
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:27,282
You are very funny.

1346
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:28,016
No, I'm not joking.

1347
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:28,884

1348
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:32,254
I'm javier. This is my
associate, Trevor.

I am Ivan.

1350
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:36,992
Why are you, why do
you know these guys?

1351
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:38,160
Because I hired 'em.

1352
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:39,127
For what?

1353
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:40,762
To fix the fucking house.

1354
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:42,064
We don't need any help
with the fuckin' house.

1355
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:43,465
We need so much help!

1356
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:44,733
There's nothing wrong with it.

1357
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:46,101
We have no idea what
we're doing.

1358
01:01:46,103 --> 01:01:47,703
We just gotta- branches.

1359
01:01:47,705 --> 01:01:49,171
It's not branches.

1360
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:50,238
We don't need four guys...

1361
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,074
You should put
him in a birdcage.

1362
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:56,111
So he can keep chirping
to his heart's delite.

1363
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:57,879
I got two chirps for you, ok?

1364
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,915
One of them's gonna
be me hitting you.

1365
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:03,752
The other chirp's gonna be
me kicking him in the dick.

1366
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:04,319
What about me.

1367
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:05,220
I'm still here.

1368
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:06,154
Nah, it's not worth it.

1369
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:07,089
Not even worth it, slim.

1370
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:08,023
You want to hit me?

1371
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:08,990
He doesn't want to hit you.

1372
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:09,991
Get the fuck out of here.

1373
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:11,393
Get in the fucking truck-

1374
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:12,861
how 'bout I slap your face?

1375
01:02:12,863 --> 01:02:13,929
How 'bout you fucking try it?

1376
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:17,499
Listen, we're doing you a favor.

1377
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:19,367

Woah, hey.

1380
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,807
Can I talk to you
inside for a second?

1381
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:27,909
Charbineau got this guy to
give us a hell of a deal

1382
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:31,513
I'm so fucking sick of your
cut and run bullshit, dude.

1383
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:33,915
You're taking something that's
so awesome and special and

1384
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,383
you're just fucking ruining
it and I don't know why.

1385
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:36,118
I'm ruining it?

1386
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:41,089
on purpose. Ok?
This guy on the other hand,

1387
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:43,792
can have us home within a week,
checks in hand.

1388
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:44,526
I don't care about that.

1389
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:47,529
I don't trust this guy.
I don't trust charbineau.

1390
01:02:47,531 --> 01:02:49,498
You know what, you're on the
chopping block too, buddy.

1391
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,366
Why do you have to make
things so much more difficult?

1392
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:53,535
Oh here comes Tim
the tool man Taylor now.

1393
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:55,804
You come to chirp with
us, my little bird?

1394
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,140
Dave?

1395
01:02:58,142 --> 01:02:59,174
You got iced out.

1396
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,077
Ooh, I feel bad.

1397
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,846
What the fuck is going on, man?

1398
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:05,947
Huh?

1399
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,082
Hey.

1400
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:09,217
Look at him in his
piece of shit car.

1401
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:10,252
That's my car.

1402
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:12,087
It's a piece of shit.

1403
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,089
Woah, come on. Watch it.

1404
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:26,168
♪♪

1405
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,085
Oh.

1406
01:04:50,087 --> 01:04:51,620
Hey, do you know where Petra is?

1407
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:52,888
I'm sorry, what?

1408
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:56,324
Do you where Petra is?

1409
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:58,226
I understand English.

1410
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,061
Are your pants on backwards?

1411
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:03,365
No, my pants aren't... oh,
maybe, yeah. I drove here.

1412
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:05,066
Why do you drive with
pants on backwards?

1413
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,368
I don't drive with my
pants on backwards.

1414
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:07,602
I drive with no pants.

1415
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:08,570
It's this thing
my dad taught me.

1416
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:09,337
You wouldn't understand.

1417
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:10,171
Do you work here?

1418
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:11,973
Yes, but I just got off.

1419
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:16,044
Yes, but why do you
want her and not me.

1420
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:17,345
What are you talking-
why would I want-?

1421
01:05:17,347 --> 01:05:18,380
Listen, I just met you.

1422
01:05:18,382 --> 01:05:19,214
Is that a joint?

1423
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:20,582
No.

1424
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:23,018
Can you get a joint?

1425
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,287
All I'm saying is if you're
gonna hire a bunch of guys

1426
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:28,690
Talk to me about it first, ok?
Why's that so hard.

1427
01:05:28,692 --> 01:05:29,591
I'm a grown up.

1428
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:31,993
If you got a problem,
let's talk about it.

1429
01:05:31,995 --> 01:05:34,596
Why don't you just apologize to
him and tell him all the things

1430
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,264
you're telling me?

1431
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,432
It's not that easy, lady.

1432
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:38,566
Why not?

1433
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:40,035
Is it because you're a man?

1434
01:05:40,037 --> 01:05:44,105
No, it's because we're brothers
and we're super competitive.

1435
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,007
We've been fighting
our whole lives.

1436
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:48,276
I'm smarter than he is and I
think he's starting to realize

1437
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:51,046
that, and that's pissing
him off real bad.

1438
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:52,047
You wouldn't understand.

1439
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:54,449
Why would I not understand?

1440
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,084
Wait, is Petra one
of your sisters?

1441
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:59,287
What- what is this
with you and Petra?

1442
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:03,191
You know, I can do whatever it
is that you like that she does.

1443
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:05,427
Don't worry about it.
Just, where is Petra?

1444
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:07,696
I don't know. In Mr.
charbineau's restaurant.

1445
01:06:07,698 --> 01:06:09,030
Is that Mr. charbineau?

1446
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:10,465
Hey, that guy is
supposed to be our guy.

1447
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,067
You get worked up very easily.

1448
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:13,702
Does everybody in this
fucking town know each other?

1449
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:16,071
Everybody knows Mr.
charbineau, you know?

1450
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:18,173
You said he's at a restaurant?

1451
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:24,279
Oh, you're on time.

1452
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:27,515
Alright, lay down eight
times on the redskins.

1453
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:29,351
Gotta call, bye.

1454
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,521
So, what's up?

1455
01:06:33,523 --> 01:06:35,757
You look sad.

1456
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:37,125
I got a lot to be sad about.

1457
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:37,625
Do you?

1458
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:38,626
Yep.

1459
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:41,029
You know, when I
feel that way...

1460
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:47,035
Two things you have to remember.

1461
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:51,272
Know how to party.
Know how to forgive.

1462
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:56,244
Honestly, John, that's the worst
advice anyone's ever given me.

1463
01:06:56,246 --> 01:07:00,382
That's what I thought when
your father told it to me.

1464
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:02,650
Now I have a surprise for you.

1465
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:04,519
I want you to meet
your dad's old gang.

1466
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:10,392
Not like I'm gonna pop a cap
in your ass, it's more like

1467
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:14,796
legitimate business associates.

1468
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:16,564
Ah, alright.

1469
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:20,668
The guy cheating at cards,
that's Jimmy two tone.

1470
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:24,239
Nicky mo, and this is
Mr. ballbuster himself.

1471
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:26,374
Who is this?

1472
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,109
Who is this? Who is this?

1473
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:29,244
No, who is this?

1474
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:30,311
Look at the face.

1475
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:31,413
Right, right.

1476
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:32,480
[Laughing]

1477
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:37,318
And the apple is the bread.

1478
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,586
[Laughing]

1479
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:40,789
And that is how you
make a fruit sandwich.

1480
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:43,825
[Laughing]

1481
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,796
Him I think you know. Ivan!

1482
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:49,731
Gustovia, huh.

1483
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:52,367
[Banter]

1484
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:58,306
Remember, party, forgiveness.

1485
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:04,245
Pretty good. Hey Ivan, I just
want to apologize for

1486
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:07,549
Oh no, no, no.
No apologies necessary.

1487
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,716
No, no, no.

1488
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:10,185
You are in the clear, my friend.

1489
01:08:10,187 --> 01:08:12,087
[Laughing]

1490
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:15,557
Here's to my new
best friend, Jim.

1491
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:17,292
Jim!

1492
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,562
Happy Birthday, Jim!

1493
01:08:20,564 --> 01:08:21,729
Happy Birthday.

1494
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:22,697
It's not my birthday.

1495
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:23,765
That's my brother.

1496
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:26,334
Is it your birthday?

1497
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:28,403
I don't know.

1498
01:08:28,405 --> 01:08:33,508
I recently saw that movie
Alice in wonderland, and they

1499
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:37,846
celebrate every day it is
not their birthday.

1500
01:08:37,848 --> 01:08:40,782
I see that movie and I say that
is going to be my life now,

1501
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,117
so...

1502
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:44,786
[Laughing]

1503
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:47,722
Hey!

1504
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:51,259
How do I do it compared to you?
Hey!

1505
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:54,629
I can do- I can do any voice.

1506
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:57,599
Name a celebrity. Name one.

1507
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,636
Let's get a bottle of
renyaki for my friends here.

1508
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:04,139
I'd love to stay for a drink.

1509
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:05,507
So stay.

1510
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:08,643
American style.

1511
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:09,811
Let's tear down the walls.

1512
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:11,880
Let's tear down the walls, Jim.

1513
01:09:11,882 --> 01:09:14,382
I've never shotgunned
a beer before.

1514
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:15,717
I've shotgunned other things.

1515
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:17,585
Ahhh.

1516
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:19,154
Other things.

1517
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:21,456
Like a fucking person.

1518
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:23,758
[Laughing]

1519
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,228
I've never killed anyone.

1520
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:30,565
Dave, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

1521
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:33,334
I'll go outside with you,
but I'm going back in, ok?

1522
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:35,403
I'll be right back, alright?

1523
01:09:35,405 --> 01:09:36,671
Yes, yes, yes.

1524
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:37,739
You'll be write back.

1525
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:39,307
Get the renyakis going.

1526
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:40,475
You better be ready
when I get back.

1527
01:09:40,477 --> 01:09:42,844
We're shotgunning
beers when I come back.

1528
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:45,280
You come back or I'll
fucking kill you.

1529
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:47,916
[Laughing]

1530
01:09:47,918 --> 01:09:49,717
I'm not joking, I'm not joking.

1531
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:51,286
If he doesn't come
back, we kill him.

1532
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:52,620
Yeah, for sure.

1533
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:54,756
Petra's friend brought
me to meet with charbineau.

1534
01:09:54,758 --> 01:09:57,725
Fucking charbineau brought me.

1535
01:09:57,727 --> 01:10:00,228
He brought- oh ok, sent
me a letter, brings you. Ok.

1536
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,262
He set this up. I got it.

1537
01:10:01,264 --> 01:10:03,198
Very cool, very cool.

1538
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:03,731
Let's head back in.

1539
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:05,667
Wait, wait, wait.

1540
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:09,971
I just want to say, uh, I'm
sorry for, uh, going behind your

1541
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:11,940
back and hiring those guys.

1542
01:10:11,942 --> 01:10:14,442
Like, we said it was going
to be like a brother project.

1543
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:15,577
I should've consulted with you.

1544
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:21,983
plan's not going as smoothly
as I kinda talked it up to be.

1545
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:24,852
And maybe tomorrow I'll get some
fresh eyes on those blueprints.

1546
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:27,989
Maybe skim them, cut the-
trim the fat a little bit.

1547
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:30,725
I really think we should
consider hiring these guys.

1548
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:31,593
You want to hire these guys?

1549
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:35,730
They know less about building
houses than me or you, k?

1550
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:36,965
I don't think that's possible.

1551
01:10:36,967 --> 01:10:38,633
Dude, I got an idea.

1552
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:41,603
Me and you head back in

01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:20,428
I remember when he, uh...

1727
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,865
We made that rock tumbler
out of the washing machine.

1728
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:27,401
Try to fix it with
the, uh- lawn mower.

1729
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:28,769
Lawn mower, yeah.

1730
01:18:28,771 --> 01:18:30,137
Yeah.

1731
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:32,239
He was pissed, but he still
tried to show us how

1732
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:33,074
to put it back together.

1733
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:38,412
Am I just taking you
to the airport, or what?

1734
01:18:38,414 --> 01:18:40,181
I don't think so, man.

1735
01:18:40,183 --> 01:18:41,048
What?

1736
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,417
What are you going to do?

1737
01:18:43,419 --> 01:18:44,919
I'm thinkin' about just stayin'.

1738
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,055
[Crack]

1739
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,356
[Whistles]

1740
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:52,893
Staying where?

1741
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:53,894
Uh, here.

1742
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,329
Like staying here.

1743
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:57,164
Like in branson?

1744
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:59,133
Like at this house.

1745
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:09,143
We kinda- like we
got a plan, Dave.

1746
01:19:09,145 --> 01:19:12,046
We're supposed to go pick up our
checks from charbineau tomorrow

1747
01:19:12,048 --> 01:19:13,147
and sign the deeds.

1748
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:14,215
I mean, you can still do that.

1749
01:19:14,217 --> 01:19:16,383
I'm just sayin' that...

1750
01:19:16,385 --> 01:19:20,087
I'm probably gonna sit that one
out, you know.

1751
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:25,459
I mean I haven't found
my basketball cards.

1752
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:27,528
I haven't found my karate
trophies, you know?

1753
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:29,330
They're not even done
with the house really.

1754
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:30,898
I feel like...

1755
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,000
I just feel that you could buy-
you could buy

1756
01:19:33,002 --> 01:19:36,070
new versions of those. You could
buy all the basket ball

1757
01:19:36,072 --> 01:19:37,772
cards you want. All the- yeah.

1758
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:40,775
You could become a
great karate guy.

1759
01:19:40,777 --> 01:19:43,244
I feel like I already did it.
I already got the trophies.

1760
01:19:43,246 --> 01:19:45,045
Just find the trophies.
That's all I need.

1761
01:19:45,047 --> 01:19:48,916
And I mean, I can buy basketball
cards, but why buy something-

1762
01:19:48,918 --> 01:19:51,018
you could buy- you could buy a
lot of stuff I mean, this is-

1763
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:53,020
I mean we're gonna make a lot
of money with this thing.

1764
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:57,191
But it's not the same thing. I
mean this place has got

1765
01:19:57,193 --> 01:19:58,859
the memories though, you know?

1766
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:00,427
You can't buy those.

1767
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:08,202
You kinda like go out and meet
new people, make new memories.

1768
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:10,037
And half of it's mine,
so I figured-

1769
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:12,807
yeah, but you can't sell
half a house.

1770
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:16,443
Eh, that kind of sounds
like a Jim problem thing.

1771
01:20:17,847 --> 01:20:21,916
I know that's what
it sounds like.

1772
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:23,584
I does sound like it, because
that's what's happening.

1773
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:25,419
But I feel like, you're
kinda fucking me by-

1774
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:27,087
you can't stay in branson the
rest of your life because

1775
01:20:27,089 --> 01:20:29,423
you want to fuck some British
hooker. Alright, man?

1776
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:33,861
Dude, she is definitely
fucking British, and she is

1777
01:20:33,863 --> 01:20:35,329
definitely a hooker, and you're
definitely acting like

1778
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,131
a fucking idiot right now.

1779
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:38,465
I'm not a fucking idiot, man!

1780
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:41,268
Yeah, you are a fucking idiot.

1781
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,337
What did I tell you?

1782
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:44,905
Why does it have to be so
difficult all the time?

1783
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,874
Because my life is
fucking difficult, Jim.

1784
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:48,209
Why don't you understand that?

1785
01:20:48,211 --> 01:20:52,246
The only different is, I don't
cry about it all the time.

1786
01:20:52,248 --> 01:20:55,583
I fucking set goals and
follow through with them.

1787
01:20:55,585 --> 01:20:57,918
I don't bail at the
fucking last minute.

1788
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,486
Go somewhere, Dave.
Fucking do something!

1789
01:20:59,488 --> 01:21:02,456
Back to the fucking Indian
reservation where I lived

1790
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:04,425
in a fucking teepee?

1791
01:21:04,427 --> 01:21:06,427
Or back to mom's basement, ok?

1792
01:21:06,429 --> 01:21:10,064
You have as many
opportunities as everyone else.

1793
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:12,199
You don't fucking know me. You
don't know anything about me.

1794
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,934
You don't see these things
because you walk around with

1795
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:15,035
your fucking eyes
closed all the time.

1796
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:20,040
And you just sit and you bitch
and moan and-

1797
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:23,110
I work for that! I worked for
everything I've had.

1798
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:24,311
You don't work.

1799
01:21:24,313 --> 01:21:25,946
You don't fucking try, David.

1800
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:27,581
I've worked at a
lot of shit, ok?

1801
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:29,583
And sometimes that shit
doesn't work out, ok?

1802
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:36,457
I knocked my fucking
girlfriend up in college.

1803
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:37,524
So, you know what I did?

1804
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:38,626
I married her.

1805
01:21:38,628 --> 01:21:40,661
I manned up and I married her.

1806
01:21:40,663 --> 01:21:42,396
And I took a shitty job
that I hate-

1807
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:46,533
oh that sucks. My wife loves me
too much, and I have-

1808
01:21:46,535 --> 01:21:50,337
and awesome job and a car and
I write books all the time.

1809
01:21:50,339 --> 01:21:52,306
Oh my God, give me
a fucking break.

1810
01:21:52,308 --> 01:21:53,007
Our house is on fire.

1811
01:21:53,009 --> 01:21:54,008
Oh shit.
-Fuck.

1812
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:54,909
Do something!

1813
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:56,210
Dave, that's not gonna help.

1814
01:21:56,212 --> 01:21:58,579
Oh shit, what do we do?!

1815
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:00,347
Dave, we gotta get out of here.

1816
01:22:00,349 --> 01:22:02,149
No, this is all I have.

1817
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:03,050
This is all I got.

1818
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:06,620
This is all I got.
I can't bail. Alright?

1819
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:09,056
I'm not bailin'. I'm stayin'.

1820
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:12,126
Fine. Me neither.

1821
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:16,931
You stay, I stay.

1822
01:22:16,933 --> 01:22:19,099
I'm not gonna bail on you, Dave.

1823
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:20,601

1824
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:22,336

01:22:22,338 --> 01:22:24,438

Oh boy.

1832
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:14,388
Alright, have a seat.
I'm all ears.

1833
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:26,133
So...

1834
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:28,669
Here's what happened.

1835
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:33,173
As far as I can remember,
we were on the deck.

1836
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:37,778
We were playing
with some fireworks.

1837
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:42,416
And uh, I'm gonna go ahead
and admit that we

1838
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:44,218
were drinking some whiskey.

1839
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,587
John, we burned the house down.

1840
01:23:46,589 --> 01:23:49,323
We burned the whole fucking
house to the ground.

1841
01:23:49,325 --> 01:23:52,092
It's fucking- nothing's
there anymore.

1842
01:23:52,094 --> 01:23:53,660
And it was an accident.

1843
01:23:53,662 --> 01:23:56,697
And if there's anyway we can
salvage any kind of value from

1844
01:23:56,699 --> 01:24:00,567
the property, I'd like to
have Jim to have it,

1845
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:03,470
if that's possible.

1846
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:05,672
John, do you understand
what I'm saying?

1847
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:06,707
The house is fucking gone.

1848
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:08,142
There's nothing left.

1849
01:24:08,144 --> 01:24:09,209
It's burned to the ground.

1850
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,244
We burned the house down.

1851
01:24:10,246 --> 01:24:11,512
I know.

1852
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:13,280
What?

1853
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:15,349
I said I know.

1854
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:19,353
You think houses burn
down here all the time?

1855
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:27,561
Ok? Um...

1856
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:28,829
Now what?

1857

1859
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:43,277
I'm uh... I'm confused.

1860
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:45,312
You think I didn't take our
insurance policy the minute

1861
01:24:45,314 --> 01:24:46,513
you two bozos showed up?

1862
01:24:49,284 --> 01:24:52,086
I was gonna demolish
the thing anyway.

1863
01:24:52,088 --> 01:24:55,189
Now, you actually got me a
buck with the insurance claim.

1864
01:24:55,191 --> 01:24:58,492
John, why did you
have us fix the house?

1865
01:24:58,494 --> 01:25:01,795
We almost killed each other,
man. What is wrong with you?

1866
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:03,764
Yeah, well...

1867
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:09,503
I just felt it somethin'
you're dad woulda wanted.

1868
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:14,608
Besides we don't get too much
action around here, so it was

1869
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,243
nice to have you about.

1870
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:18,545
You motherfucker!

1871
01:25:18,547 --> 01:25:20,414
I'll show you action, John.

I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool.

You piece of shit.

1874
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:31,391
I grabbed this stuff
when your dad passed.

1875
01:25:31,393 --> 01:25:34,261
I was gonna mail it to you
if you hadn't shown up.

1876
01:25:34,263 --> 01:25:36,530
Some cards in there.

1877
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:42,903
Boys, do me a favor.

1878
01:25:42,905 --> 01:25:45,439
Don't spend it all in one place.

1879
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:49,209
You already have
everything you need.

1880
01:25:49,211 --> 01:25:51,378

So, what's your next move, man?

1884
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:16,904
Thinking about opening up my own
dojo. That'd be cool.

1885
01:26:16,906 --> 01:26:19,673
Really? Can you do that
as a green belt?

1886
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:22,743
Yeah, a lot of people don't
know this, in judo, green belt's

1887
01:26:22,745 --> 01:26:24,511
actually higher than black.

1888
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:25,345
Really? I've never heard that.

1889
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,314
Yeah, it's true.

You gonna be ok?

1892
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:35,422
Yeah, I think so.

1893

01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:50,204
I was gonna chop them
up with an axe but...

1898
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:52,272
I figured I owed you one.

1899
01:26:52,274 --> 01:26:55,209
Oh man, that's an extra
ten grand right there.

1900
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:56,310
Yep.

1901
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:58,378
Thanks, Jim.

1902
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,746
Awesome.

1903
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:02,649
Man.

1904
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:08,255
How 'bout that watch, huh?

1905
01:27:08,257 --> 01:27:11,625
Alright, ok. See you later.

1906
01:27:12,795 --> 01:27:15,829
I'm trying to give you a
hug, you fucking asshole.

1907
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:16,797
No you're not.

1908
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:21,301
Ow, you're fucking dead.

1909
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:25,706
Why don't you use your
karate moves, dude?

1910
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:26,873
Fuck you.
