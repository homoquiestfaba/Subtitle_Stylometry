(Boy) 'lt was Freak

3
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,960
'how he got this round table

4
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,480
'and how he got the bravest knights
in the world to sit at that table.

5
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,040
"'We will be brothers,"
said King Arthur...

6
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,000
"'and we will fight
for all those who ask for help.

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,040
"'We will be gentle to the weak

8
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,080
"'but terrible to the wicked."

'I call them Gram and Grim.

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,840
'I saw a painting in a book once,
it must be famous,

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,880
'this old dude and his wife
standing in front of a farmhouse.

15
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,240
'This dude's holding a pitchfork
and he looks like he never smiles.

16
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,960
'His wife don't look
too much happier.

17
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,600
'That's Gram and Grim.

18
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,120
'Course, there's a good reason
they look like that all the time -

19
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,160
'they got stuck with me. '

20
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,880
(Bell)

21
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,160
(Kids chattering)

22
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,280
'When you're in the seventh grade
and you look like Godzilla,

'you're gonna get the looks
and you're gonna get the whispers.

24
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,520
'Sometimes it seemed like
the whole world

00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,880
'had just seen me

(Distant siren)

27
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,920
Get the hell off me!
Go on, go on! Get away!

28
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,600
(Tramp)
My friend in the guest bedroom,

29
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,160
he doesn't like to be disturbed!

30
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,920
'The Doghouse Boys liked to make
trouble any way they could. '

31
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,080
(Tramp) Get outta here, little prick!

32
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,520
'Their leader was Blade...

33
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,360
'whose claim to fame
was three months in juvy hall. '

34
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,560
Here's a nice place to sit.

35
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,080
Check it out. The Missing Link,
with headphones, huh?

36
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,360
How do you fail the seventh grade
twice in a row, huh?

37
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,280
You gotta try pretty hard to do that.

38
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,600
# Killer Kane, Killer Kane,
had a son who got no brain

39
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,480
- # Killer Kane... #
- Stop, stop, stop.

40
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,080
People look at you and laugh
or they run the other way.

41
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,680
You got no friends. You got nobody.

42
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,600
- You're a freak of nature, dude.
- (Laughter)

43
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,560
But we wanna be your friends.
We could use some muscle like you.

44
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
I bet you could do some damage.

45
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,360
Just like your big, bad dad.

46
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,440
(Kids) Ohhh.

47
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,160
(Bell)

48
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,080
# Killer Kane, Killer Kane,

00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,800
(Echoing) # Killer Kane, Killer Kane,

50

# Killer Kane, Killer Kane... #

51
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,160
'There's a place I go
in my head sometimes.

52
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,280
'lt's cool and dim in there
and you float like a cloud. '

53
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,080
(Birds twittering)

54
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,160
'Now you are a cloud,

55
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,120
'the kind you see in the sky
on a windy day.

56
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,960
'You don't have to think
about anything.

57
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,360
'You're nothing, you're nobody. '

58
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,280
(Gram) Well, I have to go
to the market anyway.

59
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,080
I see that Cooper's has pot roast
on special,

60
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,120
$1.49 a pound.

61
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Did you notice
we have new neighbours?

62
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,640
They moved up here from St Louis.

63
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Her name's Gwendolyn.

64
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,120
She'd be just about
your mother's age.

65
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,280
You know what I heard is...

66
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,520
her son has been in some kind of
special hospital down in St Louis.

67
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,200
(Gram) The good Lord
gives women the cross to bear.

68
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,920
Would the good Lord get you
to bring me a cup of coffee?

69
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,160
'lt was Freak
told me about King Arthur.

70
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,760
'lt was Freak told me everything.

71
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,520
'See, I never had a brain

72
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,280
'till Freak came along
and let me borrow his for a while. '

73
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,720
(Gwen) Kevin,
your room's still a pile of boxes.

74
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,640
Do you want me to help you
unpack the books?

75
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,000
No, Mom, it's OK, I can do it myself.

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,760
You have my word
and my word is my bond.

77
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,760
- What do you have there?
- It's an ornithopter.

78
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,800
I'm taking advantage of what
looks like ideal flight conditions.

79
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,840
Say that again?

80
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,360
The ornithopter is defined
as an experimental device

81
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
propelled by flapping wings.

82
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,560
(Gwen) That's a big word
for a mechanical bird.

83
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,280
"Congratulations, Mrs Dillon,
it was a tough delivery

84
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,800
"but you've given birth to a healthy,
seven-pound dictionary.

85
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,840
"You must be very proud."

86
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,800
(Mumbling instructions)

87
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,480
(Kevin) The flapping cycle...

88
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Hey!

89
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,080
What's the matter?
Never seen a robot before?

90
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,840
All right. Let's pick it up, ladies.

91
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,440
Use the backboard.
Hey, you too, Kane!

92
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,840
Or do I have to translate
into Neanderthal for you?

93
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,080
Come on, line it up, boys.

94
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,840
(Coach) Line it up, line it up.

95
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,480
What, you got a piano
tied to your leg? Move it!

96
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,760
Hustle it, hustle it, ladies.

97
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,160
Hey, check out the March of Dimes.

98
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,080
Fellas, it's time
for Bowling For Midgets.

99
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,560
Our defending champion, Blade Fowler,
is bowling for the Corvette.

100
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
Yes!

101
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,400
(Coach) All right, hold it, hold it!

102
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,440
Who's responsible for this?

103
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,800
It was Kane, Mr Sacker, sir.

104
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, yes, most amusing.

105
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,040
Shall we all go out
and rile up a seeing-eye dog now?

106
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,880
Kane. You got yourself a detention
for the week.

107
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,720
Now help that boy up.

108
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,760
Kane, are you bucking for two weeks?

109
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,120
'Weekends generally meant two things.

110
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,440
'One was helping Grim
patch up the place.

111
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,800
'The other was LD reading class.

112
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,560
'That stands for learning disabled,

113
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,280
'which was a nice way of saying
reading for dummies...

114
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,000
'like me. '

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,760
Your tutor will be right along, Max.

116
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,520
I'm Kevin Dillon.
I'll be your student reading tutor.

117
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,920
"Hi, Kevin. My name is..."

118
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,920
- Max.
- It talks(!)

119
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,520
- You're a tutor?
- In between basketball seasons.

120
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,520
- Did you bring a book?
- I don't have no book.

121
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,720
Don't have a book.

122
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,160
How do you expect to read
without a book?

123
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,280
Read this.

124
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,480
Go on, read it.

125
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,920
First you have to open it.

126
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,160
"Chapter One." Now it's your turn.

127
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,400
(Slowly) "In the old days

128
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,320
"as it is... told

129
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,880
"there was a king in...

130
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,120
- "Brit... Brit..."
- Here.

131
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,080
Close your eyes.

132
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,360
"There was a king in Britain
named Uther Pendragon.

133
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,040
"He was a good king and mighty,

134
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,240
"and much of his strength he owed
to his chief counsellor Merlin,

135
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,200
"for Merlin was an enchanter

136
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,040
"who could read the stars and
hold discourse with the fairy world.

137
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,280
"Merlin knew the secrets of nature
and the hearts of men.

138
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,160
"To him the future
was as clear as the past."

139
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,880
See anything?

140
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,080
Every word is part of a picture.

141
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,600
Every sentence is a picture.

142
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,280
All you do is let your imagination
connect them together.

143
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,080
If you have an imagination, that is.

144
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,920
Read chapter one by tomorrow.

145
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,720
Wait, I can't.

146
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,240
Can't? No, no, you will.

147
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,480
If you want to make it
to the eighth grade, that is.

148
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,280
If not, you can always go
to one of those special schools

149
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,200
and sit around with a bunch of kids
who can't even say their own names.

150
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,720
Get the picture now?

151
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,800
It was Blade...

152
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,360
who threw the basketball at you,
not me.

153
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,200
You let those punks make a chump
out of you? What's the matter?

154
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,240
- I don't like to cause trouble.
- Oh, so you're a pacifist.

155
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,200
- A what?
- A pacifist.

156
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,000
Pass on the fists? Get it?

157
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,720
Right. It's not my best material.

158
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,640
(Max) 'I didn't read
the first chapter by tomorrow.

159
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,040
'Or the next day or the day
after that. But Freak was patient.

160
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,400
'He told me dinosaurs had brains
the size of walnuts

161

'and they ruled the earth
for 60 million years,

162

"and Arthur said, 'I drew the sword
from the ant hill."'

Anvil.

167
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,120
It's just a big stone.

168
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,840
- Anvil.
- Not bad.

169
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,920
You made it to chapter two...
this century.

170

Coming up next...
Sir Lancelot and the fair Guinevere.

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,400
Violence AND sex.

172
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,440
How'd you like to earn a gold crown?

173
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,560
- Run that by me again?
- A gold crown.

174
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,000
Roughly five bucks.

175
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,640
Taking into account inflation
since 900 AD.

176
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,880
Five bucks? For what?

177
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,600
For taking me to the fairgrounds
next Saturday to see the fireworks.

178
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,800
It's the Riverfest.
My mom doesn't like fireworks.

179
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,880
She doesn't like crowds. She never
lets me go anywhere by myself.

180
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,880
She thinks I'll get trampled
or something.

181
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,960
But if I go with someone
as big as you,

182
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,000
I think I could convince her.

183
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,200
Look, I don't know anybody else.
Do you want five bucks or not?

184
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,000
(# Jaunty carnival music)

185
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,840
You think it's easy for me?

186
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,960
Sometimes I think my mom would like
me to stay home in a wheelchair

187
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,320
with a tube down my throat.

188
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,080
She's always worrying.
I feel sorry for her.

189
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,120
I bet your mom doesn't have
to worry about you much.

190
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,480
My mom's in heaven.

191
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,080
- Want a corndog?
- I'll pass on the triple bypass.

192
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,560
(Train horn blows)

193
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,560
Well, well,
if it isn't Frankenstein and lgor.

194
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,720
Is the freak show
before or after the fireworks?

195
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,600
- (Max) Forget it.
- At least the dwarf can talk!

196
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,920
Why don't you cretins plug it up?

197
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,640
- You wanna say that again, freak?
- Which part?

198
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,320
Why don't we start with cretin?
C-R-E-T-l-N.

199
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,040
Look it up in the dictionary,
you'll find your mug shot, shrimp!

200
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,480
Hey, hey! You're not coming in,
now, back off!

201
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,200
(Kevin) What? What did I do?
(Max) Big mistake. Big mistake.

202
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,400
(Kevin) You can take 'em, right?

203
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,640
Are you kidding? You don't mess
with Blade and the Doghouse Boys.

204
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,760
You mean couldn't take 'em
and I was giving 'em lip?

205
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,760
(Max) That's about the size of it.
(Kevin) Oh, my God.

206
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,080
(Man on PA) 'Ladies and gentlemen,
please move forward if you can

207
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,320
'and please enjoy Cincinnati's
45th Riverfest fireworks. '

208
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,760
(Cheering)

209
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,560
Hey, down in front!

210
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,720
I said, down in front!

211
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,160
(Max) 'And that's how it started.

212
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,200
'He didn't ask me but I know
all he can see are feet and knees.

213
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,960
'And so I just sort of reached down
without thinking. '

214
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,960
Hey, what are you doing?

215
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,040
Wow!

216
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,960
Yeah! Whoa! All right!

217
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,360
(Max) 'I'd seen fireworks before

218
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,680
'but that night,
they looked like the most brightest,

219
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,280
'beautiful things in the whole world.

220
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,440
'Course, Freak had his own way
of putting it. '

221
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,600
Copper!

222
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,040
Sodium nitrate!

223
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,560
Magnesium!

224
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,520
(Cheering)

225
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Amazing perspective from up here.

226
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,760
It's just about as tall
as I'd like to be.

227
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,480
- Uh-oh. Cretins at ten o'clock.
- What?

228
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,200
Hey! Check it out, the freak!

229
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,040
Hang right. Damn.
Two more, two o'clock.

230
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,920
They've locked on to us.
Go left, left.

231
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,440
Steady, steady.

232
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,800
'That's how it started, all right.

233
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,120
'Only at first, it seemed like
that's how it might end.

234
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,440
'But a funny thing happened.

235
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,760
'I felt Freak's foot hit my side.

236
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,440
'And it was like, at that moment,
he became my brain.

237
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,520
'And I became his feet! '

238
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,240
Here you go, have a ball... Ah!

239
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,120
- Hurry up, they're gaining on us.
- Train's coming.

240
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,640
Don't worry, we can beat it!

241
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,600
(Horn)

242
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Damn!

243
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,520
No, it's all right. It's all right.
We'll get 'em.

244
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,440
- Go straight.
- Are you crazy?

245
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,200
(Max, panting)
This is all your fault!

246
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,480
If you hadn't opened your big mouth.

247
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,560
How can someone so small
can have a mouth so big?

248
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,040
How can someone so big
be such a wuss?

249
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,280
Look at you,
you're built like the Terminator.

250
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,320
(Kevin)
I'd trade places with you any day.

251
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,400
We got about five seconds
till we get messed up real good.

252
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,480
- Now it's time for the freak show.
- Yeah!

253
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,040
Straight. Trust me.

254
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,640
(Max) That's cold.

255
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,520
(Doghouse Boys laughing and chatting)

256
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
(Kevin) Keep going.

257
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,480
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah, yeah. All right, man.

258
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,760
(Boys shouting encouragement)

259
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,840
(Kevin) Just keep going.
Come on, come on!

260
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,120
(All shouting, indistinct)

261
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Let's try going faster.

262
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,400
Well, get going!

263
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,520
I can't. I'm stuck in the mud.

264
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,200
Well, then, kiss your butt goodbye.

265
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,000
(Shouting, indistinct)

266
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,560
(Max grunting)

267
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,640
- Max, Max, get up!
- I'm stuck!

268
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,240
The mud's too thick!

269
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,080
- Whoa.
- Is he all right?

270
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,000
- Can't get through the mud!
- Keep going!

271
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,120
Help me, you assholes!

272
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,160
(Sirens approaching)

273
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,520
(Policeman)
Hey, you kids, stay right there, now.

274
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,480
- Hey, hey!
- We didn't do nothing!

275
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Yes!

276
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,120
Oh, good Lord.

277
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,840
This is what I've been afraid of.
Just like his daddy.

278
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,560
Just hush up!

279
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,280
- Max!
- Mr and Mrs Penniman?

280
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,200
- I'm OK.
- Wait there, I'll be right back.

281
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,920
You have a brave young man here.

282
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,160
- Hi. Hello.
- Hello, hello.

283
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,240
Your grandson saved my boy's life.

284
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,400
Stay warm, Max. Good night.

285
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,000
- (Grim) What happened?
- Trouble at the fairgrounds.

286
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,640
Local punks. We got a lid on it.
Night, now.

287
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,000
- You all right?
- I'm OK.

288
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,240
- (Grim) Get him in here.
- Old people. You gotta reassure 'em.

289
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,200
- I'll get you some orange juice.
- No.

290
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,680
What this man needs
is a cup of coffee-real coffee.

291
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,720
Here you go.

292
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,640
(Grim) Um... (Clearing throat)

293
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,560
I just wanted to tell you, um...

294
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,320
what you done, um... was good.

295
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,640
Helping that crippled boy. Real good.

296
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,920
I'm proud of you.

297
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,320
Thank you, sir.

298
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
(Kevin) Rise and shine!

299
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,040
Come on, wake up!

300
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,240
Sleeping destroys brain cells.

301
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,680
Come on, there are fair maidens to
rescue and dragons to slay. Get up!

302
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,480
I'm not going anywhere,
you almost got me killed last night.

303
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,840
A knight of the realm
fears not death.

304
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,920
- So, they keep you in a dungeon.
- (Sighs)

305
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,240
Look, take it back.

306
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,400
I don't have no friends
and I don't need no friends.

307
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,200
Don't think of it as a friendship.

308
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,320
Think of it as a partnership.

309
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,560
You need a brain and I need legs.

310
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,120
And the Wizard of Oz
doesn't live in South Cincinnati.

311
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,600
# Walking this high road
are warriors from an olden time

312
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,120
# A curse on this land
and the days far behind us

313
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,800
# Dragons we've slain
and rescued many maidens fair

314
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,560
# And no man ever dared
break our stride

315
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,960
# Or the brotherhood that binds us

316
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,680
# When the broken are strong

317
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,120
# When the beaten are proud

318
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,600
# When the twisted can stand

319
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,240
# When the silenced can laugh

320
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,400
# When the hunted have turned

321
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,000
# When the tortured are sane

322
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,080
# When the blinded still stare

323
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,960
# When the poisoned remain

324
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,360
# When the voiceless can sing

325
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,680
# And the shackled can run

326
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,560
# And the downtrodden man
holds his face to the sun

327
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,920
# We'll be walking high
above the world

328
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,200
# Our legend will say... #

329
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,960
- Morning, Mr Hampton.
- Good morning, Max.

330
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,880
(Man) Where is it?
It was there this morning!

331
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,000
Where is it? Is it in this bag?

332
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,040
- It is, isn't it?
- Stop it!

333
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,360
- (Woman) You're hurting me!
- Hey! Take it outside!

334
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,320
(Man) You think it hurts now?

335
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,680
A knight proves his worthiness
by his deeds.

336
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,160
So where is it? Where is it?

337
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,000
You think it hurts now?
You think it hurts now? Do you?

338
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,080
Do you?! Well, come on!

339
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,880
Unhand her, knave.

340
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,680
You say somethin'?

341
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,760
- I said...
- Get your filthy hands off of her!

342
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,680
(Radio playing quietly)

343
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,960
Thank you.

344
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,600
(Door closes)

345
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,920
It's on the house.

346
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,960
Did you guys have lunch today?

347
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,600
Indeed. In the kingdom of Baby Ruth.

348
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,640
Yeah, as I suspected.

349
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,400
You wanna take some of that
home with you?

350
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,720
Methinks his name is Sir Eats-A-Lot.

351
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,800
Sorry, it's just
Gram never cooks like this.

352
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,600
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

353
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,760
Yes, ma'am.

354
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,920
You slow down, Kevin.

355
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,760
You heard me.
Come on, drink some water.

356
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,800
I'm OK.

357
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,800
What does fair Guinevere
have for dessert?

358
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,080
Chocolate pudding,
if Merlin will do the dishes.

359
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,560
- Dishes?
- Dishes.

360
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,880
But knights don't do dishes.

361
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,720
In this castle they do.

362
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,120
Sorry, it was packed.

363
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,040
- Popular Science!
- You're a popular guy.

364
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,240
(Boys whooping and shouting)

365
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,600
Lock your door.

366
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,520
(Siren)

367
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,840
(Tyres squealing)

368
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,080
(Quietly) Max.

369
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,320
(Coughing) Max, Max.

370
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,320
(Coughing) Wake up.

371
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,880
- WAKE UP!
- (Dog barks outside)

372
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,920
(Sighs) What time is it?

373
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,160
A band of highwaymen
ambushed the Queen of Saxony.

374
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,920
They stole her chest -
no pun intended -

375
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,280
but I know where they hid it.

376
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,720
Here, put this on.

377
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,160
(Rats squeaking)

378
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,480
It's the treasure, cleverly concealed
in the slime of dragons.

379
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,800
It's a woman's purse
and it's covered with crap.

380
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,280
And it's our duty as knights
to return it to its rightful owner.

381
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,600
How are we gonna do that?

382
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,680
Voila! A rope.

383
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,240
Dude, you have lost it.

384
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,080
Funny, that's the same thing
they told Sir Isaac Newton.

385
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,680
Here, tie the end of that
to the grate.

386
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,200
- Who the heck is Isaac Newton?
- Just some British nerd who said...

387
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,720
"If a fire escape
exerts a force on a sewer grate...

388
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,480
"a sewer grate exerts an equal
and opposite force on a fire escape."

389
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,000
Now, all you have to do is descend...

390
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,640
and retrieve the treasure.

391
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,080
Me? How come I always end up
knee-deep in crap?

392
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,880
Just think of it as
a close encounter of the turd kind.

393
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
I'll hold the torch.

394
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,400
I really don't like rats.

395
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,080
Well, somewhere down there a rat
is saying, "I really don't like Max."

396
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,560
(Rats squeaking)

397
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,720
(Metallic clattering)

398
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Hey!

399
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,560
Sorry, I thought I heard someone.

400
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,840
(Gasps)

401
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,200
Not bad for the Queen of Saxony.

402
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,000
(Kevin whistles)

403
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,040
Hey, you know?
I thought Halloween was next week.

404
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,440
(All laughing)

405
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,560
There's no millpond between
you and me now, is there, big guy?

406
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,880
So tell the little freak man
to give up the purse.

407
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,920
Just give it to him.

408
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,000
- No.
- (Boys murmuring)

409
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,320
What's the problem?

410
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,400
Give it to him! This isn't a game,
just give him the purse!

411
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,880
A knight fights for what is right.

412
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,680
This is no time for that knight crap,
just give him the purse!

413
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,080
Hey, punk?

414
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,830
No!

415
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,560
- What?
- En garde!

416
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,600
(Screaming)

417
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,520
- OK, Maxy boy, put it down.
- Don't throw that.

418
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,120
(Screaming)

419
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,560
- That was awesome.
- Let's get out of here.

420
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,720
No, that was more than awesome,
it was mythical!

421
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,760
It was simply perfection!

422
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,000
(Max) We look like a couple of freaks
in these butt-stupid clothes.

423
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,720
(Kevin) That's what we are,
a couple of freaks.

424
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,720
Loretta Lee.
240 Crescent Heights, apartment 103.

425
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,880
(Kevin) This is the place, all right.
(Max) Yeah?

426
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,280
Well, it looks like the Queen
of Saxony just fired her decorator.

427
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,640
She ain't home.

428
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,720
When you're on a quest,
you see it through to the end.

429
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,360
- If she ain't home, she ain't home.
- (Latch clicks)

430
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,520
Loretta Lee?

431
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,770
Iggy?

432
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,480
Is the circus in town?

433
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,560
I believe this is yours.
Have a nice day.

434
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,000
- Just wait here.
- Wait a minute!

435
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,120
(Southern drawl) Jesus Christ,
you scared me half to death.

436
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,760
Wait a minute. I know you.

437
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,680
- No. We were just leaving.
- Sure as hell I know you.

438
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,120
Iggy! Come see who's here!

439
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,240
Hang on.
What's your hurry, little fella?

440
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,120
- You're drunk, lady.
- What the hell are you hollering...

441
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,880
Ain't he the spittin' image?

442
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,880
- What are they doin' here?
- They just came to return my purse.

443
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,680
Ain't nothing missing. If that ain't
gentlemanly, I don't know what is.

444
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,600
(lggy) Name.

445
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,960
Name!

446
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,200
That won't be necessary,
we were just leaving.

447
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,320
- Max Kane.
- Kenny Kane's boy.

448
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,480
- What did I tell you?
- Shut up, Loretta.

449
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,000
Kenny Kane's boy, all growed up.

450
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,920
- My, oh, my, how time flies.
- (lggy) Get away from him.

451
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,360
I knew you as just a young thing.
You got your picture in the paper!

452
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,720
- You're drunk!
- Yes, I believe I am.

453
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,280
(Mutters)
Oh, you're crazy as a polecat!

454
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,040
Iggy and your daddy did some time
together up in Langford.

455
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,400
They go way back,
isn't that right, lggy?

456
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,080
- We got, we gotta...
- I got a good idea.

457
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,440
I think y'all deserve a reward.

458
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,520
Poor thing.

459
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,760
You couldn't speak, could you?

460
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,040
What'd the papers call you?

461
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,760
"Mute boy", that's what it was.

462
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,840
Poor little mute boy, all alone
up there on the witness stand.

463
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,560
(Max screams)

464
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,600
Wait! Max!

465
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,880
- Hey, Max!
- Stay away! Just stay away from me!

466
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,920
- Wait, dammit!
- I said stay away!

467
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,320
Nothin' but trouble's
what you've been.

468
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,280
We almost had a hundred bucks there.

469
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,520
My life was fine
before you and your stupid quests.

470
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,160
Bunch of bull.

471
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,720
My father was a magician.

472
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,280
At least that's what my mom says.

473
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,160
He heard the words "birth defect"
and he disappeared.

474
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,840
But I don't really care, you know.

475
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,600
Cos I don't even know
who my father is.

476
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,960
I just know that's not who I am.

477
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,520
And that's not who you are, either.

478
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,120
A knight proves his worthiness
through his deeds.

479
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,160
This is the most beautiful place
I've ever been.

480
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,760
If you think hard enough,
you can put yourself in their armour.

481
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,600
Lancelot the Brave.

482
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,840
Tristan the Strong.

483
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,160
Galahad the Purehearted.

484
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,040
With this Excaliber,

485
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,520
in the name of God,

486
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,440
St Michael and St George...

487
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,560
I hereby knight us... Freak...

488
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,400
Freak?

489
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,600
Freak...

490
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,680
the Mighty.

491
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,480
(Max) 'From that day, Freak never
asked me nothin' about my father.

492
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,480
'And I never asked him nothin'
about his.

493
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,880
'Cos that's not who we were. '

494
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,880
- Hey, look!
- It's alive, it's alive!

495
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,840
- (Sacker) Alton.
- Sir!

496
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,160
- Fowler!
- Yeah.

497
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,400
- Elwood.
- Sir.

498
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,640
- Kane.
- Sir.

499
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,480
Dillon?

500
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,040
- Sir.
- (Laughter)

501
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,320
Miss Dillon.

502
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,360
School district policy

503
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,560
prohibits any child with a serious
physical or medical handicap

504
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,120
from participating in
school athletic activities.

505
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,640
- Mrs Addison...
- It's a liability matter.

506
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,000
Now, I'm sure you understand that.

507
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,760
You see, my son Kevin...

508
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,040
He's been made fun of
and called names his whole life.

509
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,400
If you've been made fun of your whole
life, you find another place to live.

510
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,000
And he's found that place, up here.

511
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:33,480
Kevin lives in this world
of books and words and ideas...

512
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,880
and things I don't even understand.

513
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,400
But I understand this.

514
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,800
Kevin would trade it all
for a chance to be normal,

515
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,120
to have a friend, to do the things
that normal kids do every day.

516
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,600
Max Kane has given him that chance.

517
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,040
Well, I'm not gonna let that
be taken away from my boy.

518
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,080
Oh, if you want to kill yourself
in gym class, Kevin Dillon,

519
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,760
don't expect me to cry for you.

520
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,880
(Both) Yes!

521
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,320
(All shouting)

522
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,840
Come on, come on,
that's it, that's it!

523
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,280
(Boy) Freak! Freak! Freak!

524
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,760
(Spectators chanting)
Freak! Freak!

525
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,200
Freak! Freak! Freak! Freak! Freak!

526
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,080
Freak the Mighty!
Freak the Mighty! Freak the Mighty!

527
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,120
(Cheering)

528
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,800
We shall yield not to you...

529
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,320
or any man.

530
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,280
(Knocking)

531
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,920
Miss Addison, you wanted to see me?

532
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,040
Come in, Max.

533
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,040
Sit down.

534
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,720
Is something wrong, ma'am?
Did Gram call or...?

535
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,400
No, Max, your grandparents are fine.

536
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,760
We've been notified
by the parole board.

537
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,160
Your father's been granted a parole.

538
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,960
- No. No!
- Max...

539
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,040
- No!
- Listen to me, Max.

540
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,280
Listen to me!
He can't come near you, all right?

541
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,760
I want to make that
very clear to you.

542
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,880
No! No!

543
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,920
- Shhh.
- No! I don't want to hear it! No!

544
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,280
Elton. You get that gun
out of this house.

545
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,000
Don't start with me, Susan.

546
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,120
He serves nine years out of 30

547
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,040
and they let him go,
just as free as you and me.

548
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,760
That's justice
and not a damn for the victim.

549
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,880
You heard the lawyer same as me.

550
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,400
If he comes within five miles of Max
or us or the house

551
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,920
they'll put him right back in jail.

552
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,960
You believe the damn lawyers?

553
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,600
It's because of the lawyers
that he's out walking around.

554
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,440
That's what's wrong
with this country!

555
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,920
They'll make you believe any
damn thing as long as they get paid.

556
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,000
Tell you what I believe. If Kenny
Kane comes anywhere near my grandson

557
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,520
or you or my home, he's gonna get
a taste some real justice.

558
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,400
No, you can't.
You're not gonna have it here.

559
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,720
- Don't tell me what to do, woman!
- I'm telling you!

560
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,360
Our Annie's gone.

561
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,640
All we have left of her smile...

562
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,880
all we have left of her heart
is in that boy down there.

563
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,400
I'm not gonna have hatred comin' into
this house and poisoning him.

564
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,680
(Mumbling) I don't know.
I don't know.

565
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,840
- How can you eat that slop, Dillon?
- I'm hungry.

566
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,520
You're eating too fast.

567
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,960
Excuse me, Mom?

568
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,320
I said you're eating too fast!

569
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,000
What's eating you?

570
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,680
Where does the fair Maid Marion
get her perm?

571
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,840
(Laughter)

572
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,640
- (Laughter continues)
- Excuse me...

573
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,440
Hey.

574
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,440
(As Godfather)
You call dis spaghetti?

575
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,480
What have I done
to deserve your disrespect?

576
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:27,800
I see you are new to our family.
I don't like you. I like you.

577
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,600
(Coughing)

578
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,240
(Kevin coughing and choking)

579
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,200
Help!

580
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,040
Help! Help! Somebody help me! Help!

581
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,560
(Heart monitor beeping)

582
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,640
(Woman) Mrs Dillon?

583
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,680
We need to speak.

584
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,240
(lnaudible)

585
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,800
(Whispers) Spock.

586
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,960
Spock, that's him.

587
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,280
(Max) "'We will be brothers,"
said King Arthur...

588
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,720
"'and we will fight
for all those who ask for help."'

589
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,760
Mrs Dillon. Please sit.

590
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,280
Kevin is, uh, is out of danger.

591
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,480
I'm sure you understand
the degenerative nature

592
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,520
of Morquio's Syndrome.

593
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,920
- I'm sure I do.
- There was an airway blockage.

594
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,560
Kevin stopped breathing long enough
for unoxygenated blood to circulate,

595
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,080
weakening some of the nerve tissue.

596
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,320
Why don't you just tell me
when I can take him home?

597
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,040
Right.

598
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,000
Uh, Mrs Dillon...

599
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,920
From my examination of Kevin,
I think I can say...

600
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,960
I can say that, uh...

601
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,800
That's a nice hammer.
Can you maybe go hammer over there?

602
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,240
Go hammer over there, OK?

603
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,960
I think I can say that his, uh...

604
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,000
his bone growth has ceased

605
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,280
while his internal organs
are continuing their natural growth.

606
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,480
I... am not a counsellor, Mrs Dillon,
this is very hard for me to say.

607
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:57,040
But I recommend you start thinking
about making some... preparations.

608
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,600
Why don't you tell me how long?

609
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:05,240
I'm not an expert on Kevin's disease
but I would say...

610
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,120
maybe a year?

611
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,160
(Woman on PA, indistinct)

612
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,160
- Want something?
- No thank you, ma'am.

613
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,280
Stop ma'aming me,
it makes me nervous.

614
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,440
Yes, ma'am.

615
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,400
I'm just gonna have a...
hot chocolate

616
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,040
with extra whipped cream.

617
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,400
I said whipped cream... (Sobbing)

618
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,720
He's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be all right!

619
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,200
- He's gonna be all right.
- It's my fault, my fault!

620
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,480
He was just eating too fast.

621
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,400
He's gonna be just fine, you'll see.

622
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,360
But I'll tell you something.

623
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,400
The next time he tries
to eat chop suey that fast,

624
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,640
I'm gonna dump it on his head.

625
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,160
You do that, Max.

626
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,360
Oh, God.

627
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,550
OK.

628
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,120
(Exhaling) OK.

629
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:15,990
OK.

630
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:23,560
(Max) 'The deal was, Freak had to
stay in the hospital for two weeks.

631
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,200
'lt was the longest two weeks
of my life. '

632
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,360
Even Mr Sacker signed it.

633
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,880
I didn't know he could write.

634
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,120
'Freak was told it might be a while
before he could go back to school.

635
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,640
'Also, we had to cut back on quests.
Doctor's orders.

636
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,320
'But once in a while, we'd sneak out.

637
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,400
'He'd have good days and bad days

638
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,720
'and on the bad days
I just never put him down. '

639
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,600
(Kevin) Here it is.
(Max) Here's what?

640
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,160
- See the wing of that building?
- Yeah.

641
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,480
(Kevin) Swear that what you're
about to hear you will tell no one.

642
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,560
A sacred oath
upon your good name and honour.

643
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,400
- L, Max Kane...
- Here do swear...

644
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,080
...here do swear
that I will tell no one.

645
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,400
Inside there is a laboratory

646
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,280
called the Experimental Biogenetic
Intervention Unit.

647
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,840
At some near future date,
as yet undetermined,

648
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,600
but likely within the next year,
I will enter that lab.

649
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:38,240
King Arthur wanted to improve his men
so he made them armour-plated.

650
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,280
Today we have biogenetics,

651
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,240
the science of designing
replacement parts for the human body.

652
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,960
You mean you're getting new legs?

653
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,000
- No, I mean a whole new body.
- A new body?

654
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,640
Yeah. Go closer.

655
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,920
I never told you this,
had to keep it a secret,

656
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,880
but every few months
I've gone for tests.

657
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,920
They've measured me, analysed blood,
metabolic rates.

658
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,440
I've been X-rayed,
CAT-scanned and sonogrammed.

659
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,080
They're fitting me for a transplant.

660
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,200
I'm going to be the first
biogenetically-improved human.

661
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,240
Sounds like it's gonna hurt.

662
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,600
Maybe, but so what?

663
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,840
You can think your way
out of anything, even pain.

664
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:28,320
- Sounds too dangerous.
- Hey, life is dangerous.

665
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,080
Max? You OK?

666
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,560
- I'm just like him.
- Just like him?

667
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,720
Oh, Lord.

668
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,240
I thought I'd gotten rid
of every last picture.

669
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,840
I look in the mirror and I see him.

670
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,000
I hear my voice and I hear his!

671
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,640
It's no use, you are who you are.

672
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,240
And nothing else.

673
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,160
Killer Kane, Killer Kane,
had a son who's got no brain!

674
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,520
Listen to me. You are nothing
like him, you will never be like him.

675
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,640
You know why?

676
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,240
Because you have your mother's heart.

677
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,960
You're my noble knight.
That's what you are.

678
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,600
(Window frame rattling)

679
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,280
(Gasps)

680
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,400
(Grunting)

681
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,200
Not a word, boy. Not a sound.

682
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,240
I came back, like I said.

683
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,720
Shh, shh, shh.

684
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,600
(Engine starting)

685
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,320
Everything changes now, son.

686
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,200
(Max) 'Once on TV,
this dude hypnotized a lobster.

687
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,240
'Maybe you saw it.

688
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,800
'He touches a lobster and it freezes,
it can't move.

689
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,440
'That's sort of what happened to me.

690
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,320
'Like I'm paralysed
and my head is empty.

691
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,640
'And nothing matters.

692
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:15,800
'Not Gram and Grim, or Freak,
or the stars in the sky.

693
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,200
'They're all just make-believe,

694
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,720
'this dream I was having
for a long time.

695
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:26,520
'And now I'm awake again...
and he's there.

696
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,360
'And for some reason,
I'm thinking this weird thought.

697
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,080
'He doesn't need a suit of armour. '

698
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,640
Well, let me look at you.

699
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,080
It's like looking at
an old picture of myself.

700
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:54,320
Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve.

701
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,640
All them letters I sent you,

702
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:03,160
all them birthday presents
and Christmas presents,

703
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,200
I bet you never got a one of 'em,
did you?

704
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,760
Oh, they poisoned your mind
against me, I know that.

705
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,760
Get down.

706
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,920
Yes, sir, you and me, we're gonna
have the time of our lives, boy!

707
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,200
Is something going on?

708
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,560
Good evening, Mrs Penniman.

709
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,080
We're here to inform you
that Kenneth Kane

710
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,640
did not report to his parole officer
yesterday in Cleveland.

711
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:47,040
- You wait here.
- He's been missing 24 hours,

712
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,440
- He's in violation of his parole.
- No.

713
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,480
No, that can't happen, no.

714
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,560
We don't want to alarm you, ma'am,
but just as a precaution...

715
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,600
He's gone.

716
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,510
Ow!

717
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,000
Voila. Size 14.

718
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,440
Of course. The Queen of Saxony.

719
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,800
(lmitating Loretta)
"lggy and your daddy...

720
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:30,520
"did some time together
up there in Langford.

721
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,560
"They go way back."

722
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:46,840
(Kenny) An old buddy of mine lives
up here, he's gonna take care of us.

723
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,080
Owes me a favour.

724
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,600
It ain't much.

725
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,960
Old bat that lived here went to visit
her sister for the holidays.

726
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,560
(Tyres squeal)

727
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,160
Lousy spark plugs!

728
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,240
You wouldn't light out on me,
would you, boy?

729
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,880
- No, sir.
- No. That's good.

730
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,720
Cos we got to talk, man to man.

731
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:36,200
See, this is only a temporary thing,
just for one night.

732
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,160
Tomorrow we're gonna get on the road,
just you and me,

733
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,200
the way it oughtta be.

734
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:57,720
There's... something
you need to know about your daddy.

735
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,880
I never killed nobody.

736
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,200
I loved your mother.

737
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,680
I never harmed her.
Not one golden curl on her head.

738
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,280
I swear.

739
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,000
You understand what I'm telling you?

740
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,840
Yes, sir.

741
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,440
Right, then.

742
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,960
We don't need to discuss it no more.

743
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,040
- Whoa!
- (Tyres squealing)

744
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,600
Oh, my God.

745
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,110
No!

746
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,600
Kevin?

747
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,480
(Exhales)

748
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,160
Oh!

749
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,000
Oh, boy.

750
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,640
Steady!

751
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,120
Get out! Get out of the way! Move!

752
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,040
(Screaming)

753
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,880
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

754
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,320
(Scream echoes)

755
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,360
(Grunts)

756
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,440
(Horses whinnying)

757
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,080
(Knocking)

758
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,440
(Sighs)

759
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,360
The only person I want
comin' through this door is lggy.

760
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:37,520
Merry Christmas. I just thought I'd
make you boys a nice Christmas meal.

761
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,600
Oh, my. He's gonna have a hard time
eating like that.

762
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,800
(Loretta) I can feed him if you like.

763
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,920
Just set that tray down right there
and get yourself out of here.

764
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,920
Leftover pizza. That's nice, Loretta.

765
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,360
You haven't changed a bit.

766
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,560
My, it's cold in here.

767
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,240
Brr!

768
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,000
(Loretta) It's cold as a witch's tit.

769
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,040
Oh, come on, Kenny.
Can't you be nice?

770
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,280
(Loretta) We had some good times
in the old days.

771
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,000
The old days are over.
You and I got nothing to discuss.

772
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,520
Thank you for the pizza, Loretta!

773
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,280
Thank you, Loretta.
Now, come on, let's go.

774
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:41,160
Did you... Did you tell your daddy
about the time you returned my purse?

775
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,000
- (Kenny) What are you talking about?
- I guess lggy forgot to mention it.

776
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,320
He came by with this crippled kid

777
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:54,560
and they returned my purse
with $400 still in it.

778
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,320
Hey. What crippled kid?

779
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,640
Well, I told lggy. I said, "lggy,
you better tell Kenny about this."

780
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,320
- Who is he?
- Just a crippled kid.

781
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,360
Just... just a crippled kid?
A friend of yours?

782
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,960
I said, a friend of yours?

783
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,160
Yes, he's a friend of mine.

784
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,280
Young maiden, a favour I beg.

785
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,800
Call the police
and tell them to come here.

786
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,840
(Kenny) Friends talk,
don't you understand that?

787
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:14,520
They're gonna look everywhere,
talk to everybody

788
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,640
and this crippled kid
will remember this place!

789
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:21,360
- Why didn't you say you'd been here?
- You didn't ask me, sir.

790
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,760
I didn't ask you?
What, are you some kind of moron?

791
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,080
Yeah. (Chuckles) Uh-huh.

792
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,880
(Kenny) You brought those here
to give to him.

793
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:45,280
Tryin' to poison my son's mind
against me, aren't you?

794
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,400
Now, Kenny.

795
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,480
I told you to keep your hands
off my boy

796
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:57,000
- But you brought your filth in here!
- You're the only filth in here.

797
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,080
(Loretta) Get your paws off of me!
I said...

798
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,960
- (Loretta choking)
- Let go!

799
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,280
- (Kenny) You'll see His wrath now!
- Let go of her!

800
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,320
- Look away, son.
- Let go!

801
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,520
Let go, she can't breathe!

802
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,320
She can't breathe! She can't breathe!

803
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,560
- Shh.
- She can't breathe!

804
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,400
- (Loretta choking)
- She can't breathe!

805
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,640
(Screaming)

806
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,560
(Roaring)

807
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,560
(Loretta coughing)

808
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,920
You were wearing a black t-shirt
with no sleeves.

809
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,880
You... you carried me back to my room!

810
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,760
You put me to bed, you told me
to shh, that I was dreaming!

811
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,280
Is that any way
to talk to your daddy?

812
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:45,480
But I wasn't dreaming.
I remember, I saw you!

813
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,920
I saw you kill my mom!

814
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,840
- You'll wish you hadn't said that.
- I said it!

815
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,120
And you're never gonna stop me
from saying it again!

816
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,760
Because I've wanted to say it
for a long time!

817
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,440
Looks like we got a situation here,
huh? Huh?

818
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,680
I've come for my brother in arms!

819
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:21,120
A knight proves his worthiness
by his deeds.

820
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,680
You're the crippled kid.

821
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,880
This is your partner in crime,
this little freak?

822
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,080
What are you, soft in the head, boy?

823
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,720
- Guess what I got for Christmas?
- Well, I don't know.

824
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,720
This squirt gun and a chemistry set.
Good old reliable H2S04.

825
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,320
Sulphuric acid. Oily, colourless

826
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,400
and able to strip the paint off a car
in two seconds.

827
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,560
So ask yourself,
"Am I feeling lucky today?"

828
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,360
Bullshit.

829
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,840
(Screaming in pain)

830
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:58,520
In the five-tenths of a second it
would take to move in any direction

831
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:01,840
your crotch
will look like a nuclear accident.

832
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,920
(Panting)

833
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,880
You little...

834
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,200
(Max grunting)

835
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,360
(Max screaming)

836
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,080
Hold it!

837
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:41,080
What did you have in there, anyway?

838
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,560
Just soap, vinegar and chilli pepper.

839
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,840
Worked like a charm, didn't it?
Oh, hey, did you lose this?

840
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,560
Come on.

841
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:18,080
- We shall yield not to you...
- Or any man!

842
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,200

01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,520
# O'er the fields we go

853
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,720
# Laughing all the way

854
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,280
# Bells on bobtail ring
# Ha ha ha

855
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,120
# Making spirits bright

856
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:11,240
# What fun it is to ride and sing
a sleighing song tonight

857
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:16,240
# Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way

858
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:20,680
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh, oh!

859
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:25,680
# Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way... #

860
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,120
All we had for Christmas
was an apple core

861
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,160
and lump of coal in our stocking.

862
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:34,120
- If we were lucky.
- Oh! You never had a lump of coal.

863
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:38,320
You're right. They were so poor
they couldn't even afford coal.

864
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:42,280
All they got was a piece of paper
with "coal" written on it.

865
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,440
(Kevin) If they were lucky.

866
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:13,240
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, Merry Christmas!

867
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,680
(Grim) Best meal I've ever had!

868
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:32,440
The sky's like a photograph
from a billion years ago.

869
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:37,120
Just some old movie
they're showing up there.

870
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:43,400
Lots of those stars
have switched off by now.

871
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,120
We're just seeing the rerun.

872
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,720
I almost forgot.

873
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,600
This is for you.

874
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,640
You don't have to say anything,

875
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,840
I know you're overcome
with gratitude.

876
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,560
What kind of book is this?
It doesn't say nothin'.

877
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,240
Close your eyes.

878
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,040
Every word is part of a picture.

879
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:39,200
Every sentence is a picture.

880
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:46,920
All you do is let your imagination
connect them together.

881
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,600
If you have an imagination, that is.

882
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,760
(Quietly) Max.

883
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,440
He went in his sleep.

884
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,280
That wasn't supposed to happen.

885
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,160
You were supposed
to give him a new body!

886
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:36,880
Stop, you idiots! He was supposed
to get a new biogenic body!

887
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,880
(Sobbing)
No! He was tested, measured!

888
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,160
- He told me he'd be the first...
- I know. I know.

889
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:48,800
Listen to me. Kevin knew
he wasn't gonna live very long.

890
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,440
He knew it was
just a matter of time. You see...

891
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:57,680
What happened was his heart
just got too big for his body.

892
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,200
It's OK. It's OK.

893
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:12,120
Go home. Just go home.

894
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,480
Go home.

895
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,400
Can I help you, son?

896
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:13,040
(Max) 'There's a place I go
in my head sometimes.

897
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:17,480
'lt's cool and dim in there
and you float like a cloud.

898
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,440
'Now you are a cloud,

899
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:27,440
'the kind you see in the sky
on a windy day.

900
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:30,440
'You don't have
to think about anything.

901
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,480
'You're nothing, you're nobody.

902
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,800
'I stayed in the down under
for days and days

903
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:46,040
'and kept the door closed.

904
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:50,680
'Which is why I missed the funeral
and Kevin's mom moving away.

905
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:58,080
'Grim threatened to unscrew my door
but he never did.

906
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:03,080
'He just kept saying
I should come out for Gram's sake.

907
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:07,880
'Sometimes she'd come down and say
I should come out for Grim's sake. '

908
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,280
It comes off in a couple of weeks.

909
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,480
What you been doin' these days?

910
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,960
Nothin'.

911
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,600
Nothin's a drag, kid.

912
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,520
Think about it.

913
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,000
'So I thought about it.

914
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:41,960
'Matter of fact,
I started thinking real hard. '

915
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,920
Can anyone tell me

916
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:47,800
why Miss Havisham wanted Pip
to fall in love with Estella?

917
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,920
(Teacher) Lisa, you've had your turn.

918
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:54,760
Max?

919
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,400
Well...

920
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,480
I think it's because...

921
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,680
she wanted Estella...

922
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,600
to break Pip's heart,

923
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,920
just like her heart
had been broken long ago.

924
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,520
Thank you, Max.

925
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,720
(Max) 'And then...

926
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:46,000
'I started connecting all these
things I was thinking about.

927
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,400
'And I had a crazy thought.

928
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,880
'Since Freak showed me
I could read a book,

929
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,320
'maybe I could write one, too.

930
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,800
'Then I thought to myself,

931
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,640
"'Who are you kidding, Max Kane?
You got no brain."

932
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,520
'So I wrote that down.

933
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,360
'And then kept on going...

934
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:51,280
'... until it was spring again
and I reached my last page.

01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,280
'Now, only this dumb writer

936
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,760
'could get writer's block
on his last page.

01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:02,320
'You see,
I just didn't know how to end it. '

938

01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,640
'... that when someone so great
once was...
