1
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:24,742
Evildoers of our kingdom...

2
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:28,083
we're always the losers,
the bad guys.

3
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:30,554
Is that fair? No.

4
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:32,683
Starting tonight...

5
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,753
I giveyou happily n'ever after!

6
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,190
Holdit, hold it, hold it!

7
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:46,032
Would the owner ofa light blue coach with
"Narnia"plates please moveyour vehicle?

8
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:49,075
You're parked in a "Trolls Only" zone.
Thank you.

9
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:52,202
While I have your attention,
you see that there?

10
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:55,510
That's what we call a "wicked stepmother"
Feel free to boo.

11
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:58,915
I know what you're thinking.
Who put a wicked stepmother in charge?

12
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:01,510
Were there free elections?
Any chance of a recount?

13
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:04,349
You know what?
Let's go back a little...

14
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:07,188
and I'll give you
the lowdown on Fairytale Land.

15
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:10,028
Yeah, the name's kind of corny...

16
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:12,564
but we had to call it something,
and "Canada" was already taken.

17
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:17,262
So, anyway, in this tower
high above the prince's palace...

18
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:21,296
is what you might call the Department
of Fairytale Land Security.

19
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:24,434
This is where all the stories -
you know the ones -

20
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:26,001
Rapunzel...

21
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,079
Sleeping Beauty...

22
00:04:28,748 --> 00:04:30,613
the Frog Prince -

23
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:32,675
are watched over by a wizard.

24
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:36,415
And his job is to make sure
every fairy tale goes by the book...

25
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,582
right up to their happy endings.

26
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:41,786
And that's why he has these:

27
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:44,227
the scales of good and evil.

28
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:47,061
See that? They have
a little pointer and everything.

29
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:50,569
As long he keeps those things
in balance, the stories never change...

30
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:54,129
and the endings
stay happy, happy, happy.

31
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,666
The wizard also has two assistants:
Munk and Mambo.

32
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:01,009
Munk's the guy who sees
the glass as half empty.

33
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:05,151
Mambo's the guy who...
probably peed in the glass.

34
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,583
You know what I'm talking about -
a world-class troublemaker.

35
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:18,729
Yeah. These are the guys you want to
trust your happy ending to.

36
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:27,096
Here's our story.

37
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:29,437
Remember her?
She was the one with the whole...

38
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:33,104
"Evil, evil, blah, blah, blah"
speech a minute ago.

39
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:36,774
Anyway, let me fillyou in
on everyone in this particular tale.

40
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,444
We've got one wicked stepmother...

41
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,453
and two ugly stepsisters.

42
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,955
Delicate flowers of womanhood.

43
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:45,958
One fairy godmother.

44
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,954
I think she's a couple Hansels short
of a Gretel. You know what I'm sayin'?

45
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:52,988
One Prince Charming.

46
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:56,659
Hold the charm.

47
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,796
And then there's one fair maiden.

48
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:03,539
Ella.

49
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,544
You probably know her
as Cinderella...

50
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:08,012
but she's always been Ella to me.

51
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:11,346
She's in love with
that prince you just saw.

52
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:14,910
What does Ella see in Prince
Potato Head? I have no idea.

53
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:17,354
But just look at her.

54
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:19,358
She's so beautiful.

55
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:22,953
A girl like that could never
fall for an ordinary guy like -

56
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:26,832
So, you might be wondering
by now who I am.

57
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,834
Have a look.

58
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:32,001
No, not Blondie McBiceps.

59
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:34,302
No. Look to the left.

60
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:36,308
Keep going.

61
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:39,072
There I am. You know
the Cinderella story, right?

62
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:41,079
Remember Rick the servant?

63
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:44,913
Of course you don't. I'm the guy
who polishes the prince's boots.

64
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:47,646
I'm the guy who washes
his dishes and serves his meals...

65
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:51,248
and does his laundry
and flosses his teeth.

66
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,219
You know what kind of happy
ending the royal flosser gets?

67
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:57,089
Right.

68
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:58,596
None.

69
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:01,896
So, that's everyone important -
and me.

70
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,902
Okay, let's see the title now.

71
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,643
Happier music, please.

72
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:46,577
So here we are,
the day ofthe prince's ball.

73
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:49,581
I managed to swipe some mail
from the royal messenger's bag...

74
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:51,810
so I'd have an excuse to visit Ella.

75
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:55,813
Hello? Oh, Rick, it's you.

76
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,585
I'm sorry to be
such a disappointment.

77
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:01,092
No, no. I was expecting
the royal messenger.

78
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:02,992
With these?

79
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,290
They're here!

80
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:07,094
Did you see him today?
What was he wearing?

81
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,364
One for my stepmother,
two for my stepsisters...

82
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:12,597
and none for me.

83
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,038
Wait. What's that?

84
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:17,804
You've got somethin'... here.

85
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:21,438
I'm invited too!.
Just like I've dreamed about.

86
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:26,178
The royal ball.
And he'll be there in his royal shirt -

87
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:29,483
And his royal boots -
which Rick spent two hours polishing.

88
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:31,956
And it was a royal pain in the butt.

89
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:33,959
I may even
get to dance with him tonight.

90
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:36,495
Gosh! Wouldn't that be super?

91
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:37,894
He's dreamy.

92
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:39,124
The prince!

93
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,996
- The invitations! They're here!
- Move it!

94
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,466
Give it! It's mine!

95
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:45,800
Out of my way!

96
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:48,397
- Mom totally hates you.
- She hates you more.

97
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:49,634
Nuh-uh. You.

98
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,870
You totally ripped my coiffure.

99
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:53,879
Knock it off!

100
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:58,316
Great. Here comes the dragon lady.

101
00:08:58,384 --> 00:08:59,783
- You started it.
- Did not!

102
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:00,945
- Did too!
- You so did.

103
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,214
Shut up. She's coming.

104
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:05,223
It takes hours
to get you looking like that.

105
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,317
Now we have to do the whole
thing all over again.

106
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:11,119
And you.

107
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:14,224
Hand them over.

108
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,470
Come on. Come on.
Cough it up.

109
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:26,011
I am invited, Stepmother.

110
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,946
If she goes,
she'll just embarrass us.

111
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:32,382
- She has nothing to wear.
- Now, girls...

112
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:35,182
of course Cinderelly may go.

113
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:39,556
Unfortunately, she has
a few things to do before the ball.

114
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:45,091
First, she has to polish my shoes...

115
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:47,598
then cook us a pot roast,
whiten the bathtubs...

116
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,761
shampoo the cat,
reshingle the roof...

117
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,431
give the carriage a lube job -

118
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:55,565
Shall I continue?

119
00:09:56,476 --> 00:10:00,242
Ella, say no.
You don't have to put up with that.

120
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:02,948
Get back to the kitchen.

121
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:05,807
You're not her Prince Charming.

122
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:12,292
You're the dishwasher.

123
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:15,659
I am not.
I do laundry... too.

124
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:20,688
Ella isn't the only one
who's worked up about the ball.

125
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:26,034
The prince is so excited
it's almost like he has a personality.

126
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:29,131
The same as always, Your Highness?

127
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,743
Not too much off the front.

128
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,770
Everything must be perfect.

129
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:37,839
Tonight's the night
I meet my damsel.

130
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,249
It says so right here in the book.

131
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,280
Princely Rule Book, Section 12:
"On his 21st birthday...

132
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:48,122
every prince must
host a ball to find a damsel...

133
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:50,788
preferably blonde,
who is either imprisoned...

134
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:53,354
cursed or distressed."

135
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:59,803
Great. Our downstairs neighbor,
the Airhead Formerly Known As Prince.

136
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,102
There's gotta be something better on.

137
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:04,109
There's Rapunzel...

138
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:07,112
single-handedly keeping the kingdom's
shampoo industry in the black.

139
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,274
Apparently, her people haveyet
to master scissor technology.

140
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,284
Little Red Riding Hood.

141
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:14,343
Everywolf's favorite
between-meals snack.

142
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:19,848
And then there's Rumpelstiltskin.

143
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:21,655
Still trying to get the baby.

144
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:23,662
Don't ask me whyhe wants a baby.

145
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,891
Messy diapers and the drooling
and the this and the -

146
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:30,567
- Can we limit the editorializing?
- Munk. Mambo.

147
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:33,104
It's time for my vacation.

148
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:35,470
- I'm off to Scotland.
- Why?

149
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,600
Remember what I taught you.

150
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:41,044
You have to maintain the balance
between good and evil.

151
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:43,947
- Don't worry, boss.
- We're pros here.

152
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:47,248
- We're your assistants.
- Actually, I'm senior assistant.

153
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,916
What? Just 'cause he hired you 300 years
before me, that makes you senior?

154
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:57,758
Does he know he's wearing a skirt?

155
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,656
That's better.

156
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:06,869
Now, guys,
no fooling around with the scales.

157
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:11,239
Same for the staff.
No turning lead into gold...

158
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:16,009
no giving yourself
huge pectoral muscles, Mambo.

159
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:18,516
Hey. It was a onetime thing, okay?

160
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:22,680
And keep a special eye on Cinderella.

161
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:26,247
She'll be downstairs
at the prince's ball tonight.

162
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:28,452
Everything will go by the book.

163
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:32,965
- Just like it always does.
- Munk, open the portal.

164
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:35,023
Yes, Your Wizardry.

165
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:43,769
And remember.

166
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:46,710
Keep your eyes on the ball.

167
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:51,773
Fore!

168
00:12:56,823 --> 00:13:01,954
How do you like that? I'm a prince
of portals! A master of magic!

169
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:05,486
Big deal. You're the doorman.
Door pig. Hippo thingy.

170
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,692
You know what you are.

171
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:10,570
Can we get to work, please?

172
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:10,592
Can we get to work, please?

173
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,749
Ricky, where haveyou been?

174
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,811
You have to wash the dishes
for the prince's ball.

175
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:33,052
You went to see Ella again,
didn't you?

176
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:37,692
What does she see
in that loser prince?

177
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:41,529
She doesn't even know the guy. I have
to deal with him every day of my life.

178
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:45,865
She is a prince dreamer, mon frère.

179
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:49,374
- You're gonna get nowhere with her.
- Shut up.

180
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:52,502
I'm not trying to get anywhere.
She's a friend.

181
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:56,713
I know what kind offriend
you're talking about.

182
00:13:57,383 --> 00:14:00,784
I need a friend like that,
my friend. I tell you, huh?

183
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:03,720
Oui. With friends like that,
why do you need enemies?

184
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:07,348
Gentlemen!

185
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:13,363
The prince is furious.
He demands his cranberryjuice.

186
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,432
- No!
- Not the cake!

187
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:19,962
Vanilla.

188
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:28,170
Come on, girls. Think prince.

189
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:30,215
- Don't work too hard.
- Missed a spot.

190
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:32,217
See you at the ball.

191
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:33,775
As if.

192
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:35,013
Ella.

193
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:39,083
Remember.
Shampoo and condition the cat.

194
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:43,754
And don't forget to swab out
its sores. It loves that.

195
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:47,155
Oops. Sorry.

196
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:58,873
Weepy, weepy,
cry, cry, cry, sob.

197
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:01,937
And then,
fairy godmother to the rescue.

198
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:03,948
I love this part.

199
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:05,685
"Don't cry, child."

200
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:06,117
"Don't cry, child."

201
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,016
Don't cry, child.

202
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,021
I'm your fairy godmother.

203
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,990
I have come to grant
yourwish to be a real boy.

204
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:14,185
What?

205
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:18,193
- You're Cinderella, right?
- Yeah.

206
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:21,256
Then let's get you ready for the ball.

207
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:39,608
That's not right.

208
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:48,119
Nice.

209
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,392
Yes.

210
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:00,668
Here we go.

211
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:05,803
Sassy!

212
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,241
Oops.

213
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:11,939
- Yes.
- Wow.

214
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:19,589
- You look beautiful, Salmonella.
- It's Cinderella.

215
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:22,958
Cinderella going to the ball - again.

216
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:30,763
Sleeping Beauty, still asleep.

217
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:33,999
Somebody get her
a double espresso, please.

218
00:16:34,073 --> 00:16:36,007
And get me a triple.

219
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:40,307
You have but three chances
to guess my name...

220
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:45,043
and if you fail,
your baby shall be mine!

221
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:49,080
Rumpelstiltskin,
still going for custody.

222
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:51,089
I think he wants weekends, right?

223
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:55,552
Always the same thing.
The good guys win.

224
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:57,562
And what do you want to have happen?

225
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,564
Rumpelstiltskin gets the baby?

226
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:02,066
Cinderella stays a maid?

227
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:04,659
I just wish we could mix it up
a little bit...

228
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:06,932
make it a little edgier.

229
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:08,940
Then let 'em have
their happy endings.

230
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:13,206
We are not tipping the scales of good
and evil so you can be entertained.

231
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:16,780
What if we made the seven
dwarves seven feet tall and -

232
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,511
- No way.
- What about making Rapunzel go bald?

233
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:22,243
Forget it.

234
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,057
Couldn't we just give her
split ends...

235
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:28,150
or dandruff
or a mullet or something?

236
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:30,422
What about that?

237
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:41,199
Look at me. I'm Munk.

238
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:43,901
Mambo, get down!

239
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:46,444
I am Munk, and my nostrils show.

240
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:48,912
I've got dandruffand bad BO.

241
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:51,279
Stop fooling around.
You're gonna break it.

242
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,511
Munk is a bossy know-it-all...

243
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:56,180
with a butt the size
of a shopping mall.

244
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,655
Stop it. That's enough!

245
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:01,557
All right, girls.
We're almost at the ball.

246
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,618
- What areyou doing?
- Give me that perfume!

247
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:05,630
- It's mine!
- I need it more!

248
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:07,689
- No, I do!
- I smell like camel sweat.

249
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:10,998
- I smell like a dead pig. Smell me!
- Knock it off!.

250
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,471
Can't you two pretend to be
human beings for one night?

251
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,031
- Hurry up, slowpoke!
- Ow!

252
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:23,172
Who am I kidding?

253
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:25,183
These girls are hopeless.

254
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:27,981
A donkey would have a better
chance of marrying the prince.

255
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:31,079
I'm never gonna get ahead
in the world if I count on them.

256
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:33,921
There has to be another way.

257
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:37,224
And he's running!
It's Mambo by a mile!

258
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:40,231
You spin it off that stand,
you are in big trouble!

259
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,823
I'm dancin'.
I'm dancin'.

260
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:45,166
I'm skatin'! I'm skatin'!
I'm backwards skatin', backwards skatin'.

261
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:47,102
Not so easy. Not so easy.

262
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:53,404
What?

263
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,674
I told you to be careful!

264
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:57,739
- This is powerful magic!
- Oh, boy.

265
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:02,049
These things control the fate
of the entire kingdom!

266
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:04,612
Powerful magic?

267
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,488
The fate ofthe kingdom?

268
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:12,492
Girls, Mama's gonna take matters
into her own hands.

269
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,499
Don't wait up.

270
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,725
Mother!

271
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:20,969
Left. Left, left.

272
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,136
Right, right. Down, down, down.
More down. Downer.

273
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:28,273
- I'm calling the boss.
- Why?

274
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:30,611
Why? We fixed it. You fixed it.

275
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:35,619
We fixed it, 'cause I did the "down,
down, down, left" part, which helped.

276
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:37,178
Yes or no?

277
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:40,291
Don't call the boss!

278
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:04,443
Forty flights of steps in heels?

279
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:07,051
This had better be good.

280
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,089
"Chapter Four. How a prince
must behave at the ball.

281
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,458
One: Smile at maidens."

282
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,529
Hello.

283
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,266
"Two: Look heroic."

284
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:26,427
Yes.

285
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:33,776
"Three: Be 'roman tick'."

286
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:37,372
Be "roman tick"?

287
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:39,974
Be romantic!

288
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,288
There he is!

289
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,021
To one side.

290
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:51,289
Excuse me.

291
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:55,230
He's dreamy.

292
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:57,235
- I like him!
- I love him!

293
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,506
Time to meet your prince,
my dear Mozzarella.

294
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:09,309
- It's Cinderella.
- Really? Why'd you change it?

295
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,310
Thank you, Fairy Godmother.

296
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:19,847
Remember, it all ends at midnight.

297
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:27,598
Move it.
You are in so much trouble!

298
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:31,796
And what are you gonna do about it?
Turn me into a frog, Mr. Wizard?

299
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,839
Do you even know what
you could have done?

300
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:38,365
Yeah, yeah. I know. I could have knocked
over the scales of good and evil...

301
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:41,971
and changed the destiny of
every character in Fairytale Land.

302
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:44,709
Blah, blah, blah.
But I didn't!

303
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:47,012
Hiya, boys.

304
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:50,982
Ouchy mama!

305
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:52,318
What's doing?

306
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:53,756
Frieda?

307
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:57,193
So this is where it all happens.

308
00:21:57,262 --> 00:22:01,358
And all this time
I thought itwas fate.

309
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:04,894
- You can't be up here.
- What is she doing here?

310
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,938
I didn't order a stepmother.

311
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:11,033
Come here, cutie.
Show me those magic arts.

312
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,873
Come on, big boy. Teach me.

313
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:18,849
I kind of go for these
power-mad, villainous, evil women.

314
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:21,078
She thinks I'm the wizard.

315
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:25,055
We don't really do workshops.

316
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:28,218
Maybe you can come back
another year?

317
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:32,161
This operation's about to
have a hostile takeover.

318
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,222
Just call it a little power play.

319
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:37,702
Man, she is good!

320
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,136
- I mean bad.
- Get out!

321
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:42,867
Or I'll zap you into a toad!

322
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:45,535
- Can you zap?
- Just watch me.

323
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:50,048
Baby, I think you're
all yap and no zap.

324
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,513
Okay.

325
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:59,114
Now we're flying. I guess when you say
"zapping", you mean "flying".

326
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:03,389
Shut up and drive! I'll open the portal
and get the boss!

327
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:05,362
He'll fix everything!

328
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,396
- Don't let her get the staff!
- Let go of it, you little freak.

329
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:14,329
No air bags?

330
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,945
Oh, gosh!

331
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:28,711
Mayday! Mayday!
We're going down.

332
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:34,025
Ouch! Fire! Burning!

333
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:38,359
- Hot. Hot, hot. Hot.
- Prepare for grievous bodily harm!

334
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:50,368
Warn me next time you zap.

335
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:03,421
You should totally
fall in love with me!

336
00:24:03,489 --> 00:24:06,287
- Nuh-uh. Me.
- I read a book once.

337
00:24:06,358 --> 00:24:08,383
A very interesting book.

338
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:16,797
- Who is that?
- Nice slippers.

339
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:18,860
Her feet are so tiny.

340
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:27,978
She's perfect.

341
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:31,015
- Where is she from?
- She's beautiful.

342
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:53,303
What's wrong?

343
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:56,341
I detect the strangest smell
of pumpkin.

344
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:00,168
I like pumpkin.

345
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:03,480
Welcome to
the worst moment of my life.

346
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:05,639
So far.

347
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:08,846
Let's see.

348
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:12,888
Which of my toys
should I playwith first?

349
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,388
Warm.

350
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:21,656
What's this?

351
00:25:25,571 --> 00:25:27,664
My, Grandma.
What big eyes you have.

352
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:31,231
All the better
to see you with, my dear.

353
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,710
And what big yellow teeth you have.

354
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:37,271
The better to eat you with!

355
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:44,014
Here they are again.
Interesting.

356
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:49,022
Now let's see if -

357
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:54,224
Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair!

358
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,198
I wonder what happens if I just -

359
00:26:02,774 --> 00:26:04,002
Ow.

360
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:09,110
Ow! I'm on my keys.

361
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:14,718
It's so easy!
Just the touch of a finger.

362
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:32,794
A pajama party.

363
00:26:57,796 --> 00:27:02,062
You have but three chances
to guess my name...

364
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:07,697
and if you fail,
your baby shall be mine!

365
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:12,401
- Fabio?
- Nope.

366
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:13,967
- Beelzebub?
- No.

367
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:17,409
Rumpel... masashi?

368
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:30,153
Rock-a-bye-bye, baby.

369
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:39,166
Hey. That's my house.

370
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:40,534
And...

371
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:43,272
Ella?

372
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:47,043
Hey, you gotta be kidding me.
That little -

373
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:49,870
She gets the prince...

374
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:54,146
and the palace, and I get nada?

375
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:55,652
Zilch?

376
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:57,120
Nothing?

377
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:59,680
Uh-uh. No way!

378
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:02,192
Not while I'm in charge!

379
00:28:05,797 --> 00:28:07,731
Left, right, left.

380
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,768
Left, right, left.
Left, right, left.

381
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:12,827
Left, right, left.

382
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:22,914
I don't believe this.

383
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:24,915
How did she get there?

384
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:26,917
And where did she get that dress?

385
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:33,920
And where can I get one? I love
those little ruffles down the front.

386
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:46,403
So, what do you do?

387
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:50,407
Are you a fair maiden, lady-in-waiting,
damsel in distress?

388
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:54,107
I will be, kind of, at midnight.

389
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,511
Come on!

390
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:07,048
I think the little princess
needs a makeover!

391
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:15,526
What happened?

392
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:19,059
Sorry.

393
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:24,698
Where did that maiden go?
Did you see her?

394
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:27,239
Maiden!

395
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:28,870
Maiden!

396
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,651
A slipper.

397
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:39,754
Maybe she was the maiden after all.

398
00:29:39,825 --> 00:29:44,558
At last. A damsel in distress!

399
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:49,422
Here. Section four,
subparagraph eight.

400
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:52,800
"Once a prince finds his true love,
he may never let her go."

401
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:57,971
I will find you, my love...

402
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:01,479
if I must ride to the ends
of the earth to do so.

403
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:04,045
Your Majesty.

404
00:30:04,716 --> 00:30:06,707
Please wait. I'm right...

405
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,180
here.

406
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:11,813
I can swim a little!

407
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,290
That is the prince?

408
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:17,384
What a loser.

409
00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:21,255
Serves her right.

410
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:27,399
If I'm gonna
shake things up around here...

411
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:30,066
I'm gonna need some bad guys.

412
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:33,909
It's time to party!

413
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,527
Maybe it's just fireworks?

414
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:06,336
I never seen that before.

415
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:09,278
- Come on. Let's go.
- This way.

416
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:28,025
Yeah, yeah.

417
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,300
Something's going down at the palace.

418
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,494
Sweet.

419
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:39,933
Death from above!

420
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:01,891
Rick. Oh, my gosh. Rick! Hey.

421
00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:06,626
I was dancing with the prince
and my dress disappeared.

422
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:09,299
Okay. So that's too much
information, but thank you.

423
00:32:09,374 --> 00:32:12,400
It was supposed to last
till midnight, but it didn't.

424
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:15,935
And then there was this light in the sky.
Something's wrong.

425
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:20,144
- Yeah. I'll say.
- Coming overthe bridge! Look!

426
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:36,193
Evildoers of our kingdom!

427
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:39,399
- Hiya!
- Hello.

428
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,961
So, guys...

429
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,668
ever think there could be
more to life than this?

430
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:47,769
We're always the losers,
the bad guys.

431
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:50,007
Is that fair? No.

432
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:52,011
Frieda.

433
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,074
And who wins?

434
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:57,087
The dorky ingenues
and the pretentious princes.

435
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:01,948
From now on,
say good-bye to losing.

436
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:05,958
And say hello to winning.

437
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:09,159
Yes to little girls
who get eaten bywolves.

438
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:10,792
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

439
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:14,202
To princesses
who never get their prince!

440
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:16,467
Because starting tonight...

441
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:18,509
I give you...

442
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:21,545
happily n'ever after!

443
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:27,207
Yeah. This is where you came in.

444
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:29,480
I hate to tell ya,
but it gets worse.

445
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:36,223
Yeah, yeah.

446
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:41,559
We demand that you depart
this palace at once.

447
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:43,567
Yeah. You heard the man.

448
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:46,661
What you gonna do if we don't?

449
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:50,568
- Let's make guard kabobs.
- Dibs on the chubby one!

450
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:54,134
- This is gonna be great!
- I like to hit things.

451
00:33:56,014 --> 00:33:57,948
Ow, ow! Not the face!

452
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,950
That was my favorite leg!

453
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,328
- Rick, we have to do something.
- Okay. We could get -

454
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:15,924
I know. We'll find the prince.
He's out looking for me now.

455
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,934
- We have to find him.
- For what?

456
00:34:18,002 --> 00:34:20,732
He's a pretty boy. He just does
whatever his little book says.

457
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:23,603
I'm sure his book
will tell him to save the day.

458
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:26,872
If you think that poser
is gonna save us, you're dreaming.

459
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:30,039
Maybe I am dreaming,
but somehow...

460
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:32,515
I know this wasn't
supposed to happen.

461
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:35,553
It's Frieda.
She's making everything bad.

462
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,386
Just like she always has for me,
but for everyone.

463
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:43,018
We need a hero to stop her.
We need the prince.

464
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:46,856
- You mean you need the prince.
- This isn't about me.

465
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:48,865
She's taking over.

466
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:51,401
Yes, it is. It's about you
becoming a princess...

467
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:54,131
so you can move upstairs
and forget people like me exist.

468
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:56,264
You know what?
You're being ridiculous.

469
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,809
Ridiculous?
You know what?

470
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:01,842
You need to get out of here.
You're blocking my light.

471
00:35:01,913 --> 00:35:03,904
And I've got dishes to wash.

472
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:05,176
Okay.

473
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,649
Fine.

474
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:08,709
I don't need you anyway.

475
00:35:12,657 --> 00:35:16,149
Go with her, mon ami.
She does need you.

476
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:19,219
Forwhat?
To chase after that jerk?

477
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:21,522
Prince envy.

478
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:29,974
How could we screw up so badly?

479
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,100
The wizard will never trust us again.

480
00:35:32,177 --> 00:35:34,111
The wizard 'll never trust you again.

481
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:37,512
- You knocked over the ball!
- You gave her the staff!

482
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:39,573
A wicked stepmother?

483
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,949
With the wizard's staff!

484
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,251
She could take over the kingdom!

485
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:50,226
If we don't fix this mess before
the boss gets back from vacation, he'll -

486
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:52,559
He'll turn us into toads
is what he'll do.

487
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:56,225
I like the way I look already.
I don't want to be a frog!

488
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,363
What if he makes me look like you?

489
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:06,834
- I know what we need.
- Yeah. A new job.

490
00:36:06,911 --> 00:36:09,345
I've seen these tales
a million times...

491
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:12,383
and who is the one guy
that always wins in the end?

492
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,317
- The prince!
- Or the simpleton.

493
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:17,786
Exactly. The simpleton.

494
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:20,290
I mean... the prince!

495
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:22,317
Hello?

496
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:23,883
Excuse me.

497
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,495
Cinderella?

498
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:29,499
How do you know me? Never mind.

499
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,501
Did you guys see
a prince come this way?

500
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:34,970
Six foot 2, perfect body,
perfect face, perfect everything.

501
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,668
Why, no. Did you come from
the palace, by any chance?

502
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:41,143
Yes. It was horrible.

503
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:43,407
Trolls, witches.

504
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:45,472
The bad guys have taken over.

505
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:49,987
Who are you guys?
What are you guys?

506
00:36:50,054 --> 00:36:53,182
I'm Munk. He's Mambo.

507
00:36:53,258 --> 00:36:56,250
We work for the wizard.
We had a little accident.

508
00:36:56,327 --> 00:36:57,692
Accident?

509
00:36:57,762 --> 00:37:02,461
We let a wicked stepmother
get control of the kingdom's destiny!

510
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:04,832
She has the boss's staff!

511
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:07,235
Okay. Okay. No arguing.

512
00:37:07,305 --> 00:37:10,741
Could you guys fix all this and make
everything the way it was meant to be?

513
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:14,175
- Of course.
- But first we'd have to get past Frieda.

514
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:16,179
For which we need the prince.

515
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:20,513
Come with me. I'm looking for him too.
He'll help us save the day.

516
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:24,546
The prince defeats Frieda...

517
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:26,613
we fix the scales
of good and evil...

518
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:29,182
and the boss doesn't have to know!

519
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:32,830
That might actually work.
Let's find the prince.

520
00:37:32,897 --> 00:37:37,266
Heck yeah, it'll work! He'll take
that mother down a few steps.

521
00:38:03,394 --> 00:38:04,725
Oh, yeah.

522
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:22,739
Hey.

523
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:25,640
Seven billy goats gruff,
medium rare.

524
00:38:26,651 --> 00:38:28,812
Three little pigs' ribs...

525
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:31,150
and a cow-that-jumped-over-the-moon
burger...

526
00:38:31,222 --> 00:38:32,712
with fries.

527
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:36,216
How's the salad, big guy?

528
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:45,198
- Getyou guys a refill on the mead?
- What's your rush, kid?

529
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,600
- Sit down.
- Take a load off.

530
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:51,141
- Pour yourself a glass.
- All right.

531
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:53,200
Don't mind if I do.

532
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:56,269
That's the first time
anybody asked me to sit down.

533
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,084
I'm melting!

534
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:02,745
- So what's your name, kid?
- Rick.

535
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:08,324
So, are you a good guy
or a bad guy or a what guy?

536
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:10,327
Neither. I work in the kitchen.

537
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:13,530
Let me give you some advice.

538
00:39:13,598 --> 00:39:17,227
Around here,
you're either a good guy...

539
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,326
or a bad guy.

540
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:21,634
And between you and me...

541
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:24,869
I don't see much future
in being good.

542
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:45,253
Mon frère, what are you doing
hanging around?

543
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:48,696
Those guys are cool. They're not
too good to hang with the help.

544
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:51,599
A good friend does not
let a good friend down.

545
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:53,796
Would you get out of my way?

546
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:57,837
You should be with her,
out there by her side.

547
00:39:57,909 --> 00:39:59,433
What for?

548
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:02,978
She wants a prince, remember?

549
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:21,254
"Wizardress."

550
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:24,265
Too hard to say. General?

551
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:25,563
Mistress?

552
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:27,035
Queen of Calamity?

553
00:40:27,105 --> 00:40:28,265
Your Highness.

554
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:29,863
Your Lowness.

555
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:31,238
Your Badness.

556
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:34,608
Excuse me, Empress of Evil.

557
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,169
"Empress."

558
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:41,908
I like it. Still kind of stuffy,
but beats "stepmother".

559
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,648
I've come to offer my services.

560
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:48,317
And why would I need you, shrimp?

561
00:40:48,392 --> 00:40:51,293
I'm Rumpelstiltskin.

562
00:40:51,362 --> 00:40:55,731
I'm the supremely evil
diabolical mastermind.

563
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,792
I have information
about a plot against you.

564
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,304
Already? Get out!

565
00:41:02,073 --> 00:41:04,007
Wait. Hold on.

566
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:07,602
This info - What do you
want in exchange?

567
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:10,772
I'll become your evil co-wizard.

568
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:13,946
Diabolical vice president.

569
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:15,781
Your malicious creative exec.

570
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:18,253
Dastardly follower
in charge of badness?

571
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:24,088
I stole a baby!

572
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:26,357
That's about as evil as it gets.

573
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,193
Okay, okay.

574
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:29,790
Sidekick.

575
00:41:32,737 --> 00:41:38,676
Your fear-inspiring,
terrifyingly evil sidekick!

576
00:41:45,883 --> 00:41:48,181
Somebody needs a diaper change.

577
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,685
Empress...

578
00:41:54,759 --> 00:42:00,220
I overheard the wizard's assistants
conspiring in the woods.

579
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:04,632
Those little freaks? Get out.
You are so wasting my time.

580
00:42:04,702 --> 00:42:09,867
But they're searching for the prince,
and helping them is a girl.

581
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:11,340
A girl?

582
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:14,173
5'4", dark hair, beautiful...

583
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:18,978
humble clothes,
extremely petite feet -

584
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,642
Ella.

585
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:25,553
I hate that girl.
She's so... girlie.

586
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:36,357
Your Majesty?

587
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:37,992
Prince?

588
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:42,005
- That didn't sound like a prince.
- Did I say I wanted it edgier?

589
00:42:42,073 --> 00:42:44,871
I don't want it edgy.
I want it happy.

590
00:42:44,942 --> 00:42:48,002
Roses and tiaras
and ball gowns and -

591
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:57,617
Kiss it!
Maybe it'll turn into a prince.

592
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:12,696
It was worth a try.

593
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:19,903
Sweet.

594
00:43:29,186 --> 00:43:31,381
Hey. Watch the snout.

595
00:43:32,056 --> 00:43:34,854
Believe me. I'm watchin' it!
I'm watchin' it!

596
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,260
Fellow rogues, victory is near.

597
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:49,829
But there's just one
little seed of goodness...

598
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:53,604
that refuses to die
in the winter of our content.

599
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:58,242
Go forth.
Find Cinderella...

600
00:43:58,316 --> 00:44:01,251
and bring her to me!

601
00:44:04,221 --> 00:44:06,121
Us work?

602
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,623
Before noon?

603
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:11,856
Yes, well,
we're more nocturnal villains.

604
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:14,090
You see,
that means we operate at night.

605
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:40,280
You still here?

606
00:45:34,445 --> 00:45:36,276
How doyou start this thing?

607
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:19,650
It's probably just a -

608
00:46:19,723 --> 00:46:22,089
What do you call those things
that aren't wolves?

609
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:33,936
Kiss it! Maybe it will
turn into a prince!

610
00:46:34,004 --> 00:46:37,235
Bad doggie! Down, boy! Stay!

611
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:52,452
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

612
00:46:55,826 --> 00:46:57,418
Oh, gosh!

613
00:47:00,865 --> 00:47:02,992
The Mountain of Death.

614
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:04,557
Let's go, boy.

615
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:27,880
Ouch.

616
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:35,131
Please tell me that's modern art.

617
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:39,735
I don't think we should -

618
00:47:56,153 --> 00:47:57,814
Locks on the door.

619
00:47:59,156 --> 00:48:01,147
Bars on the windows.

620
00:48:02,226 --> 00:48:04,592
I know who lives here.

621
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:16,195
Hey, that was my big toe.

622
00:48:16,273 --> 00:48:17,831
Hey!

623
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:22,242
- Hey, get away from there!
- No trespassers!

624
00:48:22,313 --> 00:48:24,247
Yeah, can't you read?

625
00:48:24,315 --> 00:48:27,614
I bet them's the ones
that took Snow White!

626
00:48:28,886 --> 00:48:32,686
- We don't even know Snow White.
- I used to spy on her though.

627
00:48:35,392 --> 00:48:37,690
Well, no. More like
peeking in on her.

628
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:39,695
Checking in.
Let's call it that.

629
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:41,754
I checked in
on her occasionally.

630
00:48:43,634 --> 00:48:47,126
We're looking for the prince. If we don't
find him, the kingdom will be lost.

631
00:48:48,172 --> 00:48:50,572
And can I remind you
of something?

632
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:52,575
We're being chased by the bad guys.

633
00:48:57,648 --> 00:49:00,742
Correction - surrounded by them.

634
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:03,616
Please. Please.
You have to help us.

635
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:06,045
Inside.

636
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:21,064
Initiatin' primary defense!

637
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:26,704
Come on, come on!

638
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:48,888
It's the big one.

639
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:52,298
Why'd you call it the big one?

640
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:55,361
It's the mother of all battles!

641
00:49:56,106 --> 00:49:57,596
Move it!

642
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,009
- We knew it was a-comin'.
- We just didn't know how.

643
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,275
- Or why.
- Or when.

644
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:07,977
We've been gettin' ready
for the big one for years.

645
00:50:08,986 --> 00:50:09,975
Yeah.

646
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:27,570
- Sic 'em!
- Yeah, yeah.

647
00:50:30,307 --> 00:50:33,208
Billy Bob, crank up the big lady!

648
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:45,179
- You!
- What?

649
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:48,622
- With me!
- Me? But I don't -

650
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:50,319
Lock and load, Cletus!

651
00:50:57,835 --> 00:50:59,860
What's that?

652
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,400
She's stuck!
Bubba, give me a hand!

653
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:07,137
How about a foot?

654
00:51:18,255 --> 00:51:20,485
Darlin', load up them diamonds!

655
00:51:21,158 --> 00:51:22,853
Me?
Are you sure?

656
00:51:22,926 --> 00:51:24,450
I don't think that's a -

657
00:51:25,129 --> 00:51:26,118
Diamonds?

658
00:51:26,196 --> 00:51:28,721
Why do you think we been savin' 'em?

659
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:32,997
They're harder than a knight's sword
and sharper than a dragon's tooth!

660
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:36,639
Come on, come on!

661
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:38,902
Take that, you varmints!

662
00:51:43,614 --> 00:51:46,845
You're a wolf!
Get some teeth!

663
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:49,215
Some growling would be nice!

664
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:51,277
Some biting would be better!

665
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:58,394
Target 500 yards!
Follow me in!

666
00:51:58,462 --> 00:51:59,451
Roger.

667
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:04,898
Oh, no!
We got witches! 2:00!

668
00:52:04,968 --> 00:52:07,698
I really, really don't like this.

669
00:52:07,771 --> 00:52:09,762
What? And I do?

670
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,472
Come on, little lady!

671
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:21,950
Show me what you got, witches!

672
00:52:55,552 --> 00:52:56,644
- Munk!
- Wow!

673
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,187
Mambo!

674
00:52:58,255 --> 00:53:00,155
Reload! Reload!

675
00:53:00,224 --> 00:53:02,658
Rubies, diamonds, everything we got!

676
00:53:11,368 --> 00:53:13,859
I'm hit!
I'm hit!

677
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:20,234
Dang!

678
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:22,778
We tried to teach
Snow White to shoot...

679
00:53:22,846 --> 00:53:26,543
- but she couldn't hit the side of a barn.
- Wow!

680
00:53:26,617 --> 00:53:28,551
- What?
- I didn't know I had it in me.

681
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:31,383
Lady, you can call me Duke.

682
00:53:31,455 --> 00:53:35,892
Ice Queen! We lost Ice Queen!
Retreat!

683
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:37,950
No way!
Hold it together!

684
00:53:38,028 --> 00:53:40,053
Circle around!
Do you copy?

685
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:41,119
Roger.

686
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,636
Hey, we should spell out
"Surrender Cinderella!"

687
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:49,331
Negative!
Proceed as planned!

688
00:53:52,643 --> 00:53:55,134
Yeah!
Eat this, dwarves!

689
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:01,345
Ella!

690
00:54:06,924 --> 00:54:08,414
Pardon me, ladies!

691
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:15,931
- Ella!
- Rick! You're here!

692
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:18,331
Yeah. Things were kinda slow
in the kitchen.

693
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:22,366
Munk! Mambo!
Jump on!

694
00:54:30,781 --> 00:54:31,770
Duke!

695
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:33,816
Don't worry about us, darlin'.

696
00:54:33,884 --> 00:54:35,875
You just find that there prince!

697
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:40,819
The dishwasher?
The dishwasher saved her?

698
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:43,951
This is like a good dream
you can't wake up from.

699
00:54:44,027 --> 00:54:46,757
I've sent witches.
I've sent trolls.

700
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,821
Nothing is working!

701
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:53,730
Then the prince took
Cinderella to his castle...

702
00:54:53,804 --> 00:54:56,329
and they lived happily ever after.

703
00:54:56,406 --> 00:54:57,896
No, they did not!

704
00:54:57,975 --> 00:54:59,499
Whose side are you on?

705
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:05,578
If I may ask...

706
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:08,709
why do you hate Cinderella so much?

707
00:55:08,785 --> 00:55:12,778
I mean, according to the tale,
she never did anything to you.

708
00:55:12,856 --> 00:55:15,450
I don't know.
Because she's gorgeous?

709
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:17,584
Because she's too stupid
to know her place?

710
00:55:17,661 --> 00:55:20,357
Because she's so cheerful
about everything?

711
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:23,092
Because if she wins,
she'll be the queen...

712
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:26,033
and I will be the stepmom forever!

713
00:55:29,906 --> 00:55:32,704
Is that baby
making you soft or what?

714
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:39,110
That's it! You can't send witches
or wolves to do an empress's job.

715
00:55:39,182 --> 00:55:41,150
Get me a broom.

716
00:55:41,218 --> 00:55:45,416
I'm gonna take out little
Miss Goody-two-slippers myself!

717
00:55:50,894 --> 00:55:52,521
Heads up, Cindy!

718
00:55:52,596 --> 00:55:54,928
Stepmama's on her way!

719
00:56:01,104 --> 00:56:03,197
Thanks, Rick,
but what are you doing here?

720
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:05,605
I just thought you could
use a little help.

721
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:08,869
- You're the best.
- Any luck finding the prince?

722
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:12,437
Not yet. This is Mambo and Munk.
They're helping too.

723
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:19,381
Look, I say there's no time
to find the prince.

724
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:23,051
We gotta take Frieda out...
ourselves.

725
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:26,857
- But she has the wizard's staff.
- So take it.

726
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:30,422
Just create a distraction,
sneak up on her and jump her.

727
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,060
Okay, good. We make a distraction,
we do some sneaking...

728
00:56:33,136 --> 00:56:35,127
and then this jumping thing though -

729
00:56:35,205 --> 00:56:37,730
I don't know. I have a bad back.
Who's doing the jumping?

730
00:56:37,808 --> 00:56:39,173
We are.

731
00:56:39,242 --> 00:56:42,905
But there are trolls
in the palace and that woman!

732
00:56:42,979 --> 00:56:45,777
Big deal.
I can get you in.

733
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:49,114
We could do this...
without a prince.

734
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:52,183
There he is!
I'm sure that's him!

735
00:56:52,255 --> 00:56:55,622
Oh, maiden!
Maiden!

736
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:57,853
Hello! Prince!

737
00:56:57,928 --> 00:56:59,759
Hey! Up here!

738
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:02,697
- We're too high!
- Rick, go back!

739
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:05,792
- I can't!
- You can't or you won't?

740
00:57:06,503 --> 00:57:07,993
Come on.

741
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:10,798
Again with the crashing!

742
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:13,434
I hate gravity!
I hate it!

743
00:57:21,885 --> 00:57:23,716
Ella, you okay?

744
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:28,280
Prince?
Hello?

745
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:30,849
We must have overshot him by a mile.

746
00:57:30,927 --> 00:57:32,918
Yeah, we lost him.

747
00:57:32,996 --> 00:57:34,930
Just like you wanted.

748
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:37,558
What? Ella, I didn't -

749
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:41,463
Ella! Ella, wait!

750
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:47,469
Come on. We ran out of fuel
or something.

751
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:49,808
Sure. You don't wanna
find the prince.

752
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,940
You want him out of the way
so you can be the hero yourself.

753
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:57,350
Ella, I know the prince.
He's hopeless.

754
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,548
- And I know I can do it.
- No, you can't.

755
00:58:00,624 --> 00:58:03,354
You can't save the day.
You're not a prince. You're just...

756
00:58:05,061 --> 00:58:06,050
Rick.

757
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:10,388
I -

758
00:58:11,935 --> 00:58:13,869
- Sorry about that. Are you -
- Fine.

759
00:58:13,937 --> 00:58:16,201
It was fine.
I mean, I'm fine.

760
00:58:16,273 --> 00:58:19,140
- I guess we should look for the -
- Prince.

761
00:58:19,209 --> 00:58:21,143
- The prince.
- Yeah.

762
00:58:21,945 --> 00:58:24,004
We'll go back and find him.

763
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,342
Wait.

764
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:28,851
You wanna find him, fine,
but let's do it smart.

765
00:58:28,919 --> 00:58:32,218
It's almost dark, and we don't even know
which way is back.

766
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:35,690
You guys hang low.
I'll go look for him.

767
00:58:39,162 --> 00:58:40,322
Rick.

768
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:44,063
Thank you.

769
00:58:54,377 --> 00:58:57,141
So I'm finding
Ella's prince for her.

770
00:58:57,981 --> 00:59:00,211
This was the last thing
I wanted to do.

771
00:59:00,951 --> 00:59:03,784
But we both knew
how the story had to end.

772
01:00:48,224 --> 01:00:52,854
- We need your help.
- Oh, it's that kitchen boy.

773
01:00:52,929 --> 01:00:54,920
I don't have time to explain.
Ella needs you.

774
01:00:54,998 --> 01:00:58,593
- You gotta save her.
- Yeah, yes, yes.

775
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,595
Did you bring me my laundry?

776
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:05,300
Ella?
The girl you danced with?

777
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,538
- At the ball?
- That maiden?

778
01:01:08,611 --> 01:01:10,806
Well, I've crossed
deserts and mountains...

779
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,371
babbling brooks and things...

780
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:15,247
to bring her...

781
01:01:15,952 --> 01:01:17,886
this.

782
01:01:19,723 --> 01:01:21,953
You crossed a desert
to bring her a shoe?

783
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:24,623
Yes, well, it's in the book.

784
01:01:28,198 --> 01:01:31,099
So if Frieda hadn't
tipped the scales...

785
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:33,032
the prince and I
would have gotten married?

786
01:01:34,871 --> 01:01:36,634
You always do.

787
01:01:36,706 --> 01:01:40,005
What about Rick?
What happens to him?

788
01:01:40,076 --> 01:01:42,010
He just works in the kitchen.

789
01:01:42,078 --> 01:01:45,275
Yeah. It's not his story.

790
01:01:46,249 --> 01:01:50,549
- What's wrong?
- It's your happy ending.

791
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:53,145
You get wedding bells, roses.

792
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:55,248
You ride off into the sunset.

793
01:01:56,092 --> 01:01:58,754
- And then what?
- Nothing.

794
01:01:58,828 --> 01:02:00,853
That's the end of your tale.

795
01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:03,988
What?

796
01:02:06,503 --> 01:02:09,097
That's all?
That's my whole life?

797
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:11,106
I just marry the prince?

798
01:02:11,174 --> 01:02:12,766
What else did you expect?

799
01:02:13,676 --> 01:02:18,340
I don't know.
I guess... more.

800
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:21,475
I say happy endings are boring!

801
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:24,611
Just think about what you want,
and go for it!

802
01:02:31,628 --> 01:02:32,617
Frieda!

803
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:35,858
Oh, no!
Not again! Help!

804
01:02:35,932 --> 01:02:38,730
Hi, Cinderelly!

805
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:47,605
Under the bushes!
Hide!

806
01:02:48,611 --> 01:02:50,545
Underthe bushes?
That's a - Those aren't -

807
01:02:50,613 --> 01:02:52,103
That's a stick!

808
01:03:15,972 --> 01:03:17,906
Come to Stepmommy!

809
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:22,968
Ella! No!

810
01:03:23,046 --> 01:03:24,138
Rick!

811
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:36,416
Blast! Looks like we lost her!

812
01:03:50,473 --> 01:03:52,338
Maiden! Maiden!

813
01:03:52,408 --> 01:03:53,397
Help!

814
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:58,345
- Please! Please help me!
- Maiden!

815
01:03:58,414 --> 01:03:59,676
Prince!

816
01:04:00,383 --> 01:04:02,408
- Help!
- I've got -

817
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:07,547
Why...

818
01:04:07,624 --> 01:04:09,091
Iog...

819
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:10,854
hurt...

820
01:04:11,561 --> 01:04:12,994
prince?

821
01:04:13,663 --> 01:04:15,358
Sleepy now.

822
01:04:25,408 --> 01:04:27,035
Well, don't just sit there!

823
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,510
Get back on your horse!
Save her!

824
01:04:33,249 --> 01:04:35,979
Right. Perfect.

825
01:04:36,052 --> 01:04:37,883
My chance to prove myself.

826
01:04:40,957 --> 01:04:43,221
Exactly what am I saving her from?

827
01:04:43,293 --> 01:04:47,593
Basically, a power-mad evil
stepmother with awesome magic...

828
01:04:47,664 --> 01:04:50,098
and every bad guy
in the history of fairy tales...

829
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:52,191
who've taken over your palace.

830
01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:57,035
Forget it. This guy's useless.
I'm gonna save her.

831
01:04:57,106 --> 01:05:00,439
Rick, I like the idea.

832
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:04,173
But I don't know
how to break this to you...

833
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:06,511
but that is just not how it works.

834
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:10,041
He's the one who saves her.
Always.

835
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:12,314
You're the prince.

836
01:05:12,388 --> 01:05:14,913
Don't you want to save
your damsel in distress?

837
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:17,459
Yeah, and we're talkin'
distress big time!

838
01:05:19,195 --> 01:05:21,891
And I will save you...

839
01:05:21,965 --> 01:05:25,059
my little slipper girl!

840
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:33,771
Have no fear, my beloved!

841
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:43,945
Stirrups, straps,
do not let go of the reins.

842
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,510
Right. Got it.

843
01:06:00,803 --> 01:06:03,863
- What's goin' on?
- There's the dashing prince.

844
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:07,239
He's charging.
He's wielding his noble sword...

845
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,801
with fiery determination.

846
01:06:09,879 --> 01:06:12,677
He's falling off! He's falling off
the steed. He fell off.

847
01:06:12,749 --> 01:06:15,843
He's on the ground now. He's on the
ground. He's looking for his noble sword.

848
01:06:15,918 --> 01:06:17,943
I'm almost startin'
to feel sorry for the guy.

849
01:06:18,021 --> 01:06:20,353
He's feelin' around.
That's a stick.

850
01:06:21,424 --> 01:06:23,085
- They're kickin' him now.
- Easy!

851
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:25,389
- And they're laughing at him.
- That hurt!

852
01:06:25,461 --> 01:06:28,658
- And they're - He just got... captured.
- Ow!

853
01:06:28,731 --> 01:06:31,131
"Capture by trolls...

854
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,600
Kiss thy royal butt good-bye"?

855
01:06:37,674 --> 01:06:39,005
Bye-bye!

856
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:43,839
Well, no more prince.
What now?

857
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:47,015
No more anybody else either.

858
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:48,072
Look.

859
01:07:02,365 --> 01:07:05,129
We have to fix the scales
and save the kingdom.

860
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:07,795
While there's something
left to save.

861
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:11,067
We will... without a prince.

862
01:07:18,514 --> 01:07:20,505
Well, well.

863
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:21,743
Ella.

864
01:07:23,653 --> 01:07:25,644
Cinderella.

865
01:07:25,722 --> 01:07:28,384
Now what should I do with you?

866
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,756
Turn you into a snail?

867
01:07:30,827 --> 01:07:32,852
Make you sleep for a thousand years?

868
01:07:32,929 --> 01:07:36,262
Shrink you?
Eat you?

869
01:07:36,332 --> 01:07:38,266
- Poison you?
- I'm not scared of you.

870
01:07:38,334 --> 01:07:40,268
When the prince comes -

871
01:07:40,336 --> 01:07:43,965
Everyone will live
happily ever after.

872
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:48,704
You always were such
an annoying little optimist.

873
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:53,408
Fortunately, happy endings
are so yesterday.

874
01:07:54,117 --> 01:07:56,950
Red Riding Hood -
Only the hood is left.

875
01:07:57,019 --> 01:07:59,112
Size six, if you want one.

876
01:07:59,188 --> 01:08:01,748
And Sleeping Beauty -

877
01:08:01,824 --> 01:08:04,850
Nighty-night...
after night, after night.

878
01:08:04,927 --> 01:08:06,189
Forever!

879
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:09,757
And Cinderelly...

880
01:08:09,832 --> 01:08:13,734
still dreaming of her
big, strong prince.

881
01:08:13,803 --> 01:08:16,772
Well, don't hold your breath, baby!

882
01:08:18,474 --> 01:08:19,964
I did it all -

883
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:23,637
the ball, the girl, the haircut,
the shirt, the steed.

884
01:08:23,713 --> 01:08:26,841
I even had the perfect underwear!

885
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:29,146
I'm a failure!

886
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:36,384
No. That's impossible.

887
01:08:36,459 --> 01:08:40,122
He's the prince. He's a hero.
He can't -

888
01:08:40,196 --> 01:08:42,494
Can't what? Lose?

889
01:08:49,639 --> 01:08:52,233
Feed that thing, you half-wit!

890
01:08:52,308 --> 01:08:55,004
But if I feed him now,
he's gonna be up all night.

891
01:08:55,077 --> 01:08:58,171
Then I'll feed him...
to the crocodiles in the moat.

892
01:08:59,248 --> 01:09:00,340
Empress?

893
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:02,642
Oh, Cinderelly?

894
01:09:03,853 --> 01:09:05,343
Going so soon?

895
01:09:10,092 --> 01:09:12,424
Your party's just
getting started, babe!

896
01:09:13,129 --> 01:09:16,565
We're gonna have our own ball.

897
01:09:26,142 --> 01:09:30,169
- Areyou sure about this?
- No. Act cool.

898
01:09:32,515 --> 01:09:35,040
Hey, I'm just tryin' to put
money in your pocket, player.

899
01:09:36,052 --> 01:09:37,041
Yo.

900
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:43,180
Yo.

901
01:09:45,595 --> 01:09:47,859
Yo! We're cool.

902
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:52,299
We're low.
We're on the down low, the DL.

903
01:09:52,368 --> 01:09:53,960
Down low.

904
01:09:54,036 --> 01:09:57,199
Way down here.
We're slowly, moley, roly-poly.

905
01:09:58,207 --> 01:10:01,301
Hey, what's wrong with you?
I'm down.

906
01:10:01,377 --> 01:10:02,867
They like me.

907
01:10:02,945 --> 01:10:07,245
I parlez-vous their hippy-hip,
coolio, bombio, phatty lingo.

908
01:10:07,316 --> 01:10:10,615
I'm a - I'm a hepcat.
That's what I am.

909
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:18,358
So the pig says, "I don't
have to go to the bathroom.

910
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:21,885
I get to go wee, wee, wee,
all the way home."

911
01:10:23,332 --> 01:10:25,425
Go wee, wee, wee! Yeah!

912
01:10:27,336 --> 01:10:28,826
Yo, Ricky!

913
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:31,905
Hey... you!

914
01:10:38,014 --> 01:10:40,312
Yo! Look who's back.

915
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,078
Hey, Ricky! What's up?

916
01:10:42,151 --> 01:10:45,177
Rick, come on.
Make a toast.

917
01:10:45,254 --> 01:10:47,188
I'd love to, but I gotta work.

918
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:50,916
You guys are my friends.
You understand, right?

919
01:10:51,794 --> 01:10:53,591
If I didn't know better...

920
01:10:53,663 --> 01:10:57,064
I'd think you didn't wanna
hang out with us.

921
01:10:58,134 --> 01:11:00,864
Here's to evil...

922
01:11:00,937 --> 01:11:02,871
to eatin' grandmas...

923
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:04,930
stealin' babies,
cookin' little kids.

924
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:07,365
Here's to the good stuff.

925
01:11:08,444 --> 01:11:10,207
That's my little Ricky.

926
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:12,907
And here's to the baddest...

927
01:11:12,982 --> 01:11:16,975
most awful, rank-smelling,
evil bad guy of 'em all.

928
01:11:17,053 --> 01:11:20,648
That's the nicest thing
anybody ever said to me.

929
01:11:20,723 --> 01:11:23,954
No.
He meant me, capisce?

930
01:11:25,027 --> 01:11:29,157
You? You eat grandmas
and little girls.

931
01:11:29,231 --> 01:11:31,165
What's bad about that?

932
01:11:32,435 --> 01:11:34,369
Okay, we made it in.

933
01:11:34,437 --> 01:11:36,667
We got past the wolves.
What now?

934
01:11:36,739 --> 01:11:39,401
Here's the plan.
You guys fix the scales.

935
01:11:39,475 --> 01:11:41,670
I'm gonna get the staff
away from Frieda.

936
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:46,072
Will this be before
or after I faint?

937
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:49,617
You aren't gonna get away with this.

938
01:11:49,685 --> 01:11:51,619
You can't just take over.

939
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:53,746
This isn't the way
things were meant to be.

940
01:11:53,823 --> 01:11:56,417
Quit dreaming, Cindy.

941
01:11:57,126 --> 01:12:00,653
I'm having
a real problem with this.

942
01:12:02,632 --> 01:12:07,968
I'm concerned about the effect this
violence is gonna have on little Reggie.

943
01:12:08,037 --> 01:12:09,971
That wasn't violence.

944
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:12,599
This is violence!

945
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:15,600
- Frieda, over here!
- What?

946
01:12:15,678 --> 01:12:17,145
Rick!

947
01:12:18,881 --> 01:12:20,940
Don't hurt him!

948
01:12:21,017 --> 01:12:22,348
Ella!

949
01:12:24,687 --> 01:12:26,177
"Don't hurt him"?

950
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:30,122
Ella likes the dishwasher.

951
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:33,891
- You again?
- Oh, no!

952
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:43,564
Well, well. Cinderella.

953
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,473
Kiss your little pumpkin good-bye!

954
01:12:52,715 --> 01:12:53,704
Rick!

955
01:12:53,783 --> 01:12:55,910
I've got you, Ella!

956
01:12:57,653 --> 01:12:59,746
I won't let you go!

957
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:02,848
You should have just
married the dishwasher.

958
01:13:02,925 --> 01:13:04,620
He's so much cuter.

959
01:13:05,995 --> 01:13:07,257
Bye-bye!

960
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:12,423
Ella, grab him!

961
01:13:17,873 --> 01:13:20,933
Wow! Did you see that?

962
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:23,604
I did something dangerous
and heroic and -

963
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:26,671
Hey, why didn't anyone stop me?

964
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:30,613
Seriously, if you ever see me about
to do something like that again...

965
01:13:30,686 --> 01:13:32,176
just knock me out.

966
01:13:32,254 --> 01:13:35,382
Like, punch!
End of story.

967
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:36,948
Thank you, Rick.

968
01:13:39,662 --> 01:13:44,622
Guys?
Does Frieda still have the staff?

969
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,190
Dang.

970
01:13:51,707 --> 01:13:53,368
Miss me?

971
01:13:53,442 --> 01:13:55,433
You'll live to regret that.

972
01:13:55,511 --> 01:13:57,809
But not for long.

973
01:13:58,547 --> 01:14:00,811
Good-bye, Ella.

974
01:14:01,884 --> 01:14:03,078
Rick!

975
01:14:06,522 --> 01:14:08,786
- Rick!
- Don't move!

976
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:13,722
You just had to go
for your happy ending.

977
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:16,560
- Well, let me tell you.
- No sleeping! No sleeping!

978
01:14:16,632 --> 01:14:18,793
This is your end...

979
01:14:18,868 --> 01:14:21,928
but it ain't gonna be happy!

980
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:27,340
I'm gonna show you that dreams
don't come true.

981
01:14:28,911 --> 01:14:31,505
For years I've been letting you
ruin my life!

982
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:33,070
Well, no more!

983
01:14:33,149 --> 01:14:37,415
What life? The life you were gonna have
with Sleeping Beauty over there?

984
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:44,253
The dishwasher
and the scullery maid!

985
01:14:44,326 --> 01:14:47,352
You're gonna live
happily never after!

986
01:14:48,764 --> 01:14:51,426
Ella! Push her into the portal!

987
01:14:56,539 --> 01:14:57,801
The staff!

988
01:15:01,977 --> 01:15:05,879
- Oops.
- You're not gonna need it anymore.

989
01:15:16,692 --> 01:15:18,557
She's gone.

990
01:15:19,628 --> 01:15:21,858
Nice punch, Ella.

991
01:15:23,299 --> 01:15:24,857
Rick!

992
01:15:31,373 --> 01:15:33,102
You're okay!

993
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:38,940
Hang on a second.

994
01:15:39,014 --> 01:15:41,574
I thought you wanted a prince.

995
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:45,017
I had one all along.
I just didn't know it.

996
01:15:48,123 --> 01:15:52,253
Like I always say,
good triumphs over evil.

997
01:15:52,328 --> 01:15:54,888
Isn't that so, precious sugar pie?

998
01:15:56,999 --> 01:15:58,967
How do you like that?

999
01:15:59,034 --> 01:16:02,265
It looks like Cinderella
got her happy ending after all.

1000
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:05,129
Not an ending...

1001
01:16:05,207 --> 01:16:06,697
a beginning.

1002
01:16:10,913 --> 01:16:13,541
Well, let's get
this place cleaned up.

1003
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:16,377
Before the boss gets home.

1004
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:24,221
So there you go.

1005
01:16:24,293 --> 01:16:27,262
Maybe it's not the Cinderella
tale you're used to...

1006
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:30,059
but, personally,
I like this one better.

1007
01:16:36,739 --> 01:16:39,367
Look, the prince even got
to save the day in the end.

1008
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:44,836
Well, at least that's
what he thinks.

1009
01:16:54,523 --> 01:16:56,457
And Rumpelstiltskin?

1010
01:16:56,525 --> 01:16:58,959
- Well -
- Open up.

1011
01:16:59,828 --> 01:17:01,625
He's "Uncle Rumpy" now.

1012
01:17:05,434 --> 01:17:07,595
By the time
the wizard came back...

1013
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:09,763
Munk and Mambo had cleaned
everything up.

1014
01:17:09,838 --> 01:17:11,465
Are we ready?

1015
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,440
And Fairytale Land
was back to normal.

1016
01:17:20,482 --> 01:17:22,746
Man, I can't believe it.

1017
01:17:22,818 --> 01:17:25,787
3-iron into the short grass,
perfect chip shot...

1018
01:17:25,854 --> 01:17:27,788
and I blow my last putt.

1019
01:17:27,856 --> 01:17:29,346
Triple bogey.

1020
01:17:32,328 --> 01:17:35,559
- Any problems?
- Problems? No. No problems.

1021
01:17:35,631 --> 01:17:38,099
Come on. Everything went
pretty smooth.

1022
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:42,729
Oh, yes.
Every story had an ending.

1023
01:17:44,006 --> 01:17:45,940
Good.

1024
01:17:46,008 --> 01:17:49,671
But I gotta say, this is my
favorite part ofthe story.

1025
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:53,512
I guess an ordinary guy
can get a happy ending.

1026
01:17:53,582 --> 01:17:55,243
Pretty nice, huh?

1027
01:17:55,317 --> 01:17:57,182
And you know who
paid for everything?

1028
01:17:57,252 --> 01:18:01,348
The prince.
He's not such a bad guy after all.

1029
01:18:04,493 --> 01:18:07,587
So what does "happily
ever after" really mean?

1030
01:18:08,597 --> 01:18:10,155
Beats me.

1031
01:18:10,232 --> 01:18:14,396
But, you know,
I think we're gonna find out.

1032
01:19:20,903 --> 01:19:22,803
Back! Back!

1033
01:19:22,871 --> 01:19:25,362
Bad creature!
And back, you!

1034
01:19:26,942 --> 01:19:28,807
All of you, get back!

1035
01:19:31,313 --> 01:19:34,646
I 'm the empress of evil!

1036
01:28:25,447 --> 01:28:26,971
Yeah, yeah!
