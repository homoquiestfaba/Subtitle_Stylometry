00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,964
WOMAN: Composer?

00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,426
MAN: I am not,
uh, Irving Berlin.

00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,929
More classical than that.
No, I am not Berlioz.

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,097
WOMAN: Another one.

00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,349
MAN: I am not Brahms.

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,850
Are you a famous
New York conductor?

00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,310
No, I am
not Leonard Bernstein.

00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:42,811
Are you
a famous murderer?

00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,272
Good try.
I am not Lizzie Borden.

00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:46,773
I hope you stump him,
darling,

00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,942
because
I am running out of B's.

00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:54,322
All right. Are you a well-known,
18th-century English jurist?

00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:54,948
A typical
lawyer's question, Burt.

00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,909
No, I am not
Sir William Blackstone. Cynthia?

00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,411
I pass.

00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,163
You know, every time we play
Botticelli with you,

00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:02,705
I feel
like a dropout.

00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:06,251
Do I see the flutter
of white flags?

00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,086
Go ahead.
Tell us who it is.

00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,129
No, no, no. Please.
Let's keep guessing.

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,922
BURT:
We'll be here all night.

00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,216
Come on, Ray.

00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,300
It's very simple.
Josef Breuer.

00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,051
Who?

00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,887
Breuer. He and Freud
coauthored Studies on Hysteria.

00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,432
That's unfair, Dr. Flemming
You're a psychiatrist.

00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,643
You should have picked
someone everyone knew.

00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,102
Well, like who, honey?

00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,479
Last time
we played the game

00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,315
you were stumped
by Alexander Graham Bell.

00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:29,858
Has my husband finished

00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,735
dazzling you
with his intelligence?

00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,988
Because I have
a little surprise for everyone.

00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,781
Everyone ready?

00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,158
( mouthing )

00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,088
( all gasp )

00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,507
Henri at the Denise
found out

00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,134
about our anniversary,
he insisted.

00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,137
I insist we get at this
while it's cold.

00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,264
Oh, how marvelous.

00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,225
I think
a toast is in order...

00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,644
to our host and hostess

00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,980
on the 1Oth anniversary
of their horrible mistake.

00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,565
Oh!

00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,901
You'd better
rephrase that, counselor.

00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,527
Pleasure,
Your Honor...

00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,112
to the two finest people
I ever knew.

00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,198
Here's to 10 more years
of happiness.

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,325
( guests applauding )

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,623
( telephone ringing )

00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,416
Excuse me.

00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,710
Bubbly, anybody?

00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,964
Hello.

00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,009
Now?

00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,469
Can't it wait?

00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,806
We're having
a party here.

00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,895
All right,
I'll be there as soon as I can.

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,150
Believe me, anything
Henri chooses is superb.

00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,945
He's got the best
wine cellar in town.

00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,616
Excuse me.
Excuse me, dear.

00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,247
What is it, darling?

00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,207
It's a patient,
I'm afraid I have to leave.

00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:09,916
This is our anniversary.

00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,419
But it's an emergency.
He's having an anxiety attack.

00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,505
You're not
a family doctor.

00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,172
You don't have to go
chasing off

00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,092
every time somebody
runs out of tranquilizers.

00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,677
Darling, we've been
through this before.

00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,387
I won't allow you to leave.
We have guests.

00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,514
And they shouldn't see us
arguing, should they?

00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,056
Now, make my excuses.

00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,767
I'll try to get back
before they leave.

00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,692
( door opens, closes )

00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,789
Do you love me?

00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,043
How much?

00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,712
This much.

00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,980
Well, actually,
I should be strangling you.

00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:14,981
Why?

00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,274
You know
I was giving a party.

00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,192
I had to see you.

00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,154
When I'm alone,
I don't know, I...

00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,239
I get confused.

00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,074
Second thoughts?

00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,576
A few.

00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,753
( sighs )

00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:40,256
It's a natural reaction
under the circumstances.

00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,759
I keep wishing
there was some other way.

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,302
There isn't.

00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,346
But if you talked to her,
if I talked to her.

00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,183
Joan, don't be naive.

00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,559
We have one alternative.

00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,895
We decided that
a long time ago.

00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,313
It's funny.

00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,273
I can't even picture
what she looks like.

00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,858
Are we really so different?

00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:00,818
Completely.

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,531
All right, I'm younger
than she is, I'm prettier.

00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,993
But, uh, she's probably
more intelligent than I am.

00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,953
Mm-hmm.

00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,623
It's a kind
of destructive intelligence.

00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,250
Why me?
What have I got to offer?

00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,835
A typical actress,

00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,171
too many bit parts
and too much ambition.

00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,548
I like ambition.

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,592
For all the good
it's done me.

00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,218
It brought you to me,
didn't it?

00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,929
( chuckles )

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,305
With my nails gnawed off
and every neurosis in the book.

00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,266
I was in great shape,
wasn't I?

00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,394
It's not
a bad shape at all.

00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,562
Ray.
<b></b>
Yeah.

00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,192
Ray, you do love me,
don't you?

00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,402
Very much.

00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,874
I won't disappoint you
tomorrow.

00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,583
I never thought
you would.

00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,931
( door closes )

00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,445
I didn't think
you'd be up.

00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,537
Don't bother to undress.

00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,705
You're sleeping
in the guest room.

00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,247
I've turned down the bed.

00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,875
Carol.

00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,335
I think you should know
I'm calling my lawyers

00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,296
in the morning.

00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,797
It's been a long day.

00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,674
Do we have to start
on that again?

00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,720
You'll have to indulge me
just this one last time, dearie.

00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:54,307
It's lucky for you I'm too
well-bred to throw a tantrum.

00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,516
All right. Fire away.

00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:59,061
Six months ago
I gave you a choice...

00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,023
between me and your...

00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,442
( groans )

00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,402
How shall I put it?

00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,446
Extracurricular activity.

00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,155
I made that choice.

00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:14,952
I wanted a husband in fact,
not just in appearance.

00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,413
If you refused,

00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,832
I'd divorce you.

00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,876
There was a catch
to that, as I recall.

00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,670
Well, naturally,
you don't think

00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,338
I'm going to make it
easy for you?

00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,382
I'd create as much scandal
as I possibly could

00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,511
and ruin your
practice entirely.

00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,429
Aside from taking every penny
that I've got.

00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,599
Those were my terms.

00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,645
You accepted them
until tonight.

00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,522
Carol,
none of this is necessary.

00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,775
I told you,
I was with a patient.

00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,359
Till 1:00
in the morning?

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,444
What are you doing,
giving discount rates?

00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,404
On my way home
I dropped by to see Dr. Cobb.

00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,698
He was the referral
psychoanalyst,

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,034
and we discussed
the case.

00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,328
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,037
Well, call him.

00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,707
What's that going to prove?
He's a friend of yours.

00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,959
Well, his wife
is a friend of yours.

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,293
Talk to her.

00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,976
( picks handset, dialing )

00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,939
Hang up. Hang up.

00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,692
I haven't seen Cobb
for two weeks.

00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,491
Then you've been
lying to me.

00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,243
Oh, but not
the way you think.

00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,668
Well, I guess
the game's up.

00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,507
I stopped by the hospital
to see Dr. Rosales.

00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,759
We talked about the trip

00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,594
you and I were going
to take to Acapulco.

00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:58,681
Acapulco?

00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,058
Yeah.
We leave tomorrow night.

00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,520
Well, I thought we could use
a couple of days in the sun,

00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,606
just you and me.

00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,900
Happy anniversary,
darling.

00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,903
Oh, Ray, darling.

00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,532
That's why I stopped in
to see Rosales.

00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,492
He's from Mexico,
and I thought maybe

00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,495
he could fill me in
on what to do

00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,248
when we got there.

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,876
Why didn't you tell me?

00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,335
Well, I was saving it
for breakfast.

00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,629
I wanted it
to be a surprise.

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,131
And I almost ruined it.

00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,091
Oh, darling.

00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,553
Say, you're going to have
a big day tomorrow.

00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,930
Why don't you
get some sleep?

00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:42,725
I think
I'll read for a while.

00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:48,648
Ray?

00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,588
You can go in now,
Miss Hudson.

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,798
Thank you.

00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,473
Oh, darling,
you're tense.

00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,641
A little.

00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,602
Did you get
any sleep last night?

00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,728
No.
Well, maybe an hour or two.

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,363
Take one of these
when you get home.

00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,197
What are they?

00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,740
Sleeping pills.

00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,492
I want you to get
some rest this afternoon.

00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,243
Can't. I'm working.

00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:46,330
This is an odd time to be
pursuing your career, isn't it?

00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,498
How many chances do I get?

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,042
It's a good part.

00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,128
Let's concentrate on the part
you're playing tonight.

00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:57,717
You think it'll fit?

00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,636
Might be a little big.

00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,639
Noticeably?

00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,057
No.
I don't think so.

00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,976
Shall I take it home
with me?

00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,478
No, I don't want you wearing it
until it's necessary.

00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,731
Now, this photograph
is the best one I have of her.

00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,316
In the others, she's
standing off in the distance

00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,610
or wearing sunglasses.

00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,821
Notice the makeup.

00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,323
She uses
a heavy eyebrow pencil.

00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,950
What about the wig?

00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,952
I'll get it from the studio
makeup department today.

00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,287
They'll never know
it's missing.

00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:26,871
Good.

00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,248
You take that along
with you as reference,

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,000
but be sure
you bring it back tonight.

00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,628
Now
what about the timing?

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,215
I'll be
at your apartment at 9:00.

00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,425
But no sooner.

00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,722
And how do you get there?
Car?

00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,641
You're testing me.

00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,018
Do you mind?

00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,229
No, I suppose we both
have to be sure about things.

00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,692
I won't drive.
I'll come by bus.

00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,029
I'll get off
a few blocks away and walk.

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,571
Right.

00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,990
Use the back entrance
to the garage,

00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,284
then take
the service elevator.

00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,786
Apartment number?

00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,580
You're in the penthouse.
I ring the bell twice.

00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,499
Anything else?

00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,752
Joan?

00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,628
The sunglasses.

00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,880
Good girl.

00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,382
And a large purse
for the dress.

00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,259
Are you sure of everything?
Shall I do it over again?

00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,136
No, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,056
Ah, but it'll be fine.
I promise you.

00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:27,807
Just pretend
you're working on a role,

00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,142
right down to the props.

00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,155
I'll see you tonight.

00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,575
10:00.
Thank you very much.

00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,703
The plane's leaving
on schedule.

00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,996
Then you'd better hurry.

00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,290
Oh, darling,
let's not rush.

00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,040
Here, let me
help you with that.

00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,795
You're a brilliant man,
but you're not very mechanical.

00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,630
That's what
wives are for.

00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,882
That,
and other things.

00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,468
Burt Gordon called today.

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,970
Anything important?

00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,680
No, just to wish us
a pleasant trip.

00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,515
He could use
a vacation himself.

00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,517
You know he's prosecuting
two new cases next month?

00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,228
Well, that's what he gets
for having political ambitions.

00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,648
Do you remember him
when he was in law school?

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,442
Vaguely.

00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,986
I never saw anybody work
so hard, including you.

00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,989
But I didn't have to.
My wife had a rich father.

00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,325
And you married me
for my money.

00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,784
Not yours, darling.
Your father's.

00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,786
I like to think you
loved me a little.

00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,664
Didn't you?
<b></b>
Of course I did.

00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,082
Yes.

00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,752
Is the maid
coming tomorrow?

00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,503
Well,
as far as I know.

00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,880
Well, why don't you
give her a call and check?

00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,840
Sometimes she forgets.

00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,343
All right.

00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,762
Oh, say,
did you see my blue dress?

00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:30,930
My blue wool?
<b></b>
What?

00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,681
My blue wool dress.

00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,974
I was going to
take it on the trip,

00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,684
but I can't
find it anywhere.

00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,186
Maybe you sent it
to the cleaners.

00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,103
Oh, no.
It should be in the closet.

00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:38,854
Where's that address book?

00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,980
Ah!

00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,491
( humming )

00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,634
Charlotte?
This is Mrs. Flemming.

00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,344
I just wanted to be sure
you'd be in tomorrow.

00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,055
Good.

00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:13,973
Oh, and don't forget
to water the plants, huh?

00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,226
You've got your key,
huh?

00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,478
Good.

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:19,853
Oh, yes.
We will.

00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,398
Thank you very much. Bye.

00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,741
She's coming in at 10:00!

00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,243
Good!

00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,296
Drink, darling?

00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,591
No.
Set it down, would you?

00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,887
Such a beautiful
night, isn't it?

00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,098
I hadn't noticed.

00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,686
Perfect weather for flying.
You can see for miles.

00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,315
Do you know
what I was thinking?

00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:05,858
What?

00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,777
When we get back,
we must redecorate.

00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,532
The place looks cold.
It should have warmer colors.

00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,827
Maybe we should buy
some paintings of soup cans.

00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,245
If you think so.

00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,621
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,874
Oh, we're gonna have
such a wonderful time

00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,127
the next few days.

00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,756
Does your secretary
know where you're going?

00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,507
Only that
we're in Mexico.

00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,884
No specifics.

00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,554
Good.
Complete privacy.

00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:40,392
We're going to have a nice,
quiet weekend.

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,855
You'd better
close the doors,

00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,191
then change.

00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,693
Oh?

00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,781
Our second honeymoon
may be better than our first.

00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,418
( phone ringing )

00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,194
( body hitting floor )

00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,738
( phone continues ringing )

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,166
Hello.

00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,001
Oh, hello, Burt.
How are you?

00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,296
Oh, yeah.
Carol told me you called.

00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,007
Oh, fine, fine.
We're just leaving.

00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:58,011
Oh, no. She's, uh...
She's dressing.

00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,222
Yes. I'll tell her.

00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:00,722
I'd better be
going now, Burt.

00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,892
Give our love to
Cynthia, will you?

00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,227
Right.

00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,938
( doorbell chimes )

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:36,211
Joan?
Did anyone see you come up?

00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,255
There's a drink on the bar.
Take it.

00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,382
No. I--
<b></b>
Take it.

00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,134
And I want you
to wear these gloves.

00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,760
Don't. Please.

00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,554
I don't need a drink.
I'll be all right.

00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,098
Be careful
not to touch anything.

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,641
Did you bring
the photograph?

00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,228
The wig?

00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,064
And some shoes
to go with the dress.

00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,691
Very good.

00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,614
Put this on.
Come on. Get ready.

00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,440
It looks fine.

00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,692
Hmm.
It won't fool anybody.

00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,360
Oh, don't be negative.

00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,362
Suppose we meet someone
who knows your wife?

00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,822
I don't even look like her.

00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:09,364
People see
what they expect to see.

00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,200
It's the principle
of association.

00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,286
You're dressed like Carol.
You're traveling with me.

00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,704
That means
you are my wife.

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,290
Are we ready?

00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,041
Not yet.
Make your call to the cleaners.

00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,799
What are you waiting for?

00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,301
Well, won't they be closed
this time of night?

00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,970
They're open
till midnight.

00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,516
( picks handset, dialing )

00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,283
Rodeo Cleaners?

00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,243
This is...

00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,622
This is Mrs. Flemming,

00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,124
Cumberland Apartments
on Wilshire.

00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,418
I have a bundle of laundry
and some things to clean.

00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,378
It'll be
outside the door.

00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,714
I'm leaving it
outside the door.

00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,257
Will you have
someone pick it up

00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,926
first thing
in the morning?

00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,345
Thank you.

00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,638
Fine.
The sunglasses.

00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,476
Where are they?

00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,103
I know I had them.

00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,273
Good.

00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,818
Now, put these on.

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,362
Why?

00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,863
She always wore them
with that dress.

00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,962
When you get back
from the airport,

00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,505
add the dress
and the gloves to that bundle.

00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,132
What about the wig?

00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,386
I'll return it Monday.
No one will know I have it.

00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,388
Fine.
Are you ready?

00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,348
( shuddering breath )

00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,350
I think so.

00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,893
Let's get started.

00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,276
Light.

00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,953
Dr. And Mrs. Ray Flemming,
ticketed on 12A.

00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,165
Thank you.

00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,125
Afraid you're 13 pounds
overweight, doctor.

00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,629
Put it on my credit card,
would you?

00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,465
( Phone Rings, Distant )

00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,425
( stamps imprinter )

00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,385
Mrs. Flemming?

00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,428
Carol.

00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,387
Mrs. Flemming?

00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,097
Yes.

00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,432
Will you be carrying
any hand luggage aboard?

00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,975
No.

00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:24,643
Will you sign here,
please, doctor?

00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,486
Thank you very much.

00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,862
That'll be at Gate 35,

00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,821
boarding in about
3 minutes.

00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:40,575
Have a pleasant trip,
sir.

00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,911
Thank you.

00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,625
WOMAN: ( on PA )
Flight number 12A

00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,670
for Acapulco is in
the final boarding process

00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,838
at Gate number 35.

00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,422
Passengers having reservations

00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,384
for this flight
should be on board.

00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,553
May I have your names,
please?

00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,347
Dr. And Mrs. Flemming.

00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:02,806
All right.

00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,599
Um, Aisle 3,
Seats A and B.

00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,018
Thank you.

00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,703
Remember.

00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,829
Don't call or try to
get in touch with me.

00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,497
I'll reach you.

00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,998
When will I see you?

00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,543
Oh, not for a while.
At least a week.

00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,169
Ray, I'm worried.

00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,796
Well, don't be.
Just try to get some rest.

00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,715
And don't read the papers.
They'll upset you.

00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,551
Shall we get started?

00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,970
What should I say?

00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,972
You're an actress, darling.
Improvise.

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,309
If you feel that way,
why'd you agree to come along?

00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,520
That's a good question.
I really don't know.

00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,731
You never wanted to take
this trip in the first place.

00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,940
JOAN: Can you blame me?

00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:54,524
What am I supposed to do,

00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,110
sit in our room
while you go fishing?

00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,528
Maybe you'd
rather not go at all.

00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,155
Maybe I wouldn't.

00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:00,572
Fine, spend the weekend
with your friends

00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,991
and run up
a nice bar bill.

00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,701
Leave my friends
out of this.

00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,660
Will you lower your voice?
People are listening.

00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,163
I don't care
who's listening.

00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,581
I wasn't the one
that started this.

00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,832
You're making a scene.

00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,542
This is impossible.

00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,877
What do you think
you're doing?

00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,003
Isn't it obvious?
I'm leaving.

00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:15,462
Carol, don't be a fool.

00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,006
Have they shut
the door yet?

00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:18,590
No, ma'am,
but we're just about to.

00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,884
Enjoy yourself.

00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,302
I'm sure you'll have
a better time without me.

00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,263
Carol!

00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,808
Is there anything
I can do, sir?

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,768
No.
Let her go.

00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,408
( plane engine powering up )

00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,697
Miguel, why don't you
fix us some lunch?

00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,490
I'm starving.

00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,345
( splashes )

00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,080
Dr. Flemming?

00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,213
Who are you?

00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,925
Lieutenant Columbo.
Police.

00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,927
I don't understand.

00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,805
What's happened here?
Where's my wife?

00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,223
Maybe you better sit down.

00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,891
I've got some
bad news for you.

00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,477
Has something
happened to Carol?

00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,145
You sure you don't
want to sit down?

00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,899
Has she been
in an accident?

00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,735
Not exactly.

00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,779
Well, what is it?
Tell me.

00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,365
Well, um...

00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,617
Somebody broke in here
and tried to kill her.

00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,131
"Tried" to kill her?

00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,300
That's right, doctor.
She's lucky she's still alive.

00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,972
She's still alive?
Where is she now?

00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,932
She's at the hospital.

00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,143
You're sure
you don't want a drink...

00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,436
water, brandy
or something?

00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,979
Oh, no, no.

00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:43,563
I want to know how she is.
Is she conscious?

00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,941
Has she been able to--
to say anything?

00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,902
Well, I'm afraid not.
She's been in a coma.

00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,405
What's her condition
right now?

00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,909
Oh, come on.
I must know the truth.

00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,412
It's not very good,
doctor.

00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,955
We only hope that she
comes to long enough

00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,791
to be able to talk to us.

00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,626
Well, I've got
to see her.

00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,296
Doctor, uh, don't you think
you ought to rest awhile?

00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,797
After all, it's been
quite a shock.

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,091
Well, you can understand.
My wife's in the hospital.

00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,553
She may be dying.
I want to see her.

00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,806
All right.
Uh, I've got a car downstairs.

00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,727
( phone ringing )

00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,521
No, I don't want
to talk to anyone now.

00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,650
Might be the hospital, doc.
They know I'm here.

00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,411
Hello.
This is Dr. Flemming.

00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,163
Darling, I just
had to talk to you.

00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:42,789
The newspapers...

00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,000
No, I--I can't keep any
appointments today.

00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,294
Why don't you come
in Friday at 2:00?

00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,962
My secretary will verify it.

00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,757
Ray, is there
someone with you?

00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,014
They expect me to be
on call at all hours.

00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,433
Same with me, doc.

00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,902
Nurse, I'm Dr. Flemming.
My wife is a patient here.

00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,445
I'd like to see her.

00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,367
I'm afraid
she's on the critical list.

00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,993
She's not permitted
to have any visitors.

00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,453
But, miss,
I am a doctor.

00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,038
I'm sorry,
but my orders are--

00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,832
Is Dr. Lansberry
still chief of staff here?

00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,291
Yes.

00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,918
Will you tell him
that Dr. Ray Flemming

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,002
is here
and would like to see him.

00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,713
He may be
in surgery, doctor.

00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,048
But you wouldn't know that
unless you checked.

00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,633
Would you mind?

00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,890
Dr. Lansberry, please.
Reception.

00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:47,103
There's a Dr. Flemming here.
He insists on seeing his wife.

00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,980
Yes. Thank you.

00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,898
He's being paged,
doctor.

00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,150
Thank you.

00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,237
Hospital red tape.

00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,406
Yeah, I know
what you mean, doctor.

00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,949
Well,
let's get on with it.

00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,950
WOMAN: ( on PA )
Dr. Lansberry...

00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,160
Get on with what?

00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,452
Your red tape.

00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,998
This, um, this thief,
did he leave any traces?

00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,750
Oh, no.
No, not a thing.

00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,086
But of course, uh, we might be
able to run him down

00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:12,670
when he tries to sell
the stuff he stole.

00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:16,549
We can't be sure,
but, uh, we think maybe

00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,134
he stole
some of your wife's jewelry

00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:18,676
and some other things.

00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,596
Listen, doc,
when you get a chance,

00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,014
would you make out
a list of what was stolen?

00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,140
Of course.
<b></b>
Yeah.

00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,559
And then we can, uh...

00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,143
We check with the fences
and the pawnshops.

00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:30,104
And who knows?
Something might turn up.

00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,065
Oh, a few questions
for my report, doc.

00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,525
Now, uh...

00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,110
WOMAN: ( on PA )
Dr. Miller...

00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:36,652
You were in Mexico
when this thing took place,

00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:41,115
and, uh,
the dates there were, um...

00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,201
Gee, you don't
have a pencil, do you?

00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,747
Thanks.

00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,415
You know, my wife,
she gives me one every morning,

00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,168
and I just can't
seem to hold on to it.

00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,669
Uh.
Oh, yes.

00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,379
Now we know that
you were in Mexico,

00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,590
but, uh,
the local police down there,

00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,008
they couldn't
seem to locate you.

00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,551
Oh, yes.

00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:05,556
I was in a little village
about 20 miles from Acapulco.

00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,100
It was very quiet
and relaxing

00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,185
and hardly
any telephones.

00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,645
Uh-huh. Yeah.

00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,313
WOMAN: ( on PA )
Dr. Lansberry,

00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,189
call reception desk,
please.

00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,482
Yeah.

00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,651
I, um,
I suppose you...

00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,318
you know about
what happened on the plane.

00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,821
Yeah. Yeah.

00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,324
We talked with the--
with the airline people.

00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,409
And they told us that
you and your wife checked in.

00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,077
Well, boy,
that really threw us.

00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,120
But then, of course,
we contacted the stewardess

00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:32,083
and she explained
what happened.

00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,335
Yes.
It was my fault.

00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,878
We had an argument
on the plane.

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,171
It was
something ridiculous.

00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:41,342
I never thought
that she'd actually leave.

00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,762
Yeah, she probably went home
and went right to bed.

00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,390
I guess the attack
was close to midnight.

00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,350
I mean, we know that she was
at the airport at 10:00.

00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,727
Dr. Woods,
call your office.

00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,437
Lieutenant, if there's

00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,189
any further way that I can be
of assistance to you...

00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:55,898
Oh, no. No. No.

00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,027
You just make out that list.
That would be fine, doc.

00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,445
Thank you.

00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,573
Oh, oh, one more thing,
before I forget.

00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,117
I had to borrow
a photograph the other day.

00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,076
I hope you don't mind.

00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,703
A photograph?

00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,538
Yeah, a picture
of you and your wife.

00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,081
We had to have something
to show the stewardess.

00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,082
For identification.

00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,876
I see.

00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,211
She was still out of town,
but we contacted her by phone,

00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,423
and, uh, we sent
the picture down by wirephoto.

00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,344
And?

00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,053
She identified your wife.

00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:29,307
The picture wasn't too clear,
but she recognized her.

00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,309
Ray.

00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,187
I was hoping to find you here.
Are you all right?

00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,857
I'm holding up,
I suppose.

00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,233
I just don't know what to say.
It's terrible.

00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,986
Why, we just saw her
at your party.

00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,195
I know.

00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,989
Now what happened
on Friday?

00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,574
When I called, the two of you
were getting ready to leave.

00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:47,158
We had an argument
on the plane.

00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,285
Suddenly, Carol decided
she wasn't going,

00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,454
and she walked off.

00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,955
I shouldn't
have let her.

00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,332
Well, you can't
blame yourself.

00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,875
How could you
possibly have known?

00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,669
Thanks.

00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,129
Have you heard
anything yet?

00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,173
Not yet, doctor.

00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,841
Lieutenant Columbo.

00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,259
My name's Gordon.

00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,927
I'm with the district
attorney's office.

00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,095
Yes, sir. I know.

00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,430
I appreciate it.

00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,681
Anything you can do
for Dr. Flemming.

00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,807
He's a good friend
of mine.

00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,225
I'll try.

00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,561
Ray, we're going
to find the man

00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,229
that is responsible
for this

00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,731
as soon as
Carol gets better

00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,065
and can give us
a full description.

00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,901
Oh, and by the way,

00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,570
Cynthia wants you to spend
the next few days with us.

00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,237
Let me think about it,
will you?

00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,238
I understand.

00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,491
Dr. Flemming?

00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,201
Dr. Lansberry
on the phone.

00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,578
Hello, doctor.

00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,288
There's something
I want you to do for me.

00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,165
Uh, any, uh...

00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,834
Any progress so far?

00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,294
Dr. Miller,
call the switchboard, please.

00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,713
Well, it's, uh,
still a little early,

00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,590
but, uh, you know,
sooner or later

00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,424
something usually breaks.

00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,510
Mm-hmm.

00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,511
Well, let's make that
"sooner,"

00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,221
right, lieutenant?

00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,555
Try my best.

00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,140
Yeah.
I'm sure you will.

00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,225
I don't think
I have to remind you

00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,684
that this could be...

00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,269
quite the little feather
in your cap.

00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:02,233
Wrap it up,
and everybody's happy.

00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:05,194
Lieutenant?

00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,654
Um, yeah, I'm sorry.

00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,155
I was, uh...

00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,198
I was just thinking
about something.

00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,533
What was that?

00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,826
No.
It's nothing important.

00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,410
It's, uh...

00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,328
Dr. Flemming,
he didn't call to his wife

00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,373
when he came back
to his apartment.

00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,333
I don't follow you.

00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,626
Oh.
Well, I was in the bedroom.

00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,168
I was checking
some things,

00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,421
and I heard him
open the front door,

00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,130
and he didn't say anything.

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,299
Gee, it's funny how people
are different, isn't it?

00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,717
Now you take myself,

00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,302
when I come home
from a trip, uh,

00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,304
the first thing
I do is I say,

00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,765
"Honey, you here?"

00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,685
Exactly what is
your point, lieutenant?

00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,311
Point?
Oh, I wasn't making a point.

00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,355
It sounded to me
as if you were.

00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,774
You heard the man admit

00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,401
that he had
an argument with his wife.

00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,194
He probably still had
a chip on his shoulder

00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,487
this morning.

00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,864
I was only trying to--
<b></b>
Lieutenant.

00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,657
I have
already told you that

00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,116
Dr. Flemming is a close,
personal friend of mine.

00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,827
Now I hope
he's not going to be

00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,328
annoyed by a lot
of tactless remarks,

00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,456
especially
at a time like this.

00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,207
Well, I'm sorry,
Mr. Gordon.

00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,918
I guess I shouldn't
have mentioned it.

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,129
Dr. Ferrell,
Surgery Four, please.

00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,213
RAY: Yes.

00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,381
Thank you, Dr. Lansberry.

00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,592
They're letting me go
up to see her.

00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,677
Good.
Do you need company?

00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,846
No.
I'd rather be with her alone.

00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,391
I'll have to go
with you, doc.

00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,685
Why?

00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,561
Well, we got
a man on the door.

00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,734
( elevator door opens )

00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,948
Uh, it's, uh...

00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,991
it's all right, officer.

00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,618
This is her husband.

00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,368
I'm sorry, lieutenant.
Nobody's allowed in right now.

00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,537
Well, why not?

00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,956
She's conscious.
The doctor's with her.

00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,212
Well,
maybe we got lucky.

00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,199
Oh, doctor,

00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,534
I'm the patient's husband.

00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,411
Is she--
Is she all right?

00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,372
I'm sorry.

00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,541
She passed away.

00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,551
Did she...
Did she say anything?

00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,972
If it's any consolation,

00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,057
the one thing
she said was your name.

00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,180
Getting some fresh air?

00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,351
I was on my way
back from lunch.

00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,811
Well,
as a matter of fact,

00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,521
I was headed toward
your office myself.

00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,898
Do you mind
if I walk along?

00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,608
Not at all.

00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,447
Any news?

00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,948
No.
Nothing much, doctor.

00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,617
We're just sort
of waiting around

00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,870
until our friend tries
to get rid of the jewelry.

00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:46,081
I'd imagine he'd hold on
to it for a while.

00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,625
Yeah, probably.

00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:53,047
Have I had any calls,
Miss Petrie?

00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:53,839
Five or six.
I left a list on your desk.

00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,843
First day back, and everyone
wants me to hold their hands.

00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,019
You know,
I've never been

00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,562
in a psychiatrist's
office before.

00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,814
First time.

00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:11,148
I keep looking
for the couch.

00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,068
So do my patients.

00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:14,693
I keep telling them
it's bad for their posture.

00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:18,280
"Bad for their posture."
That's very good.

00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,449
I'll tell you, you put me
in a horizontal position,

00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,992
and I fall asleep.

00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,411
Nice office, though.
It seems restful.

00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,998
I guess it, uh, puts people
in the mood to talk, huh?

00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,794
You know, my sister,
she has a living room.

00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,879
It's very, very modern.

00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,506
Well, the minute
you sit down there,

00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,466
you can't open your mouth.

00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,552
You know, she's got this big,
kidney-shaped coffee table.

00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,596
It upsets me
just to look at it.

00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,431
Her husband,
he doesn't say anything,

00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:48,811
and I figure, the coffee table
got to him years ago.

00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:51,480
Is there something
I can do for you?

00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,608
Oh, no.
Not really, doctor. No.

00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,112
I just came up to
bring back your pen.

00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,698
I forgot to give it
to you at the inquest.

00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,658
Well, thanks.
I missed it.

00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,618
You know, that's my trouble.
I got a bad memory.

00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,704
My wife tells me I ought to
have strings on all 10 fingers.

00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,375
Was there anything
else you wanted?

00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,835
Oh, no.
It's nothing important.

00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,586
There is one detail
that bothers me.

00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,130
And what is that?

00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,716
It's, um...
It's about your luggage.

00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,301
My luggage?

00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,512
( flicking lighter)

00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,638
I think you need
fluid here, huh?

00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,724
Oh, no. Maybe.

00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,936
Oh, there, boy,
that's quite a flame, huh?

00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,190
You were talking
about my luggage.

00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,026
Yeah.

00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,195
Uh, now, you took two
suitcases with you, didn't you?

00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,240
Well, actually, we packed
more than we needed.

00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,867
Well, I went out
to the airport the other day,

00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,493
you know,
just a routine check

00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,620
and it seems as though
you were 13 pounds overweight.

00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,290
You know,
they keep those records.

00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,625
Yes. I know.
I charged it on my credit card.

00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,086
Well,
when you came back--

00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,921
Now I know
it's a stupid point, doc,

00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,174
and it doesn't mean anything,
but you were only, uh,

00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,968
4 pounds overweight,
and I was wondering

00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,095
what happened
to the other 9 pounds.

00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,639
I don't see what that has
to do with my wife's death.

00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,516
Oh, it's all
part of the job.

00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,894
You know, just trying
to tie the loose ends together.

00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,856
You went
to a lot of trouble,

00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,858
didn't you, going
all the way out to the airport?

00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,442
Forty-five minutes.

00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:22,196
Boy, that's quite
a place, that airport.

00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,990
You know, I get lost
just walking around.

00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:25,532
Lieutenant,
about those 9 pounds,

00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,660
I took along a stack
of trade journals

00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,078
and medical magazines.

00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,579
It seems
I never get a chance

00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,290
to go through them
at the office.

00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,875
Oh, catching up
on your reading, then, huh?

00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,085
You might say that.

00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,379
And you didn't
bring them back, then?

00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,881
There'd be no reason to.

00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,382
It was mostly
advertising stuff.

00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:42,883
Mm-hmm.

00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,760
And, uh,
you figured they weighed

00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,803
as much as 9 pounds?

00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,013
Well, they'd have to.

00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:48,555
Why else
the weight discrepancy?

00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,016
Yeah.

00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:51,517
Well, I guess
that clears that up, then.

00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,685
Okay, doc.
Thank you very much.

00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,771
And I'm sorry
I bothered you.

00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,940
No bother at all.

00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,650
Oh, listen.
There's one more thing.

00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,318
Um, you don't remember

00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,112
what your wife was wearing
that night, do you?

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,157
Well, Carol had
so many dresses.

00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,492
Is it important?

00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,327
Well, yes.
In a way, it is.

00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,538
Well, let's see now.

00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,248
Oh, yes.

00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,708
She was wearing a blue wool
dress with brass buttons,

00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,293
if I'm not mistaken.

00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:18,794
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.

00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,213
That's what
the stewardess said.

00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:21,672
She's back in town,
by the way.

00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,174
And I spoke to her,
and, uh,

00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:24,758
she told me
your wife was wearing

00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:29,179
a blue wool dress
with blue kid gloves.

00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,473
Well, then
that's probably it.

00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,684
No.

00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,519
That's funny, though.

00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,187
If she came home
from the airport,

00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,772
what did she do
with the dress and gloves?

00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,983
When we went over your
apartment last week,

00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,609
we couldn't find them.

00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,694
Well, they may
have been stolen.

00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,446
Yeah. Maybe, maybe.

00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:50,200
Did you put those
on the list of stolen items?

00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:50,659
Really, lieutenant,
how could you expect me

00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,870
to notice
they were missing?

00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,747
Still, it's puzzling
when you think about it.

00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,624
I am...

00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,710
I mean, why would a guy steal
a dress and a pair of gloves?

00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,295
What are they worth?

00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,796
People don't always
do the rational thing.

00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,798
Oh, they sure don't.

00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,885
You learn a lot
about that in my line.

00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,720
Well, I guess
you do in yours too.

00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,722
Hmm.

00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:12,890
( intercom buzzes )

00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:13,348
Oh, excuse me.
Yeah?

00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,685
Miss Hudson is here,
doctor.

00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,311
I'll be through
in a moment.

00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,813
I have a patient
coming in now, lieutenant.

00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,815
Oh. Yeah.

00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,568
Hey, 2:00.

00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,195
Oh, that was the one that
called you at your apartment.

00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,615
Oh, and you say
you have a bad memory.

00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,115
Well, listen.

00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:30,908
It comes and it goes,
you know?

00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:35,037
I'm sorry I couldn't have been
any help to you with the dress

00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:35,704
and the gloves,
but, uh,

00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,498
well, maybe you just
missed them in your search.

00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:38,999
Yeah.

00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:39,791
Yeah, you're probably
right, doc.

00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:45,047
Uh, listen, um, would you mind
if I came over this afternoon

00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:45,672
and took another look?

00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,675
What time do you think
you're gonna be home?

00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,010
Not before 5:00.

00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,721
Well, suppose
I meet you there at 5:30.

00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,222
If you think
it's necessary.

00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,724
Well, it's just
another loose end.

00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,683
You understand.

00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,352
Hmm.

00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,814
You can go in now,
Miss Hudson.

00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,066
Thank you.

00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,319
Oh, miss.

00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,156
Excuse me, uh,
what was your name again?

00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,951
Joan Hudson. Why?

00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,578
Oh, sorry to trouble you,
ma'am.

00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,587
Who was that man
out there?

00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,048
Lieutenant Columbo.
He's a police officer. Why?

00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,758
He wanted
to know my name.

00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,926
Did you tell him?

00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,594
What else could I do?

00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,016
Ray,
is something wrong?

00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,643
Well, he was with me
when you called.

00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,268
I told you not to try
to get in touch with me.

00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,270
I had to.

00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:42,604
When I read that
Carol was still alive,

00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,065
I wanted to warn you.

00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,108
Well,
don't worry about it.

00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:46,692
As far as he knows,

00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,319
you're just another
patient on my list.

00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,447
Now...

00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,867
Now I am going to call
the cleaners.

00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,788
You did as I told you,
didn't you?

00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,331
You left Carol's
dress and gloves

00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,583
with the rest
of the laundry?

00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,835
Gloves?

00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:05,919
Yes, dress and gloves.

00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,505
Well, you know, Joan.
I told you.

00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,632
( dialing phone )

00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,679
( stops dialing )

00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,390
What is it?

00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,935
Well, I changed
in the restroom at the airport

00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,021
and put her things
in my bag.

00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,441
Then I went back
to your apartment

00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,569
and left the dress
with the other laundry.

00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,240
Go on.

00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,783
Well, I forgot
about the gloves.

00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:40,037
I didn't even think of them
until you mentioned them.

00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:40,537
But we went over it.

00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,749
How many times
did I tell you?

00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,083
I'm sorry.

00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,877
What difference
does it make?

00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,045
Is it that important?

00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,213
"Is it that important?"

00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:50,714
Where are the gloves now?

00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,341
They're in my other bag,
at home.

00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,051
I haven't used it
since that night.

00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:57,471
Let me think.

00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,932
We're safe as far
as the dress is concerned.

00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,934
It's at the cleaners.

00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,979
Now, the gloves,
they're small.

00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,316
They can be
easily overlooked.

00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,067
They can be
almost anywhere.

00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,279
Listen.

00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,864
Columbo's coming back
to my apartment.

00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:16,948
He wants to make
another search.

00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,533
Now you go back home,

00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,951
get the gloves
and come back to my place.

00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,913
I'll see you there
in an hour.

00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,331
Why can't I just
throw them away?

00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,665
Because I want him
to find them.

00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,292
He'll only be satisfied

00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,877
if all of his loose
ends are in place.

00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,420
But, Ray--

00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,672
Now you just do
as I say, darling.

00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:33,840
Hurry.

00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,443
( doorbell rings )

00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,367
There you are.

00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,331
Did you bring them?

00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:06,748
Good.
Put them on the table.

00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,167
I'll hide them
in her bureau.

00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:13,171
Columbo's going
to find them this time.

00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:13,922
Would you like a drink?

00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,132
Please.

00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:20,929
Are you angry with me?

00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,431
Not at all.

00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,015
I would have to do
something foolish.

00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:28,270
I kept going over
everything in my mind.

00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,313
But those stupid gloves.

00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:32,899
Don't you worry about it.
We've protected ourselves.

00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,032
I've missed you.

00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,576
I'm lucky I was working.

00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,703
It helped me
get through the week.

00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,037
It's behind us now.

00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,958
What about that man,
that Columbo?

00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,501
You'll never see him
again.

00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,921
But why does
he keep bothering you?

00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:59,467
Because Carol's death
has been almost too perfect.

00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:02,929
That's what irritates him.
It's like a speck in his eye.

00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:06,558
Why, he'd even look for flaws
in the Old Testament.

00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,102
You don't seem to be
very upset about it.

00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,437
Why should I be?

00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:13,064
Whatever he turns up,
I've got an answer for.

00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,483
Eventually
he'll lose interest

00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,276
and start hounding
someone else.

00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:21,198
I wish I could
feel that sure.

00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,616
The past two weeks

00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,035
I've been trying
to find an excuse

00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,495
for what we've done.

00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,080
I haven't been
very successful.

00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:33,543
Joan, there was
no other option.

00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,631
Does that justify?

00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,758
Yes.

00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,301
We're in love.

00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,969
We want
a future together.

00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,513
That's all the justification
we need.

00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,349
Look, this isn't something
you just forget.

00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,686
Don't let it interfere
with what we have.

00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,397
I won't.

00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:03,490
All we have to do
is wait.

00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:06,243
I promise
I'll make it up to you.

00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,828
( door lock rattling )

00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,545
( rattling continues )

00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,678
What are you doing here?

00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,764
Doctor, I, uh...

00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,016
I just kind of thought
that I'd save you some time

00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,768
and look
for the stuff myself.

00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,186
I mean, I just didn't want
to inconvenience you

00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,854
more than I have to.

00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,273
Don't you people usually
require a search warrant?

00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:40,360
I just didn't think
it was necessary, doctor.

00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,363
I mean, you gave me
permission, didn't you?

00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:48,159
Say, uh, what are you
doing here now?

00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,369
It bothered me too.

00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:52,706
I wanted to save some time
for both of us.

00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,374
There are the gloves,
lieutenant.

00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,751
I found them in one
of Carol's bureau drawers.

00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,731
What do you know
about that?

00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,899
We covered every inch
of that bureau.

00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,986
Well, we must've
missed these.

00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,699
You didn't find the dress
by any chance, did you?

00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,659
RAY: No, I turned
the place upside down.

00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,952
It's not here.

00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:34,205
Gee, I wonder
what she did with it.

00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,875
I'm afraid
I have no idea.

00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,461
Well, why don't
we both take another look.

00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,505
RAY: Lieutenant?

00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,089
It's not in the apartment.

00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:43,840
I went through
every one of the closets.

00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:48,261
Well, there's a laundry hamper
in the bedroom, isn't there?

00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,764
But I just told you--

00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,766
Well, there's no harm
in checking, is there?

00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,605
( doorbell rings )

00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:03,526
Lieutenant,
would you mind getting that?

00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,361
I don't feel like
talking to anyone.

00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,122
MAN: Rodeo Cleaners.

00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,375
Uh, doctor.

00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,129
How much
do I owe you?

00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,506
$4.50.

00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,759
Keep the change.

00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,551
Thank you.

00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,985
Say, isn't that
your wife's dress?

00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,660
Well, of course.

00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,705
Well, she must've put it
outside for the cleaners

00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,374
when she got back
from the airport.

00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,875
Yes, that makes sense.

00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,377
It certainly matches
the description.

00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:02,919
May I take a look?

00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:06,339
Take a good look at it,
lieutenant.

00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,926
Well, I've got to get back
to my office.

00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,220
I guess we've both
wasted a lot of time.

00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,514
Well, listen.

00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,933
I'm sorry about all this,
doctor.

00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,227
I seem to be making
a pest of myself.

00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,896
( phone ringing )

00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,733
Yeah? Oh, lieutenant!

00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,485
It's for you.

00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,201
Yeah. Thanks.

00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,203
Columbo.

00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,205
Yeah.

00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,790
Who?

00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,127
Are you sure?

00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,172
Well, what do you
know about that?

00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,758
Hmm.

00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,384
Yeah.

00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,803
All right.

00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:54,471
Yes, I'll be
right down. Yeah.

00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,310
That does it, doc.

00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,603
Does what?

00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,396
We just got a confession.

00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,857
A fella just admitted
killing your wife.

00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,401
Listen. I got to go.

00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:12,238
If I get any more information,
I'll call you.

00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,828
Isn't that funny
the way those things happen?

00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,169
( door closes )

00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,592
How did you break
the window, Tommy?

00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:33,092
I had this flashlight,

00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,803
and I knocked it
through the glass.

00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,348
What happened next?

00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,267
I told you.

00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,311
She came out.

00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,355
I didn't think
she'd be home.

00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,814
You mean Mrs. Flemming?

00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:47,357
Yeah.

00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:51,402
She was wearing this--
this nightgown.

00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,779
Yeah. Go on.

00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,948
Well, the second
she saw me,

00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,407
she started
to yell her head off.

00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,785
So I ran over
to keep her quiet.

00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,538
I put my hand
over her mouth...

00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,792
and then I, uh...

00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,962
I just strangled her.

00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,755
COLUMBO: Mm-hmm.
And then what happened?

00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:14,884
Like I said,
I began taking things.

00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,428
The silverware,
a couple of candle holders,

00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,430
a couple of lighters

00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,473
and the jewelry.

00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:24,143
Did you take
any money, Tommy?

00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:26,020
Yeah, she had about
30 bucks in her purse.

00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,982
What did you do
with the stuff that you stole?

00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,149
I fenced it.

00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,776
Where?

00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,319
Why should
I get him in trouble?

00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,362
What did
he give you for it?

00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,989
Look, lieutenant,

00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,782
how many times
do we have to go over this?

00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,742
I told you I killed her.
That ought to be enough!

00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:42,579
Tommy, why that
particular apartment?

00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,458
I saw them leaving
with their luggage.

00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,670
The initials
on his bag said "R.F."

00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:51,254
So I looked
at the mailboxes,

00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:54,632
and I saw
"Dr. Ray Flemming, penthouse,"

00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,509
the only name
that fit the initials.

00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,595
Now that was
pretty shrewd of you.

00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:03,016
How many jobs have you had
in the past few months?

01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,183
One or two.

01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,685
If I was working steady,

01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,187
would I be breaking
into apartments?

01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,315
No, I guess
you wouldn't.

01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:13,151
All right. That's all.
You can take him out.

01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,618
Well, that was quick.

01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,164
Well, you've been
very cooperative, Tommy.

01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,056
What do you think,
doc?

01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,642
I don't believe
a word he says.

01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,648
Really? Why?

01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,276
He knew exactly
what was stolen.

01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,362
He knew how the thief
got into the apartment.

01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,988
He knew what your
wife was wearing.

01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,157
And so does everyone
who reads the papers.

01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,535
Yes, that's true.
That's true.

01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:08,790
The boy's
obviously neurotic.

01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,084
Some people have an urge
to confess after every murder.

01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,586
I've even treated
a few of them.

01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,422
They have a compulsion
to purge themselves.

01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,591
Maybe they just want to get
their names in the papers.

01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:22,011
But the boy's story
does not hold up.

01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,554
You know,
you might be right.

01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,556
You know,
come to think of it,

01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,725
didn't he say

01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,936
that your wife
was screaming

01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,896
and he put his hand
over her mouth?

01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:34,607
And then he said
he lowered his hands

01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,984
and he strangled her.

01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,153
I don't know
what you're getting at.

01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:43,908
Well, your wife
was strangled from behind.

01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:44,534
There were thumb
indentation marks

01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,286
on the back of her neck,
not on the front.

01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,790
Oh, and I checked
one more thing, doc.

01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,375
Tommy was discharged

01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:52,750
from the army
on a Section 8.

01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,211
He's mentally unstable.

01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,505
If you knew that,
why did you ask what I thought?

01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,341
Oh, well, I, uh...

01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,593
I just wanted to get another
professional opinion, doc.

01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,011
I mean no offense.

01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,847
I don't have to be
a psychiatrist

01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,349
to know that
the boy's lying.

01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,809
Why not?

01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,728
For one thing, I have
no initials on my luggage.

01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,062
Oh, yeah.

01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,689
I was gonna
check that out

01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,648
if you told me that you
believed Tommy's story.

01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,817
I thought you might.

01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,778
It also occurred to me
that you may have planted

01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,404
this whole Tommy episode.

01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:26,117
Now why on earth
would I do a thing like that?

01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,338
Oh, that reminds me.

01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,048
Did you do any fishing
while you were in Acapulco?

01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:42,592
A little. Why?

01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:45,386
Oh, it's nothing important.

01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,389
It's just that, uh,
I'm a terrific bug on fishing.

01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,099
You know, my wife and I,
we're looking for a place

01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,894
to take a vacation
this summer.

01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,771
You see,
the trouble with places

01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:55,688
around here is that, um,

01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,982
well, people keep dumping

01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,233
all kinds of things
off the boat.

01:02:59,275 --> 01:02:59,776
You know, bottles, cans.

01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:02,862
Oh, it's a terrible shame.
Criminal.

01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:05,531
And, uh,
well, I suppose

01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,657
you don't notice that
in the ocean, do you?

01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,994
I mean, it's so big,

01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,329
it would
just swallow everything up.

01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,457
Uh, tell me, uh...

01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,795
Those trade journals
and those medical books,

01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,880
did you take them with you
when you went fishing?

01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,096
Lieutenant,
for the past week

01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,182
you've been asking me some
rather pointless questions,

01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,143
and I am getting
very tired of them.

01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:35,645
Oh, I'm sorry, doc.

01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:38,314
I just thought that,

01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,399
well, a boat's a good place
to get some reading done.

01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:41,734
What do my reading habits
have to do with this?

01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,195
You've been concentrating
on everything

01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,780
but the man who broke
into my apartment.

01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:49,367
Or is this some new type
of police procedure?

01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:50,910
I'm only, uh...

01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,578
I want the man
who murdered my wife.

01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,788
Everything else
is irrelevant.

01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,455
Well,
I'm only trying to...

01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,916
I know, you're only trying
to tie up loose ends.

01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,751
Well, if you spent a little
less time on loose ends,

01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,170
maybe you'd come up
with something important.

01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,843
You know, sometimes
I get the impression

01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:09,220
you think I killed my wife.

01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,682
You?

01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:15,142
Oh, no, doc.

01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,186
How could you?
You were out of town.

01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,273
I'm glad
you remembered that.

01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,609
Unless you think I hired
someone to kill her.

01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:27,029
The boy who confessed?
Maybe I paid him to do it.

01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:29,156
No, doc.
You didn't do that.

01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:30,783
How do you know?

01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:34,120
I already asked him.

01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:40,793
Are you serious?

01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,212
I am.

01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,881
He's making an absolute
pest of himself.

01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:47,842
Telephone calls,
question and answer sessions.

01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,719
He's even bothering me
at the office.

01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,469
It's getting ridiculous.

01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:52,763
He's probably trying too hard.
I'll have a word with him.

01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,224
Well, a word
won't do it.

01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,809
Burt,
you won't believe this,

01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:57,393
but somewhere
in the back of his mind

01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,062
he thinks I'm involved
with Carol's murder.

01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,148
You?
You've got to be kidding.

01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:05,484
I'm not,
and neither is Columbo.

01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:08,362
Look, isn't there some way
you can get him off my back?

01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,781
Well, if he's
pushing that hard--
<b></b>
He is.

01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:13,784
I guess
I can pull a few strings.

01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:14,785
All right.
Consider it done.

01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:16,787
Well, that was painless.

01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,123
Looks like
I owe you a favor.

01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:19,957
Forget it.
What are friends for?

01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:45,441
Evening, doctor.

01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:49,695
I just stopped by
with some news

01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,323
I thought
you might be interested.

01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:55,952
I got taken off
the case today.

01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,122
I'm no longer
working on it.

01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,749
Oh.

01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,875
Yeah, and it happened
all of a sudden too.

01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:05,294
You know,
I was sitting at my desk,

01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:05,836
and a call came down
from upstairs

01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:08,089
and they told me
that they wanted me

01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,423
to work on
something else.

01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,133
Real strange.

01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,802
And they told me
to turn my files

01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,261
over to Lieutenant Silver,

01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:14,887
who's a very nice guy,
but he's young

01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:18,516
and not experienced
in this kind of thing.

01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:20,851
That is funny.

01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:23,854
Here I thought
I was doing a good job.

01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:25,564
How unfortunate for you.

01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:27,900
But I suppose they know
what they're doing.

01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,902
Well, you'll have to excuse me.
I've got a dinner engagement.

01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,737
Where? At the Gordons?

01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,574
And why do you
say that?

01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:36,867
Well, you're a good friend
of Mr. Gordon, aren't you?

01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:39,829
I mean, last week
at the hospital

01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,080
he invited you over.

01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,207
You remember that.

01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,750
No,
it isn't the Gordons.

01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:45,876
No?

01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:47,003
A lady friend, maybe?

01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,798
I don't think
it's any of your business.

01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,341
No, I guess not.

01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:54,885
I was wondering, doctor,

01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:57,722
would you take me on
as a patient?

01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,392
Take you on as a what?

01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,810
No, I mean it.
Maybe you can help me.

01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,271
I don't know, but

01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:06,188
there must be
something wrong with me.

01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,857
I seem to bother people.

01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:10,359
I seem
to make them nervous

01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,486
and maybe you could
tell me why.

01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:13,904
Are you serious?

01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:15,948
I'm very, very serious.

01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,451
I've never been
more serious in my life.

01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,954
My wife says I ought to
have it looked into,

01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:25,624
so I told her I know
this psychiatrist.

01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:30,254
And I figure if I came here
like once a week,

01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,964
maybe we could
get it ironed out.

01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:34,050
You know what I think
the problem is?

01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:38,971
I think
I'm too suspicious.

01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:41,974
I don't trust people.
That's my trouble.

01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,018
For instance,
when I get taken off a case,

01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,189
right away I figure
somebody put the pressure on.

01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,483
Right away
I ask myself why.

01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:52,443
What do you think, doc?

01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:55,821
I think you'd better
get out of here.

01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:56,280
Beg your pardon?

01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,157
Columbo,
you're a public servant.

01:07:58,199 --> 01:07:58,991
You say you've been
taken off the case.

01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,786
Fine.

01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:05,372
Bother me again, and I shall
have to talk to your superiors.

01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:08,584
You've been talking to a lot
of people these days, doctor.

01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:19,095
( chuckles )

01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:20,930
Columbo,
you are magnificent.

01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:21,472
You really are.

01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,974
Well, what makes you
say that, doc?

01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:26,894
You are the most
persistent creature

01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,562
I've ever met,
but likeable.

01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,147
The astonishing thing is
you're likeable.

01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:32,566
Has anyone ever told you
you're droll?

01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,860
Who? Me?

01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,946
Yes, you?

01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:38,906
Oh, come on, doc.
Come on.

01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,825
( laughing )

01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:41,575
Oh, but you are.

01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,244
You're a sly little elf,

01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,787
and you should be
sitting under

01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,038
your own private
little toadstool.

01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,873
You say you've been
thrown off the case,

01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:51,085
and yet you have the flagrant
audacity to come back here

01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,087
and bother me again.

01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:53,587
I respect that.

01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:56,549
It irritates me,
but I respect it.

01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:57,675
( mouthing )

01:08:58,676 --> 01:08:59,760
How about a drink?

01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,472
Well, all right.

01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:15,568
Hey, now,
that's pretty clever.

01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,821
You can always have a snort
between patients, huh?

01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,283
I haven't given you
a Rorschach test yet,

01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,577
but I've got a hunch
you're a bourbon man.

01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,331
Thank you very much,
doctor.

01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,544
What'll we drink to?

01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:36,964
Oh, I don't know.
How about you and me?

01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,717
Fine.

01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,893
Like to read,
huh, doctor?

01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,352
Yes, I do.

01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:51,979
You read
murder mysteries?

01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,772
Not very often.

01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:56,442
Oh, me, I love them.
I find them nice and relaxing.

01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:58,402
You know, the only
trouble is that

01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,404
they got nothing
to do with real life.

01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,364
I mean,
the guy who did it,

01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:03,199
they catch him
every time,

01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,117
and you and I
know that

01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:08,829
it doesn't always
work out that way.

01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,956
You never stop, do you?

01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,458
What?

01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:17,546
The insinuation,
the change of pace.

01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:19,131
You're a bag of tricks,
Columbo.

01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:21,717
Right down to that
prop cigar you use.

01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:23,302
Oh, come on, doc.

01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,387
I'm going to tell you
something about yourself.

01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:26,972
You say
you need a psychiatrist?

01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:28,599
Maybe you do,
maybe you don't.

01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:31,018
But you are the textbook
example of compensation.

01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,270
Of what, doc?

01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:36,482
Compensation.
Adaptability.

01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:38,192
You're an intelligent man,
Columbo,

01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:38,776
but you hide it.

01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:41,820
You pretend you're
something you're not.

01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,155
Why?

01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:43,822
Because
of your appearance.

01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:48,244
You think you cannot get by
on looks or polish,

01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:51,038
so you turn a defect
into a virtue.

01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,165
You take people
by surprise.

01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,541
They underestimate you,

01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,085
and that's where
you trip them up.

01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:57,461
Like coming here tonight.

01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:03,759
Boy, you've got me pegged
pretty good, doctor.

01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,719
I'm gonna have to
watch myself with you

01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:09,807
'cause, uh, you figure out
people pretty good.

01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:15,396
Now you're trying
flattery.

01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,147
No, really,
I'm serious, doctor.

01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:18,232
You've got a gift there.

01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:18,983
Oh, I know it's your job

01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:21,277
and I know you've studied
for years, but still it's...

01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:23,195
Well, it's amazing
that a person can come in here

01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,864
and sit down,
and in a couple of hours

01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:26,156
you know all about them.

01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:28,450
Well, not quite.

01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:29,868
Psychiatry
isn't a parlor trick.

01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:30,160
Oh, I didn't
mean that.

01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,371
No, I was just,

01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,330
I was just
wondering that, uh...

01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:38,127
Well, no.
I guess that isn't possible.

01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:40,587
What isn't?

01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:41,046
Well, I know
it's easy enough

01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,090
to figure out
about a patient

01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,551
or a guy like me that's always
hanging around all the time,

01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:46,260
but what about
a stranger?

01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,220
What about a, uh,

01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:51,181
a fellow that you've
never met before?

01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:55,352
Can you tell
what makes him tick?

01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:57,521
Any particular one
in mind?

01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:01,066
No, nobody special.
Just a type.

01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,277
Like a murderer,
for instance?

01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,404
Well, yeah.

01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,613
Now that you mention it...

01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,909
I guess
we're on the same wavelength.

01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,244
Yes, I guess we are.

01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:16,415
What about this
hypothetical murderer?

01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:16,915
Well, I'm not talking
about your average hothead

01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:19,668
you know, the guy
who pops somebody

01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,210
over the noggin
with a bottle.

01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:24,631
What I mean is,
uh, the kind of man

01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,551
that, uh, figures
everything out in advance,

01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:30,596
who takes
everything step by step.

01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:36,018
What do you know about
that kind of man, doctor?

01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,519
I should charge you
for this.

01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:38,103
But since
it's on a theoretical basis,

01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:41,940
let's just call it
a free consultation.

01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:43,025
All right.

01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,610
All right.

01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:47,446
We are talking about a man
who commits a crime,

01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:51,617
not the garden variety
of barroom brawl,

01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:54,370
but an elaborate
intellectual project.

01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:59,458
What do we know
about this man?

01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,502
Obviously,
he's not impulsive.

01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,505
He plans. He calculates.

01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,466
He minimizes risks.

01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:10,219
He's oriented by his mind,

01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,720
not by his emotion.

01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:17,309
And he's probably
well educated too.

01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,311
Like maybe
a professional man?

01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,647
Like maybe.

01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:23,565
At any rate,
an orderly man

01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:26,985
with an eye
for detail and courage.

01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:27,277
Courage?

01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:29,488
Oh, certainly.

01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,531
To go through
a thing like this,

01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:32,699
whatever it may be,

01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:35,035
it takes
a strong nervous system.

01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,663
Well, you could be right.

01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:38,122
But one thing
bothers me, doctor.

01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,541
This man
that we're talking about

01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,501
has taken a human life.

01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,211
Now wouldn't you say
that he was insane?

01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,713
Why?

01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,632
Because he committed
an immoral act?

01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:53,929
Morals are conditioned,
lieutenant.

01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:56,181
They're relative,
like everything else is today.

01:13:57,724 --> 01:14:00,310
Our murderer may be
as sane as you and me.

01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:04,356
Killing may be
repugnant to him,

01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,817
but if it's his only solution,
he uses it.

01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:10,195
That's pragmatism,
my friend, not insanity.

01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,366
Tell me, doctor.

01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:15,868
How do you catch
a man like that?

01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:20,038
You don't.

01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:23,333
You're probably right.

01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:26,795
He sounds
just too clever for us.

01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,422
What I mean is,
you know, cops,

01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,424
we're not the brightest
guys in the world.

01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,551
Of course, we got one thing
going for us.

01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:33,177
We're professionals.

01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:37,264
I mean, you take our
friend here, the murderer.

01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,557
He's very smart,

01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,309
but he's an amateur.

01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,227
I mean, he's got
just one time to learn.

01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:43,520
Just one.

01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:46,273
With us,
well, with us

01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,025
it's a business.

01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:51,320
You see, we do this
a hundred times a year.

01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:53,489
I'll tell you, doc.

01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,241
That's a lot of practice.

01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:57,618
It didn't help you
very much, did it?

01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,244
I mean,
with all that experience,

01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:01,413
you jumped
to the wrong conclusion.

01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:03,332
What do you mean?

01:15:03,373 --> 01:15:04,791
I didn't kill my wife.

01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:08,295
I never said you did.

01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,713
Oh, that's true.

01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:12,090
Imply.
"Imply" is more the word.

01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:15,802
But if I killed my wife...

01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,722
and I did say "if"...

01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,184
you're never going
to be able to prove it.

01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:25,395
So why don't we
just part as friends?

01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:28,106
You go on
to something new,

01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:30,442
and I'll forget this
whole thing ever happened.

01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,277
As a matter of fact,
there's no reason

01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,321
for us to see
each other again.

01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,573
Well, I have
to be going now.

01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:37,032
Well,
I'll go out with you.

01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:40,536
No, no,
you just stay here,

01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:42,287
relax, search the office.

01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:43,580
Oh!

01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,002
And if you
want another drink,

01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,629
help yourself.

01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,005
Good night.

01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:58,387
Oh, by the way,
when you leave,

01:15:58,428 --> 01:15:59,805
turn out the light.

01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,894
( door closes )

01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,280
COLUMBO:
Uh, Miss Hudson.

01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,746
Who are you?

01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,414
Uh, Lieutenant Columbo,
ma'am.

01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,207
Police.

01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,628
We met the other day.
Remember?

01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:14,796
What's this all about?

01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:18,425
Is there someplace
where we could go,

01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,260
where we could talk?

01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,470
Why?

01:17:21,511 --> 01:17:23,805
Oh, just a few routine
questions, that's all.

01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:24,306
Would you
like some ice cream?

01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:27,225
No, thanks.
Questions about what?

01:17:27,267 --> 01:17:28,477
Uh...

01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:29,645
Well,
could we go in there?

01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:55,796
This is quite a place.

01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:12,688
Lieutenant, would you mind
telling me why you're here?

01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:14,564
Yes, of course,
I was hoping you might help us

01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:17,609
with a case
that we're working on.

01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:18,819
What case is that?

01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:22,698
Lieutenant?

01:18:24,574 --> 01:18:27,285
The Flemming case.

01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,538
Oh, you mean Dr. Flemming,
my psychiatrist?

01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:30,747
Uh-huh.

01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,960
Is he
in some kind of trouble?

01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:38,088
What was that?

01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,590
I said, is he
in some kind of trouble?

01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:42,551
Well,
you might say he is.

01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:44,386
Sit down, Miss Hudson.

01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:50,642
There's no rule
about smoking here, is there?

01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:51,935
No.

01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:56,189
Well, then if you don't mind,
I'll light up.

01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,816
See, a lot of women,
they don't like cigars.

01:18:57,858 --> 01:19:01,153
Now, my wife,
she prefers a pipe.

01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:02,821
And I could never
get used to those things.

01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:05,031
There's just too much
to carry around with you.

01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:12,038
How long have you known
Dr. Flemming?

01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,665
You mean, how long
has he been treating me?

01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,959
Well, that's the same thing,
isn't it?

01:19:16,376 --> 01:19:18,712
I've been seeing him
for about a year.

01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,506
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.

01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:24,509
That checks out.

01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:27,429
By the way,
when was the last time

01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,598
that you
spoke to Dr. Flemming?

01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:30,891
Last week when I met you.

01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:33,226
Oh, that's right.
Yes.

01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:34,978
Lieutenant,
would you mind explaining--

01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,189
Are you working here
on a movie now?

01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:39,691
That's right.

01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:40,942
Well, I'm gonna have to see it
when it comes out.

01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:41,568
What are you? Are you--

01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:45,447
Are you playing a Roman girl
or a Greek girl?

01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:46,698
Do you do your own makeup?

01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,700
What has this got to do
with Dr. Flemming?

01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:51,203
Pardon me?

01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:53,121
Lieutenant,
you're not being very clear.

01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:55,707
You came here to ask me
about a man I hardly know.

01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:57,375
You said he was in trouble.

01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:59,044
Now, before we go on,

01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:00,921
suppose you tell me
what kind of trouble.

01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:04,049
Well, I know that this is gonna
come as a shock to you...

01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:08,345
but we think
that he killed his wife.

01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:12,766
You seem stunned.

01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,852
Well, of course
I'm stunned.

01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,479
I don't believe it.

01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:18,438
No?

01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:36,498
Hey, I wonder
who these belong to.

01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,002
Well, maybe somebody
left them by mistake.

01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,841
Miss Hudson, uh...

01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:49,261
Well, you seem nervous.

01:20:49,302 --> 01:20:50,929
Haven't you seen
a pair of sunglasses before?

01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:54,766
Would you like to
try them on?

01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:57,352
Why should I?
<b></b>
No reason.

01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,604
But there's no reason
why you shouldn't, either.

01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,606
Is there?

01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:05,360
I think I'd better go.

01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,946
Sit down, Miss Hudson.

01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:09,239
If you insist
on questioning me,

01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,115
I'm going to have
to call my lawyer.

01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:12,242
Sit down.

01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:13,785
You can't stop me
from calling my lawyer.

01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:16,329
You have no right
to order me around.

01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,956
You're not even
on this case anymore.

01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:18,874
Well, now,
how did you know that?

01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:22,294
Dr. Flemming told me.

01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:25,046
Oh, but you said
that you hadn't seen

01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:27,299
Dr. Flemming
since last week.

01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:30,969
He called me.

01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:34,973
Oh, is the doctor
in the habit of doing that?

01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:36,766
I'm not going to answer
any more of your questions.

01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:39,728
Just one more point,
Miss Hudson,

01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:40,687
that I'd like to clear up.

01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,397
I am on the case.

01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:43,815
It's true somebody
tried to pull a few strings.

01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:46,359
But my superior,
he doesn't like that.

01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:47,986
He gets thinking.

01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:50,780
So he said to me, he said,
"Lieutenant Columbo,

01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:52,866
you must be
touching a sore spot,

01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,910
so you just
keep right on trying."

01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:58,079
He's very intelligent,
my superior.

01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,666
I want to call my lawyer.

01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:05,086
I don't understand that.

01:22:05,128 --> 01:22:06,838
Now Dr. Flemming
killed his wife,

01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,591
and you want
to call your lawyer.

01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:12,594
Would you explain that to me,
Miss Hudson?

01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:15,597
I want to call my lawyer.

01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,015
All right.

01:22:19,559 --> 01:22:20,518
Go ahead.

01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:26,983
If he wants to know
what the charge is...

01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:30,946
it's accessory to murder.

01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:35,325
Now go ahead and make
your call, Miss Hudson.

01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,952
When you get done,
we'll take a drive.

01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:39,829
A drive?

01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:42,666
Yes, we're gonna
go see the stewardess.

01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:47,045
I don't have the blue dress,
and I don't have the gloves,

01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:48,922
and I don't think you're going
to try on these sunglasses,

01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,883
but maybe she'll
remember you anyhow,

01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:54,427
wig or no wig.

01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:03,979
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:07,232
You're trying
to confuse me.

01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:10,110
I have nothing
to do with this.

01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:12,320
With what?
<b></b>
With this--

01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:14,572
With the thing
that you said about Ray.

01:23:14,614 --> 01:23:15,865
Ray?
<b></b>
Dr. Flemming.

01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:17,951
But you
just called him Ray.

01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,869
What difference
does that make?

01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:22,789
I know him.
He's my doctor.

01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:23,873
Your lover?

01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:25,417
My doctor.

01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:27,085
And you said
you never met his wife?

01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,212
No,
I never met his wife.

01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:29,713
Would you like to see
some pictures of her?

01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:32,132
I had them taken
at the morgue.

01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:33,591
They're
in my briefcase.

01:23:33,633 --> 01:23:35,385
No.
<b></b>
Why should you?

01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:35,885
After all,
you saw the real thing.

01:23:35,927 --> 01:23:36,594
That must have
been quite a shock.

01:23:36,636 --> 01:23:40,932
Why don't you leave me alone?
I didn't do anything.

01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:43,893
No?
What about these?

01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:45,895
What about the sunglasses?

01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:49,274
What about
the overweight luggage?

01:23:49,315 --> 01:23:50,942
What about
the argument on the plane?

01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:52,819
I don't want to listen
to any of this.

01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,821
Now you was there
when he strangled her!

01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,322
Weren't you?
<b></b>
No!

01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,700
Well, does that mean
that you came later?

01:23:58,742 --> 01:23:59,826
I was never there at all.

01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:00,452
I think you were.

01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:03,955
I think you probably
changed into her dress

01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:05,582
while she was
lying there,

01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:07,584
and then you and the doctor
went to the airport

01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:10,003
and had that fake argument
on the plane, now didn't you?

01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,463
No!
<b></b>
Didn't you?

01:24:11,504 --> 01:24:13,465
Didn't you help
plan it with him?

01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:14,924
Didn't you help
carry it out with him?

01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:17,385
Now, didn't you?
<b></b>
Oh, stop it!

01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:19,387
Without you,
that woman would be alive!

01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:20,555
Without you, she wouldn't
be lying in a morgue!

01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:21,097
Stop it! Stop it!

01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:23,308
It couldn't have happened
without you!

01:24:23,349 --> 01:24:24,559
Stop it!

01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,489
Why don't we go downtown

01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:38,239
and you can make
a statement?

01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,882
No.

01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,509
You have no right.

01:25:00,303 --> 01:25:01,888
I have nothing
to do with this,

01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,264
do you understand?

01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:05,767
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

01:25:07,393 --> 01:25:08,895
If you want to take me
to the stewardess,

01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:09,979
then take me.

01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:13,108
If you want to arrest me,
go ahead.

01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:15,443
But you can't prove anything.

01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:20,824
Now, either charge me
or let me leave.

01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:22,158
I don't care what you do.

01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:29,791
You can go.

01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,386
Miss Hudson.

01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:45,014
I hope you understand
that this is only the beginning.

01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:47,183
In a way,
I feel sorry for you

01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:50,019
because from now on
I'm gonna do everything

01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:51,104
I can to break you down.

01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,148
Do you understand?

01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:55,066
Dr. Flemming made one mistake,
and you're it.

01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:58,153
You're the weak link,
Miss Hudson.

01:25:58,194 --> 01:26:02,365
Now you surprised me today
because you were strong.

01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,617
But there's always tomorrow

01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:09,414
and the day after that
and the day after that...

01:26:09,455 --> 01:26:12,250
and sooner or later,
you're going to talk to me.

01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:15,336
Until you do,
you're going to be questioned,

01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:17,255
you're going to be followed

01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:18,923
and you're going to be
hounded.

01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:23,178
And Dr. Flemming
can't do anything about it.

01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:25,263
You're on your own,
Miss Hudson,

01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:29,100
and I'm going to
get to him through you.

01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:30,310
That's a promise.

01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:36,561
( phone ringing )

01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:47,238
Hello?

01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,157
Ray! Oh, thank heavens!

01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:50,616
I've been calling for hours.

01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,744
What's wrong?
You sound upset.

01:28:52,785 --> 01:28:54,454
Columbo came to see me
at the studio today.

01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:57,498
Columbo?

01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,250
He tried to break me down.

01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,252
Did you tell him anything?

01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:02,670
No, of course not.

01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:03,296
But he knows.

01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:06,424
Every detail.
Even the alibi on the plane.

01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:09,761
Oh, he's only guessing.
Guesses are no proof.

01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:10,094
But why should he be
questioning you?

01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:12,889
He's off the case.

01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:14,432
No, he's not.
He's right in the middle of it.

01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:19,562
Two of his men
are parked outside right now.

01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:23,107
Well, I think
we'd better have a talk.

01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:24,400
Come in tomorrow
for your appointment.

01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:26,110
We'll figure something out.

01:29:26,152 --> 01:29:27,528
But can't you
come over here now?

01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:29,197
With his men
watching your house?

01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:30,323
Joan, use your head.

01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:31,032
But you're my doctor!

01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:33,993
I mean, there's nothing wrong
in visiting a patient!

01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,204
He obviously expects us
to get together tonight.

01:29:36,245 --> 01:29:38,081
Let's not be predictable.

01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,708
What are we going to do?

01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:43,795
Just ride it out.
You're his last resort.

01:29:43,836 --> 01:29:45,380
If you don't panic,
we're home free.

01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:49,509
Ray, I have to see you.

01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,844
You will, in the morning.

01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:54,472
Now put on some music,

01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:57,016
have yourself a drink
and stop worrying.

01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:58,142
Ray!

01:29:58,184 --> 01:29:59,394
Yes?

01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:05,108
All right. I'll try.

01:30:06,275 --> 01:30:07,485
( line disconnects )

01:30:17,286 --> 01:30:18,913
Miss Petrie.
<b></b>
Yes, doctor?

01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,165
Doesn't Miss Hudson
have a 10:00 appointment?

01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:22,417
Yes, she does.

01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:23,960
It's 10:30.
Why don't you give her a call?

01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:38,558
Hello.
Is Miss Hudson...

01:30:40,893 --> 01:30:42,103
Well, no, I...

01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:45,898
This is the receptionist
in Dr. Flemming's office.

01:30:47,483 --> 01:30:49,652
Well, she had an appointment
here this morning.

01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:53,948
I see.

01:30:57,952 --> 01:30:59,412
I just called Miss Hudson,
and a man answered.

01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:01,914
He said he was
from the coroner's office.

01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:05,460
Try it again, maybe
you got the wrong number.

01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:21,058
This is Dr. Flemming's
office again.

01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,185
Is Miss Hudson there?

01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:25,104
You don't understand.

01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:27,523
Dr. Flemming
is her psychiatrist.

01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:32,403
Well, I'm only trying
to get some information.

01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:33,738
Let me have that.

01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:34,906
Hello.
This is Dr. Flemming.

01:31:34,947 --> 01:31:36,032
Who are you?

01:31:37,408 --> 01:31:39,160
Miss Hudson is under my care.

01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:41,787
I want to know what happened.

01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:45,750
Look, I am her psychiatrist.

01:31:48,544 --> 01:31:51,047
What kind of accident?

01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:55,092
Well, then who do I call
to find out?

01:31:55,134 --> 01:31:56,844
Look, can't you get it
through your head that...

01:31:58,262 --> 01:31:59,180
Never mind.

01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:06,604
Miss Petrie,
I'm going out for a while.

01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:07,688
Tell my next patient
that I'll be late.

01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:51,566
Where is she?

01:32:51,607 --> 01:32:53,943
I said, where is she?

01:33:20,219 --> 01:33:21,596
She stuffed herself
with barbiturates.

01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:26,434
I didn't think...

01:33:26,475 --> 01:33:27,935
What didn't you think?

01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:52,710
You didn't think what?

01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:57,131
Well, I questioned
her yesterday. I...

01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:00,176
I guess
I pushed her too far.

01:34:00,217 --> 01:34:03,095
I told her that I was gonna
get to you through her.

01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,723
You had to bring her
into this, didn't you?

01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:07,767
Didn't you know what she'd do?
Or didn't you care?

01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:08,768
Don't lecture me, doctor!

01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:09,268
I'm responsible,

01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:11,937
and I'm gonna have
to live with it.

01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:13,731
But you're leaving
somebody out.

01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:16,484
We both killed that girl,
the two of us together.

01:34:16,525 --> 01:34:17,818
She committed suicide

01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,570
for one reason,
to protect you.

01:34:19,612 --> 01:34:21,447
You see,
it was all for you.

01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,115
For you, doc.

01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:32,875
By the way,
congratulations.

01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:36,045
I mean, you're home free now,
aren't you?

01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:38,422
Boy, it couldn't have
worked out better.

01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:41,592
She was the only one
who could've given you away.

01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:45,429
Can't touch you anymore, doc.
Nobody can.

01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:46,055
You're free and clear.

01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:49,350
You won, doc.

01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:54,730
The only trouble
is you didn't get

01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,440
what you were going after.

01:35:00,611 --> 01:35:02,154
What is that supposed to mean?

01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:04,949
Why, the girl.

01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:06,742
You loved her
and you wanted her

01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:08,327
and you were willing
to murder for her.

01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,912
And now she's gone,

01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:12,373
and all that planning,
all that sweat...

01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:15,376
and you wind up with nothing.

01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:18,713
What are you
trying to tell me?

01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,552
I'm not trying
to tell you anything, doctor.

01:35:24,593 --> 01:35:26,846
I was just thinking that...

01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:30,891
you're going to be a terribly
lonely man from here on in

01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:31,434
and maybe you'd feel better

01:35:31,475 --> 01:35:35,312
if you got a few things
off your chest.

01:35:35,354 --> 01:35:36,522
Like what?

01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:38,023
Like the truth.

01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,610
Are you asking me
to confess?

01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:44,071
Well, is that so strange?

01:35:44,113 --> 01:35:46,574
After all, what do you have
to look forward to?

01:35:46,615 --> 01:35:47,575
Think about that, doc.

01:35:47,616 --> 01:35:51,036
The girl isn't around anymore.

01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:53,247
And who knows?
Maybe you owe her something.

01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,093
What do you say, doc?

01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:09,972
( chuckling )

01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:16,562
You're a very funny man.

01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:17,980
I wasn't trying to be funny.

01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:20,691
But you are,
more than you know.

01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:23,360
So you want me to purge myself?

01:36:23,402 --> 01:36:24,862
My one and only love is dead,

01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:27,364
and I have nothing
more to live for, is that it?

01:36:27,406 --> 01:36:28,699
All I'm saying, doctor,

01:36:28,741 --> 01:36:29,617
is that if you love that girl--

01:36:29,658 --> 01:36:31,869
Love that girl?

01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:34,997
Look, Columbo,
I overestimated you.

01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:38,626
I thought you understood
about human nature.

01:36:38,667 --> 01:36:40,586
I never loved that girl.

01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:41,587
Come on, doc.

01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:43,714
No, really.

01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:45,633
Remember that
hypothetical murderer

01:36:45,674 --> 01:36:47,384
we were talking about?

01:36:47,426 --> 01:36:48,719
He needed an alibi.
The girl was available.

01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:52,389
So he used her.
It was as simple as that.

01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:52,723
No.

01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:55,142
You killed your wife

01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:58,062
because you were
in love with the girl.

01:36:58,103 --> 01:37:00,648
Well, if I killed Carol
and there's no proof that I did

01:37:00,689 --> 01:37:02,274
I did it for myself,

01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:03,692
not for some dime-a-dozen
little actress.

01:37:03,734 --> 01:37:05,820
She helped you
with the murder.

01:37:05,861 --> 01:37:08,405
You'd have had to marry her.

01:37:09,698 --> 01:37:10,199
Not really.

01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:13,494
Something
would have been arranged.

01:37:16,705 --> 01:37:17,915
Like an accident, maybe.

01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:20,835
JOAN: Always planning ahead,
aren't you, Ray?

01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:47,111
They said there was something
I should hear.

01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:24,356
Would you like to make
a statement now?

01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:37,244
Why don't we sit down?
We'll be more comfortable.
