1
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,540
Where are you going?

2
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,175
Where are you going, Madame?

3
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:53,645
Oh hi!

4
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,447
Come here...

5
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,329
You want the stick? Go get it!

6
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,650
Did you see it?

7
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,365
Oh you sure talk a lot!

8
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,200
What is your name?

9
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,903
I'm talking to you!
Talking to you!

10
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,273
That's his name!

11
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,307
HA HA!

12
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,842
That's not his name.

13
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,777
HA HA!

14
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,179
Hello, HA HA.

15
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,820
You know, man...

16
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,359
When you look at it, just
really, really look at it...

17
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,695
You just look at it
really closely...

18
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,601
It's just not worth it you know?
It's not part of the deal.

19
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,372
It's like you just can't
really, you know...?

20
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,875
It's like tucked away
up there in a corner.

21
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,843
Just there in a corner,
you know?

22
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,980
And I'm worried...
I'm really worried.

23
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,918
I'm really really really really
REALLY worried.

24
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,870
Don't step on a crack.
It'll break your mother's back.

25
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,505
HA HA!

26
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,442
HA HA!

27
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,278
HA HA!

28
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,851
Look at me.

29
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,587
All the abuse I've taken

30
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,890
and I've got
a beautiful head of hair!

31
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,928
God almighty,
it's a glorious day!

32
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,031
I'm probably gonna be a doctor.

33
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,866
And I have bloody gloves.

34
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,869
Oh wow!
And what about you, Kyle?

35
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:31,870
Football player.

36
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,273
Football player? Which one?

37
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,540
Mark Sanchez.

38
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,376
Oh, he plays for the Jets.

39
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:38,877
That's pretty cool.

40
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,579
Hey, you guys.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

41
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,449
Not a problem.
Not a problem at all.

42
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,917
- You guys ready?
- Yeah...

43
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,920
I'll see you tomorrow boys.
Have a good night.

44
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,423
Thank you so much. Bye.

45
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,492
Alright guys. Let's go!

46
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,333
Okay, so let's try it from here.

47
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,934
This is closer.

48
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,804
Oh!

49
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,440
Got it?

50
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,311
This is it.
We're gonna do it this time!

51
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,512
Okay, maybe not.

52
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,415
We have to make
at least one basket.

53
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,050
This is shameful.

54
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,456
- Yeahhhh!
- Oh my god!

55
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,677
- High five, dude!
- That was like out of...

56
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,960
I don't even know
what just happened.

57
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,684
Kyle come play with us!

58
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,432
My shoelace is untied.

59
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,033
So tie it back up!

60
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,535
I don't know how.

61
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,638
What do you mean?

62
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,574
Why are you wearing these shoes?
Where are your velcro shoes?

63
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,743
If you're gonna wear shoes
that have laces,

64
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,579
then we need to learn
how to tie them, right?

65
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,614
Alright.

66
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,351
So you're gonna
take your shoelaces...

67
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,519
You're gonna make an X, alright?

68
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,056
Then you take this
and you pull it under.

69
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,991
And tie it.

70
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,760
Now we make a hoop here...

71
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,063
So you have two little ears.

72
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,632
Now you make an X with those,

73
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,868
and then you tuck this under...

74
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:11,763
And you tie it.

75
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,506
- You did it!
- I did it!

76
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,148
Hey, uh-uh, no way, guys.

77
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,084
Finish your homework first
and then you can play.

78
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,988
Hello!

79
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,991
Alright, you guys.

80
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,126
Do your...

81
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:12,030
Come sit down, do your homework,
and then you can play.

82
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,499
Gimmie...
Can I have that please?

83
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,637
Hello! Anybody home?

84
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,039
- Where is everybody?
- Daddy!

85
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,608
I've lost everybody.
There's nobody home.

86
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,577
There used to be
kids running around.

87
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,579
I don't see anybody.
Where is everybody?

88
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,581
Oh, here are
the little monsters!

89
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,216
What have you been up to?

90
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:34,119
You've been shooting people,
haven't you?

91
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,487
Yeah?

92
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,521
Okay come on.

93
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,623
Let's take
this little one to Lily,

94
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,826
and show her what we have
for dinner tonight.

95
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,159
Lily!

96
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:45,630
Look what I brought home
for dinner tonight. Look!

97
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,599
- Okay.
- Put him in the bowl!

98
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,635
Aaron please,
I just got them settled down.

99
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,138
They need to do
their homework, please.

100
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,674
I guess you have no choice.

101
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,043
Let's go and do homework.

102
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,620
Lily, they've disappeared again.
I have no idea where they went!

103
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,021
Aaron, please!

104
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,590
Alright, they need to finish
their homework.

105
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,492
Okay, okay...

106
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,694
We're not going to win tonight.

107
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,796
You're going to have to do
your homework.

108
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,038
So what's for dinner tonight?

109
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,566
Fish and vegetables.

110
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,202
- Oh no!
- Oh no!

111
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,972
- Fish and vegetables!
- Fish and vegetables!

112
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,107
Ahhhh!

113
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,180
I'm exhausted.

114
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,149
Have a long day?

115
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,020
Thanks for
picking the kids up today.

116
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,149
You're welcome.

117
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,327
Do you know
Kyle can't tie his shoes?

118
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,629
Really?

119
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,664
His mom
was supposed to show him.

120
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,798
Well, she didn't.

121
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,700
I'll show him tomorrow.

122
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,405
I already showed him.

123
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,752
I was thinking...

124
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,721
Now that your treatment
is almost over...

125
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,890
maybe we could
go away next month?

126
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,093
Yeah, maybe.

127
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,828
Maybe?

128
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,071
I just feel like I really need
to try finding a job right now.

129
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,073
I'm not so sure I should leave.

130
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,742
I'll think about it.

131
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,438
Okay.

132
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,472
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

133
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,330
<i>Stop it...</i>

134
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,238
<i>Stop...</i>

135
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,341
<i>Ask her...</i>

136
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:52,944
Yes?

137
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:56,448
He wants to know
if you like your hair like that?

138
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,451
- What do you think?
- I think it looks funny.

139
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:00,919
I think you look funny!

140
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,721
- No I don't!
- Yeah you do!

141
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,290
C'mon guys, get ready. You're
going to be late for school.

142
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,991
Yeah, I know, it's tough.

143
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,464
You're staying
with your mom tonight.

144
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:13,865
Do you have everything you need?

145
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,787
- Yeah, we know.
- Yeah, we know.

146
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,902
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.

147
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:18,970
Blech!

148
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,740
- Ohhhh, gross!
- Come on...

149
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,042
- What are you up to today?
- Not much.

150
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,810
- Not much?
- Yeah.

151
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,212
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

152
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,313
Bye!

153
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,881
Bye.

154
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,483
Grab your jackets, guys.

155
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,411
<i>Angels and devils,</i>
<i>everybody except for God.</i>

156
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,147
<i>You know, in theory,</i>
<i>to keep safe...</i>

157
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,953
<i>Chess players are always quick</i>
<i>to say and state the theory.</i>

158
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,989
<i>But you're on shaky ground</i>
<i>when you say theory.</i>

159
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,993
<i>Lot of people become geniuses</i>
<i>if they ride the wave.</i>

160
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:53,031
<i>A lot of people become</i>
<i>mentally defunct.</i>

161
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,366
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

162
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,869
<i>A mental nervous breakdown...</i>

163
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,370
<i>'Cause you have so many things</i>
<i>hitting at you.</i>

164
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,206
<i>And you're saying everything...</i>

165
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:06,578
<i>Love, business, finance,</i>
<i>you know what I'm saying?</i>

166
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,514
<i>Travel here, do these things,</i>
<i>studying, and what have you.</i>

167
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,082
<i>So, I'm gonna know</i>
<i>so many things,</i>

168
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,184
<i>so many things</i>
<i>are hitting at you,</i>

169
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,053
<i>you don't have time to figure</i>
<i>everything out</i>

170
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,055
<i>to its fullest degree.</i>

171
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,858
<i>That's why there's so much</i>
<i>debate in the world now.</i>

172
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,292
<i>A person says, "Oh no."</i>

173
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,962
<i>Her husband says,</i>
<i>"No, it's this way."</i>

174
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:28,066
<i>And other people say,</i>
<i>"No, it's this way"...</i>

175
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,335
<i>A lot of marriages</i>
<i>are breaking up</i>

176
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,271
<i>because the woman says,</i>
<i>"No, it's this one,"</i>

177
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,974
<i>and that's because</i>
<i>they're not looking</i>

178
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,042
<i>at everything right</i>
<i>in theory at all.</i>

179
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,646
<i>Because after a while,</i>
<i>if you don't conquer it,</i>

180
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,649
<i>you have a nervous breakdown,</i>
<i>so many things...</i>

181
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,690
Hello?

182
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:46,757
Hello...

183
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,262
What's all this?

184
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:55,133
I thought I'd surprise you and
try and cook for you for once.

185
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,337
Wow...
that was really sweet of you.

186
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,474
Which was started
under Fidel Castro,

187
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,178
and the opening images are

188
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,349
Fidel and Che Guevara playing
golf at the country club.

189
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,418
- At the country club?
- They have memberships.

190
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,354
They hung out there
all the time.

191
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,855
That's how I pictured it
in my head:

192
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,824
cigars, Cuban cigars...

193
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,392
But anyway, while they were

194
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,394
playing golf
in a terrible manner,

195
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:26,397
they were looking at
the landscape and Fidel said,

196
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,932
"We are going to build here

197
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,800
"the most important
art school in the world."

198
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,269
I like how it's already

199
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:34,906
Well, everything with Fidel
was "the most important."

200
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,908
And within a couple of days

201
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,344
they had commissioned somebody
to find the architect,

202
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,746
an important artist...

203
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,247
And they started designing

204
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,749
this art school
on the golf course.

205
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,317
So they planned these buildings,

206
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,387
there was
a huge building for dance,

207
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,829
a building for the visual arts,
a building for sculpture,

208
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,393
- a building for music...
- Oh, speaking of music!

209
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,863
I got an awesome record today.

210
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,799
Which I think

211
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,468
you might just like...

212
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,615
- What do you think about that?
- Now that's a surprise!

213
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,951
- Is that a surprise?
- That's a surprise!

214
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,226
- Oh, hey Mary!
- Hey, Lily.

215
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,597
Listen,
it's about the noise up here.

216
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,032
What the hell are you doing?

217
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:30,868
Oh, I was teaching myself
how to tap dance.

218
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:35,239
That's really great for you,
but for me, it's really noisy,

219
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:38,042
I'm trying to work towards
a deadline, I can't concentrate.

220
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,643
Do you think
you could kill the noise?

221
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,111
Yeah, sure!

222
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,514
- I really appreciate it.
- Great, okay.

223
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,749
Hey listen, how ya doin'?

224
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,686
- I'm doin' good.
- You feeling alright?

225
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,854
Yeah, I feel good.

226
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:52,490
Have you heard about
this new research they're doing

227
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,891
on nanotechnology?

228
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,095
Is it for cancer?

229
00:24:58,597 --> 00:24:59,897
Like, yeah.

230
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:01,665
No.

231
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,101
You may wanna look into it.
It's pretty innovative

232
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,203
and I think it could be
helpful to you.

233
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,204
Okay.

234
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,073
Listen...

235
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,509
If there's anything you need...

236
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,277
If I can help you with
anything...

237
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,580
I'm your downstairs neighbor,
and I'm there for you and

238
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:19,116
happy to help you in any way
I can if you need it, so...

239
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,684
Okay, that's nice...

240
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,286
Just knock on the door, let me
know.

241
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,088
- I will.
- Okay.

242
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:31,662
Anyway, listen, I gotta go.
But best to Aaron alright?

243
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,130
Okay, take care!

244
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,693
- Okay!
- Bye.

245
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,587
- Lily!
- God!

246
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,355
- Hi!
- Rochelle!

247
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:32,590
- How are you?
- How ya doin'?

248
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:33,857
I'm good.

249
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,659
I haven't seen you in so long.

250
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:38,729
I know.
I haven't been out in forever.

251
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,891
So what's been going on?
What have you been up to?

252
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,767
This, the show.

253
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,870
Awesome, and it looks great.
It's so cool.

254
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:52,376
Hey, did you happen to ask them
if they're hiring?

255
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,012
I did,
and there's still nothing,

256
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:57,014
but as soon as
something comes up,

257
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,177
you're the first person
I'm gonna let know.

258
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:14,632
Okay, Lily, it looks like you
are positive for the BRCA2 gene.

259
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:18,235
So, we generally recommend
a prophylactic mastectomy.

260
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,804
Okay, that's not really an
option.

261
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,874
It's totally understandable.
It won't prevent

262
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,043
the other cancers
from developing.

263
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:30,414
But what it does mean is that
we need to increase surveillance

264
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:34,385
of the development of breast
cancer. And the other cancers.

265
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:39,890
So that you need to do a monthly
self-examination, okay?

266
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,927
You need to visit
your doctor every six months,

267
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,263
for them to examine you
to look for

268
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,198
any lumps or abnormal tissue.

269
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,769
You'll need an annual mammogram.

270
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,371
And you'll probably need
a pelvic ultrasound

271
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,874
to screen for ovarian cancer.

272
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,676
- Okay.
- Okay?

273
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,845
The BRCA2 status
does not mean that

274
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,448
you are destined
to develop cancers.

275
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:08,385
It does increase your risk of
developing a second cancer

276
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,354
quite significantly.

277
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,691
So what we do recommend,

278
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:16,794
we want to make sure that
all at risk family members

279
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:20,264
are aware of their status or
the possibility of their status.

280
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,466
So we know that your mother,

281
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:25,169
when she was diagnosed
with breast cancer,

282
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,404
she got the BRCA testing
and she was negative?

283
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:28,472
Right.

284
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:33,844
So this means that you inherited
the gene from your father.

285
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:37,881
Okay? So we do recommend
that you inform him

286
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:41,952
and other family members
of the possibility that

287
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,420
they may be BRCA positive.

288
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:46,757
And especially him because we
know that he is positive.

289
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,325
I don't know...

290
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,328
My dad and I don't really
talk all that much.

291
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,131
Okay, it's totally
understandable.

292
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:57,134
We do offer a generic letter
notifying family members

293
00:28:57,136 --> 00:29:00,771
of the possibility
of their BRCA status.

294
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:07,478
The reason why we recommend
it strongly in this case

295
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,914
is that the risk in men
is also significant

296
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,250
for developing
male breast cancer.

297
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,786
Earlier onset prostate cancer,

298
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,988
and pancreatic cancer.

299
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,759
And male breast cancer
often goes undiagnosed

300
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,232
I've been listening to that tape
you gave me all the time.

301
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,035
Yeah? You like it?
Yeah, I love it, it's awesome.

302
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,236
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

303
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,339
I feel like it's great.

304
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:58,542
Yeah, I've been spending
a lot of time at home

305
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:01,144
labeling all my old tapes
and trying to figure out

306
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,046
which ones are my favorites.

307
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,984
I don't know, I'd like
to do something with them.

308
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:08,552
I think they're cool.

309
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:10,754
Well, guess who I ran into
the other day?

310
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,255
Who?

311
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:13,557
Patrick.

312
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:15,632
He asked about you.

313
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,094
He did?

314
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,229
Does he know...?

315
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:21,031
Yeah, he does.

316
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,003
I think that
you should go see him.

317
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,574
Yeah,
but I kind of screwed him over.

318
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:31,775
Yeah, you did!

319
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:37,381
You're not the first artist
ever to fuck up, I don't think.

320
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,143
- I'm not?
- Chances are!

321
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,152
Other people fuck up besides me?

322
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,123
What are you doing on Friday?

323
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,425
- On Friday?
- Yeah, at night.

324
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:52,295
Night? Oh! Night time, no.
I'm really busy.

325
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,399
Seriously, there's a movie
coming on I wanna watch

326
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:58,402
and I bought some new jammies,
I really wanna break 'em in.

327
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:03,073
Dylan's having people over
and I think you should come.

328
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,608
- Aw, Dylan!
- Yeah.

329
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,110
- I haven't seen him in forever.
- I know.

330
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,612
And he loves you...

331
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,647
He's a great guy.

332
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:15,819
I was trying to get Lily to come
to Dylan's party on Friday.

333
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:18,155
- Yeah, you should go.
- Are you going?

334
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:20,637
No, but I doubt your boyfriend
would have a problem with it,

335
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,794
seeing as how he's tucked
in about eight every night?

336
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:25,095
John!

337
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,732
I'm not supposed to...

338
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,700
Don't listen to him!

339
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:34,438
No, he's not that...
you're not that far off, yeah.

340
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,307
8:30, it's a Friday night.
Give him some credit.

341
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,476
That's when "Golden Girls"
is finished.

342
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:41,144
- Yeah...
- Okay, that's enough!

343
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:42,446
- Okay I'm done!
- That's enough.

344
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:43,780
- Leave us alone please!
- I'm will.

345
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,216
Bye! So great to see you!

346
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,417
I'm sorry.

347
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,820
- Hey, no...
- He has some problems.

348
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,556
You know, I like mysteries.

349
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:30,227
I don't know whether you know
or not, but these guys know.

350
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,829
I really like mysteries and

351
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,265
this library down here
on the corner...

352
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:38,869
One day I was wondering, why
are there so few mysteries here?

353
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:41,538
I have some of my favorites:

354
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:45,408
Simenon, Ruth Rendell,
P.D. James, those people...

355
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:50,747
And I realized, I was looking
through Literature one day,

356
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:54,217
those same names
are showing up in Literature!

357
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:58,355
Why do you have a P.D. James
that was published in 1980

358
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:02,259
in Mystery, and one that was
published in 1983 in Literature?

359
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,828
It doesn't...
she's the same writer.

360
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,898
And they don't seem
to know anything about it

361
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,367
or how it got that way...
Now there's a case to be made

362
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:13,170
that some writers
wrote better books than...

363
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:15,472
Graham Greene
wrote entertainments.

364
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,941
And maybe they're a little less
than some of his bigger books

365
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,943
but...

366
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:23,346
I don't think they deserve
a different classification.

367
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,381
Yeah...

368
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,584
- Frustrating.
- Yeah, yeah.

369
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,820
I don't know, it's useless
to talk to them, they don't...

370
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,524
So congratulations
are going to be in order soon.

371
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,459
Your treatment's almost over,
correct?

372
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:37,827
That is correct, sir!

373
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,366
Aaron, any big plans
for this young lady

374
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,502
when she wraps things up?

375
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,238
We talked about maybe
going away next month.

376
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,907
What did you do, Nell when
you finished your treatment?

377
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,843
Gosh, let's see...

378
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,848
I think that we just had
a nice quiet evening at home?

379
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,610
Neil?

380
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,385
I don't remember.

381
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,759
Oh Neil, I couldn't help
but notice the plants

382
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,294
in the corner of the room.

383
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,463
Really livens this place up...

384
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,298
That was
your mother's contribution.

385
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,434
I let her have that corner
for herself.

386
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,503
Oh wow, you got a whole corner!

387
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,439
Your mother's very expressive.

388
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,808
Yes, I am.

389
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,712
I think they just really add
so much life to the room.

390
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:32,916
I'm thinking about putting some
over in that window area.

391
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,018
- Two, I thought...
- Wow.

392
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,921
I think this is enough for now.

393
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,423
Well, we will see about that.

394
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,292
Won't we?

395
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,929
Would anyone like
some more coffee?

396
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,731
I'm good. Thank you.

397
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,501
- I'll have some, thanks.
- Okay.

398
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,036
Be right back.

399
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,245
Yeah?

400
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,854
Let's see whatcha got.

401
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:22,058
We were able to retrieve
five eggs during the procedure.

402
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,528
As I explained last time,
we like to get 15 eggs,

403
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,997
but five viable eggs is great.

404
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,099
Okay?

405
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:31,134
And they will stay frozen

406
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,103
until such time that
you are ready to have children

407
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:34,571
at some point in the future.

408
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:36,573
But that's assuming I can have
kids?

409
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,042
Well, that's a fair question.

410
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:44,080
When a young woman is forced
into an early menopause,

411
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:45,949
she can regain her cycle,

412
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:49,719
and yet,
still not be able to conceive.

413
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:55,425
Now. You on the other hand,
have done all the right things.

414
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:57,494
You've taken the right steps
to ensure that,

415
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:59,796
should you be able
to have children in the future,

416
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,098
you have eggs in storage
that can be fertilized.

417
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,401
And Lily, that's a good thing.

418
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,506
- Lily! Lily!
- Woah!

419
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,109
Hey,
what are you guys doing here?

420
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,077
Our mom dropped us off.

421
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,612
Oh yeah? What happened?

422
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,014
Yeah, Andrea had an emergency.

423
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:52,215
She asked me
if I could take care of them.

424
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:53,950
Oh, okay.

425
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,454
Sit down, kids.
Come on, dinner's ready.

426
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,556
Hi, is this Sharon?

427
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,051
Hi.

428
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:30,153
Sharon, my name is Lily Graham,

429
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,589
I'm trying to make
a payment on my account.

430
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:35,558
Right.

431
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:42,232
I'm calling to try and out what the lowest
payment I could make every month is...

432
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:46,135
I just need to set up
a payment plan or something?

433
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,606
Yeah but you guys have put me
on hold a lot already today,

434
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:51,541
so can we just...

435
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,777
Okay, but I just really
don't wanna go on hold...

436
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,407
You know what?
I just have to call you back.

437
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,518
I told you
I'd take care of it for you.

438
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,220
I know, we had this conversation
already and I don't want you to.

439
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:05,255
- Okay...
- Thank you.

440
00:42:05,257 --> 00:42:06,178
Suit yourself.

441
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:11,194
So, I invited
a few friends over for dinner.

442
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,195
Who?

443
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,198
Mary, Drew, Laura, Casey...

444
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,866
Aaron!

445
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,735
And who's gonna cook for them?

446
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,737
I thought maybe
you could cook for them?

447
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:21,765
Yeah?

448
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,308
- You love cooking.
- Oh I love cooking?

449
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,278
I feel like I never have
anything to say to your friends.

450
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,713
Just jump into the conversation.

451
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,715
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

452
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,242
So I went to Macy's this morning

453
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:35,979
and found the most beautiful
burgundy sweater.

454
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:37,614
Oh, I love burgundy on you.

455
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:38,815
Yeah, well good!

456
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:41,618
Because I put it on hold and

457
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,886
I'll probably
pick it up tomorrow.

458
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:45,221
Why would you put it on hold?

459
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:47,256
Oh, just to run it by Neil.

460
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,192
You know...

461
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,830
So, honey, you never called
to tell me

462
00:43:53,832 --> 00:43:55,798
what the doctor had to say.

463
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,300
Oh yeah...

464
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:02,839
Turns out that I do have
a genetic mutation, so...

465
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,007
Sorry.

466
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:06,342
Yeah, it just means that now

467
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:08,945
the odds of me getting
ovarian cancer go up,

468
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:11,047
and there's a possibility that

469
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,316
it might come back
in my other breast.

470
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,917
Yes, that's true,

471
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:17,353
but it's not a definite Lily.

472
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:19,989
Just 'cause you're carrying
the gene doesn't mean

473
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,325
you're going to get
breast cancer again honey.

474
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:25,061
I know, Mom.
That's exactly what I said.

475
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:26,829
It just means that
the odds are greater

476
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,731
and I have to be careful.

477
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:31,401
I just don't think
it does any good

478
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:34,904
to sit around and focus
on it "maybe" coming back.

479
00:44:34,906 --> 00:44:36,839
I'm not focusing on it.

480
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,941
I didn't even say
I was thinking about it.

481
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:42,211
I was just telling you
what the counselor told me.

482
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:43,880
Fine.

483
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,419
I'd really enjoy a glass of
wine.

484
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:51,087
May I have one please?

485
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:02,398
So, what are you fixing for
dinner?

486
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,466
Pasta.

487
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,340
Woah! Honey, do you always use
that much olive oil?

488
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:12,775
That's an awful lot.

489
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,110
It's fine, Mom.

490
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:24,387
You know they said
I should probably tell

491
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,322
Dad about the results.

492
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,425
Oh.

493
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,394
So what are you gonna do?

494
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,996
Well, I was thinking
about telling him.

495
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,735
I don't think
that's a good idea, honey.

496
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,403
You don't think it's ridiculous
that I have a father

497
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,338
that doesn't even know
I have breast cancer?

498
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,906
Of course I do.

499
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:47,910
But you know your father, Lily.
He's emotionally unavailable.

500
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,779
And that's why I married Neil.

501
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:53,049
But...

502
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:56,018
you do what you want.
You'll figure it out.

503
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:04,994
Oh, honey...

504
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:07,797
If you cut the tomato
the other way around,

505
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:08,600
it's so much easier.

506
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,366
It's fine, Mom.

507
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:11,501
Here...

508
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,871
Let me show you how.

509
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,811
- See, it's so much easier.
- Mom, it's fine.

510
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:24,080
I know, but the pieces are
so much nicer

511
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:25,782
and there are no seeds.

512
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:27,483
Mom, it's fine, I got it.

513
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:29,385
Seriously, Mom, it's fine!

514
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:32,822
Alright.

515
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:39,295
I was just trying to be helpful.

516
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,198
You know what?

517
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,801
I think
I'll have a glass of wine too.

518
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:46,964
But I thought
you weren't supposed to drink.

519
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:53,409
Well, in that case,
I'll have another one myself.

520
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,519
Cheers!

521
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,555
To your health, darling.

522
00:47:05,557 --> 00:47:06,923
Cheers.

523
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,028
Hi Nell!
What are you doing here?

524
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,263
Aaron,<i> bon soir.</i>

525
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,233
- So nice to see you!
- Lovely to see you too.

526
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,436
You're having a drink?

527
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:21,938
That's what I said.

528
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:26,475
Well you can't travel...

529
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:29,312
If you go up to Vermont,
you just drive...

530
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,266
You're investing in Harlem,
is that correct?

531
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:32,381
I did, yeah.

532
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,219
How many buildings did you buy?

533
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:39,121
- Put 'em in your pocket...
- Four or five buildings...

534
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,124
Accumulations...

535
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,492
Days...

536
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:51,234
to one's life,
to the beginning...

537
00:47:51,236 --> 00:47:53,135
A fruit or flower developing
and then there's a moment

538
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:55,204
where it starts to die...

539
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:58,474
With the harvest coming,
I would imagine you're...

540
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:01,644
Capturing the summit of...

541
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,647
whatever life is.

542
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:06,082
The essence!

543
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:09,151
The essence
of whatever something is,

544
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:11,921
like, in his case,
it's a body...

545
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:13,522
Captured something...

546
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:15,491
A young virgin.

547
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:17,293
He killed her...

548
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:22,598
No, but I refuse
to take the subway anymore.

549
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,434
It's a shithole. It's terrible.

550
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:27,637
- Trust me...
- I have little children...

551
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:29,972
Shows you how much time
you have left...

552
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:33,109
Yeah but it's funny because
I have little children...

553
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:36,512
My kids... it's 12, 11, 10, 9!

554
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,047
And we're counting
and we're running!

555
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:40,149
- And it's kind of a game!
- ...another 6 seconds...

556
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:42,585
They tell you
the next one's in five minutes.

557
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,154
- Oh yeah, of course...
- Sorry, my bad.

558
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:47,556
I'm trying to figure out
if they did it for the other...

559
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,259
I was invited...

560
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:53,029
my friend was doing
a production at the...

561
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:56,933
he has a gallery in the
Maison de Moliere in the bottom.

562
00:48:56,935 --> 00:49:03,706
And he asked an actor
from Ariane Mnouchkine's team

563
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:07,043
to come and direct
this piece about Molière,

564
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:08,311
and then...

565
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:10,179
I actually read about that.
Very interesting.

566
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,949
- Did you see the film?
- I did, I did.

567
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:16,185
And they were all running
up the stairs and, anyway...

568
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:22,291
So he invited me to come
and I stayed there,

569
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,528
and he had a loft, and
above his bed, it said "LOVE".

570
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,096
Wow!

571
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:29,365
Anyway,
and I was very, very happy...

572
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,134
It was in the summer months,
of course,

573
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:36,973
and I rode my bike often
from the Maison de Molière

574
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:40,209
to the Marais to get my tea,
or my cheese, or whatever.

575
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:43,546
- Yeah, very cute.
- That's so cute!

576
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,216
I was really happy,
and I felt like...

577
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:49,719
I don't know
I felt like Paris was...

578
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:53,089
might be supporting this moment?

579
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:56,525
And that I felt like my body
was in tune with Paris...

580
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,761
that the architecture fit...

581
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:03,199
How to say that? I know
that sounds stupid. It does!

582
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:07,303
- It does sound so stupid!
- But love is kind of crazy.

583
00:50:07,305 --> 00:50:11,207
But you know, it was a very good
beautiful moment in my life

584
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:13,776
and I sometimes replay it.

585
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:17,279
I mean, I don't know if he knew
that I was in love with him.

586
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:19,548
How could you not know?

587
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:21,650
Does one ever know?

588
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:23,586
Does one ever know?

589
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,293
Anyway...

590
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,262
And so then what happened?

591
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:37,299
Well, then a couple of years
later, time passed, I left,

592
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,268
I came back to New York.
And then...

593
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:43,205
I was invited to this castle,
everybody in Paris has a castle.

594
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,641
Everybody in Paris has a castle!

595
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:47,243
- No, it's true!
- No, it is true!

596
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:51,180
I've got a castle! I do!

597
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:53,182
Aaron's got a castle.

598
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:56,786
Mary's got a castle!

599
00:50:56,788 --> 00:51:00,322
Mary's got an apartment
in New York and a castle!

600
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:05,728
Yeah, it's great...
yeah it's true...

601
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,264
I fell in love in Paris.

602
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:11,300
The architecture fit my body...

603
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,203
Why is that funny to you?

604
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:19,341
Because!
"The architecture fit my body!"

605
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,844
That makes complete sense to me.

606
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,780
I mean you've been to Paris,
haven't you?

607
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:26,662
- You have to go.
- Seriously?

608
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:30,653
Maybe because you're married
I shouldn't bring it up...

609
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:31,520
Hello!

610
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,591
I'm sorry?

611
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,294
Are you just gonna light up
a cigarette without asking

612
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,830
if anyone's offended
or anything?

613
00:51:40,832 --> 00:51:43,332
Oh, I'm sorry,
does that bother you? The smoke?

614
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:46,268
No! It doesn't bother me
if you smoke!

615
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:50,306
No that's great, be comfortable!
Make yourself at home!

616
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:53,642
I'm gonna get comfortable too!
I'm gonna get comfortable too!

617
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:55,377
- Lily!
- It's great!

618
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:57,379
We're all comfortable now!

619
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:00,649
Everybody kick back and relax.
This is great.

620
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:04,520
Kick off your shoes.
Have a good time!

621
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:07,690
I think that
we should get going.

622
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:09,692
You guys don't have to go.

623
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:12,828
Thank you. We'll do this
again another time.

624
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,664
- Alright...
- Bye, Lily.

625
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,299
- See ya, Mary.
- Thank you...

626
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,268
See you around!

627
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:23,305
I'm so sorry, Lily, I apologize.
Thank you...

628
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,307
That's a real fun night.

629
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:11,513
Yeah?

630
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,350
Ahhhh...

631
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:18,454
I made an ass
out of myself last night.

632
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,289
Is Aaron upset?

633
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:27,263
I don't know if he's upset
so much as disappointed.

634
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:29,965
You know, I embarrassed him
in front of his friends.

635
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:32,968
What do you think's going on?

636
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,842
I mean, are you okay?

637
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:42,444
Not really.

638
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,381
I feel like I should be cause

639
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:48,350
everybody's so happy
for me right now.

640
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:49,752
They keep congratulating me

641
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:53,355
that treatments almost over,
but I don't feel happy about it.

642
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:57,526
I mean I feel like treatment
was kind of the easy part.

643
00:54:57,528 --> 00:54:59,628
God, I gotta find a job.

644
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,530
I have to start making money.

645
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:04,700
I have to think about
if I ever want kids.

646
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:06,869
- Aaron's just getting older!
- Okay...

647
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:09,371
I've got eggs
stored in a freezer!

648
00:55:09,373 --> 00:55:12,007
- I'm hungover!
- Okay, that's a lot of stuff!

649
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,443
You can't figure all that
out at once.

650
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:16,545
That would make me
feel crazy too.

651
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:18,414
It'd make anyone feel crazy.

652
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,084
Just pick one thing to start
with.

653
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,387
Did you go and see Patrick yet?

654
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:26,822
No...

655
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,526
- Well...
- No, no...

656
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:33,529
Well that's one thing
that you can do.

657
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,865
It's not easy,
but you do that one thing,

658
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:39,868
and then that leads
to the next thing...

659
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,371
Before you know it...

660
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:43,605
you're doin' things.

661
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,950
Hi...

662
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,095
<i>So they wanted me to go in</i>
<i>and fill out papers,</i>

663
00:58:53,097 --> 00:58:55,197
<i>I'm not filling out</i>
<i>any papers...</i>

664
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,633
<i>I just found that kitten</i>
<i>in the street just now.</i>

665
00:58:57,635 --> 00:58:59,234
<i>It might be yours.</i>

666
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:02,237
<i>It was only a few blocks</i>
<i>away from the ASPCA.</i>

667
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:05,908
<i>But they wanted me to go in</i>
<i>and then file some papers...</i>

668
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:08,277
<i>File some papers?</i>
<i>Get the hell outta here!</i>

669
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:13,549
<i>What?</i>
<i>Are they outta their minds?</i>

670
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:18,220
<i>I was thinking about keeping it</i>
<i>and taking it to you...</i>

671
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:19,221
<i>What color was it?</i>

672
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:23,859
<i>It had like a tiger stripe,</i>
<i>but brown and black.</i>

673
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:25,227
<i>It was a cute kitten, man.</i>

674
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:28,997
<i>Lemme call you back, alright?</i>

675
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,352
- Lemme call you back.
- I'll talk to you.

676
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,981
Hi, I was wondering
if Patrick is here?

677
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:47,517
Patrick.

678
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:48,750
Oh, Lily.

679
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,218
- Hey!
- Hey!

680
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,721
- How are you?
- Good. How's it goin'?

681
00:59:52,723 --> 00:59:55,257
- Good, good. C'mon back.
- Okay, thanks.

682
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,305
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you too.

683
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:02,965
I actually saw Emily the other
day and asked about you.

684
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:05,233
I know! She told me you guys
ran into each other.

685
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:06,836
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

686
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,805
Well, come on back.
Have a seat please.

687
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:11,073
Thank you.

688
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:13,775
Thank you.

689
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:20,182
Wow! That's really nice!

690
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:24,152
Yeah, so that's the same artist
that's out front:

691
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:25,654
Jessica Dickenson.

692
01:00:25,656 --> 01:00:30,392
And this work was actually done
entirely on the back.

693
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:32,928
So what you're seeing
is basically

694
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,197
what's bleeding
through the surface.

695
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,932
That's so cool.

696
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:41,336
She's really doing well in
galleries.

697
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:43,839
Thankfully doing well, so...

698
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:45,207
What brings you here?

699
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:50,412
I guess I just wanna know...

700
01:00:50,414 --> 01:00:54,783
Are you hiring here? Or do
you need help in the gallery?

701
01:00:54,785 --> 01:00:56,685
Or an assistant?

702
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:58,353
A job for you?

703
01:00:58,721 --> 01:00:59,481
Yeah.

704
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,257
Are you still making work?

705
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:06,294
I am actually.
I've been working a lot lately.

706
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:07,295
Yeah.

707
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,966
Well, I just...

708
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:13,088
Hope you can understand
it's kinda awkward

709
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,704
that you'd be asking me
for a job.

710
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:18,874
I understand that you need
to make ends meet and stuff,

711
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:23,378
but I just feel like it's
such a misuse of your talent

712
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,281
to be working
some administrative job here.

713
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:29,384
I feel like I'd be doing
you a favor, actually,

714
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:32,087
if I didn't offer you a job.

715
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:36,191
And, I hope
you can understand, you know?

716
01:01:57,247 --> 01:01:59,481
Hey! Chill out dude!

717
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:01,983
What the fuck is your problem?
Where are you going?

718
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:03,819
You scared the shit out of me!

719
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:05,954
- Fuck off, lady!
- You fuck off!

720
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:09,858
Good for you!

721
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,397
Asshole! You're stuck in
traffic now, you look stupid.

722
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:20,969
You believe this?

723
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:22,504
Well, you see on Broadway...

724
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:25,774
This fucking crazy guy
honking his horn like a nut!

725
01:02:25,776 --> 01:02:29,344
You should go see how they block
off. Every day they blockoff.

726
01:02:29,346 --> 01:02:31,079
It's fucking crazy!

727
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,848
Yeah, you're right!
Everybody's crazy!

728
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:33,949
Yeah!

729
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,821
Well, I got this asshole
honking at me!

730
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:41,923
And now he's stuck in traffic!

731
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,258
Schmuck!

732
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:45,927
God!

733
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,510
- Hey!
- Oh, Lily!

734
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,815
- Dylan!
- Lily! Oh my God!

735
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:09,451
I can't believe you're here!

736
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,386
You made it. You made it.

737
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:15,157
It's so great to see you,
it's so great to see you.

738
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:17,459
- It's good to see you too!
- How you doing? Good?

739
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:18,493
- Alright.
- Awesome.

740
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:19,861
Do you want a drink?

741
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:21,329
- Water?
- Water?

742
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:22,831
- Yeah water.
- Is that what you drink now?

743
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:25,801
- That's my thing!
- Water's my thing too!

744
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:29,337
Water or I drink olive oil too,
but tonight I'm drinking water.

745
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,438
So I'll join you in the water.

746
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,107
Have you seen Emily?

747
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:35,977
Because I don't like to leave
the house and so I invite them.

748
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:39,114
But I don't even want to
see them! They just come here!

749
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:40,549
And then you come in here!

750
01:03:40,551 --> 01:03:43,318
No, then I take what I call
"the chosen ones"...

751
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:44,953
Oh wow!

752
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:47,155
And then I invite them
into my realm.

753
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:49,524
- But I've always been like...
- Private party...?

754
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:52,861
I've always been like this,
even when I was a kid.

755
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:55,497
I would lock the door and my
parents would bang on the door,

756
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,098
and they would try and get in
and I'd say,

757
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,334
"You can't come in,
this is my sacred place!"

758
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:02,604
Finally they'd say,

759
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:05,874
"We don't care about your sacred
place, you're grounded!

760
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:09,878
They tried way too hard and
they could never get it right.

761
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,414
And as a result,
we're not even that close.

762
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,482
But you must be close
to your parents

763
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:19,955
My dad, I haven't even talked to
him in years so I feel like...

764
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:23,225
Even now?
Like with all this stuff?

765
01:04:23,227 --> 01:04:25,594
No! We haven't talked in years.
Years!

766
01:04:25,596 --> 01:04:27,462
I know but this is like...

767
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,197
You can't...

768
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,433
Lily, this is some real shit,
you know?

769
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:33,902
I know, but what do, you just
call somebody

770
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:37,105
you haven't talked to
in so long and say,

771
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:41,176
"Oh hey, it's been awhile.
I have cancer."

772
01:04:41,178 --> 01:04:43,211
- You haven't called him?
- No.

773
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,146
You should call him for money!

774
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,149
I mean how are you gonna
pay your bills?

775
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,484
How can you not tell your dad?

776
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:52,053
I've been thinking about
telling him cause

777
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:55,924
I feel like
it's kind of ridiculous...

778
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,373
It is kind of ridiculous
that you haven't told him.

779
01:04:58,427 --> 01:04:59,995
I know, but...

780
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:03,064
And not to mention
it's kind of ridiculous that you

781
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,667
continue to wear that wig.

782
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:07,135
Is it ridiculous?

783
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:09,037
Kind of!

784
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,606
I know "this" is ridiculous
and doesn't look like my hair.

785
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,008
No it doesn't.

786
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:14,943
- But it's so...
- You.

787
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:18,280
Different from what you guys,
no! My hair underneath!

788
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:20,649
So she has hair
underneath the wig?

789
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:24,286
Because when you get radiation,
it starts to grow back.

790
01:05:24,288 --> 01:05:25,620
It's when you're on chemo that

791
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:27,322
it falls out
and it's not growing.

792
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:30,125
- Are you a magician...?
- Is it anything like this?

793
01:05:30,127 --> 01:05:32,193
It can't be worse
than this, right?

794
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:33,695
Look! And this is genetic.

795
01:05:33,697 --> 01:05:37,966
I didn't have to go to the
hospital to get this to happen.

796
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:41,603
- Will you just take it off?
- It looks really cute.

797
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:43,605
- Come on.
- We should just see it.

798
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:45,640
- It looks sweet.
- Take it off...

799
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:47,242
She's gonna do it!
She's gonna do it!

800
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:50,111
- Oh my God!
- This is so embarrassing!

801
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:50,979
I'm not watching you intently.

802
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:52,514
Yes, I am.

803
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,184
Woah!

804
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,420
- Look at you!
- That looks amazing.

805
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:00,488
- It's so short!
- So what? It looks incredible!

806
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:01,656
It used to be so long.

807
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:05,493
But it's not,
it used to be so long though!

808
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:07,495
I've been hiding it
while it grows back in.

809
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:09,965
I don't have a problem...

810
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:15,537
Look if it makes you feel
better, I'll go out like this.

811
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:16,705
You have to go out like that!

812
01:06:16,707 --> 01:06:18,506
- Okay.
- Oh my god!

813
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:20,241
It looks way better on you!

814
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:22,610
I can't believe
that you wear this wig.

815
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:25,180
I'm just not...
Never again. Never again.

816
01:06:25,182 --> 01:06:27,215
This is so much...
You're beautiful.

817
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:29,985
You need to continue wearing
that wig, I'm can say that.

818
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:31,152
That looks amazing on you.

819
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,554
- That is...
- This wig...

820
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:35,724
- Seriously!
- I have to say...

821
01:06:35,726 --> 01:06:39,694
I love it on him, are you
kidding me! Put it back on!

822
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:43,164
Someone is getting laid tonight.
Lemme tell you.

823
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:46,234
- On the safe bed...
- It could be the wig.

824
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:47,702
In the safety zone!

825
01:06:47,704 --> 01:06:51,539
I'm gonna fuck this wig.

826
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:54,009
Oh, you're laughing
at that, right?

827
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:06,241
<i>Yeah, I think</i>
<i>that's the happiness of it.</i>

828
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:09,410
<i>That's the being alive of it.</i>

829
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,847
<i>Being born again every day...</i>

830
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:17,418
<i>Well, you're constantly</i>
<i>being born and dying,</i>

831
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:21,489
<i>and born, and dying, and born,</i>
<i>and dying and born...</i>

832
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:25,927
<i>I feel like once you lose that</i>
<i>way of looking at the world,</i>

833
01:09:25,929 --> 01:09:27,462
<i>when you lose that sense of</i>

834
01:09:27,464 --> 01:09:29,464
<i>wonderment about</i>
<i>the things around you,</i>

835
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:31,366
<i>what do you have left?</i>

836
01:09:31,368 --> 01:09:34,369
<i>Well, you've got...</i>

837
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:38,773
<i>You've got stocks, you've got</i>
<i>bonds, you got shoes, you got...</i>

838
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:41,709
<i>And you need</i>
<i>more and more of it.</i>

839
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,379
<i>You know,</i>

840
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:47,448
<i>you ain't got nothin',</i>
<i>but you got a lot of shit.</i>

841
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:06,935
Dad!

842
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:11,472
Jeff!

843
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:14,909
Hi...

844
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:17,706
Lily.

845
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:19,280
Hey.

846
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:24,485
How are you?

847
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,288
I'm good, how are you?

848
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:28,389
Well, thanks.

849
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,892
Good to see you.

850
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:47,742
Thank you.

851
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:58,353
Oh...

852
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,022
I made this for you.

853
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,220
- You made this?
- Yeah.

854
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:09,764
It's not bad.

855
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,041
You cut your hair,
I almost didn't recognize you.

856
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:23,544
I think you look better
with longer hair.

857
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,446
Thanks.

858
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:31,953
So it's been awhile.

859
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:32,954
Yeah.

860
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:38,826
It's been three years.

861
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,796
Well, you haven't called me.

862
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:47,802
Well, you could try calling me
too. Works both ways...

863
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,673
When I didn't hear
from you, I just assumed

864
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:53,841
you didn't have anything to say.

865
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,345
So that's it?

866
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:02,850
Three years and you don't have
anything else to say to me?

867
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,322
What do you want me to say,
Lily?

868
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:09,924
I don't know. How about:

869
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:12,694
"How's your life been?

870
01:12:12,696 --> 01:12:15,963
"What's been going on?
What have you been up to?

871
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,701
"I really wonder what
my only child has been up to?"

872
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:23,004
Look, I have a lot of stuff
I need to do today.

873
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,747
Oh, okay.

874
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:38,586
Was there something you wanted?

875
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:40,521
Why did you come to see me?

876
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:44,125
I came to see you
because you're my dad.

877
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:51,766
I'll show myself out.

878
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:55,470
Great seeing you.

879
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:58,940
I'm glad you're well.

880
01:12:58,942 --> 01:12:59,907
Thanks.

881
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:58,759
- Hello!
- Hi!

882
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:02,263
So?

883
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,232
Done!

884
01:15:04,234 --> 01:15:05,266
Yeah.

885
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,568
And how do you feel about it?

886
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:08,610
I don't know yet...

887
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:10,605
I'm not sure.

888
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:13,241
Lemme take one last look
at the radiation burn.

889
01:15:13,243 --> 01:15:15,610
I hope we didn't damage you
too badly.

890
01:15:15,612 --> 01:15:17,812
I don't think you did.

891
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,681
I was using the aloe
the whole time so...

892
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,050
- Okay.
- I feel like it did okay.

893
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:25,286
It looks pretty good.

894
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:27,722
Mild erythema
but no pustules. That's good.

895
01:15:27,724 --> 01:15:28,556
Good.

896
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,991
It's gonna heal

897
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:32,660
on its own pretty much,
but it's healing well.

898
01:15:32,662 --> 01:15:33,661
- Yeah?
- Yep.

899
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,630
You're young...

900
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:37,932
Well, are your big plans now?

901
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,603
I guess just take it
one day at a time.

902
01:15:42,605 --> 01:15:44,639
Smart answer.

903
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,208
So we're going to see you
in about six months...

904
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:47,808
Okay.

905
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,711
You're gonna go to the front
desk and make an appointment.

906
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,147
- You'll be well.
- Thank you.

907
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,330
- See you.
- Thanks.

908
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,072
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

909
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,324
- How much is it again?
- Eleven fifty.

910
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:57,011
<i>- Bonjour!</i>
<i>- Salut!</i>

911
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:03,250
- How was your day?
- Great.

912
01:17:03,252 --> 01:17:06,020
- You must be happy it's over.
- Yeah.

913
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,190
I'll just take my jacket off,
I'll be right back.

914
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:21,702
I know you don't want
to celebrate, but I thought

915
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:23,304
maybe we could go out
for dinner tomorrow?

916
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:25,206
Maybe grab some sushi?

917
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:29,043
Yeah, maybe.

918
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,381
I got some good news. I was
offered a job for two weeks

919
01:17:33,383 --> 01:17:35,216
in Paris next month.

920
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,121
It's actually great
because I thought we could

921
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,390
make it coincide
with the trip we were planning.

922
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:44,725
Have you thought more
about our trip?

923
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:58,406
Lily, have you thought
more about our trip?

924
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,113
Lily?

925
01:20:56,552 --> 01:20:59,954
- Lily, hey, you're back.
- Yeah.

926
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:03,057
I don't have too much time,
I have some people in the back.

927
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:04,859
Can I just steal you
for a second?

928
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:05,926
Sure.

929
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:10,564
The other day I came in here,
I asked you for a job,

930
01:21:10,566 --> 01:21:12,533
I have no idea
what I was thinking.

931
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:15,236
That's not what
I wanted to ask you.

932
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:18,272
I wanted to know
if you would come by

933
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:21,008
and take at look at
what I've been working on.

934
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:24,578
I don't know, Lily, you know...

935
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:26,881
I know I fucked up.

936
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:28,449
And I'm sorry.

937
01:21:28,451 --> 01:21:30,217
I'm really sorry.

938
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:33,487
I just want you to come by
and take a look.

939
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:37,591
That's it, just take a look
at what I've been working on.

940
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,029
Alright well, why don't you
give me a ring tomorrow

941
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:45,132
and we'll see if we can schedule
something for next week.

942
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,166
Yeah?

943
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:48,235
Yeah, let's give it a try.

944
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:51,105
- Okay, so, next week?
- Next week.

945
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:54,909
Yay! Thank you Patrick!
Thank you!
