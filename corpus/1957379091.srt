We're trying our best.

196
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:27,158
What can you do with just

197
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:30,118
a couple of broken-down horses?

198
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,772
I'm concentrating more on my

199
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,817
handicapping...

200
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,123
which I know you wouldn't

201
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,299
approve of, Mama, but how else

202
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:38,561
can we make ends meet?

[door creaking]

204
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,477
Hey Danny, loan me a 20, huh?

205
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,131
Sorry, I don't got.

206
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:45,176
I've seen your winnings.

Empty, see?

208
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:48,528
What about that one

right there?

210
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:51,095
Our savings, Eddie?

211
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,706
Come on, just 'til tomorrow.

212
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:53,881
Look, if we're ever going to

213
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:55,012

214
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:55,926
our budget--

215
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,319
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just give--

Absolutely, positively not

You know what your trouble

is?

220
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,804
You're too old for your age.

221
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,289
Gonna be a late night.

222
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,290
Nah, I got that meeting in

223
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,118
the morning with Cornell Baynes.

224
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:15,206

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,991
Yep.

227
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:17,644
That's what he wanted

228
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:18,340
to talk about?

229
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:19,254
Yeah.

230
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:20,560
And you're going out tonight?

231
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:21,691
Just a couple of beers

with the guys.

233
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,128
Nothing doing.

234
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,260
A meeting like that, you need

235
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:26,609
a good night's rest.

236
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,132
Hey, who's the adult here

Eddie and me, we're doing okay.

241

Solly here tells me you've

242
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,332
got the magic touch, Eddie.

243
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,550
That so?

I-- I don't know about magic.

One fine horseman.

John was the best.

He trained Wild Wonder,

251
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:48,996
Yes, sir.

What a horse!

He would've beat 'em all

in the Tucker Stakes

256
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:54,349
if he'd had the chance.

257
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:55,567
Oh, terrible tragedy,

that car wreck.

00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,657
John and Molly, they were

00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:00,660

Well, to business.

265
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:10,931
Eddie, I grabbed a little filly

266
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:12,410
at auction last summer.

267
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,238
Good price, good blood.

268
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:15,544
Now, she don't do much

269
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:16,240
in the morning.

270
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:17,764
She's a real loafer.

271
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:19,287
And Solly doesn't have time

272
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,462
to mess with the horse,

273
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:22,116
so we, uh, you know...

274
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,465
We figure we're gonna take

275

00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:28,035
Then bring her back in,

279
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:30,080
sell her off real fast.

280
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:32,082
I told Mr. Baynes Eddie

282
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:35,303
Well, I'm-- I'm flattered.

283
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:37,305
I told Mr. Baynes, "I don't

Why don't you just get

your trainer's license?

293
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:58,108
Oh, yeah, I can show these

Besides, you need a horse

00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:12,557
before you can train it.

302
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:16,779

311
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,883

I keep dreaming about

00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,941
this house.

00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:51,118
Not a fancy house,

321
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:54,948
just a house with real plumbing,

322
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:57,994
fireplace, some wall-to-wall

323
00:12:58,038 --> 00:12:59,082
carpeting.

Yep.

00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,964
One horse could do it, Gerald.

Then we'd own a dozen champions.

00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:29,809
No reason it can't come true.

00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:34,639
that's for sure.

344
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:36,946
You don't want to know.

Hmm.

00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,428
any worse I may have to go live

348
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:42,647
with my old Grandma Temple.

349
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:45,041
That a bad thing?

350
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:47,174
I'd rather be boiled in oil.

00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,395
I'm saving up money and soon

352
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:52,353
I'll be old enough to get

00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:53,702
a real job.

00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:56,531
Yeah, things'll work out.

355
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,750
All you need is a little luck

356
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:00,622
and a little magic.

357
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:01,753
Magic?

358
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:02,929
You mean, like all that stuff

359
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:04,278
in fairy tale books like

360
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:05,670
wishing on a star?

361
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:06,976
That's the very thing

362
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,369
I'm talking about.

363
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,547
That stuff's for babies.

364
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,462
Babies, huh?

365
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:15,898
[scoffs] Come on over here.

366
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:16,899
I can tell I've got some

367
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:18,988
educating to do.

368
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:20,816
Now, grab hold of this wood

369
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,036
and say after me:

370
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,821
Rub on wood, sure to come good.

371
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,909
This is silly.

372
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:28,128
Don't silly me, now.

373
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:29,085
Just grab hold.

374
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:30,217
I'm gonna get splinters.

375
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,131
No, you won't either.

376
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:33,133
Now just grab hold like I said.

377
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:35,265
Come on.

378
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,527
Now close your eyes, this is

00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:38,399
the important part, all right?

382
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,797
with me, okay?

383
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:46,581
All right.

384
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,322

00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:17,337
mash tonight, Gerald,

769
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,425
'cause she done good.

770
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:20,253
Oh, Solly was right, Eddie.

771
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:22,298
You do have a special way.

772
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:23,473
Well, she just needed some

773
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:24,823
attention and proper shoeing.

774
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:25,606
[chuckling]

775
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:26,476
Isn't he modest?

776
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,260
A little something for your

777
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:28,087
trouble, Eddie.

778
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,175
Meet me at the Turf Club

779
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:32,221
someday, I'll buy you a drink.

780
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:33,266
Baynes is pleased.

781
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:34,833
I told you this would be

782
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,095
a cinch.

783
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:37,487
Thanks for the help, Solly.

784
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:38,575
I owe you one.

785
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:40,055
Hey, now, all I did was

786
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:41,709
give you the opportunity.

787
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,058
Just like I'd done with your

788
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:44,016
brother John.

789
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:45,408
Little nudge here, little

790
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:47,019
schmooze there, but Johnny

791
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:48,411
did the work.

792
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:50,239
John was the best, wasn't he?

793
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,153
Now, don't you sell

794
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:52,720
yourself short, Eddie.

795
00:30:52,763 --> 00:30:53,939
You know these horses like

796
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:55,201
you was one of 'em.

797
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,419
Now I'll tell you something--

798
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:57,420
Baynes seen what you done

799
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:58,944
with that hard luck case.

800
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,902
Next time the right opportunity

801
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:03,209
comes up, Big Solly gonna make

802
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:06,038
sure you are in.

803
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:07,778
Thanks, Solly.

804
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:09,476
Thanks.

805
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:15,351
Doggone it!

806
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:17,049
I'm gone one week, I got two

807
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:18,528
horses: one's got the cough,

808
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:19,878
the other needs a dentist.

809
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:22,968
Doc says a lot of that

810
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:23,882
going around, Eddie.

811
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,145
Oh, great, that's just great.

812
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:27,624
And the feed guy says

813
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:28,582
he's not making another delivery

814
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,931
until he gets paid.

815
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:37,808
Well, easy come, easy go.

816
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,641
What else?

817
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:46,295
I gotta leave you.

818
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:47,166
I got an offer I can't

819
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:48,428
turn down.

820
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:49,733
From who?

821
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:51,605
Harland MacVie's barn.

822
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:55,348
Harland MacVie.

823
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:56,740
Slauson Farms is a top

824
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:57,959
outfit; they're having

825
00:31:58,003 --> 00:31:59,874
a great meet.

826
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,008
I got a wife, a new baby boy.

827
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:06,750
Hey, Charlie, you ever notice

828
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:07,969
that sometimes you just can't

829
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:09,449
get ahead for trying?

830
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,757
Hey, Eddie.

831
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:15,107
Hey, Danny.

832
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:18,806
Well?

833
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:19,546
Well, what?

834
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:20,764
How did it go?

835
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:21,765
It went.

836
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:22,810
Did you eat your supper?

837
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:23,942
Yes.

838
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:24,812
Did she win?

839
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:25,944
Did the filly get her win?

840
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:26,640
Yeah.

841
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:27,380
No corn dogs?

842
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:28,598
Uh-uh. Is Baynes happy?

843
00:32:28,642 --> 00:32:29,686
Ecstatic.

844
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,470
Can we go check out

845
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:31,471
Tom Thumb?

846
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:33,125
No.

847
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,259
I must be out of my mind,

848
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:38,304
dragging a little girl around

849
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:39,348
a race circuit like this.

850
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:40,088
Eddie!

851
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:41,002
You should be in a nice

852
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:42,047
neighborhood in a nice school

853
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,178
and playing with kids your own

854
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:43,874
age.

855
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:44,832
Listen, I'm doing--

856
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:45,920
You're turning into a track

857
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,096
degenerate right before my eyes.

858
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,272
Betting and spying and trying

859
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:51,926
to buy a horse with no money.

860
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,449
I've got news on that.

861
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:54,320
Look, we're not gonna take

862
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:55,451
a look at this horse, okay?

863
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:56,757
Or any horse, for that matter,

864
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,584
you understand?

865
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:58,933
You don't have to yell,

866
00:32:58,977 --> 00:32:59,673
you know.

867
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:00,587
I'm not yelling, but the

868
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,588
thing is we're barely hanging on

869
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:03,329
here, so no more talk about

870
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:06,027
Tom Thumb, okay?

871
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:06,897
You wish I wasn't here,

872
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:08,029
Eddie, is that it?

873
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,466
Yeah, sometimes.

874
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:21,695
No, no, that's not what I meant.

875
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:24,741
Look, hey...

876
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:26,787
Hey, hey, look here, come here.

877
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:29,355
You're the best thing in my

878
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:31,792
whole life.

879
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:33,054
I wouldn't trade you for

880
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:34,664
a million dollars.

881
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,057
No kidding?

882
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,624
No kidding.

883
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:38,929
Two million, maybe.

884
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:40,192
Oh, no, no, all right,

885
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:40,931
all right, three million,

886
00:33:40,975 --> 00:33:42,281
not a penny less.

887
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:45,806
I'm just not sure how good a job

888
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:47,416
I'm doing sometimes.

889
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,852
You're doing fine.

890
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:51,203
Yeah, well...

891
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:52,508
What your papa always used

892
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:54,945
to say: "If you don't know what

893
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:56,730
the best thing to do is,

894
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:58,427
just keep on doing what you know

895
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:01,561
how to do best."

896
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:02,910
All we need is a little luck,

897
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:04,085
that's all.

898
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:05,652
Mmm.

899
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:06,566
Luck ain't been much of a

900
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:08,046
factor around here lately.

901
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:10,048
That's the thing about luck:

902
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:11,745
it favors the long shot.

903
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,053
It favors the long shot.

904
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:19,100
Yeah, maybe it wouldn't hurt

905
00:34:19,144 --> 00:34:19,927
to take just a little peek

906
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,059
at that racehorse.

907
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,103
It wouldn't hurt at all.

908
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:24,018
It might give us some ideas.

909
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,368
Lots of ideas.

910
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:28,109
Hey, Eddie, you left

911
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,285
your tack over at Baynes'.

912
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:33,506
Well, look who just showed up

913
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:35,551
at the perfect moment.

914
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,078
What?

915
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,428
Gillespie Fields is in Ohio?

916
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:43,907
Kentucky isn't the only place

917
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:44,865
they race horses,

918
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:46,562
just seems that way.

919
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:47,694
I can't believe we're

920
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:49,174
doing this.

921
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,310
I don't mind telling you,

922
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:56,746
anybody catches us in here

923
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,314
we in a pot full of trouble.

924
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:00,750
Hey, Tom, it's me.

925
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:01,403
Come on, let's take

926
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:02,622
a look at you.

927
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:07,931
His hooves are kind of narrow.

928
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:08,802
He's a little over

929
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:09,716
at the knee.

930
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:12,849
His daddy was just like that.

931
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:14,590
Keltic Tom was a big horse.

932
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:15,939
Sixteen-two.

933
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:16,853
Wish he had a little more

934
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:17,941
slope to his shoulder.

935
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:19,595
Barely 16 hands.

936
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,554
But I'd expect his stoutness

937
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:23,382
makes up for the squareness.

938
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:24,513
His forelegs look strong

939
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:25,906
enough, though.

940
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:28,387
Eddie, I think Danny found

941
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,824
a real horse.

942
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:31,912
Huh.

943
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:34,088
Well, he's running tomorrow.

944
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:34,915
Tomorrow?

945
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:35,655
What kind of race?

946
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:37,526
$7,000 claiming race,

947
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,745
first time three-year-olds.

948
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:40,921
That's pretty cheap.

949
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:42,096
Does MacVie really think

950
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,619
nobody's gonna claim this horse?

951
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:44,838
At Gillespie Fields?

952
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,579
The stands are populated with

953
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:47,797
pet food reps.

954
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:49,147
Nobody's gonna pay seven bits

955
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,930
for a couple of cans of

956
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:50,931
dog food.

957
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:51,932
Then why?

958
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:53,107
Oh, who knows why these big

959
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,413
barns do anything?

960
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:55,588
They got all them charts

961
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:57,155
and fancy guys with calculators

962
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,330
working out things for 'em.

963
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:00,506
[chuckles] Some horsemen, eh?

964
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:04,249
This is crazy.

965
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:06,555
We don't have $7,000.

966
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,428
Yeah, we have 3,900 saved up.

967
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,387
3,900?

968
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:14,433
That little girl

969
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:17,218
knows her horses. [chuckling]

970
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:18,567
I hit the Pick Six.

971
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:19,786
Tried to tell you.

972
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:23,355
Yeah, well, uh...

973
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:24,443
that still leaves us short.

974
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:25,879
I only got 1,100.

975
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:27,576
Feed man took the rest of what

976
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,882
I got from Baynes.

977
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:30,710
I'm sorry, Danny, I really am

978
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:31,711
because I'm impressed.

979
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:32,581
You picked a real good horse

980
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:33,626
here.

981
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:39,327
My mom would say, "No sense

982
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:40,372
waiting for the apple to fall

983
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:41,329
when it's right there in front

984
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:43,288
of you, ready for picking."

985
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:45,203
I've been saving my pennies.

986
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:46,116
Wait a second, Gerald--

987
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,379
Now I don't have much,

988
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:49,207
but it's enough to stake you

989
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,600
the difference.

990
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:52,906
I can't borrow that money

991
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,168
from you.

992
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,952
I wasn't intending on loaning

993
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:57,693
you money, Eddie.

994
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:59,695
I want in as a partner.

995
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:02,916
Unless you got some problem

996
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:03,960
with that.

997
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:15,711
I got no problem.

998
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:17,974
All right! Yes!

999
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:25,765
Need to see your trainer's

1000
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:26,983
license.

1001
00:37:30,987 --> 00:37:33,555
Claim for yourself, Mr., uh...

1002
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,861
Fortuna?

1003
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:36,863
Yeah, it's for me.

1004
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:39,082
Uh, for us.

1005
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:40,475
For-- yeah, for me, I guess,

1006
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:41,171
yeah.

1007
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:44,218
[clears throat]

1008
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,785
We need a 10% deposit

1009
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:46,742
in cash.

1010
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:48,178
Danny.

1011
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:58,450
One, two, three, four, five,

1012
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:00,495
six, seven.

1013
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:07,546
And here you go.

1014
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:26,042
All right.

1015
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:27,522
Oh, another claim went out

1016
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:30,220
on that horse this morning.

1017
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:30,960
You'll roll the dice

1018
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:33,093
right after the race.

1019
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:34,137
Darn.

1020
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:34,964
I can't roll dice

1021
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,358
to save my life.

1022
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:38,707
 Well, it looks like the

1023
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:40,405
 number 8 horse, Tom Thumb,

1024
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:41,362
 seems to be having some

1025
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:42,668
 difficulty joining the other

1026
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:43,973
 horses at the gate.

1027
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,369
 There he goes now.

1028
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,547
He looks pretty good.

1029
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:53,592
Well, we'll see how he does

1030
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:57,030
on the sloppy track.

1031
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:59,075
 And #8 goes in.

1032
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:04,690
[gate bell rings]

1033
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:06,822
 And away they go!

1034
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:08,607
 Devil's Pride takes the lead.

1035
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,261
 #8, Tom Thumb, breaks wide,

1036
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:12,567
 way wide.

1037
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:13,394
 The rest of the pack is

1038
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:14,874
 right behind him...

1039
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,093
Jockey's laying into him.

1040
00:39:20,314 --> 00:39:21,184
 On the back stretch,

1041
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:22,621
 Devil's Pride leads the pack

1042
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:25,058
 followed by Good Boy Gus.

1043
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:29,802
 Tom Thumb is now dead last.

1044
00:39:29,845 --> 00:39:32,152
Just take the ride.

1045
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:32,805
 Followed by Titus

1046
00:39:32,848 --> 00:39:34,937
 Andronicus...

1047
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,419
 Coming around that far turn

1048
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:39,768
 now, Devil's Pride is still

1049
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:40,726
 in the lead.

1050
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:42,118
 He holds onto the lead to win,

1051
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,598
 followed by Titus Andronicus

1052
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:46,122
 and Good Boy Gus, third.

1053
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,733
 Tom Thumb trails the pack

1054
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:48,995
 by eight, maybe even

1055
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:50,736
 ten lengths at this point.

1056
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:04,445
We just made a big mistake.

1057
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:15,761
Hey there, Eddie.

1058
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:17,545
Hey, Solly.

1059
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:19,765
What is going on here?

1060
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:20,505
[laughs]

1061
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:21,114
Don't tell me you're the

1062
00:40:21,157 --> 00:40:22,071
other claim.

1063
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:23,029
Here I am,

1064
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:24,465
helping you out

1065
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,424
every chance I get.

1066
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:27,425
Turns out you're in the

1067
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:28,556
horse-claiming business.

1068
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,252
Yeah, but we didn't know

1069
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:29,905
it was...

1070
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:30,993
What is my groom

1071
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:32,430
doing with you all?

1072
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,089
He's a friend, and he just

1073
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:42,135
came along for the ride.

1074
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:42,788
[laughs]

1075
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:43,876
There you go.

1076
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:45,443
Gentlemen, shall we?

1077
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,240
Four.

1078
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:02,634
I gotta tell you, Solly,

1079
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:04,157
I'm lousy at rolling the dice.

1080
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,071
Did you see him out of the

1081
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:05,767
gate there, Eddie?

1082
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:06,507
Oh, no kidding, huh?

1083
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:07,682
Ooh-whee, he was rank,

1084
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:09,423
but old Baynes, he wants him.

1085
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,468
Believe me, that's one headache

1086
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:11,947
you're better off without.

1087
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:16,517
Snake eyes.

1088
00:41:16,561 --> 00:41:18,301
You did it, Eddie.

1089
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,483
Well, Eddie...

1090
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:26,179
hope you know what you're

1091
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:28,137
getting into.

1092
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:31,053
You'll find out soon enough.

1093
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:33,621
Gerald...

1094
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:36,668
we gonna need to talk.

1095
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:39,714
Yeah, I expect we will.

1096
00:41:41,586 --> 00:41:42,238
I need the balance

1097
00:41:42,282 --> 00:41:43,762
of the money.

1098
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:59,299
[rooster crows]

1099
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:01,431
Harland, perhaps I was

1100
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:04,522
unclear how delicate

1101
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,698
our position is this season.

1102
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:08,047
No, ma'am, you have been

1103
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,440
perfectly clear.

1104
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:11,485
Then how could something

1105
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,356
like this happen?

1106
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,532
A mistake.

1107
00:42:14,575 --> 00:42:15,881
An accident.

1108
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:18,361
Not an acceptable answer.

1109
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:19,972
I've handled problem horses

1110
00:42:20,015 --> 00:42:21,234
like this dozens of times

1111
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:23,236
before, and I had somebody there

1112
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:24,454
to cover the claim.

1113
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:26,544
I'm not interested.

1114
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:27,806
All I know is the son of

1115
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:29,285
Keltic Tom, a horse from one of

1116
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:32,506
our farms, was claimed by a

1117
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,421
trainer, his niece,

1118
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:36,597
and a groomer.

1119
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:37,903
Can you imagine what the press

1120
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:39,252
will make of this if-- if this

1121
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:41,167
horse wins just one race?

1122
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,385
[chuckles]

1123
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:44,866
Unlikely.

1124
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,780
I want nothing left

1125
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:48,261
to chance.

1126
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:49,610
What would you like for me

1127
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:51,264
to do?

1128
00:42:51,307 --> 00:42:52,439
Fix it.

1129
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:56,530
We need the racing public's

1130
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,619
focus on Manifest Wind.

1131
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:00,926
We simply cannot afford

1132
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:03,145
any distractions.

1133
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:06,932
Do we understand each other?

1134
00:43:06,975 --> 00:43:08,760
Yes, ma'am.

1135
00:43:12,415 --> 00:43:13,721
[sighs]

1136
00:43:15,244 --> 00:43:17,725
I just-- I love the fall

1137
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:20,162
weather.

1138
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:21,468
Don't you, Harland?

1139
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:25,037
Ah, yes, ma'am.

1140
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:30,390
Welcome to your new home,

1141
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:31,217
Tom.

1142
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,871
Good to have you here.

1143
00:43:35,569 --> 00:43:36,396
Now, I don't want you getting

1144
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:37,876
your hopes up here now.

1145
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:39,225

Gotta admire that little

pulled right up to the money.

2272
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:02,782
It went all right, but you

2273
01:27:02,826 --> 01:27:03,696
coulda done better.

2274
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,742
You shoulda stuck to him longer.

2275
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:06,917
Yeah, yeah, coulda,

Are you all right?

2281
01:27:14,707 --> 01:27:17,014
Yeah. Look.

2282
01:27:20,409 --> 01:27:21,540
All right, now don't spend

2283
01:27:21,584 --> 01:27:22,541
no money in town.

2284
01:27:22,585 --> 01:27:23,803
You get out, and get out fast.

2285

Eddie.

2307
