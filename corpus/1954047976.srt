[ sighs ]
We met through a friend.

371
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,856
[ sighs ]
We met through a friend.
A blind date, actually.

372
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:27,391
We met through a friend.
A blind date, actually.
And we had a lot of fun together

373
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:28,592
A blind date, actually.
And we had a lot of fun together
back then.

374
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:30,360
And we had a lot of fun together
back then.
Maybe a little too much fun

375
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:31,461
back then.
Maybe a little too much fun
Sometimes.

376
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,398
Maybe a little too much fun
Sometimes.
But I don't know.

00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,868
Sometimes.
But I don't know.

I think it was the job.
He was always on the road.
I was always here, so I settled,

380
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:45,943
He was always on the road.
I was always here, so I settled,
and he didn't.

381
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:46,944
I was always here, so I settled,
And he didn't.
[ chuckles ]

382
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,245
And he didn't.
[ chuckles ]
So, what about you?

>> Oh, you were always so hard
on yourself.

398
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,042
on yourself.

I had to get out of here one way
or another.

404
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,657
I had to get out of here one way
or another.
College was a good excuse.

405
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,525
or another.
College was a good excuse.
>> What?

406
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:48,639
>> [ sighs ]
>> Well, that was an accident,
and accidents happen.

407
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:49,973
>> Well, that was an accident,
and accidents happen.
That could have happened to

408
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:51,642
and accidents happen.
That could have happened to
Either of you.

409
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:53,310
That could have happened to
either of you.
>> But it happened to tom.

410
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:56,046
either of you.

417
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,357
Together.

what we did to him?

418
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,959
>> Don't you feel any guilt for
what we did to him?

419
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:10,260
What we did to him?

It was 20 years ago.

420
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:14,264
>> We were young, Easton.
It was 20 years ago.
I...

421
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,667
It was 20 years ago.
I...
I never wanted to cheat on him,

422
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:19,169
I...
I never wanted to cheat on him,
but with you, at the time, it

423
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,038
I never wanted to cheat on him,
but with you, at the time, it
felt right.

424
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:29,479
>> I made the move, though.
>> After all this time, this
still bothers you?

425
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,181
>> After all this time, this
still bothers you?
I mean, wasn't it enough that

426
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,649
still bothers you?
I mean, wasn't it enough that
you stayed away for so long?

427
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,283
I mean, wasn't it enough that
you stayed away for so long?
>> No.

428
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,952
you stayed away for so long?
>> No.
>> You know, well, then just

429
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,453
>> No.
>> You know, well, then just
carry it for the rest of your

430
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,322
>> You know, well, then just
carry it for the rest of your
life, then.

431
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:52,235
>> I should have stayed.
>> Maybe.
>> No.

432
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,438
>> Maybe.
>> No.
I should have.

433
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,006
>> No.
I should have.
>> When things like this happen

434
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,041
I should have.
>> When things like this happen
in life, Easton, they just...

435

>> When things like this happen
in life, Easton, they just...
They become a part of you, and

00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,641
project for the last three
years.
I wrote web spiders, which are

511
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,477
years.
I wrote web spiders, which are
automated programs that catalog

I wrote web spiders, which are
automated programs that catalog
data.

513
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:58,215
automated programs that catalog
data.
They scan the internet, and they

514
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:00,917
data.
They scan the internet, and they
store specific information on my

They scan the internet, and they
store specific information on my
servers.

store specific information on my
servers.
So, what we were doing was

So, what we were doing was
building an efficient source for

So, what we were doing was
building an efficient source for
all the information that the

all the information that the
internet has to offer, no matter

00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:12,362
all the information that the
internet has to offer, no matter
how obscure.

And what it was, was a scanned
newspaper article that you're

He answered the phone, and he
Said, "hello?"

can't listen to this anymore.
Easton, it's insane.

Easton, it's insane.

you know what?
I know...

581
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,930
you know what?
I know...
I know that a lot of things in

I know...
I know that a lot of things in
your life have been going on,

00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:28,998
I know that a lot of things in
your life have been going on,
Right?

584
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,434
Your life have been going on,
Right?
So...

585
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:32,969
Right?
So...
It's impossible for this to be

586
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,671
So...
It's impossible for this to be
happening, and it's crazy for

587
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:36,406
It's impossible for this to be
happening, and it's crazy for
you to be making up stories to

588
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:37,006
happening, and it's crazy for
you to be making up stories to
fix things.

>> Wait, wait, Hayley.
>> What?

593
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:43,713
>> Wait, wait, Hayley.
>> What?
>> There were instructions.

594
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:44,981

I don't know what they mean, but

Tom's safe?

Uh, lenny gave it to me after

Uh, Lennie gave it to me after

Uh, Lennie gave it to me after
they cleared out his room.
No one knew the combo, so...

613
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:37,614
They cleared out his room.
No one knew the combo, so...
>> Did it open?

00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:39,215
No one knew the combo, so...
>> Did it open?
>> Well, I did what you said.

I didn't look inside.

I didn't look inside.
You know, I just don't --

I didn't look inside.
You know, I just don't --
I don't want to dig this up any

Tom's gone, so what's inside

Tom's gone, so what's inside
doesn't matter.

00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:32,168
It still smells the same.

Your house always smelled like

Your house always smelled like

Your house always smelled like

Yeah, funny, Easton.
It's real funny.

644
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:19,282
Yeah, funny, Easton.
It's real funny.
Why do we need to go down here?

try these theories out on me or
