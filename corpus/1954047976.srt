back then.
Maybe a little too much fun
Sometimes.

He was always on the road.
I was always here, so I settled,

I was always here, so I settled,
And he didn't.

That could have happened to
Either of you.

I never wanted to cheat on him,

422
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:19,169
I...
I never wanted to cheat on him,
but with you, at the time, it

423
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,038
I never wanted to cheat on him,
but with you, at the time, it
felt right.

424
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:29,479
>> I made the move, though.
>> After all this time, this
still bothers you?

425
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,181
>> After all this time, this
still bothers you?
I mean, wasn't it enough that

426
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,649
still bothers you?
I mean, wasn't it enough that
you stayed away for so long?

I mean, wasn't it enough that
you stayed away for so long?
>> No.

428
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,952
you stayed away for so long?
>> No.
>> You know, well, then just

429
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,453
>> No.
>> You know, well, then just
carry it for the rest of your

432
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,438
>> Maybe.
>> No.
I should have.

433

project for the last three
years.
I wrote web spiders, which are

511
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,477
years.
I wrote web spiders, which are
automated programs that catalog

I wrote web spiders, which are
automated programs that catalog
data.

513
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:58,215
automated programs that catalog
data.
They scan the internet, and they

00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:00,917
data.
They scan the internet, and they
store specific information on my

store specific information on my
servers.

store specific information on my

So, what we were doing was

building an efficient source for
all the information that the

00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:32,969
Right?
So...
It's impossible for this to be

00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,671
So...
It's impossible for this to be
happening, and it's crazy for

It's impossible for this to be

No one knew the combo, so...

613
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:37,614
They cleared out his room.
No one knew the combo, so...

You know, I just don't --

Tom's gone, so what's inside

Tom's gone, so what's inside
doesn't matter.

It still smells the same.

Why do we need to go down here?

Okay.

All the information that was
Sent to me were corrupted files

except for the article.
And they were all sent from a

And they were all sent from a
certain web address.
