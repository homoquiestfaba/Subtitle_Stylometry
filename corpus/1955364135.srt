1
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,299
<i> Intruder located</i>
<i> in sector d.</i>

2
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,567
Thanks, oracle.

3
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:44,103
Come on, girls.
It's hero time.

4
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,372
Huh?

5
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,741
Where's the snooze
button on this thing?

6
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,312
- Mmm.

7
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,150
S... supergirls, up!
Up and away!

8
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,886
Time to save the day.

9
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,721
Or night.

10
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,723
Drones, swarm.

11
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,094
<i> Your hood, miss batgirl.</i>

12
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,896
Pow! Action on!

13
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,776
- Oracle shows
the intruder is close.

14
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,112
-He must be hiding.
-I'll look in the classrooms.

15
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,181
And I'll check the lockers.

16
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,519
--Ugh!

17
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,320
Any sign of
the criminal, Bumblebee?

18
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,490
No. But an old pumpernickel
sandwich in beast boy's locker

19
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,760
just committed a crime
against my nose.

20
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,765
In there!

21
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,602
Oh.

22
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,605
Mr. bones,
aren't you looking trim?

23
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,275
This way.

24
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,349
Big barda.

25
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,984
How'd you get back here?

26
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,686
Wonder woman? I...

27
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:08,954
--Whoa!

28
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,156
Hey!

29
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,396
You mess with the bee,
you're gonna get stung.

30
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,679
Truce?

31
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:37,249
Big barda, you're going
back to belle reve
juvenile detention.

32
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:38,984
No!

33
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,691
Oh! Sorry. I...

34
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,160
--Ha! Got her!

35
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,661
What's going on here?

36
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,897
Principal waller.

37
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,166
We captured known
criminal, big barda.

38
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:57,436
Girls, this is
new student,
big barda.

39
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,637
What?

40
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,241
She tricked you,
principal waller.

41
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,876
Her plans to take over
the school are right here.

42
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,845
"Ap weaponomics, 8:30,

43
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,615
"intro to super suits, 9:30."

44
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,550
My class schedule.

45
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:14,386
I was making sure
i knew where all
my classes were

46
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,855
so I wouldn't be tardy
on my first day.

47
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,258
You let her into
super hero high?

48
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,095
But this is a school
for superheroes,
not supervillains.

49
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:26,698
Maybe big barda
erased your memory when
she helped brainwash everyone.

50
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,736
I trust big barda
has reformed just like
vice principal graw did.

51
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,171
So, please, make her
feel at home.

52
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:39,778
At my home,
this would call for
an olive branch, but...

53
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,216
Would this do?

54
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,984
Yeah. Thanks.

55
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,487
This is your dorm room.

56
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,789
Wow.

57
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,625
You can trick it out
with whatever decorations
you brought from home.

58
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,428
Home? This is all I got
from apokolips,

59
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,563
but that's not
my home anymore.

60
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,401
Darkseid's got a zero
tolerance policy for
girls gone good.

61
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,102
I guess that
makes me a stray.

62
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,238
-Like blondie.
-Me?

63
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,941
Uh, granted getting ousted
from apokolips is
less dramatic

64
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,911
than your whole planet
going kablooey like...

65
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,913
Krypton kaboom, right?

66
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,850
Oh, sorry,
I'm not good
with small talk.

67
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,585
I just never had
much time for it

68
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,255
between combat practice,
avoiding the abyss of anguish,

69
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:26,458
and working on my evil laugh.

70
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,193
That last one was a joke.

71
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,765
I guess I'm not good
with jokes either.

72
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,201
We better get some rest.

73
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,671
There's lots to do tomorrow
for the big hero of the year
celebration this weekend.

74
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,952
I thought I was the
only night owl here.

75
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,455
-What're you doing up?
-Couldn't go back to sleep.

76
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,990
- Wow. Who were they?
- My parents.

77
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,460
I don't want to forget
what they looked like.

78
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,161
But art's not my thing.

79
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,296
I can't get it right.

80
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,865
Come on.

81
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,334
State-of-the-art police
sketch program.

82
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,869
But it'll work for this, too.

83
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,806
It looks just like them.

84
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,760
-Hi, commissioner Gordon.
-What's up, comish?

85
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:38,096
-Morning.
-Babs, I saved you
a seat up here.

86
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,332
Dad, I'll be fine
in the back.

87
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:43,235
But, babsy bugs,
you might miss something
in my lecture

88
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,936
about the three aspects
of a crime

89
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,872
that must be established
to determine guilt.

90
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,408
Means, motive and opportunity.

91
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,944
I have the means
and motive
to sit by my friends.

92
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,214
So, I'll take this opportunity
to use this desk.

93
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,551
Besides, dad,
we'll have plenty of time
together this weekend,

94
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,354
since you're my date to the
hero of the year ceremony.

95
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,689
- Aw.

96
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,559
All right, students,
for today's
forensics assignment

97
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,227
everyone needs a partner.

98
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,362
Partner?

99
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,231
--Oh, yeah!

100
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,570
Cyborg, do you
want to be partners?

101
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:22,808
Sorry, hawkgirl,
me and katana
make a mean team.

102
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,044
-Starfire?
-I'm enjoying the
dynamic duosity

103
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,146
of being the partners
with miss martian.

104
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,314
Ivy.

105
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,049
Frost?

106
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,951
Supergirl?
Wonder woman!

107
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,953
Oh, no.

108
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,922
What up, partner?

109
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,824
Beast boy.

110
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,326
Let's get forensicin', mama.

111
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,097
I gots it!

112
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,632
You solved the assignment?

113
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,302
Nah, I finally got that itch
i couldn't reach.

114
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,505
Oh, yeah.
That's the spot.

115
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,173
We have an assignment to do.

116
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:58,443
-Stop monkeying around.
-I wasn't monkeyin' around.

117
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,446
This is monkeyin' around.

118
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,484
I can juggle like that.

119
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,519
Beast boy,
get down from there.

120
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,155
Aw, man.

121
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,957
Everybody's always
gripin' at me.

122
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,626
It's, "stop that!
Don't go there!

123
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,229
"Get your tail
out of my soup,
beast boy."

124
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,869
If you want people
to take you seriously
as a proper hero,

125
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,370
you can't be so wild.

126
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,274
Could you teach me?

127
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,310
Me? No way.

128
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,645
You need a lion tamer,

129
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,480
or a horse-whisperer,
or something.

130
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,382
Please?

131
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,051
I'll think about it.

132
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,553
Yeah, mama!

133
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:59,137
- Oh, fabulous work, Ivy.
-Thanks, Mr. crazy quilt.

134
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,839
They say you shouldn't
gild the Lily,

135
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,808
but they didn't say
anything about roses.

136
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,811
Oh, spectacular sparkling,
sapphire.

137
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,080
Thanks. I love sparkles.

138
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,518
Cheetah! Put that trophy
back where you found it.

139
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,154
"Put that trophy back
where you found it."

140
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:20,191
This is Lois Lane,
live at super hero high
where everyone is busy

141
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:23,762
<i> preparing for the annual</i>
<i> hero of the year ceremony.</i>

142
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:27,365
<i> There are two of</i>
<i> the nominees now,</i>
<i> hawkgirl and cyborg.</i>

143
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,867
<i> Good morning, Lois.</i>

144
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,036
<i> Hey! Shout-out to</i>
<i> all my fans out there.</i>

145
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,572
<i> Can I get a "boo-yah?"</i>

146
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,575
<i> And there's another</i>
<i> hero of the year</i>
<i> nominee, katana.</i>

147
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,619
<i> And here's lady Shiva.</i>

148
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,956
<i> Lady Shiva, what's it</i>
<i> feel like to be nominated</i>
<i> for hero of the year?</i>

149
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,060
<i> The joy I find in this honor</i>
<i> is nearly as great</i>
<i> as the pride</i>

150
00:09:55,062 --> 00:10:00,198
<i> that swelled inside of me,</i>
<i> when I defeated the army</i>
<i> of rampaging boogey beasts,</i>

151
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,801
<i> using nothing but</i>
<i> my left pinky toe.</i>

152
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,303
<i> Intense.</i>

153
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,813
<i> Ooh, there's flash.</i>

154
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,916
<i> Uh, is that camera on?</i>

155
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,918
<i> Got to go!</i>

156
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
<i> And this year's</i>
<i> final nominees,</i>

157
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,055
<i> wonder woman and Bumblebee.</i>

158
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,725
What will you do if you win?

159
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,293
<i> I never really</i>
<i> thought about it.</i>

160
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,729
<i> I mean, I got a sweet</i>
<i> suit that lets me fly,</i>

161
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,765
<i> shrink and Bumblebee blast.</i>

162
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,603
<i> But this isn't the</i>
<i> "best dress awards."</i>

163
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,605
<i> As far as hero-ing goes,</i>

164
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,941
<i> my fellow nominee and bestie,</i>
<i> wonder woman, here,</i>

165
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,609
<i> is straight up on fleek.</i>

166
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,444
<i> Aw, thanks, Bumblebee.</i>

167
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,080
Supergirl and batgirl,
as new students,

168
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,416
you didn't meet
the minimum time
to qualify this year.

169
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,917
So, who do you think
should win?

170
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,024
<i> -Well, uh...</i>
<i> -Harley Quinn here.</i>

171
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:03,194
<i> I first dreamed of being</i>
<i> a hero when I was</i>
<i> a babbling baby!</i>

172
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,964
<i> And I saw</i>
<i> a superhero</i>
<i> on the telly.</i>

173
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,168
<i> Suspicious activity</i>
<i> detected at the amethyst.</i>

174
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,536
Come on!

175
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,411
Ew. It looks infected.

176
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,083
Mmm. No trace of trespassers.

177
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,455
I saw the alert.
What's the status?

178
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:33,491
Breaking news,
something's going on
with the amethyst.

179
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,695
Thank you, Lois.
But we have top secret
matters to discuss.

180
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,864
I'm here for the
top secret meeting.

181
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,533
-How did you know?
-Lois' report.

182
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,004
I've never seen the
amethyst do this before.

183
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:48,807
It could be natural.
A gem fungus
or parasite.

184
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,675
But until we know
what's going on,

185
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,577
we'll post a guard
around the clock.

186
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,412
I call dibs on
the first shifts.

187
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:55,814
Excellent, hawkgirl.

188
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,849
Wonder woman, coordinate
the guard schedule.

189
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,318
You got it, principal waller.

190
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,154
We don't know
what's behind this change
with the amethyst,

191
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,823
but we need to be
extra vigilant.

192
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,658
Okay.

193
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,394
I guess my invite
to the party
got lost in the mail?

194
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,062
Big barda!

195
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,931
Lead warrior in
the female furies

196
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,734
and active
in the attempt to conquer
super hero high.

197
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,669
Stand down, lady Shiva.

198
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:20,038
Big barda is
a student here now.

199
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,873
Where's the
hidden camera?
Huh?

200
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,541
Is this another prank, Harley?

201
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:24,843
I wish.

202
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,544
That would have been a doozy!

203
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:29,080
Seriously?
Principal waller
let her in?

204
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,248
Mmm-hmm.

205
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,387
Don't mind lady Shiva.

206
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,956
She's still smarting
from that time

207
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,557
when you brainwashed
her father

208
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,559
and, generally, threatened
everything she loves.

209
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,561
Yeah. Sorry.

210
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,797
But whatever you need now,
I'm up for it.

211
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,699
Thanks, barda.

212
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,101
You can relieve hawkgirl
after her shift guarding
the amethyst.

213
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,603
-Cool.
-Really?

214
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,938
She wants to help,
and we need help.

215
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,743
Just in case, everyone needs
to be prepared.

216
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,278
-Swords sharpened!
-Hmm!

217
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,479
- Electric stings charged.

218
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,081
Nunchuks, uh...

219
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,315
Chucked?

220
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,750
Batgirl, could you
fix my shield?

221
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,152
It got cracked last night.

222
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,920
Whoops!

223
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,089
This is beyond my expertise.

224
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,824
You need someone
who knows metal.

225
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:17,061
Hmm. Sounds like a job
for the master alchemist
of Themyscira.

226
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,063
Who's up for a field trip?

227
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,498
-Right on!
-Me.

228
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,333
Can we take the batjet?

229
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,435
You know how
freaked out my dad gets
about me flying

230
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,104
halfway around the world.

231
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:29,741
Technically,
Themyscira isn't halfway
around the world.

232
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,509
It's more like
a third of the way.

233
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,511
Your dad won't even
have time to worry.

234
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,480
We'll be back by
lunchtime tomorrow.

235
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,486
I'll fuel up the batjet!

236
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,654
I call shotgun!

237
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,355
-All right!
-Yeah, honey!

238
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,026
Hiya, newbie!

239
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,627
Name's Harley Quinn.

240
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,996
You probably heard of me.

241
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,965
-Um...
-Of course you have.

242
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,100
As our newest student,
you have qualified

243
00:13:56,102 --> 00:14:00,772
for the spectacular,
amazing, undeniably unique
Harley Quinn tour.

244
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,707
Can I get a whoopie-whoopie?

245
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,375
-Whoopie?
-Perfect.

246
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,659
I'd like to thank
my parents for being
the wind beneath my wings.

247
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,329
Or rather, for passing down
the family heirloom,

248
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,364
my nth metal belt
from thanagar

249
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,333
- that enables me to fly.

250
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,168
I couldn't have won
this award without it.

251
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,772
Brava!

252
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,575
Who are...

253
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,183
Attacking a student,
two demerits.

254
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:48,686
Only two? That will never do
for an overachiever
like myself.

255
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,488
- How about 200?

256
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,037
Nth metal from
the planet thanagar.

257
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,672
What a wonderful start.

258
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,576
Aunt Martha,
it's just a quick trip
to Themyscira.

259
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,878
<i> As long as</i>
<i> you're all still coming</i>
<i> to the farm for dinner</i>

260
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,713
<i> after the big</i>
<i> awards ceremony.</i>

261
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,716
Wouldn't miss it.
Your mashed potatoes
are the bomb!

262
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,052
<i> Thank you, Bumblebee.</i>

263
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,688
<i> Supergirl will get</i>
<i> plenty of those while she's</i>
<i> here over school break.</i>

264
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,623
Oh, I don't know, aunt Martha.

265
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,026
Are you sure
you want me there?
I don't want to put you out.

266
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,094
<i> Of course.</i>

267
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,430
<i> Supergirl, you know</i>
<i> you can make yourself</i>
<i> at home with us.</i>

268
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,065
<i> We love you, dear.</i>

269
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,434
I, uh... I appreciate it.

270
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,702
Bye, aunt Martha.

271
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,039
Talking to the kents again?

272
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,374
You know the drill.
A call every day.

273
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,742
Speed delivery for supergirl!

274
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,978
And a cookie care
package every week.

275
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,614
Lucky! I call the
snickerdoodles.

276
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,050
You may have just
met the kents
a few months ago,

277
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:55,954
but points to Martha
for already having all
your favorite foods down.

278
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,991
Yeah. My mom still
insists that I love olives,
just like she does.

279
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,926
But olives...

280
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,494
The texture. Ugh!

281
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,480
To Themyscira!

282
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,464
-The Princess has returned!
-Oh, she came back! Yes!

283
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,632
-Welcome home, Princess.
-This is wonderful.

284
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,534
-Mother.
-Diana.

285
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:47,271
I can't stay long.
I just need
my shield repaired.

286
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,974
The only one
who can repair
such damage

287
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,777
to themysciran ore
is the master alchemist.

288
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,213
It will be my honor, Princess.

289
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,615
Come on, I want to show
you guys my home.

290
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,417
Home.

291
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,324
Mom.

292
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,793
Welcome home, Kara.
How was your ride?

293
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:14,365
Amazing. We found this.

294
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,367
A mnemosyne crystal.

295
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,904
Once we get this polished,
it will be very powerful.

296
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,810
Hurry up,
supergirl!

297
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,012
I hear the ambrosia
here is delish.

298
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,647
Um, coming.

299
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,189
And that's the royal spa.

300
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,524
Sweet.

301
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,659
Is that
a pedicure chair?

302
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,762
My toes are tots in need
of some tlc.

303
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:48,166
Hey, batgirl, I think
there's something weird
with my necklace.

304
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:51,235
I touched
the mnemosyne crystal
and saw something.

305
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,370
Krypton.

306
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,838
Interesting.

307
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,506
I can do some tests
when we get home.

308
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,241
Supergirl, over here!

309
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,544
If you stay here
during school break,
this will be your room.

310
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,579
Oh, yeah. Nice.

311
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,848
I thought you'd
stay at the kents
over the holiday.

312
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,116
I haven't decided.

313
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,018
I mean they say I'm welcome,

314
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,719
but maybe they're
just being nice.

315
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,421
I don't want to be
a charity project.

316
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,290
Come on, the throne
room is this way.

317
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,762
Diana, you're skipping over
the best room.

318
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,531
Mom, they don't want
to see that.

319
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,899
It's embarrassing.

320
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,401
Embarrassing?

321
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,103
Well, now we have to see it.

322
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,538
Lead the way,
miss queen hippolyta.

323
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,420
Whoa. This room is gleamin'.

324
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,222
Are all these awards yours?

325
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:47,425
-Well, you know...
-These are just
from the past year.

326
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,927
We had to build a whole wing
on the other side
of the palace

327
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,163
for Diana's elementary
school honors.

328
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,598
Come, look at this.

329
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,666
It's the key to the
city of Metropolis.

330
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,301
Wow.

331
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,403
And I thought that my dad
driving around with that

332
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,972
"my daughter is
hero of the month

333
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,341
"at super hero high"
bumper sticker was bad.

334
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,410
Shh. Don't let my mom
know those exist.

335
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,346
She'll plaster
her chariot with them.

336
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,481
Diana, I want to
show you something.

337
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,517
Wow!

338
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,285
An invisible trophy?

339
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:17,155
No. This is where we'll put
the hero of the year trophy.

340
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,157
But I haven't won yet.

341
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,791
The competition is
really fierce.

342
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,293
I think Bumblebee
has a good chance.

343
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,128
Girl, look around you.

344
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,631
You got the hero of the year
prize in the bag.

345
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,966
Precisely. And to celebrate,
we feast.

346
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,168
Come along, girls.

347
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,238
Aw, mom.

348
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,446
Who wants olives? Diana?

349
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,715
Mom, I don't like olives.

350
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:48,152
Since when?
It's in our blood
to like olives.

351
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,621
- More for me.

352
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,023
Mmm.

353
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,724
Your shield, Princess.

354
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,961
It's perfect.

355
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,031
Thank you.

356
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:04,068
I wish it serves you well
in your quest to win
the hero of the year award.

357
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,836
Of course, she'll win.

358
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,506
I was going to give you a gift
after tomorrow's ceremony

359
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,408
but why wait? Come.

360
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,484
The tiara of triumph.

361
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:21,986
Oh, hello.

362
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,297
Oh, my hera! The Ruby!

363
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,376
Hey!

364
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,515
There!

365
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,185
It's gone!

366
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,222
Down there!

367
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,457
What is that thing?

368
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,658
We'll find out
when we catch it.

369
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,463
--Whoa!

370
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,201
Bumblebee!

371
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,875
--Thanks for breaking
my fall, guys.

372
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,277
What just happened?

373
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,746
I don't know.
I think my power cut out.

374
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,948
Talk about
a major buzzkill.

375
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,983
Anybody see which way
that thing went?

376
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,152
No, it's gone.

377
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,056
The Amazons will find
that creature

378
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,925
and reclaim your Ruby
for the ceremony tomorrow.

379
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:35,993
Thanks, mom.

380
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,830
My heart
is filled with pride

381
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,799
for your
hero of the year triumph.

382
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:43,768
I'll do my best.

383
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,836
-Bye, mom.
-Goodbye, darling.

384
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,009
Godspeed, sweet Princess.

385
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,489
Barbara!

386
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,791
There you are.

387
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:08,326
What took you so long?

388
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,295
For Peter Pan's sake,
i was worried sick.

389
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:14,432
Your third period
forensics teacher told me
you missed class.

390
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:17,835
Dad, you're my third period
forensics teacher.

391
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:21,038
You knew I had
an off-campus pass
from principal waller.

392
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,774
Well, I approved that
before the hullabaloo

393
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,976
with that supervillain
attacking students.

394
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,812
A supervillain?
What happened?

395
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:30,314
Big barda found hawkgirl
unconscious.

396
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,350
Apparently, someone came out
of the amethyst

397
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,984
and stole her
nth metal belt.

398
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,320
- What?
-Oh, no!

399
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,556
The emergency meeting of
the junior detective society

400
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,624
is now starting.

401
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,961
So, someone came out
of the amethyst and
stole hawkgirl's belt.

402
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,364
Plus something stole
wonder woman's Ruby.

403
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,833
That makes two cases
of grand larceny.

404
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:51,869
Hawkgirl! Principal waller
said you were resting
in the nurse's office.

405
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,571
Heroes never rest.

406
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:55,139
Write that down,
that's important.

407
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,340
You got it, mama.

408
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,309
Don't call me, "mama."

409
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,343
Write that down.

410
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,978
You got it, not-mama.

411
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,047
- Whatchu doin', beast boy?

412
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,083
Hero of the year
rule 10.1.234.

413
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,552
Nominees may receive
hero of the year points

414
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,855
for helping
other heroes succeed.

415
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:14,024
I'm training him to be
a proper rule abiding hero
like me.

416
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,360
Whatever you say, teach.

417
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,863
That villain may have stolen
my nth metal belt

418
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,265
but he will not steal
my chance at hero of the year.

419
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,200
Now, I've done some research.

420
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,268
Show them, beast boy.

421
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:29,607
Aw, man, I must've left this
in my pants last week!

422
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:32,209
Mmm.

423
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,077
Pumpernickel.

424
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,849
Oh, yeah.

425
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,518
Uh, the research.

426
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,455
Get this, our amethyst is
an old portal to gemworld.

427
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:46,123
It's been inactive
for decades.

428
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,658
But that changed
this morning.

429
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,060
That's our fugitive.

430
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,062
-Dark opal.
-Dark opal?

431
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,565
Sounds more like
a jewelry store
than a villain.

432
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:58,636
Yo, dark opal's
a legit wickedy-wack
wicked dude.

433
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:02,039
He has some
mean magic stored
in that gem on his chest.

434
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,109
Gemworld? Gems?

435
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,911
Supergirl's crystal.

436
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:10,214
Maybe that has something
to do with all this.

437
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,716
And this is
capes & cowls cafe.

438
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:16,454
Home to all your favorite
superfoods from awesome
acai bowls to...

439
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:19,590
Large double spinach, sardine,
and pickleberry smoothie.

440
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:20,791
Ugh.

441
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:21,992
Yucko, bucko.

442
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,165
Mmm! Tastes just like
my favorite
Kryptonian dessert.

443
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:31,869
We need to
check your crystal.

444
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,573
Hmm.

445
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:37,141
Where did you get the crystal?

446
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,342
From my mom.

447
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,416
Go, Kara, hurry!

448
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,686
Mom, dad, come on!

449
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:52,590
-Sorry, Kara.
-This way,
I'll always be with you.

450
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:53,757
What do you mean?

451
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,128
No! You have
to come with me!

452
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,932
The spaceship can only
hold enough supplies for one.

453
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:05,369
-I love you, Kara.
-I wish it didn't have
to be this way.

454
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,371
Goodbye,
my dearest girl.

455
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,145
Supergirl, you okay?

456
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:18,482
Your crystal got all glowy
and you went to la-la land.

457
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:22,019
Not la-la land.
Krypton. My home.

458
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:25,489
Strange. There's this
repeating pattern.

459
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,625
It's almost
like morse code.

460
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,493
Could be signaling someone.

461
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:32,897
My mom said she gave me
the crystal so she could
always be with me.

462
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:35,633
Maybe she programmed it
so when she got
off Krypton

463
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:37,301
she could find me.

464
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:40,905
But weren't your parents
on Krypton when the planet,

465
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,541
you know,
exploded?

466
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:44,808
Maybe not.

467
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,011
They were
really smart scientists.

468
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,913
Maybe they built another ship.

469
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,815
Supergirl, we should wait
until we can learn more

470
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,551
before jumping to conclusions.

471
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,519
I have to tell Martha
and Jonathan!

472
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,454
My parents are coming for me!

473
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,992
And it's a signal!

474
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:05,529
If it just started doing this,
that means someone
is looking for it. Right?

475
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:08,065
<i> Well, I don't know much</i>
<i> about those frequency things.</i>

476
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,934
Yeah, of course,
uncle Jonathan.

477
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:12,336
But my parents
were scientists!

478
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:14,838
I'm gonna have a family again.

479
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,674
<i> It's always good to have hope.</i>

480
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,709
<i> Well, we'll see you tomorrow.</i>

481
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:22,112
<i> I'd love to see that</i>
<i> hologram-brain-video</i>
<i> whatchamacallit</i>

482
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,914
<i> now with your crystal.</i>

483
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,950
I haven't figured out
how to make it
turn on, yet.

484
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:28,085
Hello? Power on.

485
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,854
Open sesame.

486
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:33,057
As soon as my parents
get here, they could
teach me how to do it.

487
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,359
<i> Oh, calamity,</i>
<i> look at the time!</i>

488
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,894
<i> We better be getting to bed.</i>

489
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:38,195
<i> We love you, dear.</i>

490
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,564
Um, sure. Thanks.

491
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:41,699
Goodnight.

492
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,369
I'm waiting for you.

493
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,805
Mom and dad.

494
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:53,310
A hero is always polite.

495
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,746
A hero is vigilant
and prepared.

496
00:26:55,748 --> 00:27:00,050
A hero greets his fans
with a firm but
not too firm handshake.

497
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:01,752
Excellent progress, beast boy.

498
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,220
Our guarding shift
is complete.

499
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:05,089
But training shall resume
at sunrise.

500
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:09,093
Sunrise? On a Saturday?

501
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:14,598
Uh, it will be my pleasure to
experience this interesting
time of day with you.

502
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:19,169
Bumblebee, you left your
hero history homework
in my room.

503
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,539
--Bumblebee?

504
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,445
Bumblebee? Um, okay.
It's... it's a movie.

505
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,280
Uh, three words.

506
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,082
Uh, if we're gonna
play charades,

507
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,784
pop back into regular size,
okay?

508
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:36,453
Argh! Batgirl, help!

509
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:40,524
My suit's busted, I'm stuck!

510
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,998
Can you see
why my suit went kaput?

511
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,200
Looks like there's
something wrong
with your battery.

512
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:53,303
That shadow creeper
must've damaged it
when he knocked me over.

513
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,339
So we just need
to get you a new battery.

514
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,842
I've got aas, 9 volts,
an old watch battery.

515
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,444
Not so easy.

516
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:03,147
Of all my powers,
growing takes the most energy

517
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,716
and I don't have enough power
left in my suit to get big.

518
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:07,484
But when I'm this size,

519
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,319
there's no battery
small enough
to fit in my pack.

520
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,188
Yet powerful enough
to make me big.

521
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,656
It's impossible!

522
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,425
I'm gonna be small forever!

523
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,494
Before you built
your super suit,

524
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,029
did anyone think
it was possible

525
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,498
to have a suit that
enabled someone to shrink?

526
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,534
No, I guess not.

527
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,303
You did the impossible once
and we'll do it again.

528
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:27,971
Yeah, honey!

529
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,573
- Ha!

530
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:38,442
They should have returned
with the artifacts by now.

531
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,711
Patience, dark opal.

532
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:45,716
We have waited many moons
for the crystal key
to reveal itself.

533
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:48,685
Soon, darkness will rule.

534
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:51,455
They're ready.

535
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:57,461
Earthen steel.

536
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,496
Mega metal of apokolips.

537
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:01,765
Sapphire of zamaron.

538
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,901
Plus the nth metal
of thanagar

539
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,836
and the Ruby of Themyscira.

540
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,438
Where's the key?

541
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,007
Where's the crystal
of Krypton?

542
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:21,151
The crystal is guarded
by a powerful protection aura.

543
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,653
It cannot be stolen.

544
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,289
It must be freely given
by the girl.

545
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,291
But I'll find a way, eclipso.

546
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:29,326
Of course, you will,
dark opal.

547
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,628
You're the Jewel sorcerer
of gemworld.

548
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,465
I upheld my end of the bargain
and I trust you will
uphold yours.

549
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,501
You will get the crystal.

550
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,536
Now, bring the alchemist.

551
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,209
You will combine
these treasures from
across the cosmos

552
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:49,479
into a scepter which will
let us rule the universe.

553
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:52,182
Never! I will not
betray my home.

554
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,885
Mmm. My black diamond
says otherwise.

555
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:04,728
Yes, master.

556
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:08,498
Now get the crystal,
dark opal.

557
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,202
Give the girl whatever
she wants in return.

558
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,905
Opal, show me what she wants.

559
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,020
Yes, of course!

560
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:30,954
Whatever she wants.

561
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,094
Hey,
who took my mega-rod!

562
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,196
Someone stole
my throwing star!

563
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:43,400
My ring! I've been burgled!

564
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,403
It's chasse, chasse
and pirouette,

565
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,572
then we leap like
graceful gazelle

566
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,642
galloping through a field
on her way to meet
her gal pals for lunch.

567
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,580
Cheetah, please.
I said gazelle in field.

568
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,616
You're doing more of
a wildebeest trumping through
a sticky swamp.

569
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,251
Start again, from the top.

570
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,455
--Five, six, seven, eight.

571
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:06,957
Yes!

572
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,692
Feel the dance in your feet.

573
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:11,695
Stick it in your socks,
let it seep between your toes.

574
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:14,364
The detective club discovered
that all the stolen objects

575
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:17,200
were precious metals or gems
from the supers' homes.

576
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,602
Principal waller!

577
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,104
I found big barda trying
to leave school grounds.

578
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,973
She must be the one
behind this.

579
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,775
I was just out
for a walk.

580
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,243
Lady Shiva,

581
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,245
do you have evidence
for your accusations?

582
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:31,081
The amethyst was infiltrated
the night of her arrival

583
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:35,819
and she's the one that
so conveniently found hawkgirl
after she was attacked.

584
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:38,422
Hard evidence, lady Shiva?

585
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:41,725
Not yet. But I won't stand by
and let my school,

586
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,961
my friends, be invaded again.

587
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,263
Heroes must take
preemptive measures.

588
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,831
Barda, you may go.

589
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,133
Argh!

590
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:54,838
Heroes serve justice,
not hunches.

591
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,475
And then you throw your hands
in the air like your
armpits are on fire.

592
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:00,277
Crazy quilt.

593
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,979
No, don't say it.

594
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:04,414
If you cancel the show
because of one villain,

595
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,782
the criminals win!

596
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:07,684
I'm not canceling
the ceremony.

597
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:08,952
But we're on high alert.

598
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,687
And must increase security.

599
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,789
We need extra bodies
for sentry duty.

600
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,792
Oh, but each dancer
is a unique snowflake

601
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:18,395
in the blizzard
of my production.

602
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,300
You can have cheetah.

603
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,302
Hey!

604
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:28,305
Has batgirl learned
anything more
about supergirl's crystal.

605
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,474
Nothing yet.

606
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:33,010
In light of the recent
supervillain activity,

607
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,812
<i> the normally festive lead up</i>
<i> to the hero of the year</i>

608
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,547
<i> -has been subdued.</i>

609
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,650
<i> Who are you?</i>

610
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:43,887
Vice principal grodd,
it's me, Lois Lane,
intrepid reporter.

611
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:47,124
You've denied my request
for interviews about
a million times.

612
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:52,796
Hmm. How do I know
you're not some villain
disguised as Lois Lane?

613
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:54,798
Can you confirm the identity
of the villain?

614
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,034
Is it true that the villain
came out of the amethyst?

615
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,903
Did you have any run-ins with
this villain during your time
as a criminal?

616
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,574
Yeah, you're Lois Lane,
all right.

617
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:08,078
Wait, tell me more about
how principal waller
got you out of prison.

618
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,081
Official paperwork says
it was part of some
work release squad.

619
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:20,924
Mom, is that you?

620
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:25,162
Oh, it's just starfire.

621
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:28,865
I have examined the airspace
but have not witnessed
any suspicious activity.

622
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:32,169
I did however have a run-in
with a gull of the sea.

623
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:34,604
Oh, sorry.

624
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,878
Hey, alphabet soupie!

625
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,682
We's doin' the overs
and unders on
the big award. You in?

626
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:48,051
No thanks, Harley.

627
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:51,421
I'm supposed
to take over for katana.
Have you seen her?

628
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,223
I think she's guarding
the park.

629
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:54,291
Thank you.

630
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:57,928
Katana!

631
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:07,604
Mom?

632
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:09,806
Mom!

633
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:18,548
Mom, it's me.

634
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,320
Your crystal.

635
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:24,754
Give it to me.

636
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,090
Is something wrong?
Are you okay?

637
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,826
Just hand it over, supergirl.

638
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,428
Supergirl?

639
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,430
My mom never...

640
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:34,931
You're not my mom.

641
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,333
No! That's mine!

642
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,735
Oh, fine...

643
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:42,572
Magic disguises are
so hard to maintain when
the fighting begins.

644
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,574
You're the one
they're looking for.

645
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:48,245
The downside of fame.
You get recognized
everywhere you go!

646
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,350
Give me the crystal.

647
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,418
No!

648
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:10,700
Supers! Help!

649
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:11,935
Help!

650
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,038
He's here! Help!

651
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,450
You're surrounded.

652
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,219
No, you are.

653
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,339
Fight!

654
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:52,709
- Huh?

655
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,377
I see you swipin'

656
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,581
and I raise you a left jab
right in the kisser.

657
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,086
You gonna be a Thorn
in my side.

658
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,837
Oh, poor sapling...

659
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:43,293
Oh! For the love of
goose grass!

660
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:57,240
The sun. It destroys them.

661
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,109
I always liked sunlight.

662
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,153
Retreat! To the palace!

663
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:19,496
Ugh! I hate hit and runs.

664
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:37,947
You failed!

665
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,916
Well, as evil partners
in this venture,

666
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:41,785
it's more like we failed.

667
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:43,653
We made a deal!

668
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,656
Oh, but the adrenaline
was pumping,
my heart was racing.

669
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,658
Who remembers
the exact terms?

670
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,026
I do.

671
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:54,698
After them!

672
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,406
Hurry.

673
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:12,315
What's the point?
They'll find us.

674
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:15,151
My magic is weakened
in this forest.
We can't fight them.

675
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,220
--They have us surrounded.

676
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,789
-We're going to be banished.
-Hide.

677
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:23,326
Eclipso, dark opal,

678
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:26,029
by order of the Princess,
show yourselves!

679
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:31,000
Everything is ruined.
We'll never rule gemworld.

680
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,235
It's over.

681
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,336
It's not over.

682
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:35,004
There has to be another way.

683
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:38,775
No, nothing. Not unless we...

684
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:43,012
Oh, no. That will never work.

685
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,681
What? Tell me.

686
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:46,082
There's a gem

687
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:49,719
more powerful than anything
in gemworld.

688
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,688
The prophecy says,

689
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,491
<i> "when the last gem of</i>
<i> an extinct planet</i>

690
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:57,594
<i> "is bound with treasure</i>
<i> from across the universe,</i>

691
00:39:57,596 --> 00:40:00,096
<i> "ultimate power shall reign."</i>

692
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:03,366
Ultimate power.
How do we find this gem?

693
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,835
There must be clues
in the ancient texts.

694
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,505
I will need to remain here
as the royal sorcerer.

695
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:11,775
I could study the ancient text
and locate the gem.

696
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:15,545
Then, with its power,
we can rule
not just gemworld,

697
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:17,113
but the universe.

698
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,883
But I can only do that
if I weren't banished

699
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:23,186
because Princess amethyst
found me blameless
in the coup.

700
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:26,556
I will claim that you were
under the spell of
my black diamond.

701
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:28,591
When you find the gem
of ultimate power,

702
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,527
use the amethyst portal
to find me.

703
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:32,228
Together we will rule.

704
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,598
You take the blame,
I'll get us the gem. Deal?

705
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,342
Eclipso.

706
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:50,980
Where is dark opal?

707
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:52,715
Uh, where am I?

708
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,317
What happened?

709
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,219
I feel woozy.

710
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:59,823
Your little sorcerer
has been under my spell.

711
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:02,125
Oh, Princess amethyst?

712
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,560
Is that you?

713
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,929
What's going on here?

714
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:08,498
So you acted alone
in this treason?

715
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,671
Yes.

716
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:17,440
Then, by the power
of the 12 houses
of gemworld,

717
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:19,142
I banish you.

718
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,749
You gave me your word
and you didn't deliver.

719
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,651
I tried.

720
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,520
"A" for effort, right?

721
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:32,822
We will get that crystal.

722
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,792
Even if I have to go
to earth myself.

723
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:37,594
You're leaving
your nook?

724
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:40,797
But you can't!
There's light out there!

725
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:43,867
Darkness will
overcome the light.

726
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,368
Shadows to me.

727
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:52,375
See anything?

728
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:00,049
Nothing suspicious.

729
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:01,651
Sorry, I haven't seen him.

730
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:03,786
Thanks for
taking a look, Steve.

731
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,822
Batgirl, wait!

732
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:08,458
What is it?
Do you have an idea
about how to fix your battery?

733
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,860
Um, no.

734
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,395
I just wanted some grub.

735
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:14,330
Detective work
makes me hungry.

736
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:17,300
<i> Now, back to</i>
<i> the hero of the year pre-show.</i>

737
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,536
<i> I'm all about</i>
<i> the classic thinkers.</i>

738
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:23,640
<i> Plato, Aristotle and</i>
<i> my main man, socrates.</i>

739
00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:27,143
<i> But when we get into</i>
<i> 19th century idealism,</i>

740
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:30,346
<i> I'm like,</i>
<i> I immanuel kant even.</i>

741
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:32,682
<i> Ew! Enough with</i>
<i> the highbrow humors.</i>

742
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:35,151
<i> Back to me!</i>

743
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:37,854
Shouldn't you be
heading to the
hero of the year ceremony?

744
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:40,423
That villain tried to
steal your crystal.

745
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:43,860
I won't rest or party
until we get him.

746
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:45,094
Another dead end.

747
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:46,863
Well, what now?

748
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:49,699
Should we go back to
school and check
batgirl's surveillance?

749
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,034
We don't have to
go back to school

750
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:52,168
for that anymore.

751
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:00,777
What's this have to do
with surve...

752
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,845
Cool.

753
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,681
Amazing.

754
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:06,616
A super hero is
always prepared.

755
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:08,618
I have a few batcaves
around town.

756
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,257
Where are you,
dark opal?

757
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,358
There!

758
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:19,162
That's centennial park.
Come on!

759
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:27,804
- Bumblebee!

760
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:31,774
My suit's
losing more power.

761
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:35,078
When you're feeling rundown,
you always got a shoulder
to sit on.

762
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,280
-Thanks, batgirl.
-Come on!

763
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,751
You're mine, dark opal.

764
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:47,724
That's what you get
for messing with my friends.

765
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:49,892
I didn't do anything, please!

766
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:51,227
Why were you running?

767
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:54,063
I'm late
for my steampunk
cosplay group.

768
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:55,598
Is that a crime?

769
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,134
No, sorry.

770
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,436
-What now?
-We keep searching.

771
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:02,672
If we split up,
we can cover more territory.

772
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:04,674
Bumblebee and
i will take downtown.

773
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,281
Anyone seen
wonder woman, batgirl,
supergirl or Bumblebee?

774
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:13,816
-Nope.
-Did you check the garden?

775
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,818
I have not seen the girls
you are looking for.

776
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,187
Last I saw,
they were still looking
for dark opal.

777
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,956
Thank you, hawkgirl.

778
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,692
We can't start the ceremony
without two of our nominees.

779
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:25,261
Lois, you have to stall.

780
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:28,965
A mission from
principal waller. Yes!

781
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,200
- Miss martian!

782
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:33,136
I've been wanting
to get a few words from you,
but I can never find you.

783
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:35,972
<i> Um... um... eek!</i>

784
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:38,207
<i> I got a few words for ya.</i>

785
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:40,943
<i> Harley Quinn. Superstar.</i>

786
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:45,982
I told ya.
I don't know anything
about a dark opal

787
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:49,552
or dark topaz or
even a dark cubic zirconia.

788
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:50,953
She's telling the truth.

789
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:53,456
Now, I gotta get back
to my community service.

790
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:57,527
Hey! That's my car!

791
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:59,696
Shouldn't have parked in front
of the fire hydrant.

792
00:44:59,698 --> 00:45:01,197
Pick it up at impound.

793
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:09,138
What do you see?

794
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,107
Nothing.
No sign of dark opal.

795
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,377
Find anything?

796
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:17,180
Yeah. A "buy one, get one"
free smoothie coupon
at capes & cowls cafe.

797
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:19,182
But no intel on dark opal.

798
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:20,983
Bumblebee how's the suit?

799
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:23,052
My battery's draining fast.

800
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:26,589
Every flutter of my wings
takes the power further
into the red.

801
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:28,558
And once the battery dies,

802
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,426
bye-bye super powers.

803
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:33,629
There's gotta be
a better battery
out there, somewhere.

804
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:38,067
Supergirl, your crystal.

805
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:47,009
Kara, my brave
and courageous girl.

806
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,045
Mom?

807
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:51,914
We are sending you
to earth and I'm sorry
we cannot go with you.

808
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,750
I have programed
this crystal,

809
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:55,785
so that you may remember us.

810
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:58,054
But, mom, why...

811
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:01,257
The crystal's powers
will activate when you're
old enough to understand.

812
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,092
When you need to
hear from us,

813
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,927
- our love, family...

814
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,929
<i> A merry good evening</i>

815
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,766
<i> to my favorite hero trio.</i>

816
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:12,535
It's dark opal.

817
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:14,904
He hacked into
my comm-bracelet.

818
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:18,274
<i> Well, that's hardly</i>
<i> the greeting anyone</i>
<i> wants to hear.</i>

819
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,109
<i> But, nonetheless, I'm calling</i>

820
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,245
<i> because I've found</i>
<i> something of yours.</i>

821
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:24,113
<i> -Don't listen to him, babs.</i>
<i> -It's a trap.</i>

822
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,748
<i> Supergirl, stay where you are.</i>

823
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,216
-Dad!
-Mom!

824
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:29,218
<i> I thought about</i>
<i> keeping them as pets.</i>

825
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,220
<i> But I can't deal</i>
<i> with the maintenance.</i>

826
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:34,257
<i> The feeding, the walking.</i>
<i> It's just not for me.</i>

827
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:38,094
<i> So you can have them back.</i>
<i> I want supergirl's crystal.</i>

828
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:41,264
<i> But I couldn't be sure</i>
<i> if she'd give it up</i>
<i> for the kents alone.</i>

829
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:45,568
<i> So, wonder woman</i>
<i> and batgirl, I had</i>
<i> to drag you into this.</i>

830
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:50,139
<i> As her besties,</i>
<i> I bet you'll be</i>
<i> very persuasive.</i>

831
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,242
<i> You three meet me</i>
<i> at booster's gold mine.</i>

832
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:56,245
<i> Come alone</i>
<i> and tell no one.</i>

833
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,952
Come on, girls.

834
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:04,453
Sorry, Bumblebee.

835
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:06,355
He said only the three of us.

836
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:08,257
And with your
battery running low,

837
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:10,259
you should conserve
your energy.

838
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:13,262
You guys. I'm not
letting you go meet
a super villain alone.

839
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:16,299
Batgirl's right.
Our parent's lives
are at risk.

840
00:47:16,301 --> 00:47:18,501
We have to do exactly
what he says.

841
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:21,204
Okay, not much
i can do small anyway.

842
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,143
I may not have
a lot of power left,

843
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:28,544
but I'm still...

844
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:30,713
A hero.

845
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,190
Your plan won't work.

846
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:44,160
Supergirl won't give
you her crystal.
Argh!

847
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:48,030
Alchemist.

848
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:51,701
Bring me the scepter.

849
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:59,742
Master alchemist?

850
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:03,179
But you're an Amazon.
We're sisters.

851
00:48:03,181 --> 00:48:05,014
Not anymore.

852
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:07,250
I serve darkness now.

853
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:08,384
No! Argh!

854
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:17,560
Once the crystal of Krypton
is set upon the scepter,

855
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:20,363
ultimate power will be yours.

856
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:23,232
Long live eclipso.

857
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,700
And dark opal, too!

858
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:26,269
Long live us!

859
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:38,881
- Aunt Martha.
- Dad.

860
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:40,449
- Uncle Jonathan.
- Mom!

861
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:44,887
Uh-uh.

862
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:49,292
No parents for you,
until I get my crystal.

863
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:52,862
-Who are you?
-This is eclipso,
my business partner.

864
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:58,234
Now that
we're properly introduced,
it's gift time.

865
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:02,405
No, supergirl,
if you give them the crystal,
they'll use it against you.

866
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:05,408
But if you don't hand
the crystal over,

867
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:06,575
they get it.

868
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:07,877
Argh!

869
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:10,279
Leave us, supergirl.
Save yourself.

870
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,981
You can still make it out.

871
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:14,650
Take it.

872
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,163
Now release them.

873
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:30,333
Diamond vanish.

874
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:32,969
-Dad.
-Mom.

875
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,136
Are you okay?

876
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,471
And reappear.

877
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:40,943
I call it the eclipso
rule of relativity.

878
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:45,982
"Whatever the black diamond
vanishes must reappear."

879
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,851
- Another one of
my diamond's tricks.

880
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:51,420
The eclipso explosive.

881
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:53,155
- No!
- Don't do it.

882
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,657
Stop!
-I won't let you
hurt my daughter!

883
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:02,865
Try that again
and I'll make it
even worse for them.

884
00:50:04,936 --> 00:50:07,970
Now, for the last
and favorite trick of
my black diamond,

885
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:11,640
I'll need a volunteer or four.

886
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:14,877
- Mom!
- No.

887
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:16,312
- Dad!
- No, stop it!

888
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:17,980
What are
you doing to him?

889
00:50:17,982 --> 00:50:19,982
Meet your new, improved,

890
00:50:19,984 --> 00:50:23,185
evilified league of guardians.

891
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,488
Hail darkness.

892
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:26,622
-No!
-What's happening?

893
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,024
Don't!

894
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:29,191
Oh, no!

895
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:35,698
I gotta get that diamond.

896
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,334
Excellent.
You'll be coming
with us.

897
00:50:38,336 --> 00:50:40,136
Our first minions.

898
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:42,772
Welcome to the eclipso family.

899
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:47,243
I said you're coming with us!

900
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:52,848
-Mom.
-Uncle Jonathan.

901
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,683
-Daddy.
-Aunt Martha.

902
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:55,918
Please.

903
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,955
Stop!
Get out of my head!

904
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,363
What happened?
My diamond
has never failed me.

905
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:08,531
-Supergirl.
-Oh, dear.

906
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:10,332
I'd never leave you.

907
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:13,335
Oh, fine. If you
love them so much,

908
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:15,204
stay here with your babies
to meet your doom.

909
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:19,608
Hurry, eclipso.
Before we meet our doom, too!

910
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:32,054
Whoa!

911
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:46,602
<i> Whoa. Are you getting this?</i>

912
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:51,574
Now, to bring these supers
into my Minion fold.

913
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:54,410
With an army
of evil heroes
at my disposal,

914
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:57,313
no one will dare
protest my power.

915
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,583
My diamond. What?

916
00:52:00,585 --> 00:52:03,586
Doesn't matter now.
You have the scepter.

917
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:04,787
Yes.

918
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,255
The scepter.

919
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:07,656
Darkness, fall!

920
00:52:25,276 --> 00:52:26,775
Hey.
-Who is that?

921
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,144
What happened?
-Whoa! What happened?

922
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:29,678
What is going on?

923
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,680
Greetings, supers.

924
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:33,749
Eclipso and dark opal.

925
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:35,784
I should have known
you two were working
together...

926
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:40,389
Not another step
from any of you.

927
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:47,596
I can't deactivate it.

928
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:49,798
I'll get you out of there.

929
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,967
-Hippolyta!
-I got ya.

930
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:54,670
-We have to save them!
-How can we get past it?

931
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:57,673
I'm on it.

932
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:00,476
Bumblebee.

933
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:03,946
If the diamond can create it,
it can break it.

934
00:53:05,116 --> 00:53:06,549
Bumblebee sting.

935
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:11,520
Oh...

936
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:22,131
- Oh, mom.
- Dad.

937
00:53:22,133 --> 00:53:23,532
Barbara.
My wonderful daughter.

938
00:53:24,135 --> 00:53:25,634
You're okay.

939
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:29,672
-You did it.
-You set us free.

940
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:31,373
Hey, are you all right?

941
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,875
Battery's dead.

942
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,343
Can I catch a ride with you?

943
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:37,146
All aboard
the batgirl express.

944
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,516
What have I done?

945
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:42,184
It's all right, my sister.

946
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:45,254
Come on,
we have to get out of here.

947
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,760
That gem will never hurt
anyone again.

948
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:12,581
Thank you all,
for making this such easy
one stop shopping.

949
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,584
The artifacts from your
distant planets

950
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:21,023
will allow me to control every
sector of the universe.

951
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:22,291
Get them
while they're blabbing.

952
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:26,595
You're proper hero, yo.
Just like hawkgirl taught you.

953
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:30,366
Uh, excuse me.

954
00:54:30,368 --> 00:54:32,101
But we prefer if you left,

955
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:36,972
so, good day to you,
sir and madam.

956
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:38,807
Oh, please.

957
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,042
Ah!

958
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:43,279
Nice catch.

959
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:44,747
-No!
-Stop him.

960
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:46,248
-You can't.
-We will not let you do this.

961
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,316
Get them!

962
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,234
Batgirl, get them to safety.

963
00:55:05,236 --> 00:55:06,835
We'll meet you
back at school.

964
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:16,011
Now, I will be ruler of all.

965
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:20,983
You mean we.
Partners in darkness?
Co-rulers? Remember?

966
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:23,819
For my first act as
queen of everything,

967
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:28,090
I will make
that fiddling Princess
pay for banishing me.

968
00:55:28,092 --> 00:55:31,193
I will destroy
the detestable land
of gemworld.

969
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:32,961
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey now.

970
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:35,297
Gemworld wasn't all bad.

971
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:38,701
The citizens of gemworld
mocked me.

972
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:41,704
In their insolence,
they dare banish me.

973
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:44,940
And you,
you let me take the fall.

974
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:55,117
Eclipso!

975
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,820
Put down that scepter.

976
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,557
I thought I took care
of you already.

977
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,325
Darkness, attack.

978
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:06,662
What's happening?

979
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:07,996
What are these things?

980
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:09,465
They're everywhere!

981
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:11,900
Ugh! Shadows again.

982
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:15,771
Oh, did you come to play?

983
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,679
Who else wants to play?

984
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:26,348
We were
just getting started.

985
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,385
And you should have
a front row seat.

986
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:32,588
Hey!

987
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:49,438
Oh! You are
malleable like the gum
of the bubble.

988
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:54,576
Incoming!

989
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:01,183
You say it's your birthday?

990
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:02,551
I've got a present for you.

991
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:06,021
Don't crowd!
There's plenty for everybody.

992
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:08,123
- Who's next?

993
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:19,468
Ha!

994
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:31,747
Whoo-hoo!

995
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:33,816
Whoo!

996
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:42,491
Beautiful darkness.

997
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:45,561
--Give me the scepter.

998
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:47,329
You promised we'd share.

999
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,040
Eyes on the prize.

1000
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:06,515
Sorry, mom.

1001
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,181
You're not getting away.

1002
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:46,121
Whoo-hoo! That's our girl.

1003
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:47,990
Kicking some villain keister.

1004
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:49,825
Martha. Language.

1005
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:53,896
Sorry. I'm still mad as a cow
over that evil diamond thing.

1006
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:04,406
Boo-yah!

1007
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:09,678
Freezer burn.

1008
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,847
Frost passes it
off to Harley.

1009
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:13,982
And it's Harley
for the win!

1010
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:24,426
That's how we do it
old school.

1011
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,196
Where did eclipso go?

1012
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,601
Palace. The home.

1013
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:36,672
Do I look like
the Internet to you? Details.

1014
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:40,442
- It's...
It's on the moon!
-Anything else?

1015
00:59:40,444 --> 00:59:43,011
I shouldn't have become
a super villain.

1016
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:44,746
I should have
followed my heart

1017
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,815
and been a theater major!

1018
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:48,951
Ugh.

1019
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:55,223
No! My power!

1020
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:57,693
My magic!

1021
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:02,130
You go after supergirl.
I got this one.

1022
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:03,465
Thanks, batgirl.

1023
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:10,138
--Look what the bat dragged in.

1024
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:17,379
Dad, call in
the special crimes unit.

1025
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:19,247
I got one up here for ya.

1026
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:20,315
Careful, babs!

1027
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:22,050
You could...

1028
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:23,652
...pull a muscle!

1029
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:25,320
-Dad!
-I mean,

1030
01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:27,990
that is some
mighty fine police work.

1031
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:37,399
Batgirl, light destroys
the shadows.

1032
01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:41,670
You need to fix
the electricity!

1033
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,907
-I can do that.
-Hey, wait.

1034
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:48,010
Could you put me down first?

1035
01:00:48,012 --> 01:00:51,980
The batgirl express is
on a one-way trip
to motion-sickness-ville.

1036
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:55,317
Oops. Sorry.
You'll be safe here.

1037
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:59,221
<i> Terra firma.</i>
What a day.

1038
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:05,127
My belt.

1039
01:01:05,129 --> 01:01:06,795
Beast boy, can you get it?

1040
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:09,431
- Well, certainly, madam.

1041
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:17,506
I'm back in action.

1042
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:26,481
Um, this is truly
a terrible predicament.

1043
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:28,116
What is a gentleman to do?

1044
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:30,452
Beast boy,
your way was better.

1045
01:01:30,454 --> 01:01:31,987
You gotta go wild.

1046
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:33,555
Well, really?

1047
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:37,325
Well, your wish is
my command, my lady.

1048
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:53,742
-Yeah.
-High eight, momma!

1049
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:56,378
My ring.

1050
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:06,555
Ooh, love hurts.

1051
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:18,567
Ha!

1052
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:25,173
You wanna play games?
How about whack-a-shadow?

1053
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:46,294
Help!

1054
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:48,463
I'm coming, shivs!

1055
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:57,105
Nice. I owe you one.

1056
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:59,107
Nah, it wasn't a favor.

1057
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,542
It's what friends do.

1058
01:03:02,146 --> 01:03:03,645
You really have changed.

1059
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:05,113
Shh. Don't tell anyone.

1060
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,082
If people start believing
I've gone good,

1061
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:08,917
I'll have to show up
to birthday parties,

1062
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:11,920
hand out Valentine's,
and help people move. No.

1063
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,021
It's gross.

1064
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:47,022
They're scared
of the spotlights.

1065
01:03:50,694 --> 01:03:52,327
You're looking succulent.

1066
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:14,983
Ha! Right in the keister.

1067
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:31,399
Come out, eclipso. It's over.

1068
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:32,868
The crystal's gone.

1069
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,836
Lucky you.

1070
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:37,405
I wanted to destroy
my home world.

1071
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:41,209
- But you've already
had that done for you.

1072
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:31,726
Get up! I'm taking you in.

1073
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:53,214
Huh?

1074
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,062
You okay?

1075
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:09,331
-Yeah. Now that you're here.
-Where is she?

1076
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:15,603
There!

1077
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:34,856
- Watch out!

1078
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,542
Huh?

1079
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,285
-Where is she?
-There!

1080
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:06,154
23 degrees on your left.

1081
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:36,584
--Oh, yeah. We won.

1082
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:43,825
A piece
of supergirl's crystal.

1083
01:07:43,827 --> 01:07:45,293
She's going to want this.

1084
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:48,863
Let me out of this lasso.

1085
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:50,498
I'm scared of going to prison.

1086
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,568
Those fluorescent lights
so bright! I hate bright.

1087
01:07:57,874 --> 01:07:59,674
I'll take it from here.

1088
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:04,712
Let me out of here!

1089
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:07,715
-I don't want to share
a ride with her!
-Ugh!

1090
01:08:07,717 --> 01:08:10,018
I don't want to share a ride
with you, more.

1091
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,487
You let children
defeat us again!

1092
01:08:18,962 --> 01:08:20,361
Supergirl!

1093
01:08:20,363 --> 01:08:23,098
I found a piece
of your crystal.

1094
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,299
Thanks, Bumblebee.

1095
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:26,768
Goodbye, mom.

1096
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,236
I miss you.

1097
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:35,443
Nothing can destroy
this crystal.

1098
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:38,813
Because nothing can destroy
my love for you.

1099
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:41,483
Take that love
into your new world.

1100
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:44,219
When you share our love
with others,

1101
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:46,321
you'll create a new family.

1102
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:47,722
Thanks, mom.

1103
01:08:50,227 --> 01:08:51,993
Are you all right, dear?

1104
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:55,230
I am now.
It's good to be home.

1105
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:57,499
Ooh! I love you guys.

1106
01:08:59,603 --> 01:09:01,102
What is it, oracle?

1107
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:04,239
<i> Group hug detected</i>
<i> in sector j.</i>

1108
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:06,441
--You okay?

1109
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:08,943
Yeah, I was just thinking,

1110
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:13,081
if that crystal had enough
power to charge the scepter,
i bet it could power my suit.

1111
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:15,650
Maybe we can make
a battery that replicates it.

1112
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,019
Hold that thought.

1113
01:09:18,021 --> 01:09:21,322
I couldn't help but overhear.
You really think my crystal
could fix your suit?

1114
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:25,260
Maybe. If we could
study it more and see
how it generates power,

1115
01:09:25,262 --> 01:09:27,262
maybe we can make
a synthetic version.

1116
01:09:27,264 --> 01:09:29,964
Why wait?
One sliver of crystal
coming up.

1117
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:31,499
But it's your crystal.

1118
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,368
Mom did say to share.

1119
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:37,472
Thanks, supergirl.

1120
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:41,509
Let me help.

1121
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:43,645
Beast boy, can I borrow
your monocle?

1122
01:09:43,647 --> 01:09:46,047
Keep it.
I don't needs it anymore.

1123
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:54,289
- Whoo-hoo!

1124
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:03,798
Welcome to
the hero of the year gala!

1125
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,901
Hold for applause.
Hold for applause.

1126
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,404
Hello?

1127
01:10:10,674 --> 01:10:12,907
Hey, yo, blanket dude!

1128
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:15,410
We gots to get you
to the party!

1129
01:10:16,246 --> 01:10:18,379
Whoo! What a week!

1130
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,514
Isn't this lovely?

1131
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:25,987
You're all heroes of the year
in my book.

1132
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:28,056
Now dig in
before it gets cold.

1133
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:31,593
Tell me when.

1134
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,335
When!

1135
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:52,046
I brought macaroons!

1136
01:10:52,048 --> 01:10:55,149
Wonderful!
Oh, thank you, Mr. quilt!

1137
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:01,689
And this, young lady,
is for you!

1138
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:06,060
You all did some magnificent
hero-ing this year.

1139
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:08,363
But we have considered
what happened today,

1140
01:11:08,365 --> 01:11:11,899
and Bumblebee
tipped the scales
with her sacrifice.

1141
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:15,236
Congratulations on winning
hero of the year!

1142
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:16,638
- Me?
-Go, Bumblebee!

1143
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,239
--Right on, Bumblebee!

1144
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:19,340
Good job!

1145
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:22,910
-You're the girl, Bumblebee!
-Congrats.

1146
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:25,446
Great hero-ing, Bumblebee.

1147
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,949
-Way to go, honey.
-Up top, baby girl!

1148
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:30,752
-Thanks, mom and dad.
-Well deserved.

1149
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:32,787
Even when you had problems
with your suit,

1150
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:36,891
you persevered
and your heroic heart
stayed true.

1151
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:41,129
I had a whole speech
about the smallest hero
making the biggest difference,

1152
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:44,599
but I guess everybody's
rumbly tummies couldn't wait.

1153
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:46,334
You're not mad I didn't win?

1154
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:50,104
It's just a trophy.
You will always
be my hero.

1155
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:52,440
Ah! There's an olive
in your salad.

1156
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:55,677
-You don't like olives.
-Aw. You remembered!

1157
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,479
Aw. No pumpernickel?

1158
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,315
Good thing I brought my own!

1159
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:02,283
Mmm.

1160
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:05,653
Armpit pumpernickel's
my jam!

1161
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,789
So good!

1162
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:10,491
If you like this,
you should be here
for the holidays

1163
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,527
when Martha
really goes all out.

1164
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:14,462
That's a great idea!

1165
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:17,432
Barda, why don't you
stay with us over
the holiday break?

1166
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:19,434
You're invited, too,
lady Shiva.

1167
01:12:19,436 --> 01:12:22,637
Yeah! I'll be here
and there's an extra
bunk bed in the attic.

1168
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:24,939
So, wanna stay with me
and my family?

1169
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:26,974
-Uh, all right.
-Okay.

1170
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:29,811
Hey, shivs.
I'll rock paper scissors you
for top bunk.

1171
01:12:29,813 --> 01:12:32,480
One, two, three.

1172
01:12:32,482 --> 01:12:34,615
-Paper!
-Uh, what?

1173
01:12:34,617 --> 01:12:36,984
On what planet
does paper beat rock?
