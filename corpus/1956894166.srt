Oh, sorry, Angie.
Sorry.

19
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:27,388
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Nice one, Wyatt.

20
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,856
- Making a movie?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,091
Sociology project.
I have to make a short film

22
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,761
on a unique and interesting
aspect of high school life,

23
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:37,030
if I can just figure out how
to work that thing or settle
on a subject matter.

24
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:40,100
- You know?
- White balance was maxed out.

25
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:43,204
Oh. Thanks.

26
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,673
I don't know if you knew,
but I'm captain of

Quiz Bowl team.

28
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,311
You should, um, do it on us.

00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,945
Like a tribute film.

30
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,547
You know, I would,

31
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:56,317
but four people in my class
have already asked
for that topic.

32
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,918
- Really?
- No.

33
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,321
It doesn't really meet
the interesting requirement.

34
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,722
Sorry.

you want some attention?

- No, I'm good.

Yo, Lyle, what'd you think
of that game last night?

53
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:57,545
Aw, man, it was sweet.
I slayed, like, three
gargantuan--

54
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,280
You slayed?
[scoffs]

55
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,049
You're not still playing
that lame video game,

56

Nerd Quest, or whatever?

57
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,221
What? N-- No.

58
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:08,922
I meant I watched Manning

59
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:11,292
slay the Jets'
gargantuan secondary.

60
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,860
- Right?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,362
Confident? Please.

62
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:15,863
The only real threat
is Council Rock Tech,

63
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,366
and they're, like, a clan
of level 6 Newbs

64
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,800
trying to raid
an Elite Orc Camp

65
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,969
in desperate search
for the Pouting Rod, okay?

66
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,004
Everybody knows you gotta be
level 45 to do that.

67
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,376
Hold on.

Zoe, uh, we still on
for that thing later tonight?

70
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,551
If by "that thing,"
you mean you tutoring me

71
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,853
while my dad pays you,
then yes.

72
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,290
Sweet.
Um, I was thinking maybe...

73
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,724
Yeah, she said no.

74
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:47,295
- Why, actually--
- Uh, no means no, dweeb.

75
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,663
So you should quit
with the stalking and get.

76
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,335
- Hey, freak.
- Mannequin.

77
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,169
- Knob.
- Chafe.

78
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,838
Good one, Dante.

79
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,607
Die, quiz clown.

80
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,609
All righty.

81
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,112
He jests.

82
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,520
When I get into high school,
I'm gonna cheat.

83
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,922
Not if you wanna go to MIT.

84
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:18,191
You don't have to spell it.
Besides, I'm going
to a party school.

85
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,461
How come you're such a drag?

86
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,463
I have plenty of fun, okay?

87
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,998
Not with humans.
Here's an idea.

88
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,734
Shelly Nolan.

89
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,402
She's a human.

90
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:30,371
A little splotchy
but gettable.

91
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,573
It's a start.

92
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,576
Yeah. Unfortunately,
girls treat me

93
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,578
like I'm
a Maniacal Banshee of Death,

94
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,947
which would be great
if I wanted to date
a White-maned Wolveress,

95
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,049
but not so great if I was
dating an actual person.

96
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,485
Look, can you just go to sleep
and let me get my game on

97
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,286
so I can be appreciated
somewhere for an hour?

98
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,589
Shelly Nolan, dude.

99
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,225
Don't mind the back brace.

100
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,864
Blast-a-ton.

102
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,232
What's up, ladies?

103
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,034
That's right.
Black Death is back.

104
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:09,543
There he is.
How's the world's best
half-time speech writer doing?

105
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,745
He's, uh-- He's doing.

106
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,447
Good. Glad to hear it.

107
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,085
You're not playing
that game again, are you?

108
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,820
Lyle, let me tell you something.

109
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,022
Nobody ever made it
to the end of their life

110
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,324
and said, "I wish I were
a bigger nerd."

111
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,694
Just trying to help.
Oh, and don't forget.

112
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,497
I need you
at the rally next week
down at the dealership.

113
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,298
I'm trying out
the new slogan.

114
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,633
"Hugginson for mayor,

115
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,303
a family man
you can wrap your arms around."

116
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,239
That means the family
represents, okay?

117
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,274
Good talk.

118
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:42,743

Thunder Pole.

121
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,388
What's up, Black Death?

122
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:57,425
Where's Bickle at?

123
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,902
[sighs]

124
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,571
I thought we had a contract.

125
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,406
That you forced me into,
Barbara,

126
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,242
after I shaved the class bunny
in third grade.

127
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,110
It's "Mom," and don't deflect.

128
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,046
This is about
your impulse issues.

129
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,916
- And the contract--
- Is over seven years old.
I signed it in crayon.

130
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,653
Look, I know you think
everything is a big joke,

131
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:30,458
but I am juggling brochures
from five different
boarding schools right now.

132
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:33,026
All of them would be more
than happy to help you

133
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,228
- ...with your self-control
problems...
- And take your money.

134
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,631
if you hit three strikes.

135
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:39,667
Now, how's the homework?

136
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,334
- Is it done?
- What homework?

137
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:45,372
Oh, my God. Computer off.
Get to work.

138
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,076
Game on.

139
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,114

Yeah, my bad. My bad.

- I was just--
- [Wyatt] Whoa. Whoa.
Zip it, okay?

144
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,424
No sharing of personal
details ever. Ruin the whole
dynamic of the game.

145
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,860
I was just gonna say
I was busy making out
with your mom.

- [laughs]
- [Wyatt] Rule number 4:

If you're gonna slam another
player, at least be funny

148
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,800

my dad used in the '80s.

He's my bard.

155
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,879
It gives him pleasure
to sing about my exploits.

156
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,716
And I can't help it
if the ladies love me.

157

I'm a straight pimp. What?

Fine.

Sorry, man.

I think we have ourselves
a cheat code.

- Wow.
- Cool.

Just give me a second while
I can check the boards
to see what--

Leroy Jenkins!

173
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,461
And he jumped in.
Awesome.

174
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,029
Why does he always do that?

175
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,498

00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:26,073
- Tulta Munille.
- Tulta Munille!

178
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,314
[screaming]

179
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,884
Watch this.

180
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,656
Haley's vomit!

181
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,793
That's what I'm talking about,
Wizza!

182
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:48,028
Where are we anyway?

183
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,297
I could've told you if you
waited for me to look it up.

184
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,700
Waiting sucks.
NeverFail's one of

185
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,268
the most elite clans ever,

186
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:58,572
because we don't think,
we act.

187
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,308
[grunts]

188
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,611
Nice.

189
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:11,084
Cha-ching.

190
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,121
And done.

191
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,723
What?

192
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,558
You guys see this?

193
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:23,063
It must be a beta test level.

194
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,532
[Dante]
Dude, let's check it out.

195
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,270
Maybe it's where we find
the weapon we need
to fight Maldark.

196
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,905
Okay. I'm pretty sure
the location

197
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,240
of the all-powerful weapon

198
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,942
to defeat the final boss
of the game

199
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,011
wouldn't be all glitchy
like this.

200
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,413
Yeah, but it might have
a big old dragon.

201
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,617
- [Dante] Let's go get it.
- [Lyle] Whoa. Hold on.

202
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:49,156
[all]
Tulta Munille!

203
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,324
Wizza, help me lay down
some suppressive fire.

204
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:52,960
Sir, beat him down
on the inside.

205
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:56,229
Okay, on my mark.
And now!

206
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,932
[computer voice]
Kilauea! Kilauea!

207
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,768
- That's nice.
- We pull back?

208
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,570
[Wyatt]
No retreat.

209
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,279
Oh!
[laughing]

210
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,614
- Yeah!
- Huzzah!

211
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:18,118
Oh, gee. That deserves
something so much cooler
than a "huzzah."

212
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,453
- That was sweet.
- Treasure time.

213
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,523
[Dante]
Give me that. Come on.
Come on. Stupid beta.

214
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,226
I'm clicking the rod,
but it's not giving me
my lollipop.

215
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,261
- Weird.
- Maybe if we try it together?

216
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,297
[Wyatt]
Control, alt, push, guys.

217
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,934
[Dante]
Click harder. Click harder!

218
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,568
[electricity arcing]

219
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,137
- Huh?
- [arcing continues]

220
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,839
Come on.
Give up the loot.

221
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,808
[computer voice]
Ah, the loot.

222
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,043
You desire a petty trinket,
do you?

223
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,012
Well, on this day,

224
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:49,116
- the treasure is greater
than you could ever imagine.
- What?

225
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,485
Uh, the game just
respond to me?

226
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,088
Must be why the cave's
so janky.

227
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,191
Programmers were concentrating
on the interactive AI.

228
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,326
Cool.

229
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,595
Who is this AI
of whom you speak?

230
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,098
- Maldark?
- Can't be.

231
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,968
We're ten levels from
the final battle, and we
don't even have the weapon.

232
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,502
- Who cares? Let's get him.
- Wait!

233
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,705
Fools!

234
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:13,173
[Dante]
Come on.

235
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,709
You dare to challenge me?

236
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:19,312
Stand aside.
I must sound the horns of war

237
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,314
and prepare the assault
on the world

238
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,450
you have just
opened up for me.

239
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:27,620
- Oh, expansion pack!
- [both] Expansion pack!

240
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:31,658
So this is some sort
of viral marketing campaign.
I see.

241
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,095
Place the cheat code
and lure us into the cave.
Very clever, guys.

242
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,898
Prepare for your doom.

243
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,834
The conqueror of all worlds

244
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:44,772
is upon you!

245
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,639
[sinister laughter]

246
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,510
- [electricity arcing]
- Wait.

247
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,512
What?

248
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,915
[Dante]
Ah! Barbara?

249
00:11:54,948 --> 00:12:00,954
**** [romantic]

250
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,691
What's that?

251
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,259
Cops.

252
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,495
- Sorry, Officer. We...
- [Troll growling]

253
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,098
[both screaming]

254
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,600
[Boy]
Did you see the news?

255
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,703
- What are you talking about?
- When bears attack, man.

256
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,472
[Anchorman]
Homework turned to horror
for two students.

257
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,142
They drove here to study
for a biology project

258
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,144
when their studying
was suddenly interrupted

259
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,146
by a terrifying bear attack.

260
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,580
[Boy]
It wasn't a bear, okay?

261
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,782
It was some type of monster

262
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,317
with a club and claws,

263
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,352
and it came out of
this portal thingy.

264
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,287
Why would a bear
wanna steal my cell phone?

265
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,289
It's nothing more than two kids
who banged up their car,

266
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,958
and they're looking
for an excuse to cover it up.

267
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,559
There are no bears
in Daventry Hills.

268
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,294
[Anchorman]
Police released a sketch

269
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,164
of the rogue bear
and ask if anyone sees it,

270
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,766
to please call animal control.

271
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,568
Sweet mother of pearl.

272
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,970
That's no bear.

273
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,005
That's a fricking troll!

274
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,774
What? Troll?

275
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:59,579
[chuckles]
We should fricking roll.

276
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,915
[Dante]
This is crazy.

277
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,917
[Wyatt]
What happened here?

278
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,119
[Lyle]
Seriously, what is going on?

279
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,121
[Wyatt]
Word is Maldark and his army

280
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,257
rolled in
and destroyed everything.

281
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,393
Are we sure they're not
just launching a new game

282
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,895
or an add-on maybe?

283
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,564
By enslaving and burning

284
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,700
and pillaging and killing off
people's characters.

285
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,102
Who would wanna play that?

286
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,803
Yeah, when you can sit at home
on your couch

287
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,839
and watch trolls
on the local news.

288
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:28,675
What'd you just say?

289
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,111
Uh, nothing.

290
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,982
No. No, you definitely
said something.

291
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,284
Okay. No, it's-- It--

292
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,619
This is-- Last night,
we had a power outage.

293
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,954
Okay? I mean--

294
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,890
It was nothing. May--

295
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:43,957
Maybe there was a--

296
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:47,427
Freak troll assault?

297
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,828
Oh, Lordy.

298
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:52,499
Where do you guys live?

299
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,634
America.

300
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,336
North.

301
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,771
Daventry Hills.

302
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,908
You gotta be kidding me.

303
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,442
Me, too.

304
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,078
Wonderful.
We're neighbors.

305
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,779
That's-- That's fabulous.

306
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,548
So should we start preparing
for our doom now?

307
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,651
Because I think
we just released a monster

308
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,020
from a video game.

309
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,922
- You're crazy.
- What? No way.

310
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,457
We need to meet.

311
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,761
I.R.L.

312
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,748
Tulta Munille.

313
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:44,117
Tulta Munille?

314
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,253
[chuckling]
Oh...

315
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,521
- Oh, come on!
- Wow!

316
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,958
- No, no, no! No way!
- This is unbelievable!

317
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,960
- Oh, man!
- Wait.

318
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,963
This criminal and you?

319
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:59,166
Black Death...in the flesh.

320
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,833
Big pimp, huh?

321
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:04,471
Which makes the QB Wizza.

322
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,406
You're the honorable knight,
Sir Bickle?

323
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,545
I guess that's just
in the game.

324
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,349
Awesome. We're all super-secret
computer buddies.

325
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,285
Let's buy a van
and solve mysteries.

326
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,519
[imitates Scooby-Doo laugh]

327
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,188
What are the odds?

328
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,722
Yeah. I don't know, geek,

329
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,958
but I'm sure you just love
to figure them out.

330
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,459
I'm the geek?

331
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,629
You're a level 68 sorcerer
who still says "huzzah."

332
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,632
I mean, what if your O line
knew about that?

333
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:40,307
They're never going to know.

334
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,979
You know what? This--
This is a waste of my time.

335
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,248
Yeah.

336
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,885
I don't think
you wanna do that.

337
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:56,456
If something's going on here,
it could get traced back to us.

338
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,363
Yeah, that doesn't work for me.

339
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,266
Okay, look,
chances are, it's nothing.

340
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,635
But you gotta admit,

341
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:12,572
it might be kind of cool
if it is,

342
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,275
right?

343
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,698
What are we
looking for anyway?

344
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,868
I don't know.
I never got my troll tracking
merit badge.

345
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,671
- Oh, no?
- No. How about footprints?
A trail?

346
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,039
[squelch]

347
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,675
Or that.

348
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,078
- Ohh.
- That's a lot of scat.

349
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,680
- Gross.
- It's this way.

350
00:16:56,549 --> 00:17:01,154
- [creature growling]
- [animal squealing]

351
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,064
And it's a troll.

352
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:14,467
[belches]

353
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,535
[groans]

354
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,237
Maybe we should call the cops

355
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,506
or the zoo or Peter Jackson.

356
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,342
You know, let him
digest his pig.

357
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,043
That was a pig, right?

358
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,445
Wouldn't it be cool
if it was real?

359
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,680
Okay.
It's a level 2 swamp troll

360
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,716
from the Alpha Clan
with an apprentice war club.

361
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,884
Let's just bum-rush this turd
and take him out, all right?

362
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,354
Whoa. Hold up, Hitler.
Why are you calling
the shots now?

363
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,223
- Because I'm the leader.
- What?

364
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,491
No, you're not.
Okay, I started the clan.

365
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,993
I organize missions.
I solve the puzzles.

366
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:44,797
Besides, I got a bard,
four wives, and mansions
in three provinces.

367
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,334
So I'm pretty sure
that puts me in charge.

368
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:51,238
Okay, so what's your plan,
almighty leader?

369
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,973
Bum-rush the turd on three?

370
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,410
- Whatever.
- Great.

371
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:00,513
All right. One, two--

372
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,349
Leroy Jenkins!

373
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:06,686
[all yelling]

374
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,157
[screaming]

375
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,358
Retreat!

376
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:14,494
Oh!
[groaning]

377
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,163
Run!

378
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:20,333
[yelling]

379
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,269
Down! Down!

380
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,936
I think I literally have
a stick up my butt.

381
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,206
Hey, man, we need
a different game plan.

382
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,107
Yeah, well, switching plays
ain't gonna cut it, champ.

383
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,443
- All right?
Maybe if we had a weapon
- [thudding footsteps]

384
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,445
from the game,
we could dispatch that fool,
but...

385
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,481
Your mom's 3-wood?

386
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,850
We're gonna need
a bigger boat.

387
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,719
So let's get them.

388
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,954
- What? The weapons?
- Yeah, I admit,

389
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,157
okay, it might be impossible,
but think about it.

390
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,492
That guy got out, right?

391
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,727
And he's just
programming code.

392
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,128
Same as our weapons.

393
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,663
Hey, the portal.

394
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,665
You think there's a way
that we can reopen that?

395
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,368
Worth a shot.

396
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:57,904
[troll belches]

397
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,472
What if he can smell us, man?

398
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:02,309
What are you doing?
Man, are you hacking the game?

399
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,810
Okay, I'm simply doing
some packet editing

400
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,345
which will allow me
to scan and reconfigure

401
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,813
certain variables
within the program.

402
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,282
- What the what?
- He's hacking the game.

403
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,651
Why didn't you say that?

404
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,020
One small step for gamer,

405
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:18,291
one giant leap for gamer-kind.

406
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,360
Ooh!

407
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,329
Ooh!

408
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:25,865
Okay.

409
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:29,402
So, that's worth a "huzzah."

410
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:30,770
Huzzah.

411
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,673
What do you want me
to bring out?

412
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,876
You kidding me?
Everything, dude.

413
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,646
Yeah.

414
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,948
Whoa.

415
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,352
[typing]

416
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,555
Aah.

417
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,457
[whoosh]

418
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,761
[metallic clattering]

419
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,997
Yeah.

420
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,400
Maybe we should just stick
with our primary weapons.

421
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,434
Yeah.

422
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:07,774
[whirring]

423
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,146
Man, I don't know
how to work this thing.

424
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,948
How do you do it
in the game, Lyle?

425
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,618
Uh, I hit a function key
on my computer like
the rest of you.

426
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,321
Doesn't your character
say some crazy stuff
before you fire?

427
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,891
- Like some sort of incantation?
- No. No way.

428
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,426
Man, that's totally lame.

429
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,961
- [troll growling]
- Yeah. Come on, tough guy.

430
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:32,665
Embrace your inner geek
and cast away.

431
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:37,003
[flatulence]

432
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,538
Haley's vomit.

433
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,974
[whirring]

434
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,811
- [growling]
- Oh! That was a bad idea!

435
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,813
Why don't you say it
like you mean it next time, huh?

436
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:47,914
Work the blades and go,
"Chops a lotta!"

437
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:48,981
Hey, man, I would if I could!

438
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,216
- Okay?
- [roars]

439
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,820
It's on like Donkey Kong,
big guy!

440
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,489
[yells]

441
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,725
- I can't feel my hands!
- I can't shoot him!

442
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,192
This thing has, like,
a hundred types of ammo!

443
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,728
I don't know what's
gonna come out!

444
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,598
- I don't care! Just do it!
- [whirring]

445
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:09,636
What?
Come on!

446
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,270
- Hurry! Hurry!
- [yelling]

447
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:12,872
- [applause, cheering]
- What?

448
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,641
We didn't even win anything!
No!

449
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,943
[whirring]

450
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,545
- [barks]
- Ohh!

451
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:19,846
- Oh.
- A dog?

452
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:20,913
[whines]

453
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,149
- [panting]
- Ahh.

454
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,318
- [ferocious barking]
- [gasps]

455
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:27,954
[roaring]

456
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,423
- Yeah! Get him!
- Kill him, boy!

457
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:33,460
Haley's vomit!

458
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,827
[whines]

459
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:37,364
[Boys yelling]

460
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,198
No!

461
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,900
His collar!

462
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,636
- My bad!
- [roaring]

463
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:49,476
[Boys screaming]

464
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,415
- [roars]
- [Wyatt screaming]

465
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:58,250
Save the geek, save the world.

466
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:02,021
Save the geek,
save the world!

467
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,857
Oh, you hurt it!

468
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,526
That's what I do, baby.

469
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,560
[laughing]

470
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:08,628
[yells]

471
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,631
[groaning]

472
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,799
My arm.

473
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,835
[groaning continues]

474
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:20,640
Wyatt, do something, please!

475
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,577
- I don't wanna die, Wyatt!
- [weapon whirring]

476
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:27,614
[screaming]

477
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,390
Yeah, eat it, troll-holio!

478
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,925
Hey, is it dead?

479
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,794
Please be dead. Please be dead.

480
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,963
- [groans]
- Ew. Gross.

481
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,331
What are you doing?

482
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,801
Looting the Jolly Green Giant,
my friends.

483
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:51,137
You see?
A leather glove.

484
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,039
I can flip this.

485
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,941
- To who?
- I don't know.

486
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:59,646
The local armor?
We're not trying to level up
our characters here.

487
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,680
[roars]

488
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,717
[Boys yelling]

489
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,820
- Kill it!
- [yells]

490
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:11,524
Oh! Ohhh!

491
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:15,828
Whoa.

492
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,697
Double whoa.

493
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,501
I think we just sent this
back to the computer world.

494
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:22,802
Yeah.

495
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,171
[laughing]

496
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:29,542
- Oh.
- Ohhhh!

497
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,223
My old friends,

498
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,225
Wizza, Black Death,

499
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,528
and Sir Bickle.
[chuckles]

500
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:52,098
What have you done
with my scout?

501
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,333
We sent him packing.

502
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,936
Mm-hmm. We sent his
big fat avatar butt

503
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,638
right back
to the computer world.

504
00:23:58,671 --> 00:23:59,806
Buh-buh-bye.

505
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,608
Arrogant fools!

506
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:04,511
You have no right
to stand in the way

507
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:06,312
of my destiny.

508
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:08,748
Prophecies written foretold

509
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,717
of my legend.

510
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,154
[breaking up]
Your powers are
no match for mine.

511
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:19,626
Soon I shall have harnessed
all the energy I need

512
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,661
- ...to deploy my armies-
- Sorry? What--

513
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:25,131
And I'll crush
your world comp--

514
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,900
Blasted place
is killing me here!

515
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:30,336
S-Sorry, "Maldork."

516
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,972
Looks like a glitch now.

517
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:35,575
- Time for a reboot.
- Wait.

518
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,880
And the crowd goes wild!

519
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,882
It might've been helpful
to ask him a few questions

520
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,517
before you bashed him away,
don't you think?

521
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:46,919
Sounded to me like
he was planning something.

522
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,655
Yeah, well, it's done.

523
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:51,090
Finito. Kaput.
Here you go.

524
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:53,660
Jeeves, bring the car around.

525
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:57,329
That works for me, man.
I gotta bounce.

526
00:24:57,363 --> 00:25:00,466
- Peace.
- Wait. So, that's it?

527
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,402
We're just supposed
to go back to our normal lives?

528
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,971
[Dante]
Let me tell you something,

That's right. I got a bard.

how redonkulously awesome
I was,

Hey, Zoe, uh, sorry.
Sorry about last night.

556
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,717
We should probably have
a make-out--

He's not gonna be there.

You're not--
You're not coming. Sorry.

00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:40,667
Fine. But blow me off again,

and I'll ruin you more
than he just did.

563

It's crazy time
out there, Wyatt,
and not just game stuff.

580
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,455
I swear I saw some pop-up ads
jacking some old lady in town.

581
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,224
That weird "click me" guy?

582
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:39,959
And the chick in the bikini.

583
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,128
There's a chick in a bikini
asking people to click her?

584
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,930
- Double click.
- Okay, okay.

585
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:46,733
It's gotta
all be connected somehow.

586
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:50,469
It's like-- It's like
when we pushed the rod in,

587
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,204
we let Maldark
loose in our grid.

588
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,340
Now he's just toying with us.

589
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:57,476
No. No, he's testing
his powers.

590
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,613
- Hey, look. The jock talks.
- Bite me, Wyatt.

591
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,315
You know, it's totally
acceptable for you

592
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,784
to not insult me in school.

593
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,919
You know what?
If I didn't insult you,

594
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:08,821
then people would actually
suspect something's up.

595
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,689
Like what, you're semi-human?

596
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,859
What happened to you?
We used to be friends.

597
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,560
I know it was
in elementary school,

598
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:17,029
but we had friendship bracelets.

599
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,464
Yeah. Whatever.

- Oh. Not good.
- What's up with that?

603
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:30,877
It's an app that detects leaks

604

from the computer world.
Wrote it myself.

605
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:39,451
I got two pop-up ads,
a bard, and three
mystery creatures.

00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:41,453
What are we looking for anyway?

Ghouls. Nasty.

Lyle, don't you have
a "find undead" spell?

610
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,561
Hey, jackhammer.

611
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:52,832
He's talking to you.

You've gotta ditch that dude.

00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:08,915
I would, but it's kind of nice
having someone around here
who knows that I crush it.

618
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:24,496
- Yo, Wizza.
- Lyle.

[whispering]
Lyle, I'm thinking
something fire or air-based.

gotten us killed.

Okay.
I'll get rid of him

as soon as you
stop acting like a madman.

690

before you act.

Just log on
and take down Maldark there.

We need Max Ross.

705
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,542
- You're nuts.
- He created the game.

706
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,811
We all know he lives in orbit
on his own space station.

707
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:09,047
That's an urban legend.
He's in cryogenic freeze
under Bill Gates' house.

708
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:11,450
Okay, guys.
His company has a server farm
right near here.

709
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,485
- Okay? We can find him.
- [beeps]

710
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,787
In the meantime, we just need
to destroy whatever leaks.

711
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:17,389
As long as my mom
doesn't destroy me first.

712
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:20,892
I gotta go. I'm sorry.
I really gotta go.

713
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,847
Really?
It's after curfew.

714
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,082
You didn't call.
You didn't answer your cell.

715
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,152
Hey, I looked into
your homework file.

716
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:48,554
You haven't even started
the essay that's due tomorrow.

717
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,721
Strike two.

718
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,791
Dude-- Barbara-- Mom--

719
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,761
You want strike three?

720
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,536
Who's Max Ross?

721
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,105
Just-- Just a guy
that I'm doing a report on.

722
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:10,442
- You're acting suspicious.
- Hmm.

723
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:17,583
I suspect you.

724
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,685
[beeping]

725
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,787
** Whoa *

726
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,955
[Anchorman]
Residents of Daventry Hils

727
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,891
are once again on pins
and needles

728
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,993
after a recent series
of bizarre events

729
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,362
rocked this normally
tranquil town.

730
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:33,632
Whatever it was
tore the satellite dish
off my RV,

731
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,801
tried to eat my tool shed,

732
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,069
and left a crop circle
in my pachysandra.

733
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:42,574
The mayor's office continues
to receive reports
of other odd incidents,

734
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:45,010
including sporadic
power outages.

735
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:47,346
The power company
and local police insist

736
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:50,416
none of the events
appear to be related.

737
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:53,018
- Do we have to?
- We have to.

738
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:55,754
** A-one for the money
and a-two for the show *

739
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:58,156
** A-three to be a leged
even if I'm poor **

740
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,327
** I ain't chasin' nothi',
you gonna have to catch me *

741
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,694
[explosion]

742
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:04,296
It's okay.

743
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,498
She probably
had a virus anyway.

744
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:09,435
* I'm the bomb
and about to blow up *

745
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:13,772
* I'm the bomb and about
to blow up, whoa *

746
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,642
[Anchorman]
Late last night,
members of a local scout troop

747
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,143
filmed strange explosios

748
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,346
in the Daventry Hills
Campground.

749
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,013
It's an alien invasion.

750
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,216
Lock up your women.

751
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,653
[phone beeping]

752
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,223
Oh, boy.

753
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:34,192
** I'm the bomb
and about to blow up **

754
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:36,228
** I'm the bomb
and about to blow up **

755
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:39,531
** I'm the bomb
and about to blow up **

756
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:41,533
[roars]

757
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:45,637
[all yelling]

758
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:48,774
** The devil's been
in downtown for too long *

759
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:52,544
** I feel the sun rising
all up in my bones *

760
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:56,181
[phone beeping]

761
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,183
There seems to be
no end in sight

762
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,620
to the strange occurrences
in Daventry Hills.

763
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:05,457
Reporting live
outside Xander's
Computer World, Te--

764
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,932
This campaign speech
is killing me.

765
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:17,769
Why don't you
just write it from your heart?

766
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:21,072
Remember when we used
to play that card game,
Ani-Warriors, at recess?

767
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:22,641
And that one time,
those fifth graders

768
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:25,644
came up and said that
Ani-Warriors was for babies.

769
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:29,247
You stood up to them.
You gave them that
awesome speech

770
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,249
about how cool the game was,
and if they ever had a chance

771
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:33,985
to take down
an armored Zebra Tank
with a Rolling Wombat,

772
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,687
they'd know better.

773
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:37,956
Seconds later,
they were playing, too.

774
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,460
You can still do that.

775
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:42,794
[sighs]

776
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,463
No, I can't.

777
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:45,697
Why not?

778
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:47,766
Because I'm not a child, Wyatt.

779
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:51,236
There's expectations,
implications.

780
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,772
There's gonna be a lot
of people watching.

781
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,742
Maybe you should
just write down whatever
you think they wanna hear.

782
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,310
You're really great with that.

783
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:01,480
[typing]

784
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,482
What?

785
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,584
What?

786
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,219
I think I just found Max Ross,

787
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:12,891
and he's practically
in our backyard.

788
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:24,503
You think this guy's
gonna be cool with us
just rolling up on his McCastle?

789
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:28,106
Absolutely not.
But it's not like we
really have a choice, right?

790
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,609
Right.

791
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,055
[Man]
No solicitors!

792
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:45,891
You have two seconds
to vacate the premises

793
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:47,359
before I unleash the hounds.

794
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:48,894
[scoffs]
Hounds.

795
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,462
We're not selling anything.

796
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,898
We need to speak to Mr. Ross
about Maldark.

797
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,967
Max Ross doesn't do autograph,
he doesn't give free hints,

798
00:38:56,001 --> 00:39:00,439
- ...and he won't do interviews
for any lame geek-boy fansite.
- Lame? That's it.

799
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,908
- I'm done with this guy.
- [yells]

800
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:04,910
- [grunts]
- [yells]

801
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,045
How did you do that?
You with DARPA, huh?

802
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,281
You with the feds?
I know you've been after me
for years, man.

803
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:13,184
You've been scanning my brain.
I have heard the helicopters,

804
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,186
and I have seen the chem trails!

805
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,924
- Yeah, that's-- that's not us.
- [whirring]

806
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,092
Then how?

807
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,429
Level 65 door-be-gone spell.

808
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:29,334
Using a...Thunder Pole?

809
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,136
- Such a--
- Yeah.

810
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:33,004
Don't touch me.
Thank you.

811
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,473
Huge fan. Not touching.

812
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:36,675
No, no.
You don't understand.

813
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,810
I mean, whatever caused
these anomalies

814
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:41,613
didn't come from
within my game,
it came from without.

815
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:45,250
- Don't touch that!
- But Maldark seems to be
controlling everything.

816
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:47,385
Probably is.

817
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:49,588
- He's a brilliantly programmed
evil genius,
- [crash]

818
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,923
thank you very much,
seizing a golden opportunity

819
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,560
to act on his core objective--
conquer all worlds.

820
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,895
And guess which world is next.

821
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,530
Ours?

822
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:01,433
Rhetorical, idiot.
Of course ours.

823
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:05,737
You mean that dragon we slayed
was some sort of

824
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:08,406
in-game visualization
of the firewall?

825
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,509
So that means
when we pushed the rod in--

826
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:14,012
You opened up a gateway
for Maldark's computer world
to our world.

827
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,615
Hard to believe,
but he might be an even better
programmer than I am.

828
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,416
Wait. He thinks
he's a programmer?

829
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,719
Have you even played the game?

830
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,621
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

831
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,856
Rhetorical.
No, lightweight.

832
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,859
He thinks he's a wizard
manipulating magic.

833
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:30,596
From the sounds of it,
I'd say you only have
a few days

834
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,831
before he finds
a computing power source
juiced up enough

835
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,366
for him and his army
to come out and join the fun.

836
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,137
- [cow lows]
- [Wyatt] This orb
must be some sort of sensor

837
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,740
that guides him
to the portal's hot spots.

838
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,175
Figured you were the smart one
since you didn't get the looks.

839
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:45,911
Thanks?

840
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,079
So then that's what the ghouls
were looking for at the school.

841
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,582
Ghouls? They didn't suck
anyone's soul out, did they?

842
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:52,150
- [cow passes gas, lows]
- No.

843
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,886
Good. Don't ever let them
suck anyone's soul.

844
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,556
- What?
- Do you realize that your game

845
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:59,725
is trying to destroy our world?

846
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:02,160
You know, you say that
like it's a bad thing.

847
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,563
What? Look, in my world,

848
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:06,698
people are forced into action
and become heroes,

849
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:09,334
and they are properly rewarded
for their hard work.

850
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,570
Out here, life is boring,

851
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:14,573
life isn't fair,
and life blows hot chunks.

852
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:17,342
Besides, while I'd agree
that Maldark is a cruel

853
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,512
and blood-thirsty leader,
he's also incredibly efficient.

854
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:23,982
I mean, sure,
those of us he doesn't kill
will be enslaved.

855
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,717
- [laughs]
- Can't you just shut

856
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,586
the server farm down
and end this?

857
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,721
And interrupt the gameplay

858
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:32,924
of tens of thousands
of subscribers?

859
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:36,261
A pox on you
for suggesting such a thing.

860
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:37,996
Not that it would
have any effect.

861
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,831
He's no longer confined
to the game.

862
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:42,033
Haven't seen any sign of him
for a few days now.

863
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:46,337
He's kind of just...

864
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,373
floating out there.

865
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:50,508
[Boys gasp]

866
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,544
Do you think
he'll wanna meet me?

867
00:41:52,578 --> 00:41:53,779
[shells clattering]

868
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:58,016
Ten. Okay.

869
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:03,521
Stop the car.
Stop. Stop it!

870
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:06,024
[tires screech]

871
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,062
[growls]

872
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:14,232
Wait. Wait!

873
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,567
[yelling, faint]

874
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:17,502
Here you go.

875
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,537
- [troll growling]
- [Dante yells]

876
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:21,940
Come on!
Take that one! Take this one!

877
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:28,714
- [electricity arcing]
- How do you like that, fat boy?

878
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:33,351
What are you doing?

879
00:42:37,656 --> 00:42:41,860
Come on.
Let's just go.

880
00:42:43,629 --> 00:42:45,563
Selling the idea
of family values

881
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:48,433
is tough when the whole family
doesn't show for the event.

882
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:50,001
Dad, I'm so sorry.

883
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:52,003
- I mean, if I could--
- Stop.

884
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:55,073
No more foul-ups.
Now, this is a close race,

885
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:58,109
and the outcome
affects your future
as much as it does mine.

886
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:01,680
So I need you to step it up,
especially on that
half-time speech.

887
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:05,016
- Got it?
- Yeah.

888
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,152
Yeah, nice play there,
Carter, man.

889
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:10,455
[Players chattering]

890
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,562
- I'm out.
- What?

891
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,564
Lee's car was strike three.

892
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,132
- I leave in a week.
- Wait.

893
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,201
Okay, you can't quit.
We still have--

894
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,036
My mom is crying, Wyatt.

895
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,538
All right?
I'm not a hero.

896
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:29,574
[scoffs]
I'm a disaster.

897
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,576
Even when I try
to do what's right,

898
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,145
I still screw it up.

899
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:37,115
- Yeah, I'm out, too.
- Are you kidding me?

900
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:39,651
- Because I know
we can still do this.
- Do what?

901
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:41,953
Have our lives
completely ruined?

902
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:44,222
If that's what it takes.
Truth is,

903
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,192
in a couple days,
we might not even have lives
left to ruin.

904
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:50,461
Maldark's coming.

905
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:52,430
Oh, fine.

906
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,565
I just think
if we were in the game,
we wouldn't give up.

907
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,868
We'd put our heads together
and start acting like a clan--

908
00:43:56,902 --> 00:43:58,770
Man, but this isn't
the game, geek.

909
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:01,339
And there is no clan.

910
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,074
Don't you get it?

911
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:04,876
It's over.

912
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:10,581
Let someone else
figure it out.

913
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:23,361
- [electricity arcing]
- [thud]

914
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:28,466
[heavy breathing]

915
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:33,404
[gasping]

916
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:35,406
[growling]

917
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,942
Sprague?

918
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:41,146
[roars]

919
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,248
Don't touch me.

920
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:56,327
[creature growling]

921
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:03,234
What are you weirdoes
up to now?

922
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:09,775
[beeps]

923
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:12,978
Oh, my God.

924
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,012
[whip cracks]

925
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,580
Oh, my God.

926
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:23,021
Yo, there's a splotch-free
cupcake at the door for you.

927
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:26,657
- There's a who's-a-what's-it?
- A chiquita.

928
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:30,261
I know.
I'm as surprised as you are,
but if you don't jump on this,

929
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:33,131
I'm breaking out
my birthday money
and making it rain.

930
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:36,701
[stammers]

931
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:43,641
Tell me I'm hallucinating.
Tell me that I didn't just film
a bunch of...

932
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,410
I don't even know
what to call them.

933
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,112
Running off with that guy
from your report.

934
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:49,414
Because you know what?
That is exactly
what it looks like,

935
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:51,249
and it is really
freaking me out.

936
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:52,784
You're hallucinating.

937
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:55,987
I am not.
You're involved, aren't you?

938
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:57,688
I knew it.

939
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:01,292
- What's going on, Wyatt?
- [stammering]

940
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:03,594
- [imitates stammering]
- Oh-- Fine.

941
00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:06,031
Sprague and his Imperial Council
of level 75 Dread Orcs

942
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:08,834
just kidnapped Max Ross,
the creator
of Conqueror of All Worlds,

943
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:10,936
which means that Maldark's
not far behind.

944
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:13,704
Which is why
they probably need Max.

945
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:15,706
To open the final portal.

946
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,943
I'm gonna need
a nerd translation
for that, please.

947
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:19,577
Where were they headed?

948
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,913
Uh, uh, towards that giant
warehouse near my neighborhood.

949
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:25,516
- You know...
- The server farm on Dover Road.
Of course.

950
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,617
- Thanks for the tip.
- Uh-uh.

951
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:28,686
Ow! That's a pressure point.

952
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,622
- Don't even go there,
'cause I will own you.
- [cracking]

953
00:46:31,656 --> 00:46:33,724
- Ah.
- Who's Sprague? Who's Maldark?

954
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:35,626
And don't tell me
they're exchange students.

955
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,728
I'll explain on the way.

956
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:40,098
Forget the town, all right?
He can have it.

957
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,468
This ain't my home anymore.
At least according to my mom.

958
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:45,670
I can't do this without you.
You know that.

959
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:47,873
You can't do it with me either.

960
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:50,508
- That's a terrible attitude.
- Who brought the N.P.C.?

961
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,311
"N.P.C." What--
Is that, like, what, an insult?

962
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:54,812
Insulted.

963
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:58,149
Look, I did my part,
and it didn't work out.

964
00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:02,287
Just go.

965
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,522
You know, you're not
just a knight in the game.

966
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,324
I know I said that,

967
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:08,526
but everything you've done
since then has been selfless.

968
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,130
I mean, think about it.
You always put yourself
right in the face of danger.

969
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:15,033
You risked your own life
to save mine with the troll,
right?

970
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:17,335
You even sacrificed yourself
to save a guy you hate,

971
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:20,838
then took the fall for it
even though you knew
it was gonna happen.

972
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:23,241
You're not a screw-up, Dante.

973
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:25,977
You're a bona fide knight.

974
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:29,280
That being said,
if I get hit with
a Rectal Firecracker spell,

975
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:33,018
I take it all back.

976
00:47:33,051 --> 00:47:35,954
You had me
at "rectal firecracker."

977
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:37,956
All right. I want to see
11 guarded jerseys

978
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,225
on top of the ball carrier
on this kickoff.

979
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:42,827
I want you to knock
the tar out of those guys
and set the tone.

980
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,131
- Lyle.
- Show them what we're--

981
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:47,832
What the hell you doing in here?

982
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,535
Just wanna show the guys support
before the big game.

983
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:53,438
- Right, Dante?
- Yeah! Go, Spartans!

984
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,640
- It's Trojans.
- [Player] Yeah.

985
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,642
Get out. We any good?

986
00:47:57,675 --> 00:48:00,078
Uh, they're with me, Coach.

987
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:01,913
Uh, group project.

988
00:48:01,947 --> 00:48:05,616
All right. Listen up.
I want you hustling back...

989
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,018
What are you guys thinking?

990
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:09,187
Max has been kidnapped
by Sprague.

991
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,688
Maldark's about to come out.

992
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,991
Mass hysteria and mayhem
are imminent.

993
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:15,726
Too bad.
I told you guys, man, I'm done.

994
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,363
- I can't do this anymore.
- And we can?

995
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,299
Dude, this is much bigger
than us.

996
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:22,800
Like "end of the world" bigger.

997
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,235
Like "frogs are raining
from the sky" bigger,

998
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:26,137
except these frogs
are six feet tall, carry spears,

999
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:28,373
and eat human hearts
like candy, okay?

1000
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,840
[Coach]
Hugginson, hustle up!

1001
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:31,676
Look, I can't help you.

1002
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:34,179
How many times
do I have to say it?

1003
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:37,548
I'm done.

1004
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,519
You're not just a mage
in the game.

1005
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:44,222
I know.
And you probably think that...

1006
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:48,426
And it's the...

1007
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:50,561
- Rectal Firecracker?
- Forget it.

1008
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,797
[sighs]
I guess it's just the two of us.

1009
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:56,401
Wait. What?
Oh, no. I'm in.

1010
00:48:56,434 --> 00:49:00,571
Uh, hello.
You're one body short.
And I can handle myself.

1011
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:03,308
I've got three brothers
and a black belt in Krav Maga.
What?

1012
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:06,577
It's gonna take more
than Jewish karate to put a hurt
on these guys.

1013
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,780
Besides, you need a weapon
from the game if you wanna
come close to beating them.

1014
00:49:09,814 --> 00:49:11,182
I'm sorry.

1015
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:15,253
- Maybe, uh, if she wore this.
- Come on.

1016
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,622
Great idea. Why doesn't she
just slap them to death?

1017
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:21,059
- What? It might work.
- It's not gonna do it.
How's that thing ever--

1018
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:24,629
[Dante laughs]
That's hot.

1019
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:26,697
- That'll work.
- [clangs]

1020
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:29,967
- Aw! Damn!
- Sorry. Hah.

1021
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:39,077
[quiet whistles]

1022
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:46,451
[beeps]

1023
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,154
[Wyatt]
He's forcing Max to draw power
from the server farm

1024
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:51,456
and build a mega portal
for Maldark.

1025
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,293
Okay. Sneak in and rescue Max
before he can finish
building the portal.

1026
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:58,129
If Maldark gets out,
things are gonna get ugly.

1027
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:00,098
- Yeah.
- Let's do this.

1028
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:01,566
- [whistle blows]
- [Players] Break!

1029
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,201
[Players shouting]

1030
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:06,003
3, 7, hike!

1031
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:07,905
- [Players grunting]
- [crowd cheering]

1032
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:10,308
[both]
Tulta Munille!

1033
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,743
Battle cry? Really?

1034
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:15,246
[growling]

1035
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:19,984
Tall and ugly.

1036
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,519
- [yelling]
- [clangs]

1037
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:25,356
- Ow!
- Huh?

1038
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,258
[growling]

1039

1042
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:40,238
Ow!

1043

[yells]

1044
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:52,917
[laughs]
I killed it!

1045
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,985
[laughing]
Or something.

1046
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:56,887
Nice. Nice.

1047
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:59,357
- Let's move.
- All right.

1048

1049
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:10,401
Get your head in the game.

1050
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:13,104
Hey, don't sweat it.
You're a closer,
just like your dad.

1051
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:14,905
It's not that.

1052
00:51:14,939 --> 00:51:20,778
- It's nothing.
- [crowd cheering]

1053
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:23,481
Thank you all for coming out
and supporting the team.

1054
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:27,017
Being that the second half
looks like it's going to be
a nail-biter,

1055
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:29,287
I don't wanna keep my son
out here any longer
than necessary.

1056
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,590
But he did wanna say
a few things to you

1057
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:34,292
before he headed in.

1058
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:37,162
Lyle.

1059
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:39,864
- Yeah, I, uh...
- [microphone feedback]

1060
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:41,899
I just wanted
to let everyone know

1061
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,670
how much Daventry Hills
means to me and the family.

1062
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:48,105
- And, um...
- [whooshing]

1063
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:49,374
[electricity arcing]

1064
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:51,075
And that--

1065
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,444
that's why...

1066
00:51:53,478 --> 00:51:55,346
I gotta go.

1067
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,216
I mean, I'm sorry
about the fumbles
and the interception,

1068
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:01,051
but my head's just
not in it today, and...

1069
00:52:01,085 --> 00:52:02,387
You know what?

1070
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,589
Sometimes there's
more important things in life

1071
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,792
than just football
and popularity
and campaign speeches--

1072
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:09,894
Whoa. This isn't
a campaign speech, son.

1073
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:13,164
- That would be unfair.
- Like sticking by your friends,

1074
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:16,201
doing what's right,
and being true
to who you really are.

1075
00:52:16,234 --> 00:52:19,103
And that means me
telling all of you

1076
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,906
that I love geeking out
to video games.

1077
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:23,808
- [laughter]
- I always have.

1078
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:26,611
And even though it may not
help me get ahead in life

1079
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,180
or make me cool,
I'm proud of the fact

1080
00:52:29,214 --> 00:52:31,416
that I have
a level 68 Sorcerer

1081
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:33,751
in Conqueror of All Worls
named Wizza,

1082
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:37,522
who casts
some pretty awesome spells
out of his Thunder Pole.

1083

[quiet murmuring]

1085
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:46,697
Okay, I just said that.

1086
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:48,533
I should probably go.

1087
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:51,369
So...thanks,

1088
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:53,037
and vote for my dad.

Agh!

if you can get out.

Angie's in trouble.

Oh, no.

Oh, this is not good.

Oh, no! No!

Yeah.

What happened to your team?

1146

Man, this is my team.

Hey, where's Wyatt?

1148
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:40,531
Forget me.
Just save yourself.

1149
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:43,534
- I'm not leaving without you.
- I can't believe
I'm in a video game.

1150
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:46,537
I don't even play video games.

It's nice to have you back.

Hey, uh,
nice to have you back.

1157
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:14,431
Let's level up

- Max, shut it down!

1160
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:31,949
It's too late.
I'm sorry.

Ah.

1168
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,811
A welcoming party?

1169
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:02,880
Splendid!

1170
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:06,617
But I bear no gifts.

1171
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:10,755
Oh. Yes, I do!

- Are you nuts?

1174
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:29,473
It's due on Tuesday, okay?
No. Wait.

1175
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:37,014
You're real?

1176
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:38,182
Touch me not!

1177
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:40,384
But I created you.

1178
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:41,385
[mocking with gibberish]

1179
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:44,589
I allowed you to create me,

1180
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:46,591
and what a disappointment

1181
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:48,593
you've shown yourself to be.

1182
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:53,097
To think I was going to make you
my number one slave.

1183
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,966
Now you'll be lucky
if I grant you the honor

1184
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,068
of being
my number two footstool.

1185
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:00,638
Okay, you don't talk
to me like that, all right?

1186
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,640
You're out of the sequel.

1187
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:06,476
- Silence!
- [yelling]

1188
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:10,948
Ooh!

1189
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:13,317
If we can take down Maldark
and put him back in the game,

1190
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,085
will you be able
to rebuild the firewall?

1191
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,589
[scoffs]

1192
00:59:18,623 --> 00:59:21,926
[laughs]

1193
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:23,861
- Maybe.
- Make it happen.

1194
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:29,099
We need to trap him for good
before he builds a portal
for his army.

1195
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:32,803
- [Maldark laughing]
- Max, let us know
when the firewall's ready.

1196
00:59:32,837 --> 00:59:35,539
- [laughing continues]
- Tulta Munille.

1197
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,874
[Lyle, Dante]
Tulta Munille.

1198
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,609
Liza Minnelli.

1199
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:39,677
Whatever.

1200
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,912
No. We got this.

1201
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:45,215
Just-- Just make sure
to keep us in focus, all right?

1202
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,586
Okay. Careful.

1203
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:53,858
Now let's send
this psycho wizard
back to his game.

1204
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:56,894
On three, we throw everything
we got at him.

1205
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,963
One,

1206
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:02,466
two, three.

1207
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:03,934
- Kilauea!
- Wait!

1208
01:00:03,968 --> 01:00:05,736
Wait, wait, wait.

1209
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,838
- What?
- Back to the game. The game.

1210
01:00:07,872 --> 01:00:10,274
In the game,
we can only kill him
with the ultimate weapon.

1211
01:00:10,307 --> 01:00:12,643
- Max, how do we get it?
- I told you, no free hints.

1212
01:00:12,677 --> 01:00:14,311
- Max!
- Dude!

1213
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:17,848
Fine! But if you tell anyone,
I will sue you.

1214
01:00:17,882 --> 01:00:21,752
Every player
has a weapon in the game
when they first join the game--

1215
01:00:21,786 --> 01:00:24,855
the weapon
that becomes more powerful
as their character does.

1216
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:26,223
Thunder Pole.

1217
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:28,793
- Blast-a-ton.
- Skull Cracker.

1218
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:31,662
The clan needs to forge them
in the fire of a mighty sorcerer

1219
01:00:31,696 --> 01:00:33,664
to create
an all-powerful weapon.

1220
01:00:33,698 --> 01:00:36,366
Once they do, they get one shot
and one shot only

1221
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,902
to destroy Maldark.

1222
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:40,938
- And if we miss?
- [chuckles] Don't.

1223
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,539
Just a little side note, though.

1224
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:44,108
If you do succeed
in hitting him,

1225
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,744
the concussion of the blast
will most likely kill you.

1226
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:49,579
And when I say "most likely,"
I mean most definitely.

1227
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:51,281
- What?
- That's how the game ends.

1228
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,784
You become rogue martyrs.
It's poetic.

1229
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:56,486
No, that's not poetic.
That's dark and weird, okay?

1230
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,189
Guys, there must be,
like, another way.

1231
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:03,961
You don't have to do that,
right?

1232
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,399
[Maldark continues laughing]

1233
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:16,673
- [whispering
in foreign language]
- [whirring]

1234
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:32,189
It was fun playing
with you guys.

1235
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:34,291
Yeah.

1236
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:37,895
- NeverFail--
- [Lyle, Dante] NeverFail.

1237
01:01:37,928 --> 01:01:39,864
[yells]

1238
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:50,775
Epic, right?

1239
01:01:50,808 --> 01:01:53,043
You're welcome.

1240
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:55,379
How do we drive this thing?

1241
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:57,381
I don't think we do.

1242
01:01:57,414 --> 01:02:01,919
[motor starts]

1243
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:05,455
[mechanical hum]

1244
01:02:05,489 --> 01:02:07,825
[Maldark continues laughing]

1245
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:10,961
Yeah!

1246
01:02:10,995 --> 01:02:13,297
- [typing]
- Ready, Max?

1247
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,966
Just hold on a sec.
Almost there.

1248
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,902
That's the stuff.

1249
01:02:17,935 --> 01:02:20,337
[laughing]

1250
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,339
Subjugation

1251
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:25,075
is at hand!

1252
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:27,344
[laughing]

1253
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:29,546
- Uh, anytime now, Max.
- Not yet.

1254
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,049
- We can't wait!
- It's not ready!

1255
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,383
[Wyatt]
We have to fire now!

1256
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:37,087
- [grunts]
- [whirring]

1257
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:42,359
[laughing]

1258
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:49,033
**** [disco]

1259
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:51,535
What?

1260
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:57,507
- **** [continues]
- Yeah. I like that.

1261
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:09,286
**** [speeding up]

1262
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:12,022
Really?

1263
01:03:12,056 --> 01:03:14,524
Oh, no!

1264
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:16,760
- It's got him!
- Yeah!

1265
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,362
[singsong voice]
It's almost there.

1266
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:21,198
Noooo!

1267
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:26,837
[yelling]

1268
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:32,609
[all yelling]

1269
01:03:35,913 --> 01:03:39,316
[beeps]

1270
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:42,819
Guys? Come on, guys.

1271
01:03:42,853 --> 01:03:44,922
Guys, don't die.
Wyatt. Wyatt!

1272
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:48,792
Don't you die, Wyatt!
Don't you die!

1273
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,595
Ow!

1274
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:55,199
- Did you keep me in focus?
- [chuckling]

1275
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,666
[groaning]

1276
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,636
You did it.
You really did it.

1277
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,138
[groaning continues]

1278
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,107
You were supposed to die.

1279
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,642
You can't program people, Max.

1280
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,913
Yet.

1281
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:11,148
- Is he gone?
- [Max] He's gone.

1282
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,885
And the firewall's back up.

1283
01:04:14,919 --> 01:04:18,956
Epic win.

1284
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:23,227
[all laughing]

1285
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,930
Look, truth is,
your son was helping me

1286
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:27,932
with some motion capture work
on my latest project.

1287
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:30,800
I mean, in hindsight,
perhaps destroying someone's car

1288
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:33,103
without their permission--
not the brightest of ideas.

1289
01:04:33,137 --> 01:04:35,572
But once I explain everything
to the vice principal

1290
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:37,241
and show him a bunch
of shiny car catalogs,

1291
01:04:37,274 --> 01:04:39,243
I'm sure he'll be
a bit more understanding.

1292
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:41,678
You have to realize
your son is one of
the noblest knights--

1293
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,981
- Kids.
- Kids that I have ever seen.

1294
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:45,916
This town's lucky to have him
looking after it.

1295
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:48,518
- I mean, living here.
- I always felt he just needed

1296
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:52,622
to take ownership
of his skill sets
and channel his impulsivity.

1297
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:55,592
We all have
our coping mechanisms.

1298
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:59,163
Well, uh, if you promise
to stay out of trouble,

1299
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:00,830
and Mr. Ross can vouch for you,

1300
01:05:00,864 --> 01:05:02,632
you can go back to strike two.

1301
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:06,170
Right. Well, uh,
I should get going

1302
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:09,073
before the NSA triangulates
my position.

1303
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:12,509
Uh, I would hug you all,
but you know where
I stand on that.

1304
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:15,512
So, uh, memory card,
little lady.

1305
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:16,947
- What?
- Yeah.

1306
01:05:16,981 --> 01:05:18,448
No. No, no, no. No, no.

1307
01:05:18,482 --> 01:05:20,350
I risked my life for this.

1308
01:05:20,384 --> 01:05:22,119
Okay, I got trapped
in a video game.

1309
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:26,023
That stuff gets out,
and you know whose lives
get ruined, right?

1310
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:27,557
[Wyatt, Lyle]
It's rhetorical.

1311
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:30,660
Thank you, guys.

1312
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:32,696
Is the Quiz Bowl team
still available?

1313
01:05:32,729 --> 01:05:35,399
Yeah.
If they let me back on.

1314
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,570
Mm...

1315
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:42,206
**** [rap]

1316
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:43,573
** I hear the what *

1317
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:44,774
** Talkin' like a rap star

1318
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:46,110
** Drivin' in a fast car

1319
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:47,577
Look at that.

1320
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:49,179
- Oh, my...
- What?

1321
01:05:49,213 --> 01:05:50,480
** Take a little heat *

1322
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:54,618
[Woman chuckling]

1323
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:56,686
Think we'll ever
play the game again?

1324
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,457
You know, after living it?

1325
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:02,392
- Absolutely.
- I'm in.

1326
01:06:02,426 --> 01:06:05,495
Well, Tulta Munille, boys.

1327
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:07,031
Tulta Munille.

1328
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:08,332
Wow.
[chuckles]

1329
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:12,769
So, uh, uh, text me
about something sometime.

1330
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,038
O-Okay.

1331
01:06:14,071 --> 01:06:15,839
- Oooh!
- Oooh!

1332
01:06:15,872 --> 01:06:18,075
What is going on over there?

1333
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:21,578
So you guys wanna
go grab a bite at Deckard's?

1334
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:24,348
You mean, like,
all of us together?

1335
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:25,949
Might ruin your rep.

1336
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,385
My rep's already ruined, guys.

1337
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:30,254
Welcome to my life.

1338
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:33,090
- Come on.
- Shotgun!

1339
01:06:33,123 --> 01:06:36,060
Things have returned to normal
here in Daventry Hills

1340
01:06:36,093 --> 01:06:38,928
as the strange disturbances
of the past few weeks

1341
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:41,565
have subsided
almost as quickly

1342
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:43,767
and mysteriously
as they arrived.

1343
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:47,003
Local authorities continue
to deny any correlation

1344
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:49,706
between the recent blackout
and the odd events.

1345
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,608
The cause of
the unexplained phenomena

1346
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:54,311
that wracked this town
remains just that--
unexplained.

1347
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,780
Reporting from a peaceful
Main Street,

1348
01:06:56,813 --> 01:06:58,482
I'm Tex Thatcher.

1349
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,751
[sinister laughter]

1350
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:06,990
