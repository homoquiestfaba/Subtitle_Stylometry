NARRATOR: <i>Long, long ago,</i>
<i>in the Land Before Time,</i>

5
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,694
<i>great beasts ruled</i>
<i>the world.</i>

6
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:57,597
<i>These mighty beasts</i>
<i>were the dinosaurs.</i>

7
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,871
<i>Yes, it was</i>
<i>a place of wonder,</i>

8
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,314
<i>but also filled</i>
<i>with danger...</i>

9
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:10,373
(ROARS)

10
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:12,449
<i>...where survival</i>
<i>was uncertain</i>

11
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:16,151
<i>and families were sometimes</i>
<i>torn apart.</i>

12
00:01:22,662 --> 00:01:23,651
(CROAKS)

13
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,365
<i>Which is how the young</i>
<i>Longneck named Littlefoot</i>

14
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:34,602
<i>came to live with</i>
<i>his grandmother,</i>
<i>grandfather,</i>

15
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:37,676
<i>and his close friends</i>

16
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:40,838
<i>in the beautiful</i>
<i>Great Valley.</i>

17
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:54,224
<i>The perils of the world had</i>
<i>claimed his mother and</i>
<i>separated him from his father.</i>

18
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:59,955
<i>Then,</i>
<i>a miraculous day came.</i>

19
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,459
<i>Littlefoot and his father,</i>
<i>Bron, were reunited.</i>

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,138
<i>During the time</i>
<i>they were apart,</i>

21
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,509
<i>Bron had become</i>
<i>the leader of a large</i>
<i>migrating herd.</i>

22
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:17,876
<i>This meant he couldn't</i>
<i>stay with Littlefoot in</i>
<i>the Great Valley.</i>

23
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:22,321
<i>Bron wanted his son</i>
<i>to join him,</i>

24
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:25,622
<i>and Littlefoot wanted</i>
<i>to be with his father,</i>

25
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,392
<i>but he also didn't want</i>
<i>to leave his home.</i>

26
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:37,267
<i>So Littlefoot made the</i>
<i>tough decision to stay</i>
<i>with his grandfather,</i>

27
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,634
<i>grandmother</i>
<i>and friends.</i>

28
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:46,302
<i>Now each year,</i>

29
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,906
<i>when the Season of New Growth</i>
<i>follows the Cold Time,</i>

30
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:53,349
<i>and the warm sunshine</i>
<i>falls softly</i>
<i>on the Great Valley,</i>

31
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:58,416
<i>Littlefoot looks forward</i>
<i>to a visit from his father,</i>

32
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:02,718
<i>leading the great herd</i>
<i>on their yearly migration.</i>

33
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:10,130
<i>It's a reunion he dreams</i>
<i>about all year long.</i>

34
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:20,371
<i>And it will be</i>
<i>happening today.</i>

00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:38,203
Bron.

179
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:41,209
Oh, yes, yes,
that's him!

180
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,713
Bron!

181
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:44,945
What a brave Longneck
he was.

182
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:46,007
Ooh.

183

Uh, is!

00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:52,424
'Cause he's still is...
He still is... I'm sure.

185
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:54,320
What happened
to him?

186
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:57,862
I don't know.
I lost sight of him
at the Fire Mountain.

187
00:11:58,164 --> 00:11:59,597
He's in trouble?

188
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:02,293
Grandpa, we have
to help him.

189
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:04,129
Littlefoot...

190
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:06,962
Will you take us
back there?

191
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,371
You know the way.

192
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:12,769
So, you want me
to take you

193
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,005
across the earthbreak,

194
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,605

196
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:21,809
back to the same
Fire Mountain that I just
escaped from?

197
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:25,657
How foolish
do you think I look?

198
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:32,792
Let me put it
another way.

199
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:35,163
The answer is no!

200
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:39,994
Please. That's my dad.
He needs our help.

201
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:43,634
He's right, Littlefoot.
We can't do it.

202
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:45,601
But...

203
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:47,611
You'll go, won't you?

204
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:59,749
I'm sorry, Littlefoot.
It's too dangerous now.

205
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:04,029
We must wait for the mountain
to stop spitting rocks.

206
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,596
Bron wouldn't want us
to get hurt.

207
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,163
But my dad needs us now!

208
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:13,363
Your father is very
strong and wise.

209
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:15,669
He's lived through
many earthshakes.

210
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:19,377
I'm sure he's on his way
here right now.

211

219
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:01,414
I think he's in trouble.
He needs me.

220
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:03,185
What can you do?

221
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:05,486
I'm going
to the Fire Mountain.

222
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:07,890

I'm going.

He wouldn't leave
anyone behind.

Even though it meant
risking his life.

MR. THREEHORN: Cera!

1246
01:16:21,423 --> 01:16:22,412
Dad!

(GIGGLING)

1248
01:16:27,029 --> 01:16:28,929
Thank goodness.

(MOANING HAPPILY)

1250
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:40,800
What are you doing
way out here?

1251
01:16:41,443 --> 01:16:42,876
We came to save you.

1252
01:16:43,579 --> 01:16:46,605
Oh, we thank you
but no need saving.

1253
01:16:47,149 --> 01:16:49,276
This time we do saving.

1254
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:51,509
ETTA: Wild Arms!

1255
01:16:51,954 --> 01:16:53,854
What are you doing
back here?

1256
01:16:54,757 --> 01:16:57,225
Well, Etta, I volunteered
to lead the rescue.

1257
01:16:57,426 --> 01:16:58,893
That's what
I'm doing here.

1258
01:16:59,295 --> 01:17:00,319
(CHUCKLES)

1259
01:17:01,297 --> 01:17:03,390
You volunteered?

1260
01:17:03,465 --> 01:17:04,523
Really?

1261
01:17:06,235 --> 01:17:09,033
Well, uh...
(CHUCKLES) Yeah?

1262
01:17:11,874 --> 01:17:13,364
(LAUGHING)

1263
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:15,943
Grandpa!

1264
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:21,472
I see you
found your father.

1265
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:23,175
He did.

1266
01:17:23,852 --> 01:17:25,251
We all did.

1267
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:27,083
(ALL AGREEING)

1268
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:30,154
You've got quite
a group of friends.

1269
01:17:31,226 --> 01:17:33,717
You remind me
of someone I know.

1270
01:17:38,334 --> 01:17:40,234
Come, everyone.

1271
01:17:40,402 --> 01:17:42,768
Let's all go home.

1272
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:47,137
Finally someone
who's sensible!

1273
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:48,539
Let's get
out of here.

1277

1278
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:13,531
<i>The realization that</i>
