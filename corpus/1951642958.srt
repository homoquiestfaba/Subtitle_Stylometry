1
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,705
...striking farmworker
Cesar Chavez

2
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,976
shows strong signs
of deterioration

3
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,812
since his fast began...

4
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,675
- Walkout!
- Walkout!

5
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,568
- Bobby!
- Yes!

6
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,039
- Gettysburg.
- Uh...

7
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,338
I don't know. A whole mess
of people got killed.

8
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,968
Scratch a little
deeper, Bobby.

9
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,844
- Who fought there?
- Americans!

10
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,679
Americans?
How about your ancestors?

11
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,446
- Mexicanos?
- Yeah!

12
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,353
Yoli, help him out. Read the part
on the Chicano regiments.

13
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,721
- Chicanos?
- Old Mexican-Americans.

14
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,885
It was before we
moved to East L.A.

15
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,987
and became vatos locos!

16
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,657
Any luck, Yoli?

17
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,963
Read the part
about Mariano Vallejo

18
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,902
and his meeting
with Abraham Lincoln. That's it.

19
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,041
Paula, help her out. Read the part
of 9,000 Mexican-Americans

20
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,839
who fought in
the American Civil War.

21
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:30,174
Mr. Castro, it doesn't say
anything about Mexican-Americans.

22
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,851
Let me see.

23
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,387
See, that's funny.
We were there.

24
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,152
What side
did we fight on?

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,824
Both.

26
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,921
Ooh, and we still lost?

27
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,797
Yeah, we still lost.
You know what we lost?

28
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,831
We lost our legacy.

29
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:55,204
Why? 'Cause we're
not in this book.

30
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,941
See, if people
don't know about it,

31
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,344
then it never happened.

32
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,583
See, you're learning
your history

33
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,744
from people that don't
know your history.

34
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,754
Your blood...

35
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,688
is in Gettysburg.

36
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:13,317
What about Vietnam?

37
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,157
Your blood is
in Vietnam too.

38
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,229
Okay, have a good day.

39
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,873
Fernie, I want
to talk to you.

40
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,904
Hey.

41
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,912
Your mother signed
your permission slip.

42
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,881
I look forward to having you.

43
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:39,214
- I need your permission slip too.
- I'm really working on it.

44
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,724
I can't hold it, Paula.
What do we do? What do we do?

45
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,594
Let's try
the faculty restroom.

46
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,672
Excuse me!
What are you doing?

47
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,038
Mr. Hurley,
I really have to go.

48
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,771
No students allowed in the
building at lunch. You know that.

49
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,245
- Mr. Hurley, the other bathrooms--
- I don't make the rules.

50
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,838
Go on!

51
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,151
- Hey, Yoli, you wanna see the fight?
- Not right now, Bobby.

52
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,860
- Watch out.
- Okay okay.

53
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,430
Break it up!
I said break it up!

54
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,668
Break it up, break it up!

55
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,369
Get over here.
Yeah yeah yeah.

56
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,968
Hey, we're not
done here, puto!

57
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,037
Drop it, Fernie.
Drop it, Fernie.

58
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,378
Drop it. Okay, everybody
go back to class.

59
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,084
Come on, stop!

60
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,645
Come on,
before Ingles sees us.

61
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,453
- The principal's a pendejo.
- Ey!

62
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,489
Look, don't give
that pendejo

63
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,587
any more reasons
to kick you out of school.

64
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,031
No one talks like that
about my mother, man.

65
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,400
You're worried about
your mother? Graduate.

66
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,703
- Everybody go back to class.
- Hey, Paula.

67
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,734
See you at the meeting room.
Be there or be square.

68
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,770
I'll see you there, Ray.

69
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,873
Guess we'd better
get back inside now.

70
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,850
No no no, I'll catch up
with you later.

71
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,285
All right.

72
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,789
Come on!

73
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,826
Please, Papi!
It's not a camping trip.

74
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,028
I'm not sending you to the beach
with a bunch of wild boys. I told you!

75
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,936
It's Malibu! It's a student
leadership conference, Papi!

76
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,632
You have nothing
to worry about.

77
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,573
They're all geeks,
like Paula.

78
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,439
You think anyone
who can spell is a geek.

79
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,502
- J-E-K.
- G-E-E-K.

80
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,808
That was my point, see?

81
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,816
It's a chance to be around
intelligent kids for a change.

82
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,717
Panfilo, it's an honor
to be chosen.

83
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,881
- She brings pride to the family.
- Dad--

84
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,381
I already finished my homework,
I got the weekend off from the theater,

85
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,293
- and it doesn't cost anything!
- Jeff!

86
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,797
- Yeah, Papi?
- When's your test?

87
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,823
Monday.

88
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,030
You stay home and help
your brother study.

89
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,061
He's not so smart
like you.

90
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,617
I'm not going to help him.
No one ever helped me with my homework.

91
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,523
Here.

92
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,784
You have permission.

93
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,624
He signed it?!

94
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,290
I signed it.

95
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,562
It only asks
for one signature.

96
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,468
You should be
very pleased, Paula.

97
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,029
President of the ticketeers,
prom committee,

98
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,564
you've make quite
a contribution here.

99
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,600
Not to mention
your test scores.

100
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,703
Now here are
your financial aid forms.

101
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,839
Have you applied
to any other colleges?

102
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,713
No, not yet.

103
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,718
- Hey, Paula.
- Hey, Paula.

104
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,242
Hey, how'd it go?

105
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,552
Mr. Peck told me,
"You have a big future ahead of you."

106
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,387
- That's good!
- Yeah.

107
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,623
- In the art world.
- Industrial arts.

108
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,392
Nice way to say
"car mechanic."

109
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,300
He told me secretary.
There's no nice way to say that.

110
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,565
Didn't he offer
junior college?

111
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,300
Yeah, to improve
my typing skills.

112
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,332
Anyway. So what
did he say to you?

113
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,835
He just gave me some pamphlets
and financial aid stuff.

114
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,611
Out of all of us, you should
definitely be the one going to college.

115
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,380
Why only me?

116
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,785
- 'Cause you're smart.
- So are you.

117
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,849
- Yeah, not in the same way.
- Bobby Verdugo? Give me a break, Sal.

118
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,725
- He also happens to be a smart ass.
- We can get him into UCLA.

119
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,253
- He's got 2.8.
- But he's got the test scores.

120
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,358
Get real, Sal. We've got to concentrate
our resources on the talented ones.

121
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,302
You don't have to go
to college to be successful.

122
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,703
No, you don't, but they have
to know what's available to them.

123
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,297
They could be doctors, lawyers.

124
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,707
There's other roles for them
to play in society, Sal.

125
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,711
Lloyd, I think you'd
better stay out of this.

126
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,610
How much money
do you make?

127
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,548
- As much as you do.
- Which is bupkis.

128
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:08,020
And Jorge Ramirez who graduated
this high school owns his own tire shop.

129
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,887
No college education,
he makes 10 times our salary.

130
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,290
You know what? I bet he's got
10 of our dropouts sweeping his floors.

131
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,591
- Sal, you know I do whatever I can.
- Good.

132
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,223
Don't give up on Bobby.
Steer him into college.

133
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,665
Is that what he wants, Sal,
or is that what you want?

134
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,465
You know something, Hurley?
Whoever gave you a break,

135
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,563
I bet you they
regret it right now.

136
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,801
I'm just asking
a question.

137
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,709
"I seemed swinging in a mighty
rhythm through orbit vastness.

138
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,805
Sparkling points of light
spluttered and shot past me."

139
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,874
- Fernie.
- "They were stars,

140
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,409
I knew,
and flaring comets

141
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,252
that peopled my flight
among the suns."

142
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,087
Jesus.

143
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,392
"As I reached
the limit of my swing

144
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,954
and prepared to rush back
on the counter swing,

145
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,991
a great... gong struck

146
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,900
and thundered."

147
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:05,972
- "For an immeasurable--"
- Bobby, Jesus, front and center.

148
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,644
- What'd I do?
- You spoke Spanish. You know the rules.

149
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,917
Mr. Verdugo,
you're first.

150
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,307
Let's go.
Assume the position.

151
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,550
Quiet!

152
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,340
Excuse me.

153
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,805
Glad you could join us.

154
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,281
Since you're here,
is there any action

155
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,946
on the entertainment
for the prom?

156
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,422
We're still trying to find
a band. Personally,

157
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,449
- I like The Midnighters.
- Can we afford them?

158
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,961
Well, we could still
do some fundraising

159
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,965
and pull about $100
from the decorating committee.

160
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,263
Look at what we're
spending on balloons.

161
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,496
Balloons contribute
to the festive atmosphere.

162
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,527
Find a cheaper band.

163
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,733
If there isn't anything--

164
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,903
We have to get the school to
open the restrooms at lunch.

165
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,839
We've already discussed that
and proposed it.

166
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,044
They say we don't
respect it.

167
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,383
They're bathrooms, Ray,
not churches.

168
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,989
Not happening.

169
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,618
Let's focus on things
under our control.

170
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,291
Be careful, mija.

171
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,698
Bye, Mami!

172
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,934
- Do you guys ever stop kissing?
- Do we ever?

173
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:17,238
No, never.

174
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,744
- See? Look how she loves me.
- Check this out, Paula.

175
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,748
- Isn't that cute?
- It's my love drawing I made for him.

176
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,791
Hey, come on, Chato,
don't do me like this, ese!

177
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,426
Mr. Castro said all I gotta
do is deliver you here

178
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,231
and I don't have
to do a book report.

179
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,864
I see how you putos are!

180
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,067
Pimping out
your own homeboy!

181
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,474
What the fuck
are you looking at?

182
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,676
- You're coming with us?
- Fuck no.

183
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,952
- Nice, huh?
- That house right there, honey.

184
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,095
Right there.

185
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,327
Check out these houses.
They're all Beaver Cleaver.

186
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,730
Wow. What do
these people do?

187
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,762
Lawyers, doctors,

188
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,104
businessmen.

189
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,508
College-educated people.

190
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,104
- Hey, Mr. Castro?
- Yeah?

191
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,241
- You went to college, right?
- Yeah.

192
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,342
How come you ain't
living out here?

193
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,528
- Far out.
- That's beautiful.

194
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,394
Whoa.

195
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,831
Wow.

196
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,167
- You ever been to the beach?
- Of course.

197
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,071
Once.

198
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:08,014
And another rule:
Don't pick up any moving sticks.

199
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,454
- Those are snakes.
- Well, mine wasn't moving.

200
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,424
And you're not supposed
to pick those up either.

201
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,086
Why, are they dangerous?

202
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,357
They like
to think they are.

203
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,956
Hi. Here,
let me help you.

204
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,092
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,797
Uh, excuse me. Thank you
so much for your help.

206
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,603
Paula, you can get
your bag. No boys allowed.

207
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,236
Come on. Ladies,
get your bags and thank the guys

208
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,246
for their genuine
kindness.

209
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,618
Does anybody
know why they're here?

210
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,213
Hey, does anybody know
why they're here?

211
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,883
To meet girls!

212
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,257
- To meet boys.
- Yeah!

213
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,489
All right, all right.

214
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,429
I'll tell you
why you're here.

215
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,989
Because an administrator,
or a teacher,

216
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,525
or somebody who understands
the Chicano struggle

217
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,504
saw something in you.
Maybe you're smart.

218
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,336
Maybe you're good at sports.
Maybe you're good with people.

219
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,842
Maybe you're just
a chingon vato loco.

220
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,607
Ah, Bobby Verdugo.

221
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,707
Cholo king!

222
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:18,985
One out of four
Mexican-Americans

223
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,356
graduate high school.

224
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,987
You guys are almost
over that hurdle.

225
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,589
The next hurdle is
getting you into college

226
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,793
and getting a degree.

227
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,994
"Time" magazine,
you guys see it?

228
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,972
It's America's Bible,
and we made it!

229
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,770
Whoo!

230
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,982
Let me read it to you.
It's called "Pocho's Progress."

231
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,043
- What? Pocho?
- Who are the Pochos, by the way?

232
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,251
- Who's Pocho?
- "Nowhere is Pocho's plight

233
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,749
more evident than in the monotonous
sun-scabbed flatlands

234
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,819
of East Los Angeles."

235
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,127
What are they talking about?
We got hills in East L.A.

236
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,292
I know, I know.

237
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,235
"In tawdry taco joints

238
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:09,367
and rollicking cantinas,
the reek of cheap sweet wine

239
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,935
competes with the fumes
of frying tortillas."

240
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,276
- This is how they see you.
- That's bullshit, man.

241
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,340
Yeah.

242
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,579
So if our schools
are inferior,

243
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,644
and the police beat us up,
so what, right?

244
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,451
We deserve it, right?
We're cheap,

245
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,357
- tawdry and poor-- no?
- No! No!

246
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,920
- No.
- 2%

247
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,988
of Chicanos make it
into college.

248
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,626
2%, we've got
to change that.

249
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,193
Until we get educated,

250
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,001
somebody else will be
writing our history.

251
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,838
- I want us to write it.
- That's right, yeah!

252
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,935
- Let's write it.
- Yeah!

253
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,845
Huh? I want us
to make our own history!

254
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,542
The great American Chicano!

255
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,494
Remember! Remember that freedom
is in education and knowledge.

256
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,086
- Got it.
- Thank you.

257
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,790
U.M.A.S.

258
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,799
Hi, welcome
to Occidental.

259
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,767
- Strong liberal arts--
- Thank you.

260
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,430
I'm gonna have so much
to fill out tonight.

261
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,463
- Got it, got it. I am hungry, girls.
- Hi, Mr. Castro.

262
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,907
- UCLA.
- I see L.A., we saw L.A.

263
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,435
- What's with the berets?
- Like the Black Panthers, only brown.

264
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,916
- That's original.
- Ladies, sign up right here.

265
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,510
- What do you guys do?
- We're a community action group

266
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,282
improving conditions
in the barrio:

267
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,482
cleaning up parks,
registering people to vote--

268
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,684
Don't forget about
protesting police brutality.

269
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,194
- Yeah?
- That's right. I'm David Sanchez,

270
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,695
- Carlos Montes.
- Hi.

271
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,721
- Armando Lopez.
- Oh--

272
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,825
- How are you doing?
- How are you guys? Nice to meet you.

273
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,304
Here, this'll give you an idea
of what's really going on.

274
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,999
Thanks for your
contribution.

275
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,440
We want people who've got
the guts to change things.

276
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,774
- You think you've got the guts?
- Hey, girls?

277
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,712
You want to change
something, go to college.

278
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,808
- You're Al's sister, right?
- Yeah.

279
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,910
- Paula.
- Moctesuma Esparza.

280
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,921
I went to Lincoln
with him.

281
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,513
You passed by my booth.

282
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,024
And... where are you
going to college?

283
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,050
Oh, um,
I don't know yet.

284
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:13,463
There's 40 Chicanos in UCLA--
at a school of 30,000

285
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:17,265
not counting the gardeners. We need
all the beautiful Chicanas we can get.

286
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,804
No, I mean I don't know
if I'm going to go to college.

287
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,104
Yes, you are.
You're a leader.

288
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,044
That's why you're here.
Please, fill these out.

289
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,242
We'll even pay
the application fee. Uh, Vickie!

290
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,080
Vickie will help you with
any questions you have, okay?

291
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,915
- Hey, you guys.
- Thank you, Monte.

292
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,750
It's Mocte.

293
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,451
Hey, here's my number.
Call me.

294
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,051
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

295
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,687
- See you.
- See you later, girls.

296
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,426
Hey, Yoli.
Take that.

297
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,731
"Chicanas," I like that.

298
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,261
Chicano, Chicana,
how does that make you feel?

299
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,968
You all should really be going.
You've got to get a degree.

300
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,910
Good grades will help
if you don't have the money.

301
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,896
Chicano!

302
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,203
This is a poem
by Corky Gonzales.

303
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,506
"I am Joaquin,

304
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:37,345
Lost in a world
of confusion,

305
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,818
Caught in the whirl
of gringo society,

306
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,481
Confused by the rules,

307
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,184
Scorned by the attitudes...

308
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,750
I've come a long way
to nowhere...

309
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:55,656
I am Cuauhtemoc...
King of an empire,

310
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,692
civilized...

311
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,728
far beyond the dreams
of the Gachupin Cortez...

312
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,570
I am the Maya Prince...

313
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,544
Great leader
of the Chichimecas...

314
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,346
I rode
with Pancho Villa.

315
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,920
Hidalgo! Zapata!
Murietta! Espinoza!

316
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:21,289
are but a few... who dared
to face The force

317
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,428
of the tyranny of men

318
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,023
who rule by farce
and hypocrisy.

319
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,059
I stand here
looking back,

320
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,207
and now I see
the present.

321
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:41,639
In a country that's
wiped out all my history...

322
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,708
and stifled my pride.

323
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,279
I shed a tear
of anguish

324
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:56,658
when I see my children
disappear in the shroud

325
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,459
of mediocrity,

326
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,126
never to look back...

327
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,466
and remember me.

328
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,775
And now the trumpets sound,

329
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,142
The music in the people
stirs a Revolution,

330
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,411
Like a sleeping giant,
slowly rearing its head...

331
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,686
And we start to move.
La Raza!

332
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:28,159
Mexicanos! Espanoles! Chicanos!
Latinos! whatever I call myself,

333
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,661
I look the same

334
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,130
I feel the same

335
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,895
I cry and sing the same...

336
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:41,070
I am Joaquin...
My blood is pure.

337
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:45,799
I am Aztec prince...
I am Christian Christ.

338
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,540
I shall endure!"

339
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,873
Yeah, I know one thing--

340
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,474
I ain't
no Joaquin.

341
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,849
- Who's Joaquin?
- The guy from the poem.

342
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,945
"Lost in a world
of confusion,

343
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,422
Caught in a whirl
of a gringo society."

344
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,153
Hey, that's Bobby!

345
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,823
You're Chicano, Bobby.
You can't wash that shit out.

346
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,697
You're an Aztec.
Mexica.

347
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,430
Man, I ain't no Aztec.
I'm a Dodger's fan.

348
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,233
"Lost in a world
of confusion."

349
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:24,106
And you're the son of your father.
Your father's a Chicano.

350
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,734
My father's
a Teamster, man.

351
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,572
Naw, man,
he's from Bakersfield.

352
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,445
He's Mexican-American.

353
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,247
No, you're either Mexican
or you're American, you can't be both.

354
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,186
- You're one or the other.
- That's not true.

355
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,621
But Irish-Americans
don't have to chose.

356
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,625
I'm not
a Mexican-American.

357
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:44,288
I'm a Chicana.
Born and raised in the U.S.A.

358
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:50,158
- We can all agree on that one, right?
- Yeah.

359
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,139
You know, one day I want
to be the first great Chicano surfer.

360
00:22:56,174 --> 00:23:00,133
- What's stopping you?
- I can't swim.

361
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,750
Okay, what was your
favorite part, Paula?

362
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,913
Oh, the best part was
definitely dancing around the fire.

363
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,550
Oh, you two were so funny.
Bobby was such a dork.

364
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,322
I've never seen you
move like that, man.

365
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,194
You get red ants on your feet,
of course you move like that.

366
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,664
This is what's great though.
You've got a bunch of kids,

367
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,364
some of the brightest kids,
right, that want to change

368
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,737
as much as you guys,
that's what's great about it.

369
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,366
I didn't know there were
that many people--

370
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,570
There's a lot more!

371
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:38,313
- Where are we?
- It's a high school. Who needs to go?

372
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,614
I'm going.

373
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,886
Okay, this is the senior court.
You see the stairwell?

374
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,119
- Yeah.
- Okay, there's a water fountain.

375
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,492
Behind the water fountain,
there's a bathroom.

376
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,463
Okay?
Fernie, come with me.

377
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:40,277
- There you are.
- I'm sorry! I was gonna come down--

378
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,973
No no no.
What are you looking at?

379
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:45,346
Oh, look at this.
There's so much to learn

380
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:48,682
we don't find out about.

381
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,087
Our library is sad.
I mean, look--

382
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,422
they have books
in Hebrew.

383
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,122
They have French,
German.

384
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,961
They even
have Spanish.

385
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,626
Look at this, look.

386
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,233
We can't even speak Spanish
in our schools.

387
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,740
I know.

388
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,672
It's not right. I mean, don't people
realize how we're being treated?

389
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,082
Hmm... you should write
an article about it.

390
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,512
What, "A Tale
of Two Schools"?

391
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,851
That's a good title.

392
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,775
Hi, Papi.

393
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,612
Mando Ramos?

394
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,189
I love Mando.
Look at him dance.

395
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:06,389
He's running away.

396
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,524
Come on.
He's amazing.

397
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,627
He used to be.
Now he don't work for it.

398
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,696
Thinks he knows
everything.

399
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,765
He still wins
on points.

400
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:21,142
He takes
too many chances.

401
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,044
Guys who take chances...

402
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,912
vas a ver.

403
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,385
Bang!

404
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,980
Get their heads
taken off.

405
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,490
You should have
seen it, Papi.

406
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,356
All we did was drive
across the city

407
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,384
and it was like we were
in a whole new world.

408
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,296
There were kids from all over,
smart kids, Papi.

409
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,732
We heard speeches
and there was a poem,

410
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,735
and we learned all about
our culture.

411
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,101
What culture?

412
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,663
The Chicano culture.

413
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,938
You're not a Chicana.

414
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,104
Of course I am.

415
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,773
I am from
the Philippines.

416
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,579
You're a Chilipina.

417
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,720
Chilipina.

418
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:21,600
"A Tale of Two Schools.

419
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,507
You're afraid of us,
your own children,

420
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,204
scared that we're gonna
shake things up,

421
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,543
change what
you're holding on to.

422
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,017
But we're beginning to see
what's going on and we don't like it.

423
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:37,886
We're opening our eyes
and finding our own voices."

424
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,913
"It's not about
swimming pools

425
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,983
and fancy auditoriums.

426
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,120
The Palisades High library

427
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,563
has books in languages
from all over the world.

428
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,227
They honor the cultures
of their students.

429
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:55,464
In East L.A., the Chicanos aren't
even allowed to speak Spanish.

430
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,975
The Declaration
of Independence

431
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,341
tells us that we are
created equal,

432
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:04,246
but our schools teach us
that we are not."

433
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,654
Dang, girl,
you can write!

434
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,589
I know.

435
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,787
Risco at "La Raza"
will love this.

436
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,387
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

437
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,564
This is La Piranya.

438
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,002
That's right, girl. We built
this place ourselves.

439
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,767
There's so many
people in there.

440
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,537
Don't worry. You met a lot
of them up at Malibu.

441
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,305
Yeah.

442
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,904
Chicana,
Chicano headquarter.

443
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,915
Come on.

444
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,410
Paula, Vickie, hi!
Thanks for coming.

445
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,751
- I think you know everyone here.
- Hey, Robert.

446
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,086
- Hey, Paula.
- Hey, Mocte, Tanya.

447
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:49,116
- Hi.
- Oh-- Tanya.

448
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,787
Tanya Mount.
Roosevelt?

449
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,821
- Hey girl.
- Um, wait, what was your name again?

450
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,732
John Ortiz.
I'm with Garfield.

451
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,168
- Garfield.
- Just like Mita, Mita goes to Garfield.

452
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,899
Yeah, Mita Cuaron.
Hi, Paula.

453
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,407
- Um, and Mickey?
- Mickey Fernandez.

454
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:06,433
- Beverly Hills High School.
- He wishes.

455
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,606
- And Harry, right?
- Harry Gamboa.

456
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,810
Wow, so we have all five East L.A.
high schools here in one place.

457
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:16,343
- That could be dangerous.
- Did you guys all read Paula's article?

458
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,685
I read it.
I really liked it, Paula.

459
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,623
- It was really good.
- Great article.

460
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,455
- Impressive.
- East L.A. schools

461
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,190
are more jacked up
than Westside schools.

462
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,765
- That ain't news.
- It is news, Harry. A student wrote it.

463
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,770
The principal should
read the article, actually.

464
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,965
We should get all
our principals to read that.

465
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,974
Principals know
the school's jacked up,

466
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:40,341
but that's just one student complaining.
It's not going to do anything.

467
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,279
One student might not
change anything,

468
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,578
- but a whole bunch will.
- So what do we do?

469
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,142
How about we get every
high school student to write

470
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,245
an essay about what they
think about schools?

471
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,155
They're not going to write an essay.
They don't even do homework.

472
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:56,285
This is East L.A. You know what I mean?
Not everybody can write.

473
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,318
We can make it simple.

474
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,764
We can ask the questions ourselves--
come up with a list of questions,

475
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,098
and then kids can answer
them about their schools.

476
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,500
- Like a survey.
- Oh yeah!

477
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,267
Surveys are bullshit.

478
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,366
- Have you got a better idea?
- You want to get people's attention,

479
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,344
get their attention. The Black Panthers
don't take no surveys.

480
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,904
- We're not the Black Panthers, ese.
- Black Panthers?

481
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,382
We're talking about
improving the schools, Carlos.

482
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,681
We're talking about getting
people's attention, que no?

483
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,744
Que si. That's why we're
gonna do it our own way.

484
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:27,224
- Nonviolently.
- Hey, Vickie, I'm just going to go.

485
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,920
You just got here. Come on,
we're just getting into it.

486
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,429
I have to get home.
I didn't realize what time it is.

487
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,795
- You guys don't know my dad.
- Can I give you a ride?

488
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,325
- You have a car?
- Yeah, I have a car. Come on.

489
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,429
All right, well, it was nice
seeing you guys again.

490
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:42,962
- Bye.
- Thank you, bye.

491
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,736
- I'm watching you.
- All right, bye.

492
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,040
- Whoo.
- So you think Carlos is serious?

493
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:50,878
- About what?
- About doing like the Black Panthers,

494
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,746
violence and shit.

495
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,684
I don't know.

496
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,552
I-- I don't think so.

497
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,990
I mean I can't take guys too seriously
who wear sunglasses at night.

498
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,084
Neither can I.
Here, I'll get it.

499
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,186
Thanks.
Sorry.

500
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,862
So... why did you join?

501
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,927
- What, the Brown Berets?
- Yeah.

502
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,997
I saw you sign up.

503
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,536
I don't know, I want
to help out the community.

504
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,308
I think we all need
to stick together.

505
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,444
So do I.

506
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,021
Thanks for
taking me home.

507
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,083
Yeah sure.
It's no problem.

508
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,391
Um, look, Paula.

509
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,488
- Yeah?
- Um...

510
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,125
You know, I was
watching you tonight.

511
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:48,237
When everyone was talking,
you were just listening.

512
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,267
I just wanted to hear
what they had to say.

513
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,572
Yeah--

514
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,636
- Hey, sis!
- What?!

515
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,080
Nothing. Dad's home
from work early.

516
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,812
- Oh my gosh. You didn't tell him--
- Wait--

517
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,320
- No, you've gotta get out of here.
- Wait, Paula-- do you maybe--

518
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,879
- Go go go go!
- want to do something on Friday?

519
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,448
No, go now.

520
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,095
Hey, hey!

521
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,489
- So who's the vato?
- Al, I swear if you say anything--

522
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,433
Papi,
you're home early.

523
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,868
- It's late.
- It's a Saturday night.

524
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,805
- Who brought you home?
- Yeah, tell him who brought you home.

525
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,274
- Wasn't that Vickie's car?
- Who's Vickie?

526
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,210
She's a counselor
I met at camp.

527
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,770
I told you I don't want you
hanging around those people.

528
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,044
You don't even know them.
Vickie goes to college.

529
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,517
- They're agitators!
- Agitators?

530
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,713
You see?
She's agitated!

531
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,452
Mija.

532
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,122
- Who was the boy?
- He was just a friend.

533
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,359
- If you're trying to hide something--
- Mom.

534
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,527
If I was trying to hide, we wouldn't
be parked in front of the house.

535
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:55,027
- If you get pregnant--
- What?!

536
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,708
Mom, is that what
you think this is about?

537
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,404
I don't know what
this is about.

538
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:23,063
"Do your parents and counselors
support you in all your ambitions?"

539
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,121
"Do you think you are
going to graduate?"

540
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,316
Pssh.
Chale, hell no.

541
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,552
- Why not?
- "If not, why not?"

542
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,288
I'm serious, Bobby.

543
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,489
"What is the point?"

544
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,301
Hey, I can hear you
in there.

545
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,437
It's a raging river, sir.

546
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,704
All right, come on
out of there now.

547
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:09,212
Nature's calling, Mr. Hurley,
I have to answer it.

548
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,148
Now you're going to have to
answer to Principal Ingles. Let's go.

549
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,310
What is he supposed to do?

550
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:18,254
- He's supposed to use the bathroom.
- The bathroom is locked.

551
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,154
Well then, he can wait.

552
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,592
That's what people do--
they wait.

553
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,789
Come on.
Let's go.

554
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,923
Mr. Hurley, come on.
Give the guy a break.

555
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:31,366
Rodriguez, this doesn't
concern you.

556
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,501
He didn't hurt anything.
He won't do it again.

557
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,530
- Right, payaso?
- Scout's honor.

558
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,300
Hey, come on,
let us handle it.

559
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:46,680
All right.
Everybody listen up.

560
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:51,950
Don't pee in the bushes.

561
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,423
All right?

562
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,360
Okay.
Open the bathrooms.

563
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,364
Yeah.

564
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,871
Are you guys
tired of this?

565
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:11,101
About how we're being
treated in school?

566
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,305
Well, we might have
something to change it.

567
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:17,007
- What is that?
- It's a survey.

568
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:21,451
It asks questions about our schools
and the way we're being treated.

569
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,647
We're hoping it will
make a difference.

570
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,953
- Can I see one?
- Yeah.

571
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:33,021
"Are you made to feel
ashamed of your heritage?"

572
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,397
Can I fill one out?

573
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,330
Yeah.

574
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,768
- Gimme one of those.
- Here.

575
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,503
- I want one. I want one.
- You guys can all fill them out.

576
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,340
We can change this.

577
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,245
Try to fill these out and get them
back to us as soon as you can.

578
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,739
Here you go.

579
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,123
Try to fill these out.

580
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,440
Please fill out a survey
and return it to me.

581
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,603
- Here, fill out a flyer.
- Everybody take a survey

582
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,476
to evaluate our high school.

583
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,572
People of our school
are supposed to fill out this survey.

584
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:28,847
It's a survey about
our education. Brown power.

585
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:33,380
Thank you so much.
Improve your schools, make a difference.

586
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,552
Hi, how are you? Fill one
of these out, it'll only take a minute.

587
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,062
Make a difference.
Hi, how are you?

588
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,326
Please take one.
It'll only take a minute. Hi.

589
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,799
It'll only take a minute.
Improve your schools, make a difference.

590
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,701
Hey, fill out
this survey, man.

591
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,365
Hey, ladies,
how you doing?

592
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,432
How was
that biology class?

593
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,342
Fill out these surveys, we want to know
what kids at Belmont have to say.

594
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,313
Fill this out.
There you go.

595
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,612
It's a survey.

596
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,277
Here you go.
Thank you.

597
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,810
These things
are a joke.

598
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,379
- They can't even spell.
- You should have no problems.

599
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,985
She wants to be able to ask questions
during class. That's reasonable.

600
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:13,326
Hey, this guy wants
Mexican food in the cafeteria.

601
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,662
Yeah, tacos for everyone.

602
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,669
Hey, the pinche cops across
the street just hassled me, man.

603
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,864
- What?
- Yeah, there's cops out there.

604
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,839
We're not doing
anything wrong.

605
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,966
They been out there for a while.
They been watching us, ey?

606
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:28,638
Hey, did they ask you
any questions?

607
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,409
Every night.
Fucking every night.

608
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,077
Yeah, you can't take these
surveys to the school board.

609
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,416
- Morning, Mr. Hurley.
- Good morning.

610
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,547
- Hey, Lloyd.
- Morning, Sal.

611
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,558
Why not? Look.
Mocte said that if we take--

612
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,857
Mocte. Did he tell you
that he tried this two years ago?

613
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,363
- What?
- Yeah, and they shut them down.

614
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:50,492
- They'll shut this down.
- No, the school board has to listen.

615
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,900
They don't have to listen to you.
Not the students.

616
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,633
- Yes they do.
- They can wait until you graduate

617
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,504
or drop out,
and then problem solved.

618
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,532
You don't even sound
like you're on our side.

619
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:07,245
I am on your side.
I was born on your side.

620
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,480
I have tortillas
in my blood.

621
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,120
You have to
slow down.

622
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,352
Okay? You have
to build support.

623
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,392
Okay.

624
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,161
What about
the school principals?

625
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,225
That's a start.
Try Ingles.

626
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,004
You want Mexican food
served in the cafeteria?

627
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,034
That's one point
in 39, Mr. Ingles.

628
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,474
"Compulsory
bilingual education.

629
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,984
Text books revised to reflect
Mexican-American culture and--"

630
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:44,181
"Teachers who show prejudice
must be transferred."

631
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,448
"Libraries expanded.

632
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,482
End of swatting."

633
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:54,431
"Covered lunch areas.

634
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:58,026
No janitorial punishment."
Mm-hmm.

635
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,263
"New schools"?

636
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:06,300
Tell me, Tanya, who's going
to pay for the new schools?

637
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,704
I don't know, sir.

638
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,113
I don't think
you thought this through.

639
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,920
You're going to graduate
in just a few months.

640
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,787
Are you saying it's not
important to improve our schools?

641
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,792
I don't see what you
have to complain about.

642
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,989
- You've done extremely well here.
- 'Cause it's not just me.

643
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,190
Look, I'm not saying
the schools are perfect.

644
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:31,600
I've pushed for some of these same
changes myself. These things take time.

645
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,103
Will you at least take it
to the school board?

646
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,299
Paula, you have
a bright future ahead of you.

647
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,967
Don't mess things up.

648
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,067
And that group that you've
been hanging out with...

649
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,842
you're too much of an individual
to buy into that collective angst crap.

650
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,850
Be sensible
about this.

651
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,911
- Sal, can I have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

652
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,219
Did you put these kids
up to this?

653
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,589
- No.
- Now I'm not stupid, Sal.

654
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,220
This is going to stop.
Paula Chrisistomo is--

655
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,196
- Chrisostomo.
- Chrisostomo.

656
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,165
Paula Chrisostomo
is a good student.

657
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,497
She shouldn't be
jeopardizing her future.

658
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,527
It's not up to me. The kids
took the initiative themselves.

659
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,802
Oh, and you're not
giving them any advice?

660
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,139
If they ask me a question,
I answer it truthfully.

661
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,509
That's what
a teacher does.

662
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,912
I think that you're trying
to coerce these kids--

663
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,939
Ingles, I'm not trying
to coerce anybody.

664
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,645
"Mr. Ingles" please.

665
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,585
Mr. Ingles, these kids
don't have to be coerced,

666
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,282
they know what's going on.
They know that they're getting

667
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:26,846
the short end of the stick.

668
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,483
I can see why they
kicked you out of Belmont.

669
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:31,017
You just don't know when
to draw the line, Sal.

670
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,154
Well, these kids
are gonna be heard.

671
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,799
- If things go wrong...
- Mm-hmm.

672
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,665
...I'm coming after you.

673
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:41,432
Well, come early,
'cause there'll be a line.

674
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,963
- What was that?
- Oh, I said everything will be fine.

675
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:47,341
Come on, huevones. You just gonna
sit there and watch us clean all night?

676
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,243
You know the reason
we got shit-canned.

677
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,341
It was because it was a stupid idea to
go to the principals in the first place.

678
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,818
- That was Sal's idea.
- No, that was my idea.

679
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:59,050
Your idea was to take a survey, and you
didn't tell us that you did it before.

680
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,580
- Hey, that was two years ago.
- Yeah, and it failed.

681
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,116
Look, we weren't nearly as
organized as we are now.

682
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,685
Screw that, it's the past.

683
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,663
Why don't we just take
the surveys to the school board?

684
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:10,690
Enough with the surveys already!
It didn't work.

685
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,601
Kids are getting their heads
busted for burning their draft cards,

686
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,572
and we can't turn in a few papers
to the school board? Shit.

687
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,268
I'll have to build a coalition.

688
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,777
You know how this thing works.
It's gonna take time.

689
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,642
Time is what we're
running out of.

690
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,341
These kids
are ready to blow.

691
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,152
- Sal...
- Mm-hmm.

692
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,587
You're the teacher,
teach them the system.

693
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,353
Well, the system's been
screwing them their entire lives.

694
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:38,691
I think they have a pretty
good idea of how the system works.

695
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,493
Well, radical reform
doesn't happen overnight.

696
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,635
Did the Watts riots
really change anything?

697
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,768
Well, let's just hope
it doesn't come to that.

698
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,532
Well, I'm gonna
need time to do this,

699
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:53,839
but I just got elected
to the school board.

700
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,346
Yeah, thanks to
the Chicano vote.

701
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,116
Let's get one thing
straight, all right?

702
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,483
It was a countywide election.

703
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:07,423
Oh. Well, y-you're just
sounding like a politician.

704
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:11,554
- You're sounding like an idiot.
- Oh! An idiot, huh?

705
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,927
Unenlightened.

706
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,934
- I prefer idiot.
- Listen, get me more of these surveys.

707
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,334
- I'm gonna have to pass them out...
- Mr. Castro.

708
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,568
so bring them
to me for the next...

709
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,012
The meeting will
now come to order.

710
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,223
Excuse me, Madam Chair.

711
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:43,954
First thing on the agenda is
of course the funding for the Westside.

712
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,058
It will be
approximately 2.5 million.

713
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,343
Mr. Richardson?
Thank you.

714
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,784
- Yes, Madam Chair.
- Yes.

715
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,031
We'll take it up
next week.

716
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:28,971
- I say we call it a day.
- One moment, if I may?

717
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,497
Julian, you never take
just one minute.

718
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:34,841
Earlier today,
I passed out a report.

719
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:38,814
It's a survey taken by a group of
students from our East L.A. schools...

720
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,477
with some
very interesting ideas

721
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:45,147
on how to improve the studies
for Mexican-American students.

722
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:49,091
May we go through it?

723
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:53,324
I think we could all use a little
more time to review the document.

724
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,355
What do you think,
Dr. Nava?

725
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,899
Well, I'd like
to set a timetable.

726
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:02,372
Put the timetable on the agenda
for our next meeting.

727
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,239
This session
is now adjourned.

728
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:08,301
We can't just sit around
and wait for these pendejos!

729
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:10,404
It's time to protest!

730
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,381
Yeah! Hey, I know a vato back from
Vietnam

731
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,407
who makes some
mean Molotov cocktails.

732
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,885
Hey, the point
is nonviolence, pendejo!

733
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,321
Just like Martin Luther King
and Gandhi and Cesar Chavez.

734
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:22,552
What about
the Montgomery Bus Boycott?

735
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,653
- Hey! Hold it, hold it!
- It's like Montgomery.

736
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,392
You know, Dr. King got
everybody to boycott buses right?

737
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:31,196
Yeah, and Cesar is
boycotting grapes.

738
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,533
Yeah, you guys, but this
is about schools, okay?

739
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,663
- So let's boycott!
- The schools?

740
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,106
- Why not?
- That's completely different.

741
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,303
No, it's not!
It's-- it's exactly the same.

742
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,244
We get treated
like second-class citizens!

743
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:45,077
Hey, are we talking
about buses here or what?

744
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,710
Our schools are
the back of the bus!

745
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:51,482
What?

746
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,490
Boycott the schools.

747
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,082
- That's good!
- Yes, boycott.

748
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,457
- No, that's not a good idea!
- Oh it isn't?

749
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,257
No, you wanna know why?

750
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:02,663
Because they don't give a shit
if these kids go to school or not!

751
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,863
- Actually, they do!
- Oh, how so professor?

752
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,736
A.D.A.--
Average Daily Attendance!

753
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,899
Schools get money
from the state

754
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,772
according to how many
students are present!

755
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,370
Empty chairs,
empty pockets!

756
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:18,210
- They need us!
- So what, bunch of kids stay home sick?

757
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,376
No, we show up
and then we leave!

758
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,784
- Si.
- Walkout.

759
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,085
A walkout, yeah.

760
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:27,681
- A walkout.
- A walkout. Walkout.

761
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,125
Walkout, guys!

762
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,025
I like that! Walkout!

763
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,155
- Walkout!
- Let's do it!

764
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:37,065
Come on! Let's go!
Walkout, walkout...

765
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:40,332
Walkout, walkout,
walkout, walkout!

766
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:45,300
Molotov cocktails
and walkouts worry me.

767
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,607
I mean, I think there could
be a better way to do this.

768
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:51,079
Why didn't you
say anything?

769
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,150
This whole thing
can backfire on us.

770
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:57,620
If we attack the principals
and the school board members...

771
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,484
they're gonna fight back.

772
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,856
It's not an attack,
it's a protest.

773
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,521
I don't know.
Yeah, I want better schools.

774
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:08,122
I want a Chicano mayor
from East L.A.

775
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,567
So, are you
declaring your candidacy?

776
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,366
No.

777
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,930
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Maybe?

778
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:22,044
Hey, holmes.
Hey, check it out.

779
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,877
- What is it?
- Smile for the camera.

780
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:29,079
- Check out those pigs right there.
- Cheese!

781
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,180
- Queso.
- Make sure they get your good side.

782
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:36,522
Check that out.

783
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,918
Come on, Fernie,
you missed a candy wrapper.

784
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:14,192
Come on, pick it up.
Let's get that.

785
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,631
You got something else
here by the drainpipe.

786
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,999
By the rain gutter,
Fernie, let's go.

787
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,800
This whole quarter's
got to be clean.

788
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,773
Not one piece
of trash.

789
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,866
Come on, come on, don't forget
these papers over here.

790
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,706
Not one piece
of trash.

791
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:30,008
Come on, I've been here
long enough already.

792
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,880
Don't you wanna go home?

793
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:35,282
You got two milk cartons
under that table.

794
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:40,218
Fernie, you got two milk cartons
under that table, clean it up.

795
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,248
Clean up
the two milk cartons.

796
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,192
Come on, Fernie,
all the trash.

797
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,696
All of it. How many times
do I gotta say it?

798
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,664
Come on, we've been
doing this all day.

799
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,224
Two milk cartons
and you're off the hook!

800
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:52,792
Clean up the two milk cartons,

801
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:55,634
put them in the trash pile,
and let's get out of here.

802
00:47:55,672 --> 00:48:00,632
- Fernie.
- Fernie, it's not worth it.

803
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,907
- Pick up that broom.
- Just do what he says.

804
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,574
- Come on, he just wants you to quit.
- Hey, you stay out of this!

805
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:07,880
- I did not ask you!
- He wants you to quit.

806
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,081
Just do what he says, okay?
Just do what he says.

807
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:14,113
- Hey, Fernie, look at me.
- Come on.

808
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,625
Pick up that broom,
or you're out of here.

809
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,753
Please, Fernie,
just do it, okay?

810
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:21,059
Come on.

811
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,362
Please, Fernie.

812
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,328
Last chance, Fernie,
pick up the damn broom!

813
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,668
That's right,
pick it up.

814
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:36,406
All right. Now you got
a pile of trash over here.

815
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:39,074
Hey, you got two milk
cartons under that table!

816
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,584
- Fernie? Fernie?
- Hey!

817
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,824
Happens to so many kids.
The ones who don't fit in,

818
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,659
- they get pushed out.
- This boy made a poor choice.

819
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,995
He didn't have a choice.
You don't know Fernie.

820
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,433
Oh, I know Fernie.
At least he didn't kill the guy.

821
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:01,437
He was going to graduate high school.
Now what's he supposed to do?

822
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:04,406
If he wants to fight,
he can fight in the army.

823
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,306
Know what
I'm talking about?

824
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:08,811
- Is there another choice?
- It's an honor.

825
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:11,507
- Is Al going to the army?
- No.

826
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:15,450
If the government asks,
he will go.

827
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,680
The country
must defend itself.

828
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,121
- From what?
- Communism.

829
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,853
We're not stopping communism,
we're probably spreading it.

830
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,953
She's right. I can't
believe I'm defending you.

831
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,520
I'm defending you,
if you go to the army,

832
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,794
they'll send you to the front line.
That's where they send all the Chicanos.

833
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,529
I've heard that too,
Panfilo. I believe it.

834
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,400
That's where Woody's
brother got killed.

835
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:37,407
If you want to live in this country,
you must be willing to die for it.

836
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:40,274
All the good things
we have in America...

837
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,039
it's not for free.

838
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,640
That's what's great about our countries,
we can question our leaders.

839
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:50,685
You're all so smart,
start your own country.

840
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:56,586
- Papi, I'm ready.
- Okay, let's go.

841
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,522
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- The principals know we're blowing out.

842
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,431
- Julian Nava talked to Sal.
- What?

843
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:08,097
They know everything:
who's on the committees, when we meet.

844
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:11,164
- How'd they find out?
- Nava thinks it was the police.

845
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:14,541
- Come on, we're meeting.
- I can't, I have work.

846
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,739
Well, can't you
get out of it?

847
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,751
Papi, Vickie's gonna take me.

848
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:27,416
- Bye. We gotta pick up Bobby and Yoli.
- Okay, go go go.

849
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,561
Aren't we going
to La Piranya?

850
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,262
No, the church.
La chota closed us down.

851
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,939
The police know who we are.
They know what we're up to.

852
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,572
That's why they
closed down La Piranya.

853
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,878
Somebody here's
talking to them.

854
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:56,716
Snitch.

855
00:50:56,753 --> 00:51:00,917
On behalf of all the outside
agitators in this room,

856
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:04,586
I'd like to send a special
message to the police.

857
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:07,995
- Que viva la raza!
- Que viva!

858
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,261
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

859
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,825
I have a special message
for the informant,

860
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:14,530
whoever you are.

861
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,003
Que viva!

862
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,643
Whoo whoo!

863
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,949
Paula is one
of our best students,

864
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:35,048
but she's fallen in
with a radical crowd.

865
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,823
- Is she breaking any school rules?
- Not technically.

866
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:42,093
Paula's trying to convince
her fellow students

867
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:45,260
to boycott the school.
She's trying to stage a walkout.

868
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:48,601
I'm sure you can appreciate
the position that puts me in.

869
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,004
Your daughter
is a good student.

870
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:54,033
And Paula, when you get to college,
you can protest all you want--

871
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,511
hell, it's probably
an elective.

872
00:51:56,546 --> 00:52:01,040
If I have to expel one student
to protect all the others, I'll do it.

873
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:08,719
I'm sorry,
what was that?

874
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:10,282
He says he will speak
to his daughter.

875
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:12,318
Good.

876
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:16,423
I'd hate to see Paula lose everything
she's worked so hard to attain.

877
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,569
Paula,
these men are serious.

878
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,537
They're gonna make
an example of you!

879
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,334
They're just scared
'cause they know we're right.

880
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,204
You are risking everything.

881
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:29,076
I told you to stay away
from these agitators.

882
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,042
Why do you listen
to those people?

883
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,212
They don't care about you.

884
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:42,649
In a few months,
you graduate...

885
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,421
do whatever you want.

886
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:47,396
Get married, have babies,
work-- whatever!

887
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:55,705
Go back to school.
Go back.

888
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:09,116
- Mr. Castro.
- Yeah?

889
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:11,279
I don't know
if I can do this.

890
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,849
What?
W-what's the matter?

891
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:18,418
Principal Ingles said that he
would expel me if I did the walkouts.

892
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,398
What?
He can't do that.

893
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:24,798
You have every right
to protest.

894
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,061
But what if he can?

895
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,198
What if he could take away
everything that I worked for?

896
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:34,404
The one thing that
I accomplished in life?

897
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:38,107
- Oh.
- What would you do?

898
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:41,083
I can't answer that
for you, I...

899
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,219
- You're my teacher.
- Yeah, you're right, you're right.

900
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:57,097
Every choice has a set
of consequences, right?

901
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:00,625
And you're gonna have to live
through those consequences, not me.

902
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:06,302
Aren't you scared?

903
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,504
Never.

904
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:15,381
You got fired, right?
From your last job?

905
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,113
For the tortilla movement.

906
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,781
Yeah.

907
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:22,155
There was no Mexican-Americans
in student council.

908
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,183
100% Anglo.

909
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,460
So I helped them put together
a political party.

910
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:30,466
And it was good,
they were good.

911
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,768
They ran a strong
campaign, you know,

912
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:36,363
and it came down
to the final debate,

913
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:40,069
and they delivered
their platform in Spanish.

914
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,544
Which follows
which political rule?

915
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:46,106
- Consolidate your power base.
- That's right.

916
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:48,208
It was a scene.
You shoulda seen it.

917
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:52,210
One half was going crazy, the other half
didn't know what the hell was going on,

918
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,450
and the principal comes out
and takes the mic.

919
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,187
He says, "You can't speak
a foreign language in L.A. schools."

920
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,661
Mr. Castro,
you know that.

921
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,494
Did you know the original
California Constitution

922
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:05,023
was written
in Spanish and English?

923
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:07,559
They were
both official languages.

924
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,629
But you still got fired.

925
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,869
It was a good lesson.

926
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,968
Kids learned
about politics.

927
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,241
Guess you did too.

928
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:21,614
Well, that was my choice.

929
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,848
Now you have to
make your choice.

930
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,450
Thank you.

931
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,860
I have been looking
all over for you.

932
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:42,269
- Wilson walked out.
- What?

933
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,796
I know, I know. They didn't
tell anybody, they just did it.

934
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,274
Come on, we have to
have a meeting.

935
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,777
What's wrong?

936
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,939
You go ahead,
I have work.

937
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,845
Can't you get out of it?

938
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,009
Yeah, but...

939
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,110
I'm not going to.

940
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,559
The schools are supposed
to walk out together.

941
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:05,891
- Exactly.
- That's the point.

942
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:08,363
- Right on, Robert.
- Yeah, Robert, what happened?

943
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,628
Were you a part of it?

944
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:12,658
I didn't tell them to,
they just did it.

945
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,102
We know that. Why?

946
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:18,266
Principal canceled some play,
actors got all pissed off

947
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,606
and just started yelling,
"Walkout," and they walked out.

948
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:23,737
- We're gonna get blamed anyway.
- That's a joke.

949
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,420
The other schools
have to go out now.

950
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:42,192
- Yeah, we're gonna get blamed anyway.
- No, hey. Whoa whoa whoa,

951
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,633
- no no. Hold on, wait a minute.
- No. No more waiting.

952
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:48,034
- No, we're not ready.
- We don't have a choice.

953
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,767
Wilson jumped the gun.

954
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,332
- We go out tomorrow. Who's with me?
- I'm with you.

955
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:54,968
Yeah, man, I think
we should go out.

956
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:59,448
- Hold on.
- Hold it, one at a time, guys.

957
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,575
Okay. Uh... was there
any cameras there?

958
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,052
- No.
- No, no photographers, no reporters?

959
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,647
I don't think so.

960
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,714
- Didn't happen.
- What are you talking about?

961
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,955
- The walkout didn't happen.
- Mr. Castro, we know it happened.

962
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,623
Well, no no no, if the news
wasn't there, then it didn't happen.

963
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,632
Tune in tomorrow, Sal,
'cause we're going out.

964
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:22,032
You're not ready yet.
You're not organized.

965
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:25,472
- We're organized.
- How many picket signs do you have?

966
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:27,738
What do they say?

967
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,472
Who's gonna carry them?

968
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:31,776
- Hey, Paula.
- And what about the gangs?

969
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:35,251
We'll be walking
right into their territory.

970
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,685
And what about
after the walkout?

971
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,314
How about the news stations?
Has anybody talked to the news stations?

972
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,085
You talk
to the news stations?

973
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,287
You know what happened
today at Wilson?

974
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:49,526
Nothing. Whole bunch
of kids got home early.

975
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,693
A bunch of kids stood up
for what they believed in.

976
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,725
Yeah, but everybody
has beliefs.

977
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,034
You want to inspire people
with what you believe,

978
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,336
- you gotta get organized.
- We don't have to listen to this--

979
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:01,400
- we could blowout tomorrow.
- You have to get organized.

980
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,912
Chavez organized
the farmworkers.

981
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,972
Dr. King organized
the blacks.

982
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:10,213
- Gandhi, he organized India.
- Also, Che and Zapata.

983
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:12,153
Yeah, you don't think
they're organized?

984
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:14,782
You take your time,
you do your work,

985
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,249
you'll inspire people.

986
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:19,727
How long do you think
it'll take us?

987
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:22,196
Two years.

988
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:24,666
No, I'm just...

989
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:28,728
No no. A week, a week.
It'll take a week.

990
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:31,035
- Wednesday at the earliest.
- We said tomorrow.

991
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,770
Know what?
Let's put it to a vote.

992
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,869
- Let the kids vote.
- No.

993
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,779
Yes. Sal's right.

994
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:41,249
They're the ones
with the most to lose.

995
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:44,583
All those in favor of walking
out tomorrow, please raise your hand.

996
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,587
Wednesday?

997
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,462
All right,
let's get organized.

998
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,006
All right, blowout committee,
Brown Berets, ready?

999
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,242
Ready! Where's Cal State?

1000
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:14,648
- Ready.
- Loyola's ready. What about UCLA?

1001
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:17,949
- Ready!
- Long Beach, USC, Northridge?

1002
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:20,285
All right, Brown Berets,
listen up.

1003
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:22,723
Remember, you keep between
the cops and the kids, you got it?

1004
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:26,525
Passive resistance. If those
pigs try to grab you, go limp.

1005
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,054
Make no mistake, mi gente,
la placa knows this is coming.

1006
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:31,089
The LAPD,
the FBI, the CIA,

1007
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,626
Sheriffs' Department and everybody
else is gonna be there tomorrow,

1008
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:39,301
so I want the Brown Berets and UMAS,
use your head. Take care of these kids.

1009
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:42,539
If any heads get busted,
make sure it's yours, okay?

1010
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,513
I have a question.

1011
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:47,506
What if nobody
walks out?

1012
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,716
They'll walk out.

1013
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,891
We're gonna walk out.

1014
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,864
Tomorrow,
all the schools.

1015
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,334
If we back down now...

1016
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,668
how are we ever
gonna stand back up again?

1017
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,338
Papi's gonna
trip out, huh?

1018
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,078
Good?

1019
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:03,050
I hope you know
what you're doing.

1020
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:08,227
It's gonna be okay.

1021
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:10,459
With 52 deaths today,

1022
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,434
the total number
of American casualties

1023
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:15,960
in Vietnam now stands
at 23,042.

1024
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,565
There is very little hope
for peace on the horizon.

1025
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:22,169
U.S. troops are now bogged
down in a four-year conflict

1026
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:24,338
with no end in sight.

1027
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:28,977
Are you nervous?

1028
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,246
Paula?

1029
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,015
Did you get to sleep?

1030
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,318
No, not really.

1031
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:13,986
Good morning.
Everybody's in a good mood?

1032
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:15,923
- Yeah.
- Good morning.

1033
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,141
Walkout.

1034
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:42,049
- Walkout, Garfield.
- Belmont, walkout!

1035
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:46,043
- Roosevelt, walkout!
- Wilson, walkout.

1036
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,853
Walkout.

1037
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,595
Paula, what are
you doing?

1038
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:01,732
Sorry, Mr. Hurley.

1039
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,171
Paula, get back
in your seat, please.

1040
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,936
Walkout.

1041
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,145
Walkout!

1042
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,480
Lincoln, walkout!

1043
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,645
- Walkout!
- Paula.

1044
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,155
- Where is everybody?
- Be strong, be strong, be strong.

1045
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,851
Walkout!

1046
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:25,884
- Walkout!
- All right, let's take attendance.

1047
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:28,396
Walkout!

1048
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:33,060
Rodriguez,
sit back down.

1049
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:34,865
- Rodriguez!
- Walkout!

1050
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:37,031
Walkout!

1051
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:41,337
Come on! Walkout!

1052
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,039
- Walkout!
- Walkout!

1053
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:48,278
Roosevelt, walkout!
Roosevelt, walkout!

1054
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,615
Wilson, walkout!

1055
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,951
- Walkout!
- Let's go, come on!

1056
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:55,958
Walkout! Walkout!

1057
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:04,099
Walkout!
Come on, you guys!

1058
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:07,395
All right,
let's take attendance.

1059
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,768
- Chiapa.
- Here.

1060
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:13,502
Walkout! Come on,
you guys, keep it going!

1061
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,707
- Viva la raza!
- Viva!

1062
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:32,617
Walkout! Walkout!
Walkout! Walkout!

1063
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,800
Come on, you guys!
Walkout!

1064
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:00,588
Walkout!
Other side, other side.

1065
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:15,226
Walkout! Walkout!

1066
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,943
Stay on the sidewalk,
stay together, move!

1067
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:52,107
- Chicano!
- Power!

1068
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:55,042
- Yes, it's really happening!
- Yeah!

1069
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:57,136
Hey, keep all these people
on the sidewalk!

1070
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,113
Let's go, keep moving!

1071
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:03,883
Off the street!
Get these people off the street!

1072
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:12,984
- Chicano!
- Power!

1073
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,963
Excuse me.
Excuse me?

1074
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:18,489
Aren't you Sal Castro, the teacher
who orchestrated today's walkout?

1075
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,525
Y-yes, I am Sal Castro,

1076
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:24,005
and uh... no, I-I didn't
orchestrate the uh... walkouts.

1077
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,008
The uh... kids did it
in their own.

1078
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:29,034
- Why do you think they did it?
- Well, the Mexican-American community

1079
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:32,172
has long been referred to
as the uh... sleeping giant.

1080
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,547
And uh... today he's getting
his wake up call.

1081
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:48,661
- Chicano!
- Power!

1082
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:51,029
- Viva la raza!
- Viva!

1083
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:54,525
We want equal education
for all! Chicano!

1084
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:58,802
- Chicano! Chicano!
- Honey.

1085
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,399
Honey, come here.

1086
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,984
What is she doing?

1087
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:47,318
Listen up, everybody! I just
got off the phone with Julian Nava,

1088
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:50,848
and the school board said they're
gonna consider our demands...

1089
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:53,088
- next week.
- Whoo-hoo!

1090
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,495
We won, yeah!

1091
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:58,295
Hey, man-- hey, wait a minute.
We didn't win nothing.

1092
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:01,861
A phone call from a coconut saying
he's gonna consider our demands?

1093
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:04,634
Yeah, they're called
negotiations.

1094
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,664
Yeah, I know how
they negotiate with Chicanos.

1095
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,802
We give
and they take.

1096
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:11,745
Well, let's wait and see
what they come back with.

1097
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:15,817
Oh no!

1098
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,842
Hey!

1099
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,855
Wait a minute,
hold on, hold on,

1100
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,585
- wait a minute, hold on.
- We back off now, we're old news.

1101
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,554
All right, what if we meet
the board halfway?

1102
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:29,962
Some schools walk out,
others stay in?

1103
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,058
- A show of weakness.
- You already sent the message.

1104
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:34,092
- Well, let's send it louder.
- Yeah.

1105
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:37,697
Okay okay okay okay.
Let the schools decide.

1106
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:42,006
- Yeah.
- Fine, all right.

1107
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:43,636
- Wilson.
- Garfield,

1108
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,874
- Lincoln.
- Roosevelt.

1109
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:48,042
- Berets.
- Belmont.

1110
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,953
All right.
Garfield?

1111
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:00,120
We're undecided.

1112
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:03,620
- Lincoln?
- Lincoln's gonna stay in.

1113
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:06,066
- Roosevelt?
- We're walking.

1114
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,092
- All right.
- Wilson?

1115
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,105
Wilson stands down
with Lincoln.

1116
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:13,506
- Belmont?
- Blowout.

1117
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:16,170
Blowout!
All right!

1118
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:24,544
Why were you
so quiet tonight?

1119
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,245
I don't know.
Everyone else was talking,

1120
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:31,282
I just, uh... didn't have
that much to say.

1121
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:33,693
Look, I uh...

1122
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,220
I'm uh...

1123
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:39,494
I'm glad you're not
walking out tomorrow.

1124
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:53,947
I, um...
I have to go.

1125
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:55,644
Yeah?

1126
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:59,313
I-- my dad's
probably, um...

1127
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:03,291
waiting for me right now
so I-- I have to-- yeah.

1128
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:06,954
- So I'll call you tomorrow?
- It's probably better if I call you.

1129
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:08,793
All right.

1130
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:16,432
Roosevelt and Belmont
are walking out tomorrow.

1131
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:20,473
Give me enough men
to cover these two schools.

1132
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,340
I want to put
a stop to this.

1133
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:24,403
Yeah, we know all about
this Brown Beret group.

1134
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,471
They're a potentially militant,
dangerous group.

1135
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:30,576
Any kind of communist
affiliation, foreign agents?

1136
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:36,618
My own daughter enters
the house like a thief.

1137
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:49,727
Papi, I didn't want
to wake anybody.

1138
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:53,799
So now you are concerned
about your family?

1139
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,675
I saw you on TV.

1140
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:05,350
My daughter, standing
on a car,

1141
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:07,252
waving a sign.

1142
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:10,383
- How do you think I felt?
- Proud?

1143
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:12,917
- No.
- Did you read the sign?

1144
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:15,327
- Does not matter.
- Did you read the sign?

1145
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:17,832
You were waving it
in the face of a policeman.

1146
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:21,734
- "Equal education for all."
- What is wrong with you?

1147
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:24,500
What is wrong
with what you have?

1148
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,100
I don't know, I just don't
want to be like you.

1149
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,191
Get in.

1150
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:04,241
I brought you some clothes,
and your books.

1151
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:06,747
Your aunt has
a spare room.

1152
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:08,249
I'm going to Vickie's.

1153
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:12,412
He'll cool down
in a few days.

1154
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:16,149
Fathers tend
to worry, you know?

1155
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:18,716
Especially about
their daughters.

1156
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:22,093
I'll handle Papi.

1157
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:29,668
My father used to tell me,
"Never fall in love with a sailor."

1158
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:31,730
Mom, I know how
you met Dad.

1159
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:34,299
I got pregnant.

1160
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:44,315
It's been 20 years,
we've had very few easy days.

1161
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:50,248
Make sure you can live

1162
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:53,261
with the decisions
that you make, mija.

1163
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:09,974
Damn. We can't
even get close.

1164
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,609
All right, get those signs
to the kids. Move it.

1165
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:18,552
- Let's go.
- Quickly, quickly.

1166
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:20,578
Let's go, people.
Let's go, man.

1167
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:24,490
- Come on.
- If we have to push back, we will.

1168
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:26,994
Wait for my command.
Line up now.

1169
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:29,054
Come on.

1170
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,998
Are we making
the right decision?

1171
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:41,267
I really don't know.

1172
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,206
Roll-call.

1173
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,449
Mickey, I need you
to sit back down.

1174
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,955
You need to sit back down
in your seat, Mickey!

1175
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,924
Belmont, walkout.

1176
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:59,689
Walkout, Garfield!
Walkout!

1177
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:04,899
Blowout! Walk-- walkout! -
Garfield, walkout!

1178
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:07,424
I need everybody to go
back to your seats.

1179
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:10,597
Stay seated. I need you
to stay in your seats.

1180
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:13,369
Please, Sylvia do--
Angela, don't do this.

1181
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:16,275
Stop, I need you
to... stop.

1182
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:18,871
Stop! I need you
to step back.

1183
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,741
What?

1184
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:30,158
Open your books
to page 49.

1185
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:36,095
Walkout! Walkout!

1186
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,892
Walkout! Walkout!

1187
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:47,272
This is an unlawful assembly.

1188
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,675
By the order
of the State of California,

1189
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:53,169
- you must return to your schools!
- Get back inside!

1190
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,080
You're making
a big mistake.

1191
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:57,347
- We can't let these guys intimidate us.
- Keep them on the line.

1192
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,354
Students are coming
from everywhere.

1193
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,653
Susan, make sure these kids
keep moving, okay?

1194
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:04,556
Don't let them stop, don't let
them stop. Keep 'em moving.

1195
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:06,618
All right, all right,
all right! Back inside!

1196
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,687
Back inside! Back in...

1197
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,299
Walkout, Garfield!

1198
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,299
Walkout!

1199
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,399
Excuse me, students,
what is going on out here?

1200
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:22,273
Walkout, Garfield!

1201
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:29,345
- We have to.
- Yeah, do it.

1202
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:42,853
Walkout! Walkout!

1203
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:50,527
Carlos! The gate,
get it open!

1204
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:53,132
- Armando, David, let's go!
- The gate!

1205
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:55,973
You have two minutes!

1206
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:01,979
Walkout!

1207
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,712
Walkout!

1208
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:12,993
No! Go back!
Go back!

1209
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:19,798
Return to your classrooms
or you will be arrested!

1210
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:22,497
Walkout! Walkout!

1211
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,904
- Yeah!
- Stay off the street!

1212
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:28,933
Go! Stay on the sidewalk!

1213
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,036
Keep moving.
Stay off the street!

1214
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,070
Keep moving,
keep moving.

1215
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:48,219
It's locked!

1216
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:56,295
- Please, no!
- It's locked!

1217
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:59,899
- We can't go anywhere!
- Please open! It's locked!

1218
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:04,845
One minute!

1219
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,844
Better back up!

1220
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:24,726
Clear them out!

1221
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:53,460
Get off me! Get off!

1222
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:58,031
Stop! Stop hitting them!

1223
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:09,103
Get off the bleachers
or you will be arrested!

1224
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:12,664
I repeat.
Get down from the bleachers

1225
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:15,232
or you will be arrested!

1226
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:51,132
Chrisistomo.
Chrisistomo.

1227
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:56,410
- Paula?
- Here.

1228
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:59,902
Student protests continued
for a second consecutive day

1229
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:02,940
as two East L.A. schools
boycotted classes.

1230
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:05,350
Unlike yesterday's
peaceful demonstrations,

1231
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:08,447
where all five area schools
marched in solidarity,

1232
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:12,426
today's smaller protest
was marred by student violence.

1233
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:15,759
Fortunately, a heavy police
presence kept order

1234
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:18,630
resulting in only
a handful of arrests.

1235
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:21,397
Commentator Earl Brown
has some thoughts

1236
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:24,132
about the events
of the last two days.

1237
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:27,300
What is the Mexican-American
community saying to us

1238
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:31,335
with these random displays
of juvenile rebellion?

1239
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:34,109
Are they just children
acting out?

1240
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,811
Or is there
a much more dangerous element

1241
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:39,649
entering the story?

1242
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,213
Chief of Police
Tom Reddin has specifically

1243
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:44,725
alluded to outside agitators,

1244
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,990
many with ties
to the Communist Party.

1245
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:49,724
But let us ask ourselves,

1246
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:53,894
has it simply become the vogue
for our younger generation

1247
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:56,460
to attack the very institutions

1248
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:58,995
which are the cornerstones
of our society?

1249
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,203
For we, the people
of Los Angeles, know all too well

1250
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:05,337
the results of these types of attacks

1251
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,838
when radical youth take the law
into their own hands.

1252
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:10,851
Chief Reddin
had these comments.

1253
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:14,821
Work still remains. I think we've seen
the last of these so-called walkouts.

1254
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:16,881
- Like hell, you have.
- The aftermath

1255
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:19,018
- of the Watts riots illustrated...
- Can't believe what they did.

1256
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,221
- that civil unrest must be countered
- Neither can I.

1257
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:23,423
- by swift and precise police action.
- Turn it off.

1258
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:28,659
So we got, um...

1259
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,694
we got kids in jail...

1260
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:33,697
and in the hospital.

1261
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:39,506
And all the footage
that, uh...

1262
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:45,180
the kids
were being beat up with,

1263
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,211
none of it, uh...

1264
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:53,226
none of it made it
on the-- on the news.

1265
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:55,320
They want to pretend
that it didn't happen.

1266
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:57,831
It didn't happen.

1267
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,502
Tomorrow's Friday.

1268
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:05,066
I say we take a stand.

1269
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:08,041
They won't let you
just walk out.

1270
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:10,010
We can win
this one, Sal.

1271
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:12,640
We need an escort.

1272
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,443
I'll bring my abuela.

1273
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,151
He's right though,
'cause they don't hit abuelas.

1274
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:21,684
Bullshit.

1275
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,987
My abuela hits back.

1276
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:29,488
Why don't we
just invite everybody?

1277
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:33,433
Parents, brothers, primos.

1278
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:35,265
Kids?

1279
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:37,430
Why not?

1280
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:42,000
Uh... okay,
every school...

1281
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:44,011
has to walk out together,
at the same time.

1282
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:47,610
Yup.

1283
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,445
Together, yeah.

1284
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:55,115
All in favor...
say "Yea."

1285
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:58,023
Yea!

1286
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:52,569
Lincoln, let's walk out.

1287
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:59,718
Walkout! Walkout! Walkout!
Walkout! Walkout!

1288
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:08,023
You know what happened yesterday.
Come on, this is dangerous.

1289
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:11,659
Come on guys,
it's like lambs to the slaughter.

1290
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:14,964
La raza!

1291
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:42,762
Walkout! Walkout!

1292
01:27:04,285 --> 01:27:06,150
Walkout!

1293
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:08,052
- If they come at you, don't resist.
- Walkout!

1294
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:10,387
- Walkout!
- If they come at you, don't resist.

1295
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:12,188
Okay.

1296
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:15,628
- Walkout! Chicano!
- Power!

1297
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:20,129
- Chicano!
- Power!

1298
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:22,159
Viva la raza!

1299
01:27:22,203 --> 01:27:24,865
- Viva la raza!
- Que viva!

1300
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:28,872
- Chicano!
- Power!

1301
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:32,903
- Chicano!
- Que viva!

1302
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:35,575
- Viva la raza!
- Que viva!

1303
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:37,380
- La raza!
- Que viva!

1304
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:39,181
Que viva...!

1305
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:05,775
Leave our children alone!

1306
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:20,220
Your papi's gonna trip.

1307
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:29,665
Anything to say?

1308
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:31,672
It's a beautiful day
to be a Chicano.

1309
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:41,079
And in that spirit,
we're forming a committee

1310
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:44,607
of parents to take over
where the kids left off.

1311
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:48,554
And I'd like to introduce to you
Dr. Julian Nava, ladies and gentlemen.

1312
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:57,096
I have some very good news.

1313
01:28:57,131 --> 01:29:00,191
The board has agreed
to convene on a special session

1314
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:02,532
at Lincoln High
tomorrow evening.

1315
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,663
Looks like
you got their attention.

1316
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:20,587
We did it,
we made them listen,

1317
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:23,351
and we didn't even have to be
sneaky about what we wanted.

1318
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:26,019
- That's a good thing.
- Yeah.

1319
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,585
I-- I gotta go.

1320
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:30,824
Well, actually um...

1321
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:33,766
there's something
I wanna ask you.

1322
01:29:33,801 --> 01:29:37,498
Do you wanna go
to the prom with me?

1323
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:40,871
- I don't know, um...
- You don't have to.

1324
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:42,705
I mean, it...

1325
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:45,076
No, I'd like to.

1326
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:46,637
I would.
I'd like to.

1327
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:48,979
- I have to go.
- Okay okay.

1328
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:55,118
Compulsory bilingual
and bicultural education

1329
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:58,523
will be enacted in all
East Los Angeles high schools.

1330
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:01,494
Corporal punishment
must be stopped.

1331
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:06,057
Janitorial duties should not be
assigned to students as punishment.

1332
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:10,130
Students who speak Spanish
in the classrooms

1333
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:12,662
should not be reprimanded.

1334
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:15,540
Chicanos deserve
a right to a higher education.

1335
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:18,943
No student should be discouraged
from pursuing a college track.

1336
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:25,051
Teachers who show
any form of prejudice

1337
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:27,486
must be transferred
out of the district.

1338
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:31,515
No students or teachers
are to be reprimanded

1339
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:34,084
for participating
in the recent demonstrations.

1340
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:41,000
And restrooms
are to remain open

1341
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:43,629
to all students
at all times.

1342
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:09,029
Viva la raza!
Que viva!

1343
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:22,036
You like it?

1344
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:27,307
Oh, really?

1345
01:31:27,348 --> 01:31:29,646
Oh, thank you!
Here, let's put them on.

1346
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:33,777
They're gonna bring you
good luck tonight.

1347
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:34,947
You'll see.

1348
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:37,082
- Chicano!
- Power!

1349
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:53,470
You Moctesuma Esparza?

1350
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:54,600
- Yes.
- You're under arrest.

1351
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:56,234
- No!
- No!

1352
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:58,438
No more violence! No!

1353
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:08,682
Are you David Sanchez?

1354
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:10,520
LAPD,
you're under arrest.

1355
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:22,798
Gentlemen, you are
under arrest.

1356
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:24,862
Hey, we got a right
to be here, man.

1357
01:32:24,906 --> 01:32:26,897
Hey, you got a warrant?
Get your hands off me.

1358
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:37,141
Paula.

1359
01:32:37,184 --> 01:32:40,153
Please come with me.

1360
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:46,187
Hey, what's wrong?

1361
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:50,493
- What happened?
- The police are arresting everybody.

1362
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:53,398
Mocte, Risco,
Armando, David--

1363
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:55,800
- they're all in jail.
- What about Robert?

1364
01:32:55,836 --> 01:32:57,497
I don't know.

1365
01:32:59,106 --> 01:33:01,097
They probably
arrested Robert.

1366
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:04,600
We have to go find Sal.
He'll know what to do.

1367
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:11,911
Mr. Castro!

1368
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:30,595
- Sal, where is he?
- He's downtown.

1369
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:32,196
Such an idiot.

1370
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,173
I will call my dad right now.
He can take all of us.

1371
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:36,574
- It's not fair.
- This is just social injustice, man.

1372
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,579
- We have to defend ourselves.
- Listen listen! Stop!

1373
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,672
We have to get them
out of jail.

1374
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:44,583
That's all we know.
There's gonna be a bail hearing.

1375
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,816
Someone's got a line
on a Chicano lawyer.

1376
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:50,016
Like there is
such a thing.

1377
01:33:50,057 --> 01:33:51,957
Hey, man, these are
serious charges, all right?

1378
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:55,156
Wait a second, you just said that
disrupting the school is a misdemeanor.

1379
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:57,391
They didn't charge them
with disrupting a school.

1380
01:33:57,431 --> 01:34:00,798
The charged them
with the conspiracy to disrupt a school.

1381
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:05,397
- A conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor?
- Exactly.

1382
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:07,737
Wait a minute,
that doesn't sound so bad.

1383
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:11,643
It's a felony, Bobby. Our friends
are looking at serious time.

1384
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,374
How much?

1385
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:17,609
- 66 years.
- What?

1386
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,682
66 years for banging
on school lockers?

1387
01:34:21,722 --> 01:34:23,553
That's a life sentence.

1388
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:25,821
Hey, they'll never
make that stick.

1389
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:29,591
Yes, they can.
Robert was with us the whole time.

1390
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:33,066
- He'll tell them everything.
- Paula, it's not your fault.

1391
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:50,745
Papi?

1392
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:10,263
I wanted to say
that I was sorry.

1393
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,633
For everything.

1394
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:20,443
You said those who take
chances vas a ver. Bang.

1395
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:22,472
They get hit.

1396
01:35:32,293 --> 01:35:34,523
I didn't know
what I was doing.

1397
01:35:37,631 --> 01:35:41,260
Mr. Castro, Mocte,
the Brown Berets--

1398
01:35:41,302 --> 01:35:43,566
they were all arrested
and thrown into jail.

1399
01:35:45,806 --> 01:35:47,569
You step
in the ring...

1400
01:35:48,609 --> 01:35:50,406
...you get hit.

1401
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:01,153
I should have
listened to you.

1402
01:36:01,188 --> 01:36:03,713
Now you've
disrespected your father,

1403
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:06,454
and now you're
just going to quit?

1404
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,060
You won't
give in to me...

1405
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,123
but you're gonna
give in to them?

1406
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:17,830
I don't agree
with what you were doing...

1407
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:22,736
but they had no right
to beat you kids that way.

1408
01:36:24,378 --> 01:36:26,573
Do you know why...

1409
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:29,447
nobody wants
to fight Latino boxers?

1410
01:36:32,753 --> 01:36:35,244
Because they don't quit.

1411
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,257
Yeah.

1412
01:36:45,866 --> 01:36:47,857
They never give up.

1413
01:37:13,694 --> 01:37:17,357
Bobby?
This is the plan.

1414
01:37:17,398 --> 01:37:19,628
You want me
to go to college?

1415
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:22,932
Mita, you, me
and everybody,

1416
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:25,666
we have to
make a statement.

1417
01:37:25,706 --> 01:37:27,571
Okay, listen.

1418
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:35,345
What do you think
I should be, Pancha, huh?

1419
01:37:35,382 --> 01:37:38,044
How about
an ornithologist, huh?

1420
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:42,980
Maybe I'll teach Spanish.

1421
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:48,585
Mexican-American? Nah.

1422
01:37:48,629 --> 01:37:50,620
Chicano, right?

1423
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:54,497
What are you gonna be
when you grow up, Bobby?

1424
01:37:55,903 --> 01:37:57,598
I don't know.

1425
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,935
When I find out...

1426
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:03,739
then I'm gonna be it.

1427
01:38:13,954 --> 01:38:15,890
Free the East L.A. 13!
Free the East L.A. 13!

1428
01:38:15,925 --> 01:38:17,653
Free the East L.A. 13!
Free the East L.A. 13!

1429
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:34,639
Move move, go go go!
Get out of the way! Come on!

1430
01:38:34,675 --> 01:38:37,235
- Go on, move it!
- Get out of my way!

1431
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:39,178
Out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1432
01:38:41,515 --> 01:38:45,076
Go go go go!

1433
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:06,063
Officers, hold this line!

1434
01:39:13,514 --> 01:39:16,711
Please disperse
and move down!

1435
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:19,184
You must be
on the sidewalk!

1436
01:39:19,219 --> 01:39:23,918
I repeat: Please disperse
and move back!

1437
01:39:25,326 --> 01:39:27,521
Sir, please let me
speak with them.

1438
01:39:28,762 --> 01:39:30,753
I know these people.

1439
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:32,925
Make it quick.

1440
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:46,737
Paula, please.
Help me stop this.

1441
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:50,644
Okay? Before anybody
gets hurt.

1442
01:39:50,684 --> 01:39:53,050
They posted bail,
they're gonna be out soon.

1443
01:39:55,155 --> 01:39:58,647
I wanted to tell you.
I just didn't know how.

1444
01:40:01,395 --> 01:40:03,420
I was doing my job.

1445
01:40:05,299 --> 01:40:07,529
We trusted you.

1446
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:12,471
Well, what did you accomplish
with the walkouts?

1447
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:15,407
Schools aren't gonna change.
The dropout rate's not gonna change.

1448
01:40:15,442 --> 01:40:17,808
Nothing's gonna change.

1449
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:21,406
Y-you might have ruined
13 people's lives.

1450
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:24,312
Was it worth it?

1451
01:40:25,986 --> 01:40:27,783
Yeah.

1452
01:40:27,821 --> 01:40:29,880
It was worth it.

1453
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:36,593
You know, the schools
may not have changed, but we did.

1454
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:49,567
Sal!

1455
01:40:50,577 --> 01:40:52,772
Sal!

1456
01:40:52,813 --> 01:40:54,542
Thank you!

1457
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:57,448
Sal!

1458
01:40:57,484 --> 01:40:59,475
- Thank you, Sal!
- Thank you!

1459
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:08,428
Thank you, Sal!

1460
01:41:08,462 --> 01:41:10,430
Yeah, Sal!

1461
01:41:10,464 --> 01:41:35,150
Sal, thank you!

1462
01:41:54,641 --> 01:42:00,112
- Chicano!
- Power!

1463
01:42:00,147 --> 01:42:03,981
- Que viva la raza!
- Que viva!

1464
01:42:04,017 --> 01:42:08,454
- Que viva Sal Castro!
- Que viva!

1465
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:19,229
- Chicano!
- Power!

1466
01:42:19,266 --> 01:42:30,970
Chicano power!

1467
01:43:23,664 --> 01:43:25,757
What the walkouts did--

1468
01:43:25,799 --> 01:43:28,791
it focused the attention

1469
01:43:28,835 --> 01:43:31,565
now on the Chicanos in the city,

1470
01:43:31,605 --> 01:43:33,470
because these kids
were serious.

1471
01:43:33,507 --> 01:43:35,771
A lot of us had
the same sort of...

1472
01:43:35,809 --> 01:43:39,370
complaints about what
was happening in our lives,

1473
01:43:39,413 --> 01:43:43,474
as far as our education,
so we decided to take a survey.

1474
01:43:43,517 --> 01:43:45,951
That's when we started
to gather that information

1475
01:43:45,986 --> 01:43:47,954
and started interacting
with the school districts,

1476
01:43:47,988 --> 01:43:49,888
saying, "You're not
meeting our needs,

1477
01:43:49,923 --> 01:43:51,857
and-- lookit, we want
to go to college."

1478
01:43:51,892 --> 01:43:54,952
It was the political evolution
of a group of young Chicanos

1479
01:43:54,995 --> 01:43:58,294
in East L.A. and asserting
their rural identity

1480
01:43:58,332 --> 01:44:00,527
and then getting involved
and realizing

1481
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:03,627
that they system wouldn't change
unless you became more direct action.

1482
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:06,730
My decision to walk out was
probably the lightest decision

1483
01:44:06,773 --> 01:44:10,265
in terms of what I would've
liked to have done at that point,

1484
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:13,438
with that kind of youth,
energy and anger.

1485
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:17,883
To see outright
hostility, brutality...

1486
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:20,614
it didn't match the thing
that we were doing.

1487
01:44:20,654 --> 01:44:24,283
We didn't commit a crime,
we were protesting.

1488
01:44:24,324 --> 01:44:26,383
The blowouts
made us all realize

1489
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:28,792
that collectively
we had a strong voice

1490
01:44:28,829 --> 01:44:32,060
and it gave us a power that we
didn't realize that we had before.

1491
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:34,567
This was a time in which
enough Chicano students

1492
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:37,536
had gained mastery
of the tools that were necessary

1493
01:44:37,571 --> 01:44:39,539
to shake up the system

1494
01:44:39,573 --> 01:44:42,838
and had taken the ideals
of the country to heart.

1495
01:44:43,844 --> 01:44:46,779
And so, we protested
for our rights.

1496
01:44:46,813 --> 01:44:48,838
As the bell rang
for the kids to go to school,

1497
01:44:48,882 --> 01:44:52,511
into the classroom, out they went
with their heads held high...

1498
01:44:52,552 --> 01:44:54,782
with dignity.

1499
01:44:54,821 --> 01:44:57,483
It was beautiful
to be a Chicano that day.
