your men together.

us run out of fort worth.

your fault as it was mine.

just find a woman

I'm colonel Granger of
the United States cavalry,

75
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,673
and I really don't care

76
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,508
if one of these men
screwed your horse.

- But Senior...
- Don't "but Senior” me, general.

78
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,848
You led Mexican soldiers
across the border

79
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,891
into the United States.

80
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,685
That is an act of war.

81
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,062
Now, you turn around immediately

82
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,189
and take your men back to Mexico

83
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,977
or I'll have my men open fire.

Now, for you two.

93
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,034

We'll see about that.

95

Now, I can't imagine
what you must've done

96
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,043
to make the Mexican army
chase you across the border,

97
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,921
but I'll guess
it was real stupid.

98
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,757
It wasn't the entire army, sir.

99
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:56,261
Gentlemen, there's only two
kind of men that go to Mexico.

100
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,348
That's cattle rustlers
or fugitives.

101
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,267
We were just there for
an honest card game, sir.

102

- In Mexico?
- Yes, sir.

103
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,766

104
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,775
Well, I think you two

105
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,276
should stay around here
for a while,

106
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,028
until we sort things out.

107
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,240
Is there a saloon here?

108
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,951
It isn't necessarily
what I would call a saloon,

109
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,369
but there's a place
you can find whiskey.

110
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,870
That'll do.

111
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,791
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me,

112
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,158
I have things to take care of.

113
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,191

Um, excuse me?
Does this town have a name?

118
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:46,325
I don't think it has a name.
It's a cavalry outpost.

119
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,526
Is there a place I can get
something to eat around here?

120
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,496
See that little shack
over there?

121
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,999
You can get something
resembling a meal.

122
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,334
Why don't you join me?

123
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,086
I'll let you buy me a drink.

124

- Travis Parker.
- James Andrews.

It's nice to meet you, Jim.

126
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,344
Say, this is a...

127
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,596
Kind of an out of the way place.

128
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,097
What are you doing here?

129
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,391
I'm just passing through
on my way to Arizona.

130
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,394
- Tombstone?
- No, big kill.

131
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,521
Big kill?

132
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,565
- Never heard of it.
- It's a mining town.

133
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,359
They found a mountain
of silver there.

134
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,319
It's been booming ever since.

135
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,436
- Really?
- My brother owns a saloon there.

136
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,901
Really?

137
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,985
Come on. I'll drink to that.

138
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,250
I raise ya.

139
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,887
I call.

140
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,451
Full house.

141
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,590
Three kings? Ha! I win again!

142
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,271
You ain't gonna try
to win your money back?

00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,273

It's a pleasure to meet you.

146
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,109
Likewise.

147
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:56,288
Jim is on his way
to big kill, Arizona.

148
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,622
Never heard of it.

149
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,958
That's, uh, a mining town.

150
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,574
His brother owns a saloon there.

151
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,464
That so?

152
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,673
I don't know much about it,

153
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,008
except what he told me
in a letter.

154
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:12,262
It's booming.
Lots of people, saloons...

155
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,055
Even brothels.

156
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,138
That sounds
like my kind of town.

157
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,480
We were... we were planning
on heading that direction.

158
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,231
Perhaps we can ride with you.

159
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,443
Oh, I certainly
wouldn't mind the company.

160
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,652
If you don't mind
me saying, Jim,

161
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,155
I notice you ain't heeled.

162
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,991
I'm sorry?

163
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,577
Means you don't carry a gun.

164
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,409
I don't have any use for one.

165
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,323
Why don't you pick up
a good Colt before we leave?

166
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,465
My talents are
in business, Travis,

167
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,675
not killing.

168
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,011
He doesn't mean
any disrespect, Jim,

169
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,181
but if we're traveling
through this rough territory,

170
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,017
and if big kill
is what you say it is,

171
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,728
it might be a good idea
to have some protection along.

172
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,190
Doesn't mean
you're gonna use it.

173
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,307
Isn't that what
you two gentlemen are for?

174
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,696
Yeah, well, sometimes people

175
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,403
aren't always around
when you need 'em.

176
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,211
(COIN CLINKS)

177
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,720
- You ready?
- Where's Travis?

178
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,177
Tying up some loose ends.

179
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,560
Amazing. In a place like this,

180
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,728
he's able to find
the only attractive woman.

181
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,480
That guy could fall
into a barrel of dicks

182
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,437
and come up with a tit
in his mouth. Come on!

183
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,421
Mr. Logan, where the hell
do you think you're going?

184
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,256
Arizona.

185
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,465
What's in Arizona?

186
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,342
We're starting a new life.

187
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,428
Is that so?

188
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,636
I thought I told you
I wanted you to stay around.

189
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,310
These men are my guides, sir.

190
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,603
We're going to big kill.

191
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,605
I never heard of it,

192
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,523
but if you're going to
Arizona alone,

193
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,776
I'd be very careful
how I choose my guides.

194
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,614
If we meant you any harm, Jim, we
wouldn't have told you to heel yourself.

195
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,782
Oh, I don't think
they mean you any harm.

196
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,868
Harm just seems
to follow these men.

197
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,661
They've only been here two days

198
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,289
and some of my men
want to kill 'em already.

199
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,126
I don't imagine going to Arizona
is going to change that.

200
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:52,211
I appreciate your concern, sir,
but I think we'll be okay.

201
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,301
Good luck.

202
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,899
Whoa.

203
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,652
Having trouble
with your horse, Jim?

204
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:17,612
Can't say I ride too many
horses in Philadelphia.

205
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,340
You'll get used to it. Come on.

206
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,175
Hyah!

207
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,791
Hyah! Ha!

208
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,295
(MUSIC PLAYING)

209
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,708
Ha. Ha.

210
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,753
- Up on the Ridge.
- I see 'em.

211
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,590
- JIM: Who are they?
- I don't know.

212
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,377
We could make
a run for it, but...

213
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,597
Well, we could try west,
but they'd cut us off.

214
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,432
We'd have to go east.

215
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,769
Why do we need to run at all?

216
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,313
It seems like the thing to do.

217
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,646
We don't have to run.
Odds aren't that bad.

218
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,737
You still got that Colt
we told you to buy?

219
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,615
It's in my saddle bag.

220
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,326
It ain't gonna do you
much good in there.

221
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,453
At least look mean.

222
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,945
I don't understand.
We haven't done anything wrong.

223
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,918
Is there something
you're not telling me?

224
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,750
We ain't real liked
in new Mexico.

225
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,805
Well, if it ain't
Jake and Travis.

226
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,807
Howdy, Bob.

227
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,475
I didn't think
you'd be stupid enough

228
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,727
to show your faces
around here again.

229
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,687
You're looking real good, Sam.

230
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,980
Screw you, Travis.

231
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,818
- Reina.
- Jake.

232
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,310
Chisholm's got a bounty
out on you two.

233
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,988
Careful, Bob. Look at the odds.

234
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,499
Gentlemen, ma'am.

235
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,960
We don't want any trouble.

236
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,546
- And who are you?
- Jim Andrews.

237
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,005
I'm an accountant
from Philadelphia

238
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,462
on my way to big kill, Arizona.

239
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,677
Never heard of it.

240
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,512
Well, these men are my guides.

241
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,378
We're just passing through.

242
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,516
Your move, Bob.

243
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,070
Head straight to Arizona.

244
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,739
No side trips.

245
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,659
Especially you.

246
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,870
Don't worry. You have my word.

247
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:55,540
Mister, I don't know you,

248
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,708
so I don't know your word.

249
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,710
I'm gonna have a man go out

250
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,671
and round up
the rest of this outfit,

251
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,464
just to make sure
your word is good.

252
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,967
Thank you, sir.

253
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:10,555
Why don't you take your men
from up on top of that Ridge?

254
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,558
I'm not gonna shoot you
in the back, Jake.

255
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,969
Just the same.

256
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,722
Don't ever come back
to new Mexico.

257
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,019
Come on, hup.

258
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,079
An accountant?

259
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,536
Well, I am.

260
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,867
Hup.

262
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,735
There it is.

263
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,612
If this town is
what Jim says it is,

264
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,239
maybe we stay here awhile.

265
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,658
I'm tired of running.

266
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,870
It's time I settled down,
laid down some roots,

267
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,540
become an honorable citizen.

268
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,001
Let's not go that far.

269
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,961
What do you think, Jim?

270
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:08,047
It'll be good to see my brother.

271
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,879
To big kill.

272
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,463
(MUTTERING)

273
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,702
All right, Jim.

274
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,328
Let's see about
this town of yours.

275
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,661
- Come on! Ha!
- (MUSIC PLAYING)

276
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,054
Ain't much of a Boomtown.

277
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,098
Howdy.

278
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,926
That was rude.

279
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,983
That's it.

280
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,194
The easy lady.

281
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,280
I like the name.

282
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,567
Come on. (CLICKS TONGUE)

283
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,305
This is a nice place.

284
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,975
Is Grant here?

285
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,686
- Who?
- Grant Andrews.

286
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:30,148
No, I don't know any Grant.

287
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,774
I thought he was the owner.

288
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,986
No, the mayor owns this place.

289
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,727
Told you I don't know any Grant.

290
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,118
Is the mayor around?

291
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,662
Went outta town on business.

292
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,369
Should be back in a few days.

293
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,324
How about whiskey?
You ever heard of that?

294
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,841
You don't look like
the whiskey type.

295
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,676
Says the beer drinker.

296
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,917
Especially this one.

297
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,380
I most definitely
am the whiskey type.

298
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,312
Well, I'm proud of you, son.

299
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,144
Guess we're gonna have
to pay for these.

300
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,641
Cover it?

301
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,400
Nope.

302
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,285
Kind of expensive

303
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:28,831
for such a dead town, isn't it?

304
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,868
Maybe so.

305
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,962
Is there a place to stay
around here?

306
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,883
Yeah, you got a hotel
right down the street.

307
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:42,220
Should be plenty of rooms...

308
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,836
For all two of you.

309
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,227
How about our horses?
Is there a stable around here?

310
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,764
Round back.

311
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,742
You know, you boys
looking for some work,

312
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,325
you might need to talk
to the preacher.

313
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,868
Must be a religious town.

314
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,933
Come back, now, you hear?

315
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:42,488
You boys must be new in town.

316
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,116
- We are.
- I'm digger.

317
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,994
I make pine boxes.

318
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,370
I am the last person

319
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,831
who will see
your earthly remains.

320
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,499
How's business?

321
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,413
Been a little too slow
for my liking.

00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,250
You've been accused
of stealing a horse, Andy.

324
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,593
Now's your opportunity
to repent.

325
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,970
I didn't steal any horse.

326
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:51,307
The horse was found
on your homestead, son.

327
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,889
ANDY: I didn't do it.

328
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,538
You'll have a chance
to prove your innocence.

(WHISPERING)

330
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:31,230
Gentlemen, you must be the
travelers that I heard about.

I'm the preacher.

332
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,906
No shit.

333
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,959
What's your business here?

334
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,075
Just passing through.

335
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,133
Well, you're welcome
to rest up then,

336
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,419
resupply if you need.

337
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,608
Let's go see about that hotel.

338
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,387

for the soul.

You boys gonna clean up?

341
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,267
We did.

342
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,149
What's the plan, Jim?

343
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,026
I need to find out
what happened to my brother.

344
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,111
Probably just up and left.

345
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,571
Maybe.

346
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,573
I figure I'll ask
around a little bit.

347
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,700
Shouldn't take too long
to find out where he went.

348
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,370
I don't want to stay here
longer than we have to.

349
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,497
We don't seem very welcome.

350
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,159
We're used to that.

351
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,158
All right.

And a bottle.

Yes, I am.

00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,543
Looks good to me.

362
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,261
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

363
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,679
I was wondering
if you could help me.

364
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,764
Oh, honey, I'm retired.

365
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,766
But I would love to set you
up with one of my ladies.

366
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:06,562
No, thank you.
I'm looking for someone.

367
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:10,274
Maybe you've heard of him.
Grant Andrews?

368
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,484
I don't know anyone named Grant.

369
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,612
He said if
I was ever in big kill,

370
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,115
to come to the easy lady
and ask for him.

371
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,867

to help you, but I...

378
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,915
Is that normal for around here?

379
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,501
Just a situation.

380
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,288
Sometimes these things happen.

381
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,388
I don't think
I caught your name.

382
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,380
Jim.

383
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,686
Jim, you need to talk
to the mayor.

384
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,480
I've heard that.

385
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:32,981
The mayor will be back
in a couple of days.

386
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,847
He can help you find
what you're looking for.

a little remiss

- Yes, sir.
- All right.

Yeah, I recognize 'em.

he ever cleared leather.

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,333
I don't think that man
ever went for his gun.

411
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,416
Well, I guess he should have.

sound like our mayor.

Isn't there something
strange about this town?

We just got here and they're
already trying to run us out.

running things.

00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,827

the person to ask.

like one of them.

to your town here?

to the slaughterhouse,

and spend the money.

What do you do
with all the meat?

than this town needs.

ain't none of our business.

- Please.
- We met your preacher.

- He's not our preacher.
- HENRY: Josie.

511
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,409
Our preacher disappeared
the same day he arrived.

512

in some of our supplies?

- What?

from across the room.

It's a beautiful thing.

518
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,272
I don't think so.

519
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:20,277
She seems out of place,
that's all.

520
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,779
Join us at the easy lady?

521
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,824
No, I think I'm gonna
walk around a little more.

way over there? Come on!

531
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:40,357
I need one for the kid
and two for me.

532
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:45,236
And give the kid
the biggest woman you got.

533
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,197
I want his first experience

534
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,315
to be... special.

535
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,870
Go on, boy, take it down.

Whoo! It's good, ain't it?

538
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:12,180
For Christ's sake.

539
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,933
You give the best table
in the house

540
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,935
to that big buck.

541
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,178
Hey! Boy!

542
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,517
Get outta my seat.

543
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,906
I said...

544
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,574
Get up from that table.

545
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,190
(CRACKS NECK)

546
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,535
I'm sorry, sir.

547
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,007
Well, that's more like it.

548
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,124
(GRUNTS)

549
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,221
Whoa!

550
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:56,055
(SCREAMING)

551
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,603
Oh, no, no, no, no!

552
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,272
Who's the boy now, huh?

553
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,264
- (CHOKING)
- Who's the boy now?

554
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,399
(SNAP)

555
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:52,071
Son of a bitch!

556
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,687
Where is he?

557
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,374
KANE: I hear there's
gonna be a fight.

558
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,334
Johnny Kane.

559
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,337
At your service.

560
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,051
This son of a bitch
murdered my friend.

561
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,663
You wanna die along with him?

562
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:44,040
I don't got a beef
with you, Johnny.

563
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,376
No?

564
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,084
Then drag that stinking
corpse out of this town.

565
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,752
Unless you have
other intentions.

566
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,556
I don't want to fight you.

567
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,515
Nobody ever wants to fight me.

568
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,505
I thought I was gonna get
to kill someone today.

569
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,558
Unh! God!

570
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,193
(SHOUTS)

571
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,495
(MUSIC PLAYING)

572
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,912
You have to cock
the hammer, son.

573
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,660
Don't worry, kid.
You won't feel a thing.

574
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:07,869
Boom.

575
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,839
I don't like him very much.

576
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,502
He seems to be
quite fond of you.

577
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,810
What happened?

578
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:38,858
Seems the paying customers

579
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,819
decided this isn't
the safest town.

580
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,738
So that leaves Travis and myself

581
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:47,366
to play cards with each other.

582
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,777
Seven.

583
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,499
Go fish.

584
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,240
No, what happened
with the fight?

585
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:03,382
One of O'Reilly's boys upset
that very large black man

586
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,802
and it went from there.

587
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,471
You find anything out?

588
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:11,641
No.

589
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:14,475
Sit down, Jim. Have a drink.

590
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,989
We've been thinking.

591
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,741
It might be about time
we leave this town.

592
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,451
They kill people
they don't like.

593
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,862
And they don't like us, Jim.

594
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,623
You expect me to leave?

595
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,834
Just forget about my brother?

596
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:40,586
No, but you can't
do him much good dead.

597
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,840
Just get out of town
for a little while.

598
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:45,508
Let 'em forget about us.

599
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:48,845
Maybe find your brother
in the next town.

600
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:49,846
Maybe you're right.

601
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,082
The mayor's back.

602
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,655
Just trouble with some cowboys.

603
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,115
Trouble?

604
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,075
Tommy and the boys
took care of it. It's okay.

605
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,453
Oh, I can see
how they took care of it.

606
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:56,787
Where is the preacher?

607
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,788
Thirsty?

608
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:09,794
Grant?

609
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,837
Jimmy!

610
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,439
- What are you doing here?
- 1 got your letter.

611
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,607
That was two years ago.

612
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,769
I know. Things have been tough.

613
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,447
I heard. I'm sorry.

614
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,733
She was a good woman.

615
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,911
(LAUGHS) I'm glad you're here.

616
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:38,868
Grant, what's going on
around here?

617
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,918
These your friends?

618
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:46,410
Yes, this is Jake and Travis.

619
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:49,966
Gentlemen.

620
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:54,043
Y'all hungry?

621
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,643
You're now with me, so anything
you want in this town is yours.

622
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:04,105
Does that include the saloon?

623
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,518
I did say anything.

624
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,607
Thank you.

625
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,782
I guess they're not hungry.

626
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,444
Shall we take a walk?

627
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:24,000
I can't believe you're here.
I never heard from you.

628
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,043
I know.

629
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,044
When Kate died, it was...

630
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:31,998
I decided there was nothing
left for me in Philadelphia.

631
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,960
- So I came out here.
- And here you are.

632
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,720
Here I am.

633
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,853
What you saw today was,
unfortunately,

634
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,640
something that happens
when I'm not around.

635
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:51,527
You said this place was booming.

636
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,030
You brought me out here to this?

637
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,532
That was two years ago.

638
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,867
Things have changed.

639
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,201
I can see that.

640
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,038
Business was booming.

641
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,826
And then the mines flooded
and people lost everything.

642
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,712
Myself included.

643
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:12,882
And then someone
walked into my place

644
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,884
and made me an offer
that would save me.

645
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,720
Save you?

646
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,722
- What kind of offer?
- Cattle.

647
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:21,098
Cattle.

648
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:24,060
Big kill gets
a steady stream of cattle

649
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,729
that needs to be
disposed of quietly.

650
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:27,890
Hey.

651
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,687
You're a cattle rustler.

652
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,653
I do not rustle cattle.

653
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,576
We provide a service,

654
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,245
and we make a profit
in that process.

655
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,082
I can't believe
you're involved in this.

656
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,584
They're going to do it anyways.

657
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,586
Jimmy, I know what it is
you're thinking.

658
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,047
I came all the way out here
from Philadelphia.

659
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:58,928
When I get here, I see people
being gunned down in the streets.

660
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:03,099
And then I come to find out that it's
my own brother who's behind it all.

661
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,975
You have no idea
what I'm thinking.

662
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,311
Don't you dare
speak to me that way.

663
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,979
You were not here
when the town went bust.

664
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,107
You did not have to look
families in their faces

665
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,525
when they lost everything.

666
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:13,609
You don't know
what that feels like.

667
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,944
It doesn't make it right.

668
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,237
I'm not saying that it's right.

669
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:17,863
I'm not saying that I like it.

670
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,366
I'm saying that I did whatever
I had to do to survive,

671
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:25,037
to help other families
in this town survive.

672
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:28,246
Bad things happen, like today.
I don't like it.

673
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,908
But there are good people here.

674
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:38,924
And I have a plan
to turn it all around.

675
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:44,762
To make us respectable again.

676
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,093
Respectable?

677
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:54,942
No, you crossed that line.

678
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:57,987
And you took our good
family name with it.

679
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,188
I am still your older brother.

680
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,790
Forgive me.

681
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:13,836
I am tired.

682
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:16,672
And hungry.
And could use a drink.

683
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,715
Please won't you join me?

684
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:20,676
I'll catch up with you later.

685
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,679
I haven't seen you in years.

686
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,887
The hotel makes
a wonderful lamb.

687
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:28,969
I'm not hungry.

688
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,262
I'm gonna take a walk.

689
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,022
I'll see you there later.

690
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,314
It is good to see you.

691
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,236
I am glad you're here.

692
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:56,712
Jim.

693
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,423
- Hi.
- Josie.

694
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,665
What can I do for you?

695
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,305
I don't know.

696
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,026
This seems like the only
sane place in town.

697
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,576
I've never experienced
violence like this.

698
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,895
How do you get used to it?

699
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,364
I don't.

700
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:25,071
I hope I never do.

701
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:31,247
Can I get you something?
Some water?

702
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:34,365
No. No, thank you.

703
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,419
Okay.

704
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,876
You don't fit in this town.

705
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:43,259
Oh, I disagree.

706
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,261
I fit perfectly.

707
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,923
It's the others who don't fit.

708
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,307
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to insult you.

709
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,769
Oh, you didn't insult me.
No, I know what you meant.

710
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,938
I don't want to bother you.

711
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,898
You're no bother.

712
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,981
You're welcome here
any time, Jim.

713
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:05,232
Have a good afternoon, Josie.

714
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,069
Thank you.

715
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:36,260
Jackson.

716
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,231
Don't anger him.

717
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,323
Preacher wants to see you.

718
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:50,159
We're busy.

719
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,492
He's expecting you
in the church.

720
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,411
We could use some hail Marys.

721
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,397
Please, come in.

722
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:37,237
You're all coiled up.

723
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,629
Gotta to be calm, boys.

724
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:46,246
I wouldn't defile
a house of the lord.

725
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,293
Now, you mind removing
your hats in my church?

726
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,568
There we go.

727
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,029
Thank you, gentlemen,
for coming to see me.

728
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,074
You're welcome.

729
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,910
This how you live your life?

730
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:19,325
Just gambling from town to town
until they run you off?

731
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,169
Yeah.

732
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:31,051
Well, I want you two men
in my flock.

733
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:34,263
And I guarantee your lives

734
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:37,266
will be more enriched

735
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:39,935
than playing cards.

736
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,479
We like playing cards.

737
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,108
Allow me a retort.

738
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:48,444
In your current situation,

739
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:52,188
I wouldn't be so quick to
decline such a generous offer.

740
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,944
We'll think about it.

741
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,493
Think carefully.

742
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:02,993
Peace be with you.

743
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:15,927
Preacher.

744
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,282
I'll take two.

745
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,701
Bet you think you're
such a smart and fancy lad,

746
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,370
and I'll bow to you like milord.

747
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,706
But if'n you do,

748
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:45,000
your head's full of them
sweet tea mice.

749
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,209
I don't know what you said,
but thank you.

750
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,625
I'll take one.

751
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,228
MAN: Pick it up.

752
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:06,641
Pick it up!

753
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,736
(MAN SNIFFLES)

754
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:35,342
(COINS DROP)

755
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:37,129
I call.

756
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:41,679
You're betting on a blind.

757
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,064
All right, then.

758
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,519
Full house.

759
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,230
(LAUGHS)

760
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,046
Pick it up.

761
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:31,857
A two!

762
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:34,270
(LAUGHING)

763
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,740
A two.

764
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:41,450
Two?

765
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,786
You're such a shite card player.

766
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:49,291
Look it, your man can't even
beat a white goat.

767
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,835
You should probably
sit down now.

768
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:55,380
I don't think so.

769
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,299
I think I'll keep playing.

770
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,302
I need a new horse.

771
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:02,589
Hey, look at me
while I'm fuckin' ya.

772
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:08,310
(LAUGHING)

773
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:09,767
What'd you do that for?

774
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,319
Perhaps we should play marbles.

775
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,322
We could play go fish.

776
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,109
Maybe I can win at go fish.

777
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:25,533
Aren't you gonna
do something about it?

778
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,366
You did laugh at the man.

779
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,169
You two are making fast friends.

780
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,785
You saying you're
our friend, preacher?

781
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,152
How'd it go?

782
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:12,659
Successful.

783
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,545
I'm assuming you spoke
into the other ear?

784
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,832
You won't have any more
trouble in Springville.

785
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,718
You left him alive?

786
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,220
Unfortunately, yes.

787
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,847
I did play with him a little.

788
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,473
Good.

789
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,181
Better to instill fear
than create a martyr.

790
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:40,527
I need a bath.

791
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,359
By all means.

792
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,865
- She does good work.
- Mm.

793
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,706
There's something I got to do.

794
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:36,958
Whoa.

795
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:43,965
What are you doing here?

796
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,967
Trying to be graceful.

797
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,345
You're interrupting my bath.

798
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:51,588
Oh, I can see that.

799
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:27,676
Jimmy.

800
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,091
Have you met our town preacher?

801
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,028
I have.

802
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,364
Quite the man of the cloth.

803
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:53,654
One should administer justice
and offer salvation as well.

804
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,497
Justice.

805
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:00,375
Murder.

806
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,544
Depends on how
you see the world.

807
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:05,630
Well, I see the world
for what it is,

808
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,299
not what I wish it could be.

809
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,553
Well, I'm glad you two
are becoming fast friends.

810
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:16,057
Not for long. Jim's just passing
through, isn't that right?

811
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:19,060
Well, I'm hoping that I can get
him to stay a little longer.

812
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:22,147
You know, I have
some friends back east

813
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:25,901
that might be very interested
in what's going on around here.

814
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:28,904
I would tread lightly, son.

815
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:29,905
This ain't the east.

816
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:39,706
Johnny Kane. Slow movements.

817
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,791
Well, look who grew a sack.

818
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:42,998
GRANT: Enough.

819
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,136
He isn't to be touched.

820
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,095
You're the man, huh?

821
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,132
Let's go again.

822
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,051
I don't think I can.

823
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:34,970
- (GRUNTS)
- Ooh! Whoa, there.

824
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:38,589
I said, let's go again.

825
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:06,203
You can go out
the same way you came in.

826
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:14,965
What in the hell?

827
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,155
Isn't that the man
from new Mexico?

828
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:01,741
Yup.

829
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,159
What's he doing here?

830
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,570
I do not know.

831
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:13,628
I will see you later.

832
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,046
Yes, you will.

833
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,840
Gentlemen.

834
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:17,921
Miss Olivia.

835
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:26,808
- Good morning.
- Morning.

836
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,810
How you feeling?

837
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:32,147
My head hurts.

838
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,398
You should eat some eggs.

839
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:36,651
That will help.

840
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:37,767
Thanks.

841
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,608
You recognize that horse?

842
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,207
No.

843
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:52,744
Bob Pearson.

844
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,008
If you gentlemen will excuse me,

845
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,677
I have some place to be.

846
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,053
Where you got to be?

847
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:05,680
Jim's got a girl.

848
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,391
Oh. The saloon.

849
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:10,351
No.

850
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,687
Josie from the dry goods store.

851
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,314
Oh, hell.

852
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:16,681
What's that supposed to mean?

853
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:21,196
That's how it always starts
with this one,

854
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:22,906
and then I end up
getting shot at.

855
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:25,116
I don't plan on getting shot at.

856
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:26,701
Never do.

857
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,158
Almost never.

858
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,820
I'll see you gentlemen later.

859
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:39,464
We're gonna get shot at.

860
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:41,296
Yep.

861
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:44,292
Can you do this?

862
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:49,258
No.

863
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:05,990
I understand I've been summoned
to the honorable presence

864
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,784
of our mayor.

865
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:08,945
Have a seat.

866
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,781
Can I get you a drink? A cigar?

867
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,049
I wanted to make sure
that we were on the same page.

868
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,217
Does that matter?

869
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:29,764
Well, yes, I think it does.

870
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,100
You take care of the order.

871
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:34,269
I handle the business
side of things.

872
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,062
Thank you for the clarification.

873
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:38,439
The way you're
taking care of order

874
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,024
is interfering
with the business.

875
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,527
This is how we do business.

876
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:45,196
Better not be wasting my time
with any more with this.

877
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:48,992
I want to make some changes.

878
01:19:48,993 --> 01:19:52,954
- Turn this town around.
- We turned it around.

879
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,411
I want to make it respectable.

880
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,917
- Respectable?
- Mm.

881
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,800
The meeting with the railroad
people went exceptionally well.

882
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,844
I believe they're gonna
choose us as their town.

883
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,304
Why, you don't say.

884
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:11,806
Well, we've still got to...

885
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,808
Deal with Springville.

886
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,184
They keep making
the hard sell, too.

887
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:16,477
But if we can
get the railroad...

888
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,309
I wouldn't worry
about Springville.

889
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:22,518
What did you do?

890
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:25,862
I sent Felicia
to pay a little visit

891
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:27,196
to their mayor.

892
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,438
- Christ.
- Watch your tongue.

893
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,493
This is not
how we get things done.

894
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:33,995
Oh, to the contrary,

895
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:36,956
this is exactly
how we get things done.

896
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:39,500
He's alive, mayor.
Don't worry about that.

897
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,537
You can keep this one
off your little conscience.

898
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:53,431
What will it take
for you to stand down?

899
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:55,013
I won't.

900
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:58,809
I kneel to only one.

901
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:09,197
How much?

902
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:15,534
Wealth is worthless
on the day of the wrath.

903
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,825
Your services
are no longer needed.

904
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:41,185
Cain Rose up against Abel.

905
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:50,022
Well, excuse me, mayor.

906
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,364
I have some souls to save.

907
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:14,595
So what I was saying
is that up in San Francisco,

908
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:16,264
we ever make it that far west,

909
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,474
they got these places
called department stores.

910
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:20,435
They sell clothes...
Get you new duds,

911
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,267
you've been in
those clothes for, like...

912
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:28,943
Should I be looking
for a fight, Bob?

913
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,059
I'm not here for you, Jake.

914
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:34,282
I thought you never
heard about this town.

915
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:38,327
I was just checking
on your... intentions.

916
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:40,121
And what are yours?

917
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:41,539
Business.

918
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,576
There's already enough
to watch out for here.

919
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:47,622
Reckon so.

920
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,508
All right, then.

921
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:53,589
All right.

922
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:06,603
See, Bob could use
himself a new coat.

923
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:09,272
I always liked Reina.

924
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:13,529
See, what I'm saying is,

925
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,111
you know, in those
department stores...

926
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,168
Mr. strong.

927
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:29,545
Nice flowers.

928
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:30,546
Those for me?

929
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:33,466
No, they are for Josie.

930
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:37,178
I thought
you might be coming by.

931
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:39,514
We have a house next door.
You can find her there.

932
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:43,017
- Thank you.
- I should probably let you know

933
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,187
that you I keep a shotgun
behind the counter.

934
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:48,144
I'll be keeping
my eye on you, too.

935
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:51,978
- I would expect so.
- Go on.

936
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,236
And, Jim, call me Henry.

937
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,033
Okay, Henry.

938
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:23,140
- Oh, hi, Jim.
- Hi.

939
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,059
I'm sorry to barge in
on you like this.

940
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,395
No, it's okay.
I was just cleaning up.

941
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:29,063
I don't mean to bother you.

942
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,566
I... I just wanted to
give you these.

943
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:34,735
Oh, that is so sweet. Thank you.

944
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:39,407
I can't tell you the last time
someone brought me flowers.

945
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:43,411
Well, I don't know how often
you get to smile in this town.

946
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:47,331
I thought they might
make you smile.

947
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:49,197
They are lovely. Thank you.

948
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:52,587
I'll leave you.

949
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:56,757
Um, Josie...

950
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,176
I have to ask,

951
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,713
why are you here?

952
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,049
Where else would I go?

953
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:07,633
Anywhere.

954
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:14,108
When my mother died,
my father refused to give up.

955
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,776
I came back here to help.

956
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:19,780
I couldn't leave him here alone.

957
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:22,199
No, of course not.

958
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,286
He has everything in this place,

959
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:26,287
including her.

960
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,460
The town isn't bad,

961
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:33,746
just some of the people.

962
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:41,802
Well, enjoy the flowers.

963
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:43,259
I will. Thank you.

964
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,557
Jim...

965
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:49,675
Can I take you some place later?

966
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:54,480
Yes. I'd like that.

967
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:57,106
Okay.

968
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,272
Crap!

969
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:23,177
Gentlemen.

970
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,846
May I ask what happened to you?

971
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:28,805
I do believe that I have
found the woman of my dreams.

972
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:34,188
I've heard this before.

973
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,773
Jim, how's the new girlfriend?

974
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:39,193
- What new girlfriend?
- Jim is sweet on that

975
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,362
cute little redhead down
at the dry goods store.

976
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:43,364
Josie.

977
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,366
Bought her flowers
and everything.

978
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,867
Yeah, she is a great girl.

979
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,411
You two would make
a fine couple.

980
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:50,494
I never said anything
about being a couple.

981
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:52,832
I like talking to her.

982
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,875
See there?

983
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:56,377
All the more reason
for you to stay.

984
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:58,838
What you said the other day,

985
01:26:58,839 --> 01:27:00,464
do you really think
you can fix this town?

986
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:03,300
I know I can.

987
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:06,470
I've been talking to people
from the railroad.

988
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,055
Railroad?

989
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,682
They don't have a line
that runs through this region.

990
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:11,726
Now we've made a lot of money,
and I plan on offsetting

991
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:12,977
the cost of their track.

992
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:15,312
I think they're gonna say yes.

993
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:17,523
And now that you're here,

994
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:18,855
we can do it together.

995
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:23,946
And you boys, well,
you're welcome to stay

996
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:27,241
and see the rebirth
of this town, hmm?

997
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,527
Much obliged. «- mm-hmm.

998
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:30,911
What about the preacher?

999
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:36,703
Well, I am sure that we can
work something out.

1000
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:42,548
The future.

1001
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:43,789
JAKE: The future.

1002
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:49,211
- Ah, man.
- Howdy, Jake.

1003
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,393
You care to join me?

1004
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:57,438
Gentlemen, uh,

1005
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:00,357
miss Olivia needs my...
Needs my attention.

1006
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:01,567
GRANT: Hmm.

1007
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:03,559
- We should go now, sir.
- Hmm.

1008
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,621
You boys enjoy
the rest of the day.

1009
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:16,238
- I know that Jake will.
- Cowboy.

1010
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:37,934
Nobody runs me out of my town.

1011
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:56,413
It's beautiful.

1012
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:58,450
Yes, it is.

1013
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:05,756
What brings you
all the way out to big kill?

1014
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:08,965
- My brother.
- Besides that.

1015
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:13,931
I had nowhere else to go.

1016
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:15,468
I lost my wife in childbirth.

1017
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:22,805
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

1018
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:30,688
To my surprise,
the sun still rises and sets.

1019
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:36,871
I came out of a fog

1020
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:39,915
and I realized I was

1021
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:41,656
already on my way here.

1022
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:45,504
So this is it?

1023
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:48,799
This is your final destination?

1024
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,093
I find that hard to believe.

1025
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:53,053
Why is that?

1026
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,556
You're a big city person.

1027
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:57,013
This is not a big city.

1028
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:03,606
You may not know me
as well as you think.

1029
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:05,733
There could be things
that keep me around.

1030
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,520
What kind of things?

1031
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,694
The sunset's pretty nice.

1032
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,690
Just the sunset, huh?

1033
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:19,862
No.

1034
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:57,858
This is not what I wanted.

1035
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:02,039
But betrayal...

1036
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,701
Is a sin.

1037
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,799
Look at me.

1038
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,594
This is gonna hurt, mayor.

1039
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:16,926
This is gonna hurt bad now.

01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,654
Please. Please don't do this.

1044
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:35,781

You're not a bad man.

1049
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:34,214
You're not a bad man.
You're just weak.

1050
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:37,673
And the meek shall not
inherit the earth in my town.

1051
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:41,924
String him up.

1053

Yes, it was.

there's beauty somewhere.

1056

I knew that
the first time I saw you.

1057
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:59,967
Well, I better be getting back.

1058

01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:37,981
It's okay.

1084
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:39,188
It's my job.

1085
01:35:57,794 --> 01:36:00,295
You pacing around
is making me nervous.

1086
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:02,787
Good. You know how I feel.

1087
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:06,343
I don't like being in here.

1088
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:08,175
It's like... like a duck trap.

1089
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:16,937
We'll bury your brother
at daybreak.

1090
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:19,398
Then we'll ride
out of here like hell.

1091
01:36:19,399 --> 01:36:21,775
Make sure you get
something to eat, Jim.

1092
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:24,278
There's not gonna be any time
after the burial.

1093
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:25,799
We're gonna ride hard
to the next town.

1094
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:30,189
You sure you need more?

1095
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:37,910
It's cold.

1096
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,461
If it's clear, I'm gonna...

1097
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:42,793
I'm gonna check on digger.

1098
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:54,965
How the hell
did you get in here?

1099
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:59,187
I ain't here to fight.

1100
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:01,023
Then why'd you come?

1101
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:02,983
To tell you I don't agree

1102
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:04,985
with that was done
to your brother.

1103
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:06,101
It wasn't right.

1104
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:10,115
Thank you.

1105
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:12,159
I can help you get out of town,

1106
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:14,776
but we must leave now.

1107
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,460
TRAVIS: You work
for the preacher.

1108
01:37:21,461 --> 01:37:24,004
Why don't I kill you right now?

1109
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:28,216
I work for him,
but I ain't no butcher.

1110
01:37:28,217 --> 01:37:29,798
I still have honor.

1111
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,091
- All right.

1112
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:41,188
What the hell's he doing here?

1113
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:43,357
I'm not here as your enemy.

1114
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:45,895
Well, you as sure hell
ain't a friend.

1115
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:50,030
Please hurry.

1116
01:37:50,031 --> 01:37:51,365
They'll be coming for you soon.

1118
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:55,070
And I'm sorry.

1119
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:03,958
What'd you find out?

1120
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:08,548
Digger will be by at daybreak.

1121
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:09,669
We'll take him to boot hill.

1122
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:12,928
You trust him?

1123
01:38:15,056 --> 01:38:18,183
No. No, I don't.

1124
01:38:18,184 --> 01:38:19,393
I told him
if I smell a crawfish,

1125
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:20,509
I'd shoot him on sight.

1126
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,434
So we wait.

1127
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:30,904
We'll stay with you...

1128
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:32,270

I suggest you do the same.

1160
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:40,742
With the mayor gone,

1161
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:44,037
this place is gonna
get dangerous real fast.

1162
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:45,497
You can pass through new Mexico.

1163
01:40:45,498 --> 01:40:48,581
- I won't stop you.
- Thanks, Bob.

1164
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:53,043
Just in case you need it.

1165
01:40:57,468 --> 01:40:59,177
TRAVIS: Thanks.

1166
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:01,138
Get it back to me when you
get back to new Mexico.

1167
01:41:03,391 --> 01:41:05,517
You boys watch your backs.

1168
01:41:05,518 --> 01:41:08,510
Let's go. Hyah!

1169
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:23,410
What do you think?

1170
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:25,527
I think they're coming for us.

1171
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:31,334
Me, too.

1172
01:41:37,258 --> 01:41:39,259
I'll check the horses.
Get him ready to ride.

1173
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:40,260
1 will.

1174
01:42:07,163 --> 01:42:11,124
Jesus, Jim, couldn't
you get a bigger gun?

1175
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:14,461
If I'm lucky enough
to hit someone,

1176
01:42:14,462 --> 01:42:16,168
I want it to count.

1177
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:20,800
They're coming for us.

1178
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:23,133
We got to get out of here.

1179
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:31,517
You're not going
anywhere, are you?

1180
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,684
They're gonna kill you, Jim.

1181
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:44,773
I know.

1182
01:42:47,495 --> 01:42:50,612

1183
01:42:57,338 --> 01:42:58,578

1184
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:03,416
Jim, that can't be all we have.

1185
01:43:05,388 --> 01:43:07,222
You said we might
run into trouble.

1186
01:43:07,223 --> 01:43:09,339
I was right.

1187
01:43:10,476 --> 01:43:11,726
There's no sign of 'em.

1188
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:15,188
We can get away clean
if we go now.

1189
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:17,180
I'm not going.

1190
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:19,859
What?

1191
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:25,907
Jim...

1192
01:43:25,908 --> 01:43:28,868
You stay here, they'll kill you.

1193
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:30,575
I know.

1194
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:38,247
I can't talk you
out of this, can I?

1195
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,495
No.

1196
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:54,561
Let me guess.

1197
01:43:54,562 --> 01:43:57,349
I'm staying here with Jim.

1198
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:12,620
Well, good luck.

1199
01:44:12,621 --> 01:44:15,248
- Fine.
- Fine!

1200
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:18,752
I'm tired of getting run out
of every town we go to.

1201
01:44:18,753 --> 01:44:21,421
People running us off like dogs.

1202
01:44:21,422 --> 01:44:23,923
So you wanna pick this shithole
to make your stand?

1203
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:25,842
- That's right.
- That's just great.

1204
01:44:25,843 --> 01:44:27,427
We're always running away.

1205
01:44:27,428 --> 01:44:29,304
And notice we're still alive.

1206
01:44:29,305 --> 01:44:31,306
It's time to make
a stand for something,

1207
01:44:31,307 --> 01:44:33,433
and I'm making that stand
here with Jim.

1208
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:35,345
Oh, for Christ's sake.

1209
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:38,271
He's gonna get killed
without us.

1210
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:40,315
He's gonna get killed with us!

1211
01:44:40,316 --> 01:44:41,691
Why do we have to
go down with him?

1212
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:43,151
Because it's
the right thing to do!

1213
01:44:43,152 --> 01:44:44,402
Oh, to hell with
the right thing to do.

1214
01:44:44,403 --> 01:44:45,803
The right thing
to do is stay alive!

1215
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:48,900
He's our friend.

1216
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,251
You're gonna die with him.

1217
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:16,703
What now?

1218
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:22,326
We wait.

1219
01:46:57,578 --> 01:46:58,863
What took you so long?

1220
01:47:01,624 --> 01:47:02,864
I lost track of time.

1221
01:47:07,755 --> 01:47:10,087
Why the hell do you care about
what happens to this town?

1222
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:16,047
I want to finish
what my brother started.

1223
01:47:18,933 --> 01:47:20,389
He's all I had left.

1224
01:47:27,858 --> 01:47:29,609
Then let's take
the fight to them.

1226
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:40,620
Here.

1227
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:42,077
It's hard to miss with this.

1228
01:47:46,961 --> 01:47:49,629
I'd like to pay a visit
to the slaughterhouse.

MAN: What the hell is going on?

1232
01:48:24,581 --> 01:48:26,947
You better have a damn
good reason for being here.

1233
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:32,958
I said get out.

1234
01:48:41,265 --> 01:48:43,182
If you're gonna point that
at someone,

1235
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:44,969
make sure you can
pull the trigger.

1236
01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:48,515
Burn it.

1238
01:49:23,057 --> 01:49:24,057

1240
01:50:22,282 --> 01:50:23,783
When the shooting starts,

1241
01:50:23,784 --> 01:50:26,285
empty both barrels
into the nearest man

1242
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:28,117
and get the hell away.

1243
01:51:02,406 --> 01:51:06,240
I thought you would be
halfway to Mexico by now.

1244
01:51:07,744 --> 01:51:10,156
We didn't have
much luck in Mexico.

1245
01:51:16,003 --> 01:51:17,203
You don't have much luck here.

1246
01:51:31,894 --> 01:51:33,976
Suppose not.

1247
01:51:36,315 --> 01:51:40,026
It's your move, Johnny Kane.

I can't help it. It's who I am.

1254
01:54:35,535 --> 01:54:37,370
What?

01:54:37,371 --> 01:54:39,205
Oh, baby.

1256
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:41,993
It's just a little rough love.

1257
01:55:30,006 --> 01:55:31,496
You got grit, Jim.

1258
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:38,879
I'll give you that.

are no longer needed.

01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:53,522
Any last confessions?

1262
01:55:57,993 --> 01:55:59,073
No.

1263
01:56:01,288 --> 01:56:02,528
My soul's at peace.

1264
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:05,906
Is yours?

PREACHER: Shoot him!

1268
01:57:14,236 --> 01:57:16,237
Shoot him with...

1269
01:57:16,238 --> 01:57:18,113
The gun under your skirt
I gave you.

1270
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:19,229
Shoot him.

1271
01:57:26,623 --> 01:57:27,988
Lin-wah.

1272
01:57:30,585 --> 01:57:31,745
Lin-wah?

(GUNSHOT)

1278
01:58:43,783 --> 01:58:45,319
The hell happened to you?

1279
01:58:48,622 --> 01:58:51,123
She stabbed me, Jake.

1280
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:53,626
I think you'd be
used to that by now.

1281
01:58:53,627 --> 01:58:56,295
- Just get it out.
- All right.

1282
01:58:56,296 --> 01:58:57,463
- That hurt?
- (SHUDDERS)

1283
01:58:57,464 --> 01:59:01,133
Shut up and do it.

1284
01:59:01,134 --> 01:59:02,384
On three.

1285
01:59:02,385 --> 01:59:05,471
- Okay.
- Yeah.

One... (GROANS)

1287

Ow.

1288
01:59:10,518 --> 01:59:11,598
Keepsake.

1289
01:59:14,648 --> 01:59:16,434
He killed the preacher.

1290
01:59:17,692 --> 01:59:20,274
How the hell did he do that?

1291
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:23,322
I don't know.

1292
01:59:23,323 --> 01:59:26,325
Probably the same way we've
been alive all these years.

1293
01:59:26,326 --> 01:59:31,705
- Just lucky, I guess.
- Let's get a drink.

1294
01:59:31,706 --> 01:59:33,332
JAKE: I guess it's on
the house, right?

1295
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:34,448

02:00:05,281 --> 02:00:07,613
Tying up some loose ends.

1299
02:00:12,205 --> 02:00:14,491
I'm gonna miss you.

1300
02:00:17,669 --> 02:00:18,829
Thanks.

1301
02:00:25,552 --> 02:00:27,292
Saying good-bye?

1302
02:00:28,555 --> 02:00:30,222
Gonna be a long ride.

1303
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:32,259
- TRAVIS: Sure was.
- Three whiskeys.

1304
02:00:34,227 --> 02:00:36,603
I thought you two wanted
to settle down some place.

1305
02:00:36,604 --> 02:00:38,814
All this got me thinking
about my own brother.

1306
02:00:38,815 --> 02:00:40,357
Thought I better check in.

1307
02:00:40,358 --> 02:00:42,901
Besides,
we better get out of here

1308
02:00:42,902 --> 02:00:44,642
before you get yourself
a real preacher.

1309
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:48,365
Turn this into
a respectable town, right?

1310
02:00:48,366 --> 02:00:50,242
Well, that's the plan.

1311
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:51,910
There may be others out there.

1312
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:54,246
I'll take care of them. Legally.

1313
02:00:54,247 --> 02:00:56,373
I still have friends back east.

1314
02:00:56,374 --> 02:00:58,706
You have friends out here, too.

1315
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,331
Thank you.

1316
02:01:05,425 --> 02:01:06,967
You're always welcome here.

1317
02:01:06,968 --> 02:01:09,209
Friends.

1318
02:01:15,727 --> 02:01:20,439
You really think
this town is gonna survive?

1319
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:21,940
I got in touch
with the railroad.

1320
02:01:21,941 --> 02:01:23,781
They're gonna come here
and take a look around.

1321
02:01:24,903 --> 02:01:26,643
I think we'll be all right.

1322
02:01:35,789 --> 02:01:38,246
Yeah, I think
you'll be just fine.

1323
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,292
Thank you for everything.

1324
02:01:44,798 --> 02:01:46,423
Miss Josie.

1325
02:01:46,424 --> 02:01:47,755
Came to say good-bye.

1326
02:01:50,970 --> 02:01:53,430
You take care of Jim now.

1327
02:01:53,431 --> 02:01:55,763
- I will.
- He's a wild one.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

1329
02:02:02,982 --> 02:02:04,858
You two try
to stay out of trouble.

1330
02:02:04,859 --> 02:02:08,487
- We always try to.
- Jim?

1331
02:02:08,488 --> 02:02:10,405
You gonna run the saloon now?

1332
02:02:10,406 --> 02:02:12,658
No.

1333
02:02:12,659 --> 02:02:14,910
The madam's gonna run it.

1334
02:02:14,911 --> 02:02:16,526
I'm thinking
about running for mayor.

1335
02:02:18,498 --> 02:02:20,332
You know there's
gonna be more trouble.

1336
02:02:20,333 --> 02:02:22,668
I suspect.

1337
02:02:22,669 --> 02:02:24,586
You're gonna need
some help with that.

1338
02:02:24,587 --> 02:02:26,543
I suspect.

1339
02:02:28,842 --> 02:02:30,050
Hopefully you can find some.

1340
02:02:30,051 --> 02:02:32,052
Yes.

1341
02:02:32,053 --> 02:02:33,668
We'll be around.

You boys take care.

1344
02:02:40,436 --> 02:02:42,604
Hup!

1345
02:02:42,605 --> 02:02:44,812
