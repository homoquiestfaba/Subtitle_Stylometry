Help! Mom!

- Help! Dad! Dad!

<i>Susannah!</i>

00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:26,488
<i>My name is Susannah Cahalan.</i>

10
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:27,635
<i>I'm 21 year-old.</i>

11
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:31,435
<i>And here I am with my dream job
at the New York Post.</i>

12
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,289
<i>Living in New York.. I don't
know, we all have dreams, right?</i>

13
00:01:35,372 --> 00:01:38,417
<i>And don't laugh at me, but to
work at the Post was mine.</i>

14
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:40,388
Hey, Richard, can you
check this out for me?

15
00:01:40,488 --> 00:01:42,588
No. No time for baby
sitting now, Susannah.

16
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:44,073
Go and urge Margo.

17
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:45,073
Go. Go, go.

18
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:48,521
<i>I have my whole life in front of me.</i>

19
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:50,221
<i>I was fearless.</i>

20
00:01:50,304 --> 00:01:54,141
<i>And I had absolutely no idea,
what was waiting for me.</i>

21
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:57,811
- Hey.
- Is that my pen in your mouth?

22
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,983
- Maybe.
- Huh.

23
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,381
You keep that now. You email
me next time, save a tree.

24
00:02:05,444 --> 00:02:08,572
I don't know what's wrong with it.
It just feels, feels off, you know.

25
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:10,268
No, this is good, Susannah.

26
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:12,768
But you just need to move the
last paragraph to the first.

27
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:16,580
And for the love of God,
please find a new headline.

28
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:20,918
"Rear and present danger?
Illegal Russian butt implants."

29
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:24,248
I mean, really? Let me tell
you, you're better than this.

30
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:25,548
I'm just paying my
dues, you know.

31
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:28,425
Slowly, but surely making
my way to the front page.

32
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:30,844
I mean, look. At least,
it's a real story.

33
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:34,390
Real people actually died from this.
I can maybe get someone prosecuted.

34
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:39,228
- I wanna help people.
- You're so pridy. I need major sunglasses right now.

35
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:46,193
- Oh, is that him?
- Oh, my God.

36
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:48,445
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Look at your smile.

37
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:51,490
- Stop!
- Is it your man?

38
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:54,410
- Is he your new hot, sexy man?
- Margo.

39
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:57,746
- You should just calm down.
- It's pretty serious, huh?

40
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,625
- We'll see. Who knows?
- Who knows I can't talk to you rigth now.

41
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,299
Excuse me, pretty lady.

42
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:10,926
- Hey.
- Hey!

43
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,138
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry, I'm so late.
- No, it's okay..

44
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:18,267
- You look cute. Are you nervous?
- Thanks. Um.. No.

45
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,272
- Yeah. I mean, yeah a little bit.
- You shouldn't be. I like this.

46
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:27,776
- This is, yeah. This is me dressing up.
- You look like a tanned Smurf.

47
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,237
Thank you. That's really nice of
you say.

48
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:32,531
I'm kidding. I love it.

49
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:37,828
- All right, you ready?
- Come on. Let's do it.

50
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:41,582
So, Stephen, what is it
that you do for a living?

51
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:45,211
I play music, Mr. Cahalan.

52
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:48,339
Oh, yeah? What genre?

53
00:03:48,422 --> 00:03:53,802
You know The Smiths sorts of meet Tom
Waitsin. That's what I'm going for, at least.

54
00:03:53,886 --> 00:03:56,096
You do that all day, every day?

55
00:03:57,306 --> 00:04:00,477
Yeah, I mean I'm working at record
store, too, when I get the hour.

56
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,799
Which is actually where I met Susannah.

57
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:04,323
I like it, you know. It's fun.
It's a good pocket money.

58
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:05,793
- Pocket money?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:07,024 --> 00:04:10,277
Susannah said that you're
in banking, is that right?

60
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:13,948
Yeah was, but I'm having a
career change at the moment.

61
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:16,617
We're looking at new
options, aren't we, Giselle?

62
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:18,192
It's a new start.

63
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,138
- Hello!
- Hey, Mom, we're on the roof!

64
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:25,209
I am so sorry that we are late again.
Happy birthday, baby.

65
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:28,250
- It's okay. Hi, Mom.
- Oh, my beauty.

66
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,568
Love you. Okay.

67
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:33,593
Hi, I heard you got engaged.
Congratulations.

68
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:34,493
Thank you.

69
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:35,983
- It's exciting.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:36,555 --> 00:04:39,164
Wow. Well, this isn't awkward.

71
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:41,722
- How about some alcohol? Anyone?
- Come.

72
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:42,464
- Good idea.
- Have a seat.

73
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:44,603
- Let's get this party started.
- Tom, congratulations.

74
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:48,566
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

75
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:53,946
<i>Happy birthday, dear Susannah.</i>

76
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:59,493
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

77
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:03,753
- Susannah?
- You okay?

78
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:09,880
Baby. Hey.

79
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:13,737
- Hey.
- Hey.

80
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:15,164
Make a wish.

81
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:23,046
- Want some help?
- Yeah.

82
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:25,872
Ready. One, two, three.

83
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:29,940
- Yeay.
- All right.

84
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:31,602
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

85
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:33,203
Thanks, Mom. Thank you.

86
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:34,956
- Okay.
- Thank you, Dad.

87
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:35,588
Love you, guys.

88
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:36,640
- So I slice it?
- Thank you.

89
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:38,783
- You want me to cut it out?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

90
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:40,842
- Here.
- Can you pass me the plate?

91
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:42,866
- Yes, of course.
- Great.

92
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,194
It looks really yummy.

93
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:51,751
- Okay.
- There you go.

94
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:56,383
- Birthday girl first.
- Thank you.

95
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:58,719
All right, Stephen. You're totally gonna
kill it.

96
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:02,240
Really?

97
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:06,017
- Hey, why are you taking so long?
- Okay, yeah. I know.

98
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:08,938
- Stephen, come on.
- Yeah. All right, all right.

99
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:36,966
- So you didn't like it?
- I didn't say that.

100
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:41,011
I said that it was interesting
and I thought it was cool.

101
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:44,390
Oh, my God. Stephen!

102
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:05,244
- Morning.
- Good morning.

103
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:07,538
That's quite a look.

104
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:12,126
Want some coffee?

105
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:15,880
Oh, no. I'm late. Very late.

106
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:27,391
- Whoa. Gross.
- What?

107
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:29,350
Why are you smiling this
early in the morning?

108
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:30,657
- Oh, come on.
- Nah-uh.

109
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:33,397
Nobody smiles this early in New York city.
That's unnatural.

110
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,025
- Why do have a problem with it, Margo?
- You look ridiculous.

111
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,485
- Maybe I'm happy.
- I know what it is.

112
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:42,114
- It's that budget version of Joey Ramonen.
- Susannah!

113
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,742
See, you didn't smile this morning.

114
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:47,161
What are you not hearing me?
Come, come.

115
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:50,206
I don't give a dirty smelly shit, okay?
Let me be clear to you.

116
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:52,958
If it's true we printed it,
yes it's our consequences.

117
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,709
No. Next time you know to
keep his dick in his pants.

118
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:58,279
And stop hanging on underwear
like it's wet there.

119
00:07:58,797 --> 00:08:01,634
- Gum ball?
- I'm good. Thank you.

120
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:04,595
All right. So you're gonna interview
that creepy senator next week.

121
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,432
I don't hear a
question mark in here.

122
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:09,834
That's because I don't
do question mark.

123
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:11,351
- Susannah, you know that.
-  Right.

124
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:13,513
Anyway, he's remorseful.
He says he's sorry.

125
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,627
He wants to go in the record
apologize to his wife.

126
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:17,048
And I think we should be
a big one, that we need

127
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:20,069
as much as you. You're gonna
bring it home for me.

128
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:27,826
Let me just think about it first.

129
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,454
Really, I ask you to come here to think
about doing it. You're doing it.

130
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:35,709
You're not ready for this? Margo said
you're ready for an assignment like this.

131
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:37,399
And you're not a *** anymore.

132
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:40,965
Hey, hey, back here.

133
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:45,177
All I want you to do is fill the paper.
It's online. You got it?

134
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:49,765
- Got it.
- Okay, good. What do you have for me?

135
00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:51,697
Status online with social media.

136
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:53,721
Yep, sounds awful. Our
editors will love this.

137
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:56,558
You'll have it Thursday night.

138
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,043
I know I will cause I can always
count on you, Susannah Cahalan.

139
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:01,067
Now get the hell out of my office.

140
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:10,327
- I know what you did.
- Was I know?

141
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:12,144
You know exactly what you did.

142
00:09:12,763 --> 00:09:14,967
- Thank you.
- You deserve it.

143
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:17,668
I just had a loud mouth.

144
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:29,054
- Do I need a sneeze guard?
- I'm good. I'm good.

145
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:30,663
Anyway, what are you on right now?

146
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:35,185
I'm on the bed-bug outbreak
and it is so disturbing.

147
00:09:35,572 --> 00:09:36,673
- Yuck.
- What are you on?

148
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:38,697
Um.. status on the internet.

149
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,700
- Look at us with these hard-hitting stories.
- Yeah, they're intense, huh?

150
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:46,780
Edward R. Murrow is just
turning in his grave.

151
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,108
Hey, come on! What are you doing?!
Wake up!

152
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:20,332
<i>Hey Susannah, where are you?</i>

153
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:24,795
<i>I haven't seen you for a few days.
Just check in to see if you're okay.</i>

154
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,537
Hey, Margo?

155
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:01,290
What do you know about the
look of the bed-bug bite?

156
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:03,876
Do you think that you have theme?

157
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,253
Because they're everywhere.
They're hunting my dreams.

158
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:09,715
Look. Is that look like one to you?

159
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:12,635
I don't know what I'm looking.
No, I don't see anything.

160
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:14,678
You, you don't see that?

161
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:17,513
- I see nothing.
- Okay, hold on.

162
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,641
Look, just look. Closely.

163
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:23,187
- Do you not see that?
- I do not see that.

164
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,162
I don't. I don't know what
you're talking about.

165
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,231
Margo, it's right there.

166
00:12:26,232 --> 00:12:28,442
I see you need a tan.

167
00:12:28,526 --> 00:12:31,111
- Come on, you don't.. You can't see?
- Susannah!

168
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,074
What is this shit?

169
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:39,470
You got names out of misspelled.
You're not even source to fact-check.

170
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:39,953
What the hell are you thinking?

171
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:42,122
Legal would have it fit!

172
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:45,584
You said that it would be done
by Thursday! It is a Monday!

173
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:47,972
Um..

174
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:52,424
Right, it's Monday.

175
00:12:54,134 --> 00:12:57,137
Richard, Richard, I'm...

176
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:59,348
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:02,393
I haven't feeling myself lately.
I've been really unwell.

178
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:05,729
I haven't.. I haven't been sleeping.
I'm.. Um..

179
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:09,108
Go to your desk and rewrite, okay?
Watch your spell, watch your grammar.

180
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:12,236
Tonight. Cause this
shit is unreadable.

181
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,155
Even if you weren't feeling well, I didn't
even think you could do something this bad.

182
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:16,667
Now go to your desk
and get it done.

183
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:17,748
Get out of here. Go.

184
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:23,038
And she's still here. She
heard I said, leave.

185
00:13:30,546 --> 00:13:34,133
Hey!

186
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:36,260
Get your ass out of my office.

187
00:13:45,144 --> 00:13:48,731
Even if you weren't feeling well, I didn't
even think you could do something this bad.

188
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,613
Are you okay?

189
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:38,572
<i>Susannah, where are yout?
You are very, very late.</i>

190
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:41,328
<i>You're gonna get your ass in here.
You're gonna miss the 10:00 meeting.</i>

191
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:42,439
<i>Hello.</i>

192
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,465
<i>Susannah, I'm really pissed right now.</i>

193
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:59,593
<i>You're gonna miss the 10:00 meeting and
I don't wanna be doing this, okay?</i>

194
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:02,721
<i>I'm not your mother. Get your shit
together and come to your job!</i>

195
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:04,774
<i>I'm not making a call
like this to you again!</i>

196
00:15:04,774 --> 00:15:05,283
<i>Goodbye.</i>

197
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:07,726
Are you serious?

198
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,809
You know, your career as
a journalist is end when

199
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,713
you start pitching me
story about your mother!

200
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:14,149
Come on, man!

201
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:17,403
Susannah, thank you so much or joining us.
I'm glad you can make it.

202
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:19,513
Who's got something? Anybody?
Anything else?

203
00:15:19,513 --> 00:15:21,687
Those panties? From the Senator?

204
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,942
They're still really
hot right now.

205
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:26,532
We're gonna find all of that information,
because Susannah is on that, right?

206
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:27,774
Susannah, you got it?

207
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:29,620
The interview with the Senator this week.
Are you ready?

208
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,051
Uh-huh.

209
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,064
Yeah, totally. Yeah, right. Yeah.

210
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:35,366
- Are you good?
- Yes, Sir.

211
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:38,966
Okay. We're counting on you.

212
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:40,839
All right, let's switch topics.

213
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:43,215
Let's see what we got. Who's
got something juicy, guys?

214
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,514
Give me something hot and exciting.
Who's got something?

215
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:47,600
There's always a mystery on a
missing main whole covers.

216
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:51,854
Missing main whole covers? Okay,
we could figure that out.

217
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:00,362
I feel really sick, you know.

218
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:02,990
My head hurts and my stomach hurts.

219
00:16:03,073 --> 00:16:06,869
My hands numb and
my leg is numb.

220
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:09,556
I don't know. I don't
feel well, Stephen.

221
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:11,253
I don't feel well. I don't..

222
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:14,467
<i>Are you even listening right now?
Are you on your guitar?</i>

223
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,337
No.

224
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:19,134
<i>- Oh, God.</i>
- Yeah, I'm recording something right now.

225
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:22,176
<i>- Is it like pain in needles?</i>
- I don't know, okay.

226
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:24,929
I don't know. It just feels weird.

227
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:28,724
I've never felt this before. Never.

228
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:33,521
- Are you just hungover from last night?
- I don't know. I didn't even really drink.

229
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,904
- You're not pregnant, are you?
- Okay, you're unhelpful. Bye.

230
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:55,543
Hey, what the hell are you
doing under your desk?

231
00:16:55,626 --> 00:17:00,965
- You know, Stephen, just...
- You wanna talk about it?

232
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:03,676
Do you want me to come
under the desk with you?

233
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:04,956
Yeah.

234
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,234
I'm just gonna go get a coffee.
You want anything?

235
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:15,295
I just wanna sit under my desk
and take some personal cough.

236
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:18,649
It's all the rage with the fussy blonde.

237
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:25,114
Susannah, what's going on?

238
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:30,035
I don't know. I guess, you could say
that I've had these flu-like symptoms.

239
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:34,123
I've had a lot of numbness
on my left arm and leg.

240
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:37,084
I feel my head really fuzzy all the time.

241
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:40,713
I don't know if it
correlates to any of these.

242
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:43,924
I have these..

243
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:46,343
These bed-bug bites on my arm.

244
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:48,257
- Let me have a look.
- Right there.

245
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:49,910
You see 'em?

246
00:17:52,683 --> 00:17:55,452
- Any history of lyme disease?
- No.

247
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:56,918
Okay.

248
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:00,983
You can look at my nose.

249
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:04,486
Can you hold your arms out? Straighten
it in front of your palms like this?

250
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,947
And push against my hands.

251
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:10,878
Okay, good. You can put
your coat right now.

252
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:12,551
And have a seat.

253
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:16,426
I'd like to draw some blood
and do a routine workup.

254
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:17,941
And I'd like to get an MRI.

255
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:20,676
An MRI?

256
00:18:20,676 --> 00:18:22,772
Everything looks normal, but
I just like to be safe.

257
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:25,191
There's a place down the street
that can do one right now.

258
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:51,951
That's it. You're all done.

259
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,221
What? What? Why won't you stop?

260
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:59,310
Do it again! Say it!

261
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,774
I didn't think so.

262
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:21,832
<i>Hi, Susannah.</i>

263
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,100
<i>I do wanna let you know,
we've got some good news.</i>

264
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,563
<i>The MRI came back normal.</i>

265
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:28,714
<i>And we've eliminated the possibility
that yo have a stroke or blood clot.</i>

266
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,634
<i>Two things, that frankly,
I was worried about.</i>

267
00:20:31,717 --> 00:20:34,595
<i>But, there's all sort of clear
that's what matters.</i>

268
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:39,934
Thank you.

269
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:57,949
- Hey, it's me.
- Hey, um..

270
00:20:57,949 --> 00:20:59,749
Aren't you gonna let me in?

271
00:21:01,622 --> 00:21:05,376
Yeah, um.. Look, I'm really tired.

272
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:08,435
I think we should just do another day.
Okay, it's fine.

273
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,769
Because, I can figure it out.

274
00:21:09,913 --> 00:21:12,424
Susannah, I just drove all
the way across the city.

275
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:14,525
Now is good for me.

276
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:23,602
Right, it's really dirty. I have
to clean up. I wasn't expecting..

277
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:32,945
What the hell is that smell, Susannah?

278
00:21:33,028 --> 00:21:35,656
Dad, I said it's really dirty.

279
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:37,908
This place is a mess.

280
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:42,872
Susannah, what have you
been doing in here?

281
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:44,984
Oh, that's Stephen's. That's not me.

282
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:47,608
I don't really drink..
Very much.

283
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:49,962
You have got to get yourself together.

284
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:52,712
You can't live like this.
You're an adult now.

285
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,718
You're not in college anymore.

286
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:57,994
Look, inbetween work and everything,

287
00:21:57,994 --> 00:21:59,973
I barely have time, Dad.

288
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:03,113
Okay, let me take a look at this leak

289
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,797
and then we'll clean it up together.

290
00:22:06,729 --> 00:22:10,482
- Wait, is it here? Or here?
- It's on the top, Dad.

291
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:12,399
Where all the normal drip comes from.

292
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:14,835
It was fine under here. It's all dry.
There's nothing going on here.

293
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:16,374
Let me see.

294
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:19,742
There's a drip.

295
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:22,036
It just happened, Dad.

296
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:27,082
- You didn't see that?
- Susannah, there's no drip.

297
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,252
There is a drip.

298
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:36,425
- So, work going okay?
- Yeah, it's good.

299
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:39,470
Hey listen, don't let the
place go like this again.

300
00:22:39,553 --> 00:22:42,514
It is nice for me to know you live in some
kind of cleanliness and comfort here.

301
00:22:43,557 --> 00:22:46,727
So, this Stephen.

302
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,898
- You really like him, huh?
- Yeah.

303
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:54,109
Yeah, I mean, he's a good guy.

304
00:22:54,193 --> 00:22:57,696
And I think.. I think you'll like
him once you get to know him.

305
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,366
Yeah? Sure he's not some place holder?

306
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:03,828
Coz, a lot of guys, they
don't like to stick around.

307
00:23:03,853 --> 00:23:04,978
Like you, Dad.

308
00:23:06,205 --> 00:23:07,416
Okay, I'm gonna go.

309
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:10,692
I'm kidding. All right, love you.
Drive safe, okay?

310
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:13,824
- Get some trash bags.
- Ah, I will.

311
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:14,957
Love you!

312
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:27,643
Okay.

313
00:23:43,742 --> 00:23:46,999
- Susannah, he's ready.
- What? Who?

314
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,302
The Senator.

315
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:53,909
Oh. Oh, God. Uh..

316
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:55,403
Oh, my God, okay.

317
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,152
Okay, uh.. Let me..

318
00:23:58,215 --> 00:23:59,494
I'm not ready for this.

319
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,243
Just take a deep breath.
You have this.

320
00:24:02,303 --> 00:24:04,972
Good luck.

321
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:10,782
- Hi.
- Hi.

322
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,730
 Thank you for meeting me.

323
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:26,368
Okay, um.. What do you have
to say about your action?

324
00:24:26,452 --> 00:24:30,998
And what do you have to say to
the good people of New Jersey?

325
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:35,127
Obviously, I'm deeply regret
for any of this to happen.

326
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:38,598
I've let myself down...
My family down, and..

327
00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:40,490
And let your pants down?

328
00:24:44,053 --> 00:24:44,758
Sorry.

329
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:47,352
Keep, keep, going with what you,
what you were saying. Sorry.

330
00:24:48,432 --> 00:24:52,737
As I was saying, the people of New
Jersey who elected me are fine people.

331
00:24:52,737 --> 00:24:53,737
And..

332
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,193
I'm sorry. It sounded just
like he said "erected".

333
00:24:59,276 --> 00:25:02,738
I mean, you got it, man. But he
sounded pretty much like that.

334
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:07,535
- Are you all right, young lady?
- Yeah.

335
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:11,247
Yeah, no, I'm good.
No, um, I'm sorry.

336
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,626
- I have more questions.
- I'm sorry, this interview is over.

337
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:16,324
No, no, no!

338
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,194
I can't believe Richard
let this happened.

339
00:25:18,254 --> 00:25:19,495
Did Richard put you up to this?

340
00:25:19,495 --> 00:25:21,816
- No. We haven't finished it.
- This is totally a joke.

341
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,428
Sit down!

342
00:25:22,428 --> 00:25:23,930
- I'm not done with the interview!
- No, we have to leave right now.

343
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,825
I'm not done with this!
You're not leaving me!

344
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:30,501
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

345
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:32,051
It's okay.

346
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:36,772
I'm good, I'm good.

347
00:25:36,856 --> 00:25:38,127
Let me make this clear to you.

348
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:40,877
The publicist, that represents that
Senator, is not just about him.

349
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:43,153
They represent celebrities, and
athletes, and everybody else.

350
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:44,844
And with all of those people,

351
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:47,194
that we may wanna talk to, we
can't even get them on the phone.

352
00:25:47,194 --> 00:25:49,278
Because of what you did here!

353
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:50,770
That is gonna be a problem for me!

354
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,564
That is gonna be a problem for my boss!

355
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:54,036
That is a problem for this paper!

356
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:58,502
You should be fired!
You should be fired!

357
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:05,092
Get out of here. Get out now!

358
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:00,177
I honestly don't know.

359
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:03,800
I know that she's been acting strange.

360
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,945
For sure, for like a week.

361
00:27:06,028 --> 00:27:10,449
Is she drinking a lot?
She looks hungover.

362
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:12,723
Yeah, I don't know. I mean,
I don't think so.

363
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:15,645
But I don't know what she
does with her boyfriend.

364
00:27:15,704 --> 00:27:19,542
- Is she on drugs?
- No. Really?

365
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:22,369
- I don't know, I'm asking.
- I don't think so.

366
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:25,381
- You sure?
- Yeah.

367
00:27:25,464 --> 00:27:27,203
I'm definitely sure she's not on drugs.

368
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:30,059
I don't think she's acting normal,
but I don't think she's on drugs.

369
00:27:30,678 --> 00:27:32,846
Just let me keep my eye on her.

370
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,974
Just for a little while.

371
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:37,476
All right, but I'm gonna tell you this.

372
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,368
You keep me informed,
because if this keeps up,

373
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:41,087
she's gonna have to start
working from home.

374
00:27:41,146 --> 00:27:43,566
I don't know what's going on with her.
Look, I'm serious.

375
00:27:43,691 --> 00:27:44,878
Yeah, I understand.

376
00:27:44,878 --> 00:27:46,910
- I understand.
- Great.

377
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,135
Susannah? Susannah?

378
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:39,014
Stop talking in your sleep.

379
00:29:39,098 --> 00:29:42,142
Susannah! Stop.

380
00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:45,771
Susannah!
What..

381
00:29:49,108 --> 00:29:51,318
Susannah?

382
00:29:51,402 --> 00:29:53,988
Susannah!

383
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:19,054
- Stephen.
- What?

384
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:20,881
You're gonna get me out of here.

385
00:30:21,842 --> 00:30:23,150
You gotta..

386
00:30:23,225 --> 00:30:24,144
What?

387
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:26,010
You gotta get me out of here.
I can't be here any longer.

388
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,938
- No, Susannah.
- Come on, uh..

389
00:30:28,022 --> 00:30:30,566
Susannah, we can't leave
until someone looks at you.

390
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:35,112
- Stephen, I don't give a shit.
- Well, you should.

391
00:30:43,913 --> 00:30:47,458
If you're not gonna help me, I
don't know why you're in here.

392
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:55,799
- Did they give any explanation?
- No, but they said she had a seizure.

393
00:30:55,883 --> 00:30:59,510
Why didn't you call us?
Why didn't you call me?

394
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,992
I didn't have your numbers.

395
00:31:02,312 --> 00:31:03,362
- The whole thing happened really fast..
- You didn't have our numbers?

396
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,160
Did you not think to look on her phone
under Mom and Dad?

397
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:08,938
What kind of idiot doesn't know how to
look at a cellphone under Mom and Dad?

398
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:12,066
I don't know, I just panicked.
I had to get her an ambulance.

399
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:16,445
- What kind of doctors are?
- A nurse. It was a nurse, I think.

400
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:20,407
- You think, it was a nurse?
- Uh-huh, I don't.. I don't know.

401
00:31:20,491 --> 00:31:23,202
The whole thing, they just
said that she had a seizure

402
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:26,372
- and, uh.. and..
- What is wrong with you?

403
00:31:26,455 --> 00:31:28,960
Do you care about her or not?
What were you doing in that..

404
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,393
Yes, of course, I do...

405
00:31:30,393 --> 00:31:34,289
Thomas! Okay, okay.
You know what?

406
00:31:34,713 --> 00:31:38,308
Thank you for taking care of her.

407
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:40,848
Come on.

408
00:31:42,388 --> 00:31:46,350
Susannah, I think it's best
that you come home with us.

409
00:31:48,143 --> 00:31:51,107
I'm sorry, that's.. That's
really sweet of you.

410
00:31:51,107 --> 00:31:52,364
No, thank you.

411
00:31:52,364 --> 00:31:53,939
Susannah, I think it's a good idea.

412
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:57,940
Oh, really, Stephen? Well,
then go and get stuff, huh?

413
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,755
- Susannah, it's not like that.
- No problem. You know what, you should go.

414
00:32:00,755 --> 00:32:02,211
I know it's really hard for you.

415
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,891
Stephen, why don't you go home?

416
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:06,423
And just get some rest, and
I'm gonna take care of her.

417
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:08,905
- It's a good idea.
- I'm gonna gather some of your things.

418
00:32:08,905 --> 00:32:10,595
No! You're not gonna be
gathering anything, okay?

419
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,763
'Cause this is my home, all right?

420
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,253
I call the decisions when I'm here.

421
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,965
- I'm not leaving. I'm not going anywhere.
- Hey, Stephen.

422
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,345
If anything like that ever happens
again, you call me, okay?

423
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:25,598
Of course.

424
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,763
Where's your toothbrush?

425
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:36,047
In the bathroom, Mom, where
all the toothbrush is left.

426
00:32:37,484 --> 00:32:40,154
I love you.

427
00:32:47,494 --> 00:32:50,915
Hey Susannah, come talk to me!

428
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,469
Susannah, come on, down!

429
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:10,100
Hey, honey!

430
00:33:47,513 --> 00:33:49,723
What are you doing?

431
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:55,062
I'm swimming, Mom. I'm just swimming.

432
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:01,068
Come on in.

433
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:04,376
Swim to me.

434
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,950
She was not herself.

435
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,172
I mean, I didn't recognize her.
I'm looking in her eyes,

436
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:12,129
she's looking at me.

437
00:34:12,413 --> 00:34:16,250
And I can tell that she's not there.

438
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,586
It was like she was in a trance.

439
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,530
We're gonna get through this, okay?

440
00:34:28,596 --> 00:34:32,750
- Hey.
- Susannah.

441
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:41,025
Oh, no.

442
00:34:41,108 --> 00:34:43,819
I just think you really need to..
You know,

443
00:34:43,903 --> 00:34:46,113
get some good sleep. Maybe,
we gotta think about a trip.

444
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:49,033
- Go to the lake, maybe.
- Järvelle rentoutumaan.

445
00:34:49,116 --> 00:34:52,411
- Eat great food.
- Absolutely.

446
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:53,408
That's what I feel like.

447
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:55,706
I could use it.

448
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:04,215
It's Stephen.

449
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:08,886
It's not all his fault.

450
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:13,182
I can't handle it. It's young love.
I can't handle it anymore.

451
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:16,352
It's too much for me.

452
00:35:17,728 --> 00:35:19,772
I have to tell him.

453
00:35:24,401 --> 00:35:26,820
What's the Post?

454
00:35:26,904 --> 00:35:30,407
How does the Post. I'm unhappy.

455
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:34,161
I'm so unhappy there. Oh, it's
my editor, Richard. It's Margo.

456
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:36,956
I'm so unhappy.

457
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:39,374
I need to go back to school.

458
00:35:39,374 --> 00:35:41,478
I need to go back to school!

459
00:35:41,478 --> 00:35:43,498
I have to change it up!
I gotta change the oil!

460
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,532
I gotta find a career that
actually has some legs, you know?

461
00:35:47,132 --> 00:35:49,105
I gotta change. I gotta do it.

462
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,603
That's it. That's it!

463
00:35:56,684 --> 00:36:00,187
No, no.

464
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:05,018
No, no, no, God.
No, it's New York.

465
00:36:05,018 --> 00:36:07,736
- It's New York. I'm unhappy.
- It's okay, baby.

466
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,781
I'm unhappy, I'm unhappy.
I'm so unhappy there.

467
00:36:10,781 --> 00:36:12,847
And I can't, I can't handle it.

468
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:16,412
- Susannah?
- Susannah?

469
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:18,497
Oh, my God!

470
00:36:41,395 --> 00:36:44,957
- Am I okay?
- It's not for me to say, but

471
00:36:44,957 --> 00:36:46,291
you seem kind to me.

472
00:36:46,442 --> 00:36:48,251
I've seen this dozens of times before,

473
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:51,225
usually, but bankers and Wall Street guys
who come in here are all stressed out.

474
00:36:51,572 --> 00:36:53,029
There's nothing wrong with them, it's

475
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:54,178
all in their heads.

476
00:36:56,452 --> 00:36:58,466
Look into my eyes and tell me honestly,

477
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,534
because there's no judgements here.

478
00:37:01,498 --> 00:37:04,251
How much alcohol are you drinking a day?

479
00:37:06,045 --> 00:37:08,464
Maybe a glass of wine at night.

480
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:12,270
You know, when my boyfriend comes over.
Or we split a bottle, but

481
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,482
nothing major.

482
00:37:15,387 --> 00:37:18,307
- Beer gigs.
- Any drug use?

483
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,684
Not in a while.

484
00:37:22,603 --> 00:37:24,605
Plain and simple. She's partying too hard,

485
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,941
she's not sleeping and
she's working too hard.

486
00:37:27,024 --> 00:37:30,391
I've seen this happened a lot in
young adults making a transition

487
00:37:30,391 --> 00:37:31,819
from college to working full-time.

488
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:35,032
- It's a changing life.
- That's what you think this is?

489
00:37:35,115 --> 00:37:38,702
Mrs. Nack, I've nearly 20 years
experience in this city.

490
00:37:38,786 --> 00:37:39,924
I've seen it all.

491
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,539
Just make sure she doesn't drink,

492
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:44,801
she takes the anti-seizure meds I'd
prescribed, and everything should be fine.

493
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,169
Okay, great. Thank you.

494
00:39:24,558 --> 00:39:26,644
I can't do this anymore!

495
00:39:26,727 --> 00:39:28,656
What the hell?

496
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:30,343
What the hell?

497
00:39:30,981 --> 00:39:34,360
Hey! No, no, no.

498
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:39,075
- Listen, Susannah. What is going..
- What are you looking at, huh?

499
00:39:40,574 --> 00:39:42,618
Susannah, sit down.

500
00:39:43,827 --> 00:39:46,247
Everybody's fine. I don't know
what I'm doing. I'm broke.

501
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:50,626
I'm gonna lose my job, Stephen
doesn't love me. No one loves me!

502
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:52,358
I'm lost right now, Margo.

503
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:55,607
I have nowhere to go! Nowhere!

504
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:59,161
Honey, honey, you're in the office.

505
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,032
You need to relax a little bit.

506
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:06,308
Babe.

507
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:13,774
- I'm so happy.
- Honey.

508
00:40:14,775 --> 00:40:17,013
Margo, I'm so happy!

509
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:18,569
I know what to do!

510
00:40:18,779 --> 00:40:21,323
Yes! Goddamn, yes!

511
00:40:21,407 --> 00:40:23,094
This is it!

512
00:40:23,094 --> 00:40:25,599
 I'm so happy!

513
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,504
 Margo! God!

514
00:40:29,665 --> 00:40:32,418
Richard! Richard! Yes!

515
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:36,106
Yes, Richard! Come here,
I need to talk to you!

516
00:40:36,106 --> 00:40:38,926
Yes! Yes! God, yes!

517
00:40:38,926 --> 00:40:41,695
Okay, goodbye. Let's go!
Richard, come on!

518
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:45,389
There's nothing funny. Go to,
get to work now. Now!

519
00:40:45,472 --> 00:40:47,980
- Richard, we gotta talk!
- Okay, I'm here.

520
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,194
- Come on!
- I'm here. Yeah.

521
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:49,689
Okay.

522
00:40:49,689 --> 00:40:52,730
What the hell is going on with you? What
are you doing? I was in the meeting.

523
00:40:52,813 --> 00:40:56,358
I need bigger stories,
better stories, Richard.

524
00:40:56,442 --> 00:41:01,228
I need to be able to be a
hard-hitting investigator.

525
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:02,275
And I'm ready for it.

526
00:41:02,281 --> 00:41:04,214
- I'm ready for it.

527
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:06,298
Susannah, you're screaming
through the office,

528
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,596
you're talking a mile a minute.

529
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:11,373
- What the hell is going on with you?
- I'm excited, Richard!

530
00:41:11,457 --> 00:41:13,600
Have you never seen
someone who's passionate

531
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,298
- and excited about something?
- Yup.

532
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:18,172
I know the workers out there who's
kinda typing their computers

533
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:20,633
and get shit done! But I'm not doing that!

534
00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:23,052
Susannah, when is the last
time you spoke to your family?

535
00:41:23,177 --> 00:41:26,972
- I don't think that what matters here.
-What did they say? Did they see you?

536
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:30,684
Richard, they support me.
I'm supported by everyone.

537
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:33,562
But I'm not feeling it from
you, so that's the question.

538
00:41:33,646 --> 00:41:36,029
Do you support me, like
my family support me?

539
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:37,029
Like Margo supports me?

540
00:41:38,734 --> 00:41:41,570
Or what? Hmm?

541
00:41:41,654 --> 00:41:46,534
I want you to go home. I'm gonna support
you from home. I want you to go home.

542
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:47,384
Are you firing me?

543
00:41:47,384 --> 00:41:49,413
No, I'm not firing you.
I'm sending you home.

544
00:41:49,828 --> 00:41:51,200
Great.

545
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,643
Good talk. Send me that email.

546
00:42:05,678 --> 00:42:09,014
Yeah, I need Susannah Cahalan's all
personal file brought up to me.

547
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:10,638
Any contact for a family?

548
00:42:10,638 --> 00:42:12,858
Yeah, thanks.

549
00:43:57,164 --> 00:44:00,584
- I'm sorry, say that again?
- I'm bipolar.

550
00:44:00,668 --> 00:44:03,712
- Tell me why you think you're bipolar.
- I googled it.

551
00:44:03,796 --> 00:44:06,632
- You googled it?
- Yes.

552
00:44:06,715 --> 00:44:10,177
For the last two weeks I'm not be
able to concentrate, eat, sleep.

553
00:44:10,302 --> 00:44:14,265
I smile, I cry, I laugh.
I, I'm happy, I'm sad.

554
00:44:14,348 --> 00:44:19,436
What I do know, doctor,
is I'm a creative person.

555
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,356
And this happens to creative people.

556
00:44:22,439 --> 00:44:24,984
A lot of creative people are bipolar.

557
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:27,021
Bipolar is what makes me who I am.

558
00:44:27,021 --> 00:44:29,289
It's just a part of me and
I have to accept that.

559
00:44:30,573 --> 00:44:34,201
Have you ever felt like this
before, anytime in your life?

560
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:37,746
You mean, I've always been energetic?

561
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:42,793
- Ever suicidal?
- No.

562
00:44:42,877 --> 00:44:45,254
I mean,

563
00:44:45,337 --> 00:44:48,554
everyone daydreams about dying.

564
00:44:48,554 --> 00:44:50,020
But I don't wanna die.

565
00:44:51,176 --> 00:44:56,140
- All right.
- So I'm bipolar, right?

566
00:44:58,058 --> 00:44:59,949
It's too early to say for sure.

567
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:03,379
But, you know, I do see serious
signs of mixed episodes,

568
00:45:03,564 --> 00:45:07,109
meaning extremely high highs
and very low lows.

569
00:45:07,193 --> 00:45:09,236
But, I happened to aggre
with Dr. Samson.

570
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,322
I mean, you have a lot of going on
in your life right now.

571
00:45:11,405 --> 00:45:14,337
Sometimes they come across as
manic and depressive elements.

572
00:45:14,496 --> 00:45:15,996
Typical of bipolar disorder.

573
00:45:16,285 --> 00:45:20,664
But just because you got a bruise on your
face, doesn't mean you've been punched.

574
00:45:20,748 --> 00:45:24,251
So, I'm gonna give you a
prescription for Olanzapine.

575
00:45:24,335 --> 00:45:27,838
It's an anti-psychotic prescribed
to treat mood and thought disorders.

576
00:45:29,006 --> 00:45:31,073
Take these pills

577
00:45:31,073 --> 00:45:32,720
and check back in with me.

578
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,239
Let me know how you responding.

579
00:45:34,595 --> 00:45:38,224
And we'll make a follow-up
appointment in a month.

580
00:45:38,307 --> 00:45:40,601
Why are you walking
away from me right now?

581
00:45:40,684 --> 00:45:42,860
I look this up, all right.

582
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,034
I'm not making it up for fun right now.

583
00:45:45,105 --> 00:45:47,775
Listen to me. You wanna
hear the side effects?

584
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:50,819
Euphoria, fever, general feelings
of discomfort, illness, headache,

585
00:45:50,903 --> 00:45:53,467
hyperventilation, irregular
heartbeats, irritability, Mom,

586
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:54,467
this is it!

587
00:45:55,699 --> 00:45:57,910
It's making me crazy!

588
00:45:57,993 --> 00:46:02,122
Susannah, you have been on them
on 24 hours.

589
00:46:03,374 --> 00:46:05,429
No! It doesn't matter, okay?

590
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,678
They're poison! They're toxic!

591
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:10,971
- Just take the pills.
- You want me to die?

592
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:13,150
Take the pills for me!

593
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,304
Do it for your mother!
Take the pills!

594
00:46:18,472 --> 00:46:20,488
Give them a chance to work!

595
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:22,599
Please!

596
00:46:38,284 --> 00:46:40,201
You know what?

597
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:43,338
When I die,

598
00:46:43,664 --> 00:46:46,166
I want you to bury me right next to granny.

599
00:47:00,222 --> 00:47:04,393
Bipolar? That doesn't seem right to me.

600
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:07,605
Maybe she's drinking too much.

601
00:47:07,688 --> 00:47:09,857
You sure, you're not overreacting?

602
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,408
You haven't seen it so
you don't know, okay?

603
00:47:12,408 --> 00:47:13,490
I'm not overreacting.

604
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:16,385
Our daughter is in trouble

605
00:47:16,385 --> 00:47:18,087
and I am exhausted.

606
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:20,492
And I need you to.. I need you to help me.
I need you to take her.

607
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,772
Okay, I will keep an eye on her.

608
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:30,878
And we will get to the bottom
of this, if we stick together.

609
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:35,299
Intense though, you'll see.
It's really scary.

610
00:47:35,382 --> 00:47:37,259
Okay.

611
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:44,266
- Susannah? Lunch is ready.
- It's a lovely day.

612
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:46,852
Yeah, it's nice out.

613
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:50,523
Do you want juice or water?

614
00:47:57,821 --> 00:47:59,907
Are you okay?

615
00:48:03,577 --> 00:48:06,205
Why don't you go ahead and take a seat.

616
00:48:12,711 --> 00:48:14,797
Want some bread?

617
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:22,471
Thank you.

618
00:48:22,555 --> 00:48:25,432
- Want some butter?
- Oh, no. Okay thank you.

619
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,902
Will you stop?

620
00:48:39,154 --> 00:48:42,283
Just stop chewing.

621
00:48:42,366 --> 00:48:43,825
Aren't you gonna it?

622
00:48:43,825 --> 00:48:47,314
It's your favorite.

623
00:48:47,371 --> 00:48:51,834
Giselle put in a lot of effort
to make this for you.

624
00:48:54,044 --> 00:48:56,046
It was no trouble.

625
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:09,018
Why did you say to me?

626
00:49:09,101 --> 00:49:11,977
Susannah, I didn't say anything.

627
00:49:11,977 --> 00:49:15,131
Susannah, she said nothing to you.

628
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:16,493
No!

629
00:49:16,493 --> 00:49:18,336
No, right there!

630
00:49:18,336 --> 00:49:21,223
Right there! You just
called me a spoiled brat!

631
00:49:21,238 --> 00:49:23,594
- No, Susannah...
- You just said it!

632
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,112
- You just said it again!
- Susannah!

633
00:49:25,112 --> 00:49:26,353
Calm down.

634
00:49:26,353 --> 00:49:28,038
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

635
00:49:28,038 --> 00:49:30,063
- What are you talking about?
- Why did you just say that to me?

636
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:32,002
I haven't done anything to you!

637
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:34,477
- Why did you say that to me?
- She didn't say anything.

638
00:49:34,501 --> 00:49:36,269
- I heard you say it!
- No, Susannah.

639
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:38,000
You just said it to me!

640
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,141
- Susannah, go to your room!
- I just heard you say it!

641
00:49:40,141 --> 00:49:43,021
Go! What is wrong with you?

642
00:49:44,511 --> 00:49:48,474
- Susannah, what is wrong with you?
- No! No! No! No!

643
00:49:48,557 --> 00:49:50,685
- Tell me what is wrong.
- Get away from me!

644
00:49:50,685 --> 00:49:52,680
I can't help you if you don't
tell me what is wrong!

645
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,752
Get away! Get away!

646
00:49:55,752 --> 00:49:57,397
I heard you! I heard you!

647
00:49:57,397 --> 00:49:59,783
I want you get away! You're not gonna take me!

648
00:49:59,783 --> 00:50:02,530
Giselle is trying to kidnap me!

649
00:50:02,613 --> 00:50:06,968
- No. No one's trying to kidnap you.
- Please, please. Don't touch me.

650
00:50:06,968 --> 00:50:09,215
- It's okay.
- Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

651
00:50:25,261 --> 00:50:28,013
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

652
00:50:31,934 --> 00:50:34,228
Look, her EEG is completely normal.

653
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:36,939
Her MRI is normal, her
neurological exam is normal.

654
00:50:37,022 --> 00:50:40,276
Her blood work is all normal.
It's all clear, it's all normal.

655
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:42,848
She's drinking too much
and she's exhibiting

656
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,305
the classic signs of alcohol withdrawal.

657
00:50:45,364 --> 00:50:47,992
I know this is hard to
hear about your daughter.

658
00:50:48,075 --> 00:50:51,829
She needs to take the medications,
stop partying, and get some rest.

659
00:50:51,912 --> 00:50:54,415
I haven't seen her have a
drink in over two weeks.

660
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:58,640
Now, I have been known to enjoy a
glass of wine or two in my day

661
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,255
and all I experienced was a bad hangover.

662
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:03,966
Alcohol withdrawal? Are you kidding me?

663
00:51:04,049 --> 00:51:06,760
Do you really think we're
gonna believe that?

664
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:09,638
She needs to be hospitalized now.

665
00:51:09,722 --> 00:51:11,491
Not tomorrow, not today. Now.

666
00:51:11,491 --> 00:51:13,326
And I'm not leaving here
until we have hospital bed,

667
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,929
that we can put our daughter into, tonight.

668
00:51:15,929 --> 00:51:20,065
So, go ahead, call the police.
I got nothing to lose.

669
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,987
Good morning, Susannah.

670
00:51:26,614 --> 00:51:28,616
How are you today?

671
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:33,753
Thank you.

672
00:51:33,753 --> 00:51:35,626
Would you sit up for me, please, Susannah?

673
00:51:44,298 --> 00:51:46,024
Great, thank you.

674
00:51:46,024 --> 00:51:49,083
- How are you feeling?
- <i>He wants to save his girl,</i>

675
00:51:49,283 --> 00:51:52,258
<i>Susannah gets some help.
What is wrong with you?</i>

676
00:51:52,258 --> 00:51:53,406
<i>You're falling apart..</i>

677
00:51:54,975 --> 00:51:56,711
You gotta get me out of here.

678
00:51:57,391 --> 00:51:59,697
I don't belong here.

679
00:51:59,772 --> 00:52:02,816
And they're all saying bad stuff about me.

680
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,778
Who's saying bad things about you?

681
00:52:06,181 --> 00:52:07,842
<i>Susannah, what is wrong with you?</i>

682
00:52:07,842 --> 00:52:09,081
Them.

683
00:52:09,281 --> 00:52:11,945
The people on the TV right there.

684
00:52:14,995 --> 00:52:17,122
Okay.

685
00:52:25,256 --> 00:52:29,426
Susannah, can you tell me
a little bit about

686
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,471
how you felt before you came
to the hospital?

687
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:38,185
I felt disappeared.

688
00:52:38,269 --> 00:52:40,771
Can you explain that to me a little more?

689
00:52:40,855 --> 00:52:42,367
Tired.

690
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,429
Like I wasn't alive.

691
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:47,236
Now, Susannah, I'm gonna ask you
some basic questions.

692
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:51,657
And I just need you to do your best
and answer it, okay?

693
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,702
- What's your name?
- Susannah Cahalan.

694
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:57,534
- Do you know what year it is?
- God. You don't hear that?

695
00:52:57,534 --> 00:52:59,942
- Hear what?
- That?

696
00:52:59,942 --> 00:53:03,818
Susannah, I just need you to focus
and answer my questions, okay?

697
00:53:05,671 --> 00:53:07,438
You gotta get me out of here.

698
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:09,903
- Right now.
- Susannah.

699
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:11,170
Okay.

700
00:53:12,303 --> 00:53:15,055
Susannah, we're here to help you.

701
00:53:15,139 --> 00:53:17,558
We're not gonna hurt you, okay?
I promise.

702
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:20,105
- All right.
- Don't touch me.

703
00:53:20,105 --> 00:53:21,037
Okay.

704
00:53:21,061 --> 00:53:23,619
I want you to, I want you
to hold out your arms,

705
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:26,067
like you're holding a tray, okay?

706
00:53:29,612 --> 00:53:34,408
No, no, no, no.
I'm not doing it anymore.

707
00:53:34,491 --> 00:53:37,453
- Why are you interrogating me?
- I'm not interrogating you, Susannah.

708
00:53:37,536 --> 00:53:39,169
- I'm.. I'm..
- Get out!

709
00:53:39,169 --> 00:53:40,204
- Get out of my room.
- Okay.

710
00:53:40,206 --> 00:53:42,791
We're gonna leave you alone now,
okay, Susannah?

711
00:53:50,883 --> 00:53:53,010
I recorded some of my songs.

712
00:53:53,093 --> 00:53:56,847
When you listen to it,
you'll remember some stuffs.

713
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:05,689
Hey, talk to me, Susannah.

714
00:54:07,942 --> 00:54:10,110
Please.

715
00:54:16,116 --> 00:54:20,355
I'm.. I'm scared.

716
00:54:20,496 --> 00:54:24,833
I just.. God, Stephen, I feel like..

717
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:30,381
Everyone here is just talking about me.

718
00:54:30,464 --> 00:54:34,426
- I need you, I need you.
- Hey, hey. Listen to me.

719
00:54:36,428 --> 00:54:38,806
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

720
00:54:38,889 --> 00:54:41,350
We can get through it together.

721
00:54:43,102 --> 00:54:45,938
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

722
00:54:50,693 --> 00:54:53,571
I have multiple personality disorder.

723
00:54:53,654 --> 00:54:57,992
Have you been diagnosed by any
psychiatrists or psychologists?

724
00:54:58,075 --> 00:55:00,119
No.

725
00:55:00,202 --> 00:55:02,802
I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist
with bipolar disorder,

726
00:55:02,827 --> 00:55:05,315
but not multiple
personality.

727
00:55:05,374 --> 00:55:08,752
And were you taking any
medications for that?

728
00:55:08,836 --> 00:55:10,115
No.

729
00:55:10,115 --> 00:55:12,700
They tried to, but I refused to take it.

730
00:55:12,923 --> 00:55:14,842
I spit it out.

731
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:21,015
Dr. Khan, I need to get out of here.

732
00:55:21,098 --> 00:55:25,060
- It's not safe for me here, anymore.
- Why it's not safe for you here?

733
00:55:25,144 --> 00:55:27,075
They're talking about me.

734
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:29,203
All of them.

735
00:55:36,405 --> 00:55:38,574
I can hear them.

736
00:55:38,657 --> 00:55:43,120
The nurses.. talking about me.

737
00:55:43,204 --> 00:55:45,289
And I can hear their thoughts.

738
00:55:45,372 --> 00:55:47,791
You can hear their thoughts?

739
00:55:50,294 --> 00:55:54,215
You know, they think I can't hear them,
but I do.

740
00:55:54,298 --> 00:55:57,009
I hear them loud and clear.

741
00:55:59,094 --> 00:56:02,765
I don't wanna talk to you anymore.

742
00:56:57,111 --> 00:56:59,822
Help!

743
00:57:16,505 --> 00:57:19,508
No! No!

744
00:57:19,592 --> 00:57:21,886
Help!

745
00:57:55,294 --> 00:57:59,423
- Help!
- Susannah.

746
00:58:01,842 --> 00:58:04,053
I can assume two possible diagnoses.

747
00:58:04,136 --> 00:58:06,920
First, presentation of schizophrenia

748
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,492
plus a postictal psychosis.

749
00:58:09,516 --> 00:58:13,145
Now, she's clearly psychotic,
but the question is..

750
00:58:13,229 --> 00:58:15,231
Where is the psychotic behavior
coming from?

751
00:58:15,314 --> 00:58:17,358
I'm gonna prescribe a Haloperidol.

752
00:58:17,441 --> 00:58:21,111
It should sedate her and also we could do
some further testing, but

753
00:58:21,195 --> 00:58:23,065
If her behavior doesn't improve,

754
00:58:23,065 --> 00:58:27,682
I think we should locate hospital centre
better equipped to deal with her problem.

755
00:58:27,682 --> 00:58:30,347
No.

756
00:58:30,913 --> 00:58:33,916
My daughter is not going to psycho ward.

757
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:36,794
How do you explain the seizures?

758
00:58:36,877 --> 00:58:41,298
How do you explain that she's
never been like this before?

759
00:58:41,382 --> 00:58:45,636
How can you just arrive at this conclusion
without all of the facts?

760
00:58:46,929 --> 00:58:49,181
Dr. Ryan, why don't you do that
further testing

761
00:58:49,265 --> 00:58:52,685
before you threaten us with
psychiatric hospitals?

762
00:59:59,752 --> 01:00:02,421
- Well?
- They have nothing.

763
01:00:02,504 --> 01:00:03,864
Nothing?

764
01:00:03,864 --> 01:00:05,731
She's been here over a week. I mean,
they have to have something.

765
01:00:05,799 --> 01:00:08,087
They don't know. Each of them is
giving us a different diagnosis.

766
01:00:08,087 --> 01:00:11,596
One is saying bipolar, the next
one is saying szhizophrenic,

767
01:00:11,596 --> 01:00:13,531
the other saying psychotic. I don't know.

768
01:00:13,531 --> 01:00:14,671
What is that even mean?

769
01:00:14,671 --> 01:00:17,994
It means nobody knows what
the hell is going on.

770
01:00:18,354 --> 01:00:20,564
She's not psychotic, whatever it is.

771
01:00:20,648 --> 01:00:25,236
I agree. I think it's just the most
convenient explanation for them.

772
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:30,032
So, we need to continue putting pressure on them,
so that they continue to investigate.

773
01:00:30,115 --> 01:00:33,202
- Okay, it's important. Pressure.
- Yeah.

774
01:00:33,285 --> 01:00:35,581
Well, I just want you both
to know that I'm planning

775
01:00:35,606 --> 01:00:37,772
on being here until they
figure out what's wrong.

776
01:00:37,831 --> 01:00:41,418
I wanna be with her and
she needs all of this.

777
01:00:42,461 --> 01:00:44,588
- Thank you, Stephen.
- Yeah.

778
01:00:46,048 --> 01:00:48,717
- I appreciate that.
- Excuse us.

779
01:01:18,581 --> 01:01:22,126
We should be looking for
neurological causes here.

780
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:03,959
Susannah!

781
01:02:22,269 --> 01:02:25,814
Hello. Hi.

782
01:02:27,316 --> 01:02:30,027
Don't get too excited.

783
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:32,696
You look great.

784
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:37,201
Brought you some fake flowers.
Am I gonna hug you?

785
01:02:40,788 --> 01:02:44,542
I'm just gonna do it.

786
01:02:47,753 --> 01:02:50,339
Hey, babe.

787
01:02:52,174 --> 01:02:55,469
So what, you don't talk to me now?

788
01:03:05,104 --> 01:03:08,607
I have something for you.

789
01:03:08,691 --> 01:03:11,902
It's very disappointing.

790
01:03:11,986 --> 01:03:15,197
It's a be-sick-crap-ugly card.

791
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:19,493
And everybody made it. In the
office, everybody signed it.

792
01:03:19,577 --> 01:03:21,662
And a lot of people said some really,

793
01:03:21,745 --> 01:03:25,708
really sappy things that you
and I would've made fun of.

794
01:03:25,791 --> 01:03:28,454
Even Richard signed it.

795
01:03:28,454 --> 01:03:30,656
I think he really misses you.

796
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,757
You were like his little apprentice.

797
01:03:35,926 --> 01:03:38,137
And I miss you.

798
01:03:41,557 --> 01:03:45,186
And he misses you. This is..

799
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,689
I'll put this here.

800
01:03:48,772 --> 01:03:51,066
We can make fun of it later.

801
01:04:29,438 --> 01:04:32,942
We tested Susannah for every infectious diseases
that we know of.

802
01:04:33,025 --> 01:04:36,111
All of the results are negative,
inculding Lyme disease,

803
01:04:36,195 --> 01:04:41,534
toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus,
tuberculosis, and many, many more.

804
01:04:41,617 --> 01:04:43,994
All of the test being negative,

805
01:04:44,078 --> 01:04:46,872
suggested that Susannah has a
primary psychotic illness,

806
01:04:46,956 --> 01:04:50,167
which I feel it's likely schizophrenia.

807
01:04:50,251 --> 01:04:52,211
So what does all of this mean?

808
01:04:52,294 --> 01:04:56,590
Maybe, this is not the right hospital
to treat her.

809
01:04:56,674 --> 01:05:01,095
Perhaps, Susannah should be transferred
to a psychiatric hospital.

810
01:05:02,221 --> 01:05:06,267
Okay, look. I'm gonna continue
to monitor Susannah

811
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:08,519
on a daily basis on the next three days.

812
01:05:08,602 --> 01:05:11,480
Let's just hope that something shows up

813
01:05:11,564 --> 01:05:13,868
and we can figure out a way of solving this

814
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,256
and getting your daughter better.

815
01:05:15,256 --> 01:05:16,910
Something?

816
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,364
I, I don't understand this.

817
01:05:20,447 --> 01:05:23,534
Our daughter is dying in there.

818
01:05:23,617 --> 01:05:27,746
The tests are not showing us
that she's dying, Mr. Cahalan.

819
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:31,250
The tests are saying that
she's a healthy young woman.

820
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:34,795
- She's clearly suffering and we are...
- I want answers!

821
01:05:34,879 --> 01:05:37,423
It is your job to give us answers!

822
01:05:37,506 --> 01:05:41,010
This ain't some kids club,
where you get to play doctor!

823
01:05:41,093 --> 01:05:44,889
This is my daughter's life! Her life
is in your hands and I want answers!

824
01:05:44,972 --> 01:05:47,808
Tell me what is wrong with my daughter!

825
01:05:47,892 --> 01:05:50,769
The truth is, Mr. Cahalan, that we don't
know what is wrong with Susannah.

826
01:05:50,853 --> 01:05:53,898
We work and make decisions based on facts,

827
01:05:53,981 --> 01:05:56,066
and at this point, we don't have any.

828
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,986
We're sorry that there's nothing more
that we can do.

829
01:05:59,069 --> 01:06:00,316
Excuse me.

830
01:06:00,316 --> 01:06:05,625
We already have a bed on standby and
we're just waiting for your desicion.

831
01:06:46,951 --> 01:06:49,495
Fully catatonic.

832
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:16,439
Hey.

833
01:07:18,774 --> 01:07:21,610
- You okay?
- Yeah.

834
01:07:25,573 --> 01:07:28,284
So how do holding up?

835
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:30,786
It shouldn't be like this, you know.

836
01:07:32,037 --> 01:07:34,801
I know she's still in there.

837
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,068
She's just trapped.

838
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:40,004
When I look at her eyes, I can
see her screaming to get out.

839
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:43,841
I thought of all people, you doctors,
you know,

840
01:07:43,924 --> 01:07:47,303
you'd be able to give us
some hope, you know.

841
01:07:48,721 --> 01:07:50,890
I mean, that's your job, right?

842
01:07:56,437 --> 01:07:59,356
- I wish you all a fantastic weekend.
- Thank you.

843
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,276
And please praise yourself.

844
01:08:02,359 --> 01:08:05,362
I want to see you in my class next week.

845
01:08:07,865 --> 01:08:10,910
Wow, Dr. Khan.

846
01:08:10,993 --> 01:08:15,080
- To what do I owe you the pleasure?
- I need your help.

847
01:08:15,164 --> 01:08:18,959
I teach now, leave me in peace.

848
01:08:19,043 --> 01:08:22,463
21 year-old female, right-handed.

849
01:08:22,546 --> 01:08:27,092
Her symptoms began with manic behavior,
paranoia, erratic outbursts.

850
01:08:27,176 --> 01:08:31,555
That led to a seizure, which led to
another one, which led to a third.

851
01:08:31,639 --> 01:08:36,352
Her condition continues to regress.
Everyday.

852
01:08:36,435 --> 01:08:40,940
Sabrina, I teach now.

853
01:08:41,023 --> 01:08:44,985
What's crazy is that apart from this,
she was completely crazy.

854
01:08:45,069 --> 01:08:47,446
She was on no medication, whatsoever.

855
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:51,534
Her physical exams were normal.
Her neurological exams were normal.

856
01:08:51,617 --> 01:08:57,164
Infection work out negative, autoimmune test
negative, toxic metabolic workup negative.

857
01:08:57,248 --> 01:09:02,086
- All of it was negative.
- I admit, itt sounds very interesting.

858
01:09:02,169 --> 01:09:04,380
But like I said, I teach now.

859
01:09:04,463 --> 01:09:07,258
She's on the verge on going
to a psychiatric hospital.

860
01:09:07,341 --> 01:09:10,928
Dr. Khan, based on what you were telling
me, maybe that's where she should be.

861
01:09:11,011 --> 01:09:15,599
No. It would be very easy for me to tell
her that she's bipolar or schizophrenic,

862
01:09:15,683 --> 01:09:17,963
but the fact is, there's
just something in my bones

863
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:19,961
that's telling me that,
that's not the case.

864
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:27,236
I knew the feeling. Okay,
I will take a peek.

865
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,933
Great.

866
01:09:30,322 --> 01:09:34,326
I wonder what he'll be like.
Hopefully competent.

867
01:09:38,372 --> 01:09:42,543
- Good day. Hello.
- Hi, I'm Rhona, I'm Susannah's mother.

868
01:09:42,626 --> 01:09:44,151
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, pleasure.

869
01:09:42,526 --> 01:09:45,608
- Tom, I'm her dad.
- Tom.

870
01:09:45,852 --> 01:09:51,552
I'm Dr. Najjar and you must
be the famous Susannah?

871
01:09:53,512 --> 01:09:56,891
Call me Souhel.
Pleasure is all mine.

872
01:09:59,351 --> 01:10:03,564
- So, um, please have a seat.
- Okay.

873
01:10:05,733 --> 01:10:09,528
Susannah, I will do my best to help you.

874
01:10:09,612 --> 01:10:12,990
I will not hurt you and I will never
lie to you.

875
01:10:14,283 --> 01:10:18,537
Okay? Okay. Let's begin.

876
01:10:18,621 --> 01:10:21,165
What is your name?

877
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,088
What is the year?

878
01:10:52,446 --> 01:10:56,617
- We need to stay strong for Susannah.
- I know.

879
01:10:58,619 --> 01:11:01,330
Hey, we'll get through this.

880
01:11:03,082 --> 01:11:05,584
Yeah, I hope so.

881
01:11:06,585 --> 01:11:11,966
Can you touch your nose with this hand?

882
01:11:33,529 --> 01:11:35,531
Very good.

883
01:11:55,509 --> 01:11:59,138
- Stephen?
- What's wrong? Is she okay?

884
01:12:01,724 --> 01:12:04,894
Mr. Cahalan.

885
01:12:04,977 --> 01:12:08,314
You know what, why don't you call me Tom?

886
01:12:08,397 --> 01:12:12,276
After all you've been through, I think
you can call me asshole if you want.

887
01:12:15,362 --> 01:12:17,364
Thanks.

888
01:12:18,574 --> 01:12:21,243
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

889
01:12:21,327 --> 01:12:23,370
Now.

890
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,167
Will you walk for me?

891
01:12:30,336 --> 01:12:32,963
Get out of the bed.

892
01:12:35,549 --> 01:12:39,345
No, no.

893
01:12:39,428 --> 01:12:41,764
She can do it herself.

894
01:12:43,432 --> 01:12:47,102
I need you to walk for me in straight line.

895
01:12:47,186 --> 01:12:49,730
One foot in front of the other.

896
01:12:56,237 --> 01:12:58,531
Okay, okay.

897
01:13:01,242 --> 01:13:05,284
- All looks clear.
- It is. It's perfectly clear.

898
01:13:05,356 --> 01:13:07,698
What am I missing?

899
01:13:18,884 --> 01:13:22,096
Susannah? Would you draw a clock for me?

900
01:13:22,179 --> 01:13:25,975
And fill in all the numbers,
from one to twelve.

901
01:13:37,027 --> 01:13:39,280
Just as you remember.

902
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:44,952
Very good.

903
01:13:49,164 --> 01:13:54,295
Now, fill in the numbers. One through 12.

904
01:14:09,852 --> 01:14:13,105
Dr. Najjar, what do you see?

905
01:14:19,778 --> 01:14:24,158
I might be late tonight. No,
everything is fine. Yes.

906
01:15:08,118 --> 01:15:10,788
Dr. Ryan, it's Souhel.

907
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:17,753
Yes, yes, but I think I have something
you might be interested in.

908
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:25,219
- Good morning. How are you feeling?
- Hello.

909
01:15:25,302 --> 01:15:27,429
I may have some explanation for you.

910
01:15:27,513 --> 01:15:32,726
I believe the right hemisphere of her
brain is seriously impaired and inflamed.

911
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:35,976
In a broken brain, when one hemisphere
is not working,

912
01:15:35,976 --> 01:15:38,532
the visual world becomes loop-sided.

913
01:15:40,526 --> 01:15:41,710
Like this clock.

914
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:45,221
No one with psychiatric problem
would draw clock like this.

915
01:15:45,489 --> 01:15:49,410
So at least, you don't suffer
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

916
01:15:50,953 --> 01:15:54,206
Now, what is causing this inflammation

917
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:57,042
that is the question
that we have to answer.

918
01:15:59,503 --> 01:16:03,257
My dear, I know you're in there.

919
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:06,719
I'm going to everything I can to find you.

920
01:16:06,802 --> 01:16:11,181
Before we move on to treatment, we need
to confirm the cause of the inflammation.

921
01:16:11,265 --> 01:16:14,226
I think the best thing to do is
to do a brain biopsy.

922
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:18,147
- What does that mean?
- We have to look at her brain.

923
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:22,112
We have to take a small piece of her
brain to confirm the diagnosis,

924
01:16:22,112 --> 01:16:24,250
before we can proceed with the treatment.

925
01:16:24,278 --> 01:16:29,241
- I don't know.
- Mr. Cahalan, I promise you

926
01:16:29,325 --> 01:16:33,509
if she were my child, I would do
the brain biopsy.

927
01:16:33,509 --> 01:16:35,181
Time is up..

928
01:16:35,289 --> 01:16:38,250
I knew it sounds invasive,
but we are losing her.

929
01:16:42,421 --> 01:16:46,130
We're gonna shave the front part
of your head about four-inches,

930
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:47,130
and toward the crown.

931
01:16:47,593 --> 01:16:50,033
Then we'll make an incision
and take the sample.

932
01:16:50,033 --> 01:16:51,489
I'll be here for you in the morning.

933
01:16:51,513 --> 01:16:54,576
7:00. Please, get some rest tonight

934
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:57,367
and no eating, only fasting.

935
01:16:57,367 --> 01:16:58,607
Thank you.

936
01:17:05,903 --> 01:17:07,299
You okay?

937
01:17:07,299 --> 01:17:09,443
I just don't wanna see our hopes up again.

938
01:17:09,443 --> 01:17:11,584
- What do you mean?
- Rhona, we've been here for over a month,

939
01:17:11,684 --> 01:17:14,511
we've had so many doctors, so
many opinions, so many series,

940
01:17:14,536 --> 01:17:17,246
so many ups and helps, unfortunately
all have major downs.

941
01:17:17,246 --> 01:17:20,167
- Who says this guy has all the answers?
- Okay, look at me.

942
01:17:21,585 --> 01:17:24,264
If this guy doesn't have the
answers, we will go to the

943
01:17:24,289 --> 01:17:26,823
next guy or the next woman
until we find the answer.

944
01:17:26,882 --> 01:17:30,263
Okay, but I need from you,
right here, right now,

945
01:17:30,263 --> 01:17:33,200
is I need to know, are you in?

946
01:17:34,181 --> 01:17:38,018
Because I need you and Susannah needs you.

947
01:18:12,011 --> 01:18:14,763
Good afternoon. I have some news.

948
01:18:14,847 --> 01:18:18,726
The result came back conclusive
for NMDA receptor antibodies.

949
01:18:18,809 --> 01:18:22,771
- What is it?
- Anti NMDA receptor encephalitis

950
01:18:22,855 --> 01:18:25,733
is an autoimmune disease where antibodies

951
01:18:25,816 --> 01:18:28,944
target and attack very important
receptors in the brain.

952
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:34,742
I don't understand. Can you simplify
what you were saying?

953
01:18:34,825 --> 01:18:40,706
To put it simply, her brain is on fire
and under attack from her own body.

954
01:18:41,707 --> 01:18:46,629
Okay, so what happens next?

955
01:18:46,712 --> 01:18:48,523
We can treat this.

956
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,734
We got this in the very early stages.

957
01:18:50,734 --> 01:18:53,797
I think she will be fine.
She will be getting 90%

958
01:18:53,797 --> 01:18:56,663
of her cognitive abilities back.

959
01:18:56,722 --> 01:19:00,309
So, we may get her fully back.

960
01:19:00,392 --> 01:19:02,603
As I said, Mr. Cahalan

961
01:19:02,686 --> 01:19:05,314
there's a serious possibility, but

962
01:19:05,397 --> 01:19:08,484
let's just hope that her body
welcomes the treatment.

963
01:19:10,945 --> 01:19:13,697
Thank you so much.

964
01:19:18,244 --> 01:19:20,538
You are going to be just fine.

965
01:19:21,872 --> 01:19:24,041
I found you.

966
01:19:26,418 --> 01:19:27,974
<i>I'm the lucky one.</i>

967
01:19:27,974 --> 01:19:31,292
<i>Because in the system that's
designed to miss people like me.</i>

968
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:34,009
- I'll start the treatment.
- Thank you.

969
01:19:34,093 --> 01:19:37,054
<i>Thanks to Dr. Najjar, I was found.</i>

970
01:19:37,137 --> 01:19:39,265
<i>He found me.</i>

971
01:19:44,103 --> 01:19:46,985
<i>My body was attacking my brain.</i>

972
01:19:46,985 --> 01:19:48,838
- You good?
- Yeah.

973
01:19:48,838 --> 01:19:51,819
<i>It completely destroyed my ability to function.</i>

974
01:19:54,905 --> 01:19:58,117
<i>How many people, do you think
throughout history were diagnosed</i>

975
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,452
<i>as schizophrenic, psychotic, bipolar,</i>

976
01:20:00,536 --> 01:20:03,289
<i>or maybe just being crazy,</i>

977
01:20:03,372 --> 01:20:06,584
<i>when they had something that
could've been so easily diagnosed?</i>

978
01:20:06,667 --> 01:20:08,752
It took me forever to get home.

979
01:20:09,879 --> 01:20:11,922
I broght you this.

980
01:20:15,843 --> 01:20:19,305
I love you so much.

981
01:20:21,015 --> 01:20:24,351
Susannah, you can't stay in bed all day.

982
01:20:24,435 --> 01:20:30,024
Oh, my God. We had a plan.
Let's go.

983
01:20:31,025 --> 01:20:36,071
- No, no, no.
- We're going.

984
01:20:36,155 --> 01:20:39,325
You know what, if we're gonna make
it to the New York city marathon,

985
01:20:39,408 --> 01:20:41,619
we got a hell lot of work to do, kid.

986
01:20:44,788 --> 01:20:46,999
Please, don't quit your job.

987
01:20:47,082 --> 01:20:50,252
Because you're definitely not a comedian.

988
01:20:50,336 --> 01:20:52,755
Well, it's nice to see you
got your personality back.

989
01:20:52,838 --> 01:20:54,185
Come on, baby. You can do it.

990
01:20:54,185 --> 01:20:56,651
<i>I had to learn everything from scratch.</i>

991
01:20:56,926 --> 01:20:59,968
<i>How to walk again. How to talk again.</i>

992
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:01,068
<i>Smile</i>

993
01:21:01,764 --> 01:21:03,974
<i>How to be a daughter.</i>

994
01:21:04,058 --> 01:21:06,393
<i>To love Stephen again.</i>

995
01:21:06,477 --> 01:21:08,896
<i>How to write.</i>

996
01:21:08,979 --> 01:21:11,357
<i>I had to learn how to exist again.</i>

997
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:17,388
- So how the hell are you?
- I'm good. Yeah.

998
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:20,998
Yeah, you know I'm on some
medications still, but,

999
01:21:20,998 --> 01:21:21,998
but I'm good.

1000
01:21:22,743 --> 01:21:25,329
I read your first article
since you returned.

1001
01:21:25,412 --> 01:21:27,998
- Dont, it's not too good.
- No, no, no.

1002
01:21:28,082 --> 01:21:30,417
Don't put words in my mouth,
this is actually really good.

1003
01:21:30,543 --> 01:21:35,548
Yeah, better than ever, so much, so that
congratulations, your first page, too.

1004
01:21:37,633 --> 01:21:39,786
- Wow.
- Yeah, big deal, right?

1005
01:21:39,786 --> 01:21:41,049
Yeah, thank you.

1006
01:21:41,845 --> 01:21:44,974
There's something else I want from you.

1007
01:21:45,057 --> 01:21:48,936
I want you to tell your story,
from beginning to end.

1008
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:53,774
I want the people of New York
to know what you went through.

1009
01:21:55,234 --> 01:21:58,529
I want you to write a first
person-feature about.

1010
01:21:58,612 --> 01:22:01,084
Kinda hard putting you
on personal information,

1011
01:22:01,109 --> 01:22:02,911
but you should
really consider it.

1012
01:22:04,994 --> 01:22:10,749
You know? Why not?

1013
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:12,751
Yeah?

1014
01:22:12,835 --> 01:22:16,672
Yeah, I mean if it, if it
helps someone ou there, maybe

1015
01:22:16,755 --> 01:22:20,467
- it's worth it.
- Yeah, that's great.

1016
01:22:20,551 --> 01:22:23,554
It'll take a little bit time to compile it,
I think, but..

1017
01:22:23,637 --> 01:22:26,307
Yeah, I know. Take all the time you need.

1018
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:28,767
As long as I can have it on Friday.

1019
01:22:30,436 --> 01:22:33,689
You'll have by Thursday night. Don't worry.

1020
01:22:35,858 --> 01:22:37,902
Thanks, Susannah.

1021
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:56,921
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1022
01:22:58,339 --> 01:23:02,468
<i>I got used to people asking me about
my rare and fascinating illness.</i>

1023
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:05,596
<i>- I never try to articulate it, though.</i>
- Are you sure you're okay?

1024
01:23:07,723 --> 01:23:09,196
- Margo?
- Yeah?

1025
01:23:09,196 --> 01:23:10,495
- I'm great.
- Sorry.

1026
01:23:10,495 --> 01:23:11,705
- Never bother.
- Okay.

1027
01:23:11,705 --> 01:23:14,688
Good. Now stop talking to me.

1028
01:23:14,772 --> 01:23:19,151
<i>This new Susannah is a lot like
the old Susannah,</i>

1029
01:23:19,235 --> 01:23:21,612
<i>but she's so much stronger.</i>

1030
01:23:21,695 --> 01:23:23,739
<i>Because for very first time,</i>

1031
01:23:23,822 --> 01:23:27,243
<i>I feel ready to tackle the mystery
of what happened to me.</i>

1032
01:23:27,326 --> 01:23:29,662
<i>To find an answer.</i>

1033
01:23:29,745 --> 01:23:32,957
<i>An answer that could possibly save a life.</i>
