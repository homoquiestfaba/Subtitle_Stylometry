my professor says two things--

00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:23,511
first, from this day forward...

4
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:26,079

loves you, get a second opinion.

go to a whorehouse.

go to court.

JACK: Let's say
you know a client's guilty.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,590
MARTIN:
Don't even start with that.

11
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:40,331
Our justice system doesn't care,
and neither do I.

12
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:43,306
Every defendant,
regardless of what he's done...

13

to the best defense possible.

are there to mean it?

18

21

Actually, you're right.

22
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:06,058
There's only one that matters--
my version of it...

23
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:09,760
the one I create
in the minds of the jury.

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,430
You can call it something else--
the illusion of truth...

25
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:15,962
if you want.

26

I just--I have...

355
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:58,694
Spells. Sp--I have spells.

356
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:01,131
I lose time. I can't...

357
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,328
I can't remember nothing.

358
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:12,369
Why did you run from the police
if you did nothing wrong?

359
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:15,110
Well, when...

360
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:19,607
When I woke up, I was--
I was covered in blood.

361
00:23:19,652 --> 00:23:23,713
I didn't know what to do.
I got scared.

362
00:23:23,756 --> 00:23:25,587
I heard sirens, so I ran.

363
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,992
I know how it looks,
but I swear--

364
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:32,725
I don't need you to convince me.
Just answer my questions.

365
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:35,495
But I didn't do this.
You gotta believe me.

366
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:37,729
MARTIN: I don't have
to believe you. I don't care.

367
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,864
I'm your attorney,
which means I am your mother...

368
00:23:40,906 --> 00:23:44,808
father, best friend, and priest.

369
00:23:46,312 --> 00:23:49,076
In other words,
talk only to me from now on.

370
00:23:49,115 --> 00:23:51,913
Not the cops, press,
other guys in the cells...

371
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:55,045
nobody without my permission,
understand?

372
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:57,055
Yeah?

373
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:58,579
Yes, I do.

374
00:23:58,624 --> 00:24:00,057
MARTIN: All right.

375
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:02,959
Now the important stuff.
What's your suit size?

376
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:06,128
My--my what?

377
00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:08,725
Suit size. About a 38?

378
00:24:09,368 --> 00:24:10,528
Uh...

379
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:15,974
How would I know?
I don't know.

380
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:17,566
About a 38-long.

381
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,044
TV: Stampler was flushed
by the police...

382
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,674
from his hiding place
behind the cathedral.

383
00:24:23,716 --> 00:24:26,651
The police chased him
through the train yard...

384
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:29,621
almost losing him
as he scrambled over tracks...

385
00:24:29,655 --> 00:24:32,590
before an oncoming train,
separating him from the police.

386
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:36,152
Prominent local criminal
defense attorney Martin Vail...

387
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:39,164
is believed to have
visited Stampler--

388
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:41,325
After a brief chase
across the rail yard...

389
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:43,164
behind Saint Michael's
Cathedral...

390
00:24:43,202 --> 00:24:46,660
Stampler was apprehended
in a hole beneath train tracks.

391
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:48,264
REPORTER:
Are you defending this man?

392
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:50,434
MARTIN: I'm sorry. I can't--

393
00:24:50,476 --> 00:24:52,910
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

394
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:54,435
Thank you very much.

395
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,243
We've taken the first step
in the process.

396
00:24:56,282 --> 00:24:58,273
I can now take your questions.

397
00:24:58,317 --> 00:25:01,684
MAN: Can you tell us anything
about the altar boy group...

398
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:03,450
that Aaron Stampler was part of?

399
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:04,717
JOHN: Not much at this time.

400
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:07,885
WOMAN:
Do you suspect other altar boys?

401
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:10,395
JOHN:
We suspect no one but Stampler.

402
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:12,693
He had access
to the archbishop's quarters.

403
00:25:12,732 --> 00:25:15,132
He was caught
fleeing Saint Michael's.

404
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:18,432
Aaron Stampler was chased
under McCormick place.

405
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:20,302
[Telephone rings]

406
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:22,170
NAOMl:
Law office of Martin Vail.

407
00:25:23,442 --> 00:25:25,603
He'll call as soon
as he gets in.

408
00:25:25,644 --> 00:25:27,441
I talked to him. OK. Bye.

409
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,243
-Naomi!
-Yeah.

410
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:31,408
MARTIN: Sorry I'm late.
We have a new client.

411
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,315
NAOMl:
I was afraid you'd say that.

412
00:25:33,352 --> 00:25:35,115
Who?

413
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:38,988
They're calling him
the butcher boy of Saint Mike's.

414
00:25:39,024 --> 00:25:40,184
MARTIN: I like that.

415
00:25:40,226 --> 00:25:41,659
NAOMl:
Good. You'll hear it a lot.

416
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:43,787
TOMMY: This kid who chopped up
the archbishop?

417
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:47,560
MARTIN: Tommy, you've got
to use the word "allegedly"...

418
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,899
especially if you
want to be a lawyer.

419
00:25:50,936 --> 00:25:54,531
He admits he was in the room
when the killing occurred...

420
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:57,371
but he didn't actually
see it happen.

421
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:00,469
He was returning a book
to the archbishop.

422
00:26:00,513 --> 00:26:02,845
He heard loud noises
in the bedroom.

423
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:05,316
He went in.
He sees a figure...

424
00:26:05,351 --> 00:26:07,979
someone in the shadows
kneeling over the body.

425
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,784
He blacks out.
Next thing he knows...

426
00:26:10,823 --> 00:26:13,314
sirens are screaming,
he's covered in blood.

427
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,293
The cops find him
in a train tunnel.

428
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:17,761
He's got the archbishop's ring
in his pocket.

429
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:19,094
TOMMY: He stole it?

430
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:21,065
I didn't say that.
It was in his pocket.

431
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:27,599
Is that it?

432
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:30,568
Yup.

433
00:26:32,745 --> 00:26:36,613
That's, um...
That's bullshit.

434
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:39,618
That's the worst bullshit story
I've ever heard.

435
00:26:39,652 --> 00:26:42,052
Now it's our bullshit story.

436
00:26:42,087 --> 00:26:43,748
Let's get to work.

437
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,690
The name of the game
is motive...

438
00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:49,023
as in, the prosecution
doesn't have one.

439
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:51,495
We need to prove...

440
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,760
someone else could have
committed the crime...

441
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,562
then we can establish
reasonable doubt.

442
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:58,798
I wanna know everything
I can about this guy.

443
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:02,433
We go to database,
Hall of Records, IRS files...

444
00:27:02,474 --> 00:27:04,066
even his so-called charities.

445
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:06,600
So-called?
The guy was a priest.

446
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,473
Naomi, write this down--

447
00:27:10,516 --> 00:27:13,178
B32.156.

448
00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:15,483
That was carved
into the archbishop's chest.

449
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:17,148
-Allegedly.
-No.

450
00:27:17,189 --> 00:27:19,749
That was a fact,
but I appreciate the effort.

451
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:20,952
Thanks.

452
00:27:20,993 --> 00:27:23,461
I also need case histories
on murder by stabbing...

453
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:26,259
murder by mutilation,
murder by religion.

454
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:28,198
Also, I'm gonna need
a psychiatrist.

455
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:29,565
NAOMl: You're telling me.

456
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:31,900
MARTIN: Not the kind
that lives in a witness box.

457
00:27:31,937 --> 00:27:33,370
I need a real one.

458
00:27:33,405 --> 00:27:34,667
And someone who knows
about amnesia.

459
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:37,198
What does he look like
in person?

460
00:27:37,243 --> 00:27:38,733
The butcher boy?

461
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,907
Like a boy scout.

462
00:27:42,948 --> 00:27:48,284
A boy scout...
with a merit badge in carving.

463
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,949
YANCY: The archbishop was
a friend of Mr. Shaughnessy's.

464
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:54,824
He asked me who was my best man.

465
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,259
I said you.

466
00:27:56,295 --> 00:27:57,421
JANET: Thank you.

467
00:27:57,463 --> 00:28:00,489
I trust if I am
to prosecute this case...

468
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:03,990
I'll be given the authority
requisite to this assignment.

469
00:28:04,036 --> 00:28:06,527
JOHN:
You're the one trying the case.

470
00:28:06,572 --> 00:28:08,665
Let's establish
one thing at the outset.

471
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:10,197
I want the death penalty.

472
00:28:11,944 --> 00:28:13,912
JANET:
I'd like to go over the case...

473
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:16,642
before we make a determination
about the death penalty.

474
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:18,616
JOHN:
I'm open to anything you say...

475
00:28:18,651 --> 00:28:20,619
but in my mind,
there's no debate.

476
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:25,194
Did he say anything,
the boy they picked up?

477
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:28,397
Yeah--he didn't do it.

478
00:28:28,397 --> 00:28:30,763
YANCY: It's a slam dunk, Janet.

479
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,734
JANET: Excuse me.
I appreciate your faith in me...

480
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:35,634
and I don't mean to be
argumentative--

481
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:37,434
YANCY:
That's what we pay you for.

482
00:28:37,473 --> 00:28:39,737
If it's so open and shut,
you don't need me.

483
00:28:39,775 --> 00:28:44,007
The P.D. will plead no contest
and seek the court's mercy.

484
00:28:44,046 --> 00:28:46,981
There's not a public defender.

485
00:28:47,015 --> 00:28:49,506
He's got a lawyer?

486
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:51,382
Already? Who?

487
00:28:55,157 --> 00:28:57,387
I'm Martin Vail.

488
00:28:57,426 --> 00:29:00,122
I'm defending Aaron Stampler.

489
00:29:00,162 --> 00:29:01,959
I need to inspect
the murder site.

490
00:29:01,997 --> 00:29:04,557
The butcher boy, huh?

491
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,794
Thank you. Yes.

492
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:07,495
I forgot his real name.

493
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:16,641
JANET: What's the matter,
Marty, lost your faith?

494
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:19,280
Looking for a little religion?

495
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:23,148
Which one of us
is the true headline chaser?

496
00:29:23,185 --> 00:29:25,847
Unlike you,
I was assigned to this case.

497
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,480
Think you're up to it?

498
00:29:27,523 --> 00:29:30,253

or are you waiting?

00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:31,850
Want to see some pictures?

500
00:29:34,963 --> 00:29:37,158
Come on.
They're kind of cute.

501
00:29:42,137 --> 00:29:46,039
You'll agree they clearly show
the heinous nature of the crime.

502
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:51,874
MARTIN:
A small piece of advice--

503
00:29:51,914 --> 00:29:54,348
don't use the word
"heinous" in court.

504
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:56,681
Half the jury
won't understand it.

505
00:29:56,718 --> 00:29:58,345
One small piece of advice--

506
00:29:58,387 --> 00:30:00,878
I'm not sitting second chair
to you anymore.

507
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:03,551
In case you hadn't noticed,
I graduated.

508
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:08,793
I had no reason to leave.

509
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:11,231
You had every reason to leave.

510
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:12,528
How can you still work for them?

511
00:30:12,568 --> 00:30:16,026
You really expect me
to trot out after you, Marty?

512
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:18,539
Quit just because you did?

513
00:30:18,574 --> 00:30:21,236
I don't need a Mercedes.

514
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:24,143
I don't need to see my face
on the evening news.

515
00:30:29,585 --> 00:30:32,679
You knew I was coming here,
didn't you?

516
00:30:32,721 --> 00:30:36,555
You knew I would defend him.
You asked Shaughnessy for this.

517
00:30:36,592 --> 00:30:38,822
Oh, please...

518
00:30:39,928 --> 00:30:42,897
What's the matter, you nervous?

519
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:46,367
Been a while since you rubbed up
against a woman with a brain?

520
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:53,472
What's the matter? You tired,
haven't been sleeping well?

521
00:30:53,508 --> 00:30:55,908
You're the one
with the score to settle.

522
00:30:55,944 --> 00:30:57,343
I sleep great at night.

00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,748
MARTIN: Hey. Where is he?

527
00:32:10,786 --> 00:32:11,946
OFFICER: Over here.

528
00:32:31,073 --> 00:32:34,236
MARTIN: We'll be sitting
at a table with my associates.

529
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:37,905
Once the charges are read,
the judge'll ask how you plead.

530
00:32:37,946 --> 00:32:40,380
-Not--not guilty.
-No.

531
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:42,383
But I'm not guilty, Mr. Vail.

532
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:43,850
MARTIN: It doesn't matter.

533
00:32:43,885 --> 00:32:45,876
Keep your mouth shut.
Don't say anything.

534
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:47,889
AARON: You're going to say
I'm not guilty?

535
00:32:47,923 --> 00:32:49,754
I'll say whatever I say.
Don't worry.

536
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,622
But, Mr. Vail--

537
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,823
This can't go on in court,
so get used to it now.

538
00:32:54,863 --> 00:32:57,661
I speak. You do not speak.

539
00:32:57,699 --> 00:32:59,826
Your job is to sit there
and look innocent.

540
00:32:59,868 --> 00:33:01,460
I am innocent.

541
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:04,698
That's it! That's exactly
how you should look.

542
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,709
That's exactly it.
Can you remember that?

543
00:33:07,743 --> 00:33:09,005
That's the look.

544
00:33:09,044 --> 00:33:12,138
AARON:
This is how I always look.

545
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,114
MARTIN: Then you're way ahead
of the game already.

546
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:17,145
Don't smile.

547
00:33:19,588 --> 00:33:21,055
Don't...

548

[Reporters shouting questions]

549
00:33:30,265 --> 00:33:31,755
WOMAN: Can we have a statement?

550
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,030
MARTIN: No. We're gonna
find out what happened.

551
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:35,559
MAN:
What about public pressure?

552
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:37,299
MARTIN: The only pressure
is to find the truth.

553
00:33:37,339 --> 00:33:38,772
MAN: Was the archbishop's
blood on him?

554
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:40,832
MARTIN: You've been
talking to the police.

555
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:42,605
They usually
get everything wrong.

556
00:33:42,644 --> 00:33:46,080
WOMAN: How do you explain
his blood-soaked clothing?

557
00:33:46,114 --> 00:33:47,581
MARTIN: Currently,
I'm not explaining anything.

558
00:33:47,616 --> 00:33:49,914
I've only recently
been retained.

559
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:54,047
Significant facts are in dispute
and continue to be in dispute.

560
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:57,786
MAN: You're a master at putting
the victim on trial.

561
00:33:57,826 --> 00:33:59,817
That will be difficult
in this case.

562
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:02,796
MARTIN: A victim is my client.

563
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:06,597
We have two victims here,
no suspects. Thank you.

564
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:08,728
Thank you.

565
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:27,112

any question about the verdict.

BAILIFF:
State vs. Aaron Stampler.

570
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:46,169
Sit down. Is everyone here?

571
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,869
BAILIFF: Yes, Your Honor.

572
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,536
JUDGE: Madam prosecutor?

573
00:34:49,578 --> 00:34:54,777
The state charges Aaron Stampler
with murder in the first degree.

574
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:56,716
How does your client plead,
counselor?

575
00:34:56,751 --> 00:35:00,915
I need time to make a complete
psychiatric evaluation...

576
00:35:00,956 --> 00:35:02,548
before any charges are brought.

577
00:35:02,591 --> 00:35:04,718
JANET: We have more than enough
evidence for the allegations.

578
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,249
I agree. Motion denied.

579
00:35:06,962 --> 00:35:08,623
Mr. Stampler...

580
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:11,664
do you understand the charges?

581
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,497
AARON: Yes.

582
00:35:13,535 --> 00:35:15,503
I direct my client
not to answer...

583
00:35:15,537 --> 00:35:18,529
because his response
may tend to incriminate him.

584
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:21,599
He's taking the fifth on whether
he understands the charges?

585
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:23,044
Yes, Your Honor.

586
00:35:23,044 --> 00:35:24,943
Until a psychological
evaluation...

587
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:28,646
he'll be taking the fifth
on all questions posed.

588
00:35:28,646 --> 00:35:32,980
The State vs. Appleby...
if you'll review our precedent.

589

00:35:51,202 --> 00:35:54,501
Nah, I can't do that. Nah.

TOMMY: I'm looking for the room
Aaron Stampler stayed in.

593

You the police?

594
00:36:06,651 --> 00:36:08,175

Aah!

MARTIN: Thanks.

600

AARON: Well, hey.

601
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:25,991
This--this is Alex's.

602
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,691
Who's Alex?

603
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:30,360
He's one
of the other altar boys.

604
00:37:30,401 --> 00:37:31,868
An altar boy?

605
00:37:31,903 --> 00:37:34,599
An altar boy was wearing this?

606
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:37,540
Well, not--not at Mass.

607
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,478
MARTIN: This altar boy attacked
a colleague of mine.

608
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:43,241
He hurt him pretty bad.

609
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:49,611
What was he doing in your room?

610
00:37:49,654 --> 00:37:51,315
-My room?
-Yeah.

611
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:57,425
I--I can't...
I can't--I don't know.

612
00:37:57,462 --> 00:37:58,690
I mean, I don't.

613
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,721

AARON: Who? Alex?

615
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,495
Uh-huh.

616
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,696
AARON:
I don't know where he is.

617
00:38:08,406 --> 00:38:09,805
Who's Linda?

618
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:11,706
Lin-Linda?

619

Where is she?
I'd like to talk to her.

621

AARON:
I don't know where she is.

622
00:38:30,662 --> 00:38:33,460
Why do I feel you're not
telling me something?

623
00:38:33,498 --> 00:38:34,795
AARON: I'm telling the truth.

624
00:38:34,832 --> 00:38:36,163
I don't think so.

625
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,899
Are you surprised that Alex
attacked my friend?

626
00:38:40,938 --> 00:38:43,998
No.
No, I mean, he has a temper.

627
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:45,839
Yeah. I'd say so.

628
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:50,239
You think it could be Alex...

629

who was that figure you saw
at the archbishop's room?

I couldn't be sure.

631

But it could be him?

632
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,517
I don't--I don't know.

633
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,585
The state wants you dead.

I'm trying.
I can't--can't remember.

00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:17,901
I don't understand.
Why would Alex do such a thing?

638
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:19,432
For his own reasons.

639
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:21,172
Maybe someone hired him.

640
00:39:22,814 --> 00:39:24,111
H-hired by who?

641
00:39:24,148 --> 00:39:26,616
I don't know.
Forget the whole thing.

642
00:39:28,986 --> 00:39:31,819
Do you think he's capable
of doing it?

643
00:39:31,856 --> 00:39:33,983
I--I don't know. He...

644
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,857
I don't know
who's capable of such a thing.

645
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:46,162
MARTIN: Oh, thanks.

646
00:39:46,204 --> 00:39:47,364
ARRINGTON: Sure.

647
00:39:48,406 --> 00:39:50,670
He claims someone else
was in the room...

648
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,767
and that he can't remember.

649
00:39:53,978 --> 00:39:56,538
You want me to look into
this amnesia question...

650
00:39:56,581 --> 00:39:58,014
and see what he actually knows?

651
00:39:58,049 --> 00:39:59,175
Yeah.

652
00:39:59,217 --> 00:40:00,616
What if he knows he did it?

653
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:03,980
The major causes
of amnesia are...

654
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:08,014
substance abuse, seizures,
head injuries, and malingering.

655
00:40:10,862 --> 00:40:14,195
I think the kid's
telling the truth.

656
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,628
OK.

657
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:19,295
Then let's get
something straight.

658
00:40:20,071 --> 00:40:22,665
I'm more than happy
to analyze him.

659
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:24,971
In fact,
I'm looking forward to it.

660
00:40:25,009 --> 00:40:28,467
But I won't just validate
a story, understood?

661
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,640
You do your job, I do mine.
Yadda, yadda.

662
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:32,239
ARRINGTON: That's right.

663
00:40:32,283 --> 00:40:34,274
If I think it's necessary...

664
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:37,754
I'd want to get an MRl, EEG,
and neuropsych testing, agreed?

665
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:40,349
MARTIN: Yes, Doctor.
Good night, Doctor.

666
00:40:46,898 --> 00:40:49,458
ARRINGTON: I'll be recording
our meetings for Mr. Vail...

667
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,866
so what we talk about
isn't as confidential...

668
00:40:51,903 --> 00:40:55,339
as if you were consulting
with a doctor for help.

669
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:56,897
He may call me as a witness...

670
00:40:56,941 --> 00:41:01,139
so if you have questions,
ask while he's here.

671
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:03,977
N-no. No, ma'am.
I understand.

672
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:05,312
Good.

673
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:09,012
I think we'll be fine.

674
00:41:09,053 --> 00:41:11,419
-See you later.
-OK.

675
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:12,683
Bye.

676
00:41:20,698 --> 00:41:23,223
ARRINGTON:
Was there a period of time...

677
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:24,825
surrounding
the archbishop's death...

678
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:27,167
that you don't remember?

679
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:31,505
AARON: Yeah--yes.
I lo--Iost the time.

680
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:35,171
I mean--I mean,
I b-blacked out.

681
00:41:35,213 --> 00:41:37,681
Have you had these
blackouts before?

682
00:41:37,715 --> 00:41:39,512
AARON: Yes. Yes, I have.

683
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,780
When's the first time
you remember them happening?

684
00:41:42,954 --> 00:41:44,114
Um...

685
00:41:45,456 --> 00:41:49,859
They st-st-started
when I was about 12.

686
00:41:49,894 --> 00:41:52,624
Were your parents aware
of what was happening?

687
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:54,028
N-no. No.

688
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:59,025
My--my...my mother was dead.

689
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,503
ARRINGTON: And your father?

690
00:42:02,673 --> 00:42:04,971
Mm-mmm. No. No. No.

691
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:07,978
He was not--not a nice man.

692
00:42:08,012 --> 00:42:09,604
Did you seek treatment?

693
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:11,444
Did I what?

694
00:42:11,482 --> 00:42:14,042
Uh, did you see a doctor
for them?

695
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:15,245
Oh.

696
00:42:17,188 --> 00:42:18,416
No. No.

697
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:21,002
You don't see a doctor
in Creekside...

698
00:42:21,002 --> 00:42:21,934
You don't see a doctor
in Creekside...

699
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:23,834
unless your leg's broke.

00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:34,645
MARTIN:
Hey. Can I talk to you?

702
00:42:34,682 --> 00:42:35,979
JANET: Talk.

703
00:42:36,017 --> 00:42:38,884
MARTIN: Excuse us.
I'll bring her right back.

704
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,285
JANET: How dare you.

705
00:42:40,321 --> 00:42:42,949
Am I some chess piece
to move around?

706
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,389
I was having lunch.

707
00:42:44,425 --> 00:42:47,292
When are we getting
all the discovery?

708
00:42:47,328 --> 00:42:48,795
What do you want, Marty?

709
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:50,490
MARTIN: To know when
we're getting discovery.

710
00:42:50,531 --> 00:42:51,964
I've got motions to file.

711
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:54,490
JANET: No, you don't.
You're looking to make a deal.

712
00:42:56,904 --> 00:42:58,337
I have no authority to deal.

713
00:42:58,372 --> 00:43:00,932
I haven't discussed this
with my client.

714
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:05,207
If we needed to deal,
I have all the authority I want.

715
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:08,443
Bullshit. Shaughnessy
wants the whole shot...

716
00:43:08,482 --> 00:43:10,382
and he's using you to get it.

717
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:12,045
Anybody in your position
would deal this down...

718
00:43:12,086 --> 00:43:13,417
to murder with no death penalty.

719
00:43:13,454 --> 00:43:14,716
My position?

720
00:43:14,755 --> 00:43:17,246
We have a fucking great case.

721
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:19,259
Great case?

722
00:43:19,293 --> 00:43:21,761
Lack of prior record,
no eyewitness...

723
00:43:21,796 --> 00:43:23,423
no confession, no motive.

724
00:43:23,464 --> 00:43:24,692
Hard evidence.

725
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:28,433
I assume this means you're not
going with insanity...

726
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:29,766
which is a shame.

727
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:32,602
My shrinks
would have torn him apart.

728
00:43:33,641 --> 00:43:36,235
By the way, pleading the fifth
on the charges was brilliant.

729
00:43:36,277 --> 00:43:38,507
-It was good, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

730
00:43:38,546 --> 00:43:39,774
I liked it.

731
00:43:40,648 --> 00:43:42,673
You lose this case...

732
00:43:42,717 --> 00:43:45,151
you take the fall,
not Shaughnessy.

733
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:47,914
Talk to me.

734
00:43:49,156 --> 00:43:50,453
JANET: We're going to trial.

735
00:43:52,226 --> 00:43:54,490
It only takes one...

736
00:43:54,528 --> 00:43:57,088
just one juror
that doesn't believe he did it.

737
00:43:57,131 --> 00:43:59,599
One juror looks into that face--

738
00:43:59,634 --> 00:44:01,693
I got to admit,
that face is great.

739
00:44:01,736 --> 00:44:03,397
Are you prepping him
to take the stand?

740
00:44:03,437 --> 00:44:05,928
That stutter--
it's p-p-priceless.

741
00:44:08,943 --> 00:44:11,002
Oh, Marty...

742
00:44:11,045 --> 00:44:13,912
don't tell me you think
he didn't do it.

743
00:44:13,948 --> 00:44:17,076
Has little Aaron Stampler
gotten to you?

744
00:44:17,118 --> 00:44:19,484
We're not just talking jail.

745
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,613
It's about ending
someone's life.

746
00:44:21,656 --> 00:44:23,715
If you're wrong
and do this for Shaughnessy...

747
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:25,020
can you live with it?

748
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:26,424
I'll live.

749
00:44:29,463 --> 00:44:31,954
See you in court.

750
00:44:34,301 --> 00:44:37,202
MARTIN: We stipulate
that murder was done here.

751
00:44:37,238 --> 00:44:39,866
Therefore, these photographs
have no probative value.

752
00:44:39,907 --> 00:44:42,876
JANET: This is a case
of mutilation and torture.

753
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,377
The only reason
the prosecution...

754
00:44:44,412 --> 00:44:46,437
wants to show these pictures
is shock appeal.

755
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,072
JANET: That's not true.

756
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:50,675
They identify the heinous
nature of the crime...

757
00:44:50,718 --> 00:44:54,848
and they connect the defendant
to the crime scene.

758
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:56,220
-Prejudicial.
-I beg to differ.

759
00:44:56,257 --> 00:44:57,781
MARTIN: Beg all you want.

760
00:44:57,825 --> 00:45:00,055
JUDGE: Counsel, please.
The photographs are in.

761
00:45:00,094 --> 00:45:03,723
Would you two like a recess
to carry on in private?

762
00:45:03,764 --> 00:45:06,597
Sorry, Your Honor,
but the next thing you know...

763
00:45:06,634 --> 00:45:09,034
he'll be objecting if we bring
in the murder weapon.

764
00:45:11,772 --> 00:45:13,933
Now that she brings it up...

765
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,947
MARTIN:
This is a public building.

766
00:45:27,688 --> 00:45:30,248
Excuse me, Mr. Vail...

767
00:45:31,258 --> 00:45:32,725
would you sign this for me?

768
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:39,798
ARRINGTON: Tell me about Linda,
your girlfriend.

769
00:45:41,302 --> 00:45:43,236
Y-yes. Yes, she was.

770
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,897
How'd you meet?

771
00:45:44,939 --> 00:45:48,807
Uh, we was both
at the Savior House.

772
00:45:48,843 --> 00:45:50,572
I was an altar boy.

773
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:54,342
She--she was doing work
for Bishop Rushman.

774
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:57,441
What was the relationship like?

775
00:45:57,485 --> 00:45:58,782
AARON: M-me and Linda?

776
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:00,252
Mm-hmm.

777
00:46:00,287 --> 00:46:01,754
She was real cultural.

778
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:03,882
Real cultural and very smart.

779
00:46:03,924 --> 00:46:06,415
We--we had a nice time together.

780
00:46:10,097 --> 00:46:11,997
W-we might get married.

781
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:15,830
Were you sleeping together?

782
00:46:19,774 --> 00:46:21,241
Well, that's private.

783
00:46:21,275 --> 00:46:24,142
ARRINGTON: I know.
I have to ask the question.

784
00:46:24,178 --> 00:46:27,841
Were you having
a sexual relationship?

785
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:32,412
Y-yes. Yes, we were.

786
00:46:32,453 --> 00:46:35,354
ARRINGTON: Were you sleeping
with anyone else at the time?

787
00:46:36,457 --> 00:46:37,617
No.

788
00:46:37,658 --> 00:46:39,421
Was she?

789
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:50,526
Has she been to see you, Aaron?

790
00:46:58,479 --> 00:47:00,379
Well--well, no, but--

791
00:47:00,414 --> 00:47:01,904
ARRINGTON: And that upsets you?

792
00:47:05,419 --> 00:47:06,716
AARON: No.

793
00:47:06,754 --> 00:47:09,848
No, thing is,
she--she went away.

794
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:13,223
She went away for a while.

795
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,285
She left b-before this happened.

796
00:47:15,329 --> 00:47:17,388
I don't even think...

797
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:20,229
don't even think
she knows about it.

798
00:47:23,938 --> 00:47:25,929
[Alarm chirps]

799
00:47:32,112 --> 00:47:33,443
[Telephone rings]

800
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,947
-Yo, boss.
-Hey.

801
00:47:34,982 --> 00:47:36,745
-Got something for me?
-Yeah.

802
00:47:37,718 --> 00:47:39,413
NAOMl: There's nothing
catalogued at downtown branch...

803
00:47:39,453 --> 00:47:41,421
under the numbers B32.156...

804
00:47:41,455 --> 00:47:44,913
but I think the "B"
is actually an 8.

805
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:48,782
I think the knife slipped.
832.156.

806
00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:52,319
"Thomas Jefferson"?
I don't think he did it.

807
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,913
You won't be much
happier with this--

808
00:47:54,954 --> 00:47:56,421
a list
of the archbishop's charities...

809
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,923
and his foundation's
investments.

810
00:47:57,957 --> 00:48:00,687
Nothing startling here,
except for how many there are.

811
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:05,130
Wait a minute here.

812
00:48:05,165 --> 00:48:08,032
What was he doing
with the South River deal?

813
00:48:08,068 --> 00:48:09,330
Pull that up.

814
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,201
Who are the investors?

815
00:48:17,344 --> 00:48:18,743
Shaughnessy?

816
00:48:18,778 --> 00:48:22,680
That's Joey Pinero's
neighborhood.

817
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:26,379
JOEY: See this lot here?
This all used to be houses.

818
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:30,185
In fact, there was a house
over on the corner...

819
00:48:30,223 --> 00:48:32,384
where I kissed
my first girlfriend.

820
00:48:32,425 --> 00:48:34,393
Got her pregnant, too.

821
00:48:34,427 --> 00:48:36,054
MARTIN: Hell of a kiss, Joey.

822
00:48:36,096 --> 00:48:37,427
JOEY: Oh, yeah.

823
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:40,228
This whole neighborhood's
gonna end up high-rent condos...

824
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:41,893
if those guys get their way.

825
00:48:41,935 --> 00:48:45,200
That's why I'm buying back
the lot with the settlement.

826
00:48:45,238 --> 00:48:47,866
You heard about that, right?
The money?

827
00:48:47,907 --> 00:48:49,101
ALDERMAN: Who hasn't?

828
00:48:49,142 --> 00:48:50,302
JOEY: Marty's the best.

829
00:48:50,343 --> 00:48:52,243
MARTIN: Just doing my job.

830
00:48:52,278 --> 00:48:55,247
JOEY: Yeah. A million-five,
he's just doing his job.

831
00:48:55,281 --> 00:48:58,580
MARTIN: Alderman, Joey tells me
a cop came around...

832
00:48:58,618 --> 00:49:00,848
wanting him to set you up.

833
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:03,185
ALDERMAN: It's typical.

834
00:49:03,223 --> 00:49:06,488
Can't buy me,
so they try and buy a brother.

835
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,461
Most people assume
this land we're walking on...

836
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:13,057
belongs to the railroad,
but it doesn't.

837
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:15,499
It belongs to the church.

838
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,332
-The church?
-Mm-hmm.

839
00:49:19,372 --> 00:49:21,237
So that's
the Rushman Foundation?

840
00:49:21,274 --> 00:49:24,869
ALDERMAN: Right, along with
a bunch of rich developers.

841
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:26,708
Including John Shaughnessy?

842
00:49:26,746 --> 00:49:28,270
ALDERMAN: Oh, yeah.

843
00:49:28,314 --> 00:49:30,874
Then they got greedy,
buying up all the land...

844
00:49:30,917 --> 00:49:33,886
and old buildings around
the church property...

845
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,387
then tearing it down.

846
00:49:35,422 --> 00:49:37,356
Our old neighborhood
was gonna to disappear.

847
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:39,620
So I asked the archbishop...

848
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:42,219
"What are you doing
to these people?

849
00:49:42,262 --> 00:49:43,388
"They're poor.

850
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:46,160
"They're getting kicked
out of their homes...

851
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:47,598
"and they're Catholic."

852
00:49:47,634 --> 00:49:48,828
JOEY: Fuckin'-A.

853
00:49:48,868 --> 00:49:52,099
ALDERMAN: He listened.
I couldn't believe it.

854
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,409
He told them to stop developing
around the church property.

855
00:49:56,443 --> 00:49:59,173
MARTIN: So the partners are
holding these empty buildings...

856
00:49:59,212 --> 00:50:01,874
they can't knock down
and land they can't build on.

857
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,746
Shaughnessy loses millions.

858
00:50:03,783 --> 00:50:04,909
ALDERMAN: Mm-hmm.

859
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:07,146
MARTIN: lf I need you to,
will you testify?

860
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:09,246
JOEY: Who, me? Oh, yeah.

861
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:10,779
Easy.

862
00:50:10,824 --> 00:50:13,384
Just change out of this,
put on a Brooks Brothers...

863
00:50:13,426 --> 00:50:15,326
with loafers and tassels,
you bet.

864
00:50:15,361 --> 00:50:16,851
MARTIN: Not--not you.

865
00:50:18,565 --> 00:50:19,725
ALDERMAN: Sure.

866
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:22,461
I'll testify.

867
00:50:25,472 --> 00:50:27,633
SHAUGHNESSY:
You know what people think--

868
00:50:27,674 --> 00:50:29,767
think this great city
runs itself.

869
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:31,936
It gets up, goes to work...

870
00:50:31,978 --> 00:50:34,276
and climbs into bed
at night like we do.

871
00:50:34,314 --> 00:50:38,045
They're unaware of what it takes
to see it doesn't break down--

872
00:50:38,084 --> 00:50:41,281
crime, fires, riots...

873
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:44,290
the goddamn water pipes
bursting under the city.

874
00:50:44,324 --> 00:50:46,724
What a fucking mess that was.

875
00:50:46,759 --> 00:50:48,784
Who does
the water commissioner call...

876
00:50:48,828 --> 00:50:50,455
the contractor who built it?

877
00:50:50,497 --> 00:50:53,625
No. He calls me.
They all call me.

878
00:50:56,336 --> 00:50:58,770
God damn, this is terrific.

879
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:02,901
They call me,
because I keep the peace.

880
00:51:02,942 --> 00:51:05,410
That's my job.

881
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:08,903
This city doesn't burn
because I won't permit it.

882
00:51:08,948 --> 00:51:11,508
I'm the great negotiator.

883
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:13,348
You think people get that?

884
00:51:13,386 --> 00:51:15,047
Truth is, I don't care.

885
00:51:15,088 --> 00:51:17,420
Dumb bastards don't even vote.

886
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:19,755
All they want to do is eat,
sleep, watch TV...

887
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:21,453
and occasionally
fuck their wives.

888
00:51:22,629 --> 00:51:24,290
MARTIN: Guess we should all
thank you.

889
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:25,763
SHAUGHNESSY: Ha.

890
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:26,958
You're welcome.

891
00:51:28,468 --> 00:51:30,936
John,
you need some new material.

892
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:34,963
I've heard this
great city speech 10 times.

893
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,438
Your boy Pinero's not honoring
his side of the deal.

894
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,914
Is that what this
dinner's about? Pinero?

895
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:44,439
In part.

896
00:51:44,484 --> 00:51:47,453
MARTIN:
I told him what the deal is.

897
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:49,182
He's a grownup.
What's the other part?

898
00:51:52,158 --> 00:51:53,785
I understand your assistant's
been digging around...

899
00:51:53,826 --> 00:51:55,760
in the archbishop's
financial affairs.

900
00:51:57,397 --> 00:51:58,591
Yeah. Well...

901
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:06,905
How much did you lose...

902
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,738
when he pulled the plug
from South River, John?

903
00:52:11,444 --> 00:52:13,412
Let me tell you something.

904
00:52:13,446 --> 00:52:15,414
It's a mistake to stick
your thumb...

905
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:17,916
in the eyes of the most
powerful people in the city.

906
00:52:17,951 --> 00:52:20,283
MARTIN: It's not their eyes
I'm aiming for.

907
00:52:23,823 --> 00:52:26,621
Do not fuck with me, Marty.

908
00:52:40,473 --> 00:52:42,873
Pipes are bursting again, John.

909
00:53:01,086 --> 00:53:02,713
ECKERT: ln the most anticipated
murder trial...

910
00:53:02,755 --> 00:53:04,382
in recent Chicago history...

911
00:53:04,423 --> 00:53:07,221
former State's Attorney
prosecutor Martin Vail...

912
00:53:07,259 --> 00:53:09,227
will lead with
his opening statement...

913
00:53:09,261 --> 00:53:11,422
on behalf
of Aaron Stampler...

914
00:53:14,266 --> 00:53:17,394
JANET: Richard Rushman
was a man of God.

915
00:53:17,436 --> 00:53:21,236
He spent his life giving
to the people of Chicago.

916
00:53:21,273 --> 00:53:23,400
He was a beacon
of inspiration...

917
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:25,569
not only
as a spiritual leader...

918
00:53:25,611 --> 00:53:28,307
YU: ...Deliver his opening
statement tomorrow...

919
00:53:28,347 --> 00:53:30,406
MARTIN:
My name is Martin Vail.

920
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:33,282
The reason I'm here,
and you're here...

921
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:35,844
is to make sure
that the truth is known.

922
00:53:35,888 --> 00:53:38,083
Now, we can begin
to learn the truth...

923
00:53:38,123 --> 00:53:39,886
by talking about
what the prosecution...

924
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,257
does not want you to hear.

925
00:53:42,294 --> 00:53:44,262
JANET: Do not be fooled...

926
00:53:44,296 --> 00:53:46,423
by the defendant's innocent
appearance and demeanor.

927
00:53:46,465 --> 00:53:47,932
Aaron Stampler...

928
00:53:47,966 --> 00:53:50,764
sat in judgment
of Archbishop Rushman...

929
00:53:50,803 --> 00:53:53,431
and determined that
not only should he die...

930
00:53:53,472 --> 00:53:55,599
but he should die
the most brutal...

931
00:53:55,641 --> 00:53:57,700
MARTIN: Aaron was arrested
within minutes...

932
00:53:57,743 --> 00:53:59,711
of the Archbishop's death.

933
00:53:59,745 --> 00:54:01,713
We all saw it on television.

934
00:54:01,747 --> 00:54:04,375
But why?
Because he was convenient.

935
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:07,852
Because there was enormous
pressure to solve this crime.

936
00:54:07,886 --> 00:54:10,013
JANET: The evidence will show
that Aaron Stampler...

937
00:54:10,055 --> 00:54:13,718
stalked, ambushed, and savagely
murdered this great man.

938
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,387
MARTIN: The prosecution
doesn't want you to hear...

939
00:54:16,428 --> 00:54:18,396
about the other
altar boys in the choir...

940
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:20,398
who have mysteriously
disappeared.

941
00:54:20,432 --> 00:54:23,731
JANET: You will learn
that Aaron Stampler...

942
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:26,237
had everything he needed
for the perfect assassination.

943
00:54:26,271 --> 00:54:27,704
Using this knife...

944
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,733
Aaron Stampler
repeatedly stabbed...

945
00:54:31,777 --> 00:54:33,904
at the archbishop's chest...

946
00:54:33,946 --> 00:54:37,211
his genitals, his eyes.

947
00:54:37,249 --> 00:54:39,080
MARTIN:
They don't want you to hear...

948
00:54:39,118 --> 00:54:40,745
that the archbishop
made investments...

949
00:54:40,786 --> 00:54:42,583
on behalf of
the Roman Catholic church...

950
00:54:42,621 --> 00:54:45,454
and that those investments
resulted in huge losses...

951
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,482
for some
very, very powerful people.

952
00:54:47,526 --> 00:54:50,461
They don't want you
to hear about...

953
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:53,124
the 20 death threats
this year alone...

954
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,826
that the archbishop
received prior to death.

955
00:54:54,867 --> 00:54:56,858
And they really
don't want you to hear...

956
00:54:56,902 --> 00:54:58,699
about their theory of motive.

957
00:54:58,737 --> 00:55:00,466
And why is that? Very simple.

958
00:55:03,075 --> 00:55:05,202
They don't have one.

959
00:55:07,246 --> 00:55:10,579
JANET: lnspector Woodside,
can you explain to the court...

960
00:55:10,616 --> 00:55:12,709
where these sneakers
came from?

961
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:14,719
WOODSIDE: They were taken off
the defendant...

962
00:55:14,753 --> 00:55:16,345
when he was apprehended.

963
00:55:16,388 --> 00:55:19,585
JANET: And what was the result
of the bloodstain analysis?

964
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:22,492
WOODSIDE: The result
proved to be human blood...

965
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:24,553
matching the blood type
and DNA characteristics...

966
00:55:24,596 --> 00:55:26,086
of Archbishop Rushman.

967
00:55:26,131 --> 00:55:28,998
JANET: What do the footprints
surrounding the body say?

968
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,901
The killer left a pattern
of bloody footprints...

969
00:55:31,937 --> 00:55:33,905
around the area
of the struggle...

970
00:55:33,939 --> 00:55:37,170
as indicated by the spread
of blood through the room.

971
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,040
MARTIN: Yes or no, lnspector--

972
00:55:39,077 --> 00:55:41,739
could there have been
a third person there?

973
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,078
WOODSIDE: There is no evidence
to suggest that.

974
00:55:44,116 --> 00:55:45,947
But there's no evidence
to prove there wasn't.

975
00:55:45,984 --> 00:55:47,246
No.

976
00:55:47,286 --> 00:55:49,686
And after the struggle,
what happened then?

977
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,712
WOODSIDE: Analysis suggests
the killer was startled...

978
00:55:51,757 --> 00:55:53,486
during the mutilation...

979
00:55:53,525 --> 00:55:55,493
and ran downstairs
from the bedroom.

980
00:55:55,527 --> 00:55:58,860
Is it possible, lnspector...

981
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,661
that the real killer--
a third person--

982
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,634
who maybe was smart enough...

983
00:56:03,669 --> 00:56:08,231
not to tramp a freeway
of blood through the place...

984
00:56:08,273 --> 00:56:11,037
couldn't this person have placed
the defendant's prints...

985
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,408
on the knife
while he was passed out?

986
00:56:13,445 --> 00:56:15,709
Mr. Vail, anything is possible.

987
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:19,547
JANET: So, the victim suffered
a great number of stab wounds?

988
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:23,316
WEIL: Yes, he did--78.
He tried to defend himself.

989
00:56:23,355 --> 00:56:26,017
That explains the cuts
to hands and forearms.

990
00:56:26,058 --> 00:56:28,356
Doctor, isn't it a fact
that you can't be sure...

991
00:56:28,393 --> 00:56:32,056
whether more than
one person inflicted...

992
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,827
these 78 stab
and incise wounds?

993
00:56:34,867 --> 00:56:37,893
WEIL: It could've been more
than one, but I doubt it.

994
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,598
From your analysis of
the knife wounds, Dr. Weil...

995
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:42,402
do you have an opinion
whether the killer...

996
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,170
was left or right-handed?

997
00:56:44,209 --> 00:56:46,541
WEIL: The throat wound
and chest wounds...

998
00:56:46,578 --> 00:56:49,240
were made from an angle
that strongly suggests...

999
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:51,511
a left-handed person
was using the knife.

1000
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,814
To your knowledge,
is the defendant left-handed?

1001
00:56:53,852 --> 00:56:54,910
Yes, he is.

1002
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,183
It's possible
that a right-handed person...

1003
00:56:57,222 --> 00:57:00,248
could've deliberately
used his left hand...

1004
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:01,589
to inflict these wounds.

1005
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:03,219
Yes, that is possible.

1006
00:57:03,262 --> 00:57:05,526
Then it would be
reasonable to assume...

1007
00:57:05,564 --> 00:57:08,965
that there was a third person
at the crime scene?

1008
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:11,265
Reasonable, no,
but it is possible.

1009
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:12,930
ANCHOR: Then following
opening statements...

1010
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,872
it was a day of strong
and detailed testimony...

1011
00:57:15,908 --> 00:57:17,705
from the prosecution's
first witnesses--

1012
00:57:17,743 --> 00:57:19,711
Cook County Forensics Chief
Harvey Woodside...

1013
00:57:19,745 --> 00:57:21,975
and Cook County
Medical Examiner Emil Weil.

1014
00:57:22,014 --> 00:57:25,211
There was also tough
cross-examination...

1015
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,548
by Stampler defense attorney
Martin Vail.

1016
00:57:27,586 --> 00:57:29,781
By most accounts, though,
the prosecution...

1017
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,221
JANET: Captain Stenner,
I'd like to thank you...

1018
00:57:32,257 --> 00:57:33,918
for all the time
you've given us today.

1019
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:36,291
Finally, I would like
to turn your attention...

1020
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:39,729
to the symbol carved in
the archbishop's chest.

1021
00:57:39,765 --> 00:57:43,223
Would you tell the jury
about that, Captain?

1022
00:57:43,268 --> 00:57:48,729
STENNER: Yes. The letter
and the numbers B32.156...

1023
00:57:48,774 --> 00:57:50,639
were carved into
the archbishop's chest.

1024
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:55,010
JANET: Have you been able
to find an identical reference?

1025
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:56,309
I believe so, yes.

1026
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:59,647
The symbol--B32.156--

1027
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:02,119
is actually
catalog code for a book...

1028
00:58:02,154 --> 00:58:04,418
discovered in
a private reading room...

1029
00:58:04,456 --> 00:58:06,117
Iocated
in the church basement.

1030
00:58:06,158 --> 00:58:10,686
The B32 part
refers to a book--

1031
00:58:10,729 --> 00:58:14,859
The Scarlet Letter
by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

1032
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,700
When we opened the book
to page 156...

1033
00:58:18,737 --> 00:58:21,535
we discovered
an underlined passage.

1034
00:58:21,573 --> 00:58:24,701
JANET: Would you please read
this underlined passage...

1035
00:58:24,743 --> 00:58:26,074
to the court?

1036
00:58:28,914 --> 00:58:31,712
"No man,
for any considerable period...

1037
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,877
"can wear one face to himself...

1038
00:58:33,919 --> 00:58:35,853
"and another to the multitude...

1039
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,855
"without finally
getting bewildered...

1040
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:41,222
"as to which may be the true."

1041
00:58:41,259 --> 00:58:42,624
Thank you.

1042
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,859
What does that passage
mean to you, Captain?

1043
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,924
MARTIN: Objection.

1044
00:58:49,968 --> 00:58:51,731
He's a policeman,
not an English professor.

1045
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:54,671
His interpretation would be
speculative and irrelevant.

Well, to me, it's simple.

1049
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:04,205
The killer thought
his victim was two-faced.

JANET:
ln your experience, Captain...

1052
00:59:08,453 --> 00:59:12,082

leave clues to their motive?

the kid who did this.

We have to at least
consider the possibility.

points towards him...

ARRINGTON: There's something--

1220
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,091
I need to be alone
with my client.

1221
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:23,899
Do you trust me?

1222
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:27,905
Do--Yes.

1223
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,570
Yes. Of course I do.

1224
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:32,171
Good, because I don't trust you.

1225
01:12:37,285 --> 01:12:39,617
I'll lay it all out for you.

1226
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:43,921
I'm losing this case.

1227
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,586
You know why
I'm losing this case?

1228
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:47,891
'Cause my fucking client
is fucking lying to me.

1229
01:12:47,929 --> 01:12:50,557
I nev-nev-never--

1230
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,159
That's bullshit! That's it.

1231
01:12:53,201 --> 01:12:55,931
No more bullshit.
No more games.

1232
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:59,134
Everybody thinks you did this!
Everybody!

1233
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,802
I'm the only one who believes
you, and I am that close!

1234
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:05,870
So I want it all out--
all of it, right here.

1235
01:13:07,148 --> 01:13:09,810
Did you underline that book?

1236
01:13:09,851 --> 01:13:12,046
Hey, hey! Look at me.

1237
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:13,554
Did you underline that book?

1238
01:13:13,588 --> 01:13:15,988
N-n-no, I didn't.

1239
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:18,925
I don't believe you.
That is bullshit!

1240
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:19,984
I told--

1241
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:23,327
I don't fucking believe you!
I saw the tape!

1242
01:13:24,432 --> 01:13:27,765
I saw the tape.
I know what he did to you.

1243
01:13:27,802 --> 01:13:29,292
AARON: No, no, no!

1244
01:13:29,337 --> 01:13:33,398
MARTIN: Don't fucking do this.
Tell me the truth.

1245
01:13:33,441 --> 01:13:36,103
You fucking killed him,
didn't you?

1246
01:13:36,144 --> 01:13:38,135
You're so full of shit!
You did it, didn't you?

1247
01:13:38,179 --> 01:13:39,305
Don't lie to me.

1248
01:13:39,347 --> 01:13:41,247
You little fuck!
You killed him !

1249
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:42,648
You son of a bitch!
You fucking killed him !

1250
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:46,176
AARON: No! What the hell
you want from me now?

1251
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:49,748
Quit your cryin'! I can't
understand a goddamn word!

1252
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:51,156
You little sissy!
You make me sick!

1253
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:58,124
Well, lookie here.
Who the fuck are you?

1254
01:13:58,166 --> 01:13:59,656
MARTIN: Who the fuck are you?

1255
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:02,431
This is my cell, Jack!
Who the fuck are you?

1256
01:14:05,473 --> 01:14:07,941
I got you now.

1257
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:11,139
You're the lawyer.
You his lawyer, ain't you?

1258
01:14:11,179 --> 01:14:14,546
Yeah, with your fancy suit.
I heard about you.

1259
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,608
Well, my, my.

1260
01:14:16,651 --> 01:14:19,341
You sure fucked
this one up, counselor!

1261
01:14:19,474 --> 01:14:21,567
They're gonna shoot Aaron
so full of poison...

1262
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:23,601
it's gonna come out
his eyes!

1263
01:14:23,645 --> 01:14:25,943
Where is Aaron?

1264
01:14:25,981 --> 01:14:28,142
Aaron's cryin' off
in some corner somewhere.

1265
01:14:28,183 --> 01:14:31,152
You scared him off.
You gotta deal with me now, boy.

1266
01:14:31,186 --> 01:14:33,586
I ought to give you
a beatin' on principle!

1267
01:14:33,622 --> 01:14:34,850
Look at me.

1268
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:38,519
You come pullin' that tough-guy
shit on Aaron again...

1269
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,027
I'll kick your fuckin' ass
to Sunday!

1270
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:43,087
-You understand me?
-I understand you.

1271
01:14:43,131 --> 01:14:45,429
MARTIN: Aaron gets in trouble,
he calls you.

1272
01:14:45,467 --> 01:14:46,764
You're the man.

1273
01:14:46,801 --> 01:14:48,826
Aaron couldn't kick
his own ass.

1274
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:52,328
I mean, you seen him,
with the "Duh-duh-duh."

1275
01:14:53,742 --> 01:14:57,371
Jesus Christ.
He can't handle anything.

1276
01:14:57,412 --> 01:15:00,347
Sure as shit couldn't handle
all that preacher's blood.

1277
01:15:00,382 --> 01:15:03,874
If he'd done like I told him,
we wouldn't be in this mess!

1278
01:15:03,919 --> 01:15:05,853
But he got scared and, "Duh."

1279
01:15:05,887 --> 01:15:09,550
Ran off and got hisself caught.
Stupid little shit.

1280
01:15:09,591 --> 01:15:12,822
MARTIN:
So Aaron did kill Rushman?

1281
01:15:12,861 --> 01:15:14,158
Hell, no!

1282
01:15:14,195 --> 01:15:15,662
Jesus Christ!
Where'd they find you?

1283
01:15:15,697 --> 01:15:17,722
Ain't you been listenin' to me?

1284
01:15:17,766 --> 01:15:21,224
Aaron don't have the guts
to do nothin'.

1285
01:15:21,269 --> 01:15:24,397
It was me, boy. It was me.

1286
01:15:24,439 --> 01:15:27,738
-It was you.
-Yes, it was.

1287
01:15:27,776 --> 01:15:30,745
He come cryin' to me
like always...

1288
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:32,576
stutterin' and whinin'--

1289
01:15:32,614 --> 01:15:35,549
"l can-can't t-take it
no more, Roy.

1290
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:37,642
"You got--got to help me.

1291
01:15:37,686 --> 01:15:39,813
"Please--please, Roy."

1292
01:15:39,854 --> 01:15:41,583
I said, "Shut your mouth,
you little girl!

1293
01:15:41,623 --> 01:15:43,591
"Grow up. Be a man.
Take care of yourself."

1294
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:45,286
MARTIN: Be a man. Yeah.

1295
01:15:48,296 --> 01:15:49,991
So your name is Roy?

1296
01:15:50,031 --> 01:15:54,263
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry. Yeah.
What is it, Marty?

1297
01:15:54,302 --> 01:15:55,428
Yeah.

1298
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:57,233
Listen, Marty,
I'm dyin' for a smoke.

1299
01:15:57,272 --> 01:15:58,398
Do you have a cigarette on you?

1300
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,635
MARTIN: No. I quit.

1301
01:16:00,675 --> 01:16:03,735
Fuck that.
I can't live without them.

1302
01:16:03,778 --> 01:16:06,372
There's gotta be a butt
around somewhere.

1303
01:16:06,414 --> 01:16:11,545
Roy, tell me about--
about Linda.

1304
01:16:11,586 --> 01:16:13,554
-Linda?
-Yeah.

1305
01:16:13,588 --> 01:16:15,522
Who the fuck cares about Linda?

1306
01:16:15,557 --> 01:16:18,253
MARTIN: I care.
I'd like to know about Linda.

1307
01:16:18,293 --> 01:16:21,626
ROY: That little tramp.
Everybody had a piece of her.

1308
01:16:21,663 --> 01:16:23,961
She had Aaron
wrapped up so tight...

1309
01:16:23,999 --> 01:16:26,297
he actually thought
she was his girlfriend.

1310
01:16:26,334 --> 01:16:29,064
It was pathetic.
She broke his heart.

1311
01:16:29,104 --> 01:16:31,732
So that's why you
had to kill Rushman?

1312
01:16:31,773 --> 01:16:33,764
Because of the sex stuff?

1313
01:16:36,177 --> 01:16:37,667
You seen the tape.

1314
01:16:40,682 --> 01:16:43,048
Answer me, you son of a bitch!

1315
01:16:43,084 --> 01:16:45,279
Do you think
I'm playin' with you?

1316
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,914
I will break your fuckin' neck!

1317
01:16:47,956 --> 01:16:51,084
I'll ask you again.
Have you seen that tape?

1318
01:16:51,126 --> 01:16:53,094
MARTIN:
Of course I saw the tape.

1319
01:16:53,128 --> 01:16:54,618
ROY: Goddamn it!

1320
01:16:54,662 --> 01:16:57,927
I told him, "Get the tape!
It's motive, you asshole!"

1321
01:16:57,966 --> 01:16:59,524
This is gonna
fuck everything up!

1322
01:16:59,567 --> 01:17:01,558
Don't show that
to a goddamn person!

1323
01:17:01,603 --> 01:17:03,730
-Do you understand me?
-Yes!

1324
01:17:03,772 --> 01:17:04,966
Aaron!

1325
01:17:05,006 --> 01:17:05,995
MARTIN: Damn it.

1326
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:51,248
Mis--

1327
01:17:51,286 --> 01:17:53,277
Mr. Vail?

1328
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:01,551
Yeah. I'm right here, Aaron.

1329
01:18:22,584 --> 01:18:23,915
[Sighs]

1330
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,856
MARTIN: He did it.
The little fuck did it.

1331
01:18:32,427 --> 01:18:35,885
How could I miss that?
Am I going to need stitches?

1332
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:37,090
ARRINGTON: No.

1333
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:41,398
He didn't do it.

1334
01:18:41,436 --> 01:18:44,405
Aaron has no idea
what just happened in there.

1335
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:46,737
Kept seeing all the signs--
big ones.

1336
01:18:46,774 --> 01:18:49,242
The abusive background,
these repeated blackouts...

1337
01:18:49,277 --> 01:18:51,939
the ellipsis in thought,
he's ambidextrous.

1338
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:54,744
I tried to tell you
when you came in.

1339
01:18:54,782 --> 01:18:57,512
MARTIN: You may be thrilled,
but I'm fucked.

1340
01:18:57,552 --> 01:18:58,951
I don't have a case.

1341
01:18:58,987 --> 01:19:03,014
It's textbook
multiple personality disorder.

1342
01:19:03,057 --> 01:19:05,525
Put me on the stand.
I'll testify.

1343
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,528
He's insane.

1344
01:19:07,562 --> 01:19:09,530
I can't--

1345
01:19:09,564 --> 01:19:13,466
I can't change plea
in the middle of a trial.

1346
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:15,867
The judge would never allow it.

1347
01:19:15,904 --> 01:19:19,670
Besides, insanity's
the hardest thing to prove.

1348
01:19:19,707 --> 01:19:20,867
OK.

1349
01:19:22,744 --> 01:19:24,541
My professional opinion?

1350
01:19:24,579 --> 01:19:27,275
This is not a criminal
we're dealing with.

1351
01:19:27,315 --> 01:19:28,782
It's a sick kid.

1352
01:19:28,816 --> 01:19:32,718
He's sitting in a cell,
and it's not where he belongs.

1353
01:19:39,427 --> 01:19:41,588
Got an aspirin?

1354
01:19:50,305 --> 01:19:52,239
[Door buzzes]

1355
01:20:36,751 --> 01:20:38,742
[Sighs]

1356
01:20:39,754 --> 01:20:43,155
Come on, Connerman. Ask it.

1357
01:20:43,191 --> 01:20:44,658
Ask what?

1358
01:20:46,527 --> 01:20:50,361
The question
you wanted to ask me before.

1359
01:20:50,398 --> 01:20:52,866
I--I don't understand,
Mr. Vail.

1360
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,892
"How can you defend someone
if you know they did it?"

1361
01:20:55,937 --> 01:20:57,564
"How can you do that?"

1362
01:20:57,605 --> 01:21:00,233
"How can you fucking defend
these fucking scumbags?"

1363
01:21:00,275 --> 01:21:02,243
Isn't that what you
wanted to ask me?

1364
01:21:02,277 --> 01:21:04,711
All those coy questions,
all that bullshit.

1365
01:21:04,746 --> 01:21:08,147
Bottom line is,
"How can you do what you do?"

1366
01:21:08,182 --> 01:21:10,173
[Sighs]

1367
01:21:13,488 --> 01:21:15,513
You think it's the money,
don't you?

1368
01:21:18,192 --> 01:21:22,686
The money's nice.
The money's very, very nice.

1369
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:26,894
The first thing
I ask a new client is...

1370
01:21:26,934 --> 01:21:29,562
"You been saving up
for a rainy day?

1371
01:21:29,604 --> 01:21:32,927
"Guess what? It's raining."

1372
01:21:34,028 --> 01:21:36,861
You think it's because
I want to see my face...

1373
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:38,888
on the cover of magazines?

1374
01:21:40,534 --> 01:21:42,434
Fifteen seconds on TV?

1375
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:45,371
I love it.
I fucking love that shit.

1376
01:21:45,406 --> 01:21:46,566
I really do.

1377
01:21:46,607 --> 01:21:49,007
But guess what?

1378
01:21:49,043 --> 01:21:50,305
That's not it.

1379
01:21:54,281 --> 01:21:56,249
You go to Las Vegas?

1380
01:21:56,283 --> 01:21:57,682
JACK: Yeah.

1381
01:21:57,718 --> 01:22:01,085
I don't go to Vegas.
Why do you think I don't?

1382
01:22:01,121 --> 01:22:03,646
JACK: Marty, it's late.
I think we should both--

1383
01:22:03,691 --> 01:22:05,659
Why gamble with money...

1384
01:22:05,693 --> 01:22:08,127
when you can gamble
with people's lives?

1385
01:22:10,798 --> 01:22:12,390
That was a joke.

1386
01:22:14,235 --> 01:22:15,634
[Sighs]

1387
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:17,500
All right, I'll tell you.

1388
01:22:22,743 --> 01:22:24,711
I believe in the notion...

1389
01:22:24,745 --> 01:22:27,908
that people are innocent
until proven guilty.

1390
01:22:27,948 --> 01:22:31,440
I believe in that notion
because I choose to believe...

1391
01:22:31,485 --> 01:22:34,579
in the basic goodness
of people.

1392
01:22:34,622 --> 01:22:38,581
I choose to believe
that not all crimes...

1393
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:40,526
are committed by bad people...

1394
01:22:40,561 --> 01:22:43,291
and I try to understand...

1395
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:45,628
that some
very, very good people...

1396
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:48,965
do some very bad things.

1397
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:07,143
You know, when I was
working for Shaughnessy...

1398
01:23:07,187 --> 01:23:09,314
I did something very, very bad.

1399
01:23:09,356 --> 01:23:12,519
I mean, illegal.

1400
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,028
I was a prosecutor then.

1401
01:23:15,062 --> 01:23:17,496
This thing that I did,
it was bad.

1402
01:23:17,531 --> 01:23:19,499
I was very upset by it.

1403
01:23:19,533 --> 01:23:22,696
Decided I had to leave,
so I left.

1404
01:23:22,736 --> 01:23:24,931
I became a defending attorney--

1405
01:23:24,972 --> 01:23:28,408
irony being that everyone
assumes I'm lying anyhow.

1406
01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:31,104
And I made myself
this little promise--

1407
01:23:31,145 --> 01:23:34,546
that, um...

1408
01:23:34,582 --> 01:23:38,074
I would reserve my lies
for other than my public life.

1409
01:23:50,431 --> 01:23:53,867
You print any of this,
I'll sue your fucking ass.

1410
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:22,957
All right,
so I made a little mistake.

1411
01:24:22,997 --> 01:24:24,294
NAOMl: No shit.

1412
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:28,427
MARTIN: You want a new suit?
I'll buy you a new suit.

1413
01:24:28,469 --> 01:24:32,030
TOMMY: Made a mistake? You
told us the third man did it.

1414
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:36,031
Now you got your third man.
And a fourth and a fifth.

1415
01:24:36,076 --> 01:24:38,806
NAOMl:
What are you gonna do, Marty?

1416
01:24:38,846 --> 01:24:41,406
MARTIN: I don't know.
I really fucked up here.

1417
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:43,040
You were right.

1418
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:46,484
NAOMl: So how are you
gonna get him off?

1419
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:49,252
I don't know.

1420
01:24:49,289 --> 01:24:51,257
What I know is...

1421
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:54,192
Aaron did not commit
first-degree murder.

1422
01:24:54,228 --> 01:24:56,822
TOMMY: He stabbed him
a billion times.

1423
01:24:56,864 --> 01:24:59,992
MARTIN: Not Aaron. To convict
someone of a capital crime...

1424
01:25:00,034 --> 01:25:02,093
the state must prove intent.

1425
01:25:02,136 --> 01:25:04,297
Roy had intent, Aaron didn't.

1426
01:25:04,338 --> 01:25:07,501
NAOMl: The only way to prove
that is to change the plea...

1427
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:10,567
which we can't do mid-trial
unless you want a career change.

1428
01:25:10,611 --> 01:25:13,205
MARTIN: I could have been
mistaken, but I wasn't wrong.

1429
01:25:13,247 --> 01:25:16,512
Aaron is innocent.
It's Roy who is guilty.

1430
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:20,008
TOMMY: This kid needs
an exorcist, not a lawyer.

1431
01:25:20,054 --> 01:25:22,249
MARTIN: You're so full of shit.
You didn't see it!

1432
01:25:22,289 --> 01:25:25,281
He's one sick motherfucking boy
who's been fucked around...

1433
01:25:25,325 --> 01:25:27,418
his whole life by his father,
by his priest.

1434
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:29,520
He does not deserve to die.

1435
01:25:29,563 --> 01:25:32,396
It's our job to make sure
a jury believes that.

1436
01:25:32,433 --> 01:25:33,764
OK.

1437
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:35,291
How do we do it?

1438
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:40,235
By somehow introducing
this whole abuse thing.

1439
01:25:45,579 --> 01:25:48,104
-The tape.
-What about the tape?

1440
01:25:48,148 --> 01:25:51,140
NAOMl: That's crazy.
That gives him motive.

1441
01:25:51,185 --> 01:25:53,881
MARTIN:
It looks like that, but it's...

1442
01:25:53,921 --> 01:25:57,914
No, actually, it turns
this whole thing around.

1443
01:25:57,958 --> 01:26:02,520
It gives concrete documentation
of what Rushman did to this kid.

1444
01:26:02,563 --> 01:26:05,225
But we can't put it in.
You know that.

1445
01:26:05,265 --> 01:26:08,393
But we're not going to.

1446
01:26:15,743 --> 01:26:18,177
Oh, fuck.

1447
01:26:19,546 --> 01:26:21,241
Ohhh...

1448
01:26:25,052 --> 01:26:27,020
OK.

1449
01:26:27,054 --> 01:26:28,544
-OK.
-Good.

01:26:39,733 --> 01:26:41,223
that things got stormy...

1453
01:26:41,268 --> 01:26:44,635
and he would be the one
that would call.

1454
01:26:44,671 --> 01:26:48,038
But they never recorded
anything on this...

1455
01:26:48,075 --> 01:26:51,772

of violence...

01:27:30,184 --> 01:27:34,177
Where'd you get it?
Steal it from the crime scene?

1466
01:27:34,221 --> 01:27:35,552
I know nothing
about this tape.

1467
01:27:35,589 --> 01:27:36,954
You're such a liar.

1468
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:39,686
If this tape has on it
what you say...

1469
01:27:39,726 --> 01:27:42,024
it gives you motive.

1470
01:27:42,062 --> 01:27:45,520
You had to. You couldn't
introduce it in court.

1471
01:27:45,566 --> 01:27:48,467
The jury would despise you
for dishonoring the bishop.

1472
01:27:48,502 --> 01:27:50,527
But if you get me to show it...

1473
01:27:50,571 --> 01:27:52,436
motive or no motive,
I'm the one who looks bad...

1474
01:27:52,472 --> 01:27:56,966

your poor little abused boy.

-You think so?

of using it.

I have motive.

so good in a courtroom...

I honestly don't know.

You know him pretty well.

the minute you received it.

You don't think Vail has a copy?

there's an original?

he can authenticate.

Mr. Goodman to testify...

01:33:02,796 --> 01:33:04,696
I mean my apartment building.

1559
01:33:04,732 --> 01:33:06,427
Allegedly.

1560
01:33:06,467 --> 01:33:07,934
JANET:
I'm sorry. You're confused.

1561
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,199
Either you have, or you haven't.
Allegedly doesn't figure.

1562
01:33:11,238 --> 01:33:15,334
I have...been there. Yes.

1563
01:33:15,376 --> 01:33:17,469
Why did you go there?

1564
01:33:17,511 --> 01:33:18,944
TOMMY:
I was delivering something.

1565
01:33:18,979 --> 01:33:20,742
For whom?

1566
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:24,115
Martin Vail.

1567
01:33:24,151 --> 01:33:28,417
Mr. Vail sent you
to deliver something to me?

1568
01:33:28,455 --> 01:33:30,946
-Yes.
-What was it?

1569
01:33:30,991 --> 01:33:33,425
A videotape.

1570
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:37,362
Could this have been the tape
you delivered for Mr. Vail?

1571
01:33:37,398 --> 01:33:39,798
I have a feeling it is, yes.

1572
01:33:39,833 --> 01:33:42,768
JANET: The People place this
in evidence, Your Honor.

1573
01:33:42,803 --> 01:33:44,464
So ordered.
Bailiff, please index.

1574
01:33:44,505 --> 01:33:46,735
JANET: Where did Mr. Vail
get this tape...

1575
01:33:46,774 --> 01:33:48,867
if it is indeed the same one?

1576
01:33:48,909 --> 01:33:52,845
TOMMY: He took it from
Archbishop Rushman's closet.

1577
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,347
JANET: He stole it?

1578
01:33:54,381 --> 01:33:55,780
TOMMY: No, he borrowed it.

1579
01:33:55,816 --> 01:33:58,614
Once I transferred it
for him, I returned it.

1580
01:33:58,652 --> 01:34:01,348
JANET: Can you describe for me
what's on this tape?

1581
01:34:01,388 --> 01:34:04,448
There was a sermon
by Archbishop Rushman--

1582
01:34:04,491 --> 01:34:06,584
a rehearsal, I should say--

1583
01:34:06,627 --> 01:34:08,356
followed by, um...

1584
01:34:10,431 --> 01:34:12,399
a kind of home movie.

1585
01:34:12,433 --> 01:34:15,300
JANET: A home movie? Of what?

1586
01:34:15,336 --> 01:34:16,928
TOMMY: Some altar boys.

1587
01:34:16,971 --> 01:34:18,097
JANET: And?

1588
01:34:18,138 --> 01:34:19,105
TOMMY: A girl.

1589
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:21,130
Doing what?

1590
01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:26,175
An altar boy lesson
of some kind?

1591
01:34:26,213 --> 01:34:28,408
Having sex.

1592
01:34:28,449 --> 01:34:30,781
[Spectators gasp]

1593
01:34:30,818 --> 01:34:32,786
Quiet.

1594
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:34,515
A porno movie?

1595
01:34:34,555 --> 01:34:37,490
TOMMY: Mmm...yes.

1596
01:34:37,524 --> 01:34:39,822
Yes. Now how is it,
do you think...

1597
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:43,125
that this tape,
this porno tape...

1598
01:34:43,163 --> 01:34:44,755
was in the archbishop's
closet...

1599
01:34:44,798 --> 01:34:46,789
in order for Mr. Vail
to find it there?

1600
01:34:46,834 --> 01:34:49,667
He was the, um--the...director.

1601
01:34:49,703 --> 01:34:50,931
Who was?

1602
01:34:50,971 --> 01:34:52,063
Archbishop Rushman.

1603
01:34:52,106 --> 01:34:54,768
JUDGE: Quiet in the court!

1604
01:34:54,808 --> 01:34:56,435
MARTIN: [Whispering]
Everything's going fine.

1605
01:34:56,477 --> 01:34:59,935
JANET: And was the defendant
one of the altar boys...

1606
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:03,245
performing in
the archbishop's home movie?

1607
01:35:03,283 --> 01:35:04,477
Yes, he was.

1608
01:35:04,518 --> 01:35:06,076
JANET: Was his girlfriend?

1609
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:07,951
I believe her name
is Linda Forbes.

1610
01:35:08,956 --> 01:35:10,446
Yes, she was.

1611
01:35:10,491 --> 01:35:14,325
And did it appear to you
the defendant was enjoying...

1612
01:35:14,361 --> 01:35:17,228
performing in this film
with his girlfriend?

1613
01:35:17,264 --> 01:35:19,596
No, he does not.

1614
01:35:19,633 --> 01:35:24,332
I will not ask if you think
we have uncovered motive.

1615
01:35:24,371 --> 01:35:26,305
We will decide that
for ourselves...

1616
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:29,241
once we've
all seen the videotape.

1617
01:35:29,276 --> 01:35:31,005
No further questions.

1618
01:35:33,514 --> 01:35:37,382
JUDGE:
Does defense wish to cross?

1619
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,260
No, Your Honor.

1620
01:35:40,301 --> 01:35:43,737
Court's in recess.
Bailiff, set up for the tape.

1621
01:35:43,771 --> 01:35:46,171
Mr. Goodman, you're excused.

1622
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:52,102
JANET: Thanks for the advice.

1623
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:01,186
ARRINGTON: Mr. Vail said
she was your girlfriend.

1624
01:36:01,222 --> 01:36:03,190
AARON: Y-yes, she was.

1625
01:36:03,224 --> 01:36:04,691
ARRINGTON: How'd you meet?

1626
01:36:04,726 --> 01:36:07,695
AARON:
We was both at the Savior House.

1627
01:36:07,729 --> 01:36:10,163
I was an altar boy...

1628
01:36:10,198 --> 01:36:15,431
and she was w-working
for Bishop Rushman.

1629
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:16,459
ARRINGTON: Doing what?

1630
01:36:22,977 --> 01:36:26,469
ARRINGTON: Were you sleeping
with anyone else at the time?

1631
01:36:26,514 --> 01:36:27,481
No, no.

1632
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:29,244
ARRINGTON: Was she?

1633
01:36:30,985 --> 01:36:34,887
AARON: N-n-no--no.

1634
01:36:34,923 --> 01:36:36,914
[Telephone rings]

1635
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:39,821
MARTIN: Yeah.

1636
01:36:39,861 --> 01:36:41,488
No, I'm still here.

1637
01:36:43,831 --> 01:36:44,991
What?

1638
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:09,953
MARTIN: Thank you.

1639
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:30,538
JUDGE: Mr. Vail...

1640
01:37:30,578 --> 01:37:32,773
are you prepared to proceed
with your first witness?

1641
01:37:44,726 --> 01:37:46,193
Yes, Your Honor.

1642
01:37:46,227 --> 01:37:49,162
The defense calls
John Shaughnessy.

1643
01:37:50,598 --> 01:37:52,190
Oh, shit.

1644
01:37:53,434 --> 01:37:55,732
The People object, Your Honor.

1645
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:57,397
Mr. Shaughnessy's
never been identified--

1646
01:37:57,438 --> 01:37:59,065
Your Honor, may I approach?

1647
01:37:59,107 --> 01:38:00,802
-Yes, you may.
-Thank you.

1648
01:38:03,945 --> 01:38:05,913
MARTIN: My client's on trial
for his life here.

1649
01:38:05,947 --> 01:38:07,915
He's always maintained
there was someone else...

1650
01:38:07,949 --> 01:38:09,416
in that bedroom.

1651
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:12,681
You think Mr. Shaughnessy
can confirm that?

1652
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,415
The U.S. Constitution
takes precedence...

1653
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:16,923
permitting the calling
of any witness...

1654
01:38:16,958 --> 01:38:18,755
to promulgate
evidence of innocence.

1655
01:38:18,793 --> 01:38:21,261
That's clearly stated
in the Sixth Amendment.

1656
01:38:21,295 --> 01:38:23,559
It's also profound
in Brady vs. Maryland.

1657
01:38:25,533 --> 01:38:26,795
MARTIN: Mr. Shaughnessy...

1658
01:38:26,834 --> 01:38:28,927
you serve on
the board of an organization...

1659
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,938
known as
The Rushman Foundation?

1660
01:38:30,972 --> 01:38:33,463
I'm privileged to be
an honorary board member.

1661
01:38:33,508 --> 01:38:36,841
Explain the nature and purpose
of this foundation.

1662
01:38:36,878 --> 01:38:39,244
SHAUGHNESSY: It was founded
by the late archbishop.

1663
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,249
Its purpose is to invest
in projects...

1664
01:38:42,283 --> 01:38:43,807
for the greater good
of the community.

1665
01:38:43,851 --> 01:38:46,877
Greater good
of the community. OK.

1666
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:50,914
Would that be true in the case
of the now bankrupt...

1667
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:52,653
South River
housing development?

1668
01:38:52,694 --> 01:38:54,127
Yes.

1669
01:38:54,162 --> 01:38:58,531
Tell the court
why the project was abandoned.

1670
01:38:58,566 --> 01:39:00,090
SHAUGHNESSY: There was
a difference of opinion...

1671
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:02,034
as to the costs.

1672
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:04,834
MARTIN: Wasn't there also
a difference of opinion...

1673
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:07,898
between the investors and
the late archbishop himself?

1674
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:10,206
-I don't recall.
-Don't recall?

1675
01:39:10,244 --> 01:39:12,644
Well...

1676
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:15,706
what kind of money
we talking about here?

1677
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:20,287
How much money,
Mr. Shaughnessy...

1678
01:39:20,321 --> 01:39:25,054
was invested in this failed
South River enterprise?

1679
01:39:28,563 --> 01:39:30,053
Sixty million dollars.

1680
01:39:30,098 --> 01:39:32,066
[Spectators gasp]

1681
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:34,227
Sixty million dollars?

1682
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:38,463
Wow, that's a lot of money.

1683
01:39:38,506 --> 01:39:40,440
You and the archbishop
have been friends...

1684
01:39:40,475 --> 01:39:42,409
for, what, 20 years?

1685
01:39:42,443 --> 01:39:44,536
You knew each other really well.

1686
01:39:44,579 --> 01:39:47,707
Were you surprised at
the content of that tape...

1687
01:39:47,749 --> 01:39:49,080
Ms. Venable submitted?

1688
01:39:49,117 --> 01:39:50,084
Of course.

1689
01:39:50,118 --> 01:39:52,177
You never heard
any allegations...

1690
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:54,188
charges against him
during that time?

1691
01:39:54,222 --> 01:39:55,655
Not that I recall.

1692
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:57,954
Especially since you
were State's Attorney...

1693
01:39:57,992 --> 01:39:59,391
for the last 15 years.

1694
01:39:59,427 --> 01:40:01,395
You've supervised
all the prosecutions...

1695
01:40:01,429 --> 01:40:03,329
in Cook County
during that time...

1696
01:40:03,364 --> 01:40:06,265
especially the prosecutions
of all prominent figures.

1697
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:10,168
I also have a thousand
of the best prosecutors.

1698
01:40:10,204 --> 01:40:14,402
But as State's Attorney,
you ultimately decided...

1699
01:40:14,442 --> 01:40:16,706
who would be indicted
and who wouldn't.

1700
01:40:16,744 --> 01:40:18,234
Yes.

1701
01:40:20,448 --> 01:40:23,246
All right,
let me just take you back now.

1702
01:40:23,284 --> 01:40:27,880
Let's go back to June 1985.

1703
01:40:27,922 --> 01:40:30,686
You recall any allegations...

1704
01:40:30,725 --> 01:40:34,183
of sexual misconduct against
the archbishop at that time?

1705
01:40:34,228 --> 01:40:36,128
I don't recall that.

1706
01:40:36,164 --> 01:40:40,760
You recall a young man
named Michael O'Donnell...

1707
01:40:40,802 --> 01:40:45,330
who came to the felony
review unit at your office?

1708
01:40:48,576 --> 01:40:52,603
I have no idea what
you're talking about, counselor.

1709
01:40:52,647 --> 01:40:56,344
It's so confusing.
I have this document here...

1710
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:59,581
from the Chicago
police department...

1711
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,588
that says, uh, yes,
"Michael O'Donnell...

1712
01:41:01,622 --> 01:41:05,820
"spoke to the unit supervisor
over a period of two weeks...

1713
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:07,452
"explaining to him
in graphic detail...

1714
01:41:07,495 --> 01:41:10,430
"sexual abuse he suffered
at the hands of Rushman."

1715
01:41:10,464 --> 01:41:11,658
[Crowd murmurs]

1716
01:41:11,699 --> 01:41:12,893
JUDGE: Quiet.

1717
01:41:12,934 --> 01:41:14,367
MARTIN: lsn't it also true,
Mr. State's Attorney...

1718
01:41:14,402 --> 01:41:17,337
that you then decided your
friend Archbishop Rushman...

1719
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:20,431
was not going to stand trial
for any of it?

1720
01:41:21,442 --> 01:41:23,603
He owed you big-time, John.

1721
01:41:23,644 --> 01:41:27,080
You must've been pissed off when
he pulled out of South River.

1722
01:41:28,115 --> 01:41:31,915
What happened? He just said,
"No! I can't take it"?

1723
01:41:31,953 --> 01:41:34,478
You and your investors--

1724
01:41:34,522 --> 01:41:36,547
sixty million reasons
to kill him.

1725
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:37,717
You little cocksucker.

1726
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:40,090
JUDGE: Witness dismissed.
Court's in recess.

1727
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:41,458
Vail, in my chambers now.

1728
01:41:41,495 --> 01:41:43,861
That's for Joey Pinero,
you little shithead.

1729
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,867
YANCY: Start looking for a job.

1730
01:42:00,748 --> 01:42:02,682
JUDGE: lf you think
you can use my courtroom...

1731
01:42:02,717 --> 01:42:05,379
to wage personal vendettas
and settle old scores...

1732
01:42:05,419 --> 01:42:06,977
you are sorely mistaken.

1733
01:42:07,021 --> 01:42:09,387
I'm striking Shaughnessy's
testimony from the record...

1734
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:12,790
as irrelevant
and holding you in contempt...

1735
01:42:12,827 --> 01:42:14,795
to the tune of $10,000.

1736
01:42:14,829 --> 01:42:16,023
MARTIN: So you're telling me...

1737
01:42:16,063 --> 01:42:18,793
I can't get a fair trial
in your courtroom?

1738
01:42:18,833 --> 01:42:22,166
Be very, very careful.
You're on dangerous ground.

1739
01:42:22,203 --> 01:42:24,797
Shall I make that check
out to you?

1740
01:42:24,839 --> 01:42:26,466
Shall I take you off this case?

1741
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:29,408
You're making a mockery
of my courtroom...

1742
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:31,070
and I am not going to allow it.

1743
01:42:31,112 --> 01:42:34,081
I suggest you start
representing your client...

1744
01:42:34,115 --> 01:42:36,948
and stop representing yourself.

1745
01:42:45,693 --> 01:42:47,160
AARON: Do this later?

1746
01:42:47,194 --> 01:42:50,163
ARRINGTON: No,
let's stay with this a minute.

1747
01:42:50,197 --> 01:42:52,757
AARON: I just--
I'm feeling ver-very tired.

1748
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,568
ARRINGTON: Yeah, I know.

1749
01:42:54,568 --> 01:42:55,720
Why does talking about
Linda Forbes upset you?

1750
01:42:57,955 --> 01:43:01,152
AARON:
It d--it doesn't. I just--

1751
01:43:01,192 --> 01:43:02,318
ARRINGTON: OK.

1752
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:05,488
AARON: S-sorry, I'm sorry.

1753
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:10,599
ARRINGTON: You know what
I can do with this thing?

1754
01:43:10,635 --> 01:43:12,728
How the fuck
should I know?

1755
01:43:21,012 --> 01:43:23,981
MARTIN: Dr. Arrington,
how much time have you spent...

1756
01:43:24,015 --> 01:43:25,482
with Aaron Stampler?

1757
01:43:25,516 --> 01:43:27,211
Around 60 hours.

1758
01:43:27,251 --> 01:43:30,220
MARTIN: What did you find
during your evaluation?

1759
01:43:30,254 --> 01:43:32,051
ARRINGTON:
I found Mr. Stampler suffers...

1760
01:43:32,089 --> 01:43:33,920
from an acute
disassociative condition--

1761
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:36,392
specifically,
multiple personality disorder.

1762
01:43:36,427 --> 01:43:38,224
JANET: Objection, Your Honor.

1763
01:43:38,262 --> 01:43:40,822
Dr. Arrington's only stating
what she's observed.

1764
01:43:40,865 --> 01:43:42,230
JANET: Your Honor?

1765
01:43:42,266 --> 01:43:44,131
JUDGE: Counselors.

1766
01:43:44,168 --> 01:43:46,033
JANET: Now I know
what you're doing.

1767
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:47,970
JUDGE: Will you
excuse us for a minute?

1768
01:43:49,907 --> 01:43:53,035
JANET: lf he wants to question
his client's sanity--

1769
01:43:53,077 --> 01:43:55,978
I'm trying to establish
a medical basis for amnesia.

1770
01:43:56,013 --> 01:43:59,107
JANET:
No. He's saying he's crazy.

1771
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:00,879
JUDGE: Are you?

1772
01:44:00,918 --> 01:44:02,385
No, I am not.

1773
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:06,857
I will allow you to proceed
if you're very, very careful.

1774
01:44:06,891 --> 01:44:09,189
Absolutely.

1775
01:44:09,226 --> 01:44:10,215
Yes.

1776
01:44:10,261 --> 01:44:12,195
JUDGE:
Write down that he said that.

1777
01:44:13,230 --> 01:44:16,199
MARTIN:
All right, where were we?

1778
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:24,900
Now, could Aaron Stampler
have been present...

1779
01:44:24,942 --> 01:44:27,968
during the murder
of Archbishop Rushman...

1780
01:44:28,012 --> 01:44:29,138
and not remember it?

1781
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:32,115
-Yes, he could.
-Could you explain that?

1782
01:44:32,149 --> 01:44:35,607
ARRINGTON: His state at that
time was such that his body...

1783
01:44:35,653 --> 01:44:37,621
could be present
at a homicide...

1784
01:44:37,655 --> 01:44:40,146
yet his mind
would be unable to recall it.

1785
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:42,557
MARTIN:
And how is that possible?

1786
01:44:42,593 --> 01:44:45,323
The neurological mechanism
making this possible...

1787
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:48,764
began with the early abuse
suffered from his father.

1788
01:44:48,799 --> 01:44:50,232
In defense,
Aaron's psyche splintered...

1789
01:44:50,267 --> 01:44:52,497
and helped him to create
two separate personalities.

1790
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:54,766
-Your Honor.
-Mr. Vail.

1791
01:44:54,805 --> 01:44:56,329
I didn't say it.

1792
01:44:56,374 --> 01:45:00,140
JUDGE: You have been warned.
Do you want to pursue this?

1793
01:45:00,177 --> 01:45:02,543
I suggest you think long
and hard before answering.

1794
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:09,014
Your Honor,
just one last question.

1795
01:45:13,424 --> 01:45:16,484
All right, Dr. Arrington...

1796
01:45:16,527 --> 01:45:19,223
in your opinion...

1797
01:45:19,263 --> 01:45:22,426
is Aaron Stampler
capable of murder?

1798
01:45:22,466 --> 01:45:24,832
No, he is not.
He's far too traumatized...

1799
01:45:24,869 --> 01:45:26,666
to express normal anger
and frustration.

1800
01:45:26,704 --> 01:45:28,672
He keeps his emotions
repressed.

1801
01:45:28,706 --> 01:45:31,436
Which is why he created Roy,
who is capable of such crimes.

1802
01:45:31,475 --> 01:45:32,942
Objection, Your Honor!

1803
01:45:32,977 --> 01:45:34,410
JUDGE:
That's enough, Mr. Vail.

1804
01:45:34,445 --> 01:45:36,413
The jury will disregard
that last statement...

1805
01:45:36,447 --> 01:45:38,677
as will the court.

1806
01:45:38,716 --> 01:45:40,707
Madam prosecutor,
do you wish to cross?

1807
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:42,275
You bet I do.

1808
01:45:43,854 --> 01:45:46,982
Since you brought it up, against
the court's instructions...

1809
01:45:47,024 --> 01:45:50,482
I'm curious to know, is
multiple personality disorder...

1810
01:45:50,528 --> 01:45:52,496
your primary area of expertise?

1811
01:45:52,530 --> 01:45:54,998
It's not my primary field, no.

1812
01:45:55,032 --> 01:45:58,559
Is forensic psychiatry
your primary area of expertise?

1813
01:45:58,602 --> 01:46:00,763
No, I'm a neuropsychologist.

1814
01:46:00,805 --> 01:46:04,673
I see. So, you have
no forensic experience...

1815
01:46:04,708 --> 01:46:07,973
and you're more of,
oh, let's say, an academic.

1816
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:12,878
Then you will forgive
this rather academic question.

1817
01:46:12,917 --> 01:46:15,886
I'm driving,
somebody cuts me off.

1818
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,388
I think,
"l could just kill that guy."

1819
01:46:18,422 --> 01:46:19,980
But I don't, do I?

1820
01:46:20,024 --> 01:46:22,254
-I'd hope not.
-That's right.

1821
01:46:22,293 --> 01:46:25,262
Things happen to us.
People wrong us.

1822
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:28,231
But we don't all go around
inventing psychopaths...

1823
01:46:28,265 --> 01:46:30,733
to do our dirty work
for us, do we?

1824
01:46:30,768 --> 01:46:33,737
I'm not suggesting you suffer
from multiple personality.

1825
01:46:33,771 --> 01:46:35,261
I'm saying Mr. Stampler does.

1826
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:38,173
Yes, we heard.

1827
01:46:38,209 --> 01:46:42,407
You've also testified
that you have met this...

1828
01:46:42,446 --> 01:46:44,414
What was his name again?

1829
01:46:44,448 --> 01:46:46,245
-Roy.
-Roy what?

1830
01:46:46,283 --> 01:46:48,217
He didn't give a last name.

1831
01:46:48,252 --> 01:46:49,719
I see.

1832
01:46:49,753 --> 01:46:53,189
Did Roy tell you he had
murdered the archbishop?

1833
01:46:53,224 --> 01:46:54,782
Mr. Vail was alone
with him at the time.

1834
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:55,917
I was watching
through the window.

1835
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:57,860
But afterwards,
I was in the room...

1836
01:46:57,895 --> 01:47:02,423
and saw both Roy and his
transformation back into Aaron.

1837
01:47:02,466 --> 01:47:07,631
Did you happen to tape
this appearance of Aaron--

1838
01:47:08,739 --> 01:47:10,206
Oh, I'm sorry.

1839
01:47:10,241 --> 01:47:13,733
I'm sorry. I just cannot
get used to this name.

1840
01:47:13,777 --> 01:47:15,210
ARRINGTON: Roy.

1841
01:47:15,246 --> 01:47:16,736
Did you?

1842
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:19,271
No, the tape was off.

1843
01:47:19,316 --> 01:47:20,544
Off?

1844
01:47:22,686 --> 01:47:28,215
So, you have no record
whatsoever of his appearance.

1845
01:47:28,259 --> 01:47:30,227
-No.
-No.

1846
01:47:32,062 --> 01:47:34,656
JANET: Does Aaron Stampler
know right from wrong?

1847
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:35,960
Yes, he does.

1848
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,094
If he butchered the archbishop,
would he know--

1849
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:40,262
MARTIN: Objection.

1850
01:47:40,304 --> 01:47:42,932
If Aaron Stampler
murdered the archbishop...

1851
01:47:42,973 --> 01:47:45,339
would he know
he'd broken the law?

1852
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:48,004
Yes, he would,
but Aaron didn't kill--

1853
01:47:48,045 --> 01:47:52,004
Oh, yes, I know, Doctor.
It was Roy.

1854
01:47:55,152 --> 01:47:56,210
That's all.

1855
01:47:56,253 --> 01:47:58,346
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1856
01:47:58,389 --> 01:48:00,357
JUDGE: Witness may step down.

1857
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:03,155
If you'd like to reopen
the prosecution's case...

1858
01:48:03,193 --> 01:48:05,161
and call
the State's psychiatrist...

1859
01:48:05,195 --> 01:48:06,628
I'd certainly agree to it.

1860
01:48:06,664 --> 01:48:09,360
No, I don't think
that's necessary.

1861
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,630
I think
we all get the picture here.

1862
01:48:12,903 --> 01:48:15,804
JUDGE: Mr. Vail,
are you ready to proceed?

1863
01:48:18,956 --> 01:48:20,514
Would you like a recess?

1864
01:48:49,854 --> 01:48:51,344
[Alarm chirps]

1865
01:49:25,156 --> 01:49:26,453
Roy?

1866
01:49:28,559 --> 01:49:29,719
Aaron.

1867
01:49:33,598 --> 01:49:34,724
Could you tell us
a little about...

1868
01:49:34,765 --> 01:49:37,325
your relationship
with Archbishop Rushman?

1869
01:49:38,035 --> 01:49:40,833
AARON:
He wa-was like a father to me.

1870
01:49:40,871 --> 01:49:42,896
I l-loved him very much.

1871
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:44,100
MARTIN: Why did you love him?

1872
01:49:45,309 --> 01:49:46,776
-Why?
-Uh-huh.

1873
01:49:48,079 --> 01:49:51,480
Well, he s-saved my life...

1874
01:49:51,515 --> 01:49:55,849
and he was the only person
that e-ever treated me...

1875
01:49:55,886 --> 01:49:57,217
Iike I was worth anything.

1876
01:49:57,255 --> 01:49:59,815
Stop your whining, little girl.
Be a man.

1877
01:50:03,394 --> 01:50:07,057
MARTIN: We've all seen that
tape that you were in, Aaron.

1878
01:50:08,232 --> 01:50:09,665
How did that make you feel?

1879
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:12,464
Did it change your feelings
about Archbishop Rushman?

1880
01:50:12,503 --> 01:50:14,596
AARON: N-no. Uh-uh.

1881
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:17,802
He was a w-wonderful man.

1882
01:50:17,842 --> 01:50:19,673
MARTIN: You didn't feel anger
towards him...

1883
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:22,372
about being forced to perform
in that tape?

1884
01:50:22,413 --> 01:50:26,076
AARON:
No. H-he did everything for me.

1885
01:50:26,117 --> 01:50:28,608
There wasn't nothing else
I could do for him...

1886
01:50:28,653 --> 01:50:29,779
and h-he needed it.

1887
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:32,721
Do you know someone named Roy?

1888
01:50:34,992 --> 01:50:36,118
No. No, I don't.

1889
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:38,594
MARTIN: You heard
Dr. Arrington's testimony...

1890
01:50:38,629 --> 01:50:42,360
about what she and I saw there
at the jail.

1891
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,631
Some pretty strange things
going on there, you remember?

1892
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:48,298
I heard what she said, but
I don't remember any of that.

1893
01:50:48,339 --> 01:50:50,000
-No recollection?
-No, sir.

1894
01:50:50,041 --> 01:50:51,668
Did you kill Archbishop Rushman?

1895
01:50:54,278 --> 01:50:56,906
AARON: N-no, sir. I did not.

1896
01:51:01,986 --> 01:51:03,146
MARTIN: Thank you.

1897
01:51:06,123 --> 01:51:07,420
Your witness.

1898
01:51:15,132 --> 01:51:17,100
JANET: Mr. Stampler,
would you like some water?

1899
01:51:21,472 --> 01:51:23,838
AARON: No. No. No, ma'am.

1900
01:51:23,874 --> 01:51:25,341
You sure?

1901
01:51:26,210 --> 01:51:28,576
Ye-yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.

1902
01:51:36,087 --> 01:51:40,524
Mr. Stampler, did you believe
that the archbishop wore masks?

1903
01:51:43,394 --> 01:51:45,362
I'm--I'm sorry.
What did you say?

1904
01:51:45,396 --> 01:51:48,092
JANET: Do you think he acted
one way in public...

1905
01:51:48,132 --> 01:51:50,692
and another way in private?

1906
01:51:50,735 --> 01:51:53,431
AARON: No, I didn't think that.

1907
01:51:53,471 --> 01:51:56,565
Wasn't that why you underlined
the Hawthorne passage?

1908
01:51:58,242 --> 01:51:59,732
JANET: Mr. Stampler?

1909
01:52:02,646 --> 01:52:05,046
No.
I did not underline that book.

1910
01:52:05,082 --> 01:52:07,050
JANET: You didn't underline it?

1911
01:52:07,084 --> 01:52:08,051
No, ma'am.

1912
01:52:08,085 --> 01:52:09,313
And you didn't carve numbers...

1913
01:52:09,353 --> 01:52:11,685
referring to that passage
into his chest?

1914
01:52:11,722 --> 01:52:13,952
AARON: No, ma'am, I did not.

1915
01:52:13,991 --> 01:52:15,515
I t-told you l--

1916
01:52:15,559 --> 01:52:16,992
You loved him.

1917
01:52:18,396 --> 01:52:19,886
JANET:
You loved him like a father.

1918
01:52:21,065 --> 01:52:23,966
Even though he made
you and your girlfriend...

1919
01:52:24,001 --> 01:52:28,529
perform demeaning sexual acts
for his own gratification?

1920
01:52:28,572 --> 01:52:29,834
No, you don't understand.

1921
01:52:29,874 --> 01:52:33,037
H-he--There was no other way...

1922
01:52:33,077 --> 01:52:35,739
for him to cast out
his own demons.

1923
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:38,374
-He needed it.
-He needed to get off!

1924
01:52:38,416 --> 01:52:41,874
That's what he was doing.
That's what he needed you for--

1925
01:52:41,919 --> 01:52:43,944
to perform like a circus animal.

1926
01:52:43,988 --> 01:52:45,546
That was your function
in his life.

1927
01:52:45,589 --> 01:52:46,715
AARON: No. No.

1928
01:52:46,757 --> 01:52:49,157
JANET: Mr. Stampler,
I'm going to ask you straight...

1929
01:52:49,193 --> 01:52:50,592
because I am tired...

1930
01:52:50,628 --> 01:52:53,893
and I've had all I can take
of this sordidness.

1931
01:52:53,931 --> 01:52:56,593
I want to go home
and wash my hands...

1932
01:52:56,634 --> 01:53:01,094
and forget all about
you and Archbishop Rushman.

1933
01:53:01,138 --> 01:53:03,106
Did the archbishop force you...

1934
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:04,698
and your girlfriend
and others...

1935
01:53:04,742 --> 01:53:08,974
to perform sexual acts
while he watched--yes or no?

1936
01:53:10,748 --> 01:53:14,616
-No--Yes, he did, but--
-Yes, he forced you.

1937
01:53:14,652 --> 01:53:16,085
He forced you...

1938
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:18,953
by threatening expulsion
from Savior House...

1939
01:53:18,989 --> 01:53:23,688
and a life on the street with
no heat, no water, and no food.

1940
01:53:23,727 --> 01:53:25,718
He put you
in front of a camera...

1941
01:53:25,763 --> 01:53:27,196
he made you take off
your clothes...

1942
01:53:27,231 --> 01:53:30,632
and you don't think
that's another side...

1943
01:53:30,668 --> 01:53:32,602
another face of a man
we thought we knew?

1944
01:53:32,636 --> 01:53:33,762
AARON: No!

1945
01:53:33,804 --> 01:53:35,704
JANET:
lf someone did that to me...

1946
01:53:35,739 --> 01:53:37,468
I'd kill him.
I wouldn't hesitate.

1947
01:53:37,508 --> 01:53:40,875
I would stab him
78 times with a knife.

1948
01:53:40,911 --> 01:53:43,471
I would chop off his fingers.
I would slash his throat open.

1949
01:53:43,514 --> 01:53:45,744
I would carve numbers
into his chest.

1950
01:53:45,783 --> 01:53:48,946
I'd gouge out his eyes,
I swear to God.

1951
01:53:50,321 --> 01:53:51,948
But that's me.

1952
01:54:01,065 --> 01:54:02,555
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1953
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:04,761
-Where the hell are you going?
-Excuse me?

1954
01:54:04,802 --> 01:54:06,599
You look at me
when I'm talking to you, bitch!

1955
01:54:06,637 --> 01:54:08,264
JUDGE: Mr. Stampler!

1956
01:54:08,305 --> 01:54:09,670
ROY:
Fuck you, lady! Come here!

1957
01:54:10,374 --> 01:54:11,534
JUDGE: Bailiff! Order!

1958
01:54:12,676 --> 01:54:15,110
ROY: You want to play rough?
Let's play rough.

1959
01:54:15,145 --> 01:54:17,306
Come on. Back off! Back off!

1960
01:54:17,348 --> 01:54:19,009
MARTIN: Roy, take it easy!

1961
01:54:19,049 --> 01:54:21,745
ROY: Keep coming, asshole!
I'll break her fucking neck!

1962
01:54:21,785 --> 01:54:23,184
MARTIN: Roy, come here.

1963
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:25,415
ROY: Fuck you. I'm walking
out of here real slow.

1964
01:54:29,627 --> 01:54:31,288
ROY: No! No!

1965
01:54:31,328 --> 01:54:33,796
No! Now, don't you--

1966
01:54:35,466 --> 01:54:36,694
No!

1967
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:43,831
-You OK?
-Yeah. I'm OK.

1968
01:55:11,308 --> 01:55:13,970
JUDGE: Don't even think
of lighting that cigarette.

1969
01:55:19,950 --> 01:55:21,144
JUDGE: How's your neck?

1970
01:55:21,184 --> 01:55:22,845
I'll live.

1971
01:55:22,886 --> 01:55:24,717
-I could call a doctor.
-Mm-mmm.

1972
01:55:25,589 --> 01:55:28,023
JUDGE: Mr. Shaughnessy
just called to inform me...

1973
01:55:28,058 --> 01:55:30,185
there will be no mistrial.

1974
01:55:30,227 --> 01:55:31,694
As if that was his right.

1975
01:55:31,728 --> 01:55:35,164
MARTIN: Can't believe that
scumbag has the balls to call.

1976
01:55:35,198 --> 01:55:36,961
No. Thanks.

1977
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,127
JUDGE: What matters to me
is what you have to say.

1978
01:55:39,169 --> 01:55:42,627
Obviously,
your case has been damaged.

1979
01:55:43,540 --> 01:55:46,168
In fairness to the prosecution,
I will declare a mistrial...

1980
01:55:46,209 --> 01:55:49,110
regardless of what
Shaughnessy and Vail think...

1981
01:55:49,146 --> 01:55:50,613
if that's what you want.

1982
01:55:50,647 --> 01:55:52,410
The prosecution doesn't want
to try this case again...

1983
01:55:52,449 --> 01:55:53,916
even if it could.

1984
01:55:53,950 --> 01:55:57,147
Which it can't,
at least not by me.

1985
01:55:57,187 --> 01:55:58,950
And I think
I can guarantee you...

1986
01:55:58,989 --> 01:56:02,447
no one
in the D.A.'s Office will, so...

1987
01:56:03,827 --> 01:56:04,987
it's up to you.

1988
01:56:05,028 --> 01:56:08,361
I'm dismissing the jury
in favor of a bench trial...

1989
01:56:08,398 --> 01:56:11,299
and a plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity. Yes?

1990
01:56:11,334 --> 01:56:12,528
MARTIN: Yeah.

1991
01:56:12,569 --> 01:56:14,594
JUDGE: The defendant
will be remanded to Elgin...

1992
01:56:14,638 --> 01:56:16,606
for an evaluation period
of 30 days.

1993
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:18,835
Let them decide the term
of his commitment.

1994
01:56:18,875 --> 01:56:20,274
Any problem with that?

1995
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:22,301
JANET: Your honor,
he'll be out in a month.

1996
01:56:22,345 --> 01:56:24,540
JUDGE: Take it up
with the legislature.

1997
01:56:28,085 --> 01:56:29,518
JUDGE: I'm going home.

1998
01:56:34,724 --> 01:56:36,453
MARTIN: Your Honor...

1999
01:56:36,493 --> 01:56:38,757
JUDGE: No, I'm not refunding
your contempt fine.

2000
01:56:38,795 --> 01:56:41,992
And the next time you want
a client off on insanity...

2001
01:56:42,032 --> 01:56:45,126
you plead that way,
or I'll have you disbarred.

2002
01:57:13,897 --> 01:57:15,057
You OK?

2003
01:57:16,366 --> 01:57:18,732
Am I OK? Do I seem OK?

2004
01:57:18,768 --> 01:57:21,168
I get attacked
by this sick twist.

2005
01:57:21,204 --> 01:57:22,603
I've lost the case.
I'm out of a job.

2006
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:24,630
No, Marty,
I'm not particularly OK...

2007
01:57:24,674 --> 01:57:27,507
but, hey, you won.
Justice was done.

2008
01:57:27,544 --> 01:57:28,943
Who the hell cares, right?

2009
01:57:30,847 --> 01:57:32,007
Congratulations.

2010
01:57:38,922 --> 01:57:40,685
You knew, didn't you?

2011
01:57:40,724 --> 01:57:43,784
You knew if I went after him,
he'd wig out up there.

2012
01:57:43,827 --> 01:57:47,593
I knew he'd come out
if he was threatened.

2013
01:57:47,631 --> 01:57:49,599
And who better to do that
than me?

2014
01:57:51,301 --> 01:57:52,791
You used me.

2015
01:57:56,673 --> 01:57:59,369
Yeah, I did. I had no choice.

2016
01:58:01,645 --> 01:58:05,513
What did I use
that was so terrible?

2017
01:58:05,549 --> 01:58:06,880
I knew you'd do your job.

2018
01:58:06,917 --> 01:58:08,851
I knew you'd stand up
to Shaughnessy.

2019
01:58:08,885 --> 01:58:10,853
I knew you'd try to win
the case.

2020
01:58:10,887 --> 01:58:12,354
What's wrong with that?

2021
01:58:12,389 --> 01:58:14,448
I lost my fucking job.

2022
01:58:14,491 --> 01:58:16,152
You should have left years ago.

2023
01:58:16,193 --> 01:58:18,957
JANET: Why do you think
you know what's right for me?

2024
01:58:18,995 --> 01:58:20,394
Because I'm arrogant.

2025
01:58:22,866 --> 01:58:23,992
I'm very...

2026
01:58:25,835 --> 01:58:27,302
very arrogant.

2027
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:40,247
-Want to dance?
-No.

2028
01:58:42,285 --> 01:58:43,650
-You sure?
-Yeah.

2029
01:58:46,856 --> 01:58:48,687
MARTIN: All you have to do
is turn around.

2030
01:58:54,864 --> 01:58:55,922
JANET: No.

2031
01:58:55,966 --> 01:58:57,092
[Martin humming]

2032
01:58:57,133 --> 01:58:58,293
JANET: No.

2033
01:59:08,845 --> 01:59:10,312
MARTIN:
I have to see my client.

2034
01:59:53,957 --> 01:59:55,584
MARTIN:
I'd like a minute alone.

2035
01:59:55,625 --> 01:59:57,320
GUARD: Are you sure?

2036
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:58,520
Yeah. I'm sure.

2037
02:00:10,273 --> 02:00:11,433
MARTIN: You OK?

2038
02:00:15,445 --> 02:00:17,003
AARON: My--my head hurts.

2039
02:00:18,548 --> 02:00:20,675
You don't remember
what just happened?

2040
02:00:23,653 --> 02:00:25,518
No?

2041
02:00:25,555 --> 02:00:29,548
AARON:
No. I lo-lo-lost time again.

2042
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:32,751
Well, I got some good news.

2043
02:00:34,264 --> 02:00:36,198
They've agreed to stop
the trial.

2044
02:00:36,232 --> 02:00:38,325
They're going
to send you to a hospital.

2045
02:00:39,569 --> 02:00:40,934
You can get the help you need.

2046
02:00:43,139 --> 02:00:45,801
And there's
a very good chance...

2047
02:00:45,842 --> 02:00:47,867
you can get out someday soon.

2048
02:00:51,247 --> 02:00:52,714
Yeah.

2049
02:00:56,953 --> 02:00:59,114
AARON:
I ca--I can't believe it.

2050
02:00:59,155 --> 02:01:01,851
I don--don't know
what to say, Mr. Vail.

2051
02:01:01,891 --> 02:01:03,688
MARTIN:
That's all right, Aaron.

2052
02:01:03,727 --> 02:01:06,992
I knew the minute
you came into my cell.

2053
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:09,294
I knew everything
was going to be OK.

2054
02:01:09,332 --> 02:01:12,233
You sa--You saved my life.

2055
02:01:16,306 --> 02:01:17,466
MARTIN: Yeah.

2056
02:01:18,908 --> 02:01:20,466
I got to go.

2057
02:01:23,313 --> 02:01:26,373
Wh-when will I see you again?

2058
02:01:26,416 --> 02:01:27,974
That's up to the courts now.

2059
02:01:29,519 --> 02:01:31,146
I don't want you to worry.

2060
02:01:31,187 --> 02:01:33,519
I'm going to stay
on top of this, OK?

2061
02:01:40,063 --> 02:01:41,223
AARON: Thank you.

2062
02:01:42,932 --> 02:01:45,696
All right. You give me a call
if you need to, OK?

2063
02:01:45,735 --> 02:01:47,498
-I will.
-All right.

2064
02:01:50,373 --> 02:01:52,432
-Hey, Mr. Vail?
-Yeah.

2065
02:01:52,475 --> 02:01:58,607
Um, will you t-tell
Ms. Venable I'm sorry?

2066
02:02:00,049 --> 02:02:03,109
T-tell her I hope
her neck is--is OK.

2067
02:02:04,254 --> 02:02:05,414
MARTIN: Yeah.

2068
02:02:22,457 --> 02:02:23,822
MARTIN: What did you just say?

2069
02:02:24,959 --> 02:02:26,119
AARON: What?

2070
02:02:27,328 --> 02:02:30,354
You told me you don't remember,
that you black out.

2071
02:02:33,901 --> 02:02:36,199
So how do you know
about her neck?

2072
02:02:37,805 --> 02:02:39,102
AARON: Um...

2073
02:02:51,352 --> 02:02:54,913
Well, good for you, Marty.

2074
02:02:56,657 --> 02:02:58,386
I was going to let it go.

2075
02:02:58,426 --> 02:03:00,326
You was looking so happy
just now...

2076
02:03:00,361 --> 02:03:03,159
I was thinking, "Mmm."

2077
02:03:03,197 --> 02:03:05,688
But to tell you the truth,
I'm glad you figured it...

2078
02:03:05,733 --> 02:03:09,260
'cause I have been
dying to tell you.

2079
02:03:09,303 --> 02:03:12,067
I just didn't know
who you'd want to hear it from--

2080
02:03:12,106 --> 02:03:14,165
Aaron or Roy or Roy or Aaron.

2081
02:03:14,208 --> 02:03:16,870
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

2082
02:03:16,911 --> 02:03:20,074
A client/attorney
privilege secret.

2083
02:03:20,114 --> 02:03:21,274
MARTIN: Uh-huh.

2084
02:03:21,315 --> 02:03:24,216
It don't matter
who you hear it from.

2085
02:03:24,252 --> 02:03:25,844
It's the same story.

2086
02:03:29,657 --> 02:03:35,357
I--I j-just had to kill Linda,
Mr. Vail.

2087
02:03:36,731 --> 02:03:39,063
Th-that cunt
just got what she deserved.

2088
02:03:42,537 --> 02:03:44,664
But...

2089
02:03:44,705 --> 02:03:46,832
cutting up
that son of a bitch Rushman?

2090
02:03:48,476 --> 02:03:50,876
That was just
a fucking work of art.

2091
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:52,903
[Laughs]

2092
02:03:59,921 --> 02:04:02,219
You're good.
You are really good.

2093
02:04:03,224 --> 02:04:05,158
Yeah. I did get caught
though, didn't I?

2094
02:04:05,193 --> 02:04:06,353
Mmm.

2095
02:04:10,031 --> 02:04:11,521
So there never...

2096
02:04:12,633 --> 02:04:14,464
There never was a Roy?

2097
02:04:15,570 --> 02:04:18,437
Jesus Christ, Marty.
If that's what you think...

2098
02:04:18,472 --> 02:04:21,032
I am disappointed in you,
I don't mind telling you.

2099
02:04:23,978 --> 02:04:26,071
There never was...

2100
02:04:26,113 --> 02:04:27,808
an Aaron...

2101
02:04:27,848 --> 02:04:29,008
counselor.

2102
02:04:37,058 --> 02:04:39,856
Come on, Marty, I thought
you had it figured at the end.

2103
02:04:39,894 --> 02:04:43,227
Putting me on the stand
was fucking brilliant.

2104
02:04:43,264 --> 02:04:45,255
And that whole "Act like a man"?

2105
02:04:45,299 --> 02:04:46,891
Jesus, I knew exactly
what you wanted from me...

2106
02:04:46,934 --> 02:04:49,664
it was like
we were dancing, Marty.

2107
02:04:49,704 --> 02:04:52,104
-Guard.
-Don't be like that, Marty.

2108
02:04:53,407 --> 02:04:56,376
We did it, man.
We fucking did it.

2109
02:04:56,410 --> 02:04:58,674
We're a great team, you and me.

2110
02:04:58,713 --> 02:05:01,113
You think I could have
done this without you?

2111
02:05:01,148 --> 02:05:02,706
You're feeling
a little anger here...

2112
02:05:02,750 --> 02:05:04,479
because you started
to care about Aaron.

2113
02:05:04,518 --> 02:05:06,418
I can understand that, but...

2114
02:05:07,588 --> 02:05:09,613
Iove hurts, Marty.
What can I say?

2115
02:05:10,658 --> 02:05:14,116
I'm just kidding! I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings!

2116
02:05:14,161 --> 02:05:16,959
What else was I supposed to do?

2117
02:05:16,998 --> 02:05:18,727
Hey, you'll thank me
down the road...

2118
02:05:18,766 --> 02:05:21,997
'cause this is going
to toughen you up, Martin Vail!

2119
02:05:22,036 --> 02:05:23,560
You hear me?

2120
02:05:23,604 --> 02:05:25,094
That's a promise!
