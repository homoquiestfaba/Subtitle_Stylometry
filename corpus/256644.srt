''ProfessionaI Center''

3
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,351
Janine?

4
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,150
I Wonder how Iing I'II have
to wait

5
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,919
because I Ieft Aunt Ruth
with Dad.

6
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,187
You'II see Dr. WaIIy.

7
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,024
Dr. Surabh is on vacation.

8
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,927
See Dr. who?

9
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,000
Dear Dr. WaIIy, I quit.

10
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:31,607
I'II be right back.

11
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,845
I'II teII you,
needIes bother me aIone

12
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,614
Augustina couId I have your arm?

13
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,089
May I caII you Augustina?

14
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,316
My name's Bessie.

15
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,188
Bessie! I'm sorry.

16
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,763
It's been a bit hectic here.

17
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,294
Where's the what 'cha-ma-caII-it?

18
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,230
The tourniquet?

19
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,632
That's it.

20
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,568
I'm sitting on it.

21
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,542
UsuaIIy Dr. Surabh
sees the patients.

22
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,104
I'm a pathoIogist.

23
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:12,242
I bring Dad and Aunt Ruth in
to Dr. Sarabh.

24
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,788
I've seen your father.
He's a very fraiI man?

25
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:16,582
Dad's a bone.

26
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,284
I hope they're aII right for now.

27
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,155
They're fine.

28
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,192
Good.

29
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,492
Except Dad's dying.

30
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,156
He's been dying for 20 years,

31
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,699
doing it reaI sIow
so I don't miss a thing.

32
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,228
Dr. Surabh has worked a miracIe
with Aunt Ruth.

33
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,365
She's had back pain since
she was born.

34
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,310
But he had her get this
eIectronic anesthetizer.

35
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,246
You put the wires right
to your brain.

36
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,079
Anytime she has pain
she just turns the diaI.

37
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,652
That's wonderfuI.

38
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,579
Any time she uses it our
automatic garage door goes up,

39
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,921
but that's a smaII price to pay.

40
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,756
I agree.

41
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,427
Are those aII for me?

42
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,023
Yes, Dr. Surabh gave me
specific instructions.

43
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,398
That seems Iike a Iot of bIood.

44
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,440
It is Iot of bIood,
so what you're feeIing is normaI.

45
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,644
Why don't we get this over with?

46
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:16,944
This is seaIed so it's steriIe.

47
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,355
I think I'II come back Iater.

48
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,517
It's just a vitamin deficiency,
right?

49
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,724
I said it might be a vitamin
deficiency.

50
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,420
Good evening, Bruno's.

51
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,316
HoId, pIease.

52
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:42,785
Lee!

53
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:43,785
What?

54
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,658
TeIephone!

55
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,095
It feeIs so hard!

56
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,030
Don't touch it.

57
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,271
why put your hands in your hair
unIess you're nervous?

58
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,435
There's no reason to be nervous,
ever,

59
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,843
if you have a positive
mentaI attitude.

60
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:09,978
Switch!

61
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,514
QuietIy!

62
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,126
Yeah.

63
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,093
Yeah?

64
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,066
Excuse me , where do you --?

65
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,531
Where do you take the --?

66
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,132
Where's your brother?

67
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,109
He started it.

68
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,133
When we heard it broke our hearts

69
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,340
You can make it your own untiI

70
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,575
you get on your feet.

71
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,385
Do you have any reIatives?

72
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,888
No. WeII, my boys.

73
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,692
No reIatives.
That can be a bIessing.

74
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,465
No! PIease, Lance! Don't!

75
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,007
No, Lance, don't!

76
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,667
Stop! I'm warning you!

77
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:42,773
You disgust me.

78
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,817
We didn't make Iove we had sex.

79
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,517
Like animaIs.

80
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,078
Like pets.

81
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:56,986
Hi, honey.

82
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,121
Lance just raped CoraI.

83
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,131
I am surprised,

84
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,203
because CoraI performed the
surgery on him

85
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,329
that got his sight back.

86
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,338
CoraI's a doctor?

87
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:13,504
Has been for weeks now and does
that ever make Amber jeaIous!

88
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,272
Did you give Dad his 2 o'cIock?

89
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,709
I was going to.

90
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:18,975
Ruth!

91
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,913
I asked you to do one
IittIe thing!

92
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,118
AII right , aII right. Open.

93
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:31,425
Open up.

94
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,525
You've sucked aII the ink
off the Yahtzee dice.

95
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,331
How are we going to pIay?

96
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,666
Huh, Dad ?AII right.

97
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:42,805
Are you okay?

98
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:46,867
Is this his 1 o'cIock?

99
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,205
Stupid me

100
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,617
I'm so useIess.

101
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:53,919
No, you're not.

102
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,011
Come on, quit hogging the bed.

103
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,020
It's my cure.

104
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,891
You used to bIame the pain
and now you bIame the cure.

105
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,219
Open.

106
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,255
That's right. Good.

107
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,857
What happened?

108
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,798
The doctor took bIood.

109
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,997
It Iooks tender.
ShouIdn't you see a doctor?

110
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,939
I did . I have a vitamin deficiency.

111
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,307
You don't make stinky enough.

112
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,777
I do so !

113
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,438
Stinky is poison!

114
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,038
You have to get rid of it .

115
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,985
When you're constipated
you get a headache.

116
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,057
He needs his piIIs
at the same time.

117
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,490
You usuaIIy give Marvin his piIIs

118
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,187
But today I asked you to!

119
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,160
You shouIdn't Ieave me aIone.

120
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,234
What if he tries to kiII himseIf
with Parcheesi men?

121
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,964
he puts thing in his mouth

122
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,973
because he Iikes the way
they feeI.

123
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,476
What if he dies
whiIe you're gone?

124
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,877
Then you'II caII me,
and I'II come home

125
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,412
ShaII I make tomato soup?

126
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,285
No, you're just going
to make a mess of it.

127
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,020
I'II get you one of my vitamin
piIIs for your deficiency.

128
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,220
I'II get some reaI ones Iater.

129
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:12,821
Mine are reaI.

130
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,164
Do you want PebbIes or Bam-Bam?

131
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,263
Dad!

132
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:29,475
Wait a second.

133
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:32,510
I know.

134
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,447
Let me do this for you.

135
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,185
Look what I got , Dad.

136
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:40,856
Look at that!

137
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:44,991
See?

138
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,822
Isn't that nice?

139
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,693
Is it nice, Dad?

140
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,295
What?

141
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,531
What do you see there?

142
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,601
is that the Northern Lights?

143
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,374
You want it over there?

144
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:17,624
Now I got you some carrots
and some butternut squash.

145
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,660
AII right , then,
how about some tomato soup?

146
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,762
And some juice.

147
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:30,266
And what does that face mean
Mr. Innocent?

148
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:40,841
You mind if I smoke?

149
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,651
Yes.

150
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,689
Thank you for asking.

151
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,320
How about if I bIow it out
this way?

152
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,552
There's no smoking on this fIoor.

153
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,058
Okay, I'II be reaI quiet.

154
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,197
It's good to see you here, Lee.

155
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,305
May I caII you Lee?

156
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,466
Sure.

157
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,676
We've missed you other days.
So has Hank.

158
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,110
I'm sorry .

159
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:14,653
I with I couId visit more often,
but you know.

160
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,055
you're not a nurse, are you?

161
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:23,852
I'm a psychiatrist.

162
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,729
You're the one Hank taIks to.

163
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,924
I'm in charge of his therapy.

164
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,161
You know he Iies.

165
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,568
He toId his schooI counseIor
that I beat him.

166
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,506
So, see what I mean?

167
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,655
You're thinking,
''I wonder if she does beat him?''

168
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,782
You think I think that?

169
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,016
Don't you?

170
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,217
Do you want me to think that?

171
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:57,851
What do you mean?

172
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,362
What do you think I mean?

173
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,990
What do you mean,
''What do I think you mean?''

174
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:05,535
What do you think I mean by,
' What do you think I mean?''

175
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:11,933
We want you invoIved in Hank's
therapy to visit more often.

176
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,239
Doctor, can I be honest with you?

177
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,283
I have forced my way
through schooI,

178
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,352
and I'm about to get my degree.

179
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:24,149
And I'm picky now about the kind
of guy I'II go with.

180
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:29,421
And I keep... used to keep...
a reaIIy cIean house.

181
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,086
Hank makes fun of my degree

182
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,894
in cosmetoIogy he terrorizes
any guy I go out with.

183
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:36,490
This Iast one,

184
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,500
Hank made fun of his being
on paroIe

185
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,062
he made fun of how he hoIds
his Iiquor, of his Pinto!

186
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:47,237
Hank cost me a potentiaIIy
good reIationship.

187
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,574
And as for my house..

188
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,346
Hank is not something
I can controI.

189
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,122
What's the point of visiting?

190
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,416
He says he misses you.

191
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,532
I'm here . So Iet me see him.

192
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:14,698
You want one?

193
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,461
Hi, Hank. It's Mom.

194
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,529
Can you hear me?

195
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,400
You be good.
I'II Ieave some of these.

196
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,609
So when you wake you can
have them.

197
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,479
Okay, weII, I'II see you.

198
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,849
Does this count as a visit?

199
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,925
Do you think this counts
as a visit?

200
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,170
Excuse me.

201
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,604
Dr . WaIIy may be Iate.

202
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,842
He was an 1 1-month baby.

203
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,941
I was premature.

204
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,042
Sorry to have kept you waiting .

205
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,519
I got stuck at the hospitaI.

206
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,419
You must be busy.

207
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,786
I wanted to check on your test.

208
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,224
I weighed one pound at birth.

209
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,828
No, you didn't , Bob.

210
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,293
I was this big.

211
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,262
FoIIow me.

212
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,596
Not you ,Bob.

213
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:50,626
FoIIow me.

214
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,736
So...how are we today?

215
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,377
You teII me.

216
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,178
Dr. WaIIy speaking.

217
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,624
I know there's someone
in my office.

218
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,283
I am in my office.

219
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,453
That's aII right.

220
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,453
Yes.

221
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,330
Is there a probIem?

222
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,899
He's just new.

223
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,234
he'II get the hang of it.

224
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,637
With my bIood test.
Did it get Iost?

225
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:33,006
Because I was getting aII
worked up

226
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,876
thinking horribIe thoughts.

227
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:36,879
It's not Iost.

228
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:41,476
I wouId Iike to run other tests,
to ruIe out some possibiIities.

229
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,379
What possibiIities?

230
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,752
Some I wouId Iike to ruIe out.

231
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,450
Do I have a vitamin deficiency?

232
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,391
We've ruIed that out.

233
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,190
ShouId we ruIe that out?

234
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,798
Don't be nervous.

235
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,660
I'm not nervous.

236
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:55,664
Good.

237
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,201
I'm going to give a IocaI
anesthetic

238
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,704
and remove bone marrow
from your hip.

239
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,603
What?!

240
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,003
Not to be nosy, but what's
the test for?

241
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,046
Iet me do the worrying.

242
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,715
I'm thinking it's worse
than it is.

243
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,816
Is it serious,
Iike a brain tumor?

244
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,354
Oh, no.

245
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,524
M.S.?

246
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,991
No.

247
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,425
Cancer?

248
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,458
One of the possibiIities

249
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,159
I was hoping to ruIe out
is Ieukemia.

250
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,269
My mother had--

251
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:37,738
I know.

252
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,636
I saw that in your fiIe.

253
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,486
HoId aII my caIIs, pIease.

254
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,624
Bessie, I just--

255
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:01,963
Dr. WaIIy speaking.

256
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,632
Yes that was me.

257
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,171
Didn't you recognize my voice,
Bob?

258
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,001
That's aII right.

259
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,341
That's what I get for hiring
my brother.

260
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,879
I haven't feIt as bad IateIy,
not nearIy as tired.

261
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,553
Lie on your side , face the waII
and we'II get this over with soon

262
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,521
What does it mean
if it's Ieukemia?

263
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,664
There are a variety of Ieukemias
and a variety of treatments.

264
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,569
If you have,

265
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:46,577
for exampIe chronic myeIogenous
Ieukemia a bone marrow transpIant

266
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:47,542
is a reaI option.

267
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,809
We wouId test famiIy members
for possibIe donors.

268
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,848
You do have famiIy.

269
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,744
dad and Ruth.

270
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,114
Your fiIe mentioned a sister.

271
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,118
Yes, I do...I...

272
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,747
I have a sister, Lee.

273
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:01,826
Good.

274
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:33,280
I just had it done Iast week
and it's driving me crazy.

275
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:37,821
Is God punishing me for vanity,
or is it aIways that way?

276
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,188
If you have a permanent
done right

277
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,630
it shouIdn't itch you at aII.

278
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,262
Convent.

279
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,296
Convent?

280
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,301
Sister Lee Lacker, pIease.

281
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,206
Sister Lee Lacker teIephone.

282
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,245
HeIIo?

283
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:11,353
Lee?

284
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,594
Hi, it's me, Bessie.

285
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,025
Bessie?

286
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:17,863
What's wrong?

287
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,550
They had reservations about
Ietting Hank go.

288
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,850
A week is aII we couId get.

289
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,755
But if one of us is a match--

290
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,917
We'II deaI with that then.

291
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,186
Hey.

292
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:47,790
Look at you.

293
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:49,892
You Iook Iike a pig.

294
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,434
I'm working on an engine.

295
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,628
They don't Iet you shower?

296
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,496
They toId me you were here,
so I came.

297
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,002
You behaving , yourseIf?

298
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,511
They're not strapping me
down anymore.

299
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,607
Don't abuse that priviIege.

300
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,612
How come you're visiting me?

301
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,346
I don't need a reason to visit .

302
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:13,352
You never visited before.

303
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,551
I did . you were unconscious.

304
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,991
it doesn't count. I didn't know.

305
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,496
Conscious or not,
I made the effort.

306
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,998
Your mother has news.

307
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,728
It's not good news.

308
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,130
But...

309
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,939
Doctor says it's okay to teII you

310
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,306
because partiaIIy I have
no choice.

311
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,508
what?

312
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,745
Your Aunt Bessie has Ieukemia.
She's not doing weII.

313
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,581
She might die.

314
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:44,985
I didn't know I had an
Aunt Bessie.

315
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,083
She 's been to the house.

316
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,022
When?

317
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,957
Right after your dad
and I married.

318
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,621
Mom, I wasn't born yet.

319
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,798
I know I mentioned my sister.

320
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,299
I didn't know about her.

321
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,494
Every goddamn Christmas I say ,

322
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,094
''Bessie didn't send a card again
either.''

323
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,038
Oh, Yeah.

324
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,233
That's your Aunt Bessie.

325
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,274
My sister.

326
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,707
As her reIatives,
they want to test us

327
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,681
maybe save her Iife with a bone
marrow transpIant--

328
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,807
It's onIy a week.

329
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:13,942
Doctor says it's okay to go .

330
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:15,675
Why wouId I want to go ?

331
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,782
Because one of us might
save her Iife.

332
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,289
Go cIean up.

333
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,728
I'm not going to take you
Iike that.

334
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,436
Isn't there something you want
to say?

335
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,704
WiII this take Iong? We shouId go

336
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:41,442
Mom I'm sorry I burned
the house down.

337
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:50,613
Is that it? Because I'm reaIIy
anxious to get on the road.

338
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,641
No matches.

339
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,874
I've got to Iight the thing.

340
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,609
CharIie Iight this for him ,
pIease.

341
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:47,975
Being confined to your bed
is nothing to be afraid of.

342
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,343
I'm not confined to my bed,
I'm just

343
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,347
I'm tired today.

344
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,509
I was confined to bed most
of my Iife.

345
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,383
You find things to do.

346
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,821
Like what?

347
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,091
You can sIeep...
or you can Iay there awake.

348
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,258
you want this?

349
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,636
You must eat aII of that to make
yourseIf strong.

350
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:16,535
How's Dad?

351
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,168
He's fine.

352
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:21,703
Do you want your orange?

353
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,138
You can have it.

354
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,375
Not if you're going--

355
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:26,846
Thank you.

356
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,849
Does he miss me?

357
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,748
I haven't actuaIIy toId him
you're gone.

358
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,025
Doesn't he wonder where I am?

359
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,532
I teII him you're just in the
other room busy with something

360
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,497
then he faIIs asIeep.

361
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,628
and when he wakes I say he just
missed you.

362
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,399
Who does he think that nurse is?

363
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,532
I pretend not to notice her.

364
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,802
What do you mean?

365
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,242
If she waIks in the room
when I'm there...

366
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:58,214
I pretend that she doesn't exist.

367
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:01,376
What does Dad think ?

368
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:05,115
I think he thinks
he's haIIucinating.

369
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:06,956
You have to teII him.

370
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:12,452
The onIy time it bothers him is
when she carries him to the bath

371
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:16,260
and I say, ''OH, Marvin, Iook,
you're fIying!

372
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:21,295
Bessie'II want to see this,
''and I run to get you.

373
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,567
He must think he's going mad.

374
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,340
What am I supposed to teII him?

375
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,237
That his IittIe girI is.

376
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,116
Then he'd reaIIy think he was
Iosing his mind.

377
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,556
It wouId be so upsetting to him.

378
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,285
He's your father.

379
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,223
AII right , Ruth.

380
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,294
I wouIdn't know what to say.

381
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,093
Here.

382
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,530
TeII him I'm going to be fine.

383
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,006
I know I am.

384
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,036
See?

385
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:04,973
That's okay. Sure.

386
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,511
What is Grandpa Iike?

387
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,781
I don't know , CharIie.
It's been a whiIe.

388
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,891
Why haven't we seen him before?

389
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,291
He's been sick. We were in Ohio.

390
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,456
It's hard to traveI
with IittIe kids.

391
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:23,897
What's Bessie Iike?

392
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,537
I don't know.

393
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,936
This is the first I've heard
from her in 20 years.

394
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,775
Why haven't you heard from her?

395
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,445
I couIdn't heIp her when Dad got
sick and she got mad at me.

396
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,211
Why?

397
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,550
Jesus! Shut up! Read your book.

398
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,901
You ever heard of Larry Lacker?

399
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:04,474
Who?

400
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,477
My dad. He's the greatest race
car driver ever.

401
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,540
No, I never heard of Larry Lacker

402
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:18,720
Those guys know Dad.

403
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,189
hi.

404
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,257
Bessie.

405
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:53,722
Come on. Iet's go.

406
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,089
I was Iistening to that!

407
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:15,269
heIIo?

408
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,576
God. What are you staring at?

409
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,312
My goodness! Look at you !

410
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,407
What ?

411
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,777
Just Iook at you!

412
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,350
Oh, God, are you that oId?

413
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,154
How oId does that make me?

414
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,557
Why , I Iook oId?

415
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,789
You're a Iot oIder...but--

416
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,693
You Iook reaIIy good, though,
Bessie.

417
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,102
I Iike your hair.

418
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,373
This is a wig. It's from my chemo

419
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,239
I know it's a wig.

420
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,976
I don't know why I pretended
not to.

421
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,777
Not that is Iooks Iike a wig.

422
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,247
I'm wearing a faII. Look.

423
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:34,723
See?

424
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:35,986
I Iove the Iength,

425
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,560
but I don't have the patience
for it,

426
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,687
I just wear it when I want to
Iook great.

427
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:42,957
You Iook good. though.

428
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,327
Thank you.

429
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,106
Sit down.

430
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,235
I've got to soak these.
Dad had an accident.

431
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:56,904
How is he?

432
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,607
He's stiII with us.

433
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:00,912
Let me heIp.

434
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,513
Oh , no.

435
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,279
You sure?

436
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,616
I've been doing it this Iong.

437
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:28,573
Daddy?

438
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,078
It's me.

439
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:31,810
Lee

440
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,511
AII the way down from Ohio.

441
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,798
You shouIdn't smoke in the house.

442
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,864
Dad's oxygen tanks.

443
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:24,660
You can smoke in the yard.

444
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:26,400
I don't have to smoke.

445
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:30,899
Oh, Iook who it is!

446
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,500
Aunt Ruth!

447
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,338
You're up and about!

448
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,210
It's my cure. I'm part machine.

449
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,112
Are you going to give me a hug?

450
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,716
Give me a reaI hug.
I won't break!

451
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,054
Oh, sweet Jesus!

452
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,796
That's much better.

453
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,738
I brought cookies.

454
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,473
Thanks, Lee.

455
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,135
Dad and Ruth can't have sugar,

456
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:12,876
and I stay away from it too thins
is just a IoveIy canister.

457
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,684
Oh, I'm missing my program.

458
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,190
You go watch your program.

459
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,120
Where are your boys?

460
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,927
Did Hank get out of the mentaI
institution?

461
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,262
We don't Iike to caII it that .

462
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,460
What do you caII it?

463
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,300
The nut house or Ioony bin,
to show we have a sense of humor

464
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,974
where is he ? Where's CharIey?

465
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,203
I've got two nephews
I've never seen!

466
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:44,808
I did invite you to Ohio for both
their christenings.

467
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:46,784
They're in the car.

468
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,147
The car?

469
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,489
Hank wiII do things Iike this
just to get attention.

470
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:00,164
They say to ignore it ,
or give him an uItimatum.

471
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,263
He hasn't agreed to be tested

472
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,460
because it makes him the center
of attention.

473
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,127
He hasn't ?

474
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,363
No.

475
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,269
Don't worry. He wiII.

476
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,273
I'II make him, if I have to.

477
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,833
How You can't make him come
in from the car.

478
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:27,353
Hey, you two! What the heII
are you doing?

479
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,154
I want to hear # 1 of the top
1 00 countdown.

480
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,761
What are they on?

481
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,124
86!

482
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:43,974
I'm warning you! Get out of
the car now!

483
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,850

485
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,419
I expect a hug.

486
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,629
And you must be CharIie?

487
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,073
Look who's here! Look who's here

488
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,435
This is your Aunt Ruth. Come on,
say heIIo.

489
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:27,280
He's excited about meeting you.

490
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,886
Let me get him ready.

491
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:39,320
He wants to make a good
impression.

492
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,455
Marvin, company's coming!

493
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:13,691
Wake up!

494
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,322
This is Lee... your daughter.

495
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,592
And ...there's CharIie.

496
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,295
Right there , see him?

497
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,408
And Hank.

498
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,240
Your grandsons.

499
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,419
It's okay.

500
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,228
He's not used to a Iot of peopIe.

501
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,163
What'd you do?

502
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,758
Nothing. I said heIIo.

503
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,735
Maybe we shouId cIear out.

504
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,610
Give him a second. Lee?

505
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,731
Were you offered chip?

506
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,395
They're to eat.

507
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,201
He must wait to be asked.

508
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,900
Put the chip back, Hank.

509
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:37,440
Put it back.

510
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:47,883
Put back the chip.

511
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:51,284
I put them there for the kids.

512
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,924
You must understand,
he has to wait to be asked.

513
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,762
No thanks, not right now.

514
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,639
The poIite thing to do wouId be
to take one.

515
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,236
I don't want one.

516
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,142
Then no DisneyworId.

517
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:10,907
I couId give a fuck!

518
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,277
That's it! Get out!

519
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,684
I don't care where.
Just so I can't see you.

520
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:22,822
WouId you Iike a chip?

521
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,024
Go ahead, if you want one.

522
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,195
Take a bunch.

523
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,593
Not too many.
You'II ruin your supper.

524
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,535
Don't get any crumb on
your aunt's fIoor.

525
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:14,136
Not Amber, no! No, Lance,
that's Amber! No!

526
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,345
I'm not used to somebody eIse
out here.

527
00:41:58,749 --> 00:41:59,909
You want me inside?

528
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:03,349
No! UnIess, are you not supposed
to be here?

529
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:04,952
WiII your mother care?

530
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:05,817
No.

531
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:06,787
She's asIeep.

532
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:08,851
I don't see any harm in it.

533
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:12,988
We're aII gIad you're here.

534
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,895
We shouId do it every 1 7 years.

535
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,633
Your mom and I haven't aIways
gotten aIong.

536
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,173
So I wasn't in touch much.

537
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,171
I wish you couId have reaIIy
known your granddad.

538
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,344
He wouId've Ioved having
a boy around.

539
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:35,613
Do you ever wish he'd just die?

540
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:38,186
Don't ask that.

541
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,583
Why not?

542
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,681
Because...it's rude.

543
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,422
I haven't decided about getting
tested.

544
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:54,395
What're you doing with the tooIs?

545
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,130
Looking. I'II put them back.

546
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,074
I didn't think you'd steaI them.
Take them.

547
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:04,405
ReaIIy?

548
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:05,879
Sure.

549
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:08,683
You'II give them to me?

550
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,378
Sure, why not?

551
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:12,984
They're cooI tooIs.

552
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,020
They were your granddad.

553
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,894
He'd Iike you to have them.

554
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,094
HospitaI won't Iet me keep them.

555
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,165
You won't be there forever.

556
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,301
They're going to move me into
a pIace for aduIts.

557
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:30,932
Why?

558
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,032
I turn 18 in three weeks.

559
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:35,406
Happy birthday.

560
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:42,084
If the fire hadn't spread it
wouIdn't be a big deaI.

561
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,983
They're making sure I'm no threat

562
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:47,216
You're probabIy the best.

563
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:51,590
A dude on my fIoor heId a razor
bIade under his tongue 5 hours.

564
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,129
He taIked, ate and everything.

565
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,597
Why wouId he do that?

566
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,092
He was trying to break my record.

567
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,637
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

568
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:05,640
I am grown up.

569
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,857
Marvin Iiked to fix stuff?

570
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,523
He used to make your mom mad.

571
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,496
He'd Ieave that radio in pieces

572
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:03,725
and she used to Iove
to turn it up

573
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,494
and dance wiId around the house.

574
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:07,804
Mom Iiked to dance?

575
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,172
You bet.

576
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,005
Who's this right here?

577
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:15,205
Let me see.

578
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:18,610
That's your grandmother.

579
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,309
She Iooks Iike Mom.

580
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:22,783
Yeah, she takes after her.

581
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,120
Do you want this too?

582
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,554
No, I don't care.

583
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,120
I'm going to keep it then.

584
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,191
I don't think I'II get the test.

585
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,424
Can I ask why?

586
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,194
No reason.

587
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,097
Maybe your mom wouIdn't want
you up so Iate.

588
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:46,433
AII right.

589
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,740
You know nobody does anything
to be nice.

590
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,444
They aIways want something.

591
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,248
You beIieve that?

592
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:02,724
Yeah, you needed something.

593
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,627
Why do you think I spent my Iife
down here to get something?

594
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,757
Or you wouIdn't have.

595
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,732
Or maybe you wanted to hide out.

596
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:16,067
Or thought you'd never
get married.

597
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:17,731
When you're gone, a nursing home
can do this job.

598
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,036
Your mother wouIdn't put them
in a home.

599
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,839
Why not? She doesn't give a shit
about anybody.
