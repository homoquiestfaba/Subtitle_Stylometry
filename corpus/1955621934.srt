["Pepper" by Butthole Surfers]

2
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:11,067
- * Some will die
in hot pursuit *

3
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:12,433
* In fiery auto crashes

4
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:14,033
* Some will die
in hot pursuit *

5
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:15,533
* While sifting
through my ashes *

6
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,100
* Some will fall
in love with life *

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,600
* And drink it
from a fountain *

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,133
* That is pouring
like an avalanche *

9
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:21,200
* Coming down the mountain

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,667
[cheers and applause]

11
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:24,733
* I don't mind
the sun sometimes *

12
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,367
* The images it shows

13
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:30,067
* I can taste you
on my lips *

14
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:33,767
* And smell you
in my clothes *

15
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,400
* Cinnamon and sugary

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,367
* And softly spoken lies

17
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:42,067
* You never know
just how you look *

18
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:45,633
* Through other people's eyes *

19
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:47,033
- Wow.

20
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:48,600
[cheers and applause]

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,567
Thank you.

22
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:54,333
Ugh, believe it or not,
that gets old.

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,233
It is great to be here
in America.

24
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,300
Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,400
The greatest country
in the world...

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,667
if you haven't
traveled a lot.

27
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:17,267
Do we have to constantly scream
we're number one?

28
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:18,500
It's always
the people that live

29
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,233
in the most boring parts
of this country

30
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:21,900
that scream the loudest.

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,667
People in Kansas, "We're the
greatest country in the world."

32
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:29,133
It's like,
do you guys have Internet there?

33
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:32,933
You ever seen
a photo of Fiji?

34
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:35,167
I've never been to Fiji,
but I've seen photos.

35
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,700
It looks pretty amazing.

36
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,400
It's hard to think
we're better than that.

37
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,400
We're top ten.

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,267
Maybe if we started
screaming that every day,

39
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:44,767
maybe terrorists
would stop trying

40
00:01:44,767 --> 00:01:46,967
to saw our heads off.

41
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,967
"We're top ten."

42
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:51,433
And they'd be like,
"That's fair."

43
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,100
"It was that number one stuff
that was getting old."

44
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,267
America's basically turned
into one of these factories

45
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:04,067
where we just
have a sign up like,

46
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:09,067
"It's been 22 days
since our last horrible thing."

47
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:11,400
Then it's like, "Oop,
all right, rip it down.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,733
We're back at zero again."

49
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,467
These things
just keep happening,

50
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:18,067
you know, whether
it's Ferguson or Baltimore.

51
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:19,600
I can solve racist cops.

52
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
That's an easy fix.

53
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,500
But nobody comes to me
for the answers.

54
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,700
You want to get rid
of that forever?

55
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,100
How about this?

56
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,200
Only black people
should be allowed to be cops.

57
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,667
Boom, problem solved.

58
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:38,367
And if any of you
have issue with this,

59
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,600
it's because you're racist.

60
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:44,867
"Well, what about white people?"

61
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:46,567
White people
can be firefighters.

62
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,400
We're more outdoorsy.
It makes sense.

63
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:55,633
White people, firefighters.
Black people, cops.

64
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,833
Who wants tickets
to the softball game now?

65
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,767
Yeah, it's gonna get
pretty tense.

66
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:04,867
Might want to put in
a mercy rule.

67
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:06,967
And the next time
we have one of these tragedies--

68
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,267
inevitably, we will--

69
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,967
and you happen to be
so unfortunate enough

70
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:12,167
to know the person that's
being accused of the crime,

71
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:15,567
do us all a favor
and don't get on TV the next day

72
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:18,567
and be like, "I lived
next to him for 32 years.

73
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:21,467
I never could have
seen this coming."

74
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:25,300
Maybe you should be
locked up for six months.

75
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,400
I find nothing
more disrespectful.

76
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,067
You never could have
seen it coming?

77
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:31,467
I've never met anyone
in my entire life

78
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,500
that I couldn't
wrap my brain around the fact

79
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,933
that they are capable
of awful things.

80
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,633
Literally no one.

81
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:41,533
My mom
could blow up a nursery.

82
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:42,867
And if you put me
on TV the next day

83
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,400
and I was completely
honest with myself,

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,100
I'd be like,
"I can fucking see it.

85
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,733
"No, it makes sense.

86
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,700
"Sometimes when I was a kid,
I'd come home from school;

87
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,067
"she wasn't happy to see me.

88
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,633
I think she hates children."

89
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,233
Ladies, know that every man
you're sitting next to tonight,

90
00:03:58,233 --> 00:03:59,600
if you could
get into their head

91
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,500
and see every thought
they have ever had,

92
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,467
you would immediately
pull out a gun

93
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:06,167
and blow your head off.

94
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:09,600
Because trust me,
they are capable of anything.

95
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,367
All day long,
every day,

96
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:14,100
nothing but twisted,
weird, awful shit

97
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,400
is just going
round and round and round.

98
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,533
And what do you do at night?

99
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:20,067
You snuggle up
next to him

100
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:23,967
because you're so happy
that you're not alone.

101
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:28,400
And I think
that says more about you.

102
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,633
That notion
that your parents raised you on,

103
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,300
"Stand by your man"?

104
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,767
If you're insane.

105
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,433
The second your man
gets accused of anything,

106
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,867
you immediately
distance yourself.

107
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,367
Just be like,
"Eh, I don't know

108
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,667
what the fuck he's into."

109
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,133
Buy clothes
in the next town.

110
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,067
We'll forgive you.

111
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,833
By the way,
I do love this country.

112
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,833
We're the only place
with any diversity.

113
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,700
The entire planet's segregated.

114
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,833
You realize that when you watch
international sports.

115
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,467
Like, I was trying
to watch the World Cup,

116
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:59,733
uh, despite hating it.

117
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,600
I get it; soccer's the most
popular sport on the planet.

118
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,600
That's because half the world
can't afford AC.

119
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,933
And that's about
how long you have to run

120
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:12,767
just to get tired enough
to fall asleep

121
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:16,567
in these
godforsaken countries.

122
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,233
You ever try
to gamble on soccer?

123
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,067
"What's the over/under,
0.5?

124
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:23,200
Mm.
How much time's left?"

125
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,333
"It's a secret."

126
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,200
I'm out."

127
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,333
But we have diversity.
Other teams don't.

128
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,700
Or if you look
at the Olympics,

129
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,333
you look at our, uh,
U.S. Gymnastics squad,

130
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,633
we have an Asian girl,
a white girl, a black girl.

131
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:36,367
Look at the Chinese squad.

132
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,667
Any guesses?

133
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:46,400
Did you guess
exclusively Chinese bitches?

134
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,600
Yeah, that's all
that's ever been on that team.

135
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,067
That's all
that will ever be on that team.

136
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,400
Then they wonder why they're not
getting golds anymore.

137
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,800
Well, you better get
a Harlem in China.

138
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:03,567
You think snapping together
iPads all day is tough?

139
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:06,067
It is.
Not as tough as it used to be.

140
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,833
Now they have suicide nets
around their building

141
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,933
so they can jump out,
bounce right back.

142
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:13,200
"Sorry, boss,
just needed some fresh air.

143
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,533
"Back to making Americans
more stuff?

144
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,200
You got it."

145
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,167
This is a tough joke to do
as a white comedian,

146
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:26,633
but here goes.

147
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,167
Because where
this country is now,

148
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:30,400
from where we came from
is pretty remarkable.

149
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,333
There's nothing more shameful
in our country's past

150
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,733
than slavery.

151
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:36,100
Okay, it's horrible.

152
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,733
But I've grown up
in a generation

153
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:40,433
where I've idolized black people
my entire life.

154
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,133
They are better
at everything.

155
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:47,500
So the fact
that we pulled off slavery--

156
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,233
I've already said
it's awful.

157
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:53,667
That's off the table.

158
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:57,167
I'm just saying
it's kind of neat.

159
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,133
I mean, at any point,
they could have been like,

160
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:02,667
"You know we can
just run away, right?

161
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,867
"And you
will never catch us.

162
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:10,867
And if you do, we will beat
the living shit out of you."

163
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:12,667
All right,
that's about how well

164
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,967
that joke should go over.

165
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,667
There's a fine line
between appreciating the sarcasm

166
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:21,467
and, "Ooh,
this feels like a rally."

167
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,933
And you did well.

168
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:27,500
That's a joke
I do not do everywhere.

169
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,967
That's a joke if the audience
gets a little too excited,

170
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:32,067
I shut it down.

171
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,833
You start hearing
a couple "yee-haws,"

172
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,333
trouble's a-brewing.

173
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,967
As soon as "yee-haw"
hits a certain octave,

174
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:44,667
hate crime
in T minus ten, nine...

175
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,900
The unemployment rate
in our country's around 6.5%.

176
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,300
I'm told
that's pretty good.

177
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,967
I could care less.

178
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,600
I wish a president
would have the balls

179
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,233
to say what I'm about to.

180
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:59,200
10% of Americans
don't deserve jobs.

181
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,467
Good night.

182
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:04,667
Like, that's a number
I can get my head around.

183
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,133
Of course,
there's exceptions to that.

184
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,600
That's not
who we're talking about.

185
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,133
But if you don't think
10% of Americans

186
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:11,733
are lazy pieces of shit,

187
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:14,567
then you
have never traveled anywhere.

188
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,333
Because the number
that blows me away

189
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,533
is that over 90% of Americans
have jobs.

190
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:23,700
Who the fuck
is hiring you morons?

191
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,733
Because I wouldn't.

192
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,200
The sense of entitlement?

193
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,600
Everyone thinks they deserve
more than they have.

194
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,100
No one's content.

195
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Young kids--I won't even
talk to them anymore

196
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,133
because you parents
have done such a bang-up job.

197
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,833
If I meet one more kid
and ask him

198
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,167
what he wants to do
when he gets older

199
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,200
and he replies,
"I want to be famous like you,"

200
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,800
I'm gonna kick him
in his teeth.

201
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,300
You're never
gonna be famous.

202
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,433
Never.

203
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,867
You have no chance.

204
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:53,067
I didn't get here
because I work hard.

205
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:56,067
I have a gift
from God.

206
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:03,533
"Everybody gets their
15 minutes of fame, buddy."

207
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,267
Excuse me?

208
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:06,933
That's an average.

209
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:10,067
Yeah, that's zero
for you, you, you, you.

210
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:12,200
Zero, zero, zero,
zero, zero,

211
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,867
20 years,
zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.

212
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,633
Everybody gets 15 minutes?

213
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,333
You know Andy Warhol
was on drugs

214
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,100
when he said that, right?

215
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,233
He didn't think he'd be quoted
for the rest of eternity,

216
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:27,133
let alone taken seriously
as an artist.

217
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,900
You ever go into, like,
a cute local café

218
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,400
and an artist has their work
for sale on the walls?

219
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,233
Has anybody ever not walked up,
looked at the price, and gone,

220
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:38,100
"Who the fuck
do they think they are?"

221
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,233
Just once, I'd like to walk
into somebody's home

222
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,933
and be like,
"Wow, that is a beautiful piece.

223
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,267
Where did you get it?"

224
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:47,967
And they're like,
"Oh, funny story.

225
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,867
"I was getting a spinach wrap
the other day for lunch,

226
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:53,433
"and I had $750
burning a hole in my pocket,

227
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,967
"and I was like, 'Hey, guys,
unbolt this from your urinal

228
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,167
and get it
into my living room.'"

229
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,333
You know what the unemployment
rate in China is?

230
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,900
Neither do I
because I'm American.

231
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,567
I'm fucking stupid.

232
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:08,933
It's got to be low, right?

233
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:10,167
Those people get up
at 3:00 in the morning

234
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,667
to practice the violin
for 4 1/2 hours,

235
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,267
then they work on math
for 12 hours,

236
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:18,933
and whatever's left,
they're ninjas.

237
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:21,033
If you think for one second,

238
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:22,700
we will ever catch up
with them,

239
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,900
you are out of your mind.

240
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,067
Just sit at home and be patient
until they take over.

241
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,600
Quite frankly,
they deserve our country.

242
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,067
Like, "Oh, shit,
China's here.

243
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,933
Do we take off our shoes?
How does this work?"

244
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,367
Would you like me to fix

245
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:40,933
all the environmental problems
on the planet?

246
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,100
I can do it.
The solution's simple.

247
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,400
You won't help.
That's the real problem.

248
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,333
Stop having kids.

249
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,967
[cheers and applause]

250
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:54,500
You hear that?
That's not enough support.

251
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,933
That's why we have
to contaminate the water.

252
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:02,333
Because most of you
are not on board yet.

253
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,600
But that's all
that has to happen.

254
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,433
Just stop having kids.

255
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,533
And I'm not one of these people
that cares about the planet.

256
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:12,067
I hope it blows up
the day after we're gone.

257
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,767
But stop having kids,

258
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,767
and then we can have
the greatest party

259
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,867
for the next 60 to 70 years

260
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:21,800
just pissing through
all the natural resources.

261
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,433
It would be amazing.

262
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,333
But what happens?
Some of you, you get fed up.

263
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,100
You're like,
"Uh, I hate my life.

264
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,900
You try."

265
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,800
[sputtering]

266
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,400
[laughs]
"Look, it looks like me."

267
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,533
Selfish.

268
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:39,300
That's what I think
of your families...

269
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,600
selfish.

270
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,067
China has the right idea.

271
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,700
They're the smartest people
on the planet.

272
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,133
If they think
boys are more important

273
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:49,200
and two should be the cap,
good enough for me.

274
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
We have a TV show
in our country

275
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,400
called "19 and Counting."

276
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,067
That show should be called
"Wrecked Pussy."

277
00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:02,200
Shocking that one of those kids
turned out to be a bad egg.

278
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,100
You mean you can't
keep your eye on 19 children?

279
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,600
You can't be a good parent
to three kids.

280
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,833
Do you know
how I know that?

281
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:13,233
Because my parents
had four.

282
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,700
What are you gonna do
when one of them asks,

283
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,067
"Who do you love more?"

284
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,933
"I love you all the same."

285
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:20,700
"Oh, really,
a 19-way tie?

286
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,700
Fuck you, Mom."

287
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,400
And you deserve
that kind of language.

288
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,600
You can't sell
a 19-way tie to anyone.

289
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,233
You're gonna have to be honest
with those kids.

290
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,733
Like, "All right,
let's see.

291
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:36,200
"One of you's a predator,
so you're out.

292
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,267
"Not even sure
these three are mine anymore.

293
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,067
"No idea why the ginger's
staring at me.

294
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:43,367
"You have no shot.

295
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:46,467
"What, you think I enjoy
dunking you in a tub of sunblock

296
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:49,500
"just to bring you outside,
you mutant?

297
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,633
"What is your X-Men power
besides killing every boner

298
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:56,700
in every room
you walk into?"

299
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,133
I tease, redheads.

300
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:02,333
You're just as pretty
as prettier people.

301
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,167
The reason so many people
in this country

302
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,067
keep having
litters of children

303
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:07,700
are all these fertility drugs.

304
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,667
You're not gonna like
this joke, heads up.

305
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,933
Know that if you have to take
a ton of fertility drugs

306
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:15,700
to get pregnant,
that is God just saying

307
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
you'd be an awful parent.

308
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,067
Yeah, maybe if you weren't
such a cunt in your 30s,

309
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,900
you'd be a mother
in your 40s.

310
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,333
Let's be clear.

311
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,667
I don't want
to do that joke.

312
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,567
I have to do that joke

313
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:32,367
because statistically
that will ruin

314
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:35,167
at least two people's night
this evening,

315
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,833
and for some horrible reason
which I can't explain,

316
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:41,200
that brings me joy

317
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,933
to know that there's
a lady here right now

318
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:47,267
just going,
"Fuck him.

319
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:51,400
I deserve
a family too."

320
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,067
No, you don't.

321
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,500
You don't.

322
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,067
It's called the American dream
for a reason.

323
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,333
It's unrealistic.

324
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,133
It's not gonna happen
for everyone.

325
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:05,100
You want a kid so bad,
adopt one, you selfish wench.

326
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,867
We're only halfway
through this joke.

327
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:09,933
Hang in there.

328
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,500
You ever seen an orphanage?

329
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,600
I ask this from time to time
because I know the answer.

330
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,867
Most people haven't.

331
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,333
It's a real problem
in this country.

332
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,867
There's kids
that need homes,

333
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:23,067
yet where they're located
is a goddamn mystery.

334
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,067
You'd think that'd be
a crucial part

335
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:27,967
of the orphanage's
business plan...

336
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,367
being very accessible.

337
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:33,167
Like, "Hey, hey,
we're over here."

338
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,167
Nobody's ever given me
directions to their place,

339
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,567
been like,
"You go to the orphanage.

340
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,067
"You take a right.
My house is right there.

341
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:40,067
You can't miss it."

342
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:41,433
Maybe this
is a better way.

343
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:42,933
You ever go to a grocery store
on a Saturday

344
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,667
and out front,
they have a pen set up

345
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,800
for rescue dogs?

346
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,067
I'm not imp--

347
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:50,800
I'm not implying
putting the orphans in.

348
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,267
I'm just pointing out
that that's also a real problem.

349
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:56,133
They were smart enough
to realize,

350
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:59,067
bring the problem to us,
shove it in our face,

351
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,067
makes the problem
go away.

352
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,900
Now set up a nicer pen.

353
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,300
Put it in the shade.

354
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,567
If you can afford
Whole Foods,

355
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:11,600
you can afford
another child.

356
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,167
And if you can't, at least
put some hand sanitizer on

357
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:17,333
and sit in there and play
for a couple minutes.

358
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,600
That's the very least
you could do.

359
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,367
You ever watch
your morning local news

360
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,667
where once a week,
somebody from the animal shelter

361
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,067
will bring a dog on?

362
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:27,633
Do you know why
they do it?

363
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:28,667
Huh?

364
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,767
Because it works.

365
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:32,233
Because bringing
that dog on TV

366
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:34,100
makes somebody at home go,
"You know what?

367
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,467
I could take that dog,"
and you saved his life.

368
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,100
Why aren't we doing that
with orphans?

369
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,433
I don't understand.

370
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:41,333
Honestly, like--like,
"This is Carlita.

371
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,067
"She's only five.
You can change her name.

372
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,767
"She doesn't give a shit.

373
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,833
"Come on, Carlita.

374
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:48,867
Can you dance, Carlita?"

375
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:51,067
And she's like...

376
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:57,400
She just wants
a home for Christmas.

377
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,433
Life is about perspective.

378
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:01,700
I see a handicap person,
I don't feel sorry for them.

379
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,500
I'm like, "Hey, it's like
being employee of the month

380
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,767
for the rest of your life."

381
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:09,567
That's half full.

382
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:13,067
"Pretty sweet parking spot.
How'd you get it?"

383
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:14,500
He's like,
"Bullet in the spine."

384
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,067
I'm like, "Worth it.
Low five, roll it in."

385
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,133
You don't go high five

386
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:21,267
unless you have
a hill and a ramp.

387
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:22,667
Then get a camera.

388
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:25,400
That's got to be
pretty exciting to watch.

389
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,233
You can laugh at this joke.
Handicap people like it.

390
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,067
And if they don't like it,
turn their chair around.

391
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:31,967
I don't give a shit.

392
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:35,800
Stare at you,
depressing us.

393
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,967
You don't hear a lot
about the charity work I do,

394
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:41,633
and it's because
I don't do any.

395
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,200
You know what's better
than tax write-offs?

396
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,300
Keeping your money.

397
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,600
That's just a fun joke
to tell rich people.

398
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,767
It's not true.

399
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:53,233
I work with Make-A-Wish
all the time.

400
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:54,767
That's an incredible
experience,

401
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:59,300
uh, for me,
not the kids that are dying.

402
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,100
Yeah, they chose
to hang out with me.

403
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,733
They knew
what kind of jokes I told.

404
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:06,167
They were okay with it.

405
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,633
I don't pander onstage,

406
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:09,800
and I certainly don't
pander offstage.

407
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,733
And I'm telling you honestly,
these dying kids

408
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,967
have the best sense of humor
on this planet.

409
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:20,233
Their parents,
not so much,

410
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:21,667
but I don't care.

411
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,467
As soon as I meet them,
I start giving it to them.

412
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:24,667
Like, "Are you sure
you're dying?

413
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:28,133
You know
this is my weekend, right?"

414
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:29,467
And they're like,
"I'm dying."

415
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:30,733
I'm like,
"All right, let's go.

416
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,200
Don't cough on me,
motherfucker."

417
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:38,300
They want to be teased
like anybody else.

418
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,667
They can handle it.

419
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:42,633
Trust me, they've handled
a lot worse.

420
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,967
This kid I was hanging out with
last year a bunch was 17.

421
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:47,233
I'm like, "This is awesome
that you're dying now.

422
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,200
You got this in
right under the wire."

423
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,867
If you don't know,
the organization

424
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:53,567
is 18 and under.

425
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,333
So if you're dying of cancer
at 19, they're like...

426
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:59,800
[blows raspberry]
"Hope your dreams are cheap."

427
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,467
If you're laughing
right now,

428
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:03,367
it's because
you're a good person

429
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:06,333
and you realize how absurd
that statement is,

430
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,867
to think
that they draw a hard line,

431
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,467
but it's funny to think
they might be

432
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:10,900
holding their doors shut.

433
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,500
"You can't get in, kid.
You're too old."

434
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,700
And they don't even
have to hold tight

435
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,333
because they kids
are so weak

436
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:21,833
because the disease
is winning.

437
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,400
Don't feel bad
for this kid.

438
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
The first thing he said
when he met me was--

439
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,733
he told me
I was his third choice.

440
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,167
And to this day,
I don't know

441
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:30,233
if he was fucking kidding
or not.

442
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,700
That's not cool.
I'm healthy.

443
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,367
I'm gonna live
a long time.

444
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,567
I don't need that
noodling around up there.

445
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:42,933
And if it makes you feel
any better

446
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:45,133
laughing at these jokes,
know that he is cured

447
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:46,467
and healthy now.

448
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:49,600
He's not.
He's dead.

449
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,533
But if some people need that,
let them have it, right?

450
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,767
"Oh, he's okay?
Oh, good."

451
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,567
[laughing]

452
00:18:57,567 --> 00:19:01,533
"You know me.
I can't accept life."

453
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:04,233
That's a perfect gauge
for if we would ever

454
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,933
hang out
in a social setting.

455
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:09,067
Know that if you've ever said
any form of this statement,

456
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:10,433
we would not.

457
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:14,600
"Uh, there's nothing funny
about blank."

458
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,267
Any form of that,
know that I hate you

459
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:19,567
to your core.

460
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,567
Because I,
along with some of you,

461
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:23,867
respectfully disagree.

462
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:26,667
You can accept that things
are tragic and awful

463
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,467
and still have
a sense of humor about them.

464
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,067
It doesn't make you
a bad person,

465
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,667
despite what some blog
may say.

466
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,333
"Oh, there's nothing funny
about AIDS.

467
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,633
There's nothing funny
about rape."

468
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,333
Uh, yes there is
if you write a good joke.

469
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,700
There's funny things
about it.

470
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,267
And some of you
may be aware

471
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:41,667
I took a ton of bad press

472
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,667
for making that statement
verbatim.

473
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,167
And then a women
screamed at me,

474
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,733
"There is nothing funny
about rape."

475
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,133
And I've never
defended myself publicly,

476
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:50,900
despite misquotes.

477
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,533
Mainly because I'm rich.

478
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:54,833
I'm like,
"Fuck it.

479
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,633
"I make my living
saying shocking things.

480
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,767
There's consequences.
I can accept that."

481
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:00,533
And people
wrote me horrible stuff.

482
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,467
Like, "Hope your daughter
gets raped one day,

483
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,167
and we'll see
how funny you think it is."

484
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:08,200
Well, first of all, she'd have
to survive the abortion.

485
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,200
[laughter and applause]

486
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,400
[groans]

487
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,667
Talk about two strikes
against a kid, huh?

488
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:20,833
Yeah, I appreciate
your well wishes, kind soul.

489
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:25,000
It's a joke,
and it's my choice

490
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,167
to have it.

491
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,700
Yeah, this is where
the feminists are usually torn,

492
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,933
because we're on the same side
on most issues.

493
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,033
Abortion?

494
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,367
Over here, you have a lifetime

495
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,267
of stress
and inevitable disappointment.

496
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:40,833
And over here,
you have freedom.

497
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,533
Well, how much
does freedom cost?

498
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:48,000
A couple nights' sleep
and around $750.

499
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,433
Seems extremely reasonable.

500
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:55,333
If nobody is looking,
I will take freedom.

501
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,133
"But they have fingernails
at 14 days."

502
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,433
Yeah, and I clip them.

503
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:07,833
I'm pretty sure Dyson
makes an attachment.

504
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,800
Guys, it's a great product

505
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
that never loses suction
due to the engineering.

506
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,300
Now, in the interest
of full disclosure,

507
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,700
I'm sponsored by Dyson.

508
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,533
I get a couple thousand bucks
for the plug.

509
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:20,367
They're like,
"Is there any place in your act

510
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:21,833
where you could fit in
our product?"

511
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,433
I'm like, "I've got
the perfect home for it.

512
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:28,333
Quick question, what's your
company's stance on fetuses?"

513
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,867
"We fucking hate them."

514
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:33,067
"All right,
let's move some units."

515
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,533
I don't know what show
you thought

516
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:39,167
you bought tickets to,
but I assure you

517
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:42,467
this one's not getting softer.

518
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,933
All right.

519
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:47,833
[cheers and applause]

520
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,733
"There's nothing funny
about cancer."

521
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,667
All right,
if you haven't been affected

522
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,167
in some way or another
by cancer

523
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,767
at this point
of your life,

524
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:56,700
uh, and haven't developed
a sense of humor about it,

525
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,400
you're the crazy person.

526
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,667
I saw a campaign
in Phoenix where it says,

527
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,133
"The first thing
you should do

528
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:03,233
"if you find out
you have cancer

529
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:04,733
is get a second opinion."

530
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:06,700
Oh, really?
The first thing?

531
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,933
I was gonna cry for a bit,
but all right.

532
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:11,833
Let's make
another doctor's appointment

533
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,467
with somebody that probably
can't see me for a few weeks.

534
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,867
That has to be
a fun time.

535
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,900
Just sitting around your house
praying to God

536
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,600
your first doctor's
an incompetent pile of shit.

537
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,867
Then you finally see him,
and he's like,

538
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,467
"Yeah, yeah,
she was spot-on.

539
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:26,600
"You should have been
getting this treated.

540
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,067
You have cancer."

541
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:31,367
What if he says
you don't have cancer?

542
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:32,700
What is it,
two out of three?

543
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,267
When can I get
some sympathy strange?

544
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:35,500
That's what I'm looking for.

545
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:41,400
[cheers and applause]

546
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,467
"There's nothing funny
about child molestation."

547
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:48,200
All right,
then don't hang out with me.

548
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,733
Yeah, because
if you tell me a funny joke

549
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:52,700
about a priest
diddling a boy,

550
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,667
I'm not gonna be like,
"What is wrong with you?

551
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,533
Don't you know how serious
that issue is?"

552
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:01,700
I'm gonna laugh
because I'm not 11 or Catholic.

553
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,067
I don't give a fuck.

554
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:07,900
I can separate
between reality and jokes.

555
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,933
Who in here
at one point in their life

556
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:13,167
hasn't laughed at a
Michael Jackson pedophile joke?

557
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:16,633
Let's see
if you laugh at this one.

558
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,067
Did you know,
last year,

559
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:22,467
dead Michael Jackson
made $180 million

560
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,067
thanks to
his new show in Vegas?

561
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:26,467
Which is amazing
if you get a chance to see it.

562
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:27,933
There's a hologram
of Michael.

563
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:29,633
It sings
and dances the hits.

564
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:31,967
And for an extra $500 a pop,
you can go backstage

565
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:34,800
and watch him
try to ghost-fuck your kid.

566
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,667
Uh, you're laughing
at pedophilia.

567
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,167
Look at that.

568
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,400
Oh, and you can't
even be offended by the joke

569
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,700
because ghost-fucking's
not real.

570
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,567
But I'm sure
there's one dingbat in here,

571
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,500
"Yes, it is.

572
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,400
"I had a friend
that was molested by a spirit.

573
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,100
#GhostFuckingIsReal."

574
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,767
I'll laugh at the real thing
from time to time.

575
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:09,433
How about when Sandusky
was asked point-blank

576
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:12,233
on national television if he's
sexually attracted to boys

577
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:15,400
and he waited
around 16 seconds to apply,

578
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,467
and I quote, "Eh"?

579
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:23,200
If you don't think
I was at home pissing myself...

580
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,967
Like, "Oh, did he just waffle
on that softball question?"

581
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,333
"Eh."

582
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,300
Ask me if I'm
sexually attracted to kids.

583
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,867
I'm not.

584
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:36,833
That's how long you should wait
to answer that question.

585
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:39,067
You don't
mull it over for a bit.

586
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:41,167
You certainly don't
eyeball your lawyer.

587
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:44,733
"I wonder how he wants me
to answer this one."

588
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,567
You come out swinging
in a hurry,

589
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:49,733
or you deserve
to burn in hell.

590
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:51,733
He said the only thing
he's ever been guilty of

591
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:53,533
is, he liked to put his hand
on boys' legs.

592
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,600
I've heard enough.

593
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,067
On that alone,
you should be in jail forever.

594
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:03,733
You want to hug your son
longer than three seconds,

595
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:06,100
you should be
in jail forever.

596
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Yeah, my dad
didn't hug me very much.

597
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,567
He wasn't the best father,
but he didn't fuck children,

598
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,233
and I'll take it.

599
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:16,233
[cheers and applause]

600
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:19,167
I don't believe he has.

601
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:20,733
That's my biggest fear
in life,

602
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:22,267
that I do that joke
and people are cheering

603
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:24,700
and there's one guy in here,
"He fucked me."

604
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,500
And I'm like...

605
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,067
I am sorry.

606
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:36,633
I am 99.8% positive
he hasn't.

607
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:39,700
He hasn't heard
this joke yet.

608
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,600
And my gut instinct is,
he's not gonna like it.

609
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,933
But if he gets too upset,

610
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:48,067
I'll be like,
"What are you hiding?"

611
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:49,967
How many minutes of "Hoarders"
can you watch

612
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:53,200
before you have to start
cleaning your place?

613
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,233
Ugh.

614
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:55,600
Who are these people?

615
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,933
I can't watch it.

616
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:58,333
I'm a minimalist.

617
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,633
I still want to be on the show,

618
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:01,933
a "Hoarders" episode,
as a minimalist,

619
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:03,967
where the entire episode
is me struggling

620
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:07,067
with the one knickknack
that's on my mantel.

621
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,400
And they're like,
"You got to get rid of it."

622
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,433
And I'm like, "I can't."

623
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:14,733
With this many people
in here,

624
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:16,867
guaranteed one of you
is a hoarder.

625
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,367
And I'm not looking
to out you,

626
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:20,067
and I don't want
your friends to either.

627
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:21,600
But this is what needs
to happen.

628
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,733
Tomorrow morning, okay,

629
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:25,200
wake up early.

630
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,700
That's gonna be
new for you

631
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,667
because you're
a piece of shit.

632
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,567
That's fair, right?

633
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:35,067
You think hoarders
get up early?

634
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:37,367
Uh, they do not.
They sleep in.

635
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:39,133
They wait till
the thrift store's open,

636
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:42,833
and they pray there's
new bric-a-brac on the shelves.

637
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:45,067
Get up early.
Head on down to The Home Depot.

638
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:47,167
You're gonna go
to the equipment rental center.

639
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:49,567
Okay?
Get yourself a wood chipper.

640
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:52,733
It's gonna run you
around $175 for a half day.

641
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:55,067
On your way out,
grab a couple day laborers.

642
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:57,867
When you get home,
gas it up.

643
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,267
Have them
throw you into it.

644
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,433
Because you're
a disgusting person

645
00:27:04,433 --> 00:27:06,600
and no one likes you.

646
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,467
And by the lack of people
laughing right now,

647
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:12,967
my guess is, there's
more than one hoarder in here.

648
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:15,433
"But I love cats."

649
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:19,300
We know; that's why
we want you in the chipper.

650
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,933
Nobody can breathe
in your place.

651
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,433
I love the show
"House Hunters."

652
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,400
I don't know why
we can't gamble on that.

653
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,100
Make it legal, Vegas.

654
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,167
How much fun would that be?

655
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,067
Like, all right,
here we go.

656
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,367
He's the breadwinner.
She's a bitch.

657
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:35,500
Put it all on two.

658
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,367
God damn it,
they went craftsman?

659
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,800
I want to be
a realtor on that show

660
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,167
just to set people straight.

661
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,833
When they're like,
"Okay, my must-haves

662
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,867
"are ocean views.

663
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:50,833
My budget is $250,000."

664
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,967
You better learn Spanish.

665
00:27:57,533 --> 00:28:01,367
Because you're not
gonna see the water on our soil.

666
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:04,533
You're gonna
stare at the freeway

667
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:07,533
from your comfy condo.

668
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:09,733
They cancelled the TV show
"Intervention" this year

669
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:11,067
after ten years.

670
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:12,167
That's amazing.

671
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:14,067
That show was on
for ten years,

672
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,133
and every episode
was a success.

673
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:19,333
Not at curing someone
of drugs or alcohol--

674
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,933
that never works--

675
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:24,467
but tricking a druggie
into being on television,

676
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:27,067
which is all
they really cared about anyway.

677
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:28,600
"You're on 'Intervention."

678
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,100
"What? Oh.

679
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,533
Man, I thought you guys
were shooting a movie about me."

680
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:38,467
Is there no word of mouth
in the junkie community?

681
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,767
No one's shooting a movie
about your crappy life.

682
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:43,267
Sit down; we're gonna listen
to your illiterate parents

683
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:45,800
stumble through a letter
they wrote in crayon.

684
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:54,133
"Jon..."

685
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:57,200
J-O-N,
the dumbest of all Johns.

686
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:04,967
"Jon, hey,
it's me, Dad.

687
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:07,133
"Real sad
seeing you not good.

688
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:09,067
"You used to be good.

689
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:13,900
Now you're not good,
and that's bad."

690
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,933
Quite the tearjerker
this week.

691
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:19,900
"You were a straight-A student.
What happened?"

692
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,500
Everyone was
a straight-A student.

693
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,467
Was I the only
C student in this country?

694
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:25,833
Fair enough.

695
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,500
Just know that
if you're a straight-A student,

696
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,967
one day, you're gonna
suck cock for heroin.

697
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:32,267
How's that feel, nerds?

698
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:33,900
Maybe get outside
and play a little more,

699
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,167
a little less cocksucking
in your future.

700
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:39,567
And not even the fun kind,
the "I need heroin" kind,

701
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:43,867
which is way more panic-stricken
and aggressive.

702
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,433
I'm guessing.

703
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:56,133
I saw a sign outside
of a storage unit complex,

704
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:59,067
said first month's rent, $1.

705
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:01,333
I know a good deal
when I see one.

706
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,067
I'm guessing
that's a cash transaction.

707
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:06,900
"Here's my dollar."

708
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,267
I've never had
a storage unit.

709
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:11,033
I'm gonna put tons
of fake treasure in it.

710
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:14,100
Wall-to-wall fake treasure,

711
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,033
like, a chest,
coins everywhere.

712
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:19,200
Maybe get a skeleton,
put that in the corner.

713
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,667
Then month two's
gonna roll around.

714
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:23,333
Guess who's going delinquent
on their unit?

715
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:26,233
Yeah, just come up
with another email address.

716
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:30,033
I'm going home, waiting for
this episode of "Storage Wars."

717
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:33,333
Time to watch
some hill people overbid.

718
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,067
They pop open that unit;
they're like,

719
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:39,300
"Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,
we hit the jackpot on this one."

720
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,900
Standing there
with their flashlight.

721
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,900
"I think a ghost is guarding
the good stuff in the back.

722
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,300
No, I'm definitely interested."

723
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,367
Anytime your livelihood depends
on you uttering the phrase

724
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:52,033
"I got a good hunch
about this,"

725
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:54,867
know that you've made
a lot of bad decisions.

726
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:57,200
Don't put stickers
on your car.

727
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,733
Despite what you think
they say,

728
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,900
know they read,
"I'm poor."

729
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,833
No one cares
who you cheer for

730
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,067
or what you believe in.

731
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:07,567
Just drive a little faster.

732
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:12,700
And God forbid
if you lost a loved one

733
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,967
and you think the best way
to memorialize him

734
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:16,633
is by turning
your Honda Civic

735
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:19,467
into a moving tribute.

736
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,467
Don't.

737
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:23,367
Because the only thing
that makes me want to do

738
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:24,767
is T-bone you

739
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:27,367
so you and Junebug
can finally be together again.

740
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:33,300
Like my morning commute
isn't depressing enough?

741
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,233
Now I'm stuck behind you
and your word problem,

742
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:38,633
trying to figure out
how old this shithead was

743
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:40,967
in the first place.

744
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,133
There's not enough
information.

745
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,233
I got to pull up
next to you.

746
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:45,600
"Was he a Gemini
by chance?

747
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,167
"15, too soon.

748
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:51,900
Speed it up.
Some of us aren't dead."

749
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,467
Don't text and drive.

750
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:55,867
It's the law.

751
00:31:55,867 --> 00:32:00,067
Yeah, way to fast-track
the big issues in this country.

752
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:01,433
Do you know what
you are allowed to do?

753
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:04,367
Write a letter longhand
while driving.

754
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:10,533
Completely legal.

755
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:13,900
I would argue just as dangerous,
if not more.

756
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,467
Do I have to be a martyr
for this issue?

757
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:16,733
I'll do it.

758
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:18,700
Get on the freeway,
like, "Dear Grandma,

759
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,933
It's been a while."

760
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,633
"Winter is coming."

761
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:28,667
Kill a couple dozen people,
like, "Oh, no.

762
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:31,433
We should make writing letters
illegal too."

763
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:32,933
Can't we use common sense?

764
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:35,067
No, we have to spend millions
of taxpayer dollars

765
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:36,600
passing laws.

766
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,167
Have you seen the campaign
to stop texting and driving

767
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,967
where they show you
real final texts?

768
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:44,067
"Be right..."

769
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:49,967
They're like,
"Was it worth it?"

770
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:51,433
I don't know.

771
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:53,600
Were you trying to get laid
at 3:00 in the morning?

772
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,533
I'm not gonna judge you.
Maybe it was.

773
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:58,500
Maybe you finally had sex
with that one person

774
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,300
you've been chasing
your entire life

775
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,800
and you can't wait
to text your buddy.

776
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,533
"You're never gonna believe
who I..."

777
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:05,500
and then boom.

778
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,533
Congratulations.
You went out on top.

779
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:11,067
Yeah, I promise you
life wasn't gonna get better

780
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:12,367
after that moment.

781
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,167
Best-case scenario,
six months from now,

782
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:15,433
you're sending her texts.

783
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:21,200
"Yeah, Thai food's fine.
Whatever."

784
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,800
You can't text and drive,
but you can have

785
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,733
a three-course Taco Bell meal
in your lap

786
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:26,067
at 2:00 in the morning?

787
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:27,700
Everyone knows
you're drunk as shit.

788
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,067
You ought to be arrested
as soon as you place the order.

789
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:33,700
[cheers and applause]

790
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,067
"I'm sorry.

791
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:36,733
"We're gonna need you
to step out of the car.

792
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:38,233
"There's no such thing
as a gordita

793
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:39,500
"wrapped inside a gordita

794
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,933
wrapped inside
yet another gordita."

795
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:45,100
"There will be."

796
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,700
Why do people make a big deal
about last meals in prison?

797
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,433
"What do you want
for your last meal?"

798
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:56,467
"Uh, I don't know.
I kind of lost my appetite.

799
00:33:56,467 --> 00:34:00,567
Don't know if you heard,
gonna be murdered tomorrow."

800
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:02,067
"Well, you have
to eat something."

801
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:03,367
"Make it a burrito.

802
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:06,267
"You're gonna
clean some shit up.

803
00:34:06,267 --> 00:34:07,633
"Yeah, now neither one of us

804
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:10,533
are looking forward
to tomorrow."

805
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:12,667
I was watching
one of those "locked up" shows.

806
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:17,600
I saw a guy that was shanked
682 times.

807
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,833
Now, let's all agree
that that's a lot.

808
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:24,133
Do you have any idea
how long it would take

809
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:28,500
to stab somebody 682 times?

810
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,633
I did the math.
Don't rack your brain.

811
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:34,100
At two stabs per second,

812
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,700
which I believe
is a doable rate...

813
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,700
That's still
5 minutes 45 seconds-ish

814
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,267
of stabbing someone.

815
00:34:47,267 --> 00:34:49,333
That's not even
factoring in getting tired,

816
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,567
having to switch to your
nondominant hand, like...

817
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,767
Here's the crazy part.

818
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:05,233
He lived.

819
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:09,500
Yeah, there's your upside
for obesity, America.

820
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,067
Why don't you
get back in line,

821
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,467
hit that buffet
one more time

822
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:15,200
on the off chance
you get stabbed 682 times?

823
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,600
Like...
[huffing]

824
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,167
"Walk it off."

825
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,233
Off topic,
if you've ever bragged

826
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:25,900
about doing
a half marathon,

827
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,233
you can shut the fuck up
forever.

828
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:32,333
[cheers and applause]

829
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,700
When did that
even become a thing?

830
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,900
A half marathon?

831
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,600
Ooh.

832
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,833
I just finished reading
half a book.

833
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:43,167
Yeah, big, thick one.

834
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:44,467
Got to the middle,
set it down.

835
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:48,467
I'll never
look at it again.

836
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:52,967
I can bench press
around 450 pounds

837
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:56,067
one half time.

838
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:58,733
Just the down part.

839
00:35:58,733 --> 00:36:01,167
The point is,
until you've shit yourself

840
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:03,200
and your nipples
are bleeding at mile 26,

841
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,667
you've accomplished nothing

842
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:08,400
and no one wants
to hear about it.

843
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,100
[cheers and applause]

844
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:16,067
Mexicans?

845
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:18,500
You know who you are.

846
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,200
You are not
supposed to be here.

847
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,833
I love Mexicans.

848
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,067
I love Mexican food,

849
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:26,567
but next time
I'm in your restaurant,

850
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:28,067
please don't
come up to my table and ask

851
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:30,400
if I would like to start
with the house-made guacamole.

852
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,267
You know good goddamn well
I want that guacamole.

853
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:35,300
Let's just bring it out.

854
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,933
I make that kind of money now.

855
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:40,933
What's upsetting to me
is when my entrée comes

856
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:43,667
with a free side of guacamole
staring me in the face,

857
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:47,100
teaching me a costly lesson
in patience.

858
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,533
That's too much guacamole.

859
00:36:48,533 --> 00:36:53,467
What kind of Ponzi scheme
are you Mexicans up to?

860
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:55,633
This joke is stupid.
I don't care.

861
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:57,100
What happened
in the last ten years

862
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,233
in this country
where we've become so obsessed

863
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:00,667
with guacamole?

864
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:03,700
"Is there gonna be
guacamole there?"

865
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,233
"Honey, get dressed.
It's avocado season."

866
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:11,133
This joke doesn't work
in Canada

867
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:15,467
because they've never heard
of Mexicans.

868
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:18,900
Canada has the greatest fence
ever built...

869
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,367
America.

870
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:26,133
It is foolproof
if you can afford it.

871
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:29,533
Really easy to be the cool,
open-minded, hippie country

872
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:31,767
when there's
a Kevlar Snuggie of America

873
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:34,200
draped around your fat,
frozen asses,

874
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,933
daring the world
to talk shit.

875
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:39,467
"We don't use
our military."

876
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,200
Uh, we know.
We got you taken care of.

877
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,700
Go back to bed.

878
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,100
We'll wake you
when the NHL play-offs start.

879
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,233
[cheers and applause]

880
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,767
By the way,
has enough time passed

881
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:55,900
in this country
that we can openly and honestly

882
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,233
talk about the great things
Osama bin Laden did for us?

883
00:38:00,233 --> 00:38:02,800
And don't act
like he didn't do anything good.

884
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,600
How about the fact
that we immediately know

885
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,533
September is nine?

886
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:11,067
That's not nothing.
That's not noth--

887
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,667
Do you remember
what we used to do?

888
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:15,700
January, February,
March, April, May, June,

889
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,567
July, August...
nine.

890
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:20,200
Honey, it's nine.

891
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,267
I use it for August.

892
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:25,833
9/11 minus one...
eight.

893
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:27,367
How about the fact
that every time you take

894
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:28,867
your wife or your girlfriend
to the airport,

895
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:33,067
you no longer have to walk her
all the way to the gate?

896
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:35,267
Yeah, maybe next time
you do a drop-off,

897
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:37,833
you give him a quick,
"Thanks, Osama."

898
00:38:40,633 --> 00:38:42,567
"Hope you're enjoying that good
young tight stuff

899
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:47,500
they hand out up there."

900
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,300
Are we okay
with mocking his beliefs?

901
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,700
I did that joke in Utah,

902
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,467
and they laughed
like that's the crazy religion.

903
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:59,467
"Those stupid Muslims.

904
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,700
They only have one heaven."

905
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,233
I believe Mormons
have three.

906
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:04,633
I've never read their plates.

907
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:08,900
Some of you
are too young to remember

908
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,367
pre-9/11 airport drop-offs,
but they were the worst.

909
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:13,567
Your girlfriend's like,

910
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:15,067
"Can you give me
a ride to the airport?"

911
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:16,733
And you're like,
"Yeah, I'd love to.

912
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:18,733
"Because there's never been
a service invented

913
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:21,667
"that would
take you to the airport.

914
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:23,133
What time's your flight?"

915
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:24,967
"4:15 a.m."

916
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,867
"Perfect.

917
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:28,467
"No, I was gonna get up
at 2:00 anyway,

918
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,667
"so that works out.

919
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,567
"No, you know me;
2:00 rolls around,

920
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:36,800
and my body's like
'Start your day; it's 2:00.'"

921
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,133
Then you're driving
to the airport;

922
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:40,067
she's like,
"You gonna come inside?"

923
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:42,200
"Yeah, why wouldn't I?

924
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,767
"Parking there's so convenient.

925
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:46,667
"Besides, I like to start
every day with a two-mile

926
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,067
"stress-filled sprint walk.

927
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:50,700
"Oh, your flight's delayed
an hour and a half?

928
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,467
"Perfect, I'll get a Cinnabon,
get diabetes

929
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:55,367
before you take off."

930
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:56,933
Do you remember?

931
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:58,633
Some guys wouldn't even leave
after they boarded.

932
00:39:58,633 --> 00:39:59,833
They would just stand
at a window

933
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,267
waving at a machine
backing up

934
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:05,033
because they were so happy
to finally be alone.

935
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:07,100
Now what do you get to do
thanks to Osama?

936
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,667
Barely slow down
and kick them to the curb.

937
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:11,933
Yeah, I don't know
about you,

938
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:14,000
but I say
that's worth a tower.

939
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,300
[audience groans]

940
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,200
Not two--not two.

941
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,800
Not two.

942
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,333
Whoa.

943
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:22,600
That was close.

944
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,933
No, no, no,
rightfully so.

945
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:27,900
"I fucking thought
he meant both of them.

946
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,500
"He didn't.
He only meant one.

947
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,200
He cleared it up."

948
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,267
"Which one?"

949
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:35,133
"Does it matter?"

950
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:38,433
"To my uncle."

951
00:40:38,433 --> 00:40:40,900
There you go;
now everyone's offended.

952
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,767
If I can take a--
a quick moment to be sincere,

953
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:51,600
and then I'll go back
to being an asshole,

954
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,400
know that I
appreciate this,

955
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,700
uh, that this isn't lost on me.

956
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,000
I didn't have dreams of grandeur
getting into comedy.

957
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,700
Uh, it's overwhelming.
Uh, thank you for coming out.

958
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,533
I know that eventually
this will come

959
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:04,933
to a crashing halt.

960
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:06,833
I'm not gonna stop
saying awful things.

961
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:08,567
Eventually I'll say
the one thing where it's like,

962
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:11,733
"Oop, there goes his career.

963
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:16,067
Wow, he thought
he could say that, huh?"

964
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:19,767
I actually wrote
a career suicide note.

965
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:22,900
Would you like
to hear it?

966
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,733
Dear Jews...

967
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:30,267
That's all I've got
so far.

968
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:31,267
This--right?

969
00:41:31,267 --> 00:41:32,333
Right now, people are like,

970
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,367
"Oh, fuck, he's doing it.

971
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:35,300
Here we go. God."

972
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,067
Start out strong.

973
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:41,300
Burn some bridges.

974
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,533
No.

975
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,400
I don't meet fans
after the shows

976
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,133
mainly because
I don't want to.

977
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:48,500
For good reason.

978
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,967
I have a very large
social media presence

979
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:54,233
to pat myself on the back
about things that don't matter.

980
00:41:54,233 --> 00:41:59,167
On average, I receive around
1,200 death threats a week.

981
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:01,767
Yeah, no,
it's fun standing up here.

982
00:42:06,967 --> 00:42:08,667
Sorry I don't want
to shake hands with the guy

983
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:13,700
that wrote,
"Die, fag, die. #YoureAFag."

984
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,567
"I'm a fan,
I was kidding."

985
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:18,100
I apologize sincerely
about ticket prices,

986
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,900
but you have to understand,
I can't risk performing

987
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,867
in front of the type of people
that can afford $10.

988
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:29,700
[cheers and applause]

989
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:35,067
And as hard as that joke is
for some of you to swallow,

990
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:36,567
there's other people in here
that are like,

991
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:40,067
"I actually appreciate him
saying that

992
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:42,600
"because I was like,
'This is way too much money,'

993
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,200
"but now that
I think about it, yeah,

994
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,133
I wouldn't stand in front
of those monsters either."

995
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:49,100
You can get lucky
and find a ten.

996
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,233
Like, "Oh,
I'm gonna murder someone."

997
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:52,800
[laughs softly]

998
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:01,700
People accuse me
of everything online.

999
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,200
Misogynistic,
I get that.

1000
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,333
No, I'm just
a male comic with dumb jokes.

1001
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,067
If I was a female comic,
the jokes would be

1002
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:09,100
completely opposite
and empowering,

1003
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,900
and the crowds
would be a lot smaller.

1004
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,200
Yeah, 'cause you don't
support your own, ladies.

1005
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,900
That's on you.

1006
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,100
Racist--
I don't like hearing that.

1007
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,767
I never, never
use the N word...

1008
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,200
into a microphone...

1009
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,933
anymore.

1010
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:30,067
I'm so aware
of social issues.

1011
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:32,667
Even when I'm home alone
doing laundry,

1012
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:36,067
I won't use
the word "colors."

1013
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:37,700
Yeah, I do
a load of whites

1014
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,467
and a load of darkies,
and that's it.

1015
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:42,200
That's it.

1016
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,067
Because I want to be
on the right side of history.

1017
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:49,367
My parents live
in the same house.

1018
00:43:49,367 --> 00:43:52,700
Just to point out what kind
of maniacs some of you are.

1019
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,800
Every day
of my parents' life,

1020
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,200
somebody will
ring the doorbell

1021
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,967
and just be standing
at the door

1022
00:43:57,967 --> 00:44:01,067
and just, like,
staring at my mom.

1023
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:04,067
And my mom will be like,
"Yeah, I'm his mother."

1024
00:44:06,267 --> 00:44:07,600
And they'll be like,
"Is he gay?"

1025
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,167
And then they run away.

1026
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:14,867
I'm not gay.
I have a--

1027
00:44:14,867 --> 00:44:17,933
I have a girlfriend,
not by choice.

1028
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:20,267
I blame Hollywood
for ruining every relationship

1029
00:44:20,267 --> 00:44:21,633
that I've ever been in.

1030
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:24,100
What you don't realize
is how negatively

1031
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,067
they affect
your relationships.

1032
00:44:26,067 --> 00:44:27,700
Everyone's aware
of the liberal media bias

1033
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,567
in the news,
but what about the way

1034
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,967
they portray couples
in every sitcom,

1035
00:44:31,967 --> 00:44:34,233
where there's a dumb husband
chasing his wife around

1036
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:36,067
the whole episode like,
"I want to have sex,"

1037
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:37,600
and she's never in the mood?

1038
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,733
They just hammer
that stereotype home

1039
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:41,500
that men always
want to have sex

1040
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,900
and women never do.

1041
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,267
Let's get this
out of the way right now.

1042
00:44:44,267 --> 00:44:47,700
Women want to have sex
way more often than men.

1043
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,067
[cheers and applause]

1044
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:52,333
I assure you, ladies,
this is not the perspective

1045
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:57,067
you're going to enjoy.

1046
00:44:57,067 --> 00:45:01,300
I don't know if you're new
to my comedy or not.

1047
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,600
I have
a very gender-specific slant

1048
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,333
that I ride pretty hard.

1049
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:08,800
Because the reality is,

1050
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,133
whether you want
to admit it or not,

1051
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:11,967
no man's ever
loved you more

1052
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:13,600
or been more physically
attracted to you

1053
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,300
than he was the first time
he had sex with you.

1054
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,300
And from that moment,
it goes down.

1055
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,067
Okay, now, don't look at him
right now

1056
00:45:21,067 --> 00:45:22,833
and make the evening
uncomfortable.

1057
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,067
"Is that true?"

1058
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:25,767
And then he has to be like...

1059
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:28,800
"No.
I'm pretty sure he's queer.

1060
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,333
I don't care
what he says."

1061
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:37,333
It's true
100% of the time.

1062
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:40,133
How fast it dives
is case by case.

1063
00:45:40,133 --> 00:45:42,367
It doesn't have to fall
off a cliff immediately.

1064
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:44,467
We've all been there
when it does.

1065
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:46,367
Can you be happily married
for 50 years?

1066
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,533
Of course you can,
but know that for him,

1067
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:52,067
every time you have sex,
it's going down a notch.

1068
00:45:52,067 --> 00:45:53,700
Men die ten years earlier

1069
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,200
because we fucking want to.

1070
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,867
Don't make him
feel inadequate.

1071
00:45:58,867 --> 00:46:00,267
Don't challenge his drive.

1072
00:46:00,267 --> 00:46:01,933
"I'm with the only guy
in the world

1073
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:03,700
that doesn't want
to have sex all the time."

1074
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,667
Uh, no, you're not.

1075
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:07,267
When I'm in a relationship,

1076
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:09,767
I can go two to three weeks
without thinking about sex.

1077
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,433
When I'm single,
I need to masturbate

1078
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:13,400
twice a day
before I step outside,

1079
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,967
or I will
sexually assault someone.

1080
00:46:18,967 --> 00:46:21,067
I assure you
his drive is fine.

1081
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:24,433
It's the product
that's sour.

1082
00:46:24,433 --> 00:46:26,800
Is that too harsh?
Your snatch has spoiled.

1083
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,133
Is that softer?

1084
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:32,867
And I know
what your response should be.

1085
00:46:32,867 --> 00:46:34,233
"Well, then
maybe you shouldn't be

1086
00:46:34,233 --> 00:46:36,433
in a relationship
if that's how you feel."

1087
00:46:36,433 --> 00:46:38,200
But that's not
how I'm wired.

1088
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,333
I like to be
in a relationship

1089
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:42,467
at first.

1090
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:45,233
And I won't cheat on you,
and I won't break up.

1091
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:46,900
So every time I fall in love,
I'm like,

1092
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,600
"Fuck, here goes
three years."

1093
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,200
I don't even understand
how real dating sites exist.

1094
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,067
Whenever I'm
in a relationship,

1095
00:46:55,067 --> 00:46:58,067
my dream scenario
is that I come home from work,

1096
00:46:58,067 --> 00:47:03,067
open the door,
and catch her blowing someone.

1097
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:04,900
That's not
a big laugh.

1098
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,800
But notice,
there are people laughing.

1099
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,200
Do you know why?

1100
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,667
Because for the first time
in a long time,

1101
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:13,633
there's guys in here going,
"I'm not alone."

1102
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:17,067
That they can understand
that twisted logic.

1103
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,600
They just come home,
open the door,

1104
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,533
and there she is just...
[guttural humming]

1105
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:22,633
"You're home early."

1106
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,067
And you're like,
"Oh, shit.

1107
00:47:24,067 --> 00:47:26,567
You can't do that.
I'm out of here."

1108
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:28,867
Yeah, no,
we don't even talk anymore.

1109
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:32,533
I'm just
magically happy again.

1110
00:47:32,533 --> 00:47:33,567
Do I get that?
Nope.

1111
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:35,067
Every time
I open the door,

1112
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:38,067
there she is,
"Hi, I'm not blowing anybody.

1113
00:47:38,067 --> 00:47:40,533
Where should we go
for dinner?"

1114
00:47:40,533 --> 00:47:43,067
Gun range?

1115
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:44,600
[laughs]
I'm teasing.

1116
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,400
I'm teasing.

1117
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,067
I've never
drugged a woman.

1118
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:51,967
I feel it's good
if you're a comic

1119
00:47:51,967 --> 00:47:55,900
and can say that truthfully.

1120
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,100
Okay--

1121
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,700
sure, if my girlfriend
asks for Tylenol,

1122
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,267
I'll grab Tylenol PM,

1123
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:03,800
but that's only because
I want to watch TV by myself.

1124
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:08,233
I don't think
I'll go to jail for that.

1125
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,767
If you've ever
convinced your man

1126
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:13,333
to go to a Halloween party
or a costume party

1127
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:15,800
of any sorts
and he's dressed up,

1128
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,067
know that he's
cheated on you.

1129
00:48:19,067 --> 00:48:21,600
You're welcome.

1130
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,433
Now, what you do
with that information

1131
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,067
is up to you.

1132
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:26,367
It's just a theory
I'm working on,

1133
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,067
but I think
it's foolproof.

1134
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:30,333
Because this is how
this conversation should go

1135
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,067
if you're
in a relationship

1136
00:48:32,067 --> 00:48:33,633
with a man
who's never cheated on you.

1137
00:48:33,633 --> 00:48:35,667
"Hey, honey, next week,
we're going to go to this

1138
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:39,567
funny Christmas sweater party."

1139
00:48:39,567 --> 00:48:42,200
"Fuck that."
"What?"

1140
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,233
"Nope, no, I'm not.
I'm an adult.

1141
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:47,733
"I'm gonna stay home
and watch TV

1142
00:48:47,733 --> 00:48:49,633
and then go to bed."

1143
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:52,667
That's what a man says
that has never cheated on you.

1144
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:54,467
A man
that's cheated on you goes,

1145
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:55,500
"Oh, I owe her.

1146
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,933
"Yeah, that sounds fun.

1147
00:48:56,933 --> 00:49:01,100
Let's go."

1148
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,433
I only like this joke
because I know

1149
00:49:02,433 --> 00:49:03,967
there's a guy in here
right now going,

1150
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:08,467
"What the fuck
was that about?

1151
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:11,567
Out of nowhere."

1152
00:49:11,567 --> 00:49:15,400
I grew up in Florida.
I'm a die-hard Dolphins fan.

1153
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,800
Cheering for the Dolphins
is like

1154
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,800
getting tested for an STD.

1155
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,200
I think I could win,
but I know I don't deserve to.

1156
00:49:24,933 --> 00:49:26,400
And I don't care
that people boo.

1157
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,067
You need people
to hate your team,

1158
00:49:28,067 --> 00:49:29,233
or cheering
for your team's no fun.

1159
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,533
That's the whole point.

1160
00:49:30,533 --> 00:49:31,800
If I make a sexist joke

1161
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,933
and a group of women
are offended by it,

1162
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:35,767
these same moron guys
will be like,

1163
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,067
"Oh, the world's so PC.

1164
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:38,467
You can't tell jokes anymore."

1165
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:40,067
But if I make fun
of their team,

1166
00:49:40,067 --> 00:49:42,367
they're like,
"I will fucking kill you."

1167
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,267
Oh, it is so fun to make fun
of people's sports teams.

1168
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:49,967
I'm actually
one of the few people

1169
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:51,367
that's a die-hard Heat fan

1170
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:54,933
that's glad LeBron
went back to Cleveland.

1171
00:49:54,933 --> 00:49:56,667
If you've
never been to Cleveland,

1172
00:49:56,667 --> 00:50:00,233
congratulations.

1173
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:01,633
Cleveland's one
of the few places

1174
00:50:01,633 --> 00:50:03,833
ISIS could fly over
and they'd be like,

1175
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:08,367
"Oh, my goodness,
what happened down there?

1176
00:50:08,367 --> 00:50:11,733
"No one
should have to live like that.

1177
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:15,300
"Is there anything we can do
to help them

1178
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,633
get back on their feet?"

1179
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,533
That's how bad Cleveland--

1180
00:50:21,533 --> 00:50:25,000
you can take a newborn baby
onstage in Cleveland, Ohio,

1181
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
douse it in gasoline,
light it on fire,

1182
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,033
and punt it
into the crowd,

1183
00:50:29,033 --> 00:50:31,400
and they will be
less offended than if you go,

1184
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,967
"Well, I see why
LeBron left this shithole."

1185
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:38,833
Which is all I said
to start my show,

1186
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:41,000
and it ruined it.

1187
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,367
Like, they literally
were like,

1188
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:43,900
"Well, we're
not gonna laugh anymore."

1189
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,200
"Well, I'm not gonna give you
your money back."

1190
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,400
I don't--

1191
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,100
Oh, no,
I burned this market.

1192
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,967
Let's just put it
in perspective for you.

1193
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,200
They crucified this kid
for leaving.

1194
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,033
You forget he was a kid
'cause he looked 40

1195
00:50:58,033 --> 00:51:00,433
when he was 8.

1196
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:03,600
But he left when he was
a 25-year-old billionaire.

1197
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,967
And he's not even
from Cleveland.

1198
00:51:04,967 --> 00:51:06,100
He's from Akron.

1199
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,500
That's a shittier city

1200
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,567
90 miles away,
and--wait for it--

1201
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:14,533
he's from the shitty part
of the shittier city.

1202
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:16,367
And he just wanted
to play basketball

1203
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:19,233
someplace else,
and they killed him.

1204
00:51:19,233 --> 00:51:22,600
I grew up on a private
golf course in Florida.

1205
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,600
If I had a billion dollars
when I was 25 years old,

1206
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,433
I would shit
on this stage mid-set.

1207
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:32,700
Just shit,
stare at you people,

1208
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,600
continue my act,
like, "Hey, pick that up."

1209
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,467
You'd be like,
"What? I'm not picking that up."

1210
00:51:36,467 --> 00:51:38,067
And I'd say, "What'd you say?"

1211
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:40,067
And then I'd throw
a million dollars at your head.

1212
00:51:40,067 --> 00:51:43,400
And you'd be like, "God damn it,
I'm picking this up, aren't I?"

1213
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,633
I would be
out of my mind.

1214
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:48,367
Or when people
get on Justin Bieber

1215
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:50,433
for drinking
and speeding in his car.

1216
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:52,967
Yeah, a 21-year-old
billionaire.

1217
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:54,300
You want to know
how I would act

1218
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,633
if I had that kind of money
at that age?

1219
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:57,500
I would rollerblade
around Los Angeles,

1220
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,833
jerking off
on hot chicks.

1221
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:03,467
None of you
would have an issue with it.

1222
00:52:03,467 --> 00:52:06,867
You'd be like
"That's Daniel, ah."

1223
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:08,133
"He's only 21.

1224
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,600
"He hasn't
figured things out yet.

1225
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,467
"He's worth
a billion dollars.

1226
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:14,267
That's pressure
that I can't relate to."

1227
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:16,200
My opening line
in New Orleans,

1228
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,167
beautiful theater like this,
nice ovation.

1229
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:19,233
I walk onstage.

1230
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:20,500
The first thing
out of my mouth

1231
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,767
before thank you,
"Fuck the Saints.

1232
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:24,567
"I'm not gonna pander
to your city

1233
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:27,700
just because Mother Nature
gave you a much-needed bath."

1234
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,533
Trust me when I tell you

1235
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:36,267
no one in here
has ever experienced

1236
00:52:36,267 --> 00:52:39,167
a wave of hatred
like I have...

1237
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:41,133
as if the levees
had broke again.

1238
00:52:41,133 --> 00:52:42,633
They lost their mind.

1239
00:52:42,633 --> 00:52:44,267
They couldn't even
comprehend it quick enough.

1240
00:52:44,267 --> 00:52:45,533
"What did he say?

1241
00:52:45,533 --> 00:52:49,333
I will murder him
where he stands."

1242
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,067
But then they had
the inner dialogue.

1243
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,100
"That was his first joke.

1244
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,667
We paid a lot.
Go on."

1245
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,267
And the only reason
I say things like that anyway

1246
00:52:59,267 --> 00:53:00,600
is because backstage,
I have friends like,

1247
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,967
"I bet you won't say it."

1248
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:05,067
And apparently
$5 still means something to me.

1249
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:07,733
I'm like, "What? You don't think
I'll ruin the show?

1250
00:53:07,733 --> 00:53:09,633
Watch this."

1251
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,733
I hope the world ends

1252
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:20,200
in my lifetime.

1253
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,200
I want to see it.

1254
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,800
I don't want it
to end tonight.

1255
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,533
And I know
the hand that I was dealt.

1256
00:53:29,533 --> 00:53:31,967
When shit hits the fan,
I don't make good decisions.

1257
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:35,667
I die hour one.

1258
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:37,300
"Hey, we need
to go north."

1259
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,067
"I don't know
where north is.

1260
00:53:40,067 --> 00:53:41,800
I'm gonna
stay here, guys."

1261
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,633
Dead.

1262
00:53:43,633 --> 00:53:45,833
Some of you, you're gonna
survive for a while.

1263
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:46,967
Good for you.

1264
00:53:46,967 --> 00:53:48,400
Sizing people up
as quick as you can.

1265
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,633
"Do you know
how to fly a plane?"

1266
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:51,067
"No."
Knife to the throat.

1267
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:54,500
"Out of my way.
You're useless."

1268
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,133
That's what I've learned
from watching movies.

1269
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:58,433
If anybody ever comes
running up to you screaming,

1270
00:53:58,433 --> 00:54:00,267
"Do you know
how to fly a plane?"

1271
00:54:00,267 --> 00:54:02,667
muster up
some courage in a hurry.

1272
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:04,633
"Yep."

1273
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:07,067
Nobody screaming, "Do you
know how to fly a plane?"

1274
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:10,433
doesn't have horrible things
happening right behind them.

1275
00:54:10,433 --> 00:54:11,733
Just jump
in that cockpit.

1276
00:54:11,733 --> 00:54:13,400
Just start
flipping switches.

1277
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,667
"Calm down.
My plane's a little different.

1278
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:17,833
"Have you out of here
in no time.

1279
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,133
"Does this have a mirror?
No.

1280
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:22,733
Okay, that was a joke, haha."

1281
00:54:22,733 --> 00:54:26,367
That's how you survive
a little bit longer.

1282
00:54:26,367 --> 00:54:28,667
I watch any TV show
with Alaska in the title

1283
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:30,267
just so I can see
what a real man

1284
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,533
is supposed to look like.

1285
00:54:32,533 --> 00:54:34,167
Or Bear Grylls?
I love him.

1286
00:54:34,167 --> 00:54:37,233
A British Green Beret
giving us survival tactics

1287
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:41,400
while we sit
on the couch and snack.

1288
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,667
Come on,
who's that show for?

1289
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:45,667
I can rule out
half the planet.

1290
00:54:45,667 --> 00:54:47,500
I don't know a woman
that can do one pull-up,

1291
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,400
let alone climb a vine
up a waterfall

1292
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,733
to eat a bat.

1293
00:54:51,733 --> 00:54:55,567
Yeah, heads up, ladies,
you're gonna die at the bottom.

1294
00:54:55,567 --> 00:54:59,133
I'm going up there
to eat bat.

1295
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:00,867
Do you know
how to eat a bat?

1296
00:55:00,867 --> 00:55:02,367
I saw this episode.

1297
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:04,133
I'll tell you.
It's not as hard as you think.

1298
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:05,400
First thing
you have to do,

1299
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,067
catch a fucking bat.

1300
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:11,200
I'm out.

1301
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,233
Catch a bat?

1302
00:55:12,233 --> 00:55:13,833
Yeah, I can't kill a fly

1303
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:16,067
in under three hours
in my house with equipment.

1304
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:18,633
You want me to blindly walk
into a scary cave

1305
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:22,333
and barehand
a flying AIDS rat?

1306
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,800
That's literally
all he does.

1307
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,533
He just walks in and just
snatches it by the feet

1308
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:30,133
or hooves
or whatever the fuck bats have.

1309
00:55:30,133 --> 00:55:32,500
And close your eyes, PETA.
Here comes the tough part.

1310
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,333
Then he just bashes it
over a rock

1311
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:35,967
'cause he wants
his snack tender.

1312
00:55:35,967 --> 00:55:37,867
Meanwhile his camera crew's
just laughing,

1313
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,067
eating Luna bars, like,

1314
00:55:39,067 --> 00:55:42,800
"What the fuck
is wrong with him?

1315
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,633
"Doesn't this stinky
Brit realize

1316
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,500
"American reality television
is fake?

1317
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,100
"We can pause the camera
and put granola and pudding down

1318
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:52,633
"and be like, 'You have
to eat your bat to survive.'"

1319
00:55:52,633 --> 00:55:54,100
He's chewing on a real bat;
he's like,

1320
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,200
"Uh-oh, this could be
a poisonous bat."

1321
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,767
What the fuck
did you just say?

1322
00:55:58,767 --> 00:56:01,067
It's 11:30 at night.
I'm trying to go to bed.

1323
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:04,567
Now I have to get up
and Google what bats are edible?

1324
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:06,300
"If there's
a faint yellow diamond

1325
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,867
under the left eye,
be wary."

1326
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,533
I'm looking at women
that aren't laughing.

1327
00:56:11,533 --> 00:56:12,933
My guess is,
you're hung up on the part

1328
00:56:12,933 --> 00:56:14,500
where I said
you can't do a pull-up

1329
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,733
and you checked out?

1330
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:19,733
"I can do a pull-up."

1331
00:56:19,733 --> 00:56:21,667
Yeah, and there's a reason
you're here alone.

1332
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:25,500
Your shoulders are gross
and nobody likes you.

1333
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,300
You should knock it off
with the CrossFit.

1334
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,933
Nobody needs
to flip a tire in 2015.

1335
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:33,067
We all have AAA.

1336
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:36,100
You haven't had your period
in four years for a reason.

1337
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,933
You're growing a dick.

1338
00:56:37,933 --> 00:56:39,400
Now--

1339
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,700
now lighten up.

1340
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,200
May I open the door for you?

1341
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,367
"Nope, I've got it."

1342
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:47,300
[blows forcefully]

1343
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,600
"Woman."

1344
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,267
You're the superior sex.

1345
00:56:51,267 --> 00:56:52,800
I don't care.

1346
00:56:57,067 --> 00:56:58,433
You ever get road rage?

1347
00:56:58,433 --> 00:56:59,733
That's embarrassing.

1348
00:56:59,733 --> 00:57:01,667
I've had road rage before
and won,

1349
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,700
and I've had road rage
and lost.

1350
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,300
I'm gonna tell you
two different stories.

1351
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,733
You can determine
which is which.

1352
00:57:07,733 --> 00:57:09,400
And the first one,
I want to point out,

1353
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,867
I was pretty young
at the time.

1354
00:57:10,867 --> 00:57:12,533
And the only reason
I want you to know that

1355
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:14,933
is because I don't approve
of what I said.

1356
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:16,900
But I had just moved
out here to Los Angeles.

1357
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,167
I was in traffic in my Acura
with the sunroof open.

1358
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:25,100
Yeah, I was doing pretty well
from day one.

1359
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:29,800
Started from the upper-middlish.
Now I'm here.

1360
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,700
I was yelling
through my sunroof

1361
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,233
at a guy
in a delivery truck,

1362
00:57:33,233 --> 00:57:35,133
and I don't remember
what we were fighting over.

1363
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:37,233
But at one point,
I may have yelled,

1364
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:39,267
"That's why you have
to work on Saturday,

1365
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:43,267
you piece of shit."

1366
00:57:43,267 --> 00:57:47,767
And then he spit
a mouthful of Doritos onto me.

1367
00:57:52,467 --> 00:57:55,067
So I lost, right?

1368
00:57:55,067 --> 00:57:58,667
If a man spits a mouthful
of Doritos on your face,

1369
00:57:58,667 --> 00:57:59,800
you have two options.

1370
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,200
You can, one,
get a machete

1371
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,833
and murder everyone
in his family.

1372
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:06,067
Or, two,
you can close your sunroof

1373
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:09,867
because that psycho
is not bluffing.

1374
00:58:09,867 --> 00:58:12,067
I had chewed-up Dorito
on my lip.

1375
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:14,300
I can still feel it
right now.

1376
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,633
I didn't have any napkins
in my glove compartment.

1377
00:58:16,633 --> 00:58:18,300
That was
over 15 years ago.

1378
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,067
You think there's napkins
in my glove compartment today?

1379
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:21,867
You're goddamn right
there is.

1380
00:58:21,867 --> 00:58:23,367
Every time
I go to a restaurant,

1381
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:25,400
I take a big "fuck you
to the environment" stack.

1382
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,367
And they're like, "Hey,
don't take so many napkins."

1383
00:58:27,367 --> 00:58:30,600
I'm like, "I had chewed-up
Dorito from another man

1384
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,667
on my face."

1385
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,733
Now, here's a time more recently
that I had road rage.

1386
00:58:39,733 --> 00:58:42,467
I think I handled things
a little more maturely.

1387
00:58:42,467 --> 00:58:43,767
Again, I was
in Los Angeles.

1388
00:58:43,767 --> 00:58:45,333
I was on
the 10 Freeway eastbound,

1389
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:47,333
middle lane--
don't know what that says

1390
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:50,833
about my personality,
but that's where you'll find me.

1391
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:52,700
I'm not
an aggressive driver.

1392
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,367
Drive a station wagon.
I was doing nothing wrong.

1393
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:58,067
I saw a car
changing lanes,

1394
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:00,333
driving like a maniac,
cutting people off.

1395
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:01,767
He was coming toward me.

1396
00:59:01,767 --> 00:59:03,267
He wanted me
to get out of the way.

1397
00:59:03,267 --> 00:59:04,700
I chose not to.

1398
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,167
I'm like, "Fuck it,
slam into me."

1399
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,067
He didn't,
but he got on my bumper,

1400
00:59:08,067 --> 00:59:09,933
and he was irritated,
and he was flipping me off.

1401
00:59:09,933 --> 00:59:11,333
I notice he has
a wedding ring on,

1402
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:13,300
and his wife's
in the front seat.

1403
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,900
And at that moment,
oh, I got real confident.

1404
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,633
Because I'm like,
"There's no way

1405
00:59:18,633 --> 00:59:20,467
"you're gonna go
to the level of crazy

1406
00:59:20,467 --> 00:59:22,800
"that I'm about to,

1407
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,133
not with your wife
sitting next to you."

1408
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:27,767
Like, at some point, she's gonna
have to be the voice of reason.

1409
00:59:27,767 --> 00:59:31,067
Like, "Stop it, Phillip.
Just drive. I'm scared."

1410
00:59:33,267 --> 00:59:34,767
So I got real brave, right?

1411
00:59:34,767 --> 00:59:36,367
I'm flipping him off.
I'm brake checking.

1412
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:38,633
I'm holding
the windshield wiper fluid on.

1413
00:59:38,633 --> 00:59:40,967
Like--
is that your move?

1414
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:42,900
Yeah, oh,
very passive-aggressive.

1415
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,267
I've cleared my calendar.

1416
00:59:44,267 --> 00:59:46,133
I'm doing nothing
for the rest of my life

1417
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:50,067
except irritating
this asshole behind me.

1418
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:52,133
We're going about
ten miles an hour on the freeway

1419
00:59:52,133 --> 00:59:54,200
at this point,
and he won't pass me.

1420
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,567
I kind of respect it.

1421
00:59:55,567 --> 00:59:57,600
I'm out of fluid.
My exit's coming up.

1422
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,067
So I get off the freeway,

1423
00:59:59,067 --> 01:00:02,033
and then he follows me
right off the freeway.

1424
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:04,267
And at that moment,
the real Daniel

1425
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,733
came crashing back,

1426
01:00:05,733 --> 01:00:09,767
where I'm like,
"Aw, shit.

1427
01:00:09,767 --> 01:00:12,767
"You were supposed
to keep driving.

1428
01:00:12,767 --> 01:00:14,500
"That's not your wife.

1429
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,267
That's a hooker you're gonna
murder, isn't it?"

1430
01:00:16,267 --> 01:00:17,533
Like--

1431
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:18,833
You got to think fast.
What do you do?

1432
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:20,367
Well, I know
this exit.

1433
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,133
It's the Robertson exit,
if you want to verify it.

1434
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:24,767
There's a very large
black homeless guy at the bottom

1435
01:00:24,767 --> 01:00:26,633
with a sign
that just said "Food."

1436
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:28,633
I aggressive drove
toward him

1437
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:30,033
with this guy
right on my bumper,

1438
01:00:30,033 --> 01:00:31,867
slammed on my brakes
to a dead stop

1439
01:00:31,867 --> 01:00:34,000
so he's pinned behind me,
can't get around.

1440
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,533
I roll my window down.
I give the guy $20.

1441
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:40,567
I say, "You need to go crazy
on the car behind me."

1442
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:42,167
I swear,
he doesn't even hesitate.

1443
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:44,400
Both hands on the hood,
cocks his head,

1444
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,633
starts screaming at the guy.

1445
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:46,833
Meanwhile I'm like,
"Oh, shit,

1446
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,867
he's gonna murder him too."

1447
01:00:48,867 --> 01:00:50,567
Now I got
blood on my hands,

1448
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:52,667
but I don't really care
'cause it's a homeless guy.

1449
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:54,033
And I'm like,
"It's probably not even

1450
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:55,433
the worst decision
he's made today."

1451
01:00:55,433 --> 01:00:56,967
So I take off.

1452
01:00:56,967 --> 01:00:58,633
And the driver shoots me
one last look,

1453
01:00:58,633 --> 01:01:01,133
and I appreciate it because
he certainly didn't have to.

1454
01:01:01,133 --> 01:01:04,433
But he gave me the, uh,
"You won."

1455
01:01:04,433 --> 01:01:06,500
[cheers and applause]

1456
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,600
And I've never
felt better about anything

1457
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,067
I have ever done
in my entire life.

1458
01:01:12,067 --> 01:01:14,067
You know,
for the rest of his life,

1459
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:16,100
every time he gets
in the car with his wife,

1460
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,867
she's gonna be like,
"You remember the one time

1461
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:20,667
"with the homeless guy, uh?

1462
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:24,667
Maybe I should drive.
That's all I'm saying, hothead."

1463
01:01:24,667 --> 01:01:26,833
So remember that
next time you lose your cool

1464
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,067
behind the wheel.

1465
01:01:28,067 --> 01:01:29,467
Calm down.

1466
01:01:29,467 --> 01:01:31,300
Find a homeless person.

1467
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,867
Pay them to do it for you.

1468
01:01:32,867 --> 01:01:36,100
Way safer, and you feel good
about yourself.

1469
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,967
And the only part of that story
I embellished

1470
01:01:37,967 --> 01:01:39,900
even the slightest bit
was the amount of money

1471
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,600
that I gave him,
because if you think

1472
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,900
I'm giving out 20s,

1473
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,700
you're fucking crazier
than he was.

1474
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,567
Thank you very much.
Good night.

1475
01:01:47,567 --> 01:01:48,867
