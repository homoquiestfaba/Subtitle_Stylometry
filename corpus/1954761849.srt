Would you turn that off?

19
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,668
It just needs a better
operating system, Josh.

20
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,837
It needs a better everything.

Let's go, guys.
We're late.

I've got a good feeling
about tonight, Josh.

I really do.

Max, you always
have a good feeling.

Not always.

I just want to say
one thing to you

No matter what happens tonight,

I think you guys
are the greatest.

our two-time winner...
Dwayne kotzwinkle.

00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,786
That's my boy.

54
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,623
May I have the envelope, please?

55
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,804
Well.

56
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,572
This is unusual.

57
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,309
Our judges seem to be split

58
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,445
between Dwayne kotzwinkle...

In cases of a tie,

63
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,391
we ask for a demonstration,

64
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,694
a sort of play-off.

65
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,896
How about it, boys?

66
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,671
Dwayne's not gonna
win it this year.

67
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,408
Every year
his dad helps him.
Every year he wins.

That's my boy.

69
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:48,046
After you've had a hard,
long day on the court,

70
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:52,851
sometimes you're too tired
to pick up the balls.

72
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,855
So with my back-saver here,

73
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:03,462
all you have to do
is aim the magic wand.

74
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,367
And presto...

75
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,502

76
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:18,143
Thank you, Dwayne.

77
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:21,847
Um, your turn, boys.

78
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,983
Yeah...

80
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,088
We call this the transporter.

81
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,058
It's a voice-activated
garbage-can mover.

82
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,161
We thought elderly people
could use it

83
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:40,065
to get their garbage
from their homes
to the street.

84
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,433

85

Emily, stop!

86
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,806
It also has sonar sensors,

87
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:51,143
so it won't run anyone down.

88
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,587
I think we've got our winner...

89
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,122
Josh and Max Carson.

90
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,525
Yes!

91
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,809
Congratulations, Max.

92
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,677
Thanks.

93

Boy, $1,000.

94
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,046
What are you going to do
with all that money?

95
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:32,584
Well, Josh wants
to give half to mom.

96
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:33,852
She's sort of broke.

97
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,655
We'll spend the rest on Newman.

98
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,657
Newman?

00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,157
Yeah. He's our robot.

Top secret, huh?

102
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,899
Sorry.

103
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,633
Josh is a little paranoid
till we get a patent.

104

Well, you never
can be too careful.

not before breakfast.

your contest money.

for your robot...

119
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,589

His name is Newman

121
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,126

to be a new man someday.

we'll get Newman
the best money can buy.

127
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:03,108
Remember, $500 is not that much.

128

the house later.

I like it here.

Sweetie, I like it, too.

135
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,191
We just can't afford it.

136
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:23,194
If we sold Newman,
we'd make some money.

137
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,898
Then we wouldn't
have to sell the house.

138
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,333
Save it, Max.

139
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:31,036
Give Newman a chance.

140
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,738
With better components,
he can really work.

141
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,140
I'm sure he can, sweetie.

142
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:38,977
It's just that inventing
takes such a long time.

it would take your dad

a new computer?

Why do you keep
talking about him?

I don't want to hear
about him anymore.

He was your father.

he killed himself?

explain to you

how someday computers
may be able to think
all on their own.

Some experts predict
it will be 10-25 years

can take in information...

00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,382
10 and 15.

189
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,833
Oh, come on, Alice,
they're babies.

190
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,803
Mel, I know
there's a story here.

191
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,905
I can taste it.

192
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:51,309
Resistors... Servos.

193
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,812
Josh, look...
A 320 triax.

194
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:57,415
Max, we need to get
a lot of stuff.

195
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:01,152
We can't afford
to get it all here.

196
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,855
Sure!
We got 500 bucks.

197
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:07,325
So how was I supposed to know

198
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,829
a triax costs 250 bucks?

199
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,130
Yo, guys.

200
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,300
Steve, where the hell
have you been?

201
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,168
Hi, honey.
Where's Max?

202
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,104
He's with Steve.

203
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,271
Yo!

204
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,207
I'm ready for the freeway.

205
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,442
Ok, turn, turn, turn.

206
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,112
I got it.
I got it.

207
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,446
Ohh.

208
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,382
Let's do this again tomorrow.

209
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,885
Hey, three-point landing.

210
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:37,188
Here's your stuff.

211
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,261
Kid's a natural.

212
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,230
The natural is 10 years old.

213
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:49,300
Hey, Josh. Max told me
about the contest.
Congratulations.

214
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,102
Oh, thanks.

215
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,206
I invited Steve for dinner, ok?

216
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,108
Sure.

217
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,547
It was his idea.
Really.

218
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,915
Hi.

219
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,383
Hi.

220
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,286
When did you get back?

221
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,988
You miss me?

222
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,491
Did you finish your story?

223
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,260
Almost.

224
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,096
Did you miss me with a passion

225
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,864
that knows no bounds?

226
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,484
Almost.

227
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:25,103
So, when are we getting married?

228
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,204
Ahh...

229
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,239
Mmm, I don't know.

230
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,949
Ahem.

231
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:44,289
You know,
you may not
believe this,

232
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,158
but somewhere deep,
deep down inside,

233
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,227
he really likes me.

234
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,168
We don't need
that much more stuff,

235
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,104
do we?

236
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,039
I thought we wanted
an articulated
appendage,

237
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,008
linear actuator, gated servos...

238
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,176
Ok, ok.

239
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,343
We'll have to trade for them.

240
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:10,248
Well, there's only
one person who...

241
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,152
No. I'm not
going to him.

242
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,287
Forget it.

243
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:21,359
Why did I let you
talk me into this?

244
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,029
It'll be fine.
Trust me.

245
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,924
Well, well.

246
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:56,227
If it isn't the Carson brothers.

247
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:01,299
What can I do for you, boys?

248
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,170
We have some stuff
we want to trade.

249
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,338
Oh, you're
mass-producing

250
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,942
your garbage transporter, huh?

251
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,110
No.

252
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,645
Something new?

253
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:16,114
Yeah, it's a rob... ouch!

254
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,082
It's nothing.

255
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,218
Well, I don't think

256
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,287
we can let our
professional rivalry

257
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:28,927
stand in the way
of doing a little
business.

258
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,195
Dwayne, get up here!

259
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,631
Aw, dad.

260
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,670
What are they doing here?

261
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:41,339
Will you just shut up?

262
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:44,242
They're clients now.

263
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:47,445
Very nice.

264
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,380
Daddy's?

265
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,283
We need...

266
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,353
Five miniservos,

267
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:58,556
linear actuator 5148...

268
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,693
I think we can do some business.

269
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,228
Get to it, Dwayne.

270
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,701
We're never going there again.

271
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,436
Why not?

272
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,339
I like that iguana.

273
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,273
Yeah, right.

274
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:19,277
Hey, you think I'm going back?

275
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,379
Not on my life.

276
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,315
Hey!

277
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,383
What?

278
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,518
Be gentle.

279
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,221
Yeah, ok.

280
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,437
Max.

281
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,333
That's it.

282
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,075
Let's program him.

283
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,377
Right.

284
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,321
Ok.

285
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,722
Teach him how to wave.

286
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:15,626
Wave? Why does he need
to know how to wave?

287
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,046
It's friendly.

288
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:20,465
Well, let's see
if he'll move first.

289
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,166
Got to expect some bugs.

290
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,268
Dad always said,
"no bugs, no bytes."

291
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,271
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

292
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:30,741
Ok...

293
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:34,412
Here it goes.

294
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,415
All right!
We have movement.

295
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,417
Teach him how to wave.

296
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,853
Ok, I'll try.

297
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,170
Newman, stop!

298
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,538
It's not responding.

299
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,273
What's he doing?

300
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,674
I don't know.

301
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,244
Stop it!

302
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:06,911
Newman!

303
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,347
Get him! Quick!

304
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,750
Josh, get him to stop.
He'll break something.

305
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,352
Newman!

306
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:15,920
Oh, Newman!

307
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,255
Please!

308
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,257
Newman!

309
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:21,225
Stop! Come on!

310
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:26,264
Uh-oh. It's that reporter
from the contest.

311
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,636
My boss is very excited
about this story.

312
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:35,706
Oh, I think the boys
will love the idea.

313
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,675
Josh.

314
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,379
Max?

315
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,715
I don't know.

316
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,185
Yieaah!

317
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,724
Are you sure you're all right?

318
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,359
I'm fine. Really.

319
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,011
Mom, this very second

320
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,662
Richard Williams
is stuffing his face

321
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,398
with all the best candy.

322
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,767
He takes Halloween
very seriously.

323
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:03,935
Well, so did I.

324
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:07,305
I was always
the first one there.

325
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,239
So...

326
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,907
Did you finish your robot?

327
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,776
We don't have a robot.

328
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,561
What?

329
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:15,345
Sorry you came all this way

330
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,747
for nothing, miss woods.

331
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:21,319
Well, don't worry
about it, Josh.

332
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,887
Thank you, Mrs. Carson.

333
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,655
I'll see myself out.

334
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,490
See you, Max.

335
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,292
Bye.

336
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,230
What's going on?

337
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,799
Mom, she's a snooper.

338
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,367
She could be a spy
for a robotics company.

339
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,002
A spy?

340
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,303
Josh, she's a reporter.

341
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:42,273
Until we get
a patent for Newman,

342
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,741
he's off limits,

343
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,443
especially to her.

344
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,011
Josh.

345
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:49,280
Next time, be more polite.

346
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,482
Sorry, mom.

347
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:56,420
Tomorrow we put in
a security system.

348
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:03,294
Honey.

349
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:08,399
Try and have a good time, ok?

350
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:12,436
And give my love to Beth.

351
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,742
<i>¶ Baby ¶</i>

352
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,594
boo!

353
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:21,445
<i>¶ You're scarin' me ¶</i>

354
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:26,017
<i>¶ you're my nightmare ¶</i>

355
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,487
<i>¶ my fantasy... ¶</i>

356
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:46,003
I vant to suck your blood.

357
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,306
Not now, stupid.

358
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,641
<i>¶ Baby ¶</i>

359
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:54,445
<i>¶ you're scarin' me ¶</i>

360
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,749
<i>¶ you're my nightmare... ¶</i>

361
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,318
are you concentrating, Timmy?

362
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,853
Don't push down so hard.

363
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:05,022
It will work this time.

364
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,091
Josh.

365
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,728
No, wait.

366
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,763
Come on.

367
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,633
You've got to try this.

368
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,902
Let Josh have a turn.

369
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,670
I was contacting Napoleon.

370
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,505
Later, Timmy.

371
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,112
What is this?

372
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,881
A telephone to heaven.

373
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,950
Put your fingers on here,

374
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,385
and open your mind.

375
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:37,988
Is there anyone
you want to contact?

376
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,390
What?

377
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:42,543
No.

378
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:45,695
Is there anyone who wants
to contact Josh Carson?

379
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,798
You do.

380
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:55,539
Is there anyone
who wants to contact Josh?

381
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,541
Come on, come on.

382
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,444
Come on, come on.

383
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:11,122
"D."

384
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,930
"A."

385
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,537
"D."

386
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,672
Dad?

387
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,879
Very funny.

388
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,748
Wait, Josh!

389
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,616
I didn't do anything.
I promise.

390
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,959
[Meow]

391
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,691
[Meow]

392
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,823
Mom?

393
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,563
[Crash]

394
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,199
Max?

395
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,062
Hello?

396
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:31,922
[Meow]

397
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,725
Charlie.

398
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,161
[Purring]

399
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,063
[Meow]

400
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,105
[Sniffing]

401
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:51,742
Charlie, have you been smoking?

402
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,277
[Meow]

403
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:18,789
[Meow]

404
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:38,108
Are you out of your mind
breaking into their house?

405
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,309
Mel, I saw something.

406
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,044
A hand doesn't mean squat.

407
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,513
This hand was not human.

408
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:44,248
It belonged to a robot?

409
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,949
There was this flash of light.

410
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,252
Maybe the robot
was taking snapshots.

411
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:49,887
Mel, please.

412
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,155
I need this one.

413
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:53,774
Ok, but this time,

414
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:56,392
make sure
you get something
on tape, all right?

415
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,165
Josh...

416
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:05,235
I think somebody has a question.

417
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,284
I'm really sorry.

418
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:24,105
I didn't know about your dad.

419
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:27,925
I just thought your
parents were divorced
like everybody else's.

420
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,326
Uh... It's ok.

421
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,103
Josh, did anything
weird happen after
you left the party?

422
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,191
Why?

423
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:46,142
Well, 'cause
when I picked up
the pointer,

424
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:48,278
it was hot.

425
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:52,249
Something did happen, didn't it?

426
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,585
The house kind of felt...

427
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:57,354
Th-there was this smell...
Oh, forget it.

428
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,257
No, tell me.
What smell?

429
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,192
Pipe smoke.

430
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,178
My dad...

431
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:06,163
Hey, Carson. How you
doing, wimp?

432
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,498
Hey, Beth.
I got tickets...

433
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,300
Get lost, Dwayne.

434
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:12,169
I don't like to lose, Carson.

435
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:14,471
Don't you forget it.

436
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:27,217
<i>Test-testing. Testing.</i>

437
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,318
<i>All right.</i>

438
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,621
<i>Now to find the real me.</i>

439
00:31:30,623 --> 00:31:34,258
[Low-pitched voice]
<i>No, no. That's not it.</i>

440
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,593
<i>Let me see here...</i>

441
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:39,630
[High-pitched voice]
<i>No. That's not it, either.</i>

442
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:41,398
<i>Testing.</i>

443
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,269
[Normal male voice]
All right.
Now we're talking.

444
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:52,242
Are those for one
of your inventions?

445
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,076
Yeah.

446
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,678
Could I see it?

447
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,431
Oh, I don't know.

448
00:31:57,432 --> 00:32:00,183
Please. Your garbage
transporter is so cool.

449
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,219
Please?

450
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:05,589
Max, Lester's
on the phone, sweetie.

451
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,324
Ok.

452
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,228
Ok, let's go.

453
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,130
Wait.

454
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,336
I didn't want you
to trip the alarm.

455
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:21,071
Oh, really?

456
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,210
Oh, he's adorable.

457
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:28,278
He's ok.

458
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,148
I think it's wonderful.

459
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,151
I think you both are.

460
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,256
Well, that's it?
No show?

461
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:42,125
Uh, s-some
other time.

462
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,262
Please, Josh?

463
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,098
Ok.

464
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,500
But don't expect much.

465
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,569
Cool.

466
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:12,022
God, that's great.

467
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,757
What's this for?

468
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,360
Uh, it tells him
how hard to squeeze.

469
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:18,328
When he grabs something,
fibers rustle,

470
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,664
and a microphone
hears it underneath
the finger.

471
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:27,237
As his grip tightens,
the mic tells the hand
to stop squeezing.

472
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:31,074
At least that's what's
supposed to happen.

473
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:34,277
That's so brilliant.

474
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:35,512
Oh, well...

475
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,647
Well, can he pick this up?

476
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,283
No. That would take
major programming.

477
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:44,354
Please, just try it for me.
Then I'll go. I promise.

478
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,522
Oh, ok.

479
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,425
But it's not going to work.

480
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:02,572
See? I told you.

481
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:21,058
[Robot voice]
Here, Beth. After you
tighten my screws,

482
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,693
could you scratch my back?

483
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,729
I didn't do that.
Honestly.

484
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:29,266
Yeah, right.
I suppose he did.

485
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,468
What's she doing here?

486
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,402
Max.

487
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,937
Hi, Max.

488
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,471
Beth is borrowing a screwdriver.

489
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:38,442
Uh, keep it.
We've got plenty.

490
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:39,709
Thanks, Josh.

491
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,278
See ya.

492
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,413
How did you do it?

493
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,148
What?

494
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,753
Get him to talk.

495
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,455
Talk?

496
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,796
Wait a minute.

497
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,699
I know he picks up things.

498
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:05,502
Have you been drinking?

499
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:11,375
This is crazy.

500
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:14,478
He was doing all sorts
of stuff for Beth and me.

501
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:17,131
[Robot voice]
Hi, boys.

502
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:19,416
[Normal voice]
What do you think
of my robot voice?

503
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,718
Ok, who's doing this?

504
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,254
I know it's a different look,

505
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,555
but the voice?

506
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:26,690
Dad?
Dad?

507
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:28,125
Bingo.

508
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:29,326
Look at you two.

509
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:32,262
You've grown, and I've shrunk.

510
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,197
Is this amazing?
I can't believe
I made it back here.

511
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,766
How'd you get in there, dad?

512
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,536
Josh called me from
the Halloween party...

513
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,304
Super-long distance.

514
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,290
What?

515
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,275
I tried getting back,
but you know me
with directions.

516
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:47,210
Anyway, I'm here thanks to Beth.

517
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:49,713
She's cute.
A little pushy, but cute.

518
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:53,383
I was afraid I'd end up
in the TV.

519
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,718
You did, sort of.

520
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,620
We scrapped it for Newman.

521
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:58,822
Good. I bet you're
reading more.

522
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:01,591
That was you moving
the pointer around?

523
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,077
Well, it wasn't Napoleon,

524
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,562
although he did give me
some tips. He loves games.

525
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,198
You know Napoleon?

526
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,766
Yeah. Napoleon,
Einstein.

527
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,935
Your grandma Millie's up there.

528
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:14,604
She sends hugs and kisses.

529
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,640
What?

530
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,675
Max, I could use a hand in here.

531
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,443
Listen, we'll talk later.

532
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:23,313
Promise not to
tell your mom yet.

533
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:25,882
You know how she
hates surprises.

534
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:28,185
But, dad...

535
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,487
It's ok, Max.
Go help your mom.

536
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,657
I wish you could eat with us.

537
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:36,126
Me, too,

538
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,594
but my stomach's
not what it
used to be.

539
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,803
Come on.

540
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:13,396
Good night, guys.

541
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,398
Night, mom.

542
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,832
Good night.

543
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:17,801
Ok. Let's go.

544
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:20,370
Wait. She's not
even in bed yet.

545
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:23,306
Do you think
dad's cramped
inside Newman?

546
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:25,275
What?

547
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,243
He seems nicer.
Does he seem nicer
to you?

548
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,479
Maybe being dead
has made him nicer.

549
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:32,415
Will you stop for a second?

550
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,966
Ah, Sarah.

551
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:54,971
Max, get back to bed, young man.

552
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,307
Uh-oh. Ouch.

553
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:01,544
Remind me to get curb feelers.

554
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:02,996
Josh, look.

555
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:04,046
[Newman]
I think she saw me.

556
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:06,316
Let's get him out of here.

557
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,618
What is that?

558
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,486
What?

559
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,388
You know what.

560
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,056
Um... That?

561
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:15,358
Newman.

562
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,293
Newman?

563
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:18,061
Yeah.

564
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,596
I think you scared him.

565
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:23,400
<i>I</i> scared<i> him?</i>

566
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:27,437
So this is Newman.

567
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,807
Hello, Newman.

568
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,609
[Robot voice]
It's a pleasure to
see you, Mrs. Carson.

569
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:36,346
Really a pleasure.

570
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:39,516
You look stunning in that robe.

571
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:42,852
I admit, I thought
a robot was ambitious,

572
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,454
even for the two of you.

573
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:47,891
More cocoa,
Mrs. Carson?

574
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,426
Thank you.

575
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:51,361
You're so welcome.

576
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:55,098
You'll go loco for my cocoa.

577
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,766
He's incredible.

578
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,901
More cocoa, Josh?

579
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:00,070
I'm surprised
he's so sophisticated.

580
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:01,371
Us, too.

581
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:02,105
Marshmallows?

582
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:04,407
Quit showing off.

583
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:05,041
Cookies?

584
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,076
How did you do it?

585
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:08,745
Why not go to bed?
It's getting late.

586
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:10,163
Good idea.

587
00:39:10,164 --> 00:39:11,580
I'm here to serve you.

588
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,016
What else can he do?

589
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,851
Mom, he's still experimental.

590
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,853
¶ I can also sing ¶

591
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,688
when will you know?

592
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,522
He may look finished,
but he really isn't.

593
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,392
He still needs testing.

594
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:23,394
Testing 1-2-3.

595
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:26,396
We got school tomorrow, huh?

596
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,248
You're right.

597
00:39:28,249 --> 00:39:30,099
I got carried...
This is very exciting.

598
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:31,368
I agree.

599
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,036
He's so cute.

600
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,137
Thank you.

601
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,438
Newman, get the light.

602
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,610
Isn't anybody going to
leave a tip?

603
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:48,385
[Matthew's voice]
A robot's work
is never done.

604
00:39:57,662 --> 00:40:00,663
Hey, pepe.

605
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,365
Shoo!

606
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,066
I'm the only one
watering around here.

607
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,735
Little squirt.

608
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:12,609
Ah, at least now
I have time to stop
and smell the roses.

609
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:17,080
Make that
stop and<i> kill</i> the roses.

610
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:32,128
You're a wonderful help.

611
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,880
[Robot voice]
Thank you.

612
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:35,631
I can't believe
how much you can do.

613
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:39,936
Your boys are very ingenious.

614
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,137
They certainly are.

615
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,040
Tsk. I wish Matt
could see them.

616
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,109
He was your husband?

617
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:49,379
Yeah.

618
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,648
May I ask what you
are thinking now?

619
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:55,085
Ahem.

620
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,520
I was thinking
I can't believe
we're talking like this.

621
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,122
Neither can I.

622
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:03,693
Did he do special
things for you?

623
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:08,465
Something good, maybe?

624
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,583
Yeah.

625
00:41:10,584 --> 00:41:12,167
He gave a great foot massage.

626
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,937
Hmm.

627
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,208
[Doorbell chimes]

628
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,710
Intruders.

629
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:22,579
Hi. I'm back.

630
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:27,083
I got off
on the wrong foot
with your boys.

631
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:28,184
I'd love to try again.

632
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:31,087
If I could
talk to them
for a minute...

633
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:33,590
Miss woods, I don't
want to be rude,

634
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:36,092
but the boys really
aren't interested.

635
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:40,196
Josh is having
a hard time.
His father died,

636
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:41,981
we're moving...

637
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:43,765
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize...

638
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,635
[beeping]

639
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,871
That's my office.

640
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,106
Could I use your phone?
Just for a second.

641
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:53,009
There's... there's one
in the kitchen

642
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,143
if that would...

643
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:56,179
This will be fine.

644
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:00,717
Please, don't let me keep you.

645
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,218
Ok.

646
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:06,523
Hi, Mac, what's up?

647
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:11,528
Yeah, ok.
I'll be there in 15.

648
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,297
No, I'm out at the Carson house.

649
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:17,066
I think this is a dead one.

650
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,235
Guess you were right.

651
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:24,274
But then again, you never know.

652
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,815
Would you like some coffee?

653
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,751
I'll talk to you later.

654
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:37,921
I've got to run.

655
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:41,090
Some wife's thrown
her husband out of
the house... literally.

656
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,059

00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,674
Your robot is incredible.

660
00:42:57,676 --> 00:43:00,610
I still
can't believe
it can talk.

661
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:03,346
Are you going to sell it?

662
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:04,080
No.

663
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,015
He's not ready yet.

664
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:09,886
Well, he sure seemed
ready to me.

665
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:14,057
Josh, you're a genius.

666
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:21,230

to be on the cover
of<i> people</i> magazine.

what you told me.

where that bucket was?

Uh...

Max?

Max hates to clean.

That's why he showed me.

679
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:08,878
You see, I'm
every kid's
dream come true.

680

I got these moves,

I wasn't interested
in a child's robot.

But this is
Matthew Carson's
kids here.

If he was involved,
it could be worth
a fortune.

Matthew Carson's
been dead for two years.

701
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:38,067
Or maybe this is your subtle way

702

of asking for more money.

703
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:44,941

Hi.

710
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:19,942
Could be yours.

Is this a bribe?

712
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:25,047
Of course not.

713
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:27,550

would be like
to be famous.

anything you wanted,

having for dinner.

I have no idea
how he knew it was
your favorite.

00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:06,048
Or second... Maybe.

742
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:18,427
Your husband was quite
good-looking for a human.

743
00:48:31,643 --> 00:48:36,612
I'm sure he misses
you all very much.

744
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:54,263
[Josh]
Happy now?

745
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,933
[Matthew's voice]
What?

746
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,701
Mom's a total wreck
'cause of you.

747
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:02,405
Why don't you just
leave us alone?

748
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,642
I didn't like you
when you were alive,

749
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:08,644
and I don't like you now.

750
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,246
Josh, stop it!

751
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:13,215
You think I feel sorry for you?

752
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:15,584
You're the one
who killed yourself.

753
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:16,986
[Matthew's voice]
Killed myself?

754
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:18,187
Is that what you thought?

755
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:21,991
I didn't kill
myself. It was
an accident.

756
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:23,259
Yeah, right.

757
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:25,261
Look, my car went off the cliff,

758
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:27,029
but I didn't do it on purpose.

759
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:31,067
I lost control
trying to avoid
a... Skunk.

760
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:33,102
Skunk?

761
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,136
Everybody thought
you were so depressed
before you...

762
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,273
I was upset, but
I had a good reason.

763
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:41,310
I never told you
this, but three days
before the accident,

764
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,678
someone stole the prototype

765
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,981
for the computer
I'd been working on.

766
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:46,449
I wasn't positive who did it,

767
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:48,284
but I had a pretty good idea.

768
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:50,286
I was going to have
it out with the guy

769
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:54,323
when that skunk ran
in front of me.

770
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,542
What guy?

771
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:58,760
Josh, there's
nothing we can
do about that now.

772
00:49:58,763 --> 00:50:01,163
It's ancient history.

773
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,300
Sorry, dad.

774
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:05,768
Me, too, Max.

775
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,235
I'm sorry about a lot of things.

776
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:09,305
I'm sorry I wasn't here
for the two of you.

777
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:12,575
I'm sorry
I was such a lousy dad.

778
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:14,243
You weren't that bad.

779
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:15,378
Yes, I was, Max.

780
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,381
I never took the time
to be a dad.

781
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:21,484
I didn't realize how little
time I was going to have.

782
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:24,387
You bought me that
football helmet,
remember?

783
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:27,290
I still have it.

784
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:30,192
I didn't buy it, Max.
Your mom did...

785
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,228
Like everything else.

786
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,796
Well...

787
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,099
I'm still glad you
came back, dad.

788
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:40,169
Thanks, son.
I am, too.

789
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:48,411
So, I guess Al was
right, huh, Josh?

790
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,625
Who?

791
00:50:50,626 --> 00:50:52,838
Al Einstein.
Genius. Bushy hair.

792
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,051
He didn't think
it was such a good
idea to come back.

793
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:57,720
But I just wanted to help.

794
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:00,523
You can, dad!
Help us fix Newman.

795
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:01,357
What?

796
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:02,825
With you inside,

797
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,292
we might be able
to tell what's
wrong with him.

798
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:07,263
Now, that is a great idea, Max.

799
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:08,764
He's never going to work,

800
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,332
even with your help.

801
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:11,667
That's not true.

802
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:14,570
Hey, he's almost ready.

803
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:21,444
Well, I guess if it
would make Max happy.

804
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:23,112
Yes!

805
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:25,281
All right!

806
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:35,224
[Sighs]

807
00:51:36,394 --> 00:51:40,329
<i>You must be proud
to have built a robot.</i>

808
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:42,298
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

809
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,266
<i>I didn't do it all by myself.</i>

810
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,468
<i>Josh helped, too.</i>

811
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,237
<i>How long did it take
to build him?</i>

812
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:51,774
<i>About seven months.</i>

813
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,310
Wilkinson wants to run
it on the morning news
as a special.

814
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:56,345
Great.

815
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:59,548
<i>It's a secret.</i>

816
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:02,750
<i>But he's kind of</i>
<i>like a computer</i>
<i>on wheels.</i>

817
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:04,420
Great.

818
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:08,691
[Matthew]
Ok, what do you
want him to do first?

819
00:52:08,693 --> 00:52:11,694
Uh, get him to talk on his own.

820
00:52:11,696 --> 00:52:13,295
Good luck.

821
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:18,868
What if you cross
e-10 with s-17, bypassing
the double poles?

822
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:23,372
No, no. That won't
work. He'd stutter.

823
00:52:23,374 --> 00:52:25,925
Let's see...

824
00:52:25,926 --> 00:52:28,477
What if I reroute m-18
from the emitter leg

825
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,546
into the collector hole?

826
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:32,815
Now you're cooking.

827
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:38,687
[Matthew]
Finished?

828
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,223
I think so.

829
00:52:42,727 --> 00:52:45,528
Ok, I'm going to shut up now.

830
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:49,331
Any corny jokes you hear
will be Newman's.

831
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,735
How about if you
don't use the keypad?

832
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:55,271
Use his voice
recognition instead.

833
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:58,174
He's going to do it.

834
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:03,812
Newman...

835
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:06,849
Can you hear me?

836
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:11,654
<i>Yes.
I can hear you.</i>

837
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:15,224
<i>Yes.</i> I can<i> hear you.</i>

838
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:17,560
Yes.<i> I can he...</i>

839
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:19,328
<i>Thanks. I needed that.</i>

840
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:23,499
[Matthew]
Hmm. No bugs, no bytes.

841
00:53:24,302 --> 00:53:27,803
Ok... Check his
motor reflexes.

842
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:29,838
Let's see if he can, uh...

843
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,409
Pick up that glass of juice.

844
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:37,813
Newman...

845
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:40,348
Do you see the glass
on the table?

846
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:42,218
<i>Yes.</i>

847
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:46,288
I want you to reach for it.

848
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,890
<i>Ok.</i>

849
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:54,897
[Matthew]
Good...

850
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,335
Good.

851
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:01,337
Now pick it up.

852
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:04,273
Good.

853
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:06,875
Now bring it to me.

854
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:08,978
Not so good.

855
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,613
Maybe he's
left-handed.

856
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:12,932
<i>Sorry.</i>

857
00:54:12,933 --> 00:54:15,250
[Max]
Don't feel bad,
Newman. It's ok.

858
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:20,556
[Josh]
I give up.

859
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:24,660
[Matthew]
Come on. Don't
give up, Josh.

860
00:54:24,662 --> 00:54:25,828
Try it again.

861
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,030
He's not sophisticated enough.

862
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:31,200
Yes, he is.

863
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:34,369
I bet that last
adjustment you made
did the trick.

864
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:37,373
Come on...

865
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:40,375
Who among us got
an "a" on our first
science test, huh?

866
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:44,346
Newman...
Pick up the glass.

867
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:58,894
<i>Now what, Josh?</i>

868
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:01,697
[Matthew]
Psst. Over here.

869
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:06,035
Surprise.

870
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,704
Did you do that?

871
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,675
You talkin' to me?

872
00:55:12,677 --> 00:55:17,446
<i>Would you like a drink, Josh?</i>

873
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:25,587
You did it, Josh.

874
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:28,624
Thanks to you.

875
00:55:28,626 --> 00:55:30,059
No, thanks to you.

876
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:31,927
He's your invention.

877
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:35,097
I'm real proud of you, son.

878
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,810
Josh, I don't blame you
for being angry with me.

879
00:55:47,812 --> 00:55:52,114
I'm trying to make it up to you.

880
00:55:57,555 --> 00:55:59,388
I missed you so much.

881
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,957
Ahh... I'm here, Josh.

882
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:05,561
I'll always be with you.

883
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:12,067
More juice?

884
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,739
So, Max...

885
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:18,440
He did it.

886
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:20,042
Very funny.

887
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,010
<i>Josh is right.</i>

888
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:25,381
<i>I did it, Max.</i>

889
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:26,566
Oh, my God!

890
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:27,750
[Matthew]
Max, watch out
for the...

891
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:28,784
Whoa!

892
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:30,636
Box.

893
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,487
<i>[Anchor]</i>
<i>And now for a change</i>
<i>of pace, some good news.</i>

894
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,857
<i>Here's Alice woods
with a special report.</i>

895
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:38,660
<i>Every so often, you stumble
upon something magical.</i>

896
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:40,763
<i>I found it here on maple drive.</i>

897
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:44,433
<i>A little handmade robot
that walks, talks,</i>

898
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:46,468
<i>even does the rumba.</i>

899
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:49,638
<i>You dance divinely.</i>

900
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,175
<i>You're not so bad yourself.</i>

901
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:01,683
[Matthew]
Touchdown.

902
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:02,918
Take it easy.

903
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,688
Throw it to me now.

904
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:08,457
I got good hands,
considering they're aluminum.

905
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:10,426
[Matthew]
1...

906
00:57:10,428 --> 00:57:11,126
And 2...

907
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:12,995
And 3...

908
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:15,130
This is great.
I love it!

909
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,732
I'm going deep, dad.

910
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:20,102
Go for it.
Watch this, Max.

911
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:23,172
All set?
Here comes!

912
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,115
Uh-oh.

913
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,884
It's in here.

914
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:38,153
Excuse me.

915
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:49,765
Beth!

916
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:00,242
What is going on?

917
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:01,910
[Beth]
Newman was on TV.

918
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:02,945
Oh, my...

919
00:58:02,947 --> 00:58:04,913
How'd he get...

920
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,023
Where are you?

921
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:16,191
I'm going to kill you!

922
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:17,826
[Sarah]
Josh, what's going on?

923
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,161
[Max]
Don't, Josh, please!

924
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:20,696
She promised me she
wouldn't show it

925
00:58:20,698 --> 00:58:21,864
till we got a patent!

926
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:24,266
[Sarah]
Josh, stop it!

927
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:26,768
You ruined everything!

928
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:29,071
[Matthew]
Josh! Now, that's enough.

929
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:30,973
Calm down.

930
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:34,810
It wasn't Max' fault.

931
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:37,246
[Max]
I'm sorry, Josh.

932
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,014
We'll never
get a patent in time.

933
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:43,151
Somebody's going
to rip us off like
they did you.

934
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:44,153
No, they're not.

935
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:46,555
They know what Newman can do,

936
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:50,592
but they don't know
how he does it.

937
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:52,227
Matthew?

938
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:01,637
Why don't you guys take Beth

939
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:04,840
and go calm down the neighbors?

940
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:09,177
Go on. It's ok.

941
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,326
Hello, Sarah.

942
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:28,730
It is you.

943
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,333
Well, sort of.

944
00:59:31,702 --> 00:59:34,770
I kept thinking
that I felt you,
but...

945
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:39,808
I thought if I told
the boys they'd think
I was losing my mind.

946
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,577
Oh, Sarah.

947
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:56,325
Josh, is Newman your dad?

948
00:59:56,327 --> 00:59:57,993
Yeah.

949
00:59:57,995 --> 01:00:01,163
So the pipe smoke was...

950
01:00:01,165 --> 01:00:04,066
You brought him back here, Beth.

951
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:05,734
Yeah.
Thanks, Beth.

952
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:08,870
Wow!

953
01:00:10,908 --> 01:00:12,608
Wow.

954
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:18,080
Well, I guess
I should go home
or something.

955
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:23,251
Oh, wait, wait.

956
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:24,920
Beth... Um...
Don't...

957
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:29,791
Don't worry, I'm not
going to tell anyone
he's your dad.

958
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,361
Besides, who'd believe me?

959
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:37,065
See you at school, Josh.

960
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:38,200
Bye, Max.

961
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:40,836
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

962
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,740
[Honk honk]
Hey, guys!

963
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:47,776
I've got some
great news.
Sarah!

964
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:49,978
Steve.

965
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,380
Hi. Whoa.

966
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:55,317
What is that?
It's a robot.

967
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:58,787
Kids do that?

968
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:00,055
Incredible.

969
01:01:00,057 --> 01:01:01,740
When did you get back?

970
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,424
About 20 minutes
ago. I've got
wonderful news.

971
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:06,261
[Robot voice]
Not so fast, buddy.

972
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:09,231
I like that.
That's good.
Come here.

973
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:11,867
Did you notice
I bought a new
sweater?

974
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:14,202
Come on. Sit down.

975
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,306
The magazine loved my story.

976
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:21,043
They gave me a $25,000 advance

977
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:22,744
to turn it into a book!

978
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:23,912
Do you believe that?

979
01:01:23,914 --> 01:01:25,681
That's great.
Congratulations.

980
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:28,216
That's not all...

981
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:39,027
[Steve]
Go ahead,
open it.

982
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:43,465
No, Steve.

983
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,800
What do you mean,
no? Come here.

984
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:48,103
Put it on.

985
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,774
I can't.

986
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:54,409
I'm married.

987
01:01:57,948 --> 01:02:01,850
I was married...
I am, uh... um...

988
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:04,152
Sarah...

989
01:02:04,154 --> 01:02:06,388
You're not married.

990
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:15,931
Excuse me.

991
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:19,101
Are you all right?

992
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:22,204
What's going on around here?

993
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:25,273
It's very complicated.

994
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,274
I don't know that
I can explain it.

995
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:28,910
Try.

996
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,850
I can't.

997
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,353
I'm sorry.

998
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:45,427
I just need some time
to sort things out.

999
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,000
Fine.

1000
01:02:53,003 --> 01:02:55,270
I know what I said.

1001
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:59,508
I had no idea this
thing was so advanced.

1002
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:02,310
I want the plans.

1003
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:05,080
We'll build our
own outer chassis.

1004
01:03:05,082 --> 01:03:07,082
Yes. But I want
more money.

1005
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:11,553
You'll get what
I deem appropriate.

1006
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:16,057
You forget, Walter,
I still have
Matthew Carson's prototype

1007
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:19,928
with your fingerprints
all over it.

1008
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:24,499
[Doorbell rings]

1009
01:03:27,371 --> 01:03:29,037
Hello.

1010
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,307
I'm sorry I lied to you, Max.

1011
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:35,944
I'm never watching
your channel again.

1012
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,847
Please, just leave us alone.

1013
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:40,949
I'm sorry.

1014
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:43,985
Nice going, mom.

1015
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:46,321
Please, I want to help you.

1016
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:49,291
I've contacted
a robotics company.

1017
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:51,226
They're very interested.

1018
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:53,962
If you'd just let me help you.

1019
01:03:53,964 --> 01:03:56,531
[Matthew]
Maybe you should
talk to her.

1020
01:03:56,533 --> 01:03:57,866
Watch out, mom.

1021
01:03:57,868 --> 01:04:00,969
She, like, totally
mesmerizes you.

1022
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:03,171
She just wants another story.

1023
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,340
No. Mm-mmm.
I don't think so.

1024
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:07,542
Give her another chance.

1025
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:15,250
Mrs. Carson.

1026
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:17,102
Hello.

1027
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,953
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Henry kilbrandt,

1028
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:20,255
president of zindath robotics.

1029
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:22,390
And this is
Mr. Michael Abbot,

1030
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,326
his supervising engineer.

1031
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:27,963
The boys are right in here.

1032
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:36,404
Newman.

1033
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:43,979
My, my...

1034
01:04:43,981 --> 01:04:47,249
Gentlemen, my name is Henry.

1035
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:50,652
And this is Mike.

1036
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:53,321
We came all the way from Texas

1037
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:56,391
just to see this
little buddy of yours.

1038
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,293
<i>My name is Newman.</i>

1039
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:00,629
Delightful, isn't it, Mike?

1040
01:05:00,631 --> 01:05:02,431
Hmph.

1041
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:04,232
[Kilbrandt]
I hope it's ok
for Mike to examine him.

1042
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:09,104
We've had quite
a few people try to
sell us phony robots.

1043
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:11,139
[Josh]
Newman's no phony.

1044
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,608
We'll see.

1045
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:17,045
I'd like
a demonstration,
please.

1046
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:19,531
Ok.

1047
01:05:19,532 --> 01:05:22,016
Would you like a glass
of juice, Mr. kilbrandt?

1048
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:24,619
Well...
All right.

1049
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:27,289
[Josh] I'll have
Newman serve you.

1050
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:28,957
Just a moment.

1051
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:32,327
Have him pick
out this pen
instead.

1052
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:34,362
You can't expect a robot...

1053
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:36,314
Excuse me,
Mr. kilbrandt,

1054
01:05:36,315 --> 01:05:38,265
but this robot
should be able to
do almost anything.

1055
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:42,437
Maybe the only
thing it can pick up
is a glass.

1056
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,205
I suppose you're right.

1057
01:05:44,207 --> 01:05:46,374
Josh, can he do it?

1058
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:47,442
I don't think so.

1059
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:50,111
That's
a very intricate
manipulation.

1060
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:53,214
I see.
Well, that's too bad.

1061
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:56,584
This isn't going
to work. Let's go.

1062
01:05:56,586 --> 01:05:58,086
Try it. Go on.

1063
01:05:58,088 --> 01:05:59,487
I don't want you to do it.

1064
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:02,057
I won't.
I promise.

1065
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:03,059
Excuse me?

1066
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:07,028
Uh, he said we can do it.

1067
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:10,265
Go on, Josh.

1068
01:06:11,068 --> 01:06:13,635
Go on, honey.
Yeah.

1069
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:20,792
Newman...

1070
01:06:20,793 --> 01:06:22,409
I want you to
approach Mr. Abbot,

1071
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:24,245
the man on the right.

1072
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:26,481
<i>Yes, Josh.</i>

1073
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:33,288
<i>Ready for next command, Josh.</i>

1074
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:36,224
Now raise your arm
to Mr. Abbot's
pocket.

1075
01:06:36,226 --> 01:06:40,228
<i>Which pocket, Josh?</i>

1076
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,030
His inside pocket...

1077
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:44,499
With the pens inside.

1078
01:06:49,306 --> 01:06:51,172
Now extract the pen.

1079
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:54,342
<i>Yes, Josh.</i>

1080
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:21,102
It's amazing, isn't it, Mike?

1081
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:22,771
Uh... Just a minute.

1082
01:07:22,773 --> 01:07:24,723
I meant this pen,

1083
01:07:24,724 --> 01:07:26,674
and I'm going to put it
in my back pocket.

1084
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:29,277
Mike, please wait in the car.

1085
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:31,646
[Robot voice]
Oh, Mike.

1086
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:34,783
You forgot your pen.

1087
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:39,354
Oops.

1088
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:42,490
Ha ha ha ha.

1089
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:45,260
This was a new shirt.

1090
01:07:45,262 --> 01:07:47,179
Not anymore.

1091
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:49,097
He has a mind
of his own sometimes.

1092
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:53,518
I'm sorry.

1093
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:55,369
We're in business.
I'll draw up the papers,

1094
01:07:55,372 --> 01:08:00,375
and we'll
pick up the prototype
when they're signed.

1095
01:08:00,377 --> 01:08:01,643
Pick him up?

1096
01:08:01,645 --> 01:08:03,512
Oh, yes.

1097
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:05,380
Our designers have to analyze
and break him down

1098
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:07,248
and modify him.

1099
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,185
He's a wonderful handmade robot,

1100
01:08:10,187 --> 01:08:13,388
but people want
high-tech devices.

1101
01:08:19,563 --> 01:08:22,664
Then you can't
have him.
[Max]
Right.

1102
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:23,531
But, boys...

1103
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:24,866
You can have the design,

1104
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:26,601
but we keep the prototype.

1105
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,525
Right.

1106
01:08:28,526 --> 01:08:30,448
But, boys, that's impossible.

1107
01:08:30,449 --> 01:08:32,371
Mrs. Carson, could I have
a word with you, please?

1108
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:37,145
Uh...
It's not up to me.

1109
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:40,615
Well, if you boys
ever change your mind,

1110
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:41,816
give me a call.

1111
01:08:41,818 --> 01:08:45,320
I'll be in town until Monday.

1112
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,190
Ladies.

1113
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:50,191
Bye-bye.

1114
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:52,160
Thank you.

1115
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:55,730
I don't get it,

1116
01:08:55,732 --> 01:09:00,869
but he must mean
an awful lot
to you guys.

1117
01:09:00,871 --> 01:09:03,271
He does.

1118
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:05,773
Good night, mom.

1119
01:09:05,775 --> 01:09:07,208
Good night, Max.

1120
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:08,243
Good night, dad.

1121
01:09:08,245 --> 01:09:10,312
Good night, Max.

1122
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,380
Boy, it sure feels good
to say that again.

1123
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:13,882
Good night, Newman.

1124
01:09:13,884 --> 01:09:18,353
<i>Good night, everyone.</i>

1125
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:22,390
Josh, I'm really touched

1126
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:24,993
that you want to keep me,

1127
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,595
but I think you
should've made a deal.

1128
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:29,497
Good night, dad.

1129
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:38,206
Hmm... Good night, Josh.

1130
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:48,816
Coming?

1131
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,318
Huh?

1132
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:53,221
Oh, boy!

1133
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:54,923
<i>Curious.</i>

1134
01:09:54,925 --> 01:09:57,625
You can say that again.

1135
01:09:57,627 --> 01:10:00,328
<i>Curious.</i>

1136
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:02,363
Sarah?

1137
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,499
Sarah,

1138
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:06,201
I, uh...

1139
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:07,435
I...

1140
01:10:07,437 --> 01:10:08,653
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!

1141
01:10:08,654 --> 01:10:09,870
<i>Fascinating...
Bingo! Whoo!</i>

1142
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:11,439
Newman, take it easy.

1143
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:12,441
<i>Hot mama!</i>

1144
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:13,442
Newman, shut down.

1145
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:16,344
<i>Oh, yes, sir.</i>

1146
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:20,248
Sarah...
What are you doing?

1147
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,383
Nothing.

1148
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:23,385
[Sigh]

1149
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:24,652
Good night, honey.

1150
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:27,455
I'm sorry, Matt.

1151
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:31,993
I was just being silly.

1152
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:37,865
Do you think you could
stay in here with me
until I fall asleep?

1153
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:41,636
It's been such a long time.

1154
01:10:41,638 --> 01:10:43,471
Ok, sweetheart.

1155
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:17,839
Move it!

1156
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,346
What?

1157
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:27,849
Wake up.

1158
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,735
[Crash]

1159
01:11:30,736 --> 01:11:32,853
[Walter]
Would you keep it quiet?

1160
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,323
Twit!

1161
01:11:35,325 --> 01:11:37,492
Find the plans!

1162
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:58,630
Ouch!

1163
01:11:58,631 --> 01:12:00,915
Will you shut up
and keep it quiet?

1164
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:03,451
You idiot.

1165
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,987
Dad!

1166
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:07,689
Look!

1167
01:12:18,902 --> 01:12:21,002
All right!

1168
01:12:23,073 --> 01:12:24,772
[Walter]
Come on,

1169
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:27,041
he ain't that heavy.

1170
01:12:27,644 --> 01:12:30,812
<i>Danger!
Improper handling.</i>

1171
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:32,914
Dad, it talked!

1172
01:12:32,916 --> 01:12:35,383
<i>Return me at once.</i>

1173
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,851
<i>This is unauthorized
transportation.</i>

1174
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:38,970
See?

1175
01:12:38,971 --> 01:12:40,087
[Matthew]
If you return us now,

1176
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:43,358
I'll get them to go easy
on you, Walter.

1177
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,826
Who is that?

1178
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:46,027
Your worst nightmare.

1179
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,562
I knew you were the one

1180
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:49,764
who stole my computer
for jaeger.

1181
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:52,867
Well, I'll be doggone.

1182
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,403
That's the voice
of Mr. Carson.

1183
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:57,538
He's back from the grave!

1184
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,940
What's going on, dad?

1185
01:12:58,942 --> 01:13:00,608
Don't worry about it, boy.

1186
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:01,776
You just shut up.

1187
01:13:01,778 --> 01:13:03,111
Uh, look, I'd really...

1188
01:13:03,113 --> 01:13:05,880
I'd really like to stand around

1189
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,849
and chew the fat all day,

1190
01:13:07,851 --> 01:13:09,384
but as you can see,

1191
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:11,152
we're pretty busy back here,

1192
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:13,955
so if it's all the same to you,

1193
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:16,524
I'll just say
toodle-oo!

1194
01:13:16,526 --> 01:13:18,393
Oh, no, you won't!

1195
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:20,795
Ooh!

1196
01:13:20,797 --> 01:13:22,130
Don't mess with us!

1197
01:13:22,132 --> 01:13:23,398
Dad, are you ok?

1198
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,666
Let's get out of here, Newman.

1199
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:27,535
<i>Ok, boss.</i>

1200
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,403
Dad, I can't believe
he did that.

1201
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:31,556
Adios, amigos!

1202
01:13:31,557 --> 01:13:33,707
[Dwayne]
Dad, just tell
me what to do!

1203
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:36,444
Go get him, will you?

1204
01:13:36,446 --> 01:13:38,513
What are you doing?

1205
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:42,817
Where did he go?

1206
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:46,954
[Matthew] You and jaeger are
going to jail this time!

1207
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:49,056
You're not going to rip off

1208
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:52,493
my boys like you did me.

1209
01:13:52,495 --> 01:13:55,029
Matthew Carson?

1210
01:13:57,066 --> 01:13:59,033
What are you doing? Go!

1211
01:13:59,035 --> 01:14:00,101
Right.

1212
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:02,503
[Dwayne]
Where is that little runt?

1213
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:03,971
Get those scanners
working, Newman.

1214
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:07,875
We've got to find
a way out of here.

1215
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:09,160
Hmm...

1216
01:14:09,161 --> 01:14:10,444
It may be a good time

1217
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,480
for a little light housework.

1218
01:14:12,482 --> 01:14:14,782
Get out of my way!

1219
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,051
I'll just borrow this.

1220
01:14:24,594 --> 01:14:26,961
Yoo-hoo, cheeseball!

1221
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:28,463
Huh?

1222
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,899
Getting warmer.

1223
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:35,570
Gotcha! We have lift-off!

1224
01:14:35,572 --> 01:14:36,704
Have a ride.

1225
01:14:36,706 --> 01:14:39,173
Aah!

1226
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:42,977
Aah!

1227
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:44,011
Aah!

1228
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:45,179
I can't watch.

1229
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:47,482
Aah!

1230
01:14:57,227 --> 01:14:59,160
Aah!

1231
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:00,194
[Thunk]

1232
01:15:00,196 --> 01:15:01,996
Ohh...

1233
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,198
[Moaning]

1234
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,667
[Walter]
You ok, boy?

1235
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:11,105
Dad... Help me!

1236
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:13,006
Your invention works
on tennis balls.

1237
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:16,944
How about
a more practical
application?

1238
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:18,713
Got to run.

1239
01:15:18,715 --> 01:15:20,047
I'll just say toodle-oo.

1240
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:22,984
<i>I'll just say
toodle-oo, too.</i>

1241
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:24,785
Dad!

1242
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:29,891
D... aah!

1243
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:35,963
<i>Now what, boss?</i>

1244
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,900
Hmm...

1245
01:15:41,304 --> 01:15:43,237
What are you doing?

1246
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:46,073
This is no time to lay...

1247
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:47,875
Whoa!

1248
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:52,146
Ok, and...

1249
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:53,047
Got it!

1250
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,950
Elevator going up.

1251
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,135
Gentlemen, start your engines.

1252
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,706
Well, get it!

1253
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:19,674
Uh-oh.

1254
01:16:19,676 --> 01:16:21,175
Get it!

1255
01:16:21,177 --> 01:16:23,844
Watch this, Newman...

1256
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:24,779
Bombs away!

1257
01:16:24,781 --> 01:16:26,647
And they're off!

1258
01:16:28,151 --> 01:16:31,819
And it's a left hook
to the face.

1259
01:16:31,821 --> 01:16:32,653
Another left!

1260
01:16:32,655 --> 01:16:34,055
<i>Way to go, boss!</i>

1261
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:36,257
And... hey!
Wait a minute!

1262
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:37,592
Let go! Let go!

1263
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:39,160
This is my wheel! No!

1264
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:42,797
Only one driver at a time.

1265
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:46,233
Damn!

1266
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:48,002
[Sarah]
This is kidnapping.

1267
01:16:48,004 --> 01:16:50,237
You have got to find him!

1268
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:53,908
Him? You said
this was some
kind of machine.

1269
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:56,094
Well, it is.

1270
01:16:56,095 --> 01:16:58,279
But it's very important
that you find him.

1271
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:01,616
Any ideas on who
might have taken him?

1272
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:02,783
Are you all right?

1273
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:04,852
Half the state knows about him.

1274
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:06,020
It could've been anyone.

1275
01:17:06,022 --> 01:17:09,323
Ok, we'll, uh...
We'll look into it.

1276
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:11,292
Thank you.

1277
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:15,329
We're going to have
to find dad ourselves.

1278
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:17,732
Dad?

1279
01:17:17,734 --> 01:17:18,799

Stop playing games, Walter.

1307
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:26,127
I want the designs in
the patent office today.

1308
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:29,764
And get rid of this stuff.

Where are the police?

1310
01:19:46,516 --> 01:19:48,916

01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:52,512
¶ it can be so cruel ¶

1464
01:30:52,514 --> 01:30:55,182
¶ love can cross the lines ¶

1465
01:30:55,184 --> 01:30:58,952
¶ that people draw ¶

1466
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:04,891
¶ love breaks the rules ¶

1467
01:31:08,163 --> 01:31:12,599
¶ if we gave it one more try ¶

1468
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:17,237
¶ then we'll never wonder why ¶

1469
01:31:17,239 --> 01:31:19,172
¶ 'cause a love like ours ¶

1470
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:24,778
¶ should reach the stars
each time ¶

1471
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:27,147
¶ oh, but life gets in the way ¶

1472
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:29,649
¶ of the things you should say ¶

1473
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:34,087
¶ and the times seem
to drive us apart ¶

1474
01:31:34,089 --> 01:31:36,089
¶ but today's a new day ¶

1475
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:38,158
¶ if you'll let me stay ¶

1476
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:42,128
¶ then we're off
to a brand-new start ¶

1477
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:43,663
¶ they say ¶

1478
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:46,933
¶ love breaks the rules ¶

1479
01:31:46,935 --> 01:31:48,935
¶ it can lift you up ¶

1480
01:31:48,937 --> 01:31:52,172
¶ it can be so cruel ¶

1481
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:54,674
¶ love can cross the lines ¶

1482
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:57,210
¶ that people draw... ¶
