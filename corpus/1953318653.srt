1
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,284
Timmy! Bedtime! Lights off!

2
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,354
Aaah!
No problem, mom!

3
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,524
Goodnight, hon.

4
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,213
<i>He's gaining on us.</i>

5
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,648
<i>Yikes! What are
we gonna do?</i>

6
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,618
<i>Blind Wonder,
do you see that?</i>

7
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,225
<i>Yeah, we got to save him
from that creature.</i>

8
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:14,426
<i>I'll distract it
and you grab it.</i>

9
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,761
Timothy, did you hear me?

10
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,831
Timothy! Answer me!

11
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,801
The start of summer
vacation doesn't save
you from your chores.

12
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,337
Did you hear me?

13
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,673
I'll do it when this is over.
No! You'll do it now.

14
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,975
But, dad!
I don't want to hear it!

15
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,878
If you want allowance
to buy comic books and
play those Atari games,

16
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,347
Then you're gonna have to
work outside and around
the house, all right?

17
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,816
Randy, why don't you
lay off the boy?

18
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,918
Summer vacation just started.

19
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,955
Damn it, dad.
Don't question me.

20
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,890
We both agreed that
if you were going to
live here with us, that...

21
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:49,561
Pss, pss, pss, pss.
That show.
I'm trying to watch it.

22
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,632
Okay. Finish watching
your show, but make
sure it gets done.

23
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,307
Thanks, grandpa.

24
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,542
Oh, yeah,
no problem.

25
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,249
<i>Hey, mud butt!
Huh?</i>

26
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,284
<i>Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?</i>

27
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,790
Timmy, come over here
and sit with me.

28
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,369
<i>Yeah, Blind Wonder!
Yeah, Blind Wonder!</i>

29
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,337
Can I ask you
a question?

30
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,373
Sure.

31
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,476
What are you boys gonna
do with that underground
clubhouse you're building?

32
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,049
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna say anything.

33
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,318
How'd you know?

34
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,888
Well, I was taking a walk
around where you boys play,

35
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,357
Like my doctor says
I have to,

36
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,995
And I saw this
underground stovepipe.

37
00:04:56,997 --> 00:05:00,999
I started poking
around and found
a leather strap, I pulled it,

38
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,069
And low and behold, there was
an underground hideout.

39
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:07,072
Oh, man. We thought
nobody knew about it.

40
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:11,543
Nobody does. Just me.
I'm not gonna say anything.

41
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,915
Matter of fact, I left you
a present down there.

42
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,050
What is it?

43
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:21,987
No. It's a surprise,
but you'll find it.

44
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,723
Thanks, grandpa!
That's awesome.

45
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:52,818
Hey!

46
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,363
Why are you
so out of breath?

47
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,897
Look at my pants.

48
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,133
It was that stray dog again.

49
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:11,570
He almost got me,
but I lost him
back at the cemetery.

50
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,839
Wow, the dog did that?

51
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:18,076
Yeah, it started
chasing me. Got my leg,
but I kicked him off.

52
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,978
Is that the map?
Yeah.

53
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,747
Worked on it all night.
You gotta see it!

54
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,615
Well, take it out.

55
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,851
At the dugout.
Let's get Barry
and look at it there.

56
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,990
I'm supposed to
finish this. My dad's
already in a bad mood.

57
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:35,927
You go ahead.
I'll finish up here.
I need the exercise anyway.

58
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,629
Really?

59
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,931
Sure. Go on.

60
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:43,402
You boys have a good time.

61
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,570
Thanks, grandpa!
Race ya.

62
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,042
Good morning, boys.
Hi, Mrs. Smeltzer.

63
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,877
Who is it?
It's...

64
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,078
Rhonda, who is it?

65
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,852
What the hell
do you two want?

66
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,455
Banging on people's door this
early in the morning. What
the hell's wrong with you?

67
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,790
Sorry. We were just
looking for Barry.

68
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,026
Well, Barry is over
at the cemetery, working,

69
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,528
Which you two
should be doing.

70
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,030
You got jobs
for this summer?

71
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:46,765
We just wanted
to show Barry something.

72
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,066
Well, what is it?

73
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,935
It's a drawing.
I made it.

74
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,070
It's a drawing. I made it.

75
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:56,875
Drawing's for fags.
Are you a queer or somethin'?
No wonder your old man took off.

76
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,511
Clark! Don't say
such things to that boy!

77
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,146
Rhonda. Shut up and
get back in the kitchen!

78
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,981
Let's go.

79
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,115
And where the hell
do you think you're going?

80
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,552
What, are you deaf
and stupid, boy?

81
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,555
If we're so stupid,

82
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,691
Then how come Barry's out
doing your job,

83
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:16,261
While you're still sleeping
off last night's bottle?

84
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,763
What the hell
did you just say to me, boy?

85
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,199
You heard me. Go ahead.
Touch me.

86
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,236
You lay one hand on me and
everyone will know about you.

87
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:27,539
Go ahead. Tell everybody.
'cause there ain't nothing
to tell, you little bastard.

88
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,508
Come on, Timmy.

89
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,979
And I don't want to see
the two of you playing

90
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,213
In the cemetery any more,
you hear me?

91
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,954
Why do you have to
talk to them that way?

92
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,723
There's no need
to talk to them that way.

93
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:45,924
Did you just question me?

94
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,728
Sorry for what he said
about your old man.

95
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,799
I don't care about that.
I know my dad loves me.

96
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,536
When he comes
back from California,
everyone will see.

97
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:05,577
It grabbed my pant leg
with its jaws and
it was about to rip my pants,

98
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,914
But thank God I kicked it off
'cause it almost made this
rope here snap in half.

99
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,085
Nice one! That looked
like a triple header.

100
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,922
I'm telling you.
It doesn't matter
how strong you are.

101
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,189
It's all in the wrist.

102
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,926
Hey, there, Timmy.

103
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,094
Hey. You guys
catch anything yet?

104
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,630
Nothing but weeds
and a spare tire.

105
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,767
Hold this. Let me
show you guys something.

106
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,807
Whoa! That was cool!

107
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,777
What can I say.
I'm a natural.
It's all in the wrist.

108
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,880
See? I told you.
It's all in the wrist.

109
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,214
I know,
but we gotta go.

110
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,816
Okay.

111
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,918
See you guys later. I hope
you catch something big.

112
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,987
I already have.

113
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,858
She's beautiful.
Totally.

114
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,195
Who knows? Maybe we'll
add a new member to
the dugout this summer.

115
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,799
What?

116
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,934
I don't know.

117
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,203
What is it?

118
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,139
Not sure.
Never mind. Let's go.

119
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,825
Hey, guys.
How did you know I was here?

120
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,893
Your dad told us.
Oh.

121
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,396
Yeah. He was
pretty angry.

122
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,199
He sleeps in.
Been workin'
a lot of nights, lately.

123
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,234
So what happened?

124
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,370
My dad thinks it was
Ronny's gang that did it.

125
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,171
You know,
busting up the dead heads.

126
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,375
Trying to start up
rumors about the old mine
and the ghoul.

127
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,310
Was your dad
drinking last night?

128
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,345
I guess so. I don't know.

129
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,814
Why does
he drink so much?

130
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,417
My mom says
he's been that way
ever since the accident.

131
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,419
Is that watch new?

132
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,788
Yeah. My old man
gave it to me
for my birthday.

133
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,657
About the only thing
he's ever given me.

134
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,792
That, and a few
fresh ones.

135
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,327
He was acting
kind of weird though.

136
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,362
Said we shouldn't be playing
around here no more.

137
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:08,266
Sounds like him. This morning,
before he went to bed,
he called reverend Moore.

138
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,736
Got permission to get
some signs made up.
No trespassing.

139
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,139
But, it's daytime.

140
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:18,209
The way it sounded,
he didn't even
want me here, except to work.

141
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:21,346
No bike riding. No exploring.
No nothing.

142
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:25,016
Where else are we supposed
to hang out? The playground?

143
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,820
Plus, we got
the dugout right here.
We can't just abandon it.

144
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,056
If we're in the dugout,
no one can see us anyway.

145
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,058
My dad'll never
even know we're here.

146
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,693
Then it's settled?
Yep.

147
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,294
We stay.

148
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,436
What's this?
It has your name on it.

149
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,272
Oh, wow! I almost forgot.

150
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:24,843
My grandpa.
He told me earlier that he
left me a surprise.

151
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,277
In here?

152
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,414
Yeah. He found this place
on one of his walks.

153
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,950
Don't worry, though.
He's cool with everything.

154
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,351
Even the magazines!

155
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,120
Nice.

156
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,955
You're not
gonna open it?

157
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:39,290
Nah, maybe later.
Let's check out
the map, first.

158
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,039
Wow!
You guys like it?

159
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,441
It looks great.

160
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,776
It's amazing.

161
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,811
You even added
Ronny's forts.

162
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,846
The one's that
we know about, at least.

163
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,115
Hey. We can use this to
plan escape routes and stuff,

164
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,250
Before we raid them.

165
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,317
Timmy!

166
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,552
You guys hear that?
What?

167
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,287
Timmy!

168
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,258
Timmy? Where are you, Timmy?

169
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,194
Oh, man.
That's my mom.

170
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,529
What do you
think she wants?

171
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,465
Where are you?
Honey, where are you?

172
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,936
Timmy, where are you?

173
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,141
I'm here, mom.

174
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,212
Timmy, where have
you been?

175
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,881
We've been looking
all over for you!

176
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,284
I was just...
Wait, what happened?

177
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,355
It's your grandpa.

178
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,358
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,398
I'm sorry, baby.

180
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,509
<i>I lift up my eyes
to the mountains.</i>

181
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,447
<i>Where does my help
come from?</i>

182
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,288
<i>My help comes from the lord,
maker of heaven and earth.</i>

183
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,426
<i>He will not let
your foot slip,</i>

184
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,929
<i>He who watches over you
will not slumber.</i>

185
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:01,332
<i>Indeed he who watches
over Israel will neither
slumber nor sleep.</i>

186
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,102
The Lord watches over you,

187
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,939
The Lord is your shade
at your right hand.

188
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:10,508
The sun
will not harm you by day,
nor the moon by night.

189
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,013
The Lord will
keep you from all harm.

190
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,614
He will watch over your life.

191
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,352
The Lord will watch
over your coming and going

192
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,122
Both now and forever more.

193
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,391
I hear what
you're saying, Steve, but it
doesn't make any sense.

194
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:29,327
Look at this place.
Where would it be?

195
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,230
I know what I saw, Ronny.
I'm telling you.
It's gotta be here.

196
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:35,333
Even if that's true,
this place is big.

197
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,036
Yeah, their hideout
could be anywhere.

198
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,138
Well, what do
you wanna do?

199
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,040
It's what
you're gonna do.

200
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,342
Keep an eye out
for those little punks.

201
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,444
Don't let them
get away again. You get me?

202
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,414
I got you.

203
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,461
No screwing around now.
Let's get this done quick.

204
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,463
Your mother's got
supper waiting on us.

205
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,398
Yes, sir.

206
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,275
What is it?

207
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,444
Never mind.
Just get back to work.

208
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,047
I said
get back to work, boy!

209
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,543
Timmy!

210
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,746
Okay, mom!

211
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,414
What's wrong?

212
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,783
This place gives me
the creeps.

213
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,785
You're not a coward,
are you?

214
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,053
No, I just...

215
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,489
I don't see why we can't
do it back at my place.

216
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,294
'cause we do it
at your place
all the time.

217
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:47,098
I want something a little
bit more adventurous.

218
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,437
What would your father do
if he caught us here?

219
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,442
He'd be writing
both our eulogies.

220
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,310
But, you have nothing
to worry about.

221
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,714
Look, do you
love me or not?

222
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,153
You know I do.

223
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,289
Well, then
shut up and show me.

224
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,732
What's wrong?
Someone's watching us.

225
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,101
Where?

226
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,236
Out there.

227
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,139
Oh!

228
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,645
Oh, you think
that's funny, huh?

229
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,414
Yeah.

230
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,550
What if
that was your father?
I'd be a dead man.

231
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,553
Uh, yeah.
He wouldn't kill you.
Maybe castration.

232
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,723
Oh. Sure. That's fine, then.

233
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,607
Hey, there, sweetie.
How you doing?

234
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,510
Okay, I guess.

235
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,485
You know, your grandpa
loved you so much,

236
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,621
And he would want
you to know that

237
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:51,856
He's in
a better place now.

238
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,696
We should be grateful

239
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,498
That we had him
for as long as we did.

240
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,282
You know,
I spoke to your father,

241
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:21,786
And he said that
you can do whatever
you want to tomorrow.

242
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,822
No chores, okay?

243
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:27,992
Okay?

244
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,860
Okay.

245
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,876
Turn out the light
when you're finished,
all right?

246
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,000
Help me! Help me!

247
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,636
Come on! Help me!

248
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,507
Help me! Help me!

249
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,445
Calm down.
My old man will hear you.

250
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:02,947
Get me
out of here!

251
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:05,116
How much did
you eat for breakfast?

252
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:07,151
It's not funny, guys.
Do something!

253
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,987
This isn't
a joke, guys!

254
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,456
Take my hand.

255
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,792
I can't!
I'm holding myself up!

256
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,027
On the count of three.

257
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,397
Okay.

258
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,766
One, two, three.

259
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,872
Are you okay?

260
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:29,774
No, I'm not okay.

261
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,778
Look at my foot!
Does it look okay?

262
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,147
I'm bleeding!

263
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:38,749
You just walked
into a hole, that's all.
Didn't you see it?

264
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,986
There wasn't a hole.
The ground just caved in.

265
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,020
Like it was
a trap or something.

266
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:52,696
Ugh! It smells down there.

267
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:56,634
I can feel a breeze, too.
It's weird.

268
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:57,868
Check it out, Barry.

269
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:07,445
You think maybe
a groundhog did this?

270
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:10,881
It wasn't
a groundhog, doofus.
It's just another sinkhole.

271
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,883
They're all over
the cemetery.

272
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:14,919
My dad says the ground
is weaker at certain points

273
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,726
It doesn't
smell like a tunnel.
Smells like a sewer.

274
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:26,564
We're in a cemetery, guys.
It's probably just someone's
body, rotting away and stuff.

275
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,065
What about my foot?

276
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,667
My dad keeps a kit
in the tractor. I'll get it.

277
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,144
Guys! Look out!

278
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,754
Take that, stupid dog!
Dumb son of a bitch!

279
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,122
Barry! Stop!

280
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,498
What's your problem?
We're safe, now. It's over.

281
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,735
What's gotten
into you, man?

282
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:05,936
I don't know.

283
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,243
Ah! Oh!

284
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,982
What's wrong?
My watch.

285
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:21,252
Did you break it?
No. I lost it.

286
00:25:21,254 --> 00:25:24,288
This sucks! My old man
will have a cow if he
finds out I lost that watch.

287
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:26,924
Where do
you think it is?

288
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,968
Looks like my
old man's done for the day.
Come on, let's go.

289
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,604
Let's get this over with.
My foot's hurting.

290
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,143
Ow!

291
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,721
Does anyone see it?

292
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,789
Oh!

293
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,558
What's wrong?

294
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,092
The floor.
It moved!

295
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,127
Say what?

296
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,240
Here, help me out
with this.

297
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,313
Watch out
for snakes.

298
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:25,215
Whew. Which one
of you farted?

299
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:27,351
I thought maybe
a possum crawled up
your butt and died.

300
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:28,852
Eat my shorts!

301
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:30,020
Smells gross.

302
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,892
It's probably a rat
or a groundhog or something.

303
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,263
What the heck?
Did your dad do this?

304
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:42,132
No way. He'd be pissed
as hell if he saw this.

305
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:46,870
It stinks. That's where
the smell is coming
from, all right?

306
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:49,173
Just like that
other hole I fell into.

307
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,375
Hey! Maybe it leads
to the mines.

308
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:53,243
With a whole
series of tunnels!

309
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:54,878
It could be.

310
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,314
It's gotta be.
No animal would've dug this,

311
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,817
And like you said,
your dad wouldn't
have either.

312
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,286
We've got to explore it.

313
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,989
Make it ours before
anyone else finds it.

314
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:08,158
We can't do anything now.
It's almost dinner time.

315
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,828
And we still haven't
found my watch.

316
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,098
Why don't
we come back tonight when
our parents are asleep?

317
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,034
It's gonna rain tonight.
Heavy thunderstorms
until morning.

318
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,902
Then we come back
tomorrow night.

319
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,906
It sounds like a plan.

320
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,209
Let's get this hole
covered up.

321
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,169
I'm glad to see you
like the food so much, Doug.

322
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,705
Would you
like some more?

323
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:58,442
Oh, yes, Mrs. Graco.
This is delicious.
Thank you, again.

324
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,411
Well, I could write
the recipe down for your mom
if you'd like.

325
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,983
How is she
doing, anyway?

326
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:07,217
She's okay.

327
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:12,156
Dad? Somebody wrote
"Beware The Ghoul"

328
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:15,392
On one of the stones
at the cemetery.

329
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:18,262
Barry said it had
something to do with
the old mines. That true?

330
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:25,436
Well, the ghoul's
been around forever.

331
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:28,205
Kind of like Bigfoot or
the Loch Ness Monster.

332
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,274
Loch Ness Monster?

333
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:33,977
Yeah. It's kind of
like Godzilla, but it
lives underwater.

334
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,880
Anytime anybody skips town,
or somebody's dog
goes missing,

335
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,315
They blame it on the ghoul.

336
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:42,019
Parents use it as a way
to keep their kids in line.

337
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:45,355
But the story with the mines,
what does it have
to do with the ghoul?

338
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,731
Some of the survivors said
they saw something down there,

339
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:54,965
Right before the accident.

340
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,301
Just a bunch
of rumors, though.

341
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,974
Barry's daddy used to work
in the mines. Do you think
he saw the ghoul?

342
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:07,344
Barry's dad?
No, son.

343
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,913
The only ghoul that
man sees is in that bottle
he drinks every night.

344
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,387
Now, finish up.

345
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,233
It's gonna rain like crazy.

346
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:30,234
The weatherman
called for it.

347
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,871
Maybe we should
do this another night.

348
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:36,073
You getting scared,
little baby?

349
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,975
We finally get a chance
to get even with those clowns

350
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,843
And you want to call it off
because of rain?

351
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,411
Give me a break.

352
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:44,148
Look, you wouldn't
even know about this
if it wasn't for me!

353
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,084
Yeah. Quit
your complaining.

354
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,857
Smeltzer's old man
is really letting this place
fall apart.

355
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,826
The stones are
practically falling over.

356
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:58,462
Barry's dad's a drunk.
Everybody knows it.

357
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,564
He's a loser,
just like his son.

358
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,273
Yeah, it's right
up here.

359
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:12,843
Wait till you see
the size of this hole, man.
It is huge!

360
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,145
Must have taken them
forever to dig it.

361
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,815
Doug's titties must have
been jiggling like
a bowl full of jell-o.

362
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,440
Help!

363
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:49,012
Help!

364
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,348
Help! Somebody help me!

365
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,118
Help!

366
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,854
Did you guys
hear that?
What?

367
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,055
Listen.

368
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,460
Don't be a spaz.
It was just the wind.

369
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:06,129
No, no, no. It sounded
like it came from
underground or something.

370
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,364
Lay off the drugs,
Stevie boy.

371
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,873
You first.
You found it.

372
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,548
All right. Hold this.

373
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:45,102
It sounds like they're still
cleaning up in the kitchen.
We better hurry.

374
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,005
Hey! I think I found it.

375
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,110
Why does your dad
have all this stuff?

376
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:55,545
He lost a lot of
friends in that accident.

377
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,547
I guess it's his way
of keeping their
memories alive.

378
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,585
What's that?
I'm not sure.

379
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,389
A friend of
Barry's father.

380
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:08,325
It looks like
he lost his wife and twins
in some accident.

381
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:10,060
Then he died in the mines
with the others.

382
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,267
Go! Go! Go!

383
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:24,074
What about the ghoul?
What's it say?

384
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:27,544
Not much. Just that
some noises were heard
before the collapse.

385
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:34,351
One man saw something.
An animal walking
on two feet, he said.

386
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,294
An animal walking
on two feet?

387
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:18,462
What do you
think it was?

388
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:20,530
I don't know.

389
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,499
You boys want
ice cream for dessert?

390
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,334
Sure thing, mom!

391
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,535
Let's get out of here.

392
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,107
All right, it's under here.
Here, help me move this thing.

393
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,322
Look, there's a rope.

394
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:46,623
See? I told you.

395
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,291
Nice job, Steve.

396
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,595
How far
does it go?

397
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:52,696
I don't know.

398
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,731
Well, figure it out, stupid.

399
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,067
We can't be here all night.
The storm's coming.

400
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,211
See anything?

401
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,780
You're the one
with the light. Here.
Toss it down to me.

402
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,802
Ah, it stinks
down here.

403
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,570
We're in a cemetery,
you dweeb.

404
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,338
Maybe it's those guys.

405
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,740
Maybe they're
pissing down here.

406
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,141
Crapping, too, so they
don't gotta run home.

407
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,850
All right.
Let's find this place.

408
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:49,653
I'll take this tunnel.
You go into that one.

409
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,426
No, there's no way
I'm going down
there by myself.

410
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,196
You are such
a little bitch.
What about me?

411
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,867
You stay here and watch
out for old man Smeltzer.

412
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,135
Why does she get
the flashlight?

413
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:07,404
She's more of a man
than you are.

414
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:08,672
Now, let's go.
We gotta hurry.

415
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:21,318
Could you imagine exploring
that tunnel tonight
in this rain?

416
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,222
The thing's
probably flooded. We might
need a boat tomorrow.

417
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:29,392
Yeah, I guess so.
I suppose we'll find out
tomorrow night.

418
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,295
Thanks again
for letting me stay here.

419
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,297
It would have been
a long walk home
in this rain.

420
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,566
No problem.
Mom said I'm even allowed

421
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,335
To have you and Barry over
at the same time

422
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:40,303
When my birthday
rolls around.

423
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,206
That should be fun.
Back when I lived
in New York,

424
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,709
I was never allowed
to have any of
my friends over.

425
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,748
At least your mom cares.

426
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,318
Sometimes I wish my mom
would ask me where I was
going, what I was doing.

427
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:04,161
She cares, man.
She just has a funny way
of showing it.

428
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,734
Seriously, you know
she loves you, right?

429
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,671
That's just it.
She loves me too much.

430
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,875
Hey!

431
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:22,445
Doug, what is it?
You can tell me.

432
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:28,952
Promise you won't
tell anyone.
Not anyone. Not a soul.

433
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:30,353
I promise.

434
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,421
She...

435
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,225
Oh...

436
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:38,461
She comes to me at night.
In my room.

437
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:41,331
When I'm sleeping.
She touches me.

438
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,733
She made me
promise not to tell.

439
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:47,204
Says it's our secret,
says that if I
tell somebody,

440
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,739
My dad might
never come back.

441
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,608
How long has
this been going on?

442
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,512
It started
after my dad left.

443
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:58,715
She lost her nursing job
and started drinking.

444
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:02,852
She just sits there,
in front of the tv,
crying for hours.

445
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:09,526
<i>So now I lock
my door at night.</i>

446
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:14,731
Being here tonight,
with your mom and dad.
Eating dinner,

447
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:20,237
And playing games
and watching movies,
it felt so nice.

448
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:26,343
So normal.
That's what a real family
must feel like, you know?

449
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:29,479
I wish I had that.
You don't know how lucky
you've got it, man.

450
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:35,252
I know. Believe me, I know.

451
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,387
I don't want to
go home tomorrow.

452
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:40,290
I wish I could
just stay here.

453
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:44,794
Look, when we get up
in the morning, let's talk
to my parents about it.

454
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,663
Maybe we can...
No!

455
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:48,465
You promised.

456
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,967
You can't tell anybody.
Not even Barry.

457
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,743
It'll be okay, Doug.
You'll see.
It'll all be okay.

458
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:18,862
All right,
what are we looking for?

459
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:21,531
Their stash, you airhead.

460
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:25,468
Comics. Porn mags.
Stuff like that.

461
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,539
This place is huge.
It must have taken
them forever to dig it.

462
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:33,610
Shut up! Point the light
over there. There's something
up ahead.

463
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:35,545
What the hell is that?

464
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,470
There's water.
Son of a bitch, dude!

465
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,476
You gotta be kidding me!

466
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,611
We found it.
It's gotta be behind here.

467
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:09,713
Ah!

468
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:12,082
You idiot. I can't see.

469
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:13,817
Let me find my lighter.
This is crazy.

470
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:41,778
There's something down here!
Good night, Sammie.

471
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,380
Help me! Please!

472
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:44,748
You shouldn't play
where you are not invited.

473
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,798
Who is it?

474
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,620
Stop!
Hey!

475
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:24,754
Hey!

476
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:30,693
You all right?
What happened?

477
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:34,130
Nothing. I'm fine.
Just move over.

478
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,146
<i> Don't you have
work today, dad?</i>

479
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,147
We need to talk.

480
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,651
What's going on?

481
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:57,954
I know you've had
some trouble in the past
with Ronny Nace,

482
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,623
Samantha Glatfelter,
and Steve Laughman.

483
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,625
I know
they're not exactly
friends of yours, but...

484
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,726
Are they in jail
or something?

485
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,662
No. They're missing.

486
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:10,700
Missing?
Like they ran away?

487
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,670
We think it's best
if you stick close to home
for the next few days.

488
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:14,771
Dad...

489
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:15,839
Don't argue with me, Timmy.

490
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,585
Sounds like voices.

491
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,020
They are not voices,
they are echoes.

492
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,524
We're never getting
out of here.

493
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,641
Go ahead. Knock.

494
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:54,611
You knock. It's your turn.
I knocked last time.

495
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,281
He's with his friends.
A place.

496
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:01,017
I don't know is
not a place. Where is he?

497
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,753
He's playing with
his friends. He's a kid.

498
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:06,556
He's in the cemetery.
The one place
I said not to go. Isn't he?

499
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:09,826
Listen, don't sit down
on me, girl.
He's in the cemetery.

500
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:13,229
"not to go to the cemetery."
where's the one place
I let him...

501
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,634
I'm sorry.

502
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:21,538
When I say watch my boy,
I mean watch my boy, don't I?

503
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,805
Yes.
Yeah.

504
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,040
And what happens
when you don't?

505
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,977
Why don't they do something
about that?

506
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:31,014
Barry could tell the cops.
They'd lock his old man up.

507
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:34,751
Maybe he's afraid to.
I could understand that.

508
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:37,320
You could call too, you know.
About your mom.

509
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:40,023
My mom's not
anything like him.

510
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:43,092
Just because she's not
beating you, doesn't mean
she's not hurting you.

511
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:45,895
I don't
want to talk about it, okay?
Let's just find Barry.

512
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:47,931
If that's what you want.

513
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:57,740
Barry! Get out here!

514
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,316
I don't have all day
for this crap. Here...

515
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:08,117
Next time that groundhog
pops his head up,

516
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,085
I want you to blast
the hell out of him.

517
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,356
I'm gonna find out
why the police are still
hanging around here.

518
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:37,347
What's that?
What?

519
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:40,817
There. On the other
side of the bushes. See it?

520
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,927
Is this Pat Kemp's car?

521
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:52,028
I think it is.

522
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:01,971
Oh, God. Oh!

523
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,314
Macy McCoy on the scene
of a gruesome discovery

524
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:14,350
That investigators found
this morning of a young male.

525
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:16,786
We will keep you updated
with any further information.

526
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:19,055
You're trying to tell me
you have no idea
whose car that is?

527
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:21,057
Jesus christ, how many times
do I have to say it?
I know it's church property.

528
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,396
I'll be contacting you
and your parents
for further questioning.

529
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:27,897
Okay, guys?
Yes, sir.

530
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:29,132
All right. Thank you.

531
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,769
Are you okay?

532
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:35,304
I don't feel so good.

533
00:44:35,306 --> 00:44:40,143
I just wish my dad was here.
Maybe I should go home.

534
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:43,713
If you need me,
or if anything starts
to happen, call our house.

535
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:44,914
I'll come over.

536
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:50,687
Screw my curfew.
This is more important.
I'll sneak out.

537
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:53,356
Thanks, man. I gotta
lie down or something.

538
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,758
Remember, if you
need me, I'll be there.

539
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,040
Hey.
Hey.

540
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:16,412
I'm... I'm sorry about...
Well, you know.

541
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:21,384
They said there's no sign
of my sister. Something bad
has happened. I know it.

542
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:23,086
She's not coming back.

543
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:24,287
Don't say that.

544
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:26,089
She could still be okay.

545
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:27,890
Maybe. I don't know...

546
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:33,496
Never seen one
like this before.

547
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,366
What do you think it means?

548
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,902
I don't know.

549
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,238
It looks religious.

550
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,244
I-N-I-R-I...
That's what's on the pulpit
at the front of the church.

551
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,279
Do you know what it means?

552
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:51,347
No.

553
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,752
That there is
an old powwow charm.

554
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,755
Oh, hey there, reverend.

555
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:02,191
Hello, Timmy.
You doing okay?

556
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:03,760
Yes, sir.
Good.

557
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:05,294
I was going to ask
you the same thing.

558
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,532
Well, don't worry about me.

559
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,804
You know,
back when our ancestors

560
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:17,940
Used to believe in magic,
they sometimes placed

561
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:21,310
Powwow charms like this one
in a cemetery for protection

562
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:25,314
Against evil spirits
and other creatures.

563
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:29,452
Creatures? Like the ghoul?

564
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:32,054
Well, I don't know
about the ghoul.

565
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:34,957
But there's a legend.
There's an old legend that

566
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:39,962
This church was once
bedeviled by a demon.
A demon made flesh.

567
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,999
And when the beast
was defeated,

568
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:45,968
It was buried in a chamber
somewhere in the cemetery.

569
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,071
Could be this tombstone
was erected and those

570
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:53,376
Symbols carved on it to
keep the demon trapped.

571
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:56,846
Sounds like the ghoul,
the one everyone talks about.

572
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:02,852
Well, we better get going.

573
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:06,589
I don't want to worry
your mother any more
than we need to.

574
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:10,326
Please say hello to
your parents for me, Timmy.
Sure thing, reverend.

575
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,861
See you on Sunday.
You bet.

576
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,369
Come in.

577
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,343
What you doing, kiddo?

578
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:03,880
Just listening to some music.
Pat Kemp gave it to me.

579
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,350
He always was nice to us.

580
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:09,886
I see.

581
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,055
Do you wanna talk
about what happened today?

582
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:15,591
I think I'm okay, mom.

583
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,195
I heard it was pretty bad.
Did you see much?

584
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:21,330
Not really.

585
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:25,668
Well, it must have been
very upsetting for you.

586
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,372
I'm sorry you had to
go through all that.

587
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:34,477
Mom, if it's okay,
can we not talk about it?

588
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,445
All right.

589
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,618
But promise me,
if you need to,
you'll come talk to me, okay?

590
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:44,420
Promise.

591
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:48,291
All right.

592
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:17,286
Doug? You home?

593
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:22,525
Yeah, mom. It's me.

594
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,997
Were you gone last night?

595
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,232
Yeah.

596
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,203
Have you watched the news?

597
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:40,343
No. Why? Are you on it?

598
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:45,614
Maybe. I'm not sure, really.
Some bad stuff happened.

599
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:51,988
What'd you do?

600
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,992
Nothing.

601
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:58,728
Me and Timmy found
Pat Kemp's body in the woods,

602
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,529
So the police
might need to talk to me.

603
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,632
Are the police coming here?

604
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:05,568
I don't know.

605
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,472
I don't want you
talking to policemen.

606
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:14,577
They might make you say
things you don't mean.

607
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,115
You understand?

608
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,616
Yes, ma'am.

609
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:56,218
Awesome.

610
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:09,665
What the hell?

611
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,349
Okay, this guy's a creep.

612
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,462
What the hell?

613
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,732
Oh, man. I wonder how
much trouble Barry got into?

614
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:18,467
I don't want to
think about it.

615
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,736
Yeah, even my mom
calls him a "nasty drunk."

616
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,640
Is that nasty enough for you?

617
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:29,845
Let go. You're hurting me.

618
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:31,413
You're damn right I am, boy.

619
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,683
I thought I told
the two of you I...
Dad...

620
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,388
Keep your mouth shut, boy.

621
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:42,291
You were probably out
here breaking in with them,
weren't you?

622
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:44,460
What'd I tell you about
coming out here without me?

623
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:45,761
You can just
stay on your knees.

624
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,763
What?
You heard me.

625
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:49,498
Stay on your knees!

626
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,667
Why don't you just leave
him alone, you bastard?

627
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:54,670
What'd you just
say to me, boy?

628
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:55,905
You heard me, you drunk.

629
00:52:55,907 --> 00:52:58,908
You're good at hitting
women and little kids.

630
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:01,177
Why can't you beat on
somebody your own size?

631
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:04,547
You know, I've
warned you before, Graco.

632
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:06,916
Somebody needs to do
something about that
smart mouth of yours.

633
00:53:06,918 --> 00:53:08,384
Go ahead. Hit me.

634
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:09,785
Timmy. Shut up.

635
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,488
Dad! Put him down!

636
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,924
Please. Mr. Smeltzer.

637
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:17,326
Now you listen.
And you listen good.

638
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,565
If I ever see you
or your tubby little friend

639
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:24,500
Here playing
in this cemetery again,

640
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:26,502
I'm gonna tan your hides
so bloody,

641
00:53:26,504 --> 00:53:28,771
Even your mothers
are not gonna recognize you.

642
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,543
I don't want you playing
with these two boys anymore.

643
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:35,978
But, dad!
They're my best friends!

644
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,448
Back talk me again, boy!

645
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,785
Now you wipe
your little noses,

646
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:45,287
And you fix
your little dresses,

647
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:48,257
And you go running
home to your mommies.

648
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:52,962
And don't ever let me catch
you playing out here again.
Now get the hell out of here.

649
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,432
I said go!

650
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:11,614
We should do the same thing to
him as we did to that dog.

651
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,916
Yeah. And look what
happened when we did.

652
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:15,951
That wasn't really our fault.
That was Barry.

653
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:20,990
I read something in one of
my comic books. It said

654
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:24,660
That, "when you look
into the abyss, the abyss
also looks into you."

655
00:54:24,662 --> 00:54:29,465
My grandpa told me
that it means, when you
fight with monsters,

656
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:31,900
You have to be careful not to
turn into a monster yourself.

657
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,640
Well, what do we do now?

658
00:54:37,642 --> 00:54:41,010
Let's walk over
to the woods. Maybe
we can find something cool.

659
00:54:41,012 --> 00:54:43,479
But your parents said
we're not supposed to.

660
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:46,782
We'll be fine.
It's daytime anyways.
They'll never find out.

661
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:52,688
Barry, honey?

662
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,658
It's okay to come out.

663
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:57,926
He's gone.

664
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,867
Please, baby,
let me look at you.
Let me take care of you.

665
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:07,770
Please?

666
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:10,639
Oh, God...

667
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,944
I'm so sorry about this.

668
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:18,480
I tried to stop him,
but you know how he gets.

669
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,390
I don't know what's
going on with him right now.

670
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:36,732
But, a few years ago,

671
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,469
Back when your daddy
still worked in the mines,

672
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,573
A friend of his
came to ask a favor.

673
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,011
Clark had just
been promoted.

674
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:53,716
<i>He was in charge
of at least a dozen works
down there now.</i>

675
00:55:53,718 --> 00:55:58,754
<i>And this friend wantd
your father to give m
the day off.</i>

676
00:55:58,756 --> 00:56:01,857
<i>Said something was wrong
with his wife and he need
to be home with her.</i>

677
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:07,930
But there was a bonus

678
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:11,033
For your father
if he finished the job early.

679
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:16,638
So Clark told
the man it was nothing

680
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,541
And he couldn't take
the day off of work just
because his wife

681
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:20,743
Wasn't feeling well.

682
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,547
<i>But that was wrong.</i>

683
00:57:55,905 --> 00:58:00,843
Your father has never
forgiven himself for the
death of that man's family.

684
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:03,946
He has never
been the same since.

685
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,051
I'm not trying to
make excuses for him.

686
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:16,792
But I wanted you to know
the demons that he
has been fighting.

687
00:58:16,794 --> 00:58:18,093
And losing.

688
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,599
I'm not gonna let him
do this to us anymore.

689
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,614
Doug?

690
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,152
Open the door for mommy.

691
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,857
Oh. Come on, Doug.

692
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,098
I got a present for you.

693
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:45,173
It's a surprise.
Let me in and I'll show you.

694
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:49,144
Quit being a baby.
Mommy needs a man!

695
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:56,184
Douglas Elmore Keiser,
you open this door right now!

696
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:04,059
Open the door right now!

697
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:09,231
No more.

698
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,002
No more! No more!

699
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,738
I'm not doing this anymore!

700
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,907
I'm not doing it anymore!

701
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:24,246
What you give me
is not enough.

702
01:01:24,248 --> 01:01:29,918
It's not enough
for what I gotta pay.
So I'm not doing it no more!

703
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,687
What you're giving me
is not enough.

704
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,758
Is not enough!

705
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,228
At night, when I try
and sleep I can hear them
screaming in my head.

706
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:45,167
I can hear them
screaming in my head.

707
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:54,242
Hey! Hey! Hey!

708
01:01:54,244 --> 01:01:56,311
Oh, shit! Hey!

709
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:06,955
Good boy.

710
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:38,787
What the heck?

711
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,372
Where are you,
you little bastard?
Answer me!

712
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:00,809
I seen ya back here!
Come out, now!

713
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:03,979
You're just making it
worse for yourself, kid!

714
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,315
Answer me!

715
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,987
Answer me! Answer me!

716
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:18,527
Answer me, you little punk!
You want me to come
down there after ya?

717
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:22,230
You don't want me
following you, kid!

718
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:24,566
You know I know
who your parents are!

719
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:51,152
He messed up
your back, too?

720
01:04:51,154 --> 01:04:56,057
He messed up my whole body.
Even my bruises have bruises.
It'll be okay.

721
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:01,396
I'll be okay.
It's not as bad as it looks.

722
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,965
You really should
see a doctor, man.

723
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:07,936
Yeah. Well, I didn't
want to leave without
saying good-bye.

724
01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:10,238
Stay, Barry.
We'll figure something out.

725
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,941
How?

726
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:15,644
I don't know. But we will.

727
01:05:15,646 --> 01:05:20,382
You, me, and Doug.
You can't break up
a good team like that.

728
01:05:20,384 --> 01:05:25,453
Besides, you can't
leave until morning.
It's too dangerous at night.

729
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:28,590
What? You mean,
like, the disappearances?

730
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:33,361
Yeah. But it's
more than that.
I've found out a few things.

731
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:35,664
There is this tombstone
in the old section
of the cemetery,

732
01:05:35,666 --> 01:05:38,066
With strange markings on it.

733
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:40,368
I talked to reverend Moore
about it.

734
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:43,638
He said that the townspeople
used to trap demons
and ghouls.

735
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:47,008
To keep them from
coming back to life again,
they used these stones

736
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,710
Like magical charms.

737
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:53,081
Only, the one I found
was cracked in half.

738
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:54,049
So?

739
01:05:54,051 --> 01:05:55,717
Don't you see?

740
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:58,954
From the ghoul
all these years
is now broken!

741
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:00,322
There's nothing to stop it.

742
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:01,389
Dougie?

743
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:07,329
Doug?

744
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:11,566
Doug?

745
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:20,475
I just thought Timmy
might know where he is.

746
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,111
How long has he been gone?

747
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:25,480
I don't know!

748
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:34,055
When I went to his room to
check on him, he was gone.

749
01:06:34,057 --> 01:06:35,690
And the window
was wide open.

750
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:40,328
He's never done this before.

751
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,199
Do you want me to
call the police?

752
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:45,734
No.

753
01:06:45,736 --> 01:06:50,305
I didn't know! I didn't know!

754
01:06:50,307 --> 01:06:53,575
Listen, listen, listen.

755
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:56,745
Let me go wake up Timmy,
and, and I'll see if he knows
anything, okay?

756
01:06:56,747 --> 01:07:00,015
Come on inside. Come on.
It's okay.

757
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:01,416
I'm so sorry.

758
01:07:01,418 --> 01:07:02,584
No, it's okay.

759
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:03,752
I'm so sorry.

760
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:05,520
Come on, it's okay.

761
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:15,096
We gotta get out of here.
Doug's in trouble.

762
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:16,331
Where do you
think he would go?

763
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,300
There's only one
place he would go.

764
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:22,137
The dugout?

765
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:24,806
He's gotta be there.
Hiding out like a groundhog.

766
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:29,277
How should we do this?

767
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:33,415
Well, I've got my
pocket knife for protection,
but what do you have?

768
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,692
Up there.
My dad's hunting rifle.

769
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:46,428
We use it to clear out
the groundhogs.

770
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,300
Are you okay?

771
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:55,603
What is all this stuff?

772
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:08,616
What? What is it, man?

773
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:11,352
My grandfather's
freemason ring.

774
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:15,423
He wore it at the funeral.
He was buried with it.

775
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:18,293
That doesn't make any sense.
How is that possible?

776
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:22,130
You ever wondered
why your old man brings home
so many nice things?

777
01:08:22,132 --> 01:08:24,632
Earrings for your mom,
a gold watch...

778
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:30,472
We better get this
cleaned up
or we're both dead.

779
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:33,675
Then we'll get that rifle.

780
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,360
Wait a second.

781
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:53,661
What?

782
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:54,662
What's that?

783
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:06,708
Wait. Where's the lantern?
We always keep it
hanging right here.

784
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:13,681
Where are you going?

785
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:16,618
Oh, my God!

786
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,186
What is it?

787
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:18,887
Doug.

788
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,292
No.

789
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:26,828
He's gone down that hole.
We gotta go after him.

790
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:29,664
But how are we
going to stop the ghoul?

791
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:32,433
Well, I read something
in one of my comic books.

792
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:34,502
A comic book?

793
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,771
I know, man,
but hear me out.

794
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:40,241
These comic books
are based on stuff
that really happened.

795
01:09:40,243 --> 01:09:42,677
The way
they stopped the ghoul
was to track it down,

796
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,313
Tie it up, and drag it
into the daylight.

797
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:47,248
So? What happened?

798
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,717
It burns up.
It can't survive
in the light.

799
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:51,319
That's how we stop it!

800
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:53,521
It sounds crazy.

801
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:56,457
Look, I'll head
down into the tunnels.

802
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:59,561
You take your dad's backhoe
and dig open
the sunken graves.

803
01:09:59,563 --> 01:10:02,397
When the sun comes up,
the tunnels will flood
with light.

804
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,265
If I start up the backhoe
in the middle of the night,

805
01:10:04,267 --> 01:10:05,900
Someone's gonna hear it
and call the cops.

806
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:11,272
Good. Let them, man.
Doug is down there,
right now, with that thing.

807
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:12,974
All right. What the hell.

808
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:18,313
Be careful.

809
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:58,913
You've done it now, boy,
haven't you? Yeah?

810
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:08,483
Oh, God...

811
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:10,718
Timmy?

812
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,787
Karen? Are you okay?

813
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,423
I... We...

814
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:19,894
He hurt us. He did things.

815
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:23,664
Please...

816
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:25,733
Do you know how to open this?

817
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,168
You think
we would be here
if she knew?

818
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:29,404
We have tried,
but we are too weak.

819
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:31,172
Sammie?

820
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:34,509
Just hurry, okay? Please.
He could come back
at any moment.

821
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:57,498
Come on.

822
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:06,908
Come on.

823
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,646
I only have this one
flashlight,

824
01:14:11,648 --> 01:14:12,980
So you'll have to
stay close. Okay?

825
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:14,048
Okay.

826
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:15,883
He's coming!

827
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:17,819
It's too late!

828
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,691
Doug?

829
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:25,927
Timmy?
What are you doing here?

830
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:28,863
We don't have time.
We have to get out
of here before it comes back.

831
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:45,012
Run! Everybody run!

832
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,554
Quick! Down this way!

833
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:06,834
Run!

834
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,106
Keep moving!

835
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,051
Run! Down this way!

836
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,092
Oh, wait. Wait!

837
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:42,770
What's going on?

838
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,108
Come on! Run!

839
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:53,314
Come on, Doug!

840
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,698
I bet you've never seen me
run that fast before, huh?

841
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,667
You did good, Doug.

842
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,003
You guys all right?

843
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,139
Yeah. We're all right.

844
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,575
Okay, let's get out of here.

845
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:44,765
You all right?

846
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:45,933
You all right?
Yeah.

847
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,007
Timmy, get away!

848
01:20:55,864 --> 01:20:59,297
