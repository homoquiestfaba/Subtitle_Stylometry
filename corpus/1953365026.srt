1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,022
( Bird chirps)

2
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,299
( beeps )

3
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,530
Man: And we're rolling, sir.

4
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,833
( Birds chirping )

5
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:54,225
Note that this time, the X0-359
had a spontaneous reaction

6
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,924
to the impurities released
by the cigarette smoke.

7
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,500
This is-- this is very good.

8
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,569
This is a very good sign
of progress.

9
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,242
( Beeping )

10
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,910
My God.

11
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,070
Carbon monoxide, zero.

12
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,739
Ammonia, zero.

13
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,851
Nitrogen dioxide, zero.

14
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,015
All airborne impurities
were completely eliminated

15
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,919
in a matter of seconds.

16
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,927
This is...

17
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,085
This is astonishing.

18
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,290
The plant has created pure air.

19
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,395
( Groans )

20
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,833
I don'! know, okay?

21
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,837
It doesn't look like
anyone's dumping today.

22
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,636
I thought you were committed
to catching these polluters,

23
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,641
Mr. Not-Gonna-Happen-On-My-Watch.

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,143
Yeah, I am.
I am.

25
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,441
But that was before
my leg fell asleep

26
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,448
and my obsessive girlfriend
deprived me of food.

27
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,848
Some bastard
is egregiously polluting

28
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,251
this mine with toxic waste.

29
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,016
Look, if we don't catch them
in the act, Joe,

30
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,659
they're gonna ruin
this whole area.

31
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,419
There'll be acidic seepage
in the drinking water,

32
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,928
and wildlife
will start dying off, and--

33
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,827
I know, I know.
Okay.

34
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,831
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,526
Joe: I don't know
what I was thinking.

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,800
- ( Vehicle approaching )
- Hey, we've got company.

37
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,204
( Unzips bag )

38
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,370
Joe:
We got you now, buddy.

39
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,813
( Beeps )

40
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,035
( birds chirping )

41
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,715
Woman:
He looks nervous.

42
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,551
Here, come on.

43
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,106
Kyle.

44
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,908
It's good to see you again.

45
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,582
Joe: Aguy in a suit
coming out of a mine?

46
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,843
You gotta be kidding me.

47
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,213
Something's wrong
with this picture, all right.

48
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,019
You came alone, right?

49
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,091
( Scoffs )
What does it look like?

50
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,886
Keep focused, Kyle.

51
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,927
The sooner you show me the product,
the sooner we can get out of here.

52
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,031
- That the money?
- 'Course.

53
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,393
Show me.

54
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,643
This guy's definitely
not dumping waste.

55
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,710
Well, whatever's going on
doesn't look kosher.

56
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,142
You think it's drugs?

57
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,213
We'll see soon enough.

58
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,143
Now you show me something.

59
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,381
Relax.

60
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:39,819
It's a demonstration.

61
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,285
(grunting )

62
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,261
Why'd that guy cut himself?

63
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,250
M-maybe this is, like,

64
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,443
some secret cult gathering
or something.

65
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,315
I doubt that.

66
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,582
That guy in a suit
looks like a federal agent.

67
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,832
I'm impressed.

68
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,439
Do you have the seed?

69
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,337
Wait here.

70
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,781
Whoa.

71
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,776
- There's a sniper up there.
- Where?

72
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,286
Right there
on the platform.

73
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,826
- Oh, my God.
- What?

74
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,019
He spotted us.

75
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,062
Man on radio:
Sir, I've got eyes on two bogeys.

76
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:57,134
- Where?
- 10:00, behind the concrete block.

77
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,696
(grunts)

78
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,308
Who are your friends, Kyle?

79
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,909
Oh, my Revs-

80
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,204
You trying to set us up?

81
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,710
What are you talking about?

82
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,374
- You wearing a wire?
- No.

83
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,212
Let me go.

84
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,684
Give me the seed.

85
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,715
Joe:
He's not looking.

86
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,327
Whoa.
All right, let's get out of here.

87
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,692
Man on radio:
Sir, they're on the move.

88
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,162
Do I take them out?

89
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,002
KY leg

90
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,572
Man on radio:
Take out primary target.

91
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,440
( Panting )

92
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,911
- ( gunshot, yells)
- Was that a gunshot?

93
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,743
( gasps )

94
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,577
Oh, my God.
They shot him.

95
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,847
( Groans )

96
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,933
(ground vibrating )

97
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,110
What is that?

98
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,043
Joe: An earthquake.

99
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,815
What?

100
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,324
(grunts)

101
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,128
Woman:
Let's get out of here!

102
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,640
(yells)

103
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,118
Ah-- slower, please.

104
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,155
You might damage
the specimen.

105
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,199
There you are.

106
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,643
Aren't you remarkably
well-preserved?

107
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:29,446
Specimen 37 is bell-shaped.
Slightly charred.

108
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,782
With signs of extensive hydrolysis.

109
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,357
Preliminary analysis
leads me to believe

110
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,188
it's Helianthus annuus.

111
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,563
Another sunflower seed.

112
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,738
Look, I don't see anything.

113
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,316
Oh, my God.
That was crazy.

114
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,884
Joe, what the heck
was that?

115
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,147
I don't know. I've never seen
anything like that before.

116
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,223
It looked like some kind of
giant root, right?

117
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,984
I don't know.

118
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,493
But whatever just happened,
people have to know about it.

119
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,597
( Helicopter approaching )

120
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,405
Well, it looks like
someone's on it.

121
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,565
(ground rumbling)

122
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,907
You gotta be kidding me.

123
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,911
Joe: Watch out.
Get in the car.

124
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,572
Get in the car.

125
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:35,879
Joe: Kate!

126
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,586
Joe:
Kate, get in the car!

127
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,251
Kate, get in the car.
Now!

128
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,906
( Birds chirping )

129
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,211
Sir...

130
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,217
Noel, I've asked you
to move slowly

131
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,753
when you're in the garden.

132
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,289
Plants are very sensitive.

133
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,893
Sir, you need
to see the news.

134
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,295
Newscaster:
You are seeing live footage

135
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,296
of what appear to be
gigantic roots

136
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,334
devastating the remote deserts
of Nevada.

137
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,234
I just verified one of
the seed stock is missing.

138
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,930
And I couldn't find Kyle.

139
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,439
He's not on the premises.

140
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,934
Damn him.

141
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,809
Those seeds weren't ready
to be released

142
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,747
into an uncontrolled
environment.

143
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,682
(thunder rumbling)

144
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,149
Woman:
Who are these guys?

145
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,790
Where do they think
they're going?

146
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,659
Woman: Hey, buddy.
No, stop!

147
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,956
( Researchers clamoring )

148
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,792
Man:
Hey, what are you doing?

149
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,490
Slop!

150
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,333
Slop!

151
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,098
What do you think you're doing?

152
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:08,439
You just trampled over
a prehistoric refuse pit.

153
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,171
Isn't it an old garbage dump?

154
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,283
Very old.

155
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,045
Dr. Stein, I'm Special Agent
Jack Tompkins.

156
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,213
We need you to come with us.
It's a matter of national security.

157
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,825
National security?
Are you kidding?

158
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,654
- Did I do something wrong?
- Please get in the car.

159
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,851
We don't have
much time to waste.

160
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,020
Are you sure
you have the right Dr. Stein?

161
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,791
I study plant remains.

162
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,492
You may have knowledge pertaining
to a geological catastrophe

163
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:32,796
unfolding in Nevada.

164
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,529
Now will you please
get in the car?

165
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,804
Jeremy Frame
and Matthew Kyle.

166
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,534
When's the last time
you had contact

167
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,700
with either one
of these gentlemen?

168
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,710
Three years ago.

169
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,512
Dr. Frame hired Kyle
and I to work on

170
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,151
a seed excavation in Turkey.

171
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,218
What kind of seeds?

172
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,218
I don't understand.
What does this have to do

173
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,913
with a geological disaster?

174
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,549
We have reason to believe
this disaster could be man-made.

175
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,390
Well, which is it?
Geological or man-made?

176
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,498
Could be both.

177
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,031
What kind of seeds?

178
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,191
Seeds from the Garden of Eden.

179
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,405
As in...

180
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,270
- the Garden of Eden.
- That's right.

181
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,709
You seriously believe
such seeds can exist?

182
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,075
I wouldn't have spent my time
looking for them if I didn't.

183
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,876
Okay.

184
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,077
Frame found lost passages
in the Dead Sea Scrolls

185
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,621
indicating that,
after Adam and Eve

186
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,257
were banished
from the garden,

187
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,360
Adam stole seeds in an urn
to replant a new garden.

188
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,797
But a flood hit
and the seeds were lost.

189
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,964
Stein: So Frame
got funding for me to dig

190
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,730
in an unmapped area
below the 11,000-year-old site

191
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,429
of Gobekli Tepe,

192
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,269
the prehistoric temple believed
to be the location of Eden.

193
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,378
( Men speaking
in foreign language)

194
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,743
I think we found something.

195
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,407
Kyle:
An intact Neolithic vessel.

196
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,717
- This is amazing.
-( rattling )

197
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,117
Aren't you dying
to take a quick peek?

198
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,553
Don't even think about it, Kyle.

199
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,057
This can only be opened
in an airtight lab.

200
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,061
( Rattling continues)

201
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,927
Unbelievable.

202
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,460
(phone ringing)

203
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,730
Stern: One week later,
I got a call from Frame.

204
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,464
( Staticky voices )

205
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,939
Frame: Jocelyn, I'm afraid
we have some bad news.

206
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,941
We've lost our funding.

207
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,137
Why? What about the urn?

208
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,340
Frame: The um was empty.
There was nothing inside.

209
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,507
But there was.
I heard something.

210
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,620
It was just...

211
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,414
chipped pottery.

212
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,353
Frame:
I'm truly sorry.

213
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,490
Where's Frame now?

214
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,657
I have no idea.
He's a bit of a recluse.

215
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,000
I never knew
where he was based.

216
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,629
Do you know what Frame was planning
on doing with these seeds?

217
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,499
Recreate the Garden of Eden.

218
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,316
(thunder crashing )

219
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,357
Oh, man.
This isn't good.

220
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,994
No.

221
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,027
Now what?

222
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,860
(ground rumbling)

223
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,032
Joe.

224
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,700
You're in danger!

225
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,072
Go!
Get out of here now!

226
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,838
Get in, get in.
Hold on.

227
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,847
- What are you doing?
- Just hold on.

228
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,381
Kate:
Joe, where are you going?

229
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,024
This is crazy.

230
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,889
(tires squealing )

231
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,059
( people clamoring )

232
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,765
(yelling )

233
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,573
( door closes )

234
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,704
What agency is this?

235
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,905
- Welcome to SCOPE.
- SCOPE?

236
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,778
- Never heard of it.
- We keep a low profile.

237
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,783
Our mandate
is to investigate threats

238
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,252
that fall outside the scope
of known science.

239
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,550
Hence the catchy name.

240
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,157
( Office workers chattering )

241
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,597
Man: Got new data from Skynet 2
and Skynet 3.

242
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,928
- ( Phone beeping )
- You're gonna have to put that away.

243
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,626
Got real-time satellite imagery.

244
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,239
Tompkins: You're looking at infrared
of Pershing County, Nevada.

245
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,273
This is what's going on
right now?

246
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,638
Stein:
What is it?

247
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,246
Tompkins: Our recon discovered
massive root growth,

248
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,314
spreading at a rate
of up to 30 miles per hour,

249
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,316
destroying everything in its path
as we speak.

250
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,617
And you think Kyle and Frame
are responsible for this?

251
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:20,780
Yes, we do.

252
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,153
Dr. Stein,
I'm Director Wilson.

253
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,159
We picked up information
that Frame was conducting

254
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,491
what sounded like
a preposterous experiment.

255
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,361
Recreating the Garden of Eden
using prehistoric seeds

256
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,333
from the original garden
in order to sanitize the planet.

257
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,973
How did you
get this information?

258
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,869
Our intel picked up
correspondence

259
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,670
between Kyle
and an interested party.

260
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,506
Seems your buddy's
trying to sell those ancient seeds

261
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,011
on the black market.

262
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,207
Well, that's impossible.
We never found the seeds.

263
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,350
Unless--

264
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,061
Tompkins:
So Frame lied to you.

265
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,139
Any idea why he'd want you
off the project?

266
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,003
I don't know.

267
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,370
Where's Kyle?

268
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,807
We don't know where he is.

269
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,811
But we are pursuing leads
to his whereabouts.

270
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,040
And what about Frame?

271
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,685
Well, we haven't
found him yet.

272
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,718
His so-called
Garden of Eden

273
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,719
was being developed
in a secret location

274
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,721
somewhere in Nevada.

275
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,985
- ( Camera whirrs)
- Joe's voice: Kate, get in the car.

276
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,151
Oh, my God.
This...

277
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,729
This is surreal.

278
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,230
- What are those things?
- I don't know.

279
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,893
I don't know. I can't believe we
just saw all those people get killed.

280
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,061
We need to go
to the authorities and tell them

281
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,764
what we saw happen
at the mine.

282
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,103
Look.

283
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,405
We're not going
to the authorities, okay?

284
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,106
Those guys we saw at the mine,
they looked like Feds.

285
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,584
So what if this is some

286
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,378
government test gone haywire?

287
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,920
I mean, what happens to us
when powerful people

288
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,421
try to cover their tracks?

289
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,685
A lot of people
are getting killed.

290
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,558
So until we know
who's involved,

291
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,527
we don't know
who we can trust.

292
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,534
Okay.

293
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,433
If we do this,
we go all the way.

294
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,142
- Whatever it takes.
- Yep.

295
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,542
(sighs)

296
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,114
All right, the first thing
we need to do

297
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,877
is we need to figure out
where that van came from.

298
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,309
( Camera whirrs )

299
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,955
Kate:
I have an idea.

300
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,281
What do you want from me?

301
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,450
I'm not saying
we buy into this whole

302
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,392
"Garden of Eden" thing.

303
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,922
But if these seeds,
in fact, are prehistoric

304
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,499
and have something
to do with it,

305
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:44,896
we need to know.

306
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,903
And right now
you are our only lead.

307
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,602
( Workers chattering )

308
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,412
Incredible.

309
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,346
I've never seen
a root system develop

310
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,816
on such a massive scale before.

311
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,148
Yeah, well,
you're not alone.

312
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,814
At least the outbreak
is in a remote area.

313
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,960
Now, break it down for me.

314
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,823
Give it to me in science-ese.

315
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,327
Tompkins:
Talk to me like I'm five.

316
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,023
A scientific explanation
for what's happening.

317
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,462
I warned Frame
there was a danger

318
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,931
to awakening
a prehistoric plant

319
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,536
in today's toxic world.

320
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,437
Stein: I don't have
an explanation yet, but...

321
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,508
(sighs)

322
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,703
you can't ignore the warnings
in the Bible.

323
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,780
And I can't formulate
a game plan

324
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,110
for fighting a disaster
based on a fable.

325
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,776
The Bible may be a fable to you,
Agent Tompkins,

326
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,946
but archeologists have found
evidence that events it depicts

327
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,819
have actually occurred
throughout history.

328
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,825
Jack, there's
a new development.

329
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,463
You need to see this.

330
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,001
G-L-9-4-3-X.

331
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,868
- What's that?
- License plate.

332
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,168
- Kate: On the van.
- Yeah? Really?

333
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,507
Okay, well...

334
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,205
now we need someone
to hack into the DMV.

335
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,218
Both: Spit.

336
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,876
Wilson:
We were lucky until now,

337
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,886
but the growth just picked up speed
near Pyramid Lake.

338
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,854
In less than three hours,
this disaster's gonna hit

339
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,493
its first major city.

340
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,222
Bob, Reno needs
to be evacuated.

341
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,890
- That's not your call, Jack.
- Well, then call the President.

342
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,502
This thing is destroying
everything in its path.

343
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,071
The fatalities are gonna
be staggering, Bob.

344
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,400
Okay,
we're talking about evacuating

345
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,509
half a million people
in a matter of hours.

346
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,008
Wilson:
It can't be done.

347
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,572
You wanna save these people?

348
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,274
Stop the damn roots.

349
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,290
( Door slams )

350
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,101
I :Pit!
Pit!

351
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,761
- Spit, buddy. You in there?
- You there?

352
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,873
Hope the air in there
is breathable this time.

353
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,906
Yeah, don't count on it.
Spit.

354
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,100
HEY-

355
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,939
Hey, man.
What are you guys doing here?

356
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,103
Don't you know what's going on?
Have you seen the freakin' news?

357
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,079
Yeah, yeah. We know, man.
We need your help.

358
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,241
We need you
to track a plate for us.

359
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,077
Tompkins:
Listen, we're running out of time.

360
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,884
This thing is effectively
still just a plant, right?

361
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,491
So why don't we kill it
like you would a weed?

362
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,127
Dump a bunch
of herbicide on it?

363
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,160
Herbicides work too slowly.

364
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,797
The feeder roots
are growing too fast and we'd need

365
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,229
thousands of gallons immediately.

366
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,629
What's a feeder root?

367
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,135
It's the root tip,
where the growth occurs.

368
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,136
So if we cut the root tips
leading to this thing,

369
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,899
we can stop its growth.

370
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,974
It could cripple
the entire system.

371
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,611
That's what we'll do.

372
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,444
Sever the root tip.
We'd launch a surgical air strike,

373
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,674
- we knock this thing out.
- There's a catch.

374
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,683
If the root recovers,
you risk having it regrow...

375
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,822
and multiply.

376
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,288
We don't have a choice.

377
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,325
Get me the President.

378
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,368
( Cat meowing )

379
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,303
We don't have much time here, Spit.
You in yet?

380
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,104
Give me a minute, man.

381
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,838
(ground rumbles)

382
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,846
Oh, my God.

383
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,849
Kate:
Joe, you feel that, right?

384
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,153
Okay, come on, Spit, man.
Let's go. It's coming.

385
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,125
I'm offline.

386
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,627
I lost connection.

387
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,862
- Well, we gotta go now.
- No, we need that address.

388
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,232
Can you get back on?

389
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,702
( Mewing )

390
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,469
- Oh-- cable got knocked out.
- Yes.

391
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,646
Okay, we have
to leave right now.

392
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,378
Seconds away.

393
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,516
Come on.
We're running out of time.

394
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,255
- I'm in.
- Here.

395
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,550
The plate number.

396
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:05,389
( Keyboard clicking )
G-L-9-4-3-X. Come on.

397
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,599
Kate: Hurry, Spit.

398
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,533
Spit: Almost there, Katie.
Just a few seconds.

399
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,401
Come on, come on.

400
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,668
There's your registrant
and address.

401
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,438
- Alamut Corp Industries.
- Got it.

402
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,749
( Panting )

403
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,852
( gasps )

404
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,089
- Let's take my truck.
- Go.

405
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:38,686
Wait.

406
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,421
I've got to get my cat, man.

407
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,759
- No, no, no! No!
- No!

408
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,266
- Whoa.
- Spit!

409
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,135
Whoa!

410
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,433
Spit.

411
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,271
- Get in the truck.
- Kate: Okay.

412
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,593
This is Ace One.

413
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,891
We're 10 miles out
and coming in low with 3-6-0.

414
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,071
Joe, look.

415
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,608
Joe: Oh, my God.

416
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,443
I think they're
gonna bomb it.

417
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,751
We gotta get out of here.

418
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,855
Pilot on radio:
Approaching targets. ETA 60 seconds.

419
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,601
Initiating separation.

420
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,008
Kate:
This doesn't look good.

421
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,949
We're right
in their line of fire.

422
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,851
We have visual confirmation
on target.

423
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,231
Going weapons hot.
Engaging in 20 seconds.

424
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,030
Can't this thing go any faster?

425
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,402
This thing's
an old piece of crap.

426
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,566
Joe:
I'm flooring it already.

427
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,542
I have missile lock.

428
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,239
Pilot:
Firing in five, four,

429
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:42,545
three, two, one.

430
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,153
Engage.

431
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,020
Oh, my God.
They've fired.

432
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,218
- Drive faster!
- I'm trying to!

433
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,783
Pilot:
Command, we have a direct hit.

434
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,861
Waiting for debris to clear
to verify destruction of targets.

435
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,038
Have visual verification.

436
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:47,275
Targets destroyed.
I repeat, targets destroyed.

437
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,419
( Cheering )

438
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,954
Wilson:
Okay, that's a kill.

439
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,785
Good work, everyone.

440
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,563
- Nicely done.
- Nice work, Jack.

441
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,500
Poor Spit.

442
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,937
All right.
We're gonna get these bastards.

443
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,136
All right?

444
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,282
Joe:
Whoever caused this.

445
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,111
( Computer beeping )

446
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:24,917
Jack?

447
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,579
Look at the screen.

448
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,033
Patch me through
to the lead pilot.

449
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:42,502
( Man dials)
Here, sir.

450
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,439
- This is Director Wilson speaking.
- Pilot: Yes, sir.

451
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,105
I need another visual confirmation
of the target's destruction.

452
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,684
Roger, sir.
Give us a moment to double back.

453
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,185
Slow down, Joe.
There's a driveway ahead.

454
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,836
Joe: Is this it?
I don't see an address.

455
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,575
That's got to be it, Joe.

456
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,507
There's nothing else
around here.

457
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,648
All right, well,
let's go down the road.

458
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,909
See if we can find a way
to sneak in.

459
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,692
Approaching visual range.

460
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,417
Pilot: Target remains.

461
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:40,189
I repeat, target remains.

462
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,162
Sir, I've got eyes
on multiple targets now.

463
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,362
Pilot:
This thing is spreading.

464
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,837
Stein:
It's been burrowing.

465
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,910
It's regenerating exponentially.

466
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,206
Not only that.
Look at where it's headed.

467
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:00,782
Right here.

468
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:05,917
Sir, confirming new target
inbound on Carson City.

469
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,524
Okay, engage target.

470
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,593
I repeat, you blast that monstrosity
with everything you've got.

471
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,026
Roger, sir.
Changing vector.

472
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,601
Pilot: ETA one minute
to new target.

473
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,765
The bombing isn't working.
It's only making it worse.

474
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,638
Stern:
You have to stop them.

475
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,045
Pilot:
Going weapons hot.

476
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:34,241
45 seconds out.

477
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,977
Baker and Charlie,
follow my lead to picking targets.

478
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,587
Pilot #2: Roger.

479
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,417
Target confirmed.

480
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,115
You gotta cancel this, Bob.

481
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,954
- Are you questioning me?
- Nope.

482
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,554
But she's right.

483
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,096
If we bomb this thing again,
it's just gonna get bigger.

484
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,665
We gotta think
this thing through.

485
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,301
This thing is headed here.

486
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,063
I don't know how much time we've got
to think it through.

487
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,234
Pilot: Eagle flight.
Entering debris cloud.

488
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,242
- Pilot: Visibility near zero.
- Bob...

489
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,141
We've got multiple bogeys
on radar.

490
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,352
Command,
Eagle Baker is down!

491
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,088
I repeat,
Eagle Baker is down!

492
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,960
Eagle One, clarify.

493
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,532
It's this debris cloud, sir.

494
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,533
Sir, the roots
are erupting all around us

495
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:29,002
and they are massive.

496
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,943
Command,
Eagle Charlie is down.

497
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,105
I repeat,
Eagle Charlie is down!

498
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:44,277
Pilot: Command, I've got too many
bogeys to complete the mission.

499
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:48,015
Okay, abort mission.
I repeat, abort mission.

500
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:52,052
Roger.
I'm getting out of here.

501
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,722
Oh, my God.
No!

502
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,067
Woman:
Eagle One, come in.

503
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,136
( Static )

504
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,331
Woman:
Eagle One, come in.

505
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,305
( Static continues )

506
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,069
Woman: Eagle One,
confirm status.

507
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,576
All right, we gotta get
out of harm's way.

508
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:11,578
Is there any way to predict
this thing's movement?

509
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:14,149
Growing roots usually take
the path of least resistance.

510
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,915
We'd be safer
at a higher elevation.

511
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,986
All right, let's move.

512
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:21,652
Okay, people.
Pack it up.

513
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,657
I'm calling a full evacuation.
Head for the transports.

514
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,924
We're moving out.

515
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,361
( Chattering )

516
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,506
This has to be it.

517
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,938
They really
don't want visitors, do they?

518
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,380
- Yeah. That's barbed wire.
- Here.

519
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,851
Here we go.
Here, I'll lift you up.

520
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:00,295
Okay, ready?
One, two, three.

521
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,125
(grunting )

522
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,238
Noel, we have trespassers
at the northwest perimeter.

523
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,209
Frame: At C Gate.

524
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,610
I'll get security on it
right away, sir.

525
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,212
(ground rumbling)

526
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,121
Oh, my God.

527
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,619
( gasps )

528
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,492
Wha-.

529
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:38,726
Joe?

530
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,436
God.
All right, go! Go!

531
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:43,971
Get off the fence!

532
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,437
Get off!

533
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,842
Okay.
Okay.

534
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:53,474
Watch out.

535
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,143
(alarm blaring )

536
00:32:56,308 --> 00:33:00,814
Man on P.A.:
Please evacuate the facility.

537
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,357
Follow the exit path.

538
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,523
Get down!

539
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,302
Kate: Joe!

540
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,131
(yells)

541
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,772
Kate:
Joe, it's coming.

542
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,805
(alarm continues)

543
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,608
Wilson: Jack!

544
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,622
- Joe, hurry!
- ( grunts)

545
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,232
Kate: Get up there!

546
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,033
' ( Yells )
- Joe!

547
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,230
Kate, get out of here.

548
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,568
Go! Kate, go!

549
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,742
I'm not leaving you.
Hang on, Joe.

550
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,648
Jack!

551
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,876
Follow Datsun and stay low.

552
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,681
- Datsun!
- Dr. Stein, come on!

553
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,194
Kate:
Joe, Joe!

554
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,423
Kate:
You gotta get up there, now.

555
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,368
Joe, are you okay?

556
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:34,109
Yeah.
Yeah.

557
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,072
That's weird.
It just suddenly stopped.

558
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,401
Yeah.

559
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,376
What do you think
that means?

560
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,209
I don't know.

561
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,214
But let's not stick around
in case it starts again.

562
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:09,784
Okay.

563
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:16,282
(distant rumbling )

564
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,459
- What happened?
- Incredible.

565
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,962
The growth was diverted.

566
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,930
Our garden has repelled
the hostile roots.

567
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,732
Held them back.

568
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:31,305
- Noel: But they're still spreading.
- Frame: Yes.

569
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,409
They're in a hypermetabolic state.

570
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,102
If I can find a way to reduce
the rate of cell division,

571
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,144
I can slow them down,
control them.

572
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,748
Like the plants
in our garden.

573
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,009
Frame: This work must
not be disturbed,

574
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,983
so you must be sure
to secure the grounds.

575
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,918
It's only a matter of time
before others discover

576
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:50,423
this is the only safe haven
in the country.

577
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,436
Woman on radio: Remote base
should be up and running in 20 minutes.

578
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,130
Copy that.
ETA 20 minutes.

579
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,935
Mobile unit's waiting for us
40 miles north up the mountain.

580
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,975
Is that elevation
gonna be high enough?

581
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:10,272
It should be.

582
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:13,644
- Any idea what our casualties were?
- Tompkins: Substantial.

583
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,684
Doctor, I need to know everything
you know about these seeds.

584
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,617
Is there anything in the Bible,
the Dead Sea Scrolls,

585
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,281
anything at all that can help us
fight this disaster?

586
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,526
There is a warning in the Bible.

587
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,687
From the Book of Isaiah.

588
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,299
"The earth mourns
and withers,

589
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:33,527
befouled by its
inhabitants.

590
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,901
Hence a curse
devours the earth,

591
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:38,871
and those who live upon it."

592
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,673
How does that apply to us?
What does that mean exactly?

593
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,972
Are you starting to get
your faith back, Jack?

594
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:49,042
I don't hear our science agencies
coming up with any answers.

595
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:53,316
The seeds are from Eden,
a time when the earth was pure.

596
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,389
Stein:
Before pollution.

597
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,191
I think the Bible was warning us
to take care of Mother Earth

598
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,693
or face her wrath.

599
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,229
What are you saying?

600
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,333
That's why they regenerated
into something bigger

601
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:05,900
after we bombed them.

602
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,901
Right. The more toxins we throw at it,
the bigger it's gonna get.

603
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,403
To cleanse the earth.

604
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,906
We're not gonna beat this thing
by fighting it head-on.

605
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,944
We gotta find an angle.

606
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,365
Well, the answers
we need are in there.

607
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,898
You see an entrance?

608
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,235
Joe: Bingo.

609
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,772
Guard on walkie-talkie:
Copy that, Team 2.

610
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,467
- Come here, come here.
- What?

611
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,044
There's someone out there.

612
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,545
Guard on walkie-talkie:
Team one, check in.

613
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,444
- Team, go on to zone five.
- Kate: He's got a gun.

614
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,783
- He's coming this way.
- Really?

615
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,219
Yeah.

616
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,381
( Branch snaps )

617
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:05,050
Go, go.
Now!

618
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,218
- Whoa!
Go, go, go, go!

619
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,598
Why are they shooting at us?

620
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,099
I don't know.
You wanna stop and ask them?

621
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:44,030
Doctor, the chopper
will be here soon.

622
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:45,930
That'll give us a better look
than that satellite imagery.

623
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,433
They just confirmed, sir.

624
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,469
Man:
Reno's being devastated.

625
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:50,970
Jack, look.

626
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:54,372
The root growth has been destroying
everything in its path.

627
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,307
Except here.

628
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:59,206
Why would it skip this area?

629
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,351
It's the same elevation as
everything else it's destroyed, right?

630
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,214
Good question.

631
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,219
- We need to go there and find out.
- Right.

632
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,187
I think we've got something here.

633
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,357
Understood.

634
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,825
Doesn't matter.
We're moving on.

635
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,726
- Changing course.
- Changing course?

636
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,628
Operation Safeguard's in effect.

637
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:19,962
- Sir?
- What is Operation Safeguard?

638
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,569
It's the evacuation
of all Cabinet personnel

639
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,797
to a fallout shelter
in the Colorado mountains.

640
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,203
Don't you think that's a bit premature?
This crisis has just begun.

641
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,503
The President's science advisors
ran computer simulations.

642
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,010
In one week, the whole country
will be consumed.

643
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,876
And in 24 hours,
Cheyenne Mountain

644
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,210
and Colorado
will be inaccessible.

645
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,580
Okay, that gives us
24 hours to fight it.

646
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,585
That's exactly what I and the
Administration will be doing.

647
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,314
But from the safety
of the shelter.

648
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,484
We need to protect the executive branch
of government.

649
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,595
- You know that.
- Look.

650
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,664
The destruction has skipped
this entire area for some reason.

651
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:52,768
We need to get there,
find out why.

652
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,835
It might hold the answer
on how to stop this thing.

653
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,904
And what if it doesn't?

654
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,734
What then?

655
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,433
It's a waste of precious time.

656
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,407
Hiding in the mountains.
That's a better use of our time.

657
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,411
The plan is to get out of harm's way
until we can come up with a solution.

658
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,174
That's absurd.
On whose orders?

659
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,783
The President's.

660
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,218
We've been assigned to join the team
at Cheyenne Mountain.

661
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,122
Military transport
will be here in 30 minutes.

662
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:19,387
You can choose to be on it
or you can risk your life on a hunch.

663
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,086
Your choice.

664
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:25,227
Dr. Stein, you're
more than welcome to join us.

665
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,428
After all, we need
to protect great minds.

666
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,906
( Groans )

667
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,446
- You okay?
- Yeah.

668
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,948
Joe, what...

669
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,381
Whoa.

670
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,385
Kate: It's beautiful.

671
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,715
What-- what is this place?

672
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,561
What do you think
they're hiding?

673
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:55,925
Something they don'!
want us to find.

674
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,794
Not if they're shooting at us.

675
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,633
Maybe we should leave, Joe.

676
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,739
- This is getting dangerous.
- ( groans )

677
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,772
You're bleeding.

678
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,402
Oh, my God.
You're shot.

679
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:09,806
It's just a graze.
Don't worry about it.

680
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,312
No, that looks serious, Joe.
You need medical attention.

681
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,006
Yeah, well, that's not
gonna happen.

682
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:17,244
Besides, I'm not leaving until we
get proof to nail these guys.

683
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:18,944
Okay?

684
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,084
Okay.

685
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,624
Try to stop the bleeding
with this.

686
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,626
- Okay.
- You're no good to me if you're dead.

687
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,128
( Chuckles )

688
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,630
- ( branches snapping )
- ( voices overlapping )

689
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,665
Okay, we gotta lose these guys.
Let's go.

690
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,326
( Groans )

691
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:46,180
You want to explain to me
what's going on, Bob?

692
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,509
As far as I know, our responsibility
is to protect this country,

693
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,676
regardless of the risks.

694
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,518
We were trying
to protect this country.

695
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,716
What are you talking about?

696
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,027
- We screwed up today, Jack.
- What do you mean "we"?

697
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:06,193
SCOPE had a covert team
in the field

698
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,995
when this thing went haywire.

699
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,036
What were they doing out there?

700
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,566
Securing the seeds from Kyle.

701
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,335
You're kidding me.

702
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,502
Those seeds
are a security threat.

703
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,579
Once we had credible evidence
of their existence,

704
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,580
we had no choice
but to pursue possession of them.

705
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,979
Why wasn't I told about this?

706
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:24,484
I couldn't talk about it.
It was top secret.

707
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:25,814
Top secret?
Screw top secret.

708
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,251
You hid a vital piece of intel

709
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:29,858
when millions of people's lives
were at stake.

710
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,755
( Sighs )
Bob.

711
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:34,861
That's how the game's played, Jack.
You know that.

712
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,560
It's not a game.

713
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,196
There's real people out here
losing their lives.

714
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,667
Transport will be here
in 10 minutes.

715
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,268
You can still join us.

716
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,709
Give the President my regards.

717
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:55,442
- Where are you going?
- To clean up the mess you made.

718
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,711
(walkie-talkie chattering )

719
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,085
There's an answer here.

720
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,284
We just have to
find out what it is.

721
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,930
Couldn't agree more.

722
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,434
Where exactly are we going?

723
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,535
You're not coming.

724
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,542
This could be a one-way ticket.

725
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,477
I want you to stay here
and wait for the transport, okay?

726
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,617
- All right.
- You take care of your family, Datsun.

727
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,117
Thank you.
Good luck, Jack.

728
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,652
- Doctor.
- Be safe.

729
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,380
Tompkins:
Keep your head down.

730
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,954
This is where we're going.

731
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,893
Put your headset on.

732
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:48,896
Pilot: Stand by for lift off.

733
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,801
Tompkins: Copy that.

734
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,845
( Panting )

735
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,024
( groans )

736
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:18,599
Joe!

737
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,670
Hey, look.
We need to get you help.

738
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,330
Yeah, from who?

739
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,498
From those
trigger-happy lunatics?

740
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,647
Okay, maybe we can find
a first-aid kit somewhere.

741
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:42,551
Kate...

742
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:44,953
Kate...

743
00:44:45,116 --> 00:44:47,153
What's happening to me?

744
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,698
You're healing.

745
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,137
This doesn't make any sense.
How?

746
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,549
It's the leaf.

747
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,208
Something in the leaf
healed you.

748
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,723
- I can't believe it.
- Would you stop that?

749
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,484
Sorry. It hurts?
