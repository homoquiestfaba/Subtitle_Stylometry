00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,050
The theory is that
what we are is love.

But we forget that,

134
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,653
and wind up looking around
for something we already have.

So to avoid getting hung up
on whatever attracts us,

136

we just say "love."

Get it as often as you can.

152

I think I'm like you.

154
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,143
Maybe it's because
we both have the penis.

155

What? You think gay guys
don't have penises?

156

I don't think that's the kind of fit
Plato's talking about.

163
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:10,579
Would make
the perfect fantasy though.

That's Doug is a carpenter.

-So, Sal.
-No, don't , okay?

369
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:58,700
Never Quido and no Sal.

370
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,745
That's what the kids
all through high school called me --

371
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:02,177
Sal, short for Sally.

372
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:03,839
It's cool.

373
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:07,617
Okay, no Sal.

Actually, uh....

They were envious.

jump-rope "peppers"

377
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,754
faster or longer than I could --
even the older kids.

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:22,557
Oh, no, no. There was this one girl.
My best friend actually.

379
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:25,831
We thought we were soulmates
till her parents moved away.

380
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:27,269
She could jump just as good.

I'm eating her food all of a sudden.

I told her I'm picking up vibes
from when she meditates.

Well, when your eliminations
are healthy,

401

No.

Improper eating,

406
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:44,714
Eating that dead food is like
not putting out your garbage.

407
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:47,307
It rots -- stench, putrefaction.

408
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:50,252
No, imagine.
Pounds of toxic waste in your gut.

409
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:51,754
Then the intestines pick that up,

410
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:53,154
and they absorb it
into your system --

411
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:55,021
into your blood -- your brain!

412

swimming around in all that crap,

414
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:03,299
so we can remind each other
of who we really are?

415
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:05,233
It's like putting a TV antenna
in the closet --

416
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:07,805
the reception's lousy.

We're the antennas,

and we're always receiving signals
from the universal wisdom station.

419
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:20,551
But the blocked up colon
makes us deaf -- spiritually.

tall steeples. God's antenna.

we got shit built up in our systems?
