1
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,582
I remember most of 17.

2
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,256
I remember the day we met.

3
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,927
His smile, his touch.

4
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,140
You could be anywhere
when your life begins...

5
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,770
when the future
opens up in front of you...

6
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:06,108
and you may not even
realize it at first...

7
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,151
but it's already happening.

8
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,782
All right, guys,
let's roll, man.

9
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,660
-What, fool?
-Man!

10
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,120
I got some shit to do, man.

11
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,663
Fool, you always
got shit to do.

12
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:20,956
Man, you got to
learn how to kick it.

13
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,292
It's a beautiful day
on the beach, man.

14
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,544
Why, you afraid
of getting too brown?

15
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,921
Some fool might think
he's Mexican.

16
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,214
Shut up.

18
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,552
Hey, guys,
check it out, man.

19
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,097
Hey, hey, hey.
Look at the juanita.

20
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,725
Yeah! Whoo!

21
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,226
Come on, baby.

22
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,644
Hey, we got some trash
over here.

23
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,646
-It's starting to stink.
-Hey, hey, hey!

24
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,231
Hey, don't let me go.

25
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,609
-Should I drop him ?
-Let me go, please.

26
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,402
Aah! Unh!

27
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,279
Yo! Hey, you all right?

28
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,697
Yeah, I'm all right.
Don't worry about me.

29
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,657
Whoo!

30
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,867
Yo, baby!

31
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:57,868
Hey, where you going?

32
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,411
Hey, hey, hey.

33
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,747
Let's go.

34
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,792
Hey, hey, hey.
You missed one.

36
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,922
Thanks.
That's really helpful.

37
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,924
So, are you
a bad-ass gangster or what?

38
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,219
Something like that.

39
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,346
What'd you do,
stay up past your bedtime?

40
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,849
Nah, I'm just playing.
For real, what you doing?

41
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,061
-I robbed a 7-Eleven.
-What?

42
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,104
Yeah. Stay away.
I'm dangerous.

43
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,273
I'll mess you up.

44
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,192
Damn. My bad.

45
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,778
Man...

46
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,947
y'all always got
to follow me, man.

47
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,865
My name's Victor.
What's your name?

48
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,116
She don't care
what's your name.

49
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,202
-Nicole.
-Nice to meet you.

50
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,787
Carlos.

51
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,664
Hi, Carlos.

52
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,040
What's up?

53
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,043
Man, I was talking to her.
What you doing?

54
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,753
You know what?
I've seen you around.

55
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,797
Doubt it.

56
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,007
-You go to Pacific, right?
-Yeah.

57
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,968
Yo, rich girl.

59
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:00,848
Rich girl.

60
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,516
Hey.

61
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,142
Hey, let's go. Come on.

62
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,644
Push on. You know, vamonos.

63
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,355
Vamonos? We only
talking to the girl, man.

64
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:11,859
-Vamonos. Now. Let's go.
-What's vamonos, man?

65
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,527
You know what it means.
Now let's go.

66
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,903
Just keep moving.

67
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,447
-I'll see you around. Bye.
-Yeah.

68
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,657
I just want you
to leave, all right?

69
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,535
Bye-bye.
Come on, keep moving.

70
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,538
Please, get out of here!

71
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,208
I want this all picked up--
all of it.

73
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,601
Carlos.

74
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,102
Carlos.

77
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,901
OK.

78
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,375
Good morning, Mom.

80
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,630
Yeah.

81
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,930
Thanks, Mom.

82
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,436
I don't want any more.

84
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,481
Oh, yeah?

89
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,573
Miss Nicole,
it's time to get up.

90
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,116
I'm awake.

91
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,385
-Morning.
-Good morning.

92
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,845
ROSA:
Are you taking lunch today?

93
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,263
No, I'm going to buy.

95
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,103
Rosa?

96
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,689
Rosa?

97
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,733
Yes, Mrs. Courtney?

98
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,402
Did Morgan have
any dairy yesterday?

99
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,570
No.

100
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:47,741
Because she has a little rash
right here, you see?

101
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,327
No dairy.

102
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,579
I'm not accusing you.
I'm just asking.

103
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,874
No dairy. Only soy.

104
00:06:55,916 --> 00:07:01,004
-No dairy.
-No. No dairy.

105
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,965
OK.

106
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,926
TV: You whale.
You have a spout. Ha ha!

107
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,928
Mmm.

108
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,598
Nicole, you're not supposed
to watch TV in the morning.

109
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,101
Are you going to change
for school?

110
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,936
-Mrs. Courtney?
-Yeah.

111
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,397
-Mr. Oakley.
-Oh, OK.

112
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,023
Hi, sweetie. Yeah.

113
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,567
Oh, no, she's got
a little rash on her back...

114
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,277
so it's a little crazy.

115
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,362
Yeah. We're going to go
to Dr. Benniman's office.

116
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,114
I'll call you
from there, then.

117
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,615
Yes, I love you, too.
I love you.

118
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,075
Oh, Nicole is here.

119
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,119
Do you want to say
something to her?

120
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,831
Bye.

121
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,958
He's late for a meeting.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,668
Come on, sweetie.

123
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,505
We'll go to the doctor
and get your rash all better.

126
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,519
What's
the evil step mom's problem?

127
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,730
Oh, major crisis.
Morgan has a rash.

128
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,524
Oh, my God.
Where's the ambulance?

129
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,196
WOToday

130
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,740
Like any day

131
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,492
Rolled out of bed

132
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,870
Talked on the telephone

133
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,705
Went to the doctor

134
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:20,334
She said, you're OK

135
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,795
Still, I wonder

136
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,673
Who am I?

137
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,009

Oh, that's just great.

138
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,802
Who am I?

140
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,347
Oh.

141
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:39,728
Who am I?

142
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,482
Today

143
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,026
In the air

144
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,278
On the water

145
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,822
Ships pass you by

146
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,533
Clouds fantasize

147
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:56,286
Driving shapes
across the sky

148
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,331
Wondering why

149
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,749
Oh, my God.

150
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,709
Who am I?

151
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,671
Oops.

152
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,050
Hi.

153
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:13,053
Oh, God.
I hate this place.

154
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,305
Yeah.
I'm already up for ditching.

155
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,891
For sure.

156
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,893
Shit sucks.

157
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,354
NARRATOR: Shakespeare was,
in many ways...

158
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,022
ahead of his time.

159
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,816
He had
psychological depth...

160
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,651
that is only
in this century...

161
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,862
beginning to be
fully understood.

163
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,698
-Yes?
-Bathroom?

164
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,493
-Me, too.
-Take a pass.

165
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,911
Oh, thank you.

166
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,914
NARRATOR: Both at a time
when only a queen...

167
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,416
TEACHER:All right,
so the British are trying...

168
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,085
to reestablish authority
over their precious colonies.

169
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,962
it's as if
they're trying to assert...

170
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,673
a right that
they couldn't quite exert.

171
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:50,924
Assert and exert.

172
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,719
Anybody know the difference
between assert and exert?

173
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,637
What does it mean
in this case?

174
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,930
Anybody?

175
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,932
It means
they could write the laws...

176
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,852
but they couldn't enforce them
from 3,000 miles away.

177
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:03,353
TEACHER: Bingo, Carlos.

178
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,730
They're 3,000 miles away...

179
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,607
and they're trying
to establish their authority...

180
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:07,649
over their colonies.

181
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,152
They are trying
to reestablish...

182
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,446
their mercantilist
philosophy...

183
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,781
which was,
"'We got colonies...

184
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,283
"'and we're here to milk them."'

185
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,659
How were they doing this?

186
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,494
Well, Greenville,
the man in charge...

187
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,121
under George the Third...

189
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,717
Once in a house
on a hill

190
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,679
A boy got angry

191
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,142
He broke into my heart

192
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:47,022
So I came down the hill

193
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,401
Of course I was hurt

194
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,612
But then
I started to think

195
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,865
it shouldn't hurt me
to be free

196
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,368
it's what I really need

197
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,120
To pull myself together

198
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,916
But if it's so good
being free

199
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,877
What you are telling me

200
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,213
Why I don't know
what to do with myself

201
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,339
Hey!

202
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,676
Hey, come here.

203
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,846
I got to get back to class.

204
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,722
No.
Come meet my friends.

205
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:21,765
Hi.

206
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,351
Come on.
What, are you scared?

207
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,815
It's Carlos, right?

208
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,650
Right.

209
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,695
Break me off some of that shit.

210
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,780
-This is Maddy.
-Hi.

211
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,699
-Hi.
-That's Lainie.

212
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,033
-Hi.
-Foster.

213
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:43,203
-Curtis is in the tree.
-What's up, man?

214
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,541
Carlos and I met when I was
giving back to the community.

215
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,251
He was on
the chain gang with you?

216
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,879
-No.
-Just an innocent bystander.

217
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,381
-You want some?
-Nah, that's OK.

218
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,757
Come on,
it's good for you.

219
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,634
Trust me.

220
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,679
So I loved the boy

221
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,598
No one could ever forget

223
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,185
Damn!

224
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,228
-With a kick.
-What's in this?

225
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,230
-Incoming, you guys.
-Oh, shit. Give me this.

226
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,024
What's going on?

227
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,318
Hey.

228
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,777
Well, what do you know?

229
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,905
My all-time favourite people
in the world to bust.

230
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,199
-Hello, Mr. Kane.
-How's it going?

231
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,658
Hey, this is
a student council meeting.

232
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,118
You know what?
You need to get back to class.

233
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,369
FOSTER: I got too much stress
in my life.

234
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,787
We got to take a break,
or we'll pop.

235
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,414
Ask the mental
heathcenter people.

236
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,082
They told us to take breaks.

237
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,251
What is this?
Who's this belong to?

238
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,419
Not us.

239
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,213
You don't know anything
about this, right?

240
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,006
I got a pass.

241
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,175
What, a drinking pass?

242
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:41,178
You guys, let's go.
Clear out.

243
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,976
Hey! Aah!

244
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,978
Hey! Hey! Guys!

245
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,773
Cut it out.
Come on, this is detention.

246
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,531
Hey.

247
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,617
This is how we first met.

248
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:04,618
What?

249
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,036
Picking up trash.

250
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:10,249
Just let me do the work, OK?

251
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,544
Sure.

252
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,587
3, 2, hut!

253
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,257
You got it!

255
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,760
Good job.

256
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,262
-Carlos.
-What?

257
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,389
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, well, so am I.

258
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,725
No, I really am.
Come on, it's just detention.

259
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:29,935
You're not going
to be scarred for life.

260
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,812
You may even still
get into college.

261
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:34,857
Look, you guys play around
at being bad-ass...

262
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,775
which is cool. Whatever.

263
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:37,901
But it's not like that
for me.

264
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,695
I get on this bus...

265
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,697
this piece of shit,
stinking bus...

266
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,699
two hours each way,
just to be here.

267
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,076
5:43 in the morning--
that's when my bus leaves.

268
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:49,496
So if I wanted to screw up,
I'd do it at my home school...

269
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,498
because I'd get
a hell of a lot more sleep.

270
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,083
But I'm here, OK?

271
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,002
I'm here because
I really want to be here.

272
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,337
And you,
you're here because...

273
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,716
Why are you here,
if it's such a big joke to you?

274
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,426
I don't know.
Ask my father.

275
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,844
What?

276
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,221
Nothing.

278
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,021
Why were you on the beach?

279
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,939
Beach?

280
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,650
You didn't rob any 7-Eleven.

281
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,028
Oh.

282
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:24,031
DUI. I got stopped
coming home from a club.

283
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,658
Damn, that's pretty stupid.

284
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,037
Yeah. Didn't seem stupid
at the time.

285
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,290
Then again, I was wasted.

286
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:37,377
I don't know, man.
Just don't play me, OK?

287
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,379
I won't play you.

288
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,839
I don't want to be played.

289
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,675
OK. I won't.
I'm not going to play you.

290
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,011
OK?

291
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,930
I promise.

292
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,233
Aw, come on!

293
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,110
You're supposed to drop back
into coverage, Lucky!

294
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,321
And don't give him
a free release on the inside!

295
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,240
Nunez, where the hell
you been?

296
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,242
-Detention, sir.
-Detention?

297
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,577
You pay me back
after practice.

298
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,788
You give me an hour
in that weight room.

299
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,456
Let's go!
On the ball!

300
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,001
All right, man,
I'm outta here, bro.

301
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,629
We're not supposed
to leave until 6:30.

302
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:24,299
Dude, there's no one here.
We can leave whenever.

303
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,929
Aw, you're a trip, Nunez.

304
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,180
See you later, homey.

305
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:34,977
Damn.

308
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,496
Missed the bus.

311
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,004
Detencion.

312
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,631
It's no big deal, Mom.

314
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,511
All right. I got it.

315
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,013
No. I got it.

317
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,891
OK. Let me just talk
to my girl...

318
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,143
and I'll call you right back.

319
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,228
OK. Bye.

320
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,689
Uhh!
OK, here's the plan.

321
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,150
Derek knows this party
in the Colony...

322
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,776
but he's not exactly invited.

323
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,737
But he thinks that if
he hooks up with us...

324
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,489
whoa--that we can
for sure get in...

325
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:32,326
because we're just
so irresistible.

326
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,786
You know,
there's a football game.

327
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:35,954
A what?

328
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,832
A football game.

329
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,959
I heard you.
The Pacific game?

330
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,003
-Yeah.
-Football?

331
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,464
What? It'll be fun
for a goof. Come on.

332
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,216
Oh, my God.
You're so obvious.

333
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,342
What?

334
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,553
-What?
-What?

335
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,389
What am I obvious about?

336
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,017
-Slut.
-Shut up.

337
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,192

Can I have two, please?

338
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:08,362
Two.
Two, two, two..

339
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,989
We did not wear our blue.

340
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,909
Oh, shit.
I forgot to wear anything.

342
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,455
Offense, offense!
Here we go!

343
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:21,708
Oh! My bad.

345
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,047
Boom, boom !

346
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,049
CHEERLEADERS:
Boom, boom, what up?

347
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,801
Boom, boom, what up?

349
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,769
Let's go. Let's go.

350
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,563
1, 2, 3, go!

351
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:47,234
MAN ONP.A.: Nunez,
number32, on the field.

352
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,069
Nunez with the ball.

353
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,283
Unh!

354
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,164
Whoo!

355
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,875
Whoo!

356
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,633
MAN ONP.A.:
Number32, Carlos Nunez,

357
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,802
with the reception.

358
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,304
Come on!

359
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,765
Hell, yeah!

362
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,272
Whoo! Yes!

363
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,901
If you tell anybody
I just did that...

364
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,986
I'm going to kill you.

365
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,655
-I will.
-OK.

366
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,450
Oh, yes!
We did it, baby!

367
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,035
Nice seein'you, now.

369
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:44,541
Way to go, Nunez.
You got a lot of heart, baby.

370
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,422
That's meat, baby.
You know it.

371
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,798
And you know it.

372
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,592
Yes!

373
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,052
You need
a ride to Carmen's, bro?

374
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,345
What's happening at Carmen's?

375
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,430
Hey, free cerveza,
free food.

376
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:01,391
Maybe some other free stuff,
you know what I'm saying?

377
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:04,436
You faked
that guy out so bad...

378
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,854
when he hit the ground,
I could've swore...

379
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,148
he sittin' on himself.

380
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,984
Hey, he didn't see nothing
but your ass cheeks, man.

381
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,653
Good game, you guys,
all right?

382
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:13,987
Hey, all right, Coach.

383
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,531
Try to stay
out of trouble.

384
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,241
Hey, stay out
of the strip club, man.

386
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,787
Man, you like that,
don't you?

387
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,038
Come here, hot stuff!

389
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:26,875
Hey, say hello
to your wife, Coach.

390
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:27,876
I'll see you guys later.

391
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,378
Hey, where are you
going, man?

392
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:30,921
I'll see you guys later.

393
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:33,006
You ain't hanging out with us?
What's up?

394
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,341
Hell, man,
we just won the game.

395
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:37,094
See you later.

396
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,012
Oh, you got to be
kidding me.

398
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,727
Hi.

399
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,312
You guys come to get me
in trouble again?

400
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:51,233
Uh, no.
We're off-duty.

401
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,860
We're not troublemakers.
We're innocent.

402
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,236
-Yeah.
-Look at our faces.

403
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,738
Don't we look innocent
together?

404
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,283
So, what'd you think
of the game?

405
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,160
What game?

406
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,622
It's going to be like that, huh?

407
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,208
So, what are you
doing tonight?

408
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,252
I got to catch the bus.
I got work tomorrow.

409
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,796
-Aww.
-That sucks.

410
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,673
Hey, we can take you home.

411
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,675
-It's far.
-Come on.

412
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,886
We'll take you wherever
you want to go.

415
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,938
Carlos,
which way am I going?

416
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,939
Just grab the 10.

417
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,274
-What?
-The 10.

418
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,611
-10 what?
-10 freeway!

419
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,779
Know when I'm rollin',
the trick is to keep it goin'

420
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,240
Flowin' over nobody,
not knowin'my head swollen

421
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,201
Who can control it, if you
try to say it's heart broken

422
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,077
Lookin'for me, and I swear
it's in a careless motion

423
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,746
All the way down
by the pound

424
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:46,955
The shit you read about,
a nice, round figure

425
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,957
Anyone can figure out

426
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,959
And everything's for nothing
if you're willing to try

427
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:55,088
You got to make it,
you got to try to stay high

428
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,799
'Cause everybody
is in on something else

429
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:01,803
You gotta, you gotta find out
who and what it is

432
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,531
God, dude,
could you live any further?

433
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,990
I told you it was far.

434
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,283
You wanted to take me.
Damn.

435
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,202
Maddy's never been
east of La Brea.

436
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:26,662
Shut up, dude.
You think you're down...

437
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:30,123
because you scored weed
in Pico Union one time?

438
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,750
I'm telling you,
it was twice.

439
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:32,751
One time.

440
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,795
Two times, bitch.

441
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,630
Two times.

442
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:40,634
-Are you OK?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

444
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,431
I didn't say
you could touch that.

445
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:47,850
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

446
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,393
Well, what can I touch?

447
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:51,520
What can you touch?

448
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:55,315
-Oh, come on, Carlos.
-Whoa, slow down.

449
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,984
-Why?
-Chill, girl.

450
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:57,985
Hey, you guys.

451
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,319
Damn,
that feels good, but...

452
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,445
But what?

453
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,446
You guys!

454
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,824
-I like you.
-I like you, too.

455
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,284
You guys.
Are you guys hungry?

456
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,202
Because I'm starving.

457
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,663
There's a place
right up the street.

458
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:10,873
Oh, yeah?

459
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:12,374
There's a place
right up the street.

461
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,544
Keep going.
it's to the right.

462
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,087
Don't crash.

463
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:18,172
Watch it!

465
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:23,552
-Whoo!
-Hey!

467
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:25,929
You guys all right?

468
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,515
I don't know, man.
She's on drugs.

469
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:29,725
Ow!

470
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,227
Ow, I hurt.

471
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,228
Love me, I hurt.

472
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,563
Baby.

473
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,523
Will you pick me up?
Pick me up.

474
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:37,774
I want to be carried.

475
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,651
I'll carry her
to the Taco Shack.

477
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:42,988
Don't mind her.

478
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,281

Oh, this is so cool.

479
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,074
Oh, my God,
I love this place.

480
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,035
-Put me down.
-All right.

481
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:52,831
Whoo!

482
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,666
Whoo! Whoo!

483
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,210
Aw! Ow!

485
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:14,436
Whoo!

486
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,189
Whenever you're ready, guys.

487
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,399
Come on, Carlos. Come on.

488
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,692
You want to dance with me?

489
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,486
I'm not much of a dancer.

491
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,907
Yeah, daddy.

492
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:30,702
WODamn, girl.

493
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,165
You guys are crazy.

494
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:38,085
Oh, man.

495
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:42,256
WOWhoo!

496
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,134
How did l
get involved in this?

497
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,428
Oh, yeah!

498
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,013
Gracias.

499
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:53,642
All right. Excuse me.

500
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:54,726
May I help you?

501
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,728
-Tacos.
-You want a taco?

502
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,064
Burritos. Tacos. Tacos.

503
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,983
All right,
we'll take six tacos.

504
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,402
-No. Spanish.
-She speaks English.

505
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,821
Espanol, por favor.

507
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:10,325
You like that?

509
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,041
Spanish is hot.

510
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,294
Ohh.

511
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,087
And to drink?

512
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,881
Mmm.

513
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,049
This is, like,
the best food I've ever had.

514
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,677
I know. Thank you.

515
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,805
OK, where do I go pee at?
Whoa.

516
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:34,600
Hey, you know what?
You're shit out of luck.

517
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,101
Shut up.

518
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,227
There ain't no bathrooms
around here.

519
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,271
Fine. I'll just
pop a squat somewhere.

520
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:40,856
There's
no bathrooms around here.

521
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:43,317
Please come with me.
Come with me.

522
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,318
Are you serious?

523
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,360
Yes.
I have to go so bad.

524
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,154
You're going to pop a squat?

525
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:48,655
-Where?
-Anywhere.

526
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:56,163
All right,
just go down there.

527
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:59,333
No way.
This is, like, Rapes Are Us.

528
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,709
No, it's not.
Just go down there.

529
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:03,670
-You're coming with me.
-Look, it's dark.

530
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:05,422
All right.
We're going.

531
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,226
This sucks.

532
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,894
Don't look.

534
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:27,027

Oh...oh, my God.

535
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:30,864
I really want
to kiss you right now.

536
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:34,034
I really
want to kiss you, too.

537
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:37,788
When the time is right.

538
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:41,625
So you just let me know
when the time is right.

539
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:42,835
OK.

540
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,019
Oh!

541
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:05,816
You guys, I'm all done.

542
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:09,820
Drip-dry. Unh.

543
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:12,698

Oh, get a hotel room.

545
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,909
Oh.

546
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:20,914
Man...

549
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:30,007
Is that 'Los?

550
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:31,466
Yeah, that's
your brother, man.

551
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,677

Sorry. Hey, guys.

552
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,762
BOY:
Hey, that's the trash girl.

553
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,014
That's right, baby.

554
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,184
Ah ha. Trash girl.

555
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,603
-What's up?
-What's up, man?

556
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,605
-What's going on?
-Just getting a ride home.

557
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:45,981
So who's this, homes?

558
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,482
I'm Nicole.

559
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,484
-How you doing, Nicole?
-Good.

560
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,486
Hi, I'm Maddy.
Nice to meet you.

561
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,280
Nice to meet you, Maddy.

562
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:55,157
So, where'd he find you guys?

563
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:58,243
You get assigned a white girl
when you go to Pacific.

564
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,703
How generous.

565
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:02,206
And Carlos is so cute
he got two.

566
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:06,210
How generous.
How can a brother be down?

567
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:09,046
Looks run in the family, mija.
What's up with my brother?

568
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,924
You got to go to Pacific.

570
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,054
-Good luck, homes.
-Hi, Mom.

571
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:21,058
This is Nicole and Maddy.

572
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,477
-Hi.
-Hi.

575
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,493
Hmm.

576
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,704
Sorry about that.
She's kind of pissed.

577
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,874
It's OK.
I'll see you at school.

578
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,125

Let's get out of here.

579
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,253
-Thanks for the ride.
-Sure.

580
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:51,922
-Good-bye.
-Bye.

582
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:56,176
Get your ass inside.
Hurry up.

583
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:57,678
Moms is calling you.

584
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,180
Now where the hell's
the freeway?

585
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,059
Bye.

588
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:13,110
Just friends.

590
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,198
I mean, everybody
drinks but me, Mom.

592
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,955
Come on, Mom.
That's not going to happen.

593
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:28,208
I'm not going to die.
I'm not going to jail.

596
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,128
There's some
very interesting rumors...

597
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,671
going around
about Friday night.

598
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:16,173
Oh, really?

599
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:19,259
I heard the word "furpile"
more than once.

600
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:20,886
I did nothing
to discourage these rumors.

601
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:23,347
Ow! Watch where you're going,
stupid bitch.

602
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:24,473
What's your problem?

603
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:25,807
You're my problem.

604
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:26,850
Hey, it's all good.
She didn't mean to--

605
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:29,853
Stay out of it.
What are you looking at?

606
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:30,854
-Nothing.
-You better not.

607
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:34,066
-Sorry.
-Yeah, you better be.

609
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:41,031
Looks like the home girls
aren't down with you.

610
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,432
-Hey!
-Hey.

611
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:08,892
What are you doing here?

612
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:09,893
Looking for you.

613
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:10,894
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

614
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:12,521
Maddy told me
you were in here.

615
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,398
Oh, she did, did she?

616
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,401
Am I not allowed?

617
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,903
Sorry about the other night.
I was a little wasted.

618
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:21,905
Yes, you were.

619
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:23,365
Ho ho ho.

620
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:27,035
So, what happened?

621
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:29,162
You don't remember?

622
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:30,706
Kind of.

623
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,545
it's not done yet.

624
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,505
You cut his head off.

625
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,591
Hey, in here, I'm in charge.

626
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:42,092
Your world?

627
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:44,178
Yeah.

628
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:49,349
You take it to a lab,
they just do the obvious.

629
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,518
I like to play with it--

630
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,562
cut out what I don't like...

631
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:57,191
distort...magnify.

632
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:59,359
Playing God, huh?

633
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,195
Just playing.

634
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:03,822
So, can I see some more?

635
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,575
If you want.

636
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:28,305
Hey, kids,
what's going on in here?

637
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:30,557
This is not a make-out room.
Come on.

638
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:33,185
I'll see you later.

639
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,664
MAN SINGING:A sunrise
over a dusty hill full of

640
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:56,667
Full of wallflowers

641
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:02,381
And I think to myself

642
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,050
I am the same

643
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:10,264
I met my baby
by the station

644
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:12,099
And she said

645
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,603
Can I help you
with some information?

646
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:19,106
'Cause your train gets out
at a quarter to 5:00

647
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,649
But you hang a while

648
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:23,735
And you and I
can get funky

649
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:26,029
To the rhythm
of the choo-choo train

650
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:27,698
Dancin '
in the pourin'rain

651
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,283
I found myself

652
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:33,036
In the most beautiful
situation

653
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:38,208
A feeling
I can't describe

654
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,794
Ooh,
how she gave me love

655
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:43,005
Oh, how she gave me love

656
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,424
Oh, how she gave me love

657
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,552
-Rosa, this is Carlos.
-Hi.

658
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:51,513
I said,
oh, how she gave me love

659
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:54,391
Oh, how she gave me love

660
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:57,895
Oh, how she gave me love

662
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:07,321
What?

663
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,156
Aren't you
going to lock the door?

664
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,326
No.

665
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:45,692
I don't have any...

666
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,194
It's OK.

667
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:51,156
It's not OK.

668
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:58,956
Don't move.

669
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:12,845
-Hey, Rosa.
-Hi.

670
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,561
-Bye, Rosa.
-Bye.

671
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,962
-Oh, shit.
-What? What's wrong?

672
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:49,464
-Who's that?
-What?

673
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:53,468
-That guy right there.
-My dad.

674
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,096
-It's OK.
-He's right there.

675
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:58,640
He doesn't care.
I can do anything.

676
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:02,019
I've got a condom.
He'd be so proud.

677
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,020
I'm serious.

678
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,479
He'd be thrilled
I'm sleeping with you.

679
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:07,107
A person of color
in his daughter's bed.

681
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,402
Man, you're crazy.

682
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:11,904
You're beautiful.

683
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:17,367
OK.

684
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:20,579
But can I do one more thing?

685
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:22,789
What?

686
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:26,001
I want to kiss you
one more time.

688
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:37,179
Where are you?

689
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:39,681
Hi, there.

690
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:41,725
Who's the princess
on the floor, huh?

691
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:44,061
Nicole, please
do not park your car...

692
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,855
in the motor court
because it drips oil everywhere.

693
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:48,273
We just came
from a dance show--

694
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:50,359
-Dance recital.
-You look pretty.

695
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,694
So...

696
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,947
Oh, be careful.

697
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:58,617
You're going to mess up
the costume.

698
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:01,745
I really want to keep
this dress neat.

699
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:03,830
MORGAN: Mommy.

700
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:06,959
Thank you.

701
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,669
Hi, there. Tom Oakley.

702
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,462
Carlos Nunez. Hi.

703
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:12,089
How are you?
You're Rosa's nephew?

704
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,050
No, Dad. Carlos and l
go to school together.

705
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,052
Oh, you're a senior, too.

706
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:19,054
Yes, sir.
Just finishing up.

707
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,180
That's wonderful.

708
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:22,850
Do you have any plans
for next year?

709
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,643
Dad, don't interrogate him.

710
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:25,811
I'm not interrogating him.

711
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:26,937
That's OK.

712
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:29,189
I'm applying
to the Naval Academy.

713
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:30,691
Annapolis?

714
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:32,526
That's impressive.
That's a tough school.

715
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:34,820
Yes, sir.
I want to be a pilot.

716
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:36,321
A pilot?

717
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:38,532
The Naval fliers are supposed
to be the best in the world.

718
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:40,534
Well, you'll get
a great education there...

719
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,703
no matter what
you decide to do.

720
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:44,371
Good to see
someone with a plan.

722
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:48,542
So, who's sponsoring you?

723
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:50,711
Well, I've written
to Roy Ball--

724
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:52,045
Oh, yeah? Lucy?

725
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,381
Yeah, but
she hasn't responded yet.

726
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:55,591
Yeah, well,
she's still tied up...

727
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:57,467
with that INS fiasco...

728
00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:01,555
and she probably won't get to it
before Thanksgiving.

729
00:37:01,597 --> 00:37:04,433
So, why didn't you
write to me?

730
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:05,934
Tom Oakley.

731
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:09,229
Oakley? Right.

732
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:11,899
I mean,
she didn't even tell me.

733
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,942
Nicole didn't tell you
I was a congressman?

734
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:15,903
Nicole didn't think
it was relevant.

735
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,865
Actually,
I think I did write to you.

736
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:21,658
Oh? What'd I say?

737
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:24,912
No word yet, sir.

738
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:26,330
Well, I'm sorry about that.

739
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:28,540
Maria probably hasn't gotten
to my stack yet, either.

740
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:31,668
Tom? Morgan wants
to eat with her daddy.

741
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,962
-Can you hurry?
-OK.

742
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:36,340
Here. Why don't you
call the office...

743
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:37,799
and we'll set up a meeting?

744
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,676
You can come in,
tell me all about yourself...

745
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,470
and I'll see what I do.

746
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:43,388
Thank you, sir.

747
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,599
Say, why don't you two
stay for dinner?

748
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:49,978
Rosa's cooking up her famous
stuffed chile rellenos.

749
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,730
"Rellenos" means "stuffed."

750
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:54,066
Thank you, Nicole.

751
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:56,318
And we can't stay.

752
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,946
Perhaps another time, then.

753
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:00,322
Glad to meet you, Carlos.

754
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:01,865
Nice to meet you, too, sir.

755
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,575
Take care.

756
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:05,911
God, I hate when he pulls that.

757
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:07,412
Pulls what?

758
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:09,873
That act. "Oh, I used
to march with Cesar Chavez."

759
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:11,250
"Oh, I'm every poor man's
best friend."

760
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,335
-It's so fake.
-He seemed cool.

761
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:15,379
"Stay for dinner.
We're having chile rellenos."

762
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,631
"Did I show you
my electric car?"

763
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:19,466
And what about you?
"Yes, sir. No, sir."

764
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:20,676
What is that?

765
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:21,927
You don't have to do that
around him.

766
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,262
I was raised to do that.

767
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:24,513
It's not some act.

768
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:27,349
Fine.

769
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:29,142
Why didn't you tell me
who your father was?

770
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:33,188
I don't go around advertising
my father's profession.

771
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,023
I didn't think it mattered.

772
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:37,025
-It does matter.
-Why?

773
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:39,278
Do you know how hard it is
to get these guys...

774
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,154
to sit down
and read your letter?

775
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,991
Or pick you out of a hundred
guys exactly like you?

776
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:48,495
Well, mission accomplished.

777
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:49,663
You got your meeting...

778
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:51,915
and you didn't even
have to sleep with me.

779
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:53,876
Lucky you.

780
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,714
I'm sorry.

781
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:00,215
I just...

782
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:02,718
that was just weird.

783
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:05,846
I'm sorry
we were interrupted.

784
00:39:05,888 --> 00:39:07,181
Another time?

785
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:09,808
Hmm. If you're lucky.

787
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,855
So, Pilot Nunez, huh?

788
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:16,732
Well, we'll see.

789
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:17,733
What do you mean?

790
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:19,651
I've never even been in one.

791
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:21,320
In what?

792
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,780
A plane.

793
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,115
You're joking.

794
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:26,325
You've never been
in a plane before?

795
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:27,784
No.

796
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:30,871
Oh, my God. That's cute.

797
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:33,290
-Cute.
-It is.

798
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:37,211
I had a good time today.

799
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:38,712
Me, too.

800
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:46,887
So, any ways,
Brian's been AWOL...

801
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:49,306
for, like, four days.

802
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:50,307
He hasn't called.

803
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,268
He totally changed
his cell phone.

804
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,062
What are you
going to do if he calls?

805
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:56,647
I don't know.

806
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,732
What would Jesus do?

808
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:03,737
Seriously. Remember when
I went code blue on that EPT...

809
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:07,074
and he freaked out because
he thought I'd tell his wife?

810
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:09,826
Like, that guy
so can't handle pressure.

811
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,579
-I'm sure he's just--
-Carlos.

812
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:18,585
Leave your best friend right
when she's baring her soul.

813
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:20,462
Hey.

814
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:21,505
Hey.

815
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:23,507
-How's it going?
-Good.

816
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:25,050
You busy Saturday?

817
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:27,886
Yeah. I've got to work
in my uncle's shop.

818
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:30,597
Too bad.

819
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,099
What?

820
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,684
I just thought we could
have some fun together.

821
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,602
Oh, man, I don't know.

822
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:39,523
Come on.
My dad's not invited, Carlos.

823
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:40,774
Just you and me.

824
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:44,361
I don't know.
It's just my uncle needed me.

825
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:47,239
Yeah. I promise, promise,
promise you...

826
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:49,199
a very satisfying experience.

827
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:51,493
You won't be disappointed.

828
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:55,122
Mmm, OK.

829
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:57,332
I got you.

830
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,377
-No peeking.
-I'm not.

832
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,589
Hold on.

833
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,966
OK, now you can look.

834
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:08,886
Whoa.

835
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:11,305
Want to join the Mile-High Club?

836
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:12,931
What?

837
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,474
I'm kidding.

838
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,565
Whoo!

839
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:22,733
Here we go.

840
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:24,693
Aah!

842
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,370
We stand

843
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,664
To lose

844
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:42,419
Every color from the sky

845
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:44,588
Then crawl

846
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,465
As a child

847
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:48,509
So, can I take over?

848
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,135
Sure.
Go ahead. It's yours.

849
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:51,929
Oh, God,
you're letting him take over?

850
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,889
Ohh.

851
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:56,725
There's no longer shine

852
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:59,061
On this bird of prey

853
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:00,437
You're doing great.

854
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,523
He's going
in the Naval Academy.

855
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:04,233
-All right.
-Maybe.

856
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:05,442
I haven't been accepted yet.

857
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:06,777
How many hours have you logged?

858
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:08,737
-None.
-None?

859
00:42:08,737 --> 00:42:09,863
He's a natural.

860
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:11,240
You mean in an actual plane?

861
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:12,783
In a real plane.
How many hours you got?

862
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:14,284
None.

863
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:16,203
I have a flight simulator
at school.

864
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:17,538
Oh, a flight simulator.
Like a chair pilot.

865
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:18,580
Pretty much.

866
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,623
Yeah, all right.

867
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:20,624
Can I do a Lazy 8?

868
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,334
It's your airplane.
Go ahead.

869
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:23,919
What's a Lazy 8?

870
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:25,212
PILOT:
Start it to the right.

871
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:27,214
Oh, my God!

872
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:29,508
Oh!

873
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,635
Ha ha ha!

874
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:33,512
Go ahead. Turn it
back to the left a little.

875
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,224
I can say
you're doing a good job.

876
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:38,225
I'm loving it.

877
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:39,560
Look at me.

878
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:41,353
I'm busy. Wait.

879
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:42,729
Whoo!

880
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:44,398
Oh, my God.
I can see my house.

881
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:45,899
-Where?
-Do you see it?

882
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:47,067
Right there.

883
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:48,193
Want me to drop you off?

885
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:52,322
Thank you.

886
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:57,953
PILOT:And back around
to the left.

887
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:12,759
It's a disease
of the week benefit.

888
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:14,887
They have to stay
until he's shaken the hand...

889
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:16,763
of every person in the room.

890
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:18,932
We got until
at least midnight.

891
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:21,310
We is all alone.

892
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:27,149
What'd you do?

893
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:29,109
Made it Carlos friendly.

894
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,446
WOMAN I want to believe in

895
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:39,745
I want to believe in us

896
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:47,002
When everything is wrong

897
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:56,512
Will you come through?

898
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:00,474
Come through

899
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:03,310
Not what I thought
it'd be like.

900
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:05,103
No?

901
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:06,104
Mm-mmm.

902
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:08,482
But you thought about it?

903
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:11,360
Yeah.

905
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,865
Look how good our skin looks
next to each other.

906
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:20,994
It's beautiful.

907
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,582
Hmm.

908
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,838
Who's that?

909
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:35,217
Oh. My mom.

910
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:38,387
She lives in Virginia.

911
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:40,389
She's married
to some dermatologist...

912
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,392
and the guy's home
at 6:00 every night.

913
00:44:43,392 --> 00:44:44,601
it's a big plus for my mom.

914
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:46,353
When she was married
to my dad...

915
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:49,398
he was always running around
trying to save the world.

916
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:51,942
No time for his family.

917
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:55,696
She left when I was 12.

918
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:57,990
But it's good for my dad,
he got to marry Courtney...

919
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:02,160
and she's flush with cash
from her first marriage.

920
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:05,664
My dad left when I was five.

921
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:10,169
He couldn't hack it here,
so he went back to Mexico.

922
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,714
I don't even have
pictures of him.

923
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:19,845
You mad at him?

924
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,684
I hardly even think about him.

925
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:29,354
I got plenty of parent
in my mom.

926
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:40,365
I got to go.

927
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,743
No, you don't.
You got to stay.

928
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:44,620
No. My mother's going
to kill me if I'm late.

929
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,914
Tell her you're staying
at a friend's house.

930
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:47,915
What friend?

931
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:50,542
I don't care. Make one up.

933
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:56,215
I'm not letting you leave.

934
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:58,425
MAN When you hold me

935
00:45:58,467 --> 00:46:00,302
Like you do

936
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:02,763
it feels so right

937
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:04,765
Drawn out

938
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:07,059
I start to forget

939
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:11,522
How my heart gets torn

940
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:16,109
When that hurt gets thrown

941
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:21,323
Feelin'like I can't go on

942
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:27,329
Turnin'in circles

943
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:29,289
Time and again

944
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:30,958
Where are you going?

945
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,334
I got to go.

946
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:34,503
No. Stay. I'll drive you.

947
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:36,004
Shh.

948
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:38,715
Got to know

949
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:40,259
For sure

950
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:44,805
'Cause
it takes something

951
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:46,640
More this time

952
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:49,017
Than sweet, sweet lies

953
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:51,311
Drawn out

954
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:55,524
Before I open up my arms

955
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:57,651
And fall

956
00:46:57,693 --> 00:47:02,114
Losin'all control

957
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:06,910
Every dream inside my soul

958
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,377
This year's lovin'

959
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:18,005
it'll last

960
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:24,219
'Cause who's to worry

961
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:28,307
if our hearts get torn

962
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:32,811
When that hurt gets thrown

963
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:37,357
Don't you know
this life goes on?

964
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:39,610
Won't you kiss me

965
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:43,697
On that midnight sleep?

966
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:47,910
Sweep me off my feet

967
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:53,290
Singin'ain't this life
so sweet

968
00:47:57,336 --> 00:47:59,463
This year's lovin'

969
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:02,382
it'll last

970
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:07,971
This year's lovin'

971
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:10,057
it'll last

972
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:16,605
This year's lovin'

973
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:18,899
it'll last

974
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:25,531
This year's lovin'

975
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:27,950
it'll last

976
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,121
This year's lovin'

977
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:35,666
it'll last

978
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:40,128
Whoa, ah, yeah

979
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:42,840
This year's lovin'

980
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:46,218
it'll last

982
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:49,721
I can't believe
I just did that.

983
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,098
Ah.

984
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:53,433
What am I doing with you?

985
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:55,561
I don't know.

986
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:59,064
What are you doing with me?

987
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:00,858
It's just a question.

989
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:05,279
Look what you just
got me to do.

990
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,322
Ha ha!
I don't know, man.

991
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:12,202
When I'm with you, I never know
what's going to happen.

992
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:16,164
It's weird because my life
is so planned out, you know?

993
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:17,541
I don't know.

994
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:20,627
It's like you don't care
what people think...

995
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:21,795
and when I'm with you...

996
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:25,424
you kind of make me
not care what people think.

997
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:26,425
You know what I'm saying?

998
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:29,136
I know what you're saying.

999
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:30,721
I don't know.

1000
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:34,433
And that dimple--

1001
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:36,643
I love that dimple.

1002
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:39,146
-I grew it myself.
-You did?

1004
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,441
What does he need?

1005
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:48,530
What does he need?

1006
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:53,869
What does he need?

1008
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:56,413
Remember us?

1009
00:49:56,455 --> 00:49:58,498
-What's up, fool?
-What's up?

1011
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:02,836
What does he need?

1012
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,882
Mmm. Damn.

1013
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:07,966
That's the shape.

1014
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:11,637
Uh-huh.
That's my wife.

1015
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:13,096
She could be my mommy
any day.

1016
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:15,140
She could spank me...

1017
00:50:16,183 --> 00:50:17,684
Ooh.

1018
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:19,019
That's what
I'm talking about.

1019
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:20,521
Hey, what's up?

1020
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:23,065
She got more
bounce to the ounce.

1021
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:25,359
Hey, guys,
just chill, all right?

1022
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,945
Chill, dawg. Chill.

1024
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:31,990
Chill, dawg.
Man, there's people around.

1025
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:34,618
What, we ain't West side
enough for you?

1026
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,246
-You want us to whiten up?
-Kick back.

1027
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:38,413
Look at this fool.

1028
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:40,916
He's all about
the white girl now.

1029
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:42,417
I worry about this fella.

1030
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:43,710
I put this fella
on his ass on Friday.

1032
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:46,964
You playing defense
now or what?

1033
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:48,549
I'm going both ways.
I'll make you eat dirt.

1034
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:51,093
That's what I'm going to do.

1035
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:53,262
DAVIS: Hey, Carlos, man,
what's up, bro?

1036
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:54,346
What's up, guys?

1037
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:55,639
These your homeys?

1039
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:58,684
Homeys?

1041
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:01,478
Yo, what's so funny, G?

1042
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,022
I ain't your G, man.

1043
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:05,607
DAVIS: Yo, what's up
with the attitude, bro?

1044
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:07,150
What's with what?

1045
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:09,403
Dude, you need to chill, bro.

1046
00:51:09,444 --> 00:51:12,447
I'm not some banger
lookin' to throw down.

1047
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:14,616
Then sit the fuck down, bitch.

1048
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:16,243
Hey, guys, chill.

1049
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:18,203
Whoa.
This isn't brown town, bro.

1050
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:19,788
Hey, guys,
just chill, man.

1051
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:20,914
I'll call INS on your ass.

1052
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:22,791
Hey, guys, kick back.

1053
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,084
Oh, man.

1055
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:27,045
Get off.

1056
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,631
Get off me, man.
I want to kick this guy's ass.

1058
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:31,967
I'm going to kill you!

1059
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:33,302
Are you going
to clean this mess up...

1060
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:34,887
or is your dad
going to come do it?

1061
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:36,680
Hey, go home!

1062
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:39,516
Leave, buddy!
Go back to Burritoville!

1066
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:57,951
Not right now, Mom.

1067
00:51:57,993 --> 00:51:59,077
Just leave me alone,
all right?

1069
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:02,581
I'm sick of you
always on my ass!

1070
00:52:03,665 --> 00:52:06,335
I don't need any more
sacrifices from you, OK?

1071
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:08,128
Just worry about
your own goddamn life.

1072
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,171
-'Los!
-What?

1073
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:10,672
Don't disrespect Moms
like that, fool.

1074
00:52:10,672 --> 00:52:12,341
Are you going to tell me
how to talk?

1075
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:16,887
You know what?
Mom. Por favor.

1076
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:18,138
Let me tell you
something, homes.

1077
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,973
She busts her ass
every day at a shit job...

1078
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:22,643
for you, not for me.
Every day!

1079
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:24,811
You owe it to her to make
something of yourself.

1080
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:27,231
What, because you didn't?
Huh?

1081
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:28,774
MRS. NUNEZ:
Carlos. Hector.

1083
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:33,946
Yeah. You're right.
You got it.

1084
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:35,989
Let me tell you
something, 'Los.

1085
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:37,241
I'm not like you, fool.

1086
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:40,494
I'm not as smart as you.
I'm not as fast as you.

1087
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:42,663
You got something
that I never had--

1088
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:45,457
the opportunity to be
whatever the hell you want.

1089
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:46,834
You can be a pilot.

1090
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:50,337
You can be a congressman.
Whatever you want.

1091
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:53,674
And for you to just throw that
away for that white girl...

1092
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:55,717
that's nothing but...

1093
00:52:55,717 --> 00:52:57,094
and I'm not going
to sit around...

1094
00:52:57,135 --> 00:52:58,262
and let you do that shit
to yourself...

1095
00:52:58,303 --> 00:53:01,098
or to Moms anymore,
you understand?

1096
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:04,893
Look at me, ese.

1098
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,907
Nicole.

1099
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:21,493
NICOLE. Look up.

1100
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:23,912
What?

1101
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:25,956
We got to go.

1102
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:33,338
Shit.

1103
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,507
What?

1104
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,050
What's the date today?

1105
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:38,177
Today?

1106
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:40,846
-Is today the 17th?
-I don't know.

1107
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:42,556
-Shit!
-What?

1108
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:46,101
The meeting with your father--
I completely forgot about it.

1109
00:53:46,143 --> 00:53:47,394
Don't worry.
You can reschedule it.

1110
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:48,395
I shouldn't have
gone to the beach.

1111
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:51,690
-Don't worry. It's OK.
-No, it's not.

1112
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:58,030
Damn. I can't believe
I missed it.

1115
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,704
I'll see you later.

1116
00:54:05,746 --> 00:54:07,915
-You don't want me to come in?
-It's going to be boring.

1117
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:11,418
It's just family
and cake and stuff.

1118
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,961
Oh.

1119
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:16,715
All right.

1120
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:19,510
No, that's OK.
You don't want me to.

1121
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:23,263
Just hurry up.
We're late.

1122
00:54:24,473 --> 00:54:25,432
I wish I would've known--

1123
00:54:25,474 --> 00:54:27,309
Come on!

1126
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:41,323
Hey, that's OK.

1127
00:54:41,323 --> 00:54:42,824
And a "Cheese."

1129
00:54:44,826 --> 00:54:46,745
Come here, fool.

1130
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:48,789
Where you been, man?
It's my sister's birthday party.

1131
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:49,998
Lost track of time, dawg.

1132
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,166
Carlos...

1134
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:55,420
I lost track of time, Mom.

1135
00:54:57,214 --> 00:54:58,799
You remember Nicole, right?

1136
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:01,802
Hi.

1137
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:05,973
Ooh!

1138
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:08,475
Shut up.

1139
00:55:08,517 --> 00:55:09,685
I'll be back in a minute.

1140
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:11,895
God damn.

1141
00:55:11,937 --> 00:55:13,438
You're a fool, you know?

1143
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:27,828
-Hi. Happy birthday.
-Hi.

1144
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,496
Thank you.

1145
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:33,458
Perfecto.

1146
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,169
Can I help with anything?

1147
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:38,380
No, it's OK.

1150
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,150
Oh.

1153
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:10,996
One second.

1155
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:35,729
LUZ: Ahh.
You know I like it buff.

1157
00:56:37,523 --> 00:56:41,401
LUZ: Yeah.
You know you miss me.

1158
00:56:41,443 --> 00:56:42,444
What?

1159
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:43,946
Hey.

1160
00:56:43,946 --> 00:56:46,073
Oh. Hey.

1161
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:49,076
-Where'd you go?
-I went to change.

1162
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:51,537
Oh.
Thanks for telling me.

1163
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:54,706
Sorry.
Luz, this is Nicole.

1164
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:55,707
Nicole, Luz.

1165
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:56,875
-Hi.
-Hey.

1166
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:58,210
I like your dress.

1167
00:56:58,252 --> 00:57:01,922
Thanks. So, you guys
go to school together?

1168
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:04,258
Yeah.
We go to P.H. together.

1169
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:06,552
LUZ: Oh. That's nice.

1170
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:10,430
And you share
the same class or what?

1171
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:12,015
No.

1172
00:57:12,057 --> 00:57:14,643
No.

1173
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:18,897
LUZ: Yeah.
Let's go say hi to my mom.

1174
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:20,858
All right. Come on.

1175
00:57:20,899 --> 00:57:22,818
I'm hot. I'm gonna go
outside for a second.

1176
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,903
-Come on.
-It's OK.

1183
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:04,067
What?!

1184
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:06,361
OK. Hold on.

1185
00:58:06,403 --> 00:58:08,322
Yo, 'Los, it's for you, man.

1186
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:17,539
Hello?

1187
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:19,374
Where'd you go?

1190
00:58:39,436 --> 00:58:42,231
What happened?
Why'd you leave?

1191
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:45,609
I'm so stupid.

1192
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:47,402
I don't know what
I was thinking coming there.

1193
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:49,404
I'm sorry.

1194
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:51,823
I should have told you
it was gonna be like that.

1195
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:53,075
That it was so formal.

1196
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:54,743
No. It wasn't that.

1197
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:59,164
Just seeing you with
your family and friends...

1198
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:00,749
and with that girl.

1199
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,543
She's just a friend.

1200
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:04,253
I don't care.

1201
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:06,255
You should be able to do
whatever you want.

1202
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:08,048
I do what I want to do.

1203
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,509
Oh, God.

1204
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:13,178
Look at me, I'm pathetic!

1205
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,388
I hate myself.

1206
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:15,889
What are you talking about?

1207
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:18,767
What?

1209
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:28,277
It's just...

1211
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,531
What?

1212
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:35,576
What?

1213
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:38,245
I just...

1214
00:59:40,122 --> 00:59:42,708
I think I'm in love with you.

1215
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:49,840
I'm sorry.

1216
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:54,595
Now I've weirded you out.
I'm sorry.

1217
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,889
No. l--

1218
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,558
Don't say anything.
It's OK.

1219
01:00:01,476 --> 01:00:03,061
It's OK.

1220
01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:11,195
MARIA:
That's correct, sir.

1221
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:14,281
He's leaving for
Washington, D.C. in five days.

1222
01:00:14,323 --> 01:00:15,908
Mm-hmm.

1223
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:18,952
Uh, well...

1224
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:22,331
No, he really doesn't have
any other appointments.

1225
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:24,458
I would stick with
that one. Mm-hmm.

1226
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:26,627
Certainly, sir. Take care.

1227
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:29,087
Yes.

1228
01:00:29,129 --> 01:00:32,799
Yes, he is.

1229
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:36,637
Mr. Nunez?
He's ready for you.

1230
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:43,393
Yeah.
I have it right here.

1231
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:45,103
I think. What is it?
A kid...

1232
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:48,815
for Gloria, right?

1233
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:50,901
Well, we start
with the Bienvenidos...

1234
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:54,821
and then the Red Cross thing.

1235
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:56,156
Right?

1236
01:00:56,198 --> 01:00:58,992
And then--You know, hon?

1237
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:01,328
I have a meeting
I need to start right now.

1238
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:03,539
Why don't we meet
at King at2:30?

1239
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,791
OK?

1240
01:01:05,832 --> 01:01:10,003
Well, you tell me then.
All right. Bye-bye.

1241
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:12,673
Hey, Carlos.
Glad you could make it.

1242
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:13,674
How are you?

1243
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:14,716
OK. How are you?

1244
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:16,301
You know Carter?

1245
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:17,970
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1246
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:21,056
You ever work for
Habitat for Humanity?

1247
01:01:21,098 --> 01:01:23,392
-No.
-It's a good project.

1248
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:27,813
We got 25 houses up
in one Easter weekend.

1249
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:31,233
And you know Father Boyle?

1250
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:33,151
Yeah. I've heard of him.

1251
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:35,821
He's an amazing man.
Sit down.

1252
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:38,699
We spent some time
in Boyle Heights.

1253
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,367
It's a tough neighborhood, huh?

1254
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:41,869
Yes, sir.

1255
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,538
I imagine you've seen
your share of friends...

1256
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,999
sucked into "la vida loca."

1257
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,584
Yeah.

1258
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:52,963
-Not just a Ricky Martin song.
-No, sir.

1259
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:56,800
So, what happened?

1260
01:01:56,842 --> 01:01:58,760
Uh, what happened?

1261
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:01,847
We were supposed to have
a meeting last week.

1262
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:03,849
I don't know.

1263
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:06,560
I got the bus schedule
all screwed up...

1264
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:09,104
and it was too late.

1265
01:02:09,146 --> 01:02:11,732
You could have called
to say you weren't coming.

1266
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:15,360
I--I did call.

1267
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:20,032
Maybe she just didn't get you
the message. The lady.

1268
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:22,242
Maria!

1269
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:23,619
Maria!

1271
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:28,081
Yes?

1272
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:30,918
Did Mr. Nunez call last week
to say he wasn't coming in?

1273
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:33,921
Not to me.
Should I ask Sandy?

1274
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:35,380
No, that's OK.

1276
01:02:45,807 --> 01:02:50,437
I'm more than happy
to use my connections...

1277
01:02:50,479 --> 01:02:53,524
to help someone
get a foot in the door...

1278
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:56,026
but I have
absolutely no patience...

1279
01:02:56,068 --> 01:03:00,280
with individuals who will not
participate in the process.

1280
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:02,950
I can't do this alone.

1281
01:03:02,991 --> 01:03:06,703
Mr. Oakley, um...

1282
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:08,914
I really appreciate
you seeing me today.

1283
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:12,918
OK. I think I know
what's going on here.

1284
01:03:14,503 --> 01:03:18,423
I know the powerful effect
Nicole can have on people.

1285
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:21,134
She's absolutely fabulous...

1286
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:23,512
at taking
a perfectly-oiled train...

1287
01:03:23,554 --> 01:03:26,515
and running it
right off the tracks.

1288
01:03:26,557 --> 01:03:30,060
Now, I do love her.
Unconditionally.

1289
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:32,688
That goes without saying.

1290
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:36,483
But she can be so destructive.

1291
01:03:36,525 --> 01:03:38,652
And volatile.

1292
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:42,823
And, um, the anger...

1293
01:03:42,865 --> 01:03:45,325
ever since...

1294
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:46,952
Well, to be 12 years old...

1295
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:50,914
and to find your mother
like that...

1296
01:03:50,956 --> 01:03:55,878
I think when Nicole's mother
took her own life...

1297
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:57,546
Nicole decided
then and there...

1298
01:03:57,588 --> 01:04:02,968
that she would never,
ever trust anyone again.

1299
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,887
And it was her
against the world...

1300
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:07,139
and God forbid anybody
should try and help her.

1301
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:09,600
She's persona non grata...

1302
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:12,352
with half the psychiatrists
on the West side.

1303
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:17,774
A lot of them have recommended
that I send her to...

1304
01:04:17,816 --> 01:04:20,319
one of those behavior
modification schools...

1305
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,487
but I...

1306
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:26,366
She's tried to kill herself
a number of times...

1307
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:28,118
but what can I do?

1308
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,245
She lies and she drinks.

1309
01:04:30,287 --> 01:04:31,872
She does drugs.

1310
01:04:31,914 --> 01:04:33,999
She hates me.
Hates her step-mother.

1311
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:35,501
Mr. Oakley--

1313
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:40,964
Ahh, nothin'.

1314
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:44,927
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be
telling you about this...

1315
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:48,847
but you seem like
such a good person.

1316
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:52,351
Such a decent person.

1317
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:56,355
Now, you want me to write
this recommendation?

1318
01:04:56,438 --> 01:04:58,565
You want me to put myself
on the line?

1319
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:02,152
Well, I want you to
listen to my advice.

1320
01:05:02,194 --> 01:05:05,364
Now, stay away
from my daughter.

1321
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:06,865
You hear me?

1322
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:10,160
For your own good,
for my peace of mind...

1323
01:05:10,202 --> 01:05:12,079
stay away from Nicole.

1324
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:19,002
You know, it's a painful
thing for a father to...

1325
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:23,215
have to acknowledge a truth
about their own child.

1326
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:28,762
it's taken me a long time
to accept who she is.

1327
01:05:28,804 --> 01:05:32,558
And who she's never gonna be.

1328
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:44,987
MAN Well, I could sleep forever

1329
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:48,532
But it's of her I dream

1330
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:56,957
if I could sleep forever

1331
01:05:56,999 --> 01:06:02,087
I could forget about everything

1332
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,640
We got a party, man.
Hey, Carlos...

1333
01:06:13,682 --> 01:06:15,184
all them honeys
gonna be there, man.

1334
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:16,476
They gonna be
checkin' us out!

1335
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:17,477
Hey.

1336
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,313
Ha ha. Hey.

1337
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:20,647
So, what happened?

1338
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:21,982
When?

1339
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:23,108
You didn't call me.

1340
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,651
Oh, I got home late.

1341
01:06:24,693 --> 01:06:26,778
I just had stuff to do.

1342
01:06:26,862 --> 01:06:28,155
Well, what'd he say?

1343
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:30,157
I'll see you guys later.

1344
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:32,576
All right.

1345
01:06:32,618 --> 01:06:35,120
-What happened?
-No, nothing.

1346
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:37,414
He just said he'd write me
a recommendation.

1347
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:38,624
But what did he say?

1348
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:40,501
About what?

1349
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:43,086
-About me.
-Nothing.

1350
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:44,546
Come on, just tell me
what he said.

1351
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:47,508
I really don't want
to get in the middle--

1352
01:06:47,549 --> 01:06:49,009
In the middle of what?

1353
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:52,054
Look, I just need
to focus right now.

1354
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:54,139
You need to focus?

1355
01:06:54,181 --> 01:06:56,642
I can't afford to mess up, man.
I told you that.

1356
01:06:56,725 --> 01:06:58,644
My mom's all over me
'cause I'm never around...

1357
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:00,979
and my grades are for shit.

1358
01:07:01,021 --> 01:07:03,899
I could hardly keep
my eyes open at practice.

1359
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:06,485
All I want to do is sleep for
more than four hours straight.

1360
01:07:06,568 --> 01:07:08,695
I'm sorry
for messing up your life.

1361
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:12,157
I just need to remember
what's important.

1362
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:14,159
What's important to you?

1363
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:16,161
My priorities.

1365
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:22,042
What did he tell you?

1367
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:35,931
He told me
to stay away from you.

1368
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:40,978
That you were trouble
and you'd just mess me up.

1369
01:07:44,565 --> 01:07:46,108
And what did you say?

1370
01:07:52,906 --> 01:07:54,491
I just...

1371
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:58,954
I see.

1372
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:05,294
MAN Every time

1373
01:08:05,335 --> 01:08:09,256
it's time to call

1375
01:08:11,175 --> 01:08:13,802
In many ways

1376
01:08:13,844 --> 01:08:15,387
Every dream

1377
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:21,768
Gets broken over

1378
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:23,604
With little time

1379
01:08:23,645 --> 01:08:33,780
I will fly within your sky

1380
01:08:33,822 --> 01:08:36,491
Every time

1381
01:08:36,533 --> 01:08:42,331
You start to call

1382
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:44,917
And on the way

1383
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:52,424
All destruction is my wine

1384
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:58,013
Though it's sad and lonely

1385
01:08:58,055 --> 01:09:03,310
There's a whole life
waiting after dawn

1386
01:09:03,352 --> 01:09:06,188
Gonna slide

1387
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:09,274
You can be anywhere
when your life begins.

1388
01:09:09,316 --> 01:09:10,943
You find the right person,
then...

1389
01:09:10,984 --> 01:09:14,571
all of a sudden,
anything's possible.

1391
01:09:16,365 --> 01:09:17,449
I'm eating, Mom.

1392
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:18,825
I'm just trying
to figure this out.

1394
01:09:20,202 --> 01:09:22,663
Chemistry homework.

1395
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:23,956
Hello?

1396
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:24,957
LUZ: Hola, Mrs. Nunez.
Soy Luz.

1398
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:29,294
No estoy a qui.

1399
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:33,090
Don't tell her I'm here.

1400
01:09:41,932 --> 01:09:44,184
I told you, Mom,
I don't want to talk to her.

1401
01:09:44,226 --> 01:09:45,811
Because I don't want to.

1403
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:48,939
Mira. Tu comida.

1404
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:51,692
-I'll eat it later.
-Ay, muchacho.

1410
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:17,551
Yeah!

1412
01:10:19,261 --> 01:10:20,512
Hello?

1413
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:21,889
Nicole?

1414
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:23,765
Yeah?

1415
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:24,850
I need to talk to you.

1416
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:26,435
Who is this?

1417
01:10:26,476 --> 01:10:27,728
You know who this is.

1418
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:29,521
I--I can't hear you.

1419
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:30,898
Where are you?

1420
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:32,399
What?

1421
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:33,442
Where are you?

1422
01:10:33,483 --> 01:10:34,443
I--I can't hear you.

1423
01:10:34,484 --> 01:10:35,777
Are you at Seller's house?

1424
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:37,863
I'm just having
a good time, OK?

1425
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:39,573
And you need to focus.

1426
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,908
Nicole, I really have to--

1427
01:10:40,949 --> 01:10:43,410
Get off the phone and in
the hot tub, girl. Damn!

1428
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:44,745
Nicole!

1429
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:46,079
I'm gonna go.

1430
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:48,290
Nicole, I just want to--

1431
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:50,626
-Take your time.
-Yeah, hold on.

1434
01:11:02,304 --> 01:11:05,974
I'm uncomfortable
with myself

1435
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:08,101
Carlos!

1436
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:10,103
What's up, Carlos?
What's up, baby?

1437
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:13,273
Yo, get him a tequila.
Girl, put a titty in his mouth.

1438
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:14,691
Don't you know when to flake

1439
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:21,114
And I am not doing
all right

1440
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:28,121
And I am not doing
all right

1441
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:31,250
None of this makes sense

1442
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,252
They don't support me...

1443
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:44,805
Come on, Nicole, let's go.

1444
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:45,973
DAVIS: Whoa, stud.

1445
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:47,599
I was just trying
to get a taste, man.

1446
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:50,143
Shut up, Davis,
before I kick your ass!

1447
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:51,311
Hey, man,
what's your problem?

1448
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:52,646
You're my problem !
Get down!

1449
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:56,191
DAVIS: Hey!
What's your problem, bro?

1450
01:11:56,233 --> 01:11:58,318
Dude,
she was having a good time.

1451
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,112
GIRL:
What's wrong with you?

1452
01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:02,489
DAVIS:
I thought I was your friend.

1453
01:12:02,531 --> 01:12:05,534
Just leave, you know that?
Get off me, bitch!

1455
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:25,179
Shit.

1458
01:12:30,809 --> 01:12:32,686
Stopping a vehicle
with expired tags.

1459
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:34,521
Two occupants.

1461
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,110
Expired on 6-7-00.

1462
01:12:40,152 --> 01:12:43,655
Registered to
Representative Thomas Oakley.

1463
01:12:45,782 --> 01:12:46,950
Good evening, sir.

1464
01:12:46,992 --> 01:12:49,703
License and registration,
please.

1465
01:12:57,753 --> 01:12:59,546
I don't know
where the registration's at.

1466
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:00,881
Who does this car belong to?

1467
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:03,050
It belongs to her.

1468
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:05,219
Where you comin' from tonight?

1469
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:06,553
From a party.

1470
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:07,804
You been drinkin' tonight?

1471
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:09,223
No, sir.

1472
01:13:09,264 --> 01:13:11,725
Why don't you step out of
the car for me for a minute?

1473
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:12,768
I just live right off--

1474
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:14,353
Sir, please,
step out of the car for me.

1475
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:15,771
John, you check on
the young lady.

1476
01:13:15,812 --> 01:13:17,731
Sir, please step out
of the car.

1477
01:13:17,773 --> 01:13:18,982
Keep your hands up
where I can see 'em.

1478
01:13:19,024 --> 01:13:21,735
Miss, let's go. Let's go.

1479
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:24,613
Time to wake up. Let's go.

1480
01:13:24,655 --> 01:13:25,739
Put your hands up.

1481
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:27,115
Time to get up. Wake up.

1482
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:28,951
Walk over to the curb,
have a seat.

1483
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:33,497
Here you go.
Step out of the car, please.

1484
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:34,957
There you go. Wake up.

1485
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:36,917
Sir, the tags
are expired on this car.

1486
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,585
What's your name?

1487
01:13:38,627 --> 01:13:39,628
Do you know
this guy right here?

1488
01:13:39,628 --> 01:13:41,713
-Yeah.
-Has he tried to hurt you?

1489
01:13:41,755 --> 01:13:42,840
No, he hasn't hurt me.

1490
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:45,008
What are you doing?
Why are you touching me?

1491
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:46,260
Get the hell off of me!

1492
01:13:46,301 --> 01:13:48,053
Just calm down.

1493
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:49,221
Nicole, stop.

1494
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:50,597
Get the hell off of me!

1495
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:51,640
Nicole, stop it!

1496
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:52,808
Where are you going?

1497
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:55,227
No!
He didn't do anything!

1498
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:56,562
Makin' it worse for yourself.

1499
01:13:56,603 --> 01:13:58,772
What the hell is going on?!
Get off of me!

1500
01:13:58,814 --> 01:14:00,816
Stay here. Don't move.

1501
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:02,609
Stop!
We didn't do anything!

1502
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:03,610
Nicole, just calm down!

1503
01:14:03,652 --> 01:14:04,611
Get off of me!

1504
01:14:04,653 --> 01:14:06,780
Take her to the car.
Put her in the car.

1505
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:08,615
What's going on?

1507
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:14,872
Hello?

1508
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,001
Come on in.

1510
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:40,939
Good evening, sir.

1511
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:42,441
Good evening.

1512
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:44,318
We stopped this young man
driving your daughter's car.

1513
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:46,528
She was intoxicated
and combative.

1514
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:48,614
We found drug paraphernalia...

1515
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:50,824
and alcoholic beverage
containers in the vehicle.

1516
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:51,867
Christ.

1517
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:53,285
We thought we'd give you
the courtesy...

1518
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:54,494
of dealing with her yourself.

1519
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:55,871
Now, we could put
a scare into her...

1520
01:14:55,913 --> 01:14:57,039
and let her
spend the night in jail.

1521
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,624
No. Thank you, Officer.
I can handle this.

1522
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:00,792
No, you can't handle it!

1523
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:02,127
Nicole, just calm down.

1524
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:04,129
-Calm down?
-Everything will be all right.

1525
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:05,339
No, it's not gonna be
all right!

1526
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:06,507
Look at you.
What are you doing--

1527
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:08,217
COURTNEY:
What is the matter out here?

1528
01:15:08,258 --> 01:15:09,218
Go back into the house.

1529
01:15:09,259 --> 01:15:10,511
Is she drunk again?

1530
01:15:10,552 --> 01:15:11,803
Courtney, look,
I am taking care of this.

1531
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:15,265
How many times do we have
to put up with her behavior?

1532
01:15:15,307 --> 01:15:18,519
When is it gonna be enough,
for God's sake?!

1533
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,521
When?

1534
01:15:20,562 --> 01:15:25,817
Look at you, Nicole.

1535
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:28,570
Just look at you.

1536
01:15:28,612 --> 01:15:32,741
What kind of a daughter are you?

1537
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:37,412
Not yours.

1538
01:15:37,454 --> 01:15:40,707
Thank God for that.

1539
01:15:40,707 --> 01:15:42,918
This is--

1540
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,545
Carlos, please,
what did I tell you?

1541
01:15:44,586 --> 01:15:48,340
Just go away.
Please. Just leave.

1542
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:51,009
Go.

1543
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:53,220
You hear me?

1544
01:15:53,262 --> 01:15:55,597
Why do you hate me so much?

1546
01:15:56,807 --> 01:15:59,476
How could you tell
the one person in the world...

1547
01:15:59,518 --> 01:16:04,106
that I love,
that I care about so much...

1548
01:16:04,147 --> 01:16:06,233
how could you tell him
to stay away from me?

1549
01:16:06,275 --> 01:16:09,570
Do you think the only thing
I'll do to anyone...

1550
01:16:09,611 --> 01:16:11,196
is screw them up?

1551
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:15,534
Do you think
that I'm not worth loving?

1553
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:23,125
-Nicole--
-Carlos, this is our problem.

1554
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:26,003
It's our problem, not yours.

1555
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:28,964
Just leave. Go.

1557
01:16:32,634 --> 01:16:34,344
Come on, son, let's go.

1558
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:40,559
Honey, listen,
come on to the house--

1559
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:43,270
Leave me alone!
Just leave me alone.

1560
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:48,317
Just come in the house, Nicole.

1561
01:16:48,358 --> 01:16:49,610
No.

1562
01:16:51,778 --> 01:16:54,281
Just get in the house.

1563
01:16:54,323 --> 01:16:56,200
Jesus Christ.

1564
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:58,243

1565
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,588
MAN Christened life

1566
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:13,509
Somehow I found you here

1567
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:18,514
Torn from the hope
and fear

1568
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:23,644
Hold us inside

1569
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:35,322
You pulled me out

1570
01:17:35,364 --> 01:17:40,494
Up from the world
I've known

1571
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:45,290
And all that was
broken and cold

1572
01:17:45,332 --> 01:17:48,836
You brought me here

1574
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:54,341
The mid-term counts
for 25% of your grade...

1575
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:57,386
so I want you to pull
your thoughts together...

1576
01:17:57,427 --> 01:18:00,138
TEACHER: Can I help you?

1577
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:03,350
Faith in the life
we've done

1578
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:04,852
OK, where was I?

1579
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:10,023
it holds us inside

1580
01:18:11,191 --> 01:18:13,193
Ohh

1581
01:18:13,235 --> 01:18:15,654
From you, one look

1582
01:18:15,696 --> 01:18:18,115
Just one look

1583
01:18:18,156 --> 01:18:23,245
And everything is shattered

1584
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:25,914
From you, one word

1585
01:18:25,956 --> 01:18:29,918
Stars burn and fall

1586
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:36,925
Oh

1587
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:40,554
Oh

1588
01:18:40,596 --> 01:18:44,057
Carlos.
You need something?

1589
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:46,393
From you, one look

1590
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:48,604
Just one look

1591
01:18:48,645 --> 01:18:50,105
TEACHER:
Where you going?

1592
01:18:50,147 --> 01:18:52,774
And everything is shattered

1593
01:18:52,816 --> 01:18:54,735
Yo, you got a pass.

1594
01:18:54,776 --> 01:18:56,778
Hello?

1595
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:00,574
Towers burn and fall

1596
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:03,911
Fall, fall

1597
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:06,788
From you, one look...

1598
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,081
What's going on?

1599
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:12,503
Packing.

1600
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:15,255
Where are you going?

1601
01:19:15,297 --> 01:19:17,883
Oh.

1602
01:19:17,925 --> 01:19:20,802
I'm going
to the Turnabout Ranch...

1603
01:19:20,844 --> 01:19:24,473
in lovely Escalante, Utah...

1604
01:19:24,515 --> 01:19:27,434
and I get to be escorted
by a lovely gentleman...

1605
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:31,188
who's waiting for me
in the principal's office.

1606
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:35,400
So it looks like I get to go
to boot camp before you do.

1607
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:37,945
Sorry for being so dramatic
the other night.

1608
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:39,613
It was stupid.

1609
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:40,739
I'm sorry for not--

1610
01:19:40,781 --> 01:19:43,534
Don't say anything.

1611
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:45,160
You couldn't do anything.

1612
01:19:45,202 --> 01:19:48,580
You were smart
not to say anything.

1614
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:53,752
So, Mr. Nunez...

1615
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:56,463
it was great knowing you.

1616
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:58,632
I hope you have
a wonderful life.

1617
01:20:01,677 --> 01:20:02,970
Let's leave.

1618
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:05,764
What?

1619
01:20:05,806 --> 01:20:07,808
Let's get out of here
right now.

1620
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:12,646
Aren't you
in the middle of an exam?

1621
01:20:12,688 --> 01:20:14,857
Like right now?

1622
01:20:14,898 --> 01:20:16,149
So?

1623
01:20:17,484 --> 01:20:19,528
I'm not gonna let you
walk out of your mid-term.

1624
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:21,321
I already did.

1625
01:20:23,365 --> 01:20:25,909
Annapolis is gonna
look at these grades.

1626
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:27,828
You're not listening to me.

1627
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:29,788
I wanna be with you.

1628
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:32,291
I don't give a shit about
anything else right now.

1629
01:20:32,332 --> 01:20:36,378
Mid-terms, grades,
Annapolis, your father.

1630
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:40,174
I want to be with you.

1631
01:20:42,176 --> 01:20:44,553
Do you want to be with me?

1632
01:20:46,096 --> 01:20:47,848
I love you.

1633
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:49,933
Don't just say that because--

1634
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:51,435
Shut up.

1635
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:53,979
I love you, OK?

1637
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:02,362
You know,
this guy in the office...

1638
01:21:02,404 --> 01:21:05,199
he's pretty damn big.

1639
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,825
Ha ha!

1640
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:10,037
Then...
let's go out on Sunset.

1641
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:16,126
Oh. Ha ha ha!

1642
01:21:16,168 --> 01:21:17,753
-Come on!
-I'm coming!

1643
01:21:17,794 --> 01:21:22,674
I imagine
long walks down the road

1645
01:21:24,051 --> 01:21:27,679
Things begin to bloom
and the sky explodes

1646
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:31,767
The damage is undone

1647
01:21:31,808 --> 01:21:33,894
Then I know

1648
01:21:33,936 --> 01:21:36,230
This has got to be a dream

1649
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:39,358
Machines and luxuries
don't last

1650
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:41,902
Here.
You can wear this.

1651
01:21:41,944 --> 01:21:46,198
And I woke up half-dead
in the hour glass

1652
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,575
Now,
does that sound funny

1653
01:21:48,617 --> 01:21:50,911
Wait, you're almost there

1654
01:21:50,953 --> 01:21:52,538
it's gone

1655
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:55,499
You're almost there,
it's gone

1656
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:59,419
You're almost
where what follows you

1657
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:03,006
Does not bother you

1658
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:10,931
I have walked
the tightrope parts of me

1659
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:17,062
Toed the line
just far enough to see

1660
01:22:19,606 --> 01:22:23,485
Never found the gift
I got for free

1661
01:22:23,527 --> 01:22:25,654
You pay for them dearly

1662
01:22:25,696 --> 01:22:29,700
I see my forever
as one long night

1663
01:22:31,368 --> 01:22:33,912
And if I could
make it dark

1664
01:22:33,954 --> 01:22:36,665
I could make it light

1665
01:22:36,707 --> 01:22:39,960
I know that most
of living done...

1666
01:22:40,002 --> 01:22:41,795
Don't be writing on my back.

1667
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:44,464
Only thought survives

1668
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:46,800
Wait, you're almost there

1669
01:22:46,842 --> 01:22:47,843
it's gone

1670
01:22:47,885 --> 01:22:49,261
Aah!

1671
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:52,556
Almost where
what follows you

1672
01:22:52,598 --> 01:22:54,474
Does not

1675
01:23:06,195 --> 01:23:07,654
What are you doing?

1676
01:23:07,654 --> 01:23:10,324
You'll see.

1677
01:23:26,673 --> 01:23:28,175
That's pretty cool.

1678
01:23:28,217 --> 01:23:30,511
My shrine to Carlos.

1680
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:34,515
Can I see more of it?

1681
01:23:34,515 --> 01:23:36,141
Yeah, sure.

1683
01:23:47,486 --> 01:23:50,989
My suicide notes.

1684
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:52,741
Creative, huh?

1686
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:04,086
That's your mother, isn't it?

1687
01:24:04,127 --> 01:24:06,713
Yeah.

1688
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,342
She...

1689
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:13,428
she was in bed asleep,
I thought...

1690
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:17,015
so I went downstairs...

1691
01:24:17,057 --> 01:24:19,351
and I stayed real quiet
all afternoon...

1692
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:21,562
so I wouldn't disturb her.

1693
01:24:21,562 --> 01:24:26,066
And then I went back up...

1694
01:24:26,108 --> 01:24:29,194
and she was still lying there.

1695
01:24:29,236 --> 01:24:31,947
My dad thinks
we're the same person.

1696
01:24:31,989 --> 01:24:33,532
Did he say that?

1697
01:24:33,574 --> 01:24:35,784
He doesn't need to.

1698
01:24:35,826 --> 01:24:37,452
What else am I supposed
to think...

1699
01:24:37,494 --> 01:24:41,081
except I'm gonna end up
like her?

1700
01:24:41,123 --> 01:24:43,041
It's genetics, right?

1702
01:24:47,588 --> 01:24:50,257
Your father, though...

1703
01:24:50,299 --> 01:24:51,717
he really loves you.

1704
01:24:51,758 --> 01:24:53,427
He does.

1705
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:54,761
No, he doesn't.

1706
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:57,347
Nicole, listen to me.

1707
01:24:57,389 --> 01:24:58,807
He really loves you.

1708
01:24:58,849 --> 01:25:03,687
He just doesn't know
how to handle you.

1709
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:06,648
I think you scare him.

1710
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:07,649
I scare him ?

1711
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:09,776
You do. I mean,
you scare me sometimes.

1712
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:12,070
-I scare you?
-Yes.

1713
01:25:12,112 --> 01:25:13,071
I mean, you...

1714
01:25:13,113 --> 01:25:15,115
How do I scare you?

1715
01:25:15,157 --> 01:25:16,825
You just get out of control.

1716
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:20,120
-I do not.
-Yes, you do.

1717
01:25:20,162 --> 01:25:21,830
What are you talking about?

1718
01:25:21,872 --> 01:25:22,956
You know what
I'm talking about.

1719
01:25:22,998 --> 01:25:26,919
I'm 17. I'm supposed
to get out of control.

1720
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,754
I guess.

1721
01:25:28,795 --> 01:25:33,467
My dad, he doesn't
understand me or...

1722
01:25:33,467 --> 01:25:35,511
anything about me.

1723
01:25:35,552 --> 01:25:37,012
Have you tried talking to him?

1724
01:25:37,054 --> 01:25:38,597
Yeah.

1725
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:42,267
-Sober?
-Shut up.

1726
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:45,521
Doesn't happen, does it?

1727
01:25:45,562 --> 01:25:48,482
I'm not always drunk.

1730
01:26:25,811 --> 01:26:27,813
Hey.

1731
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:29,648
What are you doing out here?

1732
01:26:38,907 --> 01:26:40,367
I want to be good for you.

1733
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:43,203
You are good for me.

1734
01:26:43,245 --> 01:26:46,623
Not if I keep taking you away...

1735
01:26:46,665 --> 01:26:48,917
from everything
you've worked so hard for.

1736
01:26:48,959 --> 01:26:51,420
I want to make things
better for once...

1737
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:53,046
not worse.

1738
01:26:54,173 --> 01:26:56,925
'Cause I really
want to be with you.

1739
01:26:56,967 --> 01:27:00,429
I can't keep running
away from things.

1740
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:02,431
I'm here for you.

1741
01:27:02,472 --> 01:27:04,516
I know you are.

1743
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:41,303
Well, do you have
a 310 listing for J. Foster?

1744
01:27:41,345 --> 01:27:43,096
OPERA TOR: No listing, sir.

1745
01:27:43,096 --> 01:27:46,099
Well, try B. Foster at 818.

1746
01:27:46,099 --> 01:27:50,020
F-o-s-t-e-r.

1747
01:27:50,062 --> 01:27:53,273
OPERA TOR: No, sir.
There's no Fosterin 818.

1748
01:27:55,692 --> 01:27:57,986
OPERA TOR:
Should I try the 310 again?

1749
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:03,075
Sir? I'm trying
to help you, sir.

1750
01:28:03,116 --> 01:28:04,952
Hello?

1752
01:28:16,964 --> 01:28:19,049
Well, I've been up all night.

1753
01:28:19,091 --> 01:28:20,384
Trying to call everybody.

1754
01:28:20,425 --> 01:28:23,387
I called Maddy and Lainie
and your friend Foster...

1755
01:28:23,428 --> 01:28:26,014
who apparently doesn't
believe in telephones.

1757
01:28:28,308 --> 01:28:30,727
Honey, I know you don't want
to go to this school...

1758
01:28:30,769 --> 01:28:32,980
but it's supposed
to be extraordinary.

1759
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:35,482
Marty Sheen says it's top-notch.

1760
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:37,317
Dad, I'll--

1761
01:28:37,317 --> 01:28:38,652
You'll have your own horse.

1762
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:40,988
My own horse?

1763
01:28:41,029 --> 01:28:43,073
Well, you like horses,
don't you?

1764
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:45,534
When I was eight.

1765
01:28:45,576 --> 01:28:47,202
Well, the counselor
said that--

1766
01:28:47,244 --> 01:28:49,997
he warned me you would try
to talk your way out of it.

1767
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:52,791
He said there's a danger of us
getting drawn back...

1768
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:55,752
into old patterns
and destructive behavior...

1769
01:28:55,794 --> 01:28:59,173
and that we should spend
our time focusing on...

1770
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:05,137
conversations that focus on
"We" versus "Me."

1771
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:08,348
This is "We."

1772
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:12,311
Oh. Well, good.

1773
01:29:12,352 --> 01:29:14,104
Good.

1774
01:29:14,146 --> 01:29:18,066
I'll go wherever
you want me to go.

1775
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:20,569
I mean,
I know I'm a mess.

1776
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:22,237
No, you're not a mess.

1777
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:24,031
No, I am. I am a mess.

1778
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:27,201
And I'd probably
send me away, too.

1780
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:31,246
You've got Morgan now...

1781
01:29:31,288 --> 01:29:35,167
and you're gonna do it
right this time.

1782
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,714
I just wish
I wasn't the child...

1783
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:43,842
that everybody learned
what not to do from.

1784
01:29:43,884 --> 01:29:45,969
That's not who you are.

1785
01:29:46,011 --> 01:29:49,473
I know I remind you of Mom.

1786
01:29:49,515 --> 01:29:52,434
Everything that went wrong...

1787
01:29:52,476 --> 01:30:00,526
but sometimes you look at me
like you wish I wasn't there.

1788
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:06,323
Like you wish
I'd just disappear.

1789
01:30:06,365 --> 01:30:08,951
And it just hurts so bad.

1790
01:30:11,995 --> 01:30:15,832
I know I'm not easy to love...

1791
01:30:15,874 --> 01:30:17,876
but could you try anyway?

1792
01:30:17,918 --> 01:30:20,546
I do love you.

1793
01:30:20,587 --> 01:30:22,923
I love you so much.

1795
01:30:24,758 --> 01:30:27,886
I'm frightened for you
every minute.

1796
01:30:29,596 --> 01:30:32,432
Every minute.

1797
01:30:32,432 --> 01:30:34,351
And I need help.

1798
01:30:34,393 --> 01:30:36,770
I can't do it alone.

1799
01:30:36,812 --> 01:30:38,772
Tom, honey?

1800
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:41,650
Morgan's got her swim class.
it starts in 10 minutes.

1801
01:30:41,692 --> 01:30:44,152
What's going on?

1802
01:30:44,194 --> 01:30:46,488
That's what we're trying
to figure out here.

1803
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:48,490
COURTNEY:
What do you mean figure out?

1804
01:30:48,532 --> 01:30:51,785
Didn't we agree on
a plan of action?

1805
01:30:51,785 --> 01:30:56,456
Rosa? Would you please
put Morgan in the car?

1806
01:30:56,498 --> 01:30:59,251
Thank you.
Yes, right now.

1807
01:30:59,293 --> 01:31:00,794
Oh, my God.

1808
01:31:00,836 --> 01:31:03,672
This is not gonna start up
all over again.

1809
01:31:03,714 --> 01:31:07,301
She needs discipline.
Children need limits.

1810
01:31:07,342 --> 01:31:08,427
They want limits!

1811
01:31:08,468 --> 01:31:11,013
-So we'll set them.
-We already have!

1812
01:31:11,054 --> 01:31:14,057
She's going to that school
in Utah.

1813
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:19,062
No. I am not the bad guy.
This is not about me.

1814
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:21,607
I have a child
that I'm thinking of.

1815
01:31:21,648 --> 01:31:24,651
So do I. Two children.

1816
01:31:35,245 --> 01:31:36,997
Oh, Nic...

1817
01:31:36,997 --> 01:31:41,835
Nicole, I just don't think
I can live with you.

1818
01:31:43,712 --> 01:31:46,006
I know I can't live without her.

1819
01:31:55,432 --> 01:31:58,143
We have to be at Pepperdine
in ten minutes, Tom.

1820
01:31:58,185 --> 01:32:00,812
I'm talking to my daughter.

1821
01:32:00,854 --> 01:32:04,191
It's Morgan's
very first swim class.

1822
01:32:04,233 --> 01:32:06,193
I'm talking to my daughter.

1823
01:32:13,325 --> 01:32:16,620
Nicole,
I just want Morgan...

1824
01:32:16,662 --> 01:32:19,581
to have an older sister
that she can look up to.

1825
01:32:19,623 --> 01:32:22,668
Me, too.

1826
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:38,600
That's all right.
I've got her now.

1827
01:32:38,642 --> 01:32:40,352
She's not like Mom.

1828
01:32:40,394 --> 01:32:43,272
No.

1829
01:32:43,313 --> 01:32:46,233
God, your mom
was an amazing woman.

1830
01:32:46,233 --> 01:32:49,194
She loved you very much.

1831
01:32:49,236 --> 01:32:51,446
I wish I remembered her better.

1832
01:32:51,488 --> 01:32:54,408
Hmm.

1834
01:32:56,243 --> 01:32:58,871
We should talk about her more.

1835
01:32:58,912 --> 01:33:02,958
We will, honey. We will.

1836
01:33:11,425 --> 01:33:12,843
Before you say anything, sir...

1837
01:33:12,885 --> 01:33:14,469
I just want you to know
that I love your daughter, sir.

1838
01:33:14,511 --> 01:33:15,971
You don't have to--

1839
01:33:16,013 --> 01:33:18,765
She has so much beauty,
so much honesty...

1840
01:33:18,765 --> 01:33:20,767
and I love her so much.

1841
01:33:20,767 --> 01:33:23,437
Carlos, stop.
Now, I have something to say.

1842
01:33:23,478 --> 01:33:26,398
Thank you.

1843
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,941
For what?

1844
01:33:27,983 --> 01:33:29,943
For not listening to me.

1845
01:33:29,985 --> 01:33:31,820
For sticking around.

1846
01:33:31,862 --> 01:33:34,948
Annapolis is gonna be
lucky to get you.

1847
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:38,076
But I had a speech.

1848
01:33:38,118 --> 01:33:39,453
I had a pretty good speech.

1849
01:33:39,453 --> 01:33:41,205
I bet you did.

1850
01:33:41,246 --> 01:33:42,664
You want to hear it any ways?

1851
01:33:42,706 --> 01:33:44,333
Why don't you tell it to her?

1852
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:46,710
Seems to be doing pretty good.

1853
01:34:06,313 --> 01:34:09,024
How did that happen?

1854
01:34:09,066 --> 01:34:11,318
How did you do that?

1855
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,153
Do what?

1856
01:34:13,195 --> 01:34:16,657
I wasn't even there.

1857
01:34:16,657 --> 01:34:18,825
Yes, you were.

1858
01:34:18,867 --> 01:34:20,953
You were so there.

1859
01:34:22,204 --> 01:34:25,707
WOMAN I want to believe in

1860
01:34:28,836 --> 01:34:33,131
I want to believe in us

1861
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,052
There are millions
of people out there...

1862
01:34:37,094 --> 01:34:41,974
but, in the end,
it all comes down to one.

1863
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:49,189
I still panic sometimes,
forget to breathe...

1864
01:34:49,231 --> 01:34:51,316
but I know...

1865
01:34:51,358 --> 01:34:52,985
I know there's
something beautiful...

1866
01:34:53,026 --> 01:34:56,113
in all my imperfections.

1867
01:34:57,614 --> 01:35:00,158
A beauty which he held up
for me to see.

1868
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,036
A strength that can
never be taken away.

1869
01:35:05,873 --> 01:35:09,042
I'm going out to see him
next week...

1870
01:35:09,084 --> 01:35:10,586
but until then...

1871
01:35:10,627 --> 01:35:14,089
there's one photo
I keep with me all the time.

1872
01:35:14,131 --> 01:35:16,925
I believe in us

1873
01:35:24,224 --> 01:35:28,103
Everyone falls

1874
01:35:28,145 --> 01:35:33,150
But not everyone rises

1875
01:35:33,192 --> 01:35:36,069
Why don't you get up

1876
01:35:37,404 --> 01:35:41,825
And rise again for me

1877
01:35:41,867 --> 01:35:46,371
What if the world
were a little more perfect

1878
01:35:46,413 --> 01:35:48,582
Would you stop crying

1879
01:35:48,624 --> 01:35:51,084
Would you take the leap

1880
01:35:51,084 --> 01:35:55,255
Now, what if the world
were a little more perfect

1881
01:35:55,297 --> 01:35:59,384
Would you open your eyes

1882
01:35:59,426 --> 01:36:02,930
And blink again for me

1883
01:36:04,723 --> 01:36:08,393
For me

1884
01:36:08,435 --> 01:36:10,938
Yeah, for me

1885
01:36:17,194 --> 01:36:21,240
What about friendship

1886
01:36:21,281 --> 01:36:24,201
What about friends

1887
01:36:25,786 --> 01:36:30,415
You said the whole world
was against you

1888
01:36:30,457 --> 01:36:33,293
it all had to end

1889
01:36:34,837 --> 01:36:38,924
What about love

1890
01:36:38,966 --> 01:36:43,595
What about family

1891
01:36:43,637 --> 01:36:50,352
What about all
that you have to live for

1892
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:57,109
What if the world were
a little more perfect

1893
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:59,111
Would you stop crying

1894
01:36:59,152 --> 01:37:01,864
Would you take the leap

1895
01:37:01,905 --> 01:37:05,951
What if the world were
a little more perfect

1896
01:37:05,993 --> 01:37:09,621
Would you open your eyes

1897
01:37:09,663 --> 01:37:13,834
And blink again for me

1898
01:37:15,169 --> 01:37:18,297
For me

1899
01:37:18,338 --> 01:37:22,176
And blink again for me

1900
01:37:23,886 --> 01:37:27,639
For me

1901
01:37:27,681 --> 01:37:32,019
it isn't easy
here without you

1902
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:34,813
Why did you leave me

1903
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,901
What am I supposed to do

1904
01:37:41,278 --> 01:37:46,116
Without you

1905
01:37:50,245 --> 01:37:54,708
Without you

1906
01:38:02,716 --> 01:38:07,513
And what if the world
were a little more perfect

1907
01:38:07,554 --> 01:38:09,681
Would you stop crying

1908
01:38:09,723 --> 01:38:12,226
Would you take the leap

1909
01:38:12,267 --> 01:38:16,188
What if the world were
a little more perfect

1910
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:20,150
Would you open your eyes

1911
01:38:20,192 --> 01:38:25,113
And what if the world
were a little more perfect

1912
01:38:25,155 --> 01:38:27,074
Would you stop crying

1913
01:38:27,074 --> 01:38:29,660
Would you take the leap

1914
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:33,830
What if the world were
a little more perfect

1915
01:38:33,872 --> 01:38:37,793
could you open your eyes

1916
01:38:37,835 --> 01:38:42,339
And blink again for me

1917
01:38:43,423 --> 01:38:45,843
For me

1918
01:38:45,884 --> 01:38:47,344
Ooh

1919
01:38:47,386 --> 01:38:51,098
For me.
