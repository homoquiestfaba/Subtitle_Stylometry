Cassidy.

8
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,452
Grandma, is that you?

9
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:56,592
I-I'm sorry to call you
so early, sugarplum.

10
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:59,967
- It's okay, Grandma.
- How are you feeling?

11
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:03,272
Well, I'm gonna die
this weekend.

12
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:06,212
- Oh.
- And I-I need you to teach me.

13
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:07,849
Uh...

14
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:10,220
I-I'm not sure how.
I have never died.

15
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:11,588
No, not that.

16
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:15,463
Teach me the Zoom thing
that people use

17
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,536
and gather the family.

18
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:21,375
In normal times that might be
a difficult request,

19
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:23,815
but during the pandemic
the Worth family

20
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:27,387
found a way to come together
while dealing with a crisis.

21
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:29,827
This is their story.

22
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:32,397
Cassidy, you wanna join me
in the kitchen?

23
00:01:32,463 --> 00:01:33,532
We can Zoom together?

24
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,139
No way, your lighting sucks.

25
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:38,176
- Guys.
- Hey, Chad.

26
00:01:38,243 --> 00:01:40,280
- Hi, Chad.
- What's up, man?

27
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:41,481
There you guys are.

28
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:43,552
Wish it was
different circumstances.

29
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,393
Cassidy, wow, let me see
what you got going on there.

30
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,663
That's a lot.

31
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,202
Yeah, she did the makeup
and hair herself.

32
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:53,539
I love that.

33
00:01:53,607 --> 00:01:55,677
Hi, everybody,
not all at once, please.

34
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:57,348
That's your Uncle Bobby,
by the way.

35
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:59,652
Another example of you just
dropping out of our lives

36
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,089
and coming back in
whenever you feel like it.

37
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,961
Yeah, I just sit here
like Buddha.

38
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:05,697
Oh, hey, Mom.

39
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:12,645
- Hello, Bobby.
- Hello, Di-Di.

40
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,553
Hello, family.

41
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:18,555
- Hello
- Hi.

42
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:20,661
- Hello.
- Yes, Robert.

43
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:23,733
[both speaking Russian]

44
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:25,103
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

45
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,074
What time is it in Russia
right now, man?

46
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:29,111
- Eight hours.
- Like, it's always been later...

47
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:30,047
You guys didn't know what

48
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:31,716
a single one of those words
meant.

49
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:33,585
Are they still Communists?

50
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,290
Hi. Hi, everybody.

51
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:37,294
- Hey!
- Hi.

52
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:38,831
- Hi, Judith.
- How are you?

53
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:40,200
Hi.

54
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:43,206
- Okay, am I the last person?
- Am I the last?

55
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:44,709
- No.
- Definitely, no.

56
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,079
Katie is not there yet.

57
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:47,983
There's nowhere
with any reception.

58
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:51,022
I've been trying to find
a place to pull over, but...

59
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,926
- You know, Dorsey...
- Oh, wow, Bobby.

60
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:54,095
You don't look any different.

61
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:55,965
I know Katie's gonna be
last this time.

62
00:02:56,032 --> 00:02:57,936
- Of course Katie's last.
- Punctual as always...

63
00:02:58,003 --> 00:02:59,038
Whenever we say last,
we mean...

64
00:02:59,105 --> 00:02:59,940
It's Katie...

65
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:01,709
- Before Katie...
- Has anybody...

66
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:03,213
Hey, guys, nominating that
we just one at a time.

67
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,215
Raise your hand and talk. So.

68
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:05,852
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna raise my hand.

69
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:07,688
George Burns once wrote

70
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:10,660
that happiness
is having a large, loving,

71
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:14,635
caring, close-knit family
in another city.

72
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:18,043
Well, George Burns
didn't know Zoom.

73
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:19,745
- You know what we're here for?
- Like a family does...

74
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:22,117
Let's think about
what we're here for.

75
00:03:22,184 --> 00:03:25,858
- True.
- Where-where is Mother?

76
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:28,196
- Yeah, where is...
- Oh, good. You're all here.

77
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:29,799
Great.

78
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:34,275
I'm going to set this up
so you can see Mabel.

79
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:37,414
Just a heads up, she is
in and out of consciousness,

80
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:42,224
so do not expect her to respond,
but she can hear you.

81
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,295
Studies have shown
that she can...

82
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:47,267
she can hear, so don't be shy,

83
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:48,636
but also don't be too loud

84
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:54,281
because you are a big bunch, and
we want her passing to be calm.

85
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:57,889
- You hear that, Bret, right?
- That's a lot of instructions.

86
00:03:57,956 --> 00:04:00,427
- Hi, Mom.
- Mom, there you are.

87
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:02,131
- Hello.
- There you are.

88
00:04:02,197 --> 00:04:04,168
- Grandma, I'm here.
- It's Dorsey. I'm here...

89
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:05,237
We're actually all here,
not just Dorsey.

90
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:06,339
Katie's not here,
but I'm here.

91
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:07,274
Hi, Grandma.

92
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:09,145
Right here, Grandma,
it's Chad.

93
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:11,382
Hi y'all.

94
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:12,784
Good to see you.

95
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:16,994
Welcome to my death.
[chuckles]

96
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,031
[voice breaking]
We love you so much.

97
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:20,500
Dorsey, pull it together.

98
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,903
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hi, Mom.

99
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,573
You know, you look serene.

100
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:27,915
Looks like you can take that
"coming soon" sign off my grave.

101
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:30,854
- Mom.
- Grandma, don't.

102
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:33,560
- It's true.
- We're all here with you.

103
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:37,167
- You're in Connecticut.
- I mean in our hearts, Mother.

104
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:40,774
I'm sorry we're not there
with you.

105
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,746
Okay, so just remember

106
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:46,687
that Mabel
is doing the work right now.

107
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:48,223
She's concentrating.

108
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,364
So while encouragement is okay,
silence...

109
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:55,537
[whispering]
is actually perfect.

110
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:56,906
Okay?

111
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:59,144
- What is that mean?
- What does what mean?

112
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:00,814
Encouragement to do what?

113
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,152
- To just go.
- How do you do this?

114
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,390
Are we supposed
to say, like, it's okay?

115
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:08,162
Like, are we supposed to say,
"It's okay, you can die now"?

116
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:09,298
- No.
- Probably, I don't know.

117
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:11,202
No, we're just supposed
to be supportive.

118
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,676
Just letting her know
we all gathered...

119
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:16,445
Bobby, with all due respect,
I don't wanna hear

120
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:18,416
about being here from you, okay?

121
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:20,887
That was encouragement?

122
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:23,559
Huh.

123
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:31,175
Do you remember the time
we, uh,

124
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:33,980
we used to play music
on Grandma's porch?

125
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:37,387
She'd-she'd also sing
and dance, as I remember.

126
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:38,657
I do remember.

127
00:05:38,724 --> 00:05:41,329
Eating those biscuits,
those biscuits with grain.

128
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:44,134
- And your gas afterwards.
- Yeah, we all remember that too.

129
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,638
Thank you for bringing
that up.

130
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:47,174
And remember when
we'd go down to that bar,

131
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,349
and she got up on the...
on the bar and danced.

132
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:52,851
Oh, my God.

133
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:54,021
She kicked every glass
off that bar.

134
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,023
Oh, my mother.

135
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,992
Hey, Max?

136
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,166
[labored breathing]

137
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,082
What is that noise?

138
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:09,652
It's the death rattle.

139
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,020
That's her soul

140
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:12,257
- trying to say goodbye.
- Is that it?

141
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:15,029
- It's not her...
- Oh, my God.

142
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:23,246
Everyone, I know that this
is hard, but this is normal.

143
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:27,287
I want you to know that Mabel
is not experiencing any pain.

144
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,260
I administered morphine
a little while ago.

145
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:33,232
But hang in there, guys.
You're doing great.

146
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,209
You know, the Buddhists
believe that their soul

147
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:40,648
always remains with the family.

148
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:52,738
- Oh.
- Goodbye, Mom.

149
00:06:52,805 --> 00:06:54,341
Wait? Did she die?

150
00:06:56,746 --> 00:07:00,520
Did she die? Is she dead?

151
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,090
[sobbing]

152
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:03,392
Wait, did she die?

153
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:07,200
- Fuck!
- Bye, Mom.

154
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:08,236
Wait, did she die?

155
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,571
I can't believe
we're not there.

156
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,310
- This is so fucked up!
- We should be with her.

157
00:07:12,377 --> 00:07:13,579
There are a lot
of instructions, and you're not

158
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:15,048
listening to any of them,
Dorsey.

159
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:16,318
God damn it, Bret!

160
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:18,657
- This is so stupid!
- This is so fucked!

161
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:21,362
We should be there!

162
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:23,700
Do we know yet if she died?

163
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,509
Why aren't we there?

164
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:30,848
[whispering] Okay, just
a little bit quieter.

165
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:32,049
A little bit quieter.

166
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,687
We can hear you.
She can hear you.

167
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:42,571
- Grandma?
- Where are you going, Max?

168
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:46,278
[wailing]

169
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:48,951
- Look, we get it. We get it.
- You're both the saddest.

170
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:51,455
Grandma!

171
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:55,998
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

172
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:57,267
Oh, no Grandma.

173
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:58,536
- Grandma you can go...
- Go and join Dad.

174
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,239
- It's okay.
- Bye-bye, Grandma.

175
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:03,145
Have a celestial journey.

176
00:08:03,212 --> 00:08:04,749
- It's okay.
- We're here with you.

177
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:05,751
Sleep, Mama.

178
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,222
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- You can go.

179
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:11,228
I know I can go now.

180
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:14,301
Don't give me advice.

181
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,271
Bunch of know-it-alls.

182
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:22,417
I missed it?

183
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:24,656
Did-did I miss it?
Is she fucking dead?

184
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:26,693
Did I miss it?
How come I didn't get the link?

185
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,964
- Shh.
- I've been texting you, Mama.

186
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:30,099
Stop, stop you missed...

187
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,439
yeah, I think you did miss it.

188
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:35,744
- I don't know.
- Where have you been?

189
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:42,625
- Oh, thank God. Oh, my God.
- I really thought that I...

190
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:44,696
Here we go.

191
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:50,708
[somber music]

192
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:07,675
I am going to leave this
connected for a few minutes.

193
00:09:07,742 --> 00:09:10,279
I just wanted to convey
my condolences.

194
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:11,548
I'm so sorry.

195
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:15,624
Mabel was such
a sweet, sweet woman.

196
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:19,431
A great soul
with a twisted sense of humor.

197
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:22,504
- Yeah.
- Which I like.

198
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:16,880
Cass, hon.

199
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,356
You just wanna sit with her
for a while?

200
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,025
Yeah. Yeah.

201
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:26,900
I'll just sit with her
until the free session runs out.

202
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,711
Okay. Okay, you do that.

203
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:34,615
I'll make
your favorite spaghetti, okay?

204
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:36,184
You just come down
when it's over.

205
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:43,065
Cass? Oh, sorry.

206
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:46,071
I-I thought the screen
had frozen.

207
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:49,511
You were both just so still,
you and Gigi.

208
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:53,753
Look just, um...

209
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,495
Forget it. Love you, kid.

210
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:04,709
[somber music]

211
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:17,368
I brought you some spaghetti.

212
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:20,539
I'm still with Gigi.

213
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:22,243
How has it not expired yet?

214
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,549
I took your credit card
and bought a premium session.

215
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,492
Okay.

216
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:31,061
Do you want the spaghetti
or not?

217
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:35,804
Yes, I want the spaghetti,
and I want you not to be there.

218
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:49,832

[singers vocalizing]

221
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:02,925
[singing]
Have you seen the girl

222
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:07,768
with the mind on fire?

223
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:15,817
She set out to tell the world
how they suppress our desires

224
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:23,933
- Maybe yes. Uh, maybe no.
- Definitely no.

225
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,275
My mother died yesterday,
and I'm-I'm a little scattered.

226
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:32,584
How do you spend the first day
without someone you love?

227
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,389
Especially when you...
you can't be with your family

228
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:39,798
to share the memories
and the love they created.

229
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:41,368
Let me know
if there's anything I can do.

230
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:45,342
- No, just let's...
- let's continue the meeting.

231
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:54,962
- Hey, Max? Max?
- What?

232
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:57,901
You don't even seem upset.

233
00:12:57,968 --> 00:12:59,304
I don't know.

234
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:05,282
Yeah.

235
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,226
Autumn Care of Nash,
this is Kelly.

236
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:12,497
Hi, Kelly, this is
Judith Joiner.

237
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:14,501
I-I'm Mabel Worth's wife.

238
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:16,304
- Okay.
- We met on Zoom.

239
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:18,342
I'm interested in getting
Mabel's things

240
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:20,513
sent to me
here in New York City,

241
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,051
and I'm just checking to see
that you have my address.

242
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:25,625
Mabel, right, uh.

243
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:29,197
I believe you were not
listed as next of kin, Judith.

244
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:30,967
Okay, that,
that doesn't make sense.

245
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:32,804
Can you just check
the list again, please?

246
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:35,042
- I'm sorry.
- I-I don't have you listed.

247
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:37,948
Okay, can you tell me
what's going on with her body?

248
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:40,386
Where is she
and what are the plans here?

249
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,360
I'm so sorry, Judith, but
Mabel made her own arrangements.

250
00:13:44,427 --> 00:13:46,097
Why can't you tell me
what they are?

251
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:48,368
It's not a lot of...
I'm not asking for a lot here.

252
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:49,706
Just where is she?

253
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:52,544
All I can say is that they are
coming to get her body soon,

254
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:54,380
and let me know if I can...

255
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,017
if there's anything else
I can do for you.

256
00:13:56,084 --> 00:14:00,125
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Thank you very much.

257
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:02,330
- I just put bagel...
- are you there?

258
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:04,935
- Sorry, I just look...
- I know I look like a mess.

259
00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:07,106
Yeah, I didn't wanna say
anything. What's up?

260
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:09,043
I'm trying to make
Grandma's biscuits.

261
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,381
I mean, you know
I gotta stay busy when I'm sad.

262
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:12,450
Where are you?

263
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:13,352
Uh, I don't know.

264
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,624
I think I'm in Arizona,
actually.

265
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:17,193
Your kitchen looks really nice.

266
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:19,565
How much did Grandma spend
on that remodel?

267
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:20,768
Well, Kevin did most of it.

268
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:22,436
I mean, you should see
the garage.

269
00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:24,240
He just changed everything
to kind of like a...

270
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:27,948
a man cave, and he calls it
his Garage Mahal.

271
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:29,952
[both laugh]
He is so funny, you know.

272
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:33,158
So listen, I've been trying
to kinda get a poll, you know,

273
00:14:33,225 --> 00:14:35,831
as to what grandma Mabel
would want.

274
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:38,001
Okay, well, I can do that.

275
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:39,504
I can just... who, like...

276
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:41,474
just let me know who you haven't
reached yet and I'll just...

277
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:42,944
Oh, no, I don't need you
to take over. No, no, no.

278
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:45,315
I was just saying that's what
I'm doing and I've got my list...

279
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:47,052
Well, I just, you know, like

280
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,255
I don't really like
feeling out of the loop

281
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,492
and I mean, you know, how...

282
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,231
I just, like, wanna...
just one of those times

283
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:56,037
I wish I still lived
in Spring Hope.

284
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,373
Oh, really?

285
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,610
This is when you wish
you lived here?

286
00:14:58,677 --> 00:15:00,345
No, you did it right.

287
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:03,084
You left.
We don't need your help now.

288
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:05,088
I mean,
I could have used it before.

289
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,426
I'm just gonna ignore
that dig...

290
00:15:07,493 --> 00:15:08,963
Just trying to kinda
figure out everything

291
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,967
for the digital memorial, and...

292
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:12,470
I'd really love to still try

293
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,006
to do,
like, an in-person funeral.

294
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:16,411
I really think we should do
something really traditional.

295
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:17,782
So you're gonna come home
for this?

296
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:19,183
You're gonna come home for this?

297
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,519
Yeah, she would want us
all to be together.

298
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,089
She would have wanted us
to be together

299
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:23,558
a little bit more
before she died.

300
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:24,729
I mean, Katie, I think
a lot of times

301
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:26,297
when stuff like this happens,
like,

302
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:28,335
you start to understand,
like, what's really important...

303
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:29,806
Let's keep thinking about it.

304
00:15:29,873 --> 00:15:31,776
Let's just... let's just keep
talking and keep thinking.

305
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:33,814
How's Max doing?

306
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:35,851
He's doing great, actually.

307
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:38,857
This time has been
really good for us, I think.

308
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:40,058
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

309
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,897
Yeah, I mean, it's been hard
for him.

310
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,131
It's hard for all the kids.
I mean, it's hard...

311
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:44,267
Yeah, that's what I thought,

312
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,469
that's what I thought,
kinda hard.

313
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:46,706
That's like really
passive aggressive,

314
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:47,942
what you're saying.
Why don't you just come

315
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:49,577
right out and say what
you think?

316
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:52,583
Okay, I don't think that you
should have taken a teenager

317
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,055
who is going through a global
pandemic across the country.

318
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,695
I just think it's insane,
to be honest.

319
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,096
I-I just want you to focus
on your family

320
00:15:59,163 --> 00:16:00,599
and just focus on you.

321
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,903
You've-you've never had
a problem

322
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,405
doing that in the past?

323
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:05,878
Uh.

324
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:07,614
All right, Max is coming back
with snacks,

325
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:09,752
so, uh,
I think I'm gonna go now.

326
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:12,590
I feel like, yeah.

327
00:16:12,658 --> 00:16:13,694
- Okay, I didn't mean to be...
- So I'll just stop...

328
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,029
I didn't mean
to be rude, okay?...

329
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:16,297
- No, it's fine...
- You just ran off...

330
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:17,735
- It's fine. It's fine.
- You know what, it's fine.

331
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:19,973
I know you have all of your
opinions and since, you know,

332
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,812
you and I haven't really kept
in touch that well lately,

333
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:24,716
I don't really expect you
to know what I'm going through.

334
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:26,284
So I'm just gonna...

335
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:27,955
I'll take off, and, you know,
I'm here if you need me.

336
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:29,993
Come on. Dorsey.

337
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:31,427
Bye.

338
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:34,669
- God damn it.
- [groans]

339
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:37,808
Yeah, I don't know why my mom
has us on some stupid road trip

340
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,477
in stupid Arizona.

341
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:41,247
I think she's trying
to get us out of the house,

342
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:44,989
but now we're
in a smaller house on wheels.

343
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:46,591
What the hell is wrong
with me?

344
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,895
Except for Katie.

345
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:50,332
I hope she chokes someone
in those goddamn biscuits.

346
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,970
No one makes them
like Grandma did.

347
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:53,271
No one. I hate this RV.

348
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:54,507
Oh my God, Cassidy,
my mom is glitching.

349
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:56,310
- I hate this year!
- Look at this.

350
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:57,513
I think my mom is having
a meltdown.

351
00:16:57,579 --> 00:16:58,917
- Max, not now.
- I need some alone time.

352
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,385
You clearly haven't seen
my dad when he has a meltdown.

353
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,222
Max, knock it off. I mean it.

354
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,191
Dude, she's being normal,
stop.

355
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:04,929
- Stop.
- Leave her alone.

356
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:06,966
What are you doing? Go, go.

357
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,568
[upbeat music]

358
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,338
During these unique times,

359
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,712
more people rely
on the gig economy

360
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:14,716
to support themselves
and their families.

361
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:17,855
- Hey, there, Judy?
- Judith.

362
00:17:17,922 --> 00:17:19,892
- Okay, well, I think...
- I think I found the place.

363
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,032
We're talking about the
Autumn Care of Nash

364
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,333
nursing home, right?

365
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,773
- Yes, yes.
- That's it. That's right.

366
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,850
Jessica, a Tasker,
took that to an extreme.

367
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,189
Okay, so do you... do you want
take a screenshot

368
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,390
or do you want me to do that?

369
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:38,361
Look, just-just do
what you're doing.

370
00:17:38,428 --> 00:17:41,836
- And so it seems to Judith.
- What?

371
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:44,540
Okay, the task I hired

372
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:47,614
a Task Rabbit
to do is to provide me

373
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,958
with an ongoing live stream
of a particular building, yeah?

374
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:55,096
Okay, but for how long?

375
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:56,733
Indeterminate.

376
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,702
Wow, okay.

377
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,041
What if I have to pee
or eat or sleep?

378
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:02,912
I have... I have kids.

379
00:18:02,978 --> 00:18:05,616
Can you just, just...

380
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,126
Yeah, that's it.

381
00:18:10,193 --> 00:18:11,695
[sentimental music]

382
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,598
My wife died in there.

383
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,339
From COVID?

384
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:22,449
- No, she was in her 90s.
- Old age, I guess.

385
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:25,991
Whoa. Sorry for your loss.

386
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:27,627
Thank you.

387
00:18:27,694 --> 00:18:29,698
I just thought it was
from the virus

388
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:32,704
'cause, you know,
it's so common these days.

389
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:35,009
Didn't feel common.

390
00:18:35,076 --> 00:18:36,745
No, I mean,

391
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:38,649
it's really fucking intense
to watch a person die,

392
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:39,952
don't get me wrong.

393
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,655
I one time watched, like,

394
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:44,493
three of my cousins,
like, blow up.

395
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,732
We were on a... on a jet boat,

396
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,534
and the thing just like exploded

397
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:51,375
into a fireball right
in front of us.

398
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,980
Okay, stop talking,
Task Rabbit.

399
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:59,959
[sentimental music]

400
00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:03,464
Perfect.

401
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:05,435
Just like that.

402
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:20,232
Hey, guys.

403
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,236
- Hey.
- Oh.

404
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:25,042
Hey, Katie, are you doing
some modelling on the side?

405
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:26,311
I don't think the light's
big enough

406
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:28,716
to... to get rid of the lines.

407
00:19:28,782 --> 00:19:30,186
- Can't hear you.
- Oh, come on Katie.

408
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,254
We can't hear you...

409
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:34,294
- Bummer.
- Turn your mic on.

410
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:35,528
Damn it, my mic wasn't on.

411
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:36,833
I know none of you care
about your looks,

412
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:38,568
but I pride myself
on my appearance,

413
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,538
and I'm sorry that you don't.

414
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:41,909
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you, Mama.

415
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:43,645
- You know what?
- You know what else is gorgeous?

416
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:45,515
Inner beauty. Just inner beauty.

417
00:19:45,582 --> 00:19:47,720
Let your... let your soul
shine through.

418
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:48,990
You have inner beauty, Bret.

419
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:51,028
- He doesn't have either...
- inner nor outer.

420
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:54,234
I don't need a ring light
to let my beauty shine through.

421
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,038
- You sure about that?
- Oh, my kids.

422
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:58,475
- Are we all here?
- No.

423
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,646
- Where's Chad?
- We're waiting on Chad.

424
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:02,116
- Hello?
- Hey.

425
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:04,621
- Hey, guys. Wow.
- Look at everybody.

426
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:06,458
Jesus, Katie,
you look blown out.

427
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:08,262
- What?
- Uh, sorry, guys.

428
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:11,134
I had some book stuff going on.
I had oversee it.

429
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,770
Oh, I thought you were
trying out

430
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,474
for the next season
of "The Vikings,"

431
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,776
or whatever that show was on.

432
00:20:15,843 --> 00:20:17,613
- Very good.
- That's a beard burn.

433
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,849
Well, you know,
everybody's made

434
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,486
sacrifices during the pandemic.

435
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,755
That's for sure.

436
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:23,591
- And you sacrificed your looks?
- He sacrificed.

437
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:25,964
- [laughter]
- He's completely hell-bent now.

438
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:27,599
- Is this what we're doing?
- Is this what we're doing?

439
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:29,504
'Cause I actually...
I have stuff I could do.

440
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:31,074
Hey, that looks
like Granddad's mug.

441
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:32,276
Hey, Chad.

442
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:33,712
Did you bring that to Russia
with you?

443
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,316
Does it? Don't think so.

444
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:36,885
- A little bit.
- Hold it up to the camera.

445
00:20:36,953 --> 00:20:38,021
I don't think so.

446
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:40,359
Chad talking about unkind.

447
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:42,029
That comment you made before

448
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:44,534
about my showing
or not showing up,

449
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:48,375
I really took offense to that.

450
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:49,612
Okay.

451
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:51,448
[stammers]
Okay?

452
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:52,850
Yeah.

453
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,356
Can we please get back
to discussing the funeral?

454
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,628
- Thank you, darling. Thank you.
- Thank you, Mama.

455
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:59,364
Alex from the funeral home,

456
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,067
he is gonna be
joining us shortly.

457
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,770
- Wonderful.
- He's a very nice man.

458
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:04,407
I've got a huge itinerary
for us,

459
00:21:04,474 --> 00:21:07,246
so we're gonna have
to move, move, move.

460
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:08,582
[audio stuttering]
Oh, hello, family.

461
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,717
Hi, Alex.

462
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:11,087
- Hi, Alex.
- Hey, Alex.

463
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:13,325
- Sorry about that.
- [indistinct]

464
00:21:13,392 --> 00:21:14,594
Ooh, ooh. Al?

465
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:16,464
- Can you hear him?
- I'm having a little trouble.

466
00:21:16,531 --> 00:21:17,466
While he's figuring that out,

467
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:19,537
I just wanna say I am so happy

468
00:21:19,605 --> 00:21:23,745
that Mom did not die of COVID.

469
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:25,049
That she went peacefully.

470
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:26,551
She died either way.

471
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,753
Thanks for...[indistinct]

472
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,822
Should we help him
or something?

473
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,226
- Can't hear you.
- Restart the Zoom.

474
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,330
Go to the settings and turn
on and off the audio.

475
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:34,500
- It's working...
- Settings on and off!

476
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:35,637
- Stop yelling.
- Robert?

477
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:37,340
- Screaming doesn't help.
- Oh, dear Lord.

478
00:21:37,406 --> 00:21:38,676
Okay, how's-how's that?

479
00:21:38,742 --> 00:21:40,346
- Okay, yes, you're there.
- Yes. Good.

480
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:42,316
- That's better.
- You're welcome, guys.

481
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:43,585
Thank you.

482
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:45,356
Again, my name is Alex,

483
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:49,197
and I'm the manager here
at Cornerstone Funeral Home.

484
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:52,036
Shall we get down
to the business of bereavement?

485
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,606
Great.

486
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:55,876
Let's discuss everything

487
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:58,282
that Mabel wanted
from this event.

488
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:00,119
Okay can I... can I just
stop you right there?

489
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,823
I'm just wondering if...

490
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,527
like, is event the right word?

491
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:06,398
Only because "event"
makes me think of celebration.

492
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:08,035
Celebration makes me think
of something...

493
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:09,404
I'm just saying
it makes me think

494
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,906
of birthday parties
or graduations

495
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:12,977
or, you know, like a prom.

496
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:15,282
You're looking at it wrong,
right Alex?

497
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:16,351
- Well, you know, uh.
- Celebration of...

498
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,621
All families
grieve differently.

499
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:18,822
Yeah.

500
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:20,059
Please can we just go on
with this?

501
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,294
- Yeah, sure.
- Yes, abs... thank you, Mama.

502
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:23,098
I think personally that I know
exactly

503
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:26,304
what Grandma wanted
for the service,

504
00:22:26,371 --> 00:22:28,041
- so I can dive right in.
- I know what she wanted too.

505
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:29,544
I talked to her, too,
so I'm pretty prepared.

506
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:31,348
And I knew too because
I had talked to her a bunch.

507
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:32,550
So I've got some notes
right here.

508
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,120
Yeah, I talked to her
a few days ago.

509
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,322
I talked to her too
about a day ago.

510
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:37,126
- Please, girls.
- I can't take this today.

511
00:22:37,193 --> 00:22:38,261
I was also texting with Kelly.

512
00:22:38,328 --> 00:22:40,466
- Not today.
- I can't hear it today.

513
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:43,472
So first, well, I think what
we're gonna wanna do is,

514
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:46,177
we're gonna decide
who is writing the obit.

515
00:22:46,244 --> 00:22:47,714
I should write the obituary.

516
00:22:47,781 --> 00:22:49,884
Alex, I don't... have you had
a chance to read my book?

517
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,121
- I have not.
- Oh, come on.

518
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:53,525
[all speaking at once]

519
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:55,596
Second,
we'll get into the flowers.

520
00:22:55,663 --> 00:22:57,266
I will handle the flowers.

521
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,404
- Thank you, Judith.
- Thanks, Judith.

522
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,878
And then third, we'll get down
to the digital memorial service.

523
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:04,414
Just seems so cold.

524
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,752
- Mom, it's-it's the world.
- It's where we are now.

525
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,188
Oh, you know, actually,
there's a lot we can do now

526
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:12,028
digitally and remotely
that doesn't take away

527
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:13,465
from the experience of-of...

528
00:23:13,532 --> 00:23:15,102
and the intimacy of
the experience as well.

529
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:16,404
I mean,
I have been having therapy

530
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:18,275
over Zoom since it all started,

531
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:20,680
and it's-it's working for me.

532
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:23,952
That is one over-share there.

533
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,422
In your opinion, I guess.

534
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:28,462
- I could never do therapy.
- It's so much lying.

535
00:23:28,528 --> 00:23:29,865
Lying?

536
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:31,468
I'm not gonna tell a stranger
any of my real secrets,

537
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:32,536
so I'd be lying.

538
00:23:32,604 --> 00:23:33,606
Well, you don't need therapy
because

539
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:35,509
you-you...
you're never gonna have it.

540
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:37,379
- Oh, why?
- Because she's perfect.

541
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:39,250
Katie's so perfect, isn't she?

542
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,285
Come on, no one's perfect.

543
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,922
- Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you, Mama.

544
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:44,994
Okay, let's talk about
what we'd like Grandma to wear.

545
00:23:45,061 --> 00:23:46,197
I think we need to make sure

546
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:47,934
that she's buried
in her blue nightgown.

547
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,437
- Yeah.
- She loved blue.

548
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,907
She doesn't care
what she is buried in.

549
00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:51,876
- Yeah.
- Was her favorite color.

550
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:53,378
She loved that blue nightgown.

551
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:54,748
I don't really don't have
a strong opinion about that, so.

552
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:55,917
Yeah, sure, I mean,

553
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:56,952
she totally loved
her blue nightgown.

554
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,053
Fine. It's fine.

555
00:23:58,121 --> 00:23:59,022
I do think she should not be

556
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,092
bare-shouldered.

557
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:01,629
I think a wrap or something

558
00:24:01,695 --> 00:24:03,365
over the nightgown
'cause it is cold.

559
00:24:03,431 --> 00:24:05,737
I feel so... I feel so sad

560
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:08,542
for all the families
that have to go through this.

561
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:11,381
I don't feel like we should have
a digital funeral.

562
00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:14,052
Honestly, I think it just...
it has to be in person.

563
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,489
H-How's that gonna happen?

564
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:18,629
I think we should vote
and see... because I don't feel.

565
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:20,332
We already decided all this,
Dorsey.

566
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:22,269
It has to be in real life.

567
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,973
Gigi really wanted all of us
to get together.

568
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,144
Given the circumstances,
I don't wanna be crude,

569
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,248
but of course,
Mama and Bobby are elders.

570
00:24:28,315 --> 00:24:29,550
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

571
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:31,287
Not that I'm not thinking
about you guys.

572
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:34,026
Why don't we, like...
we could quarantine for 14 days?

573
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:36,464
- Dear God.
- We're not gonna do that.

574
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:37,433
Why not?

575
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:38,636
How is Robert supposed
to get here?

576
00:24:38,703 --> 00:24:39,972
Thank you.

577
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:41,709
Is that the guy who, like,
sold his soul to the devil

578
00:24:41,775 --> 00:24:43,378
so that he could live in Russia
for the rest of his life?

579
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:45,515
It's not my fault I had to
expose the government's secrets.

580
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:46,785
I'm sorry. I had to do that.

581
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,555
- I think you know what?
- I think... thank you.

582
00:24:48,623 --> 00:24:51,762
I think we should vote,
and I vote for in-person.

583
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:54,033
I'm in favor
of an in-person funeral.

584
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,404
And at risk of doing something
I'm never gonna do again,

585
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:57,874
I'm gonna agree with Dorsey.

586
00:24:57,941 --> 00:25:00,545
I think it would be important
for us all to be together.

587
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:02,182
I think it would be
really good for Cassidy.

588
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:03,886
All those people
for not in person?

589
00:25:03,953 --> 00:25:06,324
Everyone for not in person?
There we go.

590
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:08,395
- Well.
- Look that this.

591
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:10,532
- Is that your hand up, Alex?
- Alex, are you voting?

592
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,835
- Do I get a vote?
- No.

593
00:25:11,902 --> 00:25:13,071
I don't know,
you started going like this.

594
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,306
Oh, I was just counting
the hands

595
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:15,977
to see who was up for what.

596
00:25:16,044 --> 00:25:17,012
Did you get a count?

597
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,481
I threw my numbers off
when I...

598
00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:20,620
'cause you guys counted me,
and then I counted myself.

599
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:23,124
But if I can get another vote.

600
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:26,464
It looks like we need
a recount in North Carolina.

601
00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:28,636
Y'all, we have to talk
to Grandma's estate attorney,

602
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:30,305
and you guys have been talking
about nothing,

603
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:32,209
- and we've gotten nothing done.
- Oh, my God.

604
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:33,946
Alex, thanks so much
for all your help.

605
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:35,348
- Absolutely.
- Good luck with that meet up.

606
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:36,618
Everybody just stay on.

607
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:38,656
The same link for the attorney.
Stay on.

608
00:25:38,723 --> 00:25:40,125
- Okay, all right.
- I'm staying on.

609
00:25:40,193 --> 00:25:41,594
Bye.

610
00:25:43,364 --> 00:25:45,368
[grunts]

611
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:47,039
Hello, friends and family,
again.

612
00:25:47,106 --> 00:25:48,642
[laughing]

613
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:52,382
- I'm confused.
- It's me again, Alex.

614
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:53,284
And now I know... I know you're
wondering...

615
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,453
you're probably confused.

616
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,524
Like, what is
the funeral director

617
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:58,361
doing in a meeting with

618
00:25:58,428 --> 00:26:01,668
your grandmother's
estate attorney?

619
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:05,710
The answer is I'm both.
I'm a... I'm a licensed attorney.

620
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:08,314
It kinda made sense for me,
business-wise.

621
00:26:08,381 --> 00:26:09,450
You know, I had
the office space,

622
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:10,920
built-in client base.

623
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:11,922
Impressive.

624
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:12,757
Hey, Bret, that sounds

625
00:26:12,824 --> 00:26:14,393
like a new business idea
for you.

626
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,197
- Very funny, Robert.
- Potentially successful.

627
00:26:16,265 --> 00:26:18,201
There's a reason why,
you know,

628
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:22,342
bail bondsmen set up across
the street from jails, right?

629
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:24,380
- Oh, my God.
- Who-who found him?

630
00:26:24,446 --> 00:26:25,950
- Katie?
- One price.

631
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,054
- I-I am in the "Pennysaver."
- He is in the "Pennysaver."

632
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:30,358
Yeah, I mean, if anybody else
in your family passes

633
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:34,968
or whatever, please use my...
my number, uh, one-stop shop.

634
00:26:35,035 --> 00:26:37,072
Yeah, and let's just get on
with it, please.

635
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:43,484
Well, Mabel wanted
to address you all directly.

636
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,098
Now?

637
00:26:50,165 --> 00:26:53,204
Hello to my wonderful family.

638
00:26:53,272 --> 00:26:57,747
If you're seeing this,
I'm not with you anymore.

639
00:26:57,814 --> 00:27:01,855
First of all, I just wanna say
how great, wonderful, fantastic

640
00:27:01,922 --> 00:27:04,794
it's been to be your mother,
your grandmother,

641
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:06,597
and your great-grandmother.

642
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:09,938
To every one of you,
that has been such a joy.

643
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:13,411
I also wanna say how wonderful
it was

644
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:15,482
when I fell in love with Judith.

645
00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:18,454
The four years with her
in New York

646
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:21,728
and the marriage
was absolutely wonderful.

647
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:24,033
Judith, I am sorry I had
to leave you,

648
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:26,338
but I felt I had to come home
to die,

649
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:28,375
and this is home.

650
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:29,844
I just wanna say

651
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:32,917
what sort of service
will you have for me?

652
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,090
First of all, I'm not crazy
about the traditional service.

653
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:37,794
Doesn't have to be that.

654
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,298
I don't know,
maybe I don't believe in God.

655
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:41,768
I know everybody thinks I want

656
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:43,806
to be buried
in that blue nightgown.

657
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:46,411
I don't give a shit
about the nightgown,

658
00:27:46,477 --> 00:27:48,983
so please come together

659
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:52,390
and figure out where
I want to be buried and how,

660
00:27:52,457 --> 00:27:56,130
or else no one will know
where I'm being laid to rest.

661
00:27:56,197 --> 00:28:02,042
Next, I wanted to say that I am
very disappointed in the family

662
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:04,848
in terms of what it's been
this last year.

663
00:28:04,914 --> 00:28:07,353
You've all been acting
like jackasses

664
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,056
and keeping so many secrets

665
00:28:09,123 --> 00:28:12,830
from each other, and frankly,
well, I'm sick of it.

666
00:28:12,897 --> 00:28:16,505
Secrets keep people apart,
divided and distant.

667
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,076
So I'm removing that element.

668
00:28:19,143 --> 00:28:22,884
First of all, Diane, I know
you thought that I love Bobby

669
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,489
more than you, and I didn't.

670
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:27,927
No, I loved you both the same.

671
00:28:27,994 --> 00:28:31,300
And Bobby, there is someone
that you must open up to.

672
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:34,006
You must tell them
what you're feeling.

673
00:28:34,073 --> 00:28:35,443
Do it now.

674
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:39,818
Bret, I know how hard
it's been since Megan died,

675
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,523
and you've been raising Cassidy
on your own.

676
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:44,259
It's very hard.

677
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:45,463
And I want to say, Bret,

678
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:49,404
I'm sorry I didn't invest
in your Barcalounger idea.

679
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:52,810
And also, you never paid back
any of the loans

680
00:28:52,877 --> 00:28:55,549
that so many of us gave you.

681
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:57,587
And now Katie, you and Kevin

682
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,358
have got to work
your differences out.

683
00:29:00,426 --> 00:29:02,663
And-and most of all, though,
I wanna just thank you

684
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:08,775
for taking care of me before
I moved here in this joint.

685
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:11,313
And Dorsey, I wanted to tell you

686
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,422
that I know that the allowance
I sent you helps and mostly

687
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:19,497
because Max's dad was a poop.

688
00:29:19,564 --> 00:29:23,171
And now I wanted to mention
the arcade business.

689
00:29:23,237 --> 00:29:27,212
Well, it turns out that
there was embezzlement going on,

690
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,815
and it wasn't Diane,

691
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:31,855
it wasn't Bobby,
and it wasn't me.

692
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:34,594
Robert, I just wanna say,
I wish you'd ask for money

693
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:38,670
rather than doing it that way,
but that's what happens.

694
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,775
It's not real. Is that real?

695
00:29:41,841 --> 00:29:43,646
Here's a big one
that I have to tell you.

696
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:46,652
One of you is not a sibling.

697
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,187
What the fuck?

698
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:51,662
I think I'll let you all
figure that one out together.

699
00:29:51,728 --> 00:29:54,500
And, you know, I-I think there's
something I should tell you

700
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:57,005
that I don't... I don't think
any of you ever knew

701
00:29:57,072 --> 00:29:59,142
that I wanted to be a singer.

702
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:00,479
[singing]
Duh, duh-duh, duh

703
00:30:00,546 --> 00:30:02,449
[laughs]

704
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:05,690
That should do it.
I gotta get back to being dead.

705
00:30:05,756 --> 00:30:08,929
So goodbye for now.

706
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:15,108
Um...

707
00:30:16,377 --> 00:30:17,412
I gotta go.

708
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:20,218
Whoa.

709
00:30:22,857 --> 00:30:26,397
Wow, Alex, that was not
on our itinerary.

710
00:30:26,463 --> 00:30:29,102
Is that it? Is there more
video? Or is there...

711
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:31,808
- Mm-hmm.
- Really? How many?

712
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:33,444
There's a few more
I'll send out.

713
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:36,719
I feel like
we should either start

714
00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:39,089
with Robert embezzling money...

715
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:40,458
Yeah, let's start there.

716
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:43,331
Or that one of us is not
related to the other one?

717
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:44,567
I like that one.

718
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:46,103
Mama, do you know anything
about this?

719
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,272
What is she talking about?

720
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:48,542
Do you know anything
about that? Mom?

721
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:50,378
Are you and uncle Bobby
not brother and sister?

722
00:30:50,445 --> 00:30:51,380
Mama?

723
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:52,382
Bobby?

724
00:30:52,449 --> 00:30:53,919
Yeah.

725
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,321
Do you have anything to say?

726
00:30:55,388 --> 00:30:57,425
I didn't know
that she could sing.

727
00:30:57,492 --> 00:30:59,631
That's not the important thing
right now.

728
00:30:59,698 --> 00:31:01,702
She was also a stripper
for a short period of time.

729
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:02,903
- What?
- What?

730
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,005
What the fuck
is going on here?

731
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,576
Alex, do you have
more information?

732
00:31:05,643 --> 00:31:08,280
You can't just play something
like that for us and expect us.

733
00:31:08,347 --> 00:31:09,449
- I gotta say these are...
- these things

734
00:31:09,516 --> 00:31:11,086
are usually, you know,
a little juicy,

735
00:31:11,153 --> 00:31:12,455
but this one was a doozy.

736
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:13,592
Ah, thank you, Alex.

737
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:15,630
Thank you for your
professional legal advice.

738
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:18,134
- It's Bret, isn't it?
- Why would it be me?

739
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,236
Because you don't look
like us.

740
00:31:19,302 --> 00:31:21,809
- You don't look like us at all.
- Mom?

741
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:23,945
- What?
- Is it Bret?

742
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:25,916
Robert, Dorsey, and I look
like Dad.

743
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:26,951
Katie looks like mom.

744
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,856
Bret, you look like you walked

745
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:30,024
out of the woods

746
00:31:30,091 --> 00:31:31,393
with the Wicker Man
or something.

747
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,097
Lots of kids look different
than their parents.

748
00:31:33,164 --> 00:31:35,001
- Yes, they're called adopted.
- Come on now guys.

749
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:36,872
This is... this is the opposite

750
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:38,274
of what...
of what Mabel wants, isn't it?

751
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,581
- Mom, was I adopted?
- Mom, was I adopted?

752
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,050
- This is a shit show...
- Oh, my God.

753
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:45,087
And no, no one is adopted.

754
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,958
Judith, do you wanna weigh in
on this?

755
00:31:47,025 --> 00:31:49,296
All the pillow talk with our
grandmother for four years?

756
00:31:49,362 --> 00:31:50,398
Don't you have any input?

757
00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:51,568
Yeah, Judith,
what do you know?

758
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:53,304
It's not for me to say.

759
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,041
Well, somebody's
gotta fucking say it.

760
00:31:55,107 --> 00:31:56,410
Well, I hope I'm not related
to you all.

761
00:31:56,477 --> 00:31:57,614
- I hope I'm not related.
- I understand this is hard

762
00:31:57,681 --> 00:32:00,084
to hear, but if you can
stay calm,

763
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,489
I think it's the
best way forward.

764
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:03,793
Okay.

765
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,061
Not-not blame each other.

766
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:06,463
I don't think Mabel wants that.

767
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,167
But I want you all
to know that

768
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:10,807
just because I don't have
any secrets

769
00:32:10,874 --> 00:32:13,713
doesn't mean,
I think any less of you, okay?

770
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:15,348
There's some bombshells here.

771
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:17,318
There's some digging
that needs to be done.

772
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:18,689
But if I learned anything

773
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:21,026
from my time
with the Purakara people,

774
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:23,297
it's that we're all
in this together.

775
00:32:23,364 --> 00:32:26,972
And now we've gotta unpack
some stuff, guys.

776
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:28,541
A-a lot of stuff.

777
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:31,580
And Bret, you wanna give us
our fucking money?

778
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,721
Yeah, wait, raise your hand
if you've lent money to Bret.

779
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:37,425
- Come...
- [sighs]

780
00:32:37,492 --> 00:32:40,464
I just wanna point out that
you guys have all given me shit

781
00:32:40,531 --> 00:32:42,502
for asking for investments

782
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,506
- of money in businesses...
- Loans.

783
00:32:44,573 --> 00:32:45,575
And Dorsey
has been just straight up

784
00:32:45,643 --> 00:32:47,445
getting an allowance
this whole time?

785
00:32:47,512 --> 00:32:49,215
- Did you ask her for money?
- Well, here's what happened.

786
00:32:49,282 --> 00:32:50,451
Did you ask her
for an allowance?

787
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:51,520
Okay.

788
00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:52,455
Well, Mama, of course
she asked her.

789
00:32:52,522 --> 00:32:54,292
Okay, it was a long time ago.

790
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:57,498
It was around the time...
and Max, I'm really sorry...

791
00:32:57,565 --> 00:32:58,669
it was around the time
of the divorce,

792
00:32:58,736 --> 00:33:00,404
and I just didn't wanna
have to, like,

793
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:03,310
owe Max's dad any money.

794
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:06,316
And so she offered
to give me some money.

795
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:09,289
I said that would really help.

796
00:33:09,356 --> 00:33:12,295
And then she just kind of
kept sending me

797
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:13,799
that one amount
that we talked about.

798
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,939
- So you didn't... yeah, you...
- but you didn't ask her to stop.

799
00:33:17,006 --> 00:33:19,442
Do you guys wanna maybe direct
some of your anger toward her?

800
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:20,578
- Not really...
- If you think about it...

801
00:33:20,646 --> 00:33:21,815
'Cause Dorsey
doesn't owe me money.

802
00:33:21,882 --> 00:33:23,317
You owe me money, Bret.

803
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:25,554
Yeah, and by the way,
I gave you money, Bret.

804
00:33:25,622 --> 00:33:28,193
So basically it was just like
Grandma giving you more money.

805
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,331
You made investments,
and I'm sorry

806
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:32,904
that those investments
didn't pay off.

807
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:34,572
The ideas were good.

808
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,077
- What's the idea?
- It's a Barcalounger.

809
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:37,278
There's no idea.

810
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:38,816
If it makes you happy,
I'm bankrupt.

811
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,652
I can't deal
with this right now.

812
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,889
I do wanna address one thing,

813
00:33:41,955 --> 00:33:44,961
and that is Kevin and I,
and we're fine.

814
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:48,803
And I don't know what
exactly Grandma's talking about.

815
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:50,504
- What was the thing...
- Where is Kevin?

816
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,076
That she said that you need
to work out your thing?

817
00:33:52,142 --> 00:33:55,347
- Is he living with you?
- He's been... he has the virus.

818
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:58,154
He has been in the garage
for the whole month.

819
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,489
We have to be cautious.

820
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:00,591
You don't have to be
that careful.

821
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,062
Hasn't he been tested again?

822
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:05,334
- He wants to be careful, okay?
- Let's be very clear.

823
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:07,305
Ah! God damn it! God damn it!

824
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:09,176
I'm ending this meeting,
I'm sick of this.

825
00:34:09,242 --> 00:34:10,277
Wait, you have to make
a decision.

826
00:34:10,344 --> 00:34:11,446
Katie.

827
00:34:11,513 --> 00:34:12,582
Somebody in the meeting

828
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:15,122
is not related to the family.

829
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:16,023
Make it so she can't end
the Zoom.

830
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,025
Stop.

831
00:34:17,092 --> 00:34:18,094
God damn it.

832
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:19,429
What an absolute shocker.

833
00:34:19,496 --> 00:34:22,102
- She's such a baby.
- You motherfuckers.

834
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:25,142

All the money in the world...

838
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:35,294
Thanks, Mom.

839
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:36,396
[singing]
She's such a loner,

840
00:34:36,463 --> 00:34:37,867
I can't understand

841
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:43,278
I go drink with her,
but now I can't control myself

842
00:34:43,343 --> 00:34:47,518
I get excited, and I get upset

843
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,960
And
all the underworld officers...

844
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:54,768
- Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!
- I'm tired.

845
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:56,872
Why is your brother
screaming every second?

846
00:34:56,939 --> 00:34:58,776
No one can do one thing
without me.

847
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:01,080
Stop filming me.

848
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:02,582
Look how crazy my mom is.

849
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:03,819
What are you doing?

850
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:05,622
You're supposed to be doing
Zoom school.

851
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:09,429
What the hell are you doing?
I said stop filming me!

852
00:35:09,495 --> 00:35:12,603
We all cope or don't cope
in different way.

853
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:16,744
I swear to God,
if you film me one more time...

854
00:35:16,812 --> 00:35:20,786
And during the lockdown,
it was mostly not coping.

00:35:22,924 --> 00:35:27,800
would refer to this as
an amplified reprimand.

857
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:29,971
Her kids just thought
she had lost it.

858
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:31,539
[mouthing words]

859
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:38,520
- Max, what is that?
- What are you doing?

860
00:35:38,587 --> 00:35:39,723
Nothing.

861
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:42,428
- I can smell that.
- Give it to me.

862
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:44,066
It's just a little weed, Mom.

863
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:45,402
You're smoking weed?

864
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,706
- It helps calm my nerves.
- I don't.

865
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:49,376
- How do you have nerves?
- You're 17.

866
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:50,913
And I'm right there.

867
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,117
Are you, like, not scared
of me at all?

868
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,521
- [sighs] I'm sorry.
- Where did you get it?

869
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:56,959
I got it in LA.

870
00:35:57,025 --> 00:35:59,163
You brought it in there
with us?

871
00:35:59,229 --> 00:36:01,701
- Yeah.
- What if I got pulled over?

872
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:02,870
I would have to lie.

873
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:05,075
I would have to say
that it is mine

874
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:07,914
and that I was endangering
the life of my child.

875
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:11,354
And you would get taken away
from me forever.

876
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,391
Maybe, I mean, that's a little
extreme 'cause you're old,

877
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:15,863
but, like, how long
have you been smoking weed?

878
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,303
Not too long, just since
the start of the pandemic.

879
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,571
You're endangering us.

880
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:21,640
I didn't really think of it
like that.

881
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:24,413
- And your brain cells.
- I'm sorry.

882
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,817
And you're not even sharing.

883
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,254
- I mean.
- Just kidding.

884
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:30,058
The world's a bunch of shit
right now.

885
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,794
I mean, I... thinking
about my future

886
00:36:31,862 --> 00:36:33,866
and everything going on,

887
00:36:33,932 --> 00:36:36,303
- it's-it's-it's a hell of a lot.
- The world isn't shit.

888
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,476
It's really... maybe, like, right
this exact second,

889
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:40,913
but everything changes.

890
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,416
Things change so fast,
and, honey,

891
00:36:42,482 --> 00:36:44,753
you don't have to know anything
about your life right now.

892
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,958
And then things are supposed
to suck when you're 17

893
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:47,994
'cause if they're
really great now,

894
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:49,797
then where do you go from here?

895
00:36:49,864 --> 00:36:52,769
Imagine if this is the best year
of your life,

896
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,306
then how much is that
gonna solve?

897
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:56,510
I mean, my dad is-is a poop.

898
00:36:56,576 --> 00:36:58,514
I mean, and to be... you're
all I got.

899
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,652
And to be fair, you're a poop
too sometimes, but...

900
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,122
No, I get it. I know.

901
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:04,293
You're less of a shit
than he is.

902
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,736
- I'm gonna go in there.
- Why don't you take a walk?

903
00:37:09,803 --> 00:37:10,839
Actually, why don't we go?

904
00:37:10,906 --> 00:37:12,542
I'm really hungry
all of a sudden.

905
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:15,748
- Okay.
- Do you wanna just... wait.

906
00:37:15,815 --> 00:37:17,719
It's gonna get better.

907
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:19,089
I doubt it.

908
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,260
Sammy, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy,
say it with me.

909
00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:22,729
I love paper towels.

910
00:37:22,796 --> 00:37:24,901
Think of everything
you use them for.

911
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:26,972
Think of everything
that you haven't used them for,

912
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:30,812
but you will,
and if you can't do that,

913
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:34,086
I-I-I would move on
right onto paper boxes.

914
00:37:34,153 --> 00:37:37,225
[phone buzzing]
Yeah, yeah.

915
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:38,394
Hey, listen to me.
You know what?

916
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:39,763
I'm getting a call.

917
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,100
We will talk soon.

918
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:45,542
Think about what I said.
Thank you.

919
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:46,544
Hi.

920
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:47,647
Hello.

921
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:49,516
How are you?

922
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:51,153
I have been better.

923
00:37:54,193 --> 00:37:56,530
You know, you're gonna have
to deal with it.

924
00:37:56,597 --> 00:37:57,934
Excuse me.

925
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,104
I think you're right in there
with me.

926
00:38:00,171 --> 00:38:01,407
I'm aware.

927
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:05,815
I really just cleaned up
your shit after you abdicated.

928
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:07,219
Thank you.

929
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:12,262
I-I just called to see
how you were doing and...

930
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:13,898
[sighs]

931
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:20,111
[solemn music]

932
00:38:21,013 --> 00:38:22,816
Good talk. Thanks.

933
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:29,529
They can't keep it
on the shelves.

934
00:38:29,596 --> 00:38:31,968
Thank you, God. Yes.

935
00:38:32,035 --> 00:38:36,010
My book is number one
in North Dakota and Nebraska?

936
00:38:37,747 --> 00:38:39,182
Oh, thank you, God.

937
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:40,918
Thank you, God.
I can't believe this.

938
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:41,954
- Chad!
- Yes, thank you God.

939
00:38:42,022 --> 00:38:43,824
This is God.

940
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:46,330
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

941
00:38:46,397 --> 00:38:49,737
but it's not all about you,
is it?

942
00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:51,106
It's about the money
you will give

943
00:38:51,173 --> 00:38:53,311
to your brother, Robert.

944
00:38:58,421 --> 00:38:59,556
Not funny, Robert.

945
00:38:59,624 --> 00:39:00,993
I think it's pretty cute.

946
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,732
How long have you been
inside of my security system?

947
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:07,238
- I was always here, my son.
- Even with the pornography.

948
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:10,378
- That is not cool.
- You voyeuristic pervert.

949
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:12,916
Do you understand me?
Quit hacking our shit.

950
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:14,386
Okay, I mean I'm not.

951
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:16,090
- No one likes it.
- No, but it's a thing.

952
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:17,959
It's like a... it's like
you don't get it

953
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:19,664
when normal people get it.

954
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:20,833
Do you know what I mean by that?

955
00:39:20,898 --> 00:39:24,004
No, but yes, but no.

956
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:25,609
Anyway, dude, I miss you.

957
00:39:25,676 --> 00:39:27,579
I was calling to say hey to
my big bro.

958
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:29,950
Yeah, well, it's a weird way
to do it, man.

959
00:39:30,016 --> 00:39:32,088
Hi, how are you?

960
00:39:32,155 --> 00:39:37,132
- I'm really lonely.
- Really cold.

961
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:38,668
Hey, I read your book.

962
00:39:38,735 --> 00:39:40,338
- Really?
- Yeah.

963
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:43,812
- Well.
- It's really good.

964
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:47,318
It's very data-driven,
I would say,

965
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,289
which is not usually my...

966
00:39:49,356 --> 00:39:52,696
It's my personal retelling
of a traumatic event in my life.

967
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:54,801
It's not data-driven.
I mean, that happened.

968
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:58,574
A javelin came through and
stabbed me in my torso cavity.

969
00:39:58,642 --> 00:40:00,578
This is really great
and long-winded.

970
00:40:00,646 --> 00:40:02,047
I read it in the book.

971
00:40:02,115 --> 00:40:03,317
Fantastic. I love it.

972
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:06,423
Millimeters, Robert, okay?

973
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:10,064
Chad would find out later
that the-the success of his book

974
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:13,971
was due to a glitch
in an algorithm at Amazon.

975
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:17,646
And Robert will later take
credit for that said glitch.

976
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:18,581
Moving in and I knew it.

977
00:40:18,648 --> 00:40:21,186
I have, you know,
and I got myself up.

978
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,690
Not to mention I just felt
an outhouse

979
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:23,524
for these people, so...

980
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:25,228
Do you remember
when we watched...

981
00:40:25,294 --> 00:40:27,232
we watched "The Omen,"

982
00:40:27,298 --> 00:40:28,434
and Mom yelled down,

983
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:29,770
and they're like,
"Is everything okay?"

984
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:32,275
And Bret was in the corner,
vomiting from it.

985
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:33,979
I mean, that was "Goonies,"
but yeah.

986
00:40:34,044 --> 00:40:35,314
But any... anyway,
I'm just calling

987
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:37,318
because Bret and I want
to play "PUBG."

988
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:40,258
So if you're
down, meet you in five.

989
00:40:40,324 --> 00:40:41,961
Yeah, right now?

990
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:45,201
- I said, meet you in five.
- That indicates five minutes.

991
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:47,338
- Okay.
- Kevin!

992
00:40:49,644 --> 00:40:50,578
I'm exhausted.

993
00:40:50,646 --> 00:40:53,417
I mean, look, we gotta tell
the kids.

994
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:57,726
How? Like just tear
the Band-Aid off, like, tonight?

995
00:40:57,793 --> 00:40:58,828
Yeah, okay.

996
00:40:58,895 --> 00:41:00,096
All right.

997
00:41:00,164 --> 00:41:03,939
And then you gotta...
you gotta go.

998
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:07,211
- Leave here?
- No, go.

999
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:10,151
Oh, nah.

1000
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,486
No, go.

1001
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,089
Take your fucking stuff
and get it out.

1002
00:41:13,157 --> 00:41:15,796
I love it here. Love it.

1003
00:41:15,862 --> 00:41:17,565
What are you possibly
talking about?

1004
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:20,071
I'm finally myself, like,
I've found my voice.

1005
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:23,344
- Now you're finding yourself.
- And what is yourself look like?

1006
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,414
I've grown more confident.

1007
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:27,820
I think I've found, like,
the truth.

1008
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:29,522
Okay, get-get the fuck out,
Kevin.

1009
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:30,792
I'm gonna go back into my home
when

1010
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:32,328
I feel, like, comfortable
with myself.

1011
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:33,965
Okay, my brothers will come
and remove you.

1012
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:35,101
- Okay.
- Bye.

1013
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,303
- That's doubtful, but...
- Start packing.

1014
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,940
- Let 'em try.
- [chuckles]

1015
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:39,042
- Ugh.
- What?

1016
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:40,846
I said, ugh!

1017
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:46,858
[upbeat music]

1018
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:06,363
Boo. I'm a ghost. Hi, family.

1019
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,233
Something tells me that
you still

1020
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,972
haven't figured out
where to bury me.

1021
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:12,743
I'm tired, kids.

1022
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,116
Can you hurry it up?
Now, how could I forget?

1023
00:42:16,183 --> 00:42:20,257
I-I have not mentioned yet
my great-grandchildren,

1024
00:42:20,324 --> 00:42:23,732
but Max and Cassidy,
it's now your turn.

1025
00:42:23,798 --> 00:42:27,206
Maxwell,
stop downloading so much porn.

1026
00:42:27,271 --> 00:42:28,808
I mean, you can stream it,

1027
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:31,012
but downloading,
that means your mom

1028
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,620
has to buy you a new computer
about every 18 months,

1029
00:42:34,687 --> 00:42:37,659
and her allowance
isn't that much.

1030
00:42:37,726 --> 00:42:39,964
And Bret, you really should
pay attention

1031
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,401
to your credit card bills.

1032
00:42:42,468 --> 00:42:46,176
Right, Cassidy? My sugar plum.

1033
00:42:46,244 --> 00:42:49,482
And Bobby, hey, how's it going?

1034
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:51,520
Got anything
you wanna talk about?

1035
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:54,058
Your own little secret?

1036
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:56,898
Also, we are rich.

1037
00:42:56,964 --> 00:43:02,074
I mean really filthy stinking,
fucking rich.

1038
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:03,812
Goodbye.

1039
00:43:05,447 --> 00:43:07,351
- Okay.
- Max.

1040
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,357
Cassidy? Cassidy?

1041
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:11,560
Cassidy, open up.

1042
00:43:11,627 --> 00:43:13,698
Have you been using
my credit cards?

1043
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:15,367
Mom, what does she mean
by rich?

1044
00:43:15,434 --> 00:43:17,071
- It's-it's news.
- It's news to me.

1045
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:18,608
- Like, how rich?
- And, Bobby, is it news to you?

1046
00:43:18,675 --> 00:43:20,411
- What does that mean?
- I have no idea.

1047
00:43:20,477 --> 00:43:22,348
Is it enough money
if someone wanted

1048
00:43:22,415 --> 00:43:24,286
to start a life on their own?

1049
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,622
Just let's say someone,

1050
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:27,292
maybe didn't
wanna be married to the person

1051
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:29,128
that they're married to anymore
and they had three kids.

1052
00:43:29,195 --> 00:43:31,032
Like, would it be enough money
for that person?

1053
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:34,005
Or maybe enough money to stop
taking money from your grandma?

1054
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:36,944
Are we talking about, like,
if somebody on this list

1055
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:39,750
wanted to do a little nip
and tuck and a little pull up

1056
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,386
and a ring light
that just, like,

1057
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:42,322
hovers around them
all the time...

1058
00:43:42,388 --> 00:43:43,725
Not cool. Not cool.

1059
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:47,733
- Is it that kind of rich?
- Uh, not that rich.

1060
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:49,737
If anyone's gonna get a lot
of money, it's me.

1061
00:43:49,803 --> 00:43:51,106
I'd be worried
if I were some of y'all.

1062
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:53,745
Judith, yeah, what does
she mean by rich, rich?

1063
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:55,147
- That's not for me to say.
- I'm-I'm afraid.

1064
00:43:55,214 --> 00:43:58,053
- It's not for you to say?
- Not for you to say?

1065
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,424
- [all speaking at once]
- Say something. Come on.

1066
00:44:00,491 --> 00:44:01,928
- Oh, my God.
- Judith?

1067
00:44:01,994 --> 00:44:04,065
- Guys, get your shit together.
- Judith? Judith?

1068
00:44:04,132 --> 00:44:06,069
Like, what are we doing
wasting time like this?

1069
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:07,706
Wait, wait.

1070
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:11,079
Way to go, Chad. Now she's gone.

1071
00:44:11,146 --> 00:44:15,154
Nothing like an inheritance
to get the family greed boiling.

1072
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,891
But I think Mabel's lying.

1073
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:20,699
There are many definitions
of rich.

1074
00:44:20,765 --> 00:44:22,068
That's her body.

1075
00:44:22,134 --> 00:44:25,342
Task Rabbit, whoo!
Up you go. Let's go.

1076
00:44:25,408 --> 00:44:28,013
Follow that hearse, honey.
Let's go. Come on, now.

1077
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,883
- Up you go. Follow that hearse.
- All right.

1078
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,188
- Go, go, go, go.
- All right.

1079
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:34,192
Follow the hearse.

1080
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:35,628
Oh, Jesus.

1081
00:44:35,695 --> 00:44:38,066
It's harder than it looks,
Judith.

1082
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,336
[phone ringing]
This hearse is a lot faster

1083
00:44:39,403 --> 00:44:41,539
than I am.

1084
00:44:41,607 --> 00:44:43,845
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hi, listen, Judith.

1085
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:46,884
I am so sorry that it's under
these circumstances,

1086
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:49,255
but I'm very happy
to be able to talk to you.

1087
00:44:49,322 --> 00:44:51,460
I'm a little busy
at the moment, Bobby.

1088
00:44:51,526 --> 00:44:52,729
So what's-what's up?

1089
00:44:52,796 --> 00:44:54,400
I just wanted to know

1090
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:59,075
how Mom felt about me,
actually, is the question.

1091
00:44:59,142 --> 00:45:01,514
I think she wanted you
to come home,

1092
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:03,818
and you never did that.

1093
00:45:03,885 --> 00:45:05,688
So I think she was hurt.

1094
00:45:05,755 --> 00:45:08,026
The last thing I wanted to do
was to hurt her.

1095
00:45:08,093 --> 00:45:11,166
I couldn't come home.
If-if I could, I would've.

1096
00:45:11,232 --> 00:45:13,404
You know what, hey,
it's-it's not about me.

1097
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:15,074
How are you?

1098
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,746
Well, I'm heartbroken,
actually.

1099
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:22,656
I loved your mother very much,
and I don't know

1100
00:45:22,722 --> 00:45:26,764
that I will ever get over not
being with her when she died.

1101
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:28,868
Well, I mean, you were there
with us on the Zoom.

1102
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,139
- No, no, no, no.
- She didn't want me there.

1103
00:45:31,206 --> 00:45:35,782
That act of pushing you away
was a demonstration of love.

1104
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:38,353
She-she knew
she was going to die.

1105
00:45:38,421 --> 00:45:41,827
She knew that was going
to just break your heart in two.

1106
00:45:41,894 --> 00:45:43,130
I see what you're saying,

1107
00:45:43,196 --> 00:45:45,067
but I have to say
it still hurts.

1108
00:45:45,134 --> 00:45:46,937
- It sounds painful.
- Oh, God.

1109
00:45:47,004 --> 00:45:48,941
- Who is that?
- Never mind. Never mind.

1110
00:45:49,008 --> 00:45:50,613
- Never mind?
- Is somebody else on the line?

1111
00:45:50,678 --> 00:45:52,682
Oh, shit. Oh, wait.

1112
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,352
Then I gotta make... I gotta make
a U-turn.

1113
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,356
- She's doing a task for me.
- An errand.

1114
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:57,926
God please let me make
the roller derby team.

1115
00:45:57,993 --> 00:45:59,663
Just don't-don't-don't worry
about it.

1116
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:04,641
Listen, I think that if she knew
what you were contemplating,

1117
00:46:04,706 --> 00:46:07,411
I think she would tell you
to do it

1118
00:46:07,479 --> 00:46:09,516
and that she's proud of you.

1119
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:10,752
Thank you, thank you.

1120
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:13,491
She sounds like
a really amazing woman.

1121
00:46:13,558 --> 00:46:15,428
Oh, my... okay.

1122
00:46:15,495 --> 00:46:16,897
My mother was
the complete opposite.

1123
00:46:16,964 --> 00:46:18,801
- You're welcome, Bobby.
- You're welcome.

1124
00:46:18,868 --> 00:46:20,204
She didn't like anything
I did.

1125
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,840
Oh, Task... whoo!

1126
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:23,679
[Jessica sobbing]
Task Rabbit, snap out of it now.

1127
00:46:23,744 --> 00:46:24,880
Come on now.

1128
00:46:24,947 --> 00:46:27,284
I think you have to track
that body.

1129
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,689
Okay, I'm sorry.

1130
00:46:28,754 --> 00:46:30,157
Look ahead.

1131
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:33,731
Look where you're going.
Yes, is that the funeral home?

1132
00:46:33,798 --> 00:46:35,868
Wait, I think I see
the funeral home.

1133
00:46:35,935 --> 00:46:39,141
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God. I did it.

1134
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:41,179
I did... I may have
to charge extra, Judith.

1135
00:46:41,246 --> 00:46:42,314
I'm exhausted.

1136
00:46:42,381 --> 00:46:43,484
- Judith?
- Yes.

1137
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:46,155
Are you following the body?

1138
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:47,892
That's exactly
what she's doing, yes.

1139
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:49,997
Look, I miss her,
and I wanna...

1140
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:52,769
I wanna know where her body is

1141
00:46:52,836 --> 00:46:54,873
until we bury her properly.

1142
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,242
That's sweet.

1143
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:58,881
I'm sorry to say this
to you, Bobby.

1144
00:46:58,948 --> 00:47:00,485
I think your mother believed

1145
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,557
that the family
that she knew and loved was dead

1146
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:09,235
and that what you need to do
is to begin again as a family

1147
00:47:09,302 --> 00:47:14,445
and to do that with the truth,
is that making sense?

1148
00:47:14,513 --> 00:47:15,480
Yeah, yeah, it does.

1149
00:47:15,548 --> 00:47:16,917
I think maybe this is
a good time

1150
00:47:16,984 --> 00:47:19,088
for me to... for me to go.

1151
00:47:19,155 --> 00:47:21,593
- Whoo-hoo.
- This task is not complete.

1152
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:22,697
- Geez, fine.
- Okay?

1153
00:47:22,763 --> 00:47:24,265
So I'll just let you know.

1154
00:47:24,332 --> 00:47:26,302
I need you to keep streaming.
Bobby.

1155
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:29,475
- Yes, yes.
- I have to go. Bye, now.

1156
00:47:29,543 --> 00:47:35,454
[upbeat music]

1157
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:45,642
Eww. Max, stop it.

1158
00:47:47,344 --> 00:47:49,415
You can't just fart in here.

1159
00:47:49,482 --> 00:47:52,354
[device chiming]

1160
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:53,591
Hey, Mama.

1161
00:47:53,658 --> 00:47:55,561
Still the only one
who calls me on that thing.

1162
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:59,068
- I'm on your fridge again?
- I called your regular email.

1163
00:47:59,135 --> 00:48:01,205
Yeah, yeah, well,
you can't call an email,

1164
00:48:01,272 --> 00:48:03,577
and you email
my college email still,

1165
00:48:03,645 --> 00:48:06,516
which is just like
a burner sign up email.

1166
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,891
Forget it. What's up?

1167
00:48:09,956 --> 00:48:11,828
How are the kids?

1168
00:48:11,895 --> 00:48:13,765
They're good.

1169
00:48:13,832 --> 00:48:18,039
Just hoping...
it's just Zoom school is so...

1170
00:48:19,911 --> 00:48:21,145
What?

1171
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:24,151
I may have made a mistake,

1172
00:48:24,218 --> 00:48:26,022
and I wanted
to talk to you about it.

1173
00:48:26,088 --> 00:48:28,059
Okay.

1174
00:48:28,126 --> 00:48:29,797
I know this pandemic's
got me...

1175
00:48:29,864 --> 00:48:31,432
it's smooshing me.

1176
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:34,238
It's-it's... I mean,
it's, like, some...

1177
00:48:34,305 --> 00:48:38,446
some kind of inner jelly
is spilling through.

1178
00:48:38,513 --> 00:48:41,118
Wait, what
are you talking about?

1179
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:44,391
Small mistakes can be fixed.

1180
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,798
Big mistakes, some are so big
that they...

1181
00:48:46,865 --> 00:48:49,201
you can't even see them.

1182
00:48:49,268 --> 00:48:51,572
They're so big
they change everything.

1183
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:54,345
They change you.

1184
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:59,188
- Mama, okay, what happened?
- What?

1185
00:48:59,255 --> 00:49:02,261
Do you have, like,
an entire second family

1186
00:49:02,327 --> 00:49:03,932
or something
that we don't even know about?

1187
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,367
No.

1188
00:49:05,433 --> 00:49:10,544
- Okay, then what is it?
- Katie, I...

1189
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:17,157
I wanted to tell you that I...

1190
00:49:18,259 --> 00:49:21,132
[kids yelling and laughing]

1191
00:49:21,198 --> 00:49:23,303
Mama, I gotta call you back.

1192
00:49:26,409 --> 00:49:27,980
Stay away from that rooster!

1193
00:49:28,047 --> 00:49:29,248
To the west,
to the west toilet.

1194
00:49:29,315 --> 00:49:30,752
Three guys.

1195
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:32,856
Hey, can you guys drop ammo
for me?

1196
00:49:32,923 --> 00:49:34,961
Ammo, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha,
gotcha. Top tower.

1197
00:49:35,027 --> 00:49:38,433
No, not yet. Not yet.

1198
00:49:38,499 --> 00:49:39,770
- Got 'em.
- All right.

1199
00:49:39,837 --> 00:49:41,073
On the count of three.

1200
00:49:41,138 --> 00:49:44,445
- Boom, baby.
- You got...

1201
00:49:44,511 --> 00:49:45,547
Do you think
we should have tried

1202
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:46,818
to play video games
with Mabel?

1203
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:49,957
- Every shot is a headshot.
- [laughs]

1204
00:49:50,024 --> 00:49:51,492
I miss her.

1205
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:52,594
What if we brought her on
and she just fucking owned?

1206
00:49:52,663 --> 00:49:55,133
- She really was.
- She's kooky as shit.

1207
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,535
She was fun, though.

1208
00:49:56,603 --> 00:49:58,306
Remember that time
that she gave you whiskey

1209
00:49:58,373 --> 00:49:59,541
for your 16th birthday

1210
00:49:59,609 --> 00:50:02,180
and Dad got so mad at her?

1211
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:04,184
- Yeah.
- Hey, Bret, I gotta ask you,

1212
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,355
what is going on
with Cassidy's make up?

1213
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:08,259
Oh, my gosh. Yes.

1214
00:50:08,326 --> 00:50:09,495
- I mean.
- Details.

1215
00:50:09,561 --> 00:50:10,597
Being a teenager is hard

1216
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:12,135
these days, you know
what I mean?

1217
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,269
Especially right now.

1218
00:50:13,336 --> 00:50:14,571
Can't see your friends,
you know,

1219
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:16,475
she's worried about the
funeral.

1220
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:18,413
One thing I remember
when I was growing up,

1221
00:50:18,479 --> 00:50:20,017
Mom used to tell me

1222
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:24,458
that the kind of guys she liked,
were, like, the gentlemen

1223
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:25,593
who treated her nice

1224
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:26,898
and pulled out her chair
and stuff.

1225
00:50:26,964 --> 00:50:28,466
But really what I realized now
in hindsight is

1226
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:29,636
what she was doing is,

1227
00:50:29,704 --> 00:50:32,340
she was basically telling
me how to be.

1228
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:34,112
So maybe you could use some

1229
00:50:34,179 --> 00:50:36,884
subversive kind of stuff
on Cassidy

1230
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:39,622
and say, like, how much
you enjoyed it

1231
00:50:39,689 --> 00:50:42,128
when women don't wear makeup.

1232
00:50:42,195 --> 00:50:44,700
- She's a pretty smart kid.
- I feel like she's gonna see

1233
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:47,138
right through that
and, like, use some sort of,

1234
00:50:47,205 --> 00:50:49,308
like, judo, reverse psychology

1235
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:51,079
and turn my own energy
back on me

1236
00:50:51,146 --> 00:50:53,083
and all of a sudden,
I'll be wearing makeup.

1237
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,422
Okay, let's move
to the southwest quadrant.

1238
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:57,658
There's no one here.

1239
00:50:57,726 --> 00:51:00,064
Robert, are you feeling
safe out there

1240
00:51:00,131 --> 00:51:03,569
or do you feel like the pipe
fitter's union is after you?

1241
00:51:03,637 --> 00:51:05,007
The pipe fitter's union
is after all of us.

1242
00:51:05,074 --> 00:51:08,412
It's the only thing other than...
seriously plumbing?

1243
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:09,682
Are you kidding me?

1244
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:10,752
That's the only thing
that connects all of us.

1245
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:12,688
What other thing connects all?

1246
00:51:12,756 --> 00:51:14,291
- The internet.
- God.

1247
00:51:14,358 --> 00:51:15,962
God and electricity.

1248
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:17,297
Dude, it pairs.

1249
00:51:17,364 --> 00:51:18,868
It's-it's one
and the same thing.

1250
00:51:18,935 --> 00:51:20,939
I'm completely ignoring
what you're saying, Robert,

1251
00:51:21,006 --> 00:51:24,478
just like the entire world
completely ignored your leak.

1252
00:51:24,545 --> 00:51:26,116
[in Russian accent]
You could go fuck yourself.

1253
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:28,020
[laughs]

1254
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:30,057
Robert, how often do you go
outside in Moscow?

1255
00:51:30,124 --> 00:51:31,660
Every morning and stuff.

1256
00:51:31,726 --> 00:51:32,996
I do have to say, like,

1257
00:51:33,063 --> 00:51:34,531
the best part of my day
is waking up

1258
00:51:34,598 --> 00:51:37,537
and just, like, smelling
the honeysuckles out there.

1259
00:51:37,605 --> 00:51:39,075
They have honeysuckle
in Russia?

1260
00:51:39,142 --> 00:51:41,079
Yeah, every place
has the honeysuckles, I mean...

1261
00:51:41,146 --> 00:51:42,380
You're talking about the farm
or Moscow?

1262
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:43,918
Moscow.

1263
00:51:43,985 --> 00:51:46,022
It just reminds me of the farm
back at home,

1264
00:51:46,089 --> 00:51:49,028
and it-it was
just... it brings me, you know,

1265
00:51:49,095 --> 00:51:53,436
great memories of, you know,
visiting it when we were young.

1266
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,911
You guys, I'm gonna
hit the bathroom real quick.

1267
00:51:56,978 --> 00:51:58,915
- What?
- Drop-drop your guns real fast.

1268
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,720
- Oh. There you go.
- So I'll take 'em.

1269
00:52:01,787 --> 00:52:04,092
Okay, Chaddy, it's me and you.

1270
00:52:04,158 --> 00:52:07,966
I actually am going
to the bathroom as well.

1271
00:52:08,033 --> 00:52:09,669
Guys, come on.

1272
00:52:09,736 --> 00:52:11,306
The round's only
10 more minutes.

1273
00:52:11,373 --> 00:52:12,608
Dookie break.

1274
00:52:12,675 --> 00:52:15,247
My brothers abandon me
in a graveyard

1275
00:52:15,314 --> 00:52:18,654
where I am alone to die,

1276
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,427
and now I'm... I am completely
talking to myself.

1277
00:52:22,494 --> 00:52:23,798
You're not taking a poop?

1278
00:52:23,865 --> 00:52:25,768
I don't think Robert's
in Russia.

1279
00:52:25,835 --> 00:52:27,906
- What are you talking about?
- I think he's at the farm.

1280
00:52:27,973 --> 00:52:29,709
You think Robert
is at the farm?

1281
00:52:29,776 --> 00:52:31,146
The other day, he had a mug

1282
00:52:31,212 --> 00:52:32,782
that looked
exactly like Grandpa's,

1283
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,218
and when we asked him
to hold it up,

1284
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:36,588
he, like, covered it with
his hand, which was super weird.

1285
00:52:36,656 --> 00:52:37,993
Like, why wouldn't he
just show it to us?

1286
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,498
So unless he went to the farm,
got Grandpa's mug

1287
00:52:41,565 --> 00:52:44,504
before going... before fleeing
to Russia.

1288
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:45,909
That's entirely possible.

1289
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:48,280
Fleeing to Russia
for a leak about plumbing?

1290
00:52:48,347 --> 00:52:49,481
Like, nobody has to do that.

1291
00:52:49,548 --> 00:52:50,952
Like, Snowden
had to go to Russia.

1292
00:52:51,019 --> 00:52:52,990
Like, he, like, he leaked
some bad shit.

1293
00:52:53,056 --> 00:52:55,194
Nobody cares
about Robert's thing.

1294
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,631
Also, he just said something
about a honeysuckle like,

1295
00:52:57,698 --> 00:52:59,369
do they have honeysuckle
in Russia?

1296
00:52:59,435 --> 00:53:00,637
Okay, I don't know, dude.

1297
00:53:00,704 --> 00:53:02,876
He's a pretty big deal
in this hacking world.

1298
00:53:02,943 --> 00:53:05,014
Like, these guys, these nerds,
they-they really get

1299
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,387
on each other's backs,
and I'm-I'm not sure.

1300
00:53:08,453 --> 00:53:10,791
Could you just drive out there
and see if he's there?

1301
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:13,130
No, dude, we're in the middle
of a pandemic, dude.

1302
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:14,432
Just get out there,
put a mask on.

1303
00:53:14,499 --> 00:53:15,834
See if he's there. I can't go.

1304
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:17,570
I have Cassidy.
I gotta look after her.

1305
00:53:17,638 --> 00:53:18,941
Well, I have obligations too.

1306
00:53:19,008 --> 00:53:20,244
Come on,
you gotta do... just do it.

1307
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:21,112
What does it look like...

1308
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:22,515
Dudes, dudes,
what's happening?

1309
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,352
Come on. Are we not playing?

1310
00:53:24,419 --> 00:53:25,521
I finished up in the bathroom.

1311
00:53:25,586 --> 00:53:26,856
I just had a quick question
for Chad.

1312
00:53:26,924 --> 00:53:28,660
But why are you FaceTiming
each other

1313
00:53:28,727 --> 00:53:30,230
while going to the bathroom?

1314
00:53:30,297 --> 00:53:33,103
Kinda got sidetracked
in the restroom.

1315
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,109
It doesn't look like you're
pooping, though, Bret.

1316
00:53:36,176 --> 00:53:39,215
I just had a quick question
for Chad about the-the funeral.

1317
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:42,587
I just wanted to run it by him
before we got back in there.

1318
00:53:42,655 --> 00:53:46,096
- Yeah.
- That makes no sense, Bret.

1319
00:53:46,162 --> 00:53:48,333
Well, what makes sense
these days?

1320
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,139
Everybody's inside
for six months, so.

1321
00:53:51,206 --> 00:53:52,274
Okay, you guys
are being weird.

1322
00:53:52,341 --> 00:53:53,543
Come on, let's go back
to the game.

1323
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:54,913
This is stupid.

1324
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,783
- Robert.
- What?

1325
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:58,320
Real quick, what's
the temperature

1326
00:53:58,386 --> 00:54:00,224
right now in Moscow?

1327
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:03,430
22 degrees centigrade.

1328
00:54:03,497 --> 00:54:05,868
- Cool.
- Yeah?

1329
00:54:05,935 --> 00:54:07,538
- Yeah.
- Let's play this game.

1330
00:54:07,606 --> 00:54:10,477
All right, I will see you
on the battlefield.

1331
00:54:10,544 --> 00:54:11,779
You guys are weird.

1332
00:54:11,846 --> 00:54:12,949
I have the weirdest brothers
in the world.

1333
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:22,034
[upbeat rock music]

1334
00:54:22,101 --> 00:54:23,470
Hey.

1335
00:54:23,537 --> 00:54:24,906
- Hey.
- Nice night.

1336
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:26,509
I'm out here just getting
some fresh air,

1337
00:54:26,576 --> 00:54:28,413
having some free time.

1338
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,482
Eat my gummy worms, you know.

1339
00:54:29,549 --> 00:54:31,152
My dad's currently
freaking out right now

1340
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:33,690
because of Grandma's secret
sharing sessions.

1341
00:54:33,757 --> 00:54:34,960
- How do you know?
- I never really knew her.

1342
00:54:35,027 --> 00:54:36,362
Of course, I did.
Of course, I knew grandma.

1343
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:37,298
I spent more time with her.

1344
00:54:37,364 --> 00:54:40,437
She's so much fun
and smart too.

1345
00:54:40,504 --> 00:54:44,812
My mom did tell me, though,
that her favorite sandwich

1346
00:54:44,879 --> 00:54:47,117
was banana and mayonnaise.

1347
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:50,557
- And I've seen her eat them.
- It's disgusting.

1348
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,828
What-what are you doing?

1349
00:54:52,895 --> 00:54:54,765
- Chilling.
- That's cool.

1350
00:54:54,832 --> 00:54:56,670
Statistically speaking,
over the years,

1351
00:54:56,736 --> 00:55:01,079
it's-it's been harder to get
young adults to leave the nest,

1352
00:55:01,145 --> 00:55:05,787
but after months of being safer
at home with their parents,

1353
00:55:05,854 --> 00:55:08,426
those statistics
would probably change.

1354
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,736
Hello, I'm calling
about Mabel Worth?

1355
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:14,973
Alex, hi, hi.

1356
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,346
- How are we burying her?
- What's-what's the plan?

1357
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:21,185
- You know what?
- We're still working on it.

1358
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:22,588
All right, well,
you're outta time.

1359
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:24,492
All right, look, I'm only
contracted for a few more days,

1360
00:55:24,558 --> 00:55:26,062
and then we're handing her back
to you in a...

1361
00:55:26,129 --> 00:55:27,865
in a brown box, okay?

1362
00:55:27,931 --> 00:55:30,370
That's nice. We... yes.

1363
00:55:30,437 --> 00:55:32,975
I'm gonna call you soon.
Very soon.

1364
00:55:34,979 --> 00:55:36,115
That was too rude.

1365
00:55:36,182 --> 00:55:37,851
I'm so sorry.
I should call her back.

1366
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:41,092
Mommy! Mommy!

1367
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:44,498
- [phone rings]
- Alex.

1368
00:55:44,565 --> 00:55:47,304
- Yeah, sorry-sorry.
- That-that was so rude.

1369
00:55:47,371 --> 00:55:49,975
Uh, I just need the family
to decide.

1370
00:55:50,043 --> 00:55:53,016
[upbeat rock music]

1371
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,820
[The Shacks' "Wings"]

1372
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:56,856
[singing]
Come on, everybody

1373
00:55:56,923 --> 00:55:59,328
Ooh, let's have a good time

1374
00:55:59,395 --> 00:56:04,171
Separate the clouds
and celebrate the sunshine

1375
00:56:04,238 --> 00:56:09,248
Livin' day-to-day,
I said I have a good time

1376
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:14,325
Left, right, left, another step
'cause life's a straight line

1377
00:56:14,392 --> 00:56:20,137
Won't somebody new take me
far away?

1378
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:29,054
I want to start this off
by saying I know exactly

1379
00:56:29,121 --> 00:56:31,860
where Mother wants to be buried.

1380
00:56:31,926 --> 00:56:33,563
She wants to be buried
at the farm.

1381
00:56:33,631 --> 00:56:37,003
- No.
- Yes, agreed. Yes, she did.

1382
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:40,410
I think we should bury Mom
at sea

1383
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:42,548
because the Buddhist point
of view

1384
00:56:42,615 --> 00:56:45,822
is that water is cleansing,
and it is also the element...

1385
00:56:45,888 --> 00:56:47,157
She's not Buddhist.

1386
00:56:47,224 --> 00:56:48,993
Bobby, maybe you can
bury yourself at sea.

1387
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:50,363
Stop, come on.

1388
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:51,867
I would like to just say

1389
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:54,405
that I would like to keep this
to serious suggestions.

1390
00:56:54,472 --> 00:56:56,810
I'm serious about
the grandfather mountain.

1391
00:56:56,877 --> 00:56:58,112
She loved it, and it was a place

1392
00:56:58,179 --> 00:57:00,317
that she talked
about constantly.

1393
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:01,653
The place she loved
more than anything

1394
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,655
was the beautiful farm.

1395
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:03,990
I mean, there's no question
about it.

1396
00:57:04,057 --> 00:57:05,025
There's no question.

1397
00:57:05,093 --> 00:57:06,562
I just wanna throw this out.

1398
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:07,899
What if we buried her
at Parker's?

1399
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,903
- The barbecue place?
- Yeah.

1400
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:11,372
Oh, my goodness.

1401
00:57:11,439 --> 00:57:13,142
I do hate you,
but that's a really good idea.

1402
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:15,413
- I love that.
- Thank you.

1403
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,253
She did love their coleslaw.

1404
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:19,623
- Oh, my God!
- Love it.

1405
00:57:19,689 --> 00:57:22,160
Every time we went
to go visit her grave,

1406
00:57:22,227 --> 00:57:23,596
we could go get Parker's.

1407
00:57:23,664 --> 00:57:25,768
We could go get barbecue
every single time.

1408
00:57:25,835 --> 00:57:27,304
Wait, when was the last time...

1409
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:29,040
I'm trying to remember,
when were we there?

1410
00:57:29,108 --> 00:57:30,611
- I know. It's when...
- When?

1411
00:57:30,678 --> 00:57:33,182
We were all sitting... we were
all sitting around the booth,

1412
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:35,353
and that little baby
was crying in the corner,

1413
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,124
and she just turned around
and said,

1414
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:41,365
"Excuse me, could you please put
your tit in that baby's mouth?"

1415
00:57:41,432 --> 00:57:44,138
- That's right.
- Remember that?

1416
00:57:44,204 --> 00:57:46,442
Yeah, it was my baby.

1417
00:57:46,509 --> 00:57:48,747
[laughter]

1418
00:57:48,814 --> 00:57:51,620
Remember Grandma always said,
"You've gotta order extra."

1419
00:57:51,687 --> 00:57:54,960
She would say that even though
you had extra at home already.

1420
00:57:55,026 --> 00:57:57,164
You had extra in the freezer
at home,

1421
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:58,466
and she'd be like,
"You got to order extra."

1422
00:57:58,533 --> 00:58:00,805
- Chad, where are you going?
- Where are you heading?

1423
00:58:00,871 --> 00:58:03,576
I feel like she...

1424
00:58:03,644 --> 00:58:06,750
- No, whoa, whoa.
- Chad.

1425
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,152
Chad.

1426
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:10,925
Oh, no, no, no,
are you serious?

1427
00:58:10,992 --> 00:58:12,160
Chad?

1428
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:13,296
I think it's
a really beautiful place.

1429
00:58:13,363 --> 00:58:14,465
Can you shut up for a second,
Robert,

1430
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:16,134
- and let me finish?
- Where is Chad going?

1431
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:18,239
Who gives a shit?

1432
00:58:18,306 --> 00:58:21,713
- Bret was right.
- Are you serious, dude?

1433
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,884
Are you in here? Hey!

1434
00:58:23,951 --> 00:58:26,322
- What are you doing?
- Hey, come on, dude.

1435
00:58:26,389 --> 00:58:27,625
I knew it.

1436
00:58:27,692 --> 00:58:30,296
- Hey, back up, dude!
- What's going on?

1437
00:58:30,363 --> 00:58:32,501
- Chad, stop!
- What the hell?

1438
00:58:32,567 --> 00:58:34,606
I'm-I'm the only one who tells
the truth in these meetings.

1439
00:58:34,673 --> 00:58:36,275
- What's going on?
- What is happening?

1440
00:58:36,342 --> 00:58:37,779
- Dude, man, stop!
- Are you guys kidding me?

1441
00:58:37,845 --> 00:58:39,381
Why can't you get
your shit together

1442
00:58:39,448 --> 00:58:41,953
and have one day about Gigi?

1443
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,624
I mean, she just fucking died.

1444
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:46,395
I am so sick
of all of your problems.

1445
00:58:46,462 --> 00:58:48,634
- Stop! Get off me!
- Boys, calm down.

1446
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:50,203
Do you believe how messed up
this really is.

1447
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:51,606
- Fraud!
- They're acting like children.

1448
00:58:51,673 --> 00:58:53,811
- Fraud, fraud, fraud!
- I'm a fraud? You're a fraud!

1449
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:56,382
Your book isn't even a metaphor!
You just got lost!

1450
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,319
That's it. That does it.
That doesn't make you wise.

1451
00:58:58,386 --> 00:58:59,555
What are you doing?

1452
00:58:59,622 --> 00:59:02,461
I'm trying to get away
from this family.

1453
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,199
I'm gonna
move to Libya next time.

1454
00:59:04,264 --> 00:59:05,366
No, you're not going to Libya.

1455
00:59:05,433 --> 00:59:07,471
You are admitting
that you embezzled.

1456
00:59:07,537 --> 00:59:09,074
Oh, I'm the only one who tells
the truth in this family!

1457
00:59:09,141 --> 00:59:10,243
Fess up, right now.

1458
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:11,312
You're the only person
in this family

1459
00:59:11,378 --> 00:59:13,182
that stole from it.

1460
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:14,384
You stole from me!

1461
00:59:14,451 --> 00:59:17,390
I sent you my book royalties!
Admit it.

1462
00:59:17,457 --> 00:59:20,296
I'm sorry about that,
actually.

1463
00:59:20,363 --> 00:59:23,402
- Does Katie know about this?
- She knows you're here, huh?

1464
00:59:23,469 --> 00:59:25,440
- Yes.
- What about Mom?

1465
00:59:25,507 --> 00:59:27,511
- Of course Mom knows.
- I'm the favorite.

1466
00:59:28,914 --> 00:59:30,251
Fuck you!

1467
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,587
You didn't come to when
they rescued me by helicopter.

1468
00:59:32,655 --> 00:59:33,757
And you didn't come
to the airport

1469
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:35,493
when they brought me home
from my parade.

1470
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,963
You didn't come
to my book launch.

1471
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:41,138
- It was self-published.
- So why would I go?

1472
00:59:41,205 --> 00:59:42,975
That is irrelevant, Robert.

1473
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:45,079
[gentle acoustic music]

1474
00:59:45,146 --> 00:59:47,652
[singing]
I'm gonna love you

1475
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:50,456
Hang around my doorstep

1476
00:59:50,523 --> 00:59:52,527
Ain't got no loose change

1477
00:59:52,594 --> 00:59:54,464
Stop, stop, stop.

1478
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:59,174
- Same old shit, huh?
- Same old tree.

1479
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:02,113
- Stop it. Why are you so mad?
- Do you ever think about them?

1480
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,451
And yeah I faked...
I faked faking my own death.

1481
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,455
I faked going to Russia.

1482
01:00:06,522 --> 01:00:08,426
I faked being the second coming
of Snowden.

1483
01:00:08,492 --> 01:00:09,829
You leaked information

1484
01:00:09,896 --> 01:00:12,000
regarding the planning
infrastructure of Newark.

1485
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:13,904
Terrorists
could have used that.

1486
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:15,406
- How?
- How could they have used it?

1487
01:00:15,473 --> 01:00:17,712
There should've been
a bigger deal, okay?

1488
01:00:17,778 --> 01:00:18,714
Listen, I was brave
for doing that.

1489
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,651
Yes, yes, you survived death.

1490
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:23,790
Bret had to deal
with his true love dying,

1491
01:00:23,857 --> 01:00:25,661
but I had to survive
through you from...

1492
01:00:25,728 --> 01:00:27,030
you kicked the shit out of me!

1493
01:00:27,097 --> 01:00:31,071
All the time, man.
You hurt your brother, man.

1494
01:00:31,138 --> 01:00:32,642
All I wanted to do was hang out
with you,

1495
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:34,411
and you fucking kicked my ass.

1496
01:00:34,478 --> 01:00:36,716
- Okay, all right, fine.
- All right.

1497
01:00:36,783 --> 01:00:39,588
But you were pretty annoying,
dude.

1498
01:00:39,656 --> 01:00:41,860
- I was what?
- Annoying.

1499
01:00:41,927 --> 01:00:44,666
You were an annoying presence.

1500
01:00:49,174 --> 01:00:52,480
- I'm done. Let's go. Right now.
- I'm done.

1501
01:00:52,547 --> 01:00:56,756
Yeah, I was hiding.
Dad, let's go. I'm ready.

1502
01:00:56,823 --> 01:01:00,063
- Let's go where?
- Right here, right now.

1503
01:01:00,129 --> 01:01:02,635
This annoying asshole
is gonna kick your ass

1504
01:01:02,702 --> 01:01:05,341
in front of everyone on Zoom.

1505
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,112
Let's go!

1506
01:01:08,179 --> 01:01:10,784
[singing]
Swaying in the breeze now

1507
01:01:10,851 --> 01:01:12,455
Hanging on the burner

1508
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,093
They're gone.

1509
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:16,696
They're gone, bitch.

1510
01:01:19,067 --> 01:01:23,275
There are some things
you just can't do over Zoom.

1511
01:01:23,343 --> 01:01:27,852
If either of them could fight,
someone might actually get hurt.

1512
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:31,225
Are you further apart
but closer to you family now?

1513
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:35,099
I mean, who-who did you get
locked in with?

1514
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:38,305
- Oh, my back.
- I know. Oh, that truly hurts.

1515
01:01:38,373 --> 01:01:40,076
Oh, my God.

1516
01:01:42,381 --> 01:01:44,719
'Cause you're fucking
everybody's favorite, man.

1517
01:01:44,786 --> 01:01:48,059
- Yeah.
- Mom's, Gigi, Katie.

1518
01:01:51,031 --> 01:01:53,169
I'm also the best-looking.

1519
01:01:53,235 --> 01:01:56,810
- Don't do that. Come here.
- You gotta crack my back.

1520
01:02:02,822 --> 01:02:06,228
One, two. God, you've gotten
so fat.

1521
01:02:06,295 --> 01:02:07,230
Yeah.

1522
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:13,075
- Okay, Dorsey.
- What?

1523
01:02:13,142 --> 01:02:15,881
I need you to hear
what I'm about to say.

1524
01:02:15,948 --> 01:02:17,016
- Bobby, don't.
- Hear what?

1525
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:18,954
Yeah, I'm listening. I'm here.

1526
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,191
Diane, it is the problem
with this family.

1527
01:02:21,258 --> 01:02:23,830
It is why the river forks

1528
01:02:23,897 --> 01:02:25,501
and the-the-the waters
never come together.

1529
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:28,339
- Oh, my God with the water.
- She will not understand.

1530
01:02:28,406 --> 01:02:29,341
She will understand.

1531
01:02:29,408 --> 01:02:30,677
Can someone
please fucking tell me

1532
01:02:30,744 --> 01:02:32,616
what-what is happening,
Uncle Bobby?

1533
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:33,750
We need to decide
on this together.

1534
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:35,454
- Mom.
- Dorsey, I'm going to tell you.

1535
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:36,823
Don't you dare.

1536
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,359
Who is the host
of this meeting?

1537
01:02:38,426 --> 01:02:40,497
- I am. I'm the...
- Katie, do you hear me?

1538
01:02:40,564 --> 01:02:42,200
Do me a favor and
mute your mother.

1539
01:02:42,267 --> 01:02:44,539
I need to put this
in... into context.

1540
01:02:44,606 --> 01:02:46,041
Okay, you got it, Uncle Bobby.

1541
01:02:46,108 --> 01:02:47,410
Katie, do not mute Mom.

1542
01:02:47,478 --> 01:02:49,782
- I need to tell you how.
- Katie, do not mute Mom!

1543
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,185
[mouthing words]

1544
01:02:51,251 --> 01:02:55,727
Dorsey, can you just sit still
for one minute.

1545
01:02:55,794 --> 01:03:01,171
This is not easy for me,
but I am your father.

1546
01:03:04,779 --> 01:03:07,217
- Wait a minute.
- I am your dad.

1547
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,419
Oh, dear God.

1548
01:03:08,486 --> 01:03:10,891
Is that like what
you're telling me right now?

1549
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:12,327
I'm just gonna... you're telling
me.

1550
01:03:12,393 --> 01:03:13,863
I am.

1551
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:16,034
How could you be my dad
with her?

1552
01:03:16,101 --> 01:03:18,773
That's disgusting,
and that's like an insane...

1553
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,579
And that's why
that didn't happen, Dorsey.

1554
01:03:21,647 --> 01:03:23,883
What really happened was,

1555
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:27,992
when you were born, your mother,
my wife,

1556
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:31,734
Susanna, was very, very ill.

1557
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:36,041
She did not live
a very long time.

1558
01:03:36,108 --> 01:03:38,412
I didn't know what to do.
I was upended.

1559
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:44,660
I-I had this beautiful daughter.
I had no idea how to raise you.

1560
01:03:44,726 --> 01:03:48,165
And so I left you
with my sister,

1561
01:03:48,232 --> 01:03:50,672
who raised you as her own.

1562
01:03:50,738 --> 01:03:52,508
Good for you, Bobby.

1563
01:03:52,574 --> 01:03:56,849
- Wait, Bret, did you know this?
- Did anyone know this?

1564
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,555
Okay, I just don't understand
why this is the first time

1565
01:03:59,623 --> 01:04:01,492
I'm assuming any of us
have heard about this?

1566
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:02,861
Oh, God.

1567
01:04:02,928 --> 01:04:03,930
Holy shit!

1568
01:04:03,997 --> 01:04:05,266
- Max!
- Mom.

1569
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:06,536
Oh, my God.

1570
01:04:06,603 --> 01:04:08,172
Uh, I just need a minute.
If that's cool with everyone.

1571
01:04:08,238 --> 01:04:10,877
I think it's best if you call
me Father Bobby from now.

1572
01:04:10,944 --> 01:04:11,913
Oh, my God!

1573
01:04:11,979 --> 01:04:13,718
Why didn't either of you
tell me?

1574
01:04:13,784 --> 01:04:17,090
Because we're very good
at keeping... where did she go?

1575
01:04:17,156 --> 01:04:18,728
Dorsey, come back here.

1576
01:04:18,794 --> 01:04:21,131
I am not coming back here!

1577
01:04:21,198 --> 01:04:24,371
I-I think I just... I just need
a minute

1578
01:04:24,437 --> 01:04:26,041
'cause I don't fucking
understand

1579
01:04:26,108 --> 01:04:29,214
what the fuck is happening
right now.

1580
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,655
Katie, can you just fucking
unmute Mom for a minute?

1581
01:04:32,722 --> 01:04:34,726
And now I'm really pissed
that you've been gone

1582
01:04:34,793 --> 01:04:38,232
for so many goddamn years!

1583
01:04:38,298 --> 01:04:40,904
Max.

1584
01:04:40,971 --> 01:04:42,609
Mom?

1585
01:04:42,675 --> 01:04:48,586
[soft sentimental music]

1586
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:37,719
Hey, Max?

1587
01:05:37,785 --> 01:05:40,992
Will you put your dirty clothes
in a laundry bag, please?

1588
01:05:41,057 --> 01:05:43,161
I'm gonna pass out.

1589
01:05:45,533 --> 01:05:47,972
I bought a big bottle
of vodka.

1590
01:05:48,038 --> 01:05:50,509
That's weird.

1591
01:05:50,576 --> 01:05:52,014
- What's-what's weird?
- What-what do you mean?

1592
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,515
What? Which one?

1593
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:56,221
Well, normally you put two
ice cubes

1594
01:05:56,288 --> 01:05:58,425
in a glass
of buttery Chardonnay.

1595
01:05:58,492 --> 01:06:01,867
Well, there's shit about me
you don't know.

1596
01:06:01,934 --> 01:06:03,201
Okay, okay.

1597
01:06:03,268 --> 01:06:05,072
Okay, Dorsey is gonna be on
in one second.

1598
01:06:05,139 --> 01:06:09,849
Oh, no, I'm... I don't know
what to do.

1599
01:06:09,916 --> 01:06:12,353
I don't know what to say.

1600
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,223
I... you're gonna
have to-to help me.

1601
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:16,997
Hey, I think you should
just be your... don't, no.

1602
01:06:17,064 --> 01:06:18,634
I think,

1603
01:06:18,701 --> 01:06:22,206
don't be your controlling self,
be your loving self.

1604
01:06:23,944 --> 01:06:26,448
- My loving self.
- You did everything right.

1605
01:06:26,514 --> 01:06:28,318
You're just... you weren't
a good liar.

1606
01:06:28,385 --> 01:06:31,727
What? No one knew
until Bobby told everyone.

1607
01:06:31,793 --> 01:06:33,764
- No, I knew you had a secret.
- Blurting it out.

1608
01:06:33,831 --> 01:06:35,265
We all knew
there was something.

1609
01:06:35,332 --> 01:06:36,534
What? No, you didn't.

1610
01:06:36,602 --> 01:06:38,006
There-there has always been

1611
01:06:38,072 --> 01:06:39,440
something just furious in you.

1612
01:06:39,507 --> 01:06:40,945
- There has not.
- There was.

1613
01:06:41,012 --> 01:06:45,219
And we all had our own theories
that messed us up.

1614
01:06:45,285 --> 01:06:47,057
You know,
in a totally bespoke way, but...

1615
01:06:47,124 --> 01:06:48,694
Just bespoke. What?

1616
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:50,295
I don't even know
what that means.

1617
01:06:50,362 --> 01:06:53,235
Doesn't it mean customized?

1618
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:54,706
Does it?

1619
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:04,893
Hi, Mom.

1620
01:07:09,467 --> 01:07:13,508
Oh, stop. Stop.

1621
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:14,946
[voice breaking]
Hi, baby.

1622
01:07:15,013 --> 01:07:18,285
The drama of this family.

1623
01:07:18,351 --> 01:07:19,789
I have two daughters,

1624
01:07:19,856 --> 01:07:22,862
and I'll always have
two daughters.

1625
01:07:22,929 --> 01:07:25,399
Yes. Yes.

1626
01:07:25,466 --> 01:07:27,805
Look, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1627
01:07:27,872 --> 01:07:30,442
I, uh, I just did a...

1628
01:07:31,612 --> 01:07:35,153
A two-hour
emergency therapy session.

1629
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:38,025
Don't worry, I'm gonna ask you
to join next week.

1630
01:07:38,092 --> 01:07:41,800
We can talk about that later.
Both of you, Katie.

1631
01:07:41,867 --> 01:07:43,837
Well, let me just say,
I always had a plan.

1632
01:07:43,904 --> 01:07:47,144
I had a plan.
You weren't gonna stay.

1633
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:51,987
I was gonna take care of you for
a while, and then time went by,

1634
01:07:52,053 --> 01:07:53,991
and then it was too long,

1635
01:07:54,057 --> 01:07:56,930
so I thought it'd be devastating
to you,

1636
01:07:56,997 --> 01:08:01,571
and I just hope this isn't
too devastating to you instead.

1637
01:08:01,639 --> 01:08:03,176
Oh, I'm, like,
properly fucked up.

1638
01:08:03,242 --> 01:08:04,577
But don't worry.

1639
01:08:04,645 --> 01:08:07,349
I'm gonna be, like... we're gonna
be okay.

1640
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,821
Well, yeah.

1641
01:08:08,887 --> 01:08:10,290
And I'm so
happy you didn't leave me

1642
01:08:10,355 --> 01:08:13,129
with that fucking fuck up.

1643
01:08:13,196 --> 01:08:15,200
I mean, Bobby is a nightmare.

1644
01:08:15,266 --> 01:08:18,005
And trust me, it takes one
to know one, I know.

1645
01:08:18,072 --> 01:08:22,180
And I-I just can't even imagine,
like, what would my life be like

1646
01:08:22,247 --> 01:08:25,552
if it wasn't for you guys?
I'm a part of this family.

1647
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:27,190
It's not like you picked me up
out of a dumpster

1648
01:08:27,257 --> 01:08:28,558
and forgot to tell me that.

1649
01:08:28,626 --> 01:08:31,867
I mean, I am...
I mean, that's not true, right?

1650
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:33,904
- No, honey.
- Okay. Okay.

1651
01:08:33,971 --> 01:08:35,572
- We don't know.
- I mean, that's it.

1652
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,778
There's nothing else
I need to know, right?

1653
01:08:37,845 --> 01:08:39,413
No.

1654
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,687
I, um, I also just felt like
I needed to tell you, Katie,

1655
01:08:42,754 --> 01:08:44,758
is that, even though
it's not my fault,

1656
01:08:44,826 --> 01:08:46,461
I just think that you would have
really kicked ass

1657
01:08:46,527 --> 01:08:47,965
at being the only girl

1658
01:08:48,032 --> 01:08:49,701
and all the light
would be shining on you,

1659
01:08:49,768 --> 01:08:51,238
and I feel
like you deserve that, and...

1660
01:08:51,305 --> 01:08:52,875
You're insane.

1661
01:08:52,942 --> 01:08:56,148
You're acting like this ruined
my life or you ruined my life.

1662
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:59,856
No one ruined my life.
I messed it up.

1663
01:08:59,923 --> 01:09:04,866
Kevin-Kevin and I have split up.
That little bitch.

1664
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:06,669
But I'm... because
I'm too controlling

1665
01:09:06,735 --> 01:09:08,072
and I've-I've been controlling.

1666
01:09:08,139 --> 01:09:10,343
I always thought being
controlling was a good thing,

1667
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:12,380
is that... it was
about being strong

1668
01:09:12,446 --> 01:09:14,284
Well, we come by it naturally.

1669
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:16,255
Yes, you do.

1670
01:09:16,322 --> 01:09:20,462
And my mother... my mother
was very controlling.

1671
01:09:20,529 --> 01:09:22,566
Look at how
she controlled this.

1672
01:09:22,634 --> 01:09:24,805
She did, the bitch.

1673
01:09:24,872 --> 01:09:27,310
- She did.
- The bitch.

1674
01:09:27,377 --> 01:09:29,081
She's still doing it.

1675
01:09:29,147 --> 01:09:32,486
But Dorsey, seriously, I will
be treating you like a cousin

1676
01:09:32,553 --> 01:09:34,057
from here on out,
and you'll always be.

1677
01:09:34,124 --> 01:09:35,525
I think that might be
a good thing.

1678
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:37,898
[laughs]

1679
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:40,136
I don't know how the boys are
going to treat me from now on

1680
01:09:40,203 --> 01:09:42,173
'cause you know, they're gonna
just give me an endless amount

1681
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,676
of shit about this, right?

1682
01:09:43,743 --> 01:09:46,749
Like, it's gonna be
never-ending.

1683
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,486
Just like it always has been.

1684
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:51,191
You should be happy
that they're not your brothers.

1685
01:09:51,258 --> 01:09:53,095
That I...
[both laugh]

1686
01:09:53,162 --> 01:09:57,270
I wish... what I would give
to not be their sister.

1687
01:09:57,337 --> 01:09:59,674
And I don't believe that
for a minute.

1688
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:03,082
[laughter]

1689
01:10:03,149 --> 01:10:06,688
[heartfelt music]

1690
01:10:06,755 --> 01:10:10,096
Max. Max!

1691
01:10:10,163 --> 01:10:12,333
What?

1692
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,638
Let's go home.

1693
01:10:14,704 --> 01:10:16,208
Where's that?

1694
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:22,888
Diane, I can't hear
a word you're saying.

1695
01:10:22,955 --> 01:10:25,193
I can't hear anything at all
that you're saying.

1696
01:10:25,259 --> 01:10:27,730
Diane, I can't hear you.

1697
01:10:27,797 --> 01:10:29,267
No, no.
Don't-don't give a speech.

1698
01:10:29,334 --> 01:10:32,774
Diane, Diane,
let's go to the phone.

1699
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:34,678
Okay, just-just wait.

1700
01:10:34,744 --> 01:10:36,348
Since the day we met.

1701
01:10:39,788 --> 01:10:44,397
Yeah. Yup.

1702
01:10:44,464 --> 01:10:47,437
Um. Uh.

1703
01:10:47,504 --> 01:10:48,607
Thank you.

1704
01:10:48,672 --> 01:10:52,847
And I would say, I think the...

1705
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,219
the way I would see it.

1706
01:10:55,286 --> 01:10:59,694
I froze for the whole fucking
speech, didn't I?

1707
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:01,732
Yeah, you did.

1708
01:11:01,798 --> 01:11:04,070
Ugh, ugh.

1709
01:11:04,137 --> 01:11:08,145
It's like watching
the fucking Jetsons.

1710
01:11:08,212 --> 01:11:10,316
All the little boxes,
all the little squares,

1711
01:11:10,383 --> 01:11:13,489
everyone lined up
like we're all the same.

1712
01:11:13,556 --> 01:11:16,828
Honestly, it's fascism
when you boil it down.

1713
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:20,069
A part of me wants
to never tell you

1714
01:11:20,136 --> 01:11:23,776
what the speech was about,
Judith.

1715
01:11:23,842 --> 01:11:25,681
Yeah, well, a part of me
was gonna say

1716
01:11:25,746 --> 01:11:27,717
I heard the whole thing.

1717
01:11:29,854 --> 01:11:32,126
How are you feeling?
How are you doing?

1718
01:11:32,193 --> 01:11:38,005
Oh, I feel tired, confused.

1719
01:11:38,072 --> 01:11:40,576
I feel a lot of regret, Judith.

1720
01:11:40,644 --> 01:11:43,382
- Ugh.
- I'm not missing her.

1721
01:11:45,086 --> 01:11:48,759
I've been missing her
for 20 years.

1722
01:11:48,826 --> 01:11:51,398
Well, she missed you too.

1723
01:11:51,465 --> 01:11:53,603
She talked about you
all the time.

1724
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:57,210
A part of me was always scared

1725
01:11:57,277 --> 01:12:00,549
to see you the first few times
that we were together.

1726
01:12:03,022 --> 01:12:06,128
Figured she told you her version
of me.

1727
01:12:06,194 --> 01:12:08,633
Figured she told you
about Dorsey.

1728
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,004
She did, but I'll tell you

1729
01:12:11,071 --> 01:12:12,974
the only thing I ever thought
about you

1730
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:17,016
was what an incredibly
strong woman you had to be.

1731
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:19,821
In that position?

1732
01:12:19,888 --> 01:12:22,026
I mean, you raised five kids.

1733
01:12:22,093 --> 01:12:24,197
I found you intimidating.

1734
01:12:24,264 --> 01:12:28,005
And I found you admirable
like Mabel.

1735
01:12:28,072 --> 01:12:30,276
Thank you.

1736
01:12:30,343 --> 01:12:33,215
I regret
not knowing you better, Judith.

1737
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:37,056
That was the gist
of my speech, truly.

1738
01:12:38,926 --> 01:12:43,102
And I'm sorry that
you couldn't be with her.

1739
01:12:43,168 --> 01:12:44,705
Well, she didn't want me
there.

1740
01:12:44,772 --> 01:12:46,843
That's crazy.

1741
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:50,149
No, she really didn't.

1742
01:12:50,216 --> 01:12:53,288
Oh, that's just like
my mother.

1743
01:12:53,355 --> 01:12:58,399
She wants everyone around
and to be left the fuck alone.

1744
01:13:01,238 --> 01:13:04,879
- Yeah.
- She loves you, right?

1745
01:13:04,944 --> 01:13:06,682
I know that.

1746
01:13:07,885 --> 01:13:09,921
Thank you.

1747
01:13:09,988 --> 01:13:16,101
[sentimental music]

1748
01:13:35,004 --> 01:13:37,276
What the hell?

1749
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:43,020
Hello, come in, over.

1750
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:45,660
Hey, Dad.

1751
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:48,265
I wanna try out a new
communication strategy, over.

1752
01:13:48,332 --> 01:13:50,536
Yeah, well, it's analog

1753
01:13:50,604 --> 01:13:53,275
'cause some hacker broke
into my computer

1754
01:13:53,342 --> 01:13:56,983
and has been monitoring
my every move, so.

1755
01:13:57,048 --> 01:14:00,222
Well, maybe the hacker didn't
know what else to do, you know.

1756
01:14:00,289 --> 01:14:04,230
Maybe he was a hacker who had
a whole hacker family,

1757
01:14:04,297 --> 01:14:06,101
and in that hacker family,

1758
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:07,804
he was the parent
that didn't exactly know

1759
01:14:07,871 --> 01:14:10,109
what to say at the right time.

1760
01:14:10,175 --> 01:14:12,948
Or how to say the right thing.

1761
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:14,250
Maybe he didn't understand what

1762
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:15,787
his little girl was trying
to say to him

1763
01:14:15,854 --> 01:14:20,964
because that was... that was
the mom's job.

1764
01:14:21,031 --> 01:14:23,937
And the mom and the daughter
in this hacker family,

1765
01:14:24,003 --> 01:14:25,506
they had this secret language

1766
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:28,145
that they just... they just
got each other.

1767
01:14:28,211 --> 01:14:32,118
They just had this instant,
beautiful connection, and...

1768
01:14:35,059 --> 01:14:37,731
And then she died.

1769
01:14:37,798 --> 01:14:41,371
And he wasn't ready for that,
even though he should have been

1770
01:14:41,438 --> 01:14:44,177
because he had
a whole fucking year.

1771
01:14:44,243 --> 01:14:47,283
And still he wasn't ready.

1772
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:50,022
And he forgot to learn
the language.

1773
01:14:50,089 --> 01:14:54,865
And now he's losing her slowly.
And he can't lose her too.

1774
01:14:58,305 --> 01:15:00,810
He's not losing her, over.

1775
01:15:05,219 --> 01:15:06,889
I fucked up, Cas.

1776
01:15:08,793 --> 01:15:10,529
I shouldn't have let you
been there when she died.

1777
01:15:10,596 --> 01:15:13,268
It was too much.
That was too hard.

1778
01:15:13,335 --> 01:15:17,143
You know, I still think
about it all the time.

1779
01:15:17,209 --> 01:15:19,915
I know. I'm sorry.

1780
01:15:21,919 --> 01:15:23,956
We saw her leave.

1781
01:15:24,023 --> 01:15:27,329
I think it's proof that there
are other worlds out there.

1782
01:15:27,396 --> 01:15:28,766
That's nice, Cas.

1783
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:31,538
I mean, as we do some more
deep space exploration,

1784
01:15:31,605 --> 01:15:33,308
we'll get real proof of there
being other worlds,

1785
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:34,343
but you know.

1786
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:36,247
Stop talking about space.

1787
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,629
You know, she said I had
to take care of you somehow.

1788
01:15:43,696 --> 01:15:45,767
No, you don't have to do that.

1789
01:15:47,204 --> 01:15:48,906
It's not fair.

1790
01:15:48,973 --> 01:15:50,877
You shouldn't have been
asked that.

1791
01:15:50,944 --> 01:15:51,946
I know.

1792
01:15:52,012 --> 01:15:58,558
But she was on morphine,
so yeah, I get it.

1793
01:15:58,626 --> 01:16:01,665
We should talk more.

1794
01:16:01,732 --> 01:16:05,240
And, hey, keep the old can
charged up.

1795
01:16:05,305 --> 01:16:09,347
[soft acoustic music]

1796
01:16:09,413 --> 01:16:12,520
[phone ringing]

1797
01:16:14,524 --> 01:16:18,064
Hello, I am shark
from the deep ocean.

1798
01:16:18,131 --> 01:16:20,169
[eating noisily]

1799
01:16:20,236 --> 01:16:21,404
Hi, Bobby.

1800
01:16:21,471 --> 01:16:22,607
Wait a minute,
how did you know?

1801
01:16:22,674 --> 01:16:24,510
Who-who is the Bobby
you talk of?

1802
01:16:24,577 --> 01:16:25,847
Do you wanna talk to my mom?

1803
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:29,220
- Is she in a good mood?
- I'll see.

1804
01:16:29,288 --> 01:16:31,124
Okay, yeah. Well then, okay.

1805
01:16:31,191 --> 01:16:32,593
And just so you know,

1806
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:34,030
I'm really glad I have
a grandpa now.

1807
01:16:34,096 --> 01:16:36,902
I've never really had one
before, you know?

1808
01:16:36,969 --> 01:16:39,875
I am so glad
I have you in my life too.

1809
01:16:39,942 --> 01:16:41,144
Me too.

1810
01:16:41,211 --> 01:16:42,580
Perhaps Bobby will be

1811
01:16:42,647 --> 01:16:45,018
a better grandparent
than parent.

1812
01:16:45,085 --> 01:16:46,487
We can only hope so.

1813
01:16:46,554 --> 01:16:48,826
- Mom, it's your dad.
- He's a shark.

1814
01:16:48,893 --> 01:16:51,431
This is a shark
from the very deep ocean.

1815
01:16:51,497 --> 01:16:54,638
I'm from the very...
[eating noisily]

1816
01:16:54,705 --> 01:16:55,740
All right, that was stupid.

1817
01:16:55,807 --> 01:16:57,811
Okay, let me transform. Hold it.

1818
01:16:57,878 --> 01:17:00,082
I'll put that. Here I am. Hi.

1819
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:02,921
I-I thought, you know,
that would be a, like,

1820
01:17:02,988 --> 01:17:07,229
a great disguise
to a work around Max.

1821
01:17:07,297 --> 01:17:09,935
- Why do you need a disguise?
- Max doesn't care.

1822
01:17:10,002 --> 01:17:13,709
Yeah, but you know, this is
a very important moment for me,

1823
01:17:13,776 --> 01:17:15,512
and I-I didn't want to miss it,

1824
01:17:15,579 --> 01:17:18,686
and I-I-I wanted so badly
to talk to you, but...

1825
01:17:18,753 --> 01:17:20,990
- You know, I guessed it once.
- When?

1826
01:17:21,057 --> 01:17:23,161
It was at Grandma's
70th birthday party.

1827
01:17:23,228 --> 01:17:24,998
- Huh.
- I don't know, I must've been,

1828
01:17:25,065 --> 01:17:27,102
like, 11 or 12, and you were
playing with all the kids,

1829
01:17:27,169 --> 01:17:28,104
and you were running around

1830
01:17:28,171 --> 01:17:30,677
and I thought,
"He runs like I run."

1831
01:17:30,743 --> 01:17:31,946
- You know what?
- I remember that day.

1832
01:17:32,012 --> 01:17:33,148
Yeah.

1833
01:17:33,214 --> 01:17:34,517
It was a wonderful day,

1834
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:37,189
and I am so sorry
for the inheritance.

1835
01:17:37,256 --> 01:17:40,295
I like how I run.

1836
01:17:40,363 --> 01:17:44,070
I have so many things
I wanna tell you, Dorsey.

1837
01:17:44,136 --> 01:17:48,646
I just... I don't know... I don't
know how to say I'm sorry.

1838
01:17:48,713 --> 01:17:52,454
I mean, I have, like...

1839
01:17:52,519 --> 01:17:55,426
- I have a million questions.
- I know.

1840
01:17:55,492 --> 01:17:59,835
You can't even understand
how crazy I feel right now.

1841
01:17:59,901 --> 01:18:03,676
But before-before we even do
any of this,

1842
01:18:03,743 --> 01:18:05,613
you have to know
that Bill is my dad.

1843
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,917
- Finally, someone mentions me.
- He's my dad.

1844
01:18:07,984 --> 01:18:11,157
- It took them long enough.
- I'm Bill, Diane's husband.

1845
01:18:11,224 --> 01:18:13,896
Okay, and-and the day he died
was the worst day of my life.

1846
01:18:13,963 --> 01:18:18,271
- Heart attack in '98.
- It was fast, no sympathy needed.

1847
01:18:18,338 --> 01:18:21,812
And there's no way this guy
will ever replace me.

1848
01:18:21,879 --> 01:18:25,052
I-I do not want
to take Bill's place.

1849
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:29,593
I just want my own little place
in your heart if I could.

1850
01:18:29,661 --> 01:18:33,969
It just... and then maybe
it'll grow, and...

1851
01:18:34,036 --> 01:18:37,242
but I know... I know
Bill is your dad.

1852
01:18:37,309 --> 01:18:38,612
I know that. I know that.

1853
01:18:38,679 --> 01:18:42,720
I gave that up
a long, a long time ago.

1854
01:18:42,787 --> 01:18:45,893
I need a little time,
all right? Okay.

1855
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,764
Can I... can I talk
to you again?

1856
01:18:47,831 --> 01:18:49,701
Yes, of course.

1857
01:18:49,768 --> 01:18:51,170
I just... I'm not ready yet.

1858
01:18:51,237 --> 01:18:53,742
Okay, this is the shark
saying goodbye.

1859
01:18:55,378 --> 01:18:57,617
I don't wanna laugh right now.

1860
01:18:57,684 --> 01:19:00,923
- Can I just say one more thing?
- You should be very proud of Max.

1861
01:19:00,990 --> 01:19:02,560
He is so perceptive.

1862
01:19:02,627 --> 01:19:04,764
He somehow... he knew I was
the shark.

1863
01:19:04,831 --> 01:19:07,069
Okay, that's good for now,
all right?

1864
01:19:08,873 --> 01:19:10,676
- Bye.
- Bye.

1865

[heartwarming acoustic music]

1866
01:19:16,822 --> 01:19:20,095
[singing]
I was standing

1867
01:19:20,162 --> 01:19:22,967
By my window

1868
01:19:23,034 --> 01:19:29,046
On a dark and cloudy day

1869
01:19:29,113 --> 01:19:35,392
Will the circle be unbroken

1870
01:19:35,459 --> 01:19:41,639
By and by, Lord, by and by?

1871
01:19:41,705 --> 01:19:48,586
There's a better home awaiting

1872
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:52,661
In the sky

1873
01:19:52,727 --> 01:19:54,798
Well, that was beautiful.

1874
01:19:54,864 --> 01:19:55,967
Yeah, I'm really glad
you all decided

1875
01:19:56,033 --> 01:19:57,770
to do a digital service,
you know,

1876
01:19:57,837 --> 01:20:00,342
and you know, maybe when things
are safer and we're cleared up,

1877
01:20:00,408 --> 01:20:01,344
we can do a full service,

1878
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:03,582
you know,
in person, the whole shebang.

1879
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:06,287
And now for the final video.

1880
01:20:06,354 --> 01:20:09,794
- I'm back! Just kidding.
- Still dead.

1881
01:20:09,861 --> 01:20:14,403
Welcome to the final installment
of my last will and testament.

1882
01:20:14,471 --> 01:20:18,111
You've hopefully decided
where to bury my ashes,

1883
01:20:18,177 --> 01:20:21,050
and it better be the place
I'm thinking of.

1884
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:25,458
The only place I ever really
felt like we were a family

1885
01:20:25,526 --> 01:20:26,763
and that you've invited

1886
01:20:26,828 --> 01:20:29,333
my young,
gorgeous, and sexy wife.

1887
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:33,542
I know I dropped some bombs.

1888
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:37,785
I'd say I was sorry,
but that would be a lie.

1889
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:40,055
I hope you're all healing.

1890
01:20:40,121 --> 01:20:43,194
Life is full of secrets,
but it's better without any,

1891
01:20:43,261 --> 01:20:45,465
and I leveled the playing field.

1892
01:20:45,533 --> 01:20:49,139
I want you to love each other
the way I love all of you:

1893
01:20:49,206 --> 01:20:52,145
unconditionally
and unapologetically.

1894
01:20:52,212 --> 01:20:54,752
So if you haven't yet,
forgive yourselves,

1895
01:20:54,819 --> 01:20:56,988
and then you can forgive
each other.

1896
01:20:57,055 --> 01:20:59,226
You're not perfect.
None of us are.

1897
01:20:59,293 --> 01:21:01,163
Give each other
a second chance...

1898
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:03,434
or in Bret's case,
a third chance.

1899
01:21:03,501 --> 01:21:06,541
Or in Chad's case,
a fourth chance.

1900
01:21:06,609 --> 01:21:07,877
I'm kidding.

1901
01:21:07,944 --> 01:21:10,415
I love you both,
but you get what I mean.

1902
01:21:10,482 --> 01:21:12,987
You're family.
We've gotta stick together.

1903
01:21:13,054 --> 01:21:15,627
Lastly, the rumor's true.

1904
01:21:15,694 --> 01:21:19,433
There's something of value
at the farm.

1905
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,504
Finders keepers.

1906
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:33,060
I love you all so much.

1907
01:21:33,127 --> 01:21:34,196
- Me, too, Mama.
- I love you, Mama.

1908
01:21:34,263 --> 01:21:35,667
Love you too, son.

1909
01:21:35,734 --> 01:21:38,504
[sobbing]
Don't cry, Mom, it makes me cry.

1910
01:21:38,572 --> 01:21:39,842
Love you guys.

1911
01:21:39,909 --> 01:21:42,479
- Bobby?
- Yeah.

1912
01:21:42,546 --> 01:21:44,249
I wanna say I'm sorry.

1913
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:48,291
I-I thank you so much
for that.

1914
01:21:48,357 --> 01:21:49,326
Yeah.

1915
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:53,267
Love you, Dorsey.

1916
01:21:53,334 --> 01:21:55,338
I love you, Katie.

1917
01:21:55,405 --> 01:21:58,377
- Yeah, love you, cuz.
- [both laugh]

1918
01:21:58,444 --> 01:22:02,185
Hey, guys, maybe we'll get
along better now.

1919
01:22:02,252 --> 01:22:05,225
Dorsey, are you ready
to let me into your life?

1920
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:07,764
- I'm never gonna call you dad.
- I'm sorry.

1921
01:22:07,831 --> 01:22:11,437
- How about papa?
- I think... I think Bobby's good.

1922
01:22:11,504 --> 01:22:15,378
I think we're good.
But I'm always calling you mom.

1923
01:22:15,445 --> 01:22:17,582
Well, I will always be
your mother.

1924
01:22:19,219 --> 01:22:22,025
And your mother,
and your mother,

1925
01:22:22,092 --> 01:22:25,867
and your mother,
and your mother.

1926
01:22:25,934 --> 01:22:28,037
And of course, my granddaughter.

1927
01:22:28,104 --> 01:22:32,078
And your sister
and your friend, Judith.

1928
01:22:32,145 --> 01:22:36,287
- I appreciate that.
- I appreciate all of you.

1929
01:22:36,353 --> 01:22:40,029
And boy, did Mabel love you.
Every single one of you.

1930
01:22:40,094 --> 01:22:44,638
Hey, Judith as-as soon
as COVID's over,

1931
01:22:44,705 --> 01:22:46,943
I was gonna grab my brothers
and drive up to New York.

1932
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:47,911
I have a meeting
with the publisher

1933
01:22:47,978 --> 01:22:49,146
about another book.

1934
01:22:49,212 --> 01:22:51,317
- Oh, stop.
- Come on.

1935
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,754
What I wanted to say is,

1936
01:22:52,821 --> 01:22:55,491
it would be wonderful
to take you out to dinner

1937
01:22:55,558 --> 01:22:57,562
and meet you face to face.

1938
01:22:57,631 --> 01:22:59,433
I would love that. Thank you.

1939
01:22:59,499 --> 01:23:01,270
Well, Judith, if you want,
you know,

1940
01:23:01,337 --> 01:23:05,244
Bret's single,
and the way I see it, I mean.

1941
01:23:05,311 --> 01:23:06,816
Mm-mm, hop on that train.

1942
01:23:06,882 --> 01:23:09,119
Well, that's kinda awkward.

1943
01:23:09,186 --> 01:23:11,091
What, Katie? Spread the love.

1944
01:23:11,156 --> 01:23:16,467
- Katie's single too, right?
- I am single-ish, yes.

1945
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:17,738
Judith?

1946
01:23:17,804 --> 01:23:21,779
- Yes, dearest. Here I am.
- New York City.

1947
01:23:21,846 --> 01:23:23,547
Judith, we're keeping you
in this family somehow.

1948
01:23:23,615 --> 01:23:25,954
Yeah, you can't escape us.

1949
01:23:26,021 --> 01:23:29,459
You are one wild, crazy group.

1950
01:23:29,526 --> 01:23:30,897
You should try it
from the outside.

1951
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,334
[laughter]

1952
01:23:33,401 --> 01:23:36,942
Honest to God, I've never seen
anything like it.

1953
01:23:37,009 --> 01:23:42,888
- Oh, I love you all so much.
- Love you guys.

[sentimental music]

1955
01:23:50,069 --> 01:23:51,972
So yeah, you can record them.

1956
01:23:52,039 --> 01:23:56,681
So I've been recording this one,
and that's about it, Gigi.

1957
01:23:56,749 --> 01:23:58,284
So I can take care of the rest.

1958
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:00,857
I can send out the invitations
and stuff,

1959
01:24:00,924 --> 01:24:02,694
and all you need to do

1960
01:24:02,761 --> 01:24:06,869
is just connect on your computer
or iPad or whatever.

1961
01:24:06,936 --> 01:24:10,274
And they'll all appear
one by one.

1962
01:24:10,341 --> 01:24:14,516
How do they all fit
on the screen?

1963
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:16,956
The boxes get smaller.

1964
01:24:17,022 --> 01:24:20,528
That's what time does
to your family, actually.

1965
01:24:20,595 --> 01:24:22,465
You start off with a little baby

1966
01:24:22,532 --> 01:24:24,302
and a chair
in the middle of the night,

1967
01:24:24,369 --> 01:24:26,141
just the two of you.

1968
01:24:26,207 --> 01:24:29,147
And then more people come,
and they get further.

1969
01:24:29,213 --> 01:24:32,253
And then when you're my age,
whenever you look at them,

1970
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:36,896
it's like looking through
an old yearbook or something.

1971
01:24:36,962 --> 01:24:39,066
I hate my yearbook.

1972
01:24:39,133 --> 01:24:40,870
Why, dear?

1973
01:24:40,937 --> 01:24:44,277
- I hate the kids at school.
- They make fun of me.

1974
01:24:44,342 --> 01:24:46,313
They think
I'm crazy or something.

1975
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:49,452
I don't know, maybe I am crazy.

1976
01:24:49,519 --> 01:24:54,730
- Cassidy, look at me.
- You're not crazy.

1977
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,236
You just loved her,
and she loved you.

1978
01:24:57,303 --> 01:24:59,640
And so does your father.

1979
01:24:59,707 --> 01:25:03,181
- I just miss her.
- I know.

1980
01:25:03,248 --> 01:25:08,058
You know, I think death
is kind of beautiful.

1981
01:25:08,124 --> 01:25:09,660
Does that sound weird?

1982
01:25:09,727 --> 01:25:13,434
Yeah, to be honest,
it-it does.

1983
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:18,044
From where I'm sitting,
it's a little scary.

1984
01:25:18,111 --> 01:25:21,017
Yeah, I don't know, though,
it's just...

1985
01:25:22,418 --> 01:25:24,724
Death is so, you know,

1986
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:28,698
just happens,
and then it's a fact.

1987
01:25:28,765 --> 01:25:31,872
Death is kinda... it's true.
I don't know.

1988
01:25:31,939 --> 01:25:34,777
I just... I think that's
kind of beautiful.

1989
01:25:38,285 --> 01:25:41,190
Send those invitations out.

1990
01:25:41,257 --> 01:25:42,726
Just did.

1991
01:25:44,462 --> 01:25:47,236
See you there, Grandma.

1992
01:25:47,303 --> 01:25:48,873
See ya.

What's up, sugar plum?

I'm coming down for dinner.

01:26:14,589 --> 01:26:15,994
Okay.

It's all the same to me

2002
01:26:31,157 --> 01:26:34,130

is present enough

- in an impossible position.

You were... you were incredible,
Diane.

2006

You were incredible to
her, Mom, Dad.

2007

You-you
could have tried harder.

Don't you think if I knew how,
I would have?

2009
01:26:51,999 --> 01:26:56,240
You could have made it
so I didn't have to lie to her.

are you gonna pretend

01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:03,254
to live in Paris this year?

I've heard the fake weather
is really lovely in the fall.

01:27:48,979 --> 01:27:50,582
Are you kidding me?

2031
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:52,553
I'm-I'm honestly
gonna do that.

2032
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,356
Baby, I'll meet you there.

2033
01:27:54,423 --> 01:27:57,362
Just do me one favor.

2034
01:27:57,429 --> 01:27:58,264
What?

2035
01:27:58,331 --> 01:28:00,335
Don't yell at me
when you see me.

2036
01:28:02,105 --> 01:28:03,808
Well, I can't promise you
that, Bobby.

2037
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:05,980
Could you promise
that you'll try?

2038
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:09,119
- I'll try.
- I can't ask for more.

2039
01:28:09,186 --> 01:28:11,524
- I'd love to.
- I can't talk anymore.

2040
01:28:11,591 --> 01:28:13,361
Okay, bye.

2041
01:28:13,428 --> 01:28:15,899
Bye.

2042
01:28:15,967 --> 01:28:16,969
- No, it does not.
- That's not how it works.

2043
01:28:17,035 --> 01:28:18,004
- Let me try.
- One at a time.

2044
01:28:18,071 --> 01:28:19,139
It's a one at a time thing!

2045
01:28:19,206 --> 01:28:20,108
You've been doing it
this whole time.

2046
01:28:20,175 --> 01:28:21,944
It's one at a time thing.

2047
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:32,734
So where's your dad?

2048
01:28:32,799 --> 01:28:35,372
- He's making craft beer?
- No way.

2049
01:28:35,438 --> 01:28:37,342
He's always doing
weird stuff like that.

2050
01:28:37,409 --> 01:28:39,780
That... whatever makes him happy,
I guess.

2051
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:42,052
- Feel weird.
- Oh, God.

2052
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:45,925
- Week?
- A month, a year, life.

2053
01:28:47,229 --> 01:28:48,798
I'm also really... I'm sorry
that I didn't know what

2054
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:51,237
was going on with you and Kevin.
I mean, I guess nobody did.

2055
01:28:51,304 --> 01:28:52,906
- I wish you knew.
- I didn't tell anyone.

2056
01:28:52,973 --> 01:28:54,310
It's just so embarrassing,

2057
01:28:54,376 --> 01:28:56,580
and he's so embarrassing,
honestly.

2058
01:28:56,648 --> 01:28:58,117
He is.

2059
01:28:58,184 --> 01:28:59,887
Were you embarrassed
when I first brought him around?

2060
01:28:59,953 --> 01:29:01,290
No.

2061
01:29:01,357 --> 01:29:03,061
I'm never gonna get him
out of that garage.

2062
01:29:03,127 --> 01:29:04,596
He will not go.

2063
01:29:04,664 --> 01:29:08,037
There's creative ways
to get them out of there too.

2064
01:29:08,104 --> 01:29:09,340
[laughs]
Yeah.

2065
01:29:09,406 --> 01:29:12,946
Like loud sex with someone
in the house.

2066
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:15,619
- That's a good idea.
- Oh, my God.

2067
01:29:15,686 --> 01:29:19,226
Well, why don't I give you
a tour of the farm?

2068
01:29:19,293 --> 01:29:21,964
- Let's do it.
- Cool.

2069
01:29:22,032 --> 01:29:24,771
- How's Max?
- He does drugs.

2070
01:29:24,838 --> 01:29:28,978
I learned. Just weed, though.

2071
01:29:29,046 --> 01:29:30,982
We did a lot worse than that.

2072
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:32,820
Shh, shh-shh-shh-shh.

2073
01:29:32,886 --> 01:29:34,289
We don't talk about that.

2074
01:29:35,959 --> 01:29:37,963
Katie would love
this place, man.

2075
01:29:41,170 --> 01:29:43,541
What are those assholes doing?

2076
01:29:43,609 --> 01:29:45,445
Oh, they thought Gigi
was serious about there

2077
01:29:45,512 --> 01:29:47,516
being something valuable
on the farm.

2078
01:29:49,153 --> 01:29:53,361
What if she was?

2079
01:29:53,428 --> 01:29:55,198
We've done this area,
it's finished.

2080
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:56,367
I don't know what I've done.

2081
01:29:56,434 --> 01:29:57,969
Because you won't stop talking
to me.

2082
01:29:58,036 --> 01:29:59,973
Just share it, man.

2083
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:05,084
Share it, share it, share it.
I will shock you with this.

2084
01:30:05,151 --> 01:30:06,052
It's... you can't shock
me with this!

2085
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,222
Yes, you can.

2086
01:30:07,289 --> 01:30:08,659
- It shocks at the bott...
- Hey.

2087
01:30:08,725 --> 01:30:09,894
It shocks at the bottom.

2088
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,602
They say you can choose
your friends, not your family,

2089
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:17,476
but you can choose
to be friends with your family.

2090
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:19,011
- It's going well.
- Let's go to a different area.

2091
01:30:19,079 --> 01:30:20,515
- We've done a lot.
- I can tell.

2092
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:21,952
- All right.
- We're gonna start back.

2093
01:30:22,017 --> 01:30:23,488
I want to... stop.

2094
01:30:23,554 --> 01:30:26,160
It's time to look
to the future.

2095
01:30:26,227 --> 01:30:29,233
Well, not for me, but-but you.

2096
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:30,936
And after a year like this one,

2097
01:30:31,002 --> 01:30:35,913
the future sounds
like a pretty good idea.

2098
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:38,150
Whoa-ho-ho!

2099
01:30:38,217 --> 01:30:40,990
Oh! Whoa! Whoa.

2100
01:30:41,055 --> 01:30:44,329
- Jump on it.
- Whoa.

2101
01:30:44,396 --> 01:30:46,233
- All the way. All the way.
- Ooh!

2102
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:48,404
[singing]
And the cries of the street

2103
01:30:48,471 --> 01:30:50,441
into us

2104
01:30:50,508 --> 01:30:51,845
[rock music]

2105
01:30:51,912 --> 01:30:54,283
Our love will still be there

2106
01:30:55,986 --> 01:30:59,058
Our love will still be there

2107
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:04,202
When the rain from the sky
don't fall and the stars...

2108
01:31:04,269 --> 01:31:06,140
- And here we go.
- We're gonna clap.

2109
01:31:06,206 --> 01:31:07,777
Okay, great.

2110
01:31:07,843 --> 01:31:10,248
What? The rooster?

2111
01:31:10,315 --> 01:31:14,189
All right, and Ann,
give me a clap.

2112
01:31:14,256 --> 01:31:15,558
Clap city.

2113
01:31:15,626 --> 01:31:19,266
- All right, Judy.
- Yup, good. Thank you.

2114
01:31:19,333 --> 01:31:22,673
Mac, give me a good clap
in front of your face.

2115
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:24,443
And Scott.

2116
01:31:24,509 --> 01:31:28,184
Okay, great.
Thank you. There we go. Okay.

2117
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:31,323
Margo. All right, great.

2118
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:33,494
- Okay, I'm still rolling.
- Should I go ahead and cut?

2119
01:31:33,561 --> 01:31:37,134
There we go. Good. Thank you.

2120
01:31:37,202 --> 01:31:38,371
Timothy.

2121
01:31:41,076 --> 01:31:43,214
[laughs]

2122
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:46,186
Casey. Thank you.

2123
01:31:46,253 --> 01:31:49,326
Henry? Henry?

2124
01:31:49,393 --> 01:31:50,729
How often did you change
your clothes

2125
01:31:50,796 --> 01:31:52,365
during the lockdown?

2126
01:31:52,432 --> 01:31:55,505
Welcome to this crazy thing
we're about to do.

2127
01:31:55,571 --> 01:31:57,710
- Hey, Billy.
- Howdy.

2128
01:31:57,777 --> 01:31:59,012
Nice to meet you.

2129
01:31:59,079 --> 01:32:00,314
Back at ya.

2130
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:02,185
Once I get a set from Luke,

2131
01:32:02,252 --> 01:32:03,487
'cause he'll confirm

2132
01:32:03,554 --> 01:32:05,391
that all the cameras
are actually rolling,

2133
01:32:05,458 --> 01:32:06,928
and then I'll tell Stephanie
we're ready,

2134
01:32:06,995 --> 01:32:08,397
and she'll call action.

2135
01:32:08,464 --> 01:32:10,903
So everyone's got their slate.
They've all put it up.

2136
01:32:10,969 --> 01:32:12,138
Well, I haven't.

2137
01:32:12,205 --> 01:32:13,709
- That's all right.
- That's all right.

2138
01:32:13,775 --> 01:32:15,344
- It's okay.
- Margo, it's fine.

2139
01:32:15,411 --> 01:32:18,517
- Is that a three, Billy?
- Yeah.

2140
01:32:18,584 --> 01:32:20,121
Do I have to push anything

2141
01:32:20,188 --> 01:32:23,260
on the microphone
or just turn it off?

2142
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:26,400
Well, let me ask you,
are both of my cameras rolling?

2143
01:32:26,467 --> 01:32:28,137
Do I want to record
the Zoom too?

2144
01:32:28,205 --> 01:32:29,941
No.

2145
01:32:30,007 --> 01:32:32,880
And Susie's gonna give, like,
a handheld POV shot.

2146
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:34,217
Gonna DP you.

2147
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:35,953
When you're ready and action.

2148
01:32:36,019 --> 01:32:40,261
Should we try to do this one
much closer to book?

2149
01:32:40,328 --> 01:32:41,865
- Yeah, I think you should.
- Yeah.

2150
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:44,169
Is it really... I just need
to catch that beat for them.

2151
01:32:44,237 --> 01:32:45,739
If you... just catch the beat,

2152
01:32:45,806 --> 01:32:49,647
and then you can use all
of that wonderful stuff.

2153
01:32:49,714 --> 01:32:51,618
So if we... if we miss
the beat...

2154
01:32:51,684 --> 01:32:54,156
I will call a reset, and we'll
go back and get the beat.

2155
01:32:54,222 --> 01:32:55,259
Give me the beat.

2156
01:32:55,324 --> 01:32:56,761
They should turn
the beat around.

2157
01:32:56,828 --> 01:33:00,501
Nope, no point in discussing
anything technical with me.

2158
01:33:00,568 --> 01:33:03,040
Well, you mean I was not
the only technical dummy?

2159
01:33:03,107 --> 01:33:04,476
Can't possibly be my fault.

2160
01:33:04,543 --> 01:33:06,948
- Lot of issues there today.
- Lot of issues.

2161
01:33:07,015 --> 01:33:08,450
- Hey, don't worry.
- We're gonna fix it in post.

2162
01:33:08,517 --> 01:33:10,722
If you go lower, not so good.

2163
01:33:10,789 --> 01:33:13,327
Oh, that's 'cause you're not
wearing pants, Margo.

2164
01:33:13,394 --> 01:33:15,064
I'm kind of blown away
by the fact

2165
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:16,801
there may be life on Venus.

2166
01:33:16,868 --> 01:33:18,370
Didn't the government,
like, reveal

2167
01:33:18,437 --> 01:33:20,709
that they have,
like, UFO's are confirmed.

2168
01:33:20,776 --> 01:33:21,577
Yeah.

2169
01:33:21,644 --> 01:33:22,545
And then we're just like,

2170
01:33:22,613 --> 01:33:23,949
"Eh, well, it's Tuesday."

2171
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:27,121
- Even a touch more.
- Just a nudge, Scott.

2172
01:33:27,188 --> 01:33:30,629
- That's it. The light color.
- Yeah. Perfect.

2173
01:33:30,696 --> 01:33:33,133
Yeah, can you do me
a bit favor, y'all?

2174
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:37,575
Can we shoot my side a bit
so that I can get Rick

2175
01:33:37,643 --> 01:33:40,114
to help me move the barbecue?

2176
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:41,284
Margo?

2177
01:33:41,351 --> 01:33:43,855
- Yeah.
- I don't see you.

2178
01:33:43,922 --> 01:33:46,661
But you know, the-the camera...
are you trying...

2179
01:33:46,728 --> 01:33:48,063
are you talking
about the camera?

2180
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:50,501
I'm trying to turn
this-this off.

2181
01:33:50,568 --> 01:33:53,308
- I like the "Do me a favor.
- Don't yell at me."

2182
01:33:53,375 --> 01:33:55,278
It's really good.
[both laugh]

2183
01:33:55,345 --> 01:33:56,848
Let's take Judy, Henry,

2184
01:33:56,915 --> 01:33:58,517
and Margo
to a breakout room, please.

2185
01:33:58,584 --> 01:34:00,021
Bye.

2186
01:34:00,087 --> 01:34:01,324
And then just to say, sorry,
you weren't with her.

2187
01:34:01,391 --> 01:34:06,066
And then... and you could just say
she didn't want me there.

2188
01:34:06,133 --> 01:34:07,502
I'm sorry you couldn't be
with her.

2189
01:34:07,568 --> 01:34:09,139
Yeah.

2190
01:34:09,205 --> 01:34:10,309
She didn't want me there.

2191
01:34:10,375 --> 01:34:11,744
It might just be power strips,

2192
01:34:11,811 --> 01:34:14,049
but if I had one,
it would be there, right?

2193
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:15,518
- Okay, I'll check it out.
- Okay.

2194
01:34:15,584 --> 01:34:17,623
Maybe don't wet your hair,
Casey.

2195
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:20,696
- You got it.
- Let's reset from the top.

2196
01:34:20,762 --> 01:34:22,399
Just there's, like,
a loud rooster

2197
01:34:22,465 --> 01:34:23,601
that Katie has been dealing with

2198
01:34:23,668 --> 01:34:25,237
the whole fucking time
at the farm.

2199
01:34:25,304 --> 01:34:27,041
You know you're at the farm
if you like... if you're like,

2200
01:34:27,108 --> 01:34:28,712
"I'm gonna kill
that fucking rooster,"

2201
01:34:28,778 --> 01:34:31,216
or "I'm gonna shoot
that rooster," would be better.

2202
01:34:31,283 --> 01:34:32,485
Yeah, give me.

2203
01:34:32,552 --> 01:34:34,155
Yo, that's the name
of the movie.

2204
01:34:34,222 --> 01:34:36,461
Yo, that's the name
of the movie.

2205
01:34:36,526 --> 01:34:38,263
Billy, you gotta say that.

2206
01:34:38,331 --> 01:34:40,267
- Oh, my God.
- I'm gonna shoot that rooster.

2207
01:34:40,335 --> 01:34:41,704
Okay, let's cut.

2208
01:34:41,771 --> 01:34:43,574
Go ahead and stop our cameras

2209
01:34:43,641 --> 01:34:45,612
from recording
and our microphone, please.

2210
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:47,048
Thank you.

2211
01:34:47,115 --> 01:34:48,918
- Bye, bye.
- See you all tomorrow.

2212
01:34:48,985 --> 01:34:50,588
- Thank you, June.
- Bye, June.

2213
01:34:50,655 --> 01:34:52,125
See you tomorrow.

2214
01:34:52,191 --> 01:34:55,264
[singing]
Our love will still be there
