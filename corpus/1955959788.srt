<i>The 1924 Paris Olympics are history.</i>

00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,124
<i>Eric Liddell, the Brit who
snatched the gold in the 400 meter,</i>

5
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,691

6
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:49,590
<i>But the famous athlete, who,

<i>from dozens of American brands, has
respectfully said no to one and all.</i>

<i>There, they will raise a family.</i>

12
00:01:03,327 --> 00:01:06,624
<i>He will teach and live
a productive life.</i>

13
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:09,791
<i>For Mr. Liddell, offering a
helping hand and some hope</i>

14
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:11,894
<i>provides all the riches he needs.</i>

00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,859
<i>With any luck, you will
find someone in your life</i>

16
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,625
<i>to help make you a worthy person.</i>

17
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:40,193
<i>That luck came to me many years ago</i>

18
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:42,460
<i>when I met the Flying Scotsman.</i>

19
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:46,928
<i>His name was Eric Liddell.</i>

20
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:38,330
<i>The whole world came to know him</i>

21
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:40,629
<i>when he refused to
run the 400-meter race</i>

22
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:42,694
<i>scheduled on a Sunday,</i>

23
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:46,462
<i>which he reserved for the time he
spent rejoicing with his family</i>

24
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:49,730
<i>and giving thanks for the many
blessings bestowed upon them.</i>

25
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:52,863
<i>In the glory of winning,</i>

26
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:56,830
<i>he became famous for a man who
stood up for his principles.</i>

27
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:01,331
<i>But to him, it was not
such a grand gesture.</i>

28
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,797
<i>After he completed his education,</i>

29
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,966
<i>he returned to China where he taught
chemistry, English and athletics.</i>

30
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:35,530
<i>The many years of the Japanese
fighting the Chinese had worn away</i>

31
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:40,329
<i>our happiness and brought a
great misery to our people.</i>

32
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:55,666
Get the soldiers!

33
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:00,501
Hold it! Hold it!

34
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:56,433
<i>Born poor, I developed my ways.</i>

35
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:57,867
<i>I made it work</i>

36
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:01,701
<i>whenever and however
it became necessary.</i>

37
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:05,235
<i>Professor Liddell called
me by my name, Xu Niu,</i>

38
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:09,302
<i>and paid me to drive him to teach the
poor children in the schools there.</i>

39
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:28,569
In we go!

40
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,935
Up, up. Up, up. Sit down.

41
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:33,871
Quiet, please. Sit down.

42
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,369
P for Peter, C for Cat.

43
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,435
Cat?

44
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:43,402
Er, Dong Nong? Dong Nang?

45
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:21,139
No!

46
00:06:22,473 --> 00:06:23,873
Song, no!

47
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:31,740
Song! Song!

48
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:43,472
<i>In my early years,</i>

49
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:46,371
<i>I would only run from
a nest of hornets</i>

50
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,075
<i>or escape a man who
would put me in jail.</i>

51
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:52,041
<i>But I would run with Mr. Li.</i>

52
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:55,407
<i>Running helped him find peace.</i>

53
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,272
<i>But on this day,</i>

54
00:06:58,274 --> 00:07:00,872
<i>I was struck by his fearlessness</i>

55
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:05,508
<i>as he ran to find peace in
the face of an escalating war.</i>

56
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,372
Florence is gonna kill you for this.

57
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:13,976
Me, too, most probably.

58
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:17,642
She'd do the same in my place.

59
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,940
We came here to help these people.

60
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,410
What will they think if we jump on
a ship at the first sign of trouble?

61
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:28,342
Your children are people, too, Eric.

62
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:35,609
They're young. Florence
will be there for them.

63
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,343
Let me finish what I started.

64
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:46,576
Please, give this to someone in need.

65
00:08:00,944 --> 00:08:02,175
- Shh.
- Daddy, I'm scared.

66
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:04,009
It's all right. It's all right.

67
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:07,175
Now, listen, how does that...
How does that melody go

68
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:09,440
that Mommy loves so much?

69
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:10,777
Can you help me?

70
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:15,843
<i>♪♪ Be still my soul</i>

00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:21,576

72
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:22,709
You have a go.

75
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:43,780
Florence.

76
00:09:00,346 --> 00:09:02,112
Thank the Lord they're good sleepers.

77
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,577
I promised to help the
hospital in Xiaozhang.

78
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:10,911
They need medical supplies more than ever.

79
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:12,043
And now Robert's son is...

80
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:14,077
Sick. Yes, I know.

81
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:16,513
And he had to go back to
England to care for him.

82
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:19,680
But your brother is a doctor.

83
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:21,546
You're not.

84
00:09:27,415 --> 00:09:28,915
We've made a family.

85
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,415
Not just God's family, our own.

86
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,912
I love you, Florence.

87
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,914
Absolutely and utterly.

88
00:09:56,516 --> 00:09:58,783
I know what sort of man I married.

89
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:06,415
Now help me pack.

90
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,082
Come on, Heather. Xu looks
magnificent, doesn't he?

91
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,717
There you go.

92
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:29,649
Xu.

93
00:10:31,684 --> 00:10:33,983
Please take good care
of him while we're away.

94
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,948
You can count on me, Ms. Li.

95
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,850
I will make sure Eric is safe.

96
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:54,282
<i>Prior to the occupation,</i>

97
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:56,448
<i>Mr. Li had applied for a furlough</i>

98
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,548
<i>from the London Missionary Society,</i>

99
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,616
<i>allowing him to travel to
Canada with his family,</i>

100
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:04,218
<i>but permission had not yet arrived.</i>

101
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:09,383
<i>He felt he was duty bound
to serve those in need</i>

102
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,718
<i>in the good times and the bad.</i>

103
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,417
Well, you know I'll be
there as soon as I can.

104
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:33,149
You have to let your
grandmother know we're all fine.

105
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,718
You have to show her how beautiful
your handwriting has become,

106
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,219
and I have to show the children here
how to write as beautifully as you do.

107
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:51,417
Please don't think this is a gold medal.

108
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,919
Oh, Florence.

109
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,919
I love you.

110
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:02,419
One last hug, darlings.

111
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,052
We'll be together again soon.

112
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:06,120
We'll all be together again soon.

113
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:11,352
Ladies and gentlemen.

114
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,884
Anybody who is not sailing
with us, please leave the boat.

115
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:15,187
I'll be home soon.

116
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,654
- Bye.
- Bye.

117
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:28,721
I love you.

118
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:30,819
I'm going to miss you.

119
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:31,885
I'll miss you, too.

120
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:33,519
I'll be home soon.

121
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,519
You look after the new
baby for me now, okay?

122
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,720
You promise?

123
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,819
I promise.

124
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:39,088
Promise?

125
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:50,519
<i>Even though the Japanese Imperial Army
had looted and taken over his home,</i>

126
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:54,887
<i>Mr. Li believed in
praying for his enemies.</i>

127
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:59,120
<i>I had other thoughts, but
I kept them to myself,</i>

128
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:01,755
<i>as I was learning to respect Mr. Li.</i>

129
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:09,022
<i>Much time would pass before I found
the value in thinking his way.</i>

130
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:19,021
<i>Mr. Li was forced to leave his home and
seek shelter with the other refugees</i>

131
00:13:19,023 --> 00:13:21,257
<i>at the school where he was teaching.</i>

132
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:05,124
For me?

133
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:23,526
Let's go for a run. Come on, now!

134
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:58,226
<i>He ran every day without fail.</i>

135
00:14:59,094 --> 00:15:02,526
<i>It took me some time to realize</i>

136
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,795
<i>he was running not just for himself,</i>

137
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:07,127
<i>but for us.</i>

138
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:45,594
So, gather around.

139
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:49,129
Ferrous sulfide.

140
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:53,063
Acid.

141
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:57,429
You smell?

142
00:16:57,297 --> 00:17:02,232
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Good girl.

143
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:08,598
What have you got?

144
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:12,633
Oh!

145
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:21,565
Maureen.

146
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:56,534
Come here.

147
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:08,866
Yes, that's me.

148
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,903
Before the hair slipped
off the back of my head.

149
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:13,270
Where on earth did you find this?

150
00:18:14,536 --> 00:18:17,034
I have my way. Found it a long time ago.

151
00:18:17,036 --> 00:18:18,400
It's for you.

152
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:19,701
Thanks.

153
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,435
You know, would you help me find an
orphanage that can look after him?

154
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:56,700
Well, listen, I was born here,

155
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,770
so surely that makes me Chinese, too, no?

156
00:19:19,603 --> 00:19:22,103
You know, I've been living
here for half my life,

157
00:19:22,105 --> 00:19:24,103
so I raise a cup to you,

158
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,270
my friends,

159
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:29,337
with a drink that comes from my first home.

160
00:19:41,604 --> 00:19:44,005
Oof!

161
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,771
You know my...

162
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,838
You know my brother Robert?

163
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,104
He ran the hospital in Xiaozhang.

164
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:58,071
He wrote to me before he left, asking
for supplies for the doctors there,

165
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,440
if we can buy them.

166
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:10,907
No. Your father give you this.

167
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,740
I'm afraid it's all I have now.

168
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:16,808
But he would have been
happy if it could help.

169
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,941
No, not with this.

170
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:21,804
Please.

171
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:23,440
I hope it's worth enough.

172
00:20:25,907 --> 00:20:27,373
It's quite a long list.

173
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:13,209
Oh, no.

174
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,210
Let me handle this.

175
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:34,843
I'm so sorry.

176
00:21:59,745 --> 00:22:01,045
Teaching. Teaching.

177
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:06,377
Thank you.

178
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:29,143
<i>As the months passed,</i>

179
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:32,511
<i>we encountered many close calls
with the Japanese soldiers.</i>

180
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:35,611
<i>Life was full of danger,</i>

181
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:38,410
<i>and we were often caught in
the crossfire of the armies</i>

182
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,344
<i>that fought each other.</i>

183
00:22:40,346 --> 00:22:43,211
<i>With Eric's dedication
to help those in need</i>

184
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:46,344
<i>and my connections
to the underground,</i>

185
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:48,913
<i>we found ways to
accomplish our missions.</i>

186
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:00,614
Well, that wasn't so bad.

187
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:18,879
Eric, do you mind?

188
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:21,547
There is a dying patient to pray over.

189
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:23,083
Of course. Come on.

190
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:43,678
Go!

191
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,115
Come on! Come on!

192
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,183
You've got two hands, don't you?

193
00:24:28,983 --> 00:24:30,416
Repeat after me.

194
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:32,615
"I, Hugh."

195
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:34,082
I, Hugh.

196
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:36,682
"Take thee, Catherine,
to be my wedded wife."

197
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,449
Take thee, Catherine, to be my wedded wife.

198
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:43,015
"To have and to hold
from this day forward."

199
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:45,883
To have and to hold from this day forward.

200
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,716
"For better, for worse."

201
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:49,015
For better, for worse.

202
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:50,718
"For richer, for poorer..."

203
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:08,984
Please, this is a house of God.
Could we have the weapons...

204
00:25:30,152 --> 00:25:33,453
Captain, you have no right
to be here. Could we just...

205
00:25:48,855 --> 00:25:51,121
Captain, you have no right to be here.

206
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,087
We are at war.

207
00:29:18,662 --> 00:29:21,730
No, no, we're, we're
married. We're... Go this way?

208
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,793
No, no, we're together.

209
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:27,060
We're married. We go together.

210
00:29:27,062 --> 00:29:29,761
No, no. Hold on a second. Hold on.
You can't separate us. We're together!

211
00:29:29,763 --> 00:29:31,063
Hold on!

212
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:36,126
Catherine is my wife.

213
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,728
Let us live together.

214
00:29:38,396 --> 00:29:39,695
How could you prove?

215
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:41,996
You can! You were there!
You were at the wedding!

216
00:29:53,863 --> 00:29:55,795
No.

217
00:29:55,797 --> 00:30:00,298
Whom God hath joined together,
let no man put asunder.

218
00:30:10,797 --> 00:30:13,765
My Emperor is the god here.

219
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,532
Huh?

220
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,129
We do not serve false gods.

221
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:22,632
Please.

222
00:31:17,366 --> 00:31:19,064
You're a big guy. Come on, take my bunk.

223
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:20,931
We'll get through this, together.

224
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:21,998
Hey, doc.

225
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,166
David, hey.

226
00:31:23,168 --> 00:31:24,433
I came across this.

227
00:31:24,435 --> 00:31:25,768
I think it's more your style.

228
00:31:28,968 --> 00:31:30,268
Thank you.

229
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:33,434
Yeah.

230
00:32:35,971 --> 00:32:37,271
Xiao, Xiao.

231
00:33:35,505 --> 00:33:36,836
See?

232
00:33:36,838 --> 00:33:38,139
No!

233
00:33:41,474 --> 00:33:42,773
Get up!

234
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,739
Get up!

235
00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:47,906
Who is Eric Liddell?

236
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:49,606
Who?

237
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:51,341
I am!

238
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,739
You go.

239
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:05,940
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

240
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:22,074
What? He wants to race?

241
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:27,541
And train.

242
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:35,675
I want a fair fight.

243
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:42,142
When you release us, I will race.

244
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:45,641
You have no choice.

245
00:34:51,607 --> 00:34:52,908
We found these.

246
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:49,078
<i>Xiao Shitou and I had
searched for days.</i>

247
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,509
<i>When we found the camp,</i>

248
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:54,942
<i>it had been turned into a prison</i>

249
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,945
<i>and more intimidating than
I had ever encountered.</i>

250
00:36:02,312 --> 00:36:07,109
<i>I knew then I would have to
employ the ways of my past</i>

251
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:09,480
<i>to be of any help to my friend.</i>

252
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:16,113
Shitou!

253
00:37:09,115 --> 00:37:11,380
Christmas has come early, Dr. Hubbard.

254
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,950
Good luck.

255
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:14,915
I missed you so much.

256
00:38:32,217 --> 00:38:33,484
God, I missed you.

257
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:34,786
I missed you, too.

258
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:40,251
Look at you.

259
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,650
I'll try and shave next time.

260
00:38:48,418 --> 00:38:50,152
You shouldn't have stayed here.

261
00:38:50,418 --> 00:38:52,649
Hey, hey, hey.

262
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:55,752
No, no, no.

263
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:58,854
It's okay. Look.

264
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:05,120
I made it for you.

265
00:39:05,585 --> 00:39:07,285
No diamonds this time.

266
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:15,719
You stay, I stay. Remember?

267
00:39:25,653 --> 00:39:26,751
We're going. We're going.

268
00:39:26,753 --> 00:39:28,086
Come on!

269
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:29,588
Come on! She's going, okay?

270
00:39:37,253 --> 00:39:38,986
There's a mountain out here.

271
00:39:38,988 --> 00:39:41,751
You see the little lamb when it's lost,

272
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:44,620
and we're singing a song
to bring the lamb back.

273
00:39:44,622 --> 00:39:47,251
<i>♪♪ There were ninety and nine</i>

274
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:49,586
<i>♪♪ That safely lay</i>

275
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:53,154
<i>♪♪ In the shelter of the fold</i>

276
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:58,853
<i>♪♪ But one was
lost On the hills away</i>

277
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:02,785
<i>♪♪ Far off from
The gates of gold</i>

278
00:40:02,787 --> 00:40:04,519
Happy, happy, we're gonna get this.

279
00:40:04,521 --> 00:40:09,520
<i>♪♪ There were ninety
and nine That safely lay</i>

280
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:13,955
<i>♪♪ In the shelter of the fold</i>

281
00:40:13,957 --> 00:40:18,488
<i>♪♪ But one was

282
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,822
<i>♪♪ Far off from The
gates of gold ♪♪</i>

283
00:40:59,692 --> 00:41:01,792
Now, the trees convert

284
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:03,856
the carbon dioxide.

285
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:09,657
Carbon dioxide, C02 into oxygen.

286
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:13,389
The tree also uses the
process of photosynthesis,

287
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:14,923
which we talked about earlier.

288
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:18,124
Now, question, where does
the tree get its water from?

289
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:20,222
The roots. Yes, the roots.

290
00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:21,492
Stop!

291
00:41:51,826 --> 00:41:55,293
You got this. Come on!

292
00:42:02,426 --> 00:42:05,024
Eric! Eric! Eric!

293
00:42:05,026 --> 00:42:08,493
Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric!

294
00:42:08,495 --> 00:42:11,626
Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric!

295
00:42:56,096 --> 00:42:59,995
Eric! Eric! Eric!

296
00:43:02,628 --> 00:43:05,762
Eric! Eric!

297
00:43:16,462 --> 00:43:17,992
Damn it.

298
00:43:17,994 --> 00:43:19,664
No, it's not fair!

299
00:43:29,929 --> 00:43:31,761
I said it's not fair!

300
00:43:31,763 --> 00:43:33,163
Nicely done.

301
00:43:35,297 --> 00:43:36,394
Come on! Come on!

302
00:43:36,396 --> 00:43:37,762
Look at him! He's starving!

303
00:43:37,764 --> 00:43:39,795
Get off me!

304
00:43:39,797 --> 00:43:42,497
You won today's race the
day Japan invaded China.

305
00:43:42,798 --> 00:43:43,894
No...

306
00:43:43,896 --> 00:43:45,398
Come on! He's down already!

307
00:43:52,865 --> 00:43:54,165
We all thank you.

308
00:46:15,438 --> 00:46:16,704
Li.

309
00:46:17,204 --> 00:46:18,504
Eric.

310
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:22,470
Here you go.

311
00:46:25,505 --> 00:46:27,901
They'll kill you. They'll kill you.

312
00:46:27,903 --> 00:46:29,734
How did you get here?

313
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:32,671
You know, I have my way.

314
00:46:32,904 --> 00:46:34,236
Your ways...

315
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:50,302
David. David needs water.

316
00:46:50,304 --> 00:46:51,605
He needs water.

317
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,473
I have something for you.

318
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:30,840
Eric, you anger the Japanese.

319
00:47:31,673 --> 00:47:33,905
They're going to kill you.

320
00:47:33,907 --> 00:47:35,739
We need to get you out of here.

321
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:39,140
What good will that do the others?

322
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:40,839
Hope.

323
00:47:41,973 --> 00:47:43,940
What do they have without you?

324
00:48:57,609 --> 00:48:58,675
Welcome back, chaps.

325
00:48:58,677 --> 00:48:59,774
Can you walk okay?

326
00:48:59,776 --> 00:49:01,043
Sit down here, David.

327
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,444
Okay, Eric, right here.

328
00:49:05,844 --> 00:49:08,175
How are you feeling?
You're back. You're here.

329
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:10,178
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Anything broken?

330
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:12,975
Eric. Anything I need to know about?

331
00:49:12,977 --> 00:49:14,644
You're okay? You sure?

332
00:49:17,011 --> 00:49:21,212
Get some water in you, and let's
have a look at this eye. Okay?

333
00:50:29,647 --> 00:50:33,845
I hear the Japanese keep on
losing battles at the front line.

334
00:50:33,847 --> 00:50:36,614
This is their second time
food truck didn't come.

335
00:50:37,747 --> 00:50:39,578
I made them a deal.

336
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,780
Ten o'clock Saturday night.

337
00:50:42,481 --> 00:50:43,848
Two times a month.

338
00:51:11,448 --> 00:51:15,113
<i>Life in prison was taking
its toll on everyone,</i>

339
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:16,515
<i>including the guards.</i>

340
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:21,317
<i>I made a bargain with
sources inside the prison.</i>

341
00:51:22,116 --> 00:51:23,547
<i>However,</i>

342
00:51:23,549 --> 00:51:26,382
<i>grave danger existed from the guards</i>

343
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:30,317
<i>who would never bargain away
the Emperor's imperial power.</i>

344
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,613
"N-A." Big "N," small "A."

345
00:51:39,615 --> 00:51:42,848
Sodium mixed with chloride gives
us... What do you sprinkle in the...

346
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,151
Salt.

347
00:51:48,283 --> 00:51:49,784
Xiao Shitou!

348
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:54,750
Come here. What surprises
do you have for us, huh?

349
00:52:02,649 --> 00:52:03,948
Here we go.

350
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,251
That's yours.

351
00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:13,384
Xiao Shitou, would you like
me to teach you some chemistry?

352
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:17,518
Would you like Daisy to
teach you some English?

353
00:53:19,055 --> 00:53:20,621
...of the season.

354
00:53:21,222 --> 00:53:22,954
And this time of year when...

355
00:53:24,388 --> 00:53:28,221
When the light of the season...

356
00:53:30,189 --> 00:53:31,319
And they fall!

357
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:32,519
Sit down, Daisy!

358
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:34,488
I'm trying to conduct a class!

359
00:53:50,023 --> 00:53:51,756
Let's take a small break.

360
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:54,422
I'm sorry.

361
00:53:54,922 --> 00:53:56,190
I'm sorry.

362
00:54:10,924 --> 00:54:12,055
Is Eric okay?

363
00:55:50,927 --> 00:55:52,193
Hey!

364
00:56:29,896 --> 00:56:31,195
Xu Niu!

365
00:56:44,161 --> 00:56:45,727
Please.

366
00:56:45,729 --> 00:56:47,861
Please, you've got to get me out of here.

367
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:50,195
Look... Look at what they've done to me.

368
00:56:51,263 --> 00:56:52,529
Please.

369
00:56:53,496 --> 00:56:55,193
Xu Niu, please, you've got to save me.

370
00:56:55,195 --> 00:56:56,496
They're gonna kill me.

371
00:57:31,897 --> 00:57:33,197
Come.

372
00:57:34,898 --> 00:57:36,198
Xiao.

373
00:57:39,797 --> 00:57:41,063
Get in.

374
00:59:22,836 --> 00:59:24,669
Who helped David Marshall escape?

375
00:59:40,003 --> 00:59:41,168
No, no!

376
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:42,801
Catherine! Catherine! Catherine!

377
00:59:42,803 --> 00:59:45,037
I don't know anything, okay?

378
00:59:46,469 --> 00:59:47,870
I don't know anything!

379
00:59:48,469 --> 00:59:49,737
Stop punishing us.

380
00:59:52,137 --> 00:59:54,468
You're supposed to be
protecting us, not punishing us!

381
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:57,437
If you have lost our friend,
then you must find him for us.

382
00:59:59,837 --> 01:00:02,371
You will all be punished
until I get a name.

383
01:00:14,538 --> 01:00:16,837
<i>David had made it out of prison.</i>

384
01:00:16,839 --> 01:00:20,103
<i>He decided to join the
underground resistance forces</i>

385
01:00:20,105 --> 01:00:24,035
<i>to receive and translate news
about Japan's increasing struggles</i>

386
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,505
<i>to win the war.</i>

387
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:30,870
Catherine. Come on, no, no, no.

388
01:00:30,872 --> 01:00:32,137
You can't help like this.

389
01:00:32,139 --> 01:00:33,370
No!

390
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:38,406
No! No!

391
01:01:28,741 --> 01:01:30,140
Follow my finger.

392
01:01:35,174 --> 01:01:36,475
Both eyes.

393
01:01:37,874 --> 01:01:39,472
It's painful over here.

394
01:01:39,474 --> 01:01:41,176
Right, it's this side, isn't it?

395
01:01:45,209 --> 01:01:46,509
Is that sore?

396
01:01:46,975 --> 01:01:48,838
Deep inside.

397
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,740
Migraines are just more frequent now.

398
01:01:50,742 --> 01:01:52,074
All right, okay.

399
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,009
Stand up.

400
01:01:57,409 --> 01:01:58,709
Both feet.

401
01:02:00,141 --> 01:02:01,205
Sit down.

402
01:02:01,207 --> 01:02:02,508
Oh, my God.

403
01:02:07,443 --> 01:02:10,009
My bunk. Put him on my bunk.

404
01:02:11,709 --> 01:02:14,209
We need some warm water and a cloth.

405
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:20,643
Okay. Hugh, can you hear me?

406
01:02:23,643 --> 01:02:25,608
Can you hear me, Hugh?
Do you know where you are?

407
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:26,875
Catherine.

408
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,544
Okay. Put this on your forehead.

409
01:03:12,445 --> 01:03:14,279
Okay, okay, okay.

410
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,180
It may be bronchitis,

411
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:56,413
but more likely an acute
bacterial pneumonia.

412
01:03:59,514 --> 01:04:00,847
He needs medicine.

413
01:04:03,014 --> 01:04:04,311
Soon.

414
01:04:04,313 --> 01:04:05,614
Otherwise...

415
01:04:08,813 --> 01:04:10,114
Any ideas?

416
01:04:39,516 --> 01:04:43,548
Major Kenji, you must provide medicine
for the American, Hugh Johnson.

417
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,746
We have no medicine.

418
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:47,715
We have no food.

419
01:04:49,582 --> 01:04:52,748
Then I must ask that you
turn a blind eye again

420
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:55,880
and let these supplies be smuggled in.

421
01:04:55,882 --> 01:04:58,850
There has been no smuggling in this camp.

422
01:05:02,749 --> 01:05:05,114
Let me race you again.

423
01:05:05,116 --> 01:05:07,850
If I win, you permit one
visitor to bring what we need.

424
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:15,517
We have raced, Mr. Liddell. And I beat you.

425
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:17,384
A proper race.

426
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:11,387
Thank you, Major.

427
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,386
Sunday.

428
01:06:25,387 --> 01:06:28,553
One, two, three, go!

429
01:07:58,256 --> 01:07:59,488
Hope I'm not interrupting.

430
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:00,890
No, no, no.

431
01:08:03,023 --> 01:08:06,556
The whole camp pitched in so
you could have a proper meal,

432
01:08:06,558 --> 01:08:08,225
build up your strength for the race.

433
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:12,058
That's very kind of them,

434
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:15,558
but we all need our strength.

435
01:08:18,557 --> 01:08:21,658
If the shepherd starves,
what becomes of his sheep?

436
01:08:28,691 --> 01:08:30,525
You can't win this race, you know.

437
01:08:31,159 --> 01:08:32,625
You shouldn't even try.

438
01:08:34,058 --> 01:08:35,358
It'll kill you.

439
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:39,956
You know, I've often said
it was the prayers of others

440
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:41,492
that carried me to victory.

441
01:08:43,825 --> 01:08:46,091
Let's give them something to pray for.

442
01:08:46,892 --> 01:08:48,392
Hmm?

443
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:51,158
Let's give them something to pray for.

444
01:09:04,826 --> 01:09:06,425
Come on, boys. Get back. Get back.

445
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,060
Open the door!

446
01:09:12,592 --> 01:09:14,324
I've been here for two years.

447
01:09:14,326 --> 01:09:16,194
I wanted to watch one race!

448
01:09:53,395 --> 01:09:54,695
No shoes?

449
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:03,694
A man runs with his feet, not his shoes.

450
01:10:09,328 --> 01:10:10,394
Quiet!

451
01:10:10,396 --> 01:10:11,493
Come on!

452
01:10:11,495 --> 01:10:13,528
Quiet! This won't help!

453
01:10:16,028 --> 01:10:17,695
Let's pray for him instead.

They're allowing medicine
to be brought in tonight.

472
01:12:23,533 --> 01:12:24,899
I know.

473
01:12:24,901 --> 01:12:26,201
You'll get well soon.

474
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:29,069
You'll get better.

475
01:12:29,367 --> 01:12:30,669
Yes.

Be strong.

477
01:12:35,035 --> 01:12:36,132
You're going to be a father.

478
01:12:37,635 --> 01:12:38,700
What?

479
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:39,800
We thought you knew!

480
01:12:39,802 --> 01:12:41,201
You're pregnant?

481
01:12:41,802 --> 01:12:43,069
Congratulations, Hugh.

482
01:12:44,334 --> 01:12:45,465
You old dog.

495
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:52,222
Hey. Would you let me do that?

496
01:20:54,223 --> 01:20:55,820
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

497
01:20:55,822 --> 01:20:57,587
- Yeah, thank you.
- You're welcome.

498
01:20:57,589 --> 01:20:59,056

Okay.

- Much better.
- Okay.

505
01:21:22,289 --> 01:21:28,121
The Commandant Major Kenji
Kurata has told me that I could be

01:26:54,203 --> 01:26:55,502
The war!

544
01:26:59,237 --> 01:27:01,670
The war's over! The war's over!

545
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:46,271
<i>During our time together,</i>

546
01:27:47,139 --> 01:27:48,870
<i>I had received many gifts</i>

547
01:27:48,872 --> 01:27:53,472
<i>from Eric Liddell that helped
to make me a worthy person.</i>

548
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:56,639
<i>But the greatest gift of all</i>

549
01:27:57,539 --> 01:28:00,639
<i>was his gift of hope.</i>
