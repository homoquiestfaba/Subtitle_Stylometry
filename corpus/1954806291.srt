1
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,794
Tell the boy to sing it again.

2
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:51,569
Thank you, sir.

3
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,528
And God bless you.

4
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,158
Stand there, Captain.

5
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:01,328
Your feet hurt.

6
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:08,168
I don't think
I better sit down.

7
00:01:15,593 --> 00:01:19,597
My feet are tired.

8
00:01:19,638 --> 00:01:21,015
And just for a minute.

9
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,186
I've got a deal for you.

10
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:32,818
You don't collect more than
a dollar every 5 minutes

11
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,612
while you make
your rounds, do you?

12
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:36,989
Oh, no, sir,
not nearly that much.

13
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:41,201
All right, then, keep your seat

14
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:42,703
and be company for a while

15
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:44,038
and every 5 minutes,

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,874
I'll add another dollar
to your collection.

17
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:49,209
You're collecting for a
worthy cause, aren't you?

18
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:55,257
Well, we aren't
supposed to, uh...

19
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,843
I guess I could stay
a few minutes.

20
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,433
My feet do hurt me.

21
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:06,351
Of course they do.

22
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:20,741
Bilbo!

23
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:23,119
Bucket of ice pronto.

24
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:24,536
Yo.

25
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,100
If it were possible,

26
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:49,478
I would offer every moment,
every word,

27
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,230
every thought.

28
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,900
But my memory is too faulty
for total recall.

29
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,778
Instead, I will show
a sequence of events,

30
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,865
some in order, some not.

31
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:04,743
And somewhere along the way
I may discover

32
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:09,123
just what it was
that happened to me.

33
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:12,960
It began at
the 2200 of Cahuenga Boulevard

34
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:16,005
in Hollywood.

35
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:18,132
I'd been tracking iron
for over an hour.

36
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:26,140
284 cars south,
265 north every 10 minutes.

37
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:30,102
A beautiful average
and a wonderful location.

38
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:35,315
It was late July,
and my San Francisco wardrobe

39
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:38,236
was weighing a touch heavy
on my back.

40
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:40,238
It gave me an air of prosperity.

41
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:43,741
At that moment,
I was feeling prosperous.

42
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:46,994
I was about to steal
a used car lot

43
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:48,871
and every car on it.

44
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:51,331
Wait a minute.

45
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:53,042
Now, don't get excited,
Mr. Ealers.

46
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:54,210
My name's Richard Hudson.

47
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:56,420
My business is used cars.

48
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:58,797
I'll take all of these heaps
off your hands

49
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,382
and buy your lease, too.

50
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:02,342
You don't want to work anyway.

51
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:04,720
Why not retire permanent,
enjoy the sun at the beach

52
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:06,097
instead of squatting
in some trailer

53
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:08,224
on a Cahuenga used car lot?

54
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:09,349
And what about my lease?

55
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:11,060
I said I'd take that, too.

56
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:12,477
Yeah, but you didn't mention
what you'd give me for it.

57
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,478
That's right.

58
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,189
I'll give you nothing
for the lease,

59
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:16,857
but I'll take over your burden

60
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,735
and the monthly payments.

61
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:21,570
Cost me a lot of dough here.

62
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,155
I'm not you.

63
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:26,825
Is it a deal or isn't it?

64
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,872
I'll take it.

65
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:34,125
Honest Al could have searched
the world.

66
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,961
He wouldn't have found
a better man than me

67
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:39,880
to open a lot in Los Angeles.

68
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:42,800
To me.

69
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:47,471
Except for one little thing.

70
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:50,266
I was bored.

71
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:54,561
Next.

72
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:03,654
William Harris, Master Sergeant, U.S.
Army, retired.

73
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:05,405
I ran an ad in the "Times"

74
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:06,907
for a manager.

75
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:09,701
And it brought me
an uncut jewel.

76
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:13,580
Bill had never held
a civilian job of any kind.

77
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:15,916
The space provided
for previous employment

78
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,836
was a complete blank.

79
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:20,754
Quite an impressive
background, Bill.

80
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:21,839
Thank you, sir.

81
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,258
Mr. Hudson is fine.
Have a seat.

82
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:33,267
How about getting us a couple of
sodas out of the machine, Bill?

83
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:36,436
Yes, sir, Mr. Hudson.

84
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,243
Respectful independence.

85
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:54,913
What more could
an employer desire?

86
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,166
Do you know how
to run an office, Bill?

87
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,543
Yes, sir. I was a master
sergeant for 5 years,

88
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:01,545
sergeant major for 3 years,
and a first...

89
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:04,173
Ok, then, my office
will be your baby.

90
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:06,675
You hire yourself
a good typist.

91
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:09,594
Read these.

92
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,097
I'll explain the interview
techniques to you later.

93
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,311
Now, I'll work the lot along
with the other salesmen.

94
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:20,064
And when we send a man or a
woman through that door,

95
00:06:20,105 --> 00:06:22,524
they'll be sold
on an automobile.

96
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:24,068
When we turn them over to you,

97
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:26,611
all you have to do
is keep 'em that way.

98
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,323
There are a lot
of little tricks.

99
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:31,325
Many of the buyers
will be lying

100
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:33,452
because of rotten
credit ratings.

101
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:38,123
Those people you will
have to spot and refuse.

102
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,666
Think you can handle that?

103
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,085
Yes, sir.

104
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:42,169
Fine.

105
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:43,462
State your salary.

106
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:47,091
Well, I thought you'd do that.

107
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:50,302
No way. It's not
the American way, Bill.

108
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:51,762
You're out of the army now.

109
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:54,056
The time has come for you
to decide what you're worth.

110
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:56,183
If it's more than I can pay,

111
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:58,477
I'll be sorry to see you go.

112
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:05,525
Now that Al's lot was purchased

113
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:10,030
and my chief man was in place,
I wanted to see mother.

114
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:12,283
I should have driven
up to the strip to celebrate,

115
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:15,119
but my desire for women
was at an all-time low.

116
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:20,207
I knew this was natural
in a period of transition

117
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:22,209
and hard work.

118
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:25,212
But I couldn't help worrying.

119
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:29,133
If a man's sex drive evaporates,
what good is he?

120
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:31,218
I tried not to think about it.

121
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:35,680
I hadn't been home
in some years.

122
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,142
But I remembered that mother
was remarried

123
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:41,395
to a film director
name Leo Steinberg,

124
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:45,357
and ex-boy wonder who had fallen
out of favor with the studios.

125
00:07:55,951 --> 00:07:58,662
You're Leo's daughter.

126
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:01,665
Come in. Come in.

127
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:04,918
I don't think daddy
was expecting you.

128
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,129
Hi, Pop.

129
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:08,380
Where's mother?

130
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,090
In bed. It's after 8:00.

131
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:12,217
Sure, sure.

132
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,386
Mother was a one-time ballerina

133
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:18,974
who spent 5 hours a day
dancing in front of a mirror.

134
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:21,977
She took very good care
of herself, and it showed.

135
00:08:24,188 --> 00:08:27,816
In fact, I believe mother was the
most beautiful woman in the world.

136
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:29,651
How do I look?

137
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:32,696
Just wonderful, Mother,
wonderful.

138
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:36,992
Swan-like
neck, white, unblemished skin,

139
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:42,331
firm jutting breasts which had never
known the touch of a brassier.

140
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:45,125
Leo was a fortunate man,
all right.

141
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,127
What brings my baby
to Los Angeles?

142
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:49,838
Did they run you out
of San Francisco?

143
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,840
Where are you staying?

144
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:53,717
I'm down here for good.

145
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:57,971
Starting a new division
for Honest Al.

146
00:08:58,013 --> 00:09:00,182
Right now I'm staying
at the Bahia Lodge,

147
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:03,394
but I'm gonna get an apartment
as soon as I can find one.

148
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:06,104
Why don't you stay
with us, Angel pants?

149
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:08,524
I don't know, mother.

150
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:10,817
I'm used to having
my own place.

151
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:14,279
How about the servants'
quarters above the garage?

152
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:17,449
Hasn't been live-in help
for ages.

153
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,285
It would be fine for you.

154
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,538
Could have it
redecorated, I suppose.

155
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:25,916
Ok, mother.

156
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:27,918
You got yourself a tenant.

157
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,169
Good.

158
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:32,005
It's nice to have you
home again.

159
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,675
The
following week it was August,

160
00:09:35,717 --> 00:09:38,720
and with the heat came a dozen
hard-ridden repos

161
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:41,973
from Al's main lot
in San Francisco.

162
00:09:58,282 --> 00:10:00,367
Lift the phone, cool one,

163
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:02,244
and call a costume company.

164
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:03,787
Any company in particular?

165
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:07,332
One that sells Santa Claus
suits complete with beards.

166
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:08,750
What size?

167
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:12,337
The size worn by Evans,
Cartwell, and Jodi boy,

168
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,339
our 3 star salesmen.

169
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,715
You shouldn't do it, chief.

170
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:17,050
It's the middle of August.

171
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:18,332
Those guys will melt out there.

172
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,929
It's the first day of August,

173
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:22,347
and they'll wear those suits

174
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,058
every damn day 'til I tell
them to take them off!

175
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,728
What's more unusual
than Santa Claus

176
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,897
selling used cars in August?

177
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,651
You got me for the moment.

178
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:35,068
Nothing!

179
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,237
Honest Al is now Santa Claus

180
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,738
in the middle of summer

181
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,532
bringing the good people
of the City of Angels

182
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:44,703
goodies in the form
of repos, your repos.

183
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,831
Now get those suits, get
our buddy boys into them.

184
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:49,249
I want you to take out a
half page in the "Times,"

185
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,875
right some decent copy
for a change.

186
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,170
I don't want those cars
on the lot by Saturday!

187
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:55,380
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,470
Oh, and, uh,
by the way, cold one,

189
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:02,971
you will inform our
white-bearded salesmen

190
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:06,891
that the Santa Claus
suits were your idea.

191
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,397
Despite the progress of the lot,

192
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,650
I was always glad
in the evenings.

193
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:18,362
Almost every night Leo and I
would go to the movies.

194
00:11:18,403 --> 00:11:20,531
It didn't matter what we saw:

195
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:25,243
Melodramas, westerns,
slave spectaculars.

196
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,329
We were fans.

197
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:28,539
Thank you, Richard.

198
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,458
And I was glad to take Leo
as my guest.

199
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,459
This is all wrong.

200
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,294
We were a family after all.

201
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:36,171
This is wrong, too.

202
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:37,631
You got...

203
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:40,175
Didn't you learn anything
at that New Jersey school

204
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:42,720
except how to
play with yourself?

205
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:45,805
Their constant need
of encouragement and support,

206
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:51,061
especially Becky, was a burden
that I was glad to bear.

207
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:54,022
I bought this new cashmere
sweater at Bullet's today.

208
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:55,273
How does it look on me?

209
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:58,109
Blue is blue.

210
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,780
No, not the color.

211
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,533
All right, you've got breasts
beneath that sweater.

212
00:12:04,575 --> 00:12:06,910
If they're real.

213
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:08,953
You...

214
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,415
Back at work,
I just hung around,

215
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:14,292
directed improvements,

216
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,629
watching my sweltering salesmen
screwing aircraft mechanics

217
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,631
out of their cash.

218
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:25,345
So what was the problem?

219
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:28,432
Honest Al was ecstatic.

220
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:31,059
I was making money
hand over fist.

221
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:34,479
I mean, isn't the making of
money the reason for existence?

222
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,024
Isn't it?

223
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:42,070
After rolling down the driveway
that evening,

224
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:45,616
I learned that it wasn't.

225
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:47,909
No, they haven't
called me in months,

226
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:49,994
and they never will call me,

227
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,247
nor will any studio
ever call me.

228
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:55,875
My films never
made them a dime.

229
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:58,295
I'm broke, Richard.

230
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:00,464
I'm down to my last oil,

231
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:03,717
and I can go no further.

232
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,262
Well, this is an original
Ruwalt, isn't it, Pop?

233
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:08,555
Of course.

234
00:13:08,597 --> 00:13:10,808
And all I have left.

235
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:14,394
Isn't an original Ruwalt
worth about $100,000?

236
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:16,563
Worth is relative, Richard.

237
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:19,941
My painting is like
a framed $1.00 bill

238
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:22,360
businessmen hang
on their office wall,

239
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:27,532
a symbolic treatment of the first dollar
they've ever made for themselves.

240
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,119
Well, there's a hell
of a lot of difference

241
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:33,288
between a framed $1.00 bill

242
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,416
and a framed $100,000 bill.

243
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,503
But I know what you mean, Pop.

244
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:40,962
And I'm all for you.

245
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:42,589
You've got real integrity,

246
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:45,843
artistic integrity,

247
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:48,094
the only kind
that means anything.

248
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:53,099
The following day I was low.

249
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:54,267
I was down.

250
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:56,394
Christmas, goddamn it!

251
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,395
Way down.

252
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,856
Suit up!

253
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:00,649
I needed male camaraderie,

254
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:04,068
good conversation
like I never needed it before.

255
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,572
I needed the toast kings.

256
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:16,164
Next on the agenda,
the icebreaker speech.

257
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:18,958
Nicky J. Hewlitt.

258
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:22,629
Welcome.

259
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:25,423
You have one minute
to introduce yourself

260
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,300
starting now.

261
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:28,593
Thank you.

262
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:31,847
Good evening, toast kings.

263
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:34,641
The icebreaker speech.

264
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:38,186
I suppose I feel
a lot like a blender.

265
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:40,438
Ahem.

266
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,357
Uh, I work over there

267
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,651
at Van Paul Restaurant Supply.

268
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:46,611
People say I'm off
to a flying start,

269
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,363
and I suppose they're right.

270
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:49,656
I've already been promoted.

271
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:51,115
I don't want to brag,

272
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:54,661
but here I am today in charge
of sales for sector "G."

273
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:57,080
It won't be easy, I know.

274
00:14:57,121 --> 00:15:02,586
All the traveling
and long hours, paperwork,

275
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:04,546
but I'm willing to do
what I need to

276
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:06,965
to get kicked upstairs.

277
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,677
Sales. This country was founded
on salesmanship.

278
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,053
Meaningless.

279
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:14,138
Christopher Columbus was
our first great salesman,

280
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,683
convincing the queen
to let him make this voyage

281
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:18,393
and discover our great country,

282
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:21,354
and I'm happy to be continuing
in that tradition as well.

283
00:15:21,396 --> 00:15:23,022
Wasted lot.

284
00:15:23,064 --> 00:15:24,482
What a great thought that is,

285
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,570
a tradition carried down
from generation to generation.

286
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:30,447
I mean, think about it...

287
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:31,698
Time!

288
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:35,660
Atta boy, Nicky!

289
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:36,411
Ha ha!

290
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:39,831
I didn't know.

291
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:46,045
I didn't know.

292
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:48,673
Our lives were so short,

293
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:53,219
so little time for creativeness.

294
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:55,973
And yet we're wasting it...

295
00:15:56,014 --> 00:15:58,308
letting it slip
through our fingers.

296
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:00,894
Like goddamn sand!

297
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:10,361
But that was it.

298
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,073
Creativeness.

299
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,911
To create something.

300
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:23,207
One thing.

301
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,961
That was all.

302
00:16:26,003 --> 00:16:28,296
And then maybe two things.

303
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:33,176
But above all...

304
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:35,261
One thing.

305
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,807
And at that very moment,

306
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:41,852
I knew what I was going to do.

307
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:45,480
My thoughts were hazy,
and I wasn't positive

308
00:16:45,522 --> 00:16:48,274
until the day I danced
with mother.

309
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,951
You've come to dance with me.

310
00:17:00,662 --> 00:17:01,955
Come on.

311
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:17,971
All right, why not?

312
00:17:35,113 --> 00:17:37,281
Uh!

313
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:41,995
Some dancer.

314
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:48,835
The hell with it.

315
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:51,337
And so we danced, mother and me.

316
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:55,466
The longer I danced,
the better I became.

317
00:17:55,508 --> 00:18:00,388
I chased... I pursued,

318
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,600
made impossible leaps
and came down as lightly

319
00:18:03,641 --> 00:18:06,394
as a wind-wafted
cigarette paper.

320
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:10,107
I pranced...

321
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:13,401
cavorted...

322
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:15,486
darted...

323
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:19,323
turned, and glided.

324
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:23,494
And did a mad foutee
until I almost lost my reason.

325
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:28,708
At last, at long, long last,
the music swelled.

326
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:33,880
And I was done.

327
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,680
It was so beautiful.

328
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,433
So beautiful.

329
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:47,602
So beautiful.

330
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,229
So beautiful.

331
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:53,399
Oh, Leo,
don't get so emotional.

332
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,738
The next day,

333
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,074
I did not go to the lot.

334
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,122
Instead I drove
to Exposition Park

335
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:09,582
and descended
to the cool basement

336
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:12,085
of the Los Angeles Museum.

337
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:17,924
I knew the time
for fooling around was over.

338
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:21,302
The time had come
for me to create something,

339
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:25,640
one creative accomplishment that
would wipe away the useless days.

340
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:31,771
I have been a single package,
my reason for being here.

341
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:36,818
As an artist, I was limited
to what I could do.

342
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,990
Painting, sculpture, music,
architecture, writing a novel...

343
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:45,451
all of these art forms
take years of apprenticeship.

344
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:51,582
But I knew I could
write and direct a movie.

345
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:55,294
I knew it.

346
00:19:57,172 --> 00:20:00,133
I knew what movies
were all about.

347
00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:01,968
I had seen thousands.

348
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,970
And Leo would help me.

349
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:06,139
Hell, yes, I would talk to Leo.

350
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:31,372
Richard, supper's ready.

351
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:34,000
By the time
mother shouted up the stairs,

352
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:37,879
I had an entire movie
outlined in my head,

353
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:40,173
including the title.

354
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:45,220
The title first.

355
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:47,264
"The Man Who Got Away."

356
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,975
I like the title.

357
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:55,897
The title is a clue
to the whole damn movie.

358
00:20:55,939 --> 00:20:57,982
Now as far as the theme
is concerned,

359
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:02,153
the movie is about America,
Mr. Average American.

360
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:04,405
The hero is a truck driver.

361
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:07,033
His job is the dullest
imaginable.

362
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:09,493
He drives from San Francisco
to Los Angeles,

363
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:12,914
and the next day he drives back,
10 hours each way.

364
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:15,833
Worst possible existence
for anybody.

365
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,462
In the first part of the film,
his unhappiness is established.

366
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:22,257
Messy house, the screaming kids,
that kind of thing.

367
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:24,634
He's always glad to get back
to his truck.

368
00:21:24,675 --> 00:21:26,677
At least he's alone in the cab.

369
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:29,347
The next day is supposed to be
his day off.

370
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,724
After a few hours at home
in that kind of atmosphere,

371
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:35,103
he calls the dispatcher and tells
them he's changed his mind.

372
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:37,396
The guy is really worn out.

373
00:21:37,438 --> 00:21:41,567
The average moviegoer will
recognize the foreshadowing.

374
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:42,610
You know.

375
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:44,070
I know.

376
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:45,738
The rest of the picture
is now the highway,

377
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,657
atmosphere at first.

378
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:49,617
Truck stops, coffee,

379
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:53,579
the other drivers tired
and defeated men,

380
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:58,459
swampers, hitchhikers,
blowouts, vapor locks.

381
00:21:58,501 --> 00:21:59,460
Montage effect.

382
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:00,753
Not exactly.

383
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:04,715
A much slower pace,
a dull, dragging pace.

384
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:08,303
The hero's inner tension builds,
a near fistfight.

385
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:10,596
His disposition gets surlier.

386
00:22:10,638 --> 00:22:12,640
He buys a pint,
takes a few drinks.

387
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:14,517
This would really tip off
the audience,

388
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:16,102
get 'em interested
in what comes next,

389
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:17,561
and then it happened.

390
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,272
He's wheeling down the road
like an automaton.

391
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:21,607
A child darts out onto the
freeway in front of his truck,

392
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:23,818
a little girl
out picking wildflowers.

393
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,403
That's touching as hell.

394
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,322
And she has her dog with her,
a puppy.

395
00:22:27,364 --> 00:22:28,614
Bang!

396
00:22:28,656 --> 00:22:30,325
He runs over the little girl,
squashes her flat.

397
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:31,993
Scene couldn't be sadder
than a son of a bitch.

398
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:34,829
Ok, now, here he was, a nobody.

399
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:37,165
Now all of a sudden he's the most
important man in California.

400
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:39,792
Everybody in the state's
interested in him.

401
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:40,918
He's done something!

402
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,295
Roadblocks are erected.

403
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:43,880
He plows right through them.

404
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:45,840
He has this enormous monster
of a semi

405
00:22:45,882 --> 00:22:47,217
and nothing can stop him.

406
00:22:47,258 --> 00:22:49,260
A highway patrol car
gets after him.

407
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:51,137
He forces it off the road.
The two patrolmen are killed.

408
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,306
Now they're really after him!

409
00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:56,851
The entire highway is cleared
all the way to Los Angeles.

410
00:22:56,893 --> 00:22:59,896
He's all alone on Highway 101.

411
00:22:59,937 --> 00:23:02,940
A good place to work in
some symbolism

412
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:05,151
a man against the world.

413
00:23:05,193 --> 00:23:08,321
But down in Santa Barbara they are
getting ready for the poor bastard.

414
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:10,531
The people are working like mad
at the junkyard,

415
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:13,034
pulling old wrecks out and
piling them up on the highway

416
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:14,411
to make a king-size roadblock.

417
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:16,079
Will they have it ready in time?

418
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,581
Back and forth our camera pans,

419
00:23:18,622 --> 00:23:20,291
the driver's white
and frightened face,

420
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,834
the frenzied workers,

421
00:23:21,876 --> 00:23:24,754
the police are lined up
with rifles and machine guns.

422
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:28,716
Here he comes barreling
down the highway to his doom.

423
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:31,428
The idea of deserting his truck
never occurs to him.

424
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:34,055
The truck is his real home.

425
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:36,724
He only knows
he has to keep driving,

426
00:23:36,766 --> 00:23:38,642
and there's the roadblock
ahead of him,

427
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:42,480
hundreds of cars piled up
across the 4-lane highway

428
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,441
and a steep wall on each side.

429
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:46,734
He can't go around it
or under it,

430
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:48,403
so he crashes right into it.

431
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:51,406
His truck flips over
and catches fire.

432
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:53,741
He catches on fire.
He's burning.

433
00:23:53,783 --> 00:23:56,619
He stumbles blindly
from the cab, a human torch.

434
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,913
There's one good Samaritan
in the crowd,

435
00:23:58,955 --> 00:24:01,665
and he rushes over to the hero
to throw a blanket over him

436
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,251
to put the fire out,

437
00:24:03,293 --> 00:24:06,254
but the vicious crowd
turns savagely on the Samaritan

438
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:07,922
and knock hell out of him.

439
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:11,092
The police empty their pistols,
rifles, and machine guns

440
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:14,887
into the burning body
of the truck driver.

441
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:16,847
It's all over.

442
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:23,062
The final scene, the poor guy
who tried to help the driver

443
00:24:23,104 --> 00:24:24,688
gets to his feet.

444
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,275
His mouth is bleeding
where someone hit him.

445
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:29,652
He's kind of dazed.

446
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:33,239
He asks a policeman,
"Why did everyone turn on me?

447
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:36,200
What did I do wrong anyway?"

448
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:39,120
The policeman is very serious.

449
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:42,623
"You tried to help him,
that's what."

450
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,963
Well?

451
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:51,632
That's the end, Pop.

452
00:24:51,674 --> 00:24:53,343
That's the end?

453
00:24:53,384 --> 00:24:55,303
That's the end.

454
00:24:57,472 --> 00:24:59,890
Well, will it
make a movie, Pop?

455
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:06,481
Yes, Richard,
it would make a movie.

456
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:08,607
But how much would it
cost, rock bottom?

457
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:10,401
You're gonna write
the scenario?

458
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:11,444
Yes, and direct it.

459
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:12,445
I want you to produce it, Leo.

460
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:13,446
You're the producer.

461
00:25:13,488 --> 00:25:14,947
You handle all the dough,

462
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:17,158
the details, the paperwork.

463
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,496
Be your chance to get
back on top again, Pop.

464
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:23,039
Let me sleep on it, Richard,

465
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,708
do some figuring with a pencil.

466
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:28,294
We'll talk some more
in the morning, all right?

467
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:31,005
I had him hooked,

468
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:32,840
and I knew it.

469
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:34,592
I knew it.

470
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:43,809
Yes, Richard,
it would make a movie.

471
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,655
We don't need the light, do we?

472
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:59,950
All right, Becky,
the joke's over.

473
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:00,993
You better get into your things

474
00:26:01,035 --> 00:26:02,161
and run back in the house

475
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:03,704
before Leo finds out.

476
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:06,165
Oh, no, you don't. Ah!

477
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:08,792
I have waited
a long time for this chance,

478
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,711
and I'm never gonna get up
the nerve to do it again,

479
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:12,796
so you've got to go
through with it, Richard,

480
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,924
you've just got to.

481
00:26:14,965 --> 00:26:17,093
For weeks
Becky had been asking me

482
00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:19,554
about boys.

483
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:21,389
And I had taken the time
to explain

484
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:24,392
the many contraceptive devices
and venereal diseases

485
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:27,228
she would be likely
to encounter.

486
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:31,357
Go ahead and look.
I don't care.

487
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,943
I want you to see
for yourself they're real.

488
00:26:33,984 --> 00:26:36,695
I knew how deceptive
teenage males could be,

489
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:39,574
and I didn't want Becky
romanticizing them,

490
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:42,993
but now she was
romanticizing me.

491
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:45,413
You're going to
make love to me,

492
00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:48,165
and I'm not leaving here
until you do.

493
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:51,252
What if I don't want to?

494
00:26:51,294 --> 00:26:53,712
Oh, you want to.

495
00:26:53,754 --> 00:26:55,214
I know.

496
00:27:01,178 --> 00:27:02,513
All right, you win.

497
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:05,182
Let me just get up and
smoke a cigarette first.

498
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,268
I'll get the cigarette.

499
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:11,606
I didn't want Becky involved with
some immature tattooed youth

500
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:14,400
who would work the word "love"
into his pitch.

501
00:27:14,442 --> 00:27:17,612
That would be unnecessarily
emotional for her.

502
00:27:17,654 --> 00:27:21,031
Never mind the damn cigarette.

503
00:27:25,662 --> 00:27:27,204
If I continue in this vein,

504
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:30,874
how will I be able to establish
a strong viewer identification?

505
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:34,044
The average moviegoer has
a tendency to identify himself

506
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,296
with the lead character,

507
00:27:35,338 --> 00:27:37,423
to project himself
into the story

508
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:39,467
and actually live the story

509
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:41,469
with the thoughts, emotions,
and actions

510
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:43,346
of the lead character.

511
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:45,264
Poor viewer.

512
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:46,599
You better get into your things

513
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:48,851
and hustle back to the house

514
00:27:48,892 --> 00:27:50,311
before Leo wakes up.

515
00:28:08,037 --> 00:28:11,541
Thanks for the party, Kid.

516
00:28:11,582 --> 00:28:14,001
Any night you feel
like you want it,

517
00:28:14,043 --> 00:28:16,170
come on over.

518
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:23,802
Becky never came back,

519
00:28:23,844 --> 00:28:27,682
but then
I never expected her back.

520
00:28:27,724 --> 00:28:29,433
We were still friends of course.

521
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:32,395
I had solved her problem,
and she had solved mine

522
00:28:32,436 --> 00:28:34,355
at the time.

523
00:28:34,397 --> 00:28:37,567
And I saved the girl from any
emotional and physical involvement

524
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:42,821
with another male of any age
for a long, long time.

525
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:57,670
Jesus, Pop, did you
stay up all night?

526
00:28:57,712 --> 00:29:01,048
Sit down, Richard.

527
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,509
This is rough as hell.

528
00:29:07,137 --> 00:29:08,431
It's a lot to you and me,

529
00:29:08,472 --> 00:29:11,434
but practically nothing
to a studio.

530
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:15,354
Look at the salary
for the principals.

531
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:17,022
No actor would work for that.

532
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:18,691
That's where you're wrong, Pop.

533
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:20,943
For one thing,
we're after nobodies.

534
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:22,903
Secondly, it's a good story.

535
00:29:22,945 --> 00:29:24,614
It could make the right man.

536
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:26,156
This is much too low.

537
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:30,911
The music alone could run
as high as $25,000.

538
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:32,663
I'll just hire some son
of a bitch with a guitar

539
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,331
for 50 bucks a day.

540
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:36,375
It's a solution maybe.

541
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,838
Pop, if your budget
is anywhere near accurate,

542
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,089
we can do it.

543
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:43,674
I can dig up 50 grand in cash,

544
00:29:43,716 --> 00:29:46,552
40 of it in Honest Al's dough.

545
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:47,678
As long as he gets
his checks every month,

546
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,680
he won't investigate
what I'm doing

547
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,056
with his working capital.

548
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:54,893
And right up there, Leo...

549
00:29:57,605 --> 00:30:01,233
is a clown worth 50,000
in cash at least.

550
00:30:01,275 --> 00:30:02,943
My clown?

551
00:30:02,985 --> 00:30:04,153
Your clown.

552
00:30:04,194 --> 00:30:05,863
What the hell, Leo,
you'll get it back.

553
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,073
With close to 50,000
in a story,

554
00:30:08,115 --> 00:30:09,742
you can talk to
the man at Mammoth.

555
00:30:09,784 --> 00:30:11,160
He still remembers you.

556
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:12,536
All you have to do is

557
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:13,996
talk him into putting up
the rest of the dough

558
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:16,123
and loaning us
some contract people

559
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:18,542
he's paying anyway.

560
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,544
That's all I have to do?

561
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:21,962
That's all.

562
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:23,631
I've got to see
the script, Richard.

563
00:30:23,673 --> 00:30:25,132
Never mind the script.
I'll write the script.

564
00:30:25,174 --> 00:30:26,550
Can we do it?

565
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:30,888
We can do it.

566
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,098
Call the man.

567
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,100
The man should
really call me first.

568
00:30:35,142 --> 00:30:36,101
I know that, Leo.

569
00:30:36,143 --> 00:30:37,645
He doesn't know
we have a story.

570
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:38,855
It's crazy.

571
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:40,857
I know.

572
00:30:40,898 --> 00:30:43,150
Give me the phone.

573
00:30:44,735 --> 00:30:47,196
"The Man Who Got Away."

574
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:49,532
Synopsis by Richard Hudson

575
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:53,243
from an original idea
by Richard Hudson.

576
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:57,623
A truck driver driving from
San Francisco to Los Angeles

577
00:30:57,665 --> 00:31:00,334
runs over and kills a child.

578
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:02,670
He tries to get away.

579
00:31:02,712 --> 00:31:04,630
He doesn't.

580
00:31:12,513 --> 00:31:17,184
Steinberg. 4:00 appointment
with the man.

581
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,188
Sell it, Pop.

582
00:31:24,024 --> 00:31:25,818
For the next two hours

583
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,530
I sat in a Chinese restaurant
two blocks away from Mammoth

584
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:33,367
drinking hot tea
and nursing self-doubts.

585
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:35,828
More tea, sir?

586
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:46,129
If by chance we were in,
my real troubles would begin.

587
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:50,801
I was jettisoning everything I'd
worked for during my last 10 years:

588
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:54,889
A good job, Honest Al's trust,

589
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:57,307
most of his dough, too.

590
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,394
If the movie bombed
and I couldn't recoup its cost,

591
00:32:00,436 --> 00:32:04,648
I would not only risk being
blackballed in the used car business,

592
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,067
I might end up in jail.

593
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:08,485
We're in!

594
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,654
The man bought all of it:

595
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:13,783
You to write and direct,
me to produce.

596
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,660
Mammoth will put up facilities
and staff in lieu of cash

597
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:19,121
which is even better
than I expected.

598
00:32:19,162 --> 00:32:22,291
It was such a low-budget,
he didn't think twice.

599
00:32:22,332 --> 00:32:24,794
We've been assigned
a bungalow, Richard.

600
00:32:24,835 --> 00:32:27,254
We start working tomorrow.

601
00:32:27,296 --> 00:32:30,883
Ha ha!

602
00:32:34,136 --> 00:32:35,888
Except for the single

603
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,182
highly unsatisfactory
episode with Becky,

604
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:42,144
there had been little time
in my schedule for women,

605
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:46,064
and once I became involved
in full-scale work on my movie,

606
00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:48,358
there would be even less time.

607
00:32:50,444 --> 00:32:52,488
What? What's the matter?

608
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:55,365
You're supposed to be
helping me work on the script.

609
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:56,659
Don't!

610
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,369
You promised not to
make me feel guilty.

611
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,039
Ok, ok.

612
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,293
You know something, Laura?

613
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:08,796
You seem a little too
intelligent, well educated

614
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:10,714
to be a writer's secretary.

615
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:11,966
A degree from Stanford?

616
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:13,968
Seems you could do better.

617
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,678
It's a start, Mr. Hudson.

618
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,346
Richard.

619
00:33:17,387 --> 00:33:18,597
Richard.

620
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:20,975
I hope to be
a writer someday, too.

621
00:33:21,017 --> 00:33:23,477
I've done a few things
already at college,

622
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,228
and a job at the studio,

623
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,732
any kind of job, seemed
like a good place to begin.

624
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:32,486
And I can learn so much
from writers like you.

625
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,788
I had to laugh at myself.

626
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,709
When a man starts doing
weird stuff like that,

627
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,461
he needs a woman
in the worst way.

628
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:03,851
Aah!

629
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:18,949
Green 33, green 33, hut, hut!

630
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:24,538
Ah!

631
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,456
Uh!

632
00:34:32,088 --> 00:34:34,048
Could you eat a horse, Laura?

633
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,884
No, but I could eat
a small Shetland pony.

634
00:34:36,926 --> 00:34:39,469
Let's drive to the
hangover house instead,

635
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:40,763
settle for a prime sirloin.

636
00:34:40,804 --> 00:34:42,514
Oh, that would be wonderful.

637
00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:44,516
Oh, but my hair looks terrible.

638
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:46,476
The steak won't mind.

639
00:34:50,898 --> 00:34:54,777
I'm really anxious
to start work on your script.

640
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:57,029
I read the synopsis you wrote.

641
00:34:57,071 --> 00:35:00,532
And there seems to be
so much leeway.

642
00:35:00,574 --> 00:35:03,827
I mean, it's a really
good story and all, I suppose,

643
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:08,082
but there seems to be
a million possibilities.

644
00:35:08,124 --> 00:35:11,418
It seems that way to me,
I mean.

645
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,671
I don't work like
other writers.

646
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,339
Two more scotch and sodas.

647
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:08,391
Just a minute, Richard.

648
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:11,478
Before you get started,
I better explain the rules.

649
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,938
Yeah.

650
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,482
Number one, you can kiss
me, but not too wet.

651
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:17,400
I don't like it.

652
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:21,197
Two, you can fondle
my breasts, but that's it.

653
00:36:21,238 --> 00:36:23,199
When you're ready,
just tell me,

654
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,409
and I'll... I'll relieve you.

655
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:27,494
You'll what?

656
00:36:27,536 --> 00:36:33,416
I'll relieve you.
You know what I mean.

657
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,795
I'm a virgin, Richard,
whether you believe it or not,

658
00:36:36,837 --> 00:36:39,464
and I intend to stay that way.

659
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:43,802
So you're one of those
fellatio experts.

660
00:36:43,844 --> 00:36:46,930
What's that?

661
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:49,808
Don't worry about it, Laura.

662
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,393
Well, I don't understand.

663
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:53,854
I've never had any objections

664
00:36:53,896 --> 00:36:55,647
from anybody before.

665
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:58,483
I'm not one of your schoolboy
dates, that's all.

666
00:37:06,575 --> 00:37:08,451
Good night, Laura.

667
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,704
Don't you want
to kiss me good night?

668
00:37:10,746 --> 00:37:13,290
Thanks. I kiss too wetly.

669
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,888
After a lukewarm shower,

670
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,515
I changed into my pajamas.

671
00:37:30,557 --> 00:37:34,728
Bored, I picked out a copy of "T.S.
Eliot's Collected Poetry"

672
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,522
and idly flipped the pages.

673
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,362
"And I who will inherit a son

674
00:37:44,404 --> 00:37:46,865
"will proffer my deeds
to oblivion,

675
00:37:46,907 --> 00:37:49,743
"my love to the posterity
of the desert,

676
00:37:49,785 --> 00:37:52,370
the fruit of the gourd."

677
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,559
"Because I do not hope to turn,
because I do not hope.

678
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:19,231
"Desire in this man's gift
and that man's scope,

679
00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:23,319
"I no longer strive
to strive towards such things.

680
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,905
Why should the aged eagle
stretch its wings?"

681
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:53,890
The combination of
music and poetry

682
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:57,353
had unlocked a hidden spring.

683
00:38:57,394 --> 00:39:01,273
To what can equal the tragedy
of a strong man's tears?

684
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:09,323
Bitter.

685
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,702
Stick to the story,
stick to the story.

686
00:39:13,743 --> 00:39:17,580
The movie is 90 minutes long,
6 short reels in time.

687
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:20,917
An insane rule, I know,
but there it is.

688
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,669
This is bungalow 19.

689
00:39:22,711 --> 00:39:25,881
Mr. Hudson, welcome to Mammoth.

690
00:39:25,922 --> 00:39:27,799
The studio assigned me
a secretary,

691
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:29,801
a Miss Laura Harmon.

692
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:33,055
Yes, sir, a very
competent woman.

693
00:39:33,096 --> 00:39:34,806
I agree. For typing maybe.

694
00:39:34,848 --> 00:39:37,600
But I don't think she's quite
ready to work with a writer.

695
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:40,979
I'm sending her back, but I
recommend her for the typing pool.

696
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:43,315
I don't understand...

697
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:48,111
Desperate
to complete the scenario,

698
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:53,033
I holed up with a Dictaphone
in a downtown suite.

699
00:39:53,075 --> 00:39:55,160
I was already
a week behind schedule

700
00:39:55,202 --> 00:39:58,705
and was determined to
free myself of all distractions,

701
00:39:58,747 --> 00:40:00,623
female or otherwise.

702
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,826
Hudson, over Dictaphone:
The camera catches the hero...

703
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:06,004
Come in.

704
00:40:06,046 --> 00:40:07,381
It's me.

705
00:40:07,423 --> 00:40:09,632
How did you find me, Bill?

706
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,176
Your mother told me
where you were.

707
00:40:11,218 --> 00:40:12,886
You must have really
snowed her to find out.

708
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:14,596
I told her not to tell anybody.

709
00:40:14,637 --> 00:40:17,307
I did, but it's important or I
wouldn't have bothered you.

710
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,684
What I'm doing
is more important.

711
00:40:19,726 --> 00:40:21,728
What are doing anyway?

712
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,521
I haven't seen you
in over a week.

713
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:24,981
The damn cars aren't moving,

714
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,192
the salesmen won't wear
their Santa Claus suits.

715
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:29,361
Call Fred McCullers
in Pasadena.

716
00:40:29,403 --> 00:40:30,612
He's a jobber.

717
00:40:30,653 --> 00:40:32,406
You tell him that
you're working for me

718
00:40:32,448 --> 00:40:33,907
and that I need
some creampuffs.

719
00:40:33,949 --> 00:40:35,158
He won't cheat you.

720
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,911
He owes me a couple of favors.

721
00:40:37,953 --> 00:40:39,329
Get out on the lot
yourself Bill.

722
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:40,830
I know it's hot,

723
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,673
but if you're out there
watching the salesmen,

724
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,084
they'll produce,
and if they don't,

725
00:40:44,126 --> 00:40:46,002
fire them, hire others.

726
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,755
But the Santa Claus suits
will be worn.

727
00:40:48,797 --> 00:40:51,925
Next, take out a full-page
ad in the "Times"

728
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:53,927
and list
new rock-bottom prices.

729
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:57,764
Cut down to exactly
100 bucks profit on every car.

730
00:40:57,806 --> 00:41:00,350
At that price, all you have to
do is get good credit risks.

731
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:03,812
The sellin' will
take care of itself.

732
00:41:03,853 --> 00:41:04,813
Feel better?

733
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:07,274
A whole lot better.

734
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:08,942
How much dough's in the bank?

735
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:10,902
About 44,000.

736
00:41:10,944 --> 00:41:12,821
Withdraw a certified check

737
00:41:12,862 --> 00:41:14,323
made out to me for 40,000

738
00:41:14,364 --> 00:41:16,074
and bring it to me here.

739
00:41:16,116 --> 00:41:17,784
That's a lot of money, Richard.

740
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:19,577
Sure it is.

741
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:21,330
You'll be short on capital,

742
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:23,373
but hold up on payment
of your deliveries

743
00:41:23,415 --> 00:41:25,959
from McCuller's
for a couple of weeks.

744
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:27,210
And write in your next report

745
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:29,004
as to how that
we needed the cash

746
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:31,298
to buy new stock from the lot

747
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,757
that's closing down
in San Diego.

748
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:34,759
But what if Honest Al calls
and asks me about it?

749
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:36,886
Think of a gimmick,
for Christ sake.

750
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:39,889
You've got to do something
for your 400 a month.

751
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,183
If you're really stuck,

752
00:41:41,224 --> 00:41:43,018
get a high school
mathematics teacher

753
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:45,562
to juggle your figures for you.

754
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,105
For a hundred dollar bill,

755
00:41:47,147 --> 00:41:49,774
a math teacher
will do anything.

756
00:41:49,816 --> 00:41:50,900
Ok, Richard.

757
00:41:53,445 --> 00:41:56,739
I'm not on any secret
project, Bill.

758
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,658
I'm writing a movie.

759
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,704
When I get it written,
I'm gonna direct it.

760
00:42:02,745 --> 00:42:05,457
Ha ha! I'll be goddamned.

761
00:42:05,499 --> 00:42:07,501
I'm out of my field, all right.

762
00:42:07,543 --> 00:42:09,252
I've got this story in my mind,

763
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:11,004
the characters and everything.

764
00:42:11,046 --> 00:42:13,215
But I've been in
this room for two days,

765
00:42:13,256 --> 00:42:16,968
and I haven't written
a single word.

766
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,763
Not a word.

767
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,850
Have you ever been
in that situation?

768
00:42:23,892 --> 00:42:26,769
I don't even have a conception
of what you're doing.

769
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,564
I wouldn't know
where to begin either.

770
00:42:28,605 --> 00:42:31,274
But I know this much
about writing.

771
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:34,319
You have to write
something, anything.

772
00:42:34,361 --> 00:42:35,778
When a captain of
infantry tells you

773
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,365
he wants to boot a man out of
the service, for instance,

774
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:40,783
the first sergeant
has to do the paperwork,

775
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:43,286
and the writing has to
be effective, Richard,

776
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:45,872
because the captain
wants the guy the hell out.

777
00:42:45,914 --> 00:42:47,332
It's hard work.

778
00:42:47,374 --> 00:42:49,834
The first board I wrote
almost drove me crazy,

779
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:51,711
but the guy was bounced
out of the service,

780
00:42:51,753 --> 00:42:53,671
and I didn't have
a damn thing to go on

781
00:42:53,713 --> 00:42:57,259
except that the captain
didn't like the man!

782
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,845
What's the secret, Bill?

783
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:01,846
Rewrite.

784
00:43:01,888 --> 00:43:03,723
First one word at a time.

785
00:43:03,765 --> 00:43:05,601
When you get enough pages done,

786
00:43:05,642 --> 00:43:08,019
you have something
you can read.

787
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:10,606
If you can read it,
you can revise it.

788
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:12,274
If you can revise it,

789
00:43:12,315 --> 00:43:14,443
then you'll come up
with something pretty good.

790
00:43:14,484 --> 00:43:15,985
All writing is like that.

791
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:18,196
Couldn't be any other way.

792
00:43:18,238 --> 00:43:19,697
I'd better be going.

793
00:43:23,577 --> 00:43:29,165
Ok, get me that check before
you do anything else, Bill.

794
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,751
Keep things going
down on the lot for me.

795
00:43:31,793 --> 00:43:33,545
I don't know how you got
into this movie business,

796
00:43:33,587 --> 00:43:36,673
but if anyone can come
out on top, you can.

797
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,550
Thanks, Bill.

798
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:47,850
The next 10 hours

799
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,770
were the most gratifying hours
and the hardest hours

800
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:54,232
I ever worked.

801
00:43:54,274 --> 00:43:57,110
And I was proud of the people
I created on paper.

802
00:43:57,152 --> 00:43:59,488
They were composites
of every buyer

803
00:43:59,529 --> 00:44:04,075
who had bought used cars from me
during the last 10 years.

804
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:05,910
I had them.

805
00:44:09,665 --> 00:44:11,833
Damn it, Leo, he could read
the script in a half-hour.

806
00:44:11,874 --> 00:44:14,252
He's kept us sweating
blood for 3 days.

807
00:44:14,294 --> 00:44:15,712
Take it easy, son.

808
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,673
He may have a few suggestions,

809
00:44:17,714 --> 00:44:20,758
but I don't think
he'll turn it down.

810
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,428
The script is good, isn't it?

811
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,972
I'm not worried.
He'll be crazy about it.

812
00:44:26,014 --> 00:44:29,601
You really think
he'll like it? I do.

813
00:44:29,643 --> 00:44:32,145
I hope so, Richard.

814
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:36,399
I hawked my clown this morning.

815
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,819
Darling?

816
00:44:39,861 --> 00:44:41,279
Hello?

817
00:44:41,321 --> 00:44:42,905
Richard, darling, I've got
to see you right away.

818
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:44,616
Get the hell off the line
and don't call again.

819
00:44:44,658 --> 00:44:46,159
I'm expecting
an important call.

820
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:47,952
Please don't hang up.

821
00:44:47,994 --> 00:44:49,412
Who was it, Richard?

822
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:51,414
Laura Harmon, that
sex-crazed secretary

823
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:53,124
I told you about.

824
00:44:54,876 --> 00:44:56,002
Get rid of her.

825
00:44:56,044 --> 00:45:00,173
Yes, this is Mr. Steinberg.

826
00:45:01,383 --> 00:45:03,677
Yes, sir.

827
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:05,387
Yes, sir.

828
00:45:05,428 --> 00:45:07,972
Yes, sir.

829
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:12,519
The man wants to
see us, Richard.

830
00:45:14,062 --> 00:45:15,855
Both of us.

831
00:45:20,694 --> 00:45:24,030
I'd rather you didn't smoke.

832
00:45:31,204 --> 00:45:33,206
Did you hear the story
about the director

833
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:36,626
who took a vacation in Miami?

834
00:45:36,668 --> 00:45:38,461
No, sir, we haven't.

835
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:40,880
I believe it goes
something like this.

836
00:45:40,922 --> 00:45:44,760
The director flew to Florida
one day ahead of his wife.

837
00:45:44,801 --> 00:45:47,721
Checked into this year's hotel.

838
00:45:47,763 --> 00:45:50,724
After being shown to his suite
by the bellboy,

839
00:45:50,766 --> 00:45:55,103
he asked the bellboy to send up
a little entertainment.

840
00:45:55,144 --> 00:46:00,483
5 minutes later,
a beautiful blonde arrived.

841
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:04,571
He asked her, "How much?"

842
00:46:04,613 --> 00:46:07,449
Her price was $100,

843
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,952
and the director was indignant.

844
00:46:10,993 --> 00:46:17,917
"$100? I've never paid
more than $10 in my life."

845
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:21,129
And with this
dismissed the blonde.

846
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:25,801
The next day his wife arrived
and they went down to the beach.

847
00:46:25,842 --> 00:46:30,388
Pretty soon the beautiful
blonde whore walked by.

848
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:34,768
She stops,
looked at the director,

849
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:37,854
looked at his wife, and said,

850
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,440
"See what you get for $10?"

851
00:46:40,482 --> 00:46:42,525
Ha ha!

852
00:46:44,026 --> 00:46:46,780
Ha ha!

853
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,204
Oh, ho, that was good.

854
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:57,624
"See what you get for $10?"

855
00:46:57,666 --> 00:47:00,209
I'll have to remember that one.

856
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:01,878
What about the script?

857
00:47:13,055 --> 00:47:17,477
I liked it, Hudson.

858
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:20,062
Stop by the comptroller's office
when you leave, Leo.

859
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:22,899
He has the budget
for your production.

860
00:47:27,195 --> 00:47:32,575
3 weeks.
That's all the time you get...

861
00:47:34,577 --> 00:47:37,079
Mr. Director.

862
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:41,167
I needed a truck driver,

863
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:42,669
and he had to be perfect...

864
00:47:42,711 --> 00:47:44,337
defeated, cynical.

865
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:47,590
The whole picture
would fall flat.

866
00:47:47,632 --> 00:47:49,551
I couldn't quite picture him
in my mind

867
00:47:49,592 --> 00:47:51,887
except for
a bitterly twisted mouth.

868
00:47:51,928 --> 00:47:54,848
The rest of his face
was a complete blank.

869
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,810
My new assistant director Milo
knew of just such a mouth.

870
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:06,609
Where the hell are we
supposed to find him?

871
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:09,738
The guy at the theater
said he rides a horse.

872
00:48:09,779 --> 00:48:11,781
Just have to split up and look.

873
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:21,082
6 years ago
Milo had seen Chet Wilson

874
00:48:21,123 --> 00:48:28,339
act in some medieval play
about witches and mountains.

875
00:48:28,381 --> 00:48:32,218
If Wilson was watering
orange trees for a living

876
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,848
and he still had the acting
ability Milo described,

877
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:40,476
he'd have a bitterly twisted
mouth, all right.

878
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:45,899
Hey, Wilson!

879
00:48:45,941 --> 00:48:49,026
Over here!
I want to talk to you!

880
00:48:57,744 --> 00:48:59,621
You're Chet Wilson, aren't you?

881
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:05,418
I'm Richard Hudson
from the studios.

882
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,336
I want you to read for me.

883
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:27,774
Shall I compare thee
to a fucking turd?

884
00:49:30,276 --> 00:49:33,822
Thou art more simple
and more desperate.

885
00:49:36,282 --> 00:49:40,787
Rough winds do shape
the darling stools of maids.

886
00:49:42,497 --> 00:49:46,167
And diet's peace
has far too long a path...

887
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:48,085
His evil parody

888
00:49:48,127 --> 00:49:51,464
made the notion of love
and tenderness obscene.

889
00:49:51,506 --> 00:49:52,924
I push...

890
00:49:52,966 --> 00:49:54,926
It was a real discovery.

891
00:49:54,968 --> 00:49:59,597
Stomach's changing course
untrimmed.

892
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:01,516
Climb down off your high horse.

893
00:50:01,557 --> 00:50:04,143
I want to see how tall you
are out of the saddle.

894
00:50:04,185 --> 00:50:05,561
You want to hear anything else?

895
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:07,647
No, you'll do.

896
00:50:07,689 --> 00:50:10,066
I've got a part for you.

897
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,234
What part?

898
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:14,988
I've been thinking about
giving up acting altogether.

899
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:16,865
Think again, then.

900
00:50:16,906 --> 00:50:17,987
You've got the starring role

901
00:50:17,991 --> 00:50:19,742
in "The Man Who Got Away,"

902
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:22,286
a Mammoth production.

903
00:50:22,328 --> 00:50:24,205
A movie?

904
00:50:24,246 --> 00:50:25,915
That's right.

905
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,391
And just who in the hell
are you anyway?

906
00:50:43,432 --> 00:50:45,434
The writer and director,

907
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:46,936
and you're the lead.

908
00:50:48,897 --> 00:50:51,440
Come on, I've got
the contract in the car.

909
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,868
A director
is not an electrician.

910
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,620
An electrician can pin
his job down exactly.

911
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:07,040
He furnishes light
where it is required.

912
00:51:07,082 --> 00:51:12,128
He knows exactly
what he's doing.

913
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:16,091
I was working in the abstract
with nonobjective viewpoints

914
00:51:16,132 --> 00:51:20,344
toward a certain objective
that was a nebulous idea.

915
00:51:25,767 --> 00:51:27,018
Once in
a while I would catch myself

916
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,228
thinking about the difference,

917
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,856
and then it would take
great mental effort on my part

918
00:51:31,898 --> 00:51:35,192
to force such thoughts
out of my mind.

919
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:53,544
What bothered me, though,
was the sense of unreality

920
00:51:53,586 --> 00:51:56,047
in what I was doing.

921
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:21,948
I felt as though
I was an unreal person

922
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:26,702
creating a reality
that might become unreal

923
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:32,125
if I didn't keep my eyes open
every single second.

924
00:52:49,017 --> 00:52:52,561
But unreality or not,
I had a schedule to go by.

925
00:52:59,485 --> 00:53:02,279
The schedule was my lifeline
to reality.

926
00:53:02,321 --> 00:53:05,700
All in all, I think I did
a pretty fair job of hanging on,

927
00:53:07,743 --> 00:53:11,664
especially on one tricky scene
involving Mildred Chance,

928
00:53:11,706 --> 00:53:13,332
a real American housewife

929
00:53:13,374 --> 00:53:15,334
I'd discovered
in the meat section

930
00:53:15,376 --> 00:53:18,171
of Dale's Market
on Van Nuys Boulevard.

931
00:53:18,213 --> 00:53:19,338
Action.

932
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,941
The scene depicted
the truck driver hero

933
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:23,134
and his wife attempting
to make love to each other

934
00:53:23,176 --> 00:53:26,303
before he left on his final run
to Los Angeles.

935
00:53:26,345 --> 00:53:29,598
Sure do wish you could make
the run with me tomorrow.

936
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,061
The love between them
had disappeared years before,

937
00:53:33,102 --> 00:53:35,312
and the futile attempts
to find it had to be shown

938
00:53:35,354 --> 00:53:40,401
to establish the pathos
and futility of their lives.

939
00:53:40,442 --> 00:53:42,611
The children wear me out, Dear.

940
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:44,072
Cut!

941
00:53:44,113 --> 00:53:45,447
Because of her lack of talent,

942
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:48,367
Mrs. Chance became bored... Cut!

943
00:53:48,409 --> 00:53:49,577
Tired! Cut!

944
00:53:49,618 --> 00:53:51,246
Disgusted. Cut!

945
00:53:51,287 --> 00:53:54,082
And developed a passionate
hatred for Chet Wilson

946
00:53:54,123 --> 00:53:59,336
because he was so good,
which was exactly what I wanted.

947
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:03,507
Except for this
one tender moment.

948
00:54:06,052 --> 00:54:07,053
Come away.

949
00:54:12,058 --> 00:54:14,518
Oh, the talents of God.

950
00:54:17,188 --> 00:54:18,355
Do it for me again.

951
00:54:18,397 --> 00:54:21,358
Those children wear me out.

952
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,359
Good!

953
00:54:22,401 --> 00:54:23,694
Try it with the sentence.

954
00:54:23,736 --> 00:54:25,696
The children wear me out.

955
00:54:25,738 --> 00:54:27,698
Empathize with Chet,

956
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,284
couldn't you for his sake?

957
00:54:29,325 --> 00:54:31,493
The children wear me out.

958
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:33,079
Try again. That's
your best yet.

959
00:54:33,121 --> 00:54:35,664
The children wear...

960
00:54:48,677 --> 00:54:51,097
Excuse me. And action.

961
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:55,601
It isn't hard to be a director,

962
00:54:55,643 --> 00:54:57,103
not at all.

963
00:54:57,145 --> 00:55:00,397
Come on, baby. Come to Chet.

964
00:55:05,486 --> 00:55:06,654
Whassup?

965
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:15,412
Why is everyone so hard on me?

966
00:55:15,454 --> 00:55:18,666
What did I do wrong anyway?

967
00:55:18,707 --> 00:55:22,419
You tried to help
him, that's why.

968
00:55:29,885 --> 00:55:32,221
How in the hell did you
ever get the reaction

969
00:55:32,263 --> 00:55:35,016
on the faces of that mob
during the crash scene?

970
00:55:36,558 --> 00:55:38,394
Have you ever heard of Zelda?

971
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:41,272
She's a stripper from
the Trinidad Club.

972
00:55:41,314 --> 00:55:42,231
We told the extras
there would be

973
00:55:42,273 --> 00:55:43,732
a slight delay in shooting

974
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:45,442
and that we would provide
them some entertainment

975
00:55:45,484 --> 00:55:47,528
in the interim.

976
00:55:49,322 --> 00:55:51,157
She did her disrobement act

977
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:54,327
on the piled-up wrecks,
and as the crowd watched,

978
00:55:54,369 --> 00:55:56,412
we filmed their faces.

979
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:57,997
I got to hand it
to you, Richard,

980
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:00,291
every face held
a different reaction.

981
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:03,169
Actually their faces would
probably look the same way

982
00:56:03,211 --> 00:56:05,629
if they were really
watching a body on fire.

983
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:09,342
I know the saying is old,
but it still holds true:

984
00:56:09,384 --> 00:56:11,802
Movies are made
on the cutting room floor.

985
00:56:11,844 --> 00:56:13,095
I know, I know.

986
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:14,513
Anyone want to see it again?

987
00:56:14,555 --> 00:56:15,723
I do!

988
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:17,141
I had the movie shown

989
00:56:17,183 --> 00:56:18,809
3 more times in its entirety.

990
00:56:18,851 --> 00:56:21,729
By the second run,
the film no longer excited me.

991
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:25,358
By the third I managed to get my
impersonal detachment back again

992
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,526
and take notes for editing.

993
00:56:27,568 --> 00:56:30,654
The pacing had gotten away
from me.

994
00:56:30,696 --> 00:56:33,490
It was much too erratic
for good continuity.

995
00:56:33,532 --> 00:56:36,285
It was impossible for me
to retake any scenes,

996
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:41,374
so we had to cut...
and cut we did.

997
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:44,210
When we finished editing,
the movie had perfect pacing.

998
00:56:44,252 --> 00:56:48,172
It was exciting, realistic,
and a work of art.

999
00:56:48,214 --> 00:56:53,052
I was a man with a message,
and my message was.

1000
00:56:53,094 --> 00:56:54,803
"The Man Who Got Away."

1001
00:57:03,938 --> 00:57:05,189
What do you think, Ruggerio?

1002
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:08,984
With the sound effects
and music dubbed in,

1003
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:10,569
it'll be a little masterpiece.

1004
00:57:10,611 --> 00:57:13,406
I've never seen anything
quite like it before.

1005
00:57:13,448 --> 00:57:15,783
Unfortunately, we're
gonna have to put back

1006
00:57:15,824 --> 00:57:18,077
27 minutes of film.

1007
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:20,037
3 minutes could be
taken in titling,

1008
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,916
but the other 24 are gonna have
to be just plain old padding.

1009
00:57:23,958 --> 00:57:29,130
Can we pad 24 minutes
and still maintain the pace

1010
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:31,257
after I've set the mood
and so on?

1011
00:57:31,299 --> 00:57:33,634
Nope, but we got no choice.

1012
00:57:33,675 --> 00:57:34,760
Why is that?

1013
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:36,095
You know as well as
I do, Mr. Hudson,

1014
00:57:36,137 --> 00:57:38,097
that a movie
is 90 minutes long,

1015
00:57:38,139 --> 00:57:39,223
6 full reels.

1016
00:57:39,265 --> 00:57:40,557
That's the business.

1017
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:43,227
But unnecessary padding
will ruin my movie.

1018
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:44,437
Not really.

1019
00:57:44,479 --> 00:57:46,188
We could stretch the hell

1020
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,773
out of that chase
down the highway.

1021
00:57:47,815 --> 00:57:48,941
We've got stock stuff

1022
00:57:48,983 --> 00:57:50,234
that I haven't even seen yet,

1023
00:57:50,276 --> 00:57:51,568
reel after reel of it:

1024
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,738
City views, wildflowers,
traffic jams,

1025
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,073
all kinds of stuff.

1026
00:57:56,115 --> 00:57:57,450
I remember a western once

1027
00:57:57,492 --> 00:58:00,744
where I stretched out a
desert chase 25 minutes

1028
00:58:00,786 --> 00:58:03,622
with long shots of different
guys riding on horseback.

1029
00:58:03,664 --> 00:58:05,791
Nobody knew the difference.

1030
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:07,251
People like chases.

1031
00:58:07,293 --> 00:58:09,378
"The Man Who Got Away"
isn't a western.

1032
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,422
Yeah, but he doesn't
really get away either.

1033
00:58:11,464 --> 00:58:12,923
It's the same thing
as a big chase.

1034
00:58:12,965 --> 00:58:13,966
Damn it, no!

1035
00:58:14,008 --> 00:58:15,134
As far as I'm concerned,

1036
00:58:15,176 --> 00:58:16,969
my movie will run as it is,

1037
00:58:17,011 --> 00:58:18,762
27 minutes short, period!

1038
00:58:18,804 --> 00:58:21,223
I'm not gonna ruin my movie
because of some stupid ruling

1039
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:23,184
that says it has to be
90 minutes long.

1040
00:58:23,225 --> 00:58:24,977
That's up to you, Mr. Hudson,

1041
00:58:25,019 --> 00:58:26,645
if you can get it by the man.

1042
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,939
It doesn't make
a difference to me.

1043
00:58:28,981 --> 00:58:30,399
But you can't.

1044
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:32,193
I only wish you could.

1045
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:37,365
Will you back me
in this thing, then?

1046
00:58:37,406 --> 00:58:38,657
Will you go to the man with me

1047
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:41,160
and insist that the movie
should be left as is

1048
00:58:41,202 --> 00:58:42,828
at 63 minutes?

1049
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,455
Nope.

1050
00:58:44,497 --> 00:58:45,418
I'll tell 'em the truth.

1051
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:47,041
The movie's too short.

1052
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:51,837
Well, I think that you
are a son of a bitch,

1053
00:58:51,879 --> 00:58:53,172
Ruggerio.

1054
00:58:53,214 --> 00:58:54,340
Tell me one thing,

1055
00:58:54,382 --> 00:58:55,674
yet you'll tell
the man another.

1056
00:58:55,716 --> 00:58:57,593
I'm not telling you
any lies, Mr. Hudson.

1057
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,720
A movie is 90 minutes long.

1058
00:58:59,761 --> 00:59:02,223
How would you like an upper
lip full of front teeth?

1059
00:59:02,264 --> 00:59:03,682
I wouldn't like it, Mr. Hudson,

1060
00:59:03,724 --> 00:59:05,809
but that wouldn't change
anything either.

1061
00:59:05,851 --> 00:59:08,770
You want to take a swing at me?
Go ahead.

1062
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:10,647
But a movie is still
90 minutes long.

1063
00:59:10,689 --> 00:59:12,107
Mine won't be.
Is that understood?

1064
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:13,484
Yes, sir.

1065
00:59:13,526 --> 00:59:14,485
All right, attend to the
title and the credits.

1066
00:59:14,527 --> 00:59:15,903
You keep your damn mouth shut

1067
00:59:15,944 --> 00:59:17,654
about the length of my movie.

1068
00:59:17,696 --> 00:59:18,489
I'll have the music
and sound effects

1069
00:59:18,531 --> 00:59:19,448
put in myself.

1070
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:22,368
You're the director,
Mr. Hudson.

1071
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:25,580
Oh, you're damn right I am!

1072
00:59:25,621 --> 00:59:27,289
Ha ha!

1073
00:59:34,255 --> 00:59:35,631
Are you ready?

1074
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:38,092
The juice is buzzing
in the box.

1075
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:39,760
Ok, Flaps,

1076
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:40,886
tune down fine,

1077
00:59:40,928 --> 00:59:42,679
and I think you know
all the cues.

1078
00:59:42,721 --> 00:59:44,139
But once again,
during the opening,

1079
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:47,435
I want you to play as mean
and lowdown as you can.

1080
00:59:47,476 --> 00:59:49,395
How many times have you
seen the movie now?

1081
00:59:49,437 --> 00:59:52,356
5 times, and it's good,
Mr. Hudson.

1082
00:59:52,398 --> 00:59:53,690
Thank you. Would you like

1083
00:59:53,732 --> 00:59:55,234
to see it cold again
before we start?

1084
00:59:55,276 --> 00:59:56,985
No, sir, I'm ready to play.

1085
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:58,279
You want another dry run?

1086
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,531
No, sir, I'm ready. I'm ready.

1087
01:00:00,573 --> 01:00:02,699
How about questions? Do you
have any questions at all?

1088
01:00:02,741 --> 01:00:03,825
Any at all?

1089
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:05,387
No, sir. Movie damn
near broke my heart.

1090
01:00:05,411 --> 01:00:07,037
All right, well, play
that way, then, Flaps.

1091
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:08,414
When the movie starts,

1092
01:00:08,456 --> 01:00:09,582
I'm gonna be in the booth,

1093
01:00:09,624 --> 01:00:10,583
and I'll give you
the finger like this.

1094
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:12,084
You bang it out hard.
Forget me.

1095
01:00:12,126 --> 01:00:13,586
Forget the people in the booth,

1096
01:00:13,628 --> 01:00:16,297
everything else except what
you see on that screen.

1097
01:00:16,338 --> 01:00:18,382
If you feel like humming
while you play,

1098
01:00:18,424 --> 01:00:19,716
go ahead.

1099
01:00:19,758 --> 01:00:21,552
I like the way
you did last time.

1100
01:00:21,594 --> 01:00:23,178
I didn't mean to start
humming like that, Mr. Hudson,

1101
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,598
Sometimes I do it
'cause I just can't help it.

1102
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,723
That's all right, Flaps.

1103
01:00:26,765 --> 01:00:28,517
I like it.
You're a true artist.

1104
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:31,937
Did you notice during
the last run-through

1105
01:00:31,979 --> 01:00:34,189
your name sitting
up there all by itself,

1106
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:36,108
separate frame?

1107
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:39,820
"Music by Flaps Hartwell."

1108
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:41,621
I almost fainted when I
saw that, Mr. Hudson.

1109
01:00:41,656 --> 01:00:43,365
That's the way I work, Flaps.

1110
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:45,326
Where credit is due, I give it.

1111
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:46,577
You deserve credit
for the music,

1112
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:47,703
and I'm giving it to you.

1113
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,622
Millions of people
all over the world

1114
01:00:49,664 --> 01:00:52,333
are gonna see your name
on that screen,

1115
01:00:52,374 --> 01:00:53,459
and when this movie
gets released,

1116
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:55,043
you're gonna have
a tote sack full of mail

1117
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:56,837
from people you never heard of.

1118
01:00:56,878 --> 01:00:58,758
When the film starts,
Flaps, you're on your own.

1119
01:00:58,797 --> 01:00:59,918
We're only gonna do this once

1120
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:02,259
because I want
the music to be spontaneous.

1121
01:01:02,301 --> 01:01:04,345
I want to make that clear.

1122
01:01:04,386 --> 01:01:05,596
I won't be able to help you.

1123
01:01:05,638 --> 01:01:07,097
You'll just have
to watch and play,

1124
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:10,100
watch and play, and let
the emotion you feel

1125
01:01:10,142 --> 01:01:11,310
come from this.

1126
01:01:11,352 --> 01:01:12,853
I'm ready, gosh darn it,

1127
01:01:12,894 --> 01:01:15,523
and I done told you
100 times, I'm ready!

1128
01:01:15,564 --> 01:01:18,609
We're ready, too, Mr. Hudson.

1129
01:01:23,531 --> 01:01:25,782
Mammoth Studios,
"The Man Who Got Away,"

1130
01:01:25,824 --> 01:01:29,578
reel one, cue one,
first and last take.

1131
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:49,097
All ready for the man, Pop.

1132
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:52,809
Where are the other two reels?

1133
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:55,646
It just so happened
I didn't need 6 reels.

1134
01:01:55,688 --> 01:01:58,607
63 minutes were all I needed.

1135
01:01:58,649 --> 01:01:59,941
I was under the impression

1136
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:02,737
you'd have trouble
cutting to 90 minutes.

1137
01:02:02,778 --> 01:02:04,405
But 63?

1138
01:02:04,446 --> 01:02:06,323
I realize it's
a bit unorthodox, Pop,

1139
01:02:06,365 --> 01:02:07,408
but I had to cut.

1140
01:02:07,449 --> 01:02:09,201
That's all there is to it.

1141
01:02:09,243 --> 01:02:13,414
You don't think maybe you could
add, say, one more reel?

1142
01:02:13,455 --> 01:02:15,332
Another 15 minutes?

1143
01:02:15,374 --> 01:02:18,419
No, nothing. I couldn't
add another 15 seconds.

1144
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,963
The movie is perfect as is.

1145
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:24,007
I'll stake my reputation on it.

1146
01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:25,426
What about mine?

1147
01:02:25,467 --> 01:02:26,594
Well, I'll stake yours, too.

1148
01:02:31,724 --> 01:02:33,601
This isn't just
another movie, Richard.

1149
01:02:33,642 --> 01:02:35,102
I know it isn't.

1150
01:02:35,143 --> 01:02:36,270
It'll make people angry.

1151
01:02:36,311 --> 01:02:37,438
That's right.

1152
01:02:37,479 --> 01:02:39,106
There will be letters.
Bound to be.

1153
01:02:39,147 --> 01:02:40,775
That little girl.

1154
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,570
The tire marks
across her white dress.

1155
01:02:44,612 --> 01:02:46,238
Too bad it isn't in color.

1156
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,907
That little girl
is very disturbing.

1157
01:02:48,949 --> 01:02:50,117
You're putting it mildly.

1158
01:02:50,158 --> 01:02:52,244
The music frightens me.

1159
01:02:52,286 --> 01:02:53,537
Good, isn't it?

1160
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:55,748
The movie isn't cynical.

1161
01:02:57,082 --> 01:02:58,208
It's bitter.

1162
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:02,129
Right. If that's
how you want to put it.

1163
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:04,465
Why are you so unhappy?

1164
01:03:04,506 --> 01:03:07,551
Oh, I'm not unhappy, Pop.

1165
01:03:07,593 --> 01:03:11,263
I'm the happiest man
in the world.

1166
01:03:11,305 --> 01:03:12,765
No!

1167
01:03:12,807 --> 01:03:17,561
If you will please refrain
from any more outbursts

1168
01:03:17,603 --> 01:03:21,523
until I complete my plans
in detail

1169
01:03:21,565 --> 01:03:23,609
for "The Man Who Got Away."

1170
01:03:23,651 --> 01:03:25,778
You on his side or mine, Leo?

1171
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:27,946
Can't you just listen?

1172
01:03:27,988 --> 01:03:30,616
For once in your life listen.

1173
01:03:30,658 --> 01:03:33,619
"The Mammoth Hour"
will be a television series

1174
01:03:33,661 --> 01:03:37,539
of 13 one-hour film shows

1175
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:41,335
starting with
"The Man Who Got Away."

1176
01:03:41,376 --> 01:03:43,712
The entire series
will attack inequities

1177
01:03:43,754 --> 01:03:45,297
in the American way of life

1178
01:03:45,339 --> 01:03:47,341
through adequate documentation.

1179
01:03:47,382 --> 01:03:49,092
Segregation, taxation, unions,

1180
01:03:49,134 --> 01:03:53,472
any and all of the problems
affecting the American people.

1181
01:03:53,514 --> 01:03:55,683
It's a grand plan, Richard.

1182
01:03:55,724 --> 01:03:57,934
Mr. Steinberg has agreed to be

1183
01:03:57,976 --> 01:04:00,646
the executive producer
of the series,

1184
01:04:00,688 --> 01:04:03,565
and he will have free rein.

1185
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:06,360
Nepotism is not unheard of
in Hollywood, Mr. Hudson,

1186
01:04:06,401 --> 01:04:10,238
and I'm certain your stepfather
will allow you to direct

1187
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:14,409
some of the better scripts
at $1,500 a show.

1188
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,411
You'll have your
choice, Richard.

1189
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:18,455
Your movie contains
all the elements

1190
01:04:18,497 --> 01:04:20,165
that I was looking for
in a pilot.

1191
01:04:20,207 --> 01:04:21,542
A shocker.

1192
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:25,838
It will cause angry comments,
letters, and editorials.

1193
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:30,091
You'll be the most talked about
writer/director on television.

1194
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:33,053
Now, tell me you object.

1195
01:04:33,094 --> 01:04:37,474
"The Man Who Got Away"
is exactly 63 minutes long.

1196
01:04:37,516 --> 01:04:38,893
In a one-hour television drama

1197
01:04:38,934 --> 01:04:41,269
there is first the
announcer, one minute.

1198
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:42,979
He announces the host.

1199
01:04:43,021 --> 01:04:45,524
The host informs the audience
about what they're gonna see.

1200
01:04:45,566 --> 01:04:47,067
Two minutes.

1201
01:04:47,108 --> 01:04:48,988
Then there are the commercials
every 15 minutes.

1202
01:04:49,027 --> 01:04:50,612
That's another 10 minutes.

1203
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:53,407
Not counting the station
break at half-hour,

1204
01:04:53,448 --> 01:04:55,492
and then the end, more host.

1205
01:04:55,534 --> 01:04:57,202
You exaggerate, Mr. Hudson.

1206
01:04:57,244 --> 01:04:58,203
No, I don't.

1207
01:04:58,245 --> 01:04:59,705
All that would be
left of my movie

1208
01:04:59,747 --> 01:05:01,707
would be about 40 minutes.

1209
01:05:01,749 --> 01:05:03,417
"The Man Who Got Away"

1210
01:05:03,458 --> 01:05:05,669
is like a giant snowball
going downhill

1211
01:05:05,711 --> 01:05:08,129
and getting larger
with danger and suspense

1212
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:11,132
until it explodes!

1213
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:12,676
A single break in continuity,

1214
01:05:12,718 --> 01:05:14,386
the effect is gone.

1215
01:05:14,428 --> 01:05:20,100
Now, on television, your movie
will reach 50 million people.

1216
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:21,852
Who can follow it?

1217
01:05:21,894 --> 01:05:23,395
Part of what you say is true,

1218
01:05:23,437 --> 01:05:25,522
there will be a host
and commercials.

1219
01:05:25,564 --> 01:05:27,065
But I'll be the host,

1220
01:05:27,107 --> 01:05:29,025
and I'm positive
the movie can be cut

1221
01:05:29,067 --> 01:05:32,195
in many places without
complete loss of continuity.

1222
01:05:32,237 --> 01:05:33,864
And with your approval
on each cut...

1223
01:05:33,906 --> 01:05:36,575
I won't ok anything!

1224
01:05:36,617 --> 01:05:38,285
This is a movie,

1225
01:05:38,326 --> 01:05:41,496
an m-o-v-i-e!

1226
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:43,665
It was designed
for movie theaters

1227
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:46,084
with a full audience
in attendance.

1228
01:05:46,126 --> 01:05:47,753
If it is projected
in a theater,

1229
01:05:47,795 --> 01:05:49,504
it'll tear the guts
out of the audience,

1230
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:51,047
throw 'em down the aisles,

1231
01:05:51,089 --> 01:05:53,508
but it can't do that
on television!

1232
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,510
Not a chopped up with deodorant

1233
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:59,222
and sanitary pad commercials!

1234
01:05:59,264 --> 01:06:00,682
Exactly!

1235
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:03,644
Your piddling one-hour movie

1236
01:06:03,685 --> 01:06:05,479
would scare moviegoers to death

1237
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,773
in a movie theater.

1238
01:06:07,815 --> 01:06:11,944
It has to be broken up
to destroy the realism.

1239
01:06:11,986 --> 01:06:15,280
But there will be
enough realism left

1240
01:06:15,322 --> 01:06:18,784
for an artistic triumph.

1241
01:06:18,826 --> 01:06:22,162
You had better wake up,
Mr. Hudson!

1242
01:06:22,203 --> 01:06:25,624
I am in this chair to
make money for Mammoth Studios

1243
01:06:25,666 --> 01:06:28,961
and for no other reason.

1244
01:06:29,003 --> 01:06:32,422
On Leo's faith in your ability,
I took a chance,

1245
01:06:32,464 --> 01:06:33,882
and it has paid off.

1246
01:06:33,924 --> 01:06:35,258
Don't you think you're being

1247
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,218
a little unreasonable, Richard.

1248
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,721
Oh, not you, Pop?

1249
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:41,389
I mean, I understand
this stupid son of a bitch.

1250
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:43,308
All he's concerned about
is making money,

1251
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:45,978
but you, Leo, you!

1252
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:48,605
You're only thinking
about yourself.

1253
01:06:48,647 --> 01:06:50,774
Try and understand my side.

1254
01:06:50,816 --> 01:06:52,943
This is my opportunity.

1255
01:06:52,985 --> 01:06:54,402
That's enough, Mr. Steinberg.

1256
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:58,907
You are excused, Hudson.

1257
01:06:58,949 --> 01:07:00,492
What do you mean, "excused"?

1258
01:07:00,534 --> 01:07:02,911
'Cause I own a third of the
movie and Leo owns another,

1259
01:07:02,953 --> 01:07:05,080
where does that leave you?

1260
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:09,084
With 2/3.

1261
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,672
It was part of the deal.

1262
01:07:13,714 --> 01:07:15,549
In return for my rights,

1263
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:17,384
I was given a 7-year contract

1264
01:07:17,425 --> 01:07:18,844
at the end of the series.

1265
01:07:18,886 --> 01:07:21,972
In my place, you would
have done the same.

1266
01:07:39,573 --> 01:07:40,657
You rat.

1267
01:07:40,699 --> 01:07:42,826
I'm sorry.

1268
01:07:42,868 --> 01:07:44,536
How did I splash you?

1269
01:07:44,578 --> 01:07:46,121
Like this?

1270
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:47,831
Ah!

1271
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:51,126
I've been trying to figure out

1272
01:07:51,209 --> 01:07:52,544
what color your hair is.

1273
01:07:52,586 --> 01:07:54,796
It's clear.

1274
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:01,595
School's over, huh, Richard?

1275
01:08:01,636 --> 01:08:04,056
No more grade 9, Charlie.

1276
01:08:04,098 --> 01:08:06,016
At least 'til next year.

1277
01:08:12,981 --> 01:08:14,190
Hi, Ricky.

1278
01:08:23,617 --> 01:08:27,203
Free ride on my handlebars
if you come out this week.

1279
01:08:45,931 --> 01:08:49,559
Could we get that Coke
some other time, Richard?

1280
01:08:49,601 --> 01:08:51,269
I really must be running.

1281
01:08:51,311 --> 01:08:52,980
In one terrible moment,

1282
01:08:53,021 --> 01:08:57,025
I realized that I had reached
a point of no return.

1283
01:08:57,067 --> 01:09:00,070
It was nice to meet you.

1284
01:09:00,112 --> 01:09:01,155
In a pair of swimming trunks,

1285
01:09:01,196 --> 01:09:04,282
I was a man in the eyes
of a woman.

1286
01:09:04,324 --> 01:09:07,619
But on dry land
on the seat of a Schwinn,

1287
01:09:07,661 --> 01:09:10,664
the illusion was broken.

1288
01:09:10,705 --> 01:09:14,001
From that moment on,
my childhood was over.

1289
01:09:14,042 --> 01:09:17,171
I began to dress the part,
act the part.

1290
01:09:17,212 --> 01:09:21,633
And I moved into the adult world
with its adult veterans.

1291
01:09:21,675 --> 01:09:25,887
But when I fled blindly from the
office of the man almost in tears,

1292
01:09:25,929 --> 01:09:29,891
I knew that I was still a child
in an adult world.

1293
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:37,191
People like Leo and the man
feed on men like me.

1294
01:09:37,232 --> 01:09:38,984
And borrow our dreams
for their own ends

1295
01:09:39,026 --> 01:09:43,279
because they're too grown up
to have any dreams of their own.

1296
01:09:46,407 --> 01:09:48,785
Like getting rid of a moth.

1297
01:09:52,164 --> 01:09:54,916
A moth will follow a light.

1298
01:09:57,335 --> 01:09:59,046
You can lead them
right out the door

1299
01:09:59,087 --> 01:10:02,216
if you know the trick.

1300
01:10:02,257 --> 01:10:04,467
Watch it, pal.

1301
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:15,687
When the porch light
is finally switched off,

1302
01:10:15,729 --> 01:10:17,856
the moth is out in the cold
and cannot understand

1303
01:10:17,898 --> 01:10:20,817
what happened to
all the pretty lights.

1304
01:10:31,619 --> 01:10:34,831
5 minutes under a cold shower
and 3 cups of instant coffee

1305
01:10:34,873 --> 01:10:37,333
peeled away several layers
of drunkenness.

1306
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:43,882
I felt mildly exhilarated,
light, strong, and angry.

1307
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:49,304
Leo was, after all
was said and done, a genius.

1308
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:51,556
If his nose was to be broken,

1309
01:10:51,598 --> 01:10:53,516
it should be done so
respectfully.

1310
01:10:53,558 --> 01:10:56,644
Now is the time
for all good and bad

1311
01:10:56,686 --> 01:11:01,149
to come to the aid
of their party.

1312
01:11:01,191 --> 01:11:03,651
Right-o, Mr. Hudson.

1313
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:18,541
He couldn't wait.

1314
01:11:24,214 --> 01:11:27,342
He couldn't wait
to get his damn clown back.

1315
01:11:57,247 --> 01:11:58,748
Good evening, Mr. Hudson.

1316
01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:01,042
Working late tonight, huh?

1317
01:12:06,298 --> 01:12:08,424
Look forward to
seeing your movie.

1318
01:12:23,481 --> 01:12:26,151
What are you doing
in my office?

1319
01:12:26,193 --> 01:12:28,153
I wanted to see you, Richard.

1320
01:12:28,195 --> 01:12:30,155
Ok, you've seen me.
Now get out.

1321
01:12:30,197 --> 01:12:31,781
Not until I've talked to you.

1322
01:12:31,823 --> 01:12:33,616
Go ahead and talk, then.

1323
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:35,493
Throughout her little speech,

1324
01:12:35,535 --> 01:12:37,912
I pulled out all
of the mimeographed copies

1325
01:12:37,954 --> 01:12:39,873
of "The Man Who Got Away."

1326
01:12:39,914 --> 01:12:42,000
The scripts would make
an excellent fire.

1327
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:44,794
This time you're
gonna listen to me.

1328
01:12:44,836 --> 01:12:46,254
Talk fast. I'm
leaving in a minute.

1329
01:12:46,296 --> 01:12:49,174
No, you're not going anywhere.

1330
01:12:49,216 --> 01:12:51,343
I'm pregnant.

1331
01:12:51,385 --> 01:12:53,178
Yeah? Go on.

1332
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,762
You have to marry me, Richard.

1333
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:56,306
No.

1334
01:12:56,348 --> 01:12:58,933
I've been going crazy.

1335
01:12:58,975 --> 01:13:02,187
I couldn't see you. I couldn't
get you on the telephone.

1336
01:13:02,229 --> 01:13:03,521
I even wrote you a letter.

1337
01:13:03,563 --> 01:13:04,981
We get a lot of crank
letters at the studio.

1338
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,191
You don't understand.

1339
01:13:06,233 --> 01:13:08,235
I'm gonna have a baby.

1340
01:13:08,276 --> 01:13:10,486
Our baby, Richard.

1341
01:13:10,528 --> 01:13:12,364
Does the light bother you?

1342
01:13:12,406 --> 01:13:14,324
The studio has a
campaign, you know,

1343
01:13:14,366 --> 01:13:15,950
saving electricity.

1344
01:13:53,321 --> 01:13:54,906
Somewhere in this library

1345
01:13:54,948 --> 01:13:57,951
in 4 cans my movie
was filed away,

1346
01:13:57,992 --> 01:14:01,704
but it would take too long
to find it.

1347
01:14:01,746 --> 01:14:05,500
It was much easier to burn
the entire library.

1348
01:14:45,206 --> 01:14:47,417
After burning down the studio,

1349
01:14:47,459 --> 01:14:51,004
I was thirsty and lonely.

1350
01:14:51,045 --> 01:14:53,756
By accident I happened to select
a fairy hangout,

1351
01:14:53,798 --> 01:14:56,050
but that didn't bother me.

1352
01:14:56,092 --> 01:14:58,803
It wasn't that I wanted
contact companionship,

1353
01:14:58,845 --> 01:15:01,306
male, female, or in between,

1354
01:15:01,348 --> 01:15:03,641
I just wanted
to be near people.

1355
01:15:10,482 --> 01:15:12,275
Tell the boy to sing it again.

1356
01:15:12,317 --> 01:15:13,401
Yes, sir.

1357
01:15:13,443 --> 01:15:16,154
It's a very popular song here.

1358
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:21,368
♪ My buddy ♪

01:15:21,409 --> 01:15:26,498

One minute, Captain.

1366
01:15:52,982 --> 01:15:54,484
I'm gonna give you
some more money,

1367
01:15:54,526 --> 01:15:55,818
but you're gonna have to wait

1368
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,778
until the waiter
brings me some change.

1369
01:15:58,696 --> 01:16:00,490
All ones.

1371
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:07,038
How long have you

1372
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,415
Almost 25 years now,

1373
01:16:08,456 --> 01:16:10,542
but my husband had more
than 30 years of service

1374
01:16:10,584 --> 01:16:12,001
before he died.

1375
01:16:12,043 --> 01:16:14,879
We traveled all
through Europe together.

1376
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:16,714
Why should
she tell me indirectly

1377
01:16:16,756 --> 01:16:19,551
she was a widow?

1378
01:16:19,593 --> 01:16:22,053
I had merely asked
an indifferent question

1379
01:16:22,095 --> 01:16:24,514
to have someone to talk
to for a couple minutes.

1380
01:16:24,556 --> 01:16:26,891
But our favorite was L.A.

1381
01:16:26,933 --> 01:16:28,726
Why hadn't I ever suspected Leo

1382
01:16:28,768 --> 01:16:31,062
the way I suspected
this poor, innocent woman

1383
01:16:31,104 --> 01:16:34,774
for no reason at all?

1384
01:16:34,815 --> 01:16:36,401
Would you like
a cold drink, Captain?

1385
01:16:37,735 --> 01:16:39,529
And then I had to know.

1386
01:16:39,571 --> 01:16:40,530
Oh, no.

1387
01:16:40,572 --> 01:16:43,032
Bring a Coke for the officer

1388
01:16:43,074 --> 01:16:45,701
and another one
of these for me.

1389
01:16:45,743 --> 01:16:48,162
I had to make the test.

1390
01:16:48,204 --> 01:16:53,501
And then I would truly know
once and for all.

1391
01:16:53,543 --> 01:16:56,003
I've got a deal for you.

1392
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:57,088
Who do you think you are?

1393
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:58,714
How dare you.

1394
01:16:58,756 --> 01:17:00,174
After two more drinks apiece,

1395
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:01,884
it was time for the test.

1396
01:17:01,926 --> 01:17:04,596
Just incredibly rude.

1397
01:17:04,638 --> 01:17:06,556
When was the last time
you had a man?

1398
01:17:06,598 --> 01:17:08,099
No, keep your...

1399
01:17:08,141 --> 01:17:09,934
I'm all right.

1400
01:17:09,976 --> 01:17:12,019
You might enjoy the evening.

1401
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:16,941
In the end,
we settled on 150 cash.

1402
01:17:16,983 --> 01:17:21,446
I would have gone higher,
much higher.

1403
01:17:21,488 --> 01:17:23,281
I had no feelings of triumph.

1404
01:17:23,323 --> 01:17:29,245
She had her price, just like
everybody else I had ever known.

1405
01:17:29,287 --> 01:17:32,499
Like Leo, the one man
in the world I had respected

1406
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:36,043
for incorruptible integrity.

1407
01:17:36,085 --> 01:17:37,295
I had Rio over,

1408
01:17:37,337 --> 01:17:40,548
and she clacked away,
loquacious with excitement

1409
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:42,550
of the unaccustomed liquor.

1410
01:17:42,592 --> 01:17:45,094
It began to sink in:

1411
01:17:45,136 --> 01:17:49,265
Anyone and everyone
could be bought.

1412
01:17:49,307 --> 01:17:54,437
I remember I used to take
money from my mother's purse.

1413
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:56,981
Started out with pennies,

1414
01:17:57,023 --> 01:17:59,442
and then I moved up to nickels,

1415
01:17:59,484 --> 01:18:01,319
and then I finally
took some dimes,

1416
01:18:01,361 --> 01:18:04,614
and I felt really bad
about that.

1417
01:18:04,656 --> 01:18:07,701
Captain Louise Havershaw,

1418
01:18:07,742 --> 01:18:13,956
widow, saver of souls,
and now at the age of 53,

1419
01:18:13,998 --> 01:18:15,124
call girl.

1420
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:23,424
All at once I knew I couldn't
go through with it.

1421
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:46,781
8:00 wake-up call, room 101.

1422
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:12,473
Well, not the face of a failure
surely.

1423
01:19:32,993 --> 01:19:34,746
Somehow I had gotten reality

1424
01:19:34,788 --> 01:19:38,999
mixed up with a dream,
a bad dream.

1425
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:42,754
Now that the dream was over,
I had to get back to work,

1426
01:19:42,796 --> 01:19:44,798
sell cars, as many of them
as possible

1427
01:19:44,839 --> 01:19:49,677
so I could get even again,
get Honest Al even again.

1428
01:19:49,719 --> 01:19:52,305
Movies were not for me,
Richard Hudson.

1429
01:19:52,346 --> 01:19:54,849
My kind of artistry
was salesmanship,

1430
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:58,227
the selling of used cars.

1431
01:20:16,954 --> 01:20:19,915
Bill, come out here!

1432
01:20:25,045 --> 01:20:27,047
Are these men
supposed to be salesmen?

1433
01:20:27,089 --> 01:20:28,924
Sure, Richard, they're
working for us.

1434
01:20:28,966 --> 01:20:30,343
Not anymore. Tell them
to turn in their suits

1435
01:20:30,384 --> 01:20:31,093
and head for the showers.

1436
01:20:31,135 --> 01:20:32,178
Pay 'em off.

1437
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:59,997
I resolved
to sell the first person

1438
01:21:00,039 --> 01:21:01,499
who stepped on my lot
an automobile

1439
01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:04,043
whether I lost money or not.

1440
01:21:04,084 --> 01:21:07,922
In my mind, I set a goal
of 10 cars for the first day.

1441
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:14,637
And then I heard the siren.

1442
01:21:22,729 --> 01:21:24,564
Wanted for public indecency,

1443
01:21:24,605 --> 01:21:30,319
embezzlement, arson, assault,
destruction of public property.

1444
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:47,002
God rest ye merry gentlemen.

1445
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:56,637
Ho ho ho!

1446
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:06,856
And that's what I learned

1447
01:22:06,898 --> 01:22:10,276
about storytelling
at Mammoth Studios.

1448
01:22:10,317 --> 01:22:12,361
A likeable and sympathetic hero,

1449
01:22:12,403 --> 01:22:16,783
one who affords a good measure
of your identification...

1450
01:22:16,824 --> 01:22:18,117
That's me, all right.

1451
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:20,160
Is faced with the necessity
of solving

1452
01:22:20,202 --> 01:22:22,246
a serious and urgent problem

1453
01:22:22,288 --> 01:22:25,666
which affects
his vital interests.

1454
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,919
The hero makes an effort
to solve this problem,

1455
01:22:27,961 --> 01:22:30,797
but this only succeeds
in making matters worse.

1456
01:22:30,838 --> 01:22:34,008
That is a take.

1457
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:35,384
Is it?

1458
01:22:37,177 --> 01:22:40,180
Finally there's an integrated
series of complications

1459
01:22:40,222 --> 01:22:45,853
which build up an intensity until a
definite point of crisis is reached.

1460
01:22:45,895 --> 01:22:49,565
It is here the viewer cannot
possibly understand

1461
01:22:49,607 --> 01:22:53,235
how the hero
can possibly succeed.

1462
01:22:54,528 --> 01:22:55,989
But he does.
