00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,245
- hi, mrs. Wallace.
- Hey.

177
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:44,181
- Nice day, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

178
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,350
Let me help you
with this.

179
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,619
Thank you, sweetheart.
You never came by
last week.

180
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,854
Something special happen?

181
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:53,223
I did, but
you weren't home.

182
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,026
I left a message
with that boy
who's staying here.

183
00:29:56,028 --> 00:30:00,097
- Oh, well,
he never talks much.
- Yeah, I got that impression.

184
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,699
I'm sure there's
some good in him.

185
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,601
It's just getting
it out that's hard.

186
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:07,871
- What's his name?
- Aldo. He's my grandson.

187
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:11,708
Mrs. Wallace,
you never told me
you had a grandson.

188
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,011
I didn't know
I had one.

189
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:16,513
Is emilia all right?

190
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,453
- She died.
- Oh, my god.

191
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:27,558
Mrs. Wallace,
I am so sorry.

192
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,360
- I shouldn't even
be prying into--
- oh, honey.

193
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:33,163
You know
there's no secrets here.

194
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,604
Maybe see if
he'll come help us.

195
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,375
You sure?

196
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,544
It doesn't seem like
he wants to be bothered.

197
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,413
That's his natural look.
Go on.

198
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,265
We never formally met.

199
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,834
I'm madalyn.

200
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,745
Wanna come down here
and give us a hand?

201
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,517
We could really use
the extra pair of hands.

202
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,620
I promise you it's not
as girly as you might think.

203
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,514
So what are you
writing about?

204
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,722
You're persistent.

205
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:41,358
You look like
you can use a friend.

206
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,527
A matter of opinion.

207
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:46,797
An opinion I'm sure
I didn't really ask you for.

208
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,666
I just thought,
since you're new
in town and all...

209
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:55,505
Do us both a favor.
Go back to gardening, okay?

210
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:58,608
Go ahead.
Run along. Shoo.

211
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,751
I'm sorry for your loss.

212
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:14,024
Could you please
just leave?

213
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,594
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to...

214
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:21,631
Look, I don't know you,
and I don't wanna
fucking know you.

215
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,834
- Hey, aldo.
- I'm sorry,
mrs. Wallace.

216
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,535
I was just
trying to help.

217
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:28,672
Will you both
just leave me alone?

218
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,741
I'm gonna go,
mrs. Wallace.

219
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:33,210
No, no, stay.
Don't let him
bother you.

220
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:35,479
Come on.

221
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,052
I brought you some food.
I know you must be hungry.

222
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,654
You haven't been
downstairs all day.

223
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,258
- I'll just leave it here.
- Don't bother.

224
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,026
What did you say?

225
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:25,929
I said don't bother!

226
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:28,198
I'm not gonna
eat that.

227
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,334
- And you can stop being
so fake while you're at it.
- How dare you?

228
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,336
I've tried the best I can
to make this work.

229
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:36,273
You are not gonna make me
seem like the bad guy here.

230
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:39,176
You are the one with
the problem, not me.

231
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:41,912
I'm sure that's what
my mother was to you, right?
Something to get over.

232
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,284
Aldo.

233
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,522
Aldo.

234
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,524
Aldo!

235
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,663
- Aldo.
- What do you--

236
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:44,100
- what the fuck?!
You old bitch!
- It's gotta stop.

237
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:46,503
What do you want from me?

238
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:49,272
- You are not the only
one living here.
- I don't wanna live here.

239
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:51,708
You can have your tantrums,
be all depressed if you want to.

240
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,544
I refuse to be,
and I refuse to let you

241
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,246
walk all over that place
like you don't care,
like no one cares.

242
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:59,216
Listen, I'm only your problem
until next summer,

243
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:01,851
so you won't have to
worry about it anymore.

244
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,020
Until then, I'm gonna
get some respect from you.

245
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:06,823
I don't have to
listen to this.
You're not my mother.

246
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,525
Right. I'm not your mother.

247
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:10,927
I do not deserve
to be treated like this.

248
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,930
I know emilia raised you
better than that.

249
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,699
- What did you say?
- You're gonna hit
an old woman?

250
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:18,735
I dare you. I dare you!

251
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,571
[Frustrated yell]

252
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:27,244
- you don't know me.
- That's right,
I don't know you.

253
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,713
I don't pretend
to know you.

254
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:32,182
I don't consider you
a child, but you sure
are acting like one.

255
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:34,784
Consider me gone.

256
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,821
You're not going anywhere.
Get back in the house.
You have school tomorrow, aldo.

257
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,559
Aldo! Aldo!

258
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:46,463
Aldo!

259
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,186
Well, lord, where have
you been hidin'?

260
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:12,589
Hiding. Wish I could.

261
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,824
Madalyn came by.

262
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,327
She told you?

263
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:20,096
Oh, shirley, I don't
know what I'm doing.
I'm too old for this.

264
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,899
Oh, wallace, you just old
when it's convenient for you.

265
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,505
So...

266
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:30,407
He's your daughter's son.

267
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:33,743
Shirley, he's so beautiful.
He looks just like her.

268
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:36,212
Well, I believe it.
The sun envied that girl.

269
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:39,349
- He is so angry.
- As well he should be.

270
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:42,552
And he's disrespectful,
and he's rude, not to
mention, his name is aldo.

271
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:45,088
Oh, he's an aldo junior.

272
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:48,692
He doesn't even know
his grandfather's name
was aldo.

273
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:52,362
Every time I look at him,
I see emilia and aldo.

274
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:55,765
He looks more like her,
but he's hard-headed like
the old man was.

275
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,068
Well, he's probably
in pain, hurt.

276
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,603
He's just young
and needs somebody
to guide him.

277
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:03,173
Plus, he's livin'
with a stranger.

278
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,775
Stranger?! Stranger?

279
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:09,179
- Is that what I am?
- That's exactly what you
are, wallace, a stranger.

280
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:12,182
That boy doesn't know you.
He's never even met you.

281
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,717
What did you
expect him to do,

282
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,086
just come in and instantly
run into your arms?

283
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:18,822
- Well?
- You know you ran
your daughter off.

284
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:20,890
How many times you
gonna tell me that?

285
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,159
- Until you get it
through your head.
- Well, it is through.

286
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:25,729
In one ear
and right out the other.

287
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:28,765
What happened between
you and her is what
put that man in his grave.

288
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:31,735
I'll never understand it.
That girl dreamt of
being anywhere but here.

289
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:34,037
She never cared about
nobody but herself.

290
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,606
Wallace, how can you
go and say somethin'
like that?

291
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:39,109
Care. Care!
She loved you, wallace.

292
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:41,211
She wanted more
for her life.

293
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,713
She wanted more
for her life than
just livin' in a house

294
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:47,016
that's been here
hundreds of years,
and I don't blame her.

295
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,819
That girl wanted
to see the world.

296
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,921
And I remember.

297
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:54,391
She waited, and she
waited for your approval.

298
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,826
You never gave it to her,
so what did she do?

299
00:39:56,828 --> 00:40:00,163
She left,
and when she did,

300
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:02,565
aldo was never the same.

301
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,535
Mm-mm. He was not
right after that.

302
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:08,071
Now listen to me, sister.

303
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,243
You get a second chance
now with this boy.

304
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,545
Most people don't
get a second chance, wallace,

305
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:18,047
but god gave that to you.

306
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:20,550
Don't you run this boy off
like you did her.

307
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:23,119
You hear me?

308
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,390
Now come on.
Let's go get us some tea.

309
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,421
[Knocking on door]
time for school.

310
00:41:31,423 --> 00:41:33,590
Get up.

311
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:37,560
- I'm not going.
- That's what you think.

312
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,343
What the hell?!

313
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,712
- Time for school.
- Are you crazy?

314
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,714
Get dressed.
The bus is coming
in an hour.

315
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,816
And I'm sure
I won't be there.

316
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:01,851
And I'm sure
you will. Ha ha!

317
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,488
[Angry yell]
oh, god!

318
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,329
- Aldo.
- I went to
school, okay?

319
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:48,998
- How was it?
- School.

320
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,401
I know, but did
you meet anyone?

321
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,603
Really, come on,
let's not do
this right now.

322
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,872
- I'm gonna go to my room
if that's okay with you.
- Aldo, i--

323
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:58,107
look, I'll go to
school and back
because you're forcing me.

324
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:00,310
We don't have to
talk about it.

325
00:43:00,312 --> 00:43:03,413
We don't have to be
friends or anything,
okay?

326
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:05,682
- Okay?
- [Thunder rumbling]

327
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:09,552
so you just
leave me alone,
I'll leave you alone.

328
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:12,388
It'll be like
I was never here.

329
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:41,551
? I'm so tired
of the myth that goes?

330
00:43:41,553 --> 00:43:48,157
? That nice guys come first
and bad ones come last?

331
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,227
? I should know by now

332
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:54,097
? Things are not
what they seem?

333
00:43:54,099 --> 00:44:00,169
? And if I do,
then I must be crazy?

334
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:05,808
? 'Cause time has taught me
that in order to play the game?

335
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:13,149
? You must be willing to
throw away your self?

336
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:17,387
? If I can't be
part of the game?

337
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:25,461
? I'll end up losing
every ounce I have left?

338
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:33,836
?

339
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,448
[Phone rings]

340
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:27,256
- [ringing continues]
- hello.

341
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:31,461
Yes.
What are you saying?

342
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,657
I thought being
waited up for

343
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:37,160
- stopped when you were
12 years old.
- Stop it!

344
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:40,329
Just stop. I've let you
walk all over me
these past months.

345
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:43,132
I'm not gonna let you
stand there and lie
to my face.

346
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,801
[Derisive laugh]
lie about what?

347
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:46,702
You know what
I'm talking about.

348
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:49,138
Your principal
called this morning.
You haven't been in school.

349
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,474
I'm sitting there on the phone
feeling like a fool,

350
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:52,809
feeling like
a goddamn fool,

351
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:54,977
because it never
occurred to me

352
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:58,047
that you could be
so deceptive, so manipulative.

353
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:01,317
Aldo, I'm at a loss
for words.

354
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,152
There's nothing
left to say.

355
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,588
You can't stay here.
This just isn't gonna work.

356
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,057
Pack your things and leave.
You're in god's hands now.

357
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:10,560
Now you wanna bring
god into this.

358
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:13,663
When he's ready,
I'll be here waiting.

359
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:16,899
I'm sure he's already
figured out...

360
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,139
Aldo. Aldo, stop.

361
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:25,308
Who are you
trying to fool?

362
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,811
Look around. There's
no one here for you
to be tough in front of.

363
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:31,514
If you're in pain,
be in pain.

364
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,883
If you're in mourning,
mourn. Why don't you cry?

365
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:36,886
I am in pain!
I am angry!

366
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:40,656
I've lost all feeling!

367
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:45,728
I'm numb to everything.
Numb to everyone.

368
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,631
Can't you see
that I'm suffering?

369
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:51,133
[Crying]

370
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:53,236
I'm not this person.

371
00:47:53,238 --> 00:47:56,873
I don't know
how I got like this.

372
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,709
My life, it's so...

373
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,878
I just want it to end.

374
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:07,717
Aldo, stop.

375
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,022
Do you know what it's like
to sit at home

376
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:17,326
and wait for someone
who you know is never,
ever gonna come back?

377
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:23,199
Still, you sit there
and you wait.

378
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,203
You think to yourself,

379
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:30,806
what was the last thing
I said to 'em?

380
00:48:30,808 --> 00:48:34,543
Did I say anything at all?
Do you know what that's like?

381
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,492
I do.

382
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:51,928
- Yeah.
- I do.

383
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:56,799
I drove your mother away
and sat by that door for months,

384
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:59,402
waiting for her
to walk through it.

385
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:03,139
Waited by the phone
for a phone call.

386
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:05,875
Mail couldn't get here
fast enough.

387
00:49:05,877 --> 00:49:08,110
Anything so I'd know
she was fine.

388
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:12,982
It's my fault that
I wasn't in your life.

389
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:15,584
It's my fault that
I don't know you.

390
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,889
I wake up with that
every morning.

391
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:27,129
I wake up with that
sense of lost time every day.

392
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:30,800
But I refused to let it
do to me what it did before,

393
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:34,804
what it did to
your grandfather,
what it did to us.

394
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:37,073
[Sighs]

395
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:39,642
I know what
you're going through.

396
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:43,579
[Rueful chuckle]
believe me.

397
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:45,648
I know very well.

398
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,420
Emilia was taken from you.

399
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,791
You had no choice.

400
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:57,793
I had every choice.

401
00:49:57,795 --> 00:50:01,464
And I made the wrong choice.

402
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:03,966
I'll never forgive
myself for that.

403
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:07,236
I live with that
every day.

404
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:11,040
I'll live with that
till the day I die.

405
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,158
I'd like to stay...

406
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,994
If you'd let me.

407
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:34,296
I'm sorry.

408
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:37,666
You didn't do
anything wrong.

409
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:41,137
Look at the way I've been,
the way I've treated you.

410
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:44,273
- I've been such an ass.
- How could you have known?

411
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,490
I was wondering if
you wouldn't mind

412
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:38,127
me taking a look
in the shed at the car.

413
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:40,362
I know you don't like
people messin' with it and--

414
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:44,633
go ahead. Nothing you can do
to it that hasn't already
been done.

415
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:47,136
- Really?
- Sure.

416
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:09,024
Madalyn: aldo?

417
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:16,632
Mrs. Wallace told me
you'd be in here.

418
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,868
Said you might
be thirsty.

419
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,607
Peace offering?

420
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,047
Is that freshly squeezed?

421
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,885
I don't think so.

422
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:55,738
Well, then,
the war must go on.

423
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,221
This car's been
broken for a while.

424
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:18,594
Not broken.

425
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,464
Sleeping.

426
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:26,702
So you're trying
to wake it up or something?

427
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:37,813
- Trying.
- Maybe it wants to sleep.

428
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,589
If you never try,
you'll never know.

429
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,140
Can I help?

430
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:09,078
Are you a girl
that likes to get dirty?

431
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,381
Excuse me?

432
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,531
Gloves.

433
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,395
So I haven't
seen you at
school yet.

434
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:05,634
- Yeah, I haven't
been going.
- Why?

435
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:09,471
I guess I wasn't
quite ready for
the world yet.

436
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:12,308
Is everything okay?

437
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,681
I don't know.

438
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,176
Like that car out there?

439
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:50,112
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

440
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:52,948
Where'd you learn
how to fix cars?

441
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,851
My mom's car would break down
all the time,

442
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:58,187
and she didn't have money
to pay someone to fix it,

443
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:01,090
so someone had
to learn how to.

444
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,662
What?

445
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:09,665
Can I show you something?

446
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:11,734
What?

447
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:29,118
Look at this.

448
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,453
Who's this?

449
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:33,889
- Hey, that's the car.
- That's your grandfather.

450
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,897
He looks just like me.

451
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:46,368
I think it's you
that looks just like him.

452
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,375
I'm named after him.

453
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:58,313
I never knew that.

454
00:56:58,315 --> 00:57:00,783
There's a lot you and i
don't know about each other.

455
00:57:00,785 --> 00:57:03,619
Your grandfather
loved that car.

456
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:06,455
I think that's why
you love it.

457
00:57:06,457 --> 00:57:08,624
I want you
to have it.

458
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:11,260
- The picture?
- The car.

459
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,396
- Really?
- On one condition.

460
00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:18,734
That you go back to school
and catch up on your studies.

461
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,703
Okay.

462
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,708
Can I keep this, too?

463
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,710
Sure.

464
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,684
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

465
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,591
I'm gonna try
to be better.

466
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,869
I wanna be better.

467
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,973
I know.

468
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:12,281
?

469
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:31,366
?

470
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:50,185
?

471
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:13,108
?

472
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:20,215
So things gettin'
better now?

473
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:22,351
Well, I'm glad that
it happened,

474
01:00:22,353 --> 01:00:24,486
but now that
it has happened,

475
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:26,521
sometimes I feel
more hopeless than
when it hadn't.

476
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:28,824
Am I really all he needs,
is he what I need?

477
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:31,560
You know, you've been
so set in your ways,
livin' your life,

478
01:00:31,562 --> 01:00:34,062
this boy comes along,
you don't know what to do.

479
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:36,264
I want it to be
better for him.

480
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:38,800
I see him starting
to be better, it makes
me wanna be better.

481
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,637
I haven't felt
so alive in years.

482
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:43,538
I just can't help
but wonder where
it's going from here.

483
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,441
So hard to live
in the moment.

484
01:00:46,443 --> 01:00:48,777
- Is it too late?
- For what?

485
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:50,779
As long as you got
life in you.

486
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:53,281
- I've made so many mistakes.
- No, now, wallace,

487
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:56,284
you made one big mistake,
and you've let it run
your life ever since.

488
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:59,121
I was so wrong
about emilia,

489
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:00,856
but I loved her so much,
I couldn't let her go.

490
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:03,458
But there's nothing
wrong with that, honey.

491
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:06,294
Oh, shirley, I wish
I could believe you.

492
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:08,430
You know what?

493
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:11,266
That boy's gonna change you
in ways you don't even know.

494
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:13,502
I think he
already has.

495
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,175
Can I tell you something?

496
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:24,012
You deserve
to be happy.

497
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:28,216
Wallace, it has just broken
my heart to watch what
you've put yourself through.

498
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:31,553
But now, I know
what it was for.

499
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:34,356
It was for this moment
right here.

500
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,394
This moment right here.

501
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,698
Thank you.

502
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,670
[Shirley laughing]

503
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:06,955
oh, I'm sorry.

504
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:10,025
I didn't know
you were here.

505
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:13,261
Um, I shouldn't have...
I shouldn't have done
anything.

506
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:15,363
I'm really sorry.

507
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,001
Could you do
something for me?

508
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:21,937
- What?
- Come here.

509
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:25,240
Okay.

510
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:30,445
Could you tell me
about her?

511
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:33,215
- About mom?
- Yeah.

512
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:35,283
What was she like?

513
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,024
I don't know...

514
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:45,460
She used to always dream
about going to new york

515
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:47,763
and seeing
the statue of liberty.

516
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:49,765
Please do not remind me
of that trip.

517
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:52,434
- She went?
- Yeah, we both went.

518
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:55,771
We stayed at her friend's
studio for a week.

519
01:02:55,773 --> 01:03:00,542
All four of us...
It wasn't the best
of experiences.

520
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:03,879
But me and mom
were really close.

521
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:06,114
We told each other
everything.

522
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,049
She was one of
my best friends.

523
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:11,887
My only best friend;
we moved around a lot.

524
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:15,757
I even tried to set her up
with a few of my friends'
single dads.

525
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:19,027
She started dating
one of them, and I realized

526
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:21,229
it wasn't
such a good idea.

527
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,369
Let me show you something.

528
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:35,277
This is a picture
your grandfather
took of me in paris.

529
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:37,179
Wow.

530
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:39,781
Your mother used to love
to look through these pictures.

531
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:43,385
She'd always say she was
gonna visit all these places.

532
01:03:43,387 --> 01:03:45,287
Really?

533
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:47,956
All of her favorite stories
were of me and your grandfather.

534
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:51,026
She couldn't sleep at night
without a story.

535
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,097
Why'd she leave?

536
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,934
Well, your mother
was very ambitious.

537
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:02,470
She had a long list
of things she wanted
to do in her life.

538
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:04,806
Like what?

539
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:08,510
Like ride something
bigger than a horse.

540
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:11,179
Travel around the world,
write a book.

541
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,381
After graduation,
she wanted to
go to college,

542
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:15,884
and god bless her,
she got in.

543
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:18,153
She wanted to
study abroad.

544
01:04:18,155 --> 01:04:20,121
What did she
wanna study?

545
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:22,157
She didn't know.
She just wanted
to get outta here.

546
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,259
Out of colorado.

547
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:26,494
That was at the top
of her list, to get
as far away

548
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:28,563
as she could from here.

549
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:35,804
You know,
she never finished school.

550
01:04:35,806 --> 01:04:38,940
- She didn't?
- No.

551
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:42,611
Because of me, she didn't
do half the things that
you just said.

552
01:04:42,613 --> 01:04:45,614
- It's not your fault.
- Then whose is it?

553
01:04:45,616 --> 01:04:47,682
Aldo.

554
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:59,594
I'm just tired.

555
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:17,105
Hey.

556
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:20,575
Hi.

557
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:27,182
Writing your book?

558
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:31,019
More like thoughts
rather than a book.

559
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:36,491
Whatcha thinkin' about?

560
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:39,794
If I told you,
they wouldn't be thoughts,

561
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:41,796
but something I said,

562
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:43,932
which would make it
a quote,

563
01:06:43,934 --> 01:06:46,368
and I'm not
writing quotes, so...

564
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:49,337
But you're writing it down.

565
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:53,308
But I'm the only one
readin"em,

566
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:55,543
so they still stay
my thoughts.

567
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:02,350
You write about me?

568
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:10,225
- Wouldn't you
like to know?
- I would.

569
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:18,266
I would.

570
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,440
Okay, but if I read
you something,

571
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:27,609
you gotta promise
not to laugh.

572
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:30,278
- What if it's funny?
- No, you gotta promise.

573
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,680
- No laughing.
- Scout's honor.

574
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:35,283
Isn't that only valid
if you're actually a scout?

575
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:38,520
I was for,
like, 15 days,
but who's counting?

576
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:42,323
Okay.

577
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:52,000
"In jersey,

578
01:07:52,002 --> 01:07:54,402
I'd never find this."

579
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:04,245
See, I first wrote this
because...

580
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:07,148
I so badly wanted
to take back how
I treated you.

581
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,924
"Be nice to her.

582
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:18,660
"Because to wake up
and see her

583
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:21,062
there's nothing better."

584
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,709
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't
have done that.

585
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,980
Wait.

586
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:57,098
Well, can I hear
some more?

587
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,000
No.

588
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,972
But can i
see you again?

589
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:06,407
No.

590
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,590
You're glowing.

591
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:28,997
- I am?
- She's a nice girl.

592
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:33,868
- Who?
- Madalyn.

593
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,840
- Yeah, she's pretty cool.
- Just cool?

594
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:41,342
Come on, grandma, what--

595
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:45,980
ooh, grandma.
I like it.

596
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,817
Yeah. Me, too.

597
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,823
What's the rush?

598
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,929
Gotta get some sleep.
Madalyn wants to go
horseback riding tomorrow.

599
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:03,598
Do you know how
to ride a horse?

600
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,767
No, but how hard
can it be?

601
01:10:05,769 --> 01:10:08,436
- Hey, aldo?
- Yeah?

602
01:10:08,438 --> 01:10:11,005
You okay now?

603
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:18,213
No, but for once,
I know I will be.

604
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:40,201
First time really?

605
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:42,670
There's more to this city boy
than you think.

606
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:54,315
Yeah, I'm beginning
to see that.

607
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:03,758
Hey, you hungry?

608
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,927
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

609
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:18,106
This is actually
pretty good.

610
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:24,646
Good to know, 'cause
it's about the only
thing I make good.

611
01:11:24,648 --> 01:11:28,549
I'll have you know I'm actually
a wolfgang puck in the making.

612
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,987
He's a famous chef.

613
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:36,858
Yeah, I knew that.

614
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:39,494
Yeah.

615
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:44,866
What's the city like?

616
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:48,670
You've never left
this place?

617
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:51,572
No.

618
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:55,443
Everyone who lives here
is practically born
and raised here,

619
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:57,912
just like their parents.

620
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:04,819
Well, it's loud,
for one.

621
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:08,589
Unlike this place.

622
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:10,758
And it's definitely
not like this

623
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,995
when you're sittin' behind
a red light in traffic.

624
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:19,434
- Where are you from?
- Trenton.

625
01:12:19,436 --> 01:12:22,570
It's in new joisey.

626
01:12:22,572 --> 01:12:24,572
I know a trenton.

627
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:25,773
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

628
01:12:25,775 --> 01:12:29,177
I'm sure there's
no relation.

629
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:35,917
My dad lives
in california.

630
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:47,995
Your dad lives
in california?

631
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:50,198
Mm-hmm.

632
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:54,302
Him and my mom
got a divorce
about three years ago.

633
01:12:54,304 --> 01:12:57,138
I mean, they fought
all the time.

634
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,783
You never told me that.

635
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:11,586
Aldo, it's not a big deal.

636
01:13:11,588 --> 01:13:14,655
That's everyone's story.

637
01:13:14,657 --> 01:13:17,258
Who cares? You just...

638
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:21,329
Have to deal with it
the best way you can.

639
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:26,501
There are no victims
in life.

640
01:13:26,503 --> 01:13:29,337
Life happens to us all.

641
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,610
When your father left,

642
01:13:35,612 --> 01:13:37,845
how did it feel?

643
01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:40,415
Good.

644
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:42,917
[Chuckles]

645
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:45,153
seriously.

646
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:59,133
I hated him so much.

647
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:04,472
I hated him so much
for taking the easy way out.

648
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:08,476
And I hated my mom
for letting him.

649
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:18,753
You asked me
why I was here.

650
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:24,492
I'm here because
I was in a car
accident with my mom.

651
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:29,330
I wish god had
taken me, but he didn't.

652
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,339
It gets better.

653
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:42,643
- When?
- I don't know,
but it does.

654
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,884
Come on.
Day's not over yet.

655
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:17,011
This is beautiful.

656
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,481
Nothin' like this
in the city?

657
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:25,386
One can only wish.

658
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:31,759
I used to come here a lot.

659
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:34,462
Not anymore.

660
01:15:34,464 --> 01:15:37,798
Not for a long time now.

661
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,634
Why?

662
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:44,672
This is my dad's
favorite spot.

663
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:50,811
I used to come here
after he left.

664
01:15:50,813 --> 01:15:54,715
It sucks losing someone
that you can't replace.

665
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:59,754
You still have
the memory, though.

666
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:03,858
And when I think about it,

667
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:07,995
I feel it.

668
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:14,468
And it's as though
the memory was
never lost at all.

669
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,684
So it's okay to be happy.

670
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:43,965
You'll never forget her.

671
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,869
It's like breathing.

672
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:06,354
Hey.

673
01:17:06,356 --> 01:17:08,823
Hi. Always writing, huh?

674
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:13,394
Got a lot to say.

675
01:17:13,396 --> 01:17:16,631
I, uh,

676
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:18,966
I wanted to give you this.

677
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,635
What is it?

678
01:17:20,637 --> 01:17:24,505
It's a letter that
I never mailed.

679
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:30,645
- It's to mom.
- Open it.

680
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:37,918
What does it say?

681
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,154
[Laughs]

682
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:43,024
I wish my memory
were that good.

683
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:47,395
Why didn't
you send it?

684
01:17:47,397 --> 01:17:49,397
Oh, I don't know.

685
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:52,533
So many reasons.
I'm sure they were
all stupid.

686
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:02,677
- You read it.
- Okay.

687
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,981
Okay.

688
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:21,062
"Dear emilia,

689
01:18:21,064 --> 01:18:25,266
"I've spent the past months
looking around this empty house,

690
01:18:25,268 --> 01:18:29,537
"and staring back at me
is nothing but an empty feeling.

691
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:36,077
"And now I fear
there's no changing that.

692
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:38,779
"How did we get here?

693
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:41,816
"I ask myself that
so many times.

694
01:18:41,818 --> 01:18:44,819
"I love you, honey,

695
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:50,191
"and I was afraid for you.

696
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:57,398
"The world is not
what pictures
paint it to be.

697
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:01,702
"I never wanted you to
miss out on everything
you were made for.

698
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:10,444
"But I realize now
what you were made for

699
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:12,847
"is more than what
was around you.

700
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:19,620
"I'm sorry, emilia.

701
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:24,225
"If I could have
another chance

702
01:19:24,227 --> 01:19:27,094
"to tell you
what I should've said

703
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:30,297
"when you asked to leave,
I would say,

704
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:35,803
"'don't miss out on
everything that's out there.

705
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:38,906
"'Until you spread your wings,

706
01:19:38,908 --> 01:19:43,644
you'll have no idea...'"

707
01:19:43,646 --> 01:19:46,480
[Laughs]

708
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:48,816
"how far you can fly.'

709
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:56,791
"Love, mom."

710
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,603
She would've
loved that.

711
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:11,739
You should have
sent it.

712
01:20:11,741 --> 01:20:15,376
Oh, there's a lot of
things I should've done.

713
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:22,550
If you could,

714
01:20:22,552 --> 01:20:25,719
would you take
everything and change it?

715
01:20:25,721 --> 01:20:27,988
Of course I would.

716
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:31,058
Then that's
all that matters.

717
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:36,497
I guess we both
have to learn that.

718
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:43,003
And just live
a little more,
bit by bit each day.

719
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:49,310
I would do anything
to bring her back,

720
01:20:49,312 --> 01:20:51,979
but I can't.

721
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:57,351
And neither can you.

722
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:02,990
When did you get so wise?

723
01:21:02,992 --> 01:21:05,526
I don't know.

724
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:10,030
I guess I'm just
ready to start
living again.

725
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,602
But I want you
to live with me.

726
01:21:14,604 --> 01:21:17,771
- Me?
- Yes.

727
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:20,841
Okay?

728
01:21:20,843 --> 01:21:23,077
Okay.

729
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:26,046
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

730
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:55,576
?

731
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:19,800
?

732
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:36,617
?

733
01:22:54,069 --> 01:23:01,075
?

734
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:21,628
?

735
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:48,288
?

736
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:50,824
Give it gas,
give it gas.

737
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:52,960
Keep pushing.
I got this.

738
01:23:52,962 --> 01:23:54,962
Go, go, go!

739
01:23:54,964 --> 01:23:57,064
Yes!

740
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:01,802
Wait!

741
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,318
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

742
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,448
Wow.

743
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:57,024
No way.

744
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:03,597
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

745
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:07,034
I was something
to marvel at, wasn't ' i?

746
01:25:08,903 --> 01:25:11,071
That was
back in the day.

747
01:25:11,073 --> 01:25:14,808
I used to dance
and be wild and free.

748
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,980
That was a long time ago.

749
01:25:19,982 --> 01:25:24,218
Things have changed a bit.

750
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:34,161
- Did you hear that?
- What?

751
01:25:34,163 --> 01:25:37,698
- The music.
- What music?

752
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:42,302
Take my hand.

753
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:50,611
- May I have
this dance?
- Yes.

754
01:25:50,613 --> 01:25:53,881
One, two, one, two.

755
01:25:53,883 --> 01:25:56,250
One, two.

756
01:25:56,252 --> 01:26:00,154
Oh, wow!
All right, all right.

757
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:08,295
?

758
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:13,066
Uh-oh.
Still got it.

759
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:21,775
? I found my face
in a photograph?

760
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:30,384
? I lost my words
in a paper bag?

761
01:26:30,386 --> 01:26:37,424
? I caught my tears
the last time it rained?

762
01:26:37,426 --> 01:26:42,663
? Sometimes I think
we're all the same?

763
01:26:44,566 --> 01:26:51,238
? I heard your laugh
from across the room?

764
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:58,879
? I've held your hand
underneath the moon?

765
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:05,219
? I felt your love
when you looked at me?

766
01:27:05,221 --> 01:27:07,287
? Seein' myself...

767
01:27:07,289 --> 01:27:09,723
- No peeking.
- What is all this?

768
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,658
All right,
my eyes are closed.

769
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,594
- Really?
- I promise.

770
01:27:13,596 --> 01:27:15,562
What is going on?

771
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,031
- All right.
- Okay?

772
01:27:18,033 --> 01:27:20,367
Surprise!
Yeah!

773
01:27:20,369 --> 01:27:23,036
- Make a wish.
- Make a wish.

774
01:27:23,038 --> 01:27:25,372
Blah, blah, blah,
make a wish.

775
01:27:25,374 --> 01:27:28,008
- Should we all
make a wish?
- Should we?

776
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:31,378
Thank you guys so much.

777
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,714
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.
Do you want a piece?

778
01:27:33,716 --> 01:27:36,049
- Yes.
- Yeah, really,
you want a piece?

779
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:39,953
Oh, my god.
Are you serious? Okay.

780
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:52,232
?

781
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:06,713
?

782
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:20,727
?

783
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:18,218
Wow!

784
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:20,387
Is it too much?

785
01:29:20,389 --> 01:29:23,357
No. Not at all.

786
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:32,032
Come on.

Aldo, hurry up.
We're gonna be late.

801
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:57,237
- Do you have
everything?
- Yeah.

802
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,139
All right, mom,
let's go, go, go.

803
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:15,221
Been thinkin'.

804
01:33:15,223 --> 01:33:17,924
About what?

805
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:20,860
About us.

806
01:33:20,862 --> 01:33:24,397
Life after summer.

807
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:27,133
College.

808
01:33:27,135 --> 01:33:31,204
Do you wanna go?

809
01:33:31,206 --> 01:33:34,941
- Where?
- To college.

810
01:33:36,544 --> 01:33:41,214
Do you? I think I wanna
stay here, ya know?

811
01:33:41,216 --> 01:33:45,785
You're here,
grandma's here.

812
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:51,958
I just finally feel
like I'm gettin'
my head on straight.

813
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:59,332
- Is that bad?
- No. Not at all.

814
01:34:03,871 --> 01:34:06,539
We could take
a year off,

815
01:34:06,541 --> 01:34:09,376
and then apply
to colleges.

816
01:34:09,378 --> 01:34:14,247
Colleges? Isn't there
only like, one
college in the state?

817
01:34:14,249 --> 01:34:16,916
First of all, no.

818
01:34:16,918 --> 01:34:21,855
And who says
we have to stay here?

819
01:34:34,635 --> 01:34:37,904
You'd leave here?

820
01:34:37,906 --> 01:34:39,506
Yeah.

821
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:44,044
I mean, maybe.

822
01:34:44,046 --> 01:34:47,514
I don't know.
I've never had
to think about it.

823
01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:55,355
If someone would've
told me a year ago

824
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:57,857
- that life
could be so--
- unexpected?

825
01:34:57,859 --> 01:35:02,128
- I told you.
- How it wouldn't
hurt so much.

826
01:35:04,765 --> 01:35:07,867
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to bring up
any kind of memories.

827
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:10,003
No, no, no.

828
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:14,007
I'm just so happy
for once.

829
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:19,446
Good.

830
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:24,250
She would've
loved you.

831
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:29,923
I love you.

832
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:06,526
Wait.

833
01:36:06,528 --> 01:36:09,129
Um...

834
01:36:09,131 --> 01:36:11,831
I... I might
be bad at it.

835
01:38:43,684 --> 01:38:46,286
How was it?

836
01:38:46,288 --> 01:38:50,023
Perfect.

837
01:38:50,025 --> 01:38:53,092
Really?

838
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:57,297
- Was it for you?
- Yeah.

839
01:38:57,299 --> 01:39:00,199
Yeah, yeah, of course.

840
01:39:00,201 --> 01:39:04,837
I just wasn't sure
if it was what you
were expecting.

841
01:39:04,839 --> 01:39:09,542
- I just expected it
to be with you.
- That's great.

842
01:39:09,544 --> 01:39:14,514
- I was just expecting you
to say something else.
- Like what?

843
01:39:17,584 --> 01:39:19,852
I don't know.

844
01:39:19,854 --> 01:39:24,190
Maybe you'd say
it wasn't what
you were expecting.

845
01:39:24,192 --> 01:39:27,226
Then I'd say I didn't
have that much experience,

846
01:39:27,228 --> 01:39:30,029
and that it was,
like, my first time.

847
01:39:30,031 --> 01:39:33,866
- It was your first time?
- No, no--

848
01:39:33,868 --> 01:39:36,703
- I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
- Shut up.

849
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:47,347
I love you.

850
01:40:01,128 --> 01:40:04,130
I can't get
enough of you.

851
01:40:06,433 --> 01:40:08,134
You make me feel like...

852
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:11,637
Like everything's
gonna be okay.

853
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:15,908
As long as
we're together.

854
01:40:17,211 --> 01:40:19,746
Everything will just
be good, ya know?

855
01:40:25,052 --> 01:40:26,919
Just good?

856
01:40:28,722 --> 01:40:30,523
Great.

857
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:04,524
I love your eyes.

858
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,628
What's so special
about my eyes?

859
01:41:16,336 --> 01:41:20,139
You have no idea
how they say so much
about you.

860
01:41:24,445 --> 01:41:26,512
Like what?

861
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:32,418
How you feel broken.

862
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:38,357
As if...

863
01:41:38,359 --> 01:41:41,194
You're never
gonna heal.

864
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:51,170
But something in
your eyes shows hope.

865
01:42:00,514 --> 01:42:02,748
So it's that obvious.

866
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:07,253
To me, it is,
because I see you now.

867
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:12,859
More than I think
others do.

868
01:42:18,332 --> 01:42:20,833
I love you so much.

869
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:37,517
It's late.
I should
head home.

870
01:42:37,519 --> 01:42:40,286
Right now?

871
01:42:40,288 --> 01:42:43,256
Oh, come on.

872
01:42:43,258 --> 01:42:46,225
Don't you wanna stay
just for a little longer?

873
01:42:46,227 --> 01:42:49,061
Please?

874
01:43:30,003 --> 01:43:33,639
- What's that for?
- I don't know.

875
01:44:21,521 --> 01:44:23,689
That boy.

876
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:27,493
Can I help you
find something?

877
01:44:27,495 --> 01:44:31,097
Aldo! Can I help you?

878
01:44:31,099 --> 01:44:33,933
- Mrs. Russo?
- Yes. Can I help you?

879
01:44:37,704 --> 01:44:40,573
Mrs. Russo, can i
speak with you for
just a minute?

880
01:44:40,575 --> 01:44:42,675
About what?

881
01:44:42,677 --> 01:44:46,045
- Just with you, ma'am.
- Aldo, go inside.

882
01:44:46,047 --> 01:44:48,914
- Why?
- Just go inside.

883
01:46:51,171 --> 01:46:53,272
What happened?

884
01:46:54,274 --> 01:46:57,109
- What happened?
- Sit down.

885
01:46:57,111 --> 01:46:59,378
Come on,
someone say something!

886
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:01,514
- Sit down.
- I don't wanna sit down.

887
01:47:01,516 --> 01:47:03,349
Aldo, sit down!

888
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:10,322
Grandma, you okay?

889
01:47:10,324 --> 01:47:13,325
Tell me. What is it?

890
01:47:15,996 --> 01:47:18,097
What happened?

891
01:47:19,332 --> 01:47:21,901
What happened?

892
01:47:23,503 --> 01:47:26,005
Hey. Hey.

893
01:47:29,576 --> 01:47:32,278
I wanted to
talk to you.

894
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:43,656
My name is david warwick,
and, uh...

895
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:50,763
How do I even say it?

896
01:47:54,601 --> 01:47:57,803
You're my son.

897
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:07,880
I just thought that
if I could see you
and explain...

898
01:48:07,882 --> 01:48:10,249
Explain what?

899
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:18,691
- Did you know
about this?
- No.

900
01:48:18,693 --> 01:48:20,593
Son...

901
01:48:20,595 --> 01:48:23,829
Don't you dare call me that,
don't you dare call me that.

902
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:28,501
Hey, I know you must
think that I'm--

903
01:48:28,503 --> 01:48:30,669
that you're a lowlife?

904
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:33,172
- A good-for-nothing
piece of shit?
- Aldo!

905
01:48:33,174 --> 01:48:36,442
- You do not understand.
- Oh, please, help me.

906
01:48:36,444 --> 01:48:39,645
I don't expect
anything from you.

907
01:48:39,647 --> 01:48:43,249
I won't let you
do this to me.

908
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:51,390
I can't stand
the sight of you.

909
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:56,629
You left me and my mom.

910
01:48:59,065 --> 01:49:02,601
And now... And now,
you wanna come back?

911
01:49:02,603 --> 01:49:05,838
You're right not to
expect anything from me.

912
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,774
I grew up just fine!

913
01:49:08,776 --> 01:49:11,410
You are not missed,
so you can leave!

914
01:49:11,412 --> 01:49:13,712
Leave!!

915
01:49:13,714 --> 01:49:15,681
Listen, if you just
let me explain, I swear,
I will leave.

916
01:49:15,683 --> 01:49:20,419
- Fine. I'll leave!
- No, aldo. Aldo!

917
01:49:20,421 --> 01:49:23,389
Aldo. Aldo!

918
01:49:32,198 --> 01:49:34,433
I'm sorry.

919
01:49:34,435 --> 01:49:37,503
I, uh, just thought
if I could see him,

920
01:49:37,505 --> 01:49:40,673
I'd be okay again.

921
01:49:40,675 --> 01:49:44,977
I didn't think about
how he'd be, or what
he's been through.

922
01:49:55,822 --> 01:49:58,257
I'll be staying
here for the next
couple of days.

923
01:49:58,259 --> 01:50:01,460
If he comes around,
I'd love to
talk to him.

924
01:50:02,495 --> 01:50:04,763
Sorry, ma'am.

925
01:51:53,506 --> 01:51:57,309
I wish I could
just be someone else,

926
01:51:57,311 --> 01:52:01,880
someone better off than me.

927
01:52:01,882 --> 01:52:05,584
- Different person,
different problems.
- But still problems.

928
01:52:11,157 --> 01:52:14,326
What'd she tell you?

929
01:52:14,328 --> 01:52:16,495
Enough.

930
01:52:18,832 --> 01:52:22,234
- You didn't go home
last night.
- I couldn't.

931
01:52:25,205 --> 01:52:28,874
You know, out here,

932
01:52:28,876 --> 01:52:31,076
everything in itself
is so simple and perfect

933
01:52:31,078 --> 01:52:33,345
and I just thought
that maybe--

934
01:52:33,347 --> 01:52:35,914
why are you doing
this to yourself?

935
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:37,983
Doing what?

936
01:52:37,985 --> 01:52:40,586
Letting it
affect you like this.

937
01:52:40,588 --> 01:52:44,990
It was all right before.
It'll be all right again.

938
01:52:44,992 --> 01:52:48,026
- Talk to him.
- About what?

939
01:52:48,028 --> 01:52:51,663
Something. Say anything
until you say what
you need to say.

940
01:52:51,665 --> 01:52:54,399
I have nothing
I need to say to him.

941
01:52:57,570 --> 01:53:00,973
You will relive this
for the rest of your life

942
01:53:00,975 --> 01:53:04,643
wishing you had said
too much instead of
nothing at all.

943
01:53:04,645 --> 01:53:08,280
You'll find that
it's easier said than done.

944
01:53:12,185 --> 01:53:15,254
Didn't you tell me that
I needed to move on from this?

945
01:53:15,256 --> 01:53:17,589
Well, I moved on
from this years ago.

946
01:53:17,591 --> 01:53:19,458
This is different.

947
01:53:26,599 --> 01:53:28,901
I've already
made up my mind.

948
01:53:31,204 --> 01:53:33,539
I'm leaving
after the summer.

949
01:53:43,716 --> 01:53:45,884
Leaving?

950
01:53:49,756 --> 01:53:51,990
College.

951
01:53:51,992 --> 01:53:55,627
T.C.N.J. In jersey.

952
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:59,965
What?

953
01:53:59,967 --> 01:54:02,367
You applied to college?

954
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:29,895
It's not like that.
I wasn't gonna go.

955
01:54:29,897 --> 01:54:32,798
I just wanted to see
if I could get in.

956
01:54:35,835 --> 01:54:40,072
I thought we agreed
to take a year off.

957
01:54:40,074 --> 01:54:43,375
Apply together.

958
01:54:47,313 --> 01:54:50,082
Madalyn, I wasn't
going to go.

959
01:54:50,084 --> 01:54:54,119
Were you gonna tell me
when your bags were packed?

960
01:54:55,154 --> 01:54:57,823
No.

961
01:54:57,825 --> 01:55:00,325
No, i...

962
01:55:00,327 --> 01:55:03,462
I just think that now,
it might be best,

963
01:55:03,464 --> 01:55:07,299
so I don't find myself needing
to rely on anyone but myself.

964
01:55:07,301 --> 01:55:09,635
Myself.

965
01:55:09,637 --> 01:55:13,138
It is so sad to see
how easy it is

966
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:16,375
for you to think
about yourself.

967
01:55:19,712 --> 01:55:22,915
You can run
as much as you want,

968
01:55:22,917 --> 01:55:27,185
you... You coward!

969
01:55:27,187 --> 01:55:30,722
- Madalyn, it--
- no, I can't...

970
01:55:30,724 --> 01:55:34,059
Unfeel the way I feel
for you just because

971
01:55:34,061 --> 01:55:36,395
you don't need me to.

972
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:45,037
But, one day,

973
01:55:45,039 --> 01:55:47,773
you are gonna wake up.

974
01:55:48,975 --> 01:55:52,210
You are going
to wake up!

975
01:55:55,148 --> 01:55:59,318
And realize you could've
been something better.

976
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:10,996
Look, every word
I said, I meant.

977
01:56:10,998 --> 01:56:13,332
I meant every word.

978
01:56:13,334 --> 01:56:15,801
Oh, god.

979
01:56:24,477 --> 01:56:27,546
I let you get
the best of me.

980
01:56:29,515 --> 01:56:32,384
But...

981
01:56:32,386 --> 01:56:36,955
It is obvious that
what we have is not
the real thing.

982
01:56:39,025 --> 01:56:41,860
Hey. Hey, hey.

983
01:56:41,862 --> 01:56:44,796
- How can you
say that?
- Oh...

984
01:56:44,798 --> 01:56:47,532
How can you say that?!

985
01:56:58,745 --> 01:57:01,646
Would you come with me?

986
01:57:03,383 --> 01:57:06,418
Oh, and do what?

987
01:57:10,423 --> 01:57:12,724
We'll figure it out.

988
01:57:12,726 --> 01:57:15,127
Oh, that's
a great idea, aldo.

989
01:57:16,963 --> 01:57:19,898
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

990
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:23,368
Stop saying that!

991
01:57:35,014 --> 01:57:37,416
Please.

992
01:57:37,418 --> 01:57:40,052
- I'm sorry.
- Stop.

993
01:57:46,359 --> 01:57:49,861
I still feel like
this is where I need to be.

994
01:57:51,564 --> 01:57:54,299
Even if you don't.

995
01:57:56,502 --> 01:58:00,038
You can leave here
just the way you came.

996
01:58:01,207 --> 01:58:03,141
Madalyn!

997
01:58:03,143 --> 01:58:05,844
You should talk to
your father

998
01:58:05,846 --> 01:58:10,148
before you have nobody
but yourself left to lie to.

999
01:58:52,859 --> 01:58:55,026
Aldo?

1000
01:58:57,130 --> 01:59:00,198
Where have you been?

1001
01:59:01,734 --> 01:59:04,169
I'm sorry if
I scared you.

1002
01:59:04,171 --> 01:59:07,806
I just needed
some time to think.

1003
01:59:07,808 --> 01:59:13,445
It felt like everything
was just crashing down
around me.

1004
01:59:14,714 --> 01:59:16,581
Talk to me.

1005
01:59:17,984 --> 01:59:20,886
- About what?
- About your father.

1006
01:59:20,888 --> 01:59:23,221
My father?

1007
01:59:26,826 --> 01:59:29,528
I don't even
know the guy.

1008
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:32,230
Don't you wanna
know why?

1009
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:37,702
- Aren't you pissed?
- Why?

1010
01:59:37,704 --> 01:59:40,372
He just shows up
out of nowhere.

1011
01:59:40,374 --> 01:59:42,741
No warning,
no phone call.

1012
01:59:42,743 --> 01:59:46,044
That makes him and you
more alike than you think.

1013
01:59:47,313 --> 01:59:50,115
You should talk to him.

1014
01:59:58,157 --> 02:00:01,960
I'm here for you,
whatever you decide.

1015
02:02:27,473 --> 02:02:30,875
You want anything to drink?

1016
02:02:30,877 --> 02:02:35,380
Yeah, I could use
something to drink. Thanks.

1017
02:02:39,885 --> 02:02:42,454
It's a little warm.

1018
02:02:42,456 --> 02:02:44,422
It's from earlier.

1019
02:02:45,658 --> 02:02:47,692
It's fine.

1020
02:02:47,694 --> 02:02:50,395
Thanks.

1021
02:03:01,474 --> 02:03:03,842
I didn't think
you'd come.

1022
02:03:03,844 --> 02:03:06,444
To think all I could say,
all I would say...

1023
02:03:06,446 --> 02:03:08,546
You know, I never knew.

1024
02:03:09,615 --> 02:03:12,083
Knew what?

1025
02:03:17,156 --> 02:03:19,457
About you.

1026
02:03:22,795 --> 02:03:25,897
Yeah. I, uh...

1027
02:03:27,633 --> 02:03:30,969
I dated your mom...

1028
02:03:30,971 --> 02:03:33,705
When she was a freshman
at perdue,

1029
02:03:33,707 --> 02:03:37,342
and I was a senior
in high school,

1030
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:40,945
till one day,
she just up and left.

1031
02:03:43,382 --> 02:03:46,017
Now I know why.

1032
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:50,221
Why now?

1033
02:03:57,062 --> 02:03:59,264
I don't know.

1034
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:07,572
They called
over a year ago.

1035
02:04:09,308 --> 02:04:11,509
Left a voicemail.

1036
02:04:13,212 --> 02:04:15,947
By the time I got
the courage to call back,

1037
02:04:15,949 --> 02:04:18,049
months had already passed.

1038
02:04:20,953 --> 02:04:25,190
To find out
you have a son, overnight...

1039
02:04:27,793 --> 02:04:30,528
I can't tell you
how that felt.

1040
02:04:32,565 --> 02:04:35,266
Why didn't she tell me?

1041
02:04:36,869 --> 02:04:39,804
Did she think I wouldn't
be a good father?

1042
02:04:42,341 --> 02:04:46,878
I would've loved you
the best I could.

1043
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:49,347
I deserve that.

1044
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:54,853
That was just
taken away from me.

1045
02:05:04,296 --> 02:05:06,231
You have a family now?

1046
02:05:06,233 --> 02:05:10,869
Yeah.
Three girls.

1047
02:05:12,271 --> 02:05:15,840
Six, ten, and, uh... 14.

1048
02:05:18,878 --> 02:05:21,546
- No mom?
- No.

1049
02:05:21,548 --> 02:05:26,017
She left me and the girls
a short time after
emily was born.

1050
02:05:26,019 --> 02:05:28,786
I was never the best man
for her,

1051
02:05:28,788 --> 02:05:32,557
but she always seemed to
give me another try.

1052
02:05:32,559 --> 02:05:34,959
Emily.

1053
02:05:34,961 --> 02:05:39,130
Yeah, emily's the youngest,
and sasha's the middle,

1054
02:05:39,132 --> 02:05:42,166
and then, savannah...

1055
02:05:42,168 --> 02:05:44,435
God, I tell you,

1056
02:05:44,437 --> 02:05:48,006
you look exactly how
I thought you'd look.

1057
02:05:49,141 --> 02:05:51,276
What did you expect?

1058
02:05:51,278 --> 02:05:55,547
You look like her.
Emilia.

1059
02:06:03,455 --> 02:06:05,189
I'm sorry.

1060
02:06:06,292 --> 02:06:08,092
Sorry.

1061
02:06:14,967 --> 02:06:17,769
Ya know...

1062
02:06:17,771 --> 02:06:22,006
I really could've
used a father after
what happened.

1063
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:30,114
You know, I just...

1064
02:06:30,116 --> 02:06:33,952
I wondered if I'd
make things worse.

1065
02:06:36,488 --> 02:06:39,524
Hell, you'd just
lost your mother.

1066
02:06:39,526 --> 02:06:43,127
Would you have even
wanted me around?

1067
02:06:43,129 --> 02:06:46,097
Person you didn't
even know?

1068
02:06:48,367 --> 02:06:51,269
But when you find out
you have a son,

1069
02:06:51,271 --> 02:06:54,973
or just a child
in general,

1070
02:06:54,975 --> 02:06:58,009
it's, like,
nothing is the same.

1071
02:06:58,011 --> 02:07:00,378
I started
to search for you,

1072
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:02,647
but you had already
turned 18; c.P.S.
Had closed your file,

1073
02:07:02,649 --> 02:07:05,216
wouldn't tell me
a damn thing.

1074
02:07:05,218 --> 02:07:08,486
But I felt like
if I never tried,
I would never know.

1075
02:07:08,488 --> 02:07:11,189
- I always say that.
- Say what?

1076
02:07:11,191 --> 02:07:13,791
If you never try,
you'll never know.

1077
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:30,541
I promise you...

1078
02:07:34,113 --> 02:07:37,615
If I'd have known
she was pregnant...

1079
02:07:42,054 --> 02:07:45,189
I'd have been
a good father to you.

1080
02:07:50,062 --> 02:07:52,897
Yeah, you seem like it.

1081
02:07:56,135 --> 02:07:58,603
Thank you.

1082
02:08:09,615 --> 02:08:11,683
It's just, my life...

1083
02:08:11,685 --> 02:08:14,819
It's been so difficult
lately.

1084
02:08:14,821 --> 02:08:16,888
Every time I take
a couple of steps forward,

1085
02:08:16,890 --> 02:08:19,557
it's like something
sends me four steps back.

1086
02:08:19,559 --> 02:08:22,293
Then there's this girl,
and I didn't wanna hurt her,

1087
02:08:22,295 --> 02:08:24,929
and I just...
I really messed things up.

1088
02:08:24,931 --> 02:08:27,598
Now I don't even...

1089
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:30,468
- Sorry, never mind.
- No, no. Tell me.

1090
02:08:30,470 --> 02:08:32,336
Tell me.

1091
02:08:35,774 --> 02:08:38,676
Well, I love her.

1092
02:08:38,678 --> 02:08:40,478
I think.

1093
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,814
You never been in love?

1094
02:08:42,816 --> 02:08:45,249
I don't know.
How do you know?

1095
02:08:47,519 --> 02:08:49,420
Hoo!

1096
02:08:51,990 --> 02:08:53,791
Well...

1097
02:08:58,097 --> 02:09:01,666
When you wake up
in the morning,

1098
02:09:01,668 --> 02:09:05,269
it's the first thing
that comes to mind.

1099
02:09:05,271 --> 02:09:08,539
And when they're hurting,
you somehow feel it.

1100
02:09:10,509 --> 02:09:15,346
And when they're not around,
time does move slower.

1101
02:09:16,682 --> 02:09:19,350
Yeah, I'm definitely in love.

1102
02:09:19,352 --> 02:09:22,286
What happened?

1103
02:09:29,428 --> 02:09:32,430
Me...

1104
02:09:32,432 --> 02:09:35,099
Just me, running my mouth

1105
02:09:35,101 --> 02:09:38,269
before thinking about
what I'm saying.

1106
02:09:38,271 --> 02:09:42,440
Sometimes I build myself up,
and I tear myself down

1107
02:09:42,442 --> 02:09:44,509
all at the same time.

1108
02:09:49,214 --> 02:09:52,283
I don't know
what to do.

1109
02:09:52,285 --> 02:09:55,286
I don't know
how to deal with things.

1110
02:09:55,288 --> 02:09:57,288
Yes, you do.

1111
02:09:57,290 --> 02:10:01,259
Hey, you know how to
deal with things just fine.

1112
02:10:01,261 --> 02:10:04,862
You're here, aren't you?
You're dealing with this.

1113
02:10:06,632 --> 02:10:09,967
Hell, if we were all
so well-put together,

1114
02:10:09,969 --> 02:10:13,004
what would we
experience
in life?

1115
02:10:13,006 --> 02:10:16,040
You're gonna
be okay.

1116
02:10:18,177 --> 02:10:21,412
But how do you deal
with being alone?

1117
02:10:23,348 --> 02:10:27,451
Well, you're never
really alone.

1118

You know, i...

1122
02:10:52,946 --> 02:10:55,513
It's crazy...

1123

How something can just
change your life

1124
02:11:00,353 --> 02:11:02,653
and wake you up.

1125
02:11:02,655 --> 02:11:05,523
I mean, like really
wake you up.

1126
02:11:07,993 --> 02:11:10,494
I laid in that hospital bed
for days,

1127
02:11:10,496 --> 02:11:13,831
thinking the same thing
over and over again.

1128
02:11:15,467 --> 02:11:17,702
What?

1129
02:11:19,304 --> 02:11:22,974
If you don't create change,

1130
02:11:22,976 --> 02:11:26,344
change will create you.

1131
02:11:29,181 --> 02:11:31,282
To think
it took me so long

1132
02:11:31,284 --> 02:11:34,252
to really understand
what that meant.

1133
02:11:44,796 --> 02:11:48,599
Look, um, it's getting late.
I should go.

1134
02:11:48,601 --> 02:11:51,102
Grandma likes to
wait up for some
stupid reason,

1135
02:11:51,104 --> 02:11:53,905
- and the couch is really
not that comfortable.

went to bed by now.

- I can't...
- I know.

from time to time,

1152

just to
check up on me
if you want.

1153

is just not helping us.

You remember the way?

1215
02:24:11,744 --> 02:24:15,445
Yeah, it's my third time
flying out here.
I oughta know by now.

1216
02:24:15,447 --> 02:24:17,714
[Both chuckling]

1217
02:24:19,250 --> 02:24:24,321
- you leavin' tomorrow?
- Yeah.

1218
02:24:27,725 --> 02:24:30,727
I'll call you
before then.

1219
02:24:37,402 --> 02:24:39,803
You call me if
you need anything.

1220
02:24:39,805 --> 02:24:41,938
- All right?
- Thanks.

1221
02:24:41,940 --> 02:24:44,408
Okay.

1222
02:25:19,644 --> 02:25:26,416
? Purple mountains fall on
chimneys made of gold?

1223
02:25:26,418 --> 02:25:32,255
? To keep you warm inside
but tingling for more?

1224
02:25:32,257 --> 02:25:37,561
? I see you rockin' by
the fire of your home?

1225
02:25:37,563 --> 02:25:40,130
? But you keep on fadin'

1226
02:25:45,136 --> 02:25:50,741
? The bottle's deep enough
for heaven to unfold?

1227
02:25:50,743 --> 02:25:56,646
? But from this alley hell,
it's definitely cold?

1228
02:25:58,649 --> 02:26:02,052
? Mmm, do with
what you're told?

1229
02:26:02,054 --> 02:26:04,654
? To keep from fadin'

1230
02:26:07,625 --> 02:26:10,393
? To keep from fadin'

1231
02:26:46,297 --> 02:26:48,932
hi.

1232
02:26:48,934 --> 02:26:51,301
Hi.

1233
02:26:53,237 --> 02:26:55,839
Looks like
you're going somewhere.

1234
02:26:55,841 --> 02:26:59,142
Finally moving forward.

1235
02:27:12,924 --> 02:27:15,992
I just want to say
I'm so sorry.

1236
02:27:23,267 --> 02:27:25,502
Me, too.

1237
02:27:33,411 --> 02:27:36,613
Promise me one thing.

1238
02:27:36,615 --> 02:27:39,983
You won't forget
to remember me.

1239
02:27:50,728 --> 02:27:52,696
Never.

1240
02:28:19,390 --> 02:28:21,825
Come with me.

1241
02:28:36,107 --> 02:28:39,476
Is there room for one more?

1242
02:28:41,879 --> 02:28:43,847
Yeah.

1243
02:29:00,731 --> 02:29:03,733
What will you
do out there?

1244
02:29:05,403 --> 02:29:08,004
We'll figure it out.

1245
02:29:15,713 --> 02:29:19,549
- [Door squeaks loudly]
- I like the sound of that.

1246
02:29:39,070 --> 02:29:46,076
? So shine on, little light

1247
02:29:46,078 --> 02:29:49,045
? Shine on from heaven

1248
02:29:49,047 --> 02:29:51,548
? Show me it's all right

1249
02:29:53,651 --> 02:29:56,486
? Show me it's all right

1250
02:30:00,057 --> 02:30:06,629
? Oooooooh

1251
02:30:08,299 --> 02:30:14,270
? You keep your balance
as you reach out from the dark?

1252
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:20,710
? To touch a light that's
barely bright enough for talk?

1253
02:30:20,712 --> 02:30:25,215
? And everybody knows
that tickin's just for clocks?

1254
02:30:25,217 --> 02:30:27,951
? But you keep on fadin'

1255
02:30:30,888 --> 02:30:34,124
? Yeah, you keep on
fadin'?

1256
02:30:38,229 --> 02:30:43,900
? So shine on,
little light?

1257
02:30:45,102 --> 02:30:47,771
? Shine on from heaven

1258
02:30:47,773 --> 02:30:50,140
? Show me it's all right

1259
02:30:52,309 --> 02:30:54,411
? Show me it's all right

1260
02:30:54,413 --> 02:31:00,283
? Stay strong,
my little girl?

1261
02:31:00,285 --> 02:31:02,752
? Look up to heaven

1262
02:31:02,754 --> 02:31:05,555
? They tell you
it's all right?

1263
02:31:07,391 --> 02:31:10,727
? That everything's
all right?

1264
02:31:10,729 --> 02:31:17,867
?

1265
02:31:21,105 --> 02:31:25,875
? Just lay down

1266
02:31:25,877 --> 02:31:28,578
? Little girl

1267
02:31:28,580 --> 02:31:31,548
? Eyes up to heaven

1268
02:31:31,550 --> 02:31:34,951
? They tell you
it's all right?

1269
02:31:36,987 --> 02:31:40,857
? Everything's all right
