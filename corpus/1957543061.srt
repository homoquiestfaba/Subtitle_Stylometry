- Oh, and, Lou, you probably

88
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,228
won't see that much of me.

I know that could be
a problem for you,

90
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:37,233

to see me anytime...

91
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,109

- Can I go in alone?
- Of course.

102
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:05,428
I was just gonna ask you
the same thing.

103
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,890
If I could walk in alone,
you know, for my street cred.

You may be good at football,
you may be good at track,

Terrific job today.
I love the energy.

117
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,471
I'm telling you,
if we bring that

118
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:50,973
to the Mathalon finals,
we win the...

119
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:52,934
- Oh, Esther, you got a second?
- Yeah.

120
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:54,811
How's Lou doing? She good?

121
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,270
I think so.

122
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:57,980
You know, she's great at math,
so at some point,

123
00:04:58,022 --> 00:04:59,649
I wouldn't be surprised
if she starts asking

124
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:01,067
about maybe joining
the Pi-thons.

125
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:02,777
'Cause, you know,
at her last school,

126
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,654
she made it
to the Mathalon finals.

127
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:06,531
Really?
She never mentioned that.

128
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,491
Ah, you know, that's the thing.
She's really shy.

129
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:11,035
Oh, not at all. She was
telling me about her vacation

130
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,121
and about this guy named David.

131
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:15,123
David? My ex's new husband?

132
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:17,041
- What did she say about him?
- Oh...

133
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,584
It doesn't matter. Never mind.

134
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:21,504
Actually, go ahead. Tell me.

135
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:22,964
Oh, just that he's awesome

136
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:24,924
and no matter what they do,
it's always cool

137
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:27,427
- and exciting and, you know...
- Fun.

138
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:28,803
- Yeah. (chuckles)
- Gotcha.

139
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:30,847
- All right.
- Okay. Thanks, Esther.

140
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:33,099
I guess they're going
cave diving.

141
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:36,227
- Hmm. Cave diving.
- Yeah.

142

- Where?

spying on your daughter.

- CHARLIE: We're not spying.

We're-we're just watching
from a distance.

146
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:48,072
We're not spying.

147
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,116
Look, she had a hard time
at her last school.

148
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:51,868
I just want to make sure
she's okay.

149
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,746
So, what, you thought you'd
hook her up with the cool kids?

150
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,415
CHARLIE: Parker, you're
supposed to set a good example

151
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,208
as the guidance counselor.

152
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,920
I am setting the best example
with my look and my vibe alone.

153
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,466
Jesus, kids still do the robot?

154
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:08,217
(ringtone playing):
♪ Marry me, marry me, say... ♪

155
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,595
- Is that a "Marry Me" ringtone?
- Guilty.

156
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:11,637
What's "Marry Me"?

157
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,556
It's Kat and Bastian's new song.

158
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:15,266
- It's everyone's new song.
- It's my new song.

159
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,143
- It's not mine.
- People are gonna propose to it.

160
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:18,644
They're gonna post videos
of themselves

161
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:20,146

Roxy and her ex-girlfriend

Hi, love.

168
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:34,327
- Did you see my post?
- No. You post something?

169
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:41,417
(chuckles)

170
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:43,711

172
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:47,715
I love you.

173
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:49,384
I love you more, baby.

174
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:50,551
(inhales deeply)

175
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:52,553
- When'll you be home?
- About an hour.

176
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:54,263
You know there's about
a thousand people

177
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:56,140
- in this apartment right now?
- (laughing): What?

178
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,018
I know.

179
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:02,605
20 million?

180
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:04,148
(chuckles) Yeah, of course.

181
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,943
Oh, my God. This has gotten
so out of control.

182
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:08,778
(man speaks Spanish over phone)

183
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,363
BASTIAN:
Yo, I'm on with Kat. Wait.

184
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:12,156
Yeah, I just...

185
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,493
now I just wish it was me
and you on a beach somewhere.

186
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,036
No, my love.

187
00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:19,747
You deserve the biggest wedding
in the world.

188
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:23,501
And tomorrow's gonna be
the best night of our lives.

189
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:27,130
- Can't wait. (chuckles)
- I can't wait either, baby.

190
00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:33,845
MELISSA:
Where's Kat?

191
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,139
An interview in ten minutes.

192
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,725
(horns honking)

193
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,476
CHARLIE:
Look what I just found.

194
00:07:40,518 --> 00:07:41,728
Scoot over. (grunts)

195
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:43,813
I was just looking
through some old pictures.

196
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:46,274
- Uh-huh?
- And look at this one I saw

197
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:49,652
of you, me and Mom
in Jamaica, parasailing.

198
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:51,070
We went parasailing?

199
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:52,655
Do you not remember?

200
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:53,990
I mean, to be honest,

201
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:55,825
I don't remember you
together at all.

202
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,160
(grunts softly)

203
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:00,580
Well, we were, and we had fun.

204
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:03,332
I get it, Dad.
You were a fun guy.

205
00:08:03,374 --> 00:08:07,795
I was, and I am a fun guy.

206
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:10,506
(takes deep breath)

207
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:12,675
But, you know,

208
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:15,678
it's not just about fun.

209
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,472
It's-it's harder than that.

210
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:19,682
It's work. It's...

211
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:22,268
Well, think about Tank.

212
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,270
- When Tank was a puppy.
- (chuckles)

213
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:25,688
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

214
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,148
You remember how fun he was

215
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,025
and playing tug-of-war
with the Frisbee

216
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,027
and him jumping around?

217
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:34,697
And now he's old,
and his eyes don't work,

218
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:37,325
and you don't know
how many good years he has left,

219
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,535
- but you still...
- Dad, is Tank dying?

220
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:41,204
No. No.

221
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:43,873
I'm sorry, I-I... Tank's good.

222
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:46,084
I got a little off track.

223
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,711
I was just...
What I meant is that

224
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:52,548
love is about sacrifice
and the day-to-day.

225
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,510
Um, Dad, uh,
can I go to sleep now?

226
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,096
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

227
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,014
- Okay. Good night.
- Okay.

228
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:01,641
Night.

229
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,980
JIMMY FALLON: Last time
she was here, Kat Valdez,

230
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:10,608
who let's just say
is no stranger to weddings...

231
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,235
(audience laughing)

232
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:14,320
...said she wanted to do
something smaller,

233
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:16,572
understated, intimate,

234
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:19,367
with just, say,
5,000 of their closest fans.

235
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:21,953
- (laughter)
- I mean friends.

236
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,747
Just a simple wedding
for a simple gal.

237
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:27,625
- Just like Mom's wedding was.
- (laughter)

238
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,460
RYAN SEACREST:
Hey, good morning, New York.

239
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,254
It's 102.7.
This is Seacrest with you.

240
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:32,463
ENRIQUE SANTOS:
Kat and Bastian fans,

241
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,132
it's Enrique Santos with you.

242
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,551
RADIO HOST:
Tonight, Kat Valdez and Bastian

243
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:39,095
will give it all they got
and tie the knot.

244
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:40,471
RADIO HOST 2:
Today is the big day.

245
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,306
RADIO HOST 3:
That shit is crazy, man.

246
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,766
KAT:
"Then on the shore

247
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:45,560
"Of the wide world
I stand alone, and think

248
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:49,480
Till love and fame
to nothingness do sink."

249
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,066
It's Keats.
You think he'll like it?

250
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:54,694
If somebody explains it
to him, yeah.

251
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,279
It's beautiful.

252
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,990
Oh, today is your wedding day!

253
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,408
- (squeals)
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

254
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,452
Get it, get it, get it.

255
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,037
Tomorrow would've been
our anniversary.

256
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:05,913
You guys went out
for what, two weeks?

257
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:08,458
17 days,
if you include the breakup.

258
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:10,918
And she dumped me with a text.

259
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,462
So rude.

260
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:15,506
Come to the Kat Valdez concert
with me tonight.

261
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,593
Parker, I'm not
a big concert person.

262
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:21,429
Listen, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime invitation,

263
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:23,139
and you don't even get it.

264
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:24,891
This is Halley's Comet.

265
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:27,018
It's you wearing an outfit
that flatters your body.

266
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,144
It's very rare.

267
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:29,771
Okay, I've got Lou tonight.

268
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:31,564
Good. I've got three tickets.

269
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:33,066
Bring her.

270
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:36,402
Maybe she'll think you're fun.

271
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:38,946

Thank you so much for being here

325
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,036
on such a monumentally
special occasion.

326
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:52,205
How's everybody feeling tonight?

(cheering)

331
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,176

for one in particular.

KAT:
Yes.

334
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:12,767
Ooh, hold this.

335
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:18,231
Hey, Roxy, check out
my new best friends.

336
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:20,191
Oh, yeah, and suck it!

337
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,651
(mellow Latin music begins)

338
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:25,363
That beautiful woman
is gonna be my wife.

339
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,408
I should've worn my onesie.

340
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:30,326
(laughs) Charlie.

341
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:32,620
(singing in Spanish)

342
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:44,048
Yeah.

343
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,174
Something's wrong.

344
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:46,676
Where?

345
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:48,302

I don't know exactly what to say

523
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:20,583
or what just happened,
but I know on some level

524
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:23,419
you must have really cared
about that guy.

525
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:27,090
I was marrying him.

526
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:29,884
Good point.

527
00:23:34,472 --> 00:23:37,558
He's going to age badly.

528
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:42,605
No, he's not.

529
00:23:42,647 --> 00:23:44,148
Yeah, you're right.

530
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,693
He's probably just gonna
get better looking.

531
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:49,070
(chuckles)

532
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:55,284
I'm really sorry about all this.

533
00:23:57,745 --> 00:23:59,831
Me, too.

534
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:13,344
You gonna be okay?

535
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:17,140
Jeff will take you home.

536
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:19,308
Okay. Good night.

537
00:24:23,813 --> 00:24:26,024
(cell phone buzzing)

538
00:24:28,943 --> 00:24:30,820
PARKER (over phone):
Charlie, finally.

539
00:24:30,862 --> 00:24:32,321
Hey. How's Lou?

540
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:34,282
She's fine. She's at her mom's.
Where are you?

541
00:24:34,323 --> 00:24:36,159
I'm in a garage.
I'm on my way home.

542
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,994
Hold on. You're saying
you haven't seen it?

543
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:39,662
(chuckling): Oh, my God.
You are everywhere.

544
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:41,247
Online, on television, on...

545
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:42,790
What do you mean "television"?

546
00:24:42,832 --> 00:24:44,500
FALLON (on TV): Did you hear
Kat Valdez got married

547
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:46,210
to a different stranger
at the concert tonight?

548
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:47,670
- Do you believe that?
- (audience laughing on TV)

549
00:24:47,712 --> 00:24:49,380
On the way home
from the concert tonight,

550
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:51,549
Kat Valdez also left
the guy from the concert,

551
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,885
then married her Uber driver,
and then...

552
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,386
(audience laughing)

553
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,472
Now he's-he's driving them
to the honeymoon

554
00:24:57,513 --> 00:24:59,682
in Turks and Caicos, where
she will marry the bellboy.

555
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:02,810
It's very... It's all...
It's all happening...

556
00:25:02,852 --> 00:25:04,896
REPORTER:
Kat Valdez y Bastian...

557
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,273
(reporter continues in Spanish)

558
00:25:07,315 --> 00:25:09,067
(sighs)

559
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,069
COLIN:
There you are.

560
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:16,574
You need anything?

561
00:25:21,162 --> 00:25:22,663
KAT:
Just...

562
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:25,124
tell me it didn't happen.

563
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:29,295
Why do I always pick
the wrong guy?

564
00:25:33,257 --> 00:25:35,301
I let everyone down.

565
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:38,054
- No, no. No, you didn't.
- (Kat sniffling, sobbing)

566
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:40,014
I can't get out of my own way.

567
00:25:40,056 --> 00:25:41,933
Oh, come here. Come here.

568
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,601
It's all right.

569
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:46,062
- We'll figure it out.
- (sobbing)

570
00:25:46,104 --> 00:25:47,605
I promise.

571
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:50,108
I promise.

572
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:52,819
We'll figure it out.

573
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,030
Well, the good news is
there was a wedding last night.

574
00:25:56,072 --> 00:25:59,158
The bad news is
it was not a joke.

575
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,827
I have two things to say.

576
00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:02,412
First, Kat, we love you...

577
00:26:02,453 --> 00:26:03,663
It's Bastian.

578
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:05,248
He says he just needs
five minutes.

579
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:06,958
Hang up and turn that off.

580
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,835
I got to go.

581
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:10,712
God, he's unbelievable.

582
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:11,963
What now?

583
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,381
Well, he's going to Puerto Rico.

584
00:26:13,423 --> 00:26:15,174
He says he needs to get
his head together.

585
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:16,300
(scoffs) Whatever.

586
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:17,927
(sighs) Kat, he was crying.

587
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:19,721
Not helping.

588
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:21,347
(Colin grunts softly)

589
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,644
COLIN:
You all right?

590
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,062
KAT:
No.

591
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:30,440
Okay, well, I did
a bit of digging last night,

592
00:26:30,481 --> 00:26:33,109
and it turns out, out of 10,000
potential dumpster fires,

593
00:26:33,151 --> 00:26:35,611
you picked a decent,
straight, single father

594
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:37,739
with no criminal record,
and get this,

595
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,865
he's a maths teacher.

596
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:40,241
- And that's good?
- It's great.

597
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:41,617
He's not gonna be a problem.

598
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:42,910
I say we offer $5,000,

599
00:26:42,952 --> 00:26:46,289
get him to sign an NDA
and let it all blow over.

600
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:49,500
Or...

601
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,170
Or?

602
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:56,132
Or I could stay married to him.

603
00:26:58,009 --> 00:26:59,677
(laughs)

604
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,095
You're kidding.

605
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:04,140
You're kidding.

606
00:27:04,932 --> 00:27:06,100
You're not kidding.

607
00:27:06,142 --> 00:27:07,643
Y-You can't. We can't.

608
00:27:07,685 --> 00:27:08,978
It-it's not legal.

609
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,271
We didn't file papers.

610
00:27:10,313 --> 00:27:11,731
So file the papers.

611
00:27:11,773 --> 00:27:12,940
Wha...

612
00:27:13,816 --> 00:27:15,902
I mean, play the record
through here.

613
00:27:15,943 --> 00:27:17,278
I started something last night,

614
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,864
and if I don't finish it,
I look crazy.

615
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:21,616
"Er." You'll look crazier.

616
00:27:21,657 --> 00:27:22,867
(Kat exhales)

617
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:24,660
(whispers):
Namaste.

618
00:27:24,702 --> 00:27:26,829
Yeah, we got to get out
in front of this.

619
00:27:26,871 --> 00:27:29,540
Now, he thinks he can
publicly humiliate me?

620
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:30,833
Screw him.

621
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:34,379
This is a manic response
to an insane situation.

622
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,506
No, we have to change
the narrative.

623
00:27:36,547 --> 00:27:38,341
All right?
I'm not marrying him forever.

624
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:41,344
It's just for a month,
a... a few months.

625
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:43,137
Now, presuming
the man you married

626
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:45,681
doesn't have
a girlfriend or a life,

627
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:47,809
and presuming
I can get him to agree,

628
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,770
I'm not sure exactly
what we're telling the world.

629
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:52,689
You don't want to be a joke.

630
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:56,442
I don't want to be
the punch line.

631
00:27:56,484 --> 00:27:59,696
We have to embrace
the spontaneity of the moment

632
00:27:59,737 --> 00:28:01,572
and just say...

633
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:06,411
"Nothing else has worked.

634
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,624
Maybe this will."

635
00:28:18,506 --> 00:28:20,341
You know what they say to do

636
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:22,301
when your car's skidding
out of control, Colin?

637
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:25,471
Close your eyes and pray?

638
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:29,434
Hit the gas and turn into it.

639
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:30,935
Wait, what are you saying?

640
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:32,353
Rethink the paradigm.

641
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:34,355
We're not selling the world
a fairy tale.

642
00:28:34,397 --> 00:28:36,024
We're taking the fairy tale
off the table.

643
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:37,233
That's what you did last night.

644
00:28:37,275 --> 00:28:38,901
- That's what I did?
- Yeah.

645
00:28:38,943 --> 00:28:40,903
Look, I was just trying
to help someone who seemed like

646
00:28:40,945 --> 00:28:42,530
they were in the middle
of a nervous breakdown.

647
00:28:42,572 --> 00:28:44,073
We're calling it
a break from tradition.

648
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:46,909
A moment of clarity where
she picked you out of a crowd

649
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:49,203
and you, my friend, picked her.

650
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:51,080
I don't even know her.

651
00:28:51,122 --> 00:28:53,583
Kat Valdez is a legend.

652
00:28:53,624 --> 00:28:54,584
Self-made.

653
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,252
She was raised
by a single father

654
00:28:56,294 --> 00:28:58,296
who died before she had
any kind of success.

655
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:00,048
Now she's a woman north of 35

656
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:02,341
in a business that marginalizes
women at any age.

657
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:04,302
People love their artists
to bare their souls,

658
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,012
then vilify them
if they go too far.

659
00:29:06,054 --> 00:29:08,264
Well, I'm not gonna let them
do that to her.

660
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:10,433
- And I'm asking you to help me.
- How?

661
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:13,144
Stand beside her
for three months.

662
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:14,228
And what does she think
about this?

663
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,563
It was her idea.

664
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:18,441
- She had the idea for...
- Yeah.

665
00:29:18,483 --> 00:29:20,610
What if we offered you $10,000?

666
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:22,945
No, no, no. Wrong approach.

667
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:24,822
Offer him, like, a fundraiser.

668
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,907
He'll go for that.

669
00:29:25,948 --> 00:29:27,575
(chuckling):
Oh. Hi.

670
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:29,327
Uh, I'm sorry. Are you two...

671
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:30,828
Ew, gross. No.

672
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,456
Parker Debs, guidance counselor.
Same school.

673
00:29:33,498 --> 00:29:36,000
How about, uh, we host
a fundraiser for your math club?

674
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,960
Don't answer that. Okay.

675
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:39,629
What about if it's, like,

676
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,298
instead of three months,
it's six months,

677
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,592
and it could be, like,
a whole math wing?

678
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:47,136
- (chuckles)
- I'm thinking about the children.

679
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:48,429
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

680
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:49,972
I don't think
anyone's gonna believe

681
00:29:50,014 --> 00:29:52,308
that she's gonna go
from Bastian to me.

682
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,810
- That's a good point.
- Well, the fact is

683
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:55,687
that she did go
from Bastian to you.

684
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:56,938
Counterpoint.

685
00:29:56,979 --> 00:29:58,648
COLIN: We're not pretending
you're in love.

686
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,316
We're just gonna say
that you're getting

687
00:30:00,358 --> 00:30:02,068
to know each other,
and if it goes further,

688
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,194
then great, and if it doesn't...

689
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,779
It won't. Come...

690
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:07,323
- Not with that attitude.
- Well, then it doesn't have to.

691
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:09,992
This is about this moment.

692
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:13,496
Managing the media frenzy
until things die down.

693
00:30:13,538 --> 00:30:15,081
I have a daughter.

694
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:18,000
I don't want to drag her
into the middle of a circus.

695
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:20,128
I can assure you,
we won't impinge

696
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:22,547
on your life whatsoever.

697
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,048
- (clamoring)
- How does it feel to not be a nobody?

698
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,967
How do you feel about her
being so much hotter

699
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:28,010
- than you, Charlie?
- Hey, Charlie! Right here!

700
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:29,262
Hey, Charlie, are you gonna
go through with this?

701
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:30,346
Where's the honeymoon?

702
00:30:30,388 --> 00:30:32,056
Did you get a good look at him?

703
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:33,683
Yeah. He's cute.

704
00:30:33,725 --> 00:30:34,767
What?

705
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:36,811
- He's fine.
- COLIN: Hey.

706
00:30:36,853 --> 00:30:39,439
Charlie, come in.

707
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,274
Oh, she's right there. Jesus.

708
00:30:41,315 --> 00:30:43,192
Come over, guys.

709
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:45,153
Charlie, Kat. Kat, Charlie.

710
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:46,946
- Hi. Oh.
- How are you? Oh.

711
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:48,364
(Charlie chuckles)

712
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:50,742
- Okay. (laughs)
- I'm Parker.

713
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:53,244
I'm... I am the one who brought
Charlie to the concert,

714
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:54,704
- so I'm-I'm...
- CHARLIE: Yep.

715
00:30:54,746 --> 00:30:55,955
Basically,
I guess I'm responsible

716
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:57,331
- for this whole thing.
- (laughter)

717
00:30:57,373 --> 00:30:58,875
Hi, Parker.

718
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,126
Hey, Kat.

719
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:01,127
Hi.

720
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:02,712
Would you do me a favor,

721
00:31:02,754 --> 00:31:04,672
uh, just two seconds,
and just say,

722
00:31:04,714 --> 00:31:06,049
- "Roxy, you really blew it"?
- CHARLIE: Oh. Oh.

723
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,801
Today Showis a go
at 10:00 on Tuesday.

724
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:10,386
- (whispers): Sorry.
- MELISSA: They want, uh, um...

725
00:31:10,428 --> 00:31:11,763
Um, Charlie.

726
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:14,849
Charlie in studio
and Kat remote from London.

727
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:16,726
- Kat.
- Excuse me one second.

728
00:31:16,768 --> 00:31:18,353
- I just have to take a call.
- Okay.

729
00:31:18,394 --> 00:31:20,021
- Bye, Kat.
- WOMAN: Everything's set up...

730
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:22,273
- She's like a real person.
- All right, so what's going on?

731
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:23,900
Uh, we're booking interviews
all week.

732
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:25,526
Uh-huh.
I thought that's what today was.

733
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:26,903
No, no. Today's more of
a press conference.

734
00:31:26,944 --> 00:31:28,404
But throughout
the next few weeks,

735
00:31:28,446 --> 00:31:29,947
we're gonna have
some sit-downs and B roll

736
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:31,657
and news outlets following us,
charting the progress

737
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:33,368
as you two
get to know each other.

738
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:34,535
It's all in your email.

739
00:31:34,577 --> 00:31:36,245
I don't check my emails a lot.

740
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:38,581
How do you schedule your life
if you don't check your email?

741
00:31:39,374 --> 00:31:40,917
Easy. I can't do anything

742
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:43,252
between 8:00 and 3:00
Monday through Friday,

743
00:31:43,294 --> 00:31:44,879
and I have math club
after school,

744
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:46,756
and three days a week,
I have my kid.

745
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:48,633
- Beyond that, I'm pretty much available.
- (groans)

746
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,094
- So, sorry...
- Melissa.

747
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:53,179
Melissa, you're gonna
have to move The Today Show.

748
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:54,305
What? Excuse me?

749
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:55,640
We don't move The Today Show.

750
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:58,059
We move for The Today Show.

751
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,435
He's gonna have to
shift his schedule.

752
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:00,561
Okay, I'll-I'll handle it.

753
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:02,438
Okay, I can handle my own life.

754
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,940
I can help him handle it.

755
00:32:03,981 --> 00:32:06,609
Uh, Melissa, shouldn't you
be posting Vitamix?

756
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:08,361
That's Tyra's job.

757
00:32:08,403 --> 00:32:10,154
Oh. Right.

758
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:11,864
Morning, everybody.
I don't know about you guys,

759
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:13,783
but when I get up in the
morning, I like to meditate.

760
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:16,369
I also love to have fresh juice.

761
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:18,746
So I like to juice daily
with my Vitamix.

762
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:22,125
I take my fresh greens,
mix and go.

763
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:23,835
Okay, look, I hate
to interrupt an artist

764
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:25,712
while she's juicing,
but we're gonna have to draw

765
00:32:25,753 --> 00:32:27,588
a hard line
when it comes to the students

766
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,465
- and the schedule, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

767
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:31,467
You're a little shiny.

768
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,845
MELISSA:
Awesome. Let's take a selfie.

769
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:34,971
(camera clicks)

770
00:32:35,012 --> 00:32:36,431
I don't feel comfortable.

771
00:32:36,472 --> 00:32:38,725
- I really don't feel like this is my world.
- It's natural.

772
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:40,643
It just feels like
everyone walking around

773
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:41,978
is, like, a sycophant.

774
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,313
Everything in her life
is sponsored.

775
00:32:44,355 --> 00:32:47,191
- I know, but don't ruin this for me.
- No, but listen to me.

776
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:49,152
- I...
- COLIN: Hey.

777
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:50,987
- How we doing?
- I'm sorry.

778
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:53,072
I don't... I don't think
it's gonna work out.

779
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:54,240
It's just perspective.

780
00:32:54,282 --> 00:32:55,867
No, it's not just perspective.

781
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:57,994
You see her as some pop star
with endorsement deals,

782
00:32:58,036 --> 00:32:59,370
a narcissist who takes
meaningless selfies,

783
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:00,872
but that's not the full...

784
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:02,707
Well, I mean, is a selfie
ever meaningful? I mean...

785
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:03,833
Look up.

786
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,501
Look, I-I don't mean
to be negative,

787
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:07,754
but I'm not
a big social media person.

788
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:09,756
I feel it's kind of
a distorted reality.

789
00:33:09,797 --> 00:33:11,841
I'm so glad I came
to your TED Talk.

790
00:33:11,883 --> 00:33:14,177
No, come on. I see it
all the time in my students.

791
00:33:14,218 --> 00:33:16,095
- It's... (sighs)
- MELISSA: Kat's ready to walk.

792
00:33:16,137 --> 00:33:17,513
Okay, she's ready.

793
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:18,890
COLIN: Social media
can also reach people.

794
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:20,767
- No, I know. Yeah.
- It can be a tool.

795
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:22,769
You know what a tool is,
though, right, Charlie?

796
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,396
- Okay. Thank you, Melissa.
- PARKER: Burn.

797
00:33:27,148 --> 00:33:28,691
I know this is a lot.

798
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:30,693
Just go out there
and be yourself.

799
00:33:30,735 --> 00:33:32,653
Myself probably wouldn't
be here, but...

800
00:33:32,695 --> 00:33:34,572
Listen, if you don't
want to do this...

801
00:33:34,614 --> 00:33:37,825
Uh, what, then I leave?

802
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:39,410
I thought you said
he was into this.

803
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:41,412
- COLIN: He is.
- He can hear you.

804
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:42,538
COLIN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

805
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,624
Kat Valdez and her new husband,

806
00:33:44,665 --> 00:33:45,917
Charlie Gilbert.

807
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:48,127
- (applause)
- (cameras clicking)

808
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:53,549
REPORTER:
So, you think it's romantic

809
00:33:53,591 --> 00:33:54,884
marrying a complete stranger?

810
00:33:54,926 --> 00:33:58,513
Uh, impulsive, without a plan.

811
00:33:58,554 --> 00:34:00,556
But, hey, look where
my plans got me.

812
00:34:00,598 --> 00:34:01,641
(laughter)

813
00:34:01,682 --> 00:34:02,934
So, you just

814
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:04,727
threw caution to the wind
and thought...

815
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:06,979
I didn't think, actually.

816
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:08,064
It was a moment.

817
00:34:08,106 --> 00:34:09,732
You're banking a lifetime
on a moment?

818
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:11,859
No, I'm banking
a moment on a moment.

819
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:14,821
Get enough of those,
and that's a lifetime.

820
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:16,239
You know nothing
about each other.

821
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,740
Did you think twice?

822
00:34:17,782 --> 00:34:18,825
Charlie?

823
00:34:18,866 --> 00:34:20,702
Mm, people meet randomly
all the time.

824
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:22,578
At a... at a bar or...

825
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,122
Online.

826
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,790
Yeah, online, at 7-Eleven.

827
00:34:25,832 --> 00:34:27,625
- (laughing)
- CHARLIE: Uh...

828
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,752
I mean, why is this any crazier?

829
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:32,463
To state the obvious,
you got married.

830
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:36,801
Yeah, and...

831
00:34:36,843 --> 00:34:39,595
Now we get to know each other.

832
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:42,348
- But not as man and wife?
- KAT: Uh, no.

833
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,100
That would be nuts. (chuckles)

834
00:34:44,142 --> 00:34:45,476
Just for her.

835
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:48,104
For me, it would be
pretty amazing.

836
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:49,647
(laughter)

837
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:51,441
Last night,
I held up a friend's sign

838
00:34:51,482 --> 00:34:53,735
asking a woman to marry me,

839
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:58,114
and she said yes,
and I did, and...

840
00:34:59,574 --> 00:35:01,200
...you know, I did it not,

841
00:35:01,242 --> 00:35:03,036
you know,
because she was beautiful...

842
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:05,038
- well, maybe a little...
- (laughter)

843
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:07,665
...um, but it just seemed like,

844
00:35:07,707 --> 00:35:09,792
in the moment,
the right thing to do.

845
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:13,880
So, what, you just saw
each other and said yes?

846
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,633
BOTH:
Yes.

847
00:35:17,675 --> 00:35:19,427
(both laugh)

848
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:21,554
And that doesn't seem frivolous?

849
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:25,683
Historically,
marriage was transactional.

850
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:28,269
It was about
expanding your empire,

851
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:31,147
and a woman's value
was based on what she brought.

852
00:35:31,189 --> 00:35:34,025
Like, "You give me a heifer,
and I'll give you my daughter."

853
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:35,860
(reporters scoffing, murmuring)

854
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:37,320
CHARLIE:
It's terrible. I know.

855
00:35:37,362 --> 00:35:39,364
That's... Uh, you know,
I didn't come up with it.

856
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:43,034
But it really was
a business deal,

857
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:45,453
and it wasn't designed
to be about love,

858
00:35:45,495 --> 00:35:49,499
and maybe that's where people
kind of get tripped up now.

859
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,001
REPORTER: This is your second
marriage, right, Charlie?

860
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:53,753
You wouldn't want to fail again.

861
00:35:56,381 --> 00:35:57,924
(chuckles softly)

862
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:00,051
Well, you haven't lived
unless you've failed, Bill.

863
00:36:00,093 --> 00:36:02,387
You should know that
from your time at CNBC.

864
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:03,846
(laughter)

865
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:06,974
Listen, what we did was crazy...

866
00:36:07,016 --> 00:36:09,018
we know that... but, you know,

867
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,021
it was just truly
a leap of faith.

868
00:36:12,063 --> 00:36:15,358
The rules as they exist
pretty much suck for women.

869
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,069
I mean, why do we have to wait
for men to propose?

870
00:36:18,111 --> 00:36:20,655
Why is everything on his terms?

871
00:36:20,697 --> 00:36:23,324
No, I think it is time
to shake things up.

872
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:25,201
How about this? We pick the guy,

873
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:28,705
we keep our name and let him
earn the right to stay.

874
00:36:28,746 --> 00:36:32,083
(cheering and applause)

875
00:36:35,086 --> 00:36:37,004
- COLIN: That was terrific.
- (Kat chuckling)

876
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:38,589
No, no, seriously.
Oh, and listen.

877
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:39,882
Don't worry about Tuesday.

878
00:36:39,924 --> 00:36:41,217
We'll adjust our schedule
around yours.

879
00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:42,760
- It'll be fine.
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

880
00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:44,095
- No, of course.
- KAT: We'll try not to

881
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:45,805
turn your life
upside down too much.

882
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:47,807
I think it might be
a little too late for that.

883
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:49,559
I mean, do you ever
get used to this?

884
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,230
Just the attention and the chaos
and the people everywhere?

885
00:36:54,272 --> 00:36:56,232
I don't know.
Some days, you barely notice.

886
00:36:56,274 --> 00:37:00,111
Other days, you feel like...
a panda in a zoo.

887
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:03,573
You should know that up front.

888
00:37:03,614 --> 00:37:04,782
Got it.

889
00:37:04,824 --> 00:37:06,034
Where you off to now?

890
00:37:06,075 --> 00:37:08,578
Oh, London, for a meeting.

891
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:11,080
And I'm off to Flatbush
for a dog,

892
00:37:11,122 --> 00:37:14,042
which pretty much sums it up.

893
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:17,295
I'll see you
at the next photo op?

894
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,756
- Okay.
- (engine starts)

895
00:37:19,797 --> 00:37:21,716
Don't forget to check
your schedule.

896
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:23,593
I got it.

897
00:37:23,634 --> 00:37:26,262
OMG.
He can't even text with that.

898
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:28,514
OMG. Yes, he can.

899
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:30,141
(whispers):
But very slowly.

900
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:41,611
Ay, ay, ay.

901
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:43,196
PARKER:
You did not look nervous,

902
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:44,906
and you know what,
you kind of have

903
00:37:44,947 --> 00:37:46,324
offbeat good looks
for someone...

904
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:48,117
- Offbeat?
- PHOTOGRAPHER: Charlie Valdez!

905
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,619
- Charlie, over here!
- CHARLIE: What are they doing here?

906
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,120
Relax. We're famous now.

907
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:52,997
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Is this a throuple?

908
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,791
Where's your wife?!
Why don't you live with her?!

909
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:56,167
Why are you yelling at me?

910
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:57,794
- I'm standing right here.
- Come on, Charlie.

911
00:37:57,835 --> 00:37:59,128
- I'm gonna go inside.
- What are you doing?

912
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,421
- PARKER: Just, um...
- Are you now Mr. Valdez?

913
00:38:00,463 --> 00:38:01,756
Are you in the doghouse? Huh?

914
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:03,800
(grunting):
Gonna be a short walk.

915
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:06,219
Go inside. I'll deal with this.

916
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,929
PHOTOGRAPHER:
You been kicked out already?

917
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,473
The dog can't shit
if people are watching.

918
00:38:10,515 --> 00:38:13,685
Luckily, I can only shit
if people are watching,

919
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:16,896
so if you're feeling lucky...

920
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:20,149
I'm busy, too, by the way.

921
00:38:20,191 --> 00:38:22,402

KAT:
I don't know about you guys,

927
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:47,635
but when I get up in
the morning, I like to meditate.

928
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:49,178
I also love to have fresh juice.

929
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,055
So I like to juice daily
with my Vitamix.

930
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:53,057
Could we get a Vitamix?

931
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,851
I'd like to juice daily.

932
00:38:54,892 --> 00:38:56,060
Come on. Put that down.

933
00:38:56,102 --> 00:38:57,729
No electronics at dinner.

934
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,230
What do you call that?

935
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:01,232
I call that
a nature documentary,

936
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:04,193
so we can travel while we eat.

937
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:06,195
Put it down.

938
00:39:07,572 --> 00:39:10,700
So, is Kat, like, my stepmom?

939
00:39:10,742 --> 00:39:12,326
No, Lou. Come on.

940
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:15,371
Dad, I think this experience
is actually really good for you.

941
00:39:15,413 --> 00:39:16,873
Says my 12-year-old?

942
00:39:16,914 --> 00:39:18,666
It's true.
I mean, you never just, like,

943
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,293
do things without planning them.

944
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:21,669
I think it's cool.

945
00:39:21,711 --> 00:39:23,212
I really want to meet her.

946
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:25,214
I mean, Parker says she's nice

947
00:39:25,256 --> 00:39:28,092
and smart and next-level hot.

948
00:39:28,134 --> 00:39:30,053
She is nice.
She is... She's an attract...

949
00:39:30,094 --> 00:39:31,637
Here, let me get this.

950
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,599
Dad, she just hit 80 million
followers on Instagram.

951
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,100
Okay. I'm not impressed.

952
00:39:36,142 --> 00:39:38,603
Talk to me when she gets
to 90 million, okay?

953
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:40,396
Lou, it's not real.

954
00:39:40,438 --> 00:39:41,981
It's all a facade.

955
00:39:42,023 --> 00:39:43,733
You know, they had me
wearing makeup.

956
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:45,610
You wear makeup now?

957
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:47,653
Wore once. Never again.

958
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:51,032
Well, you never say never,
but I don't plan on it

959
00:39:51,074 --> 00:39:53,451
in the next couple months
that we're doing this.

960
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:56,287
And you're saying the whole time
I can't meet her?

961
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:57,914
I don't think
Mom would want that.

962
00:39:57,955 --> 00:39:59,749
Actually, Mom wants
to meet her, too.

963
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:03,211
Oh, perfect. Lou, you know
that we're not really together.

964
00:40:03,252 --> 00:40:06,297
Her manager stages things. Look.

965
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:09,258
- You have an iPhone?
- Yeah.

966
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,927
I mean, it's-it's just
for scheduling.

967
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:12,553
They're making me use it.

968
00:40:12,595 --> 00:40:14,055
- Huh.
- Yeah, bowling,

969
00:40:14,097 --> 00:40:15,807
and then we're gonna do
a photo shoot, so...

970
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:19,769
Uh-huh. But do you guys,
like, talk ever?

971
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:22,355
It's just publicity.
It's not real.

972
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:24,315
Hmm.

973
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:27,276
Yeah! Come on!

974
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:28,986
Okay, your turn.

975
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:30,405
Don't be nervous.
It's just, uh...

976
00:40:30,446 --> 00:40:32,115
It's not a competition.
Just having fun.

977
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:33,700
Uh, okay, no. I'm guessing

978
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:35,868
from the way you're holding
that that you haven't done

979
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,162
- too much bowling.
- Uh, what do I do?

980
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:40,123
Well, you... you're gonna want
to put your fingers

981
00:40:40,164 --> 00:40:41,582
- in the holes there.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

982
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:43,292
This one, yeah.
Get your thumb in that one.

983
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:45,128
- There? That one? Okay.
- Yep. And then take

984
00:40:45,169 --> 00:40:47,463
three steps kind of...
you want to land on your left,

985
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:49,549
and don't be afraid
to use those little...

986
00:40:54,345 --> 00:40:57,265
A strike is better
than a spare, right?

987
00:40:57,306 --> 00:40:59,142
- That is not your first time bowling.
- (laughing)

988
00:40:59,183 --> 00:41:00,935
Yes! Did you get that?

989
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:03,646
- Come on! The old rope-a-dope.
- Yes!

990
00:41:03,688 --> 00:41:05,356
MELISSA:
Oh, my God.

991
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:08,317
I wish I put money on this,
because people are loving it.

992
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:10,069
- What people?
- Oh, well, this is

993
00:41:10,111 --> 00:41:12,488
an Instagram live feed,
and 237,000 people

994
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,449
are like, "Why is he
such a boring nerd?"

995
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,701
- Mel.
- What? Their words, not mine.

996
00:41:16,743 --> 00:41:17,827
Get off the live, Mel.

997
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:19,078
All right.

998
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,371
So, we just need
a little bit more

999
00:41:20,413 --> 00:41:21,873
B roll for The Today Show.

1000
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:24,792
Well, I've-I've got to
get home to Tank.

1001
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:26,252
- Is Tank his daughter?
- Stop.

1002
00:41:26,294 --> 00:41:27,962
- COLIN: Okay.
- You have to go?

1003
00:41:28,004 --> 00:41:30,131
Yeah, if you guys
are done with me.

1004
00:41:30,173 --> 00:41:32,884
Mm-hmm. We're going to a party.

1005
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:35,053
You go.

1006
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:37,096
Where's home?

1007
00:41:42,185 --> 00:41:44,187
KAT:
Wow. Cool.

1008
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:46,564
CHARLIE:
Thanks.

1009
00:41:46,606 --> 00:41:49,317
Yeah, it's a, um...

1010
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,819
Kat, meet dog. (chuckling)

1011
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:53,780
Wow, I never heard
that one before.

1012
00:41:53,821 --> 00:41:56,908
Sorry. That was pretty... ruff.

1013
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:59,869
(laughing):
You are so lucky

1014
00:41:59,911 --> 00:42:01,704
that Mel didn't
hear you say that.

1015
00:42:01,746 --> 00:42:03,206
No, I'm lucky Mel isn't here.

1016
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:05,541
I feel like you're never alone.

1017
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:07,043
What? I'm alone now.

1018
00:42:07,085 --> 00:42:10,046
Well, I mean, yeah,
other than Kofi.

1019
00:42:10,088 --> 00:42:11,839
KAT:
Just ignore him.

1020
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:14,592
CHARLIE:
Is everything you do filmed?

1021
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:16,594
- KAT: Banked.
- Banked?

1022
00:42:16,636 --> 00:42:18,262
For my channel.

1023
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:20,598
Just little mini episodes
of life.

1024
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:26,104
Uh, can-can we skip an episode?

1025
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,149
Want me to go?

1026
00:42:30,191 --> 00:42:31,901
KAT:
Yeah, you can go.

1027
00:42:31,943 --> 00:42:33,194
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.

1028
00:42:33,236 --> 00:42:34,862
- I'll see you. Yeah.
- Happy?

1029
00:42:34,904 --> 00:42:36,114
Relieved.

1030
00:42:36,155 --> 00:42:38,074
(door closes)

1031
00:42:38,116 --> 00:42:39,242
KAT:
Is this your daughter?

1032
00:42:39,283 --> 00:42:40,243
- CHARLIE: Yeah.
- She's cute.

1033
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:42,578
Thanks. Yeah, she's great.

1034
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,915
Although she is in that
awkward in-between phase

1035
00:42:45,957 --> 00:42:48,251
where she's still my baby girl

1036
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:51,295
but she definitely wants
nothing to do with me.

1037
00:42:51,337 --> 00:42:53,297
And you can forget
about getting hugs,

1038
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:55,717
'cause it's not
happening anymore,

1039
00:42:55,758 --> 00:43:00,430
which kind of breaks my heart,
but that's the way it goes.

1040
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:02,974
What happened with her mom?

1041
00:43:04,225 --> 00:43:05,435
I mean, I'm sorry, you don't...

1042
00:43:05,476 --> 00:43:06,686
You know,
it's none of my business.

1043
00:43:06,728 --> 00:43:08,187
You don't have to tell me.
(chuckles)

1044
00:43:08,229 --> 00:43:11,274
No, no, it's okay. Um...

1045
00:43:11,315 --> 00:43:14,027
We were married, and
we actually had a good marriage.

1046
00:43:14,068 --> 00:43:15,445
You know, then,

1047
00:43:15,486 --> 00:43:17,321
I don't know, all of a sudden,
I got the feeling

1048
00:43:17,363 --> 00:43:19,574
she didn't want it
or she didn't want me anymore,

1049
00:43:19,615 --> 00:43:21,784
and I had nothing to do
but let her go.

1050
00:43:21,826 --> 00:43:24,704
And, you know,
statistically, we're screwed,

1051
00:43:24,746 --> 00:43:28,624
'cause 48% of marriages
end in divorce, so...

1052
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:30,793
That means 52% work.

1053
00:43:30,835 --> 00:43:33,212
- Ah, an optimist.
- (laughs)

1054
00:43:34,005 --> 00:43:35,715
- This is so cool. Can I?
- Yeah.

1055
00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:39,093
And then I think when you get
up to, like, second and third,

1056
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,387
then it jumps up to, like,
67% failure rate.

1057
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:44,307
Even if it's one in a billion,
what does it matter?

1058
00:43:44,348 --> 00:43:46,934
It's worth a shot.

1059
00:43:46,976 --> 00:43:48,644
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1060
00:43:48,686 --> 00:43:49,979
I believe in marriage.

1061
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:51,314
Jesus, still?

1062
00:43:51,356 --> 00:43:53,608
Haven't you been married
like six times?

1063
00:43:53,649 --> 00:43:55,109
Three times.

1064
00:43:55,151 --> 00:43:57,528
Not including this.
This is four.

1065
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:00,156
But the first time
was only 48 hours, so...

1066
00:44:00,198 --> 00:44:01,699
doesn't count.

1067
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:03,951
But still, do you ever
feel like just kind of,

1068
00:44:03,993 --> 00:44:07,038
"I'm waving the white flag
on marriage. That's it."

1069
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,831
No, it's like math.

1070
00:44:08,873 --> 00:44:12,377
When you get a problem wrong,
you just don't give up on it.

1071
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:15,421
You keep trying
till you get it right.

1072
00:44:15,463 --> 00:44:17,256
CHARLIE:
And what about you and Bastian?

1073
00:44:17,298 --> 00:44:19,258
How long were you guys together?

1074
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,219
Mm, year and a half.

1075
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,513
I'd just split
from my second husband.

1076
00:44:23,554 --> 00:44:25,640
He was a music producer
who did, uh,

1077
00:44:25,681 --> 00:44:28,976
my last two albums
and then sold a sex tape.

1078
00:44:29,018 --> 00:44:30,853
- (inhales sharply)
- That's not the worst part.

1079
00:44:30,895 --> 00:44:33,773
The worst part is
I thought I could fix things.

1080
00:44:33,815 --> 00:44:36,192
- (chuckles)
- Pretty hard to fix a sex tape.

1081
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:38,277
- Right.
- (Tank grumbles)

1082
00:44:41,531 --> 00:44:44,659
Sorry. Yeah, it's just
a little power nap.

1083
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:46,202
Pacing himself.

1084
00:44:46,244 --> 00:44:47,704
- Mm.
- (Charlie chuckles)

1085
00:44:47,745 --> 00:44:50,373
If we give him a minute,
he'll-he'll restart.

1086
00:44:50,415 --> 00:44:52,750
- Okay.
- But you were saying?

1087
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:54,419
Well, this business,
those type of guys,

1088
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,170
they build you up
to break you down.

1089
00:44:56,212 --> 00:44:57,714
But you were
already famous, so...

1090
00:44:57,755 --> 00:44:59,549
It's not about fame.

1091
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:03,302
You know,
it's about credibility.

1092
00:45:03,344 --> 00:45:05,722
It just didn't matter
how successful I was.

1093
00:45:05,763 --> 00:45:08,558
They never gave it to me.

1094
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:12,270
You know I've never been
nominated for anything?

1095
00:45:13,062 --> 00:45:15,356
And then I met Bastian.

1096
00:45:15,398 --> 00:45:18,776
And he... and he gave me this.

1097
00:45:21,195 --> 00:45:23,614
"Sing." What does that mean?

1098
00:45:23,656 --> 00:45:26,617
It means "don't let them win."

1099
00:45:30,997 --> 00:45:32,749
Nobody's all bad, Charlie.

1100
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:34,751
If they were, it would
make it so much easier.

1101
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:38,838
But cheating on you with
your assistant is pretty bad.

1102
00:45:42,425 --> 00:45:45,344
(grunting):
Okay.

1103
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:51,768
Zoo mates.

1104
00:45:53,144 --> 00:45:55,271
Zoo mates.

1105
00:45:57,231 --> 00:45:59,692

so different, Charlie.

- Are you going to bed?

1191

Um, maybe.

1192
00:49:25,857 --> 00:49:27,483

1196

She finally agreed
to join the math club,

1197
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:37,827
which makes me happy
'cause she's phenomenal at math

1198
00:49:37,869 --> 00:49:39,537
even though
she doesn't want to be.

1199
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:41,456
Well, maybe she just
doesn't want to be you.

1200
00:49:41,497 --> 00:49:42,623
That's for certain.

1201
00:49:42,665 --> 00:49:44,000
But it's not really that.

1202
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:46,169
It's-it's more that
she's afraid, and,

1203
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:48,755
you know, she almost won
the Mathalon when she was 11.

1204
00:49:48,796 --> 00:49:50,965
- The Mathalon?
- Yeah, the Mathalon.

1205
00:49:51,007 --> 00:49:52,800
It's kind of like
the Grammys for math,

1206
00:49:52,842 --> 00:49:54,969
except there's like
four people in the audience.

1207
00:49:55,011 --> 00:49:57,972
- Ah.
- She kind of froze in the finals,

1208
00:49:58,014 --> 00:50:01,434
and then some kids
made fun of her and...

1209
00:50:01,476 --> 00:50:03,269
I just want her
to find her place.

1210
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:05,521
Just give her a minute.

1211
00:50:05,563 --> 00:50:07,523
Yeah, definitely.

1212
00:50:07,565 --> 00:50:10,234
Okay, well, I'm glad
you were lonely.

1213
00:50:10,276 --> 00:50:11,903
(chuckling)

1214
00:50:11,944 --> 00:50:14,280
I guess I'll let you
get to bed now.

1215
00:50:14,322 --> 00:50:16,282
- (laughs) Okay.
- Bye.

1216
00:50:16,324 --> 00:50:18,034
So long. Adios.

1217
00:50:18,076 --> 00:50:19,911
(laughs) Bye.

1218
00:50:19,952 --> 00:50:21,162
See you.

1219
00:50:28,378 --> 00:50:30,338
(sighs):
Yeah.

1220
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,340
(kids chattering)

1221
00:50:32,382 --> 00:50:34,300
(school bell rings)

1222
00:50:34,342 --> 00:50:36,719
Okay, after you've completed
the prime factorization,

1223
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:38,971
identify the distinct
prime factor.

1224
00:50:39,013 --> 00:50:41,057
All right, listen up,
Coolidge Pi-thons.

1225
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:42,809
- I'm here on official business.
- Park...

1226
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,645
First of all, who didn't get
their waiver signed?

1227
00:50:45,687 --> 00:50:47,063
All right, you two, out.

1228
00:50:47,105 --> 00:50:48,940
Hey, y-you can't just
dismiss my students.

1229
00:50:48,981 --> 00:50:50,733
(mock stammering) Yes, I can.

1230
00:50:50,775 --> 00:50:53,444
You heard me. Scram. Beat it!

1231
00:50:54,278 --> 00:50:55,947
Now, for the rest of you

1232
00:50:55,988 --> 00:50:58,282
who know how
to follow direction,

1233
00:50:58,324 --> 00:51:01,994
I bring you the one, the only...

1234
00:51:02,787 --> 00:51:04,330
(students gasping)

1235
00:51:04,372 --> 00:51:06,582
(squealing excitedly)

1236
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:07,917
Kat, I love you!

1237
00:51:07,959 --> 00:51:10,253
Percy, stop yelling.
She's right here.

1238
00:51:10,294 --> 00:51:11,713
Hi.

1239
00:51:11,754 --> 00:51:14,090
Thought you had a private
for, like, a fortune.

1240
00:51:14,132 --> 00:51:15,967
I rescheduled.

1241
00:51:16,008 --> 00:51:18,428
PARKER: All right,
who's got a question for Kat?

1242
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:19,637
- Oh, I do! I do!
- Me! Me!

1243
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,097
Say something smart.

1244
00:51:21,139 --> 00:51:22,348
Don't embarrass me.

1245
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:23,433
Uh, George.

1246
00:51:23,474 --> 00:51:25,101
Did you really kiss Katy Perry?

1247
00:51:25,143 --> 00:51:26,310
Actually, she kissed me.

1248
00:51:26,352 --> 00:51:27,895
- STUDENTS: Ooh.
- KAT: Next.

1249
00:51:27,937 --> 00:51:28,688
Oh!

1250
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:29,856
Uh, Not George.

1251
00:51:29,897 --> 00:51:31,190
- Spencer.
- Don't care.

1252
00:51:31,232 --> 00:51:34,902
Why is Mr. Gilbert
better than Bastian?

1253
00:51:34,944 --> 00:51:37,196
Well...

1254
00:51:37,238 --> 00:51:39,615
he didn't cheat on me
with my assistant.

1255
00:51:39,657 --> 00:51:41,951
- STUDENTS: Ooh.
- (laughter, cheering)

1256
00:51:41,993 --> 00:51:44,328
Okay, you guys caught us
right in the middle

1257
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:46,456
of our mock Mathalon training,

1258
00:51:46,497 --> 00:51:49,459
which you're welcome to stay
and enjoy for a little bit.

1259
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,753
Uh, Lou, you're up.

1260
00:51:51,794 --> 00:51:53,546
- (whispers): Dad, no.
- KAT: Is that Lou?

1261
00:51:53,588 --> 00:51:55,173
Yeah.

1262
00:51:55,214 --> 00:51:57,341
Finally. Hi.

1263
00:51:57,383 --> 00:51:59,343
I've wanted to meet you forever.

1264
00:51:59,385 --> 00:52:00,762
Me, too.

1265
00:52:00,803 --> 00:52:02,472
PARKER: Are you kidding me?
They haven't met?

1266
00:52:02,513 --> 00:52:04,307
- No.
- What is wrong with you?

1267
00:52:04,348 --> 00:52:06,851
- Well, they...
- (whispers): You're married.

1268
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:08,478
Can we forget about
the mock Mathalon?

1269
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:10,646
I have a million questions
for Kat.

1270
00:52:10,688 --> 00:52:11,939
Yeah, and Lou's too scared
to get up

1271
00:52:11,981 --> 00:52:13,149
in front of people anyways.

1272
00:52:13,191 --> 00:52:14,567
Shut up, Jose.

1273
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:16,319
Oh, well, don't worry.
I totally get it.

1274
00:52:16,361 --> 00:52:18,821
You know, sometimes when I have
to get up in front of an arena

1275
00:52:18,863 --> 00:52:22,450
with thousands and thousands
of people, I get so nervous.

1276
00:52:22,492 --> 00:52:24,035
(student murmuring in disbelief)

1277
00:52:24,077 --> 00:52:26,037
No, I'm serious.
I'm afraid I'll choke.

1278
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,457
Okay, Mel, pull up
"Kat VMAs 2010."

1279
00:52:29,499 --> 00:52:30,666
- I've got it.
- Oh, okay.

1280
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:32,210
- Hey, Google.
- Look at this.

1281
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:37,382

- (laughs): That's enough.

1287
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,728
- (students groaning)
- Yeah.

1288
00:52:51,604 --> 00:52:54,399
I forgot the lyrics on live TV

1289
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,484
to a song that I wrote.

1290
00:52:56,526 --> 00:52:58,277
It could happen to anybody.

1291
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,613
Yeah, but the point is
that once it does,

1292
00:53:00,655 --> 00:53:02,949
you're always worried, you know?

1293
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,742
What if it happens again?

1294
00:53:04,784 --> 00:53:06,077
What did you do?

1295
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,870
I shifted focus.

1296
00:53:07,912 --> 00:53:09,872
I made my dance so hard

1297
00:53:09,914 --> 00:53:12,625
that all I could do
was concentrate on the steps.

1298
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:15,378
So, it's like
you distracted your mind.

1299
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,213
Yes. Exactly.

1300
00:53:17,255 --> 00:53:21,634
Concentrating on the dance steps
made me forget how scared I was.

1301
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:27,306
Mel, we're gonna need
some speakers.

1302
00:53:29,392 --> 00:53:31,394

but he's also, like,
really smart and nice.

(Kat chuckles)

1568
01:04:54,077 --> 01:04:57,080
What was your old favorite song?

1569
01:04:57,121 --> 01:04:58,706
Um... I don't know,

1570
01:04:58,748 --> 01:05:02,293
this might be a little
too edgy for you to handle,

1571
01:05:02,335 --> 01:05:05,380
but when my mom was sick,
we watched a lot of musicals,

1572
01:05:05,421 --> 01:05:07,382
and her favorite was Camelot.

1573
01:05:07,423 --> 01:05:08,716
KAT:
Mm.

1574
01:05:08,758 --> 01:05:10,259

Game of Thrones

1575
01:05:10,301 --> 01:05:12,345

1576
01:05:12,387 --> 01:05:16,057

- (laughs)

01:05:16,099 --> 01:05:17,600
But, anyway, when Lancelot

1578
01:05:17,642 --> 01:05:19,602
wants to tell Guenevere
how he feels,

1579
01:05:19,644 --> 01:05:22,105
instead of saying,
"I want to be with you,"

1580
01:05:22,146 --> 01:05:25,692
he says, "We're gonna split up.
It's inevitable."

1581
01:05:25,733 --> 01:05:27,527

1640
01:08:44,223 --> 01:08:45,892
I'll call you later.

1641
01:08:45,933 --> 01:08:48,895

rearranging your day for me?

1642
01:08:49,896 --> 01:08:51,272
Maybe.

"the wishing wheel."

1649
01:09:01,741 --> 01:09:03,451
Yeah. We loved going out there.

1650
01:09:03,493 --> 01:09:05,787
Although the last time
that I took her out there,

1651
01:09:05,828 --> 01:09:07,330
it was closed
'cause it was winter.

1652
01:09:07,372 --> 01:09:09,374
It was, like, right before
she passed away.

1653
01:09:09,415 --> 01:09:11,250
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, no.

I like talking about her.

1655
01:09:13,544 --> 01:09:18,216
It happened a while ago
when Lou was like five, but...

1656
01:09:18,257 --> 01:09:22,929
they definitely got to spend
some good times together.

1657
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:26,349
And it's crazy how much of her
I see in Lou.

1658
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:28,226

1659
01:09:28,267 --> 01:09:29,227

What?

1661
01:09:30,311 --> 01:09:32,021
Yes, she would've loved you.

1662
01:09:32,063 --> 01:09:33,648
She would've thought
you were amazing.

1663
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:36,067
I mean, she might have
questioned a few things.

1664
01:09:36,109 --> 01:09:37,985
She was very...

1665
01:09:38,027 --> 01:09:39,779
Well, she was
very self-sufficient.

1666
01:09:39,821 --> 01:09:41,656
Well, I'm, like,
the most self-sufficient

1667
01:09:41,698 --> 01:09:43,241
person on the planet.

1668
01:09:43,282 --> 01:09:45,576
- I mean, I do more things in one day than...
- No, I know.

1669
01:09:45,618 --> 01:09:47,537
I know you do.
I'm not saying that.

1670
01:09:47,578 --> 01:09:48,746
I'm saying you have
a lot of people,

1671

you know,
kind of handling things.

1672

There's nothing wrong
with having help.

1673
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:53,459
- I mean, it doesn't mean I'm helpless.
- (chuckles)

1674
01:09:53,501 --> 01:09:55,586
It just means that I have
a lot of things on my plate.

1675
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:58,589
I know, but you might not need
as many people helping you

1676
01:09:58,631 --> 01:10:00,299
as you think you do.

1677
01:10:00,341 --> 01:10:02,635
So, what are you saying?

1678
01:10:02,677 --> 01:10:05,388
You want me to try being alone?

1679
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:06,931
Because I could go
be alone right now.

1680
01:10:06,973 --> 01:10:08,558
No, no, uh, let's be clear.

1681
01:10:08,599 --> 01:10:11,686
"Alone" means without help,
not alone without me.

1682
01:10:11,728 --> 01:10:13,855
Wait.

1683
01:10:13,896 --> 01:10:15,815
Is this a challenge?

1684
01:10:15,857 --> 01:10:17,233
Now you get it.

1685
01:10:17,275 --> 01:10:19,027
- What, are you challenging me?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1686
01:10:19,068 --> 01:10:21,988
Yeah, but let's make it
a real challenge, okay?

1687
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:24,032
- Okay.
- That means without doormen.

1688
01:10:24,073 --> 01:10:26,117
- Without yes-Melissa.
- Fine.

1689
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,326
Without cooks,

1690
01:10:27,368 --> 01:10:29,537
without cleaners,
without hair extenders.

1691
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:31,372
- (laughs)
- Yeah, this is serious.

1692
01:10:31,414 --> 01:10:33,082

1693

filming updates.

1694
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:37,754

Gone.

1695
01:10:37,795 --> 01:10:39,839
Okay. I can do that.

1696
01:10:39,881 --> 01:10:41,883
- Okay.
- What are you gonna do?

1697
01:10:41,924 --> 01:10:43,843
Me? I'm...
You know, I'm gonna be there.

1698
01:10:43,885 --> 01:10:45,219
I'm gonna monitor.

1699
01:10:45,261 --> 01:10:46,262
Mm.

1700
01:10:46,304 --> 01:10:47,722

1701
01:10:47,764 --> 01:10:49,307
- Okay.

1702
01:10:50,641 --> 01:10:52,602

1703

You're gonna go on social media.

You're gonna have Snapchat

1707
01:11:00,026 --> 01:11:02,111

- This is about you.

1708
01:11:02,153 --> 01:11:03,446
- Don't flip it.
- No, listen.

1709
01:11:03,488 --> 01:11:04,781

1710
01:11:04,822 --> 01:11:06,115
It's so crazy.

1711
01:11:06,157 --> 01:11:08,868
No, look, this is
gonna be a great thing.

1712
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:11,287
It's an amazing platform

1713
01:11:11,329 --> 01:11:12,705

01:18:28,391 --> 01:18:30,351
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1887
01:18:30,393 --> 01:18:32,937
Just keeping Tank company.

1888
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:35,231
Good dog.

1889
01:18:37,442 --> 01:18:39,986
You're afraid she'll fall back
in love with Bastian

1890
01:18:40,028 --> 01:18:42,071
and dump you?

1891
01:18:42,113 --> 01:18:44,741
No.

1892
01:18:44,782 --> 01:18:46,284
Yeah.

1893
01:18:46,325 --> 01:18:48,619
I'd be afraid of that, too.

1895
01:18:54,292 --> 01:18:56,586

1896
01:18:56,627 --> 01:18:58,588
Thank you. Thank you very much.

I have a little surprise
for you tonight.

1899
01:19:05,219 --> 01:19:07,764
There is a woman

1901

- CHARLIE: Hey.
- (laughing): Oh, my God.

1980
01:23:48,836 --> 01:23:51,381
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Hey.

1981
01:23:51,422 --> 01:23:53,049
No, I wasn't,
and then I was like,

1982
01:23:53,091 --> 01:23:55,051
"I'm gonna get down there,"
and-and...

1983
01:23:55,093 --> 01:23:56,344
but I didn't have a pass,

1984
01:23:56,386 --> 01:23:58,137
so I couldn't get in at first,
and then luckily,

1985
01:23:58,179 --> 01:24:00,223
someone saw me
and they brought me backstage

1986
01:24:00,264 --> 01:24:03,142
and then brought me over here.

1987
01:24:03,184 --> 01:24:04,435
So, you didn't see it?

1988
01:24:04,477 --> 01:24:07,063
No, no, I did. I did. Yeah.

1989
01:24:07,105 --> 01:24:08,898
Uh, did you like it?

1990
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:11,234
I-I... I thought it was amazing.

1991
01:24:11,275 --> 01:24:13,236
I-I was really happy for you.

1992
01:24:13,277 --> 01:24:14,612

It was great. It was...

1998
01:24:28,334 --> 01:24:30,336
Social media is exploding.

1999
01:24:30,378 --> 01:24:33,423
It's, uh... They're even saying
you guys are back together.

2000
01:24:33,464 --> 01:24:36,259

it's true, it must be true.

Yeah, no, I'm good.
I'm good. I'm just...

2004
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:48,604
I'm looking at you here,
and it... it all worked out.

2005
01:24:48,646 --> 01:24:51,441
I mean, no one even remembers
the meltdown.

2006
01:24:51,482 --> 01:24:53,526
I know. It's crazy, right?

It's just a song.

01:25:21,095 --> 01:25:22,472
Maybe.

2018
01:25:22,513 --> 01:25:25,516
Maybe it's something more.

2019
01:25:28,019 --> 01:25:29,312
What's going on?

2020
01:25:29,354 --> 01:25:31,105
Look, I know this is a big deal,

2021
01:25:31,147 --> 01:25:33,399
and that's why I wanted
to come down here,

2022
01:25:33,441 --> 01:25:35,234
but I don't fit.

2023
01:25:35,276 --> 01:25:38,321
And I think that's
objectively pretty true.

2024
01:25:38,363 --> 01:25:41,199
- And we don't need to pr...
- So, what are you saying?

2025

Look, if I'm being honest
with myself,

2026

I real...
I really came down here

01:35:52,185 --> 01:35:56,439
I will give anyone $5,000 for
their standby slot to Chicago.

2225
01:35:56,481 --> 01:36:00,276
It's illegal. You can't buy
someone else's ticket.

2226
01:36:00,318 --> 01:36:01,903
- You can't?
- COLIN: Kat.

2227
01:36:01,944 --> 01:36:04,614
Did you know it's illegal
to buy someone else's ticket?

2228
01:36:04,655 --> 01:36:06,616
Uh, yeah. Everyone does.
(chuckles)

2229
01:36:06,657 --> 01:36:08,701
Now, I can't get you a plane,

2230
01:36:08,743 --> 01:36:10,912
but we got you
the last available ticket.

2231
01:36:10,953 --> 01:36:12,163
It's in coach.

2232
01:36:12,205 --> 01:36:13,915
- You're a lifesaver.
- Yeah, yeah.

2233
01:36:13,956 --> 01:36:16,376
Tell me that
after you get there, okay?

2234
01:36:16,417 --> 01:36:19,212
So, there's your passport
and some money.

2235
01:36:19,253 --> 01:36:21,255
Go find your answer.

2236
01:36:24,133 --> 01:36:26,719
- Okay.
- Go on.

2237
01:36:26,761 --> 01:36:28,346
Bye.

2238
01:36:29,931 --> 01:36:31,682
MAN (over intercom):
Ladies and gentlemen, due to

2239
01:36:31,724 --> 01:36:33,393
freezing weather conditions
and some strong headwinds,

2240
01:36:33,434 --> 01:36:35,353
we will be in flight
a little longer than usual,

2241
01:36:35,395 --> 01:36:37,355
but we will get you there
by morning.

2242
01:36:37,397 --> 01:36:39,107
- (passengers groaning)
- Excuse me, miss.

2243
01:36:39,148 --> 01:36:41,651
I'd like to buy champagne
and caviar for the whole flight.

2244
01:36:41,693 --> 01:36:44,362
I'm sorry. We only have
ham wraps, cheese cubes

2245
01:36:44,404 --> 01:36:45,822
and Michelob ULTRA.

2246
01:36:45,863 --> 01:36:48,449
Okay, well, then ham wraps
and Michelob ULTRA.

2247
01:36:48,491 --> 01:36:50,159
(passengers murmuring happily)

2248
01:36:50,201 --> 01:36:52,370
MAN:
What about the cheese cubes?

2249
01:36:52,412 --> 01:36:54,539
Sure.
Cheese cubes, too. Why not?

2250
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:59,419
Um, also, who wants to sell me
a very heavy winter coat?

2251
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:01,003
(timer ticking)

2252
01:37:01,045 --> 01:37:04,674
Uh, the answer is nine?

2253
01:37:04,716 --> 01:37:06,884
- (bell dings)
- That answer is correct.

2254
01:37:06,926 --> 01:37:09,095
- (cheering)
- This round goes to the Coolidge Pi-thons.

2255
01:37:09,137 --> 01:37:10,221
Nice, Esther.

2256
01:37:10,263 --> 01:37:11,597
Good job.

2257
01:37:11,639 --> 01:37:13,725
- Go, Esther!
- (cheering continues)

2258
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:19,731
Where are the people
with the cars?

2259
01:37:19,772 --> 01:37:21,607
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a phone charger?

2260
01:37:21,649 --> 01:37:22,984
- I-I need...
- No. Sorry.

2261
01:37:23,026 --> 01:37:24,110
- PARKER: I do.
- You...

2262
01:37:24,152 --> 01:37:26,195
Colin called me, so...

2263
01:37:26,237 --> 01:37:27,697
Is Charlie here?

2264
01:37:27,739 --> 01:37:30,033
You know, I didn't tell him
I was coming.

2265
01:37:30,074 --> 01:37:33,077
I didn't want to screw with him
on the big day, in case...

2266
01:37:34,037 --> 01:37:36,873
You know, he's not good
with the back-and-forth,

2267
01:37:36,914 --> 01:37:40,293
so I got to ask you, Kat,
are you...

2268
01:37:42,503 --> 01:37:44,839
Is this for real?

2269
01:37:45,715 --> 01:37:47,717
Well, I walked out on Fallon

2270
01:37:47,759 --> 01:37:50,678
to freeze my toes off
in Peoria, so...

2271
01:37:52,805 --> 01:37:54,515
Excellent point.

2272
01:37:54,557 --> 01:37:56,392
I called an Uber.

2273
01:37:57,185 --> 01:37:58,644
47 minutes?

2274
01:37:58,686 --> 01:38:00,021
What?

2275
01:38:00,063 --> 01:38:01,230
We're not gonna make it.

2276
01:38:01,272 --> 01:38:02,690
Didn't they already start?

2277
01:38:02,732 --> 01:38:04,817
Should we hitch a ride?
I don't know what...

2278
01:38:04,859 --> 01:38:07,612
- (tires screeching)
- Wait!

2279
01:38:11,366 --> 01:38:15,411
This woman,
this superstar, this icon,

2280
01:38:15,453 --> 01:38:17,914
has flown in coach in stilettos

2281
01:38:17,955 --> 01:38:20,833
to win back the unlikely
love of her life,

2282
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:24,253
who, against all odds,
she loves.

2283
01:38:24,295 --> 01:38:25,922
And he loves her.

2284
01:38:25,963 --> 01:38:27,215
He does, right?

2285
01:38:27,256 --> 01:38:28,883
Completely.

2286
01:38:28,925 --> 01:38:32,720
The next thing you say will
forecast not just their future

2287
01:38:32,762 --> 01:38:35,264
but the future of-of anyone
who ever believed

2288
01:38:35,306 --> 01:38:37,100
in the magic of a leap of faith.

2289
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:40,103
- Look...
- She'll give you a thousand dollars.

2290
01:38:40,144 --> 01:38:42,522
The answer is 15.

2291
01:38:42,563 --> 01:38:43,940
- (bell dings)
- The answer is correct.

2292
01:38:43,981 --> 01:38:46,192
- Five points, Trinity Numerators.
- Yes!

2293
01:38:46,234 --> 01:38:47,610
Yes! Get 'em!

2294
01:38:48,403 --> 01:38:49,612
Congratulations.

After a break,

2296
01:38:50,947 --> 01:38:52,990
we're moving
to a sudden-death round

2297
01:38:53,032 --> 01:38:54,617
between the
three-time champions,

2298
01:38:54,659 --> 01:38:56,703
- Trinity Numerators...
- NUMERATORS: Yes!

2299
01:38:56,744 --> 01:38:59,497
...and the first-time finalists,
Coolidge Pi-thons.

(excited chatter)

2301
01:39:01,541 --> 01:39:02,625
Sudden death.

2302
01:39:02,667 --> 01:39:04,127
- Ooh. Blast off.
- (chuckling)

2303
01:39:04,168 --> 01:39:08,005
First up, Lou Gilbert
for the Coolidge Pi-thons.

2304
01:39:08,047 --> 01:39:09,716
Choker better pray.

2305
01:39:09,757 --> 01:39:11,467

- Shut up.

(Manny laughing)

2307
01:39:13,553 --> 01:39:15,096
You laughing at that?

2308
01:39:15,138 --> 01:39:16,806
(sighs) Look...

2309
01:39:16,848 --> 01:39:18,808
I don't want to embarrass you.

2310
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:20,476
I know that's your daughter.

2311
01:39:20,518 --> 01:39:22,478
- CHARLIE: Yeah?
- MANNY: I saw her last year.

2312
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:24,355
She's got stage fright.

2313
01:39:24,397 --> 01:39:26,482
My daughter's fine.

2314
01:39:26,524 --> 01:39:28,901
Look, I just think maybe
it would be easier on you

2315
01:39:28,943 --> 01:39:31,195
if you guys
just conceded the title.

2316
01:39:31,237 --> 01:39:32,947
- Concede?
- Mm-hmm.

2317
01:39:32,989 --> 01:39:34,782
- Give you the trophy?
- No.

2318
01:39:34,824 --> 01:39:37,869
It's more like you save
yourself from humiliation.

2319
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:39,579
Huh?

2320
01:39:40,663 --> 01:39:43,207
CHARLIE:
Okay, huddle up. Here we go.

2321
01:39:43,249 --> 01:39:46,794
So, um, Coach Looney Tunes
over there wants to know

2322
01:39:46,836 --> 01:39:49,172
if we just want to concede
and give him the trophy.

2323
01:39:49,213 --> 01:39:51,174
- PI-THONS: No!
- That doesn't even make sense.

2324
01:39:51,215 --> 01:39:52,925
- CHARLIE: Yeah.
- Four in a row, baby.

2325
01:39:52,967 --> 01:39:56,554
How about we go show him
what the Pi-thons are all about?

2326
01:39:56,596 --> 01:39:58,181
PI-THONS:
Yeah!

2327

01:39:59,682 --> 01:40:01,517

You stood up there,

- (laughs)

2393
01:43:06,411 --> 01:43:08,579
- You were great.
- (sobbing)

2394
01:43:09,747 --> 01:43:11,666
Thank you.

2395
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,920
I love you, Dad. (sniffles)

2396
01:43:15,962 --> 01:43:18,131
You were amazing, Lou.

2397
01:43:18,172 --> 01:43:19,632
Really, I mean,

2398
01:43:19,674 --> 01:43:22,009
you took a shot
even though it was scary.

2399
01:43:23,469 --> 01:43:25,096
That's what matters.

2400
01:43:28,433 --> 01:43:31,269
Not everything adds up
the way you think it will.

2401
01:43:34,063 --> 01:43:37,734
You know, they say
if you want something different,

2402
01:43:37,775 --> 01:43:40,194
you have to do
something different.

2403
01:43:41,154 --> 01:43:43,656
What if we're just
too different?

2404
01:43:43,698 --> 01:43:46,242
What if we're not?

2405
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:01,591

2453
01:46:14,307 --> 01:46:16,059
No, we had sex at Burning Man.

2454
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,310
So, Kat made me come
to one of those...

2455
01:46:17,352 --> 01:46:18,811
Um, what are they
called again, babe?

2456
01:46:18,853 --> 01:46:19,979
- It's called a Mathalon, bro.
- Yes!

2457
01:46:20,021 --> 01:46:21,272
Oh, my God, it's so boring.

2458
01:46:21,314 --> 01:46:22,774
And what do you guys
do there again?

2459
01:46:22,815 --> 01:46:23,941
- It's this thing called, um...
- Math.

2460
01:46:23,983 --> 01:46:25,401
- Yes! Oh, my God.
- Yep. Mm-hmm.

2461
01:46:25,443 --> 01:46:26,819
I fell asleep just even
thinking about it, but...

2462
01:46:26,861 --> 01:46:28,196
(laughing):
She did.

2463
01:46:28,237 --> 01:46:30,823
- I-I met my most favorite person here.
- Mm.

2464
01:46:30,865 --> 01:46:32,408
We met at a party
as she was leaving.

2465
01:46:32,450 --> 01:46:33,910
And had I walked out
ten seconds earlier,

2466
01:46:33,951 --> 01:46:35,411
we never would've met.

2467
01:46:35,453 --> 01:46:37,080
And I bet you wish
that was the case sometimes.

2468
01:46:37,121 --> 01:46:39,665
(laughs) Never.

2469
01:46:39,707 --> 01:46:41,459
I had a six-mile radius set,

2470
01:46:41,501 --> 01:46:44,003
and she definitely lived
more than six miles away.

2471
01:46:44,045 --> 01:46:46,005
Well, she wanted
to meet at 4:00 p.m.

2472
01:46:46,047 --> 01:46:47,924
Who meets at 4:00 p.m.?

2473
01:46:47,965 --> 01:46:51,219
When we met,
he was in a unitard.

2474
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:52,970
She liked what she saw.

2475
01:46:53,012 --> 01:46:54,430
(laughing)

2476
01:46:54,472 --> 01:46:57,725
81 years ago, we were born
in the same hospital

2477
01:46:57,767 --> 01:47:00,728
two days apart, in diapers.

2478
01:47:00,770 --> 01:47:03,106
Here it is 81 years later,

2479
01:47:03,147 --> 01:47:05,108
and we're back in diapers again.

2480
01:47:05,149 --> 01:47:07,276
- Oh, Charlie!
- (both laugh)

2481
01:47:07,318 --> 01:47:09,362
We met on a dating app,
but then,

2482
01:47:09,404 --> 01:47:11,406
uh, he invited me
on the second date,

2483
01:47:11,447 --> 01:47:13,700
um, camping in the woods,
and I was like,

2484
01:47:13,741 --> 01:47:15,410
"That seems unsafe...

2485
01:47:15,451 --> 01:47:17,412
- so I'll go."
- Her friend told her not to go.

2486
01:47:17,453 --> 01:47:19,706
Yeah, but she did,
and it's been five years,

2487
01:47:19,747 --> 01:47:21,290
and she's still alive.

2488
01:47:21,332 --> 01:47:22,333
