Hi.

2
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:56,382
Do you have by any chance a guest
under the name of Mrs. Lazar?

3
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:57,493
Lazar?

4
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,659
Dori Lazar.

5
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:00,456
I don't think so.

6
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:01,974
Are you sure?

7
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:03,259
Let me check for you.

8
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:05,136
Yes, check it out, please.

9
00:01:06,744 --> 00:01:09,417
No sir, we don't have a guest
under that name.

10
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,022
Dori!

11
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:03,974
Dori!

12
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:10,614
Dori, don't do it! No!

00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:46,380
Close him up.

21
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:57,495
Dr. Rubin, come with me please,

22
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,224
Lazar from administration
wants to see you.

24
00:05:07,984 --> 00:05:10,737
Can we wake him up?

25
00:05:21,384 --> 00:05:26,094
Lazar, this is Dr. Ben Rubin,
the ideal man for the job.

26
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:28,692
Nice to meet you. Have you
been an intern here for long?

27
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:30,741
For 12 months, in surgery.

28
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:33,099
Have a seat. - Thank you.

29
00:05:34,104 --> 00:05:37,255
Don't we need someone from internal
medicine, Prof. Hissin?

30
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:40,655
Although Dr. Rubin desperately
wants to be a surgeon,

31
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:44,500
If you ask me, he was born
to be in internal medicine.

32
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,378
Nevertheless, I hope you
let me stay in surgery.

33
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:49,540
Dr. Rubin, have you
ever been to India?

34
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,577
India? - Yes.

35
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:55,856
We need a doctor to go there
and examine a sick young woman.

36
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:59,256
She's very ill and we need
a doctor to bring her home.

37
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:02,894
What's wrong with her?
- Hepatitis B, most likely.

38
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:06,456
When am I supposed to leave?
- Immediately.

39
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:09,821
We'll go as soon as the shots
and visas are in order.

40
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:12,737
What do you mean "we"?
- I'm going as well.

41
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,383
It's my daughter, Einat.

42
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:18,133
Her friend got back yesterday
and said it's getting worse.

43
00:06:18,424 --> 00:06:20,813
Will you do it?

44
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:24,056
I'll think about it.

45
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:39,741
Good evening, Dr. Rubin.
- Good evening.

46
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:42,099
Come in, make yourself
at home. - Thank you.

47
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:44,579
I called you earlier
but you weren't in.

48
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,413
I thought it over, Mr. Lazar...
- Call me Abe. - OK, Abe.

49
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:52,372
I hope your passport hasn't
expired. - No, it hasn't,

50
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:56,093
but about the trip... - This is
Michaela, my daughter's friend.

51
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:58,215
She got back from
India two days ago

52
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,181
and told us everything
that's happened.

53
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:03,296
Michaela, meet Dr. Rubin,
who's going with us.

54
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:05,416
Nice to meet you.
- Hi, hi.

55
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,097
Ben. - Michaela.

56
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:10,017
So you were with her
when she got sick?

57
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:13,540
Yes. I'm no expert...
- It's OK.

58
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:16,099
She looks really ill.
- What did you see?

59
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:19,694
Her skin turned yellow,
she lost a lot of weight.

60
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:24,418
Her urine looks like tea,
it's so dark,

61
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,617
and her body is covered with
scratching bruises.

62
00:07:29,544 --> 00:07:32,104
She's really ill.

63
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:36,854
Michaela brought maps. Come
see where we're taking you.

64
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:41,535
Einat is here in Gaya,

65
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:44,696
a holy place, that has
something to do with Buddha.

66
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,662
She's in a hospital there,
or what they call a hospital.

67
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:51,902
Don't mind him, Dr. Rubin.
India is an amazing country.

68
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,779
I'm sure it's fascinating.

69
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:58,378
However, regarding the trip,
I simply can't go.

70
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,375
This is my wife.

71
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:04,016
Dori, this is Dr. Rubin.

72
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:10,301
How do you do.

73
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:14,179
We're very happy you're
joining us, Dr. Rubin.

74
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:19,143
My wife is going with us.
- Is that OK? - Yes...

75
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:21,772
It's none of my business.
The more the merrier.

76
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:23,013
Yes, it's OK.

77
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:25,100
Please, Sit down.

78
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:28,574
We'll fly to Bombay, then
take a train to Varanasi

79
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:32,253
and from there to Gaya.
- Hey, give him a minute.

80
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:36,542
Look, it's a very
flattering offer,

81
00:08:36,664 --> 00:08:40,498
but I only have a month left to
finish my cardiology internship.

82
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:44,375
I thought you were transferring
to the internal ward.

83
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:45,983
Isn't that was Hissin said?

84
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:48,538
Hissin can say
whatever he likes.

85
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:51,258
I'm not leaving surgery.
If it's not at your hospital,

86
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:53,813
there are other hospital,
it's not the end of the world.

87
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:58,017
Why don't you bring us
a drink, maybe some wine.

88
00:08:58,184 --> 00:08:59,742
I'll help.

89
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:04,773
I understand your dilemma,
try to understand our distress.

90
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:07,372
We must bring Einat home.

91
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:10,581
Dr. Hissin says you're
the ideal man for it.

92
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:15,295
We'll pay you generously.
- Money's not the issue.

93
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:17,813
What's so great about me?

94
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,940
That's the third time
I've heard it today.

95
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:21,617
Believe it or not,
Hissin likes you.

96
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:25,134
Yet he doesn't want me
in his ward.

97
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:29,055
Can I show you her picture?
- Yes, please.

98
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:32,939
Our only daughter.

99
00:09:34,024 --> 00:09:36,697
How old is she? - 20.

100
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:43,777
She's very pretty.
- She's very ill.

101
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:57,142
Good morning, Dr. Rubin,
This is Dori Lazar,

102
00:09:57,304 --> 00:10:01,183
I have the tickets. Don't forget
to bring the shots.

103
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:05,934
We leave at 8 o'clock,
we'll be waiting for you. Bye.

104
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:13,572
Are you sure about going
to India, Mrs. Lazar?

105
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:16,897
Didn't we just buy 3 tickets?

106
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:19,812
By the way,
my name is Dori.

107
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:31,174
That one was for typhus,

108
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:35,733
The next one is
for meningitis.

109
00:10:35,904 --> 00:10:39,055
May I have your other arm,
Mrs. Lazar?

110
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:47,373
I hope I didn't hurt you,
Mrs. Lazar.

111
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:50,217
I hope you'll call me Dori.

112
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:52,380
OK, Dori.

113
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:30,383
Ben!

114
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:36,061
Abe, why do we have to
stay in Bombay?

115
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:38,579
Honey, it's 2000 km to Gaya.

116
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:40,257
We have to make a stop
at Varanasi.

117
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:44,337
Then let's go to Varanasi.
- But we missed the flight.

118
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:45,979
We'll never make it to Einat.

119
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:51,537
There's a train to Varanasi
at 8AM, but it takes 20 hours.

120
00:11:51,704 --> 00:11:54,013
We'll have to find a hotel.

121
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:56,695
Do you know a good hotel
in town?

122
00:11:57,224 --> 00:12:00,500
Not a tourist,
just a local hotel, alright?

123
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,579
I'll take the other rickshaw.

124
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:10,820
I hope we don't lose
each other in this crowd.

125
00:12:12,504 --> 00:12:15,177
Look, Abe. Wow!

126
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:16,902
What a sight!

127
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:28,017
This must be the hotel.
- Are you crazy?

128
00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:30,062
If this is the hotel,
I'm not staying here.

129
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:32,824
You wanted a local hotel.

130
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:35,299
Let's see if they have
any rooms available.

131
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,216
Come on, come on.

132
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,499
All those children,
The heat...

133
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:48,894
Welcome to Golden Hotel.
What can I do for you?

134
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:50,059
You could really save us.

135
00:12:50,224 --> 00:12:52,021
Yes, we need two rooms for
one night, please.

136
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:53,896
You have reservations? - No.

137
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,259
Sorry, it's full,
tourist season.

138
00:12:56,424 --> 00:13:03,216
But wait, we have one room,
very small, it's upstairs.

139
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:06,016
Could you please show us
the room?

140
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:07,663
Bell boy will show you up.

141
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:09,343
What about Ben?

142
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:12,462
It's just for one night.
What could happen?

143
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:40,980
Abe, look. It's amazing.
- The world's largest launderette.

144
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:45,862
You amaze me, Dori.
- Do you love me? - Yes.

145
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,140
What's the matter,
is something wrong?

146
00:14:00,784 --> 00:14:04,777
No. Why? - The way
you were looking at us...

147
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:09,935
I don't remember ever seeing
my parents like that.

148
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:12,015
Like what?

149
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:16,054
A couple of teenagers in love.
- We are teenagers in love.

150
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:19,496
Ok, we'll take the room.

151
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:21,694
What about Ben?
Will we all share one bed?

152
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:25,656
Can we have another extra bed?
A cot will do.

153
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:28,384
Yeah, and some sort of screen,
please.

154
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:30,575
I will ask the manager, Mam.

155
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,735
Thank you,
thank you very much.

156
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,178
Don't worry Ben,
We'll be very quiet.

157
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:41,737
No problem.

158
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:49,936
Hi, Ben. - Hi.

159
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:53,454
Where were you?
- Sightseeing. Did I wake you?

160
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:56,536
No, nothing can wake Abe.

161
00:15:57,224 --> 00:16:00,534
I can't sleep,
I'm worried about Einat.

162
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:02,942
What did you see?

163
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:10,823
A market, a famous temple,
hanging gardens.

164
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:15,421
Millions of people
sleeping in the streets.

165
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:18,377
Interesting? - Sad.

166
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,975
I'm very tired,
I want to get some sleep.

167
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:23,738
Good night, Ben.
- Good night.

168
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,860
Abe.

169
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:37,933
Dori, stop it,
We're not alone.

170
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:41,733
I'm so worried,
How can you sleep?

171
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:17,135
Hi. - Hello.

172
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:18,783
Are you on tour
to our country?

173
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:22,135
Not exactly, we have come to bring
our daughter back home.

174
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:23,982
She is very ill.

175
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:26,618
Oh, this is my wife,
this is Dr. Rubin.

176
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:27,854
Hi.

177
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:29,059
Oh, I'm also a pysician.

178
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:32,296
Really? Perhaps your are familiar
with a hospital in Gaya,

179
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:34,142
by any chance?
- I am actually.

180
00:17:34,264 --> 00:17:36,494
Is it a good hospital?
- What's your daughter's problem?

181
00:17:36,664 --> 00:17:38,814
Hepatitis B, apparently.
- Oh my goodness.

182
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:41,782
Seems there is some complication
and secondary infection.

183
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:45,061
In that case may I suggest
that you contact the lab hospital.

184
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,220
But Gaya is not so bad.

185
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:51,775
As long as they have a good lab,
can we trust the results?

186
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:55,181
Well I would suggest that
you contact the lab in Vernasi.

187
00:17:55,304 --> 00:17:58,057
If you need my help,
contact me.

188
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,623
Thank you very much.

189
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:01,859
Are you visiting Gaya?

190
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:05,738
No, me and my brother are returning
to Vernasi from Bombay.

191
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,933
Our father died,
we are taking his body

192
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:11,379
to be cremated
in the river Ganges.

193
00:18:11,544 --> 00:18:13,375
Do you always cremate
your dead?

194
00:18:13,824 --> 00:18:17,055
Well we have to, to help
their souls come back quickly.

195
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:19,818
You see, this body is just
a temporary vessel

196
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:22,100
and must eventually
be disposed of.

197
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:24,255
Exactly, who needs the body,

198
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:26,534
it's just a big pain
in the ass, isn't it?

199
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:29,542
You're a doctor, do you
believe in life after death?

200
00:18:29,664 --> 00:18:33,054
Well I'm a doctor
and I'm a Hindu.

201
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,782
What do you think, Ben?
Is there life after death?

202
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:40,772
The way things are,
there's no life before death.

203
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:52,899
This train's moving
at a snail's pace.

204
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:26,338
Goodbye, you know where to find me
if you need me.

205
00:19:26,504 --> 00:19:28,734
Yeah, yeah, thank you very much,
all the best, doctor.

206
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:30,098
Bye bye.

207
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,096
What's going on?

208
00:19:33,744 --> 00:19:34,938
Conductor!

209
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:36,543
Isn't this train
going on to Gaya?

210
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:39,696
It doesn't look like
it's going anywhere.

211
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:43,018
Vernase Junction!

212
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:47,296
Conductor! Excuse me. - Yes?

213
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:48,903
Doesn't this train
go to Gaya?

214
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:51,659
No! This train goes back
to Bombay.

215
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:52,973
Which train goes to Gaya?

216
00:19:53,144 --> 00:19:55,339
Platform No. 2.

217
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:57,415
Vernasi Junction!

218
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,819
What's going on? - We have to
change trains. Come on.

219
00:20:00,944 --> 00:20:04,254
Porter! We need some help
with our suitcases.

220
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:11,654
Sorry, we're going to Gaya,
you said platform No. 2, right?

221
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:15,823
Tomorrow morning,
8 o'clock. - What?

222
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:20,299
Better hurry and find a hotel,
tourist season, you see.

223
00:20:22,944 --> 00:20:26,175
Come on, let's go.
Follow this lady.

224
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:32,617
Be careful with the lady, right?

225
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:39,336
It's only 6 hours by car.
- Let's take a taxi.

226
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,256
Come on.

227
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:51,701
So this is Gaya?

228
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:03,420
How is she?
Can I see her?

229
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:05,859
They released her a week ago.
- Then where is she?

230
00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:08,936
In a monastery called
Bod-Gaya, in the mountains,

231
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:10,423
20 km away from town.

232
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:13,492
They said there was nothing
else they could do for her

233
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:15,183
and that she was taking
up a bed.

234
00:21:15,344 --> 00:21:17,141
We can assume
one of two things.

235
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:20,062
She either feels much better...
- Or much worse.

236
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:35,339
They threw her out. - Calm down,
Dori, we'll soon find out.

237
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:41,897
Stop.

238
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:00,814
May I help you?

239
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:03,976
Yes, we are looking for our girl
who was brought here 3 days ago.

240
00:22:04,264 --> 00:22:06,220
Oh yes, she's is here.
We've been waiting for you.

241
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:07,777
Come, I'll take her to you.

242
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:17,497
Sir, do you know how is
my daughter? Is she OK?

243
00:22:17,624 --> 00:22:19,262
Come after me,
I'll show you.

244
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:45,419
Please remove your shoes here.

245
00:22:46,544 --> 00:22:48,933
Where is she?
I don't see her.

246
00:23:04,064 --> 00:23:05,975
OK, here is your daughter, Madame.

247
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:07,856
Einati! - Dori, Dori!

248
00:23:08,384 --> 00:23:12,343
It's contagious,
cover your face.

249
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:16,297
And don't touch her.
Don't touch her.

250
00:23:17,944 --> 00:23:19,935
Put the mask on.

251
00:23:22,824 --> 00:23:26,134
Einati, we've come
to take you home.

252
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:30,100
This is Dr. Rubin, he came
especially for you.

253
00:23:32,024 --> 00:23:35,061
Dori, you mustn't touch her.

254
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,856
What's going on? - Let me
examine her. Just one second.

255
00:23:41,024 --> 00:23:44,778
Both of you, let me examine her,
please. Excuse me, Mrs Lazar.

256
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:54,223
Hi, Einat. I'm Dr. Rubin.

257
00:23:55,304 --> 00:23:57,534
I'm going to
examine you now, OK?

258
00:23:58,824 --> 00:24:00,655
Are you running a fever?

259
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:05,533
Let's take a look at your eyes.

260
00:24:06,064 --> 00:24:07,816
Does that hurt?

261
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:10,622
Does this hurt?

262
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:15,018
OK, you're going to be fine.
I'll take care you,

263
00:24:15,184 --> 00:24:17,778
and improve your condition,
I'll stabilize it,

264
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:20,259
and then we'll fly you home, OK?

265
00:24:20,704 --> 00:24:22,899
May I roll up your shirt
a little, Einat?

266
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:26,894
Are you really a doctor?
- Yes, I am.

267
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:30,584
Then you can roll up my shirt.
- OK.

268
00:24:37,624 --> 00:24:42,140
All this is from scratching?
- It's all over my body.

269
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:47,575
This cream will help.
Rub it on every few hours.

270
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,384
Can I draw some blood?

271
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:58,697
She needs to be
taken home right away.

272
00:24:58,824 --> 00:25:00,701
Abe, we brought a doctor
all the way from Tel Aviv,

273
00:25:00,824 --> 00:25:03,418
why don't we hear
what he has to say?

274
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:07,499
She has a very high fever,
Both her liver and kidneys

275
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:08,983
were affected.

276
00:25:09,104 --> 00:25:12,983
I gave her a blood test,
I need urine tests as well.

277
00:25:13,224 --> 00:25:15,294
Go to the bathroom with her.

278
00:25:17,704 --> 00:25:20,662
Tell me the truth Doctor,
how is she?

279
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:23,622
I really can't tell you
till I see the test results,

280
00:25:23,744 --> 00:25:27,100
but you should ask the monks
to find her a room

281
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:29,300
of her own, where she'll be
comfortable, this is no good.

282
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:31,016
I'll take care of it.

283
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:34,534
We have to take you to the
bathroom, hold on to me.

284
00:25:34,904 --> 00:25:36,178
Mom...

285
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:39,263
Yes, darling.
- I want to go home.

286
00:25:39,424 --> 00:25:41,335
Soon darling, soon.

287
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,736
Tea, please?

288
00:25:43,864 --> 00:25:45,820
No. Thank you very much.

289
00:25:48,424 --> 00:25:50,733
I'm Tomaio, I'm from Japan.

290
00:25:51,264 --> 00:25:57,612
I'm Dr. Rubin. May I ask you
Tomaio, what are you doing here?

291
00:25:57,744 --> 00:26:01,419
Come to do "Vispana",
2 weeks seminar of silence.

292
00:26:02,824 --> 00:26:06,373
You came all the way for that?
Can't you be silent in Japan?

293
00:26:06,504 --> 00:26:10,702
Yes, but this is the place
Buhda received enlightenment

294
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:13,292
until he reaches nirvana.

295
00:26:19,184 --> 00:26:21,334
Here's her urine.

296
00:26:21,504 --> 00:26:23,972
OK, they've given us
a bungalow in the garden.

297
00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:43,581
Excuse me, can you take me
to Gaya hospital?

298
00:26:46,224 --> 00:26:47,862
Make it fast please.

299
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:50,416
Is it far from here?

300
00:26:58,264 --> 00:27:01,017
Don't move, OK?
It may take a few hours,

301
00:27:01,144 --> 00:27:03,180
just stay here,
don't move, right?

302
00:27:09,104 --> 00:27:10,981
Excuse me...

303
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:12,703
Please wait in line, sir.

304
00:27:12,824 --> 00:27:15,577
Please just tell me where
I can find the lab, just tell me.

305
00:27:15,744 --> 00:27:17,302
All these people are waiting
for something they want to know,

306
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:18,340
please wait in line.

307
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:22,383
Just show me where I can find the
lab, sorry, sorry, I'm a doctor.

308
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:23,863
Wait in line.

309
00:27:30,464 --> 00:27:33,297
Sir, can you just tell me
where I can find the lab?

310
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,654
I'm lost.

311
00:27:43,784 --> 00:27:46,059
We are all lost.

312
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:50,457
Hi, can you please just
direct me to the lab?

313
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:53,138
Yes, there is a way outside.

314
00:27:53,264 --> 00:27:53,980
Yeah?

315
00:27:54,104 --> 00:27:57,653
And it goes to a garden,
people are waiting there in the line.

316
00:27:57,864 --> 00:28:00,458
You may also be there
one of the line.

317
00:28:00,784 --> 00:28:06,814
Maybe that you'll find your
laboratory, and if not, pray Budha.

318
00:28:07,704 --> 00:28:10,582
He may be there
in the line also.

319
00:28:15,384 --> 00:28:17,500
Please wait for a minute,
can't you hear me?

320
00:28:17,664 --> 00:28:18,858
I said wait for a minute.

321
00:28:19,024 --> 00:28:24,781
Please, sorry, sorry,
excuse me, I'm a doctor.

322
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:27,862
I need to gat some blood
and urine tests.

323
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,298
Excuse me, hi,
I'm a doctor from abroad.

324
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:36,053
I need an urgent report on these
blood and urine samples.

325
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,976
My patient is dying.

326
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:40,100
All the people are
dying here, sir.

327
00:28:40,264 --> 00:28:41,583
Please wait in line.

328
00:28:41,824 --> 00:28:43,416
No, I can't wait.

329
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:45,017
You'll have to.

330
00:28:45,944 --> 00:28:47,662
Look, I'll pay you
for the test,

331
00:28:47,824 --> 00:28:50,941
I'll double the fee you charge
if you just do them immediately.

332
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,574
This is the Budhist hospital
and Budha is the God of the poor,

333
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:56,097
there are no charges here.

334
00:28:56,224 --> 00:28:59,057
Yeah? My patient
is a guest in your country.

335
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:01,618
Just please help me, Madame,
OK, please?

336
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,863
OK, OK, please fill out
this form.

337
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:09,701
And write it down exactly and clearly
which tests you need,

338
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:11,223
then sign it here, OK?

339
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:12,619
OK, yeah.

340
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:15,253
And come back next week
to collect the results.

341
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:16,015
What?

342
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:17,020
Next week...

343
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,253
No, I can't wait till next week,

344
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,892
I'm telling you
my patient is dying.

345
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,094
Then go and tell God Budha...

346
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:25,983
What are you doing, sir?
Sir?

347
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:27,423
I'm going to Vernase, OK?

348
00:29:27,544 --> 00:29:29,500
Vernase is...

349
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:33,338
Shut up! This is hospital,
this is not your home!

350
00:29:38,024 --> 00:29:39,252
How will you get
to Varanasi today?

351
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:42,621
The driver said there are
trains to Varanasi.

352
00:29:42,744 --> 00:29:43,938
He's waiting outside,

353
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:47,540
I think I'll be able to
make it back this evening.

354
00:29:48,544 --> 00:29:51,138
I'm going with you.
- Why? What for?

355
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,780
We don't want to loose
our doctor in India.

356
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:55,417
Really, Dori.

357
00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:59,140
I have to go for
my own peace of mind.

358
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:01,938
I can manage on my own.

359
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:03,935
I'm of no help here,

360
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:06,254
and it's hard for me
to see Einat like this.

361
00:30:06,424 --> 00:30:08,221
What'll I do in the meantime?

362
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:10,899
Rub this cream on
every couple of hours,

363
00:30:11,064 --> 00:30:15,182
It'll relieve the itch.
Make sure she drinks a lot,

364
00:30:15,384 --> 00:30:17,773
Tomaio will help you
in any case.

365
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,094
Shall we go?

366
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:14,256
Can you go to this place, please?

367
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:15,499
Thanks.

368
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,376
Sorry, sorry.

369
00:31:17,904 --> 00:31:19,576
Go, go!

370
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:47,499
Sorry, excuse me please,
thank you.

371
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:56,373
Oh hello, please come inside.
My brother is expecting you.

372
00:32:05,264 --> 00:32:07,858
Please, come in.
My brother is waiting for you.

373
00:32:09,464 --> 00:32:13,935
Oh hello, Welcome, please come in,
Dr. Rubin, please sit down.

374
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:18,253
How is your daughter, Madame?
- I wish we knew.

375
00:32:18,464 --> 00:32:22,059
Yeah, well actually we need
your help, Dr. Sandin,

376
00:32:22,184 --> 00:32:23,981
with some blood and
urine tests,

377
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:25,577
this is urgent.

378
00:32:26,664 --> 00:32:27,779
How much time do you have?

379
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:31,101
Em... we would like to
go back to Gaya tonight. - Yes.

380
00:32:31,264 --> 00:32:33,983
Good, I will need at least
about 6 hours

381
00:32:34,104 --> 00:32:35,173
but your most welcome
to stay here

382
00:32:35,304 --> 00:32:36,498
and wait for the report.

383
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:38,819
Thank you Doctor, I think
we shall walk for a while,

384
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:41,179
is that alright, Ben?
- Yeah, sure.

385
00:32:41,344 --> 00:32:43,096
Yeah, there are so many
places of interest.

386
00:32:43,224 --> 00:32:45,533
You are in India's
holiest city.

387
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:47,416
Vernasi is the city
of the dead.

388
00:32:47,584 --> 00:32:49,256
Doctor, we can thank you enough.

389
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:50,493
Oh, don't mention it.

390
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:52,575
OK, we'll leave you to
your patients,

391
00:32:52,744 --> 00:32:55,019
it looks like you have
at least 100 out there.

392
00:32:55,144 --> 00:32:58,181
Only 100? Then I have
an easy day ahead of me.

393
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,902
Oh my God...
- Thank you, Doctor.

394
00:33:07,024 --> 00:33:08,582
Look at them.

395
00:33:08,704 --> 00:33:11,696
They were born dead, never
having the chance to live.

396
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,816
They're just waiting for Buddha
to redeem them from this life.

397
00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:18,698
Yes, if he exists,
I'd say he's a cruel God,

398
00:33:18,904 --> 00:33:21,657
Just as cruel as our God.

399
00:33:40,944 --> 00:33:42,662
Where do you think
they're going?

400
00:33:42,824 --> 00:33:45,577
To burn the bodies
in the Ganges.

401
00:33:45,784 --> 00:33:47,775
Let's follow them.

402
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:18,133
What's going on?

403
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:20,016
I don't know, a religious rite
or something.

404
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:21,663
Why doesn't anyone help her?
- I don't know.

405
00:34:21,864 --> 00:34:23,536
Let's get out of here.

406
00:34:31,024 --> 00:34:32,742
Dear brother,
Dr. Rubin is here.

407
00:34:33,024 --> 00:34:35,458
Ah yes, Dr. Rubin,
I've been waiting for you.

408
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:36,613
Here are the reports.

409
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:37,654
How is my daughter?

410
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:40,782
Not well I'm afraid,
but not without hope.

411
00:34:41,304 --> 00:34:44,182
It's OK, I'll study them later,
we have to catch our train.

412
00:34:44,344 --> 00:34:45,538
We are very grateful.

413
00:34:45,704 --> 00:34:48,218
So tell me, did you have
a good time in our holy city?

414
00:34:48,384 --> 00:34:51,057
Oh yeah, I mean if you call it
a good time.

415
00:34:51,184 --> 00:34:54,460
We... we saw a woman jumping
onto a funural pire

416
00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:55,977
and burn herself to death.

417
00:34:56,104 --> 00:34:59,380
Oh, a "Sati". You know that was
her husband's funural pire.

418
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:01,899
This still happens in India
although it's against the law.

419
00:35:02,024 --> 00:35:03,980
Why did she do it?
Was she punished?

420
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,140
No, to save another soul.

421
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,260
Another soul,
I don't understand.

422
00:35:08,424 --> 00:35:11,302
Well, she went to Sati because
she didn't want

423
00:35:11,424 --> 00:35:13,096
to have another man in her life.

424
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:16,022
She wants to find the sould
of her husband in Heaven.

425
00:35:16,144 --> 00:35:19,022
As you perhaps know that
Hindus believe in 2nd life.

426
00:35:19,664 --> 00:35:21,382
This was a horrible sight.

427
00:35:21,504 --> 00:35:22,983
I'll pray for your daughter,
Madame.

428
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:24,219
Thank you very much. - OK.

429
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:25,902
All the best, Doctor.

430
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:01,583
How is she doing? - Want
something to eat? - No, thanks.

431
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:04,053
Is Einat asleep?
- I've asked you how she's doing.

432
00:36:04,184 --> 00:36:07,494
I can't tell yet,
I'd better go in.

433
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:09,495
I have to give her
an interferon shot,

434
00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:11,700
and you should prepare
to give her some blood.

435
00:36:11,864 --> 00:36:14,059
As far as I know,
you need my blood.

436
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:15,213
Why, what about his?

437
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:18,535
He's not healthy himself
and has a rare blood type.

438
00:36:18,704 --> 00:36:20,535
What's your blood type?
- O plus.

439
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:22,616
You're sure?

440
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:25,538
OK, let's go in to see her.

441
00:36:45,544 --> 00:36:48,616
How are you feeling?
You'll soon feel much better.

442
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:52,100
When are we going home?
- Soon, really soon.

443
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:55,816
You must get stronger.

444
00:36:55,984 --> 00:37:00,580
I'll give you some of your mother's
blood now, OK? Healthy blood.

445
00:37:01,464 --> 00:37:07,778
Mom, are you really giving me
blood? - Yes darling, I am.

446
00:37:07,904 --> 00:37:10,816
It's time to do it.
Come here, please.

447
00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:15,420
Take off your blouse, Dori.
Let me help you.

448
00:37:16,544 --> 00:37:19,377
Sit down on the bed.

449
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:24,143
Put your arm up here,
lean it against the pillow.

450
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:27,980
It must be high up, you know,
the law of connected vessels.

451
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:45,496
Hello, Air India? I need
to talk to Air India.

452
00:37:46,544 --> 00:37:48,933
Yes, are you closed?

453
00:37:49,104 --> 00:37:51,982
So when are you open?
Tomorrow morning?

454
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,180
OK, thank you, thank you.

455
00:37:54,504 --> 00:37:57,257
Have you ever done this before?
- A direct blood transfusion?

456
00:37:57,424 --> 00:38:00,336
Yes, in the army.
In an emergency.

457
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:01,977
Is this an emergency?

458
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:05,019
We are in battlefield.
- Who is the enemy?

459
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,017
The angel of death.

460
00:38:07,264 --> 00:38:10,540
Mom, what do you think, will
we beat the angel of death?

461
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:14,253
Of course, trust Dr. Rubin.
- I do.

462
00:38:15,304 --> 00:38:19,013
Direct blood transfusions
aren't customary nowadays.

463
00:38:19,224 --> 00:38:21,180
They may even be prohibited.
- You're right sir,

464
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:23,494
but under the circumstances,
I have no choice.

465
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:26,941
How are you feeling, Einat?

466
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:29,854
Like a vampire.

467
00:38:31,064 --> 00:38:34,215
You look fine, ladies.

468
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,256
Some tea, Mr. Lazar?
- No thank you,

469
00:38:41,424 --> 00:38:43,892
I have to go out.
Maybe later.

470
00:38:44,984 --> 00:38:48,613
Are you going somewhere? - Yes,
to Gaya, to organize the tickets.

471
00:38:49,224 --> 00:38:52,261
Do you really think we're
going home today? - Yes.

472
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:54,620
There's a flight tonight
from Bombay to Tel Aviv.

473
00:38:55,144 --> 00:38:56,293
I'll come with you.

474
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:58,739
I want to do some shopping
before we leave India.

475
00:38:58,864 --> 00:38:59,933
OK.

476
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,574
How is Einati this morning?
- Still sleeping, so is the doctor.

477
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:06,020
Good. We'll be back in an hour.

478
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,097
Take care of them Tomaio.
- I will. Bye.

479
00:39:09,304 --> 00:39:10,293
Abe...

480
00:39:21,504 --> 00:39:23,540
It's so beautiful here.

481
00:39:23,704 --> 00:39:27,140
Yes, there's something
about India.

482
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:31,183
This is exactly how
I imagined heaven.

483
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:37,736
Look at all the flowers,
the statues, the smell.

484
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:40,460
After I leave this world,

485
00:39:40,904 --> 00:39:44,453
my soul will look at your photos
and know exactly where to go.

486
00:39:44,664 --> 00:39:48,054
You're not going anywhere.

487
00:39:48,264 --> 00:39:51,142
That's why I'm here, right?
Don't move.

488
00:39:53,064 --> 00:39:55,134
I'm in love with India.

489
00:39:55,304 --> 00:39:57,022
I want to stay forever.

490
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,736
You're feeling much better,
aren't you?

491
00:39:59,824 --> 00:40:01,416
Yes.

492
00:40:01,624 --> 00:40:03,819
Great. - It's as if I was reborn.

493
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:07,215
It's your mother's
blood that's doing that.

494
00:40:08,744 --> 00:40:10,814
Let's sit down a bit.

495
00:40:12,624 --> 00:40:14,615
What do you think about her?

496
00:40:14,784 --> 00:40:16,979
About who? - My mother.

497
00:40:18,824 --> 00:40:20,496
She's great.

498
00:40:21,664 --> 00:40:23,495
She's a wonderful woman.

499
00:40:25,304 --> 00:40:27,738
I think she really likes you.

500
00:40:28,424 --> 00:40:31,177
I think she planned all this
so that we'd meet.

501
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:33,773
I think she's planning
for us to get married.

502
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:37,459
It's good to see you laughing.

503
00:40:37,664 --> 00:40:41,293
But she doesn't understand that
I'll never be like her and Dad.

504
00:40:41,464 --> 00:40:44,297
Their love is boundless,
they're glued to each other

505
00:40:44,504 --> 00:40:47,894
like Siamese twins.
I guess they share one heart.

506
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:49,577
I wish I could love that way.

507
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:59,694
I must be back in Tel Aviv
on Sunday,

508
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,337
for the opening of
the annual conference.

509
00:41:01,464 --> 00:41:03,216
Doctor look, she's bleeding.

510
00:41:03,344 --> 00:41:05,335
Do you have a tissue, Tomaio?
- Yes.

511
00:41:05,624 --> 00:41:07,296
Can you bring
my kit from my room?

512
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:09,136
You know, the blue one. - Yes.

513
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,102
Lay down for a bit.

514
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:15,376
Here. OK. That's it.

515
00:41:15,784 --> 00:41:18,173
Lean your head.
That's it.

516
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:20,943
Hury up, Tomaio.
- What is she doing there?

517
00:41:26,304 --> 00:41:27,783
What's wrong with her?

518
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:31,021
I'm fine. - She has
a nose bleed, that's all.

519
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:34,859
Let's get her back to her room.
Help me, Dori.

520
00:41:35,224 --> 00:41:39,058
Hold the tissue, but don't
touch the blood, careful.

521
00:41:41,504 --> 00:41:45,417
Let's take her back to bed,
just don't touch her blood.

522
00:41:47,624 --> 00:41:50,934
Why did you take her outside?
- For some fresh air,

523
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,379
to prepare her for the trip.

524
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:57,024
I'd better go see
how she's doing.

525
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:14,139
Do you think Einat
can make the trip today?

526
00:42:14,304 --> 00:42:16,898
Today? No. No way.

527
00:42:17,464 --> 00:42:20,501
Tell your husband, Einat
is in no condition to travel.

528
00:42:20,744 --> 00:42:23,622
We're leaving today.
- No, if it's up to me...

529
00:42:23,864 --> 00:42:27,174
We're going home today.
- No, we're not,

530
00:42:27,384 --> 00:42:30,023
but if your husband must go home
today, he can go by himself.

531
00:42:30,144 --> 00:42:31,941
Maybe he's right and
the best thing to do,

532
00:42:32,064 --> 00:42:34,532
is to take Einat to our
hospital right away?

533
00:42:34,664 --> 00:42:37,337
Her condition is critical.
She has a high fever.

534
00:42:37,464 --> 00:42:41,013
The trip could endanger her life.
Don't you understand?

535
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,857
It's dangerous!
- Staying here is dangerous!

536
00:42:44,024 --> 00:42:45,616
OK Dr, listen to me.

537
00:42:45,984 --> 00:42:48,100
I take full responsibility.
She's my daughter.

538
00:42:49,184 --> 00:42:51,857
We're taking her home today
and that's that!

539
00:42:53,024 --> 00:42:56,255
You're making a big mistake.
A very big mistake.

540
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:30,420
Tomaio, don't forget
to write to me, alright?

541
00:43:30,584 --> 00:43:33,178
I'll write to you, bye.

542
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,981
Miss Einat, go with
the blessings of Budha.

543
00:44:05,384 --> 00:44:07,818
Einat. Einat.

544
00:44:08,424 --> 00:44:09,823
Can you just take...

545
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:12,134
take the snake
and just go away, please.

546
00:44:12,304 --> 00:44:15,979
Einat! - What's happening to her?

547
00:44:17,344 --> 00:44:20,381
We must stop this insane journey
before it's too late...

548
00:44:20,544 --> 00:44:23,502
I must give her another
blood transfusion, now!

549
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:26,815
Then take charge, you're
the doctor. You decide.

550
00:44:28,504 --> 00:44:31,462
The tickets. We got an upgrade.

551
00:44:31,664 --> 00:44:32,779
What happened?

552
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:35,575
Can I have a word with you?

553
00:44:37,184 --> 00:44:38,253
What are you doing, Lazar?

554
00:44:38,424 --> 00:44:40,016
Do you want to kill
Your own daughter?

555
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,336
Your daughter will die today if
I don't give her a transfusion.

556
00:44:43,464 --> 00:44:45,261
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

557
00:44:45,424 --> 00:44:47,016
Why did you drag me
all the way to India

558
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,981
if you don't listen
to a word I say?

559
00:44:49,184 --> 00:44:50,822
What do you suggest we do,
Dr. Rubin?

560
00:44:50,984 --> 00:44:52,133
Take her to a hospital
in Bombay?

561
00:44:52,304 --> 00:44:54,943
A hospital, whatever,
let's find a hotel room

562
00:44:55,064 --> 00:44:56,258
and I'll give her
the transfusion there.

563
00:44:56,424 --> 00:44:58,779
Then she must rest
for at least 24 hours.

564
00:44:59,584 --> 00:45:01,097
OK, I'll find a hotel.

565
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:02,902
Abe...

566
00:45:03,144 --> 00:45:05,897
Listen to me.
Get on the flight.

567
00:45:06,024 --> 00:45:07,901
I know you have to
attend your conference.

568
00:45:08,064 --> 00:45:09,816
People are coming from
all over the world.

569
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:11,900
We'll come in a day or two.

570
00:45:12,104 --> 00:45:14,618
Dad, get on the flight.
I'll be fine.

571
00:45:14,824 --> 00:45:17,543
Here are your tickets.

572
00:45:22,104 --> 00:45:23,617
Bye.

573
00:45:24,664 --> 00:45:26,859
Take care of them, Ben.

574
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:29,499
They're both in your hands.

575
00:45:30,544 --> 00:45:32,182
Call me.

576
00:45:35,904 --> 00:45:37,496
Abe.

577
00:45:51,264 --> 00:45:52,743
Hello?

578
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:56,374
Hi, it's me.
What are you doing? - Hi.

579
00:45:57,064 --> 00:45:59,658
I fell asleep.

580
00:46:00,904 --> 00:46:02,940
Join me downstairs,
I'm in the lobby.

581
00:46:03,504 --> 00:46:05,540
How's Einat?

582
00:46:06,144 --> 00:46:08,704
She's asleep. I think she's feeling
much better now.

583
00:46:09,664 --> 00:46:11,734
That's great.

584
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:16,221
Are you coming down or must
I go see Bombay without you?

585
00:46:42,584 --> 00:46:44,700
Can we have something
to drink?

586
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:49,583
Thanks.

587
00:46:54,504 --> 00:46:55,175
Thank you.

588
00:46:55,304 --> 00:46:56,896
How much?

589
00:47:23,824 --> 00:47:26,179
My head is spinning.

590
00:47:27,584 --> 00:47:29,381
But let's have
another glass of wine.

591
00:47:29,544 --> 00:47:33,332
No, not for me.
I can't drink anymore.

592
00:47:33,464 --> 00:47:35,216
Come on.

593
00:47:38,864 --> 00:47:40,263
Here?

594
00:47:43,064 --> 00:47:45,020
A glass of your
best red wine, please.

595
00:47:45,344 --> 00:47:47,221
Take it easy.

596
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:50,932
I like it when
my head is spinning.

597
00:47:51,184 --> 00:47:53,254
OK, I'll have
another one too.

598
00:47:53,424 --> 00:47:55,984
Make it 2 please.
- Of course, Madame.

599
00:48:03,624 --> 00:48:05,057
Thank you.

600
00:48:13,944 --> 00:48:16,378
Won't you ask me to dance?

601
00:48:16,624 --> 00:48:18,819
Would you like me to?

602
00:48:18,984 --> 00:48:20,702
God, you're acting
like a baby.

603
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:23,332
Isn't that how you
want me to act? - No.

604
00:48:24,904 --> 00:48:27,213
I want you to act
just as your eyes express

605
00:48:27,344 --> 00:48:29,062
when you're looking at me.

606
00:48:29,224 --> 00:48:33,012
Oh no, you're reading
in my eyes now.

607
00:48:33,464 --> 00:48:36,615
Can't I hide anything
from you? - No...

608
00:48:37,704 --> 00:48:40,821
You can't.
Come on, let's dance.

609
00:48:40,944 --> 00:48:42,582
My head is spinning...

610
00:49:05,624 --> 00:49:10,095
Why don't you kiss me?
I know you want to.

611
00:49:14,944 --> 00:49:18,983
Are you sure you want me
to kiss you? - Yes.

612
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:25,583
Everyone can see us.

613
00:49:26,384 --> 00:49:29,615
So what?
Do we know them?

614
00:49:31,944 --> 00:49:33,662
Kiss me.

615
00:50:23,944 --> 00:50:27,300
India. What a strange place.

616
00:50:29,184 --> 00:50:32,699
Remember the woman who jumped
in the fire at the Ganges?

617
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,659
I can't get it
out of my head.

618
00:50:37,024 --> 00:50:40,619
Remember what the Indian doctor
told us about that ritual?

619
00:50:40,784 --> 00:50:43,059
Sati, That's what
they call it.

620
00:50:43,184 --> 00:50:46,540
I keep asking myself,

621
00:50:46,704 --> 00:50:47,739
what exactly did he mean

622
00:50:47,904 --> 00:50:50,372
when he said
she was saving her soul.

623
00:50:50,864 --> 00:50:53,662
Maybe she didn't want
to stay alone in this hell

624
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,414
without the man she loved.

625
00:50:58,384 --> 00:51:00,500
It was so sad.

626
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,661
I feel as if it was me
burning in that fire.

627
00:51:09,824 --> 00:51:11,735
Dori...

628
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:15,896
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

629
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:45,016
Slow down, Ben.
We have all night.

630
00:51:46,424 --> 00:51:49,177
We only have
what's left of it.

631
00:53:27,024 --> 00:53:29,857
Mrs. Lazar,
I'll take it from here.

632
00:53:30,024 --> 00:53:33,539
Wait, here's her medical report.
- I don't need it.

633
00:53:39,224 --> 00:53:40,543
When will I see you?

634
00:53:40,704 --> 00:53:44,094
I don't know,
call me at the office.

635
00:53:46,104 --> 00:53:48,379
Come on, Dori,
get in the ambulance.

636
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:55,176
Ben, take a few days off.
You need them. - Yes.

637
00:53:55,584 --> 00:53:59,497
What about Einat? - Prof. Levine
will take care her.

638
00:53:59,744 --> 00:54:02,542
Thank you very much. Bye.

639
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,383
This is Dr. Rubin speaking.

640
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:16,735
May I please speak
with Attorney Lazar?

641
00:54:19,264 --> 00:54:21,937
Yes, she has my number.

642
00:54:23,304 --> 00:54:24,817
Thank you.

643
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:29,823
This is
Dr. Ben Rubin speaking.

644
00:54:30,224 --> 00:54:32,863
Yes, I already left a message
this morning, that's right.

645
00:54:33,064 --> 00:54:36,420
Can you ask her to call me
on my mobile phone?

646
00:54:36,624 --> 00:54:38,023
Yes, she has the number.

647
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:42,456
There you are. Our hero.
How was your vacation?

648
00:54:42,584 --> 00:54:45,576
Good. How's Einat? - Fine.

649
00:54:45,704 --> 00:54:48,218
Thanks to Prof. Levine's
wonderful treatment.

650
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:50,579
Go visit her.
She'll be happy to see you.

651
00:54:55,344 --> 00:55:00,179
Dr. Rubin, how was India? We heard
how well you did. - Thank you.

652
00:55:00,544 --> 00:55:02,341
Thank you very much.

653
00:55:05,064 --> 00:55:07,703
Prof. Hissin,
may I have a word?

654
00:55:07,864 --> 00:55:09,377
Hello, Dr. Rubin,
you're back?

655
00:55:09,504 --> 00:55:12,064
I heard you worked wonders in India.

656
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,379
I'm glad I recommended you
for the trip.

657
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:15,863
Professor, can we meet today?

658
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:18,743
Not today, I'm busy.
- When, then? - I said I was busy.

659
00:55:39,104 --> 00:55:42,540
Mrs. Lazar, there's a young man
heading towards your office.

660
00:55:42,704 --> 00:55:45,537
He doesn't have an appointment.
- OK, I'll handle it.

661
00:55:47,864 --> 00:55:50,617
Ben! What a surprise.

662
00:55:51,664 --> 00:55:54,656
Sorry for sneaking in
your office without notice.

663
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:57,173
I left you a million messages.

664
00:55:59,224 --> 00:56:03,422
I got them. I had many things
to attend to after the trip.

665
00:56:03,584 --> 00:56:07,543
You're ignoring me. It's been
3 weeks since I last saw you.

666
00:56:08,344 --> 00:56:11,541
Was there something important
you wanted to tell me? Sit down.

667
00:56:16,944 --> 00:56:18,423
The truth.

668
00:56:19,704 --> 00:56:22,138
And you think
I don't know the truth?

669
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:26,019
This can't go on.
That's the truth. - Is it?

670
00:56:26,464 --> 00:56:29,581
Even if I think about you
every minute of every day?

671
00:56:30,264 --> 00:56:33,813
Even if I realized
how much you mean to me?

672
00:56:35,384 --> 00:56:38,182
Look, Ben, this is all
very flattering,

673
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:40,855
but where does it lead?

674
00:56:41,224 --> 00:56:43,294
I don't care where it leads,

675
00:56:43,464 --> 00:56:46,581
I just know that my life
is empty without you.

676
00:56:48,744 --> 00:56:52,214
Look, I didn't want it
to happen in India.

677
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:57,175
But it happened.
It got our of control.

678
00:56:57,544 --> 00:56:59,739
And since that night, I...

679
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:03,024
I want you and
I don't want you.

680
00:57:03,184 --> 00:57:04,697
I'm so confused.

681
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:07,332
I want you, Dori,
I've missed you.

682
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:12,499
Ben, we can't.
It's wrong.

683
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:18,182
I don't understand how you managed
to sneak into my marriage.

684
00:57:19,824 --> 00:57:22,463
But I'm just as
guilty as you are.

685
00:57:22,584 --> 00:57:24,381
I could've stopped it
that night.

686
00:57:24,544 --> 00:57:27,058
No, you couldn't have,
just as I couldn't.

687
00:57:27,504 --> 00:57:31,417
Ben, you have to find
a woman your own age.

688
00:57:31,584 --> 00:57:34,052
You have to get married,
build a home,

689
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:37,938
a family, have children.
That's the way of the world.

690
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:42,618
I hate this world.

691
00:57:42,784 --> 00:57:46,493
Ben, nothing's changed
between Abe and I.

692
00:57:46,784 --> 00:57:50,299
I do love you,
But I can't live without Abe.

693
00:57:50,424 --> 00:57:52,574
You love him? - Of course.

694
00:57:53,024 --> 00:57:55,094
How can you love him and me
at the same time?

695
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:57,653
I don't know, but I do.

696
00:57:58,064 --> 00:58:01,420
Mrs. Lazar, Mr. Greenberg's here.
- Just a moment.

697
00:58:02,704 --> 00:58:05,093
I have a meeting,
you must leave.

698
00:58:07,144 --> 00:58:08,702
I'm begging you.

699
00:58:09,264 --> 00:58:12,495
OK Dori, what do you expect me
to do with my life?

700
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:15,741
Mr. Greenberg?

701
00:58:18,824 --> 00:58:21,099
Thank you for coming,
Dr. Rubin.

702
00:58:28,824 --> 00:58:31,577
And don't forget to find
the girl we talked about.

703
00:58:31,744 --> 00:58:34,622
Come in, Mr. Greenberg.

704
00:58:50,784 --> 00:58:53,218
Hi. - Hi.

705
00:58:54,104 --> 00:58:55,332
It's you.

706
00:58:55,504 --> 00:58:56,857
Ben Rubin, remember?

707
00:58:57,024 --> 00:58:59,333
Of course, Dr. Ben Rubin.

708
00:58:59,784 --> 00:59:04,414
You're back from India?
- 3 weeks ago, with Einat.

709
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:07,178
I know,
I saw her this morning.

710
00:59:07,904 --> 00:59:09,815
When do you get off work?

711
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:11,662
In an hour.

712
00:59:12,184 --> 00:59:14,459
I'd love a ride home.

713
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:19,653
Great. - Great. See you then.

714
00:59:20,464 --> 00:59:22,136
Where are we going?

715
00:59:22,264 --> 00:59:25,973
To Jaffa. There's an isolated
Beach, where we can be alone.

716
00:59:26,184 --> 00:59:28,493
You want to be alone with me?

717
00:59:29,064 --> 00:59:32,374
I didn't bring a swimsuit.
- Neither did I.

718
00:59:47,944 --> 00:59:52,017
What else did Einat tell you?
- That you saved her life.

719
00:59:52,904 --> 00:59:56,897
That's all she said?
- You saved her from her parents.

720
00:59:57,064 --> 00:59:59,453
What do you mean?
I don't get it.

721
00:59:59,784 --> 01:00:02,776
You spent a week with them,
you should understand.

722
01:00:02,944 --> 01:00:05,253
Didn't you the kind of
relationship they have?

723
01:00:06,224 --> 01:00:08,784
They love each other very much,
is that what you mean?

724
01:00:10,104 --> 01:00:13,494
It's not love,
It's an obsession.

725
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:17,577
An obsession.

726
01:00:17,984 --> 01:00:22,102
An obsession. It's better
than what I saw growing up.

727
01:00:22,264 --> 01:00:25,017
My parents barely
touched each other.

728
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:27,222
The last time
my mother hugged me,

729
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:29,984
I was about 5 years old.

730
01:00:36,784 --> 01:00:38,934
Good morning.

731
01:00:40,984 --> 01:00:42,497
Good morning.

732
01:00:43,544 --> 01:00:46,616
Where are you going?
- To make some coffee.

733
01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:49,020
I'd love some.

734
01:00:58,144 --> 01:00:59,099
Hello?

735
01:00:59,384 --> 01:01:02,581
Where are you? I was
calling you all evening.

736
01:01:02,744 --> 01:01:06,703
I'm out of town.
Is there something wrong?

737
01:01:06,904 --> 01:01:10,055
I miss you, Ben.
Did I call at a bad time?

738
01:01:10,184 --> 01:01:12,061
No, it's fine.

739
01:01:12,224 --> 01:01:15,614
I couldn't sleep all night.
- Where are you? - At home.

740
01:01:15,784 --> 01:01:18,662
I took the day off,
I was hoping to see you.

741
01:01:24,864 --> 01:01:32,703
There's an emergency,
they couldn't find anyone...

742
01:01:32,864 --> 01:01:35,936
Do you want your coffee,
or prefer to leave right away?

743
01:01:36,384 --> 01:01:39,421
Would you mind
if we went home?

744
01:01:58,944 --> 01:02:01,981
I never felt like this.
- Like what?

745
01:02:02,784 --> 01:02:04,615
Happy.

746
01:02:04,864 --> 01:02:07,173
I'm worried.
- What about?

747
01:02:07,344 --> 01:02:11,053
That I'll call you tomorrow
and you'll tell me it's over.

748
01:02:14,024 --> 01:02:16,584
Anything can happen.

749
01:02:21,224 --> 01:02:24,899
Dori, don't play games.

750
01:02:27,024 --> 01:02:30,699
This is so hard. Suddenly
everything's so complicated.

751
01:02:35,304 --> 01:02:40,139
I loved one man for 25 years.
I was never with anyone else.

752
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:42,494
Suddenly you show up,

753
01:02:42,664 --> 01:02:45,861
and my whole world
turns upside down.

754
01:02:46,624 --> 01:02:48,296
Falls apart.

755
01:02:49,384 --> 01:02:51,181
What about you?

756
01:02:51,304 --> 01:02:55,297
Me? - What about Michaela?
- Michaela?

757
01:02:56,224 --> 01:02:58,977
Einat told me.
I'm not jealous.

758
01:02:59,104 --> 01:03:03,814
Michaela is a wonderful girl.
Einat's alive thanks to her.

759
01:03:04,064 --> 01:03:08,216
Yeah, she really is a wonderful girl.

760
01:03:08,344 --> 01:03:10,335
Then why aren't you with her?

761
01:03:12,384 --> 01:03:14,181
You know why.

762
01:03:15,104 --> 01:03:21,976
She's what you need. Pretty,
young, she can have kids,

763
01:03:22,144 --> 01:03:25,580
she won't get wrinkled
like me, in a few years.

764
01:03:25,704 --> 01:03:29,174
Why did you call me? To say
I can be with Michaela?

765
01:03:29,424 --> 01:03:33,861
I called because I miss you.
I wanted you to touch me.

766
01:03:36,704 --> 01:03:39,093
I was suffocating without you.

767
01:03:39,224 --> 01:03:41,897
That's exactly how I feel
when I don't see you,

768
01:03:42,504 --> 01:03:44,495
or when you won't listen to
what I'm going through.

769
01:03:44,664 --> 01:03:46,461
Don't be mad, Ben.
- I'm not mad,

770
01:03:46,584 --> 01:03:49,098
it drives me crazy, Dori.

771
01:03:49,544 --> 01:03:52,820
I hear your voice and
come running like an idiot.

772
01:03:52,984 --> 01:03:55,020
Do you know where I was
when you called?

773
01:03:55,224 --> 01:03:57,977
With Michaela.
- Yes, with Michaela.

774
01:03:58,104 --> 01:04:01,380
I hear your voice and
come running like a madman.

775
01:04:02,224 --> 01:04:04,897
OK, now what? Tell me.

776
01:04:05,704 --> 01:04:09,936
You're in charge, directing
my life. What happens next?

777
01:04:10,224 --> 01:04:14,900
You go on with your life,
having nothing to do with me.

778
01:04:52,544 --> 01:04:56,617
Is this how it's going to be?
You come, take me someplace,

779
01:04:57,104 --> 01:05:02,053
we have sex, what's next?
- Want to move in with me?

780
01:05:02,704 --> 01:05:04,615
To your apartment?

781
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:11,578
I have to think about it.

782
01:05:26,544 --> 01:05:29,217
Michaela? - What?

783
01:05:30,704 --> 01:05:33,582
Do you believe in reincarnation?

784
01:05:34,544 --> 01:05:38,617
Why do you ask?
- Just curious.

785
01:05:40,024 --> 01:05:44,142
You're the doctor.
Do you believe in reincarnation?

786
01:05:44,264 --> 01:05:48,735
I used to think the soul
was a mere fabrication,

787
01:05:49,184 --> 01:05:52,859
a yearning for the eternal,
a search for spirituality.

788
01:05:53,184 --> 01:05:58,133
Since I became a "soul pilot"
I'm confused.

789
01:05:58,504 --> 01:06:02,099
Come to me,
my soul pilot.

790
01:06:02,304 --> 01:06:04,943
You're a confused doctor,
prepare for landing.

791
01:06:15,384 --> 01:06:17,739
Do you like my apartment?

792
01:06:19,744 --> 01:06:21,382
It's nice.

793
01:06:22,064 --> 01:06:23,816
Intimate.

794
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:25,383
That's it?

795
01:06:25,504 --> 01:06:28,018
It's quiet, pleasant.

796
01:06:28,744 --> 01:06:31,099
What does that mean?
- It's a nice apartment.

797
01:06:31,224 --> 01:06:35,058
Yes, but what does it mean?
Will you move in or not?

798
01:06:36,264 --> 01:06:39,142
Can I think about it?
- OK, start now.

799
01:06:39,384 --> 01:06:42,296
Come on,
I need some time.

800
01:06:42,424 --> 01:06:45,336
Yes or no? - I won't say.
- What does that mean?

801
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:48,263
Yes or no?
- Leave me alone.

802
01:06:49,344 --> 01:06:51,016
Are you OK?

803
01:06:52,024 --> 01:06:53,423
It hurts.

804
01:06:54,584 --> 01:06:55,983
It hurts.

805
01:06:56,784 --> 01:06:58,775
It feels good.

806
01:07:05,984 --> 01:07:08,100
"Soraski Medical Center,
Tel Aviv"

807
01:07:08,264 --> 01:07:09,856
Ladies and Gentlemen.

808
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:13,499
We are hear tonight, to honor
and thank the Gershon Family

809
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:15,661
for their exceptionally
generous donation

810
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:19,021
which has enabled us
to open our new ward

811
01:07:19,144 --> 01:07:21,863
for Lupus and blood diseases.

812
01:07:29,584 --> 01:07:32,303
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It gives me great pleasure

813
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:36,975
to introduce to you,
Mr. And Mrs. Charles Gershon.

814
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:43,463
Mr. Charles Gershon, please.

815
01:07:48,224 --> 01:07:49,896
Ladies and Gentlemen...

816
01:07:55,064 --> 01:07:58,943
How are you? I haven't
seen you in... - 4 weeks.

817
01:07:59,464 --> 01:08:02,217
I'm also counting the days.
Are you OK?

818
01:08:02,784 --> 01:08:05,821
Yes, I'm fine. - And Einat?

819
01:08:06,184 --> 01:08:08,175
She's back home,

820
01:08:08,344 --> 01:08:11,302
but she's moving to Jerusalem,
to study Psychology.

821
01:08:12,024 --> 01:08:14,777
That's great,
I'm happy for her.

822
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:18,741
We're very grateful for
what you did for her.

823
01:08:19,184 --> 01:08:21,778
Abe is also convinced
you saved her.

824
01:08:22,024 --> 01:08:23,696
Abe is a wonderful man.

825
01:08:24,024 --> 01:08:28,176
He's a lucky man, Dori.
I wish I was Abe.

826
01:08:32,184 --> 01:08:34,414
What's going on in there?

827
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,462
What's going on?

828
01:08:45,744 --> 01:08:48,861
Give him some room!
Let him breathe!

829
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:52,018
Mom, it's Dad!

830
01:09:08,664 --> 01:09:10,495
Why the urgency to operate?

831
01:09:10,664 --> 01:09:14,452
There are rhythm disruptions,
as a result of ischemia.

832
01:09:14,664 --> 01:09:17,019
Are we sure?
- Yes, we are sure.

833
01:09:17,184 --> 01:09:19,175
His pulse is irregular,
he's about to go into VF.

834
01:09:19,304 --> 01:09:21,374
Shouldn't we stabilize
him first? - Don't interfere.

835
01:09:21,504 --> 01:09:25,417
We all think we should
operate immediately.

836
01:09:26,544 --> 01:09:29,012
I'm removing a vein
from his right leg.

837
01:09:34,624 --> 01:09:36,421
We're ready. - Go ahead.

838
01:09:36,624 --> 01:09:38,501
Cover.

839
01:09:43,024 --> 01:09:44,662
Scalpel.

840
01:09:47,824 --> 01:09:49,382
6:30, cutting skin.

841
01:10:00,504 --> 01:10:02,654
Is everything OK,
Dr. Rubin?

842
01:10:03,384 --> 01:10:05,375
Yes, everything's fine.

843
01:10:07,064 --> 01:10:09,862
Hissin, look.

844
01:10:10,024 --> 01:10:11,423
Fibrillation.

845
01:10:11,584 --> 01:10:13,336
Defibrillator.

846
01:10:15,104 --> 01:10:16,059
Gel.

847
01:10:18,304 --> 01:10:20,534
Unsynchronized 300,
stand clear.

848
01:10:21,864 --> 01:10:23,297
Fibrillation.

849
01:10:23,464 --> 01:10:24,692
Gel.

850
01:10:26,464 --> 01:10:29,103
Unsynchronized 360,
stand clear.

851
01:10:30,104 --> 01:10:32,334
Fibrillation.
- Let me try. - Move!

852
01:10:32,504 --> 01:10:35,257
You're losing him,
let me do it! - I said move!

853
01:10:36,384 --> 01:10:39,057
Unsynchronized 360,
stand clear.

854
01:10:40,344 --> 01:10:41,982
Fibrillation.

855
01:10:42,464 --> 01:10:45,058
It's no use.
He's brain-dead.

856
01:10:45,264 --> 01:10:46,777
360!

857
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:52,937
Fibrillation. - Come on,
Lazar! Come on! 360!

858
01:10:55,664 --> 01:10:59,134
Fibrillation. - Come on, Lazar! 360!

859
01:11:00,104 --> 01:11:02,743
It's no use, Lazar is gone.

860
01:12:17,784 --> 01:12:19,820
What's going on?

861
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:24,741
What's come over you?
- Nothing. - You're lying.

862
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:30,942
Do you want to tell me
what's come over you?

863
01:12:31,144 --> 01:12:35,183
This whole Lazar thing,
the bypass was unnecessary.

864
01:12:35,344 --> 01:12:37,858
You can't be sure.

865
01:12:39,144 --> 01:12:41,260
I'm sure.

866
01:12:42,864 --> 01:12:45,697
I've known everything about
heart surgery since childhood.

867
01:12:45,864 --> 01:12:49,095
I was there, he shouldn't
have been operated.

868
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:53,223
But all Prof. Hissin ever
thinks about is his reputation,

869
01:12:53,384 --> 01:12:54,976
the department's reputation,
he has to operate,

870
01:12:55,144 --> 01:12:57,055
even if it's unnecessary.

871
01:12:57,224 --> 01:12:59,897
Lazar died of internal bleeding.

872
01:13:02,584 --> 01:13:06,862
We killed him.
- It doesn't matter anymore...

873
01:13:07,104 --> 01:13:10,255
It makes no difference
to Lazar. It doesn't matter.

874
01:13:10,704 --> 01:13:13,264
What'll happen to Dori?

875
01:13:13,424 --> 01:13:15,016
Who will take care of her,
he did everything for her,

876
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:16,697
she doesn't know how to do
the simplest things,

877
01:13:16,864 --> 01:13:20,459
like using a washing machine,
things we do every day,

878
01:13:20,584 --> 01:13:23,576
she knows nothing,
poor thing. - Ben...

879
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:33,534
I'm going out for
some fresh air.

880
01:13:40,304 --> 01:13:42,454
Ben? - What?

881
01:13:44,464 --> 01:13:45,977
Nothing.

882
01:13:46,624 --> 01:13:48,421
Go for some fresh air.

883
01:14:31,064 --> 01:14:33,134
Dori?

884
01:15:03,304 --> 01:15:04,942
What are you doing here?

885
01:15:05,104 --> 01:15:08,301
I was afraid you were
left alone. Is Einat here?

886
01:15:08,464 --> 01:15:10,932
No, she went back to Jerusalem,

887
01:15:11,104 --> 01:15:13,493
to study for her exams.

888
01:15:16,344 --> 01:15:18,460
Are you OK?

889
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:20,253
I don't know.

890
01:15:20,424 --> 01:15:22,699
You have a fever,
you should be in bed.

891
01:15:22,864 --> 01:15:25,094
Let's go upstairs.

892
01:15:30,424 --> 01:15:33,734
I haven't seen you since
the mourning period.

893
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:37,499
I'm here now and
you won't get rid of me.

894
01:15:44,504 --> 01:15:46,699
What'll happen to you, Dori?

895
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:52,175
What'll happen to us?
- I don't know.

896
01:15:54,464 --> 01:15:57,501
All I want to do is sleep.

897
01:15:57,944 --> 01:15:59,980
I just want to sleep.

898
01:16:01,504 --> 01:16:06,624
Shall I give you a pill?
- No, Ben, go home.

899
01:16:07,144 --> 01:16:09,419
I'm groggy.

900
01:16:10,384 --> 01:16:12,215
I want to sleep.

901
01:16:12,384 --> 01:16:16,013
I'll make you a cup of tea.
You must drink.

902
01:16:16,184 --> 01:16:18,220
I'll make you a cup of tea.

903
01:17:47,104 --> 01:17:50,983
I thought you left.
- No, I'm still here.

904
01:17:51,144 --> 01:17:54,022
You should go home, Ben.
You should be with Michaela.

905
01:17:54,184 --> 01:17:56,937
No, I should be with you.

906
01:17:57,704 --> 01:18:00,218
Did you know that nothing
works in your kitchen?

907
01:18:00,424 --> 01:18:05,100
The gas... - You shouldn't
leave her alone.

908
01:18:05,344 --> 01:18:09,496
She understands, she went
to sleep a couple of hours ago.

909
01:18:10,624 --> 01:18:13,092
Take this pill.

910
01:18:20,024 --> 01:18:22,857
You know,
Abe liked you very much.

911
01:18:23,544 --> 01:18:26,058
He always said
you'd go places.

912
01:18:28,144 --> 01:18:31,261
I'm completely bleary now.

913
01:18:31,464 --> 01:18:34,262
Go to sleep.

914
01:18:34,624 --> 01:18:37,696
You'll feel better
in the morning.

915
01:19:18,904 --> 01:19:21,134
Abe...

916
01:19:23,104 --> 01:19:25,777
How will I manage
without you, Abe?

917
01:19:32,504 --> 01:19:34,859
What will I do
with your Dori?

918
01:19:52,224 --> 01:19:56,740
Talk to me, before I...

919
01:20:00,544 --> 01:20:04,093
I was sure you know
what happened in India.

920
01:21:01,104 --> 01:21:02,981
Mom?

921
01:21:04,984 --> 01:21:06,702
Mom...

922
01:21:19,144 --> 01:21:21,180
Einat, what are you
doing here this late?

923
01:21:21,344 --> 01:21:24,097
I called but you didn't answer,
I thought something happened.

924
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:26,784
I thought you were sick.
I guess I was wrong.

925
01:21:26,944 --> 01:21:29,902
Wait, I want to talk to you.
- I have nothing to say to you.

926
01:21:30,064 --> 01:21:33,215
Let me explain. - You're wearing
my father's robe! - Wait...

927
01:21:50,384 --> 01:21:51,783
Hi.

928
01:21:53,624 --> 01:21:57,060
I was sleeping...
I guess I fell asleep.

929
01:21:57,224 --> 01:22:00,819
I called, but you didn't answer.
You must've also fallen asleep,

930
01:22:00,984 --> 01:22:03,020
that's why you didn't answer.

931
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:05,778
I couldn't leave,
she's in an awful state.

932
01:22:05,984 --> 01:22:08,373
What a mess. Nothing works,

933
01:22:08,544 --> 01:22:10,455
a grown woman who can't manage...

934
01:22:10,624 --> 01:22:13,218
I see you shaved.

935
01:22:13,384 --> 01:22:15,659
Yes, you noticed?

936
01:22:16,864 --> 01:22:18,855
Are you growing a moustache?

937
01:22:19,024 --> 01:22:22,255
Dori fell asleep,
so I had some time...

938
01:22:22,464 --> 01:22:24,056
Did you sleep with her?
- What?

939
01:22:24,264 --> 01:22:26,732
Did you sleep with her?
Did you fuck her?

940
01:22:27,224 --> 01:22:28,418
What are you saying?

941
01:22:28,584 --> 01:22:30,893
Did you fuck the old hag?
Did you stick your dick in her?

942
01:22:31,064 --> 01:22:33,419
Stop it!
Stop it!

943
01:22:33,544 --> 01:22:37,093
Stop it, Dori!

944
01:22:37,224 --> 01:22:41,058
Dori? Michaela.

945
01:22:43,984 --> 01:22:46,100
What's come over you, Ben?

946
01:22:47,704 --> 01:22:50,582
Do you really think Lazar's
soul entered your body?

947
01:22:50,704 --> 01:22:53,662
Or is that what you
want her to think?

948
01:22:54,744 --> 01:22:57,178
I don't know.

949
01:22:57,384 --> 01:23:00,182
I don't know what's
happening to me.

950
01:23:01,064 --> 01:23:04,136
I have no idea
what happening to me.

951
01:23:04,464 --> 01:23:06,773
What's happening?

952
01:23:07,624 --> 01:23:12,061
It's you and all
your crazy ideas

953
01:23:12,184 --> 01:23:14,903
about reincarnation...

954
01:23:15,064 --> 01:23:17,419
Everything's so fucked up, Ben.

955
01:23:17,544 --> 01:23:19,853
I was up all night
waiting for you.

956
01:23:22,064 --> 01:23:25,898
Waiting to tell you something
I thought you'd like to hear.

957
01:23:29,184 --> 01:23:30,617
What?

958
01:23:37,824 --> 01:23:40,292
What did you want
to tell me?

959
01:23:40,424 --> 01:23:42,779
I'm pregnant, Ben.

960
01:23:42,904 --> 01:23:44,974
I'm pregnant with your child.

961
01:23:45,144 --> 01:23:47,294
And I know it's yours
because unlike you,

962
01:23:47,464 --> 01:23:50,137
I don't fuck others.

963
01:23:50,744 --> 01:23:53,463
How long have you...
- It doesn't matter.

964
01:23:53,624 --> 01:23:56,775
Thank you. We won't
inconvenience you.

965
01:23:57,384 --> 01:24:00,740
Michaela, please don't...
- Don't touch me.

966
01:24:08,584 --> 01:24:11,781
It's over between us.
I'm late for work.

967
01:24:14,024 --> 01:24:15,901
Michaela, listen to me.

968
01:24:16,064 --> 01:24:18,294
I'll stay here till
I find another apartment.

969
01:24:18,464 --> 01:24:21,854
No, you stay here, I'll leave.

970
01:24:22,024 --> 01:24:24,936
Ben, this was my fault as well.

971
01:24:25,104 --> 01:24:27,379
I knew exactly what
was going on with you.

972
01:24:27,544 --> 01:24:29,375
I was a fool.

973
01:24:29,984 --> 01:24:32,179
I lied to myself.

974
01:24:33,904 --> 01:24:35,860
I let this happen.

975
01:24:38,224 --> 01:24:41,421
Be careful not to lose
your soul completely.

976
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:32,302
What do you want?

977
01:25:32,424 --> 01:25:35,814
I'm so sorry, I thought
you were... - It's OK.

978
01:25:35,944 --> 01:25:37,059
I'm sorry.

979
01:25:37,184 --> 01:25:39,254
Michaela told me everything.

980
01:25:39,424 --> 01:25:42,541
How is she?
- It's nice of you to ask.

981
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:44,617
She's fine.

982
01:25:44,744 --> 01:25:47,861
She moved in with me.
That's why I'm here.

983
01:25:48,024 --> 01:25:49,377
And your mother?

984
01:25:49,504 --> 01:25:52,337
Didn't you know? - What?
- Didn't she tell you?

985
01:25:52,584 --> 01:25:53,573
No, what?

986
01:25:53,704 --> 01:25:54,659
She's in India.

987
01:25:54,784 --> 01:25:56,661
In India?
- She left this morning.

988
01:26:01,104 --> 01:26:03,743
It's funny how India's
affected you.

989
01:26:05,264 --> 01:26:08,176
I thought they took you
with them so that...

990
01:26:10,664 --> 01:26:15,021
you'd meet me. But you fell
in love with my mother.

991
01:26:15,344 --> 01:26:19,223
I know you think
I made a mistake.

992
01:26:21,504 --> 01:26:24,302
I didn't plan on it,
it just happened.

993
01:26:24,424 --> 01:26:26,892
You fell in love,
it can happen to anyone.

994
01:26:27,504 --> 01:26:29,893
But letting someone else
fall in love with you,

995
01:26:30,024 --> 01:26:34,176
without loving her and
getting her pregnant,

996
01:26:34,584 --> 01:26:37,735
that's wrong.
You understand, Dr. Rubin?

997
01:26:37,904 --> 01:26:40,134
Will you do me a favor?

998
01:26:41,544 --> 01:26:43,216
Tell Michaela that if
there's anything she needs...

999
01:26:43,384 --> 01:26:45,739
She doesn't need
anything from you.

1000
01:26:48,664 --> 01:26:51,178
How did you get in here?

1001
01:26:51,344 --> 01:26:54,017
Would you give me
back the keys?

1002
01:26:54,144 --> 01:26:56,783
Can I please have
my father's keys back?

1003
01:27:04,504 --> 01:27:07,576
Do me a favor and get
the hell out of here.

1004
01:27:55,544 --> 01:27:57,023
Hi.

1005
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:01,223
Do you have by any chance a guest
under the name of Mrs. Lazar?

1006
01:28:01,384 --> 01:28:02,294
Lazar?

1007
01:28:02,464 --> 01:28:03,533
Dori Lazar.

1008
01:28:03,664 --> 01:28:05,495
I don't think so.

1009
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:06,774
Are you sure?

1010
01:28:06,944 --> 01:28:08,423
Let me check for you.

1011
01:28:08,544 --> 01:28:10,023
Yes, check it out, please.

1012
01:28:11,624 --> 01:28:14,377
No sir, we don't have a guest
under that name.

1013
01:30:06,784 --> 01:30:08,615
Dori!

1014
01:30:12,144 --> 01:30:13,259
Dori!

1015
01:30:13,424 --> 01:30:15,779
Dori, don't do it! No!

1016
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:41,701
Sir, there is an overseas call
for you.

1017
01:31:42,264 --> 01:31:45,176
She says it's urgent.
I think it's your mother.

1018
01:31:58,904 --> 01:32:01,372
Mom? Mom.

1019
01:32:21,744 --> 01:32:23,257
Excuse me. - Yes?

1020
01:32:23,384 --> 01:32:25,852
Michaela Weiss?
- She's in room no. 1.

1021
01:32:34,304 --> 01:32:37,614
Hi. - Ben.

1022
01:32:44,704 --> 01:32:46,535
When did you get back?

1023
01:32:46,664 --> 01:32:49,815
Just now, I came straight
from the airport.

1024
01:32:51,824 --> 01:32:53,655
A girl.

What did you name her?
- Shiva. "'return" in Hebrew,

1029
01:33:12,144 --> 01:33:15,022
Shiva? Like the Indian God?

1030
01:33:16,544 --> 01:33:20,378
Not exactly.
I called her Shiva because

1031
01:33:21,624 --> 01:33:25,503
I was hoping her father would
return from India one day.

1032
01:33:27,904 --> 01:33:30,134
Forgive me, Michaela.

She's still
in critical condition.

Tell me, do you want to
kill your own daughter?

1060
01:39:08,564 --> 01:39:10,714
Her fever is over 104.
It's simply dangerous.

No...
