1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,640
STARCROSSED

2
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,560
Out of pool, boys!

3
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,920
Connor, use the legs, damn it!

4
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,200
Fabulous facility...
Where have your damn legs?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
Good job, man.

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,520
Dad...
Please!

7
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,440
Dare not help him!
He can do it self!

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,200
Do it self!

9
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,840
Hey, what happened?

10
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Connor, you know...

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,240
Daddy says those things to us
that we can succeed.

12
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,800
Succeed at what we wants
to succeed at.

13
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't wanna be,
who he wants me to be.

14
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,520
He doesn't even care
about anything I'm good at.

15
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,240
He never has.

16
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,000
That's not true.

17
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,240
Yes, it is.

18
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,480
Hey...

19
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,880
Come here.

20
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,680
Come, come on.

21
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,000
It's OK.

22
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,800
Let's see.

23
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,720
I wish I was more like you.

24
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,920
You are like me.

25
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,480
Connor, what the fuck was that?

26
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,960
- It wasn't anything.
- No, what the hell was that?

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,920
It was nothing.
I was just kidding.

28
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,640
You don't gotta be all serious.
It was just a joke.

29
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,840
Let's...

30
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,800
Let's go already meet the girls.
OK?

31
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,800
Hello ladies,
throw your coats on the floor...

32
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,400
Ah, Veronica, this is Brad.

33
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,400
Excellent!

34
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,880
Did you girls bring your partying slippers?

35
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,320
"Dear diary, I want to kill...

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,600
and you have to believe it's for more
than just selfish reasons,

37
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,600
more than just a spoke in my menstrual cycle.

38
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,200
You have to believe me."

39
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,000
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl
and not have to ask "What's your major?"

40
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,240
I hate that.

41
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,960
So, when you go to college,
what subjects do you think you'll study?

42
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,400
Come on, David. Shouldn't we get
back to the party?

43
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
We will.

44
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,640
It's just you're so hot tonight.

45
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,200
I can't control myself.

46
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,040
Oh Christ, I can't explain it,
but I'm allowed an understanding

47
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,080
that my parents and these Remington University
assholes have chosen to ignore.

48
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,840
Hey, Connor...?

49
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,360
Yeah?

50
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,080
What's happening?

51
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
I don't know.

52
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,480
What's wrong with us?

53
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,400
Wrong?

54
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,120
And I don't...

55
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,880
not like others view, so...

56
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,320
something has to be wrong with us.

57
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,480
Are you scared?

58
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,520
Yeah.

59
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,400
Showers!

60
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,720
- Darren!
- Hi...

61
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,880
- You're just gonna walk pass me?
- No, I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

62
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,240
- Why haven't you return any of my calls?
- I know. I'm sorry. I've been little busy.

63
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,080
- You used to call me every night.
- I know. I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

64
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,080
- Did I do something wrong?
- No!

65
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,120
I'll call you tonight, OK?
I promise.

66
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,120
Connor...

67
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,080
Yeah?

68
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,480
How long do you think we could keep this all?

69
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,720
I don't know.

70
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,680
What if we get torn apart?

71
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,320
I won't let that happen.

72
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,960
Connor?

73
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,480
Mom!

74
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,000
Take him...
they cannot see each other again.

75
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,080
- Where are we going?
- I don't know. Just drive!

76
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,160
Darren!

77
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,400
This isn't gonna end good, is it?

78
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,080
No.

79
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,480
I got here a stolen car.

80
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,760
I don't wanna live,
if I'm not with you.

81
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,040
I love you.

82
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,520
I love you.

83
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,160
No one's here.

84
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,840
Are you ready?

85
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,440
Yes.

86
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,400
