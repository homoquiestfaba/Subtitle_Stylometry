1
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:28,536
5 lincoln 9
eastbound on 6th...

2
00:02:28,537 --> 00:02:31,743
heading towards front in pursuit
of white oldsmobile cutlass.

3
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:34,965
Roger, 5 Lincoln. Charles Edward 12
is 3 minutes E.T.A.

4
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:37,063
Box in the suspect and
hold the perimeter.

5
00:02:37,064 --> 00:02:38,879
Copy, Charles Edward 12.

6
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,753
- Listen, you heard what he said.
- And I'm not buying it.

7
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:42,850
- It's a retaliation shooting.
- Then let it happen.

8
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:45,873
Let 'em kill each other. Bang bang bang,
and we come in and clean up.

9
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,755
End of story.

10
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:48,655
That's exactly
what they expect you to do.

11
00:02:48,656 --> 00:02:51,327
I can't believe you're listening
to his shit. He's a C.I.

12
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:53,848
- What difference does it make?
- He's a paid criminal informant.

13
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,430
- He'll say anything to cover his own ass.
- Fuck you, man.

14
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:59,804
His handler was shot dead tonight.
How do we know he didn't set up the hit?

15
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,118
- That's bullshit, man.
- You saw the sheet.

16
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:04,042
This kid Michael Pips
had priors.

17
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:05,891
He found out
Jacobs was undercover,

18
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:08,429
picked up a 9mm and took
matters into his own hands.

19
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,328
- You're wrong! You're wrong!
- He didn't set up shit, man.

20
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:12,028
There was somebody else
in that park.

21
00:03:12,029 --> 00:03:15,066
Somebody planned it on the other side...
One of your boys, man.

22
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,332
You witness this?

23
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,188
How am I gonna know
your boy was an undercover?

24
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:20,584
When he found out, he freaked.
He wasn't about to kill no cop.

25
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:23,376
Couple minutes later, somebody
come in, cut Jacobs down.

26
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:24,958
Now he's trying to pin it
on a rival gang.

27
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,658
Who was the shooter?

28
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,812
I'm not saying another word
till I speak to his D.A.

29
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:30,310
He doesn't know shit.

30
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:33,085
Look, our job is to
stop this from escalating.

31
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:35,399
He killed a cop! He's got a target
painted on him...

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,205
from every officer
in the field right now.

33
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:40,271
Charles Edward 12, be advised:

34
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:42,959
Suspect vehicle is pinned, but there's
movement within the perimeter.

35
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:47,249
Shots firing! Shots firing!

36
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:51,452
Officers need backup!
38th Cross street...

37
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,351
put your head down!

38
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:54,368
Put your head down!

39
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:00,311
Down down... Get down!

40
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:12,669
Keep your head down!
Come on.

41
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:15,509
Come on!
Quick with your leg!

42
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,645
Come on, man.
Come on.

43
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:24,616
Hey hey. Hey!

44
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:27,849
Freeze!

45
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,154
Tino, hey!
Come on, breathe!

46
00:04:34,843 --> 00:04:37,359
Suspect down! Suspect is down!

47
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,881
Breathe!

48
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:41,179
Cover me! Cover me!

49
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,618
Breathe! Come on!

50
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:47,401
Fuck.

51
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:58,466
We're clear!
Need an E.M.T.!

52
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:01,970
Shepherd!

53
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:05,985
- Where's our paramedics?
- Shepherd!

54
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:07,672
Rescue 1-6, we have two...
repeat...

55
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:09,172
- two G.S.W.S.
- Shepherd?

56
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:12,927
- What is your E.T.A.?
- Was he hit? Is it Pips?

57
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,711
No.

58
00:05:14,712 --> 00:05:17,234
What's his status, detective?

59
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:25,659
He's gone.

60
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,524
S.W.A.T.'s on their way.

61
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:30,396
- What's their E.T.A.?
- They're still 10 minutes out.

62
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:42,171
You tell them there's plainclothes
within the perimeter.

63
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:44,410
- Whoa. What're you thinking?
- I'm going in.

64
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,176
Hey, wait for S.W.A.T., man. We don't know
how many shooters are in the vicinity.

65
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:49,082
This kid doesn't have
10 minutes, all right?

66
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,914
Shepherd, I can't let you
do this, man.

67
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:53,546
Hey, you want to stay, Briggs,
you stay.

68
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,751
Hold on!

69
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:04,811
You're not seriously
going in there, are you?

70
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:07,927
He's my partner.
Listen, you're our eyes and ears.

71
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:10,932
You maintain radio silence unless
you see movement on our position.

72
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:12,331
- You got it?
- Yep.

73
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:14,302
- They know we're here. Be smart.
- All right.

74
00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:36,693
movement, tree line!

75
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:39,324
We're sitting ducks
out here, man!

76
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:44,795
- Cover me.
- No! They're trying to pin us down,

77
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:47,633
trying to beat us to Michael. We need
to make a move to the warehouse.

78
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:48,933
What?

79
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:50,938
Hey, listen to me.

80
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:53,437
Point every light you've got
on that tree line.

81
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:55,943
Every light you've got
on that tree line right now.

82
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:57,875
- 10-4.
- Good. Don't stop.

83
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,075
Keep those lights moving.

84
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:01,282
You hear me?
Keep those lights moving.

85
00:07:07,153 --> 00:07:09,791
You ready?

86
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:12,355
- Let's go!
- Fuckin' crazy.

87
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:17,360
- Clear left!
- Clear right!

88
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:18,794
Moving center.

89
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:23,065
Down down down down!

90
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:31,839
Police officers!
Drop the gun!

91
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:34,912
Man, I didn't do this!

92
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,229
I didn't kill
that fuckin' cop!

93
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,733
Drop the fucking gun, Michael.
We have you surrounded.

94
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,733
Michael, I'm coming out.
Michael!

95
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:44,972
Michael, hey.
Hey, I'm unarmed.

96
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:50,476
- I just wanna talk.
- I didn't kill that fuckin' cop.

97
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:52,515
Man, I didn't do this.

98
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:54,280
We're here to help you.

99
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:56,646
Put the weapon down,
Michael, now!

100
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:59,552
Hey hey, eyes on me,
Michael.

101
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:02,457
Eyes on me! Okay?

102
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,589
Tell your boy to
put his gun down.

103
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,678
That's not gonna happen,
Michael.

104
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:10,042
Everybody, calm down!
Just lower your weapon, Briggs.

105
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:11,948
- No way.
- Do it, motherfucker!

106
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,313
- No way.
- Michael, we're not here to hurt you.

107
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:18,318
I promise. I give you my word:
We're not here to hurt you.

108
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,223
- Let's just talk.
- He's one of them, isn't he?

109
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:23,290
Just you and me.
No, he's not.

110
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,289
- He's fuckin' one of 'em, isn't he?
- No, he's not.

111
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,360
He's been with me
all night.

112
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:30,800
We're here to get you out.
You understand me?

113
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,665
I just need you to tell me
what you saw tonight.

114
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,738
Cops! I saw fuckin' cops!

115
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:38,402
- You saw cops on 6th street?
- That's what I said.

116
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:40,642
Okay. All right.

117
00:08:40,643 --> 00:08:42,790
Back it down, detective.

118
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,308
How many cops did
you see, Michael?

119
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:46,546
I saw three of 'em!

120
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:49,750
All right. You saw three cops.
Can you identify them?

121
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:56,256
Stand down, detective!
Lower your weapon!

122
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:58,794
Look at him, Michael.
He's lowering his gun.

123
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:02,193
All right?
He's lowering his weapon.

124
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:04,532
Lower your weapon, Briggs.

125
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:10,536
Now i need you to tell me
you can identify these cops.

126
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:15,340
Yeah.
I seen 'em before.

127
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:20,345
Okay. All right.
That's good.

128
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:25,015
- Who else knows about this, Michael?
- Man, you tell me.

129
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:28,455
Hey! Hey, listen to me.

130
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:31,186
If there's somebody out there
that can back up your story,

131
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:33,925
We need to get them
into protective custody.

132
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:38,962
Look, we've got a car
standing by.

133
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:42,215
Alright? We're not gonna
bring you in here.

134
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:44,549
We're gonna take you to the feds...
The F.B.I., Michael.

135
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,954
They're gonna take you
into protective custody.

136
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:49,253
No one's gonna get near you.

137
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:52,725
You're gonna be safe.

138
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:55,896
I need to know...

139
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:58,530
who else do we need
to protect?

140
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,373
No. I'm the only one left.

141
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,231
Suspect in custody.

142
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:22,567
- Michael!
- Drop the gun!

143
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:25,242
- Michael, don't! Michael, no!
- Get down!

144
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:27,541
- Drop the fuckin' gun!
- No, wait a minute!

145
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:30,645
Wait a minute! Wait wait!

146
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:38,354
suspect down.

147
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:13,569
What you got?

148
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,323
We've got five dead bodies
in the last 24 hours.

149
00:11:16,324 --> 00:11:18,605
This could be the worst case
of retaliation violence

150
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:20,256
This city's ever seen.

151
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:24,859
- Has that gotten out?
- Not yet.

152
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,129
But we've only got a few hours
till the press gets wind of it.

153
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:34,019
All right.

154
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,122
So what are you thinking,
counsel?

155
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:42,062
There's no way to justify
their actions in the field tonight.

156
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:45,333
Someone has to take
the fall for this.

157
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:48,249
Is that the official position
of the district attorney?

158
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,920
Just to be clear,

159
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:53,103
Nothing leaves this room until
it's been blessed by our office.

160
00:11:55,492 --> 00:11:57,840
What's your take
on Shepherd?

161
00:11:57,841 --> 00:12:01,895
He's been on the job for 30 hours
straight with no sleep.

162
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:03,502
He'll be easy to break.

163
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:38,416
Okay, detective.

164
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:43,854
Are you ready to begin?

165
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,024
You know the drill, detective.

166
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:51,862
Tell us what happened
out there tonight.

167
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:54,126
What difference does it make?
Hmm?

168
00:12:54,127 --> 00:12:57,300
The difference between losing
your badge and going to prison

169
00:12:57,301 --> 00:13:00,083
- For criminal misconduct.
- No matter what I say,

170
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:02,787
You're gonna spin it exactly
the way that you want,

171
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:05,992
Exactly the way it's been done
here 100 times before.

172
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,275
What was that?

173
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:09,207
I know what you do
with the facts

174
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,746
When they don't match the story
you want to tell, right?

175
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,946
You change them
or you ignore them.

176
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:17,084
Keep it up, detective.
You're just hanging yourself.

177
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:18,552
Am i?

178
00:13:18,553 --> 00:13:21,423
Tell us what you know.

179
00:13:21,424 --> 00:13:24,494
During the course of
the initial investigation...

180
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:27,509
into the shooting deaths
of officer Chris Jacobs,

181
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,248
we interviewed his partner,
detective Evans.

182
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:32,814
He gave us the name of
a paid criminal informant...

183
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:34,788
who eventually led us
to the suspect.

184
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:39,256
You placed an A.P.B.
At approximately 2200 hours.

185
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:41,924
Yes, sir, when some of
our patrol officers...

186
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:45,361
reporting spotting the suspect
and engaged in pursuit.

187
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:47,950
They were able to box him in
at front street.

188
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:52,471
Based on preliminary reports submitted
by patrol officers Lerner and Cominsky,

189
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:54,488
they were attacked
by an assailant.

190
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:57,842
Did you witness this,
detective?

191
00:13:57,843 --> 00:13:59,842
A firefight did ensue.

192
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:04,612
The criminal informant was shot
and killed in the crossfire.

193
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:07,567
Detective Shepherd and
i then pursued the suspect

194
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:11,756
Into the warehouse area.
We cornered him.

195
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:14,039
We attempted to talk him
into surrendering

196
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,526
Even after he had
fired upon us.

197
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:20,109
At which time uniformed officers
fired upon the suspect,

198
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,830
Fatally injuring him only
after all attempts

199
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:27,985
To disarm him
had been exhausted.

200
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:30,201
What are we missing,
detective?

201
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,790
Sir?

202
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:36,461
We wish it was
that simple.

203
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,365
It wasn't that clean,
was it, detective?

204
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:47,519
You either play ball or I'm taking
you down myself. You understand me?

205
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,807
You want to put me
on the stand? Go ahead.

206
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,841
'Cause i'll
tell 'em everything.

207
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:54,828
But you don't want that,
do you?

208
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,677
Right?
You can't control it.

209
00:14:56,678 --> 00:15:00,932
It's not the image that the department
wants to present to the public.

210
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,104
You're burnt out, Shepherd.
We can all see that.

211
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:06,819
Is that why you did
what you did?

212
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,026
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

213
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:11,794
You have no idea what
we're talking about?

214
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:15,280
Well, we've got a sworn statement
from your partner here...

215
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,418
and it says different.

216
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:24,955
There's no way.

217
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:29,028
Go ahead, read it.
His debrief ended hours ago.

218
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,608
Why do you think that is?

219
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,398
Let me help you out,
detective.

220
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,214
Why don't you start
by telling us...

221
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,953
how detective Evans wound up
with two bullet holes in his head...

222
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:41,235
one self-inflicted
and one not?

223
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:44,256
You were the first guy
at the scene.

224
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,833
Sir, I can only comment...

225
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,616
that during the course
of our investigation,

226
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:58,003
we encountered what could only
be described as a theory...

227
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:02,558
Of potential conspiracy
involving individuals...

228
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,829
from within our own department.

229
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,611
No way. This is a setup
and you know it.

230
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:10,934
You're out of line.

231
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,248
Every one of those men is
dead tonight because of us.

232
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:14,655
And for what?

233
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:17,787
The reason we're here
is to find the truth.

234
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:20,642
- The truth, captain?
- Yeah.

235
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:23,075
Those suspects had a target
painted on their back...

236
00:16:23,076 --> 00:16:25,714
from every officer
in the field.

237
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:27,964
We caused this!

238
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:31,951
We caused this.

239
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:34,624
Detective, sit down.

240
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:38,760
We caused this.

241
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:41,609
Detective.

242
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,916
This is our fault.

243
00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:53,792
Lieutenant
start from the beginning.

244
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:55,789
Don't leave out
a single detail.

245
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,861
This is your only shot.

246
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:02,050
Your partner's going down.

247
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:04,633
There's nothing we can do
to stop that now.

248
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:07,305
Are you?

249
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:09,671
You don't have to join him.

250
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:12,226
There's only one way
out that door.

251
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:16,997
It's time to come clean.

252
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,734
My partner
detective Shepherd and i

253
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:27,106
Received the first call
at 1800 hours.

254
00:17:27,107 --> 00:17:29,070
There'd been
an apparent shooting

255
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:32,793
Down at the 6th street park...
That's deep within gangland.

256
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:35,064
Whose gangland?

257
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:37,514
The vice lords.

258
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:41,834
They run all the streets
in between 16th and fairfax.

259
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:43,851
Nobody goes in
and nobody comes out...

260
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:46,223
without being affiliated
with that crew.

261
00:17:46,224 --> 00:17:49,794
Preliminary reports indicated
that it was indeed...

262
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:52,093
a gangland homicide.

263
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:53,959
The wealthy street boys...

264
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,797
they'd been seen in the area
and there'd been a series of shootings...

265
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:58,531
in the past couple
of weeks.

266
00:17:58,532 --> 00:18:00,571
Our initial instincts
told us...

267
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:04,358
that it was a retaliation shooting
that resulted from a prior incident.

268
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:09,278
- We got a break in the rain.
- Yeah, give it 10 minutes.

269
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,811
Johnson, what do you have?

270
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:14,650
Victim's a white male,
late 20s, early 30s.

271
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:17,248
Took multiple G.S.W.S
to the head and chest.

272
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:19,587
Chalk that up.
How many does it make?

273
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:22,321
- Three in three weeks.
- First on scene?

274
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:24,260
- I was, sir.
- Did you I.D. the victim?

275
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:26,825
Not yet. No wallet, no cash...
stripped clean.

276
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:29,996
Detectives, we've got over
two dozen spent shell casings.

277
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:31,296
They're all 9mm.

278
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:33,436
We've also got tread marks
from what could have been...

279
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:36,368
the shooter's vehicle
heading out of the park.

280
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:38,939
How long before you get
the results on the treads?

281
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,204
I'll be uploading the photos
within the next 24 hours,

282
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,609
but it'll still take a couple of days
to get a positive match.

283
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:48,082
All right. Show me this kid.
Maybe we can shop a photo around.

284
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,082
Watch your step.

285
00:18:51,954 --> 00:18:54,553
Took hits from all sides.

286
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:57,823
Not very pretty
what's left of him.

287
00:18:57,824 --> 00:18:59,822
Pull it back.

288
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,087
Cover it up.

289
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:16,175
Hey, what's up?
Do you know this guy?

290
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:18,474
He's one of ours, shep.

291
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:20,963
Lock it down now!

292
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,911
Detective?

293
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,896
I've seen things no one
should ever see.

294
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,833
I've dealt with it
like we all have.

295
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:50,306
Your training tells you
to separate your emotions

296
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:53,428
From the job at hand,
to build up a tolerance to it.

297
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:55,792
But when it's
someone you know...

298
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:06,873
turn it off.

299
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:16,666
I wanted revenge.

300
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:22,704
You saw what
they did to him.

301
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:26,627
His face was barely
recognizable.

302
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:31,495
Those fucking animals
did that to him,

303
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,512
And for what?

304
00:20:33,513 --> 00:20:36,437
A piece of gangland?

305
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:41,622
They want to kill each other
over that, lieutenant,

306
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:44,004
let 'em fuckin' have it.

307
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,024
you ready to continue?

308
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:00,076
Talk to me, detectives.
What are we looking at?

309
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:02,338
We got a positive I.D.
On our victim.

310
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:04,962
- He's one of ours.
- Jesus Christ!

311
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,296
- Who is it?
- Detective Chris Jacobs.

312
00:21:07,297 --> 00:21:09,281
He was an undercover
working vice.

313
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:11,282
- What was he doing down here?
- We don't know yet.

314
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:13,220
We set up
a four-block perimeter.

315
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:15,936
No one's getting in and out of this place
until we know what happened.

316
00:21:15,937 --> 00:21:19,260
We've also got what appears to be
a blood trail that leads from here...

317
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:21,156
to just outside
the warehouse.

318
00:21:21,157 --> 00:21:23,781
We think Jacobs got off a few
rounds with a backup piece...

319
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,079
before he went down,
'cause whoever our suspect is,

320
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,833
He's hurt and
he's bleeding.

321
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:30,017
Yeah, we notified
local hospitals, clinics.

322
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:32,422
Guy goes for help,
we've got him.

323
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:35,755
Listen to me:
somebody shot one of ours.

324
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:39,810
Now it's your responsibility
to bring them in to justice at all costs.

325
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:41,981
Do you understand me?

326
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:45,863
All right then.

327
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:47,705
Let's get these guys.

328
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:51,540
- Hey, lieutenant, Jacobs had a wife.
- I'll take care of it.

329
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,557
With all due respect, sir, I know her.
I'd like to be the one.

330
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:56,345
All right, detective.

331
00:22:29,742 --> 00:22:31,825
You all right?

332
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:36,728
Yeah. It's all part
of the job, you know?

333
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:42,834
Yeah. This is the hard part
of what we do.

334
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:46,588
How do I tell her that?

335
00:22:50,343 --> 00:22:52,714
You want me to
go in with you?

336
00:22:56,764 --> 00:22:59,834
No.
Thanks, man.

337
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:03,740
I know her. She sees us
both go, she'll know.

338
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:07,510
Yeah.

339
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:13,282
Give me a minute,
all right?

340
00:23:41,726 --> 00:23:44,476
Oh my god.
Briggs!

341
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:47,231
What are you doing here?
It's been forever.

342
00:23:47,232 --> 00:23:49,095
Come in, come in.
Chris isn't back yet...

343
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:51,201
but I'm expecting him
any minute.

344
00:23:51,202 --> 00:23:53,618
He's gonna be so excited
to see you. How are you?

345
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,688
You want to stay
for dinner?

346
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,893
No, I can't.
Um...

347
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:04,680
- tracy, listen.
- What?

348
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,918
Is something wrong?

349
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:17,340
Did something happen
to Chris?

350
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:22,478
You ought to sit down.

351
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,115
Don't tell me this.

352
00:24:30,404 --> 00:24:32,776
Tell me he's okay.

353
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,845
He's okay.

354
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:44,017
Briggs, where is he?

355
00:24:45,835 --> 00:24:47,772
Sorry.

356
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:49,487
Oh my god!

357
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,993
Oh my god!

358
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:55,242
Oh my god!
Oh my god!

359
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,349
Oh, god damn it!

360
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,547
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

361
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:03,818
I promise you that I will
find whoever did this.

362
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:06,558
You find them
and you kill them!

363
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,957
You fucking kill them!

364
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,961
Shh.
Come here, come on.

365
00:25:10,962 --> 00:25:13,126
Come here.
Shh shh shh.

366
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:25,158
I'm so sorry.

367
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:34,566
I worked with Jacobs
for over six years.

368
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,815
He was like
a brother to me...

369
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:40,421
and a damn good cop.

370
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:44,443
But when he got transferred
to vice,

371
00:25:44,444 --> 00:25:47,706
He got partnered
with Evans.

372
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:51,863
Jesus Christ.

373
00:25:51,864 --> 00:25:55,151
Stick to the facts, detective. We're not
looking for any color commentary.

374
00:25:55,152 --> 00:25:58,089
Everyone on the force knows
he's a fucking joke...

375
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,187
a burned-out drunk
raging alcoholic...

376
00:26:01,188 --> 00:26:04,259
just pissing time away
until he got his pension.

377
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,965
And you fucking guys
stick Jacobs with him.

378
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,012
Are you finished?

379
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:17,508
Then let's continue.

380
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,327
Your assignment
was to pursue the suspect,

381
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:26,000
track him down
and bring him into custody.

382
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,547
That's exactly what
we attempted to do. Okay?

383
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:33,154
You tell me why an undercover
would go into gangland with no backup.

384
00:26:33,155 --> 00:26:35,741
We're investigating
his actions.

385
00:26:35,742 --> 00:26:38,157
His actions didn't make
any sense, captain.

386
00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:43,280
Before we could do anything else,
we needed to find out what was going on.

387
00:26:43,281 --> 00:26:45,568
There's a cop bar
on division and 8th...

388
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:47,565
called Eddie's.

389
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:50,238
Detective Evans was known
to frequent the place.

390
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:04,885
Cocktails!

391
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:06,884
Come on, keep up.

392
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:08,989
God.

393
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,859
Cocktails!

394
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,894
Come on, sugar tits,
keep up with me here.

395
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:17,859
God damn it.

396
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,663
Let's go, sarah.
Keep up. That's it.

397
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:26,468
You know, I am gonna
take you home...

398
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:29,440
and do dirty things
to you tonight.

399
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:32,861
I'd love to, but I have a feeling
you might have a problem...

400
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:34,577
getting your little
whiskey dick up.

401
00:27:34,578 --> 00:27:36,611
Aww.

402
00:27:38,336 --> 00:27:41,415
Crown rocks.
One for my friend too.

403
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:45,018
Aw, come on, sarah.
What're you doin' to me, girl?

404
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:49,674
Oh! What is this?
I got a hole in my glass?

405
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:52,296
Better than a hole
in your head.

406
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,130
What'd you say?

407
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,734
Do I know you?

408
00:27:56,735 --> 00:27:59,867
No, but we know you,
detective Evans.

409
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:02,655
Who are you guys?

410
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:06,662
Oh! You guys are I.A.D.

411
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:09,775
Well, this is a cop bar
and I am off duty.

412
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:12,631
You want to talk to me,
you do it when I'm on the clock...

413
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:16,969
with my union rep present.
Other than that, you can kiss my ass.

414
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,606
You got it wrong, Jack.
We're not I.A.D., we're homicide.

415
00:28:20,607 --> 00:28:23,039
Ahh.

416
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,610
Oh, well, what can
i do for you, detectives?

417
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:30,150
We're investigating the
shooting death of Chris Jacobs.

418
00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:33,614
Your partner.

419
00:28:33,615 --> 00:28:35,470
- Is this a fucking joke?
- No joke.

420
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:38,758
Your partner was found shot to death
at the park down on 6th street.

421
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,941
- What the fuck?!
- What was he doing there, detective?

422
00:28:40,942 --> 00:28:44,397
This isn't right.
This wasn't supposed to go down.

423
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:45,678
The meet was scheduled
for friday.

424
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,934
- What meet?
- This is not right.

425
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,099
Hey, Evans, focus.
What meet?

426
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,298
What were you working on?

427
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:56,936
We were assigned to
a joint task force...

428
00:28:56,937 --> 00:29:00,042
investigating some
small-time drug traffickers...

429
00:29:00,043 --> 00:29:02,248
This nothing bust.

430
00:29:02,249 --> 00:29:03,981
All right?

431
00:29:03,982 --> 00:29:06,562
Now we had a paid
criminal informant

432
00:29:06,563 --> 00:29:09,700
Set up a meet and greet with
the players for friday night.

433
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:11,150
Why was the meet moved up?

434
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:13,023
No way he'd have gone in
without backup.

435
00:29:13,024 --> 00:29:17,328
Not much backup if your
partner's facedown in a bar.

436
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:19,591
- What?
- His partner's a drunk.

437
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:23,131
He kept fucking things up,
so better go in alone

438
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:25,132
Than chancing having
the bust get tossed...

439
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:26,769
because you're a deadbeat.

440
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,403
Fuck you, asshole!

441
00:29:28,404 --> 00:29:30,957
I done my time
in this shithole.

442
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:32,456
No, fuck you, asshole!

443
00:29:32,457 --> 00:29:36,162
You want to drink yourself
into oblivion? Let's go!

444
00:29:36,163 --> 00:29:39,928
Better to be partnered with a C.I.
Than let him hang for your bullshit!

445
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:41,965
I didn't know!

446
00:29:41,966 --> 00:29:44,564
Now who was the informant?
Give me a name!

447
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:46,904
- What's his name?
- Tino. His name's Tino.

448
00:29:46,905 --> 00:29:48,370
Where do I find him?

449
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:50,742
I don't know.
He's Jacobs's guy.

450
00:29:50,743 --> 00:29:52,842
- Bullshit, you cocksucker!
- Ahh!

451
00:29:52,843 --> 00:29:54,142
- Bullshit!
- Get off him!

452
00:29:54,144 --> 00:29:56,146
- Where is he?
- God damn it!

453
00:29:56,147 --> 00:29:57,912
You're out of control,
Briggs!

454
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:00,319
- Get the fuck back.
- Ahh.

455
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:08,220
Your partner's way out of control...
Way out of line.

456
00:30:08,221 --> 00:30:10,625
- Give yourself up.
- Wait a minute.

457
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:11,629
- Oh, god.
- Hey,

458
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,629
you listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

459
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,431
Jacobs is dead
because of you.

460
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:17,914
The only thing standing
between you...

461
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:20,567
and that maniac
out there is me!

462
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:24,438
Now you tell me every
goddamn thing you know,

463
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:26,803
or I swear to god, there's nothing
I can do to prevent him...

464
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:28,845
from coming back
and finishing you.

465
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:50,178
It's 423 rosewood.

466
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:57,888
You don't think you went
a little bit over the line there?

467
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,610
It was the only way,
lieutenant.

468
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:02,909
Come on, you know when
a cop screws up,

469
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,314
They shut down, go into
automatic cover-up mode

470
00:31:06,315 --> 00:31:09,712
'Cause they need to justify
their actions or they're finished.

471
00:31:09,713 --> 00:31:12,151
We needed that information.

472
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:16,106
Who was the C.I.?

473
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,688
Tino.

474
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:20,762
His name was Tino.

475
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:23,761
Been playin' on the streets
his whole life.

476
00:31:23,762 --> 00:31:26,298
He was taking money
from both sides of the fence.

477
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:28,298
We hit his house.
He wasn't there.

478
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:30,420
So the waiting game began.

479
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:37,323
Yeah, like I thought.

480
00:31:37,324 --> 00:31:40,678
There's no record of your request
and a warrant to enter his premises.

481
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,850
He was a paid criminal informant.
We weren't there to arrest him, captain.

482
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:45,616
And what if you had
stumbled upon evidence?

483
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:47,398
It would have been completely
inadmissible in a court of law.

484
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:50,070
He was our only chance
of finding the suspect.

485
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:51,937
So you trumped your entire
investigation?

486
00:31:51,938 --> 00:31:53,858
No, it was a judgment call.

487
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:57,846
You guys are cops.
You remember how to make those?

488
00:32:00,196 --> 00:32:02,667
Put yourselves in the same
place at the same time.

489
00:32:02,668 --> 00:32:05,066
You wouldn't have done
anything different.

490
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:08,054
This guy was our only chance
at finding the shooter.

491
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,602
What time do you have?

492
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:25,517
12:30.

493
00:32:25,518 --> 00:32:28,421
Man, it's been two hours. How long
do you wanna wait for this guy?

494
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:31,261
Last call's not till 1:45.

495
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:33,477
That's if he's at a bar.

496
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,204
What?

497
00:32:40,205 --> 00:32:43,401
I didn't need you to pull me out tonight.
I had Evans by myself.

498
00:32:43,402 --> 00:32:45,990
Yes, you did. You were
completely out of control.

499
00:32:45,991 --> 00:32:47,074
What's your problem?

500
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:49,174
My problem is that I can't have you
go off half-cocked...

501
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,595
- until we find this guy.
- He killed a cop.

502
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:54,227
We've got half the department
looking for him right now.

503
00:32:54,228 --> 00:32:56,267
And that pretty much
frees us up, doesn't it?

504
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:58,083
God damn it, Briggs!

505
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,826
You know, just listen to me
for a minute, okay?

506
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:06,743
What?

507
00:33:06,744 --> 00:33:09,513
My first year on the job,

508
00:33:09,514 --> 00:33:12,362
Working the b team
on the west side of town,

509
00:33:12,363 --> 00:33:15,767
Ran into a gang-related
homicide just like this one.

510
00:33:15,768 --> 00:33:20,655
And I'm the rookie,
so I just follow the team lead.

511
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:24,726
But we knew who
the shooter was.

512
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:29,197
Instead of bringing him in,

513
00:33:29,198 --> 00:33:32,195
we decided to let things
escalate...

514
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:34,867
Street justice.

515
00:33:34,868 --> 00:33:38,506
Let the animals kill each other,
then we come in with the body bags.

516
00:33:38,507 --> 00:33:40,056
Make life easy, right?

517
00:33:40,057 --> 00:33:43,163
Yeah, it's about right.

518
00:33:44,712 --> 00:33:46,393
Yeah, well,
it didn't take long.

519
00:33:46,394 --> 00:33:48,966
Rival gang gunned him down
right away.

520
00:33:51,953 --> 00:33:55,052
Street justice.

521
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:58,107
We let the streets
clean themselves up, right?

522
00:33:58,108 --> 00:34:00,056
You're wrong.

523
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:02,862
You know what we
didn't count on?

524
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:05,700
All the people that
were goin' down right after...

525
00:34:05,701 --> 00:34:09,850
A dozen.
Four of 'em dead,

526
00:34:11,923 --> 00:34:15,010
Including
a six-Year-Old girl.

527
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,975
Caught a ricochet to
the back of the head.

528
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:21,050
She was playing in
her backyard.

529
00:34:23,213 --> 00:34:26,568
For what?

530
00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:30,856
Some bullshit
that we allowed to happen.

531
00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:33,357
Your point, detective?

532
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:35,961
My point is that you and I
don't have to let this happen again.

533
00:34:35,962 --> 00:34:38,194
He was my partner, Shepherd!

534
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:40,996
So if you're not up for the task,
you better think about calling it a night.

535
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:45,070
- You need to cool off, Briggs.
- You need to cowboy up.

536
00:34:47,403 --> 00:34:50,273
We got action.

537
00:34:50,274 --> 00:34:51,939
You ready?

538
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,945
Easy.

539
00:34:54,946 --> 00:34:56,995
Here he comes.

540
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,807
- Drop the gun, Tino!
- Fuck, man.

541
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:11,072
- Drop the gun!
- Police officers, Tino.

542
00:35:11,073 --> 00:35:13,181
What the fuck you doin'
in my house?

543
00:35:13,182 --> 00:35:15,844
You know what? You're right.
Let's take a walk.

544
00:35:15,845 --> 00:35:18,384
That's not cool.
That's not cool, man.

545
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:20,699
That's not cool, man.
What the fuck...

546
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,837
What the fuck
is all this about?

547
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:25,037
- This ain't how it's supposed to be played.
- Your hand dealer's dead, Tino.

548
00:35:25,038 --> 00:35:27,342
- What?
- Detective Jacobs was found...

549
00:35:27,343 --> 00:35:29,775
shot and killed at the park
down on 6th street.

550
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,746
Whoa... whoa... whoa.
I don't know nothing about this shit.

551
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:37,368
Listen here, you motherfucker.
You got 10 seconds...

552
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,867
to tell me what you know,
or we're gonna take you out that door...

553
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:42,739
and parade you around gangland in
the most obvious unmarked police car...

554
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,245
this city's ever seen.
I'm talking lights, sirens,

555
00:35:45,246 --> 00:35:47,245
the whole shebang,
so everybody...

556
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:50,182
Every fucking gangbanger in this city
knows where you get your cash!

557
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:53,081
Hold on, hold on.
I can help you, man.

558
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:54,419
We're listening, Tino.

559
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,919
I can help you.
Just give me a few days, man.

560
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,159
I'll get word from the street,
circle around a little bit.

561
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,891
You're not listening
to me, Tino.

562
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,788
A suspect is out there
that shot and killed a cop,

563
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:06,128
And you're the only one that
knows why he was in the park.

564
00:36:06,129 --> 00:36:09,067
Now your 10 seconds
is almost up.

565
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:10,467
I don't know.

566
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,766
Wrong answer.

567
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,372
Let's go!

568
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:16,220
- He was looking for a dirty cop.
- What'd you say?

569
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:18,259
He was looking for
a dirty cop, man.

570
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,124
Jacobs told me not to
talk to nobody.

571
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:24,697
And since I don't know neither
of you, I ain't sayin' shit.

572
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:27,428
All right.

573
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:29,900
- I've got a better idea.
- Let's go!

574
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:49,385
What do we have here, detective?

575
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,098
These guys, Tino?
Really? You sure?

576
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:05,165
- Them? That's them right there?
- Fuck y'all, man.

577
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:08,435
- This is bullshit, man.
- Fellas!

578
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:11,325
Guys, recognize Tino?

579
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:13,024
Come around!
Take a look!

580
00:37:14,424 --> 00:37:16,230
Say hi, Tino.

581
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:17,795
He wants to say hi.

582
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:20,517
Come on,
give 'em a smile, man.

583
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:22,750
Yeah, that's him.

584
00:37:22,751 --> 00:37:25,421
This is bullshit, man.
Get me the fuck outta here.

585
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:28,487
Looks like your cover's
blown, Tino.

586
00:37:33,025 --> 00:37:34,781
Now you're thinkin', Tino.

587
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:39,285
Now you're thinkin'.

588
00:37:39,286 --> 00:37:42,116
This is fucked up, man.

589
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:00,602
- Man, what the fu...
- Let's go.

590
00:38:00,603 --> 00:38:02,034
- What the fuck is...
- Let's go.

591
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:03,575
- Briggs, take him.
- Come on, man.

592
00:38:03,576 --> 00:38:05,307
- Get over there.
- Take it easy, man.

593
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:08,244
- Take it easy on him.
- What the fuck's the matter with him?

594
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,812
Let's have it.

595
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:11,744
Jacobs told me not to talk
to nobody from local P.D., man.

596
00:38:11,745 --> 00:38:13,249
He said the sheriff
and the feds only, man.

597
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,214
Why would he say that?

598
00:38:15,215 --> 00:38:17,119
He didn't know who he could
trust within the department.

599
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,053
You guys got some dirty
shit goin' down, man.

600
00:38:19,054 --> 00:38:20,720
He didn't know how
high up it went.

601
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:22,158
What the hell was he doin'
at 6th street?

602
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:24,490
There was this kid he heard
about from his partner...

603
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,529
this young fighter
golden gloves, man.

604
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,362
Real tough...
Sharp with his hands.

605
00:38:28,363 --> 00:38:31,184
Yeah, what about this kid?
What makes him important?

606
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:34,101
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
This kid's a Stone-cold brawler, man.

607
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,543
So a group of these cops,
they go to a couple of his fights, man.

608
00:38:40,544 --> 00:38:43,125
They pick him up on a couple
bullshit assault charges.

609
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:46,114
The flip him, man.
They make him an offer.

610
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,846
This kid knows people
from both gangs, man.

611
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:50,284
Nobody was gonna fuck with him.
And they figured he was money.

612
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:53,552
- They could get on, they could ride him.
- Skip to the point, Tino.

613
00:38:53,553 --> 00:38:56,574
So get this, man. These cops,
they know every drug house in town.

614
00:38:56,575 --> 00:38:58,190
They know where
the money's stashed.

615
00:38:58,191 --> 00:38:59,728
They know where the product's
coming in and going out.

616
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:01,194
The problem is they
don't have any evidence...

617
00:39:01,195 --> 00:39:02,593
to present to the judge
to get warrants.

618
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:04,132
and when they do get
the warrants,

619
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,533
it's too late...
The shit is gone.

620
00:39:05,534 --> 00:39:06,930
So they decide to take matters
into their own hands.

621
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:09,572
They hire this young fighter
as an enforcer.

622
00:39:09,573 --> 00:39:12,735
Picture this, man: Young fighter
running down division,

623
00:39:12,736 --> 00:39:15,541
hooking and jiving.
He ducks behind a house,

624
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:18,113
pulls down his mask,
pistol on his hip,

625
00:39:18,114 --> 00:39:20,862
kicks in this door,
beats the shit out of everybody.

626
00:39:20,864 --> 00:39:23,999
Get the fuck down on the floor!
Get the fuck on the floor!

627
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,933
it's motherfuckin' brutal, man.

628
00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:27,638
I know it sound like some bullshit,
but it's real, man.

629
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,637
- A few minutes later...
- Where's the fuckin' shit?

630
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:31,905
got the shit, man.
Couple seconds after that,

631
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:34,242
he back out on
the streets sprintin', man.

632
00:39:34,243 --> 00:39:37,898
The drugs, the money...
you name it, man.

633
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:39,846
And up the block, cop car...
Side window down.

634
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:42,852
He runs, tosses it
into the back. Bam!

635
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,654
Right back on division,
hooking and jivin', man...

636
00:39:48,655 --> 00:39:50,638
Going for a little
morning cardio,

637
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,610
running right down on Riverside.
It was seamless, man.

638
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:54,958
You know nobody gonna report
that kind of money missing.

639
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,147
You seriously expect us
to believe this bullshit?

640
00:39:57,148 --> 00:40:00,014
It's the truth, man. This kid
took down 20 or 30 scores.

641
00:40:00,015 --> 00:40:02,020
If everything you're
telling us is the truth,

642
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:03,851
why would they
want him killed?

643
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:05,151
The boys got greedy, man.

644
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,357
Shit was going smooth.
They wanted more.

645
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:09,456
They gave him more work than Michael
could handle by himself.

646
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:11,712
He had to get
his own crew.

647
00:40:11,713 --> 00:40:14,077
Come on, come on.

648
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,016
What were their names?

649
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:19,988
Cruz, Hicks and Thompson.

650
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:27,656
Do those names sound
familiar to you, lieutenant?

651
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:40,721
Three weeks ago, we fish
andre Cruz out of the water.

652
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:43,810
He's weighted down;
bullet hole to the forehead.

653
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:46,109
Probably been there
for days.

654
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,759
Takes us a week
to get a positive I.D.

655
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,381
Right? Chalk it up.
He's our first.

656
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:53,353
Second body... Carl Hicks.
Lowlife from the west side,

657
00:40:53,354 --> 00:40:55,320
found shot to death
along the riverside.

658
00:40:55,321 --> 00:40:58,491
Ballistics on both... 9mms.

659
00:40:58,492 --> 00:41:01,821
Now I bet you that when we pull
the slugs from Jacobs tonight,

660
00:41:01,822 --> 00:41:04,062
that we have a match with
these other two crime scenes.

661
00:41:04,063 --> 00:41:05,842
And that's a series.

662
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:08,734
Okay? One, two and three.

663
00:41:08,735 --> 00:41:10,530
What about the fourth man?

664
00:41:10,531 --> 00:41:12,654
Jack junior Thompson.

665
00:41:12,655 --> 00:41:17,058
He was shot to death tonight by the
same cops that killed Michael Pips.

666
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:20,006
So there's a four-Man crew
running around out there.

667
00:41:20,007 --> 00:41:22,780
But you still haven't
told us why they got burned.

668
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,809
You're not listening, man.
This guy's a boxer.

669
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,849
He was just using the money
to supplement his income.

670
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,429
About three months ago,
he had a fight club international...

671
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,703
These big-Time managers
in the crowd watching.

672
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:34,268
He promises them a show. This kid
starts getting all this attention.

673
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:36,243
He got money falling
out of his pockets, man.

674
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,942
It's like he hit the lotto. So he stops
taking the work from the cops.

675
00:41:39,943 --> 00:41:41,615
Problem is
his crew gets hungry.

676
00:41:41,616 --> 00:41:43,347
And they start
taking side work,

677
00:41:43,348 --> 00:41:45,784
all that's unauthorized
by the man.

678
00:41:45,785 --> 00:41:47,683
They call him in. They tell him
if he don't take care of his crew,

679
00:41:47,684 --> 00:41:49,017
they all goin' down.

680
00:41:49,018 --> 00:41:52,022
This is bullshit, man.
Y'all eatin'.

681
00:41:52,023 --> 00:41:54,529
What's going on?

682
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,259
They're gonna kill him
and his crew?

683
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,924
Nuh-Huh. They gonna leak it
to the street...

684
00:41:57,925 --> 00:41:59,798
that it was him and his crew
that took all their scores.

685
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:01,697
Man, everybody be gunnin'
for his shit.

686
00:42:01,698 --> 00:42:04,186
It look like one gang-Related
shooting after another.

687
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:08,708
Jacobs, he just stumbled into
some shit he wasn't ready for.

688
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:11,707
Whoever pulled the trigger
set this thing in motion.

689
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:13,322
Yeah, well, that's what
it looks like.

690
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:16,059
You still haven't told us what
the fighter's name is, Tino.

691
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,751
Michael... Michael Pips.

692
00:42:22,132 --> 00:42:24,971
Detective Jacobs said
his partner knew about this?

693
00:42:26,705 --> 00:42:28,042
I guess so.

694
00:42:28,043 --> 00:42:30,509
Hey, detective Evans...
Yes or no?

695
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,414
Yes, man.

696
00:42:32,415 --> 00:42:34,546
He knew.

697
00:42:34,548 --> 00:42:37,383
- And you believed him?
- No.

698
00:42:37,384 --> 00:42:39,850
All right.

699
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:42,089
What the fuck is the matter
with this nigga, man?

700
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,421
I thought it was
street bullshit...

701
00:42:44,422 --> 00:42:47,009
The stuff that Gangbangers
and Hoodrats...

702
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:50,275
tell each other to justify
their pathetic little lives.

703
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,163
Detective.

704
00:42:55,781 --> 00:43:00,084
I been on this job long enough
to read between the lines, fellas.

705
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:03,421
The only thing Tino gave us
was the name of the shooter...

706
00:43:03,422 --> 00:43:05,678
this kid Michael Pips.

707
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,876
That's our guy.
End of story.

708
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:11,015
Tino wants to start spinning
some fiction about dirty cops.

709
00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:13,446
I've heard it 1,000 times.

710
00:43:13,447 --> 00:43:15,535
So you gave no weight
to his intel?

711
00:43:15,537 --> 00:43:18,385
That's not what I said.

712
00:43:18,386 --> 00:43:22,023
Look at what he
actually gave us.

713
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:26,145
This kid Michael Pips,

714
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:29,162
not only
is he our shooter,

715
00:43:29,163 --> 00:43:32,832
but I guarantee you
we can tie both him and his crew...

716
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:36,387
to over a dozen unsolved
home invasions and burglaries...

717
00:43:36,388 --> 00:43:38,725
within the past 12 months.

718
00:43:38,726 --> 00:43:41,027
That's what he gave us.

719
00:43:44,631 --> 00:43:47,662
I repeat: Suspect in
6th street homicide...

720
00:43:47,663 --> 00:43:50,917
has been identified as one
Michael Alexander Pips...

721
00:43:50,918 --> 00:43:53,156
Paul Ida Paul Sam.

722
00:43:53,157 --> 00:43:55,388
Known residence:
1402 Franklin.

723
00:43:55,389 --> 00:43:57,809
I want an A.P.B.
on the suspect's vehicle...

724
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,343
an oldsmobile cutlass 1988,

725
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:04,014
License plate
david charles nora 2-3-9.

726
00:44:04,015 --> 00:44:06,132
- Copy that...
- What the fuck did he just do?

727
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:07,769
He just called it in.

728
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,634
You just painted a target
on that kid's head.

729
00:44:09,635 --> 00:44:11,686
Listen, if what you said
is even partially true,

730
00:44:11,687 --> 00:44:13,375
We need to get to Michael
before anyone else does.

731
00:44:13,376 --> 00:44:15,138
Man, this is bullshit.

732
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:17,045
Hey, you know those guys
Hicks and Cruz?

733
00:44:17,046 --> 00:44:18,878
Yeah, I know 'em.
I just don't know where they at.

734
00:44:18,879 --> 00:44:20,760
- And we do.
- They're dead, Tino.

735
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:22,981
This thing started
three weeks ago.

736
00:44:22,982 --> 00:44:24,463
Man, you gotta
get me out of here.

737
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:26,097
You gotta get me out
of this city now.

738
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:28,004
Calm down, Tino, all right?

739
00:44:28,005 --> 00:44:29,754
Long as you're with us,
nothing's gonna happen to you.

740
00:44:29,755 --> 00:44:32,025
- I promise.
- Where you takin' me?

741
00:44:32,026 --> 00:44:34,106
We need to verify
your information.

742
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:37,278
- Where you takin' me?
- Taking you to detective Evans.

743
00:44:37,279 --> 00:44:39,610
And if he's one of them,
I'm dead meat, right?

744
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:41,967
I need to talk to the D.A.
I need to talk to the feds.

745
00:44:41,968 --> 00:44:44,748
- Hey, shut up!
- Dino, as long as you're in our custody,

746
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,971
Nothing is gonna
happen to you.

747
00:44:46,972 --> 00:44:49,020
You understand me?
Nothing.

748
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,547
So it was your decision
to go to Evans.

749
00:44:54,548 --> 00:44:56,763
Yes.

750
00:44:56,764 --> 00:45:00,918
You knew who the shooter was. You had
a criminal informer in your custody...

751
00:45:00,919 --> 00:45:04,090
who happened to be the only person
that could connect that shooter...

752
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:06,338
with the murder of an
undercover police officer.

753
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:08,237
Why wouldn't you
just bring him in?

754
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:11,026
It wasn't as simple as that.

755
00:45:11,027 --> 00:45:13,026
It wasn't as simple
as that?

756
00:45:13,027 --> 00:45:14,999
He asked for
protective custody.

757
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,199
You violated
set protocols.

758
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,718
Now he's laying on the slab in the morgue
next to two dead officers

759
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,623
And a 19-year-old suspect.
Enlighten us.

760
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,411
Look, if what he was saying
was even remotely true,

761
00:45:29,412 --> 00:45:32,043
then the safest place
for him was with us.

762
00:45:32,044 --> 00:45:34,116
That was a hell
of a risk to take.

763
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:39,056
Well, we didn't know
what we were up against.

764
00:45:47,899 --> 00:45:49,828
Easy easy.

765
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:55,566
He's dead.

766
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:58,138
Hey hey hey hey!

767
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:02,176
What the fuck is going on?

768
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:05,192
Son of a bitch.

769
00:46:05,193 --> 00:46:07,430
He was burning
case files.

770
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,762
Where are they from?

771
00:46:09,763 --> 00:46:12,067
They're all over
the place, man.

772
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:15,907
Got a... Got a B&E,
home invasion...

773
00:46:15,908 --> 00:46:18,504
and a robbery case.

774
00:46:18,505 --> 00:46:20,194
All right,
what are you thinking?

775
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,793
I think that this means he knew
what was going down.

776
00:46:22,794 --> 00:46:24,999
Aw, so you're actually
believing this bullshit.

777
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,931
Listen, they had to destroy every piece of
evidence that could be tied back to them.

778
00:46:28,932 --> 00:46:31,003
What the fuck are you
talking about?

779
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:32,802
Check out the gun.

780
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:35,107
Look at this.

781
00:46:35,108 --> 00:46:36,707
Yeah, what am
i looking at?

782
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:39,847
- Old school 45 caliber, right?
- So what?

783
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:42,143
- What do we carry? 40's, huh?
- Standard issue.

784
00:46:42,144 --> 00:46:44,785
Exactly. Now how many
self-inflicted gunshot wounds...

785
00:46:44,786 --> 00:46:46,848
have you investigated, huh?

786
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:49,220
- Why would he use this?
- What the fuck you doing, man?

787
00:46:49,221 --> 00:46:51,521
You just contaminated
a crime scene.

788
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:54,658
This is bullshit. We don't have time
to wait for ballistics.

789
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:56,358
No fuckin' way, Shepherd.

790
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:58,329
No way my ass is going out
on the line for you.

791
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,062
Not like this!

792
00:47:00,063 --> 00:47:02,229
Look at the body, huh?

793
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,166
Why would Evans shoot himself
with a 45-Caliber pistol...

794
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:08,674
and have the gun fall perfectly
beneath his chair?

795
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:10,471
Use your head.

796
00:47:16,644 --> 00:47:18,115
Don't fucking do this, man.

797
00:47:27,259 --> 00:47:29,290
Look at that.

798
00:47:32,828 --> 00:47:35,294
Someone's trying
to clean up.

799
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,766
What the hell do you
think you were doing?!

800
00:47:39,767 --> 00:47:41,504
There wasn't any time!

801
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:43,285
You compromised everything,
do you know that?

802
00:47:43,286 --> 00:47:45,524
I'm not gonna cover up for
your actions tonight, detective!

803
00:47:45,525 --> 00:47:47,774
- No possible way!
- You're not listening to me!

804
00:47:47,775 --> 00:47:50,179
Evans couldn't have
possibly killed himself!

805
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,878
Thanks to your actions,
we can't prove it!

806
00:47:54,852 --> 00:47:57,349
- How could you let that happen?
- I tried to stop him.

807
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,522
- That's not good enough!
- The entire scene is contaminated.

808
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:03,254
I understand that, sir. There's no way
to justify his actions.

809
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,291
But they did yield results
that were necessary...

810
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:07,792
for our ongoing investigation.

811
00:48:07,793 --> 00:48:10,031
Jesus Christ!
Are you kidding me?

812
00:48:10,032 --> 00:48:13,870
It did have the appearance of someone
trying to clean up after themselves.

813
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:16,568
So now you're buying
into the conspiracy. Mmm?

814
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:19,306
What happened to all the "hoodrat"
and "street bullshit," detective?

815
00:48:19,307 --> 00:48:24,028
I said it had
the appearance, captain.

816
00:48:32,631 --> 00:48:35,103
Charles Edward 12,
do you copy? Over.

817
00:48:38,309 --> 00:48:40,805
Charles Edward 12?

818
00:48:40,806 --> 00:48:42,980
Copy.
Go for 12.

819
00:48:42,981 --> 00:48:45,578
Report a possible sighting
of the suspect vehicle.

820
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:47,984
Officers en route.

821
00:48:54,821 --> 00:48:57,292
Charles Edward 12,
this is 5 lincoln 9.

822
00:48:57,293 --> 00:48:58,608
What is your position?

823
00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:00,541
5 lincoln 9
eastbound on fox.

824
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:03,580
Heading towards...

825
00:49:03,581 --> 00:49:06,033
Charles Edward 12 en route.
Hold that position.

826
00:49:06,034 --> 00:49:08,733
- What the fuck is going on?
- Evans is dead.

827
00:49:08,734 --> 00:49:11,388
- What?
- He was burning case files.

828
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:13,356
This ain't how it's
supposed to go down, man.

829
00:49:13,357 --> 00:49:16,643
Left left left!
Take the bridge!

830
00:49:16,644 --> 00:49:19,191
I need to know:
was Evans dirty?

831
00:49:19,192 --> 00:49:21,398
- Was he on the take?
- I don't know.

832
00:49:21,399 --> 00:49:23,547
I told you this
was bullshit!

833
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:25,301
5 lincoln 9,
Charles Edward 12.

834
00:49:25,302 --> 00:49:27,616
Be advised: we're coming in
from the northwest side.

835
00:49:27,617 --> 00:49:30,408
Wilcox in front.
What is your position?

836
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:32,886
5 lincoln 9, now code 3, in
pursuit of suspect's vehicle...

837
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,995
eastbound on front...
Repeat... east on front...

838
00:49:34,996 --> 00:49:36,828
nearing dead end.
Request immediate backup.

839
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:39,398
Roger 5 lincoln 9.
Charles Edward 12

840
00:49:39,399 --> 00:49:43,670
Is 3 minutes E.T.A. box in the suspect
and hold the perimeter.

841
00:49:45,571 --> 00:49:48,442
Alright. Let's walk through it,
detective.

842
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:52,473
It's like a blur. It happens so fast
when you're actually in it.

843
00:49:52,474 --> 00:49:56,979
But from my perspective...

844
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,734
I see muzzle flashes coming from
the suspect's vehicle.

845
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:04,404
The patrol officers are
already pinned down.

846
00:50:04,405 --> 00:50:06,138
They're calling for backup.

847
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:10,691
Bullets crashed into
our car.

848
00:50:10,692 --> 00:50:15,262
And I hear the engine rev just as we're
spinning in behind the barricade.

849
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:16,784
I duck below the dash.

850
00:50:16,786 --> 00:50:18,851
We evacuate the vehicle.

851
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:22,006
Detective Shepherd makes
a move for Tino.

852
00:50:22,007 --> 00:50:24,905
I take up a position,
draw my weapon,

853
00:50:24,906 --> 00:50:27,277
Follow the other officers'
line of sight,

854
00:50:27,278 --> 00:50:30,227
lean over the hood
of the car.

855
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:33,015
I have a visual
on the suspect.

856
00:50:33,016 --> 00:50:34,246
I fire.

857
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:38,669
- How many shots?
- Four.

858
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,417
No, five...

859
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,356
right at the center
of mass.

860
00:50:44,357 --> 00:50:46,311
You definitely had a visual
on the suspect?

861
00:50:46,312 --> 00:50:47,861
Yes, sir.

862
00:50:47,862 --> 00:50:50,000
Just so we're clear...

863
00:50:51,335 --> 00:50:55,385
did you see the weapon
in the suspect's hand...

864
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,786
before you fired?

865
00:50:57,787 --> 00:50:59,808
Yes.

866
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:03,739
I only fired after
he engaged us first.

867
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,795
How many suspects did you see
when you entered the scene?

868
00:51:06,796 --> 00:51:08,345
Just the one.

869
00:51:08,346 --> 00:51:11,218
And the suspect's
vehicle, right?

870
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:13,015
That's correct.

871
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:16,337
The first responders reported
multiple suspects in the area.

872
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:18,476
Why would you go in there
without backup?

873
00:51:18,477 --> 00:51:21,125
Look, if Michael was in
that warehouse,

874
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:23,682
then we needed to get to him
before anyone else.

875
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:27,835
Even if you put yourself
and your partner in harm's way?

876
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:38,910
When we arrived,
Jack Thompson was firing on us.

877
00:51:38,911 --> 00:51:40,894
Why?

878
00:51:43,014 --> 00:51:46,381
The officers
had him pinned down.

879
00:51:46,382 --> 00:51:50,117
He was trapped.
There was no way out for him.

880
00:51:50,118 --> 00:51:52,458
Why would he fire on us?

881
00:51:52,459 --> 00:51:54,956
Like you just said,
he was trapped.

882
00:51:54,957 --> 00:51:56,746
They'd killed a cop
earlier in the night.

883
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,714
They were a four-man crew.

884
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:03,481
There was Cruz, Hicks,
Thompson and Michael Pips.

885
00:52:03,482 --> 00:52:05,732
Cruz and Hicks
were dead already.

886
00:52:07,471 --> 00:52:09,972
Who was in that tree line?

887
00:52:09,973 --> 00:52:11,392
Excuse me?

888
00:52:11,393 --> 00:52:14,673
Who pinned us down
on the tree line?

889
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:16,330
Movement, tree line!

890
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,929
You said they were bangers...

891
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:23,018
wealthy street boys,
Vice Lords.

892
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:24,989
If it wasn't one,
it was the other.

893
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:28,522
No, we thought they were bangers
because of what Tino told us.

894
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:32,775
What did we really see?

895
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,564
We're fucking sitting ducks
out here!

896
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:45,824
Michael said he saw three officers
at the 6th street park shooting.

897
00:52:45,825 --> 00:52:48,428
He said that...
He said "three".

898
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:50,660
Let's get back on track.

899
00:52:52,028 --> 00:52:54,097
Right there.

900
00:52:54,099 --> 00:52:56,163
"Lerner, Cominsky and Johnson".

901
00:52:58,972 --> 00:53:01,951
Those are the same three officers
that shot down Michael Pips tonight.

902
00:53:04,892 --> 00:53:08,012
Where was the third officer
when we arrived?

903
00:53:12,634 --> 00:53:14,765
I don't like what
you're insinuating.

904
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:17,472
Where was Johnson?

905
00:53:19,888 --> 00:53:22,261
Johnson arrived after you went
to the warehouse.

906
00:53:22,262 --> 00:53:24,092
It's right here.
There's no way...

907
00:53:24,093 --> 00:53:26,192
you could have seen that
from your perspective, detective.

908
00:53:26,193 --> 00:53:28,414
Well, who confirmed his arrival?
Lerner and Cominsky, right?

909
00:53:28,415 --> 00:53:30,380
Yo, let's get the fuck
out of here, man.

910
00:53:42,978 --> 00:53:44,877
Did the suspect say he saw
three uniformed officers...

911
00:53:44,878 --> 00:53:47,350
at 6th street
earlier in the day?

912
00:53:47,351 --> 00:53:49,764
Yeah, he said three.
But taken out of context,

913
00:53:49,765 --> 00:53:51,702
it could mean anything.

914
00:53:51,703 --> 00:53:55,191
So what do you think
he meant, detective?

915
00:53:55,192 --> 00:53:57,906
It's gangland.
Are you kidding me?

916
00:53:57,907 --> 00:54:00,845
We've had a series of shootings
in the last couple of weeks.

917
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:04,916
You tell me, captain,
have we stepped up patrols?

918
00:54:09,355 --> 00:54:12,285
Exactly.

919
00:54:12,286 --> 00:54:15,027
What do you think
happened out there?

920
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,929
I think it was
a righteous shoot.

921
00:54:20,931 --> 00:54:23,184
Hey, eyes on me, buddy!

922
00:54:23,185 --> 00:54:26,616
I think the suspect was agitated
beyond the point of no return.

923
00:54:26,617 --> 00:54:29,339
And had detective Shepherd
not got between us,

924
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:33,694
I wouldn't hesitate
to put the suspect down.

925
00:54:33,695 --> 00:54:35,858
Had you tried to
talk him down?

926
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:38,931
He had already fired
on us both, lieutenant.

927
00:54:40,897 --> 00:54:44,037
So, yes,

928
00:54:44,038 --> 00:54:48,374
If I had the chance to
do it again, i'd kill his ass.

929
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:52,511
Listen, we can circle
around this again and again...

930
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:54,577
and look at it from
every different angle,

931
00:54:54,578 --> 00:54:57,082
but this is gonna come down
to one important fact:

932
00:54:57,083 --> 00:55:00,565
He fired on us and
continued to fire on us...

933
00:55:00,566 --> 00:55:02,953
knowing we were
police officers.

934
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,063
Were those other officers
justified in killing this kid?

935
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:17,233
I ask myself...

936
00:55:20,074 --> 00:55:24,119
had they not, would me and my partner
be sitting here right now?

937
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:29,929
But wait a minute!
You're not listening to me!

938
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,981
Because it's bullshit!
It's bullshit!

939
00:55:31,982 --> 00:55:34,667
Why? Because it doesn't fit
in a tiny little box for you?

940
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:36,616
I'm done with this.
You know where I stand.

941
00:55:44,862 --> 00:55:47,224
I'm prepared to file
an unlisted report.

942
00:55:47,225 --> 00:55:49,598
We expect your full
cooperation.

943
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,662
I can't commit
to anything,

944
00:55:51,663 --> 00:55:53,769
not till I speak
to the administration.

945
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,636
- Sorry.
- So what are you saying?

946
00:55:55,637 --> 00:55:57,851
You're not even gonna
look into this?

947
00:55:57,852 --> 00:56:00,106
We're moving on, detective.

948
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:03,360
What if Tino is right?

949
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:05,277
What if what he's saying
is true?

950
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:08,465
We don't owe it to the public
to make sure that our house is clean?

951
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:10,564
There's no evidence that would
warrant that investigation.

952
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:13,171
You've made sure of that.

953
00:56:13,172 --> 00:56:17,642
Who could have set
this whole thing in motion?

954
00:56:17,643 --> 00:56:21,025
It had to be...
It had to be somebody...

955
00:56:21,026 --> 00:56:24,877
with complete tactical control
over all units involved.

956
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,534
Somebody shot one of ours.

957
00:56:30,535 --> 00:56:32,455
Now it's your responsibility
to bring him in to justice...

958
00:56:32,456 --> 00:56:36,344
at all costs.
Do you understand me?

959
00:56:37,677 --> 00:56:40,664
Who could have set
this whole thing in motion?

960
00:56:40,665 --> 00:56:42,931
Are you listening to me,
detective?

961
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:49,100
It's you.

962
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:53,873
You sent us on a one-way mission
to retaliate against a cop killer.

963
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:59,009
This blood's on your hands.

964
00:57:02,913 --> 00:57:06,153
Don't worry. I have too much respect
for the department...

965
00:57:06,154 --> 00:57:09,140
to make this
a public matter.

966
00:57:09,141 --> 00:57:11,139
I'll clean up
these reports...

967
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,290
to avoid
a criminal prosecution.

968
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:15,313
There's no way I'm gonna
save your job.

969
00:57:15,314 --> 00:57:17,476
You're done.

970
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:20,665
I don't know how
i didn't see this before.

971
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:22,948
Search without a warrant,
tampering with evidence,

972
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:25,937
the death of a criminal informant
while he's in your custody.

973
00:57:25,938 --> 00:57:28,142
That's just the beginning.

974
00:57:28,143 --> 00:57:30,959
It would have to be somebody
that had complete access...

975
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,214
to all the criminal case files.

976
00:57:34,215 --> 00:57:37,194
Yeah.

977
00:57:37,195 --> 00:57:39,983
Get the badge,
change out the shells,

978
00:57:39,984 --> 00:57:41,233
clean this place up.

979
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:44,421
You got it.
Check over there.

980
00:57:44,422 --> 00:57:46,837
- Come on, guys, hurry up.
- Grab his badge. Come on.

981
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,148
- Let's get out of here, boys.
- Hurry up!

982
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:56,230
Someone... Someone who
could control...

983
00:57:56,232 --> 00:57:58,701
all of the crime scenes.

984
00:58:03,557 --> 00:58:07,012
Someone who could control
the timing...

985
00:58:07,013 --> 00:58:08,944
of all of the patrolled zones...

986
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:12,083
so there could be
no witnesses.

987
00:58:12,084 --> 00:58:13,048
- Go!
- Lie down!

988
00:58:13,049 --> 00:58:15,603
Give me the gun!
Give me the gun!

989
00:58:20,476 --> 00:58:22,774
That's you.

990
00:58:22,775 --> 00:58:25,446
That's you, lieutenant.

991
00:58:25,447 --> 00:58:28,245
I'm gonna have your badges.
I want your names.

992
00:58:28,246 --> 00:58:31,251
I want your names.
I want your names.

993
00:58:33,017 --> 00:58:36,320
Someone who could control
every aspect...

994
00:58:36,321 --> 00:58:38,521
of what was reported.

995
00:58:41,043 --> 00:58:44,313
I got a sworn statement from
an officer in good standing.

996
00:58:44,314 --> 00:58:47,878
She says the only thing that happened
that night was street justice...

997
00:58:47,879 --> 00:58:50,117
a retaliation shooting
from a rival gang.

998
00:58:50,118 --> 00:58:51,734
It's that easy.

999
00:58:51,735 --> 00:58:55,205
And this is the only thing
the public's gonna hear.

1000
00:58:55,206 --> 00:58:58,577
Anything else is
considered fiction.

1001
00:59:00,561 --> 00:59:03,416
I'll need your badge
and your gun.

1002
00:59:06,366 --> 00:59:08,935
Hey.

1003
00:59:08,936 --> 00:59:12,390
Briggs, you saw
what happened tonight.

1004
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:14,456
It's over, Shepherd.

1005
00:59:14,457 --> 00:59:17,812
There's only one move
to make.

1006
00:59:17,813 --> 00:59:20,643
I expect nothing less
than your full cooperation.

1007
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,399
And you'll have it.

1008
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,081
You write up the report.
He'll sign his name.

1009
00:59:26,082 --> 00:59:28,223
I guarantee it.

1010
00:59:30,987 --> 00:59:32,458
Why?

1011
00:59:32,459 --> 00:59:34,690
- Why'd you do it?
- Get him out of here!

1012
00:59:34,691 --> 00:59:36,462
Huh?

1013
00:59:36,463 --> 00:59:38,461
He was innocent.

1014
00:59:38,462 --> 00:59:40,067
You put that in your report,

1015
00:59:40,068 --> 00:59:41,467
- you piece of shit!
- Don't do this!

1016
00:59:41,468 --> 00:59:42,550
- Now!
- Don't do this here.

1017
00:59:42,551 --> 00:59:44,316
- He was innocent!
- That's enough!

1018
00:59:44,317 --> 00:59:48,121
Put that in your report,
you son of a bitch!

1019
00:59:48,122 --> 00:59:50,309
I'm not taking
the fall for you.

1020
00:59:53,911 --> 00:59:58,247
And you... You saw
what happened tonight.

1021
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:01,352
- I won't let them bury it.
- All right.

1022
01:00:01,353 --> 01:00:03,852
- I won't let them bury it.
- All right, all right.

1023
01:00:03,853 --> 01:00:05,324
Come on.

1024
01:01:21,531 --> 01:01:24,293
We're right here
moving towards the alcove.

1025
01:01:24,294 --> 01:01:28,966
We turn the corner. Shots fire.
We duck behind the wall.

1026
01:01:33,304 --> 01:01:35,507
Police officers!
Drop the gun!

1027
01:01:35,508 --> 01:01:38,607
And we're here.
Who did you see?

1028
01:01:38,608 --> 01:01:42,345
Man, I didn't do this!
I didn't kill that fuckin' cop!

1029
01:01:42,346 --> 01:01:45,450
Drop the fucking gun, Michael.
We have you surrounded.

1030
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:50,172
Who did you see? Just stay there
and let me get a shot off.

1031
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:54,177
Let me get a shot off, Shepherd.
It's clear.

1032
01:01:54,178 --> 01:01:56,823
Let me take this guy out.
Just stay there.

1033
01:02:02,063 --> 01:02:04,169
Who did you see?

1034
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:06,349
Who did you see?
Who were you looking at?

1035
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:09,489
Who did you want to hear?
What was going on?

1036
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,422
The tree line.

1037
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:29,106
There's no light.

1038
01:02:29,108 --> 01:02:31,913
Nobody would have
seen you back here.

1039
01:02:33,296 --> 01:02:36,184
Where were the shots?

1040
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:37,600
Right there.

1041
01:02:37,601 --> 01:02:39,883
Right there.

1042
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:45,542
This is where you fired,
you sons of bitches.

1043
01:02:45,543 --> 01:02:48,543
Right over here.

1044
01:02:48,544 --> 01:02:50,481
Right here.

1045
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:59,117
C.S.I. misses a couple
every time.

1046
01:02:59,118 --> 01:03:01,523
.40 s&w.

1047
01:03:03,173 --> 01:03:05,011
What did he say?

1048
01:03:05,012 --> 01:03:07,209
.45 caliber, old school.
Right?

1049
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:09,348
- So what?
- What do we carry? 40's.

1050
01:03:09,349 --> 01:03:11,148
- Huh?
- Standard issue.

1051
01:03:17,736 --> 01:03:19,807
What did you say?

1052
01:03:19,808 --> 01:03:21,803
What did you tell them?

1053
01:03:21,804 --> 01:03:24,310
Ballistics on both... 9mms.

1054
01:03:24,311 --> 01:03:28,043
Now, I bet you that when we pull
the slugs from Jacobs tonight,

1055
01:03:28,044 --> 01:03:30,747
that we have a match with these
other two crime scenes.

1056
01:03:30,748 --> 01:03:32,413
And that's a series.

1057
01:03:32,414 --> 01:03:35,385
Okay? One, two and three.

1058
01:03:35,387 --> 01:03:36,703
9mm.

1059
01:03:38,076 --> 01:03:42,412
You saw three cops.
Can you identify them?

1060
01:03:42,413 --> 01:03:45,558
Lower your weapon. Look at him, Michael.
He's lowering his gun.

1061
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:49,351
You blocked my shot,
you son of a bitch.

1062
01:03:49,352 --> 01:03:52,155
You wanted to make sure
your boys were safe.

1063
01:03:54,822 --> 01:03:57,225
Detective Stephen Briggs,
metro P.D.

1064
01:03:57,226 --> 01:03:59,560
I need the chief
homicide detective.

1065
01:03:59,561 --> 01:04:01,498
Connect me now!

1066
01:04:49,994 --> 01:04:54,262
Yeah, it's me.
Meet me outside in five minutes.

1067
01:04:54,263 --> 01:04:55,661
Okay.

1068
01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:13,535
Hey, you should
put that away.

1069
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,655
People get hurt all
the time with those things.

1070
01:06:17,656 --> 01:06:20,160
You brought everything, right?

1071
01:06:20,161 --> 01:06:22,326
Yes, I did.

1072
01:06:22,327 --> 01:06:26,447
You think you went
a little overboard in there?

1073
01:06:26,448 --> 01:06:28,095
We got away with it,
didn't we?

1074
01:06:28,096 --> 01:06:30,035
Crime scenes are all bunk.

1075
01:06:30,036 --> 01:06:31,984
The lieutenant's running around
trying to cover his ass.

1076
01:06:34,975 --> 01:06:37,828
We're free and clear,
my friend.

1077
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:43,782
Besides, you think they're really
gonna believe a word I said?

1078
01:06:43,783 --> 01:06:47,571
Streets are open.
Time to roll.

1079
01:06:50,921 --> 01:06:53,309
Yeah, I got it.

1080
01:06:55,273 --> 01:06:56,997
Let's go.

1081
01:06:56,998 --> 01:06:59,063
Yeah.

1082
01:06:59,064 --> 01:07:00,378
Ready?

1083
01:07:20,986 --> 01:07:25,107
So when do i
get my cut?

1084
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:27,822
Listen, you get me across
the Canadian border first...

1085
01:07:27,823 --> 01:07:30,227
and then we'll talk
next steps.

1086
01:07:30,228 --> 01:07:31,560
That's bullshit.

1087
01:07:31,561 --> 01:07:33,493
I'm the one that took
all the risks last night.

1088
01:07:33,494 --> 01:07:35,516
Let me tell you something:
If it wasn't for me,

1089
01:07:35,517 --> 01:07:37,747
my partner would have shot
all your guys in the tree line.

1090
01:07:37,748 --> 01:07:39,886
We'd be in the fucking
shit right now.

1091
01:07:39,887 --> 01:07:41,519
Do you understand?

1092
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,243
That's not to mention that
your staging of a suicide...

1093
01:07:45,244 --> 01:07:47,674
It leaves a lot
to be desired, okay?

1094
01:07:47,675 --> 01:07:49,411
I've been cleaning up
your mistakes all night.

1095
01:07:49,412 --> 01:07:51,662
- Mistakes?
- Yeah.

1096
01:07:51,663 --> 01:07:54,265
Your mistake is you should have never
let more than Michael Pips in this thing.

1097
01:07:54,266 --> 01:07:56,333
He couldn't have taken
all those houses down alone.

1098
01:07:56,334 --> 01:07:59,121
Well, his crew, they could
have exposed all of us.

1099
01:07:59,122 --> 01:08:02,069
They didn't. Listen, captain,
this thing is over.

1100
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:06,172
Okay? And there's nothing
that can tie us back to any of it.

1101
01:08:06,173 --> 01:08:09,913
So don't go playing
Monday-morning quarterback now.

1102
01:08:13,984 --> 01:08:16,066
I get your ass
over that border,

1103
01:08:16,067 --> 01:08:18,605
you are gone forever.
You understand me?

1104
01:08:18,606 --> 01:08:21,388
Yeah, I wouldn't be complaining
that much if I was you.

1105
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:24,825
I am about to make you
a very rich man.

1106
01:08:26,715 --> 01:08:28,514
I'm about to be.

1107
01:08:31,214 --> 01:08:35,084
Need to clear traffic ahead.
We are moving to point.

1108
01:08:46,767 --> 01:08:48,931
- Shit.
- Move it, all. Let's go.

1109
01:08:48,932 --> 01:08:50,887
- Back me up!
- Let's go!

1110
01:08:50,888 --> 01:08:52,536
- Shit.
- Move!

1111
01:08:52,537 --> 01:08:55,326
Go go go!

1112
01:08:55,327 --> 01:08:58,073
Come on!

1113
01:09:34,861 --> 01:09:37,110
Cover me!

1114
01:09:39,316 --> 01:09:40,878
Go go, let's go!
Let's go!

1115
01:09:43,037 --> 01:09:44,803
Let's go behind
the warehouse!

1116
01:09:44,804 --> 01:09:46,618
- Move back!
- Come on! Go go!

1117
01:09:49,706 --> 01:09:51,555
Come on, let's go!

1118
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:00,732
Move back!

1119
01:10:04,852 --> 01:10:06,824
- Ahh!
- Move move move!

1120
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,745
Drop it!

1121
01:10:13,746 --> 01:10:15,378
Ahhh!

1122
01:10:16,919 --> 01:10:19,600
I go! I go, I go!

1123
01:10:28,525 --> 01:10:30,198
Reload!

1124
01:10:32,799 --> 01:10:34,670
- Ready?
- Let's go!

1125
01:10:49,468 --> 01:10:51,897
Cover me!
I'm going for an opening here!

1126
01:11:06,344 --> 01:11:08,118
He's in the warehouse.

1127
01:11:08,119 --> 01:11:10,283
Help's coming.
Stay down.

1128
01:11:31,574 --> 01:11:33,171
Shepherd!

1129
01:11:59,244 --> 01:12:00,816
Ahhh!

1130
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,682
You hurt yourself, Shepherd!

1131
01:12:54,683 --> 01:12:56,754
You said too much!

1132
01:12:56,755 --> 01:13:00,118
You didn't think I was
gonna check your story?

1133
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:03,390
Tell you the truth, I didn't
think you gave a fuck, Briggs!

1134
01:13:03,391 --> 01:13:06,428
"Let the animals
kill each other," right?

1135
01:13:06,429 --> 01:13:08,127
Yeah.

1136
01:13:08,128 --> 01:13:12,467
Didn't count on
you knowing Jacobs.

1137
01:13:21,844 --> 01:13:24,073
You killed detective Jacobs!

1138
01:13:24,074 --> 01:13:28,611
You killed Hicks
and Cruz!

1139
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:31,235
And you set up Evans
to take the fall!

1140
01:13:31,236 --> 01:13:33,666
You were cleaning up
tonight!

1141
01:13:35,308 --> 01:13:38,036
That's right, pal.
You walked me right through it!

1142
01:13:38,037 --> 01:13:41,311
You even did
the report for me.

1143
01:13:47,065 --> 01:13:49,901
What are you gonna do now,
detective?

1144
01:14:08,087 --> 01:14:11,719
You got no play, Shepherd!
The building's surrounded!

1145
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,508
This goes up a lot higher
than you know.

1146
01:14:14,509 --> 01:14:18,930
Trust me, Briggs, there's still
time for you to get in, pal.

1147
01:14:18,931 --> 01:14:21,293
You're not gonna make it out!
Give it up!

1148
01:14:21,295 --> 01:14:25,066
Your boys shot everyone that
can connect me to this crime.

1149
01:14:25,067 --> 01:14:29,039
The fucked-up thing is I wanted
to include you in this, Briggs.

1150
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,570
I did!

1151
01:14:30,571 --> 01:14:33,574
Everyone else said you were
too much of a Loose Cannon.

1152
01:14:33,575 --> 01:14:36,879
What do you say?
I'll make you a rich man.

1153
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,312
There's still plenty of money
to go around.

1154
01:14:40,313 --> 01:14:42,219
Huh? What do you say?

1155
01:14:43,769 --> 01:14:46,323
- What do you say, Briggs?
- No, you're trapped, Shepherd!

1156
01:14:46,324 --> 01:14:48,455
There's no way out for you!

1157
01:14:48,456 --> 01:14:50,828
You don't know how high up
this thing goes!

1158
01:15:14,234 --> 01:15:15,950
Easy.

1159
01:15:15,951 --> 01:15:17,034
Whoa.

1160
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:53,019
Well, thank you, detective.

1161
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:56,166
You can take it
from here, lieutenant.

1162
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:19,323
You don't sound convinced.

1163
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:24,446
Everything fits too perfectly
in this case.

1164
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:31,936
What do you want me to do?

1165
01:16:35,275 --> 01:16:37,525
Show me his statements.

1166
01:16:37,527 --> 01:16:39,581
I can't do that.

1167
01:16:44,602 --> 01:16:47,398
I just want to know
what he's saying.

1168
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:53,777
These reports are
for our eyes only.

1169
01:17:09,043 --> 01:17:12,596
Just keep him here
for awhile.

1170
01:17:12,597 --> 01:17:14,563
Just keep him talking.

1171
01:17:17,061 --> 01:17:19,598
What do you expect to find?

1172
01:17:19,599 --> 01:17:21,298
I don't know.

1173
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:44,735
But if there was
somebody else involved,

1174
01:17:44,736 --> 01:17:48,225
it's somebody that knows
our system inside and out.

1175
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:42,473
No no.

1176
01:18:42,474 --> 01:18:44,212
No! God!

1177
01:18:57,943 --> 01:19:01,699
What if you're right,
detective?

1178
01:19:03,915 --> 01:19:07,935
Then we've found
our cop killer.
