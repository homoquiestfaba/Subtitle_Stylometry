1
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,447
( music playing )

2
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:42,576
Wow, that was
a huge crowd.

3
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,579
I know. 150 lunches
served in record time.

4
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:49,550
Great exercise.
I can quit the gym now.

5
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,586
Peg, please.
You haven't set foot
in a gym in a decade.

6
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,156
I know, and look at me.
Good genes.

7
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,491
Yeah, some people
got all the DNA.

8
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,360
Stop.
You have great genes.

9
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,796
If you just put
a little effort into it--
and those jeans...

10
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,465
- Ah!
- ...not happening.

11
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:05,866
I love these jeans.

12
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,269
They are comfy,
broken in.

13
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,737
And should have been
retired with Clinton.

14
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,871
Excuse me.

15
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,773
Come on, please let me
shop for you.

16
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:16,144
No, thank you. I have
more important things
on my plate right now.

17
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,612
Oh, right.
What time should I be
at your house tomorrow?

18
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,614
2:00 and don't be late.

19
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:22,483
I won't be.
I'm starving.

20
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:23,717
You remember your part?

21
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,219
Yes,
I've been practicing.

22
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:26,620
I'm not going
to let you down.

23
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:29,290
I know you been
waiting for this
moment since...

24
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,192
well, my memory
doesn't go back
that far.

25
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:35,196
I know and it
is going to be
completely perfect.

26
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,666
You going
to just stand there

27
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,168
or you going to hand me
some trays?

28
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,670
Oh, yeah. I guess
I should do some work,

29
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,838
keep my awesome figure.

30
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,540
Okay, that's good.

31
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:48,276
( scoffs )

32
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,313
Oh, everything was
delicious, Deb.

33
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:53,781
I couldn't eat
another bite.

34
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,749
So I'll just have
10 more bites.

35
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,651
( laughing )

36
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:01,722
Deb, Jenna,
you outdid yourself
on this amazing meal.

37
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,257
Well, it was
the least we could do.

38
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,758
And don't give me
any of the credit.

39
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,194
She didn't let me
do anything.

40
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:09,363
No, not after that
one Thanksgiving. Uh-uh.

41
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:14,202
- I will never
live that down, ever.
- Why? What happened?

42
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:17,171
I was home from college
and my mom was knee-deep

43
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:19,873
in one of her fund-raisers,
so I offered to help her.

44
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,510
Jenna, let me ask you,
how long does it take

45
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:26,780
to cook a 22-pound turkey
at 150 degrees?

46
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,383
- 11 days.
- ( laughing )

47
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:32,286
I don't mind.

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,555
I appreciate
my girl's effort.

49
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:37,558
Well, you're welcome,
but she still did not
let me do any of this.

50
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,759
I let you help.

51
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,961
You let me slice the bread.

52
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:45,266
Oh, and this is
the best slicing
I have ever seen.

53
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,635
- Mm-hmm.
- And now that
I've touched it,

54
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,205
- I, you know, have to eat it.
- Debra: I'm cutting you off.

55
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,642
Well, I think
I'm ready for a toast.
Deb, would you help me?

56
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,277
- I can help you.
- No, no.

57
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,212
We got it.

58
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,686
- Why so nervous?
- I barely ate.

59
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,490
I just kept pushing the food
from one side of the plate
to the other.

60
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,559
You think
Jenna noticed?

61
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,228
You guys never change.

62
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,897
You're going to be fine.
Just speak from your heart.

63
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,566
What's the worst
that could happen?

64
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,868
She could say no.

65
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,771
Mm. She could.

66
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,311
( groans )

67
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,780
( taps glass )
I'd like to make
a toast to Jenna.

68
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,386
I still remember the day,

69
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,853
December 7th,
two years ago,

70
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,889
when we were told
that a new teacher

71
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,791
would be starting
after the winter break.

72
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,494
The first time she walked
in the teachers' lounge,

73
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:50,030
every guy in there
was gawking at her.

74
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,465
No.

75
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,534
But I leaned over
to Coach Kirk,

76
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,036
and I said,
"That right there

77
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,006
is the girl
I'm going to marry."

78
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,875
So you can imagine
how devastated I was
when she turned down

79
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,844
every date
I asked her out on

80
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,414
repeatedly
for five months.

81
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,849
I did not think
it was appropriate
to date a coworker.

82
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,451
And he
didn't recycle.

83
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,986
- Ooh.
- Didn't. I do now.

84
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,023
I have that effect
on people. ( giggles )

85
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:19,860
Finally, though, she caved
to my irresistible charm

86
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,496
- and my striking
good looks...
- Oh, yeah.

87
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,300
...and we've been
inseparable ever since.

88
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,835
So I'd like you
to raise your glass

89
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,671
and toast
my favorite lady,

90
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,673
Jenna Wolf.
Hear, hear.

91
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,075
- To Jenna.
- To Jenna.

92
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,377
Cheers.

93
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,413
Wait. Don't drink that.

94
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,449
Stop. That's not
the right glass.

95
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:42,716
There's nothing
in that glass.

96
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,785
I have champagne.
Isn't that all I need?

97
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,720
Nope. Wrong.

98
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,790
- And go.
- Got it.

99
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:53,861
- ( backbeat playing )
- What are you doing?

100
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,564
What...

101
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,533
And now for your
listening pleasure,

102
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,669
a spoken-word poem.

103
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,404
What?

104
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,906
* Jenna, you are
a fine young lass *

105
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,375
Did he do this?

106
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:08,676
- Oh, this is all him.
- What?

107
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,945
* Jenna, you teach
a first-grade class *

108
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:12,980
I do.

109
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,815
What is happening?

110
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,485
* Jenna, your nose
deep in a book *

111
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,052
Mom, did you
know about this?

112
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:23,056
* Jenna, you need
to learn to cook *

113
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,726
- O-Okay. Okay.
- It's true.

114
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,962
* Jenna recycles
everything *

115
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,568
* Look there, Jenna,
is that a ring? *

116
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,438
( gasps )

117
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,840
Jenna, our love
was meant to be.

118
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,513
Jenna, will you marry me?

119
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,485
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes? Yes. Yes.

120
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,627
- Oh.
- ( applause )

121
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,495
Yay!

122
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,896
You guys
are amazing.

123
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,798
It was all Chris.

124
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,934
Yeah, he really
just wants to be
a rap artist.

125
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,771
A schoolteacher
with street cred?

126
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,442
That's enough of that.

127
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,510
Now we've got
a wedding to plan.

128
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,884
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Mom.

129
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,720
Look at this.

130
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,756
Wow, putting the cart
before the ring
on my finger.

131
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,859
Oh, come on, Jenna.
We all knew it was coming.

132
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,060
You knew.

133
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,128
I hoped.

134
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,097
Mom,
I was thinking,

135
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,100
maybe Chris and I
could get married at
the Hollister Ranch

136
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,603
on March 7th,
like you and Dad.

137
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:45,105
- Really?
- Yeah.

138
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,175
You and Dad have
such a long and
happy marriage.

139
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,645
Maybe the Hollister
Ranch on that date's
good luck.

140
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,947
That would be lovely.

141
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,984
In fact, I already
have it on the list.

142
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,190
Nice, cozy,
traditional
family wedding.

143
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,025
It's the perfect way
for Chris and I

144
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,927
to start our lives
together.

145
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,830
Mom,
I'm getting married.

146
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,767
Beautiful.

147
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:17,437
( bell rings )

148
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,977
Chris,
I've been thinking.

149
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,647
We're getting married,

150
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,182
probably going
to start a family soon,

151
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:32,853
and I know nothing
about my DNA.

152
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,055
Your parents are
Debra and Carl Wolf.

153
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,090
You may not
have their DNA,

154
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,092
but everything you are
is because of them.

155
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,628
What more do you
need to know?

156
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,229
I know. I know.

157
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,232
And all I ever
needed to know
was that Haley Anderson

158
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,901
was a teenager
who couldn't
take care of a baby,

159
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:51,238
and my parents adopted me
at two-days old.

160
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,173
I don't know. I've...

161
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,176
been thinking a lot
about her lately.

162
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,178
Who is she?

163
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,948
Do I look like her?

164
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,050
Are our personalities
similar?

165
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,219
And what
are you saying?

166
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:09,222
I want to meet her, Chris.

167
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,559
I looked her up.
I couldn't find her,

168
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,994
so we'd have to go through
the adoption agency.

169
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:17,030
How do you think
your mother's going
to feel about that?

170
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,633
I don't know.

171
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,675
So what do you think?

172
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,811
Jenna,
I've always told you

173
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,813
if you have curiosity,

174
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,848
let's satisfy it.

175
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:38,919
I just don't want you
to have any expectations.

176
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,821
We don't know
if she'll be open to it.

177
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,291
I know.

178
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,895
But we can
reach out to her

179
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,197
and see if she's willing.

180
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,065
I'll call the agency
in the morning

181
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,867
and they'll
make contact for us.

182
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,170
But you're
really okay with it?

183
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,807
I'm really okay with it.

184
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,109
And you're
really okay with it?

185
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,945
Why does everyone
keep asking me if
I'm okay with it?

186
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,346
Of course
I'm okay with it.

187
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,881
She's her blood.

188
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:10,818
Carl, blood does
not make a family.

189
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,853
You think I'm going
to be threatened
by a woman

190
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,855
who gave me
the greatest
gift of my life

191
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,124
and never looked back?

192
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,861
I just worry
how this will all
affect her, honey.

193
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,130
I think she's
going to be okay

194
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,798
no matter
how it turns out.

195
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,267
She's strong
like her mother.

196
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,970
- And stubborn as a mule.
- Ooh, that's nice.

197
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,805
We don't know
anything about
this woman, though.

198
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,206
She could have
moved to Dubai.

199
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,808
Or if she's
even still alive.

200
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,343
What if she's broke?

201
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,613
What if she asks us for money
to pay the gas bill?

202
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,314
I've got a wedding
to pay for, honey.

203
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,050
Carl, back it down.

204
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,753
We don't even know if
we're going to find her,

205
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:49,356
so let's not put a lock
on the checkbook yet.

206
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,291
I'll call
the agency tomorrow.

207
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,726
We'll hope for the best.

208
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,795
All right.

209
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,931
But if she does
ask for money,
the answer is no.

210
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,767
- ( chuckles )
- ( grumbles )

211
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,710
I wish I had
good news, Deb,

212
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,079
but the Irving Foundation
is done.

213
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,282
All assets
have been frozen.

214
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,284
How bad is it, really?

215
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,655
If we can't
appeal to 'em,

216
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,291
we're going to be forced
to close our doors.

217
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,763
I need you to go
to our biggest donors

218
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:32,165
and beg, plead.

219
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,934
I don't care.
Whatever it takes,

220
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,769
get 'em to step up.

221
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,910
J-Jenna, you have to--

222
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,311
you have
to roll it thinner

223
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,179
so that it goes across
the entire pie tin.

224
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,749
See what I mean?
Mom, you only

225
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,083
let me do the menial
cooking tasks.

226
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,352
- Mm-hmm.
- Honey, if I were you,

227
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,054
I'd use it
to my advantage.

228
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,188
She makes me
do everything.

229
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,189
Speaking
of everything, Carl,

230
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,858
can you take out
the trash?

231
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,359
Of course, dear.

232
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,961
- ( mambo music playing )
- Always, dear.

233
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,330
- Oh, no.
- Anything you say, dear.

234
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,732
Not the dance.

235
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,266
Oh, thank you, honey.

236
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,068
You see that
right there, Chris?

237
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,436
Watch and learn.

238
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,438
- No.
- That is the secret

239
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,406
to a long-lasting
marriage.

240
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,042
You know, I'm not
as dumb as I look.

241
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,210
I learned that one
from my parents
a long time ago.

242
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,746
If you got to dance,
I'll dance.

243
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:19,780
( both laugh )

244
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,886
So anyway,
I've been waiting

245
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,421
to tell you
some good news.

246
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,291
I got a call
from the adoption agency,

247
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:34,294
and Haley is willing
to meet with you.

248
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,799
They've coordinated
a time and a place.

249
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,468
What did they say?

250
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,303
What does
she look like?

251
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,372
Does she
still live here?
What does she do?

252
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,408
I've got
a time and a place.
That's all I know.

253
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,011
Wow.

254
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,280
Um...

255
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,283
I'm-- I'm so excited
to meet her.

256
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,285
I'm shaking.

257
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,988
Hey, do you
think that you

258
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,455
could take
an hour off work

259
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,857
and come with me?

260
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,425
Really?

261
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,761
- Please?
- Of course.

262
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,462
Honey, I'm always
there for you.

263
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,098
Thank you.

264
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,169
( piano music playing )

265
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,272
She's not
going to show.

266
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,177
You know what?
She probably
changed her mind.

267
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,846
What time is it?

268
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,883
( sighs )
4:22.

269
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,087
You know, honey,

270
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,024
maybe it's
just too much for her.

271
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,992
You're
probably right.

272
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,460
I just feel so bad.

273
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,030
I hope
I didn't open up any
old wounds for her,

274
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,398
but I just really
wanted to meet her.

275
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,104
Jenna?

276
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,275
( gasps ) Oh.

277
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,079
What a beauty.

278
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,181
Mm.

279
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:04,117
I had a flat,
and it took Porsche
roadside assistance

280
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,518
an hour
to get to me.

281
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,220
I called them,
and I said,
"I'm sorry,

282
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,922
but you're
just gonna have
to hurry up,

283
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,290
because I am
only going to meet

284
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,192
the most important
person ever."

285
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,428
Hi. Could I
get a skinny
ice-blended mocha,

286
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,164
half a sweetener,
no whip?

287
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,032
Thank you.

288
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,970
Oh. Oh, my gosh.

289
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,305
It is just like
looking in a mirror.

290
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:29,276
( laughs ) I mean,
20-something years
ago, but shh.

291
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,344
I tell people
that I'm 30.

292
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,314
Mm.

293
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,888
Thank you.

294
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,389
And then I went
out on my own,

295
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,524
and I started
Soirees by Haley,

296
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,460
and I just--
I love, love, love it.

297
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,196
Did I tell you
I did the rapper

298
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,064
Jezz X's daughter's
sweet 16?

299
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:52,565
You did?

300
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:56,603
Oh. 800 people
for a 16-year-old's
birthday party.

301
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,305
We had to rent out
an entire stadium.

302
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,040
She couldn't decide
if she wanted

303
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,009
zombies or vampires,
so we did both.

304
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,977
I mean,
it was outrageous.

305
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,213
And then
we were profiled

306
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,215
in "Lifestyle"
magazine,

307
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,250
and my phone
did not stop ringing
for a month.

308
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,585
Business is booming.

309
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:15,288
Huh. I'm surprised
that it was so difficult
to find you

310
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,257
with your business
so successful.

311
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,561
Mm, that's because
Haley Anderson
doesn't exist.

312
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,897
It doesn't roll off
your tongue the way
Haley Snow does.

313
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:25,265
You know
what I mean?

314
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,468
Haley Snow,
she throws
fabulous parties.

315
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,471
Haley Anderson,
yeah, she does
your taxes.

316
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,006
( laughs )

317
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,075
Your work
sounds fascinating.

318
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,476
Oh, it is.

319
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,212
I believe
that when you truly
love what you do,

320
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,014
you know, it doesn't
feel like work.

321
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,349
I feel the same way.

322
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,485
Oh, what you do,
oh, teaching.

323
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,255
And, you,
running a nonprofit.

324
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,623
I mean,
that means
something.

325
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,626
I think
it's so admirable

326
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,629
when people
choose a path that's
completely selfless.

327
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,699
Yeah. Chris and I
love what we do.

328
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,002
Ooh,
and who's Chris?

329
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,037
My fiancé.

330
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,538
Mm!

331
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,975
Oh,
you're affianced.

332
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,543
Oh, weddings
are my absolute
favorite thing

333
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,280
in the whole,
entire world to plan.

334
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,049
And just so you know,
I have connections
all over town,

335
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,285
and my connections
are now your
connections,

336
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,153
so anything you need,
just give me a ring.

337
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,554
I am at your disposal.

338
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,957
That is really sweet
of you, but--

339
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,692
We're on a bit
of a budget.

340
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,494
Oh, don't you
worry about that.

341
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:31,965
Oh, no,
I can call in
all kinds of favors.

342
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:35,135
- ( laughs )
- ( cell phone ringing )

343
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,970
Oh, I don't mean
to be rude,

344
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,638
but this is work.
I need to take it.

345
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,607
Oh. With what
you do, please.

346
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,242
- When duty calls...
- Thanks.

347
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,112
This is Debra.

348
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,280
You will be
a stunning bride.

349
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,615
- Thank you.
- Okay, so...

350
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,018
Yes. Thank you.

351
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:54,021
Thank you.

352
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,089
Is that all you can do?

353
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,426
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

354
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,262
I didn't mean
to sound ungrateful.

355
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,197
Thank you very much.
That--

356
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:07,034
every bit helps.

357
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,435
Thank you.

358
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,738
Okay.

359
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,506
Sorry about that.

360
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,009
Now, what did I miss?

361
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:18,078
Well, Mom,

362
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,180
Haley is going
to plan my wedding.

363
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,515
For free!
As her gift.

364
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,152
( screams )

365
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,620
Oh.

366
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,123
This is going
to be the wedding

367
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,592
I've always dreamt of
and never thought
I could afford.

368
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,194
We don't have
a lot of time,

369
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,662
and I just
don't want things
to get out of hand.

370
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,264
I know.
Neither do I.

371
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:38,765
And I promise you
that just because Haley's

372
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,367
my wedding planner
doesn't mean

373
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,535
I don't want you there
every step of the way.

374
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,038
This is something
I want us to do together.

375
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,573
Good. Me too.

376
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,242
Every fitting,
every tasting,
every tour,

377
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,578
I want you there with me
making the decisions.

378
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,081
Haley is merely
our tour guide.

379
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,485
I want you
to have the wedding
of your dreams

380
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,488
and we
will appreciate
her generosity,

381
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,157
but we'll all
plan the wedding
together.

382
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,726
- Okay.
- I'll call you later.

383
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,195
- Okay. Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

384
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,666
( sighs )

385
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,207
This, this has
been so helpful.

386
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,275
It's just adorable,
Debra,

387
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,145
just a lot
of really cute I--

388
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,713
( sighs ) So cute.

389
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:30,617
Okay, this is
a book of weddings

390
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,420
that I have planned.

391
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:36,289
Some of them
will seem grandiose.

392
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,091
Don't be intimidated,
and just remember

393
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,426
that the sky's
the limit.

394
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,128
I have ways
that we can get around

395
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,163
those pesky
budget limitations.

396
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,597
Oh. Mm-hmm.

397
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,300
Billionaire oil mogul's
ninth wedding,

398
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,402
four of them planned
by yours truly.

399
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:52,305
Do you have
a loyalty program,
fifth one's free?

400
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:54,073
( laughing )

401
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,479
Loyalty. I should
think about that.

402
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,881
I think he
has more wives
in his future.

403
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,384
That one
gets bored easily.
( chuckles )

404
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,319
Wow. Where is this?

405
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,221
Oh, that's
the Wilton Club.

406
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,756
Oh. I hear you
can't get in there

407
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,225
without a bank statement
and an Academy Award.

408
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:15,228
They can be
rather exclusive
to nonmembers,

409
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,164
but they
happen to be one
of my favorite vendors.

410
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,565
Did you want to see it?

411
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,534
Well, we've
already decided
on Hollister Ranch.

412
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,670
Oh. Ooh, a ranch.

413
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,572
Hmm.

414
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,841
I didn't know
that you had selected
a location.

415
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,610
Well, we haven't
put a deposit down
yet, but--

416
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,479
Oh, so you can look
at other places,

417
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,647
I mean, just to make
sure that you're making
the right decision.

418
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,616
That's a pretty good point.

419
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,518
You know, even if
we could get in

420
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,620
at this late date,
Haley,

421
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,656
I am sure that
that is out of
our price range.

422
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,494
Remember all of those favors
I told you people owe me?

423
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:50,430
Well, the Wilton Club
owes me more than anyone.

424
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,432
You just let me
make a quick call.

425
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,540
Kelly, hi.
How's the new husband?

426
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,642
Oh, that is so cute.

427
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:03,810
He sounds so obedient.

428
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,678
Listen, I am here
with a new client,

429
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:09,949
a very, very special
friend of mine.

430
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,751
Uh-huh. Yes.

431
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,554
Hey, Mom,
are you sure
you're okay

432
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,955
with looking
at other places?

433
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,191
Oh, yeah. Honey,
it's your decision.

434
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:21,194
I know, but, I mean,
after what I said
about Hollister Ranch,

435
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,795
I just don't want
to hurt your feelings.

436
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,798
Listen, if you
want to go look
at other places,

437
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,735
let's go see
a bunch of other
locations.

438
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,937
I mean, we both have
the same thing
in mind,

439
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,705
for you to have
an amazing wedding.

440
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,607
So you're okay with it?

441
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,676
Yeah. Besides,
I've always wanted

442
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,545
to see the inside
of the Wilton Club.

443
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,514
- Mm-hmm.
- I hear they have
crystal toilets.

444
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,483
- ( laughs )
- Okay,

445
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:47,254
we are on tomorrow
at 5:00.

446
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:49,722
- Great.
- Yeah.

447
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,359
Peg:
The Wilton Club?

448
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,461
Did you win
the lottery and
forget to tell me?

449
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:58,431
( mimicking Haley )
No, but seriously,
darling,

450
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,233
Haley Snow
knows everyone,

451
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,968
and everyone
just adores her.

452
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,837
All she has to do
is make one phone call,

453
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,607
and The Rolling Stones
will pay us

454
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,310
for a chance to play
at Jenna's wedding.
( imitates laugh )

455
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,711
- Wow.
- Yeah.

456
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,613
She sounds
like she's
something else.

457
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:14,781
Oh, yes, she is.

458
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,549
I'm just
not sure what.

459
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,986
It's really sweet
that she wants to do
this for Jenna.

460
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,988
I just
don't understand it.

461
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,690
Well, guilt,
it's got to be.

462
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,693
Fine. I will
let her wow Jenna

463
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,695
with the Wilton Club,

464
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,263
and then
we will turn around

465
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,665
and book Hollister Ranch
like we planned.

466
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,901
And we will forget
these shenanigans

467
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,836
and get on with
planning the wedding.

468
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,738
Yes, and please
get pictures

469
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,340
of the crystal
toilets for me.

470
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,342
Oh, absolutely.
I planned on it.

471
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,711
So, Debra,
anything to report?

472
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,745
Ben.

473
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,448
Um... no.

474
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:49,949
Nothing concrete,

475
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,285
but please don't
lose faith in me

476
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,288
because I haven't
talked to our
biggest donor yet.

477
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,857
I took the liberty
of setting up
afternoon tea

478
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,692
for you and
Elaine Stansbury

479
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,428
at Stansbury Manor.

480
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,996
- When?
- 30 minutes.
Better get a move on.

481
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,066
30 minutes?
Can we change that?

482
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,768
Is there a problem?

483
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,670
Nope.

484
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,839
I'll cancel
my plans.

485
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:15,475
- Good. Don't be late.
- Okay.

486
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,778
That's that
on the Wilton Club.

487
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,914
Look, Stansbury Manor
and the Wilton Club
are both downtown.

488
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,418
Just sweet-talk
that old bat
into parting

489
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,919
with just a tiny bit
of her fortune.

490
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,588
Then get over
to the Wilton Club

491
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,757
and join
your daughter's tour
already in progress.

492
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,025
I guess I can
try to do that.

493
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,627
Well, get a move on,
girlfriend.

494
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:37,029
I want pictures
of the crystal toilets.

495
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:38,331
Really?

496
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,438
I must tell you, Debra,

497
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:48,441
it was 61 years ago
that Alistair,

498
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,777
may he rest in peace,

499
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,413
put this ring
on my finger

500
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,815
and said,
"Be my bride, Elaine."

501
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:59,819
I said, "Alistair,
I will marry you
over my dead body."

502
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,389
What did he have
to say about that?

503
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:05,091
He cried,
like a little baby,

504
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:08,094
sobbing, tears running
down his face,

505
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,397
soaking his uniform.

506
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,499
I'd never seen
an Army man cry before.

507
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,601
I think
that's quite sweet.

508
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,704
I know he loved you
very much.

509
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:20,440
He was weak.

510
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,842
But I figured any man

511
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,744
who would react
like a child

512
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:27,614
on being
turned down by me

513
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:30,617
would always be
loyal and faithful.

514
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,852
So it was a test.

515
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:35,388
It worked.

516
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:37,957
We were married
all those years

517
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,992
until he passed
last summer

518
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,094
and we never
spent a day apart.

519
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:45,097
I'm so sorry
for your loss,
Elaine.

520
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:47,467
Alistair was
a good man.

521
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,103
And he was
one of our kindest
benefactors

522
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,805
from day one.

523
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,874
He didn't know
how to say no.

524
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,176
However, I do.

525
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,179
I wouldn't be asking

526
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,181
if our situation

527
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,584
wasn't extremely
tenuous right now.

528
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,053
We're not going
to be able to do

529
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,155
any more for you

530
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,491
than we have
already done.

531
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,094
Have I made
myself clear?

532
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:18,097
- Perfectly.
- Good.

533
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,973
Welcome
to the Wilton Club.

534
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,609
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

535
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,558
Membership card, please.

536
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,993
I am supposed
to be meeting

537
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,828
my daughter's
wedding planner.

538
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,463
Yes, of course.
She's taking a tour

539
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:51,931
of Salon Number Two
right now

540
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,766
with Kelly Court,
our Events Manager.

541
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,802
Great. If you could
just show me the w--

542
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:56,869
Stop.

543
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,906
Uh...

544
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,074
I am supposed
to be meeting them here.

545
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,676
They're expecting me.

546
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,245
Members only
and invited guests.

547
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,781
I am an invited guest.

548
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:11,784
If you could just call
your Event Manager.

549
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:14,521
Please, I just--
I'm running late.

550
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:16,756
Just picture
the whole thing.

551
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,891
- I know. I know.
- I mean, I saw you--

552
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:21,260
Mom, you are never
going to believe

553
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,095
- what Haley
just pulled off.
- Try me.

554
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,131
We put down
a deposit here.

555
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,567
Chris and I are
getting married
at the Wilton Club.

556
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,002
- ( screams )
- On the 8th, though.

557
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,671
The 7th
wasn't available,

558
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,272
but at least
we'll share an
anniversary weekend.

559
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,642
I mean, they made us
an offer that,

560
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:37,710
well, I mean, we just
couldn't refuse it,
just couldn't.

561
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:40,747
Ooh.

562
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:50,723
And then
she just wrote a check
without even asking me.

563
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:53,660
"Oh, darling,
we didn't want to lose
the location.

564
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,227
It was like
the heavens opened up

565
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,896
and shined
down upon us

566
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,297
at this last minute."
( stammers )

567
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,932
I got to tell you
something, Carl.

568
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,734
I do not trust
this woman,

569
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:04,103
and to make Haley
even more of a hero,

570
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,705
she got the Cake King

571
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,206
to do Jenna's wedding.

572
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,942
I was going to use
Marinella's Bakery.

573
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:11,611
I love
the Cake King.

574
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,814
Is she going to be
on the TV show?

575
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,983
Come on, Carl.

576
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,653
( mimicking Haley )
Haley is the most magnificent
person to ever grace the planet.

577
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:23,055
Of course we're going
to be on "The Cake King."

578
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,857
Wait. My wife
on the hottest

579
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:26,859
TV show ever
about cake making?

580
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:29,228
We film the first segment
tomorrow.

581
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,730
Wow.

582
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,832
You're like
a real-live
celebrity now.

583
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,300
Hardly, Carl.

584
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,303
I am nothing like
the magnificent
Haley Anderson.

585
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:40,172
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, wait. Haley Snow.

586
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,974
Ah, come on,
honey, relax.

587
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,110
"Relax," Carl?
Really?

588
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:49,315
I have nothing
to wear on television.

589
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,818
Bland, boring, blah.

590
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,019
Nothing.

591
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,287
You always look like
a movie star to me,

592
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,624
like Glenn Close.

593
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,225
Now, that's
a handsome woman.

594
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:02,161
"A handsome woman"
is not a compliment.

595
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,230
You don't say that
to a woman, Carl.

596
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,732
I didn't say it
to a woman.

597
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:07,266
I said it
about Glenn Close,

598
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,036
and I don't see
Glenn Close here
in our bedroom. Do you?

599
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,871
Who did I insult?

600
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,973
A woman wants
to be flattered.

601
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,308
She wants
to be stunning,
not handsome.

602
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:17,910
You are stunning,

603
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,712
but Glenn Close is
stunning and handsome.

604
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:22,649
All right, quit
while you're ahead,
Carl, seriously.

605
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,751
Well, can I come
and watch tomorrow?

606
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,819
Can you get off work
early enough?

607
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:28,855
For the Cake King,
I'll take the whole day off.

608
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:30,256
What do I wear?

609
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,992
You think he's really
that crazy in person?

610
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:35,594
We will soon find out.

611
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,066
( "Rule, Britannia"
playing )

612
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,869
There's
a new king in town.

613
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,004
Bride-and-groom-to-be
number one,

614
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:48,307
step up
and behold the cake.

615
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,844
( chuckles )
I'm sorry, love.

616
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:53,646
It looks as if
you said...

617
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,649
How dare you insult
the King!

618
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,384
There is no cake for you,

619
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:01,788
so waddle on back
to your double-wide trailer,

620
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:04,924
and stick
a Plasticine figurine
of a bride and groom

621
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,694
in a whoopie pie
for all I care!

622
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:12,899
Bride-and-groom-to-be
number two,

623
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:15,802
step up
and behold cake.

624
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:19,171
( giggles )
Look at the joy
on their faces.

625
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:22,041
Let them...

626
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,342
eat cake.

627
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:27,246
I am the Cake King.

628
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,448
- ( show continues )
- That's got to be an act.

629
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,450
I can't believe
you haven't seen it.

630
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,219
No one is that awful.

631
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,087
No, that makes
for good TV.

632
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:38,691
Do you see
why I need you?

633
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:41,027
I'm sure Haley has
a brand-new outfit

634
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,428
from some
French designer

635
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:44,396
that no one can
pronounce her name.

636
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,266
I will not have her

637
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,901
show me up
on national
television.

638
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:51,170
( gasps ) I have been
waiting for years

639
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,772
to give you a makeover.

640
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,407
( loud thud )

641
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:57,209
You are a mound of clay,

642
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:58,745
and I am Rodin.

643
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:00,346
( music playing )

644
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,022
Voilà. It seems
that two can play

645
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:12,925
at the being
fabulous game.

646
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,299
( frogs croaking )

647
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,437
( croaking continues )

648
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,445
( bridge creaking )

649
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,098
( door creaks )

650
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:54,733
( overlapping chatter )

651
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:06,012
Ah, Debra. Oh, well,
don't you look nice.

652
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,815
Well, thank you, Haley.

653
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,016
But no red.

654
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,851
It makes
the camera jump.

655
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,419
Did I not
mention that?

656
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,021
You sure didn't, no.

657
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:18,124
Well, we can put you
in this apron.

658
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,358
How fun is that?

659
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,360
( chuckles )
You know what?
No worries.

660
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,495
I have a beige blouse

661
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,097
underneath
this red jacket.

662
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:27,166
Beige doesn't make
the camera jump, does it?

663
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,567
No, it does not.

664
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,937
How smart
of you to come
with options.

665
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,439
I'll just take this,
and I'll hang it up.

666
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:36,542
I'll go check on Jenna.
She's in makeup.

667
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,378
( sighs )

668
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,848
Are you M.O.B.?

669
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:43,249
M-Mob?

670
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,985
- Mother of bride.
- Oh.

671
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,854
Yes, I am.

672
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:50,189
Well, great.
We're all present
and accounted for.

673
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,824
My name is Freesia.

674
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:54,260
I am the writer, producer,
associate producer,

675
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,396
line producer, director,
first A.D., second A.D.,
second-second floor manager.

676
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,898
I'm also Sebastian's
publicist.

677
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,566
I do a little
hair and makeup
on the side,

678
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,368
plus a little life coaching,
but that's a whole other story.

679
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,904
Listen, I need
to make you aware

680
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:07,239
of the ground rules
because Sebastian
runs a very tight ship,

681
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:09,241
and he wants everybody to be
privy to the house rules.

682
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,943
Do not address him

683
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,845
unless he
addresses you first.

684
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:14,346
Do not get in his
line of sight.

685
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,148
No eye contact.
No pictures.

686
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:17,850
No videos.
No tweeting.
No twerking.

687
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,251
No coughing.
No choking.

688
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,187
No sneezing.
No throat clearing.

689
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,322
And above all,
cell phones off.

690
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:24,924
And I do not mean
on vibrate!

691
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,293
All the way off.
Clear?

692
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:29,428
Clear.

693
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:34,133
Sebastian to set.

694
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,102
Thank you.

695
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,407
Your cell phone off?

696
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,075
I'm thinking
of throwing it out,

697
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45,945
lest I upset the King.
Thank you.

698
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:47,846
You look stunning.

699
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,450
Not handsome,
stunning.

700
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,521
I'm here,

701
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,489
so let's
get rolling.

702
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:02,261
- I looked at him.
- Me too.

703
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,532
( "Rule, Britannia"
playing )

704
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:13,405
Oh. Has anybody noticed
that I'm absolutely melting?
Where's Horst?

705
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:16,308
Isn't he the one that's
supposed to dab or daub
or do whatever he--

706
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,510
oh, just mind the eyes,
Horst.

707
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:21,447
Thanks ever so
for your complete
and utter incompetence.

708
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,082
I'm delighted
to be paying for it.

709
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,251
Quiet on the set!

710
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,686
I hate when
she does that.

711
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,521
Sebastian,
whenever you're ready.

712
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,323
Ready.

713
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:34,093
In three, two...

714
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:36,963
And welcome back
to Cake Castle.

715
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:40,332
I'm delighted to be
sharing with you
my new client,

716
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,634
the lovely bride
Jenna Wolf,

717
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:45,304
the bride-to-be,
and isn't she
a lovely confection?

718
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,939
Almost as pretty
as one of my cakes.

719
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:48,607
Now, Jenna, you're
a schoolteacher.

720
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,376
- Isn't that right?
- Mm-hmm.

721
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,211
She's
a schoolteacher and
an environmentalist

722
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,679
and an all-round
good soul.

723
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:55,447
And also today,
of course,

724
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,416
we have the mother
of the bride with us.

725
00:31:57,449 --> 00:32:00,219
Now, what's fascinating about
this mother-bride combination

726
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,188
is the fact that
the mother of the bride,

727
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,991
Haley, gave
her daughter up
for adoption

728
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:08,194
many years ago
and hasn't seen
her since.

729
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:09,728
And in the interim,
Ms. Haley Snow

730
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,230
has become one
of the premier

731
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,631
wedding planners
of this town

732
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,433
and, dare I say,
any other.

733
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,068
And she has
generously offered

734
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:18,604
to devote
her time, energy,
effort, and love

735
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,206
in creating
a wedding

736
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:22,474
for the daughter
that she never knew.

737
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:25,377
And now what we'd
like to do here
at Cake Castle

738
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:28,380
is to help
beautiful young Jenna
create a cake of her--

739
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,549
and you are here
as well, aren't you?

740
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:33,552
This is-- this is
the adoptive mother
Donna,

741
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,254
who has also
graciously donate--

742
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,090
- Debra.
- I'm sorry. Come again.

743
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,993
Sorry.
Her name is Debra.

744
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:43,095
Debra.
Adoptive Debra.

745
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:46,065
Yes, two mothers
brought together
by chance,

746
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,767
separated by decades,
and now reunited

747
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,703
to create a wedding
for the daughter
that they both adore.

748
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:54,306
And they have
chosen Sebastian

749
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,342
to create
a Cake King masterpiece

750
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,644
worthy of this
auspicious occasion,

751
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,746
and I for one
thank you, Jenna,

752
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,282
thank you, Haley,
thank you.

753
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,317
And let me let you in
on a little secret.

754
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,153
When it comes
to wedding cakes,

755
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:10,022
it's not about the filling,
it's about the feeling.

756
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:14,360
And this cake
is going to be
filled with love.

757
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:16,762
And before I start
crying in my icing,

758
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:18,597
what do you say, gals?

759
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,199
Let's make cake.

760
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:23,035
- Cut!
- I hate when she does that.

761
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,107
Jenna.

762
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,541
Jenna, wait.

763
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:34,280
I had no idea
that they were going
to do that. I--

764
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:35,614
I am so sorry.

765
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,649
I mean, I should
have expected it,
I guess.

766
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,318
It's television
and they look

767
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,719
for the unique
story angle

768
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,289
and unfortunately
this was it.

769
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:45,057
I hate that my mom
got pushed aside.

770
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:46,458
Haley,
this can't happen.

771
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,060
She's a big part
of this too.

772
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:50,496
100% agreed.

773
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,499
Listen, I will have
a talk with Sebastian.

774
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,701
He owes me.
I practically
got him this job

775
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:58,770
when I brought
the producer to him
for her wedding.

776
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:01,773
The next segment,
this won't happen
again.

777
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,509
I promise you.
I promise you that.

778
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:07,379
Mom, I am
so sorry.

779
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:08,814
Haley and I
had no idea

780
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,150
that they were
going to do the
birth-mother angle.

781
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:13,252
We thought we were
here to choose
cake decorations.

782
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,254
That's show biz.

783
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:17,556
Well, I will speak
with the Cake King,

784
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:21,460
and the next segment
will be very different,
I assure you.

785
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,662
Well, I think we
should go and grab
a coffee, ladies.

786
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,364
We had so much work
to do for this wedding

787
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,333
and the clock is
just tick, tick, ticking.

788
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:30,802
So let's get going.

789
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:32,771
( mouths words )

790
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,541
And I have another client
at 5:00, so please hurry.

791
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,346
See, here, this is
what we're thinking,

792
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,648
shades of pink.
It's simple.

793
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:45,884
It's elegant, chic,
and very feminine.

794
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,820
I mean, that's
a beautiful combination.

795
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:52,658
Beautiful,
but the colors
of the moment

796
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:55,627
are crocus and ecru.

797
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,129
What and what, now?

798
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:59,565
Crocus is like
a pale purple

799
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,501
with just
the slightest hint of red.

800
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:06,505
And ecru is a grayish,
yellowish...

801
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,340
brown.

802
00:35:08,374 --> 00:35:11,277
In layman's terms,
purple and tan.

803
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,479
Mm, it's more like

804
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:17,416
lavender-red
and deep eggshell.

805
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,618
Also known in America
as purple and tan.

806
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,321
Tomato, tomahto.

807
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,556
Beyoncé's favorite
color is crocus.

808
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,892
I did her after party
when she was touring
here in town

809
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,261
and she had
everything in crocus

810
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:31,497
and it was--
it was beautiful.

811
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,500
But we're not doing
Beyoncé's after party.

812
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,268
We're doing
Jenna's wedding,

813
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:38,704
and long before
you got involved,

814
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,707
she told me
that she wanted
shades of pink.

815
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,642
- Well, I think--
- I mean, that's fine

816
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,577
if you want to be
cliché about it.

817
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:47,579
Are you insulting
Jenna's taste?

818
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,348
No, absolutely not.

819
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:52,884
I'm just merely thinking
outside of the box.

820
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:54,920
I mean,
if we do this right,

821
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:58,824
Jenna's wedding
could end up on the pages
of bridal magazines.

822
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:03,595
Let's say we don't
make this a giant
advertisement

823
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,697
for Soirees by Haley.

824
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,366
It's not about me, Debra.

825
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,767
It's the vendors.

826
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,702
They volunteer
their services

827
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:13,439
and then they hope
for a little return
on their investment.

828
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:14,740
I just think
it's important

829
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:17,243
that we pay attention
to what Jenna wants.

830
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:18,544
So do I.

831
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:19,811
I think you should too.

832
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,918
What do you want, Jenna?
It's your decision, honey.

833
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:30,389
Do you want
shades of pink...

834
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:34,426
or crocus and ecru?

835
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,627
I don't know.

836
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,696
I would love some time
to think about it.

837
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,998
Could we put a pin
in the colors

838
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,600
and discuss photography?

839
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,935
- Sure.
- Sure.

840
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:46,905
Okay.

841
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,341
I'm really sorry, Peg.

842
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,510
I know how valuable
you've been to this
organization,

843
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,979
but we're scaling back
to bare bones here.

844
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:58,450
Well, Debra
can't do this alone,

845
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:02,521
so I'll just stay on
as a volunteer until
I get another job.

846
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,956
And I'll do my best
to get the word out

847
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,859
because we just can't
let this place go under.

848
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,461
I don't want that
either, ladies,

849
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:11,830
but we have to face
the cold, hard facts

850
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:13,599
and they are
not in our favor.

851
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:18,437
It's going to be fine.
We'll make due.

852
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,439
No, it's not just that.

853
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:23,442
I feel like
I'm losing my touch.

854
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:26,011
I used to be accomplished
at everything

855
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:29,014
and now I just feel
like I've lost my grip
on it all.

856
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:31,617
Okay, I'm not
saying you need to do
exactly what I do,

857
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,018
even though
it's a good idea.

858
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,386
I know it's tough
right now,

859
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,787
but let's focus
on the good, okay?

860
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,022
Our baby's
getting married.

861
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,724
It's a joyous time.

862
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,992
This is
the china I have.

863
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:42,694
What do you think
about that for you?

864
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:44,296
I hope that woman
doesn't take

865
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,465
all the joy
out of it for me.

866
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,401
Deb, you have
something that Haley
does not have.

867
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:50,669
What's that?

868
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,604
You actually
know Jenna.

869
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:55,507
- Jenna: But...
- Chris: May be a little...

870
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:58,076
Haley: I know it's
a little spendy,

871
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,879
but it's something
I think that will
last you for years

872
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,614
and you just have
to have good china.

873
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,015
No, she doesn't.

874
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:06,418
She is
a ridiculous klutz.

875
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:09,521
You don't want her
within five feet
of good china.

876
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,723
Do you remember that time
we were in Hawaii

877
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:15,527
and you took out
that entire display
of cuckoo clocks?

878
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:16,728
They were made
out of coconuts.

879
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:19,431
Yeah, and Dad would
not stop staying...

880
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:22,734
- I'm cuckoo for coconuts!
- No, Carl do not start.

881
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:25,571
- It never gets old,
I swear.
- Yeah.

882
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:28,607
We've had some really good
times together.

883
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,476
- Mm.
- And many more to come.

884
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:31,743
Amen to that.

885
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:35,481
Okay, so also,
let's not forget

886
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,816
serving sets
and a gravy boat.

887
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,918
You do not need
a gravy boat.

888
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,753
She doesn't need
a gravy boat.

889
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:43,522
We spend
Thanksgiving here

890
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:47,359
and we spend all
of the holidays
together as a family

891
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:48,694
and I don't
expect that to change

892
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,362
after they're married.

893
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:53,865
I just think
it's nice to give
people options.

894
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,467
There's plenty
of options.

895
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,969
There's towels,
sheets, dishes.

896
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,005
There's a lot
of stuff on there.

897
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:04,610
So what say we put
the gift registry
on hold for a minute

898
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,379
and order us
some Chinese food?
Dim sum, anyone?

899
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:09,581
- Good.
- Thank you, Carl.

900
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:18,156
- I hope Peg's
job interview went well.
- Debra: Me too.

901
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,058
I just feel
like it's my fault.

902
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,394
Mom, don't be
so hard on yourself.

903
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:23,929
You're trying to keep
the charity afloat

904
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,097
all while taking care
of our family

905
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:28,033
and planning my wedding.

906
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,001
I think you can
give yourself a break.

907
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,671
Actually,
I've been meaning

908
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,072
to talk to you
about your wedding.

909
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,175
Yeah? I want to talk
to you about it too.

910
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,478
You first.

911
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:43,615
Okay, well,
we know that Haley
is over the top.

912
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:44,816
( both laugh )

913
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,785
And pretentious

914
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:51,557
and her favorite topic
of conversation is Haley,

915
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,560
but I just wanted you to know
that even though the wedding

916
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,995
is not exactly
what we envisioned,

917
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,730
I'm not letting her
take over.

918
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:00,799
Oh, good.

919
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:02,601
I understand that
she's a professional,

920
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,002
but this is about you

921
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,971
and not what Haley
wants for you

922
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:07,773
or Haley wants
for Haley.

923
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,841
Of course.

924
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,811
But, I mean,
she has given me

925
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:16,815
more than I would ever,
ever have dared
to dream about

926
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:19,084
or even thought
was possible.

927
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:22,120
So can we kind of
cut her some slack?

928
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,023
Of course.

929
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,192
Yeah? What did you
want to talk to me about?

930
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,461
Exactly
the same thing.

931
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:31,129
- Yeah?
- Would you do me a favor

932
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,164
and go grab that tray
off that table back there?

933
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:35,166
- ( cell phone ringing )
- Yeah.

934
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,068
Hello.

935
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,938
Hello.
Debra, it's Haley.

936
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,139
I just wanted
to let you know

937
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,041
that I heard
from Bridal Bliss.

938
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:45,844
The dress is in,
and we are all set
for tomorrow at noon

939
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:47,245
for Jenna's
first fitting.

940
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,048
Haley, I--

941
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:52,951
I can't make noon.
I serve at that time.

942
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,921
I told you
I wasn't available.
Can we push it an hour?

943
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,758
Well, Helga,
the seamstress,
is booked solid

944
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,760
and doesn't
have an opening
until next Monday,

945
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,930
and I'm sorry,
but we just can't lose
this precious time.

946
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:09,034
I specifically
gave you my schedule.

947
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:11,236
And I tried
to accommodate it, Debra,

948
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,104
but that's the thing
with these high-end vendors.

949
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,173
Sometimes we have
to work around their
busy schedules.

950
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,943
- We don't always
get to call the shots.
- I see.

951
00:41:19,545 --> 00:41:24,616
Okay, what if I try
and drag it out?

952
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,086
We'll show up late.
I'll ask questions.

953
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:31,089
We'll shoe shop, okay,

954
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,291
and then you just
show up as quickly
as you can.

955
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,960
Does that sound good?

956
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,228
I will get there
as close to noon
as I can.

957
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:39,130
Thank you so much.

958
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,301
( bell tolls )

959
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,937
( military march playing )

960
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:55,981
Are you ready for
the wedding dress now?

961
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,984
Not yet. I still need
to find the perfect shoes.

962
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,586
Can I try on a few more?

963
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:07,726
( military march playing )

964
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:13,765
Okay, it's
quarter to 1:00.

965
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:15,266
They're starting
to hate us.

966
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,303
I know. I know.
She'll be here,
I promise.

967
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,313
Can I see these
in a seven, please?

968
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:29,547
( Debra panting )

969
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,586
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got here as quickly
as I could.

970
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,954
Hi.

971
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,624
Never mind.
We are ready
for the dress.

972
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:40,158
How lucky for me.

973
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,260
I should buy
a lottery ticket.

974
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,762
Helga,
I do apologize.

975
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,063
Sometimes there
are things that

976
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:46,665
are just out
of my control.

977
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:52,170
( military march playing )

978
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,674
Sorry.

979
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:01,847
So glad
you could join us.

980
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,915
We wouldn't have
this problem

981
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,350
if you would have
made the appointment

982
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,753
during the time
I was available.

983
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:09,220
Do you think
I scheduled the fitting

984
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,922
for a time when
you couldn't be there?

985
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,323
I thought it was
very coincidental

986
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:14,359
that the only time
Helga's available

987
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:17,262
is the small window
that I'm not.

988
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:20,265
I cannot believe
what you are
suggesting.

989
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,669
I couldn't believe it
either, Haley,

990
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:26,672
except then there was
the location change.

991
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:29,340
Then there was
the extravagant ideas

992
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:31,142
and then the Cake King.

993
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:33,645
That's what really
brought it home for me.

994
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,346
That's TV, Debra.

995
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,749
We signed
the contract.
You roll the dice.

996
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:39,150
Nobody ran
the story angle by me.

997
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:40,886
You didn't correct him.

998
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:44,355
I actually think you were
savoring the moment.

999
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,758
This is
beyond insulting.

1000
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,393
I have never--

1001
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:50,061
Nor have I.

1002
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:51,930
( clears throat )

1003
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:52,964
Ladies.

1004
00:43:58,003 --> 00:43:59,738
Haley: Ohh.

1005
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:15,053
You look beautiful,
my love.

1006
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:16,788
Gorgeous.

1007
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:21,126
You put every bride that
I have ever worked
with to shame.

1008
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,428
There is nothing like
seeing your daughter

1009
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:25,463
in a wedding dress
for the first time,
is there?

1010
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,232
- No, there isn't.
- No, abso--

1011
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,401
- Maybe a little tighter.
- Yeah.

1012
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:32,170
Come with me for a moment.
( snaps fingers )

1013
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:38,243
I want you to listen
to me, Haley.

1014
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:40,045
You had your chance

1015
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:42,113
with Jenna
and you passed.

1016
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:43,849
She is my daughter

1017
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:46,351
and you are
not going to steal

1018
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:48,754
this pivotal moment
from me

1019
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:52,157
because you have
some unresolved issues
from your past.

1020
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,392
This isn't about
the past, Debra.

1021
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,395
I made my peace
with my decision
years ago.

1022
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,898
I want to be there for Jenna
because every girl

1023
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:01,432
deserves the wedding
of her dreams,

1024
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:03,301
not some
recycled replica

1025
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,136
of her parents' special day
so that her mother

1026
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,073
- can enjoy her glory days.
- ( scoffs )

1027
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:09,941
What do you think
of this?

1028
00:45:09,975 --> 00:45:11,242
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

1029
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:16,381
Do you think that I am
living vicariously
through my daughter?

1030
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:18,383
Oh, I have seen this
a million times.

1031
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:20,285
She hasn't been
very excited about anything

1032
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:21,519
that you've brought
to the table.

1033
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,288
I am taking
my cues from her.

1034
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:25,991
You need to put
your feelings aside
and think about Jenna.

1035
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:28,259
I never stopped
thinking of Jenna.

1036
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:29,394
Well,
if that's true,

1037
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:30,962
then why
don't you go ahead

1038
00:45:30,996 --> 00:45:32,363
and leave the planning
to the professionals?

1039
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,966
And you can take on
a role that's

1040
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,734
more of
a silent partner.

1041
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:40,338
So...

1042
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,339
( sighs )

1043
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:43,174
This is the one.

1044
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,076
Without a doubt.

1045
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,449
And, if you
can believe it,

1046
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,919
this is choice number one.

1047
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:56,554
Who are you,
Elizabeth Taylor?

1048
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,890
- This, oh...
- ( laughing )

1049
00:45:58,924 --> 00:46:00,391
...choice number two.

1050
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,828
Why don't you just
wear a bedspread?

1051
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:04,996
Last, but not least...

1052
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:08,566
Are you supposed to be
visible from outer space
for this wedding?

1053
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,236
It's really nice
of Haley to do
you this favor

1054
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,939
- of pulling dresses
for you, but please.
- Favor?

1055
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:17,008
This is not a favor.
This is awful.

1056
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,410
- Yeah, now she's telling you
what to wear.
- No more.

1057
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:23,915
- She is not making any more
decisions about anything.
- Attagirl.

1058
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:27,218
And now I'm on my way
to see her and Jenna
and let her know that.

1059
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:29,254
Hey, could I have
the bedspread?

1060
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:32,257
'Cause I could eat
all day in that.

1061
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:36,027
Oh, fabulous.
Debra's here.

1062
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:37,528
I'm here.
We need to talk.

1063
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:40,265
Yes, we have
a lot to talk about,

1064
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,268
so let's start
with party favors.

1065
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,236
Sit down, Debra,
please.

1066
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,538
Debra, please,
have a seat.

1067
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:55,513
Okay, so,
inside the box,

1068
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,915
we will have...

1069
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,052
decadent treats

1070
00:47:01,086 --> 00:47:04,255
from La Patisserie,

1071
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:07,225
a book of love poems...

1072
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:11,462
and a scented candle.

1073
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:12,563
( sniffs )

1074
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,233
All with
your name on it.

1075
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:17,936
And we're going to make
150 of these?

1076
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:19,637
No, no, no, no.
No, my staff will
take care of it.

1077
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,040
You won't have
to worry about a thing.

1078
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:24,976
It sounds
really expensive.

1079
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,012
None of this
matters, Jenna,

1080
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:28,646
because we're
not doing it.

1081
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,450
Well, it seems that this
is what Jenna wants.

1082
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:35,020
Jenna really
cares about
the environment

1083
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:37,923
and I think it's important
that we take that into
consideration.

1084
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:40,258
This, these favors

1085
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:43,929
are excessive
and wasteful,

1086
00:47:43,962 --> 00:47:46,497
and half of 'em
get left behind.

1087
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,334
We're going to choose
something practical,

1088
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,369
simple elegance.

1089
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:53,371
Unless of course
you would like

1090
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:56,274
to pay for this
colossal bunch

1091
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:59,077
of non-recyclable
waste, Haley.

1092
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,479
I would be happy,

1093
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:03,681
happy to pay for this

1094
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,116
if this is
what Jenna wants.

1095
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,684
Okay, enough.

1096
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,354
You don't think
I know what's going on?
This has to stop.

1097
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:12,223
This competition
between you two,
I see it.

1098
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:15,660
Haley,
I appreciate everything
you're doing for us,

1099
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:18,329
but I emphasize the word "us"
because it's not about me.

1100
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:20,365
It's about me
and my family,

1101
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,500
so please respect
their opinions, okay?

1102
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:25,370
And, Mom, I know
you have your plans

1103
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,472
and your ideas
and I love you for it,

1104
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:30,475
but, Mom, sometimes
plans need to change,

1105
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,410
so I need you
to be flexible.

1106
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,245
So I'm gonna go now.

1107
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:36,281
And we'll talk about this
when you two learn
how to play nice.

1108
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:37,515
And I suggest
you make it quick

1109
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:40,118
'cause my wedding
is quickly approaching.

1110
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:47,725
It's awful, Chris.
They hate each other.

1111
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,660
"Hate" is
a pretty strong word.

1112
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:53,131
Okay, so maybe not hate,
but they strongly
dislike each other.

1113
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,169
I kind of understand
where your mom is
coming from, Jenna.

1114
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:00,605
She's been waiting
for this day,

1115
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,108
and then, all of a sudden,
Haley swoops in

1116
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:05,276
and gets to play
an integral role

1117
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,012
in the fun part
of your life.

1118
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:09,447
I know.

1119
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,450
The benefits
are decentish.

1120
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:15,220
Like if I'm dying,
I can go to the doctor,

1121
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:17,722
and the insurance company
might pay for it
after I'm dead.

1122
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:19,557
Sounds like
a dream job.

1123
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,527
- Job, yes.
Dream, not so much.
- Oh, Peg.

1124
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,730
I am so sorry.

1125
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:28,199
When are you going
to realize this is
not your fault?

1126
00:49:28,233 --> 00:49:31,702
When you are hired
to keep the doors
of an establishment open

1127
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:33,304
and they're
quickly slamming shut,

1128
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:34,705
who else's fault
could it be?

1129
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,441
So no one's stepping up?

1130
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,143
'Cause you are
kind of a pit bull

1131
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:39,544
when it comes
to getting donations.

1132
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:42,080
I think
I've lost my bite.

1133
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:44,615
Well, there's got to be
something we could do, Deb.

1134
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,252
I mean, this isn't
like you to give up.

1135
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,054
Writing's on the wall.

1136
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:50,455
It's been there a while,

1137
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,157
but I just refuse
to look at it.

1138
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:54,159
It's just so sad.

1139
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:56,561
All the good we've done,

1140
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:58,196
all those people.

1141
00:49:58,229 --> 00:50:00,431
I'm informing
the landlord

1142
00:50:00,465 --> 00:50:02,033
at the end
of next month

1143
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:04,169
that our space
will be available.

1144
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,639
Hey, there is
one bright spot
to all this.

1145
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:11,576
Now you have more time
to plan the wedding.

1146
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:14,412
No way can that Haley
push you out now.

1147
00:50:14,445 --> 00:50:17,382
( cell phone rings )

1148
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:20,818
Hello, hello, hello.
Thank God somebody's answering

1149
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,453
their bloody cell phones.

1150
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,489
- Sebastian?
- The Cake...

1151
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:26,324
Well, it isn't
Sherlock Holmes,

1152
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:29,060
if that's
what you were thinking.
( chuckles )

1153
00:50:29,094 --> 00:50:32,230
I don't know
what to think.

1154
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:34,199
What can I do
for you?

1155
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:36,267
Well, as it turns out,

1156
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:39,337
I'm in an absolute tsunami
of utter incompetence,

1157
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:43,541
gale-force winds of
stupidity assailing me
from every direction.

1158
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:45,210
How can I
possibly help you?

1159
00:50:45,243 --> 00:50:46,711
Well, as it turns out,

1160
00:50:46,744 --> 00:50:50,315
my assistant--
or should I say
former assistant Horst,

1161
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:52,583
as he was fired
merely moments ago.

1162
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:56,354
Yes, he neglected
to telephone you,

1163
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,189
your daughter,
and Ms. Haley Snow

1164
00:50:58,223 --> 00:50:59,790
to inform you
that there'd been

1165
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:01,859
a teensy-weensy
schedule change.

1166
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,561
Yes, and as
it turns out,

1167
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:06,597
the cake taste taping
is taking place today,

1168
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:09,500
right this
very bloody moment!

1169
00:51:09,534 --> 00:51:11,769
And imagine my creeping
shock and horror

1170
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:13,704
when nobody
showed up for it!

1171
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:16,674
Fortunately, I had
your telephone number
and was able to contact you

1172
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:18,509
and you have nothing
better to do today,

1173
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:20,545
so thank God for that.
( chuckles )

1174
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,248
I had no idea
or I would have
been there.

1175
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:26,317
Do you suppose
you could pop by?

1176
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:29,420
Jenna gets
out of school
in 15 minutes.

1177
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:30,888
We could be there
within the hour.

1178
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,359
We shall be awaiting
your arrival with
bated breath.

1179
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:36,861
And if you could do
one little thing for me.

1180
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:39,864
Would you please inform
Ms. Haley Snow,

1181
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:42,867
as I have cakes to bake

1182
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,570
and I don't have time
for this nonsense.

1183
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,705
You go work your magic,
Sebastian,

1184
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:49,507
and I will get
in touch with Haley.

1185
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,377
Yes. Ta.
Horst.

1186
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:56,247
Oh, you are so not
telling Haley, are you?

1187
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:57,882
Whatever gave you
that idea?

1188
00:51:57,915 --> 00:52:01,286
Oh! I love evil Debra.
( chuckles )

1189
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:02,853
( school bell rings )

1190
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:04,689
Not a lot.

1191
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:06,857
- I got my Dad today.
- That's better than normal.

1192
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:09,760
Mom. Mom,
is everything okay?
What are you doing here?

1193
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:11,796
- Is Dad okay?
- Nothing's wrong.

1194
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:13,898
I've been calling
and calling you.

1195
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:15,633
I know. My phone's
always off during
school hours.

1196
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,268
Well,
you two jump in.

1197
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:20,171
We have an emergency tasting
at the Cake King right now

1198
00:52:20,205 --> 00:52:22,373
and your wedding planner's
nowhere to be found.

1199
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:25,543
Thankfully,
Sebastian was able
to get in touch with me.

1200
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:27,645
Mom, it was
finger-painting
day today.

1201
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:29,347
I'm a mess.
I am not camera-ready.

1202
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,715
No worries.

1203
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:32,650
I've got a change
of clothes in the trunk.

1204
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:34,652
- Come on.
- Duty calls.

1205
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:37,455
We better not
keep the King waiting.

1206
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,290
Thank you.

1207
00:52:40,925 --> 00:52:42,327
What about Haley?

1208
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,262
Well, hopefully
she'll get the message

1209
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:45,663
and she'll
get there in time.

1210
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:47,365
Okay.

1211
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,734
( "Rule, Britannia"
playing )

1212
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,769
Freesia:
Quiet on the set!

1213
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:54,772
Rolling, and action.

1214
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:56,874
What you're
about to experience

1215
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,843
is a divinely
delicious, decadent

1216
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:00,478
dulce de leche.
Horst, please.

1217
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:04,849
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

1218
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:06,284
Not just yet.

1219
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:09,420
You see, fine cake,
like a fine wine,

1220
00:53:09,454 --> 00:53:10,755
is meant
to be savored.

1221
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:13,624
First, one enjoys
the bouquet.

1222
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:16,294
Savor. Savor.
Go on.

1223
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:18,796
Don't be afraid.
It's only cake.

1224
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:22,333
And now,
excite the palate.

1225
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:27,004
Lovely.
Lovely.

1226
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,240
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1227
00:53:29,274 --> 00:53:30,341
Mm-hmm.

1228
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,709
And?

1229
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:35,546
This is definitely
my favorite.

1230
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,715
But I still have to try
the lemon one again.

1231
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,784
It's in between
these two.

1232
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:41,619
I can't decide.

1233
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:44,789
- What do you think, Mom?
- Uh...

1234
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:47,658
- oh, I think
they're both delicious.
- Of course they are.

1235
00:53:49,294 --> 00:53:52,029
I think it's a matter
of personal preference.

1236
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,764
Chris:
Oh, I know how
we can decide.

1237
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:55,366
Which would you
prefer I smash

1238
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,302
into your face
on our wedding day?

1239
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:59,904
None. We are
not doing the cake
in the face thing.

1240
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:01,972
I'm spending
a lot of money
to get my makeup done.

1241
00:54:02,006 --> 00:54:03,674
Yes, well,
it's just as well.

1242
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,276
You see, my cakes
aren't meant

1243
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,911
to be smashed
into somebody's face

1244
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:09,380
like some gauche,
archaic party trick.

1245
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:11,015
They're meant
to be enjoyed.

1246
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:13,784
I don't know.
I'm pretty excited
for the cake cutting.

1247
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:16,020
I think I'm actually
going to take it
a little slow,

1248
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:17,555
you know, just start
with a dab...

1249
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,690
- No, no, no, no!
- Chris!

1250
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:20,991
Bad groom.
( chuckles )

1251
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:22,627
That isn't
for dabbing.

1252
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,029
You see, that's
a Swiss meringue
buttercream.

1253
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:27,298
So sorry. So sorry.
That's my bad.

1254
00:54:27,332 --> 00:54:31,536
This is a Swiss
meringue buttercream.

1255
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,438
- Buttercream, yes.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1256
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,640
Is the lemon less fancy?
Is that one more smashable?

1257
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:37,675
- Smashable?
- I don't know.

1258
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,344
What do you think
of this, Chris?

1259
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:40,711
- Mmm.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1260
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:43,881
Cut. Cut.

1261
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:45,683
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

1262
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:47,017
Getting this
out of our system

1263
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:49,454
'cause we are not doing this
on our wedding day.

1264
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:51,356
This is an insult
to my cakes,

1265
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:53,458
an absolute
travesty.

1266
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:56,060
I think I'll take
the crème brûlée.

1267
00:54:56,093 --> 00:54:57,995
Well, fine.
Take the crème brûlée.

1268
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,964
Take them all
for what I care.

1269
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:03,000
If anybody wants me,
I'll be in my dressing chamber.

1270
00:55:04,569 --> 00:55:05,836
Horst.

1271
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,341
And cut.

1272
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:11,776
All right, everybody.

1273
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,711
Take five!

1274
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,946
A little more here.

1275
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:18,949
Thank you.

1276
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:20,985
( laughing )

1277
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:25,623
Well, you're welcome.

1278
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,759
Hi. I just...

1279
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:31,061
I saw I had
four missed messages

1280
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:32,797
from Sebastian
and I called.

1281
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,632
Nobody answered,
so I just ran right over.

1282
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,534
Haley, Haley,
everything's fine.

1283
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:39,704
Really.
Sebastian managed to
get in touch with me.

1284
00:55:39,737 --> 00:55:41,439
The cake tasting
was today.

1285
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:42,840
I think everything
went really well.

1286
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:44,442
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

1287
00:55:44,475 --> 00:55:47,912
Oh. I can see that.
( chuckles )

1288
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:50,415
So you finished
the whole segment.

1289
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:52,016
Mm-hmm.
We finished the segment

1290
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:55,019
and we managed
just fine without you.

1291
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:57,888
( chuckles )
Yeah.

1292
00:55:57,922 --> 00:55:59,490
I bet.

1293
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:01,526
( "Rule, Britannia"
playing )

1294
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:05,830
We like
to make a big deal
of delivering

1295
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,165
the final masterpiece
to the location.

1296
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,100
And by we,
I mean Sebastian.

1297
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:13,671
And it's the finale,
so it should be a big deal.

1298
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,606
Oh, it will be
a big deal,

1299
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,476
like you two with
your icing facials.

1300
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:20,578
Aren't they cute?

1301
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:22,513
Not.
Come with me.

1302
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:26,484
( cell phone ringing )

1303
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:29,019
Oh, I need
to take this.

1304
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,155
Yes, Ben. I'm here.

1305
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:32,156
Um...

1306
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:34,625
of course.

1307
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:36,861
4:00 tomorrow.

1308
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,896
I will be there.

1309
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:40,030
Bye-bye.

1310
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,202
Okay, we are
all set with Vastille,
the florist,

1311
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,737
tomorrow at 4:00 P.M.

1312
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:48,539
He'll have a mock-up

1313
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:50,941
so we can see
what the centerpieces
are going to look like.

1314
00:56:50,975 --> 00:56:53,611
Oh, really, Haley?
Tomorrow at 4:00?

1315
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:55,713
Oh, no.

1316
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,815
Oh, shoot, does that
not work for you?

1317
00:56:57,848 --> 00:56:59,884
I'm sorry, Debra.
I was under the impression

1318
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,520
that your schedule
was just wide open.

1319
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:05,055
It is. I mean,
well-- it's okay.

1320
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:07,091
Oh, darn it.

1321
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:10,227
We have to sign off
on these designs, though.

1322
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,663
You didn't know.

1323
00:57:12,697 --> 00:57:14,098
I'll change
my thing.

1324
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:17,902
I couldn't
change my thing.

1325
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,837
So you don't
get to see

1326
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,939
the flowers
with a river
running through it.

1327
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:23,541
- Big deal.
- Carl,

1328
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:26,511
this has zero
to do with the flowers

1329
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:28,112
and everything to do
with that woman.

1330
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:29,714
She is sneaky
and manipulative

1331
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:31,148
and, I believe,
downright evil.

1332
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:32,917
I thought you were
making nice.

1333
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,219
I am. I wouldn't
say this to her face

1334
00:57:35,252 --> 00:57:38,055
and I wouldn't let Jenna
hear me say it,

1335
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:40,658
but you are
my sounding board

1336
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:42,159
and she is terrible.

1337
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:45,162
And also, you have to go
in my place tomorrow

1338
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,264
because if she's alone
with Jenna again,

1339
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,966
I might be uninvited
to the wedding.

1340
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:51,201
So clear your schedule.
Got it?

1341
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:52,803
Got it.

1342
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:59,644
( fanfare playing )

1343
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:04,181
Is it standard practice

1344
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:06,216
to have such
an elaborate unveiling

1345
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,885
for the floral
centerpieces?

1346
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:10,588
Vastille doesn't make
ordinary centerpieces.

1347
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:12,790
His arrangements,
they're works of art.

1348
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,892
Be patient, Dad.
This is exciting.

1349
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:19,096
Bonjour, mes amis.

1350
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:21,999
I am Vastille
Floriste Magnifique.

1351
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:24,835
We have converged here
in this idyllic sanctuary

1352
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:27,572
for the unveiling
of my latest creation.

1353
00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:30,541
So without further ado,

1354
00:58:30,575 --> 00:58:33,010
I give you...

1355
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:34,812
bloom kaboom!

1356
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,547
( laughs )

1357
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:39,016
All right,
Remi, Laurent.

1358
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,590
( gasps )

1359
00:58:47,224 --> 00:58:49,794
It's exquisite.

1360
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:52,597
That's one word
for it.

1361
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,899
Don't you think
it's a little difficult

1362
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:57,167
to have a conversation?

1363
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:59,203
( scoffs )

1364
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:02,873
On the contrary,
the conversation
will be about this.

1365
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:06,276
It's a wedding.
People are up.
They're mingling.

1366
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,713
This makes a statement.

1367
00:59:08,746 --> 00:59:11,181
Yeah. It says,
"No talking."

1368
00:59:13,017 --> 00:59:16,253
It's just that
it's a little larger
than I imagined.

1369
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,722
( sniffs )

1370
00:59:17,755 --> 00:59:20,658
Well, if it will
please mademoiselle,

1371
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:22,226
perhaps
it could be pruned.

1372
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:24,829
Slightly.

1373
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:29,199
( blade unsheathes,
chopping )

1374
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:32,837
- Vastille.
- No.

1375
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:36,040
Vastille.

1376
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:38,208
It's not working.

1377
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:41,078
You can make it work, Vastille.
You're the master.

1378
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:42,913
No, I cannot!

1379
00:59:42,947 --> 00:59:45,049
( fly buzzes )

1380
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,017
They are right.

1381
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:49,219
This arrangement
does not speak.

1382
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,855
It is uninspired.

1383
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:52,690
( mournful strings
playing )

1384
00:59:52,723 --> 00:59:54,224
I need more time.

1385
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:57,862
But, no, you
said it has to be
tomorrow at 4:00.

1386
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:03,067
I am an artiste.

1387
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,735
I cannot be rushed.

1388
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:06,270
Would you rush Picasso?

1389
01:00:07,672 --> 01:00:09,707
Would you rush Van Gogh?

1390
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,042
Would you rush
Lady Gaga?

1391
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:13,711
Hmm?

1392
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:15,713
No! You would not!

1393
01:00:15,746 --> 01:00:18,315
Because brilliance
knows no schedule.

1394
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:22,086
Genius cannot be measured
in space and time.

1395
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:25,089
It is done whenever
it is done and I was
not finished!

1396
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,925
- Vastille. Vastille.
- No.

1397
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,661
Vastille, what would
you like us to do?

1398
01:00:30,695 --> 01:00:32,730
- Would you like us to
come back later in the week?
- ( record needle scratches )

1399
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:35,165
Oh, yes.
Thank you, darling.
That would be great.

1400
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,334
Honey, let's go
get some coffee.

1401
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,936
- Yeah.
- We have to talk.

1402
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,170
Okay.

1403
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:49,814
Okay.

1404
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:56,887
You know,
when you were little,

1405
01:00:56,921 --> 01:00:58,889
you used to love
to play bride.

1406
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:00,791
Your mom even
went out and got you

1407
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:02,359
that little wedding
dress-up kit.

1408
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:04,128
Yeah, I remember that.

1409
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,463
I wore that thing
until it ripped.

1410
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,166
She used to love
watching you play
in that dress.

1411
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:11,135
And your wedding day,
don't even get me

1412
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:14,004
- started on how long
she's waited on that.
- Oh, that I know.

1413
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,206
So listen.

1414
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,209
Forgive her if she's
getting a little
crazy now, okay?

1415
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:22,012
You're her baby
and she's--

1416
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:25,082
this is her last chance
to send you off right.

1417
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:32,857
Debra. Hi.

1418
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:35,325
Nice to see you.
You want me to have somebody
go get you a drink?

1419
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,461
No, thank you, Haley.
I'll be brief.

1420
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,029
You win.

1421
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:40,330
I give up.

1422
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:43,433
I'm not sure
that I follow you.

1423
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:46,103
I'm going to let you
have this moment

1424
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:49,106
because it seems
to be what Jenna
wants right now.

1425
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:51,308
And that is
more important
to me than anything.

1426
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:55,279
But I will
not let you

1427
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:58,082
overshadow this
joyous celebration

1428
01:01:58,115 --> 01:02:01,285
with some
crazy competition.

1429
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:05,122
I'm done
fighting you.

1430
01:02:06,857 --> 01:02:08,425
Have it.

1431
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:11,028
From now on,
the wedding is
entirely your domain.

1432
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,898
I'm going to be--

1433
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:16,233
what's that
you said?

1434
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:18,002
A silent partner.

1435
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,910
It has truly
been my honor

1436
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:29,113
to be Jenna's mother.

1437
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:34,819
For that, I am very,
very sorry for you.

1438
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:38,088
So you take
your one moment.

1439
01:02:38,122 --> 01:02:40,457
Have it...

1440
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,393
because I have Jenna
for life.

1441
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,009
And I have
my own coffee mug.

1442
01:02:59,043 --> 01:03:00,577
Oh, and I have
a window.

1443
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,880
It faces the Dumpster,

1444
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:05,382
but you wouldn't
know that if you just
look up at the sky.

1445
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:06,917
Hey, at least
it's a job,

1446
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:09,453
and soon enough,
I will be right there

1447
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:12,356
in a thankless
pencil-pusher job too.

1448
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:14,024
Well, it's not fair.

1449
01:03:14,058 --> 01:03:15,926
We do what
we can do, Peg.

1450
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,828
And we fought
the good fight.

1451
01:03:17,862 --> 01:03:19,864
I am done
swimming upstream.

1452
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:21,131
I'm done
with the charity.

1453
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:22,399
I am done
with the wedding.

1454
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,601
You're just
going to let her win?

1455
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,570
That doesn't sound
like the Debra I know.

1456
01:03:26,603 --> 01:03:29,073
What does the mother
of the bride do
at a wedding?

1457
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:31,408
She dances,
she gives a speech,

1458
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:33,210
and she has
an amazing night.

1459
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:34,979
What does
the wedding planner do?

1460
01:03:35,012 --> 01:03:37,281
She works,
she does her bidding,

1461
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:40,284
and she very little
to do with the actual
celebration.

1462
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,420
That is the metaphor
that I put on this
whole dynamic.

1463
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:45,522
Hey, let me call in sick,
help you with the final meal.

1464
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:48,158
No, you can't
call in sick on your
first month on a job.

1465
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:49,259
- I'm doing it.
- You're not.

1466
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:50,861
- You can't stop me.
- Peg.

1467
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:52,329
I'm going in.

1468
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:53,998
( both laugh )

1469
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:56,366
Now what?

1470
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,203
We wait
for all this to dry

1471
01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:02,139
and then we
put it all in boxes...

1472
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,476
and we put it
in storage.

1473
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:12,249
So that's that?

1474
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:18,155
( groans )

1475
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:20,390
My mom got held up
shutting down
her office,

1476
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:22,192
so she said
that we should start
the music without her.

1477
01:04:22,226 --> 01:04:24,895
Oh. I'm sorry
to hear that.

1478
01:04:24,929 --> 01:04:27,631
That charity seemed
to mean a lot to her.

1479
01:04:27,664 --> 01:04:29,934
It does.

1480
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:32,136
It did.

1481
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:33,537
It's heartbreaking
for her.

1482
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,406
She's always doing stuff
for everyone else,

1483
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,008
putting herself last.

1484
01:04:38,042 --> 01:04:40,077
She's been that way
my whole life.

1485
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:43,180
She's been good to you.

1486
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:46,883
She's been everything
I could ask for in a mom.

1487
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,090
I'm really glad
to hear that.

1488
01:04:54,524 --> 01:04:58,495
All right, so music.

1489
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:01,966
Pachelbel's Canon
in D Major is kind of--

1490
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:04,068
- Haley.
- What?

1491
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:06,203
What's the matter?

1492
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,172
Why are you doing this?

1493
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:10,540
I-- ( laughs )

1494
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:12,342
Isn't it
kind of obvious?

1495
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:13,910
No.

1496
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:16,680
- Well--
- Not really.

1497
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:20,084
Well, we have
a lot of work to do

1498
01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:22,987
for the wedding, Jenna,
and we have so little time.

1499
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:26,090
Can't we maybe save
the heart-to-hearts
for after the honeymoon? Hmm?

1500
01:05:26,123 --> 01:05:28,292
All right,
so for music--

1501
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:30,327
Haley, I'm serious.

1502
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,096
Please stop changing
the subject.

1503
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:35,265
I want to know.

1504
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:36,666
I need to know.

1505
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,535
What?

1506
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:40,670
What, Jenna?
What do you need to know?

1507
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:42,206
Huh?

1508
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:44,408
You want me to tell you
how I was single

1509
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,310
and broke and young?

1510
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:50,214
And that when I told
my boyfriend Eddie
I was pregnant, he bolted?

1511
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:52,983
Is that what
you want to hear?

1512
01:05:53,017 --> 01:05:56,020
You want me to tell you
how the decision
was made for me

1513
01:05:56,053 --> 01:05:57,587
and I had zero say
in the matter?

1514
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:59,389
Or do you want me
to sit here and tell you

1515
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:01,658
that I have been
pining for you

1516
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,994
- all these years?
- No.

1517
01:06:04,028 --> 01:06:06,130
No, Haley,
I understand
all that.

1518
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:08,498
What I need to know
is why now?

1519
01:06:08,532 --> 01:06:10,367
Why are you doing
this for me now?

1520
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,102
It's been
over 20 years,
no contact.

1521
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:14,271
Now all of a sudden,
you can't do enough for me.

1522
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:18,675
- Why?
- Because this is my chance
to make a mark on your life.

1523
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,677
This is it.

1524
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:24,581
This is what I get.

1525
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:31,188
( sighs )

1526
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:44,568
You were born
on a Friday.

1527
01:06:51,275 --> 01:06:53,410
When I handed you
to your mother
on that Sunday,

1528
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:56,446
that was the hardest thing
I have ever done in my life.

1529
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:04,321
But everybody knew
that a clean break
was the only way.

1530
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:07,724
That was the only way
I could do it.

1531
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:15,232
You mourn the loss.

1532
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:16,633
You pick yourself up,

1533
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:18,768
and you carry on
and you...

1534
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,440
you try to learn
not to hate Sundays.

1535
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:31,281
I mean, there was never
any question as to what
I was going to do.

1536
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:36,086
Eddie was gone.

1537
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,855
My parents
couldn't take it on

1538
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,657
and I certainly
couldn't do it alone.

1539
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:45,795
We interviewed
11 couples.

1540
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:53,537
And when
the twelfth couple
walked in,

1541
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:56,173
Debra and Carl Wolf...

1542
01:07:56,206 --> 01:07:58,708
I-I knew

1543
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:01,745
that they were the people
to adopt my baby.

1544
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:06,783
Thank you
for choosing them.

1545
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:09,085
I should be thanking them.

1546
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:13,223
I never had to spend
a day worrying

1547
01:08:13,257 --> 01:08:15,259
that you weren't
in great hands.

1548
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,862
Did you ever
have any regrets?

1549
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:20,464
Mm.

1550
01:08:25,802 --> 01:08:27,604
Regret changes nothing.

1551
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:31,608
But I have to tell you...

1552
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:36,546
since meeting you...

1553
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:40,550
I've wondered

1554
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:42,319
what might have been.

1555
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,590
Had it been
just you and me?

1556
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,292
You and me.

1557
01:08:54,264 --> 01:08:56,533
I don't want
you to take this
the wrong way...

1558
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,804
but thank you

1559
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,539
for giving me
to them.

1560
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:06,676
There has not
been a day

1561
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:09,879
that I haven't felt
100% a part of them.

1562
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,616
They're amazing.

1563
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:16,920
My dad,

1564
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:19,923
my sweet,
goofy dad,

1565
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:23,927
I could not
have chosen
a better man

1566
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,463
to show me the ways
of the world.

1567
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:29,233
And my mom,

1568
01:09:29,266 --> 01:09:32,936
she's been more
than a mom to me.

1569
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:35,505
She's been a friend.

1570
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:37,941
She's shared
my successes,

1571
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:41,945
cried through
my disappointments
with me.

1572
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:46,683
I could not have
done it without her.

1573
01:09:49,253 --> 01:09:50,820
I don't know
if you realize

1574
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:52,889
the gift that you
gave me and them.

1575
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:59,463
But's beyond
anything that words
could measure.

1576
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:06,703
Well, I knew
that she'd be perfect.

1577
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:09,706
When my mom found out
that I was getting married,

1578
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:12,609
she was more excited
than I was.

1579
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:14,444
( laughs )

1580
01:10:14,478 --> 01:10:18,648
She helped Chris
find the ring.

1581
01:10:18,682 --> 01:10:22,852
She helped orchestrate
that wacky proposal.

1582
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:26,423
She could not wait
to start planning.

1583
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:29,559
But she hasn't
really been planning

1584
01:10:29,593 --> 01:10:31,595
this wedding
with me, has she?

1585
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,733
No.

1586
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:38,368
No, she hasn't.

1587
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:45,909
Maybe we should rethink
some of our decisions.

1588
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,753
I have an interesting idea.
You want to hear it?

1589
01:10:56,786 --> 01:10:58,522
I do.

1590
01:10:58,555 --> 01:10:59,789
Okay, 'cause it's good.

1591
01:10:59,823 --> 01:11:02,359
( sighs )

1592
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:07,030
I could get used to this
life of leisure thing.

1593
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:09,599
Please. You'll be
bored in a week.

1594
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:12,802
No, I don't
think I would.

1595
01:11:12,836 --> 01:11:16,005
Stop pretending that
all of this is okay.

1596
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:18,642
Stop pretending
that you're fine

1597
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:20,444
with these wedding
plans going on
without you

1598
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:21,945
and stop pretending
that you don't care

1599
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:23,447
that the charity
is shutting down.

1600
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,350
This is not
the obnoxiously
strong-willed,

1601
01:11:26,383 --> 01:11:27,951
stubborn woman
I married.

1602
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:31,821
I thought you hated
when I became obnoxiously
strong-willed.

1603
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:34,591
Usually I do.

1604
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:37,361
But this isn't you, honey.
You're not one to hide.

1605
01:11:37,394 --> 01:11:39,095
You're not one to shrink
when things get tough.

1606
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,331
Please stop this.

1607
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:45,835
Put away the magazine
and fight.

1608
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:55,612
Debra, what can
I do for you?

1609
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:58,014
Did we have
an appointment?

1610
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,616
No, we didn't

1611
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:02,386
and I apologize
for showing up
unannounced,

1612
01:12:02,419 --> 01:12:04,754
but I have something
to say to you.

1613
01:12:04,788 --> 01:12:07,857
Now,
I'm warning you,

1614
01:12:07,891 --> 01:12:09,626
it's completely
inappropriate

1615
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:13,597
and not at all

1616
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:16,400
my place to say this,
but I have to.

1617
01:12:16,433 --> 01:12:19,068
This is your money,
Elaine,

1618
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:21,605
and you have
a lot of it.

1619
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:27,143
But Alistair
worked hard
for decades

1620
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,878
to amass
this fortune,

1621
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:31,147
and he told me
on numerous
occasions

1622
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,150
how much he loved
helping people.

1623
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:37,153
How much he
really enjoyed
giving back.

1624
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,155
Especially
to the people

1625
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,090
that we serve
at our foundation.

1626
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:46,463
That is because he knew
how easy it was for any of us

1627
01:12:46,496 --> 01:12:47,864
to fall on hard times.

1628
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:51,701
And he also knew
how lucky he was,

1629
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:54,404
and he felt that it was
his responsibility

1630
01:12:54,438 --> 01:12:56,406
to help others

1631
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,008
because of the position
that he was in.

1632
01:13:01,611 --> 01:13:04,648
He was not
a weak man, Elaine,

1633
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:07,651
and he did not give

1634
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:10,654
because he didn't
know how to say no.

1635
01:13:10,687 --> 01:13:14,090
He gave because
it filled him up.

1636
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:16,893
It gave him
a sense of pride

1637
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:18,962
and purpose.

1638
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:23,199
Honor his memory,
Elaine.

1639
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:27,003
Be the kind of person
that Alistair was

1640
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:30,440
and reinstate
your funding.

1641
01:13:32,175 --> 01:13:33,477
Okay.

1642
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:37,013
Fine.

1643
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:41,084
I'll reinstate
the funding.

1644
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:42,786
Thank you.

1645
01:13:44,488 --> 01:13:45,889
Thank you.

1646
01:13:49,593 --> 01:13:50,827
( cell phone ringing )

1647
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:54,498
- Haley.
- Oh, thank goodness, Debra.

1648
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:57,200
I need you to meet me
at one of our vendors
as soon as possible.

1649
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:59,803
- It's pretty urgent.
- What's the matter?

1650
01:13:59,836 --> 01:14:01,538
Everything's fine.
I just can't get
ahold of Jenna

1651
01:14:01,571 --> 01:14:03,807
and I need you
to sign off on some
reception details.

1652
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,711
- Can you meet me right now?
- Sure. Just text me
the address.

1653
01:14:07,744 --> 01:14:09,112
Oh, fantastic.

1654
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:11,515
You are
an absolute lifesaver.

1655
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:13,216
Yeah.
( laughs )

1656
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:30,934
Hollister Ranch?
This isn't one
of our vendors.

1657
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:46,182
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

1658
01:14:47,183 --> 01:14:48,918
Thanks for coming.

1659
01:14:48,952 --> 01:14:51,187
What are you doing here
at Hollister Ranch?

1660
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,056
You're supposed to be
at the Wilton Club.

1661
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:57,026
This is where I'm going
to have my wedding

1662
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:59,195
on the seventh.

1663
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,964
Haley has
been very busy

1664
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:03,900
making new arrangements
the past couple weeks.

1665
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:07,236
Jenna, the invitations
have already gone out
to everyone.

1666
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:09,873
Haley's taking care
of all that too.

1667
01:15:09,906 --> 01:15:12,609
Jenna and I
had a talk
and realized

1668
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:15,612
that maybe
we did go
a bit overboard.

1669
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:18,582
I think
that a nice
family wedding

1670
01:15:18,615 --> 01:15:20,316
is the perfect way
for Jenna and Chris

1671
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,951
to start their lives
together.

1672
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:26,022
Are you sure this is
what you really want?

1673
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:28,257
I'm sure.

1674
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:30,994
Mom, I'd love to stay,

1675
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,829
but I'm actually late
to a PTA meeting.

1676
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:33,930
Bye.

1677
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:35,264
- Thank you.
- Bye, sweetie.

1678
01:15:35,298 --> 01:15:36,666
Bye, Mom.

1679
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,902
- I love you.
- You too.

1680
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,339
Okay, Debra,
I have taken care of

1681
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,941
all of
the paperwork here,

1682
01:15:44,974 --> 01:15:47,043
but we still
need to give
the Events Manager

1683
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:49,979
over at the Wilton Club
your signature to
wrap things up

1684
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:53,082
and she can see us
at 4:00 P.M.

1685
01:15:53,116 --> 01:15:55,785
And she's okay
with all of this?

1686
01:15:55,819 --> 01:15:59,723
Is she going to be
able to fill that space
on such short notice?

1687
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:02,959
She can
and she did.

1688
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:04,060
Haley.

1689
01:16:05,128 --> 01:16:07,030
Why are you doing
all of this?

1690
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:08,965
Because you were right.

1691
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:11,968
I just needed to stop
and be real for a minute.

1692
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:14,971
What I wanted for Jenna
and who she actually is

1693
01:16:15,004 --> 01:16:17,206
weren't quite in sync.

1694
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:20,343
She's amazing.

1695
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:22,345
You did a great job
with her.

1696
01:16:23,713 --> 01:16:25,649
Thank you.

1697
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:27,283
I know
I've been unfair

1698
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:29,953
to both of you,

1699
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:33,957
but after meeting
that beautiful soul

1700
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:36,993
and then having her
adore me, it just...

1701
01:16:38,361 --> 01:16:41,097
I don't know.
It felt good.

1702
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:42,766
I know
that sounds silly.

1703
01:16:42,799 --> 01:16:44,000
No.

1704
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:46,703
It doesn't sound silly.

1705
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:52,208
I'm sorry for getting
carried away too.

1706
01:16:53,309 --> 01:16:55,712
You're a good mom.

1707
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:58,748
So much better than
I ever would have been.

1708
01:17:00,183 --> 01:17:02,686
It's a challenge.

1709
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,689
A lot of worrying and...

1710
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:08,725
sleepless nights
and trying to balance

1711
01:17:08,758 --> 01:17:10,994
friend and being a parent.

1712
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:15,732
Teenage girls
can be...

1713
01:17:17,033 --> 01:17:18,835
- complicated.
- ( laughs )

1714
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:20,403
I know. I was one.

1715
01:17:20,436 --> 01:17:23,439
I mean,
look at what I put
my parents through.

1716
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,142
( both laugh )

1717
01:17:29,846 --> 01:17:31,247
Thank you, Debra.

1718
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:36,319
You gave me my life.

1719
01:17:36,352 --> 01:17:38,922
And you made mine.

1720
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:45,128
You know, Haley,

1721
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:47,864
Jenna only has one mom,

1722
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:50,233
but in our family...

1723
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:55,138
there's plenty of room
for very special friends.

1724
01:17:58,808 --> 01:18:00,810
Okay, all right,
we have to go.

1725
01:18:00,844 --> 01:18:02,912
We have
to get a move on

1726
01:18:02,946 --> 01:18:04,714
if we're
going to make it
to the Wilton Club.

1727
01:18:04,748 --> 01:18:06,215
I'll follow you
in my car.

1728
01:18:06,249 --> 01:18:09,318
In this car
at the Wilton Club?

1729
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:12,088
I don't think so.

1730
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:13,990
Come on.
You're going
to come with me.

1731
01:18:32,842 --> 01:18:34,343
Hey, Jillian,
we're here to see Kelly.

1732
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:36,312
Sure. She's waiting
in her office.
Go on back.

1733
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:43,920
So if
you will just sign

1734
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:46,790
everywhere you see
a sticky.

1735
01:18:48,992 --> 01:18:50,760
This is a contract.

1736
01:18:50,794 --> 01:18:54,197
I need to sign
a contract to get
my deposit back?

1737
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,200
What? No.

1738
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:59,002
No, there's
no deposit back.

1739
01:18:59,035 --> 01:19:00,436
That's for
your fund-raiser.

1740
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:08,244
When Haley told us about
your wonderful charity

1741
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:10,413
and the fact that
your daughter's wedding
plans were changing,

1742
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:12,248
I went to the board,

1743
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:15,018
and they are
more than happy
to sponsor your event.

1744
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:18,421
Um...

1745
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:21,925
you paid
Hollister Ranch?

1746
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:27,396
It's not
from the deposit
from here to them?

1747
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:30,199
Just consider me
a benefactor,

1748
01:19:30,233 --> 01:19:34,203
a benefactor donating
to a very good cause.

1749
01:19:34,237 --> 01:19:36,806
And to that end,
I have invited

1750
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,809
the crème de la crme
of society from
our membership.

1751
01:19:39,843 --> 01:19:41,244
You're going
to be exposed

1752
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:43,880
to a whole new world
of potential donors.

1753
01:19:43,913 --> 01:19:46,883
Our members have just
a little bit of money.

1754
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:50,353
Everything from Jenna's
over-the-top wedding

1755
01:19:50,386 --> 01:19:53,456
will be transferred here
to your fund-raiser,
all of it donated.

1756
01:19:53,489 --> 01:19:57,193
Well, everything except
for the chocolate fountain
and Sebastian's cake.

1757
01:19:57,226 --> 01:19:58,527
Jenna wasn't
about to give those up.

1758
01:19:58,561 --> 01:20:00,463
I mean, you've had
Sebastian's cake.

1759
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:04,000
Anyone who
is anyone has had
Sebastian's--

1760
01:20:04,033 --> 01:20:05,534
Sebastian's cakes.

1761
01:20:05,568 --> 01:20:07,470
Well, we are
also keeping

1762
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:10,406
Vastille's extravagant
centerpieces.

1763
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:12,575
Our members love
his floral arrangements

1764
01:20:12,608 --> 01:20:15,578
and I thought we could
hold a silent auction
for the flowers

1765
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:18,247
with all the proceeds
going to your cause.

1766
01:20:18,281 --> 01:20:20,216
I don't know
what to say.

1767
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:21,550
Don't say anything.

1768
01:20:21,584 --> 01:20:24,187
Just call your boss

1769
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:26,189
and tell him not
to close those doors yet.

1770
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:32,095
Thank you, Haley.

1771
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,632
After everything
that you've done for me,

1772
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,567
this is
the least I could do.

1773
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:43,206
Aw, well, kumbaya.

1774
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:45,574
I've got a lot
of work to do, so--

1775
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:46,943
( clicks tongue )

1776
01:20:54,383 --> 01:20:56,119
( laughs )
Finally.

1777
01:20:56,152 --> 01:20:57,420
The crystal toilets.

1778
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:59,422
Oh, the pictures
don't do it justice.

1779
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:01,124
You'll see 'em tomorrow
at the fund-raiser.

1780
01:21:01,157 --> 01:21:03,092
Peg, they're ridiculous.

1781
01:21:03,126 --> 01:21:04,427
I don't know
who would want those.

1782
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,029
Listen, when I
win the lottery,

1783
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:07,596
I am putting one
in every room.

1784
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:10,166
But not in the kitchen.
That's where I draw the line.

1785
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:12,335
Okay, hi.

1786
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,237
This is your
one-hour warning.

1787
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:16,439
Okay, ladies,
you look beautiful,

1788
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:17,640
really,
just beautiful.

1789
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:20,009
Bridal party, hi.
Hello.

1790
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:21,444
No gum.
You hear me?

1791
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:23,212
( swallows )

1792
01:21:23,246 --> 01:21:24,480
Okay.
All the vendors

1793
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:26,549
are present
and accounted for.

1794
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:28,551
Christopher looks
very handsome,

1795
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:30,253
a little sweaty.

1796
01:21:30,286 --> 01:21:33,256
( laughs )
He's so cute
when he gets nervous.

1797
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:36,425
Okay, let's
continue operation
beautification.

1798
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:38,061
I-- oh, my God.

1799
01:21:38,094 --> 01:21:39,595
Where's my latte?
Go. Go.

1800
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:51,975
All right, come on, people.

1801
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:53,442
It is showtime.

1802
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:55,478
Oh, Grandma.

1803
01:21:55,511 --> 01:21:57,413
Who is escorting Grandma
down the aisle?

1804
01:21:57,446 --> 01:21:59,015
Oh, I got this.

1805
01:21:59,048 --> 01:22:01,317
Come on, baby.
Shake a leg, both of 'em.

1806
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,252
All right,
bridesmaids,
let's go.

1807
01:22:03,286 --> 01:22:05,354
Line up.
Let's go. Let's go.

1808
01:22:05,388 --> 01:22:06,489
Hi. Tallest
to shortest.

1809
01:22:06,522 --> 01:22:08,424
Come on. Come on.
Wake up. Wake up.

1810
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:11,160
Alexis! Gum!

1811
01:22:12,328 --> 01:22:15,064
Give it.
( scoffs )

1812
01:22:15,098 --> 01:22:17,333
Go. Go.

1813
01:22:19,302 --> 01:22:21,437
Go.

1814
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:24,507
All right,
you ready for the moment?

1815
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:28,711
Cue bride.

1816
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:44,293
You look exquisite.

1817
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,731
Dad, you're going
to make me cry.

1818
01:22:52,068 --> 01:22:54,170
Okay, nice moment.

1819
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:56,339
We've got
a wedding to do.
All right.

1820
01:22:56,372 --> 01:22:59,175
Best man,

1821
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:00,576
you escort mother
of the bride.

1822
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:01,710
Wait!

1823
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:03,279
Um...

1824
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:06,282
it's always been
the three of us.

1825
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,284
We're a team,

1826
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:09,752
Team Wolf.

1827
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:12,155
I want both
of you to walk me
down the aisle.

1828
01:23:13,456 --> 01:23:14,757
Team Wolf.

1829
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:16,759
( laughs )

1830
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:18,361
Team Wolf.

1831
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:22,098
Flowers.

1832
01:23:22,131 --> 01:23:23,799
You look beautiful.

1833
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,401
Thank you.

1834
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:26,435
Okay.

1835
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:29,772
All right.

1836
01:23:32,108 --> 01:23:34,143
( organ playing
"Bridal Chorus" )

1837
01:24:28,764 --> 01:24:33,602
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1838
01:24:35,371 --> 01:24:36,839
And you may kiss
the bride.

1839
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:42,311
( cheering )

1840
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:52,388
Go.

1841
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:54,257
( dance music playing )

1842
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:56,625
* Hey, there's nothing left
to appreciate... *

1843
01:24:56,659 --> 01:24:59,528
I have no idea
what this is.

1844
01:24:59,562 --> 01:25:02,131
You did not
tell me this.

1845
01:25:02,165 --> 01:25:04,267
* ...for us
to celebrate *

1846
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:06,169
* Soiree...

1847
01:25:06,202 --> 01:25:07,336
They did this
on their own.

1848
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:08,504
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1849
01:25:08,537 --> 01:25:12,408
* Get up out your seat

1850
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:15,611
* Don't fight it,
you'll like it *

1851
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:18,447
* Surrender to
the beat, y'all *

1852
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:21,317
- * It's a party...
- ( screams )

1853
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:24,187
* Gyrate, vibrate,
percolate, levitate *

1854
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:27,456
* At the soiree...

1855
01:25:29,192 --> 01:25:30,693
My mommies.

1856
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:32,928
* It's a party

1857
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,931
* Create, checkmate,
simulate, and repeat *

1858
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,601
* At the soiree...

1859
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:42,738
- Work it out.
- * The soiree, the soiree,
the soiree, the soiree, oh *

1860
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:45,641
* I've got that itch
to collaborate *

1861
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:48,411
* Party

1862
01:25:48,444 --> 01:25:51,780
* The time has come
for us to demonstrate *

1863
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:53,649
* Soiree

1864
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:57,386
* Get up on your feet

1865
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:00,323
* Get up out your seat

1866
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:02,225
* Get on up

1867
01:26:02,258 --> 01:26:03,759
* Now get down

1868
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:06,795
* Surrender to
the beat, y'all *

1869
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:09,332
* It's a party...

1870
01:26:10,766 --> 01:26:12,568
( applause )

1871
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:13,936
Whoo!

1872
01:26:18,941 --> 01:26:21,810
* It's a party...

1873
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:23,446
Have fun.

1874
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:30,653
It was
a beautiful wedding.

1875
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,255
It was perfect.

1876
01:26:32,288 --> 01:26:33,422
Just perfect.

1877
01:26:34,757 --> 01:26:36,592
I'm going to need
a good night's sleep.

1878
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:38,427
Sleep?
Are you kidding me?

1879
01:26:38,461 --> 01:26:40,463
Oh, no, we have
a fund-raiser
in 19 hours.

1880
01:26:40,496 --> 01:26:41,864
We've got
a charity to save.

1881
01:26:41,897 --> 01:26:43,466
We're not sleeping
until Monday.

1882
01:26:43,499 --> 01:26:44,867
I don't think
I have the strength.

1883
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,469
Haley:
Oh, you can do this.

1884
01:26:46,502 --> 01:26:48,337
I'll be with you
every step of the way.

1885
01:26:48,371 --> 01:26:50,373
Two events back-to-back,
that's old hat for me.

1886
01:26:50,406 --> 01:26:52,441
We'll do it together.
It'll be fun.

1887
01:26:52,475 --> 01:26:54,477
All right, I'm glad
you brought this up

1888
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:56,845
because I want to talk
to you about the seating
arrangements. We--

1889
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:59,515
I'm getting a drink.

1890
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,250
Did you just
put your hand up...

1891
01:27:01,284 --> 01:27:02,651
- Mm-hmm.
- ...you gave me
the hand.

1892
01:27:02,685 --> 01:27:04,387
I did.

1893
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:07,356
Guess we're
having drinks and
talking about seating.

1894
01:27:19,868 --> 01:27:23,872
* Hey, there's nothing left
to negotiate *

1895
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:26,475
* Party

1896
01:27:26,509 --> 01:27:29,745
* The time has come
for us to celebrate *

1897
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:31,914
* Soiree

1898
01:27:31,947 --> 01:27:34,650
* Get up on your feet

1899
01:27:34,683 --> 01:27:38,053
* Get up out your seat

1900
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:41,657
* Don't fight it,
you'll like it *

1901
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:44,893
* Surrender to
the beat, y'all *

1902
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:47,496
* It's a party

1903
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:50,599
* Gyrate, vibrate,
percolate, levitate *

1904
01:27:50,633 --> 01:27:53,369
* At the soiree

1905
01:27:53,402 --> 01:27:56,705
* Fixate, inflate,
radiate, resonate *

1906
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:59,375
* It's a party

1907
01:27:59,408 --> 01:28:02,545
* Create, checkmate,
simulate, and repeat *

1908
01:28:02,578 --> 01:28:05,013
* At the soiree

1909
01:28:05,047 --> 01:28:09,051
* The soiree, the soiree,
the soiree, the soiree, oh. *
