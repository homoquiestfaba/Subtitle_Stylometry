1
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,521
<i>For blessed are the dead who die</i>

2
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,357
<i>unto the Lord, for my enemies...</i>

3
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,297
<i>The Devil has been invited
into New Bethlehem</i>

4
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,598
<i>under our watch.</i>

5
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:23,316
<i>The signs of the Drommelkind</i>

6
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,351
<i>are clear to all with open eyes.</i>

7
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,268
<i>Six girls born on the sixth day
of the sixth month.</i>

8
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:47,807
<i>Their 18th birthdays approach.</i>

9
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,410
<i>One will emerge.</i>

10
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:14,700
Get another cloth!

11
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,302
It's another girl.

12
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:29,916
The prophecy.

13
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,520
Push!

14
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,491
Push! Push! Push!

15
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:40,426
I need scissors! Thank you.

16
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,461
<i>Bear down!</i>

17
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,766
Push!

18
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,801
<i>Almost here. Push.</i>

19
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,937
It's a girl.

20
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:05,218
Oh, please, Elders, don't.

21
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,221
Midnight approaches. The
rapture is at stake.

22
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,956
Number five.

23
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,692
It's a girl.

24
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,561
Step aside.

25
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,675
Please let it be a boy.

26
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,581
<i>Elder Beacon.</i>

27
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,786
These births are an abomination.

28
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,589
I will not let you do this.

29
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,731
Six girls.

30
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,966
These births are a miracle, Elder.

31
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:57,603
He is here. I can feel his presence.

32
00:03:57,636 --> 00:04:00,706
The prophecy is being fulfilled.
Step aside, Jacob.

33
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,475
You are not killing these babies.

34
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,810
Are you insane?!

35
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:21,994
♪ Go to sleep, go to sleep ♪

36
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:27,967
♪ Go to sleep, little Rose ♪

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,003
♪ Go to sleep... ♪

38
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:34,040
I'm so sorry, sweet Rose.

39
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:38,044
But I can't let this
prophecy come to light.

40
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:41,747
Forgive me. Forgive me.

41
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,584
Forgive me. Forgive me.

42
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:48,821
Forgive me. Forgive me.

43
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:52,591
- <i> Go to sleep.</i>

44
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:58,564
Oh, my God. Catherine, what have you done?

45
00:04:58,597 --> 00:04:59,899
This is the only remedy.

46
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,568
Hey, what are we doing about our birthday?

47
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,937
- Oh, I don't know.
- Something fun.

48
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,039
What about a pony ride and a banquet lunch

49
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:41,841
<i>like when we were children?</i>

50
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,110
- What?
- What's so funny about that?

51
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,112
Pony rides and a banquet lunch?

52
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,080
We're turning 18, Sarah, not eight.

53
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:49,982
All right, we're just
throwing around ideas.

54
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,984
Yeah, let's just have another
horribly boring birthday.

55
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:54,854
Wait, wait, I got it.

56
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:59,392
How about a moonlit dinner
with long tables and candles...

57
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:02,862
And you seated between
Warren Adler and Lucas Finch.

58
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:17,743
<i>Come in. The water feels great.</i>

59
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:20,746
What the hell are you doing?

60
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,014
Going for a swim.

61
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:27,887
You're such an asshole.

62
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,889
Get out!

63
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,894
<i>Come on, we have to leave!</i>

64
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,663
Abby.

65
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:40,099
Abigail, come on!

66
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:42,201
Abby. Abby.

67
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:44,036
<i>Abby, come here.</i>

68
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,606
<i>Abby, come here, put this on.</i>

69
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:10,229
<i>Mary!</i>

70
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:11,697
What happened?

71
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:15,735
<i>Mary...</i>

72
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,139
Come on, you can do it.

73
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:26,045
<i>Oh, God. Come on. Come on, Mary.</i>

74
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,181
<i>Come on.</i>

75
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:31,817
She's going to be okay.
She's going to be okay.

76
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,061
<i>She's going to be okay.</i>

77
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,124
<i>Oh, come on, Mary.</i>

78
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:44,830
Yeah, get it all out.

79
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,874
You're gonna be okay.

80
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:58,711
You just swallowed a little bit of water.

81
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,012
Thanks.

82
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,149
<i>Abby.</i>

83
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,519
We need to go. Now.

84
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,021
<i>We should've never come here.</i>

85
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,227
We can't tell anyone about the boys.

86
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,996
Elder Beacon will shun us.

87
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,031
I said we shouldn't go to the lake.

88
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,567
Really, Sarah, they were just boys.

89
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,769
They were town boys and naked.

90
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:26,539
- No one needs to know.
- But we can't lie.

91
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,678
Don't they talk about us enough as it is?

92
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,178
You're sure you're all right, Mary?

93
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:35,014
Yes, I'm fine.

94
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,682
Good night, then.

95
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:42,087
Well, bye.

96
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,159
Your fits always scare me.
I gotta get home.

97
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,095
I have chores to do.

98
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,038
<i>Elder Stone on patrol.</i>

99
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:06,045
Are you sure about supper?

100
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,913
Well, then I suppose
we'll just have to talk

101
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,915
about your first kiss tomorrow.

102
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:11,317
What?

103
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,053
What are you talking about?
What first kiss?

104
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,236
Father?

105
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,220
Father?

106
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,108
No! No!!

107
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,144
No! No! No!

108
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:54,914
No! No! No!

109
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,751
No! No!

110
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,219
No, please!

111
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,221
No! No!

112
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:06,792
No! No!

113
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,249
Mary, where have you been?

114
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,385
I'm sorry, I had another
one of my episodes.

115
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:37,055
Have some water. Come sit down.

116
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:38,423
Are you all right?

117
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:40,425
How bad was it this time?

118
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,427
Medium.

119
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,229
They're getting worse.

120
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:45,464
They're not getting worse.

121
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:47,366
She hasn't had one for years,

122
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,002
and then she had one three days
ago and another one today?

123
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,471
- Where were you?
- The lake.

124
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:55,140
The near side or the far?

125
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:57,176
I'm not quite sure what
the difference makes.

126
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,411
Mary, watch your tone.

127
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:04,149
I'm sorry, Rebekah.

128
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:06,285
The far.

129
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,220
Have you nothing to say to this

130
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:10,122
that she insists on defying rules?

131
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:12,491
I hardly think a swim
is tantamount to treason.

132
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:15,260
- Mary, Mary...
- Thomas, be quiet.

133
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:17,429
- It was your idea to go off...
- Thomas, shut your mouth.

134
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,064
- Mary!
- He's the one being impolite.

135
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,432
Jacob, please.

136
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,134
Don't talk to your brother like that.

137
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,837
You wipe that smile off your face.

138
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,138
I'm not hungry.

139
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,109
You are not excused from the table.

140
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:34,413
Rebekah. I'll deal with this.

141
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,415
I wish you would.

142
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,851
She and those girls run around
with no repercussions.

143
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:42,221
They're best friends.

144
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:54,133
Try not to get so worked up like that.

145
00:13:56,501 --> 00:14:00,239
Especially so soon after...

146
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,341
You always take her side.

147
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,142
You didn't let me finish.

148
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:05,510
She hates me.

149
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:08,614
Rebekah does not hate you. She doesn't.

150
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,083
I'm trying to be a good daughter.

151
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,252
She treats me differently.

152
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:21,360
I miss Mother.

153
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,467
I know.

154
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:36,141
She died, and I never got to know her.

155
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:41,647
There are some things

156
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,649
over which we just have no control.

157
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:51,323
But I do know that she'd
be very proud of you.

158
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:55,386
You are just like her, you know that?

159
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,199
Headstrong.

160
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:02,401
But lovely.

161
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,908
Try to get some sleep.

162
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,278
Okay.

163
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,328
<i>Martha?</i>

164
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,305
Like so, providing a clean edge.

165
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:56,615
Put the labels on straight, Louisa.

166
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,484
- A word, Rebekah.
- Yes, Elder Beacon.

167
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:02,554
It seems Hannah Smith has gone missing.

168
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:06,458
<i>She did not return home last night.</i>

169
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:10,529
Can someone tell me why it is
we live here in New Bethlehem,

170
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,531
why we live as we do

171
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:16,101
while all others embrace the path of ease?

172
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,669
To remain in the light.

173
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:20,372
This is so, Mary Brown,

174
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:23,542
for New Bethlehem is a beacon of light

175
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,811
in a dark world.

176
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:30,282
And for this, we are glad and give thanks.

177
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,683
<i>Abigail Beecher,</i>

178
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:35,754
what is it that Satan craves most of all?

179
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:42,127
You know it, child.
I can read it in your face.

180
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,399
The fiend craves young flesh.

181
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:50,735
And he is more cunning
than you will ever foresee.

182
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:53,438
He tempts our young women

183
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:56,608
to the outside as he has with Hannah Smith.

184
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:01,646
I say this not to frighten you,
but to help you.

185
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,848
Do you understand?

186
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,716
Yes, Elder Beacon.

187
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:06,385
That is good.

188
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,756
Elder Beacon, if I may speak.

189
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:14,759
<i>With all respect,</i>

190
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:16,561
I do not believe Hannah would have fled.

191
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:18,463
<i>We were with her until dusk,</i>

192
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:19,798
and she would've spoken to one of us.

193
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,567
Yes, you were with her.

194
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,471
At the far side of the lake.

195
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:31,376
<i>There are reasons for our boundaries.</i>

196
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,484
Work quietly.

197
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:46,525
It doesn't make sense.
We watched her go home.

198
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,926
Maybe she went to go see the boys.

199
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,528
No.

200
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,897
She could have. She's done it before.

201
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,366
- We have to look for her.
- But we can't.

202
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,601
Sarah, this isn't the time for rules.

203
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:58,670
We have to do it ourselves.

204
00:18:58,703 --> 00:18:59,905
Tonight.

205
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,549
Father, may I please go to
Ruth's house after I've cleared?

206
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:45,951
At this hour?

207
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,953
We're all really worried about Hannah.

208
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,723
We'd just like to be together. Please?

209
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:56,895
All right. Not too late.

210
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:59,564
<i>Thank you.</i>

211
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:01,366
Plate.

212
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:09,441
Not that way.

213
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,476
How else do you expect to go to town?

214
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:13,245
We're not going to town.

215
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,746
Where are we going?

216
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,815
You just have to trust me. Come on.

217
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,918
Your daughters' 18th birthdays

218
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:22,887
will arrive in just days.

219
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,924
We all know the dangers
that could befall us.

220
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:30,962
The signs of the Drommelkind
are clear to all with open eyes.

221
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:36,268
Six girls born on the sixth day
of the sixth month.

222
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:40,272
Yet you, Jacob Brown,
declared it a miracle.

223
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,540
Even now, with this disappearance,

224
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:44,609
you think it a coincidence?

225
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:45,810
These are normal girls,

226
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,612
and they've lived their whole lives

227
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:49,914
with the whispers of something
they know naught of.

228
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:55,787
As we speak, they are together
at Ruth's house worried sick.

229
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,757
Ruth spoke of the girls
convening at Abigail's.

230
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,991
<i>You see?</i>

231
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:02,027
They break covenant at every turn.

232
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,663
You are losing your tether on them.

233
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,565
<i>Your own flesh deceives you,
and yet you doubt</i>

234
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:09,534
the Prince of Lies could do the same.

235
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,704
Dear Elders,
is there a remedy we may speak of?

236
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:15,674
You are all aware of the remedy.

237
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:16,941
<i>The remedy?</i>

238
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,077
These rumors are running out of control.

239
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,647
Satan has been invited into
New Bethlehem under our watch!

240
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,884
<i>Their 18th birthdays approach.</i>

241
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,786
Abby,
would you just tell us where we're going?

242
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,355
<i>One will emerge.</i>

243
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,558
<i>We're here.</i>

244
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:38,596
<i>I'm really not sure about this.</i>

245
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,665
- Abby, what are you doing?
- Blending in.

246
00:21:40,698 --> 00:21:42,534
We can go in there. It's forbidden.

247
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,778
<i>What if Hannah's here and we turn back now?</i>

248
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:52,844
Mary!

249
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,084

264
00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:35,854
Hello, commune girl.
What are you doing here?

265
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,155
Looking for our friend.

266
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:39,591
She has reddish hair.
You met her at the lake.

267
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,826
I might know where we could go find her.

268
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:43,395
Wanna go take a look?

269
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,430
Yeah.

270
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:46,798
Let's go.

271
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:48,400
We'll check this way.

272
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,968
Abby.

273
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,903
We should go home. We need to go home.

274
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:55,407
Is that her? Is that her? Hannah.

275
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,808
Long time no see.

276
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:58,999
I save your life, and I don't get a hello?

277
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:03,782
Trevor. I'm surprised to see you here.

278
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,184
- We're not supposed to be here.
- Hey, where's your bonnet?

279
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:09,954
That doesn't bother you?

280
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:11,623
Should it?

281
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,826
You want to take a walk? Come on.

282
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,599
- Hannah?
- Hannah?

283
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,702
Hey.

284
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:26,872
- You want a beer?
- No.

285
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,201
Yeah, I'm not thirsty either.

286
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:35,146
Look at that.

287
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,982
It's a new moon tonight. They're all out.

288
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:41,119
The little dipper, Ursa Major.

289
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:44,756
What?

290
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:46,991
That... that's not Ursa Major.

291
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:48,827
That's Cassiopeia.

292
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,029
That's Ursa Major.

293
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:56,935
I should've known you'd know
more about that stuff than me.

294
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,204
Well, I'm not supposed to,
but my father taught me.

295
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,606
Well, way to impress a girl, right?

296
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,210
I didn't mean...

297
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:07,212
I'm not trying to impress you.

298
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,180
Shit.

299
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:11,683
Sorry, my language.

300
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:12,951
Stupid me.

301
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:17,222
You make me nervous.

302
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,890
I make you nervous?

303
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:22,727
Yeah.

304
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:34,539
I-I have to... I have to go.

305
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:41,980
Abby? Ruth!

306
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,094
Hannah?

307
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,979
<i>Another of our flock has disappeared.</i>

308
00:25:48,012 --> 00:25:51,149
Abigail Beecher did not return

309
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,786
<i>to her family yesterday eve.</i>

310
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:59,123
And like the disappearance of Hannah Smith,

311
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:04,262
I believe this is the work of an evil

312
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:06,931
we have known for years.

313
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:10,101
<i>Those of you who know of what I speak</i>

314
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:13,271
know the mortal danger
New Bethlehem is now in.

315
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:21,212
I fear that only sin and transgression

316
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:27,118
can breach our walls,
for are we not good soldiers?

317
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:30,088
Will we not be as bold as lions?

318
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,359
Hey, Mary.

319
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,828
Can I talk to you for a minute?

320
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,663
What are you doing here?

321
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:41,032
Hold on a second. I need to talk to you.

322
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:42,233
I can't, not here.

323
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:45,236
Frank's missing.

324
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:48,840
Ever since the party.
Do you know anything about that?

325
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,976
No, I... just...

326
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:54,912
Look, sorry if I came on too strong,

327
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:57,048
but it's important.

328
00:26:57,081 --> 00:27:00,652
Can I help you, young man?

329
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,388
Hi, I'm Trevor.

330
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:06,290
Do you two know each other?

331
00:27:06,323 --> 00:27:09,394
Oh, no, I was just asking
if anyone here knew anything

332
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:12,163
about the accident last night
out on the interstate.

333
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:16,968
My dad's the sheriff, and so sometimes
I help him collect information.

334
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:19,337
I don't think they would,
but if you must inquire,

335
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:22,641
Elder Beacon handles such matters.

336
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:27,364
Okay, well, thanks,
sorry for the interruption.

337
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,258
Mary, you should eat.

338
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,393
Father, what does Elder Beacon speak of?

339
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:46,197
This evil we have feared for decades,
what is that?

340
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,166
He speaks of the Drommelkind.

341
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,901
Rebekah.

342
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,903
- Please?
- <i> What is the Drommelkind?</i>

343
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,204
Is that what people whisper of us?

344
00:27:53,237 --> 00:27:55,173
Oh, it's just an old tale, a myth.

345
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,908
Please tell me.

346
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,911
For once, Mary and I are in agreement.

347
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,979
<i>Answer the girl's question.</i>

348
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:05,249
Thomas, will you take your
siblings upstairs, please?

349
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:06,951
- But I want to hear.
- Now.

350
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:17,929
When the six of you were born,
Elder Beacon declared

351
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:20,031
that the prophecy was being fulfilled

352
00:28:20,064 --> 00:28:22,500
and a great evil would enter our world.

353
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:24,335
But there are only five of us.

354
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:28,239
Little Rose died when she was a baby,

355
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:30,942
<i>but the remaining five of you,</i>

356
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,495
<i>you all grew up together like sisters.</i>

357
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,946
And our 18th birthday,

358
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,514
what significance does that have?

359
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:39,383
The prophecy is that on that day,

360
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:42,487
only one would remain.

361
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,489
She would become the Devil's hand,

362
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,024
the Drommelkind.

363
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:50,128
That cannot be true.

364
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,497
<i>Most certainly not.</i>

365
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,166
But there is something you should know.

366
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:57,101
On the day you were born,

367
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:59,771
Elder Beacon wanted you all killed.

368
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,339
Not many people know this.

369
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,342
I would not let him.

370
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,310
And he's hated me ever since.

371
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:08,112
<i>He does not hate.</i>

372
00:29:08,145 --> 00:29:12,049
He only loves and is loved.

373
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:14,285
That's because he leads with fear.

374
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:17,155
How can you be so sure it's just a myth?

375
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,190
It's been handed down from mouth to mouth

376
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:22,026
through generation to generation.

377
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:25,463
<i>It's born of the occult.
It was invented by man.</i>

378
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:27,231
Man is fallible.

379
00:29:27,264 --> 00:29:30,268
The Devil exists. Does he not?

380
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:20,185
Hey there.

381
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:33,531
You okay?

382
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:35,200
It's okay.

383
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,237
I'm gonna let you go.

384
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,619
Rebekah?

385
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:32,924
I finished my chores.
May I go pick up some yarn?

386
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,559
You're dressed so nicely.

387
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:38,162
Thank you.

388
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:39,669
All to run errands for yarn?

389
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,502
Very well.

390
00:32:00,617 --> 00:32:01,686
Hi, Sarah.

391
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:06,658
Hi, Mr. Maker.

392
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,142
<i>Hey.</i>

393
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:27,378
Hi.

394
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:28,379
Hi.

395
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:29,580
You look pretty.

396
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,387
What is it?

397
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,723
Just everything.

398
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,359
Hey...

399
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,393
hey, it's okay.

400
00:32:47,364 --> 00:32:50,601
My father always sides with her.

401
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:53,671
Rebekah thinks I'm the Devil.

402
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,210
No, really, she thinks I'm the Devil.

403
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:03,347
You know that whole story
is totally ridiculous, right?

404
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,484
I mean, the Devil?

405
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:09,988
It's just crazy talk.

406
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:17,228
And I hate to say it, but I don't know

407
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,463
what kind of mother would talk
about her daughter like that.

408
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:20,698
She's not my mother.

409
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,370
She died when I was five.

410
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,475
I knew we had something in common.

411
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:35,380
I was seven.

412
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:47,825
You have the hands of a worker.

413
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:50,294
Some dirt under the nails, that's good.

414
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:51,729
Thanks, but it's grease, actually,

415
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:53,868
from the gas station where I work on Oak.

416
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:57,502
That's still work.

417
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,653
Sarah!

418
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,527
I found Abby and Hannah.

419
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,728
They've been murdered.

420
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:02,800
Father, she found Abby and Hannah!

421
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,469
<i>They're dead!</i>

422
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,109
Forgive me, Sarah.

423
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:24,755
<i>- The Lord in whom we trust.</i>
- Bless your soul, child.

424
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:28,159
Praise be to the Lord in whom we trust.

425
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:31,462
Praise be to the Lord in whom we trust.

426
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:39,837
I know it is hard to see
and even harder to accept.

427
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:44,909
<i>Our children have been violated.</i>

428
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:49,680
I stand before you in
great pain and anguish.

429
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:55,419
We must also mourn the
loss of Tobias Maker.

430
00:35:55,452 --> 00:36:00,524
He gave his life to protect his daughter.

431
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:01,792
At your command.

432
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:07,865
I commanded him nothing, Jacob Brown.

433
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:14,672
At least take your own
responsibility in this matter.

434
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,641
He knew that his sacrifice

435
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:19,674
could give deliverance to his daughter.

436
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:25,816
Sarah Maker, Ruth Warren, Mary Brown,

437
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:27,618
stand before the community!

438
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:36,761
You tell him, Mary.

439
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,576
Tell me, children.

440
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:55,913
Were you with Abigail Beecher

441
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:59,883
on the last night she
was seen in this world?

442
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:01,586
<i>Where did you go?</i>

443
00:37:05,822 --> 00:37:08,826
- Speak!
- We were taken to a party.

444
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:14,031
There was drunkenness
and lewdness and blasphemy.

445
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:16,867
These girls have broken the covenant.

446
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,638
<i>They caroused with temptation!</i>

447
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,974
<i>From now on, they must be within sight</i>

448
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:27,011
<i>of another member of the
flock at all times.</i>

449
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:31,749
And there will be no further
contact with the outside.

450
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,918
No exceptions!

451
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:47,798
<i>And those who work evil.</i>

452
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:50,601
<i>For blessed are the dead
who die unto the Lord,</i>

453
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:52,569
<i>for they will see the kingdom of Heaven.</i>

454
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:55,773
<i>Let the Lord descend upon me
and deliver me from my enemies.</i>

455
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,641
Lord, strengthen me and protect me

456
00:37:57,674 --> 00:37:59,610
from those who rise up against me.

457
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:01,011
Lord, cast out my enemy

458
00:38:01,044 --> 00:38:03,714
<i>and deliver me from those who work evil.</i>

459
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:13,057
It's in you!

460
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,592
Mother!

461
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:18,629
It's in you.

462
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:43,821
- Ruth.
- Oh, God, Mary.

463
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,757
What happened? Are you okay?

464
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:50,127
My mother last night,
she was trying to kill me.

465
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,663
Spare my daughter!

466
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:53,964
This is the only remedy!

467
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:55,933
Mother?

468
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:58,569
Mother, no! Mother!

469
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,037
No! Mother!

470
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:19,857
<i>Mary Brown?</i>

471
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,592
It's time for your examination.

472
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:37,141
<i>Daughter of Christ,</i>

473
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:40,611
have you cast your eyes upon the abyss,

474
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,112
the land of bedlam,

475
00:39:42,145 --> 00:39:44,848
where Lucifer sits upon his dark throne?

476
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:46,150
No, never.

477
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:47,751
Have you felt yearnings

478
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:50,888
that were beyond the
measure of your control?

479
00:39:52,756 --> 00:39:54,024
Elder...

480
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:56,693
You know of what I speak.

481
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:58,829
Have you felt these stirrings?

482
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,766
Answer me, child,

483
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:05,736
or you will find yourself
shunned like your mother.

484
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:08,406
Shunned?

485
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,846
<i>Rise, child.</i>

486
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:25,656
Lower your dress.

487
00:40:27,924 --> 00:40:29,893
<i>Put modesty aside.</i>

488
00:40:29,926 --> 00:40:32,663
You must be examined for signs
of the Drommelkind.

489
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:49,647
All of it.

490
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:07,965
Take this glass of water.

491
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,833
Hold it.

492
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:12,102
And do not spill even the merest drop.

493
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:23,180
Our bodies are the receptacles
of our eternal souls.

494
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:29,920
So it is there that the Devil will hide.

495
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:37,861
Do not be alarmed if you feel...

496
00:41:37,894 --> 00:41:39,063
discomfort.

497
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,010
Slow down, Mary.

498
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:28,812
I have to find my father.

499
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:30,180
Elder Beacon said my mother was shunned.

500
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:32,316
- He should be shunned!
- Ruth.

501
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,118
He found no signs of the
Devil on any of us.

502
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:37,354
Sarah, he wasn't looking for the Devil.

503
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:39,222
Yes, he was. He was testing our humility.

504
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:41,058
Oh, is that what he was doing?

505
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,926
Our birthday approaches, Ruth.

506
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:45,329
We must let him help us,
no matter how queer it seems.

507
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,197
Queer?

508
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,166
You call what he did in there queer?

509
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,834
If we hadn't dropped the glass of water,

510
00:42:50,867 --> 00:42:52,235
he would know our modesty had been breached

511
00:42:52,268 --> 00:42:54,004
and we had laid down with Lucifer.

512
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:56,006
He's a lech using this as an excuse

513
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,608
to touch our bodies.

514
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,910
This is not the first
exam for either of us.

515
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:01,011
No, Ruth, no.

516
00:43:01,044 --> 00:43:03,180
- Open your eyes!
- Ruth.

517
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:06,950
He has this entire community
quivering with fear

518
00:43:06,983 --> 00:43:09,820
so he can do exactly as he pleases.

519
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,922
- Stop it.
- Sarah...

520
00:43:11,955 --> 00:43:14,024
Abby and Hannah are dead.

521
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:20,097
You know what Abby told me
the day before she died?

522
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,266
He threatened her life when
she refused his perversions.

523
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:25,636
He killed Abby to keep her silent,

524
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:26,670
and I believe he did the same to Hannah!

525
00:43:26,703 --> 00:43:28,372
No. No!

526
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:29,673
Sarah!

527
00:43:29,706 --> 00:43:32,009
Let her go. She's hopeless.

528
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,977
We have to stop him, Mary.

529
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,648
And you need to be quiet.
Be sensible, Ruth.

530
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,576
You'll get us into even more trouble.

531
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,026
I want to know the truth.

532
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,265
What about?

533
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:57,034
My mother.

534
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,003
Elder Beacon said she was shunned.

535
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:02,306
Do not lie to me!

536
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:15,218
It's true.

537
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:16,687
Why?

538
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,088
That's not important now.

539
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:19,990
It is to me. Tell me.

540
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:22,092
<i>She summoned the Devil.</i>

541
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:23,326
Rebekah.

542
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,062
She invited the Devil into the commune

543
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,130
hoping to sway the prophecy.

544
00:44:27,163 --> 00:44:28,699
That is why she was shunned.

545
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,301
This is between me and my daughter.

546
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:34,304
<i>Would you leave us, please?</i>

547
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:35,673
Now.

548
00:44:43,046 --> 00:44:45,149
She never died, did she?

549
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,087
You have to understand
that in our community,

550
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,055
shunning is akin to death.

551
00:44:52,088 --> 00:44:53,090
Where is she?!

552
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:58,395
She stayed right in Greenville.

553
00:44:58,428 --> 00:45:02,199
You let me believe all these
years that she was dead!

554
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,401
- Mary, please...
- Stay away from me!

555
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:23,120
Come now. Go in. Go.

556
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,955
<i>What could they want?</i>

557
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,024
<i>Why are they here?</i>

558
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,462
Mary!

559
00:45:32,495 --> 00:45:34,364
Mary...

560
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:38,201
Listen, they found blood
near where we had the party.

561
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:40,337
Okay? A lot of it.

562
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,405
This is my dad. You can talk to him.

563
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:46,043
Mary, please, anything.
Frank is like a son to me.

564
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:50,313
After I came...

565
00:45:50,346 --> 00:45:51,815
How can I help you, Sheriff?

566
00:45:51,848 --> 00:45:54,084
The young lady can answer for herself.

567
00:45:54,117 --> 00:45:55,419
Answer what, exactly?

568
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:03,493
You're as gracious as ever, Eli.

569
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:07,430
You come here unannounced and uninvited.

570
00:46:07,463 --> 00:46:10,133
I'll remind you I don't need an invitation.

571
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:12,536
Piece of property is right
in the middle of my county.

572
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:16,173
Now I got a boy missing, and I understand

573
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,408
that you've got two girls missing as well.

574
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:21,077
I'm sorry for your loss, Sheriff,

575
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,313
but my girls are accounted for,

576
00:46:23,346 --> 00:46:26,449
and unless you come here with
evidence that they are related,

577
00:46:26,482 --> 00:46:28,351
I don't see how we can be of assistance.

578
00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:30,487
See, here's what I don't get, Eli...

579
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,089
you live this wonderfully wholesome life

580
00:46:33,122 --> 00:46:35,192
in the service of God.

581
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:38,295
So why wouldn't you want
to be of assistance?

582
00:46:40,396 --> 00:46:43,466
The fact is, boy,
I'd hate to see how a couple of murders

583
00:46:43,499 --> 00:46:47,170
could impact people running
to buy your jams and quilts.

584
00:46:47,203 --> 00:46:50,274
So let me ask my questions,
I'll be on my way.

585
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:54,144
Mary? Mary!

586
00:47:00,216 --> 00:47:03,420
If you wish to question our community

587
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:07,190
or enter our private property,

588
00:47:07,223 --> 00:47:11,294
I'm sure your courts will
give you the proper permission.

589
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:14,497
Then I'll be back with a warrant, Eli.

590
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,033
You can count on it.

591
00:47:20,303 --> 00:47:21,405
<i>Trevor!</i>

592
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:39,522
Stop! He's a liar!

593
00:47:39,555 --> 00:47:42,559
He's a molester! Stop! Stop! Come back!

594
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:45,629
Please! Stop! Let me go!

595
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,598
Stop, please, come back!

596
00:47:53,469 --> 00:47:56,673
For turning her back on
the holy city of New Bethlehem,

597
00:47:56,706 --> 00:47:59,509
<i>for attempting to bring
lies into our midst,</i>

598
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:04,147
<i>from this moment forth,
Ruth Warren shall be shunned</i>

599
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,548
- by the children of the light.
- No.

600
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:08,351
<i>Your very family will consider you dead.</i>

601
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:11,187
<i>You shall not be spoken to.
You shall not be seen.</i>

602
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,431
You shall not be heard.

603
00:48:16,726 --> 00:48:19,296
<i>You killed them both, didn't you?!</i>

604
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:24,167
You killed them both! You're a liar!

605
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,704
Ruth Warren, in the name of God the Father

606
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:31,174
and his son Jesus, you are renounced

607
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:33,443
<i>by the holy city of New Bethlehem.</i>

608
00:48:33,476 --> 00:48:35,445
- <i> You are shunned!</i>
- No!

609
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:37,180
Shunned! Shunned!

610
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:39,549
Father, help me! Father, please!

611
00:48:39,582 --> 00:48:41,284
<i>He's a liar!</i>

612
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:43,219
He violated Abby and Hannah!

613
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:46,189
He's a liar! He's a liar!

614
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:57,467
The punishment for giving
shelter to the shunned

615
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,502
<i>shall be eternal banishment</i>

616
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:02,339
from the heavenly womb of New Bethlehem.

617
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,741
<i>This is the word of the elders.</i>

618
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:06,510
This is the word of God!

619
00:49:25,795 --> 00:49:28,365
Trevor, I'm out of here, man.

620
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:29,666
See you, Pete.

621
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,439
Trevor?

622
00:49:36,806 --> 00:49:38,641
Mary.

623
00:49:38,674 --> 00:49:40,510
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

624
00:49:40,543 --> 00:49:42,446
What's going on?

625
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:56,326
Hey, Mary...

626
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:57,527
you're safe, okay?

627
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,399
How am I going to find Ruth?

628
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,267
I got a couple ideas.

629
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,668
She wouldn't be the first shunned communer

630
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:08,338
to walk into town with no place to go.

631
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:31,361
Are you okay?

632
00:50:31,394 --> 00:50:33,830
Yeah.

633
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:36,466
<i>Trevor's gonna help us.</i>

634
00:50:36,499 --> 00:50:39,803
He knows where my mother lives.

635
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,638
- Hi.
- Hey.

636
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,522
I'll be here.

637
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:00,791
Thanks, Trevor.

638
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,309
Hi.

639
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,549
Mary.

640
00:51:28,484 --> 00:51:30,353
- This is Ruth.
- I know.

641
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:34,705
Please, come inside. Come.

642
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,743
I've been watching you all these years.

643
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:56,579
That's why I never left this town.

644
00:51:56,612 --> 00:51:59,516
I wanted to be able to see you grow up,

645
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:01,451
even if it were from afar.

646
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:04,487
And I see it in your eyes.

647
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,823
You're waking up to the charade
that's New Bethlehem.

648
00:52:06,856 --> 00:52:08,925
Why didn't you talk to me?
Why didn't you let me know?

649
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:11,394
I wanted to. I tried to take you with me.

650
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:13,863
But they... they stopped me.

651
00:52:13,896 --> 00:52:15,798
Father.

652
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:18,635
No, not your father.

653
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,570
Elder Beacon.

654
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:28,678
He's an insecure man who will lie and cheat

655
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:31,348
to keep whatever power he has
over New Bethlehem.

656
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:37,487
Even murder?

657
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,689
I wouldn't be surprised.

658
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:44,694
Does anyone know you're here?

659
00:52:44,727 --> 00:52:45,895
No.

660
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:56,439
<i>- Who is it?
- Elder Stone.</i>

661
00:53:01,877 --> 00:53:04,581
Where are they?!

662
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,449
The window.

663
00:53:06,482 --> 00:53:08,451
<i>Get out!</i>

664
00:53:08,484 --> 00:53:10,553
Where is she?

665
00:53:10,586 --> 00:53:11,955
What are you talking about?

666
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,456
You're a liar!

667
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:14,724
It's stuck.

668
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:17,860
- Mary?!
- <i> You can't do this!</i>

669
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:23,766
As long as the Lord governs my actions,
I can do no wrong.

670
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:25,702
Mary?

671
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:28,571
<i>You're only making it
more difficult on yourself.</i>

672
00:53:28,604 --> 00:53:29,973
<i>There's no one here, Eli.</i>

673
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,491
Get in.

674
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:57,533
Come in?

675
00:53:57,566 --> 00:54:01,638
Hey,
I made up a bed for you in the guest room.

676
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,674
<i>My dad's working tonight.
He won't be back till morning.</i>

677
00:54:04,707 --> 00:54:06,909
I think your friend Ruth is already asleep.

678
00:54:06,942 --> 00:54:09,579
<i>Are you feeling better?</i>

679
00:54:09,612 --> 00:54:11,514
Good.

680
00:54:11,547 --> 00:54:13,549
What are all these?

681
00:54:13,582 --> 00:54:16,052
They're from swim meets
and track and field,

682
00:54:16,085 --> 00:54:17,787
stuff like that, you know.

683
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:22,959
No, we never really had competitions.

684
00:54:22,992 --> 00:54:24,661
Right.

685
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:27,530
Commune. Stupid me.

686
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:30,667
You say that a lot, call yourself stupid.

687
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,935
You shouldn't. You're not.

688
00:54:32,968 --> 00:54:35,968
I guess when you hear something enough,
it kind of sticks.

689
00:54:40,288 --> 00:54:42,078
If you told your father everything,

690
00:54:42,111 --> 00:54:45,581
what do you think he would do?

691
00:54:45,614 --> 00:54:47,884
I think he would raid the commune.

692
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:51,054
He wants to shut it down.

693
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,689
You don't have to go back there.

694
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:56,526
You found your mother. You can... stay.

- You did what?
- I thought they'd be safer here.

704
00:55:49,578 --> 00:55:51,047
Bringing them here like this?

705
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,416
<i>I'm in the middle of an investigation.</i>

706
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:55,885
- What was I supposed to do?
- Stay away from them, that's what.

707
00:55:55,918 --> 00:55:58,603
They're witnesses, Trevor,
and I'm bringing them in.

708
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:11,634
<i>Where are they?</i>

709
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:12,836
I don't know.

710
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:17,907
Mary, I don't understand.

711
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,776
We weren't safe there.

712
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:23,646
As angry as I am at my father
and as much as I detest Rebekah,

713
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:25,681
we still have brothers and sisters here.

714
00:56:25,714 --> 00:56:27,451
And you think we'll be safe there?

715
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:45,001
Mary, I can't go back there.

716
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,170
My father will protect us.

717
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,205
He did so long ago when we were born,

718
00:56:49,238 --> 00:56:50,740
and he will do so again.

719
00:56:52,508 --> 00:56:55,077
I'll see to it.

720
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,880
Come on.

721
00:57:07,823 --> 00:57:10,960
Mary, thank goodness you're alive.

722
00:57:10,993 --> 00:57:12,228
Are you all right?

723
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:14,697
- I'm fine.
- Where were you?

724
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:17,099
It does not concern you.

725
00:57:17,132 --> 00:57:20,002
Father, for all the deceits
I may have foisted upon you,

726
00:57:20,035 --> 00:57:22,205
yours to me remains the greatest.

727
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:25,741
But I will forgive you because
the Bible tells me to do so.

728
00:57:25,774 --> 00:57:28,645
And now you shall do the same for me.

729
00:57:32,748 --> 00:57:34,784
- No.
- Mary...

730
00:57:34,817 --> 00:57:36,185
- Father...
- Get out.

731
00:57:36,218 --> 00:57:38,988
By harboring this girl,
we could all be shunned.

732
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:41,724
Ruth is my friend,
and we will not turn our backs upon her.

733
00:57:41,757 --> 00:57:43,726
You will listen to my word!

734
00:57:43,759 --> 00:57:45,261
<i>I speak for both of us!</i>

735
00:57:45,294 --> 00:57:47,096
Whenever you stand praying, forgive.

736
00:57:47,129 --> 00:57:49,532
If you have anything
against anyone, forgive,

737
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:52,101
because your Father who sits in Heaven

738
00:57:52,134 --> 00:57:53,903
forgives your transgressions.

739
00:57:53,936 --> 00:57:57,507
And if you cannot forgive,
neither will the Almighty.

740
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,244
If you're truly sworn to the Bible,

741
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:03,480
now's the time to start acting like it.

742
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:10,987
You'll stay up here for the night.

743
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,856
Make sure you don't leave the room.

744
00:58:19,995 --> 00:58:21,063
What?

745
00:58:21,096 --> 00:58:22,899
I've just never heard anybody

746
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:25,001
talk to their father the way you did.

747
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,303
Tomorrow's our 18th birthday, Ruth.

748
00:58:27,336 --> 00:58:29,272
We're not kids anymore.

749
00:58:34,176 --> 00:58:37,780
If you choose to wake with the Devil,
so be it.

750
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:39,882
But my children and I will not.

751
00:58:39,915 --> 00:58:43,019
If you utter one word
of their presence here...

752
00:58:47,856 --> 00:58:48,925
<i>Children.</i>

753
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:05,742
Ruth?

754
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:31,267
Ruth?

755
00:59:43,979 --> 00:59:45,048
Ruth.

756
01:00:09,371 --> 01:00:10,840
The barn.

757
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:40,102
Ruth, what are we doing?

758
01:00:40,135 --> 01:00:41,904
Looking for proof.

759
01:00:41,937 --> 01:00:44,240
Ruth, this is crazy.

760
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,342
I have already been shunned, Mary.

761
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:48,144
What else is there?

762
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:49,912
If I could expose him as the killer,

763
01:00:49,945 --> 01:00:52,014
my family will take me back.

764
01:00:54,116 --> 01:00:57,019
Oh, God. He's coming.

765
01:00:57,052 --> 01:00:58,921
He's coming. Let's go.

766
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,987
Don't. No, come on.

767
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,159
Come on.

768
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:24,073
Mary Brown.

769
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:29,245
The Devil still haunts your soul, child.

770
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:42,391
Ruth Warren!

771
01:02:42,424 --> 01:02:44,961
<i>The eye of God sees you!</i>

772
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:15,258
Please let me in! Father, let me in!

773
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:21,297
<i>I can't.</i>

774
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,199
Please open the door!

775
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:25,180
Please open the door, I'm begging you!

776
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:36,145
Ruth!

777
01:03:39,114 --> 01:03:41,150
I can't send you away.

778
01:03:41,183 --> 01:03:43,152
Father.

779
01:04:18,153 --> 01:04:20,523
Leave me alone!

780
01:06:46,368 --> 01:06:48,771
Mary!

781
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:50,910
<i>The day of reckoning has arrived.</i>

782
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:57,046
The Drommelkind has struck openly.

783
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,281
It is Mary Brown.

784
01:06:59,314 --> 01:07:02,551
Her birthday arrives tonight
at the stroke of midnight.

785
01:07:02,584 --> 01:07:05,654
Summon all the God-fearing to the chapel.

786
01:07:05,687 --> 01:07:08,657
<i>Elders...</i>

787
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:10,692
<i>prepare the horses.</i>

788
01:07:12,594 --> 01:07:15,764
Rebekah, what are you doing here?

789
01:07:15,797 --> 01:07:17,466
We're staying here tonight.

790
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:19,535
The children are sleeping in the loft.

791
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:21,570
Jacob and I have quarreled.

792
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:23,572
I have no time to discuss your marriage.

793
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:24,707
Now where is Mary?

794
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:29,445
Her soul is in grave danger,

795
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,847
as is yours and your children
and all of New Bethlehem.

796
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,449
I do not know.

797
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:34,583
She did not return home last night.

798
01:07:34,616 --> 01:07:36,518
You lie, I have already seen her

799
01:07:36,551 --> 01:07:38,520
with the glint of the Devil in her eye!

800
01:07:38,553 --> 01:07:42,491
Where does your allegiance truly lie?

801
01:07:42,524 --> 01:07:45,461
Where would Jacob take her?!

802
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:49,364
If he had her in his possession,
I would say Sarah Maker's.

803
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:56,338
<i>Mary!</i>

804
01:07:58,373 --> 01:07:59,508
Mary!

805
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,157
Oh, Mary.

806
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,392
Oh...

807
01:08:50,425 --> 01:08:51,693
are you all right?

808
01:08:51,726 --> 01:08:52,928
I'm afraid.

809
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:55,197
Don't worry, I'm here.

810
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:57,399
<i>Mother Maker!</i>

811
01:08:57,432 --> 01:09:00,702
Jacob Brown. You cannot be here.

812
01:09:00,735 --> 01:09:02,771
Look at her. Her seizures
are getting worse.

813
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:04,540
They've just been here looking for her.

814
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:06,441
Good, then they won't be back again,
will they?

815
01:09:06,474 --> 01:09:08,610
- But I can't...
- But nothing!

816
01:09:08,643 --> 01:09:10,746
18 years ago, I protected your daughter.

817
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,615
Now you will repay the favor.

818
01:09:21,656 --> 01:09:23,559
<i>She needs a doctor.</i>

819
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,794
I must go into town and get some help.

820
01:09:25,827 --> 01:09:27,930
I fear evil spirit's
taken this girl's soul.

821
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:29,698
- Look at her.
- <i> There are no evil spirits,</i>

822
01:09:29,731 --> 01:09:32,768
And there is no Drommelkind!
It's a fairy tale!

823
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:35,637
Now I have a daughter who
needs serious medical help.

824
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,806
I'm not going to stand
by and watch her die.

825
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:41,476
Now you, you go to the church
so as to allay suspicion.

826
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:43,745
Sarah, you stay with Mary.
I'm going for help.

827
01:09:43,778 --> 01:09:46,615
- But she needs to be purified.
- No, she needs a doctor.

828
01:09:46,648 --> 01:09:48,450
Elder Beacon would let her die.

829
01:09:48,483 --> 01:09:49,685
Now you stay with her.

830
01:09:58,727 --> 01:09:59,895
Mary...

831
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:05,968
Mary?

832
01:10:09,037 --> 01:10:11,506
Mary, can you hear me?

833
01:10:11,539 --> 01:10:14,743
I want to help you.

834
01:10:14,776 --> 01:10:16,679
You're in danger of the Dark One.

835
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:23,102
I'm going to find you the help you need.

836
01:10:49,577 --> 01:10:52,281
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

837
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,292
We must act now.

838
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:04,460
<i>Time is sh...</i>

839
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:14,770
Mary is at our house.

840
01:11:16,838 --> 01:11:18,740
Our faith has been rewarded.

841
01:11:18,773 --> 01:11:20,676
The Drommelkind has been found.

842
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:32,855
Circle the house!

843
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:39,795
As long as you stand firm,

844
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:43,766
the evil within cannot escape.

845
01:11:46,401 --> 01:11:51,073
As for the Drommelkind,
I will face it myself.

846
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:03,729
<i>Sheriff Stevens,
we've got a 911 call from New Bethlehem.</i>

847
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,939
From the abyss you came,

848
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:26,608
and to the abyss you shall return.

849
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:30,612
You shall not enter our world,
beast of Satan.

850
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,984
Praise be to the Lord in whom we trust.

851
01:12:36,017 --> 01:12:39,888
Praise be to the Lord in whom we trust.

852
01:12:39,921 --> 01:12:43,892
<i>Praise be to the Lord in whom we trust.</i>

853
01:12:43,925 --> 01:12:47,796
<i>Praise be to the Lord in whom we trust.</i>

854
01:12:47,829 --> 01:12:49,731
<i>Praise be to the Lord...</i>

855
01:12:49,764 --> 01:12:52,901
The bargain which you struck for this flesh

856
01:12:52,934 --> 01:12:55,103
is rendered null and void

857
01:12:55,136 --> 01:13:00,642
by the power vested in me by God Almighty.

858
01:13:00,675 --> 01:13:04,179
You cannot fool a soldier of Christ

859
01:13:04,212 --> 01:13:07,916
with your fair face, Drommelkind!

860
01:13:11,052 --> 01:13:13,722
Slither back into the slime

861
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:16,125
from whence you were spawned, demon!

862
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:30,939
Praise be to the Lord in whom we trust.

863
01:13:30,972 --> 01:13:35,210
Do you know why New Bethlehem follows me,
Mary?

864
01:13:35,243 --> 01:13:39,080
They follow me because they know the sound

865
01:13:39,113 --> 01:13:40,949
of their master's voice.

866
01:13:43,718 --> 01:13:47,823
The people outside are like dogs, Mary.

867
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:50,926
<i>The greatest gift you can
give another human being</i>

868
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:53,095
is the sound of their master's voice.

869
01:14:07,909 --> 01:14:08,944
Look out.

870
01:14:12,013 --> 01:14:13,248
<i>Mary!</i>

871
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:15,016
- Mary!
- Hold him!

872
01:14:15,049 --> 01:14:16,785
Mary!

873
01:14:49,217 --> 01:14:52,020
Our father who... who art in...

874
01:14:52,053 --> 01:14:54,422
Is there something you want to tell me,
child?

875
01:15:00,995 --> 01:15:03,699
Hallowed be thy name.

876
01:15:10,104 --> 01:15:11,840
Demon!

877
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:18,013
Mary.

878
01:15:23,818 --> 01:15:24,987
Come on.

879
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:33,962
You're insane.

880
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:11,967
Hi, Mary.

881
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,569
You remember me?

882
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:18,840
I know what you've been through.

883
01:16:18,873 --> 01:16:21,343
But it would really help
if you could tell me

884
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:24,179
anything you remember about what happened.

885
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:28,317
25 minutes.

886
01:16:31,419 --> 01:16:33,254
25 minutes what?

887
01:16:33,287 --> 01:16:35,156
Until I become the Drommelkind.

888
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:36,858
What?

889
01:16:36,891 --> 01:16:38,860
My birthday's at midnight.

890
01:16:38,893 --> 01:16:41,096
It's when Satan will take
possession of my soul.

891
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:42,364
No, no, no, no.

892
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:44,299
I'll become one of his soldiers.

893
01:16:44,332 --> 01:16:47,002
I'll become unimaginably powerful.

894
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:49,404
No, that's not gonna happen.

895
01:16:49,437 --> 01:16:52,107
- You have to kill me.
- Mary.

896
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,142
You have to kill me before it's too late.

897
01:16:54,175 --> 01:16:56,378
Relax, relax, okay?

898
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:57,879
Sheriff?

899
01:16:59,714 --> 01:17:00,949
I'll be right back.

900
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,839
<i>You're almost free.</i>

901
01:17:27,942 --> 01:17:30,245
Stay away from me. I'll hurt you.

902
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:31,413
No, you won't.

903
01:17:37,351 --> 01:17:40,055
You were weak, Mary.

904
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:43,425
You are sickly, plagued by your fits.

905
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:47,328
The prophecy said only one
of you six girls would live,

906
01:17:47,361 --> 01:17:50,331
only the strongest would survive.

907
01:17:50,364 --> 01:17:53,402
I prayed for God to heal you.

908
01:17:56,037 --> 01:17:58,339
He turned his back on me.

909
01:17:58,372 --> 01:18:00,108
What did you do?

910
01:18:00,141 --> 01:18:03,211
I cursed his name, renounced him.

911
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:10,218
And then I was offered
the chance to keep you alive.

912
01:18:10,251 --> 01:18:13,255
My beautiful Mary.

913
01:18:19,026 --> 01:18:21,229
You changed the prophecy.

914
01:18:21,262 --> 01:18:23,498
I made sure you were the one.

915
01:18:23,531 --> 01:18:25,233
No.

916
01:18:25,266 --> 01:18:26,735
- Yes.
- No.

917
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:28,970
I've been in service to you.

918
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:35,376
You are not gonna need my help any longer.

919
01:18:35,409 --> 01:18:38,747
You will finally be free,

920
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,883
your power complete.

921
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:43,351
No.

922
01:18:43,384 --> 01:18:45,120
No. No.

923
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:47,022
- Oh, yes, Mary.
- No.

924
01:18:53,461 --> 01:18:55,130
You have a visitor.

925
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:07,308
Hey.

926
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:09,344
Hi.

927
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:10,946
Hi.

928
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:17,185
Are you okay?

929
01:19:17,218 --> 01:19:19,420
Yeah, I'm fine.

930
01:19:19,453 --> 01:19:21,022
I missed you.

931
01:19:21,055 --> 01:19:22,290
I missed you, too.

932
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:28,429
What?

933
01:19:28,462 --> 01:19:29,798
- What is it?
- Shh.

934
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:33,168
It's almost over.

935
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:35,070
What are you talking ab...

936
01:20:02,263 --> 01:20:04,632
I guess there's some things
that don't change.

937
01:20:07,635 --> 01:20:09,838
You really are stupid.

938
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:11,006
What?

939
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:36,598
Please, sir, please, sir,

940
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:40,101
we need to begin an exodus
from New Bethlehem.
