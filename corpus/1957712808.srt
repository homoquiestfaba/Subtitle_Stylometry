thinking about it.

180
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,542

looking for God?

181

he's still an Englishman,

of the park.

I wanted to state my position

00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,667
Please, sit down.
We're quite relaxed here.

Although we do seem
to go through

356
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:21,375
rather too many
chief medical officers,

357
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,625
some are more flexible
than others.

358

Then they're replaced by someone

359
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:29,500
who wants everything
to be as taut as Aldershot.

360
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:30,833
Then they too are replaced.

361
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,375
And what's your persuasion?

362
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,417
Oh, I prefer a certain
measure of laxity.

It's a question
of what you think you need.

Am I to start? Or do you?

384

Is there anything you feel
you wish to say?

385

What I feel cannot be talked
away or soothed into silence.

Too many have died.

388
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,958
Too much has been destroyed.

389
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:56,583
There can be
an easement of pain.

390
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,875
A move towards acceptance.

391
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,500
Pain is not the only terror.

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,667
There are many more.

Can you name them?

394
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:10,667
If I could name them, they
would cease to be terrors.

of avoiding an answer.

It's supposed
to signify gallantry.

Bravery is only cowardice
in extremis.

410
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:05,917
At the root of bravery
lies terror

411
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,708
and the fear of fear.

412
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,625
But you were conspicuous
by your courage.

413
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:17,208
Why did you discard
the Military Cross?

dwindling standards

I had betrayed.

It was nothing short
of duplicity.

And yet the men
under your command

418

held you in the highest
esteem, I'm told.

888
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:53,167
Ottoline Morell popped in

889
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:54,667
and wished to be
remembered to you.

890

How was she?

891
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:59,583
Let's just say I've always
found lime green

892
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:01,208
a very unforgiving colour.

893

894
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:04,917
Poor Ottoline.

895
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:06,958
She'll go to her grave
overdressed.

896
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,458
I'm looking forward
to meeting your mother.

897
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:14,542
What?

898
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:17,667
I said I was looking forward
to meeting your mother.

899
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:21,792
All mothers, good or bad

900
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:23,333
are always fascinating.

901
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,917
I tried to set fire
to mine once,

902
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,958

01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:39,917
Oh, and I found this
for you on the floor.

907
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:41,458
Oh, it'll be from Robbie Ross.

908
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,292
Why are you so antipathetic
towards him?

909
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:48,417
Because I resent the way
that he speaks to me.

910
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,750
Like he's always
putting me in my place.

911
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,309
You know, the only problem
with knowing one's place

912
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,375
is that other people
never seem to know theirs.

913

(LAUGHS)

914
01:01:58,167 --> 01:02:00,542
He's acerbic, I grant you,
but he's never malign,

915
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:04,042
and as a friend, very steadfast.

916
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:05,625
Robbie Ross took
some considerable risk

917
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:07,625
when he publicly supported
Oscar Wilde.

918
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:09,875
He's been hounded ever since
by Lord Alfred Douglas.

919
01:02:09,917 --> 01:02:12,875
Oh, please,
Bosie was always vindictive.

920
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:14,393
Robbie should have known that
from the beginning.

921
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:16,000
He's really only got
himself to blame.

922
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:17,750
That's really unfair.

923
01:02:17,792 --> 01:02:19,208
His loyalty to Wilde
was exemplary.

924
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,792
All right, all right.
Robbie's a saint.

925
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:24,917
Now, how about
we drop the subject?

926
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:32,125
Oh, that's a very fine sword.

927
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:34,542
It was my brother's.

928
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:35,625
Hmm.

929
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:37,708

It's the first performance
of<i> Façade,</i>

934
01:02:50,042 --> 01:02:52,083
and I was supposed to go to it.

935
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:54,458
Well, where's it
being performed?

936
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,667
Some private performance
in Carlyle Square.

937

938
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:00,976
Well, even if we drove
like the wind,

939
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,167
we should never make it.

940
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:04,083
Robbie will be furious.

941
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:05,708
And so will Edith Sit well.

942
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:09,917
It's being given
to a very select audience.

943
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:11,708
I'm sure she'll understand
once you explain

944
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,292
why you weren't able
to be there.

945
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:15,292
Oh, no,
I don't think so, Mother.

946
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,167
Edith can be a very
captious woman.

947
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:18,542
She isn't a woman.

948
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:20,208
She's an animated meringue.

949
01:03:21,042 --> 01:03:22,292
And those teeth.

Don't be horrible, Ivor.

951
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,434
She suffers, I believe,
from a complaint

known as receding gums.

953
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:29,250
She's so autocratic,

954
01:03:29,292 --> 01:03:31,125
I'm surprised she gave
them permission to.

955
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:35,083
Oh, well, come along then.

Is he just another one
of your pretty boys?

No, it's deeper than that,
much deeper.

961
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:58,083
You don't like him,
do you, Mother?

962
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,792
He's amusing, but unpleasant.

963

We visited my mother
in Kent and I simply

971
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,500
lost all sense of time.

forgive me, Edith,

by my thoughtlessness.

How was the work received?

Tittered?

Tittered.

981

"It's this sort of thing

983
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,375
"that makes one glad
to be semi-conscious."

- SIEGFRIED: Hmm.

985
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:18,458

assonances and dissonances.

not merely for what
they are supposed to mean.

Great art may sometimes be
so ahead of its time, Edith,

989
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,583
that its initial reception

990
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:31,250
can be considered
a<i> succès d'estime.</i>

to think of Stravinsky.

All my life, I feel as though

1411
01:33:18,542 --> 01:33:21,625
I've been waiting
for a catastrophe to happen.

1412
01:33:21,667 --> 01:33:25,167
Well, (CHUCKLES)
that's optimism for you.

1413
01:33:25,208 --> 01:33:26,208
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1414
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:30,000
My whole future
could depend on you.

1415
01:33:31,833 --> 01:33:33,708
You must redeem
my life for me, Hester.

1416
01:33:36,125 --> 01:33:38,333
That sounds like
some sort of proposal.

1417
01:33:40,458 --> 01:33:42,750
If I was selfish enough,
I'd ask you to marry me.

1418
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:45,708
(CHUCKLES)

1419
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,917
If I were foolish enough,

1420
01:33:54,917 --> 01:33:55,917
I'd accept.

1421
01:34:03,958 --> 01:34:06,958
Oh, I look 500 years old.

1422
01:34:12,458 --> 01:34:14,417
Some say I am beautiful.

1423
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:17,208
And, as an aesthete,

1424
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:20,708
I feel that beauty is eternal.

1425
01:34:23,917 --> 01:34:28,333
We see it in the eyes
of those who love us.

1426
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,958
Although my mother thinks

1427
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,917
that my eyes
are like cold seawater.

1428
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:47,458
My buttocks and my shoulders
are very well-shaped.

1429
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:54,792
But my best feature
is the beauty of my hands.

1430
01:34:54,833 --> 01:34:58,458
Almond milk and lemon creams
are perfect for them,

1431
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:02,958
and one must never
laugh too much.

1432
01:35:04,042 --> 01:35:06,167
It coarsens one's face,

1433
01:35:06,208 --> 01:35:09,083
especially if the laughter
is gleeful.

1434
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:12,333
Stephen, how can you
be so narcissistic?

1435
01:35:12,375 --> 01:35:15,417
It is my defence against
nihilism and the vulgar.

1436
01:35:15,458 --> 01:35:17,417
You cannot conduct a life
in that way.

1437
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:18,500
Course one can.

1438
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,958
My life is my art.

1439
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,083
Yours isn't a life,
it's barely a hobby.

1440
01:35:23,125 --> 01:35:24,792
That was an ugly thing to say.

1441
01:35:24,833 --> 01:35:27,417
I know sometimes it's better
to be kind than honest,

1442
01:35:27,458 --> 01:35:29,583
but you are frittering
your life away

1443
01:35:29,625 --> 01:35:31,375
in pomades and powder.

1444
01:35:33,083 --> 01:35:34,250
And if you don't believe me,

1445
01:35:34,292 --> 01:35:36,125
ask someone with more sense
and less love.

1446
01:35:36,167 --> 01:35:38,792
You've made your antipathy
to me very obvious.

1447
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:40,667
I don't need a second opinion.

1448
01:35:42,208 --> 01:35:44,042
I'm going to Salisbury
for the weekend.

1449
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:47,250
Edith Oliver has found me

1450
01:35:47,292 --> 01:35:48,958
a cottage to rent
in Teffont Magna.

1451
01:35:51,042 --> 01:35:53,042
I thought we could
spend weekends there.

1452
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:56,667
Will you come?

1453
01:35:56,708 --> 01:35:59,042
I, too, have had an invitation.

1454
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:01,542
From whom?

1455
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:05,042
A German prince whom
I think you more than know.

1456
01:36:07,375 --> 01:36:09,292
Philip of Hesse, yes.

1457
01:36:09,333 --> 01:36:11,125
And one of
Edith Sitwell's proteges.

1458
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:15,417
A concert pianist
called Tchelitchew.

1459
01:36:15,458 --> 01:36:20,583
Very Cyrillic, very Russian
and very divine.

1460
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:23,917
And where are you going to?

1461
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:26,333
Paris first.

1462
01:36:26,375 --> 01:36:29,333
Then we'll motor down to
Bavaria so I can recuperate

1463
01:36:29,375 --> 01:36:30,375
from life.

1464
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,833
After Bavaria, they're going
to go on to Venice.

1465
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,059
Philip told me that he once

1466
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,500
tried to make love in a gondola,

1467
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:39,893
but that there wasn't
enough privacy.

1468
01:36:39,917 --> 01:36:41,417
Stability.

1469
01:36:43,458 --> 01:36:45,375
Oh.

1470
01:36:45,417 --> 01:36:48,792
So it was with you, was it?
You sly old thing.

1471
01:36:48,833 --> 01:36:51,083
This all seems very sudden.

1472
01:36:51,125 --> 01:36:52,750
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

1473
01:36:53,667 --> 01:36:56,917
But then, that's my life.

1474
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:00,875
All go.

1475
01:37:05,708 --> 01:37:09,125
Older than God, but without
any of the influence.

1476
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:31,833
(DOORBELL RINGS)

1477
01:37:38,917 --> 01:37:40,583
Am I welcome, Hester?

1478
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:45,667
Come in and see.

1479
01:37:59,167 --> 01:38:00,792
Siegfried.

1480
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:02,333
Stephen.

1481
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:07,750
How dreadful we all look.

1482
01:38:10,625 --> 01:38:13,625
But I still have
beautiful hands, I think.

1483
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:20,375
I'll make some tea.

1484
01:38:30,625 --> 01:38:33,167
I suppose you've heard
of Ivor's death.

1485
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,500
Yes.

1486
01:38:38,708 --> 01:38:42,375
They say the funeral attracted
a thousand people.

1487
01:38:44,625 --> 01:38:47,458
Probably made up mostly by
all the people he slept with.

1488
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:56,958
I still have a soft spot
for Ivor's work, though.

1489
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,625
All those tortured
princesses and lovers

1490
01:39:00,667 --> 01:39:03,542
who have no money,
but plenty of sex appeal.

1491
01:39:03,583 --> 01:39:06,208
His work was always
sentimental nonsense.

1492
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:09,708
He cheapened everything
he touched.

1493
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:12,500
I've always thought his
particular kind of mawkishness

1494
01:39:12,542 --> 01:39:14,042
was a kind of catharsis

1495
01:39:14,083 --> 01:39:18,250
for the dimmer members among us.

1496
01:39:18,292 --> 01:39:19,476
That's because
you have never known

1497
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,726
the difference between the two.

1498
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:22,750
We can't all possess
your purity of thought.

1499
01:39:22,792 --> 01:39:25,542
It isn't a question of purity,

1500
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:27,917
but of discernment.

1501
01:39:27,958 --> 01:39:31,833
And you were never very good
at discernment.

1502
01:39:34,375 --> 01:39:37,083
That was rather too acerbic.

1503
01:39:37,125 --> 01:39:40,250
Mordant would be
the more accurate word.

1504
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:48,667
Are you still very angry?

1505
01:39:49,708 --> 01:39:50,708
What do you expect?

1506
01:39:51,875 --> 01:39:52,917
You ended our relationship

1507
01:39:52,958 --> 01:39:54,583
with a letter from your doctor.

1508
01:39:56,375 --> 01:39:58,250
How was I supposed to feel?

1509
01:39:58,292 --> 01:40:00,667
Still clearly very hurt, I see.

1510
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:03,208
I had hoped that
you might have been

1511
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:04,583
a little more forgiving.

1512
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:08,417
If I had treated you the way
in which you treated me,

1513
01:40:08,458 --> 01:40:10,333
how forgiving would you be?

1514
01:40:11,875 --> 01:40:14,333
Besides,
when the parade's gone by,

1515
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:15,768
you have to have
enough sense to realize

1516
01:40:15,792 --> 01:40:17,458
that you are no longer
a part of it.

1517
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,125
I'm trying to apologize.

1518
01:40:19,167 --> 01:40:21,750
You're 30 years too late!

1519
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:28,917
Can't we still be friends?

1520
01:40:29,792 --> 01:40:30,792
OLDER SIEGFRIED: No.

1521
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:36,625
You once meant so much.
Now you mean so little.

1522
01:40:36,667 --> 01:40:38,208
- Sieg...
- Don't trivialise it

1523
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:40,833
by saying something glib.

1524
01:40:40,875 --> 01:40:42,917
Can I see you again?
In London perhaps?

1525
01:40:42,958 --> 01:40:44,292
OLDER SIEGFRIED: No!

1526
01:40:45,083 --> 01:40:46,500
I rarely go to London now.

1527
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:00,875
And how is George?

1528
01:41:02,792 --> 01:41:03,792
Young.

1529
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:06,083
Thriving.

1530
01:41:06,125 --> 01:41:07,875
He's like all children.

1531
01:41:07,917 --> 01:41:09,917
He has the worst aspects
of both his parents.

1532
01:41:11,417 --> 01:41:13,217
OLDER STEPHEN: How about
his parents' virtues?

1533
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:15,125
He's cursed with those as well.

1534
01:41:19,542 --> 01:41:22,000
I am...

1535
01:41:23,583 --> 01:41:25,708
very lonely, Siggy.

1536
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:28,125
Is it agony?

1537
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:30,708
One does hope so.

1538
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:34,208
George has an independent mind,

1539
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,875
which sometimes
shocks Siegfried.

1540
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:38,542
It isn't independence,
it's wilfulness.

1541
01:41:45,458 --> 01:41:46,917
Who's died?

1542
01:41:46,958 --> 01:41:48,750
All of us.

1543
01:41:48,792 --> 01:41:51,292
George, the pipe
was not a good idea.

1544
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:53,000
Looks as if it's smoking you.

1545
01:41:53,042 --> 01:41:54,875
Old silver tongue.

1546
01:41:54,917 --> 01:41:56,667
We could do without the smoke.

1547
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:58,580
OLDER HESTER: Tea, darling?

1548
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:00,708
No, thank you, Mother.

1549
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:06,125
Thank you for the tea.

1550
01:42:07,333 --> 01:42:08,750
George will see you out.

1551
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:14,625
- Goodbye.
- OLDER HESTER: Goodbye.

01:42:21,792 --> 01:42:23,917
- Charming as ever.
- (DOOR CLOSES)

1554
01:42:23,958 --> 01:42:25,726
But there's still malice
at the edge of his voice,

1555
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:26,750
as there always was.

1556
01:42:28,208 --> 01:42:30,292
Sometimes, Siegfried,
it's more humane

1557
01:42:30,333 --> 01:42:32,167
to be kind than to be honest.

1558
01:42:33,542 --> 01:42:36,208
He constantly goaded
my jealousy.

1559
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:38,417
It was like being killed
by degrees.

1560
01:42:40,708 --> 01:42:42,833
He once told me
he thought you were matchless.

people who really loathe us.

to dinner tonight at Mother's?</i>

She'd have invited God
if she thought He'd come.

1564
01:42:58,792 --> 01:43:00,750
I'm uncomfortable
with all that distinction.

1565
01:43:02,208 --> 01:43:03,268
I'm not at all an intellectual,

1566

Oh, please come.

might drop in for a drink.

Hmm.

Well, if you're going to get
all profound on me,

Long enough.

1601

- Yes.

- Or an orgy.
- Yes.

1608

That's probably more accurate,
but I won't go into detail.

You know how discreet I am
in these matters.

Of course not.

I took with you.

Couldn't be much worse.
May even be better.

you'll have to move out.
