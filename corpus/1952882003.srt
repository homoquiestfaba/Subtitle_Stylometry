1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:06,797
 

2
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:13,290
 

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,600
Down 'scope.

4
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:55,638
- Take it down Mr Davis.
- Aye Captain.

5
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:00,797
Helm! Ahead two thirds!
Left 25 degrees rudder!

6
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:03,697
Ahead two thirds, left
25 degrees rudder.  Aye!

7
00:01:05,257 --> 00:01:07,132


8
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,933
Make your depth at 1000 feet.

9
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:13,834


10
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:25,837
Rig for silent running. 
We're heading into soviet waters.

11
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:33,438
<i>Con Sonar, how's that give me that 
1506 boom for an air loren.</i>


12
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:38,154
Sonar Con, set fathometer to 
automatic sounding every ten seconds.

13
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:41,649
Palmer initiate bottom contour mapping.

14
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,251
Boomer, underize sonar.  
Ahab, start scanning for 
low freq prop noises.

15
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:49,652
First one to bag a Russian 
boomer gets a case of Highlight.

16
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:52,853
That beer is mine!

17
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:30,434
Con Sonar gain new broadband 
contact bearing 3-2-5.

18
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,021
Sonar Con identify contact.

19
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:36,018
Contact is unknown... 

20
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:40,619
... setting tracker 2A and 
calculating solutions.
- Con Sonar... there's nothing!

21
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:42,191
No sir, you're wrong.

22
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:44,392
<i>There's definately 
something out there!</i>

23
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,103
- Contact now bearing 2-2-5.
- What's going on Bill?

24
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:56,390
Nothing, sir.  Seaman A has 
just picked up a thermal up vent.

25
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,191
No, sir, that's' not what it was!

26
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,663
Give me a headset.

27
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:11,217
Contact now angling down.

28
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:13,951
Sonar, I'm not hearing anything.

29
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:16,753
It's not really a sound, sir.

30
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:18,627
It's more of an emptiness.

31
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:21,728
Like a hole in the water.

32
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:26,237
Give me continuous range reports
on close abort contact.

33
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,251
Aye aye, sir.

34
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:31,352
You don't even drink!

35
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:44,552
<i>Depth is 1500 feet
and rising.</i>

36
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:48,199
What is it, sir?
I didn't hear a damned thing, Doc

37
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:53,075
But what if it's one of those new yankee 
class boats intel's been chattering about?

38
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:58,262
The Reds may have solved their noise problem.

39
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,443
They may have solved their depth problems.
- Con Sonar...

40
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:07,944
... working bottom readings.

41
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,560
Close aboard, contact, still diving.

42
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:14,019
- What the hell is going on?
- It's the YKD.  
It's going into the trash.

43
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:23,315
Depth is 1700 and rising.

44
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:35,957
No, we're done.  Disengage!
Level at 1700.

45
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:38,458
Level again, 1700, aye.

46
00:04:38,473 --> 00:04:40,730
But sir, he's still down there.

47
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:44,271
I'm not driving my boat into a tunnel after an...

48
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,672
... imaginary bogie 
a seaman may have.

49
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:50,232
We'll take pictures.
And send your tape to Norton.

50
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:54,032
Maybe the spooks can figure out 
what the hell you saw.

51
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:56,971
Up Perascope.

52
00:04:58,372 --> 00:05:01,472
Swing us around to the mouth of
the trench... nice and slow!

53
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:02,472
Aye aye, Captain.

54
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:12,958
Say cheese.

55
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:32,358
All heads to the battle stations!

56
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:34,359


57
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:18,258
Boomer.

58
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:23,102
Boomer, you there, man?
Come on, get up!

59
00:06:54,557 --> 00:06:56,020
No, no!

60
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:54,324
Shit.

61
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,625
Doc

62
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:03,526
Doc

63
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:06,226
Doc!

64
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:09,227
Doc

65
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:12,346
- Call me Michelle.
- Right, sorry, Michelle.

66
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,159
They're here.

67
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,660
- Let's see if it works.
- Did you get fired?

68
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,666
I... didn't get fired.
I'm on the symbatical.

69
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:23,321
What's up with this broken boat?

70
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:27,021
The institution had some doubts 
about the validity of my research.

71
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:29,416
Because you talk to whales?

72
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:31,818
If you say it like that, 
then I do sound crazy.

73
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,185
Am I gonna get paid?

74
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:37,786
- I don't know... it depends on 
if you can get that engine fixed.
- Please.

75
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:45,586
<i>Initiating whalesong generator.</i>

76
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,630
We got birds. 
That's a good sign.

77
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,635
Alright, I got a signal.

78
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:08,336
Ok

79
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:12,024
Initiating sample HB-12-A.

80
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,825
The native call of the 
large male humpback whale.

81
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:18,976
We're using 160 decibels. 
Since the speed of sound...

82
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,877
is four times faster
under water...

83
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:24,276
We expect to attract females from
hundreds of miles away.

84
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,189
Just like me.

85
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:33,627
Actually, the other purpose of the 
whalesong generator is to warn whales 
to stay away from hazardous areas.

86
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:36,825
For example, Navy sonar, 
which is so powerful...

87
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:40,725
that it's irritating.  
It's even harmful to the whale's 
natural ability to navigate...

88
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,155
- Michelle!
- The whale's behavior is completely modified
to avoid potentially deadly situations...

89
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:42,756
Michelle!
Look.

90
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:43,957
Look.

91
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:45,159
Look.

92
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,360
Michelle, look!

93
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:47,461
Look.
Look.

94
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:50,060
- We did it.
- It worked?

95
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,495
- It works!
- We did it.

96
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:54,996
We did it.
It worked.

97
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,058
Oh, my God.
Look, look?

98
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,058
Oh, my God!
It worked! It worked!

99
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,059
OK, ok, um, um...

100
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:04,539
uh sample.
30-31-32

101
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,340
Right, right, 31... 30-31-32

102
00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:18,895
- There!  Look!  They're reacting!
- Here comes another.

103
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:20,895
They're, they're pumping.

104
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:27,997
Oh, I can't believe it.

105
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:36,172
Where they all going?

106
00:11:37,273 --> 00:11:38,473
Something must've spooked them.

107
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:40,573
Yes

108
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:45,549
Where are they going?

109
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:50,270
Turn it off.
Turn it OFF!
Turn it off!

110
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:51,271
Okay, I'm getting it.
Okay, alright.

111
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,444
There's something down there.

112
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:10,417
Maybe we should get out of here.

113
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:15,805
Oh, my God.

114
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:38,198
Dr. Michelle Herman.

115
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,615
I'm Lieutenant-Commander Starbuck, USS Pequod. 
I need you to come onboard, ma'am.

116
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:48,356
- Why?
- Everything will be explained 
once we're on our way.

117
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:52,499
No, I'm not getting on that thing.

118
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,849
I'm afraid I must insist,
ma'am.

119
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,750
Oh, okay.

120
00:12:58,851 --> 00:12:59,551
Wait.

121
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,090
- Look, ok, look.
- Captain.

122
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:03,091
I'm not the Captain,
I'm the executive officer.

123
00:13:04,306 --> 00:13:06,415
Alright, then can I speak to 
your superior?

124
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,816
Captain Ahab is not feeling well...

125
00:13:10,142 --> 00:13:13,096
but I have orders to commandeer 
your equipment and your services.

126
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,721
And what if I refuse?

127
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:18,522
Then in accordance with the 
suspension clause Article 1...

128
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:20,399
Section 9 of the 
United States Constitution...

129
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:23,807
I will order these gentlemen 
to compel you to cooperate.

130
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:28,814
Pip, call the institution and ask them...

131
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:30,115
My lawyer's name is Mihad.

132
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:32,316
I'm afraid Mr. Pippin will 
be joining us.

133
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:35,752
- Say What!
- Take the equipment below.

134
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,988
- Alright, what about my boat?
- stow it on board.

135
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:42,489
Oh, and Ma'me...

136
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:45,332
... Would you mind covering up?

137
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:49,333
We've been deployed for 5 1/2 months
and well... the men.

138
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,642
Oh, just brilliant.

139
00:13:52,544 --> 00:13:55,743
<i>All men, all men,  
Prepare to dive! Prepare to dive!</i>

140
00:13:55,744 --> 00:13:57,444
<i>Say it again! Prepare to dive!</i>

141
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:00,545
<i>All men, all men,
Prepare for diving stage!</i>

142
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:03,246
<i>Repeat, all men, all men, 
Prepare for diving stage!</i>

143
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:04,847
<i>All men stand by to dive!</i>

144
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:06,548
<i>All men stand by to dive!</i>

145
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:08,623
This is Mr. Stubb, the
chief of the boat.

146
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:12,073
- Where you want to put her, sir?
- That's a good question.

147
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:14,273
- What about the Captain's bed.
- What... what?

148
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:15,408
Good idea, Mr. Queequeg

149
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,009
About a week 
after we deployed...

150
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,010
... the captain ordered his 
mattress removed 
from his quarters.

151
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:21,011
... said it was too 
comfortable to sleep on.

152
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,701
We're storing it 
in the torpedo room.

153
00:14:22,802 --> 00:14:23,902
There's good space in there.

154
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:26,403
If you don't mind sharing it with 
6 tons of high explosives.

155
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:29,805
Chief Queequeg will escort you down
to the control room for a debrief.

156
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:31,706
This way ma'am.

157
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:35,298
Watch your head.

158
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:38,899
All men, all men, prepare to dive!

159
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,200
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

160
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,200
Welcome aboard the whale tail, folks.

161
00:14:51,301 --> 00:14:54,200
Sit right back while we 
enter whale territory.

162
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:03,582
And we'll be cruising at an 
altitude of approxiamately 0 feet.

163
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:07,189
I can already smell the blubber.

164
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:10,622
Alright now, keep an eye out there folks, 
and remember...

165
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:15,223
... it's peak mating season and 
we've got Grays and Humpbacks all up 
in these waters around here.

166
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:16,629
Now, we're gonna be heading out deep...

167
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,130
... So if it gets a little choppy, 
you all might wanna hold on.

168
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:25,772
Now you folks all got your 
cameras rolling, right?

169
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:29,474
Yeah, you probably don't know 
what the hell I'm saying, do you?

170
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:33,490
That's alright. 
I get paid just the same anyway.

171
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:41,035
Alright folks, well we're gonna slow this 
puppy on down here and just slowly shut her off.

172
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:45,561
And uh, well, here we are.
Welcome to the sweet spot 
ladies and gentlemen.

173
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:48,625
I bring my guests out here and 
I never miss. I'll tell ya.

174
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:55,476
Just keep an eye out there and as a 
matter of fact, uh, over there on  
the right, well, there you go!

175
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,580
Oh there she blows, right over there,
off the starboard bow.

176
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:03,365
That's right for you land lovers.

177
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:05,680
Take a look at that!
She is beautiful

178
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,265
Yeah, she's definately a lady.

179
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:11,158
Females are usually bigger than 
males by about 50 feet, and...

180
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:13,082
this one's definately a female.

181
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:23,563
I'll be honest with you folks: 
that is the biggest whale I've ever seen.

182
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:29,764
So she's sounded and it looks like, uh oh...
I think this is gonna be a full breach.

183
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:31,279
'Cause she's going down pretty far.

184
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:34,667
Now, I've been doing this for almost 20 years 
and I've only seen a full breach once.

185
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,776
She's under water now...
She's coming up.

186
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,091
Get your cameras ready.

187
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,531
Huh! I'm a little excited myself.

188
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:42,847
Uh, she is something else.

189
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:24,455
Eyes on your stations men.

190
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,044
Carry on Mr. Flask.
Take her to test level.

191
00:17:28,107 --> 00:17:33,940
Aye, Helm, full speed ahead.
Depth, make her 800 feet.

192
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:39,823
- What's this all about?
- Allow me to explain?

193
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,234
Two weeks ago...

194
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:45,435
a Norweigan fishing trawler 
capsized in the Chuckchi Sea.

195
00:17:45,562 --> 00:17:47,850
Five days later, 
an offshore oil rig was... 

196
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:50,361
sunk just off the coast 
of Ketchikan Alaska.

197
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,794
And just two days ago a 
merchant ship went down...

198
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,695
near port Angeles Washington.

199
00:17:55,303 --> 00:18:00,778
Eye witness reports say that all 
were attacked by an enormous whale.

200
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:03,309
Right, well that's just ridiculous...

201
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,509
because this is completely inconsistent 
with the Physeter macrocephalus.

202
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,727
- What are these lines right over there?
- That's a statimetre.

203
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:20,519
Each mill represents a meter.

204
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:22,834
But... no...

205
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:25,143
Well then how close is 
the whale in the shot here?

206
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:31,525
- 50 meters or so.
- But, then that would make it what, 400 feet?

207
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:36,768
- More like 5.
- Okay, that's, that's just not possible.

208
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:39,588
I don't know what this is,
but it's not a sperm whale.

209
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:41,297
Did we pick up the wrong scientist?

210
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:45,792
The largest known sperm whale 
is 85 feet in length.

211
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:48,893
This is 6 times the length of that and 
if you really look at it, I mean the...

212
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,904
size of the head and 
then the jaw line... 

213
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,005
see whales, they don't have 
the teeth that jot up...

214
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:55,006
So what do you think it is?

215
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:58,183
I...

216
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:02,084
I mean... there's conjecture, 
that some whale species that are... 

217
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:03,391
thought to be exstinct, but...

218
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:06,133
they may actually live 
in the lower depths of the Arctic.

219
00:19:06,534 --> 00:19:08,934
Which is why we'll need you 
and your device to track it down.

220
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:13,443
Well it's not that simple you see, 
because the whalesong generator, it has...

221
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:15,844
this specific auditory algorythm,
and I don't know the...

222
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,303
sound of this whale.

223
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:20,456
- I do.
- Captain on deck!

224
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:28,586
I have his signature and clicks, here.

225
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:37,721
- It says 1969.
- Moby Dick is older than that.

226
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:39,508
Moby dicks?

227
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:41,882
You've heard of him, Chief?

228
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:44,783
Anyone who's spent time at sea, 
has heard of Moby Dick, Captain.

229
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,607
It's a particularly 
large and vicious whale -

230
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,308
his hide covered 
with thousands of scars and...

231
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:54,909
... corkscrewed remains 
of countless harpoons.

232
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,854
Most Sailors swear 
that Moby Dick is both...

233
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,755
omnipresent and immortal.

234
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:02,748
Of course, most of those 
sailors are usually drunk.

235
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:05,521
Moby Dick is real.

236
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,220
I've seen him with my own eyes.

237
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:12,036
It was Moby Dick who 
took my leg in '69.

238
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:16,237
And it's Moby Dick 
who I mean to find now!

239
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:17,838
Oh Wait...

240
00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:21,061
You're going to take revenge on an animal?

241
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,160
I'd strike the son if it insulted me.

242
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:29,862
Wait...

243
00:20:29,988 --> 00:20:31,410
It's just a mask.

244
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:34,909
It's the thing behind 
the mask that I seek.

245
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,110
Maybe it's nothing.

246
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:39,954
But then, animal or not.

247
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:42,355
I will find it.

248
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:58,095
I read your dissertation on biomass estimation 
and echolocation, and I have been following 
your work in citations and miotics for years.

249
00:20:58,255 --> 00:21:02,190
If anyone could track 
an individual whale, it's you.

250
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,210
I won't be part of a hunting expedition.

251
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:10,140
We just want to stop the attacks.

252
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,000
Alright.

253
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,500
Here you are sir.

254
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:03,542
- Captain Enderby's here, sir.
- Thank you, Winson.

255
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:09,067
At ease, Captain.  
Have a seat.

256
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:09,968
Scotch?

257
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:13,022
09:00, sir.
Make it a small.

258
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,113
Boomer what can you tell me 
about Captain Jonah Ahab? Sir?

259
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,758
- You served with him didn't you?
- Twice.

260
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,759
Yes, I mean the second time.

261
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:28,413
I was intelligence officer when
he was skipper of the Jeroboam.

262
00:22:29,151 --> 00:22:32,288
- Good CO?
- It was a long time ago, sir.

263
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:33,389
What's this about?

264
00:22:34,593 --> 00:22:36,653
You know Ahab 
Captains the Pequod now?

265
00:22:37,154 --> 00:22:38,854
New modified Virginia class.

266
00:22:39,117 --> 00:22:41,215
Modified by Ahab himself.

267
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,823
The most advanced boat in the fleet.

268
00:22:43,924 --> 00:22:45,724
Next generation
weapon system.

269
00:22:45,825 --> 00:22:50,025
Reinforced pressure hold.  Top of the line 
survaillence and counter-survaillence equipment.

270
00:22:50,224 --> 00:22:51,324
What's the problem, sir?

271
00:22:54,236 --> 00:22:57,840
Ahab missed his last 
radio check-in 7 days ago.

272
00:22:58,441 --> 00:23:00,241
That's not unusual for a fast attack.

273
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:02,042
He could be tracking an enemy sub.

274
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:07,317
Navpak set, picked him up when 
he surfaced twice in the last week:

275
00:23:07,418 --> 00:23:08,718
once off the coast of Alaska,

276
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,862
and again this morning near MBSD.

277
00:23:11,963 --> 00:23:12,563
Plus...

278
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:15,963
There've been incidents.

279
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,164
What kind of incidents.

280
00:23:21,565 --> 00:23:22,265
Sinkings...

281
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,966
A Norweigan trawler, an oil rig...

282
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:29,483
and this morning, a whale 
watching boat, off Point Mugu...

283
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:30,484
for Christ's sake.

284
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:33,622
And you think
Ahab is responsible?

285
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:38,996
- That's what I need you to find out.
- Yes sir.

286
00:23:40,205 --> 00:23:43,423
We have every ship in U.S. Pack 
home searching for the Pequod.

287
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:46,524
The USS X6 in the area
with orders to engage.

288
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,214
We can not have a sub commander...

289
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:51,416
off the reservation, with 
a boat load full of nukes.

290
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:53,820
There was a survivor
off that whale boat.

291
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:56,521
Get to the hospital, and find out 
if they have what's the cause of it.

292
00:23:58,048 --> 00:24:01,133
- Am I clear?
- Aye, Aye, sir.

293
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:04,234
Good hunting, Captain.

294
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:27,334
It's just completely jammed.

295
00:24:30,122 --> 00:24:33,026
- Give me your little tape recorder.
- That's not going to work.

296
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:36,967
- This is a micro cassette.
- Give it to me.

297
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:43,268
Okay.

298
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,482
We only need the
first ten minutes.

299
00:24:50,382 --> 00:24:52,782
Gotta learn how to do this 
with what I can only find.  

300
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,483
I'd break out one with 
only an eight track.

301
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,084
woo!

302
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:57,685
Put this here.

303
00:24:58,586 --> 00:24:59,986
And put this over there.

304
00:25:02,988 --> 00:25:03,688
And go like that.

305
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:09,509
Alright
And here you go.

306
00:25:10,232 --> 00:25:12,737
Your 1969 mix tape

307
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:18,748
You are genius.

308
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:22,783
- That's true.
- Red.

309
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,383
Keeping the depth to 60 feet.

310
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:40,284
Radio Con imploy antenna
scan on all frequencies.

311
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:42,843
Omit that!  We don't want to expose 
ourselves any longer than we have to.

312
00:25:42,944 --> 00:25:43,344
Aye, sir.

313
00:25:43,444 --> 00:25:47,266
Sir! Reading cavitations 
from an Ohio class boat.
Identifying now.

314
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:49,471
What are they doing in the area?

315
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,920
A better question is who?
Doughby, let me hear it.

316
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:02,309
It's Pollard.

317
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,310
Aye, sir.

318
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:07,810
Neurobank confirms: the 
target is the USS ESSEX.

319
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:10,347
She's 105 nautical miles south.

320
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:20,555
Report!

321
00:26:20,656 --> 00:26:23,456
Possible target, 
225 degrees north.

322
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:25,057
Is it the Pequod?

323
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,255
Can't tell, sir.

324
00:26:28,556 --> 00:26:30,456
Sonar is still trying to identify.

325
00:26:32,231 --> 00:26:34,575
- You have the target yet?
- Negative, sir.

326
00:26:40,676 --> 00:26:42,676
Switch to active sonar.

327
00:26:43,005 --> 00:26:45,682
- Sir?  Expose our position?
- Ping the son-of-a-bitch!

328
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:01,067
Sir, the ESSEX has gone to active sonar.

329
00:27:02,773 --> 00:27:05,737
I'm reading a large  biological 
mass closing in on the ESSEX.

330
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:08,538
Helm, all ahead flank!  
Intersect course on the ESSEX!

331
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,711
Aye, Captain.
All ahead flank, sir.

332
00:27:09,812 --> 00:27:12,712
Even at full speed it will take 
over 4 hours to reach that destination.

333
00:27:15,455 --> 00:27:17,389
Those men are already dead.

334
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,690
Give me continuous reports 
on the status of the ESSEX.

335
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,390
I've got echo.  
Calculating Team A.

336
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,871
Fire Control, 
flood tubes 1 and 3.

337
00:27:37,684 --> 00:27:40,437
Sir, 
this doesn't look like a sub.

338
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:42,138
It's probably 
one of Ahab's tricks.

339
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:44,069
Tubes 1 and 3 are 
flooded and equalized.

340
00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:53,987
Target is diving 9-0 degrees.

341
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:56,588
Dive 45 degrees, bubble down.

342
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:59,900
- Don't lose it.
- 45 degrees down bubble.

343
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:01,701
Aye!
Target is accelerating.

344
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:05,785
Sir, target's going out of range.

345
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:07,886
Sir, we're going to lose our shot.

346
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:09,561
Sir...

347
00:28:11,962 --> 00:28:13,263
Commence fire in tube 1.

348
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:19,127
Torpedo 1 responding and 
closing on target - 300 meters.

349
00:28:24,227 --> 00:28:24,927
Report.

350
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:27,239
200 meters and closing.

351
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,540
I've got bottom echo.  
He's heading for a sea mount.

352
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:32,133
Torpedo can't get a...
Come on!

353
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:34,134
Still no luck, sir.

354
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:45,131
- Tell me we got him.
- Negative.

355
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:46,232
Torpedo hit the sea mount.

356
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:50,646
- Sir, I don't think this is Pequod.
- What the hell is this thing?

357
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,169
What's it doing now?

358
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:54,752
It's just lying there.

359
00:28:57,053 --> 00:28:58,953
Helm, ahead two thirds!  
Close the gap!

360
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:00,253
Torpedo tube 3 is ready.

361
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,634
Setup is good for curb fire.

362
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:03,435
- Shoot!
- Fire 3.

363
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,137
Torpedo missed.
Torpedo still running.

364
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:23,477
Target is turning.

365
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:24,678
We have target alligned.

366
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,161
- Target is biological.
- That's impossible!

367
00:29:37,491 --> 00:29:38,550
It's gonna ram us!

368
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:40,550
Fire control.
Report.

369
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:41,651
Torpedo still running.

370
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:44,182
Evasive action!
All ahead flank!
Left full rudder!

371
00:29:51,912 --> 00:29:53,079
We're clear.

372
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:55,588
No we're not.

373
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:09,518
- Enderby.
- Are you at the hospital?
- Yes sir, I'm just arriving 
at the hospital now.

374
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,757
<i>Boomer listen.  It may be nothing,
but we're getting reports...

375
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:15,858
that a Marine Biologist
has disappeared in San Diego.

376
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,028
A Marine Biologist?

377
00:30:18,228 --> 00:30:22,028
We have eye witness reports that 
she's abducted by A black submarine.

378
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,835
Alright, send me what you got.

379
00:30:23,836 --> 00:30:24,836
Here comes.

380
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:43,936
How long before she was picked up?

381
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:45,937
She was in the water almost 4 hours.

382
00:30:46,692 --> 00:30:50,306
She's suffering from exposure, 
dehydration, and sunburn.

383
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:54,345
- What did she say happened?
- I don't know, she only speaks Russian.

384
00:31:13,745 --> 00:31:14,745
Hello!

385
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:21,245
My name is John.

386
00:31:24,446 --> 00:31:25,846
Would you like a drink?

387
00:31:26,847 --> 00:31:27,847
No thanks.

388
00:31:29,948 --> 00:31:31,748
Are you sure you won't like a drink?

389
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:36,048
Suit yourself.

390
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:47,253
- Can you tell me what happened?
- It attacked us...

391
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:50,418
Go ahead.

392
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,919
from under the sea.

393
00:31:56,285 --> 00:31:58,399
What did it look like?

394
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:02,649
Was the ship black?

395
00:32:07,197 --> 00:32:09,375
It was white.

396
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:38,041
I cleared the tape hiss and 
I'm applying the DNR now.

397
00:32:41,182 --> 00:32:43,514
Ok, everything is clear,
except for the source.

398
00:32:44,995 --> 00:32:46,580
Initiating playback.

399
00:32:57,954 --> 00:32:59,698
- I don't hear anything.
- shhh...

400
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:08,001
It's not a sound.
It's more like the absence of sound.

401
00:33:10,265 --> 00:33:13,502
- Like a hole in the water.
- Yes.

402
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:37,504
It's his voice.

403
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:43,121
What's that screaming?

404
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:06,221
Captain, we've reached the 
last recorded position of the ESSEX.

405
00:34:06,682 --> 00:34:08,410
Sonar what have you got?

406
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,436
No contact, sir.

407
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:20,522
- What the hell was that?
- All stop.

408
00:34:20,923 --> 00:34:22,523
Stop it, all engines.  Aye!

409
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:31,649
Activate the photonic band.

410
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,182
Give me some light!

411
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:23,699
Patch this through to the ship BITE system.

412
00:35:33,105 --> 00:35:36,816
All hands, this is your Captain.
Look at your screens.

413
00:35:44,857 --> 00:35:48,509
Look at the face of your brothers.

414
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:50,924
This could have been you.

415
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:55,025
And it still might be.

416
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:05,178
The men of the ESSEX 
were only doing their duty.

417
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:10,478
And now we must do ours.

418
00:36:16,235 --> 00:36:18,220
The thing that did this to them, is...

419
00:36:18,321 --> 00:36:21,321
the thing that we're after.

420
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:26,221
Moby Dick.

421
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,142
I have orders to find him, 
to stop him...

422
00:36:34,143 --> 00:36:35,543
before he can kill again.

423
00:36:38,501 --> 00:36:42,743
We are going to chase him, 
from here to the Atlantic.

424
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:46,343
We're going to chase him 
to hell if we have to.

425
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,320
And When we find him,
we're gonna make him pay.

426
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:52,721
He's going to feel the sting of our hate.

427
00:36:55,289 --> 00:37:00,852
And when we're done with him, he will 
spout black and roll in his own blood.

428
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:07,550
We owe this to the men of the ESSEX.
We owe this to ourselves!

429
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:15,767
And may God hunt us all, if we do 
not hunt Moby Dick to the death.

430
00:37:19,374 --> 00:37:21,929
- Are you with me, men?
- Yes!

431
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,415
- Do you feel brave?
- Yes!

432
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:48,716
Marine?

433
00:37:49,255 --> 00:37:49,801
Yes, sir!

434
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:51,702
Can I help you?

435
00:37:51,925 --> 00:37:54,856
What's your name, son?
Mace Corporal Perth.

436
00:37:55,196 --> 00:37:58,146
Mace Corporal Perth, 
I need a ride.

437
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:02,068
Do you have clearance for that?

438
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:08,331
Colonel!

439
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:11,133
Anything else I can do for you, sir?

440
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:12,734
I can use a driver.

441
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:15,735
Brian.

442
00:38:38,736 --> 00:38:39,436
There's nothing.

443
00:38:39,837 --> 00:38:40,836
Try to seduce him.

444
00:38:46,048 --> 00:38:48,297
I'm... 
I'm still not hearing anything.

445
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:53,172
There's nothing out there.

446
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:00,384
Why don't you get some rest?

447
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:03,096
- What time is it?
- About 3am.

448
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,249
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, you must have missed the sunset.

449
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,250
Come on, 
I'll show you back to your quarters.

450
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,347
Oh no worries.  
I'll just take a nap here.

451
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:25,147
Admiral...

452
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:29,224
- I have Captain Enderby...
- Boomer what the hell is going on out there?

453
00:39:29,419 --> 00:39:32,413
I don't know yet.  
I need to find Ahab. 
I have to talk to him.

454
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,765
No, it is too late
for that, Captain.

455
00:39:35,314 --> 00:39:39,037
Wall Banger picked up the thermal 
signature of an S-9-G reactor...

456
00:39:39,138 --> 00:39:41,138
a thousand miles 
east off of Honolulu.

457
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:44,039
The ESSEX was in the area 
and now she's gone missing.

458
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,690
Seano has declared Pequod an aggressor.

459
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:52,991
We do have the USS summers in the
vicinity and she has an entire 
wing searching for them now.

460
00:39:53,384 --> 00:39:56,505
I called in a favor of a first Marine.
I can be there in four hours.

461
00:39:56,906 --> 00:39:59,705
In four hours the Pequod will 
be at the bottom of the ocean.

462
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,306
- Captain Enderby?
- Yeah.

463
00:40:12,907 --> 00:40:14,307
Captain Brian Tashtego.

464
00:40:17,129 --> 00:40:19,682
Where to, Captain?
That way.

465
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:07,781
Woah!

466
00:41:08,568 --> 00:41:09,703
What's going on?

467
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:13,104
Sonar spotted a biologic 
mass 10 miles off the stern.

468
00:41:21,807 --> 00:41:24,238
Contact bearing 215 and closing.

469
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,379
Mark, contact heading and 
calculating firing solution.

470
00:41:27,387 --> 00:41:28,970
- Engines at one third!
- Sir!

471
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:31,545
We wanted to catch it Mr. Starbuck.

472
00:41:31,746 --> 00:41:33,046
Engines, one third, aye sir!

473
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:37,047
Come on.

474
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,421
Con radio, ESM is picking up 
an unidentified aircraft...

475
00:41:40,522 --> 00:41:42,722
80 nautical miles north north west and closing.

476
00:41:48,343 --> 00:41:50,683
Pequod, this is Sierra Victor 19er.
Come in.

477
00:41:51,784 --> 00:41:54,283
Pequod, if you do not respond,
we will be forced to open fire.

478
00:41:55,384 --> 00:41:56,984
Ah... he's bluffing,
he can't see us.

479
00:42:02,413 --> 00:42:04,703
We're locked on your 
position and intercepting now.

480
00:42:05,904 --> 00:42:06,504
Sir?

481
00:42:07,905 --> 00:42:09,905
50 miles to spread the target.

482
00:42:11,548 --> 00:42:12,259
Sonar, Report!

483
00:42:12,660 --> 00:04:16,460
The biological target is 5 miles 
of stern and still on intercept.

484
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:21,561
The signature's not right.

485
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:23,533
The target is 600 feet and organic.

486
00:42:23,634 --> 00:42:24,534
What else could it be.

487
00:42:24,732 --> 00:42:27,377
Helm, left full rudder, 
engine starboard ahead two-thirds.

488
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,378
Port back full.

489
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,079
Left full rudder, Aye!

490
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,080
Captain...

491
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:35,426
He took my leg.
I don't intend to give him my ass.

492
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:37,507
Sir, I'm intending to speak 
and expose our position.

493
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,275
Permission to enter grid.

494
00:42:39,876 --> 00:42:40,376
Permission granted.

495
00:42:40,677 --> 00:42:41,477
Activate perameters.

496
00:42:42,178 --> 00:42:43,278
Let's make sure he knows we're serious.

497
00:42:44,576 --> 00:42:45,376
Activating.

498
00:42:51,251 --> 00:42:51,924
They're firing at us.

499
00:42:52,825 --> 00:42:54,525
Sir, I demand an explanation!

500
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:58,308
Torpedo, this is the captain,
subrocks 1 and 2.

501
00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:04,335
- What is a subsrock?
- Basically a nuclear torpedo.

502
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:21,212
Damage Report!
I designed her, Mr. Starbuck.
The hull will hold.

503
00:43:21,313 --> 00:43:25,113
The target is still bearing 2-1-5
and 3 miles due north.

504
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:26,915
Sir, we have a lock on Moby Dick.

505
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,389
Captain it's not Moby Dick.

506
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:30,589
You may fire when ready Mr. Que.

507
00:43:31,223 --> 00:43:31,911
Fire one.

508
00:43:37,672 --> 00:43:40,665
- Incoming missile.
- Summers, this is Sierra. 
We are under attack.

509
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:51,708
Subrock aiming at target.

510
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:53,709
100 meters to target.

511
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,710
50 meters to target.

512
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,323
What the hell was that.
Nuclear detonation, sir

513
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,935
- Sonar report.
- The target is...

514
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,930
destroyed! 
I think you got Moby dick, sir.

515
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:36,813
Now bring her back around.

516
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:48,407
If you can hear me, 
congratulations, Pequod.

517
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:50,713
You nuked a school of squid.

518
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:04,433
Where there are squid, 
there are whales.

519
00:45:10,026 --> 00:45:12,601
- Prepare to launch torpedoes.
- Sir!

520
00:45:41,027 --> 00:45:42,808
Moby Dick is close.
I can feel it.

521
00:45:42,709 --> 00:45:44,109
Why were they shooting at us?

522
00:45:47,308 --> 00:45:48,263
Why were they shooting at us?

523
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:51,586
It's time to earn your keep, Doc.

524
00:45:52,287 --> 00:45:54,287
I need to see our orders, sir.

525
00:45:56,683 --> 00:45:58,368
Our orders, sir!

526
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:00,469
In accordance with Article 5
Section 1-1-5...

527
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,941
Wait, Mr. Starbuck.

528
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,661
Look at those men.

529
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:16,461
Even now, you can see that
they are still with me...

530
00:46:16,462 --> 00:46:19,763
They're still ready to hunt
Moby dick 'til the end.

531
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:23,882
Have you forgotten...  
all about the ESSEX?

532
00:46:23,983 --> 00:46:27,683
Will you let those 
men's death go unavenged?

533
00:46:27,792 --> 00:46:31,277
- But sir?
- I personally selected you.

534
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,265
There's not another man in this 
Navy that I would trust my boat to.

535
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:44,755
I can't do this without my XO.

536
00:46:53,901 --> 00:46:55,812
Mr. Starbuck you have the con.

537
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:31,611
Bring that canister over here.

538
00:47:39,883 --> 00:47:42,511
The steel was fashioned 
from the hull of the Acushnet.

539
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:47,578
Moby Dick can only be taken by 
something that has touched him.

540
00:47:48,463 --> 00:47:51,643
And this thing that's 
connected to him...

541
00:47:53,244 --> 00:47:55,044
is the thing that's 
going to kill him.

542
00:48:00,337 --> 00:48:03,737
- Admiral, did they find him?
- Oh, they found him.

543
00:48:04,438 --> 00:48:07,138
He shot down one of summers' 
seahawks with subrock.

544
00:48:07,605 --> 00:48:09,584
Sir, that doesn't make any sense.

545
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:13,685
If he wanted to shoot down 
an aircraft, why wouldn't he 
use one of his tomahawks?

546
00:48:13,817 --> 00:48:17,463
Captain, the man has stolen 
a 2. billion dollar submarine. 

547
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:18,963
You think he's 
thinking rationally?

548
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:21,669
That may be true Admiral, 
but he isn't stupid.

549
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:26,970
I'm within an hour of the 
Summer's location.  Just 
give me a chance to talk to him.

550
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:30,089
The only way that's going to 
happen, is if you get there 
before anyone else does.

551
00:48:30,497 --> 00:48:34,531
Then sir, 
give me the exact coordinates 
of that nuclear detonation.

552
00:48:38,923 --> 00:48:40,682
Would you tell me 
what's going on, sir?

553
00:48:42,483 --> 00:48:44,483
Ever hear of Moby Dick, Captain?

554
00:49:22,215 --> 00:49:23,822
It's him.
It's him.

555
00:49:25,064 --> 00:49:27,835
- I don't hear anything.
- He's less than a 
mile away bearing 1-2-5.

556
00:49:29,118 --> 00:49:32,380
- Doughby?
- There's a cruise ship, 
but that's all.

557
00:49:36,137 --> 00:49:37,609
Maintain present course...

558
00:49:42,878 --> 00:49:44,322
It's him.

559
00:49:46,223 --> 00:49:49,323
Right full rudder.  
Come around fast.  
Make your heading 1-2-5.

560
00:49:49,648 --> 00:49:52,024
Aye sir!
Right full rudder, 1-2-5.

561
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:51,878
Something just collided 
with the cruise ship.

562
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:55,278
He's coming back around.  I 
think he's going to hit again.

563
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,879
Why would a whale 
act like this?

564
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,880
Oh, why do babies 
die in their sleep?

565
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:02,581
Mr Que, status report?

566
00:51:02,914 --> 00:51:04,873
Still out of effective 
firing range, Captain.

567
00:51:05,574 --> 00:51:06,974
That ship won't stand 
another direct hit.

568
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,979
If he rams here again.
She's going down.

569
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:14,946
Pip, I want to take this 
signal and put it to output.

570
00:51:15,247 --> 00:51:16,547
Give me all the power you can.

571
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:32,005
Alright, I got it.
Go, go.

572
00:51:32,118 --> 00:51:35,105
Executing BAW-7-2.
Now.

573
00:51:43,983 --> 00:51:45,743
What the hell did you do?

574
00:51:48,183 --> 00:51:51,298
- It worked. He's turning.
- Very good Doctor.

575
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,299
Where's she heading now?

576
00:51:56,706 --> 00:51:57,773
Straight toward us.

577
00:52:01,362 --> 00:52:02,987
Mr. Que, prepare number 1.

578
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:05,888
Prepare tube 1 and  
wait for my command.

579
00:52:09,132 --> 00:52:10,756
Tube 1 ready.

580
00:52:11,517 --> 00:52:15,554
- He's 2 km and closing.
- Fedallah is ready to fire, sir.

581
00:52:15,655 --> 00:52:17,955
No, no, no, not yet. 
Not yet, Mr. Que.

582
00:52:22,256 --> 00:52:23,256
One kilometer.

583
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:27,680
He's coming straight for us.

584
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:30,096
- Captain.
- Wait.

585
00:52:30,197 --> 00:52:31,398
700 meters.

586
00:52:34,591 --> 00:52:35,997
300 meters.

587
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:40,280
- 150 meters.
- Captain, you have to swerve.

588
00:52:40,877 --> 00:52:42,853
100 meters.

589
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:46,269
50 meters.

590
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:47,889
Fire.

591
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,090
Firing.

592
00:52:58,854 --> 00:53:00,145
<i>We have flooding!

593
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:06,370
- We've lost 4 diving plates.
- Report heavy flooding to the VLS.

594
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:07,471
- What's he doing?
- He's sounding.

595
00:53:10,472 --> 00:53:11,472
Get ready for a ride.

596
00:53:12,762 --> 00:53:14,499
All hands, brace for impact.

597
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,000
All engines on hold!


598
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,900
Engines not responding.

599
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:37,701
Our depth is
1500 and lowering.

600
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,203
Sir, we have to cut loose.

601
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:45,905
Let's see how deep he can take us.

602
00:53:47,305 --> 00:53:49,105
1800 feet.

603
00:53:52,423 --> 00:53:54,705
- How deep can this ship go?
- It's classified.

604
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:56,388
How deep have you been?

605
00:53:56,489 --> 00:53:58,289
2100 feet.

606
00:53:58,489 --> 00:53:59,430
This.

607
00:54:02,358 --> 00:54:05,584
- Sir, we have to disconnect.
- 2750 feet.

608
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:12,792
- We've gone too deep.
- It will hold.

609
00:54:14,093 --> 00:54:14,993
3000 feet.

610
00:54:16,094 --> 00:54:16,994
It's higher.

611
00:54:18,846 --> 00:54:20,465
3200 feet.

612
00:54:22,466 --> 00:54:23,167
Sir...

613
00:54:24,198 --> 00:54:28,387
You are responsible for the 
lives of 130 men on this ship.

614
00:54:28,897 --> 00:54:30,306
You have to stop this.

615
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:46,608
Sir, we've lost the tether.

616
00:54:47,509 --> 00:54:48,109
Grrr!

617
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:52,210
Tell him to take us up?

618
00:54:52,997 --> 00:54:54,499
The engines still not responding, sir.

619
00:54:55,264 --> 00:54:57,540
We're at 3500 feet and lowering.

620
00:55:00,445 --> 00:55:04,284
All hands, brace for emergency pull.
Pull the tanks.  Pull them now.


621
00:55:36,728 --> 00:55:39,612
According to the data, the 
detonation was right in this area.

622
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:44,998
- See, you're heading west.
- Towards Hawaii?

623
00:55:46,494 --> 00:55:47,879
That's where he's driving.

624
00:55:49,848 --> 00:55:51,582
Who's driving who, sir?

625
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:08,868
Would you call this a normal day?

626
00:56:10,169 --> 00:56:11,169
No.

627
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,470
I see whales every day.

628
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,718
But I've never experienced 
anything like that.

629
00:56:17,676 --> 00:56:20,937
It's the whiteness of the whale
that freaks me out the most. 
You know what I mean?

630
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,257
White is for the good guys.

631
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:28,059
I have no problem
seeing the whitest woman.

632
00:56:30,728 --> 00:56:32,286
Engines are tested operational...

633
00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:33,988
But the valve plates are out of commission.

634
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:35,989
We won't be able to go much past Perascope depth.

635
00:56:36,088 --> 00:56:36,888
Thank you Chief.

636
00:56:37,756 --> 00:56:43,004
<i>Officer of the deck radio. 
Picking up a distress call from the cruise ship Rachel.  
They have personnel over board.  
They are requesting assistance.</i>

637
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,729
Report to the Rachel and tell them 
we will proceed to their location.

638
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:56,549
I don't believe it.

639
00:56:59,023 --> 00:57:01,358
- He's taunting me.
- Sir.

640
00:57:02,366 --> 00:57:04,491
Clear the deck Mr Starbuck.
We're going after him.

641
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:06,192
Captain, what about the Rachel?

642
00:57:10,675 --> 00:57:12,574
We're less than a 
hundred miles from Hawaii.  

643
00:57:12,675 --> 00:57:15,475
- Could you imagine the destruction
if that thing makes it into Pearl Harbour.
- Sir...

644
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:18,639
I will not put the security 
of the United States Navy...

645
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,839
or the safety of a quarter
million people at risk...

646
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,240
Not when I finally have 
the chance to stop it.

647
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,332
Rachel can defend for herself.

648
00:57:28,289 --> 00:57:29,764
Aye, Aye, sir.

649
00:57:30,466 --> 00:57:33,466
Then clear the deck, Mr. Starbuck.
We have a whale to catch.

650
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,079
God help us all.

651
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,080
All hands, battle stations, 

652
00:57:48,127 --> 00:57:51,129
prepare all torpedoes to 
switch to active sonar.

653
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:52,730
We're not hiding anymore, gentlemen.

654
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:55,031
Helmsman, all ahead full.

655
00:57:55,032 --> 00:57:56,932
And don't let him get away from us.

656
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:06,495
Doughby, where's he at?

657
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:09,997
Target is 100 yards
north at 25 knots, sir.

658
00:58:10,749 --> 00:58:11,898
Too close for torpedoes.

659
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:14,499
Engines two-thirds.

660
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,300
Engines two-thirds, Aye sir.

661
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,355
Give us some... a little bit of room.

662
00:58:21,756 --> 00:58:23,710
Target is maintaining 100 yards, sir.

663
00:58:24,448 --> 00:58:25,552
He knows.

664
00:58:26,254 --> 00:58:27,254
He knows.

665
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:31,008
You give this whale too much credit.

666
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:33,609
No, he's not a whale.
He's the devil himself!

667
00:58:37,908 --> 00:58:38,608
Captain.

668
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:40,109
Look at this.

669
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:43,610
There's an atoll, a narrow, open reef 
about two miles north of here.

670
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:47,637
That's Tau Pi atoll, I know it.

671
00:58:48,138 --> 00:58:49,638
We can force Moby Dick 
into the reef.

672
00:58:50,626 --> 00:58:51,989
Then capture him over here.

673
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:58,940
Helm, all ahead full.

674
00:58:59,141 --> 00:59:00,641
All ahead full, aye sir.

675
00:59:01,242 --> 00:59:02,842
Into the belly of the beast.

676
00:59:10,843 --> 00:59:11,843
Target's turning starboard.

677
00:59:14,444 --> 00:59:15,343
It's working.

678
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,392
We're approacing the atoll.

679
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:20,693
Yeah, yeah! 
Drive it into him boys!
Come on!

680
00:59:20,694 --> 00:59:22,094
- Drive it into him!
- Aye, sir.

681
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:24,796
The target is 60 north,
north, north, west, sir.

682
00:59:24,797 --> 00:59:26,597
Engines, give him 
everything you've got.

683
00:59:39,297 --> 00:59:40,097
We hit the bottom.

684
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,716
What a clever fish.

685
00:59:51,217 --> 00:59:52,917
He's led us right 
into the shallows.

686
01:00:09,227 --> 01:00:11,151
- He's going to turn around.
- He's hitting us again.

687
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:13,071
Ah!  You don't give him 
enough credit, Doctor.

688
01:00:13,171 --> 01:00:13,971
Fire torpedoes.

689
01:00:14,172 --> 01:00:15,472
Negative, tubes are blocked.

690
01:00:15,517 --> 01:00:17,540
- Two engine warning!
- Engines back full!

691
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:30,005
- There! There they are right there!
- Are you serious?!

692
01:00:31,816 --> 01:00:33,071
- Fire.
- Fire.

693
01:00:37,673 --> 01:00:39,773
Sir, who's in that plane?

694
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:45,374
Come back around.

695
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,275
Swing around!
Okay, hang on.

696
01:00:52,475 --> 01:00:53,975
The target is 100 yards from the atoll.

697
01:00:58,576 --> 01:00:59,176
50 yards.

698
01:01:03,043 --> 01:01:03,713
Pull up.

699
01:01:04,714 --> 01:01:05,414
Pull up.

700
01:01:06,215 --> 01:01:07,315
Pull up!

701
01:01:19,615 --> 01:01:20,815
<i>The Osprey is down.

702
01:01:21,516 --> 01:01:22,116
He's in.

703
01:01:22,321 --> 01:01:23,390
He went in.

704
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:27,998
Deploy a search team to see if anyone 
in the osprey survived the crash.

705
01:01:48,863 --> 01:01:50,579
Send a fire volley 
into the lagoon, sir.

706
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:52,499
No chief, we're 
going in after him.

707
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,848
Sir, the opening is only
12 feet deep.

708
01:01:55,249 --> 01:01:56,249
- We're too tall.
- Ah.

709
01:01:57,109 --> 01:01:59,749
We'll face him like 
our ancestor's did.

710
01:02:02,284 --> 01:02:03,829
Prepare the zodiacs.

711
01:02:18,129 --> 01:02:19,529
What the hell is going on now?

712
01:02:38,029 --> 01:02:38,529
Enter.

713
01:02:47,626 --> 01:02:51,137
I know you.
You're Captain Boomer.

714
01:02:52,112 --> 01:02:53,254
Ahab.

715
01:02:56,498 --> 01:02:58,075
Oh what a pair we are.

716
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,976
Arm and leg together again.

717
01:03:06,765 --> 01:03:08,840
It's time to stop, Jonah.

718
01:03:09,396 --> 01:03:11,146
Half of the Navy
is looking for you.

719
01:03:11,947 --> 01:03:14,847
And when they find you, they 
won't hesitate to destroy you.

720
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:19,239
I've waited for 
years for this day.

721
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:22,940
I built the Pequod for this one purpose.  
I won't stop now.

722
01:03:24,187 --> 01:03:28,013
I can't.
Moby Dick has seen to that.

723
01:03:28,714 --> 01:03:29,214
How?

724
01:03:30,215 --> 01:03:31,715
How, how could you ask me that?


725
01:03:31,816 --> 01:03:35,916
You of all people?
Moby Dick took just as much from you 
as he did from me?

726
01:03:38,445 --> 01:03:41,927
Have you forgotten what it was like 
to sit out on that sea ice, and ...

727
01:03:42,028 --> 01:03:45,428
watch your arm go gangerinous 
while we were waiting to be rescued?

728
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:54,339
- I haven't forgotten it.
- And months of surgery -
the years of rehabilitation...

729
01:03:56,879 --> 01:04:01,400
wondering, 
why this happened to you?

730
01:04:03,678 --> 01:04:10,633
Asking yourself, what kind of 
a God could allow such a thing?

731
01:04:12,379 --> 01:04:18,188
And then coming to the conclusion 
that he was either malicious or dirt.

732
01:04:19,509 --> 01:04:20,566
And then realizing...

733
01:04:24,266 --> 01:04:25,666
You don't know which is worse.

734
01:04:33,281 --> 01:04:36,910
Such a thing cannot 
be allowed to live.

735
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:46,750
I think Moby Dick took 
more from you, than from me.

736
01:04:49,147 --> 01:04:51,159
Killing him won't 
bring back my arm.

737
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,760
It won't bring back your leg.

738
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,778
It won't bring any of it back!

739
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:57,679
And whether you succeed or fail... 

740
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,981
how many people need to die?

741
01:05:00,782 --> 01:05:01,582
All of them.

742
01:05:03,728 --> 01:05:05,621
This whole act has been decreed.

743
01:05:09,149 --> 01:05:13,956
It's rehearsed by us a billion years 
before the oceans even rolled.

744
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,007
There's nothing I can do about it.

745
01:05:20,247 --> 01:05:25,045
I am fates, Lieutenant.
And I act under orders.

746
01:05:36,422 --> 01:05:39,664
Save your ammunition, Captain.  
You're gonna need it later.

747
01:05:57,525 --> 01:06:00,338
Mr. Starbuck, 
give us two hours, no more.

748
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:02,238
So, keep the tubes and ready.

749
01:06:02,678 --> 01:06:05,268
If I fail, or
Moby Dick tries to escape...

750
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:07,369
I want you to hit him 
with everything we've got.

751
01:06:07,575 --> 01:06:09,867
We'll hit him and the island 
all to hell.

752
01:06:10,698 --> 01:06:11,441
Aye, sir.

753
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:14,143
If I don't make it back, 
make sure this gets to the institution.

754
01:06:14,732 --> 01:06:16,039
Oh, you better come back.

755
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,840
I still need to get paid...

756
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:23,039
- Be safe.
- Good luck.

757
01:06:23,362 --> 01:06:26,960
Captain, I made this from the 
damaged valve plate, sir. 
Just as you ordered.

758
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:29,261
Careful, sir.

759
01:06:35,463 --> 01:06:38,712
Now, you say it's 
properly tempered.

760
01:06:50,846 --> 01:06:52,715
You're coming with us too?

761
01:06:54,082 --> 01:06:56,341
You know, he's completely insane.

762
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,577
How can anyone endure 
this and not be?

763
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:45,533
- Mr. Que, mine this opening team.
- Aye, sir

764
01:07:53,351 --> 01:07:55,560
Be careful, these mines 
are a little unpredictable.

765
01:08:05,002 --> 01:08:08,053
- Sonar, do you have a read on target?
- Negative Con.

766
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,943
I can't see anything 
past the outer perimeter.

767
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:29,960
- Any sign of him, Stubb?
- Nothing, sir.

768
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:34,106
He must have gone to bottom.
This lagoon is deep.

769
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,713
Ahh, and now we're at the most...

770
01:08:36,814 --> 01:08:38,914
He has to breathe.
He's a damned mammal.

771
01:08:40,511 --> 01:08:41,245
Damn it.

772
01:08:43,747 --> 01:08:45,047
What you want me to do?

773
01:08:54,919 --> 01:08:56,555
They're birds.

774
01:08:57,639 --> 01:09:00,564
- What!
- The birds.

775
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:03,894
He's under you.
He's right below!

776
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,200
He's under us!

777
01:09:49,475 --> 01:09:51,098
Go, go, go, go!

778
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:56,298
We lost two zodiacs.

779
01:09:56,499 --> 01:09:57,799
The third is heading to shore.

780
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,868
Did anyone make it shore?

781
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:14,122
I don't see how anyone could survive that.

782
01:10:28,602 --> 01:10:30,306
Come on.
We're over here.

783
01:10:39,839 --> 01:10:42,502
Moby dick has 
dismasted me once again.

784
01:10:43,337 --> 01:10:44,539
But I am intact.

785
01:10:48,268 --> 01:10:49,372
How many lost...

786
01:10:49,573 --> 01:10:50,372
Stubbs?

787
01:10:51,173 --> 01:10:52,673
Sammy Johnson and Medhi were killed.

788
01:10:54,075 --> 01:10:55,175
Ensa Jogga was missing.

789
01:10:56,025 --> 01:10:59,902
Archie Anchabacher on 
the other side were good, 
along with Captain Boomer.

790
01:11:01,203 --> 01:11:03,903
We were able to keep much of 
our ammunition and firearms, sir.

791
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,432
Well, signal them to 
move about the perimeter... 

792
01:11:07,533 --> 01:11:09,033
and then we'll meet 
them in the center.

793
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:10,733
Aye sir.

794
01:11:12,863 --> 01:11:16,139
Well, it seems like we're destined to 
see this thing through together, doctor.

795
01:11:18,013 --> 01:11:20,586
What is this place?

796
01:11:21,163 --> 01:11:25,104
- Taipi with a lepre colony.
- This gets better and better.

797
01:11:26,085 --> 01:11:29,202
Hand me that cross up there 
that says Mapples on it.

798
01:11:32,772 --> 01:11:38,563
Mapples was a priest who tended to this site 
until he died of the disease himself in 1851.

799
01:11:54,964 --> 01:11:56,964
Hey!

800
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,197
You believe in omens, men?

801
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:09,566
They say a drowning thing will 
go down and rise up again, twice...

802
01:12:10,376 --> 01:12:11,802
before going down forever.

803
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,739
Moby Dick has already been down twice.

804
01:12:17,727 --> 01:12:20,066
So have you.

805
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:13,033
- Ah, this sucks!
- You rather be out there?

806
01:13:14,134 --> 01:13:15,134
Yeah, I guess you're right.

807
01:13:15,135 --> 01:13:16,335
As far as I'm concerned...

808
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:19,765
You gonna have a whale hunt, it's better 
to do it from the safety of the land.

809
01:13:27,665 --> 01:13:29,265
Hey, I see them.

810
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:32,366
Hey!

811
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:33,367
Hey!

812
01:13:34,005 --> 01:13:34,833
Stop!

813
01:13:35,815 --> 01:13:37,317
Come back!

814
01:13:54,818 --> 01:13:57,018
Get on your feet, sailor!
Come on!

815
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:09,418
Small arms fire.

816
01:14:10,119 --> 01:14:10,719
It's close.

817
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,220
Come on.

818
01:14:35,019 --> 01:14:35,919
Get down!

819
01:14:53,761 --> 01:14:57,176
- It tasks me.
- That whale tasks me.

820
01:14:57,277 --> 01:14:58,577
This is your fault!

821
01:14:58,883 --> 01:15:00,395
You're hunting it.
He's not hunting us!

822
01:15:50,434 --> 01:15:52,254
Hey, look at me!

823
01:16:14,715 --> 01:16:16,853
Don't move.

824
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:28,853
The Sh... the ship.

825
01:16:49,455 --> 01:16:50,255
Captain?

826
01:16:56,955 --> 01:16:59,255
Sir, the last zodiac
is leaving the beach.

827
01:17:37,467 --> 01:17:42,260
For heaven's sake!
I spit my last breath at you!

828
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:15,061
Sir...

829
01:18:15,417 --> 01:18:17,271
We've lost communication
with our last zodiac.

830
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,486
Sir, target is turning.

831
01:18:46,128 --> 01:18:47,720
Target is down here this way.

832
01:18:50,281 --> 01:18:52,866
Torpedo Con, 
prepare 1 through 4.

833
01:18:57,258 --> 01:19:00,163
Target is 250 yards from entrance and closing.

834
01:19:02,664 --> 01:19:03,864
200 yards.

835
01:19:13,023 --> 01:19:14,452
150 yards.

836
01:19:20,752 --> 01:19:23,949
- 100 yards sir.
- Sir!

837
01:19:24,815 --> 01:19:27,001
- Sir!
- Torpedo Con fire 1, 2, 3 and 4.

838
01:19:40,701 --> 01:19:41,701
Will the mines stop him?

839
01:19:41,802 --> 01:19:44,702
If they don't, 
the torpedoes certainly will.

840
01:19:53,002 --> 01:19:54,202
Wasted our mines, it is down.

841
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,503
We missed.

842
01:20:35,717 --> 01:20:37,330
We have to get out of here.

843
01:20:39,989 --> 01:20:41,488
You won't make it.

844
01:20:43,767 --> 01:20:45,010
Are you giving up?

845
01:20:47,466 --> 01:20:50,181
No... surrendering.

846
01:20:53,624 --> 01:20:55,395
You can't outrun a torpedo.

847
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:58,142
I can try.

848
01:21:16,046 --> 01:21:16,899
Can you read me?

849
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:18,900
Sir...

850
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,500
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
