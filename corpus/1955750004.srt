00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,042
Hey!

00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:10,244
[Glass breaks]

3
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,301
[Line unwinding]

4
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,274
You stink!

5
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,711
[Crowd cheers]

6
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:47,515
Kill him!

7
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:50,050
Ohh.

8
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:52,920
You bum!

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,722
1...

10
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,296

11
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,309
3...

12
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:19,713
Hit him!

13
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,318
Kill him!

14
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,324
Aah!

15
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,328
5...

16
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,171
6...

17
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:52,813
All right. Time's up.
You're killing him.

18
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,323
Ooh.

19
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,265
All right.

20
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,768
Ahhh.

21
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,804
Ahh. dinner.

22
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,976
Sure put up
a big fight

23
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,179
for such
a little guy.

24
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,883
Hey, don't give me
that sad look.

25
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:30,884
All right.

26
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,186
[Splash]

27
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:35,189
Don't tell any
of your friends
i did that.

28
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,791
Don't let me catch you
out here again.

29
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,760
What a sucker!

30
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,598
I see you still got
that killer instinct.

31
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,334
How'd you find me,
Burt?

32
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:49,337
I'm in the security
business now.
It's my job.

33
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:52,206
O.k., o.K., your mom
told me, all right?

34
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,208
I'm glad you're so
thrilled to see me

35
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,476
after all
these years.

36
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,811
Do you mind
if I make myself
comfortable

37
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,112
on this
filthy crate?

38
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,113
Suit yourself.

39
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,616
Look, I just
got a call

40
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,618
from a major,
major new client

41
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,555
looking for a bodyguard.
I thought of you first.

42
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:08,589
Forget it.

43
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,225
I'm not a bodyguard.
I'm a wrestler, o.K.?

44
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,660
Hey, wait, wa--

45
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,694
I am a wrestler.

46
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,929
I managed you
for 15 years.
Remember?

47
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,899
Or did you get
head-slammed
too many times?

48
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,635
Listen to me.
You'll make
some big bucks,

49
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,238
and it'll get you
out of the ring.

50
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,639
Forget it, Burt.

51
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,908
Still having
those nightmares?

52
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,245
Yeah, sometimes.

53
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:33,080
So why'd
you pick me?

54
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,783
'Cause I love you
like a son...

55
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,985
And nobody else
will work for me.

56
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,820
So what
did you do now?

57
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,256
Man, it's crazy.
You bounce a few checks,

58
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,258
and right away
you're a deadbeat.

59
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,659
Remember the time
in Reno

60
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,061
when the hotel
locked up our clothes

61
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,065
and I had to sneak
down the fire escape
in a towel?

62
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,269
Yeah! we had some
fun times then,
didn't we?

63
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,470
Nope.

64
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,607
I got a bum leg
since I took
a bullet

65
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:00,908
for some big
lunkhead.

66
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,377
Hey, wait. It was
meant for you,
wasn't it?

67
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,513
O.k.,
i owe you my life.

68
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,515
I still ain't
taking the gig.

69
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,517
Sure, you'd help
some slimy fish,

70
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,385
but the guy that
saved your life--

71
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,853
that's gratitude
for you.

72
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,087
Just forget it.

73
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,324
Let me explain
how it works.

74
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,729
Ahh.

75
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,432
Want to know my secret?

76
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:27,768
I cook it in the can.

77
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:29,737
Mmm.

78
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,873
Out of the can
and into the man.

79
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:37,144
How long's it been
since you ate?

80
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,347
Just a week.

81
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,382
Here.

82
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,686
Tell you what...

83
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:49,256
Fill in the amount
and pay me back
when you can.

84
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,459
I don't want
your damn charity.

85
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,595
I need a job,
not a handout.

86
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:58,265
If I get this gig,
I'm back in business.

87
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:01,268
One thing I still got,
my self-respect.

88
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,870
I ain't going to beg.

89
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,771
Yeah.

90
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,673
Although it always
worked before...

91
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,441
Hey, Sean, brother,
please, man.

92
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,443
Oh, man, you know
i hate that.

93
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,711
Help me. Help me.

94
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,514
Come on.
All right. All right.

95
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:15,616
I'll take the job.

96
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,719
Oh, man, this is
such an emotional moment.

97
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,655
So what else
you got to eat?

98
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,094

114
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,961
good morning,
Mr. Mason.

115
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,796
Morning, Jane.

116
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,698
Lose the gum,
thank you.

117
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,900
Uh, yes,
Mr. Mason.

118
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,901
Penny?

119
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,905
I found a typo
on page 649,

120
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,107
second paragraph,
fourth word in.

121
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,509
Frank,
where's the bodyguard?

122
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,779
He'll be here
in a second, sir,
and don't worry.

123
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,115
Security is
on full alert for any
suspicious intruders.

124
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,226
All units--
potential intruder,
main gate.

00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,563
Roger. we copy.

126
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,533
Where do you
think you're going?

127
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,469
I'm looking
for Mr. Mason.

128
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:43,437
Is that so?
Get off the bike.

129
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,305
What for?

130
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,975
Just do it,
butthead!

131
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:48,876
Forget it.

132
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:50,944
Are you deaf
or just plain stupid?

133
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,414
I've got a low tolerance
for gorillas in
rent-a-cop suits.

134
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,484
Gorillas, huh?

135
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,721
Shouldn't
have done that.

136
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,197
Aah!

137
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,965
Hey, you!

138
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:16,737
This is the bodyguard?

139
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,971
A terrible mistake, sir.

140
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,307
I'll get rid of him
immediately.

141
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,442
Wrong. he's incredible.

142
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,778
Obviously a real pro.

143
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,887
So where's
Mason's office?

144
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,491
I bet you've been
a bodyguard for a long time.

145
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,026
You don't know
how long.

146
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,930
Here, I want
to show you something.

147
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,200
Aah!

148
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,403
Got him!

149
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,773
That's our new
head of security.

150
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,374
The man who hired you.

151
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,309
Oh, uh,
see who hit you?

152
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,310
[Telephone rings]

153
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,311
You o.K.?

154
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,213
This is Alex Mason.

155
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,784
Ah, Mr. Mason.

156
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,819
You've received
my message?

157
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,788
Yeah.
now who are you?

158
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:13,260
Oh, just your
average psychotic
criminal genius.

159
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,930
I desire
your new computer chip--

160
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,666
the one for
the peacefinder.

161
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,801
I told you
it's not for sale.

162
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,770
Everything's for sale.

163
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,339
The question is only
at what price.

164
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,544
You have 24 hours
to reconsider.

165
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:34,481
And do take care
of your lovely children.

166

[Click]

167
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,685
Should we call
the police?

168
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,453
Damn right.
This man
assaulted me!

169
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,789
Quiet. no police!

170
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,857
If word gets out about
this peacefinder project,

171
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,859
we'll have
every crackpot
after us.

172
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,294
What's the peacefinder
project?

173
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,696
I'm sorry.
That's top-secret.

174
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,698
I'm putting my life
on the line.

175
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:52,299
Tell me, or I'm gone.

176
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,034
Well, nice meeting you.

177
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,268
O.k., Sean, o.K.,

178
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:59,707
but you've got to
keep this strictly
confidential.

179
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:00,941
Know anything
about chips?

00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,289
we tell you
where to go,

363
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,291
you get paid
to drive there,

364
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,692
we own the car.

365
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,628
Yep. you're
a chauffeur,
all right.

366
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,463
Now put
the hat on!

367
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,831
* don't wanna
go to school *

368
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,065
or I'll scream.

369
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:10,136
Scream all you want.
No way I'm wearing
that thing.

370
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:15,608
Aah!

371
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,211
Drop us off
on the corner.

372
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,614
Hey, this is
my old school.

373
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,418
You trying to
tell me you go
to public school?

374
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,354
Ooh, he can read!

375
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,589
Our father thinks
it builds character,

376
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:33,593
but when he finds out
you used to go here...

377
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:35,595
Hey, stop!
What are you doing?

378
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:36,996
It's hard enough
fitting in

379
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,198
without everybody
knowing we have
a rolls Royce.

380
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,600
What do you mean?

381
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,201
Alex has no friends.

382
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:43,970
Like I'm so surprised.

383
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,373
[Teacher]
class? class!

384
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:49,208
I told you
to make him leave.

385
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,143
I told you
I'm not leaving.

386
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,245
Quiet.
I'm in charge here.

387
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:57,617
If you're in charge,
how come nobody
listens to you?

388
00:21:57,617 --> 00:22:00,152
[Children laughing]

389
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,621
That's it!

390
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:04,190
Both of you
to the principal's
office.

391
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,426
Man, some things
never change.

392
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:09,095
* I don't wanna
go to school *

393
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:13,566
* there's only principals
at school *

394
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,871
hey, it's still here.

395
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,444
I said I'm not
talking to you.

396
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,953
"S-a"?

397
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:37,289
Sean...armstrong?

398
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,091
None other.

399
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,694
Thanks for not
talking to me.

400
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:46,766
Pretty fancy.
Must have took an hour.

401
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:50,269
Are you kidding?
For that kind of detail?

402
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:53,906
Try seven years
with a paper clip.

403
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:57,376
Spent a lot of time
on the bench, huh?

404
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,247
Kate Mason,
are you here again?

405
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,249
She's with me.

406
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:05,485
Oh. you.

407
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,286
Sean Armstrong,
class of '64.

408
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:11,924
Armstrong--not Sean
"king of detention"
Armstrong?

409
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:16,463
Well, it's always nice
to have alumni visit...

410
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:18,731
Run along now, Katie.

411
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,402
What a lovely child.

412
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,004
Who are you kidding?

413
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:40,487
You're supposed
to open our door.

414
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:58,471
I think we're
getting to him.

415
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:11,317
I can't believe this is
the same Sean Armstrong

416
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:12,819
I traveled
this great country with.

417
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,821
A man of strength
and courage

418
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,322
who defeated every vile,

419
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,324
vulgar opponent
he ever faced.

420
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,727
Now this fearless
giant is cowering

421
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,729
because of two little
innocent children!

422
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:24,731
You want to
spend your life

423
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:27,266
getting your brains
kicked in and
having nightmares,

424
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,535
suit yourself.

425
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:31,137
But ex-wrestlers
aren't exactly
in demand.

426
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:35,174
I mean, who else
is gonna offer you
a career?

427
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,611
Electromagnetic.

428
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,547
Radio-controlled.

429
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,487
Wanna see?

430
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,758
O.k., step back.
O.K., ready?

431
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,526
Crank up that dial.

432
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,564
Whoa!

433
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,165
You're so smart.

434
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,568
And so, so bad.

435
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,982
Hey, aren't you going
to pump some iron?

436
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,116
Later.

437
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:19,819
What's all this crud?

438
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:23,790
It's the nineties!
I'll program it.
Get on the seat.

439
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,392
What do you weigh?

440
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:27,860
293.

441
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,902
I'll get your feet.

442
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:40,139
Somehow I don't like
it when you're nice.

443
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:43,676
When haven't
we been nice?

444
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:46,145
Start pedaling
when you're ready.

445
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,816
Bye, Sean.

446
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:51,884
Have a nice workout.

447
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,152
Bye.

448
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:01,427
So what'd you
program it for?

449
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,830
Oh, just 20 minutes.

450
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,099
At 90 miles an hour!

451
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,403
Hey!

452
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,772
Somebody stop this thing!

453
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:16,643
Aah!

454
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,870
Whew!

455
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,672
Not a bad workout.

456
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:52,344
Whoo!

457
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:00,086
Better do
a light one today.

458
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,107
Boy, he's strong.

459
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,308
We can fix that.

460
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,384
I'm out of shape.

461
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,920
Ohh!

462
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,307
You know, sometimes
you're so immature.

463
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:49,228
Huh?

464
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,953
It's only low voltage.
It can't kill him.

465
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,955
Then crank it up.

466
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,891
Aah!

467
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:00,666
How was your shower?

468
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,101
Stimulating.

469
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,671
Ow!
ow!

470
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,273
Oops. sorry.

471
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:10,042
Don't you think
we've done enough?

472
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,277
Not till he leaves.

473
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:13,479
I don't think
he's going to leave.

474
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:18,417
I kind of like him.
He's not a goody-goody
like those nannies.

475
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:21,320
I got to admit,
he's one tough mother.

476
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,392
I can't take
it anymore.

477
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:27,894
Then go ahead...Quit.

478
00:30:27,894 --> 00:30:32,698
So what if people
call you a panty-waist,
a candy-ass wuss?

479
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,901
Who's going
to know I quit?

480
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:38,104
When I get through
spreading the word?
Everybody, puckerbutt.

481
00:30:38,104 --> 00:30:42,374
Congratulations, you have
made the hall of shame.

482
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:49,481
No, you got to stay
for the kids.

483
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:53,019
They'll do anything to
drive me out of here.

484
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,620
But you've lasted!

485
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,422
You can make the difference.

486
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:59,391
This family needs a change.
Maybe it's you.

487
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:00,459
You think so?

488
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,128
No, not really.

489
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:04,363
But, hey,
it's worth a shot.

490
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,733
So get tough.
Hang in there.
Suck it up.

491
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,136
I've been
sucking it up.

492
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:12,438
Here.
have some more.

493
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,942
Thanks.

494
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:20,846
Wow. imagine what he
could do to your head.

495
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:21,880
[Door closes]

496
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,983
Alex? Kate? I'm home.

497
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,751
We're in the gym, dad!

498
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,187
Wait till he
sees what we did.

499
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:31,157
Hi.

500
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:36,963
What happened?

501
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:38,764
We destroyed the bike,
wrecked the room,

502
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,166
and almost killed Sean.

503
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,168
Yeah! are you
going to punish us?

504
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:44,370
This is a new approach.

505
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,704
Well, what for?

506
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:49,208
Sean's fine,
and there's nothing here
that can't be fixed.

507
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,943
I got to make some calls.

508
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,478
What?

509
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:53,279
What?

510
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,614
Case closed.
Now excuse me.

511
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,183
Excuse me,
Mr. Mason.

512
00:31:57,183 --> 00:31:59,318
You're not going
to do anything?

513
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:01,187
No time to discuss
this, Sean.

514
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:03,622
And you wonder why
your kids are a mess.

515
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,024
You can't say that.

516
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:08,194
You don't know what it's
like raising kids alone.

517
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:10,997
I feel sorry you lost
your wife, man,

518
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:16,668
but if you can't give
these kids what they
need, get rid of them.

519
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:21,407
I guess he really
doesn't care about us.

520
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,419
[Muffled shouts]

521
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,423
O.k.

522
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:38,424
All right.

523
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:39,825
Here we go. O.K.

524
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,427
Come on, baby.

525
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,562
5...9, 8, 7.

526
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,864
Holy...

527
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:48,234
It's o.K. I'll
just clear this.

528
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:49,935
No problem.
No problema.

529
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,337
4, 5, 6, uh...

530
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:54,840
9, 8, 7.
That's the one.

531
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,642
Oh, jeez. Clear.
It's o.K.

532
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,245
Damn it! He's changed
the combination.

533
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:01,847
This is becoming
tiresome, frank.

534
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,249
I'll do it
again.

535
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,851
I'm beginning
to get a headache.

536
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:08,587
Aah, aah, ahh,
aah, aah!

537
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,189
Ow! jeez!

538
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,700
Wolfgang.

539
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,001

you going?

for you.

You weren't
straight with us.

00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,636
Yeah.

721
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:20,138
Look, if you're getting
ready for a fight,

722
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:22,574
all you need is attitude,
not muscles.

723
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:24,743
That's easy
for you to say

724
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,878
when you're the
size of a redwood.

725
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,480
Hey, I was a big kid,

726
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,750
but I got whupped
every day.

727
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,621
My old man never taught me
to take care of myself.

728
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:39,224
How'd you get them to
stop beating on you?

729
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,358
I graduated.

730
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:41,760
Oh.

731
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,529
Then this little guy Burt
taught me attitude.

732
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:46,965
And the rest is history.

733
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,371
O.k. teach me.

734
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:54,873
Please.

735
00:42:57,976 --> 00:42:59,778
Feet apart.

736
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:01,379
Weight forward.

737
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:03,649
No. try again.
You're too tight.

738
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:05,583
Remember--
loose, but ready.

739
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,385
O.k. loose,
but ready.

740
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,586
Got it.

741
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:12,057
Attaboy.

742
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:13,792
No. somebody swings,
you're dead.

743
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:15,794
Drop your hands
by your side,

744
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:17,763
relax
your shoulders.

745
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,832
I just feel
a little awkward.

746
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:23,401
I know,
but nobody else will.

747
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:25,003
Remember...

748
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:26,004
You're bad!

749
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:28,006
I'm bad.

750
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:29,007
Yeah.

751
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:29,808
I'm bad!

752
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:31,442
I'm super bad!

753
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,443
I'm badacious!

754
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,444
All right!

755
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,445
Yeah!

756
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,446
Bad!

758
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:39,785

766
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:05,643
It's just me.

767
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:09,715
I can't sleep.

768
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:11,983
Do whatever you
did last night.

769
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,185
I couldn't sleep then,
either.

770
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:22,060
You must have
slept sometime.

771
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,062
Yeah.

772
00:44:24,062 --> 00:44:25,463
Sure.

773
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:27,866
When my mommy was here...

774
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:30,535
Before she went to heaven.

775
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:32,070
Oh.

776
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,880
You know...

777
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,283
I lost my dad
when I was a kid.

778
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:48,353
But I don't think
he went to heaven.

779
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,956
You mean he went to...

780
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:55,827
Oh.

781
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:59,898
Mommy used
to sing me a song.

782
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:02,067
Could you sing it to me?

783
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:05,536
I don't know
those kind of songs.

784
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,773
I could teach it
to you.

785

00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:13,979

I'm awake.

793
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,735
Then sing.

794
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,537
I got
a terrible voice.

795
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:41,840
Sing!

796
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,141
All right.

797
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:46,344

sing my own song.

Is Harry in the limo?

[Mumbling]

812
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,790
"Harry is sick."

813
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,192
You know, that's odd.

814
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:36,794
Usually, Harry
calls me himself.

00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:41,199

00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,415
It worked.

00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,417
You have to kiss Dolly.

822
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:01,219
I don't kiss dollies.

823

You're going
to wake me up!

Don't tell anybody
i did that.

Dolly likes you.
Would you take care
of her for the night?

826
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:14,332
No way.

to kiss her, too?

835
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:48,466
What?

836
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,468
Oh, you mean for Kate.

837
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:52,170
It sure wasn't for me.

838
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:55,240
Sean, I didn't get
a chance to say goodbye,

839
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,875
so could you tell
the children I love them?

840
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,478
Why don't you tell them?

841
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:01,846
You mean right now?

842
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:03,881
You got something
more important to do?

843
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,085
Yes, as a matter
of fact, i--

844
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:10,888
no, I don't.

00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,190

Alex. I promise.

care of Dolly tonight.

good care of her.

00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,284
Hey, give me 20 bucks
for the cabbie, quick.

905
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,152
Hey.

906
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:03,020
Keep the change.

907
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,257
Gee...a whole quarter.

908
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:07,258
A quarter!

909
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:08,859
Give me that.

910
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,528
This ain't Christmas.

911
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:13,964
Ha ha!
So, who's the babe?

912
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,766
Corinne,
meet my pal Burt.

913
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:19,103
Ooh,
the dynamic duo--
wimpy and gimpy.

914
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:21,672
She's in
a good mood today.

915
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:24,509
Who's this?

916
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:26,977
Alex, Kate.
Burt Wilson.

917
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,646
Ah, the brats.

918
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,482
You're too old
for a bodyguard.

919
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,784
You're too little to have
such a big mouth.

920
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:37,388
I hope you're giving us
a golden-age discount,
gramps.

921
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:39,123
Kids,
show some respect.

922
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:40,525
Burt saved my life.

923
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:43,261
That's right.
Took a bullet right here

924
00:52:43,261 --> 00:52:45,095
for this guy,
nicked an artery.

925
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,532
You should've seen
the blood pumping out.

926
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:50,067
Kaploom! kaploom! Kaploom!
Nearly hit the ceiling.

927
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:51,802
Eww!cool!

928
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:55,005
A long time ago,
this creep named
Tommy thanatos,

929
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,408
he tried to get
me and Burt

930
00:52:57,408 --> 00:53:00,144
to rig a prestigious
sporting event.

931
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:01,379
The world
series?

932
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:04,549
Close. anyway,
me and Burt refused.

933
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:07,151
Thanatos lost
a lot of money.

934
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:08,553
And then
after the event...

935
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:10,555
Ahh. nice match, champ.

936
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:14,559
Now we can pay the hotel
and get your clothes back.

937
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,428
You sure know how
to take the glow
off winning.

938
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:21,932
I ordered you
to throw that match.

939
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:23,768
You've cost me money.

940
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:24,969
Big money!

941
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:26,437
Bigger than your hair?

942
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:28,038
We don't throw
matches.

943
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,073
That's right.

944
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:30,841
If you was soaked
in gasoline,

945
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:33,511
we might throw matches--
the flaming kind.

946
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:35,580
With that furball
on your head,

947
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,782
you'd make
one hell of a torch.

948
00:53:37,782 --> 00:53:39,784
First you defy me,

949
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:42,787
then you mock my hair?

950
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,789
You're dead!

951
00:53:46,324 --> 00:53:48,025
Look out!

952
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:50,361
Aah!

953
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,265
Get him!

954
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:58,869
Get out of my way!

955
00:53:58,869 --> 00:53:59,937
Ohh! stop!

956
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:00,938
He's mine!

957
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:17,988
I'll cut you
down to size!

958
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:25,630
Whaaa!

959
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,032
[Sean]
must have hit him
pretty hard.

960
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:31,235
He landed headfirst in
the hotel swimming pool
next door.

961
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:32,970
Must have made
a killer splash.

962
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,305
No. the pool was empty.

963
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:37,642
It would've killed him,
but his hair cushioned
the fall.

964
00:54:37,642 --> 00:54:42,112
At least he got
a metal plate
in the slammer.

965
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,115
Wow. you really did
save his life.

966
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,452
What can you
do now, pappy?

967
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:50,254
What can I do now?

968
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:51,489
Ha!

969
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,228
Hyah!

970
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,864
O.k. he'll do.

971
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,669
I'll take you
to class.

972
00:55:04,669 --> 00:55:08,072
No way. I want to see
Alex get whupped.

973
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:12,276
Alex, did Sean share
his invincible psych-out
technique with you?

974
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:13,478
Yeah.

975
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:15,079
Forget it.
Us little guys
need backup.

976
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,948
Primitive, but effective.
Like me and Sean.

977
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:20,250
Thanks, but I'm fine.

978
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,587
I know. I know.
Too bloody.

979
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:24,589
You want something
more subtle. Blackjack!

980
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:27,692
One good bop. His brain's
all over the sidewalk.

981
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:29,193
No, really.
I'm fine.

982
00:55:29,193 --> 00:55:30,995
Too messy, I know.
O.K.

983
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:34,365
How about a little mace
in the face, huh?

984
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:35,700
They'll be puking.

985
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,634
No.

986
00:55:36,634 --> 00:55:38,836
All right. Last resort.

987
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,306
Classic lead pipe.

988
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:46,644
Good for one-on-one
or as a weapon
of mass destruction.

989
00:55:46,644 --> 00:55:49,113
Thanks, Burt,
but I'm covered.

990
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:50,981
O.k. suit yourself.

991
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:02,326
Hey...richie rich
got smart.

992
00:56:02,326 --> 00:56:06,130
Figures we'll be
nicer if we don't
have to chase him.

993
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,532
Right, Alexander?
Wrong!

994
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:09,133
What?
you heard me!

995
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:10,401
No more money!

996
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:13,303
I guess we'll have to
leave you alone then.

997
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,705
No hard feelings.

998
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,241
Give me your wallet, twerp.

999
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:18,476
That's not fair.

1000
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:20,678
He's got to do it
on his own.

1001
00:56:20,678 --> 00:56:22,947
Did mommy put this
on a string

1002
00:56:22,947 --> 00:56:25,650
so Alex wouldn't
lose any more money?

1003
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,251
Don't talk
about my mother!

1004
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:28,653
What are you
going to do?

1005
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:30,755
Let's get out of here!

1006
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:01,018
The sides even
this time?

1007
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,689
Yes, sir.

1008
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,361
Excellent!

1009
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:14,098
90 seconds,
herr thanatos.

1010
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,934
Oh, all right.
Raise him.

1011
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:22,807
[Sputtering]

1012
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:35,285
Oh, I do enjoy
a good round of torture

1013
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,888
as much
as the next fellow.

1014
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:39,624
I truly do.

1015
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:42,493
But time is pressing.

1016
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:45,295
The chip, Mr. Mason,
i must have it.

1017
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:49,033
I have spent
years of my life
on that peacefinder.

1018
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:52,770
I'm not about
to turn it over
to some psycho!

1019
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:56,240
Oh, let's not engage
in name-calling.

1020
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:01,646
I am just
a businessman...
Like you.

1021
00:58:01,646 --> 00:58:04,248
My work is my life.

1022
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:06,651
Of course...

1023
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:09,554
Some days are
more satisfying
than others.

1024
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:14,058
Let's cut to the chase.

1025
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:16,861
Everyone has a price.
Name yours.

1026
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:18,195
Forget it!

1027
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:21,065
Oh, my mistake.

1028
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:23,668
I thought you were
a reasonable man.

1029
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:26,070
But no, you won't
even negotiate.

1030
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,273
So I'll name
your price.

1031
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:31,909
Alex Jr. and Kate.

1032
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:36,180
You pig! You pig!
You pig!

1033
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,582
Judging by your response,

1034
00:58:37,582 --> 00:58:40,885
I should've done this
a long time ago.

1035
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:52,897
Do you want one lump
or two?

1036
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:56,300
There's nothing in there.

1037
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,903
It's called pretend.

1038
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:02,306
Well, then,
I'll take two.

1039
00:59:09,714 --> 00:59:11,649
Now you've spilled it.

1040
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:13,317
I'm really sorry.

1041
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:15,653
I'm nothing
but a big klutz.

1042
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:18,455
Always have been.

1043
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:21,525
All the other kids
made fun of me.

1044
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:24,061
You don't have
to be that way.

1045
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,395
I could teach you.

1046
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,396
Really?

1047
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,531
Sure.

1048
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:30,635
But you got to do
everything I say.

1049
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:36,240
Try again.
Thumb and forefinger.

1050
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:45,015
And get that pinkie up!

1051
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:49,353
Well! mmm!

1052
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:51,355
Ha ha ha!

1053
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:53,357
Hey, hey.

1054
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:54,759
A little of this.

1055
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:57,027
That is an insult
to the chef.

1056
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:59,764
Maybe the chef
needs a little spice.

1057
00:59:59,764 --> 01:00:03,067
Maybe you'd like
a ketchup bottle
down your throat.

1058
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:06,336
The sexual energy
is so thick in here,

1059
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:09,139
I could cut it
with a knife.

1060
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:12,242
Maybe I'm too young
for this conversation.

1061
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:13,678
That's a smart boy.

1062
01:00:13,678 --> 01:00:16,613
Reminds me of me
when I was a kid.

1063
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,750
Except he's smart,
rich, and good-looking.

1064
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:22,586
True. but I still
got time. Huh?

1065
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:25,455
Mm-hmm.

1066
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,391
No ponytails.

1067
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:29,393
Just trust me
on this.

1068
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:38,202
You should've seen
the flames shoot out
of that sucker.

1069
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:41,806
And I used to think
all you einsteins
were weenies.

1070
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:43,407
It's fairly basic.

1071
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:44,809
Whoa!
what have we here?

1072
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:48,212
An electrified toilet seat.
Sheer brilliance.

1073
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:50,214
It's nothing. Really.

1074
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:54,218
But it does complement
the poison Ivy
toilet paper.

1075
01:00:54,218 --> 01:00:58,222
Oh, ho ho. And you say
you aren't a genius?

1076
01:00:58,222 --> 01:00:59,890
Ha ha ha.

1077
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:10,300
Why don't you guys
carry guns?

1078
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,702
I lost my license.

01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:17,641
One, obviously.

1259
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:20,544
Then why did we
pass it twice?

1260
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,315
Uhh.

1261
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,794
I'll kill you for that.

1262
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:59,115
May I borrow
your keys?

1263
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:00,316
Huh?

1264
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,918
Waah!

1265
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:04,053
Adios.

1266
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,901
Hey!

1267
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:19,503
Bingo.

1268
01:12:22,305 --> 01:12:23,740
They're coming in.

1269
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:28,878
The anticipation
is almost too much to bear.

1270
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:30,480
So is your breath.

1271
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,618
Now we know
who's the first to die.

1272
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:45,462
They should be here
by now.

1273
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:48,164
Hey! what?

1274
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:49,499
Aah!

1275
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,272
Base to scarab-1.

1276
01:12:56,272 --> 01:12:58,041
What is taking so long?

1277
01:12:58,041 --> 01:12:59,142
[Static]

1278
01:12:59,142 --> 01:13:01,778
Why do you
not answer?

1279
01:13:01,778 --> 01:13:02,812
Come in.

1280
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:05,915
[Thanatos]
i won't tolerate
ineptitude.

1281
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:08,017
Keep trying.

1282
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:10,086
Come in.

1283
01:13:10,086 --> 01:13:11,721
Come in.

1284
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,857
Ach, there must be
something wrong.

1285
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:14,858
Freeze!

1286
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:16,860
My, my,

1287
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:20,229
I expected a more
dramatic entrance

1288
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,631
from a man
who wrestled

1289
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:24,300
at the west Memphis
pork pavilion.

1290
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,235
Hey, we won
in west Memphis.

1291
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,772
But not tonight.

1292
01:13:28,772 --> 01:13:30,474
Hyah!

1293
01:13:35,445 --> 01:13:37,046
Hyah!

1294
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,992
Aah!

1295
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:52,696
Aah!

1296
01:13:56,232 --> 01:13:57,333
Hyah!

1297
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:59,135
Hurry! untie us!

1298
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,072
Just shoot
them both.

1299
01:14:05,742 --> 01:14:08,912
Grrr!

1300
01:14:08,912 --> 01:14:10,246
Grrr!

1301
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:12,882
Aah!

1302
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:22,025
Grraaahh!

1303
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:27,531
Unlike you, Armstrong,

1304
01:14:27,531 --> 01:14:29,799
I never lose.

1305
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:33,002
Ha ha ha ha!

1306
01:14:34,437 --> 01:14:38,908
Now your friends
can watch you die.

1307
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:39,709
Ugh!

1308
01:14:39,709 --> 01:14:41,711
Ah ha ha ha ha!

1309
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,948
No!

1310
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:46,916
[Kate]
save him!

1311
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:49,018
Get him, dad!
Help him!

1312
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:50,019
Dad!

1313
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:50,820
Aah!

1314
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,622
I hate you!
I hate you!

1315
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:54,624
Let him--
let him go!

1316
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:55,892
Let him go!

1317
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:00,063
Aah!

1318
01:15:04,968 --> 01:15:06,970
You shouldn't
have done that.

1319
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,471
Why not?

1320
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:11,675
'Cause you shouldn't
have hit a kid.

1321
01:15:29,826 --> 01:15:30,794
Uhh!

1322
01:15:30,794 --> 01:15:32,796
Alex, the button.

1323
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:43,807
Swine!

1324
01:15:43,807 --> 01:15:44,741
Aah!

1325
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:47,476
[Speaking German]

1326
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,278
Hang out, Wolfie, baby.

1327
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:55,752
One move, and I will
destroy the chip.

1328
01:15:55,752 --> 01:15:58,221
There's no chip in there,
dorkbrain.

1329
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,692
You lied.

1330
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:05,394
So sue me!

1331
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,495
Grrr!

1332
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,064
Alex, duck!

1333
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,237
You screwed up
my hair.

1334
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:17,140
Now it's payback time.

1335
01:16:31,655 --> 01:16:35,892
I will not be denied
my pleasure.

1336
01:16:35,892 --> 01:16:37,460
He's going
to kill him.

1337
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,461
Do something, daddy.

1338
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:39,462
A transformer!

1339
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:42,265
We can generate
electricity.

1340
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:43,933
Intense!
a superconducting
magnetic beam!

1341
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,601
Like we did to
miss Callahan?

1342
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,602
What?

1343
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,738
The nanny
with the braces.

1344
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:57,781
Hit it!

1345
01:16:59,015 --> 01:17:00,750
Aah!

1346
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,021
[Crowd cheers]

1347
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:07,290
Uhh!

1348
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:12,295
Now you die.

1349
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:18,367
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1350
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:19,703
No more.

1351
01:17:19,703 --> 01:17:21,504
It's not working,
dad!

1352
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:23,740
We need a conductor!

1353
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:26,776
Come on, son,
hurry!

1354
01:17:26,776 --> 01:17:28,244
Quick! quick!
Quick!

1355
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:29,846
Grab that end!

1356
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,254
Need a hand?

1357
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:45,328
O.k., lift it up.

1358
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:49,065
Grrr!

1359
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:50,366
Grrr!

1360
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:52,335
Hit the deck!

1361
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:56,339
Aah!

1362
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,741
Whoa!

1363
01:17:57,741 --> 01:17:58,742
Whoa!

1364
01:17:58,742 --> 01:17:59,776
Whoa!

1365
01:17:59,776 --> 01:18:01,778
Whoa! whoa!

1366
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:03,379
Stop this thing!

1367
01:18:03,379 --> 01:18:04,380
Whoa!

1368
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,783
This beats
the 4th of July.

1369
01:18:06,783 --> 01:18:08,251
He's toast.

1370
01:18:08,251 --> 01:18:09,753
Aah!

1371
01:18:09,753 --> 01:18:11,721
Aah! aah! Aah!

1372
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:16,726
Aah! aah! Aah!

1373
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:20,129
[Kate]
wow!

1374
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:28,104
Man really
blew his top.

1375
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:30,807
So where's
the stupid chip?

1376
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:32,408
Kate has it.

1377
01:18:32,408 --> 01:18:33,409
Do not.

1378
01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:34,811
Yes, you do, honey,

1379
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:36,913
right here
in your Dolly.

1380
01:18:42,185 --> 01:18:43,619
Sure about this?

1381
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:45,889
I don't need her
anymore.

1382
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:50,827
You're a brave man.

1383
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:52,228
You're the brave one.

1384
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:56,332
Raising kids is
the toughest gig I know.

1385
01:19:02,806 --> 01:19:05,074
Ahem.

1386
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:07,410
Hey, Burt, thanks
for getting me

1387
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:08,444
out of the ring.

1388
01:19:08,444 --> 01:19:11,314
I'm going to
need a partner
around here.

1389
01:19:11,314 --> 01:19:15,418
Thanks, but
i haven't had
a vacation since...

1390
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:17,120
Since I met you.

1391
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,521
Vacation?
if you need me,

1392
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:22,225
I can get out of
this monkey suit
real quick.

1393
01:19:22,225 --> 01:19:25,428
How far can you get
on two broken legs?

1394
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:26,830
Quit mothering me.

1395
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:28,431
I love you guys.

1396
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:30,033
We love you, too.

1397
01:19:40,844 --> 01:19:42,111
See you soon.

1398
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,313
Maybe sooner
than you think.

1399
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:45,849
Bye, Sean.

1400
01:19:52,588 --> 01:19:54,590
Hey, you're
going to--

1401
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,325
we're going to
make him stay.

1402
01:19:57,994 --> 01:19:59,528
