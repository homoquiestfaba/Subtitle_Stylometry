and Chris to book that place

437
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:01,460
So, is, uh, JJ
joinin' us for dinner?

438
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,696
No, he, uh, he ate dinner.

439

He's in his room

440
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:06,532
Oh, right.

441
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,001

442
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,002
Oh, of course!

443
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:12,105
I indoctrinated
him very early.

444
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,807
Yeah, my mom too.

445
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,675

take me to Fenway.

00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:18,178
Oh, JJ's been dying to go.

447

It's just things have been
a bit tight this year.

448
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,616
Oh, well, I totally get that.

449
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:26,552
My mom, I mean,
she just never paid the bills.

450
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,520
I'm actually in the middle
of getting my Psy-D.

451
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,589
- Oh, so you're in school?
- Post-doc.

452
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:31,858
It's been amazing,
I get to see clients,

453
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:33,960
I just don't get paid yet.

454
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:36,428
I'm also finishing off
my dissertation, so.

455
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,864
And bein' a mom.

456
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:40,867
Oh, that part, I really love.

457
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:42,802
So you wanna be a therapist?

458
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:45,772
Yeah, family counselor.

459
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,441
I can see that.

460
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,612
So, uh, what kind of
law do you practice?

461
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,180
Corporate.

462
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:57,150
Yeah, mostly contracts,

463
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:00,020
financial transactions,
regulatory compliance,

464
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,087
nothin' sexy.

465
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,322
Big companies?

466
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:06,458
Yeah, yeah, we mostly just try
to protect them from themselves.

467
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,095
And from the little people
they screw over?

468
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:10,529
Well, I don't know about that.

469
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,165
Your mom must be so proud.

470
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,705
- I'm joking!
- Oh.

471
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:21,473
No, seriously, though,
she must be thrilled!

472
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,476
You've done very
well for yourself.

473
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,712
Thanks.

474
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,948
You're only a little evil.

475
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:29,616
Aren't we all?

476
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:30,516
I guess.

477
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,550
Yes.

478
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,153
(laughing)

479
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:36,189
So you and your mom
must be very close.

480
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,924
Yeah, she's great.

481
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,626
I mean, she raised me
all by herself.

482
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:40,827
- Mm.
- Come on, that's bullshit!

483
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,995
Hey, JJ!

484
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,229
Language!

485
00:22:43,263 --> 00:22:44,831
Ugh, the Yankees hit a granny.

486
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,834
Fuck!

487
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,903
So I checked out
this vegetarian place.

488
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,071
It's got great reviews.

489
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:52,806
Yeah? You vegetarian?

490
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,075
No, no, but I dabble.

491
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:56,643
You?

492
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,678
Pretty far from it.

493
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,080
No shit.

494
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:02,649
(muffled talking on TV)

495
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:07,687
Oh, you know what?

496
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:10,790
I forgot about the wine.

497
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:13,059
Would you like to see
how it pairs with this

498
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:14,928
delectable mess?

499
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:18,631
I'm good with water,
but you go ahead.

500
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,133
- Oh, you don't like the wine?
- No, I love wine,

501
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,002
I just don't drink anymore.

502
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:23,803
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't realize.

503
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:27,807
No, it's fine! Seriously.

504
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:29,142
How long?

505
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,011
Since JJ was in my belly.

506
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,748
That's amazing.

507
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,049
It's survival.

508
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,586
My mom was into pills.

509
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,891
Oh, I'm sorry.

510
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,726
Nah, she's much better now.

511
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,164
I'm glad to hear,

512
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:55,835
but that must have been
really painful for you.

513
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,904
So what made you
wanna be a therapist?

514
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,339
Nice deflection!

515
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,074
Now you're analyzing me.

516
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:04,611
No, I'm not, I was
just wondering 'cause,

517
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:06,746
I mean, I know it's
gotta be pretty hard.

518
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,848
Well, I went through
a lot of shit,

519
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,717
and I needed help,
but I got it,

520
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,021
and then I realized
I wanted to help someone else.

521
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:17,090
You know,
when people are in pain,

522
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,626
they can't help but hurt others,

523
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:22,896
and then the world sucks.

524
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:23,863
(phone vibrating)

525
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:25,265
Uh, I'm sorry.

526
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,833
No, that's okay,
do you need to get it?

527
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:29,235
Ugh, oh, no, it's just my job.

528
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:31,137
On a Saturday night?

529
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:32,705
Big meeting Tuesday.

530
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:35,075
Big shot.

531
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:37,744
(Pattie laughing)

532
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:39,212
We are so spoiled.

533
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,781
Oh, yeah, it's a great time
to be a Boston fan.

534
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:45,018
Just wish the Bruins
coulda pulled it off.

535
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,253
Listen, I hate
to do this, but, um,

536
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:50,256
I have a ton of work
to get through.

537
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,892
Oh, oh, no problem.

538
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,828
Um, before you go,
can I ask you something,

539
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:58,965
and will you be honest with me?

540
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,968
Um, okay?

541
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:09,042
What were you doing
at the field today?

542
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:11,077
What do you mean?

543
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:14,314
I mean, I don't mean to
sound paranoid, it's just,

544
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:17,383
it's a little weird, right?

545
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,385
Yeah, weird, yes.

546
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:21,254
I mean, I couldn't
believe it was you.

547

he did to his father.

828
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:10,156

beat him every day, Pattie.

I'm not saying his father
didn't deserve it.

831
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,030

it was so savage!

832
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:22,002

I was just as
fucked up as he was.

connections,
and I loved getting high.

840
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,988

I didn't tell him sooner.
