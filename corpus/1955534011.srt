1
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,307
Kevin? Kevin!
I'm up! I'm up.

2
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,946
You're gonna be late for school.

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,381
I'm already dressed, Dad.

4
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,474
Uh-huh.

5
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,481
I'm practically out of the door.

6
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,049
Why don't I believe you?

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,248
Are you calling me a liar?

8
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,225
Well, let's just say that you and the
truth aren't always on speaking terms.

9
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,758
Well, that hurts.

10
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,992
To think that my father doesn't
even believe his first-born child.

11
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,090
It's not a question
of belief, Kevin,

12
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,000
it's a question of experience,

13
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,599
and in my experience...

14
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:02,905
Who are you going to believe?

15
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,569
Your experience?
Or your son?

16
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,668
Huh.

17
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,506
Well, I stand corrected.

18
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,978
Honestly, Dad...

19
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,912
I wish you'd learn
to trust me once in a while.

20
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,646
Okay, I apologize.

21
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,918
And Dad, I need some cash
for the class trip.

22
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,726
I thought I gave you money
for a class trip last week.

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,354
It's for another class trip.

24
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,693
They must be running a travel
agency out of your school.

25
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,430
Here.

26
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,026
Finish your homework?

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,237
Of course I finished
my homework.

28
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,638
It's right in here.

29
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:39,276
I'll see you tonight, then.
See you tonight, Dad.

30
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,474
Okay. All right.

31
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,315
Homework.

32
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,006
I will be collecting your social
studies assignment this morning.

33
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,666
You're late, Kevin.

34
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,233
Sorry. Sorry.

35
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,367
It's not my fault.

36
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,004
I was helping Principal Taggert
with a school safety issue.

37
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,413
And what safety issue
would that be?

38
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,917
I'm afraid I can't tell you, Miss Walker.
Top-level security.

39
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,282
Sworn to secrecy.

40
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,548
Take a seat, Kevin.

41
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,456
As you know, this assignment is
worth 30% of your final grade,

42
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,926
so I hope you all took it
very seriously.

43
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,789
Top-level security?

44
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,189
It's the best I could come
up with on short notice.

45
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,669
One of these days, you're
gonna get caught, you know.

46
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,063
Yeah?

47
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,928
Well, not today.

48
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,873
Thank you.

49
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,046
<i>Kevin. Award'?</i>

50
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,756
Is there a problem, Miss Walker?

51
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,257
I'm not sure.

52
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,055
You wrote this paper
all by yourself?

53
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,152
Stayed up all night,
but it was worth it.

54
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,492
I really think I learned
something important.

55
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,122
Uh-huh.
You know what?

56
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,599
I think I better
call your father

57
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:47,229
to confirm that you actually did
write this paper on your own.

58
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,102
Oh, I wouldn't do
that, Miss Walker.

59
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,072
My dad's very busy, you know.

60
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,410
You really shouldn't bother him.

61
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,741
Mmm. It won't
take a minute.

62
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,613
And I'm sure your father's interested
in your education, of course.

63
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,245
Of course.

64
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,335
<i>Happy</i> Friday, kids.

65
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,018
<i>We are pleased to inform you that we
won't be serving plain, hot mush today.</i>

66
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,925
<i>It will be hot mush with
applesauce and cinnamon.</i>

67
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,464
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

68
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,292
Thanks. Keep the change.

69
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,301
What if Miss Walker
wasn't kidding?

70
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,168
What if she really does
call your dad?

71
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,804
Becca, I'm hurt.

72
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,001
You, of all people, don't
believe I wrote that paper?

73
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,504
How long have we been friends?
Since third grade.

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,773
And what's our agreement?
We never lie to each other.

75
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,042
Right.

76
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,547
I know you didn't
write that paper.

77
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,385
Then you also know
I've got a plan.

78
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,820
<i>You know we're stalling,
but they don't know that.</i>

79
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,688
Don't worry about it.
It's just a little white lie.

80
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,757
Well, just tell
them we need some more time

81
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,489
to review the documents.
Hang on a sec. Another call.

82
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,262
Never mind.
It's a wrong number.

83
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,903
Wonder who this is.

84
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,909
Hello? This is Tom Shepard.
Hello, Mr. Shepard.

85
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:06,313
This is Karen Walker, Kevin's
social studies teacher.

86
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,407
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

87
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,053
Hello, Karen. Kevin has
told me a lot about you.

88
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,213
<i>He has?</i>

89
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,464
He says you're one of the
best teachers at the school.

90
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,748
Oh! Well,
I don't know about...

91
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,896
I am calling
to confirm something.

92
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,866
<i>Did Kevin stay up all night working
on his social studies assignment?</i>

93
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,367
No. No, he did not.

94
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,267
<i>Ah.
He retired around 3:00 a.m.</i>

95
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,439
<i>He's been working quite hard
on this paper for weeks.</i>

96
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,038
I'd be very surprised if it
didn't earn him at least an A.

97
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,504
<i>Well, I will certainly, um...</i>

98
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,069
By the way, are you calling
all the parents today?

99
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,843
Uh. No, but...

100
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,852
ls there some reason you're
suspicious of my son in particular?

101
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,689
Well, no, it's just...

102
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,724
<i>For crying out loud,
cut the kid some slack.</i>

103
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,889
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miss Walker,
I've got work to do. Bye-bye.

104
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,554
Goodbye...

105
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,097
Why did I ever doubt you?

106
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,532
The doctor said
it's a very rare condition...

107
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,975
And any kind of extreme physical
exertion could result in...

108
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,569
Excuse me!
Sorry to interrupt.

109
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,615
Kevin, I need to see you
in my classroom.

110
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,583
No. Um, actually, I'm in a meeting.
Can it wait?

111
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,652
It can't.

112
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,222
Plagiarism?

113
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,782
They have this wonderful
new program called iCompare

114
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:28,798
that correlates instances of selected texts
against known sources on the Internet.

115
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,130
It could've been a coincidence.

116
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,567
Forty-seven times?

117
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,513
I'm afraid the odds are
not in your favor, Kevin.

118
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:39,332
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just ran out of time.

119
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,775
I didn't know what else to do.

120
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,182
Usually, I would have to
report this to the principal,

121
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:48,775
but I think, in this case,
one-week suspension.

122
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,875
I can do better than that.

123
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,448
One month.

124
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:58,929
No Internet, no allowance, no
phone, no video games and no car.

125
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:03,160
And, of course, I will need you to redo
your assignment in your own words,

126
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,930
and in your own
handwriting this time.

127
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,264
No Internet?

128
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,672
Tomorrow's the last day
of the semester.

129
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,610
I want your new assignment on my desk
no later than 9:00 tomorrow morning.

130
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,440
Or?

131
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,348
Summer school?
Seriously?

132
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,318
Seriously.

133
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,022
Unless I come up with
a completely new project,

134
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,463
I'm gonna be spending the entire
summer stuck in some classroom

135
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,728
with Miss Walker and a
bunch of mouth-breathers.

136
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,860
<i>Okay, well, let's think. Uh...</i>

137
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,335
Just pick a topic.

138
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,339
New technologies.

139
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,475
<i>Trends in new technologies.</i>

140
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,043
How am I supposed to write
about new technologies

141
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,240
if I can't even use
my current technology?

142
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,646
They say you should write
about what you know.

143
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,378
Great. So what do I know?

144
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,012
Well, you know how to lie.

145
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,818
Thanks.

146
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,991
<i>Just trying to help.</i>

147
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,688
This isn't a game, Becca.
This is serious business.

148
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,993
A game.

149
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,198
I gotta go!
See you tomorrow.

150
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,360
But...

151
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,321
I'm done!

152
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,065
No!

153
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:38,781
What?

154
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,995
Great. Just great.

155
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,877
Yeah, I'm coming home.

156
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,176
Nah, it was
a total waste of time.

157
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:14,984
No-talent hacks at that stupid game
expo couldn't come up with Ms. Pac-Man

158
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,292
if you gave' em
three ghosts on a plate.

159
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,662
Yeah, I'm on my way
to the airport now.

160
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,531
If the guy could
find the gas pedal!

161
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,568
I'll call you later.

162
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,205
So you're in the, uh,
video game business?

163
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,501
Oh, let me guess.

164
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,204
You got a great idea for a game?

165
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,645
Yeah, actually, I do.
It's called...

166
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:41,908
Nice guy-

167
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,751
Kevin Shepard, you're a genius.

168
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,987
Oh!

169
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,194
Oh, no. Oh! Wow.

170
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,725
Oh, my gosh.

171
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,732
Oh, my gosh, kid.

172
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,098
I didn't even see you.
You okay?

173
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,936
I think you broke my tibia.

174
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,337
Your tibia's in your leg.

175
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,203
Phantom pains!

176
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,543
Phantom pains!

177
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,845
All right, kid.
Looks like you lived.

178
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,613
We gotta get to the airport!

179
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,053
Well, what about my bike?

180
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,053
Tough break.
Hope you have insurance.

181
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,025
How am I supposed
to get to school?

182
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,461
Isn't there a bus
for you people?

183
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,762
I need to get to school now!

184
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,734
Look, give me a ride and I'll forget all
about this clearly illegal hit-and-run.

185
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,794
Uh, we didn't run.
We stopped.

186
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:35,964
Forget it, kid!

187
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,373
Thanks to Miss Daisy here, I'm
already late for my flight.

188
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,641
Ow! My arm!

189
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,142
My leg!

190
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,282
We'd better get a police report.

191
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,280
Someone call 911.

192
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,582
All right!

193
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,056
He's kidding.

194
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,316
Shut up. Get in the car.

195
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,322
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

196
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,411
Hi. I'm Kevin Shepard.

197
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,438
Where's your school?

198
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:19,806
Fourth and Maple.

199
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,748
Give it some gas!
We haven't got all day.

200
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,081
Yes, Mr. Wolf.

201
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,188
So, what brings you to Columbus?

202
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,663
I came here for
the video game expo.

203
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,672
I was scouting for new talent
for Highcroft Electronics,

204
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,308
apparently wasting my time.

205
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,777
Wait.

206
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,871
Did you say
Highcroft Electronics?

207
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,005
Have you heard of it?

208
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,344
Are you kidding?

209
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,716
<i>Red Thunder? Army Call?
Space Zombie 2?</i>

210
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,948
That place is legendary.
You work there?

211
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,816
Oh, Larry Wolf.
Head of Interactive.

212
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,186
Wow.

213
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,829
You must be a genius.

214
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:08,957
I'll accept that.

215
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,295
You know, I wrote a game.

216
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,667
For my social studies
assignment. You want to see?

217
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,034
Oh. Sure, sure, I do,

218
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,972
but first, let me grab my ceremonial
knife and commit hari-Highcroft!

219
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,134
But it's really good.

220
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,677
Yeah, yeah, read my lips.

221
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,237
I'm not interested in
your stupid game here.

222
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,220
Hmm.

223
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,904
Here we are.

224
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:52,902
I guess we're here.

225
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,602
Yes, we are.

226
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,011
Hey, can I have my game back?

227
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,039
Sure, sure, of course. Here, let
me get the door for you here.

228
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,941
Hey, thanks for the ride.

229
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,782
We're even, right?
Yeah, sure.

230
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,412
Good. Out.

231
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,322
<i>Hey,</i> drive! <i>Hey,
what are you doing?</i>

232
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,121
But what about
the kid's assignment?

233
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,252
I said drive,
you idiot! Drive!

234
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,091
Hey. Come back!

235
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,231
You've got my assignment!
Come back!

236
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,970
You seriously expect me
to believe this?

237
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,703
But it's true! I did the
assignment, I swear.

238
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:31,805
Uh-huh. So, some guy hits you with his
limousine, then stole your homework?

239
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,482
Look, I know how it sounds...

240
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,075
Actually, Kevin,
I don't think you do.

241
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,984
But I'm telling you the truth.

242
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,156
Maybe I lied a few times
in the past... A few?

243
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,555
Okay, a lot!

244
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,595
But this time,
you have to believe me.

245
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,824
Please!

246
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,561
Enjoy summer school, Kevin.

247
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,259
Economics.

248
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,356
The fundamentals of economics have
remained unchanged for centuries,

249
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,831
with the simple idea
that supply and demand

250
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,030
is the foundation of all commerce in
all fashions all around the world,

251
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,301
wherein, if supply equals "X"
and demand equals

252
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,880
But if we are to understand
that "Y" is greater than "X",

253
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,950
we can invert
the equation and reverse...

254
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,147
Yes!

255
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,193
Yes to economic theory?

256
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,560
Thank you. I agree.

257
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,327
<i>Namaste.</i>

258
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,891
One with the floor.

259
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,529
Respect your center.

260
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,451
What?

261
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,357
Do we have a problem, Mr.
Shepard? Yeah!

262
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,732
That jerk stole my game!

263
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,868
<i>You really expect me
to believe this?</i>

264
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,735
But it's true, Dad.
You can look him up.

265
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,994
His name is Larry Wolf, he's
from Highcroft Electronics,

266
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,507
and he took my social
studies assignment.

267
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,033
Are we back to that lie again?

268
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,238
I'm not lying! Oh, wait a second.
Let me see.

269
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,371
Are your lips moving? Yes.

270
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,143
That means you're lying.

271
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:21,642
That hurts, Dad.

272
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,884
How do you think I feel, Kev?

273
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,888
I can't even trust my own son.

274
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,424
Now, I'll be back from
New York in three days.

275
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,889
This should tide
you over till then.

276
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,469
And this is for
emergencies only.

277
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,513
You got that?
Got it.

278
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,806
Say it with me. For...

279
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,085
Emergencies only.
Emergencies only.

280
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,015
Your mom was always so proud
of you, Kevin.

281
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:02,148
I can't help but thinking how
disappointed she'd be with all of this.

282
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,754
I know I am.

283
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,157
But, Dad...
Please...

284
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,957
No more lies.

285
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,979
<i>Highcroft Electronics.
How can I direct your call?</i>

286
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,010
Yes, I'd like to speak to Mr. Larry
Wolf in your Interactive division.

287
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,953
<i>Can I ask who's calling, please?</i>

288
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,046
My name is Kevin Shepard.

289
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,955
<i>And, Mr. Shepard,
what is this regarding?</i>

290
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,654
It's regarding my game, Big Fat
Liar, which he stole from me and...

291
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,789
Please don't call <i>back.</i>

292
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,059
Hello?

293
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:48,136
Kevin, you've called four times already.
Give it up.

294
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,503
No, not until I talk to Wolf.

295
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,716
Do you know how many crank phone
calls they must get there every day?

296
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,073
From people just like you,

297
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,512
who say they had their idea
for a game stolen?

298
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,243
You might as well forget it.

299
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,317
Okay.

300
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,412
I won't call anymore.
Good.

301
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,922
I'm gonna go see him in person.

302
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,557
What?

303
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,093
Think about it!

304
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,720
He can't hang up on me when
I'm standing in his office.

305
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,733
San Francisco is, like,
2,000 miles away.

306
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,428
My dad said for
emergencies only.

307
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,835
This is an emergency.

308
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,152
So wait, you're just
going to walk in there,

309
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:31,467
all by yourself and
try to meet this guy?

310
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,074
You're right.
I can't do this alone.

311
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:42,186
Me? No! I can't go
to San Francisco.

312
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,920
Give me one good reason why not.

313
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,086
I'll give you two.

314
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,719
My parents.

315
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,229
They'll never say yes to this.

316
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,591
So lie.

317
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,000
Mom? Dad?

318
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,945
There's something
I have to tell you.

319
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,450
I've decided I want
to go to Yoga Camp.

320
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,432
How's the new phone?

321
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,938
Perfect. Thanks, Dad.

322
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,715
Highcroft Electronics, please.

323
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,722
There he is.

324
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,429
Yo. Hansel and Gretel.

325
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,605
Where do you think you're going?

326
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,068
We're here to see Larry Wolf.

327
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,502
Uh-huh.

328
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,236
Got an appointment?

329
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,803
Not exactly, but he's going
to want to talk to me.

330
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,307
Oh, yeah.

331
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,112
I'm sure he's been dreaming
of this his whole life.

332
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,320
Look, Jimmy, we've come a very
long way for this meeting.

333
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:24,087
I would suggest you just call upstairs and
let him know that Kevin Shepard is here.

334
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,022
Hi, Mr. Wolf?

335
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,599
It's Jimmy in the lobby.

336
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,295
I was hoping to get fired
today for bothering you

337
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,998
about a couple of snotty kids
who don't have an appointment.

338
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,129
On second thought,

339
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,639
<i>I'll</i> keep my job.

340
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,468
Buh-bye.

341
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,780
Now what?

342
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,789
Be right back.

343
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:10,464
Go on up.

344
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,243
Mmm, go on up.

345
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,848
Yeah, go on up.

346
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,685
<i>Bigger Fatter Liar.</i>

347
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,597
Oh... It's not supposed
to do that, sir.

348
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,559
It's not supposed to freeze
in the middle of the game?

349
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,003
I had no idea...
You're such an idiot!

350
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:47,869
It's still got a few bugs, but
I'm sure once we get it up and running,

351
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,613
you won't be able
to put it down, Mr. Wolf.

352
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,510
No, no, I doubt that.

353
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,379
I do not play video games.

354
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,783
Video games are for losers
with nothing better to do.

355
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,045
Uh...

356
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,226
Excuse me, Mr. Wolf?
Hmm?

357
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,854
If you don't like the games, why are
you running the Interactive division?

358
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,721
Well, let me ask
you something, Connie.

359
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,229
It's Kenny, sir.

360
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,427
Yeah, whatever.

361
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,300
Do you think that
I like microwave ovens?

362
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,429
No, I don't.

363
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,031
Microwave ovens cook like crap,

364
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,476
and they don't even get
the popcorn setting correct.

365
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:27,380
But I spent five years
in appliances.

366
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,383
Five long years.

367
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:34,414
I pioneered convection-roasting
technology.

368
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:38,552
I introduced the
FridgeMate TV system.

369
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,722
I tripled the revenue
for that department.

370
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,631
I was a shoo-in to be
president of this company.

371
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,394
Top-floor office.

372
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,494
Big pay raise.

373
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:51,897
A view.

374
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,670
You have a wonderful view, sir.

375
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,177
Oh, yeah? Really?
Look at this.

376
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,509
Oh.

377
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,914
Exactly.

378
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,148
I've worked for this
company for 30 years.

379
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,779
I deserved to be president.

380
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,655
They owed it to me. But what
did Old Man Highcroft do?

381
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,853
He gave the job to his grandson.

382
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,293
His idiot grandson!

383
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,455
I meant to say that.

384
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,623
Now, you listen to me.

385
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,829
I'm going to work you morons
like rented monkeys

386
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,428
until I turn this turd of a
department into a winner.

387
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:27,100
Then I'm going to show them who
should be president of this company!

388
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,200
<i>Capisce?</i>

389
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,370
Yup.

390
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,653
Hmm.

391
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,620
Wait here.

392
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,707
I'm sorry. Mr. Wolf is
in a meeting right now.

393
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,131
He's going to have
to call you back.

394
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,844
Delivery for Mr. Wolf.

395
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,280
Thank you. You can just
put that right there.

396
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,908
Sorry. This is
a special order.

397
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,920
Mr. Wolf asked for this
to be hand-delivered to him.

398
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,422
Well, I'm Mr. Wolf's
executive assistant.

399
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,322
I'm sure I can handle this.

400
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,890
My instructions were
very specific, Penny.

401
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,340
Cyberdatetoday.com?

402
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,349
Oh, Penny.

403
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,719
Just give it to me!

404
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:52,853
No!

405
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,420
Look, kid, it's just a pizza!

406
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,623
Oh.

407
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:58,961
Mr. Wolf's office.

408
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,559
<i>Hi, Penny, it's Mike.</i>

409
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,696
Mike?

410
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:06,375
I had a really good time
last night at, uh...

411
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,470
Olive Garden?

412
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:14,377
Oh! So did I, Mike. I didn't
expect to hear from you so soon.

413
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:15,943
<i>L need to see you again.</i>

414
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,083
Can you meet me right away?

415
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,615
When?

416
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,886
Now.
Right now?

417
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,451
I know it sounds crazy,
but I have to see you.

418
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,121
I need to tell you how I feel.

419
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,289
Oh, Mike.

420
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,766
<i>I think this could be the start
of something very special.</i>

421
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,094
I'm in the lobby.

422
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,230
I'll be right down.

423
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,300
Oh!

424
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,476
You're still here. Fine, yeah.
You can go. Fine.

425
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,449
Thanks.

426
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,321
Good luck.

427
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,958
Thanks.

428
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,588
Wait. What? Uh...

429
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,695
Don't worry, Mr. Wolf.

430
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,531
We'll do our best to see that
Big Fat Liar launches on time.

431
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,697
You'd better, because if
it doesn't, Candy... Kenny.

432
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,103
Yeah, whatever.

433
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,439
The point is, is that if
you don't fix this game,

434
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:17,844
I'm gonna see to it that you spend
the rest of your pathetic life

435
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,679
programming talking baby
dolls till your ears bleed!

436
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,355
Hi. Remember me?

437
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,715
Penny!

438
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,884
She's on a date.

439
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,618
All right, everybody, get out.

440
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,360
Now!

441
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,627
Now!

442
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:48,037
So, let me guess. This is
about, um, Big Fat Liar, right?

443
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,807
So you do remember?

444
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,640
What do you want, kid?

445
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:52,847
What do you think he wants?

446
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,078
Uh, money, credit
and an apology.

447
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,675
Actually, no.

448
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,748
What?
What?

449
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:03,716
All I want is for you to call
my dad and tell him the truth.

450
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,726
Seriously? We came all
this way for that?

451
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,755
You want me to call your dad,

452
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:13,359
Daddy, and tell him that I,
um, stole your idea?

453
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:15,729
Exactly.

454
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,031
Let me think about that.

455
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,097
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.

456
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:20,866
Mr. Wolf.

457
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,605
Larry...
Mr. Wolf.

458
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,380
Come on! Think about it.

459
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,477
I think we both know you want
to do the right thing.

460
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,779
Pretty much goes without saying that
if I'm going to steal somebody's idea,

461
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,955
which you have
absolutely no proof of,

462
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,424
I'm probably not going
to do the right thing.

463
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,864
Security!
Mr. <i>Wolf?</i>

464
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,058
You're making a big mistake.

465
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,862
Is that a threat?

466
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,297
Let me tell you something, kid.

467
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:51,704
I didn't get this far in the corporate
snake pit by being intimidated,

468
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:55,267
especially by some
smart-ass kid.

469
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,640
So why don't you and
Fly-Over Barbie here

470
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,216
go back to Hooterville,
where you belong?

471
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,911
I came up with Big Fat Liar, and I
am never going to admit otherwise.

472
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,552
Oh, Mr. Wolf,
I am so sorry.

473
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:14,287
Oh! So am I, because the unemployment
line is so long these days!

474
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,623
Steroids, get these two
out of my sight.

475
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,093
Yes, sir.

476
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,564
Hey!

477
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:24,565
Nice try with the phone.

478
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,334
Beat it.

479
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,476
Kids!

480
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,848
Zip it.

481
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,423
Well, it was worth a shot.

482
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,657
If it's any consolation,
I believed you all along.

483
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,166
Oh, this isn't over.

484
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,937
Well, what else can you do?
You heard Wolf.

485
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,472
You don't have any proof, and
he's not going to admit anything.

486
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:58,636
Not yet.

487
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:06,538
You bumped his phone?

488
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,845
Got all the data when
it was in my pocket.

489
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,684
Addresses, phone numbers,
schedules, emails...

490
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,314
ls that...
Uh-huh.

491
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,990
What kind of moron keeps his
credit card numbers in his phone?

492
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,388
He could have done this
the easy way.

493
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,662
But now, we're gonna
do things my way.

494
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,473
Of course, Mr. Wolf.

495
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,502
Your father has arranged a pre-paid
room, all expenses on his account.

496
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,243
Welcome to
the Fairmont Nob Hill.

497
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,041
Front!

498
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,184
Wow.

499
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,187
This is beautiful.

500
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,063
Tell me they have a minibar.

501
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,733
$50 for a cheeseburger?

502
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,705
Yeah, that's crazy.

503
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,345
We need to spend more money.

504
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,505
Let's go out for dinner.

505
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:15,008
Um, Kevin, I didn't
exactly pack for going out.

506
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,847
Don't worry, we'll just put
it on Larry Wolf's tab.

507
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,974
You know what?

508
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,599
We'll take them all.

509
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,009
How much is this going to cost?

510
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,537
Uh... Who cares?

511
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,440
Don't you think it's a bit ironic,
trying to prove to your dad

512
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,986
that you're telling the truth by
lying, cheating, and stealing?

513
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,486
Wolf ripped me off.
I'm just paying him back.

514
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:04,987
Oh, look. Caviar!

515
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,221
Really expensive caviar.

516
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,069
<i>I still feel bad about this.</i>

517
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,467
I told you, Wolf deserves it.

518
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,910
Not that, this.

519
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,846
I really don't mind sleeping on
the couch if you want the bed.

520
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,350
You came all this way with me.
It's the least I could do.

521
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,183
True. Are you going to
the homecoming dance?

522
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,883
No. You?

523
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,221
Give me a break. It's
a stupid, outdated ceremony.

524
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,352
Designed to maintain
the status quo.

525
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,427
And feed the egos of
cool kids in school.

526
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,396
Well, you can't dance, anyway.

527
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,192
Oh.

528
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,667
Well, you dance like a duck.

529
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,700
You move like you've
got explosive diarrhea.

530
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,400
I do not!

531
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,541
Dance, Kevin, dance!

532
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,743
You're going down!

533
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,294
<i>Hi, Dad.
Hey, Kev.</i>

534
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,159
I'm just checking in.
Is everything okay?

535
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,732
Just great. I'm learning
a lot at summer school.

536
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,711
I really think this is going
to be a life-changing event.

537
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,308
<i>Well, I'm glad to hear that.</i>

538
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,880
I'll be home in a couple days,

539
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,381
but if you need anything,
just let me, you know...

540
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,784
Gotta go, Dad! Don't want to be
late for civil disobedience class.

541
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,723
Hurry up.

542
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,963
Got it.

543
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,434
Send.

544
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,018
I think it's time we saw San Francisco.
Don't you?

545
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,320
Good morning, Mr. Wolf,

546
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,452
Miss... Wolf.

547
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,457
May I arrange a car for you?

548
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,332
Thank you, Elliot.

549
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,496
You may.

550
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,161
Oh.

551
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:38,038
<i>Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro</i>

552
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,784
<i>Figaro!</i>

553
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,147
<i>Figaro, Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro</i>

554
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,464
Ah!

555
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,035
Kevin.
Hello, San Francisco!

556
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,729
Kevin!

557
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,474
You've got a call.
The bank.

558
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,706
Larry Wolf.

559
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,675
Yes, this is he.

560
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,175
Unusual charges?

561
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,550
No, those are all accounted for.

562
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,814
Just treating my little
lady to a day in the city,

563
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,082
if that's okay with you.

564
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:25,027
Yes, we might be making
a few more big purchases.

565
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,555
Very big-

566
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,089
Yes, you too.
Buh-bye now.

567
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,091
Are we in trouble?

568
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,033
Please. It's all
under control.

569
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,036
So, you really
Mr. Wolf's kids?

570
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,569
Yep.

571
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,845
Hmm. Interesting.

572
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,847
Mr. Wolf has no kids.

573
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,178
Oh. Well, he doesn't
like to talk about us.

574
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,639
We're the black sheep
in the family.

575
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,880
Cut the crap. I work
for Highcroft Electronics.

576
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,781
The hotel, they called the
company to arrange the limo.

577
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,215
Uh-oh.

578
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,720
Yeah. Uh-oh.

579
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:03,788
I overheard you talking about
using his credit card.

580
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,265
What are you up to?

581
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,863
Nothing. It's all authorized.

582
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,871
Give me a break.

583
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,306
Let me tell you a little story.

584
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:16,936
Before I drive limo,
I used to work for Mr. Wolf.

585
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:18,645
You designed video games?

586
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,441
No, housewares.

587
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,448
<i>I was the top engineer in
the whole appliance division.</i>

588
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,236
Ever heard of the FridgeMate?

589
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,957
The TV set built
into the refrigerator?

590
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,054
That was me.

591
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,662
I've always wondered why
people wanted to watch TV

592
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,060
standing in front of the fridge.

593
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,760
I don't know.
They just do.

594
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,999
My point is,
it was my invention,

595
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,836
and then my boss,
the Mr. Larry Wolf,

596
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,071
he stole my idea
and pretended it was his own!

597
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:52,806
I know the feeling.

598
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,143
Why didn't you say something?

599
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,576
But what would I say?

600
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,110
Hmm? I had no proof, and it
was his word against mine.

601
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,423
And when I confronted him on it,

602
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:05,427
he reassigned me to
the transportation department,

603
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,429
and he said
if I ever complained,

604
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,863
he would blacklist
my name all over town!

605
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,102
Why are you telling us all this?

606
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,998
Because, I can tell that you
two are up to something,

607
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:26,010
and if it involves causing
any Hooterville to Mr. Wolf,

608
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,874
I'm in.

609
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,320
According to his schedule,
he's in meetings all day.

610
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:39,821
So?

611
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,662
So, he won't be home.

612
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,461
The perfect time to drop by
his house for a little visit.

613
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,035
And then we kill him, hmm?

614
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,961
Uh, no.
Uh, no.

615
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,166
Suit yourself.

616
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,236
Tomorrow, you have your meeting with Mr.
Highcroft at 2:00...

617
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,044
Oh, that little twerp. Why do I
have to waste my time on him?

618
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,641
Because he is the company's president.

619
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,068
And then you're being interviewed
by the TV station at 3:00.

620
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,354
Those bozos better
have Big <i>Fat</i> Liar ready,

621
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:12,257
'cause if Highcroft finds
out, we're in trouble.

622
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,853
He'll pull the plug
on this whole thing.

623
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,697
I'm sure they're working as hard
as they can. Well, I'm not.

624
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,928
I want Dopey and his Short
Bus Team here all night.

625
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:22,696
Hmm?

626
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,404
I want that game checked
and double-checked

627
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,169
till it's good to go,
you got that?

628
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,668
All night, sir?

629
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:31,339
Oh, I want you to stick
around and supervise. Me?

630
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,575
What? Did I st-st-st-stutter?

631
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,451
This has gotta be your top priority.
Got it?

632
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,556
Yes, sir, Mr. Wolf.
Good.

633
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,955
Have a nice night.
You, too.

634
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,919
"Top priority."

635
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,109
Cozy.

636
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,618
How do we get in?

637
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,816
I've got this.

638
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:28,000
Those don't look like
refrigerator repair tools.

639
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,329
Mmm. Sometimes, the
refrigerator is in a place

640
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,806
that's hard to get to, you know.

641
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,171
Let me try.

642
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,473
Key code, 555-55-55.

643
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,640
Clever.

644
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:50,821
What do we do?

645
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,963
Alarm code, 555-55-55.

646
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,004
At least he's consistent.

647
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,870
Wow. Nice place.

648
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,643
Yes. We should
torch it, no?

649
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,509
Let's just look around
a bit first, okay, Ivan?

650
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,378
Okay, whatever.

651
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,530
Anything interesting?

652
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,931
He's downloaded every
episode of My Little Pony.

653
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,299
Even the Christmas special?

654
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,007
What? It's a really good show.

655
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,645
I'll just take everything
and sort it out later.

656
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,848
Hey.

657
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,520
Look at these.

658
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,052
These are for...
Yeah, they are.

659
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,622
We got him.

660
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,047
Oh, he's got mu-sh...

661
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,347
I've hidden the car.

662
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:25,712
Did you get the stuff?

663
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,153
You must never question Ivan.

664
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,920
Skin bleach.

665
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:40,562
And skin dye.

666
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,066
He's here.

667
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,002
Game on.

668
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,875
The alarm! We forgot to
turn the alarm back on.

669
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:19,917
Ah...

670
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,162
Hmm.

671
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,202
Mmm.

672
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,790
Every day I'm getting
faster, stronger.

673
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,953
Every day I'm getting
faster, stronger.

674
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:57,028
Every day I'm getting
faster, stronger.

675
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,930
Every day I'm getting faster...

676
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,401
Do you think it's gonna work? Every
day I'm getting faster, stronger.

677
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:05,303
Every day I'm getting
faster, stronger.

678
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,466
Every day I'm...

679
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:08,702
Maybe we didn't use enough.

680
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,083
I think we used enough.

681
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:21,382
Let's get to work.

682
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,162
Oh! What did I do last night?

683
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,902
My head's killing me.

684
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,182
That kid!

685
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,390
It's that kid!

686
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,537
Mr. Wolf's office.

687
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:46,199
Hi, Penny. It's Melissa
from Mr. Highcroft's office.

688
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,175
It's about his meeting
today with Mr. Wolf.

689
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:06,485
What?

690
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:10,227
Mr. Highcroft's office called. He
changed your appointment to noon.

691
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,993
<i>He'd like to meet you
for lunch instead.</i>

692
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,262
No, no, no. No! No!

693
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,896
I'm trying to find your day-planner
to see if that'll work...

694
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,741
Did you want me to tell him
you're unavailable?

695
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,506
No. He'll think
something's wrong.

696
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,344
Okay. I'm texting you
the address right now.

697
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,048
Are you sure you're up
for this meeting?

698
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,910
What is that supposed to mean?

699
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,851
You just sound a little odd.

700
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,025
<i>You just... You just mind
your own business!</i>

701
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:40,787
I'm fine.

702
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:44,056
Everything's fine!

703
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,548
Huh?

704
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,901
Kevin Shepard,
I'm going to kill you!

705
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,790
Shut the hell up, you moron!

706
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,351
Sorry! It's not me!
It's the car.

707
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:21,986
Oh, really? Really?

708
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:30,662
Are you kidding me? This
is a $200,000 automobile!

709
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,738
Good for you, buddy!
Good for you!

710
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,741
I got your license plate,
Hooterville!

711
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:36,969
So sue me!

712
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,979
Oh! Yeah!

713
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,648
Problem, sir? Whoa!

714
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,356
Officer, did you see that?

715
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,227
Please put your hands
where I can see them, sir.

716
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:57,494
No, no. That hillbilly! He
deliberately backed into my car!

717
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,057
Uh-huh. Can I see your license
and registration, please?

718
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:01,334
Oh, no, I got a meeting
I got to get...

719
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:02,928
Hey! No sudden
movements, sir.

720
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,328
Ah, it's in
the glove compartment.

721
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,203
Cirque do Soleil in town?

722
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:11,576
What? No, no. It's just... This is a prank.
It's a long story.

723
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,937
What's this?

724
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,741
What... What is this?

725
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,218
These are the blueprints for
the bank over on 17th Street.

726
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,846
No, this.
What is this?

727
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,382
Gun!

728
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,119
Gun!
What? No! It's rubber!

729
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,284
You see? It's a fake gun!

730
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:27,702
Come on! I mean, it's my first
day on the job. Just freeze.

731
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,871
<i>What are you gonna do'? You gonna...
No, no, no, no...</i>

732
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,043
Yeah. There might
be more of them there, so...

733
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,276
Better put out an APB for any
mimes carrying concealed weapons.

734
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:01,620
Got him.
Good. Now can we go home?

735
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,897
Why? I thought
we were having fun.

736
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,160
We are.

737
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:08,429
It's just, I feel bad
about lying to my parents.

738
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:12,463
Come on. A little lie here and
there doesn't hurt anybody.

739
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,400
Besides, it makes
life interesting.

740
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,644
It makes me interesting.

741
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:22,014
You don't need a lie to do that.

742
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:37,096
I guess, after my mom died,

743
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:41,625
it just seemed easier to make up stuff
than it was to have to face the truth.

744
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:43,803
I just sort of got used to it.

745
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,864
Well, I don't want
to get used to it.

746
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,974
Like you've never
lied to your parents before?

747
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,272
Once.

748
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,212
You remember that time we snuck out and
went to the Midnight Madness movies?

749
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,783
Yeah?
I got caught.

750
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:57,846
You never told me that.

751
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,717
I didn't want to make you feel
bad, but I got in big trouble.

752
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,517
I told them I snuck out alone.

753
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,986
You lied for me? Why?

754
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,959
Because, dummy, uh...

755
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:10,988
You're my best friend.

756
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,067
And that's the truth.

757
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,705
- What took you so long?
- I'm sorry.

758
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,542
But I had to explain to accounting
why I needed bail money!

759
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:31,379
Mr. Wolf, I don't understand why you had
bank blueprints, and a mask, and a gun!

760
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,078
It wasn't a real gun!

761
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,251
Officer.

762
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:38,891
Mr. Wolf!

763
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,990
Well, you have been acting
very suspicious lately.

764
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,762
It's not me, it's...
Oh, never mind.

765
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:47,926
Yes, sir.

766
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:49,702
Does it have anything to
do with your face, sir?

767
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,171
Oh, shut up, Penny!

768
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:56,507
<i>That's not how you found my car!
Oh, no. Oh, no.</i>

769
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,509
That's how I found your car.

770
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:03,440
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

771
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,076
Go back to France, creep!

772
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,449
I'm not from France!

773
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:17,790
Would you open it?

774
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,464
Idiot!

775
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,202
Well, you're welcome!

776
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,068
You're kidding.

777
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,406
Okay.

778
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:13,977
Oh.

779
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,737
Go, Niners!

780
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,182
I'm looking for a man
named Highcroft.

781
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,323
I think you're in the
wrong place, freakshow.

782
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,820
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

783
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:29,525
Are you threatening me
because I'm wearing makeup?

784
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,096
Because I look like a mime?

785
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,226
Because I'm just
a little bit different?

786
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,999
I thought this was America.

787
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,506
I thought...

788
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,283
I thought

789
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:57,518
we were supposed to accept people,
no matter what they look like.

790
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,752
Phew! Or smell like.

791
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:06,029
I mean, after all,
I don't get on your case

792
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:10,560
when you get a little drunk and
try to get romantic with a squid.

793
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,807
No, I do not.

794
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:17,710
I mean, in my book.

795
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:23,080
What you people do on the high
seas stays on the high seas!

796
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,412
Am I right?

797
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,916
Who's with me?

798
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,428
So, you give up yet?

799
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:41,792
It was you?

800
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,836
What'd you do to my face?

801
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:48,006
I can't... I can't get it off!
My face!

802
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:51,476
I... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna kill you!

803
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:53,813
Careful, Wolfie.

804
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,076
They don't care much for
mimes around these parts.

805
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:03,286
Oh! Doesn't matter.
I mean, fine.

806
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,426
I mean, you got me with your
little sophomoric prank, right?

807
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,930
But, big picture?

808
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:13,524
I'm the winner.
You're the loser!

809
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,097
We'll see.
Oh, yeah.

810
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,264
Oh, yeah.
We'll see. We'll see.

811
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:19,835
Yeah! We'll see!

812
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,373
Where's my car?

813
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:36,048
Taxi!

814
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:43,991
Is he here yet?

815
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:45,726
Well, actually...
Good, good, good.

816
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:48,942
'Cause I don't want that little toad
running off to his grandpa, telling him...

817
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,869
No, no, no... I kept his
precious brat waiting.

818
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,668
Miss Wise, I don't have time
to sit around and waste...

819
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,973
Mr. Highcroft! What a
pleasure it is to see you!

820
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,404
Oh, would you please accept
my humblest apologies

821
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:03,712
for my being a little late?
It was car trouble.

822
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,987
Yeah, whatever. Wolf, what's
going on with your face?

823
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,756
What? Oh, my...

824
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:13,555
My face? Yes, my face.
My face...

825
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,196
It's a publicity stunt.
Publicity!

826
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:19,893
For that new carnival game
that we have in development.

827
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,063
You look completely stupid.

828
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,898
Oh. Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

829
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:35,278
<i>All</i> right, <i>I'm here
to see Big Fat Liar.</i>

830
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:36,873
What do you have to show me?

831
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,679
You! Showtime.

832
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:44,858
So, we're all set for the big
launch tomorrow, right, Kelly?

833
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,188
"Kenny."
Kenny.

834
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,422
Gotcha. Here. Start it.

835
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:51,163
No, no, no. No, no, Mr. Wolf! No, no,
no, no? Oh! You want me to do it?

836
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:52,757
Okay, here we go. Ready?

837
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,766
<i>Big Fat Liar!</i>

838
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:56,935
Bigger Fatter Liar!

839
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,072
What is this crap?

840
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:09,910
What is this crap?
I tried to tell you!

841
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,915
Yeah, we're still beta-testing, sir.
It's all very technical.

842
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,618
I know what
beta-testing means, Wolf!

843
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:19,951
Look, I am sick of your excuses.

844
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:23,587
We have millions committed to
the marketing campaign on this.

845
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,463
Get out of my way!

846
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:29,102
I'm sure that we can...

847
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:32,105
I want to see this game up and
running by 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

848
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:35,904
Otherwise, I pull the plug
on Big <i>Fat</i> Liar and you.

849
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:41,114
Well... I...

850
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:45,085
There's a problem with the buffer overflow.
It keeps crashing.

851
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,950
I don't even know
what that means!

852
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,290
Well, we worked on it all night.

853
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,155
You know they lock the
bathrooms after 6:00 p.m.?

854
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,249
I had to pee in the sink.

855
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,521
You know, I have to be
on television in one hour

856
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,254
to promote a game
that doesn't exist!

857
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,258
Would you like me
to call and cancel?

858
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,365
No. I don't want to give
him the satisfaction.

859
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,270
Who?
Huh?

860
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,703
Never mind.

861
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,035
Now, you listen to me,
you little mud weasel.

862
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,132
I want you to go back
to work and fix that game,

863
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,007
because if it goes down,
I go down,

864
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,547
and if I go down,
I'm not going down alone.

865
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,882
Tell maintenance
to rip that sink out.

866
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:28,789
Did you get it?

867
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:32,458
Who knew it would be so hard to find
these in San Francisco? But I got it.

868
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,628
Why do they call it
a "ghost pepper"?

869
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:39,398
Maybe because nobody who eats one
lives long enough to warn you not to.

870
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:08,565
So Judy's going to ask you a
few questions about the game,

871
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:11,264
and then we'll show some screen
shots to tell the story.

872
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,540
That sound okay?

873
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,166
Sounds great.

874
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,240
What exactly happened
to your face, anyways?

875
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,007
I don't know.

876
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,176
What happened to yours?

877
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:34,961
More eyebrows.

878
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,795
The other one.

879
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:42,430
Excuse me?
Excuse me.

880
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:46,437
Excuse me? Hi. Are you
the producer? Yes.

881
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:47,803
I'm Jeff.

882
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:51,242
I'm an intern at Highcroft Electronics,
and I'm totally embarrassed,

883
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:55,043
but I forgot to give Mr. Wolf his
energy drink before he left the office.

884
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,914
No problem. He's just... Could
you give it to him? Please?

885
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:00,454
I don't think I could take him
yelling at me again today.

886
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:02,887
Sure. No problem.
Thanks.

887
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,957
Poor kid.

888
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,721
A-E-I-O-U.

889
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,564
Almost forgot your energy drink.

890
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,075
But I... I didn't...

891
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:25,112
In five, four, three, two...

892
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,013
Welcome back, everyone.

893
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:31,574
<i>We are here now with Larry
Wolf, VP of Interactive and...</i>

894
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,416
<i>President of Interactive.</i>

895
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:37,146
<i>President of Interactive
at Highcroft Electronics.</i>

896
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:38,748
<i>Well, ifs nice to be here.</i>

897
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,352
<i>Well,</i> your <i>company</i> is...
Here we go.

898
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:45,021
<i>About to release its highly anticipated
game, Big Fat Liar, tomorrow,</i>

899
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:48,261
<i>to what is sure to be
a media extravaganza.</i>

900
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,769
<i>We are very excited about it.</i>

901
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,305
<i>Yes, now, I have to admit,</i>

902
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,998
<i>we were all a little miffed here</i>

903
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,598
<i>that we didn't get a chance
to play the game ourselves.</i>

904
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:58,544
<i>We are keeping this game
under lock and key.</i>

905
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:00,545
It's... It's that good.

906
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,216
<i>Now, there were rumors about...</i>

907
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:04,946
<i>There have been
some development issues...</i>

908
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,179
Come on, come on!

909
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:07,618
<i>With the game.
Is that true?</i>

910
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:13,184
<i>No, we're just not releasing a review copy
of the game because it's too exciting.</i>

911
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:16,525
<i>We just want everybody
to be surprised by it.</i>

912
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,793
Okay, well,
that sounds fantastic.

913
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,666
Surely, you can tell us a little
bit about the game, though.

914
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,368
<i>I can't.</i>

915
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:28,675
Is it first-person shooter?

916
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:30,476
Shoo...

917
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:34,237
<i>Woofer!</i>

918
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:35,577
<i>Or more of a puzzle game?</i>

919
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:36,979
It's a...

920
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,484
Uh, maybe...

921
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:46,991
Mr. Wolf?

922
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:50,160
Mr. Wolf? Mr. Wolf?

923
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,055
Wolf, are you okay?

924
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,337
Water!

925
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:07,070
Yes!

926
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,923
Serves you right, Wolf.

927
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:55,621
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

928
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,891
Yes! High five!

929
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:05,406
<i>Today, Highcroft Electronics
interactive Division President Larry Wolf</i>

930
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,965
<i>had an unexpected meltdown
today on live television.</i>

931
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:10,776
<i>His bizarre behavior has some wondering...
Oh. Turn</i> it off.

932
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,120
<i>His bizarre behavior has some wondering...
Oh. Turn</i> it off.

933
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,578
Well, Mr. Highcroft called.

934
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,676
I tried to tell him it
was some sort of allergic reaction.

935
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:19,911
And?

936
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,857
He wants you to see the company
psychiatrist as soon as you get out.

937
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,291
But the... The game,
did it get fixed?

938
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,156
I'm afraid not.

939
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,857
No one seems to be able to
make it stop freezing up.

940
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:36,332
Why am I not in a private room?

941
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,632
Your credit card was declined, sir.
What?

942
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:41,934
Oh! That kid!

943
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,009
I'm ruined.
I'm completely ruined.

944
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:48,613
I wish there was something that I
could do to help, I really do.

945
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,674
I know. What could you do?

946
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,116
You can barely type a letter.

947
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:01,951
There's only one person
who can help me now.

948
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:04,658
So let me get this straight.

949
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:08,781
I help you fix the game, and then you'll
call my dad to explain everything?

950
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:12,202
That's right.
You have my word.

951
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:15,834
No way. Make the call first,
and then he'll help you.

952
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,877
Well, what's to prevent you from not
honoring your side of the bargain?

953
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,508
What's to prevent you
from doing the same?

954
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:25,816
I like her. Feisty.

955
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,489
Kevin... Kev.

956
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,592
I'm just asking for your help.

957
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:34,593
This baby was your brainchild.

958
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:37,526
Please.

959
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,195
I need you.

960
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:41,998
It needs you.

961
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:44,736
You have my word.

962
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,203
You can't do this.

963
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:55,744
One of us has to trust the other one.
It's the only way.

964
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:57,715
Do we have a deal?

965
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,701
Wake up, wake up. Hey.

966
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,558
Yes!

967
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,489
So?
Come on.

968
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:01,829
What do you think?

969
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:09,006
You made me lose.

970
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,323
Pretty cool, Wolf.

971
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:25,853
Pretty cool.

972
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,150
Mmm.

973
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,325
I'll see you at
the launch tomorrow.

974
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,804
Yeah!

975
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:55,682
You know, kid, I gotta admit,
you really saved my butt.

976
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,391
Yup. Now you're gonna
save mine, right?

977
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,816
You got it. Yes.

978
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:04,964
When you're right, you're right.
Am I right?

979
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:10,464
Hello?

980
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,166
Security. Bullpen.
Thank you.

981
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,308
What? What are you doing?
Seriously?

982
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:18,909
But you gave me your word.
We shook on it.

983
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:22,073
Well, maybe next time, you should
get that handshake in writing, huh?

984
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:26,586
Oh! Steroids. I thought I told you to
get the riff-raff out of my office.

985
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:27,910
I knew it.

986
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:31,422
Sorry, Mr. Wolf. I won't
let it happen again.

987
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,223
You know, when I first met you,

988
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:37,730
I really thought
you were something.

989
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,830
Big success. A big man.

990
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:45,503
All you really are
is a big, fat liar.

991
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:46,937
Ooh...

992
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:50,237
That hurts.

993
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:54,742
I'll remember that when I'm moving
into my new office on the top floor.

994
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:59,117
Steroids, make sure that they
get on the plane this time.

995
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,212
Will do, Mr. Wolf.
Move it.

996
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,255
I don't believe this. This
is a new low, even for you.

997
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:13,132
Well, be sure to mention that while
you're filing for unemployment insurance.

998
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:24,577
Okay, so what's the plan now?

999
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,904
The plan is we go home.

1000
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,747
But what about Wolf?
What about Big Fat <i>Liar?</i>

1001
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:34,545
It's over, Becca. He won.

1002
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,481
Yeah, but the only way
he did was by lying.

1003
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,614
Exactly.

1004
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:41,652
I don't want to be
that guy anymore, Becca.

1005
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:44,224
I don't want to end up
some sad little man

1006
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:45,560
in clown makeup who has to lie

1007
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,601
and steal from a kid
just to get ahead.

1008
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:56,933
I don't want to lie anymore.

1009
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,970
I want my dad to be proud of me.

1010
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:03,416
I want to be proud of myself.

1011
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:11,181
Anyway, thanks
for coming with me.

1012
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:14,525
It was fun, even if we
didn't get we what came for.

1013
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:15,993
You know what?

1014
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:17,824
Maybe we did.

1015
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:19,993
What do you mean?

1016
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:22,463
I'm proud of you, Kevin.

1017
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,505
It'll just be a minute.

1018
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,313
My, you two certainly
racked up the bill.

1019
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:48,723
Hi, Jimmy.

1020
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:49,852
Mr. Wolf called

1021
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:52,295
and said that I should
take over from here.

1022
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:54,893
Really?

1023
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:57,667
But I thought... He said to
take the rest of the day off.

1024
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,635
Thanks.

1025
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:05,907
See you two later.
Not!

1026
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:15,316
What are you doing here?

1027
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,871
Well, I was thinking about
delivering some payback

1028
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,393
to my soon-to-be
ex-boss.

1029
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,428
Do you know of anybody
who would like to help me?

1030
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,997
It's too late for that.

1031
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:25,998
Yeah, we're going home.

1032
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:28,399
So, what, you're just gonna let Mr.
Wolf take advantage of you?

1033
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:30,903
You're not gonna stand up for
yourself and do what's right?

1034
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:33,268
I just don't
want to lie anymore.

1035
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,940
I'm not talking about lying.

1036
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:39,843
I'm talking about making
somebody finally tell the truth.

1037
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,124
Hurry up, hurry up! The
door's not gonna open itself!

1038
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,599
Hmm.

1039
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,511
Hey, don't I know you
from somewhere?

1040
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,819
Appliances.

1041
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:23,048
Oh, no.

1042
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:29,894
What are you, crazy?

1043
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:33,399
No! You were crazy to steal
from Ivan Slobodovich!

1044
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:35,468
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

1045
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:37,969
Hey! Slow down, will ya?

1046
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:41,236
You know,
we can talk about this!

1047
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:43,003
No, too late for talking.

1048
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,304
Oh!

1049
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:50,908
Ah!

1050
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:57,316
NO, no!

1051
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:01,352
Hey!

1052
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,310
Call office!

1053
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,279
Would you like to call ice?

1054
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:23,179
Not ice! Why would I want ice?

1055
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:25,376
I want the office!
Call office!

1056
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:29,450
Larry Wolf's office.

1057
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:31,548
Penny! Penny,
help me! Help me.

1058
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,320
I'm in the back of a limousine.

1059
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:35,658
Yeah. Call the cops. The
driver's trying to kill me.

1060
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:39,731
Sure thing, Mr. Wolf.
I'll get right on that.

1061
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:47,070
Phase one is in progress.

1062
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:48,898
<i>Copy.</i>

1063
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:50,909
Bravo team, move into position.

1064
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,331
Where are we?

1065
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:48,261
What, you want money?
Name your price.

1066
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:52,764
I don't want money.

1067
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:54,300
What do you want?

1068
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:56,639
I want credit for my invention.

1069
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,643
I can make it happen.
Just let me out of here.

1070
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,440
And my old job back.
Done!

1071
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,578
You're on the payroll
as of this second. Boom, bang!

1072
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,950
And full health
insurance and dental.

1073
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,250
No problem.

1074
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:13,754
Do you have vision?
Vision?

1075
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:16,421
You only get 10% off
of frames and lenses,

1076
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:17,964
and nothing off of contacts.

1077
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:19,173
You know, it's a huge rip...

1078
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:20,656
You want it? You got it.

1079
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,633
Well, 10% isn't too bad.

1080
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:26,564
Yeah, I'll pay for the rest of
it myself, out of my own pocket.

1081
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:28,167
We got a deal?

1082
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:31,303
No deal.

1083
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:34,812
Looks like you're going to
miss your big launch party.

1084
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:47,024
Ivan? Ivan?

1085
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:49,928
Ivan?

1086
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:58,463
No...

1087
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:00,538
Get me out of here!

1088
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:07,607
Oh, no! No! No, no,
no, no, no, no!

1089
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:10,847
Help me! Help me!

1090
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:13,450
<i>Need some help?</i>

1091
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:16,788
Hey! Kid, kid!
Make a call!

1092
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:19,348
Tell them I'm on the tracks.
Tell them to stop the train.

1093
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:21,484
<i>You ready to tell the truth?
What?</i>

1094
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:23,403
<i>All you have to do is
tell my dad the truth.</i>

1095
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:26,723
"The truth"? The truth!
Highly overrated, kid.

1096
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:28,966
<i>Just admit you stole my idea.</i>

1097
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:30,569
Yeah, fine! Fine, fine, fine.

1098
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,866
Fine, yeah, fine, fine,
fine. Yes. I stole it,

1099
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,167
<i>I stole Big Fat Liar.</i>

1100
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,072
You gave me the paper
in the back of my car

1101
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,535
and I stole it.
Okay? You happy now?

1102
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:43,206
Yup. That's all I wanted.

1103
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,896
I'm gonna die!

1104
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:59,158
I'm gonna die.

1105
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:10,367
You've got a good team
working for you, Wolf.

1106
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:11,832
You really should
treat them better.

1107
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:21,009
Hey! Kid! No!
Give me that phone!

1108
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:26,851
You... No!

1109
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:45,601
Kid.

1110
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,408
Kid! No! Wait! Just...

1111
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:51,277
Wait!

1112
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:54,219
Hey, kid!

1113
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:58,756
Hey, kid!

1114
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:02,091
Where are you going?
Give me back that phone!

1115
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:04,987
Hey!

1116
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:08,898
Hey! Stop! Stop that kid!
Stop that kid!

1117
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:11,962
Get him! Get him!

1118
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,597
Stop him!
Stop that kid!

1119
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,266
You idiot!

1120
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:23,910
Watch your blood pressure.

1121
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:32,155
Get down there!
Really?

1122
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:33,419
Stay down there!

1123
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,660
You idiot!

1124
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,666
You can't outrun the Wolf.

1125
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:54,536
Oh...

1126
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:04,020
Oh, I'm sorry for
the interruption, folks.

1127
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,153
Game's over.
Beat it, kid.

1128
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:14,794
I'm sorry for the way I look.
It's been a very strange day.

1129
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:18,803
Out of the way, toad.

1130
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:24,475
<i>But enough about me.</i>

1131
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:26,705
<i>Lights.</i>

1132
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:29,909
<i>You're not here for that.</i>

1133
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:35,813
<i>You're not here for that.</i>

1134
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:39,518
<i>No, you're hereto witness the
evolution of mobile gaming.</i>

1135
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:42,027
<i>An evolution,
may I say a revolution,</i>

1136
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:46,190
<i>that I championed here
at Highcroft Electronics,</i>

1137
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:49,758
long before this
new regime ever took over.

1138
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,429
<i>So, ladies and gentlemen,
may I introduce</i>

1139
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:57,266
Big Fat Liar!

1140
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:04,212
<i>Every day I'm getting
faster, stronger.</i>

1141
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:07,344
<i>Every day I'm getting
faster and stronger.</i>

1142
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:10,015
<i>Every day I'm getting
faster, stronger.</i>

1143
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,558
<i>I'm gonna work you morons
like rented monkeys</i>

1144
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:21,692
<i>until I tum this turd of a
department into a winner.</i>

1145
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:24,703
<i>I'm gonna see to it that you spend
the rest of your pathetic life</i>

1146
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:27,740
<i>programming talking baby
dolls till your ears bleed!</i>

1147
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,235
Gotcha!

1148
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:44,879
Well, that explains
the underwear.

1149
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:48,387
<i>I doubt that.
I don't play video games.</i>

1150
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:51,954
<i>Video games are for losers
with nothing else to do.</i>

1151
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,329
I didn't... Did I say that?
No, I didn't.

1152
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:58,099
Turn it off!

1153
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:01,969
Turn it off now, or you're
all fired, you idiots!

1154
01:25:02,897 --> 01:25:04,672
<i>Kid, the truth
is overrated, all right?</i>

1155
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:06,507
<i>Just admit you stole my idea.</i>

1156
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:10,113
<i>Fine. Fine, fine,
fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.</i>

1157
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:12,182
<i>I admit</i> it.
{stole Big Fat Liar.

1158
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:14,247
<i>You gave me your
stupid little paper</i>

1159
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:16,653
<i>in the backseat of my car,
and I stole it!</i>

1160
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:19,750
<i>You happy now?</i>

1161
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:21,958
<i>God, I'm gonna die!</i>

1162
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:25,192
How did you get that?

1163
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:27,460
I just destroyed your phone.

1164
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:29,961
There's this new thing
these days called "email."

1165
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:34,773
I sent the video as
soon as I got it. Duh.

1166
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:37,169
You know, for the head of
an interactive division,

1167
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:39,973
you really don't know
too much about technology.

1168
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:42,714
Mr. Highcroft,
I can explain.

1169
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,784
This is all a big
misunderstanding. It's...

1170
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:47,217
You have 15 minutes
to clear out your desk.

1171
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,050
It's a trick.
It's just a big...

1172
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:51,213
Jimmy?

1173
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:52,881
It's a trick!
Gee, Wolf...

1174
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,120
Looks like nobody believes
anything you say anymore.

1175
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:08,163
Ah!

1176
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,975
<i>Et tu, Jimmy?</i>

1177
01:26:14,068 --> 01:26:19,177
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't understand
Latin. Must be all the steroids.

1178
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:26,423
See ya, Wolf.

1179
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,837
So <i>Big Fat Liar was your</i> idea?

1180
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:43,406
Yes, sir.

1181
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:46,236
Well, then show them.

1182
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:53,214
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1183
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:57,946
<i>I'm proud to introduce my...</i>

1184
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:02,259
<i>- Our new game”.
- Yeah!</i>

1185
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,022
Big Fat Liar.

1186
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:49,768
Dad?

1187
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:52,301
Congratulations, son.

1188
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,612
Dad, what are you doing here?
How did you...

1189
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:56,274
Becca called her parents,

1190
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:59,011
and her parents called me,
and, well, here we are.

1191
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:01,451
Dad, I'm so sorry.

1192
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:03,420
For everything. I promise
to never lie again.

1193
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:05,185
We can talk about that later,

1194
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:09,023
but right now,
I think they want you.

1195
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:20,500
Kevin, I'm so proud of you.

1196
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:53,031

01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:00,671

1200
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:02,180
Yeah, Dad?

1201
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:05,843
Two tickets to San Francisco?
First-class?

1202
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:07,716
Do you have any idea
how much that cost?

1203
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:10,050
Oh, right. Here.

1204
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:13,088
You can take it
out of my royalty check.

1205
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:17,057
<i>Sales for the gaming industry are
up 12% this year based on...</i>

If that's not enough,

1207
01:29:18,252 --> 01:29:19,732
there should be another one
next week.

1208
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:21,931
Uh-huh.

1209
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,467
<i>New graphics chip set,

<i>to climb well into Christmas.</i>

1211
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:33,936
Something very heavy
at the end of this rope!

1212
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:38,608
It's a large rock!

1213
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:41,282
Here, I'm gonna pick it up.

1214
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:48,355
The wind!
The Wind's coming!

1215
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:50,794
The wind! Wait a minute!
The wind...

1216
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:56,358
Oh, lookit, there's money flying
around in the wind! In the hat!

1217
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:58,097
That's where the money goes!

1218
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:05,468
That's where the money goes!

1219
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:08,805
I'm in a glass box.

1220
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,749
You suck.

1221
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:15,812
No! You suck!

1222
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:19,922
I don't go to your job and show
you how to use the plunger, do I?

1223
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,429
No, I don't!

1224
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:29,123
I'm in a box, a glass box.

1225
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:42,444
Is there a teddy
bear in the room?

1226
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:45,412
You know, I wouldn't bother...

1227
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:52,814
There it is.

1228
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:54,757
Let's cut the cameras.

1229
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:58,262
Cut! Good.

1230
01:30:58,319 --> 01:30:59,821
No, not good.

1231
01:31:07,195 --> 01:31:10,335
Uh-huh. One more.

1232
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:13,970
It's for emergencies only.
You got that?

1233
01:31:16,671 --> 01:31:18,014
Yeah. I got it.

1234
01:31:18,773 --> 01:31:20,548
When I'm standing in his office.

1235
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:22,313
Cut.
Ah, 'Cause...

1236
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:24,219
He's got a tail.
My thing is...

1237
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:25,382
Cut.

1238
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:42,866
Don't worry about it.
It's just a little white lie.

1239
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,833
Hold on. Hang on a second.
I got another call.

1240
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:48,570
Cut.

1241
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:57,652
Lady!

1242
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:01,759
This turned into
a one-act play!

1243
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:07,722
First of all,
this was unplugged.

1244
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:28,746
A mark.

1245
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:37,958
And cut!

1246
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:44,692
Good morning!

1247
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:47,433
Can I sit here?

1248
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:50,106
Perfect. ls that
okay for you?

1249
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:55,907
I can't! I can't
get it off! What?

1250
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:58,246
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna...

1251
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:04,481
I'm gonna kill you!
Kill you!

1252
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:05,956
Cut, cut, cut!

1253
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:10,727
A mark.
No, no, no.

1254
01:33:12,787 --> 01:33:14,095
Mark it, baby.

1255
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:17,927
I know, I looked at her for a
second, and then I looked away.

1256
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:22,168
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry "aboot" that.
Sorry, sorry...

1257
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,504
- Still rolling.
- Rolling!

1258
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:26,786
She can't wait to
be done with me.

1259
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:28,242
And...

1260
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:31,675
Come back.

1261
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:33,113
And cut.

1262
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:35,978
So I can stay...

1263
01:33:37,745 --> 01:33:38,951
Cut.

1264
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:53,337
Cut! Good.

1265
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:56,699
And that, my darlings,
is a wrap.
