174
00:09:15,243 --> 00:09:19,509
- [Abnermal Head] Vetvix is my master.
- [Screams]

175
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:22,606

- All hail Vetvix.

[Groaning]

177
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:27,944
Hmm?

178
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:30,885
Your Pet Force is no match for me.

179
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:33,153

Got it!

183
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:51,379

Garzooka!

190
00:10:09,497 --> 00:10:11,488
I must return, Professor.

191
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:14,534
My teammates are under Vetvix's control.

192
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:17,901
And only the moscram ray gun
can unscramble them.

193
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:21,305
<i>We've got to keep</i>
<i>the Klopman Crystal far away.</i>

194
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:25,345
That'll buy you time to create
a temporary Pet Force to defeat her.

195
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:28,883
- Create another Pet Force?
- Exactly.

196
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,850
First, I'll scan the universe
for D.N.A. matches.

197

198

<i>Aha! There they are-</i>

199

D.N.A. matches to your
Pet Force teammates.

<i>- [Pounding]</i>
<i>- [Vetvix] Open up!</i>

Come on, come on.

202
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,368
But they don't look anything like them.

203
00:10:51,473 --> 00:10:54,271
They will when they drink
the matching green serum.

204
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:58,607
When they do, they'll gain
the Pet Force's superpowers.

205
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:01,045
The red serum will turn them
back to their normal forms.

206
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:04,550
- Program the coordinates into my rover.
<i>- Let us in!</i>

207
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:10,252
Hurry, Garzooka!
It's a dangerous journey.

208
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:12,622
You'll have to cross
the interdimensional barrier.

209
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:14,695
You can count on me, Professor Wally.

210
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:18,357
No asteroid storm
or exploding supernova can stop me.

211
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:21,094
<i>- Open up!</i>
- The Pet Force shall rise again...

212
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:24,194
- to battle the insidious-
- Escape now!

213
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:27,604

- Yah!

214
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,974

[Grunts]

216
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:40,415
I'll get Garzooka if
it's the last thing I do.

"Will Vetvix capture Garzooka and use the
moscram ray gun to conquer the universe?

of <i>Pet Force</i> and find out!"

219
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:53,934
- [Garfield Sighs]
- Oh, wow! What a cool story!

220
00:11:54,035 --> 00:11:55,935
What's so cool about it?

221
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:58,403
It's just a gimmick
to make you buy the next issue.

222
00:11:58,506 --> 00:12:01,942
Speaking of which,
the supersized anniversary "ish"...

223
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:06,139
has a gold foil-stamped, embossed
holographic glow-in-the-dark cover!

Get a life, Nermal.
You don't really believe that stuff, do you?

227
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:17,523
It's not like real life-
[Munching]

228
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,820
like here in the newspaper comics.

229
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:21,623
What if it <i>is</i> real, Garfield?

230
00:12:21,729 --> 00:12:24,698
I used to imagine myself
the cool ruler of an entire planet.

Uh, stab me another hot dog there,
Your Highness.

233
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:32,304
Seriously, wouldn't it
be great to get out there...

234
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:34,705
and really do something
that meant something?

235
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,676
Sounds like that would
mean actually, uh...

236
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:39,747
getting involved.

237
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:42,782
[Gasps]
That takes a lot of effort.

238
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:46,012
Anything worth doing requires effort.

239
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,055
Nothing ventured,
nothing ventured, I say.

240
00:12:49,157 --> 00:12:51,057

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,560
Well, anything would be more exciting...

243
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:57,631
than sitting around here watching
pickle relish dribble down your chin.

Oh. Since when did you
start reading comics?

I'm just lookin' at the pictures.

249
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,007
Mmm, Garzooka's pretty easy on the eyes.

250
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:16,709
