Hi.

I'm Betty Hammond.
I was a friend of Phyllis'.
I'm so sorry for your loss.

686
00:45:57,465 --> 00:46:00,165
Thank you.
Well, my family just left

687
00:46:00,265 --> 00:46:02,765
and I made way too much food

688
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:06,498
so I thought I would drop off
some of my leftovers.

689
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,565
Well, thanks very much.

690
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:15,231
I'd love to chat,
but my daughter is here
visiting from up north.

691
00:46:15,331 --> 00:46:19,131
Oh, no problem.
When I come back
to pick up the dish

692
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:21,531
then we'll have
a nice long chat

693
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:24,665
and then we'll really
get to know each other.

694
00:46:25,498 --> 00:46:26,864
Okay. Sure.

695
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,398

Okay.

00:46:48,265 --> 00:46:51,565
Right now.
Chill out. I'm coming.

700
00:46:58,997 --> 00:47:01,298
I can't believe
you brought pot
on the plane

701
00:47:01,398 --> 00:47:03,897
and you're smoking it
in your grandparents' house.

702
00:47:03,997 --> 00:47:07,097
For your information,
I did not bring pot
the plane.

703
00:47:07,198 --> 00:47:11,030
I'm not that stupid.
I found it in Nana's closet.

704

Oh, yeah, right.

705
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,064
Ask Pops.

Dad?
Could you come here?

707
00:47:24,531 --> 00:47:26,198
I'm sorry to get you
involved in this, Dad,

708
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:29,764
but Molly says
she found marijuana
in Mom's closet.

709
00:47:29,864 --> 00:47:32,997
Oh, yeah.
I forgot that.

710
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:36,730
She took it for the pain.
A lot of people
on chemotherapy do.

711
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:40,764
I even tried it once
to keep her company,
but it gave me a headache.

712
00:47:40,864 --> 00:47:43,698
Dad. You smoked pot?

00:47:44,665 --> 00:47:46,198
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

714
00:47:46,298 --> 00:47:50,165
but with
all that was going on,
I never thought to mention it.

715
00:47:53,764 --> 00:47:55,665
Why don't we all
have some breakfast?

716
00:47:55,764 --> 00:47:57,097
I'll make the coffee.

ahead of us.

on a fucking plane.

Did you know Nana wanted
to be a psychiatrist?

720

I read it in her diary.
No.

721
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,531
I just thought
she wanted to get married
and have kids.

722
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:23,030
Actually,
she always regretted
marrying so young

723
00:48:23,131 --> 00:48:24,797
and then not
going to college.

that maybe
if your family has left,

732

we can get together sometime.

I have to admit, uh,

nervous coming here.

all these weird stories

gonna believe this.

brought a camera.

that dinner reservation,

771

What's the matter?
Are you shy?

780
00:52:50,064 --> 00:52:54,298
No, no. It's just that
you're very different
than the other women I know.

781
00:52:54,398 --> 00:52:57,430
I mean, the last woman
who came on to me
like this was,

782
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:02,064
you know, way back
when I was in the army
and she was a hooker.

783
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:08,131
You know, I think
we got kind of
a weird situation here.

784

I mean, I don't want you
to take it the wrong way,

785
00:53:10,597 --> 00:53:13,830
but this isn't exactly
what I had in mind tonight.

786
00:53:14,764 --> 00:53:16,231
You don't like me.

787
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:19,897
No, no. I like you a lot.
You're a wonderful gal.

788

But, look, if you could
use a little cash...

I'm worth more than that?

something I really needed,
like an accountant.

can't understand this.

Well, then just put it aside.
I won't pay it.

so why should I have
life insurance?

figure this out.

on a date some time.

He owns a car dealership
down in Boca

808

and his wife passed away
last year and
he's looking to go out.

Well, if he's so nice,
why don't you go out with him?

I'm already interested in,

has your husband been dead?

Why do you still go
to a bereavement club?

815
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:55,165
Oh, I didn't go there
for my husband,
I went there for Matthew.

and lived with me.

there's nothing like
losing your child.

No.

825
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:24,964
Anyhow, one day somebody
knocked on my door

826
00:55:25,064 --> 00:55:27,797
and they invited me
to the bereavement club.

827
00:55:29,397 --> 00:55:32,364
When I first walked
into that meeting,
I felt like a Martian.

828
00:55:32,464 --> 00:55:35,430
Nothing in common
with any of those people.

829
00:55:36,897 --> 00:55:40,030
But they were so kind.

830
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:43,930
I didn't have any family
so they became like my family

831
00:55:45,364 --> 00:55:47,930
and I'm sure that's why
I keep going back.

832
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:55,330
You know, I...

833
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:57,864
I can't make heads or tails
out of this.

834
00:55:57,964 --> 00:56:00,730
Maybe you need to call
your insurance broker.

835
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:03,997
Do you have his number?

836
00:56:04,097 --> 00:56:08,430
Yeah. I think
Marty has his number
in his desk. I'll go look.

841
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,131
I found it hidden
under our tax returns.

842
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,297
I can't believe
Marty watched this.

843

Typical guy stuff.
Have you ever watched one?

845
00:56:47,697 --> 00:56:50,630
I did.
It was very educational.

1016
01:08:22,763 --> 01:08:27,330
Listen. I've got
a frozen tuna casserole
in the refrigerator.

1017
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:29,763
I have a confession to make.

1018
01:08:29,863 --> 01:08:31,663
I brought along a backup.

1019
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:34,430
What do you mean, a backup?

1020
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:36,729
I have a lasagna
in the trunk of my car.

1021
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:38,596
A lasagna?

1022
01:08:38,696 --> 01:08:42,463

I was a Girl Scout.

1023
01:08:42,563 --> 01:08:44,130
Always prepared.

1024
01:08:49,496 --> 01:08:52,397
Next time I'm taking you out
to a nice restaurant.

1025
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,896
You're a good sport.
You deserve it.

1026
01:08:55,996 --> 01:08:58,663
Well, that would be nice.

1027
01:09:00,063 --> 01:09:02,029
Do you like music, Jack?

1028
01:09:03,529 --> 01:09:05,297
Phyllis loved classical.

1029
01:09:05,397 --> 01:09:07,430
Good. What about you?

1030
01:09:07,529 --> 01:09:10,796
I guess. I mean,
who doesn't like music?

I do, I do, but...

It's okay.
You can turn around.
I'm covered.

1050

Don't you find me attractive?

1051
01:10:47,996 --> 01:10:49,130
I do.

1052
01:10:54,629 --> 01:10:56,130
Should we lie down on the bed?

you're on Phyllis' side.

You want me to change sides?

1058

for a long time.

half a chance, you might
actually enjoy yourself.

I think, if you took
this class
a little more seriously,

1147
01:18:17,596 --> 01:18:21,129
you could develop
your natural inner talent.

1148

Really?
Yes.

01:18:25,196 --> 01:18:28,496
Hey, Harry's got
inner talent.

1150
01:18:28,596 --> 01:18:31,363
Ask the ladies. I've got
outer talent, too.

1151
01:18:34,062 --> 01:18:35,928

Word of advice.
These dames are shrewd.

1155
01:18:45,263 --> 01:18:49,229
Next thing you know,
she'll be moving in and
you'll be playing canasta.

1156
01:18:49,329 --> 01:18:50,928
So take it slow.

1157
01:18:55,463 --> 01:18:57,696

so delicious.

Me either,

1161
01:19:03,529 --> 01:19:05,129
but you deserve it.

1162
01:19:05,229 --> 01:19:07,496

was all mine.

improve with age.

1166
01:19:18,396 --> 01:19:20,196
Especially the shy ones.

1167
01:19:21,596 --> 01:19:23,563
You know,
I was married 45 years

1168
01:19:23,663 --> 01:19:26,028
and you're the only woman
that I've ever been with.

1169
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:29,995
I'm sure you were
a very loyal husband, Jack.

Wow. It's been a while.
You look fantastic.

it's my honeymoon.

ANDI: Hi, Jack.
Nice to meet you.

1181
01:20:06,596 --> 01:20:10,163
Well, we'd better go.
It was nice seeing you both

1182
01:20:10,263 --> 01:20:13,663
and, Sandi,
you look wonderful.

1183
01:20:13,763 --> 01:20:15,995
Have a wonderful dinner,
okay?

1184
01:20:24,795 --> 01:20:26,296
I'm confused.

1185
01:20:26,396 --> 01:20:28,163
That was Leonard,
your husband?

1186
01:20:28,263 --> 01:20:29,296
Yeah.

1187
01:20:31,396 --> 01:20:33,263
I thought he was dead?

Well, maybe he never
actually said that.
