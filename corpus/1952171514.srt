1
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,568
Gently.

2
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,743
Can you get a better view?

3
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,122
Omar, a meter to your left.

4
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:47,464
Be careful where you step.|You might kill us all.

5
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,516
Land mines.

6
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:02,813
In the Middle East, they're everywhere.|Just walk into a field and help yourself.

7
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,946
We will use these to strike terror|into the hearts of our enemies.

8
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:14,491
For a man who is willing to die|for his cause...

9
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,785
cannot be stopped.

10
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,498
- Don't you agree, my friend?|- Of course.

11
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,670
But first, we must kill all the frauds,|all the imposters...

12
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,965
and... all the double agents.

13
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,467
You understand.

14
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:39,391
Excellent. So far everything's going|as planned.

15
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,540
Halir's group is called Bright Star.

16
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,127
Their goal is to destroy|all symbols of modern decadence.

17
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,756
Their weapon of choice: suicide bombings.

18
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,884
The bombs are constructed|from land mines...

19
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,470
so the materials can't be traced.

20
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,431
Last night we sacrificed a mole...

21
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,560
in order to protect|a more important contact:

22
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,479
Gregory Formitz.

23
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,901
A dealer in forged documents,|passports, visas, press credentials.

24
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,738
He supplies Bright Star with fake IDs.

25
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,618
If we control Formitz,|we have a chance to stop Bright Star.

26
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,957
We've been brought into this one|a little late. So we have to play catch-up.

27
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,959
We need any intel we can get.

28
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,295
Michael, it's all yours.

29
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,050
You'll be our liaison with Formitz.

30
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,013
Madeline has prepared a profile.|You may find it useful.

31
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:53,483
Formitz is from a wealthy family.|Intelligent, well-educated.

32
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,029
He ranked first in his class|at medical school.

33
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,655
Medical school?

34
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,949
He dropped out|three days before graduation.

35
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,242
Because?

36
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,912
He was a younger son, a rebel.

37
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:09,082
He wanted to cause his family|the maximum amount of disappointment.

38
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,043
Did it work?

39
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,420
Yes. They never spoke to him again.

40
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:18,133
His alliance with terrorists arose partly|as a way of continuing to rebel...

41
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,928
partly because danger appeals to him.

42
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,932
So, betraying Bright Star to us makes|it even more dangerous.

43
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,558
Exactly.

44
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,770
So betraying us to Bright Star in turn...

45
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,273
might up the ante even further.

46
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,025
Very good.

47
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:39,071
Our analysis indicates there's little chance|of that happening soon.

48
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,699
But as time goes on,|the chance will increase. So be alert.

49
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,041
- Birkoff, you got a minute?|- No, not really.

50
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,049
- We want to tell you something.|- It'll have to wait.

51
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,595
We're getting married.

52
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,350
I asked her last night.|She accepted right away.

53
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,356
Okay, don't congratulate us or anything.|It's all right.

54
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,899
Congratulations.

55
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,527
I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.

56
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,446
Yeah, me, too. But you've got|to get lucky sometimes, right?

57
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,115
- When's the big day?|- Tomorrow.

58
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,034
I have to hurry because she might|come back to her senses.

59
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,578
That'll never happen.

60
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,542
- We just wanted you to know.|- Thanks. Congratulations.

61
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,002
See you later.

62
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,236
Hey, buy you a drink? Come on.

63
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,322
- Back off!|- Okay.

64
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,458
You go out when I tell you!

65
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,044
- I was sick.|- I decide when you're sick!

66
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,046
No! Don't!

67
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,508
I've been soft on you, huh?|Gonna change now-

68
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,634
Excuse me.

69
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,813
You get out, and don't come back.

70
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,364
You two all right?

71
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,408
It's just gonna be worse|when he comes back.

72
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,369
He won't come back.

73
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,915
Thanks.

74
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,512
Formitz?

75
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,389
- You're my contact?|- That's right.

76
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,015
You just took out that pimp?

77
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,601
Idiot, the idea is to maintain a low profile.

78
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,312
This is not gonna work. I'm out of here.

79
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,148
Sit down.

80
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,861
Let go of me.

81
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,531
If you don't sit down,|I'm gonna make a scene...

82
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,450
that'll give you|the highest profile in this neighborhood.

83
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,077
Sit down.

84
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,543
Fine. But from now on,|we attend to our business...

85
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,504
and we let other people|attend to theirs. All right?

86
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:49,553
- You do business with Bright Star.|- Yeah.

87
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:54,016
We want copies of all IDs and credentials|you provide them with.

88
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,309
Not the way it works.

89
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,020
Halir, their main man, calls me,|tells me where to meet.

90
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,063
I bring the blanks, he brings the pictures.

91
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,774
He watches me make the IDs,|takes them when I'm done.

92
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,736
There are no copies. Except up here.

93
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:11,783
- I need names and descriptions.|- What would I need?

94
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:16,997
Give me your bank account information.|You'll have the money within an hour.

95
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,541
Just like that, huh?

96
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:24,505
Of course, if I'm lying,|I never get the chance to spend it, do I?

97
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,427
Names.

98
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:35,516
I only have one, so far.|Ahmed Mujani. Posing as a journalist.

99
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,269
- Going where?|- First stop, Beirut. After that, I don't know.

100
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,604
When?

101
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,982
Halir didn't say.|But I got the impression very soon.

102
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,283
See you again.

103
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,870
Ahmed Mujani.|Formitz says he's the bomber.

104
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:57,996
Where is he?

105
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,582
From Beirut he went to Berlin,|then to Hamburg.

106
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,460
He checked into the Milo Hotel last night.

107
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,505
Cross-ref the hotel with potential targets.

108
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,512
It's three blocks from|the International Trade Center.

109
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,515
I'll assemble a team.|You prepare the tactical.

110
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,112
Nikita. Status?

111
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,533
The delegates are all inside.|There's over 100 in one room.

112
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,578
They've been screened.|He'll come from out here.

113
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:47,629
- Michael, report.|- The security team hasn't seen him.

114
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,884
- He could be disguised.|- We're aware of that.

115
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,354
Craig, check out the elderly lady|with the shopping bag.

116
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,606
I'm on it.

117
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,651
Excuse me, ma'am.

118
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,237
Got the target.

119
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,170
Let's go.

120
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,430
What's up?

121
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:24,351
- Walter and Belinda are getting married.|- That's great!

122
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,604
No, it's not great. Belinda's in abeyance.

123
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:32,192
She's scheduled for the Rio mission.|There's no way she's coming back.

124
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,654
Is there anything that you can do?

125
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:39,324
I took her off abeyance once before.|Operations found out.

126
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,369
Do you think I should tell Walter?

127
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:47,666
There's no point. Just let them|be as happy as long as they can.

128
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,502
Look, I gotta go and meet Formitz.

129
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,589
You're gonna be on comm.|Take down the names. Okay?

130
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,675
Yeah. Okay.

131
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,520
The bomb came from|cannibalized land mines, as we expected.

132
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:12,482
- What about the detonator?|- It's another dead end.

133
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,694
Garden variety. Could have come|from a thousand sources.

134
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,579
Did the bomber go in the bus depot|as an evasive maneuver...

135
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,457
or was that his intended destination?

136
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,251
It was his intended destination.

137
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,045
You're sure?

138
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:37,257
It was my impression during the mission,|and the tapes confirmed it.

139
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,637
Then we're facing an extreme situation.

140
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:45,224
They're targeting innocent people|in public places.

141
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,142
Anywhere, anytime.

142
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,230
Formitz is the key more than ever.

143
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:54,566
- He and Nikita are getting along?|- Well enough.

144
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:59,154
- She's meeting him again this afternoon.|- Good. Keep me informed.

145
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,084
Birkoff, he's not here.

146
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,420
He'll show. He was late|last time, too, remember?

147
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,885
Okay, it's over an hour.|This guy needs to learn manners.

148
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,095
What's his address?

149
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,389
We agreed to stay clear ofhis home.

150
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,850
Birkoff, give me his address.

151
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,691
3301 Van der Weil.

152
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,869
Hey.

153
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,997
- What's up?|- Nothing.

154
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,630
Erica, the girl I was with before...|I can't find her.

155
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,468
She never stays with a trick.|That's one of her rules.

156
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,971
And she wouldn't break it.

157
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,308
Especially with what's been happening.

158
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,644
What's been happening?

159
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,484
Girls have been disappearing.

160
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,654
And they find them...

161
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,701
- What, murdered?|- Mutilated.

162
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,456
I mean, she should have been home|hours ago.

163
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,958
She's my friend.

164
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:39,671
- What's your name?|- Danielle. Yeah.

165
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,759
Listen, Danielle, I'm sure|that Erica's gonna turn up.

166
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,096
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

167
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,890
What the hell is this?

168
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,642
- Where have you been?|- Occupied!

169
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,936
You're not supposed to come to my house.

170
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,647
Yesterday, I saw 40 people die.

171
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,692
Some of them were children.

172
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,611
I don't want|to see that again, understand?

173
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,405
Maybe I lost track of time.

174
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,115
Don't be late next time.

175
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,992
Who pays for my lock?

176
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,411
You do.

177
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,874
- You had a meeting with Halir last night?|- Yeah.

178
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,959
Names.

179
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,380
Three. I wrote them down yesterday.

180
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,552
When's your next meeting?

181
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,096
He'll call.

182
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,433
You'll let me know.

183
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,410
Where did you find this?

184
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,122
It's my sister's.

185
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,132
You're lying.

186
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,136
It belongs to a girl called Erica.

187
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,806
She was at the bar last night.

188
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,269
So what?

189
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,064
So, she's missing.

190
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,068
Missing. What does that mean?

191
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,154
Why don't you tell me?

192
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,911
Where is she?

193
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,790
I'm the only contact|you have with Bright Star.

194
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,834
Without me, you can't stop them.

195
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,169
Where's Erica?

196
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,299
You want to see her?

197
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:32,219
Yes.

198
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,474
Sure. Why not?

199
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,937
Come on. You can say hi.

200
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,555
It's not cheap or casual.|I spend a long time selecting them.

201
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,766
It's like I know them.

202
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,981
It means something, you know?

203
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,755
Why didn't you tell me?

204
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,925
He's a very frightened man.

205
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,887
Murder gives him a feeling|of being in control.

206
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,682
I know Section makes compromises.

207
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,478
But he's Jack the Ripper.

208
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,606
We need him.

209
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,530
Shall I tell you what he does?

210
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,824
That won't be necessary.

211
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,703
It's simple arithmetic.

212
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:25,165
We sacrifice a few lives to save hundreds.

213
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,084
Stay focused on the mission.

214
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,507
Try remembering the faces of the people|at the bus depot...

215
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,634
just before the explosion.

216
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,878
Did you know about Formitz?

217
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,464
He just contacted us.|You beat the hell out of him.

218
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,009
I can't go back there.

219
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,762
If I do, I'll kill him.

220
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,312
You will go back.

221
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,107
You will not kill him.

222
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,574
I want to apologize for what I did.

223
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:26,161
I'm sorry. The body was just|a little bit of a shock.

224
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,205
I believe you collect stamps.

225
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,296
A Belgian Jubilee. Very nice.

226
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,007
Come in.

227
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,409
I was right, wasn't I?

228
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,870
It doesn't matter what I do.

229
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,414
You need me.

230
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:19,590
It feels great having someone to tell.|It makes it even better.

231
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,884
I don't want to hear it.

232
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:26,889
I've already picked the next girl.|It's that friend of Erica's. The young one.

233
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,726
You leave her alone.

234
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:33,687
No. I've already decided.

235
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,817
See, I dreamt about it|from the first time I saw them together.

236
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,569
Now, I'm doing it.

237
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,996
- Don't you touch her.|- Or what?

238
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,806
The Rio team leaves|in a couple of minutes.

239
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,434
I'd like you to give Walter|a message for me.

240
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:15,103
Give it to him yourself when you get back.

241
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,065
You know I'm not coming back.

242
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,571
Tell him he's the best man|I've ever known.

243
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,199
I love him.

244
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:31,787
And it's not such a bad thing|to die on the happiest day of your life.

245
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,872
Will you tell him that for me?

246
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,334
Sure.

247
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:39,795
Thanks.

248
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:20,961
$200 for one hour.|You ever made that much before?

249
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:22,963
Sure.

250
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,926
Liar. Let's go.

251
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:36,894
Hey!

252
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,979
Get lost, right now.

253
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:42,441
Look. Are you sure about this?|Have you thought it through?

254
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:46,653
Put your hands on her again|and I'll kill you.

255
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,449
- Get lost!|- Okay.

256
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:03,212
What do you think you're doing?|He was going to pay me $200-

257
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,713
Erica's dead.

258
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:08,008
No.

259
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:10,719
Was she...

260
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,725
She was murdered by the man|that you were just talking to.

261
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,186
No.

262
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:22,940
- You're a cop.|- No, I'm not.

263
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,067
- But you'll go to the cops.|- No, I can't.

264
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,653
- Why not?|- Because I just can't.

265
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,113
Let's just get your things and go.|Come on.

266
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:31,323
Where?

267
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,867
Someplace safe.|Just get your things and we'll go.

268
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,953
- No, I need to work.|- Not tonight, you don't.

269
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:38,497
No, I'll stay away from him.|I mean, I'll work-

270
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,999
He'll find you. He'll track you down.

271
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,920
He'll torture you and then|he's gonna kill you. Do you understand?

272
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:47,840
- You're scaring me.|- Good. Get your things.

273
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:51,426
- I don't even know your name.|- It's Nikita. Let's go.

274
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,256
You'll be okay here.

275
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,592
How long am I supposed to stay here?

276
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,303
I don't know.|Until I say you can go out again.

277
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:37,264
If you need money, I'll get you some.

278
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:39,474
Who are you?

279
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:44,271
- Do you have someplace to go?|- No, I don't.

280
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:46,982
Parents?

281
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:51,778
I'd rather die than go back to them, okay?|I mean that.

282
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,239
All right. No lectures.

283
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,994
But, Danielle, if you leave this room...

284
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,954
you will die.

285
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,875
Do you understand that?

286
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:12,382
I'll get back as soon as I can.|Promise me you won't leave until then.

287
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,301
Yeah, I promise.

288
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:18,388
Lock the door after I'm gone.

289
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,749
- No mission?|- No.

290
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:50,003
What did you call me in for?

291
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,256
Where were you?

292
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,595
No place in particular.

293
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,310
Formitz's last intel was accurate.

294
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:09,356
One of our teams in Prague|was able to prevent the bombing.

295
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,441
Good.

296
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:16,113
They took the bomber alive. It's a woman.

297
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:21,869
She might lead us directly to Halir.|We wouldn't need Formitz anymore.

298
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:26,039
- I thought you'd like to know.|- Thanks.

299
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:33,964
She broke?

300
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,217
No. And she won't.

301
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,429
It hasn't been that long.|How can you be sure?

302
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:41,847
I'm sure.

303
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,517
Perhaps if we just held off|for a little while...

304
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:48,562
and let her remember|what it's like not to feel pain.

305
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:51,440
Then suddenly hit her with it.

306
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,526
It won't work.

307
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,361
Can I at least try?

308
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,397
We're finished. Let's go.

309
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,066
Where?

310
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:36,568
To a cell.

311
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,822
I'll stay here.

312
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:45,202
I said, we're finished.

313
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:49,456
I had a son.

314
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,044
He was three when they came to my|house and murdered him and my husband.

315
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:57,005
I no longer feel pain...

316
00:29:57,631 --> 00:30:00,008
and I do not fear death.

317
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:04,680
You will give me comfort...

318
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:07,766
then begin again, worse than before.

319
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:12,020
What will you do,|break every bone in my body?

320
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:29,413
What else do you wish to break?|I'll save you the trouble.

321
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,506
An embassy in Vienna, an airport|in Istanbul, another in Bucharest.

322
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,592
All within the last four days.

323
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:45,679
- Bright Star?|- They're picking up the pace.

324
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,184
We can't just intercept the bombers.|We have to get to Halir himself.

325
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:53,729
- What about the prisoner?|- She's very unlikely to crack.

326
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:57,357
If we have to use Formitz,|we'll have to do it quickly.

327
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:02,196
They're starting to use other forgers.|They may not need him much longer.

328
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:06,158
We'll have him set up a meeting|with Halir. Someplace we can access.

329
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,244
Formitz will be extremely reluctant|to take that kind of risk.

330
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:11,413
Nikita will have to persuade him.

331
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,958
Is that a problem?

332
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:21,381
The relationship between Formitz|and Nikita is not without difficulties.

333
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:23,300
Why is that?

334
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,511
She's become aware of his habit.

335
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:27,221
She has a job to do.

336
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:31,892
I would hate to feel that she's regressing.|Becoming sentimental again.

337
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:34,061
She's not.

338
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,940
Then can she or can she not|persuade Formitz to meet with Halir?

339
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:42,444
I'll go along.

340
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,827
- We need a contingency.|- I agree.

341
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:54,248
- Any ideas?|- One or two.

342
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:21,316
- Your boyfriend?|- A colleague.

343
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:26,029
- Three's a crowd.|- Deal with it.

344
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,534
When's your next contact with Halir?

345
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:35,455
Like I told her, he calls me.|Tells me what to bring, where to meet.

346
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:39,209
Next time will be different.|You'll set the terms.

347
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,212
It'll never happen.

348
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,842
You tell him you know the name|of a traitor inside his organization.

349
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:49,011
Do I?

350
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,430
One will be provided.

351
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,601
It's still risky. He'll be heavily guarded.

352
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,187
We can deal with that.

353
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:02,649
You set the meeting. We'll triple your fee.

354
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:08,155
And provide sanctuary afterwards.

355
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:11,283
Of course.

356
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:15,287
Now, I will need|certain other things as well.

357
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:18,457
- Such as?|- She knows.

358
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,375
Forget it.

359
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,965
I'll give you an hour to think it over.

360
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:37,726
He wants the girl.|He won't cooperate unless he gets her.

361
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:39,645
Where is she?

362
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:42,064
I don't know.

363
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:47,152
Michael, find another way.|Pay him more money. Threaten him.

364
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:50,989
He's unstable as it is.|Threats might spin him out of control.

365
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:53,617
Even if I knew where Danielle is...

366
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:57,162
I wouldn't give her to that monster.

367
00:33:57,412 --> 00:34:00,582
- I haven't said you should.|- That's what you're thinking.

368
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:04,419
You're gonna tell me to remember|those people at the bus depot.

369
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:05,963
Do you?

370
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:18,433
Good news.|The prisoner cooperated after all.

371
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,520
Gave us a way to Halir.

372
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:24,857
When I last saw her,|she was breaking her own bones.

373
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:27,609
You should have had more faith|in your own suggestion.

374
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:31,071
We let her rest, then brought her back in.|It worked.

375
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:34,575
- So there's no need for Formitz?|- Apparently not.

376
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:37,828
Halir will be meeting a courier|at 4:00 p. m...

377
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:39,746
in an Arab market in Berlin.

378
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:43,292
We'll tag the courier, follow him to Halir.

379
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:47,796
You'll remain in Section|to assist Birkoff with tactical overview.

380
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:50,674
Any other questions?

381
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,142
- Nikita, come with me.|- Birkoff, the mission-

382
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:03,353
- Walter just found out Belinda's dead.|- What?

383
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:09,359
Walter, you're scaring me.

384
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:11,403
What are you doing?

385
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:13,572
He asked for it, he's gonna get it!

386
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:15,365
You're gonna shoot Operations?

387
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:19,119
Right between the eyes.|Get out of my way!

388
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:25,751
Walter, I'm sorry Belinda's dead.|I'm sorrier than I can say.

389
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:30,422
How many times have you told me|not to take the Section personally.

390
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,090
I don't care what I told you!

391
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:35,010
It's pointless. They'll kill you, too!

392
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:37,179
I don't care!

393
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:38,597
I do!

394
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:42,100
So does Birkoff|and so do a lot of other people here!

395
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:46,355
We need you, Walter. I need you.

396
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,903
What would Belinda tell you to do?

397
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:55,239
Would she tell you|to throw your life away?

398
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,783
Or stay here for the people that need you?

399
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:03,247
It's not fair.

400
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:12,256
You've gotta go on, Walter.|You gotta go on.

401
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,844
That's what she would want.

402
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,348
What's happening here?

403
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,519
Nothing. We're just talking.

404
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:30,065
You and Birkoff|should be at your terminals.

405
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,109
I know. We're going now.

406
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,040
I'm sorry about Belinda.

407
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:06,852
The courier should arrive in a gray sedan.

408
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,648
Here he is.

409
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:20,199
He's on foot. Entering the square.

410
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,451
Team 1, tag him.

411
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:39,343
The courier's been tagged.

412
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:46,016
He's heading toward the northeast corner.

413
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:35,023
Hello, my friend.

414
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:38,735
What do you have for me today?

415
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,254
We've got Halir.

416
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,096
Perimeter status.

417
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:09,850
Perimeter's clear.

418
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:17,065
You can go.

419
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:26,051
Why was Formitz at the meet?

420
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:31,974
The original courier was detained.|We substituted Formitz...

421
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:35,185
a face Halir would trust.

422
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:40,899
- Why did he agree to help?|- More money.

423
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:46,488
No.

424
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,325
Section found Danielle|and gave her to him.

425
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:55,998
He knows his way around.|Perhaps he found her himself.

426
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:59,418
You called me in. Told me|about the prisoner. Let me interrogate her.

427
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:03,088
Meanwhile, Section was out|looking for Danielle. Isn't that right?

428
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:05,215
No.

429
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:09,678
Madeline lied when she told me|the prisoner broke.

430
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:12,848
Madeline wouldn't bother to lie.

431
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,725
She might.

432
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:18,687
To keep that mission running smoothly.

433
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:23,275
I want the truth, Michael.

434
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:27,321
Did the Section give Danielle to Formitz?

435
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:38,749
No.

436
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:53,388
What are you doing here?

437
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,351
Halir was taken.

438
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:00,354
- My God. Who took him?|- You know.

439
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:06,193
I don't. How would I know?

440
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,112
Because you betrayed him.

441
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:12,950
Are you crazy?

442
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:16,662
We have names. Dates.

443
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,922
They made me do it.

444
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:47,943
Formitz is dead.

445
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,906
Can't say I'm too sorry about that.

446
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:56,410
You don't seem to be surprised.

447
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:59,121
Dangerous line of work he's in.

448
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,958
His death compromises our ability...

449
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,211
to deal with the remnants|of Halir's organization.

450
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:09,298
We'll just have to find some other way.

451
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:12,759
This is important, Nikita.

452
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:15,804
I want the truth.

453
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:19,725
Did you give him up?

454
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:26,857
No.
