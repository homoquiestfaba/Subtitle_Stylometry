1
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,015
You're too late...

2
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,084
She died two hours ago.

3
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,468
The Relief Society sisters
are preparing her for burial.

4
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,844
Brother Johnson.

5
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:11,180
Your wife would like to talk to you.

6
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,961
My darling!

7
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,729
l had the most wonderful dream.

8
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:31,834
There was a man with white hair
and a full white beard

9
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,139
sitting here beside my bed.

10
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,708
He told me that l would bear
and raise seven daughters.

11
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,013
The man also said

12
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:48,219
there would be a time in life
when they would all stand together

13
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,156
and be a great joy to me.

14
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,960
<i>Being worthy
when your opportunity arrives</i>

15
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,592
<i>is a lesson it took me years to learn.</i>

16
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,964
<i>lt is, for me,</i>

17
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,130
<i>what a good life is all about.</i>

18
00:04:54,694 --> 00:05:00,189
<i>But as a boy, becoming a good man
was the furthest thing from my mind.</i>

19
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,373
<i>lt wasn't the first time l'd put Lindy
up wet,</i>

20
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,446
<i>but as it was Sunday,</i>

21
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,182
<i>Pa couldn't take it to me
'til the Sabbath had passed.</i>

22
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,845
<i>They went off to church
and that gave me time</i>

23
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:39,446
<i>to make the decision
to strike off on my own...</i>

24
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,955
<i>l've always loved the Sabbath.</i>

25
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,401
<i>l determined to show my parents</i>

26
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,302
<i>l could sort out what this life
is all about</i>

27
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,841
<i>and grow up
to become a good man.</i>

28
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:14,249
<i>l worked my way around
parts of the country for a time,</i>

29
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,260
<i>learned what they knew,
then found myself</i>

30
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,524
<i>in the United States Navy
on the USS Columbia!</i>

31
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:21,993
<i>Three years later</i>

32
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,501
<i>l was back where l began,
at the port of Boston.</i>

33
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,865
May have broke your china
on that one, eh?

34
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,068
-Get out a here.
-Be quick about it, Eph!

35
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,202
What!?

36
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,011
You lookin' for a bustin', mister?

37
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,546
That's quite a temper
you've developed there.

38
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,308
Yeah, so?

39
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,179
Where is your home?

40
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,052
Ohio.
Who's asking?

41
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,558
How long since you've been there?

42
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,396
Three years.
Now, who's asking?

43
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,899
Three years is a long time
from those you cherish.

44
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,906
Yeah. Well, l hope nobody's waiting
for me at the window

45
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,407
'cause l'm going to town,
changing ships

46
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,410
and off for another three years.

47
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:44,380
May l offer to watch your belongings
in your absence?

48
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,009
Now why would l ever...?

49
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,155
Yes, l'd be obliged, sir.

50
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,229
Thank you kindly.

51
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,959
Eph, quit your dawdling!

52
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,298
Time's a wastin'!
We got good times to be had tonight!

53
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:20,548
Ephraim? What kind of name
is Ephraim, anyway?

54
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:24,213
l haven't heard a name that peculiar
since those, huh...

55
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,325
those New Guinea blokes, eh?

56
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,324
Strange birds they were.

57
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,407
<i>As quickly as he had arrived,</i>

58
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,036
<i>the Man in the Grey Tweed Suit
was gone.</i>

59
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,943
<i>A new thought entered my head.</i>

60
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:57,517
<i>l made the decision to forgo
the Navy and return home.</i>

61
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:03,161
<i>Now, in my later years,
l see more clearly.</i>

62
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,287
<i>Though as a boy l had stayed
close to God,</i>

63
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,163
<i>as a sailor l was drifting
further and further away...</i>

64
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:15,401
<i>lt was time to return and make amends
with my parents.</i>

65
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,941
Acorn, that's a good boy.

66
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,642
Good boy.

67
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:35,284
l believe you took a wrong turn,
neighbor.

68
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,159
Mother?

69
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,259
lt's Eph!

70
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,237
Ephraim! Ephraim!

71
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,575
My boy!

72
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,114
Where was he buried?

73
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,381
Near the south oak.

74
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:06,720
Did he have an ailment?
What did he die of?

75
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,721
He was old, Ephraim.
He was 52.

76
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,260
During those years at sea, l...

77
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,998
l wanted to make you
and father proud.

78
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,574
Now l'll never know...

79
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:31,348
lf you have any regrets, son,
let them be for your brother Sidney.

80
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,247
Sid...

81
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,250
Where is Sidney?

82
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:38,220
He's been led away
by the terrible Mormons.

83
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,348
Mormons?

84
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,323
They have cast a spell upon him.

85
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,052
Where is he?

86
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,528
A-way out west, almost to the ocean,
in lllinois.

87
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,428
Well, then l will go and free him.

88
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:53,570
Yes, go...
as soon as you are able.

89
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,476
<i>Saving Sidney was
what my mother wanted...</i>

90
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,548
<i>and seemed to be an opportunity
to show her</i>

91
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,776
<i>l could do something good.</i>

92
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:12,455
<i>Looking back, it seems like evertyhing
that happened in my life</i>

93
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:15,492
<i>was a lesson
God wanted me to learn.</i>

94
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:20,588
<i>Like the morning a visitor stopped by
to teach me about keeping my head.</i>

95
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,322
<i>Some days,
lessons come one after another.</i>

96
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,330
<i>After taking the right path,
a strange despair fell upon me,</i>

97
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:11,603
<i>and l was overpowered
by a stupor of thought.</i>

98
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,702
What's the matter with me, Acorn?
l am a blathering idiot...

99
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,874
Must've taken a wrong path.

100
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,758
Something is amiss.

101
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,497
l do not know what to do.

102
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,275
Blessed Father,

103
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,888
it's been a long time
since l've done this.

104
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:01,220
<i>For the first time in years, l prayed.</i>

105
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,818
<i>Seems since l was a boy,
the Lord was always willing</i>

106
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,663
<i>to keep in touch with me if l was
willing to keep in touch with Him.</i>

107
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,794
<i>And though l'd been absent
without leave,</i>

108
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:16,669
<i>the Lord was quick to whisper
what l should be doing.</i>

109
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,746
l felt impressed to get
on back home.

110
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,876
Soon as l got there, l realized why.

111
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,917
Sidney!

112
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,490
Brother!

113
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:40,463
<i>Sidney had been told in a dream
he needed to go home.</i>

114
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,908
Son, l want you to do us both
a favor.

115
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,615
l want you to call on Pastor Reed
and Pastor Robbins.

116
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,777
lnvite them here Thursday next.

117
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,478
Just being sociable?

118
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,787
You and Sidney are home now.

119
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,915
l want no more of this Mormon rubbish.

120
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:15,593
They're good, Christian men.
They'll bring a Christlike message.

121
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,532
-A prophet in our day?!
-Prophets are a thing of the past!

122
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,570
Do you believe that God
is among us?

123
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,333
Most certainly!

124
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,964
''Surely the Lord God would do nothing

125
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,909
but He revealeth his secret
unto his servants prophets.''

126
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,514
Amos 3:7.

127
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,813
Well, if God did speak to man,

128
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:40,721
surely he would come to learned men
such as us!

129
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,758
We.

130
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,528
What?

131
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:49,600
Proper English is we: ''He would come
to learned men such as we.''

132
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,962
ln any case...

133
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,833
why would God reveal His word
to a young boy?!

134
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:02,345
Yes! Why would the Lord
speak to a young boy,

135
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,346
like He did Samuel?!

136
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,814
1st Samuel 3:4.

137
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,851
Gentlemen, it is my earnest
testimony given to me

138
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,086
by the spirit that Joseph Smith
is indeed a prophet of God.

139
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,693
And it is my testimony
that Joe Smith is a liar and a thief!

140
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:23,359
And to believe his stories sets you
among the weakest of morons!

141
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,903
And any man who would follow him
would rob his own mother!

142
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,373
Enough! You have crossed a line,
and l will hear no more!

143
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,137
Leave our home before l...

144
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,847
-Go, go, go!
-Get out!

145
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,024
You're not welcome
in Sunday School anymore!

146
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,924
And forget about the socials!

147
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,826
Get outta here!

148
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,758
And as a kid,
l hated your Sunday School class!

149
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,472
l am sorry, Mother...

150
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:17,051
But no one can slander my brother
while l am here.

151
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,890
( Mouthing words )
They forgot their hat!

152
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,473
Now why would he come
to a young boy?

153
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,843
No, he would come to learned men
such as us,

154
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,645
such as us, yup, yup.

155
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,955
Eph, you need to know that...

156
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:56,151
what l testified of to them is true.

157
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:03,862
God has come again to Earth
and angels minister to men.

158
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,836
l myself was about to die
from a serious rupture,

159
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,636
but through the laying on of hands,
l was healed.

160
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,580
You were healed?

161
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,844
The way Christ healed others?

162
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,625
Here, this is the Book of Mormon.

163
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,935
<i>That very night, l chose to cast my lot
with Sidney and the Mormons...</i>

164
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,740
<i>and another adventure
was about to begin.</i>

165
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,958
l should have known
the moment you returned.

166
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,051
What?

167
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,564
You always have been
and always will be trouble!

168
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,764
You abandoned us once
and you'll leave us again.

169
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,296
Mother, l'm just...

170
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,541
You bring only shame to your father
and embarrassment to me.

171
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,545
Because l seek to do what's right?

172
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,116
No! Because you only think
of your precious self!

173
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,584
lt's not within you
to become a good man.

174
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:10,761
<i>Once again, in my mother's eyes,
l had failed to be good.</i>

175
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,793
<i>So we did as she asked
and bid farewell...</i>

176
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,669
<i>then headed out
for the city of Joseph.</i>

177
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,803
<i>l had many questions,
but they were all answered,</i>

178
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,107
<i>and the determination
became strong within me</i>

179
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:34,242
<i>to be a defender of the gospel,
of Zion and her cause,</i>

180
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,752
<i>come what may.</i>

181
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,347
<i>The same year l was baptized,</i>

182
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:44,719
<i>a young man halfway around
the world was baptized also...</i>

183
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,764
<i>His name was Thomas Dobson.</i>

184
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,706
You have gifts, Thomas.

185
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,745
Let the spirit guide you
to foster them.

186
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,347
You can help others with them.

187
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,115
You Mormons!

188
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,291
Run, Thomas!

189
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,700
<i>Though l continually fell short,
l was trying to do better,</i>

190
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,243
<i>which helped me through
the death of Brother Joseph,</i>

191
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,836
<i>the Mormon Battalion
and many other trials.</i>

192
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,347
<i>At length, l made it
to the Salt Lake Valley</i>

193
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,853
<i>and thought to continue
my pursuits there in Zion.</i>

194
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:30,062
Sidney! You know what the worst thing
about multiple wives is?

195
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,870
Multiple mother-in-laws!

196
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:01,387
He thinks he's funny, but he's not.

197
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,365
Brother Brigham...
Arza.

198
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:13,008
Eph, there is something
that l would like you to do for me.

199
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,344
Before you spend another minute
in this place,

200
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:21,384
l want you to go home
and shave off that beard.

201
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,958
Yes, Brother.

202
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,972
Not a word.

203
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,583
l'm really not like my brother.

204
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,028
Well, what got into you?

205
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,003
l think the cat licked you clean.

206
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,069
l look like a peeled onion.

207
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:40,191
Brother Hanks,
did l ask you to shave?

208
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,558
Yes, Brother Brigham, you did.

209
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:47,502
Well, then, go on home
and do it right!

210
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,955
Now there is a man
that will give strict obedience,

211
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,118
regardless the nature of my request.

212
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:14,459
There is a man that l can trust
with the most important of missions.

213
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,988
Oh, marvelous, me boy, marvelous!

214
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,391
You truly have a gift, Thomas.

215
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,967
Someday you will be a great strength
to many that carry heavy burdens.

216
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:35,039
<i>Through those next years,
l contracted to carry the mail</i>

217
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,671
<i>from Salt Lake to St. Louis
and back.</i>

218
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,114
<i>l made the trip 'most 50 times...</i>

219
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:45,086
<i>so many times,
it became humdrum.</i>

220
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,134
<i>l crossed the plains
during any season of the year.</i>

221
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:04,037
<i>l got to where it did not matter
to me what the conditions were.</i>

222
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:07,474
<i>l was again being prepared.</i>

223
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,658
<i>On one such trip, l was warned
that an angry tribe</i>

224
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:27,128
<i>was camped a short distance
off the trail.</i>

225
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:32,328
<i>But rather than avoiding them,
l felt impressed to call on them.</i>

226
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,414
<i>l was taken to the chief's tent.</i>

227
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:54,217
<i>They were clearly very happy
l had made the effort to stop by.</i>

228
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,456
<i>l believe we are each given
certain gifts.</i>

229
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:24,797
<i>l was coming to realize one of mine.</i>

230
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,678
Oyez, oyez!

231
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:40,477
The Dobsons are departing for ''Zion''!

232
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,753
Come one, come all,

233
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,856
and buy of their goods!

234
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:51,693
Mother! How can you allow the crier
to pitch our name about?

235
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,854
He is announcing to all
our private plans.

236
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,559
Truth be told, you have no care at all
about our private plans.

237
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,932
-You are embarrassed.
-And perhaps l am!

238
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,699
l have no desire to travel
to some uncivilized desert,

239
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,741
full of wild beasts, where they have
no respect for the dance.

240
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,710
You have no desire
to leave your sweetheart!

241
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,680
But, Thomas, you know she will
never accept the church.

242
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,919
The Prophet has said, ''Go'',
and go we must,

243
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,388
for l know this to be the true church
of God.

244
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:25,519
Me boy, you've got
to lose your life to find it.

245
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:33,071
<i>Two months later, the Dobsons
were aboard the ship Horizon...</i>

246
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:37,064
<i>Two months later, the Dobsons
were aboard the ship Horizon...</i>

247
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,433
<i>and two months after that...</i>

248
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:53,380
Me boy, l can scarcely put
one foot in front of the other.

249
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:58,622
Let it be spoken again, Mother,
l wanted no part of this.

250
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,459
The Lord looks after His own, son.

251
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,965
For your efforts, you'll be blessed.

252
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,984
What be the trouble?

253
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,726
Trouble? Oh, there be no trouble...

254
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,800
just the matter of Jonathan Stone,
found eaten by the wolves.

255
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:37,832
No!

256
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,732
Brother Stone!

257
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,566
lt can't be!

258
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,800
lt can and it be.

259
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,660
Brother Dobson.

260
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,037
l'm told you dance the jig.

261
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:23,205
The Saints could use
a bit of cheerin' up at this time.

262
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,915
lt would mean much to us all.

263
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,815
They must have meant someone else...

264
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,887
not l.

265
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,173
<i>ln October 1856,</i>

266
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:01,080
<i>l had contracted for a load of fish,</i>

267
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,517
<i>which l pulled out of Utah Lake.</i>

268
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,623
<i>l stayed that night
at the cabin of Gerney Brown.</i>

269
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:09,055
We're building this brick wall,
and he says, ''Hey, Ephraim!

270
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,058
How thick is that brick wall?''

271
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:15,495
<i>ln many ways, l believe
my entire life had been a plan</i>

272
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:20,764
<i>so l might be prepared for what became
my greatest adventure.</i>

273
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,007
<i>Ephraim.</i>

274
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,741
<i>Ephraim.</i>

275
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,117
Yes, Brother Brown.

276
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:41,658
<i>The handcart people are in trouble,
and you are wanted.</i>

277
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,282
<i>Will you help them?</i>

278
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:50,265
Yes, l will go if l am called.

279
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:58,699
Ephraim! The handcart people
are in trouble, and you are wanted.

280
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,744
Will you help them?

281
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,541
Yes.

282
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,602
Well, what if they should bite us
in the night?

283
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:30,673
Oh, keep your hair on, there'll be
no wolf worries while l'm about.

284
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,710
There l was lying on the ground,
looking right into the eyes

285
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:38,838
of the biggest, meanest,
beastly wolf l'd ever seen.

286
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,780
l didn't know what to do.

287
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,013
Then a voice said to me,
''Poke him in the eye!''

288
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,282
So l poked him in the eye!

289
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,285
And you know what he did?

290
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,617
He whimpered like a little pup
and ran away,

291
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,161
never to bother me again,
and he won't bother you either.

292
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,992
They're frightened of me, you know.

293
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:56,758
Bless you, son.

294
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,932
The nights grow colder.

295
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,941
Are you keeping on, Thomas?

296
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,678
Not really, Mother.
l'd have to say, no, not really.

297
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:17,220
l've waited 19 years
to make this journey, Thomas,

298
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:21,189
and if we hang on a bit,
for the sure of it, we'll be blessed.

299
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:25,694
Well, let me tell you how l would like
to be blessed...

300
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,757
lf l have to hear that pipsqueak
say one more time

301
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:32,995
how he poked that wolf in eye,
l'm going to poke him in the eye!

302
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:46,942
l am sorry, l was only trying
to soothe their fears.

303
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,414
Thomas!

304
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,859
l am so sorry.

305
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,962
lt's been a hard time for him and...

306
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,126
Brother Dobson.

307
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,926
Brother Tyler.

308
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,368
Thomas, l have a calling for you.

309
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:15,142
l would like you to accept
position in the burial squad.

310
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,779
Are there so many now
that we require a squad?

311
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,724
Yes.

312
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,690
Thank you, brother.

313
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,743
Pardon me...

314
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,311
Pardon me, brother...

315
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,851
l do not know your name.

316
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,856
Are you dodging me?

317
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,169
Pardon...

318
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:21,043
lt is just difficult for me
to speak to a young girl...

319
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,276
a young, pretty girl...

320
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,211
when l have not bathed
in four weeks.

321
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,486
You haven't bathed in four weeks?

322
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,449
How remarkable.

323
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,995
You smell as if it's only been three!

324
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,430
Thank you.

325
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,245
<i>Next morning l headed
toward Salt Lake</i>

326
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:00,509
<i>to learn what Brother Brigham
would have me do.</i>

327
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,334
Are you Ephraim Hanks?

328
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,467
Who's asking?

329
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:29,171
Messenger from Brother Brigham!

330
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:36,112
<i>Turns out, right when l was goin'
looking for the prophet,</i>

331
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,881
<i>the prophet was looking for me.</i>

332
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:43,357
As l pronounced in Conference,
all the piety in the world

333
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,986
will not keep those souls
from harm's way.

334
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:50,294
We must show our faith
through our actions!

335
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:54,097
That is my religion
and that is the dictation

336
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,832
of the Holy Ghost that l possess.

337
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:03,174
Go and bring in those Saints
who are still on the plains.

338
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:06,613
l will get ready
and can start in a few days.

339
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:08,842
l can be ready on Thursday.

340
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,183
Brother Brigham...

341
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,458
l am ready now!

342
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:28,071
The Lord prepares each of us
for the purposes

343
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:31,902
that He has placed us on this Earth
to accomplish.

344
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,875
Moments are set
before each one of us

345
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,947
that, if we give
all that is within us,

346
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:45,147
will bring us to an ability
and power we have not before known.

347
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:51,118
<i>Though the days were still warm,
Brother Brigham knew</i>

348
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,422
<i>things would soon change.</i>

349
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:08,272
Those of you with strength at all
cross back and help the others!

350
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:12,109
Those of you with strength at all
cross back and help the others!

351
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:18,285
Those of you with strength at all
cross back and help the others!

352
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,482
Did you hear Captain Martin, Thomas?

353
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,517
They'll be fine.

354
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:31,225
Keep to your right!
There are perils on the left!

355
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,556
Keep to your right!

356
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:38,225
Brother Albert, would you do us
the honor of riding in our cart?

357
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,665
Superb!

358
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,265
Bless you for your goodness.

359
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,398
l am feeling a bit
under the weather today.

360
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,244
Normally, l would secure
myself across,

361
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:52,610
perhaps several others,
but today is an exception, to be sure...

362
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,015
l'm really quite a good swimmer,
you should see.

363
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,713
l can get across in no time, l'm sure.

364
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:01,786
Just not feeling very today.

365
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,117
l feel bad, l see these other people.

366
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,559
l feel as though l could help, but...oh!

367
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,393
That water is wet.

368
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,604
l'll see this across, sister.

369
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:19,766
Bless you, Captain.

370
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,774
Who will help us, Mommy?

371
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,447
The Lord helps those
who help themselves, Paul.

372
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:35,250
Now come about.
Let's be on with it.

373
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:43,195
Keep to your right!
There are deep holes on the left side!

374
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,615
Thank you so much.

375
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:05,085
lt's awfully deep, and, um...

376
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,280
Really, you did a great job.

377
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,553
l'm grateful to be across.
Really, bless you, brother. Thank you.

378
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,859
Steady on!

379
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,334
l did promise l would walk
every step of the way to Zion,

380
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,531
but l really don't think rivers count.

381
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,836
l mean, it's awfully deep
and awfully wet,

382
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,304
and l just don't think l would make it.

383
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:32,472
l mean, l am a pretty good swimmer,
but l don't...

384
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,292
Somebody... Hey!

385
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,325
Help!

386
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:52,531
Help!

387
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:03,440
Help us!

388
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,343
Somebody help them!

389
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:08,383
Save yourself
or you'll both be drowned!

390
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:10,315
We're drowning!

391
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,526
Here! Grab hold! Grab hold!

392
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:25,558
Leave him, let him go into the water!

393
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:30,300
No! He is my son!

394
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:39,477
Father, l need thy help! Father!

395
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:57,699
Under the bank!

396
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,894
She's over here!

397
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:17,447
l bear witness to each of you this day
that God lives!

398
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,818
He protected and saved me son
and me.

399
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,394
Without his help, we would now
be drowned in the water.

400
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:28,956
Any and all who hear my voice know

401
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,666
that a miracle has come
to pass this day

402
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,828
before your very eyes.

403
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,718
l brought you a gift.

404
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:31,894
My mother says that if one rubs
these leaves into one's hands,

405
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,691
it will soften and heal them.

406
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,400
May l?

407
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,613
ls it working?

408
00:50:58,655 --> 00:50:59,952
Yes.

409
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,991
For certain, it is working.

410
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:08,822
Brother Dobson.

411
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,993
He helped everyone he could.

412
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,065
Oh, Albert.

413
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:34,646
He's fine now, children.
He is right with the Lord.

414
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,417
Let me.

415
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:44,493
Please, allow me.

416
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:53,134
He gave everything for the gospel.

417
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,495
<i>lt was a pleasant enough go
for a few days,</i>

418
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:25,034
<i>though my wagon,
full of supplies for the handcarters,</i>

419
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:28,832
<i>was not the fastest rig on the trail.</i>

420
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:34,933
<i>Then, still early in the season,
what Brigham prophesied came true.</i>

421
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,177
<i>To be on the trail
in these conditions meant</i>

422
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,610
<i>we were all risking our lives.</i>

423
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:45,619
Ephraim! Ephraim! Eph!

424
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:48,155
We're hunkering down here
'til she blows over!

425
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:50,623
We'll be here 'til spring!

426
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,131
Worthless! Utterly worthless!

427
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,236
Will do better without them at all!

428
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,670
Absolute tosh!

429
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,256
Are you leaving them?

430
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,829
Yes, l am leaving them.

431
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:38,998
May l have them, please?

432
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:45,647
They will do you no good.
They can't be made to stay afoot.

433
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,948
Take them, Elizabeth.

434
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:51,814
Thank you.

435
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,558
For soup.

436
00:54:58,662 --> 00:54:59,128
What?

437
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:03,693
She wants to boil them
and make a broth for her family.

438
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:07,029
So it's come to this, has it?

439
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:12,130
That there is nothing more to eat
than a bit of disgusting broth

440
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:15,108
made from a stodgy boot?

441
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:23,984
What's her tale?

442
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:26,788
Elizabeth Bradshaw...

443
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,591
She's a marvelous sister.

444
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,097
She had two husbands
perish back home,

445
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:38,792
but she'll not give up her hope
to get to Zion.

446
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:42,962
When she was already onboard ship,
ready to sail from Liverpool,

447
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:46,633
her two wealthy brothers came aboard

448
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:49,745
and told her not to take her children
to ''those forsaken Mormons''

449
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:52,279
and such a despised place.

450
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,242
They promised that if she would stay,

451
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:58,013
she would never yearn for anything
money could buy.

452
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,382
But she held her son close,

453
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:03,352
turned to her brothers and said,
''The gospel is true.

454
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,923
Joseph Smith is a prophet of God,

455
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:09,725
and we are going to Zion.''

456
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:18,797
Sister Bradshaw knows, there are
possessions more precious than gold.

457
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:53,137
<i>Reddick Allred had been assigned
to wait with supplies at South Pass</i>

458
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:56,006
<i>'til wagons could make it through.</i>

459
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,449
You know what the worst thing
is about, uh...

460
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,251
Multiple wives?

461
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,281
...being out here on the trail
all the time?

462
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,690
Chapped lips.

463
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,396
l can tell you how to fix that.

464
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,999
Pick up one of them horse apples
on the trail...

465
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,433
Rub it around your lips.

466
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,705
Sounds like an odd cure.

467
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,344
lt won't cure 'em...

468
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,777
lt'll sure keep you from lickin' 'em.

469
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:48,358
Brothers!
We're heading back!

470
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,432
Ain't no way there's
a company out in this.

471
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,895
Either they's stopped somewhere
in Nebraska, or they's dead of the cold.

472
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,130
Did you get word to go back?

473
00:57:57,073 --> 00:58:01,066
Get word?
How could we get word?

474
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,843
You gonna go, Eph?

475
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,796
Those of you with strength at all
cross back and help the others!

476
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:33,773
lf you have any strength left at all,
please, go back and help the others!

477
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:38,074
lf you can, please cross back
and help the others!

478
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,848
Just get yourself over, me boy.

479
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:43,282
Others have boots.

480
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,853
Just get yourself over.

481
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,891
Remember?
The Lord helped us last time?

482
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,431
Remember?
We can do this.

483
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,467
Please?

484
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:12,243
l just need you
to be my big man, please?

485
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,180
Sister Bradshaw?

486
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,048
l was hoping your son
would assist me across the river.

487
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:28,023
What do you think of that?

488
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,531
Okay.

489
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,894
Thank you.

490
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,928
Brother Dobson,
would you assist these Saints

491
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:39,898
up and out of the marshes?

492
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,461
Yes, Captain!

493
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:45,370
But first,
l must see the others across.

494
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:58,483
He is coming to help us.

495
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:00,920
Yes...

496
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:03,583
He is helping others.

497
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:41,289
<i>Strange how lively
your thoughts become</i>

498
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:44,332
<i>after making a poor decision.</i>

499
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:49,295
Did you get word to go back?

500
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,407
How could we get word?

501
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:54,238
You only think of your precious self!

502
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,675
The Lord prepares each of us.

503
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:59,038
Keep your head, Eph!

504
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,281
Headed the wrong way, boys!

505
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:11,621
Goin' home.
They's either camped or dead.

506
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,325
How do you know that?

507
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:25,037
l'll make you a proposition.

508
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,337
There's a decent place to camp
just back a piece.

509
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:31,572
You wait there.
We'll go on and find them.

510
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:34,342
What makes you think
you could find them when we couldn't?

511
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:37,009
Brother Brigham sent me
to find these Saints,

512
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:41,613
and l'll find them
or l'll give my life trying.

513
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:46,418
We'll wait for ya, Arza.

514
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:04,042
Ephraim! Will you help them?

515
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,476
Yes.

516
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,106
l seek to do what's right.

517
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,377
Keep the fire goin', boys!

518
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:27,092
Arza! Dan!

519
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:37,676
<i>Sometimes it's not which side
of the fork in the road to take,</i>

520
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:42,376
<i>it's which direction on the road
you ought to be headed.</i>

521
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:55,155
Despite our prayers, Mother,
they are not getting better.

522
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,198
They are getting worse.

523
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:02,236
So it this the blessing of the righteous
which you speak of?

524
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:12,646
Please, Lord, we need Thy help,
and we need it now.

525
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:15,751
Or there will not be a live one
amongst us.

526
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:23,153
<i>lt wasn't long before our wagon
was snowbound.</i>

527
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:27,592
<i>We determined they would wait
for help, and l would move on.</i>

528
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:30,198
Even on horse it'll be a tough go.

529
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:33,325
You can't move mountains
while you're sitting on your backside!

530
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:56,651
l saw what you did,
helping others across the river.

531
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:59,454
lt was a really lovely thing to do.

532
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:19,647
Thomas, did you leave a girl
in England?

533
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:23,208
Yes.

534
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,915
Was she pretty?

535
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,416
Yes, she was...

536
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,556
Did you leave a boy in England?

537
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,267
Yes.

538
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:44,462
Was he... handsome?

539
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:51,680
No, he was quite plain, actually.

540
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:56,317
So l just tried not to look at him
too much.

541
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,983
Look at me.

542
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:15,732
Rally up! Move along now!

543
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:16,964
l'd best be off.

544
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,467
Ester...

545
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:20,870
l will keep an eye on you.

546
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,672
No, Thomas, l'll be fine.

547
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,906
You help the others.

548
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,621
Eph!

549
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,261
Eph, we found them!

550
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:46,630
<i>lt wasn't much later Joseph A. Young
and Abel Garr showed.</i>

551
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:49,670
<i>They had found the Martin company
at Red Buttes</i>

552
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:52,535
<i>and left several rescuers there
to aid them.</i>

553
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:56,839
<i>They were riding day and night
to get back and report</i>

554
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,446
<i>to Brother Brigham.</i>

555
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:03,018
<i>They hurried off, exhorting me
to find them and do what l could.</i>

556
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:08,449
<i>Their account of the deprivation
they saw startled me.</i>

557
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:18,465
<i>l knew those Saints had no food left...</i>

558
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:22,799
<i>so l asked for a desire
that had been planted in my heart.</i>

559
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:30,306
Dear Father...

560
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,839
You've told us to ask
for what we stand in need of.

561
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,420
l ask you now...

562
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:44,355
that a buffalo be put before me.

563
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:01,476
Mercy, Lord!

564
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:04,010
What took you so long?

565
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:06,973
<i>lt was a rare thing</i>

566
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:10,552
<i>to find buffalo around that place
at this late season.</i>

567
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,599
<i>l knew the hand of the Lord was in it</i>

568
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:29,067
<i>for that animal had stayed behind</i>

569
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:32,772
<i>when the rest of its kind
left for their winter quarters.</i>

570
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:37,811
<i>l skinned and dressed it,
then loaded up my horses with it.</i>

571
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,118
Brothers!

572
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,920
<i>The sun was about an hour high
in the west</i>

573
01:09:54,056 --> 01:09:57,924
<i>when l spied something
in the distance.</i>

574
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,962
<i>l perceived it moved.</i>

575
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:06,695
<i>l was then satisfied
this was the Handcart company</i>

576
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:10,498
<i>led by Captain Edward Martin
and Daniel Tyler.</i>

577
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,938
<i>The sight that met my gaze
as l entered into their midst</i>

578
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,604
<i>can never be erased
from my memory...</i>

579
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:24,680
<i>And any concerns l had regarding
my own well-being departed.</i>

580
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:31,750
l must tell you, dear brother,

581
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,754
a prophecy was made
by one of the brethren

582
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:37,688
that the company would
feast on buffalo meat

583
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,623
when our provisions run short.

584
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:41,756
Thank you.

585
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:44,997
You and God have rescued us.

586
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:47,801
For this, you will be known
for generations.

587
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:50,931
What's your name, sister?

588
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,132
Alice Dobson --
Preston, Lancashire, England.

589
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:58,579
Me son is not faring well,
and this is surely a grand prize.

590
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:12,156
We've been through much.

591
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:17,358
Perhaps it would be best
if we rested here a day?

592
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:24,765
Though exhausted and starved
as they may be, Captain,

593
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:29,640
we must keep them moving
or we all perish together.

594
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,977
Pardon me, brothers.

595
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:35,777
Yes, sister?

596
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,284
lt's me husband!

597
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,405
Please, Brother Tyler.

598
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,876
He is a good man.

599
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:13,247
He was president
of the London branch.

600
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:19,657
He has been giving us his rations
for many weeks.

601
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:28,234
l am sorry, sister, but l cannot
administer to a dead man.

602
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:43,311
Brother Hanks, would you please
stay and prepare him for burial?

603
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:16,715
Brother Martin, there is much sorrow
in the Blair tent tonight,

604
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:22,121
but the Lord will use us as his hands
if we are willing and worthy.

605
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,289
Why do you do that?

606
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:59,490
None of us are truly clean...

607
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:04,826
but we must do our best to be so

608
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:08,027
as we petition the Lord
for his blessings.

609
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:13,103
What's his name, sister?

610
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:15,207
David Blair...

611
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,343
me husband!

612
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:38,897
David Blair, we anoint you with
this consecrated oil

613
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:44,837
and command you in the name
of Jesus Christ, breathe and live.

614
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:55,906
<i>The effect of the blessing
was immediate.</i>

615
01:15:56,018 --> 01:16:00,318
<i>Brother Blair sat up
and began to sing a hymn.</i>

616
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:21,006
<i>Word spread quickly after this</i>

617
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:26,877
<i>and the greater portion of my time was
then devoted to waiting on the sick.</i>

618
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:42,986
<i>l administered to several hundred.</i>

619
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:54,873
<i>lt would be a number of days before
we would meet the supply wagons.</i>

620
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:57,875
<i>There was much to be done.</i>

621
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,959
Eph!

622
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:19,493
Brethren!

623
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:23,162
<i>Though more valley boys
arrived almost daily,</i>

624
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:28,208
<i>it was only as a drop to a bucket
to what was needed.</i>

625
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:39,483
You are doing so well, me boy.

626
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:44,423
Just a bit of broth to make you
stronger and warm your toes.

627
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,965
Mother...

628
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:53,330
l want you to know...

629
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:58,036
that l am sorry...

630
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,631
for the bother and heartache
l have caused.

631
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:04,335
Forgive me.

632
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:09,541
None for the wear.

633
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,979
l've been my own enemy
on this journey...

634
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:18,219
and l have laid many Saints to rest
as we've gone on...

635
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:23,122
but soon...

636
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:25,426
others will bury me.

637
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:31,131
Here, here, none such talk.

638
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,707
Tomorrow will be a warmer day.

639
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,178
First father...

640
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:39,405
and now me.

641
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:50,253
l'll soon be back.

642
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:01,501
Brother Hanks?

643
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:03,001
Yes, sister?

644
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:06,037
lt's me son, Thomas.

645
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:08,540
He is having a go of it.

646
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:13,737
All in the company say
that you have the gift.

647
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,611
Would you bless him?

648
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:45,179
lt's not only that.

649
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:01,593
Sister...

650
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:04,429
His feet have the black.

651
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,663
They'll have to come off.

652
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:19,403
Please, Brother Hanks.

653
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:23,380
Please ask God for help.

654
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,755
He is a grand dancer
of the hornpipe jig.

655
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:31,451
Other than the gospel,
it's all he has.

656
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:38,396
ln the past day, l have removed limbs
not near this black.

657
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,567
Please?

658
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:56,707
Brother?

659
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:59,184
Thomas.

660
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:08,760
Do you have faith in the Savior,
that He has all power?

661
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:13,301
l do.

662
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:16,703
But l am not worthy.

663
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:20,698
l have been poor and weak
in my actions.

664
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:26,439
As have we all.

665
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:56,699
Brother?
You are a holy man.

666
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:03,580
l have so many faults,
l could not count them all.

667
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:09,446
Well, how is it, then,
you do so much good?

668
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,591
l try.

669
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,311
Thomas Dobson.

670
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:46,724
The time for you to leave this world
has not come.

671
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:51,357
You have a work yet to do.

672
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,800
l promise you...

673
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:02,842
though they be blackened,
your feet shall be saved.

674
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:10,342
Through your faith,
you will glorify God

675
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:16,321
and others will hear of and speak
of this day for many years to come.

676
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:20,752
They will learn of you in ways
we do not now even understand.

677
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:29,993
Thomas Dobson,
in the name of our Savior,

678
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:31,930
l say unto you,

679
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:35,873
take up thy bed and walk!

680
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,568
Oh, me boy, oh!

681
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:28,996
Thomas, spirits in the camp are low.

682
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:34,090
Do you feel the strength to now lift
as you have been lifted?

683
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:00,894
Steady on, me boy.

684
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:19,435
You are a good man, Brother Hanks...

685
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:23,506
And l am certain,
wherever your mother is,

686
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:25,670
she is very proud of you!

687
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:40,653
<i>Many stood in need of a rescue
that winter,</i>

688
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:42,820
<i>and l was one.</i>

689
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:54,633
<i>The Gospel of Jesus Christ
is another name for opportunity.</i>

690
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:58,742
<i>lt offers us the privilege
and responsibility</i>

691
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,839
<i>to give something back
by becoming better than we were.</i>

692
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:09,653
<i>l notice the Lord always counts
on human folks to help Him out...</i>

693
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:11,224
<i>Thomas fostered his talents</i>

694
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:15,552
<i>and lifted the spirits of many
to carry on.</i>

695
