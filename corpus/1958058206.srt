536
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:23,149
I already told you
who the killer is.

537
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:24,454
But you can't take me
to him.

538

where he is yet.

You show me a drawing
of some joker in a book

he's 500 years old,

543

my mad wolf theory
sound very reasonable.

last year is happening up here.

his remains.

00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:54,006
The technician cut her hand
and some drops of blood
mixed in.

in it was completely empty.

Now, remains don't
just disappear, do they?

Well, maybe you read
about it in the papers.

Maybe you heard it
on the news.

- Sorry, brother.

1235
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:29,287
- Give him to me, Nina.
- No, get away.

1236
01:27:29,331 --> 01:27:31,550
Look at him.
He's going to die.

1237
01:27:31,594 --> 01:27:34,161
- [ Tyler crying ]
- Max, please. Please.

1238
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:36,251
He's my son, Nina.
I won't let him go.

1239
01:27:36,294 --> 01:27:37,991
And you can't change
what he is.

1240
01:27:38,035 --> 01:27:39,515
No.

1241
01:27:39,558 --> 01:27:41,647
No, Max.
Please, let us go.

1242
01:27:41,691 --> 01:27:43,562
I can't.

1243
01:27:43,606 --> 01:27:47,305
I have to protect him.
Don't you understand?

1244
01:27:47,349 --> 01:27:49,307
There are too many others.

1245
01:27:49,351 --> 01:27:52,005
They'll come for him
and they'll teach him
how to kill.

1246
01:27:53,355 --> 01:27:55,182
Look at me, Nina.

1247
01:27:55,226 --> 01:27:57,620
Look at me!

1248
01:27:57,663 --> 01:27:59,622
Is this what you want?

1249
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:06,890
I can't change
what I am, Nina.

1250
01:28:06,933 --> 01:28:09,284
But you have to trust me.

1251
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,896
I want you with me.

1252
01:28:16,856 --> 01:28:18,728
Don't deny our love.

1253
01:28:22,514 --> 01:28:25,343
Nina, the darkness
can be so beautiful.

1254
01:28:30,217 --> 01:28:32,437

You fool.

You stupid
fucking fool.

1260
01:29:12,999 --> 01:29:14,827
Do you think
you're a match for me?

1261
01:29:14,871 --> 01:29:16,438
- Huh?
- Get away from me.

1262

Oh, you bastard!
