- Jodi.
(bangs)

5
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:13,381
Come on, we gotta get out.

6
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:14,799
- [Jodi] Get out?

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,482
What are you doing?

8
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:20,900
(rock music)

00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:24,895

- Southwell!

13
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,009
You're gonna die, Southwell!

14
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,732
You're gonna die.

00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:35,676

18
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:40,149
I'm the fire starter!

19
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,396
Hey, guys!

20
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:42,926
I'm gonna kill you!

21
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:44,510
I'm gonna kill you!

22
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:48,899
- [Jodi] Oh no.

23
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,469
All our stuff, all our stuff.

24
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,987
No, no, no, no, no.

25
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,340
- What are you do-

26
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,770
Oh, your bear.

27
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:00,771
Sorry.

28
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,899
- Who cares about that?
All our stuff was in there.

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,699
- We'll get new stuff.

30
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,909
- Yeah, where are we gonna sleep?

31
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,260
Where are we going to live?

32
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,460
- I'll figure something out, all right?

33
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,270
- I just did the laundry.

34
00:02:15,528 --> 00:02:18,445
(flames crackling)

35
00:02:33,615 --> 00:02:37,032

00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:01,467
(dogs barking)

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,923
- Sherman, Peabody. Stop it.

39
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:13,771
(soft, melancholy music)

40
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:19,909
(dogs barking)

41
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,929
- [Barbara] Dearest Gordon,
it's my fifth day at sea

42
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,009
and I've been giving our
life together lot of thought.

43
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,149
For years we've been
living two separate lives.

44
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,769
Your depression and
hopelessness has shut me out.

45
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,579
Gordon, no matter how
difficult things have been,

46
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,399
I do miss you,

47
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,159
but living without love,
affection or communication

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,759
has taken its toll.

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,193
I can't do it anymore.

50
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,179
I would like to think you still believe

51
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,399
there is something worth living for,

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,193
something that would make
you want to fight, for us.

53
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,929
But deep down, I know it would take

54
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,083
an act of God to turn
this marriage around.

55
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,750
- Peabody, Sherman. Let's go

56
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:12,899
(dog grumbling)

57
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,323
Who is it for, Peabody?

58
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,739
(dog grumbling)

59
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,240
- [Barbara] My cruise ship
will dock in San Diego.

60
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,019
If there's any chance of saving
what's left of our marriage,

61
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,989
I pray you'll be there.

62
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,323
- [Neighbor] I hope you're
going to clean that up.

63
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,622
(soft, melancholy music)

64
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,763
- Actually, I'm not.

65
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,893
You want to save our marriage?
I'll save our marriage.

66
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,373
Oh.
(sighs)

67
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:02,541
Well, I tried.

68
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,003
(people chattering)
(upbeat Christmas music)

69
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:11,169
- [Celeste] I just keep thinking how long

70
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,889
it's been since we had a real Christmas.

71
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,290
With a man around the house.

72
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,059
Oh, Jodi, honey, I have
a feeling you're really

73
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,443
going to like Cliff.

74
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:23,129
He's going to make a great husband,

75
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,119
even though he's turned your
kid brothers into army brats.

76
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,069
- So send me a ticket and I'll fly down.

77
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,135
- [Celeste] Oh yeah, so you'll...

78
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:31,215
- It's my mom, my mom.
- And by drugs

79
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:32,899
for your friends?

80
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,066
- Thanks, ma, I love you, too.

81
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,629
- [Celeste] Oh, come on.
What do you expect from me?

82
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,029
You run away from a good home-

83
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,742
- Good home?

84
00:05:39,743 --> 00:05:41,189
What are you, high?

85
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,538
- [Celeste] Jodi.

86
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:43,879
The door's open.

87
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,786
You do what you want. You always have.

88
00:05:46,787 --> 00:05:49,204
(line drops)

89
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:53,955
(upbeat Christmas music)

90
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:56,878
- 50 bucks?

91
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,309
Where did you get that?

92
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,459
- Donation. For abused kids.

93
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,810
Hey, it's Christmas, right?

94
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,779
(bright, upbeat Christmas music)

95
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,780
- All righty.

96
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,419
- No, that's okay. I don't have to see it.

97
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,420
- Okay, then.

98
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:16,259
If you just want to sign right here.

99
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,029
We'll have you on your way.

100
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,729
Now if you're interested
in a good shooting range,

101
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,603
there's a place just-
- It's a gift.

102
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
For myself.

103
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,207
- Okay, well, in that case...

104
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:35,008
(bullets rattling)

105
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,879
(clicking)

106
00:08:07,109 --> 00:08:09,859
(softly sobbing)

107
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:21,089
(bright, upbeat music)

108
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,769
- Excuse me. Can you spare some change?

109
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,629
It's actually for a good cause, my, my...

110
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,813
Merry Christmas.

111
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,970
(people chattering)
(laughing)

112
00:08:39,057 --> 00:08:42,974
(soft, upbeat Christmas music)

113
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,739
- It's freezing out here.

114
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,899
What are you doing?

115
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,900
- Nothing.

116
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,589
(sighs)

117
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,579
So have you figured out
where you're staying tonight?

118
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,759
- I don't know. Maybe the
Ramada or the Hilton. (chuckles)

119
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,979
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

120
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,649
Somebody gave Cam 50 bucks.

121
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,650
- Seriously?

122
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,476
Wow.

123
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:08,163
I wonder what he had to do for it.

124
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:11,193
(sighs)

125
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:12,599
- Ho, ho, ho.

126
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,373
Santa's got some stuff.

127
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:16,343
(Crystal laughs)

128
00:09:16,344 --> 00:09:17,988
You ready?

129
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,559
All right.

130
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,623
Lamb's wool sweater
straight from Scotland.

131
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,983
Heated socks, nine volt
battery included for you.

132
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,200
- I always wanted these.
- Yes.

133
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,749
Ear muffs and gloves.

134
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,963
Ooh, one last thing.

135
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,133
Close your eyes, please.

136
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:48,367
(sighs)
Okay, open 'em.

137
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,285
- All of that for 50 bucks?

138
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:55,119
- [Cam] Yeah.

139
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,004
(Jodi chuckles)

140
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:02,088
(bright, upbeat Christmas music)

141
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:18,718
(insects buzzing)

142
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,470
- Excuse me, mister, um...

143
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,889
Me and my sister have
been calling our parents

144
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,923
to give us a ride, but
they're not home and um,

145
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,396
we were wondering if maybe
you can give us a lift?

146
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:41,519
- Sorry.

147
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,189
- Please, mister.

148
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,056
It's getting late and it's cold

149
00:10:45,057 --> 00:10:49,343
and we have no way to
get home, so, please?

150
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,159
- Well, where do you live?

151
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,163
- [Crystal] Just a few minutes from here.

152
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,159
- Well, I'm heading to Lockesburg.

153
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,993
- That's perfect.

154
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:03,993
- That's good.

155
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,650
- Well okay, but uh...

156
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,803
Brush off your shoes first, please.

157
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,129
- [Crystal] Oh, um, this is our brother.

158
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,980
Can you give him a ride, too, mister?

159
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,513
Wipe your feet off first.

160
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,637
(insects buzzing)

161
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,312
- Well, one thing, kids.

162
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,133
When you drive in this
car, you wear a seatbelt.

163
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:11,355
(soft, mysterious music)

164
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,837
Feet off the dash.

165
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:25,536
(soft, mysterious music)

166
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Hey.

167
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,424
Hey, hey.

168
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:34,921
(Cam grunts)
- Hey.

169
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,280
- Knock it off.

170
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:37,397
Do you have a problem?

171
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:39,017
- [Jodi] Stop.

172
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:39,851
(laughing)

173
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:41,165
- Pass it up, just give me the broom.

174
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:41,999
Give me the broom.

175
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:42,832
- [Cam] Give me the broom.

176
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,563
- Are you a wise guy? Give me the broom.

177
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,350
So uh...

178
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,100
Were you doing some Christmas shopping?

179
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,363
- No, sir.

180
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,483
We went to a movie.

181
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,720
- [Gordon] Really? Which one?

182
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,817
- I don't remember,
'cause we, we left early.

183
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:16,750
(laughing)
(clattering)

184
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:23,878
- All right.

185
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:24,878
Out of the car. Now!

186
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,678
Come on, out.

187
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,512
- What's with you?

188
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:29,345
- All right, let's go.

189
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:30,330
- [Jodi] Hey, stop!

190
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,163
- Out.

191
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:32,407
- [Jodi] Stop it, that hurts.

192
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:33,782
- [Gordon] Enough with the shenanigans.

193
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:34,780
That's it.
- Get your hands off me.

194
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,232
Look, we didn't do anything.
- Get out, out of the car.

195
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,715
- [Jodi] Stop it, let go of me.

196
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:38,938
- [Crystal] Listen,
you're really hurting her.

197
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:40,311
- [Jodi] Come on, stop!

198
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:42,729
(tires skid)

199
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:53,845
(insects buzzing)

200
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,130
- I don't believe this.

201
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,513
- Stupid idiot, what are you doing?

202
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:07,474
- Watch it, I'm trying to drive.

203
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:08,654
- [Jodi] Cam, I am not kidding.

204
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:10,566
You gotta turn this car around right now.

205
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:13,317
(Crystal grunts)

206
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,092
(Cam laughs)

207
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:16,870
- Sit back and put your seat belt on.

208
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:19,838
(Cam laughs)

209
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,266
- Oh great.

210
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:23,684
(tires skid)

211
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:32,963
(insects buzzing)
(tense music)

212
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,347
(tense, dramatic music)

213
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Hey.

214
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:56,550
- [Jodi] I can't believe this.

215
00:14:56,551 --> 00:14:57,480
Cam.
- Come on.

216
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,099
We were just kidding around.

217
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,910
- [Jodi] Hey, don't hurt him, okay, Cam?

218
00:15:00,911 --> 00:15:02,736
- [Cam] Just get back
in the car, all right?

219
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:03,819
- [Crystal] Don't listen to her.

220
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,153
- [Cam] Come on!

221
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,210
- [Jodi] Cam? Hey!

222
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,650
Cam, what did I say?
- Wow, it's freezing.

223
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,626
- [Gordon] Can I say something?

224
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:16,327
You kids are making a big mistake.

225
00:15:17,812 --> 00:15:19,109
(rock music)

226
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,710
- [Crystal] 12 bucks? That's it?

227
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,916
- That's a short trip in this gas duster.

228
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:27,260
And I bet you use super, don't you?

229
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,689
- Where's the rest of your money?

230
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,040
- Hey, will you cut it out?

231
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,099
This is stupid. I don't want
to do this anymore, Cam.

232
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
- You started it.

233
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,739
I didn't hit him in the
head with any goobers.

234
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,829
- That was just having fun.

235
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,880
- [Crystal] Well so is this so chill out.

Careful.

281
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,966
- Here.

00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:07,279
(Cam burps)

283
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,630
- That really hit the spot.

284
00:18:12,077 --> 00:18:13,763
You guys want to do anything else tonight?

285
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,919
- Not me.

286
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,943
Thanks, mister.

287
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,980
- So Jode, I guess you figured out

288
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:22,563
where you're staying tonight, huh?

289
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,193
- There's always the bus station.

290
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:30,946
- I think I got a better idea.

291
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,003
We got a car, right?

292
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:40,355
I don't know, why don't
we like head down south,

293
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:42,119
all the way to Mexico.

294
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,739
Get some sun, get out
of this freezing cold.

295
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,792
What do you think?
- Yeah.

296
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,710
Yeah, I'm all for that.

297
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:53,602
What?

298
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:57,519
Ah, come on, your mom
lives down south, right?

299
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
Arizona.

300
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,078
- Yeah, that's right.

301
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,359
And you know what? You could
even be there by Christmas.

302
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,543
- Nah, I don't wanna.

303
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
- Okay.

304
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,298
You think you can give us a ride downtown?

305
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,723
(hits)

306
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:17,970
What was that for?

307
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:20,284
- "You think you can
give us a ride downtown?"

308
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,120
- What?

309
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,953
- What?

310
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:25,453
We just stole this guy's
car with him in it.

311
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:26,287
What do you think?

312
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:28,639
He's just going to go
home and go to sleep?

313
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,769
We have a serious problem, Cam.

314
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,989
- That's right.

315
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,149
That's right.

316
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,459
And it's going to get worse if you don't

317
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,953
give me those keys right now!

318
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
- Do it, Cam.

319
00:19:42,778 --> 00:19:43,990
(keys rattling)

320
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:45,799
- All right, I don't want
any hassles, all right?

321
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,379
- No, give me the keys!

322
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,547
- [Jodi] Crystal.

323
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:50,051
- Ow, ow!
- Hey!

324
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:51,000
- Ow!
- Hey!

325
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:52,459
- Stop it.
- Hey, leave her alone!

326
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,542
- [Cam] Knock it off.

327
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:55,108
- It hurts.
- Don't hurt her.

328
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:55,942
- Get off of me!
- Come on,

329
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:58,192
you're hurting her.

330
00:19:58,193 --> 00:20:00,443
(grunting)

331
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,343
You're out of control.

332
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:07,868
Fucking psycho.

333
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,768
- Oh great.

334
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:13,748
Can somebody get me a tissue?

335
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:17,256
(Crystal sniffles)

336
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,840
- He took the tray.

337
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,340
Check the glove compartment.

338
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:30,283
All right, Santa.

339
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:36,216
- [Biker] Hey!

340
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,403
Get back here, old man!

341
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:42,834
I'm gonna kill you.

342
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:49,186
(Gordon grunting)

343
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:56,235
(gun cocks)

344
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
- Down, boy.

345
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:03,692
(tense music)

346
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,869
- [Jodi] Arizona by Christmas.

347
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,870
Right?

348
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,459
(dogs barking)

349
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,657
- Is everything fine over here?

350
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:56,075
(gun clicks)

351
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,483
More coffee, sir?

352
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:13,829
(hits)
(waitress gasps)

353
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,760
Looks like somebody woke up

354
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:16,510
on the wrong side of the bed today.

355
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:29,189
- All right, you can have the car.

356
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,979
Just let me go.

357
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,619
- Can't do it, Fish-Man.

358
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,620
- Why is that?

359
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,769
- 'Cause I need you to
sign the credit card

360
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,679
in places like this.

361
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,542
- I'll give you the
credit card. You sign it.

362
00:22:42,543 --> 00:22:45,329
(Cam laughs)

363
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,439
- Right, that'll work real good.

364
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,943
Card member since 1982,
when I was freaking born.

365
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,183
- Don't you want to eat something?

366
00:22:55,184 --> 00:22:56,770
You should really eat something.

367
00:23:02,301 --> 00:23:05,529
- [Celeste] Well, isn't that a kick?

368
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,863
To have my baby home again,
and just in time for Christmas.

369
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:11,689
Your kid brothers will be thrilled.

370
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,579
I hope you're not bringing
any of your friends.

371
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,063
- What? Ruin their Christmas?

372
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:17,769
I was just kidding, ma.

373
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,940
- [Celeste] Well, I hope so,

374
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,643
because that was pretty mean, Jodi.

375
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:25,522
I want you to come home, honey.

376
00:23:25,523 --> 00:23:28,293
I can't tell you how much I miss you.

377
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:30,579
And hey...

378
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,935
- [Cam] Come on, Jodi. We're gotta go.

379
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:33,026
- [Celeste] Wait till
you see our new house.

380
00:23:33,027 --> 00:23:34,169
- Ma, I got to hang up now,

381
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,229
but I love you and I'm coming home.

382
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,463
- I love you.
- Bye.

383
00:23:41,781 --> 00:23:44,364
(upbeat music)

384
00:23:54,678 --> 00:23:57,261

(dog barks)

387
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,724
- Oh my goodness.

388
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:20,725
Oh.

389
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,709
Oh! You naughty dogs.

390
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,710
You...

391
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,723
Shoo, shoo.

392
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:33,577
(dog barking)

393
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:36,013
Mr. T!

394
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:40,332

Mr. T!

395
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,666

How about you Fish-Man?

412
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,603
- No, but I could use Bromo.

413
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,139
- A Bromo?

414
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,140
What's that?

415
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,043
- Just ask the clerk.

416
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,534
- Keep an eye on him, all right?

417
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:09,368
Here.

418
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:10,659
- Forget it.

419
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,452
- No, just take it, and be careful with it

420
00:26:12,453 --> 00:26:13,933
because I loaded it again.

421
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,260
- Wait.

422
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,323
You know, I also could use a toothbrush.

423
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,580
Medium bristle.

424
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,699
I mean, don't get me the
firm, and some toothpaste.

425
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,533
Colgate.

426
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:28,533
Not the gel.

427
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,910
The original.

428
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,090
- Anything else?

429
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,989
Six pack of prune juice maybe?

430
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,723
I don't know, a box of adult diapers?

431
00:26:41,362 --> 00:26:43,862
(Jodi laughs)

432
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,673
- Man, he's so immature.

433
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,931
You think so?

434
00:26:52,932 --> 00:26:53,982
- Do I think so what?

435
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:57,213
- That your young friend is immature?

436
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,510
- I don't know.

437
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,849
- Well, it just seems that
you're more reasonable

438
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,409
than your friends.

439
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,410
You're smarter.

440
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,123
- Everyone's smarter than Cam.

441
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,939
- Is he the one that broke your arm?

442
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,309
- Um, no.

443
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,160
No, that, that was some jerk

444
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,289
who thought he was my boyfriend,

445
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,990
you know, with all the privileges.

446
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,070
Cam was the one who chased him off.

447
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,673
Okay.

448
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:36,673
Go.

449
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,539
- What?

450
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,803
- Go on, get outta here.

451
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:54,775
What are you doing?

452
00:27:54,776 --> 00:27:55,999
- I need the gun. Give me the gun.

453
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,959
- Are you mental? Get out of here.

454
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,307
- I'm not leaving you kids
with a gun. Give it to me.

455
00:28:00,308 --> 00:28:01,863
- [Cam] Woo hoo hoo!

456
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:04,864
You're not gonna believe what I got.

457
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:08,475
(Jodi sighs)

458
00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:10,076
- You're not too swift, are you?

459
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,610
- Woodstock, man.

460
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,489
Only 99 cents in The Dead, Fish-Man.

461
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,490
The Dead rule.

462
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,710
And...

463
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,820
They even gave me these for free.

464
00:28:30,189 --> 00:28:32,039
It just might be Christmas after all.

465
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:42,779
(tense, strange music)

466
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,999
- [Man] This is one thing that I was going

467
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,742
to wait a while before we talked about,

468
00:28:47,743 --> 00:28:48,899
but maybe we'll talk about it now

469
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,859
so you can think about it because you all,

470
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,510
we all have to make some
kind of plans for ourselves.

471
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,773
It's a free concert from now on.

472
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:04,589
(audience cheers)
(rock music)

473
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,009
One major thing you
have to remember tonight

474
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,719
when you go back up in
the woods to go to sleep

475
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
or if you stay here,

476
00:29:29,073 --> 00:29:32,888
is that the man next
to you is your brother

477
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:34,689
and you damn well better
treat each other that way

478
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,223
because if you don't, then
we blow the whole thing,

479
00:29:37,224 --> 00:29:39,641
but we've got it right there.

480
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:44,102
(bass guitar strumming)

481
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,913
(electronic rock music)

482
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:06,609
(Crystal laughs)

483
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:17,657
(laughing)

484
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:19,278
- [Crystal] Stop, Cam. (laughs)

485
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,589
- What?

486
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,019
I thought we were going to party.

487
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,222
- No way.
- Oh, come on.

488
00:31:25,223 --> 00:31:26,056
(Jodi laughs)

489
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:26,889
- [Jodi] No.

490
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,289
- Come on.
- Get off of me.

491
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:32,261
(laughing)

492
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,429
- You know, I'm just trying
to have a little bit of fun.

493
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,483
- Just stay away.

494
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:40,019
(Cam scoffs)

495
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,969
- Where am I supposed to sleep?

496
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,869
- That's your bed.

497
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,609
- With Fish-Man.

498
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,693
He's a little more your speed.

499
00:31:47,694 --> 00:31:50,194
(Jodi laughs)

500
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:54,806
(television blaring)

501
00:32:08,742 --> 00:32:09,575
(Jodi grunts)

502
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:10,575
- Cut it out, idiot.

503
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:14,278
(Cam chuckles)

504
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:26,585
(chuckles)

505
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:31,802
(Gordon grunts)

506
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:34,824
- What the?

507
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:37,211
- Sorry.

508
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,079
- What's wrong with you.

509
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,329
- Okay. I said I'm sorry.

510
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,435
- Oh.

511
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:44,269
Ah.

512
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:45,269
Oh.

513
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:47,993
(Jodi gasps)

514
00:32:47,994 --> 00:32:48,827
- Oh my.

515
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:50,614
Get some water!

516
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:51,597
Get water.

517
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:52,597
Oh, god.

518
00:32:54,504 --> 00:32:56,290
(splashing)

519
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,124
- I got it.

520
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:59,144
I got it, I got it, I got it. Don't worry.

521
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:01,027
(splashing)

522
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:02,863
- God, I can't believe you.

523
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,550
That's it. I'm outta here.

524
00:33:06,556 --> 00:33:07,389
- Oh.

525
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,609
- Jodi, come on, what are you doin'?

526
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,109
- I hate him.

527
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,110
I hate him.

528
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,219
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

529
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,220
All right? I'm sorry.

530
00:33:16,221 --> 00:33:18,179
- You're always saying you're sorry.

531
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,429
This time it's not enough.

532
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,543
Get out of my way.

533
00:33:21,805 --> 00:33:23,689
- What? It was a joke.

534
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,719
It was funny. I was
kidding, right, Fish-Man?

535
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
Tell her.

536
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,839
- Sorry for all the trouble
we caused you, mister.

537
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,673
Really.

538
00:33:30,674 --> 00:33:33,099
You're a nice man. You don't deserve this.

539
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,279
- [Cam] No, come on, please.

540
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,480
- Cam, get out of my way.
- Please, please.

541
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:42,752
(Cam sighs)

542
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,157
What's that all about?

543
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:50,158
- 'Cause you're a moron.

544
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:57,089
- You're not going to
leave me here, are you?

545
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,090
- Just chill out.

546
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,509
Do me a favor?

547
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,460

- [Jodi] Not with Cam.

560
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,863
- Okay.

561
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,757
What about me?

562
00:35:25,026 --> 00:35:29,570
I mean, you can't just forget
about your friends, you know?

563
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:33,939
We have to stick together.

564
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,040
- I don't know who my friends are anymore.

565
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,860
- Right.

566
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:46,033
Forget about Cam and all the
times he watched out for you.

567
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:51,443
I mean, you're right.
You got your family now.

568
00:35:52,632 --> 00:35:53,832
What do you need us for?

569
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440
- Come on, Crystal.

570
00:36:02,872 --> 00:36:06,759
- I don't know why I ever
thought you were any different.

571
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,969
Everybody just uses everybody else.

572
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,603
That's the way it works.

573
00:36:13,688 --> 00:36:18,688
And if I don't know that
by now, then joke's on me.

574
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,663
- Well what do you want me to do?

575
00:36:26,522 --> 00:36:28,489
- Without you and me to
keep Cam out of trouble,

576
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,490
the cops would pick them up in a second.

577
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,260
They will.

578
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:39,436
And you know what that means?

579
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,943
It means we're next.

580
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,640
I mean, where do you
want to spend Christmas?

581
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,343
At home or in jail?

582
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,533
- What about Gordon?

583
00:37:01,293 --> 00:37:02,651
(Crystal laughs)

584
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:03,919
- Are you kidding?

585
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,263
He's our main man.

586
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,423
Give me one sec, okay?

587
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,030
- Something special I can do you for?

588
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:22,639
- Well I saw you selling to that guy

589
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
and I thought maybe we can make a trade?

590
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:29,246
You do trade, don't you?

591
00:37:30,587 --> 00:37:32,787
- I think we can probably
arrange something.

592
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,700
- There's one problem.

593
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,479
My friend, she's a little shy,

594
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,860
so maybe you could talk to her

595
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,050
while I make myself
comfortable in your rig.

596
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:48,229
(man chuckles)

597
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:51,493
- Well, it's that one right there.

598
00:37:57,212 --> 00:38:00,462
(tense, strange music)

599
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:10,900
- It's gotta be here, come on.

600
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:11,901
Where is it?

601
00:38:13,703 --> 00:38:16,953
(tense, strange music)

602
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:33,119
- Don't get mad at me.

603
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,616
It was your friend's idea.

604
00:38:34,617 --> 00:38:36,897
- You're lying. Where is she?

605
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,883
- She's in my rig, behind those trucks.

606
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,880
(tense, strange music)

607
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:49,697
- Crystal?

608
00:38:49,698 --> 00:38:50,531
What are you doing?

609
00:38:50,532 --> 00:38:52,029
Get out of there, he's coming.

610
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,726
- [Crystal] Just stall
him, I'm almost done, okay?

611
00:38:53,727 --> 00:38:55,023
- All right, little lady.

612
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,306
Up you go.

613
00:38:58,307 --> 00:39:01,307
(chickens clucking)

614
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,570
Well.

615
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,803
See you found the little hen house.

616
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,270
Big cock'll walk.

617
00:39:11,762 --> 00:39:14,512
(mimics chicken)

618
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:17,320
(laughs)

619
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,153
All right.

620
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:20,479
That's the way you wanna play it.

621
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,887
- Get ready to run.

622
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,605
(chickens clucking)
- Woo hoo hoo hoo!

623
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:27,633
(Crystal grunts)

624
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:29,409
- [Crystal] Now!

625
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,410
(chickens clucking)

626
00:39:34,356 --> 00:39:37,689
(tense, dramatic music)

627
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,422
- [Jodi] Cam!

628
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:46,784
Cam!

629
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,820
Cam!

630
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,380
(tense music)

631
00:39:53,486 --> 00:39:55,069
- [Cam] Don't move.

632
00:39:56,098 --> 00:39:58,598
(tense music)

633
00:39:59,786 --> 00:40:00,619
(chickens clucking)

634
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,286
- [Crystal] Stop it.

635
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:04,602
(Crystal grunts)

636
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:06,936
(hits)

637
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,520
(Crystal sobs)

638
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:23,320
- [Jodi] Did you kill him?

639
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:24,321
- No.

640
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,893
He was still breathing.

641
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,057
Head wounds bleed a lot, you know.

642
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:34,965
- Ow.

643
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:39,740
Bunion. (sighs)

644
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:42,574
(Crystal sobbing)

645
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,739
- [Detective] How do you spell that?

646
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,033
- [Man] T-R-O-U-T.

647
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,150
- Like the fish?

648
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Well...

649
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,939
The first thing that we have to establish

650
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,509
is if in fact he's really missing.

651
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,329
I mean, how do we know he's
not over at a friend's house?

652
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,330
- What friends?

653
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,319
- My father rarely leaves the house.

654
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,280
Besides, look at this.

655
00:41:26,281 --> 00:41:27,980
He's been gone for three days now.

656
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:30,459
- Well, this doesn't
necessarily mean anything.

657
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,700
I mean, he could have got
tired of your mother's cooking.

658
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,129
Any marital problems?

659
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,563
- Not that I know of.
- Excuse me?

660
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,659
- He wasn't happy about her going off

661
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,927
on a cruise by herself.

662
00:41:43,928 --> 00:41:45,449
(woman gasps)
What?

663
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,943
What else do you want me to say?

664
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,779
- My father-in-law
tried to commit suicide-

665
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,029
- That was 15 years ago.

666
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,099
- Well, excuse me, Donald,

667
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,829
but isn't that the
reason we're so worried?

668
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,599
- His business failed, his partner,

669
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,929
his best friend in the world
screwed him up the wazoo.

670
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,349
- All right. I get the picture.

671
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,823
Depression, the holidays, weather.

672
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,339
Willis, check the hospitals.

Cameron Casey Jones Southwell.

It's my dad's name, too.

686
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,589
You know, he was an
engineer, at Central Pacific

687
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,803
before he got busted.

688
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,179
Yeah.

689
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,709
Garcia wrote that song for him.

690
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,597
He and my dad were like
real tight, you know?

691
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,123
And you see this?

692
00:43:00,918 --> 00:43:02,737
Garcia gave it to him.

693
00:43:02,738 --> 00:43:03,571
(Crystal scoffs)

694
00:43:03,572 --> 00:43:05,042
- [Crystal] Bull.

695
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:05,876
- What?

696
00:43:05,877 --> 00:43:07,126
- You heard me.

697
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,410
- Hey.

698
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:10,479
Hey.

699
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,669
My dad doesn't make stuff up, all right?

700
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,699
- Yeah, right, that's
why he's in the state pen

701
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,933
because he's so pure and honest.

702
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,019
- Hey Fish-Man, take the wheel.

703
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,379
- What?
- You heard me.

704
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,858
Take the wheel. I don't feel
like driving anymore, man.

705
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:35,657
- Whoa.
(Cam laughs)

706
00:43:35,658 --> 00:43:37,859
- All right, all right.

707
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,569
Now we're talkin'.

708
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,829
Let's have a little but of fun.

709
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:42,830
Lay on the horn.

710
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,603
- What?

711
00:43:44,604 --> 00:43:45,900
- I want you to lay on the horn.

712
00:43:48,687 --> 00:43:49,728
(horn beeps)

713
00:43:49,729 --> 00:43:50,729
Oh, please.

714
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,159
You can do better than
that. Lay on the horn!

715
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,299
Lay on it. Train men love that, man.

716
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,633
Lay on the horn.

00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,203
- That was so...

724
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,921
You are too much, Fish-Man.

725
00:44:24,922 --> 00:44:26,439
- Yeah, I mean, really.
It was an accident.

726
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,222
There was a, there was a, a pot hole.

727
00:44:29,223 --> 00:44:34,062
(Crystal laughs)
Yeah, I mean really.

728
00:44:34,063 --> 00:44:35,606
There was a huge pot hole.

729
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:38,940

Thank you.

You kids okay?

743
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,063
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

744
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,249

745
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,453
to step out of the car?

746
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,450
- What for? You drunk?

747
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,659
- You're not going to arrest
our grandfather, are you?

748
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,529
'Cause he doesn't always drive this fast.

749
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:07,483
- No, I uh, I slow down to
85 when I'm in a school zone.

750
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:11,123
- Okay. Mr. Trout. Let
me smell your breath.

751
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,769

752

No.

755
00:46:22,884 --> 00:46:23,884
You're not drunk.

756
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,473
Sign here.
(police radio chatter)

757
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,059
Now because you're from out of state,

758
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,723
you're going to have to show
up in court tomorrow morning.

759
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:43,930
- Officer, wait.

760
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,939
Where do we show up tomorrow?

761
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,090
- It's on the citation.

762
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,150
Merry Christmas.

763

- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

764
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,005
- [Cam] And a happy new year.

765
00:46:59,006 --> 00:47:00,139
- Bye.
- Bye.

766
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,390
- Yeah, thanks.

767
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:05,466
- [Cam] That was close.

768
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:07,036
- You can say that again.

769
00:47:07,037 --> 00:47:07,870
(Cam laughs)

770
00:47:07,871 --> 00:47:11,477
- You're a wise guy,
aren't you? (chuckles)

771
00:47:14,525 --> 00:47:18,608
(soft, tinkling Christmas music)

772

(Cam snoring)
(soft Christmas music)

773
00:48:18,564 --> 00:48:20,089
- I can't believe this is happening.

774
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,539
I was just robbed last week.

775
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,639
- I told you you're not being held up.

776
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,199
I just need to use the phone.

777
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,180
- Right.

778
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,180
Just over here.

779
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,273
- Quick, dial 911.

780
00:48:34,274 --> 00:48:35,107
- What?
- I'm kidnapped.

781
00:48:35,108 --> 00:48:36,259
My name is Gordon Trout.

782
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,533
Do it.
- Grandpa.

783
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:39,270
- These are my kidnappers.

784
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,240
- Grandpa, what are you doing?

785
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:42,229
Please don't tell me that
you're calling the police again.

786
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,539
- He always does this.

787
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,019
- Stay away. I'm warning you.

788
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:45,853
- Grandpa, come on.

789
00:48:45,854 --> 00:48:47,699
You're scaring us.
- The Res-Wel Motel.

790
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,699
Guy here claims he's being kidnapped.

791
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,179
- I am being kidnapped.

792
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,206
- All I know is he's got a gun

793
00:48:52,207 --> 00:48:54,389
and he's pointing at two kids.

794
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,579
Now hurry.

795
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,800
- Why did you say that?

796
00:48:58,930 --> 00:48:59,860
Where's Cam?

797
00:48:59,861 --> 00:49:02,189
Nobody's going to hurt you, grandpa.

798
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,959
- Enough with the grandpa bit.

799
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,960
Don't move.

800
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,169
- [Employee] Okay, fella.

801
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:10,003
Drop it.

802
00:49:10,004 --> 00:49:11,779
- You heard the man. Do what he says.

803
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,381
- Not him, you. You, old guy.

804
00:49:14,382 --> 00:49:16,294
- What? What?

805
00:49:16,295 --> 00:49:17,671
Now wait, wait a minute.

806
00:49:17,672 --> 00:49:19,919
You've got it all wrong.
I'm the victim here.

807
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,670
- We'll let the police decide that.

808
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,603
Now drop it!

809
00:49:27,938 --> 00:49:30,271
(gun thuds)

810
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:35,770

811
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:38,521
(employee sighs)

812
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,901
(gun cocks)
- All right, drop it.

813
00:49:42,902 --> 00:49:45,080
- Hey, what are you doing, kid?

814
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:47,231
- What does it look like I'm doin'?

815
00:49:47,232 --> 00:49:48,499
Me and grandpa here were having our way

816
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,649
with these fine young poodles.

817
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,549
Now, unless you want
to get into a contest,

818
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:55,193
drop the gun and get out of here.

819
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,007
I said drop the gun!

820
00:50:01,008 --> 00:50:01,841
- Okay.

821
00:50:01,841 --> 00:50:02,841
All right.

822
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,113
- I told you.

823
00:50:07,284 --> 00:50:09,017
- [Crystal] The cops are on their way.

824
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,659
- Come on! Let's go!

825
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,660
- No!

826
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,649
It's over.

827
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,299
This whole cockamamie charade is over.

828
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,649
Finished.

829
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:19,650
- Really?

830
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,790
All right, come on, come on.

831
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:23,817
- Go ahead.

832
00:50:23,818 --> 00:50:24,701
Do it.

833
00:50:24,701 --> 00:50:25,534
Do it.

834
00:50:25,534 --> 00:50:26,460
- Cut it out.

835
00:50:26,461 --> 00:50:28,189
- What's the matter? No guts?

836
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,190
- Cam, don't.

837
00:50:30,422 --> 00:50:31,260
- I'm trying.

838
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,529
- Come on.

839
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,149
What do you think I bought this gun for?

840
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,549
Come on, take your best shot.

841
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,550
Punk!

842
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,040
- No.

843
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:45,544

What kind of a place is this?

900
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:29,833
- Look up there.

901
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,050
See anything?

902
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,863

904
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,420

00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,340
Pure Odalis.

915
00:55:24,132 --> 00:55:27,993
Just goes to show things
aren't always what they seem.

916
00:55:31,615 --> 00:55:32,615
Here you go.

917
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,540
Eat up.

918
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,777
We'll have you back on
your feet in no time.

919
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,497
- How did I...

920
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,390
(soft, midtempo music)

921
00:55:58,623 --> 00:55:59,790
- Kinda bored.

922
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:05,025
(soft, midtempo music)

923
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:52,364
(sizzling)

924
00:56:52,365 --> 00:56:53,515
- Ow!

925
00:56:53,516 --> 00:56:54,834
Freak!

926
00:56:54,835 --> 00:56:55,918
- [Cam] Ouch.

927
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,129
- [Eddie] You forget how
to tie your shoes, kid?

928
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:02,249
- No, no, no, no, hey,
hey, whoa, I'm fine.

929
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,649
Hallelujah.

930
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,209
- So let's talk about Mr. Fish.

931
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,960
Who wants to tell me what happened?

932
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,560
Cameron?

933
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,479
Come on, big man.

934
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,479
Tell me what it's like to be
taken away from your life,

935
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,740
your home, your loved ones.

936
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:25,830
- We messed up.

937
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,580
- That's right.

938
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,260
You messed up.

939
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,600
What do you have to add to that, Crystal?

940
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,503
- He was asking for it.

941
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:43,510
- If you hurt somebody else,

942
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:45,810
does that make you feel
better about yourself?

943
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:49,430
Look at me.

944
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,540
You can stop this.

945
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,563
You can change this
self-destructive path you're on.

946
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:05,163
You don't think you have it
in you, but I know you do.

947
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:10,783
So what about you, Jodi?

948
00:58:18,876 --> 00:58:20,576
You know you did wrong, don't you?

949
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:30,951
There you go.

950
00:58:30,952 --> 00:58:31,866
(sizzling)
Ow!

951
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:36,866
(Eddie grunts)
(Cam laughing)

952
00:58:38,738 --> 00:58:43,581
Now just remember, what
goes around comes around.

953
00:58:43,582 --> 00:58:44,415
- [Employee] Res-Wel Motel.

954
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:46,342
Yeah, a guy here claims
he being kidnapped.

955
00:58:46,343 --> 00:58:47,779
- [Gordon] I am being kidnapped.

956
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:48,873
- [Employee] Now hurry.

957
00:58:48,874 --> 00:58:49,707
(banging)

958
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,148
- [Gordon] Now why did you say that?

959
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,179
- Well, that's it.

960
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,543
- I don't understand.

961
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,380
What was that?

962
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:04,469
- I take it those weren't
his grandchildren?

963
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:05,330
- Of course not.

964
00:59:05,331 --> 00:59:07,673
Clearly he was in fear for his life.

965
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,199
- This is a registration for a hand gun

966
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,819
purchased December 2nd by your father.

967
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,009
Same gun you saw him
holding on those girls.

968
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,889
- So just what exactly
are you trying to say?

969
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,489
- He probably was kidnapped.

970
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:23,019
- Probably? What else could it be?

971
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,049
- Well, there is some confusion.

972
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:27,239
Your father was stopped in Southern Oregon

973
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,282
and there were three very
nervous minors in the car.

974
00:59:30,283 --> 00:59:32,429
- Oh my god.

975
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:34,789
- Now we're running a
check on them right now.

976
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:37,809
In the meantime, we're
not ruling anything out.

977
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:40,329
Well I guess we can rule out suicide.

978
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:41,873
Anyway, I'll be in touch.

979
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,289
You know, I wasn't gonna
to say anything about this,

980
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:50,600
but the guy who shot this
said that he wants $5,000

981
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:52,633
or he's going to sell
it to Primetime Crime.

982
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,169
- What?
- I think it's just a bluff.

983
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:58,670
I mean, what would Primetime
Crime want with this?

984
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:02,820
(soft, midtempo music)

01:00:03,822 --> 01:00:06,579

- Hello?

992
01:00:30,207 --> 01:00:31,763
Hello? Anybody around?

993
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:34,390
Mr. Corbett?

994
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,663
- You can call me Eddie, Mr. Fish.

995
01:00:39,964 --> 01:00:41,364
- You can call me Mr. Trout.

996
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:44,593
- Hey, I was close.

997
01:00:45,637 --> 01:00:46,937
You want to go for a walk?

998
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:48,623
It might do you some good.

999
01:00:48,624 --> 01:00:50,339
- Well I was trying to use the telephone

1000
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,640
but I couldn't find one
anywhere in the house.

1001
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,669
I must've left my cell phone
up where I was chopping wood.

1002
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,003
Come on. I'll take you to it.

1003
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,879
I spent most of my youth
getting in and out of trouble.

1004
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,923
Followed it up with 36
years of serious drifting.

1005
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,323
And then bam, I was convicted by the Lord.

1006
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:15,523
I've only been a full senior
pastor for about a year.

1007
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:20,053
Proof that it's never too late to change.

1008
01:01:21,057 --> 01:01:22,259
- Where is this phone?

1009
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,310
- We're almost there.

1010
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,010
You holding up okay?

1011
01:01:26,011 --> 01:01:28,119
- Yeah, yeah. I just
have to call the police.

1012
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,120
- There it is.

1013
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:32,933
(Jodi and Crystal chuckle)

1014
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:35,713
- There's something you
don't see these days.

1015
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,019
Straight out of Norman Rockwell.

1016
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,440
Just kids being kids.

1017
01:01:43,494 --> 01:01:45,744
(laughing)

1018
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,432
- [Cam] Push me higher!

1019
01:01:52,433 --> 01:01:55,080
(laughing)

1020
01:01:55,081 --> 01:01:56,499
- It's them.

1021
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,379
They're the ones who kidnapped me.

1022
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,029
Give me the phone. Quick.

1023
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:01,830
- You mean Crystal and Cam and Jodi?

1024
01:02:02,926 --> 01:02:04,496
- You know them?

1025
01:02:04,497 --> 01:02:06,509
Do you have any idea what they did to me?

1026
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:08,163
- Well yeah.

1027
01:02:08,164 --> 01:02:10,424
I think it's great you're
sticking with them.

1028
01:02:10,425 --> 01:02:11,258
- I'm not sticking with them.

1029
01:02:11,259 --> 01:02:12,410
Did they tell you that?

1030
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,869
How do you work this cockamamie thing?

1031
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:18,870
- Push send.

1032
01:02:22,956 --> 01:02:24,206
- [Cam] Higher!

1033
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,164
- Gordon.

1034
01:02:26,165 --> 01:02:27,329
(Cam thuds)

1035
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:30,343
If there's one thing these
kids need, it's consistency.

1036
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,369
God knows they didn't get it at home.

1037
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,229
- How would you know?

1038
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:38,789
- I ran a halfway house
for runaways up in Seattle,

1039
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,739
right after I got out of seminary.

1040
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,183
- [Gordon] Well I can't
vouch for your work, Eddie.

1041
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:47,990
- They could have left you up
on that mountain top to die.

1042
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,889
That kid, Cam?

1043
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:53,163
He gave you mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

1044
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:57,329
You didn't need it, but
he didn't know that.

1045
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:58,819
- What's wrong with this thing?

1046
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,323
I can't get through to 911.

1047
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,310
- Call the operator. They'll connect you.

1048
01:03:07,499 --> 01:03:10,079
I don't know, maybe you're right.

1049
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,030
Maybe they would be better off in jail.

1050
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:17,313
Tried as adults, put in
with hardened criminals.

1051
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,743
Can't be any worse than
what they grew up in.

1052
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,139
Crystal learned the meaning of hot

1053
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,290
when her mother burned
her with cigarettes.

1054
01:03:29,149 --> 01:03:30,345
- [Operator] Hello, this is the operator.

1055
01:03:30,346 --> 01:03:31,509
How may I help you?

1056
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:32,789
- Hello. Uh, yes.

1057
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:35,449
Could you please connect
me to the local police?

1058
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:36,973
This is an emergency.
- Look.

1059
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,349
Those kids did a terrible
thing kidnapping you,

1060
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:45,259
but they're young and they can change.

1061
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,860
They're at a critical point now.

1062
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,593
So I'm asking you, Gordon.

1063
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,713
I'll beg you if I have to.

1064
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:58,069
I want just one adult besides myself

1065
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,933
giving these kids another chance.

1066
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,250
I'm finished.

1067
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,800
- [Man] Fresno Police, please hold.

1068
01:04:07,835 --> 01:04:09,517
- [Eddie] It's up to you and God now.

1069
01:04:14,627 --> 01:04:16,923
- [Man] Fresno Police
Department, may I help you?

1070
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:18,843
Hello?

1071
01:04:18,844 --> 01:04:20,379
- Hello.

1072
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,500
Yes. I'd like to...

1073
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:28,940
Nevermind.

1074
01:04:29,806 --> 01:04:32,166
(Eddie sighs)

1075
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:33,823
How do you hang up this thing?

1076
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:38,286
- God bless you, Gordon.

1077
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,143
Where would any of us be
without a second chance?

1078
01:04:46,475 --> 01:04:49,286
- [Cam] Hey, Fish-Man, back from the dead!

1079
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:51,501
- [Crystal] Fish-man,
Fish-man, he's our man.

1080
01:04:51,502 --> 01:04:53,991
If he can't do it, no one can!
- Gordon!

1081
01:04:53,992 --> 01:04:54,964
Where are you going?

1082
01:04:54,964 --> 01:04:55,964
- Listen.

1083
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:59,709
I know you're anxious to get going,

1084
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:01,409
but how'd you like to join me for a soak

1085
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:03,189
in my healing waters?
- Thank you,

1086
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,519
but I really must get home.

1087
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,490
I must.

1088
01:05:05,491 --> 01:05:09,199
- [Eddie] Well your car's in
the driveway behind the garage.

1089
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,250
It's been a pleasure.

1090
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:19,230
- Hi.

1091
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,548
I'm glad you're feeling better.

1092
01:05:21,549 --> 01:05:23,059
- Yes I am.

1093
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,749
- I bought you this.

1094
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:26,939
It's kind of a get well present.

1095
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:27,990
- It's not necessary.

1096
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,659
- Bottle of aspirin, extra strength,

1097
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,473
Dr. Scholl's bunion pads,

1098
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,219
tube of Colgate, and a toothbrush.

1099
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,470
Medium bristle, not firm.

1100
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,543
- No Bromo?

1101
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:56,563
I am dying to brush my teeth.

1102
01:05:58,836 --> 01:06:01,086
(brushing)

1103
01:06:05,654 --> 01:06:06,654
Blegh.

1104
01:06:11,785 --> 01:06:15,059
- She's a good one.

1105
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,329
- [Gordon] Well she's a lot
different than the other two,

1106
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:17,609
I'll give you that.

1107
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:19,500
- This reunion with her mother...

1108
01:06:22,068 --> 01:06:24,103
I pray that it's going to work out.

1109
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,409
But I got to tell you,
I have serious doubts.

1110
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,710
She's just not going to
make it on the street.

1111
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:34,039
If it wasn't for Cam looking after her,

1112
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,580
God knows what would've happened.

1113
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,120
Something's bothering me, brother.

1114
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,010
Why were you kidnapped?

1115
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:48,730
- What?

1116
01:06:49,876 --> 01:06:51,629
- Have you thought about that?

1117
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,663
I mean, in the deeper sense.

1118
01:06:55,652 --> 01:06:57,719
- What are you talking about?

1119
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,619
- Bear with me here a moment,

1120
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,120
'cause I've been giving
this some serious thought.

1121
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,253
Now I don't know what's
been going on in your life,

1122
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,679
but it's my belief that somehow,

1123
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,583
some way God came through for you.

1124
01:07:14,913 --> 01:07:15,916
It's something to think about.

1125
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:18,926
- You're some operator, you know that?

1126
01:07:18,927 --> 01:07:20,929
But you're wasting your time.

1127
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:23,430
I'm not about to be baptized
here in your hot tub.

1128
01:07:24,552 --> 01:07:25,703
(Cam yells)

1129
01:07:25,704 --> 01:07:28,037
(splashing)

1130
01:07:36,337 --> 01:07:39,314
I think you better let him up.

1131
01:07:39,315 --> 01:07:41,448
(Cam gasps)
- Sorry, kid, I scare ya?

1132
01:07:41,449 --> 01:07:42,626
(Cam gasps)

1133
01:07:42,627 --> 01:07:44,989
(splashing)
Good.

1134
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:46,382
Just a little private matter.

1135
01:07:46,383 --> 01:07:49,459
He reminds me of me at his age.

1136
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,293
- I can see that.

1137
01:07:50,294 --> 01:07:52,133
I don't know which one of you is worse.

1138
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:56,080
(Cam gasping)

1139
01:07:58,334 --> 01:08:01,049
(Cam laughs)

1140
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:02,500
- It's a long haul, Fish-Man,

1141
01:08:03,594 --> 01:08:05,894
so I thought you could
use some driving music.

1142
01:08:07,799 --> 01:08:09,249
- What about my credit cards?

1143
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,399
- [Jodi] Hey, wait, wait.

1144
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,600
You didn't sign my cast.

1145
01:08:26,434 --> 01:08:27,267
(smacks)

1146
01:08:27,268 --> 01:08:29,419
(Crystal chuckles)
- Sorry.

1147
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,493
I guess you weren't such a dud after all.

1148
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:37,560
- Thanks again, Gordon.

1149
01:08:38,839 --> 01:08:40,349
You sure you don't want to trade?

1150
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:44,539
This baby would make a terrific
prize for the church raffle.

1151
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:45,540
- I don't think so.

1152
01:08:49,365 --> 01:08:51,782
(soft music)

1153
01:09:05,489 --> 01:09:08,739
(police siren wailing)

1154
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:20,016
- [Officer 1] Three kids, right?

1155
01:09:20,017 --> 01:09:20,850
(police radio chatter)

1156
01:09:20,851 --> 01:09:22,583
I don't see 'em.

1157
01:09:22,584 --> 01:09:23,550
(police radio chatter)

1158
01:09:23,551 --> 01:09:26,309
- [Officer 2] They're probably
armed. Watch yourself.

1159
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:27,573
Okay, check the floor.

1160
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:30,238
- [Officer 1] They're not in here.

1161
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,819
- All right, you can
put your hands down now.

1162
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:34,539
You want to open the trunk, please?

1163
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,489
- Can I ask you what you're looking for?

1164
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:37,969
I'm on my way back to Seattle.

1165
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:39,620
I've got a long trip ahead of me.

1166
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,529
- All right. Where'd the kids go?

1167
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:47,329
- Well they're not in there.

1168
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:48,330
- Where are they?

1169
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:51,290
- I've decided not to press charges.

1170
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,019
- Let me explain something
to you. Mr. Trout.

1171
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:58,249
Interstate kidnapping
is a serious offense.

1172
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,539
Now just because you've decided

1173
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:00,649
you don't want to press charges,

1174
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:03,199
that doesn't mean a crime
hasn't been committed.

1175
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,609
Now you're going to have
to come down to the station

1176
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:05,829
and answer some questions.

1177
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:07,190
- How long is this going to take?

1178
01:10:07,191 --> 01:10:10,071
- You want to ride with us or
do you want to follow behind?

1179
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:13,072
(soft, tense music)

1180
01:10:24,907 --> 01:10:28,157
(police radio chatter)

1181
01:10:30,064 --> 01:10:33,064
(soft, tense music)

1182
01:10:46,281 --> 01:10:49,864
(train track bell ringing)

1183
01:10:51,824 --> 01:10:54,824
(train horn blares)

1184
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:09,184
(soft, mysterious music)

1185
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,474
- [Gordon] Changed my mind.

1186
01:11:42,475 --> 01:11:43,939
- You want to be baptized?

1187
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:46,939
- I want to trade. My Cadi for your truck.

1188
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,579
But it's got to run.

1189
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:49,500
- [Eddie] It runs all right,

1190
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:51,954
but it's still not an even trade.

1191
01:11:51,955 --> 01:11:55,038
(soft, upbeat music)

1192
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,194
- [Gordon] Now, let's
say we get this started.

1193
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:07,500
Get Jodi by Christmas.

1194
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:08,834

They're for my mom.

1211

1212
01:13:26,397 --> 01:13:28,744
- I'd like to have this

1213
01:13:28,745 --> 01:13:29,578

1223
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,519
The reason I'm calling is to
tell you that I'm all right.

1224
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,599
- [Donald] But dad, you're
wanted by the police.

1225
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,939
They said to me-
- I don't care what

1226
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:14,537
they said to you.

1227
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:16,519
- [Donald] You ran away from them?

1228
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,819
- Does your mother know?

1229
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,259
- She called here when you didn't

1230
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:20,539
show up in Puerto Vallarta.

1231
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,490
She's cutting her trip short.

1232
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:23,719
She'll be docking in
San Diego on the 26th.

1233
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,919
- [Gordon] San Diego?

1234
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,341
- You're putting your mother in danger.

1235
01:14:27,342 --> 01:14:29,123
- [Gordon] Hold it, one second.

1236
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:32,669
- Dad?
- Is that the 26th?

1237
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:34,620
- Yeah.
- At what time?

1238
01:14:34,621 --> 01:14:36,329
- I don't know. Morning.

1239
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:37,959
Look, where are you?

1240
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,276
- [Gordon] I don't wanna tell you.

1241
01:14:39,277 --> 01:14:40,206
- But...

1242
01:14:40,207 --> 01:14:41,781
What do you mean you
don't want to tell me?

1243
01:14:41,782 --> 01:14:42,969
- [Gordon] I've gotta
go. The kids need me.

1244
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:43,803
- What?

1245
01:14:43,804 --> 01:14:46,119
You're still with them?

1246
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:49,519
Uh, listen, you're not
suffering from that, uh,

1247
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,459
Patty Hearst syndrome, are you?

1248
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:54,689
You know, identifying
with your kidnappers?

1249
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:55,754
- [Gordon] Stop that.

1250
01:14:55,755 --> 01:14:56,588
They're just kids.

1251
01:14:56,589 --> 01:14:58,919
- Come on, dad. You can't believe that.

1252
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,009
This girl is wanted for prostitution.

1253
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:04,029
She cut up her foster father
the day you were kidnapped.

1254
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:06,479
And the boy's got a rap
sheet you can't believe.

1255
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,869
- Donald, son...

1256
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:08,949
- If they're caught, they're going back

1257
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,659
to juvenile hall or worse.

1258
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,079
You can bet on that.
- Donald.

1259
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,379
- And then-
- Do I tell you

1260
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:14,999
I love you enough?

1261
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,654
- [Donald] What?

1262
01:15:16,655 --> 01:15:17,655
Dad? Dad?

1263
01:15:17,656 --> 01:15:20,585
(phone thuds)

1264
01:15:20,586 --> 01:15:21,586
Dad?

1265
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:30,333
(sawing)
(air dryer whirring)

1266
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:31,807
(knocking)

1267
01:15:31,808 --> 01:15:33,143
- What?

1268
01:15:33,144 --> 01:15:37,894
- [Gordon] Crystal, what are
you doin' in the men's room?

1269
01:15:38,911 --> 01:15:40,994
(sawing)

1270
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:44,966
- Come to the party.

1271
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:47,050
(sawing)

1272
01:15:48,128 --> 01:15:50,019
- What do you think you're doing?

1273
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:50,853
- It's okay.

1274
01:15:50,853 --> 01:15:51,830
I asked him.

1275
01:15:51,831 --> 01:15:53,747
I can't go home with a cast on my arm.

1276
01:15:55,544 --> 01:15:56,847
- Here, take this.

1277
01:15:56,848 --> 01:15:58,322
Give me the saw.

1278
01:15:58,323 --> 01:15:59,800
- Cool, snacks.

1279
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:01,301
- Hold very still.

1280
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:05,625
(sawing)

1281
01:16:07,306 --> 01:16:09,889
(gentle music)

1282
01:16:11,632 --> 01:16:12,632
- 12412.

1283
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,400
Okay, 12418.

1284
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:20,437
This is good, you can let me out here.

1285
01:16:22,178 --> 01:16:24,761
(gentle music)

1286
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,439
- Now remember we'll be at the
Quality Court till tomorrow.

1287
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,319
Room 420. Just in case you want
to reach us for any reason.

1288
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,320
- She won't need to.

1289
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:38,850
We're going to miss you.

1290
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:42,973
You kept us, ah, well, you
tried to keep us honest.

1291
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:46,407
We'll send you a pinata from Mexico, okay?

1292
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:48,874
- Thanks.

1293
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:51,860
Bye, Cam.

1294
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:55,298
- Yeah.

1295
01:16:55,299 --> 01:16:56,299
Take it easy.

1296
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,400
- Don't I get a kiss?

1297
01:17:01,494 --> 01:17:02,494
- Yeah.

1298
01:17:04,046 --> 01:17:06,928
(kisses)

1299
01:17:06,929 --> 01:17:09,512
(gentle music)

1300
01:17:13,877 --> 01:17:16,053
- I'm sorry for what we did.

1301
01:17:17,557 --> 01:17:19,830
But I'm sorta not, you know?

1302
01:17:21,969 --> 01:17:24,552
(gentle music)

1303
01:17:49,442 --> 01:17:51,838
- [Boy] She's here!

1304
01:17:51,839 --> 01:17:54,672
(boys chattering)

1305
01:17:58,715 --> 01:18:00,906
- [Celeste] Let me look at you.

1306
01:18:00,907 --> 01:18:03,119
- [Cliff] You outdid
yourself this time, Celeste.

1307
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,663
- Thank you.
- Mom, it was fantastic.

1308
01:18:09,547 --> 01:18:12,347
- And you never told me your
daughter was such a looker.

1309
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,710
- Well, of course she's a looker.

1310
01:18:16,641 --> 01:18:20,043
I mean, after all, she
takes after her mama.

1311
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:26,365
(kissing)
(laughing)

1312
01:18:26,366 --> 01:18:27,199
You tired?

1313
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,757
- No.
- How about a now?

1314
01:18:28,758 --> 01:18:29,831
- No.

1315
01:18:29,832 --> 01:18:31,332
I gotta get goin'.

1316
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:34,769
Come on, Jenny, get your sweater, sweetie.

1317
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:35,809
- What do you mean?

1318
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:37,479
- I told you, Jenny and I are going

1319
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,614
to her mom's for Christmas Eve.

1320
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,570
Get your coat. Come on, Jenny.

1321
01:18:40,571 --> 01:18:41,849
- No, Jenny, wait a minute.

1322
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:43,829
You didn't tell me that.

1323
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:46,048
This is the first time
I've heard about it.

1324
01:18:46,049 --> 01:18:47,959
- What did I tell you
at the base? Remember?

1325
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,489
After the party, I said that we're going

1326
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:51,899
to come back here and have
dinner with your daughter

1327
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,641
and then I was going to take Jenny,

1328
01:18:53,642 --> 01:18:54,475
I was going to take Jenny

1329
01:18:54,476 --> 01:18:55,769
over to her mother's for Christmas Eve.

1330
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:56,829
I told you.
- No, no, no.

1331
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:59,119
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, please.

1332
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,369
No, it's too much for me.

1333
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:02,943
Um, look, my daughter is home.

1334
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:07,339
I have not seen her for almost a year.

1335
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:09,529
You're not just gonna walk out like this.

1336
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:12,059
- Listen, Jodi and I
will have plenty of time

1337
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,049
to get to know each other, right?

1338
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,599
Huh?

1339
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,076
- Well, here's your
jacket and I'm wearing it,

1340
01:19:17,077 --> 01:19:19,083
so you can't go.

1341
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:23,749
Cold in here without you. Don't go away.

1342
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:24,583
- Come on.

1343
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:25,416
- No.
- Come on, baby.

1344
01:19:25,416 --> 01:19:26,359
- Come on, please.

1345
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,419
Just stay.
- Give me my-

1346
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:28,929
- [Celeste] Just stay with me.

1347
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,059
- [Cliff] Just give me the coat.

1348
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,989
- I'm not giving you the
coat. I want you to stay.

1349
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:34,239
Please.

1350
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,509
- Give me the coat.
- No!

1351
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:37,099
- Now, Celeste.

1352
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,923
Don't act like this in front
of your daughter, okay?

1353
01:19:39,924 --> 01:19:40,871
- I'm sorry.
- Now come on.

1354
01:19:40,872 --> 01:19:41,969
- I'm sorry.
- Come on. Jenny.

1355
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:43,129
- Look.

1356
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:44,259
Please-
- March.

1357
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:45,599
- Grab your sweater, Jenny.

1358
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,809
- Just tell me when
you're gonna come back.

1359
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:48,369
When can I expect you back?

1360
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:49,659
When are you coming back?

1361
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,679
Just...
- Don't push me, Celeste.

1362
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:52,513
- I'm not pushing you.

1363
01:19:52,514 --> 01:19:56,967
I just wanna know when you're
gonna come back, just...

1364
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,120
- Mom?

1365
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,740
Mom, did you see what I
got you for Christmas?

1366
01:20:04,287 --> 01:20:05,287
You want to open it now?

1367
01:20:05,288 --> 01:20:07,136
- No, I don't want, no.

1368
01:20:07,137 --> 01:20:08,509
I don't wanna open anything.

1369
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:09,895
Just leave me alone.

1370
01:20:09,896 --> 01:20:11,059
Just leave okay?

1371
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:14,749
Look, I just want a drink, that's all.

1372
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,115
You know what I mean.

1373
01:20:16,116 --> 01:20:17,557
Don't bug me when I'm drinking.

1374
01:20:17,558 --> 01:20:19,141
I've told you that.

1375
01:20:21,887 --> 01:20:22,889
- You know, she might not take me back.

1376
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:25,179
It might be too late.

1377
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,769
But I'm going to be there.

1378
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:28,319
And the moment she walks off that boat,

1379
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,633
the first thing she's going to see is me.

1380
01:20:30,634 --> 01:20:32,599
(Gordon laughs)

1381
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,789
- That is so rad, Fish-Man.

1382
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,720
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.

1383
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,173
- So, what are your plans?

1384
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,069
- We're going to Mexico to enjoy

1385
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,319
a lovely burrito by the water.

1386
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,575
- Burritos rock.

1387
01:20:48,576 --> 01:20:50,889
(Crystal laughs)

1388
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:52,259
- That's not a plan.

1389
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,943
- Yeah? What do you
know about it, Fish-Man?

1390
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:58,959
- Nothing, but running
away from your problems

1391
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,483
doesn't solve anything.

1392
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,213
That much I do know.

1393
01:21:05,697 --> 01:21:10,209
- You know, Fish-Man,
you might want to leave

1394
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:12,173
the preaching up to the preacher man.

1395
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:15,773
You kind of stink at it.

1396
01:21:16,937 --> 01:21:18,462
(Gordon laughs)

1397
01:21:18,463 --> 01:21:19,633
- Yeah, I suppose I do.

1398
01:21:19,634 --> 01:21:20,909
(laughing)

1399
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:22,119
- [Crystal] Yep.

1400
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:22,953
- Waiter.

1401
01:21:22,953 --> 01:21:23,953
Sir.

1402
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:27,930
I think there's a mistake here.

1403
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,649
Shouldn't that be 47?
- Mm-hm.

1404
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:32,650
That is a seven.

1405
01:21:35,802 --> 01:21:36,849
- Oh.

1406
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:37,929
Sorry.

1407
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:38,930
Thank you.

1408
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:41,330
- [Waiter] You're gonna need bifocals.

1409
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:43,310
- [Crystal] Wow.

1410
01:21:44,186 --> 01:21:46,219
- Man. (scoffs)

1411
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:48,810
I thought only I got treated like that.

1412
01:21:48,811 --> 01:21:49,790
- Well...

1413
01:21:49,791 --> 01:21:51,473
- No, I got it.

1414
01:21:51,474 --> 01:21:52,839
I got it.

1415
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,107
No, I got it.

1416
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:00,829
See, the guy is wrong.

1417
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:02,293
It's not seven.

1418
01:22:03,309 --> 01:22:04,819
It's ate.

1419
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:05,993
- Crystal.

1420
01:22:05,994 --> 01:22:07,915
(laughing)

1421
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:08,749
Uh oh.
- Come on,

1422
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:09,950
let's get out of here.
- Uh oh.

1423
01:22:10,747 --> 01:22:11,743
- Come on.

1424
01:22:11,744 --> 01:22:13,372
Let's go.

1425
01:22:13,373 --> 01:22:15,623
(laughing)

1426
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,100
- Mom?

1427
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,333
Mom, are you all right?

1428
01:22:30,591 --> 01:22:32,763
- Just, just close the door.

1429
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:41,363
I want you out.

1430
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:43,770
Tonight.

1431
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:49,579
- What did...

1432
01:22:51,288 --> 01:22:52,288
What did I do?

1433
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:59,543
- You think I didn't see
what you were up to tonight?

1434
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:03,829
You think I didn't see the looks

1435
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:05,753
you were giving to my fiance?

1436
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,400
- Mom?

1437
01:23:14,315 --> 01:23:15,638
What are you talking about?

1438
01:23:15,639 --> 01:23:18,029
- Don't act stupid with me, Jodi.

1439
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:19,030
- I know you.

1440
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:23,509
And you're not going to pull any

1441
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:25,389
of your dirty little tricks on Cliff

1442
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:27,169
the way you did with Jack.

1443
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:30,849
- My stepfather raped me and you know it.

1444
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:32,178
- Shut up.

1445
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:33,943
I don't want to hear that!

1446
01:23:33,944 --> 01:23:36,299
You're a liar and you're
not going to drive

1447
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,943
another husband out of my life!

1448
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,433
- I need you, mom.

1449
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,629
I spent eight months on the
street and I am not going back.

1450
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:48,279
- That was your choice.

1451
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,430
- This is my home, too.

1452
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:52,770
- No.

1453
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,200
It isn't your home.

1454
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:57,793
It's my home.

1455
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:00,150
So get out.

1456
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,170
Get out now.

1457
01:24:04,193 --> 01:24:05,163
Get out!

1458
01:24:05,164 --> 01:24:06,929
Get out now!

1459
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:07,930
Just get out!

1460
01:24:08,736 --> 01:24:09,736
Get out!

1461
01:24:10,616 --> 01:24:11,621
Get out.

1462
01:24:11,622 --> 01:24:14,372
(glass shatters)

1463
01:24:16,179 --> 01:24:19,012
(insects buzzing)

1464
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:24,183
(train horn blares)

1465
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:25,184
- Woo!

1466
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,495
(tracks rattling)

1467
01:24:29,496 --> 01:24:30,679
- You think he's safe?

1468
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,479
I mean a gust of wind could,

1469
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,334
could suck him under or something.

1470
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:35,168
(Crystal laughs)

1471
01:24:35,168 --> 01:24:36,104
- [Cam] Woo!

1472
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:37,799
- He'll be fine.

1473
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,535
(Cam laughs)

1474
01:24:39,536 --> 01:24:41,069
I don't know, Jodi said that he didn't

1475
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:42,693
even know his father, but,

1476
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:47,240
supposedly he sent him a toy
train for Christmas once.

1477
01:24:49,972 --> 01:24:50,805
Pathetic, isn't it?
- Woo!

1478
01:24:50,806 --> 01:24:54,138
(train tracks rattling)

1479
01:25:01,497 --> 01:25:03,959
- And then when his father dies,

1480
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,549
James Stewart inherits
his savings and loan

1481
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:10,289
and then it runs into financial problems

1482
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:12,239
and then see, the banker is played

1483
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:16,009
by Lionel Barrymore and
he's a mean guy and anyway,

1484
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:17,659
he won't lend him the
money and then he gets

1485
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:19,059
into all kinds of trouble.

1486
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:20,759
And then when he, when he says

1487
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,400
I wish I was dead, then
the angel says to him

1488
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:26,689
okay, I'm going to show
you what it will be like

1489
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:28,329
if you were never born.

1490
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:31,639
So then he takes him out and then uh,

1491
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,989
and if he was never born,
then he wouldn't have a wife

1492
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:38,339
and he wouldn't have, you
know, any relatives or any,

1493
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:41,309
any friends in the town
and he can't understand it.

1494
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:43,099
And he goes through this emotional thing

1495
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,009
and he winds up on the top of a bridge

1496
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,209
and he's about to jump off.

1497
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:49,779
And, and it's, I shouldn't tell you

1498
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:50,613
too much about it though,

1499
01:25:50,614 --> 01:25:53,092
because I'm ruining it for you, you know?

1500
01:25:53,093 --> 01:25:54,649
Well anyway.

1501
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,159
I can't believe you haven't seen it.

1502
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,363
It's on every year.

1503
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,070
- Do you have any quarters?

1504
01:26:06,509 --> 01:26:07,342
- Quarters?

1505
01:26:07,343 --> 01:26:08,753
Yeah.

1506
01:26:08,754 --> 01:26:09,954
(change rattling)
Yeah.

1507
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,250
- Thanks.

1508
01:26:16,424 --> 01:26:19,259
(Crystal laughs)

1509
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:20,949
- I don't know, you'll
probably think it's dated

1510
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:25,950
but Donna Reed, I was
in love with Donna Reed.

1511
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,909
- [Crystal] Jodi?

1512
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:33,719
Jodi, what are you doing here?

1513
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,720
- [Gordon] Jodi.

1514
01:26:36,369 --> 01:26:38,033
(soft music)

1515
01:26:38,034 --> 01:26:42,669
- I, I thought I'd stop
by and surprise you.

1516
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:43,909
The manager let me in

1517
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:46,363
- What happened?
- What did she do?

1518
01:26:48,275 --> 01:26:50,173
- It's not worth talking about, so,

1519
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,600
what are you guys up to?

1520
01:26:54,423 --> 01:26:57,340
(melancholy music)

1521
01:27:00,427 --> 01:27:01,677
- I'm so sorry.

1522
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,480
What can I do?

1523
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,253
- Jodi, what's going on?

1524
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:14,840
What did you do?

1525
01:27:17,263 --> 01:27:20,180
(melancholy music)

1526
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,659
- This girl has taken
an overdose of pills.

1527
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,049
Her pulse rate is way down.

1528
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:35,969
- Someone will be right up to take her in.

1529
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:38,199
Meanwhile, I can start
filling out these forms.

1530
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,200
Um, her name?

1531
01:27:40,323 --> 01:27:42,823
(tense music)

1532
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:47,979
Sir, are you a relative?

1533
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:50,433
We're going to need a parent
or guardian's consent.

1534
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:53,030
- I'm her grandfather.

1535
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,283
Shoved in line ahead of me, Jodi.

1536
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:03,260
Should have been me lying there, not you.

1537
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:09,793
Last thing I expected is to be
woken up by some crazy kids.

1538
01:28:15,212 --> 01:28:18,295
I just wish I could take it all away.

1539
01:28:28,947 --> 01:28:32,393
Of all people, I should know
the right things to say, but,

1540
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,123
I never was very good with words.

1541
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:43,620
Hey.

1542
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:48,875
We were one crazy family
though, weren't me?

1543
01:28:48,876 --> 01:28:51,709
(Gordon sniffles)

1544
01:28:53,063 --> 01:28:55,980
(melancholy music)

1545
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:59,020
You're a good kid, Jodi.

1546
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:05,217
Don't let anyone ever
tell you that you're not.

1547
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:11,230
I have to go.

1548
01:29:15,015 --> 01:29:16,565
But I'll be back in a few days.

1549
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:19,610
That's a promise.

1550
01:29:27,014 --> 01:29:28,431
Okay, you guys...

1551
01:29:34,538 --> 01:29:37,183
- She's going to be all right.

1552
01:29:37,184 --> 01:29:38,851
We should get going.

1553
01:29:44,911 --> 01:29:45,911
You coming or not?

1554
01:29:46,827 --> 01:29:48,639
- Who's going to stay with her?

1555
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,640
- Fish-Man.

1556
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:52,973
I mean, unless you want to
hang out here and get busted.

1557
01:29:59,112 --> 01:30:00,120
- Eh...

1558
01:30:00,121 --> 01:30:02,006
(Crystal chuckles)

1559
01:30:02,007 --> 01:30:03,649
All right.

1560
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:05,099
Drop me off to the bus station.

1561
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,100
- Excuse me?

1562
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:13,283
- Fish-Man's covering my
bus fare back to Seattle.

1563
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:15,613
- What a loser.

1564
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:20,920
So um...

1565
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,433
What's up in Seattle?

1566
01:30:24,841 --> 01:30:25,841
- Eh...

1567
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:32,173
Eddie knows this guy who
runs this place, and uh,

1568
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,159
he thought maybe we could hook up.

1569
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,703
- You? You're going to work at a job?

1570
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:41,490
- Why not?

1571
01:30:42,282 --> 01:30:43,160
(Crystal laughs)

1572
01:30:43,161 --> 01:30:44,815
- Yeah, that'll last.

1573
01:30:44,816 --> 01:30:45,816
- What?

1574
01:30:49,271 --> 01:30:52,021
(Crystal laughs)

1575
01:31:09,871 --> 01:31:11,121
- Son of a gun.

1576
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:16,835

step out of the car.

- You're going straight through?

1594
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:23,319
I'm supposed to meet my wife
at the pier tomorrow morning

1595
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:24,359
at 10 o'clock.

1596
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,999
- [Man] Cutting it
awfully close, aren't ya?

1597
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
- I must be there.

1598
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:32,212
(soft music)

1599
01:32:50,882 --> 01:32:54,132
(police radio chatter)

1600
01:33:16,019 --> 01:33:17,719
- [Man] Hey, he's got my jacket.

1601
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,120
- Yep, that's him. Let's go.

1602
01:33:20,555 --> 01:33:22,805
- Suspect is on foot
entering the north gate.

1603
01:33:25,948 --> 01:33:28,948
(soft, tense music)

1604
01:33:34,482 --> 01:33:36,739
- [Woman Over PA]
Attention all passengers,

1605
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:39,279
please proceed now through....

1606
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:43,780

1607

(soft music)
(people chattering)

1608
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:56,296
- Okay, we've got him heading
towards the gangplank.

1609
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:57,941
Be cool, just follow my lead.

1610
01:33:57,942 --> 01:34:02,359
- [Woman Over PA] Please
proceed now through customs.

1611
01:34:03,524 --> 01:34:05,196
(soft music)
(people chattering)

1612
01:34:05,197 --> 01:34:06,420
- Barbara!

1613
01:34:06,421 --> 01:34:07,421
Barbara!

1614
01:34:08,567 --> 01:34:09,851
Barbara!

1615
01:34:09,852 --> 01:34:11,419
Barbara!

1616
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:13,503
(laughs)

1617
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:17,315
(soft music)

1618
01:34:21,484 --> 01:34:23,429
- [Barbara] Dear Crystal,

1619
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:25,879
you don't know me, but my husband, Gordon,

1620
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:28,149
has told me all about you.

1621
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:29,859
We've been praying that your release

1622
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:32,169
from juvenile hall will be soon.

1623
01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:34,139
A lot has happened lately.

1624
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:37,959
Jodi is officially the newest
member of the Trout family,

1625
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:40,569
and Cam's got a job working as a mechanic,

1626
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:42,139
thanks to Eddie.

1627
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:45,929
Cam is also helping out with a
street ministry for runaways.

1628
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,159
Eddie hopes to get Gordon baptized

1629
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,993
in his hot tub before summer.

1630
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:54,260
You know, I think he
might actually succeed.

1631
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:58,419
I know the world's been
tough on you, Crystal,

1632
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:01,079
and I understand how
it feels to be hopeless

1633
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:04,233
about the future, but God does love you.

1634
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:06,830
Don't give up.

1635
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:11,359
And when you get out, come
stay with your extended family.

1636
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,613
Gordon would like that.

1637
