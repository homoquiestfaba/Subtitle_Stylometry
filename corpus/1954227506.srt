82

developed what is known
as the Drake equation,

83

the number of planets

life in the galaxy.

85

equation was implemented in 2001,

an area around the star

92
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,575

Correct me if I'm wrong.

yourself at age five?

00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,086
- internet sites...
- Fuck you.

186
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,025
I don't think so.

190
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,440
That guy is so fucking weird.

191
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,683
- You're weird.
- Jesus.

Hey.

194
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,438
Sorry about that.

195
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,379
It's fine.

196
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,779
He's the one going
to homecoming alone.

197
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,509
You really wanna piss
him off, go with me.

00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,884
Trying to make me jealous?

200
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,990
Jealous?

201
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,098
In what way?

I'm the one for you, okay?
Don't get me in trouble here.

205
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,000
Get off me.

206
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,968
You know what I'm capable of.

Let's go.

00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:20,299
There you are, babe. I've
just started up the barbeque.

223
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,901
I'm just heading out, Dad.

224
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:26,445
Oh, I thought we was gonna
have a barbeque together.

225
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,909
Out where?

226
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,109
Dad, you don't have
to worry about me.

227
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,821
I'm not a little girl anymore.

Dad, you know what I mean.

229
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,899
Yeah, babe. You know,

230
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,769
me and you have to stick together.

231
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,666
I miss Mom, too.

232
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:58,139
But I don't wanna stay cooped up in
this house, feeling sorry all the time.

234
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,951
Should I be concerned?

235
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,380
Oh, with the wine?

236
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:12,788
Absolutely not. I always have a
glass of wine when I'm barbequing.

237
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,720
Come on, babe. Can't you
stay a little while?

238
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,656
I've got the barbeque on, come on!

239
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,994
- Come on, we'll work this out.
- Okay.

240
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:23,528
Good girl. Can you get the plates
then, and I'll get the steak on.

241
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,365
- Okay.
- How are we going for this, rare?

242
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,838
Medium rare.

00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,616
Well, can you blame him, babe?
You're a locker.

246
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,748
You've got your mum's
eyes, your mum's smile...

247
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,528
Okay, enough.

248
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,065
You know, the moment I set eyes
on her, I fell in love with her.

249
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,364
It took me a while though.

250
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,395
Got her to go for a walk with me.

251
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:01,366
She told me flat out, there and
then, that she wasn't interested.

252
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:06,741
And then for some bizarre reason, we ended
up doing this trip out here to the States.

253
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,074
Got together.

254
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,252
Stayed here, and never
went back to the UK.

Two years later, you were born.

Suppose I'm persistent.

257
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,495
I admire that in you.

258
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,425
And you make the world's
best corn on the cob.

259
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,028
Huh, you're only saying that
'cause it's mum's recipe.

(LAUGHS)

261
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,201
You know, babe, why don't you
just tell him how you feel?

262
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,106
It's kinda tough.

263
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,109
Why?

264
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,283
Bad timing.

265
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,579
I don't want him to think
it's some sympathy thing.

266
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,553
Why would he think that?

267
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,695
He's in the hospital.

268
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,127
For what?

269
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,124
It was stupid.

270
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,365
He got into a fight
with Robbie Mueller.

271
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,898
Robbie Mueller?

272
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,407
How do I know that name?

273
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:11,805
Remember when that boy choked
to death five years ago?

274
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,742
Yeah.

275
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,143
Robbie's the one
that got the blame.

276
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:21,216
He moved away. So he's back
now and he's at your school?

277
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,847
Just started.

278
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:26,061
Today, Greg got into
a fight with Robbie.

279
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,392
It was my fault, really.

280
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:33,729
So, you've got the boys fighting
over my princess, have ya?

281
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:36,839
I don't wanna talk about it, okay?

282
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,506
Okay, babe.

283
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,776
This Robbie Mueller, does he get
into a lot of fights, babe?

284
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,472
I don't know.

285
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,117
You said you used to fight a lot.

286
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,414
Can I be excused?

287
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,347
I should call Greg.

288
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,319
Of course, babe.

289
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,656
Do what you gotta do.

listen for a second, please?

00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:33,723
Greg. Greg, just listen to me.

293
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:39,228
You're not giving me a chance to
explain. You gotta understand...

No, that's not what happened.

295
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:45,569
No, but you don't
understand. Robbie...

296
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,333
No!

297
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,577
Seriously? No, that's
not what happened.

298
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,573
If you would just listen...

299
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,547
No, no, that's such shit!

300
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,919
No, Robbie didn't...

301

Greg, please listen.

00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,744
Dad, please.

00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,945
Hey!

309
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,717
- You're back.
- That was interesting,

310
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:44,023
what you said in class the other
day about life on other planets.

311
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,298
Look around.

312
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,732
Bible says we're the
center of the universe.

313
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,910
If this is the center,
it must be a sick joke.

314
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,635
Right?

315
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:03,050
Sorry about what
happened in the hallway.

316
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:07,146
Only person who's sorry is Greg.

317
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,251

318
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,791
Really?

319
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,725
You were the only friend I had.

320
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,527
There must've been some girls
after you at the other school.

321
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,829
No.

322
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:25,964
Not interested.

00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:29,337
Not interested in some
rich fathers daughter?

324
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:34,979
Not interested in their snotty, uptight,
God's gift to the universe attitude.

325
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,952
Not everybody is as
down to Earth as you.

326
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,093
Or as pretty.

327
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,668
Can I ask you something?

328
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,727
What do you think
happened in the hallway?

329
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,666
Hell, if I know.

330
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,536
He must've choked on something and then
tossed himself on the lockers to dislodge it.

331
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,515
Some people saw you touch him.

332
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,009
That's bullshit.

333
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,680
It was just like that day
after school five years ago.

334
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,824
Coincidence?

335
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:21,497
Both times I didn't touch anyone.

336
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,401
What are you getting at, Heather?

337
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,403
Just curious.

338
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:34,070
Just watch out for him, okay?

339
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:38,603
He's dangerous, he only
wants in your pants.

340
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:41,510
(SCOFFS) And how do you know that?

341
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:44,754
Pretty obvious, isn't it?

342
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,855
See ya.

343
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,021
Hey!

344
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,900
You never answered my question.

345
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,397
What question?

346
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,442
Homecoming?

347
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,606
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

348
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:17,344
Timing is impeccable, as always.

349
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:21,850
See you later.

350
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,685
Yeah.

351
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,253
See you later.

352
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,043
Do you wanna fill me in?

353
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:09,268
Hey, gorgeous, you need a lift?

354
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,163
Come on, Heather,
I'm in a lot of pain here.

355
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,264
Serves you right.

356
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,772
Gimme a break, you called

536
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,781
How's your dad?

537
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,354
Fucked.

538
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,520
He drinks, he works too much.

539
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,231
I mean, he worked too much before.

540
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,964
That's why Mom felt alone.

541
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,501
Made her depressed.

542
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:14,070
Now were all depressed.

543
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,670
I shouldn't be telling you this.

544
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,517
I wanna help.

545
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:25,545
Why?

546
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,147
Because I care.

547
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,081
We haven't seen each
other in five years.

548
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:34,022
Yeah, well, my feelings
never changed.

549
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,930
I'm a different person, Robbie.

550
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,496
So am I.

551
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:45,173
You have no idea what I've become.

552
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,744
It's all gonna be all right.

553
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,046
Okay?

554
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,941
(TV PLAYING)

555
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,978
Hey, babe.

556
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,506
I was calling you, why
didn't you pick up?

557
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:30,740
I was busy.

558
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,321
Can you just give me some space?

559
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,653
Well, where did you go?

560
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,482
- Where did you go?
- HEATHER: None of your business.

561
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:42,352
Hey, while you live under this
roof, I think it is my business.

562
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,654
School. I went to school.

563
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,901
But I thought I told you
you didn't have to go.

564
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:48,692
I wanted to.

565
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,836
My life. My decision.

566
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:53,570
I just need to be alone, okay?

567
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,505
Uh, no, it's not okay.

568
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,370
'Cause when I give you your freedom,
you nearly go and get yourself killed.

569
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,810
No wonder Mom was
always angry at you.

570
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,609
You take that back. You don't
know what you're talking about.

571
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,544
Then don't talk about Greg.

572
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:09,620
It's the same thing.

573
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,681
I'm gonna get to the
bottom of this.

574
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,817
It doesn't bring him back.

575
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,961
Just like Mom could
never come back.

576
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:20,191
Can we not talk about this?
I just want to go to sleep.

577
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:21,992
Well, what do you
know about this kid?

578
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,363
Who?

579
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:24,995
Robbie.

581
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:29,040

582
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,469
Good night!

583
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:06,436
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is Robbie in?

584
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,071
What did he do this time?

585
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,339
We're not sure.

586
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,160
I just need to ask
him some questions.

587
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:16,422
We're so tired of answering
your goddamn questions.

588
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,253
Ma'am,

589
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:21,594
it's in his best interest.

590
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:25,362
He's at the library.

591
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,134
I'm not sorry about it.

592
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,095
Sorry about what?

593
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,273
He was a class-A jerk.

594
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,710
You know he had it out
for Heather, right?

595
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:16,941
Truth hurts, Detective Elliot.

596
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:21,287
I'm impressed you
remember who I am.

597
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:28,152
See, the thing is, Robbie,

598
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,087
word on the street is that

599
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:34,733
you and Greg had a row in the
hallway the day before he died.

600
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,763
Row?

601
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,071
Never raised a hand.

602
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,973
Ask anyone who was there.

603
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:47,812
Maybe, ask your daughter.

604
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:51,582
But it's irrelevant.

605
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:55,456
- What does that mean?
- Well, he's been reduced to manure.

606
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:57,690
Plant fertilizer.

607
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:01,017
Finally being put to good use.

608
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,695
That's a bit harsh, isn't it?

609
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:05,095
The world is a harsh place.

610
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,034
Excuse me.

611
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,842
What book are you looking for?

612
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,472
<i>Medieval Methods of Torture.</i>

613
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:22,940
It's for a history book report.

614
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:26,318
You're into that stuff, are you?

615
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,657
- Isn't everyone?
- I don't know, you tell me.

616
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,623
You're the detective.

617
00:47:35,753 --> 00:47:38,055
Does this stuff give you ideas?

618
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,704
When I do something to a person

619
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,167
it's intentional.

620
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,841
Recommended reading for
you, Detective Elliot.

621
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:58,084
Oh, Robbie?

622
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:01,021
A little word of advice.

623
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,251
Stay away from my little girl.

624
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,490
We all done here, Detective?

625
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:09,758

You following me?

630
00:48:44,822 --> 00:48:47,568
Can I help you with something? Hey!

631
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,094
Hey.

632
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,404
What's the matter?

633
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:31,010
I think we should
keep our distance.

634
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,513
What's up?

635
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:41,211
Last night, your dad questioned me
like I was a suspect in Greg's murder.

636
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:44,015
- Are you serious?
- The guy's a dick.

637
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:48,758
So what?

638
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,320
You didn't do anything.

639
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:54,927
He also said that I should
stay away from you.

640
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,704
You can't listen to him, Robbie.

641
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,046
Father.

642
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,151
Do I know you?

643
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,789
We've met before.

644
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:28,798
Henry?

645
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:31,561
I came to your home five years ago.

646
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:34,831
I spoke with your daughter about the
incident with the boy who choked to death.

647
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:36,736
Yeah, I remember.

648
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:42,146
Now, you're investigating a similar case
with one of the boys who was involved.

649
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:44,882
It's not an accident.

650
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,148
It never has been.

651
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,547
How do you know?

652
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,521
It's a long story.

653
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:57,854
Well, I don't deal in stories,
Father. I deal in facts.

654
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,429
I know what you expect.

655
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,435
If you want to speak, call me.

656
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,616
Yeah, this is Elliot.

657
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:23,888

00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,269
I don't know.

662
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,966
I've never been to
a funeral before.

663
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:43,973
It sucks.

664
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:47,837
Are his folks even
having a funeral?

665

- MATT: I don't think so.
- Why not?

666

Come on, let's go.

My brother can get
us booze. Let's go.

675
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:43,934
Would you just knock
it off with him?

676
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:31,407
- Flem, thanks for coming.
- No problem.

677
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,943
- So, I did some looking into Mueller for you.
- And?

678
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,044
And nothing.

679
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,680
Seems to be your average,
everyday fucked up kid, John.

680
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,515
Usual shit.

681
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:41,684
Doesn't mean he
plowed into that boy.

682
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:45,121
No, but you gotta admit,
he's a person of interest.

683
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:47,095
Person of interest, that's funny.

684
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:50,900
You're watching one too many
of those CSI shows. (LAUGHS)

up through all this?

- She's all right, I think, you know.
- Yeah.

687
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,236
- She's a tough cookie like her mum.
- That's good.

688
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,572
She's gonna have to be.

689
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,040
John, they're throwing her
name around as a suspect.

690
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:05,945
- (SIGHS)
- I know.

691
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,778
Don't worry about it, okay.
I got it covered.

692
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:11,360
No one wants to put her through
the ringer, especially me.

00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,049
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

694
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,651
What about the priest?
Did you find anything out?

Well, I got to go meet
Heather for some food, so...

00:54:23,327 --> 00:54:25,495
- You do that.
- Thanks, I appreciate it.

00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:27,798
You know I appreciate it.

I don't wanna see anybody.

You don't have to, darling.

Look, this won't take a minute.
Just finish your food up, okay?

that right now.

712
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,955
Fair enough.

713
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:30,626
Assuming that you do believe in God, that
generally means that you believe in the devil.

714
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:32,128
There is a good and an evil.

715
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:34,636
Now these books explain this.

716
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:37,267
Get to the point, Father.

717
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,734
That is the point.

718
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,737
This, what's been happening,

719
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,339
it all involves history.

720
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:47,611
Everything that's been going on
around us has all been foretold.

721
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,517
Somehow you're going to bring all
this around to Robbie Mueller?

722
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:56,552
Don't you see this has everything
to do with Robbie Mueller?

723
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,230
Here, look.

724
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:05,202
"A child will be born with
the way of the wicked."

725
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:09,404
Look, the same year that
Robbie was born. Here.

726
00:56:11,235 --> 00:56:12,912
It's here.

727
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:16,911
Look.

728
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,753
"The child with the
wicked soul will rise."

729
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:22,778
This was written in
the Middle Ages.

730
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:26,253
The same exact account, the
same year Robbie was born.

731
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,519
Listen, listen to this.

732
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,890
"The demon will swallow
the breath of others."

733
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:38,697
Same exact way that Robbie swallowed
the breath of the boy five years ago.

734
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:42,798
It doesn't have Robbie's
name printed there.

735
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,268
It doesn't have to have
his name. I know it's him.

736
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:47,446
I've been following him for years.

737
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:49,405
Did you know Robbie's
mother was raped?

738
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,539
That's how she became pregnant.

739
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,642
Robbie never knew his
real father and then

740
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:55,444
suddenly his stepfather
dies of a heart attack.

741
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,725
And this is some sort
of a cult to you?

742
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,483
There are signs everywhere.

743
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:03,886
I admit, if you look at one particular
incident it doesn't make any sense,

744
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,155
but if you step back and
look at the whole picture

745
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:09,792
you can't possibly deny that there
is something going on here.

746
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,328
Robbie is a disturbed boy.

747
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:17,305
He's a violent outcast destined
to bring turmoil to the planet.

748
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:21,470
You don't believe me?

749
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:23,773
- See for yourself.
- What's this?

The pieces of the puzzle, all the
answers you're looking for are in here.

751
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:35,888
Are you trying to tell me he's
some kind of an omen kid?

752
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:39,465
It's hard to explain
exactly what he is.

753
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:41,492
This all sounds crazy.

754
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:45,795

and tell the guys I'm gonna

was acting so weird.

784
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:21,451
He said he could hear these voices.

785
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,422
He called them otherworldly voices.

786
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,434
And then, he started seeing things.

787
01:00:29,693 --> 01:00:32,837

01:24:18,921 --> 01:24:21,360
you haven't been around
for much of her life.

1063
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:24,498
It's got nothing to do with you.

1064
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,834
That's between me and Heather.

1065
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:29,540
- Now, where is she?
- She left.

1066
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:33,703
I didn't want her involved
in our unfinished business.

1067
01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:37,277
- That so?
- (CHUCKLES)

1068
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,408
- Going to shoot me?
- I don't know yet.

1069
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,416
I haven't made my mind up.

1070

Why did you kill Greg?

1071
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:47,255
Was you jealous?

of your little stories.

all over the crime scene.

Robbie!

1079

You better put that gun down before
you get yourself in more trouble

1080
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,944
- than you're already in.
- Oh, yeah?

1081
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,946
I could rid you this piece
of shit, right now.

1082
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,658
Don't! What are you doing?

No, Robbie!

You crazy young fool.

Are you okay, babe?

1089
01:26:10,232 --> 01:26:12,773
He's not what you think he is.

1090
01:26:14,803 --> 01:26:16,707
He's not the one.

- Stop it!

Whoa!

more time for the record.

JOHN: Well, we were down there
paying respects to the wife.

1102
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:50,099
He came out of the trees
waving a gun, I had no choice.

wanna get involved.
