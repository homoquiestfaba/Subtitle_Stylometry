<i>♪ A lot of things ♪</i>

3
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:23,206
<i>To truly understand
the soul of Canaan, Texas,</i>

4
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:25,275
<i>you'd first have to start
with the story</i>

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,517
<i>of two young boys.</i>

6
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:30,689
Rodney? Best be going.

7
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:32,931
That boy and his books.

8
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:36,103
- DJ.
- I'm comin'.

9
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:38,689
<i>Boys who were once
sworn enemies,</i>

10
00:00:38,724 --> 00:00:41,103
<i>one white, the other black.</i>

11
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:46,310
<i>And Bandit,
the puppy they'd found,</i>

12
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:48,379
<i>whose life they'd saved,</i>

13
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:51,344
<i>and by that act, became friends.</i>

14
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:58,034
<i>And there was Daniel Burton,
who despite struggling</i>

15
00:00:58,068 --> 00:01:00,275
<i>to raise his family
on his own...</i>

16
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,724
It's beautiful, Papa.

17
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:03,068
Rodney.

18
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:04,517
<i>Took the black boy in</i>

19
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:06,758
<i>when there was
no one else to do it.</i>

20
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:09,827
<i>An act of courage
in a town divided.</i>

21
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:17,172
<i>And then, the accident</i>

22
00:01:17,206 --> 00:01:20,206
<i>that left his youngest boy,
Bobber, crippled.</i>

23
00:01:22,137 --> 00:01:24,724
- Oh, almost got me.
<i>And finally,</i>

24
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:26,103
<i>it's the story of a promise.</i>

25
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:27,862
<i>- One boy...
- Cheers.</i>

26
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:31,448
<i>now a writer,
made to the other.</i>

27
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:34,517
<i>A promise to return to Canaan.</i>

28
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:38,172
<i>And with him, he brought a gift,</i>

29
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:40,689
<i>offered by a stranger.</i>

30
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:43,793
<i>A gift with the power
to change so much,</i>

31
00:01:43,827 --> 00:01:46,724
<i>in ways few
could have ever imagined.</i>

32
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:50,689
You sure you packed
enough clothes?

33
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:52,275
I've packed
most everything I got.

34
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,379
What about socks?

35
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,172
Here you go.

36
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:56,862
This enough for you?

37
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:58,389
Besides, it's a big city,
if I need anything,

38
00:01:58,413 --> 00:02:00,103
I can just buy it new,
right, Rodney?

39
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:01,734
- Anything you want.
- And just what are you

40
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:03,275
proposing to use for money,

41
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,448
your good looks?

42
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:06,310
I'll pack some of these for you.

43
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:14,827
Don't know for sure how long
we're going to be gone.

44
00:02:14,862 --> 00:02:17,724
You might have to handle the
harvest yourself this year.

45
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:19,241
Well, Rodney will pitch in.

46
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:22,931
Between the two of us,
we'll manage.

47
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:26,448
Anything else needs doing,
you're in charge.

48
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:28,413
And don't forget,
there's a little bit of cash

49
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,931
hid in the corner of the shed,

50
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:31,586
just for emergencies.

51
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,827
We'll get along fine.

52
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,344
You just take care of Bobber.

53
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,586
Daddy, DJ.

54
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,586
You need to hurry.

55
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,137
You'll miss your flight.

56
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:40,838
We wouldn't be the Burtons
unless we was fixin'

57
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:42,793
to miss something.

58
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:52,000
All right, buddy,
kiss your sister goodbye.

59
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:53,103
Bye.

60
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:54,620
And be sure to thank Rodney.

61
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:56,724
If it weren't for him,
we wouldn't be goin'.

62
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:59,241
Thanks, Rodney.

63
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:01,517
Just make sure you do
what those doctors say, okay?

64
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:03,068
I will.

65
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:04,655
Hey, just so as y'all know,

66
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:07,793
I'm not driving you
all the way to San Jose.

67
00:03:07,827 --> 00:03:09,137
All right, let's go.

68
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:25,206
- You ready, Bobber? Yeah.

69
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:33,172
California, ready or not,
here they come.

70
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,493
Boys,
I just remembered something.

71
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,689
Y'all got any gum?

72
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:39,344
What do we need gum for?

73
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:41,344
Keep your ears
from poppin' on the plane.

74
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:44,206
We can stop at Shoup's.

75
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's do it.

76
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:47,241
We got time.

77
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:51,413
I'll be right back, boys.

78
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,068
All right, well, hurry it up.

79
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,724
- Hello!

80
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:02,137
Ah, Mr. Burton.

81
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:03,620
Can I help you find something?

82
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:05,068
I need some chewing gum.

83
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:06,482
Juicy Fruit, if you got it.

84
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:09,448
Juicy Fruit, Spearmint,
Chiclets.

85
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,448
Complete assortment.

86
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:12,734
How's that brave, young,
Mr. Bobber?

87
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:13,724
I hope he's well.

88
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:15,137
Oh, fair-to-middling.

89
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,724
We're actually on our way
to California

90
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,620
to see about gettin' him
fixed up right now.

91
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:19,931
California?

92
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:21,931
Oh, if I had any sense,
I'd close up

93
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:24,241
and move to California myself
the way things are goin'.

94
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,275
Really?

95
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,517
Business been slow?

96
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:28,620
Oh, slower than slow.

97
00:04:28,655 --> 00:04:29,931
Dead.

98
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:31,620
You're my first customer
all day.

99
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:33,379
Well, I wouldn't worry
too much about it.

100
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:34,907
You know, money's always
tight around here

101
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,275
come the end of the month.

102
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,482
No, it's more than that.

103
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:38,793
The whole town's changing.

104
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:40,137
Old folks are moving away.

105
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:42,103
New folks
are shopping elsewhere.

106
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:45,206
Yeah. You know what,
if the town's changing,

107
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,448
maybe you ought to change
right along with it.

108
00:04:47,482 --> 00:04:50,517
And just what would you
suggest changing exactly?

109
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:51,517
Oh, I don't know.

110
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:53,103
Maybe try something new.

111
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:55,413
I heard about some boys
putting in a big company farm

112
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:56,827
south of town.

113
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:59,448
Bound to be needing
some farm supplies,

114
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:02,172
save 'em the trip to Clarksboro.

115
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:03,620
Hmm.

116
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:05,000
Farm supplies.

117
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:06,965
And just exactly what am I
supposed to know

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,034
about farm supplies?

119
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:04,482
Hi. Can I help you?

120
00:06:04,517 --> 00:06:05,758
Yes, ma'am.

121
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:07,931
I'm Daniel Burton,
this is my son.

122
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:10,241
We have an appointment
to see Dr. Hanson.

123
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:11,344
Just one moment.

124
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:18,551
- Yes?

125
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:21,413
Dr. Hanson,
the Burtons are here.

126
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,448
Thank you.

127
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,655
- Thank you, ma'am.
- You're welcome.

128
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,413
Please, come in. Have a seat.

129
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:28,724
I'm Daniel Burton.

130
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,344
This is my son, Bobber.

131
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,724
- Bob.
- Bob.

132
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:35,862
I'm Marcus Hanson.

133
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,724
Well, I'm glad
to finally meet you.

134
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:40,689
As you know,
I learned of your case

135
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:42,448
after reading
Rodney Freeman's book,

136
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:44,689
and approached him
with my offer to help.

137
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:47,758
As I told Mr. Freeman,
the medical school here

138
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:50,241
has a very advanced
neuro-orthopedics group,

139
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:52,034
and some good advances
have been made

140
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,586
in the whole field of spinal
injury rehabilitation,

141
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,586
so when I heard
about your story,

142
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,103
I thought you'd make
a good candidate.

143
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,965
As for the procedure itself,

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,931
we'll use special pins
and screws

145
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,758
to realign and stabilize
the damaged vertebrae.

146
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,482
And then, there'll be
an intensive period

147
00:07:08,517 --> 00:07:10,655
of physical therapy,
where we'll strengthen

148
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:14,275
some muscles and, uh, well,
retrain some others.

149
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,620
Now, you'll be doing most
of your work right in here.

150
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:18,448
Oh, good, there is Dr. Adair.

151
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:21,413
She's head of our post-op rehab.

152
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:24,344
Dr. Briony Adair, I want you
to meet Daniel Burton.

153
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:25,758
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Burton.

154
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,793
Thanks.
It's nice to meet you, too.

155
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:29,172
This is my son, Bobber.

156
00:07:29,206 --> 00:07:30,655
It's Bob.

157
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,482
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

158
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:34,310
You've got a lot of admirers
around here.

159
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:36,275
I've been giving them a tour
of the facilities.

160
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,137
Do you... Do you have time
to show Bob the therapy rooms?

161
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:40,206
Sure.

162
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:41,241
Come on.

163
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:45,896
The doctor, what's her name?

164
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:46,965
Dr. Adair.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Briony Adair.

166
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,931
- Briny?
- That's right.

167
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:52,827
Right. Hmm.

168
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:55,413
Level with me, Doc, I mean,

169
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:57,137
you really think
this is gonna work?

170
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:58,655
Well, we've had some success

171
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:00,241
in the past with similar cases,

172
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:02,724
so there's a good chance
he'll see some improvement.

173
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:04,689
So, what's the best-case
scenario?

174
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:06,631
Well, the best-case scenario
is that once we've relieved

175
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,896
the pressure on the nerves,

176
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:09,965
he'll regain full use
of his legs.

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,689
Well, what's the worst?

178
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,206
<i>At Churchill Downs,</i>

179
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:14,551
<i>it was Seattle Slew</i>

180
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:17,137
<i>winning the Run for the Roses
as the two-year-old</i>

181
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:18,482
<i>-odds-on favorite...</i>

182
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,620
- Hello? <i>Sissy?</i>

183
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,206
Daddy? Everything okay?

184
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,724
Yeah.

185
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,000
Um, I just got done
talking to the doctor

186
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:34,896
and, uh, things may not be
as rosy as we'd hoped for.

187
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:39,068
The doctor says the surgery
may not help all that much.

188
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:41,724
As a matter of fact, it could
even make things worse.

189
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:43,517
How's Bobber takin' it?

190
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:45,206
<i>Well, I haven't told him yet.</i>

191
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:46,827
To be honest,
I was kind of wondering

192
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,482
whether I should or not.

193
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:50,482
- He ought to know.
<i>Well, if he knows,</i>

194
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:52,379
<i>then he might not
go through with it.</i>

195
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:54,000
Then that's his choice.

196
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,793
Yeah, but this might be
the only chance he has,

197
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:59,413
and if Bobber gets wind of this

198
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:02,241
then he loses that chance.

199
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,586
And it's likely to be
the only one he has left.

200
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,448
Oh, here he is now.

201
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:08,862
You wanna say hi to Sissy?

202
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:11,448
No.

203
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,758
Hey, listen, he says
he'll speak at you later.

204
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:14,896
Okay.

205
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,206
Well, take care.

206
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:17,206
All right.

207
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:18,241
Love you.

208
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:21,448
Just catching them up
on the latest.

209
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:22,931
So I heard.

210
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:25,275
Be real nice if you told me,
though, first.

211
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:30,586
I don't want the operation,

212
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,448
not if it could make
things worse.

213
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:34,206
But, Bob,
I also told your father

214
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,034
that there's a good chance
that we would see improvement.

215
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:39,103
But you don't know for sure.

216
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:41,413
No, no, we don't. Not for sure.

217
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,137
Well, I wish you'd have
told me that

218
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:45,206
before everyone got
their minds made up.

219
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,793
And then I'd have told you
I wasn't interested.

220
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:49,103
I'm sorry, son.

221
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:50,896
It's just, I was afraid that...

222
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:53,034
Afraid you couldn't find a way
to fix what happened?

223
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:54,586
How many times I gotta tell you,

224
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,241
the accident wasn't your fault,

225
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:59,310
so it's not your job
to keep on trying to fix it.

226
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:01,379
I have an idea.

227
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:04,620
What if Bob and I
were to take a little walk?

228
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:06,827
No point.
I'm not changing my mind.

229
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:08,931
Just think of it
as a Sadie Hawkins dance.

230
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:09,931
Ladies' choice.

231
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:11,206
Can't say no.

232
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:14,068
Against the rules.

233
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:23,103
Here.

234
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:30,310
So, cards on the table.

235
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:32,379
Why the change of heart?

236
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:35,862
Like I said, nobody told me
it could make it worse.

237
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,241
It's a good reason.

238
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:38,551
No wonder you're upset.

239
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:42,793
Look, I get around good enough.

240
00:10:42,827 --> 00:10:44,551
I worked hard
to get around this good.

241
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:46,965
Why would I wanna risk
what I got?

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,793
- I can understand that.
- No, you can't.

243
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,448
No one can.

244
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:53,896
Not you, not my dad, nobody.

245
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:09,034
It's here, too.

246
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,689
What happened?

247
00:11:11,724 --> 00:11:13,793
I was about your age.

248
00:11:13,827 --> 00:11:17,655
There was an accident, a fire.

249
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:21,931
The doctors weren't even sure
they could save my arm.

250
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:25,310
So many skin grafts
and surgeries.

251
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:28,448
Sometimes, I wished
they'd just stop trying.

252
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,827
I about had,

253
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:34,172
but they never doubted
they could save my arm.

254
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:35,896
Turns out, they were right.

255
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:40,517
So, here's the deal.

256
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:42,620
If you decide
to have the surgery,

257
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:44,931
I will work with you, myself.

258
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:47,517
Just you and me.

259
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:50,172
But there's one thing
I won't do.

260
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:52,172
I won't let you quit.

261
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:56,137
Not until we have tried
everything we can.

262
00:11:56,172 --> 00:12:00,965
Bob, you've been given a gift,
just like I was.

263
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:05,206
If I were you,
I'd think real hard

264
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:07,206
before I decided
I wasn't interested.

265
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:20,655
How you feeling, bud?

266
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:23,034
A little drowsy?

267
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:24,068
Yeah.

268
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:28,172
- Pop?
- Yeah, bud?

269
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,000
If something goes wrong...

270
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,586
That's not gonna happen.

271
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,517
We've come too far for that.

272
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:37,275
But if something does,
I want you to know something.

273
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,965
What's that?

274
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,172
You're the best dad a fella
could ever hope to have.

275
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,862
You never gave up on me,

276
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:51,103
on any of us, but especially me.

277
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:56,000
You best get some sleep
now, bud.

278
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:58,482
We got a mighty big day
tomorrow.

279
00:12:58,517 --> 00:13:00,931
Yup, big day.

280
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:04,448
Mighty big day.

281
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:34,896
Any word?

282
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:46,586
<i>This is not
gonna happen overnight.</i>

283
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,275
<i>We've got to be realistic,</i>

284
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,344
<i>but we can try, we can start.</i>

285
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:52,931
<i>And next January,
we're gonna start.</i>

286
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>It's time for new leadership.</i>

287
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,103
<i>It's time for our country
to move.</i>

288
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,448
<i>It's time for a...</i>

289
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:32,344
- Hello? Dad?
- Well, all I can say is,

290
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:36,172
the boy's got more screws in
him than a John Deere tractor.

291
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:38,551
<i>Not to mention
all these rods and brackets,</i>

292
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,206
and titanium stuff
I never even heard of.

293
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:43,482
- He's okay? <i>Oh, he's fine.</i>

294
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:45,344
<i>Came through it like a trouper.</i>

295
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:47,379
When will we know if it worked?

296
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:49,517
Well, nobody's really
saying for sure,

297
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:51,689
not till he starts rehab anyway.

298
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,172
They should have a pretty
good idea by then.

299
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,586
Dr. Adair.

300
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,517
Briony, please.

301
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:05,793
Briny.

302
00:15:05,827 --> 00:15:07,379
I'd wanted to check on him
earlier,

303
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:08,586
but I got behind.

304
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,689
How's he doing?

305
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:11,448
He's out like a light,

306
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:12,862
but I guess that's good, right?

307
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:13,896
And you?

308
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:15,379
How are you holding up?

309
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:17,241
About how you'd expect.

310
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:18,551
Listen, I haven't eaten all day,

311
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,275
and I was gonna grab
a quick bite.

312
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,448
You're welcome to join me.

313
00:15:21,482 --> 00:15:23,034
Sure.

314
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:24,896
A fella's got to eat, I reckon.

315
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:32,655
You always been a city girl?

316
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:34,379
What makes you think
I'm a city girl?

317
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:35,965
I just figured.

318
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,068
You ever heard of
Crystal Springs, Mississippi?

319
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,137
Population 4,837.

320
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,310
Well, at least that's what
it was when I left.

321
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:44,389
Well, how in the heck did you
end up all the way out here?

322
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:46,413
Let's just say
a straight line isn't always

323
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:47,976
the shortest distance
between two points.

324
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,689
Huh, there's some truth to that,

325
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:51,044
especially if you've seen
me plow.

326
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:52,758
There's one.

327
00:15:58,275 --> 00:16:00,137
Mind if I ask you a question?

328
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:02,206
Be my guest.

329
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,793
How'd you get that nickname?

330
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:05,862
What nickname?

331
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:08,137
"Briny."

332
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:10,517
I mean, I-I know it's got
to be short for something,

333
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:13,137
but darned if I can
figure out what.

334
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,034
The only Briny I know
has to do with making pickles,

335
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:18,206
and for the life of me,
I can't figure out

336
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:20,275
how somebody as pretty as you

337
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,482
could get herself nicknamed

338
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:22,862
after something like that.

339
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:24,310
It's Briony.

340
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:26,379
Briony is a flower
that grows in Scotland.

341
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:27,458
It's where my father's from.

342
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:30,172
Hmm, it's nice.

343
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,655
I like it.

344
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:32,862
Briony.

345
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:37,965
I'm sorry.

346
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,379
I have to go.

347
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:41,034
I'll take care of that for you.

348
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,034
Thank you.

349
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,172
It's my pleasure.

350
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:45,482
It's the least I can do.

351
00:16:45,517 --> 00:16:48,862
Night.

352
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,896
I found them.

353
00:16:57,931 --> 00:17:00,103
And the new <i>Popular Science
just came in, too.</i>

354
00:17:00,137 --> 00:17:02,482
Uh, well, there's still
plenty of room in here.

355
00:17:02,517 --> 00:17:03,724
Anything else?

356
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:05,068
Oh, yeah, there's a whole bunch

357
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:06,389
of get-well cards
on the sideboard.

358
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:07,896
- Can you grab those for me?
- Yeah.

359
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:10,172
Hey, Sissy,
where's that hospital address?

360
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:11,931
It's over there on the hutch.

361
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:22,034
Hey, Sissy, what's this?

362
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:23,068
It's nothing.

363
00:17:23,103 --> 00:17:24,862
No, it's an application

364
00:17:24,896 --> 00:17:27,275
for the University of Texas.

365
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,827
Does Pop know about this?

366
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:31,379
No. It just came.

367
00:17:31,413 --> 00:17:33,068
Well, when did you plan
on telling him?

368
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:35,172
It's just an application.

369
00:17:35,206 --> 00:17:37,896
I'm not sure
I'll even send it in.

370
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,044
I just wanna wait till things
settle down a little bit

371
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:42,551
before I mention it.

372
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:44,448
Well, I wouldn't wait too long,

373
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:46,448
because if you are thinking
about leaving,

374
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,413
he deserves to know.

375
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:30,655
- Good morning.
- Morning.

376
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,344
How you feeling?

377
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,517
Like I've been in a fight
with a freight train.

378
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:36,148
Probably one of those
big Norfolk Southerns

379
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:37,793
used to roll by my house,

380
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,448
engines all painted up
with stripes,

381
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:41,827
like a big old catfish.

382
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:44,172
Okay. I'm gonna start
you out easy,

383
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,079
and you let me know
if I'm working you too hard.

384
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:48,241
And then, I'll work you harder.

385
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:49,551
- You ready?
- Yup.

386
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,517
Let's get cracking.

387
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:53,344
Show them what
you're made of, son.

388
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,172
Push back.

389
00:18:58,206 --> 00:18:59,206
Good.

390
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:10,758
Good work.

391
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:15,586
All the way to the end.

392
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:23,241
All right.

393
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:55,379
Good.

394
00:19:55,413 --> 00:19:56,689
Let me show you how to do this.

395
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:58,344
- Okay.
- Hold, just hold under here.

396
00:19:58,379 --> 00:19:59,827
And two more of those.

397
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:01,689
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

398
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:04,965
Just focus, concentrate.

399
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,413
Come on, bud, you can do it.

400
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:09,482
One more.

401
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:14,448
Come on.

402
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:15,793
Good.

403
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:17,551
I think that's enough for today.

404
00:20:17,586 --> 00:20:19,655
Why don't you go have
a long soak in the whirlpool?

405
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:22,137
You deserve it.

406
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:23,172
Ready?

407
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:26,000
Up.

408
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,724
Good job, buddy.

409
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:29,310
I'm proud of you.

410
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:32,562
You know,
I can't thank you enough

411
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:33,827
for all you've been doing.

412
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:35,310
It's my pleasure.

413
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:37,000
I've been trying to think
of some way

414
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:39,517
to thank you for all your help.

415
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,068
No, that's not necessary,
really.

416
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:45,000
I was kind of thinking
that maybe I could at least

417
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:47,862
just take you out
to a nice dinner?

418
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:49,320
There's this little place
that the guy

419
00:20:49,344 --> 00:20:52,551
at the hotel recommends,
called the Fireglow.

420
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:53,965
That is nice.

421
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,068
You been there?

422
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:56,482
No.

423
00:20:56,517 --> 00:20:58,862
Well, maybe we could go
together.

424
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:01,448
Are you asking me on a date?

425
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:06,241
I-I guess you could
call it that, I mean,

426
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,931
if it ain't against the rules,
I mean,

427
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:10,068
y'all got that doctor-patient

428
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,068
privilege rigmarole thing
going on,

429
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:14,586
so I don't wanna get you
in no trouble or nothing.

430
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,758
I'm sure we could find
a way to bend the rules.

431
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:19,206
After all,
you are the boy's father.

432
00:21:20,517 --> 00:21:22,310
I am his daddy, yeah.

433
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:32,241
- Hello?
- Hey, Sissy.

434
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:33,241
DJ there?

435
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:34,241
He's right here.

436
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:35,758
DJ! Dad wants to talk to you.

437
00:21:35,793 --> 00:21:37,620
No, actually,
I need both of you.

438
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:39,758
Both of us?

439
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:41,068
Hey, Daddy, what's up?

440
00:21:41,103 --> 00:21:42,896
Well, it seems
I got myself a date.

441
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:45,931
Daddy, that's wonderful!
Who is she?

442
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:47,655
<i>She's Bobber's rehab doctor.</i>

443
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:49,241
See, her and Bobber
hit it off so good,

444
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,724
I just wanted to show
my appreciation.

445
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:53,620
Okay.
So where are you taking her?

446
00:21:53,655 --> 00:21:55,068
<i>Oh,
I'm taking her out to dinner.</i>

447
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:57,448
The folks at the hotel
recommended this place.

448
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,482
Sounds romantic.

449
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:01,448
<i>Now, see,
that's why I need your help.</i>

450
00:22:01,482 --> 00:22:04,586
I ain't been out on a date
in 25 years, kids.

451
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,344
I don't know what to say.

452
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:07,793
What do I do? I...

453
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,620
You got to help me.

454
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:13,000
Well, let's start
with conversation.

455
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:15,758
Always talk about her,
never yourself.

456
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,551
And even when she asks
about you,

457
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,103
make it seem like you're still
talking about her.

458
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:22,689
Got it. Always talk about her.

459
00:22:22,724 --> 00:22:24,724
<i>And for heaven's sake,
whatever you do,</i>

460
00:22:24,758 --> 00:22:26,827
don't use "reckon"
every other word.

461
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:28,275
It makes you sound like a hick.

462
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,620
Well, dang flabbit, son!
Maybe I am just a hick.

463
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:32,655
Well, let her catch on
to that gradually.

464
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:35,275
You don't have to spring it
on her the first thing.

465
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,172
Anything else?

466
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:39,448
Isn't that enough?

467
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:41,517
Daddy, just relax.

468
00:22:41,551 --> 00:22:43,758
Relax and have a good time.

469
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:45,034
You'll do fine.

470
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:47,206
Okay.

471
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,517
Goodnight.

472
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,137
Relax, have a good time.

473
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:56,965
So, you think he's serious?

474
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,344
I don't know.

475
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:00,000
But I'll tell you
one thing for sure,

476
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:02,206
giving my dad advice
about women?

477
00:23:02,241 --> 00:23:04,068
Something kind of unsettling
about that.

478
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:05,103
Hmm.

479
00:23:05,137 --> 00:23:06,448
Hey, you want a soda?

480
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:08,379
Oh, sure, if you're buying.

481
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:11,206
Well, why should today
be any different?

482
00:23:23,448 --> 00:23:25,655
- Morning, Mr. Shoup.
- How you doing, DJ?

483
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:26,862
Good.

484
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:28,344
What's with the seed catalogs?

485
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:29,941
You ain't thinking
about farming, are you?

486
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:31,206
Nope.

487
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:33,620
But I am thinking about farmers.

488
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:36,896
Fact is, it was your dad
that got me started on it.

489
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:39,068
I might be carrying
a whole new line here.

490
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:40,379
Yeah, that might work.

491
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:41,896
You think so?

492
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:44,000
Well, farmers got to buy
their stuff somewhere,

493
00:23:44,034 --> 00:23:46,620
no reason it shouldn't be
from you.

494
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:49,103
I like the way you think, son.

495
00:23:55,965 --> 00:23:57,586
Mmm-hmm.

496
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:07,068
Welcome to the Fireglow.
May I help you?

497
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:09,172
Yes, sir, uh, Burton,
party of two?

498
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:10,586
I called in earlier.

499
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:15,310
Excuse me, sir, but, uh,

500
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:17,620
may I have a word with you?

501
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:18,655
Sure.

502
00:24:25,517 --> 00:24:28,344
I'm sorry, sir, but we require
our patrons to wear a tie.

503
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:30,344
Oh, I got on a tie.

504
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:33,344
I mean a tie-tie,
the normal kind.

505
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:35,413
I'm afraid I don't own
the normal kind.

506
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:37,310
I see.
Well, I'm sure we can find

507
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:39,137
something that will work.

508
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:49,896
That should suffice.

509
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:51,482
You think it's bright enough?

510
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:53,068
Well, let's just
call it colorful.

511
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:54,758
That'll be $5, please.

512
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,517
5 bucks? You're gonna need
to tie it for me.

513
00:24:58,482 --> 00:25:00,172
Let's see.

514
00:25:04,758 --> 00:25:07,000
There.

515
00:25:07,034 --> 00:25:08,034
Voila.

516
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:11,310
Voila.

517
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:19,965
What's that for?

518
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,620
Well, I guess I needed a tie.

519
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:24,137
You had a tie.

520
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:27,344
Ah, we're finally dressed
for dinner.

521
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:31,241
I thought I was dressed
when I got here but, uh...

522
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:35,827
Are we coming?

523
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:38,689
No, we're not coming.
We're going.

524
00:25:38,724 --> 00:25:40,862
I know a place where people
still have manners.

525
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:42,700
There's a great little
restaurant on the wharf.

526
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:44,896
- Uh, excuse me.
- It's not fancy, but it's got...

527
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:46,586
I'll need the tie.

528
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:49,241
Sure.

529
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:54,655
That should
get your fire glowing.

530
00:25:56,758 --> 00:25:58,517
Whee-doggies!

531
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:06,275
Thank you.

532
00:26:09,689 --> 00:26:12,724
Wow! Now, that
is what I call service.

533
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:15,068
I waited my share
of tables back home.

534
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:16,758
Hmm. Cheers.

535
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:18,103
Oh, cheers.

536
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,586
So when'd you decide
to become a doctor?

537
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,862
It's what I've always wanted
to be,

538
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:25,965
for as far back
as I can remember.

539
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,206
But even knowing early on,

540
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:28,965
I mean, it still
must have been long.

541
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,758
You have to make a lot
of sacrifices,

542
00:26:30,793 --> 00:26:33,068
but I'm sure you know
all about that,

543
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:35,931
considering you raised
a family all by yourself.

544
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:37,551
Not fair.

545
00:26:37,586 --> 00:26:39,896
You know way more about me
than I know about you.

546
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,724
What do you wanna know?

547
00:26:41,758 --> 00:26:43,965
- You a single lady?
- Now.

548
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,241
Oh. Are you seeing anyone?

549
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:47,413
My job keeps me pretty busy.

550
00:26:47,448 --> 00:26:50,068
- That would be a no?
- That would be a no.

551
00:26:50,103 --> 00:26:52,103
Ah. Hmm.

552
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:55,275
- Ever married?
- Mmm-hmm.

553
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,068
- Children?
- My folks sure enough thought we were.

554
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:00,955
You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

555
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:02,517
You got kids?

556
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:04,655
No.

557
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,965
Did you want some
malt vinegar with that?

558
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,275
I don't know, you tell me.

559
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,310
I'm pretty sure that you do.

560
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:23,793
It's not my prettiest feature.

561
00:27:23,827 --> 00:27:25,827
It doesn't matter.

562
00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:27,379
You're still beautiful.

563
00:27:29,655 --> 00:27:31,448
You wanna tell me about it?

564
00:27:32,793 --> 00:27:34,310
You mind me asking?

565
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:39,344
My mama and I
were canning preserves.

566
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:43,137
The boiler that she used to
sterilize the jars exploded.

567
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:44,793
It knocked a whole box
of paraffin

568
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:46,689
into the fire and all over me.

569
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:49,620
By the time we put it out,
I had third-degree burns,

570
00:27:49,655 --> 00:27:52,000
all the way up to my shoulder.

571
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:54,000
Eight surgeries later,

572
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:56,344
half a dozen skin grafts,

573
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:59,275
a lot of tears and hard work,

574
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,379
and here I am.

575
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,482
So, that's what did it.

576
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,448
Did what?

577
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:08,413
Changed Bobber's mind.

578
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:10,379
You told him about you,
didn't you?

579
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:13,000
I may have mentioned it.

580
00:28:14,758 --> 00:28:18,517
I want people to know
that it's okay to be afraid.

581
00:28:18,551 --> 00:28:21,103
Everybody's afraid of something,

582
00:28:21,137 --> 00:28:22,413
probably even you.

583
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:27,827
I'm not gonna be able to thank you
enough for all that you've done.

584
00:28:27,862 --> 00:28:30,620
You'll never know
how grateful I am.

585
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:33,068
I just remember reading
your story, thinking,

586
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:34,827
"Who is this guy?"

587
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:36,586
This Daniel Burton?

588
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,448
So strong.

589
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:41,206
Never backs down
from what he thinks is right,

590
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:43,413
"yet so kind."

591
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:46,000
Now you're embarrassing me.

592
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:48,241
I thought this guy
can't be real.

593
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:50,206
He's gotta be just
some character in a book.

594
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:52,379
But here you are.

595
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:54,862
I hope I'm not a disappointment.

596
00:28:54,896 --> 00:28:58,379
No, you're not a disappointment.

597
00:28:58,413 --> 00:29:01,689
Would it be all right
if I kissed you?

598
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:03,517
I'd never forgive you
if you didn't.

599
00:29:11,275 --> 00:29:13,724
Hope it wasn't against
the rules.

600
00:29:13,758 --> 00:29:15,310
It wasn't.

601
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:18,758
I wouldn't much care if it was.

602
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:38,413
We've stabilized the injury.
That's the important part

603
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:40,689
and judging
from the test results,

604
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:42,620
there seems to be
some modest improvement

605
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,310
in motor function.

606
00:29:44,344 --> 00:29:46,448
So what you're saying
is it didn't work?

607
00:29:46,482 --> 00:29:48,172
I'm saying there's improvement,

608
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:50,620
- and that's what we want.
- But the boy still can't walk.

609
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,275
Pa, it's okay.

610
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,655
It is some better, it really is.

611
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:58,482
It just seems to me like he's been through
an awful lot for only "some better,"

612
00:29:58,517 --> 00:30:00,000
that's all I'm saying.

613
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,517
You can't let yourself
get discouraged.

614
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:07,286
With ongoing physical therapy,
there's a chance

615
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,965
we could still see
continued improvement.

616
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,655
Just how am I supposed
to manage that?

617
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:14,448
We'll find someone near Canaan.

618
00:30:14,482 --> 00:30:17,448
I can even work with them to set
up a program specifically for Bob.

619
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,965
I'm happy to make
some phone calls.

620
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,517
Or you could just follow us back

621
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:21,631
and find someone in person.

622
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,241
Whoa, now, hold up here, son.

623
00:30:23,275 --> 00:30:25,517
We can't just ask Dr. Adair
to drop everything

624
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:27,758
she's got going on here
and fly off to Canaan.

625
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,079
I mean, especially
with the holidays

626
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:30,448
just around the corner.

627
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:32,448
Maybe she ought to spend
Christmas with us.

628
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:35,241
I'm sure she's got plans.

629
00:30:35,275 --> 00:30:36,793
- Do you?
- Bobber.

630
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:39,275
Actually, I don't.

631
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,931
Well, then it's settled.

632
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,344
She's spending Christmas with us

633
00:30:43,379 --> 00:30:45,965
and she can meet Sarah and DJ.

634
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,448
Oh, and Rodney will be there,
too.

635
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:50,551
- I don't want to impose.
Impose?

636
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:51,827
My dad doesn't even know

637
00:30:51,862 --> 00:30:53,344
the meaning
of the word "impose."

638
00:30:53,379 --> 00:30:55,103
- Do you, Pop?
- Of course,

639
00:30:55,137 --> 00:30:56,827
we'd love for you
to come join us,

640
00:30:56,862 --> 00:30:58,241
but you just need to know

641
00:30:58,275 --> 00:30:59,724
what you're getting
yourself into.

642
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,068
It ain't nothing ritzy.

643
00:31:01,103 --> 00:31:02,827
Just a good old
family Christmas.

644
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,793
It sounds wonderful.

645
00:31:04,827 --> 00:31:06,206
Okay. Well, come on, Pop,

646
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:08,586
we got to get to a phone
and tell the others.

647
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,724
You go ahead, son,
I'll catch up with you.

648
00:31:12,931 --> 00:31:14,896
Looks to me like you
just got railroaded.

649
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:17,517
- Are you sure about this?
- Are you kidding me?

650
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:18,965
I've been wondering how on earth

651
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,896
I was ever gonna manage
saying goodbye to you.

652
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:22,689
It's gonna be
a whole lot easier now

653
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:25,172
knowing there's a hello
just a few weeks away.

654
00:31:25,206 --> 00:31:27,137
I can't imagine anything better

655
00:31:27,172 --> 00:31:29,206
than spending Christmas
in Canaan,

656
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:30,310
with you.

657
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:46,000
Bandit, either push, pull,
or get out of the way,

658
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,551
preferably the latter.

659
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:48,689
Here, I'll put him out.

660
00:31:48,724 --> 00:31:50,620
Come on, Bandit.

661
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:51,724
Come on, boy.

662
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:57,068
Is that the nicest tree
you could find?

663
00:31:57,103 --> 00:31:59,206
What's wrong with it?
It's green.

664
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:00,862
It's got branches in all
directions

665
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:02,241
and there ain't
no squirrel nests.

666
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:04,482
Seems a little thin
on that side.

667
00:32:04,517 --> 00:32:06,448
Rodney, what if we turn it
the other way?

668
00:32:06,482 --> 00:32:09,206
Maybe it's got a better side.

669
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:11,448
Did you clean all the junk
out of the guestroom?

670
00:32:11,482 --> 00:32:12,896
What, all those seed catalogs?

671
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,448
I thought
she was a country girl.

672
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:15,862
Make her feel right at home.

673
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:17,241
This country girl

674
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:19,034
might just be
your father's new beau,

675
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:20,493
and I'll be switched
if I'm gonna let her think

676
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:22,620
a bunch of hayseeds live here.

677
00:32:22,655 --> 00:32:24,034
Now, go on.

678
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:27,965
Huh?

679
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,413
I'd say this looks pretty good.

680
00:32:37,448 --> 00:32:38,793
It looks really good.

681
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:40,689
Good enough for country folk.

682
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:42,379
Now we just need the angel.

683
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:43,586
I'll get it.

684
00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:07,655
You think she'd mind?

685
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,862
Me inviting a friend here
for Christmas?

686
00:33:12,793 --> 00:33:15,344
I imagine she'd be happy.

687
00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:18,965
She'd never have wanted you
to stay alone forever.

688
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,655
What better time than Christmas?

689
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,448
She always did love Christmas.

690
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:29,655
And she always loved this angel.

691
00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:32,551
Then let's put her up on
her angel's perch,

692
00:33:32,586 --> 00:33:35,793
so she can watch over us,
just like always.

693
00:33:37,655 --> 00:33:39,793
Come on. The boys are waiting.

694
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,482
Okay. Who wants the honors? DJ?

695
00:33:46,517 --> 00:33:48,000
No, my hands got pitch on 'em.

696
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:49,827
- You'll have to.
- Bobber?

697
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,137
Can't reach that far.

698
00:33:51,172 --> 00:33:53,586
Why don't you do it this year?

699
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,517
I suppose I could, I guess.

700
00:33:56,655 --> 00:33:58,103
All righty.

701
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:09,551
There. Perfect.

702
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:19,896
Her plane lands
in a couple hours.

703
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:21,379
Best get movin'.

704
00:34:21,413 --> 00:34:22,896
Hey, you sure you don't
wanna borrow

705
00:34:22,931 --> 00:34:24,758
some of my cologne? It's musk.

706
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:27,517
I'll do just fine without it,
thank you very much.

707
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:28,931
Somebody's a little prickly.

708
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:30,241
I wonder what that's about.

709
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:32,275
I wouldn't have
the faintest idea.

710
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,758
You kids are gonna end up
embarrassin' me yet.

711
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:37,034
Well, we'll certainly give it
our best shot.

712
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:39,586
Drive safe.

713
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,758
Will do.

714
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:00,896
Poor girl.

715
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:02,620
I hope she knows
what she's in for.

716
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,241
They're here.

717
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:39,793
They just drove up.

718
00:35:41,482 --> 00:35:43,103
Would you quit fussing?

719
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:45,448
You look sufficiently glamorous.

720
00:35:45,482 --> 00:35:47,620
Why is it that I feel
like a mother meeting

721
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:49,793
my son's prom date
for the first time?

722
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:51,862
Well, I'm not quite sure,

723
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:54,620
but if you're thinking
about having the birds

724
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,620
and the bees talk with him,

725
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,689
I think that duck's
pretty well flown.

726
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:01,896
What's taking them so long?

727
00:36:01,931 --> 00:36:03,206
Well, he's getting her things.

728
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:05,655
Women come with a lot
of accessories.

729
00:36:05,689 --> 00:36:06,862
They do.

730
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:10,689
Would you look
at the three of you?

731
00:36:10,724 --> 00:36:13,068
You're all lined up like
it's a firing squad.

732
00:36:14,448 --> 00:36:16,241
Here we are, guys and gal.

733
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:18,206
Please welcome Dr. Adair.

734
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:19,344
Hello.

735
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:20,965
I'm glad you made it.

736
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,241
Me too.

737
00:36:23,758 --> 00:36:25,827
This is my oldest son, DJ.

738
00:36:25,862 --> 00:36:27,068
Ma'am, uh, doctor?

739
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:28,448
It's Briony.

740
00:36:28,482 --> 00:36:30,344
Briony, ma'am.

741
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:31,896
And this is Rodney Freeman,

742
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:34,034
Canaan's most famous author.

743
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:37,448
Well, Canaan's only author,
best I can tell.

744
00:36:37,482 --> 00:36:38,896
I loved your book.

745
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:41,620
It makes coming here
almost like coming home.

746
00:36:41,655 --> 00:36:43,689
Oh, thank you.

747
00:36:43,724 --> 00:36:45,482
And this is Sarah.
Sissy, I call her,

748
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:47,241
which I'm sure she hates.

749
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:50,724
Sarah, I'm so glad
to finally meet you.

750
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,034
I hope you brought an appetite.

751
00:36:55,068 --> 00:36:56,586
Dinner's about ready.

752
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,551
I bet you'd love some help.
Just point me

753
00:36:58,586 --> 00:37:00,068
towards the kitchen
and turn me loose.

754
00:37:00,103 --> 00:37:01,896
No.

755
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:05,206
I mean, you're a guest.

756
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:06,724
I can manage.

757
00:37:08,482 --> 00:37:10,206
Well, let me help you
get settled in.

758
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:11,758
Come on, I'll grab
your things here.

759
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:13,862
Just follow me through here.

760
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:15,551
You have a lovely home.

761
00:37:20,896 --> 00:37:23,206
And what's your new book about?

762
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,724
Short stories mostly,
about growin' up,

763
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:27,068
things my grandmother taught me.

764
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:28,620
Oh, you would've loved her.

765
00:37:28,655 --> 00:37:30,724
- That woman was fearless.
- Oh, she had to be.

766
00:37:30,758 --> 00:37:32,758
You know,
it wasn't easy back then.

767
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:35,586
Back then? When did it get
so easy all of a sudden?

768
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,206
I must have missed that part.

769
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:40,551
Okay. Now it's Sarah's turn.

770
00:37:41,482 --> 00:37:44,137
I wanna hear all about you.

771
00:37:44,172 --> 00:37:46,310
- What about me?
- Anything.

772
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:49,379
Hopes, dreams, any special
fellas lurking out there

773
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:51,931
that we should know about?

774
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:54,103
Not much time for that
when you're busy riding herd

775
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:55,724
on this bunch.

776
00:37:55,758 --> 00:37:57,758
Then, how about your plans?

777
00:37:57,793 --> 00:37:59,689
Not much to tell.

778
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:01,689
Ever thought about college?

779
00:38:01,724 --> 00:38:03,655
As bright as your dad
says you are?

780
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:04,965
Yeah, Sissy.

781
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,689
What about college?

782
00:38:06,724 --> 00:38:08,793
Sarah, go to college? What for?

783
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:11,275
For your information,
I recently applied

784
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,655
at the University of Texas
at Austin.

785
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:15,965
Daniel, why didn't you tell me?

786
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,862
That's wonderful.

787
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,137
That's the first
I've heard of it myself.

788
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,862
I was wondering
when one of us was

789
00:38:21,896 --> 00:38:23,620
finally gonna make a run for it,

790
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:24,872
especially now
that there's somebody here

791
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:26,379
to keep track of you.

792
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:42,000
Hey. You got 'em all tucked in?

793
00:38:42,034 --> 00:38:43,310
Mmm-hmm.

794
00:38:43,344 --> 00:38:45,172
Three in beds and Rodney
on the couch.

795
00:38:47,344 --> 00:38:50,275
Listen, Daddy.

796
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:53,310
What I said about going
to college,

797
00:38:53,344 --> 00:38:56,310
I just filled out
the application, that's all.

798
00:38:56,344 --> 00:38:58,793
I probably won't even get
accepted,

799
00:38:58,827 --> 00:39:01,896
and even if I do,

800
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:03,689
I don't have to go.

801
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:05,551
I've been meaning to tell you.

802
00:39:05,586 --> 00:39:10,275
It's just when she asked,
I blurted it out.

803
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,068
Well, she has a gift for that,

804
00:39:12,103 --> 00:39:15,275
making folks say
what they're feelin'.

805
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,068
It's obvious the boys like her.

806
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:19,517
- Yeah.
- And you?

807
00:39:19,551 --> 00:39:21,862
I just met her.

808
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:23,896
I don't know her hardly at all.

809
00:39:25,586 --> 00:39:27,275
She certainly feels at home.

810
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,413
But you like her, right?

811
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:31,931
I like that you like her.

812
00:39:46,655 --> 00:39:47,551
Oh, I haven't had
one of these since last year.

813
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:49,068
Hey, look, I got one, too.

814
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:50,862
Just the color I wanted.

815
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:52,379
DJ, hand me that package,

816
00:39:52,413 --> 00:39:54,068
the only one left under
the tree, there.

817
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,931
Thank you.

818
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:02,517
Now, see, we've got a little
family tradition around here.

819
00:40:02,551 --> 00:40:04,827
Kids know all about this.

820
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:07,103
It started one
particular Christmas,

821
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:08,448
my daddy started it,

822
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:10,931
been a pretty rough year.

823
00:40:10,965 --> 00:40:12,931
We weren't expecting much,

824
00:40:12,965 --> 00:40:14,758
but come Christmas morning,

825
00:40:14,793 --> 00:40:16,448
here were all these gifts,

826
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:19,103
wrapped and under the tree,
just like always.

827
00:40:19,137 --> 00:40:20,724
Well, my mama, when she seen it,

828
00:40:20,758 --> 00:40:22,379
boy, she lit into my dad, said,

829
00:40:22,413 --> 00:40:25,344
"Where'd you get the money
for all that?"

830
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:27,517
And daddy just smiled
and looked at her,

831
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:29,896
and said, "Don't you
know nothing, woman?"

832
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:31,103
Even if you're flat broke,

833
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,137
"you can still have
some Christmas."

834
00:40:34,172 --> 00:40:37,103
See, to him, "some Christmas"
meant giving all the gifts

835
00:40:37,137 --> 00:40:38,517
you really wanted to give,

836
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:40,896
when only your heart
could afford it.

837
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:46,113
We did it that first year
Rodney came to live with us,

838
00:40:46,137 --> 00:40:48,241
- you remember that?
- I sure do.

839
00:40:48,275 --> 00:40:49,758
You gave me my first typewriter.

840
00:40:49,793 --> 00:40:51,103
That's right.

841
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:54,172
So, this year,

842
00:40:54,206 --> 00:40:56,241
with you being practically
family and all,

843
00:40:56,275 --> 00:40:59,103
I thought you deserved
some Christmas, too.

844
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:16,103
It's a little house.

845
00:41:16,137 --> 00:41:18,000
It's a country house.

846
00:41:18,034 --> 00:41:20,079
You're always talking about
how you're a country girl,

847
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,620
so I just thought,
maybe someday,

848
00:41:22,655 --> 00:41:24,931
you might like a little
country place of your own.

849
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:27,310
Thank you.

850
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:29,724
I love it. I really do.

851
00:41:29,758 --> 00:41:31,103
It's so sweet.

852
00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:38,517
Of course, until then,
you're plenty welcome

853
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:40,103
to stay right here with us.

854
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:45,689
I brought along a little
Christmas of my own.

855
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:53,000
First, the guys.

856
00:42:03,379 --> 00:42:04,827
A sweater.

857
00:42:04,862 --> 00:42:08,379
Not just any sweater.

858
00:42:09,448 --> 00:42:12,000
It's cashmere.

859
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,517
Nothing wrong with sheep's wool.

860
00:42:15,551 --> 00:42:17,379
Oh, yeah.

861
00:42:19,275 --> 00:42:20,344
- Thanks, Briony. Thanks.

862
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:22,896
And Sarah, this is for you.

863
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,344
They're Laurel Burch.

864
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:36,241
I think she makes the most
beautiful things, don't you?

865
00:42:39,068 --> 00:42:40,724
Well, go ahead, Sissy.
Put them on.

866
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,241
I'll do it later.

867
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:43,758
No, do it now.

868
00:42:43,793 --> 00:42:45,758
I wanna see
what you look like in 'em.

869
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:54,724
Look how pretty you look.

870
00:42:54,758 --> 00:42:57,379
You could be on the runway.

871
00:42:57,413 --> 00:43:00,034
Yeah, along with all
the other crop dusters.

872
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:01,896
Now, come on, be nice, DJ.

873
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:04,793
Sorry.

874
00:43:04,827 --> 00:43:08,310
Thank you, Dr. Adair.
You shouldn't have.

875
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:10,931
All of us girls
need some pretty things.

876
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:16,586
Now, Daniel, your turn.

877
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,620
Oh, Briony, you didn't
need to do all this.

878
00:43:20,655 --> 00:43:23,931
You better see if you like it
before you start thanking me.

879
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,344
It's a "real" tie.

880
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:37,862
Woo.

881
00:43:37,896 --> 00:43:39,758
Italian silk no less.

882
00:43:39,793 --> 00:43:41,620
I bet you didn't think
I'd notice.

883
00:43:43,965 --> 00:43:45,275
I love it.

884
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,655
Thank you.

885
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:50,275
I guess no more getting
thrown out of ritzy places.

886
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,758
That'll come in handy around
here, that's for sure.

887
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:55,448
And...

888
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:01,448
I brought something
for the house.

889
00:44:01,482 --> 00:44:03,931
A kind of a thank-you

890
00:44:03,965 --> 00:44:06,965
to all of you
for inviting me to Christmas.

891
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,448
Here.

892
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:10,655
You didn't have to do that.

893
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,206
One of you guys wanna open it?

894
00:44:12,241 --> 00:44:13,620
- Go on.
- Uh-uh.

895
00:44:21,551 --> 00:44:23,137
What is it?

896
00:44:23,172 --> 00:44:24,758
A friend brought it back
from Italy.

897
00:44:24,793 --> 00:44:26,448
I wanted you all to have it.

898
00:44:26,482 --> 00:44:28,310
Isn't it beautiful?

899
00:44:35,068 --> 00:44:37,551
Uh, yes, ma'am. Sure is.

900
00:44:37,586 --> 00:44:39,862
I thought it would look
so pretty on your tree.

901
00:44:39,896 --> 00:44:42,206
We already have an angel.

902
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:43,931
Oh, but not like this.

903
00:44:43,965 --> 00:44:45,344
This is a Botticelli.

904
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:47,379
Well, a copy, anyway.

905
00:44:47,413 --> 00:44:49,448
All the way from Florence.

906
00:44:51,413 --> 00:44:53,724
You know, it would look
real nice on the mantel.

907
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,482
- Uh, I vote we put it there.
- Mmm-hmm.

908
00:44:55,517 --> 00:44:57,000
It's a tree-topper.

909
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:58,758
You can't put a tree-topper
on the mantel.

910
00:44:58,793 --> 00:45:00,413
Here, let me do it.

911
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:12,172
There.

912
00:45:12,206 --> 00:45:13,586
A little touch of renaissance.

913
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,103
Didn't you hear him?

914
00:45:17,137 --> 00:45:19,517
He said we already have
an angel.

915
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:21,217
And where do you get the nerve
to just waltz in here

916
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:23,379
and move things around
without asking?

917
00:45:23,413 --> 00:45:24,862
You had no right.

918
00:45:33,034 --> 00:45:35,517
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

919
00:45:36,586 --> 00:45:38,965
Why don't you just leave?

920
00:45:59,413 --> 00:46:02,068
It's been hard on all of them.

921
00:46:02,103 --> 00:46:04,827
I'm not blind to that, but...

922
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,862
I think it's been toughest
on her.

923
00:46:08,793 --> 00:46:11,241
I never meant to do anything
that would upset her.

924
00:46:11,275 --> 00:46:12,655
I know.

925
00:46:14,793 --> 00:46:17,241
This just all happened
pretty quick, you know.

926
00:46:18,724 --> 00:46:22,068
Christmas was when we lost
her mama.

927
00:46:22,103 --> 00:46:24,068
I think this just brought it
all back.

928
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,965
For you, too.

929
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,965
Thing is, maybe she knows
you're just not ready.

930
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,482
It's just her way of showing it,

931
00:46:34,517 --> 00:46:36,448
of getting your attention.

932
00:46:43,275 --> 00:46:44,344
It's odd,

933
00:46:47,482 --> 00:46:49,655
14 years I've lived with this,

934
00:46:50,655 --> 00:46:52,655
the sorrow of losing Betsy,

935
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,000
and I thought that...

936
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,275
I know what you thought.

937
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,896
Sometimes, we think
we've worked through a thing,

938
00:47:04,931 --> 00:47:07,482
just by having lived with it
so long,

939
00:47:07,517 --> 00:47:11,000
but oftentimes,
it's something we set aside,

940
00:47:11,034 --> 00:47:13,068
and never really faced at all,

941
00:47:13,103 --> 00:47:15,931
just got on with life.

942
00:47:18,758 --> 00:47:20,010
Daniel, you've done
a remarkable thing

943
00:47:20,034 --> 00:47:21,206
for your kids.

944
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,517
You've given them a stable home,

945
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,310
and I know that wasn't easy.

946
00:47:29,862 --> 00:47:32,310
You took on Rodney
when he needed a family,

947
00:47:33,758 --> 00:47:35,689
and maybe you let that focus
distract you

948
00:47:35,724 --> 00:47:37,206
from your own grief.

949
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:41,931
I don't know.

950
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,206
Maybe.

951
00:47:48,206 --> 00:47:49,896
And now they're grown.

952
00:47:52,551 --> 00:47:54,068
I think it's your turn.

953
00:47:55,448 --> 00:47:57,586
Your turn to face that grief,

954
00:47:58,517 --> 00:48:00,000
to work on you,

955
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:04,379
in your own time,
in your own way,

956
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,448
just you.

957
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:09,137
I'm sorry.

958
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:28,620
You sure you don't want me
to drive you?

959
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,793
My daddy always taught me
a fella should

960
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:33,586
leave the dance
with the same girl he brought.

961
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,931
DJ offered. It's fine.

962
00:48:35,965 --> 00:48:38,758
You know, all I'm asking for

963
00:48:38,793 --> 00:48:40,241
is just a little more time.

964
00:48:41,482 --> 00:48:44,241
We all have things
we can't change.

965
00:48:44,275 --> 00:48:46,251
I only wish you could have looked
a little deeper into your heart

966
00:48:46,275 --> 00:48:50,034
before you thought
to invite me in, that's all.

967
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:57,448
Goodbye, Daniel.

968
00:49:40,068 --> 00:49:44,862
- Box over there.

969
00:49:44,896 --> 00:49:46,275
Yeah, that's right.

970
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,275
What's old man Shoup up to now?

971
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,689
Come on, let's go find out.

972
00:49:50,724 --> 00:49:52,344
It's too much trouble.

973
00:49:52,379 --> 00:49:54,241
You go.

974
00:49:54,275 --> 00:49:55,310
You sure?

975
00:49:55,344 --> 00:49:56,482
Yeah.

976
00:49:58,965 --> 00:50:00,517
Fertilizer out back
and pesticides

977
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:02,724
around the corner,
right next to the ones

978
00:50:02,758 --> 00:50:04,586
- against the wall.
- Hey, Mr. Shoup.

979
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,793
Rodney.

980
00:50:06,827 --> 00:50:09,275
Rodney Freeman.
You're just in time.

981
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,482
- Just in time for what?
- For a tour.

982
00:50:11,517 --> 00:50:14,344
You're looking at the newest
authorized distributor

983
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:16,862
of the Agro Harvest line
of professional farm products.

984
00:50:16,896 --> 00:50:19,310
It seems like an awful
lot of inventory.

985
00:50:19,344 --> 00:50:21,689
Well, it is,
but you know what they say,

986
00:50:21,724 --> 00:50:24,034
if you can't give it to them
when they need it,

987
00:50:24,068 --> 00:50:26,172
they'll find it someplace else.

988
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:28,137
Now, for the first time,
the farmers can buy

989
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:31,827
all their supplies
right here in Canaan.

990
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,379
- Come on, let me show you.
- All right.

991
00:50:34,413 --> 00:50:37,620
We got stacks and stacks
of stuff out back,

992
00:50:37,655 --> 00:50:40,517
you will be surprised.

993
00:51:04,448 --> 00:51:06,620
<i>Hey, hey, Bobber, back
in the house now,</i>

994
00:51:06,655 --> 00:51:07,872
<i>come on. This don't concern you.</i>

995
00:51:07,896 --> 00:51:11,379
<i>Bobber, no.
You get back here, right now.</i>

996
00:51:23,586 --> 00:51:26,275
I should've listened to Pop
and stayed home that night.

997
00:51:30,724 --> 00:51:33,448
You know, back in California,

998
00:51:33,482 --> 00:51:36,344
I told him "some better"
was good enough.

999
00:51:36,379 --> 00:51:40,344
But I only told him that
because he felt so bad,

1000
00:51:41,586 --> 00:51:43,586
and everyone worked so hard.

1001
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,517
But it's not, Rodney.

1002
00:51:50,965 --> 00:51:53,517
"Some better" is not good
enough by half.

1003
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:56,862
Let's get out of here.

1004
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,586
Not too far over.

1005
00:53:12,862 --> 00:53:15,413
All right, when you...
when you sit here,

1006
00:53:17,724 --> 00:53:18,896
put your foot in the straps.

1007
00:53:18,931 --> 00:53:21,344
See?

1008
00:53:21,379 --> 00:53:22,896
And when you push down,

1009
00:53:24,689 --> 00:53:27,482
it raises the sandbag.

1010
00:53:27,517 --> 00:53:30,896
And you want more weight,
you can just put some sand in.

1011
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:35,068
Well, you wanna try it out?

1012
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:39,068
Those doctors already tried
everything in the book.

1013
00:53:39,103 --> 00:53:42,482
I don't know if a bunch
of pulleys and a bag of sand

1014
00:53:42,517 --> 00:53:43,724
is gonna make a difference.

1015
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:04,448
Now, last year,
this was all alfalfa,

1016
00:54:04,482 --> 00:54:07,137
but I've been speaking to
Ralph Clark down at the co-op,

1017
00:54:07,172 --> 00:54:10,034
and he says we might ought to
consider putting in soybeans,

1018
00:54:10,068 --> 00:54:12,413
maybe up to half.
Now, I told him I'd ask you.

1019
00:54:13,724 --> 00:54:15,103
We could do that.

1020
00:54:15,137 --> 00:54:17,551
But mind you,
down at Davis and Dunn,

1021
00:54:17,586 --> 00:54:19,724
putting in a hundred acres
or more of sorghum.

1022
00:54:21,137 --> 00:54:23,034
Davis and Dunn? You know,

1023
00:54:23,068 --> 00:54:25,379
that new company farm
south of town?

1024
00:54:25,413 --> 00:54:27,724
Maybe they know
something we don't.

1025
00:54:27,758 --> 00:54:30,275
Well, we ain't never
planted no sorghum before.

1026
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:33,586
Just cause we haven't,
doesn't mean we shouldn't.

1027
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,275
- Whatever you think.
Oh, no, Daddy,

1028
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,758
I ain't putting my head
in that noose

1029
00:54:37,793 --> 00:54:39,517
without some company.

1030
00:54:39,551 --> 00:54:41,275
Well, whatever we plant,

1031
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:45,724
it's either gonna freeze,
bake, get eaten by bugs,

1032
00:54:45,758 --> 00:54:48,103
or be worth nothing
by the time we bring it in,

1033
00:54:48,137 --> 00:54:51,103
so I say plant
whatever you wanna plant.

1034
00:54:51,137 --> 00:54:52,827
It ain't gonna matter
much anyway.

1035
00:54:56,586 --> 00:54:59,275
Now, ain't you just
Mr. Sunshine these days?

1036
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:16,689
Hey, where are you goin'?
Town's that way.

1037
00:55:16,724 --> 00:55:18,517
Well, why drive all the way
to Clarksboro

1038
00:55:18,551 --> 00:55:20,344
when we can order
from old man Shoup?

1039
00:55:30,206 --> 00:55:32,344
Well, Rodney was right.

1040
00:55:32,379 --> 00:55:34,344
Looks like opening day
at the county fair.

1041
00:55:34,379 --> 00:55:36,586
All he's missing
is the cotton candy.

1042
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,000
And the people.

1043
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:39,758
Yeah, that's what
I was afraid of.

1044
00:55:39,793 --> 00:55:41,172
What?

1045
00:55:41,206 --> 00:55:43,793
Well, farmers not buying
their stuff here.

1046
00:55:43,827 --> 00:55:45,344
We may have come a ways
in this town,

1047
00:55:45,379 --> 00:55:47,586
but we ain't come that far.

1048
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,172
Wait here.

1049
00:55:49,206 --> 00:55:51,758
I'm not useless, you know!

1050
00:55:51,793 --> 00:55:54,379
Whatever you say, Bobbles.

1051
00:55:54,413 --> 00:55:55,827
Here, Bandit, come on, boy!

1052
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,551
There you go.

1053
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:51,758
- Okay. Yeah.
- Hey, look at that.

1054
00:56:54,413 --> 00:56:55,689
Keep it up, Bobber.

1055
00:57:38,172 --> 00:57:40,068
How long has he been out there?

1056
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:41,413
Almost an hour.

1057
00:57:46,793 --> 00:57:49,482
I think it's about time
we all had a little talk.

1058
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:02,206
I've never seen him
like this before.

1059
00:58:02,241 --> 00:58:05,310
Ever since Christmas,
when Briony left,

1060
00:58:05,344 --> 00:58:08,551
it's like the joy just flew
right out of his life.

1061
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:11,482
Why doesn't he just call her
and tell her he's sorry?

1062
00:58:11,517 --> 00:58:14,068
Because he's too proud
to let her see him like this.

1063
00:58:14,103 --> 00:58:17,137
So, why'd he let her
leave if he loved her so much?

1064
00:58:17,172 --> 00:58:19,137
Maybe he decided
he just wasn't ready

1065
00:58:19,172 --> 00:58:20,620
for someone else in his life.

1066
00:58:20,655 --> 00:58:22,137
It's been 14 years.

1067
00:58:22,172 --> 00:58:24,965
How ready does he got to be?

1068
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,413
If only she hadn't
busted that angel.

1069
00:58:27,448 --> 00:58:30,103
- It wasn't the angel.
- It wasn't?

1070
00:58:30,137 --> 00:58:33,034
It wasn't the angel, or Mama,
or any of that other stuff.

1071
00:58:36,551 --> 00:58:37,896
He did it because of me.

1072
00:58:41,241 --> 00:58:42,862
Hey, Bobber! Change the channel

1073
00:58:42,896 --> 00:58:44,172
to <i>Happy Days,</i> will ya?

1074
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,620
You know that's only
for emergencies, right?

1075
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:19,103
What do you think this is?

1076
00:59:23,482 --> 00:59:25,275
You need to go where?

1077
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:28,413
California,
to talk to Dr. Adair.

1078
00:59:28,448 --> 00:59:30,137
She's the only one who can help.

1079
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:34,413
Does Mr. Burton know about this?

1080
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:35,862
He'd never let me.

1081
00:59:35,896 --> 00:59:38,379
Then how can you just up
and disappear?

1082
00:59:38,413 --> 00:59:40,793
I'll tell him I'm staying over
at a girlfriend's.

1083
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,862
Jeri-Lynn Drake's baby's sick
and I'm helpin' out.

1084
00:59:43,896 --> 00:59:46,206
I got enough for my ticket.

1085
00:59:46,241 --> 00:59:47,827
I've just never flown
anywhere before.

1086
00:59:48,965 --> 00:59:50,551
Don't even know where to start.

1087
00:59:51,724 --> 00:59:52,689
Can you help me?

1088
00:59:52,724 --> 00:59:54,655
Are you sure about this?

1089
00:59:56,931 --> 01:00:00,689
Well, I guess I do know
a little something

1090
01:00:00,724 --> 01:00:03,103
about getting out of Dodge.

1091
01:00:03,137 --> 01:00:04,896
Or whatever this place is.

1092
01:00:19,413 --> 01:00:21,275
That's a really good
improvement.

1093
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,758
I'd like to see another
20 degrees of rotation.

1094
01:00:23,793 --> 01:00:25,758
I think that's enough for today.

1095
01:00:25,793 --> 01:00:26,862
You worked really hard.

1096
01:00:26,896 --> 01:00:28,103
I'm really proud of you.

1097
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:34,896
Sarah.

1098
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:37,482
This is a surprise.

1099
01:00:37,517 --> 01:00:40,034
Sorry to barge in on you
like this,

1100
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:41,931
but I need to ask you a favor.

1101
01:00:41,965 --> 01:00:44,275
You want me to do what?

1102
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,724
We want you to come back
to Canaan.

1103
01:00:46,758 --> 01:00:48,758
He only let you go
because he thought having you

1104
01:00:48,793 --> 01:00:50,103
in his life would hurt me.

1105
01:00:51,413 --> 01:00:52,896
He didn't know what else to do.

1106
01:00:54,137 --> 01:00:55,310
Does he know you're here?

1107
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,275
And this was your idea, not his?

1108
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:03,103
The family is worried about him.

1109
01:01:03,137 --> 01:01:05,551
It's like all the joy
has just gone out of him.

1110
01:01:05,586 --> 01:01:09,517
He never smiles, never laughs.

1111
01:01:09,551 --> 01:01:12,896
If anyone can help him,
it's you.

1112
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:16,275
He still cares about you.

1113
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:18,379
I know he does.

1114
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:20,758
That doesn't give me
the right to show up

1115
01:01:20,793 --> 01:01:22,310
at his door uninvited.

1116
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:24,931
I'm inviting you.

1117
01:01:24,965 --> 01:01:26,310
We all are.

1118
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,689
But Daniel isn't,
and he's the only one who can.

1119
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:37,586
He's the only one who can open
his heart the way he wants to.

1120
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:40,103
The way he needs to.

1121
01:01:40,137 --> 01:01:43,103
If I show up in Canaan
before he's ready,

1122
01:01:43,137 --> 01:01:45,103
it won't solve anything.

1123
01:01:45,137 --> 01:01:48,310
Chances are it'll likely
make things worse.

1124
01:01:50,517 --> 01:01:51,689
I'm sorry.

1125
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,241
So you'll let me know
how he's doing?

1126
01:01:57,275 --> 01:01:59,000
I will.

1127
01:01:59,034 --> 01:02:00,724
Sarah, I know
this hasn't been easy,

1128
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:02,413
especially for you.

1129
01:02:02,448 --> 01:02:04,172
You've held this family
together so long,

1130
01:02:04,206 --> 01:02:05,689
and then suddenly,
your dad shows up

1131
01:02:05,724 --> 01:02:07,517
with another woman in his life,

1132
01:02:07,551 --> 01:02:10,172
but I want you to know
one thing.

1133
01:02:10,206 --> 01:02:12,034
I know how much you mean
to this family,

1134
01:02:13,206 --> 01:02:14,758
and no matter what happened,

1135
01:02:14,793 --> 01:02:17,586
I would never have done
anything to change that.

1136
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:21,068
Thank you, Dr. Adair.

1137
01:02:21,103 --> 01:02:24,793
Briony.

1138
01:02:32,034 --> 01:02:34,000
- Thank you.

1139
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:00,793
Thanks, Rodney.

1140
01:03:00,827 --> 01:03:02,068
All right, take care.

1141
01:03:07,689 --> 01:03:09,241
Where the heck you been, Sissy?

1142
01:03:09,275 --> 01:03:11,482
You know where. I told you.

1143
01:03:11,517 --> 01:03:12,862
I talked to Jeri-Lynn.

1144
01:03:18,689 --> 01:03:22,000
I went to California,
to talk to Briony.

1145
01:03:22,034 --> 01:03:23,724
And what exactly did you expect

1146
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,000
to get out of doing that?

1147
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:27,586
Give you two a second chance.

1148
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,000
It was the happiest
you've been since Mama died.

1149
01:03:30,034 --> 01:03:33,000
I'd never seen you like that,

1150
01:03:33,034 --> 01:03:36,068
and then it was like this
cloud came over all of us.

1151
01:03:37,448 --> 01:03:38,827
I know why you did it.

1152
01:03:40,103 --> 01:03:41,413
You did it to protect me.

1153
01:03:45,103 --> 01:03:46,965
We'll get by somehow,
we always do.

1154
01:03:49,448 --> 01:03:52,965
Sometimes, we get by
because we have to,

1155
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,827
but sometimes, "getting by"
is just settling.

1156
01:03:55,862 --> 01:03:57,310
For once in your life,

1157
01:03:57,344 --> 01:04:00,310
you deserve more
than just settling.

1158
01:04:00,344 --> 01:04:02,068
She probably
don't even care anymore.

1159
01:04:02,103 --> 01:04:03,689
She probably moved on.

1160
01:04:03,724 --> 01:04:05,206
You don't know that.

1161
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,517
She say anything
about seeing anybody?

1162
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:12,206
Didn't say, didn't ask.

1163
01:04:12,241 --> 01:04:14,413
Figured it was best
to leave that up to you.

1164
01:04:27,344 --> 01:04:28,551
Good night.

1165
01:04:34,931 --> 01:04:37,344
- Dr. Adair.
- Briony?

1166
01:04:37,379 --> 01:04:39,448
It's Daniel.

1167
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:41,586
Hi.

1168
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,551
I've been thinking about you.

1169
01:04:43,586 --> 01:04:45,206
I understand you had a visitor.

1170
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:46,655
I did.

1171
01:04:46,689 --> 01:04:48,379
<i>It was quite a surprise.</i>

1172
01:04:51,379 --> 01:04:53,241
She's worried about you.

1173
01:04:53,275 --> 01:04:55,310
Says you've been a little down?

1174
01:04:55,344 --> 01:04:57,000
That doesn't sound like you.

1175
01:04:57,034 --> 01:04:59,517
Ah, it's just a rough patch
I'm goin' through.

1176
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:01,379
I'll be fine.

1177
01:05:01,413 --> 01:05:03,068
<i>Daniel, there's one thing</i>

1178
01:05:03,103 --> 01:05:05,034
<i>I learned early on.</i>

1179
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,941
Sometimes, the best way
to lighten your own burden

1180
01:05:06,965 --> 01:05:09,586
is to take on someone else's.

1181
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:12,206
<i>Find someone who's worse
off than you,</i>

1182
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,586
<i>someone who needs you.</i>

1183
01:05:14,655 --> 01:05:17,103
Plant some other fields.

1184
01:05:17,137 --> 01:05:19,655
Water someone else's crops
for a while.

1185
01:05:20,896 --> 01:05:23,206
Sounds like good advice.

1186
01:05:23,241 --> 01:05:26,103
I'm gonna keep that in mind.

1187
01:05:26,137 --> 01:05:28,241
You're a good man, Daniel.

1188
01:05:28,275 --> 01:05:30,551
A lot of people care about you,

1189
01:05:30,586 --> 01:05:32,724
probably more than you realize.

1190
01:05:32,758 --> 01:05:34,413
Thank you.

1191
01:05:34,448 --> 01:05:36,379
That means a lot
coming from you.

1192
01:05:36,413 --> 01:05:38,068
It's true.

1193
01:05:38,103 --> 01:05:39,620
I know it firsthand.

1194
01:05:42,758 --> 01:05:45,586
Well, uh...

1195
01:05:48,517 --> 01:05:50,724
<i>I just wanted to check in
on you.</i>

1196
01:05:50,758 --> 01:05:52,068
I'm glad you did.

1197
01:05:52,103 --> 01:05:54,586
It's nice to hear your voice.

1198
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,113
Hey, if you're ever
in the neighborhood,

1199
01:05:56,137 --> 01:05:58,310
you be sure and stop in
and say hello, all right?

1200
01:06:01,896 --> 01:06:04,689
You too.

1201
01:06:04,724 --> 01:06:06,931
Okay.

1202
01:06:06,965 --> 01:06:09,137
Well, goodnight.

1203
01:06:09,172 --> 01:06:11,379
Night.

1204
01:06:48,517 --> 01:06:50,379
Water time.

1205
01:06:50,413 --> 01:06:51,862
What you got for us there,
Bobber?

1206
01:06:51,896 --> 01:06:53,551
- Water?
- Well, that's what I like to see.

1207
01:06:57,689 --> 01:07:00,413
Well, now, looks like you boys
had yourself quite a year.

1208
01:07:02,034 --> 01:07:03,517
You can thank DJ for that.

1209
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,413
He's the one who wanted
to plant the sorghum.

1210
01:07:05,448 --> 01:07:07,113
Well then, you're lucky
someone at your place

1211
01:07:07,137 --> 01:07:09,448
knows something about farming.

1212
01:07:09,482 --> 01:07:11,068
Whoa-ho-ho. Whoo-hoo!

1213
01:07:11,103 --> 01:07:13,172
Okay, come on, Pop,
let's celebrate.

1214
01:07:13,206 --> 01:07:15,379
Chili cheese fries,
and I'm buying.

1215
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:19,931
Who's that?

1216
01:07:19,965 --> 01:07:21,689
That's Delmer P. Davis,

1217
01:07:21,724 --> 01:07:23,862
owner of Davis and Dunn Farms.

1218
01:07:23,896 --> 01:07:26,241
The way he's goin', before long,

1219
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,068
he'll own half the county.

1220
01:07:28,103 --> 01:07:29,413
Hey, Dad, you coming?

1221
01:07:34,793 --> 01:07:36,965
I don't know how much longer
Shoup can hold on.

1222
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:40,448
Agro Harvest wants their money.

1223
01:07:40,482 --> 01:07:42,241
He told me that
he can barely afford

1224
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:44,448
to keep his lights on.

1225
01:07:44,482 --> 01:07:48,034
And if he does start selling,
his markup is next to nothing.

1226
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:49,758
I can't believe people
would rather drive

1227
01:07:49,793 --> 01:07:52,551
a half hour away
and pay a third again more.

1228
01:07:52,586 --> 01:07:54,103
It just doesn't make sense.

1229
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:55,413
Well, it doesn't have to.

1230
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:57,413
That's the economics
of prejudice.

1231
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,620
You tellin' me after all
this town's been through,

1232
01:07:59,655 --> 01:08:01,355
there are still folks here
that'd rather see

1233
01:08:01,379 --> 01:08:02,827
a hardworking fellow
like Shoup fail

1234
01:08:02,862 --> 01:08:05,517
and fall flat
than see him succeed?

1235
01:08:05,551 --> 01:08:08,241
What rock you been hiding
under, Pa?

1236
01:08:08,275 --> 01:08:09,907
You think just
'cause it don't matter to us,

1237
01:08:09,931 --> 01:08:12,137
it shouldn't matter to them?

1238
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:14,586
Well, I got news for you,
not everyone's like you.

1239
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:16,103
It'd be nice if they were,

1240
01:08:16,137 --> 01:08:18,448
but the simple fact
is that they're not,

1241
01:08:18,482 --> 01:08:20,655
not by a long shot.

1242
01:08:20,689 --> 01:08:23,172
To see a man fail just
'cause he's black,

1243
01:08:23,206 --> 01:08:24,827
it's just not right.

1244
01:08:42,655 --> 01:08:44,310
Can I help you, Mr. Burton?

1245
01:08:44,344 --> 01:08:46,000
Yes, sir.

1246
01:08:46,034 --> 01:08:47,655
I was wondering
if you was hiring.

1247
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,620
Hiring for what?

1248
01:08:50,655 --> 01:08:53,000
Store clerk.

1249
01:08:53,034 --> 01:08:55,896
- What's so funny?

1250
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:58,413
Tell me, you see anyone here
needin' a clerk?

1251
01:08:58,448 --> 01:09:00,000
Well, you will.

1252
01:09:00,034 --> 01:09:01,965
Sometimes, all you need to do
to bring folks in

1253
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,137
is to show 'em a familiar face.

1254
01:09:04,172 --> 01:09:05,965
You mean a familiar white face?

1255
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,034
I just mean a familiar
farmer's face.

1256
01:09:09,068 --> 01:09:11,206
Christmas time coming up
real soon.

1257
01:09:11,241 --> 01:09:13,413
You're bound to be needing
some more help.

1258
01:09:14,862 --> 01:09:18,068
Well, I can't pay you nothin',
not at first.

1259
01:09:18,103 --> 01:09:19,517
That's okay.

1260
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:21,655
I'll just take it out in trade.

1261
01:09:21,689 --> 01:09:23,862
But why?
Why you wanna work here?

1262
01:09:23,896 --> 01:09:25,482
I got my reasons.

1263
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:26,724
Let's just leave it at that.

1264
01:09:28,655 --> 01:09:30,655
Okay, you can start tomorrow.

1265
01:09:30,689 --> 01:09:33,517
I could start tomorrow,
but I'm ready to start today.

1266
01:09:33,551 --> 01:09:34,517
Today?

1267
01:09:34,551 --> 01:09:36,551
Yeah, today.

1268
01:09:39,517 --> 01:09:41,689
All right.

1269
01:09:41,724 --> 01:09:44,517
What do we do first?

1270
01:09:44,551 --> 01:09:48,896
What we do first
is we sweep the porch.

1271
01:09:50,068 --> 01:09:52,896
Yes, sir, boss.

1272
01:09:52,931 --> 01:09:54,655

1297
01:12:14,482 --> 01:12:17,827
One customer all day,
and that was a Ding Dong.

1298
01:12:19,344 --> 01:12:21,344
Can't make a livin'
just sellin' Ding Dongs.

1299
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:23,448
You just got to be patient.

1300
01:12:23,482 --> 01:12:25,379
You know, I saw that fella
from Davis and Dunn

1301
01:12:25,413 --> 01:12:27,137
drive by yesterday.

1302
01:12:27,172 --> 01:12:28,793
He slowed down
and took a good look.

1303
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:30,206
He's been doing that for weeks.

1304
01:12:30,241 --> 01:12:31,724
He ain't stopped once.

1305
01:12:31,758 --> 01:12:34,793
Yeah? Just got to give him
time, that's all.

1306
01:12:34,827 --> 01:12:36,448
Time's the one thing
in short supply.

1307
01:12:36,482 --> 01:12:38,862
Everything else I got.

1308
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,482
Tomorrow will be a better day.

1309
01:12:40,517 --> 01:12:42,551
Listen, Daniel,

1310
01:12:42,586 --> 01:12:45,034
you've wasted enough
of your time here already.

1311
01:12:45,068 --> 01:12:46,793
Let's quit foolin' ourselves.

1312
01:12:46,827 --> 01:12:49,344
Just take our losses
and move on.

1313
01:12:49,379 --> 01:12:52,137
Whatever I owe you,
I'll find a way to pay it.

1314
01:12:52,172 --> 01:12:54,482
It might take me a while,
but I'm good for it.

1315
01:12:55,379 --> 01:12:56,724
I'm not worried about it.

1316
01:13:00,379 --> 01:13:02,448
You know something,

1317
01:13:02,482 --> 01:13:05,068
it just feels good to do
something for somebody else.

1318
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:08,896
Tomorrow's gonna be
a better day.

1319
01:13:45,862 --> 01:13:47,896
Mr. Davis?

1320
01:13:47,931 --> 01:13:49,172
That's right.

1321
01:13:49,206 --> 01:13:51,241
My name's Daniel Burton.

1322
01:13:51,275 --> 01:13:53,172
I reckon we need to talk
about our town.

1323
01:13:55,034 --> 01:13:57,758
Now, don't get me wrong.

1324
01:13:57,793 --> 01:13:59,068
I've got nothing against buying

1325
01:13:59,103 --> 01:14:02,000
from this particular gentleman.

1326
01:14:02,034 --> 01:14:04,103
It's just that we require
a certain quality

1327
01:14:04,137 --> 01:14:05,655
in what we buy.

1328
01:14:05,689 --> 01:14:07,551
Well, you consider
Agro Harvest product

1329
01:14:07,586 --> 01:14:09,275
good quality, don't you?

1330
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:11,068
I suppose.

1331
01:14:11,103 --> 01:14:12,344
- Good as any. Well then,

1332
01:14:12,379 --> 01:14:14,241
you'd be getting
what you're used to.

1333
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,758
But, you see, we buy in bulk.

1334
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:22,793
That's good,
'cause we sell in bulk.

1335
01:14:22,827 --> 01:14:25,586
As a matter of fact,
any price you can get,

1336
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:28,758
we can match, probably beat.

1337
01:14:28,793 --> 01:14:30,965
And by the time you figure
in the cost of haulin' it

1338
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,827
all the way out to here,

1339
01:14:32,862 --> 01:14:35,000
it's bound to be cheaper
for you.

1340
01:14:35,034 --> 01:14:36,655
That's another thing.

1341
01:14:36,689 --> 01:14:39,896
You see, the fella we buy from
down in Clarksboro

1342
01:14:39,931 --> 01:14:42,758
has been at it 20 years or more.

1343
01:14:42,793 --> 01:14:44,275
He's got a track record.

1344
01:14:45,862 --> 01:14:48,413
This Shoup fella?

1345
01:14:48,448 --> 01:14:49,941
Well, Shoup's family
has owned the store

1346
01:14:49,965 --> 01:14:51,620
since the early '30s.

1347
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:53,172
He's second generation.

1348
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:57,965
All right, I'll level with you.

1349
01:14:59,448 --> 01:15:01,862
It just doesn't seem right
buying from him.

1350
01:15:03,034 --> 01:15:04,551
It's nothing personal.

1351
01:15:04,586 --> 01:15:06,724
It's just not my kind of place.

1352
01:15:08,689 --> 01:15:11,206
I guess I misjudged you.

1353
01:15:11,241 --> 01:15:13,413
Sorry for wastin' your time.

1354
01:15:13,448 --> 01:15:16,172
Now, hold on a second here.

1355
01:15:16,206 --> 01:15:19,137
I got a right to buy
where I feel comfortable.

1356
01:15:19,172 --> 01:15:21,827
That's my choice.

1357
01:15:21,862 --> 01:15:23,862
There's no law against that,
is there?

1358
01:15:23,896 --> 01:15:26,344
There's no law against it,

1359
01:15:26,379 --> 01:15:28,689
not an official one anyway.

1360
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:31,068
I'm gonna level with you,
Mr. Davis.

1361
01:15:31,103 --> 01:15:33,551
I'm just a strugglin' farmer.

1362
01:15:33,586 --> 01:15:36,413
I got an old truck,
an old tractor.

1363
01:15:37,586 --> 01:15:39,862
Some years, we do okay,

1364
01:15:39,896 --> 01:15:42,034
others, not so good.

1365
01:15:42,068 --> 01:15:44,517
But I can tell you one thing,

1366
01:15:44,551 --> 01:15:48,137
I'd be a whole lot worse off
if it wasn't for my neighbors,

1367
01:15:48,172 --> 01:15:49,758
if it wasn't for this town.

1368
01:15:49,793 --> 01:15:53,655
You see, if we get a chance
to help a neighbor,

1369
01:15:53,689 --> 01:15:55,655
but we just choose to stand by
and watch him fail

1370
01:15:55,689 --> 01:15:58,068
when we could have done
something about it,

1371
01:15:58,103 --> 01:15:59,758
then this town dies a little.

1372
01:16:02,448 --> 01:16:04,862
I'm just asking you to help
a neighbor,

1373
01:16:04,896 --> 01:16:06,896
that's all,

1374
01:16:06,931 --> 01:16:08,275
just one neighbor.

1375
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,241
Can I help you?

1376
01:16:37,172 --> 01:16:39,896
Who do I need to talk to
about placing a seed order?

1377
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:44,413
I could help you with that.

1378
01:16:44,448 --> 01:16:46,620
Right on over here.

1379
01:16:46,655 --> 01:16:48,034
We'll get you all fixed up.

1380
01:16:53,827 --> 01:16:56,068
Emmanuel Shoup.

1381
01:16:56,103 --> 01:16:57,448
Delmer Davis.

1382
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,103
So there you are.

1383
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:09,620
What ya doing?

1384
01:17:09,655 --> 01:17:11,310
Just out here thinking.

1385
01:17:11,344 --> 01:17:12,862
About?

1386
01:17:12,896 --> 01:17:14,689
Shoup.

1387
01:17:14,724 --> 01:17:17,000
He asked me if I wanted
to go in with him,

1388
01:17:17,034 --> 01:17:18,344
be his partner.

1389
01:17:18,379 --> 01:17:20,206
Do you wanna?

1390
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:22,551
I might.

1391
01:17:22,586 --> 01:17:25,206
Let DJ run things around here.

1392
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:28,172
He's been doing it
mostly by himself anyway.

1393
01:17:28,206 --> 01:17:30,758
I think that's a fine idea,

1394
01:17:30,793 --> 01:17:33,000
for you and for DJ.

1395
01:17:37,241 --> 01:17:38,724
I've been thinking, too.

1396
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:41,448
About?

1397
01:17:43,172 --> 01:17:46,551
I've been accepted by UT
starting next year,

1398
01:17:46,586 --> 01:17:48,620
even offered me a scholarship.

1399
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,827
What with working
and Rodney's offer

1400
01:17:51,862 --> 01:17:54,344
to loan me a little money
for tuition,

1401
01:17:54,379 --> 01:17:57,172
I think I can pay my way,

1402
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:58,413
if it's okay with you.

1403
01:17:58,448 --> 01:18:00,034
That's great.

1404
01:18:00,068 --> 01:18:02,724
I think you should go.

1405
01:18:02,758 --> 01:18:03,838
You know, your mama always said

1406
01:18:03,862 --> 01:18:06,586
you were gonna go to college.

1407
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,172
She'd be so happy.

1408
01:18:12,068 --> 01:18:13,355
Though it's gonna be
a little different

1409
01:18:13,379 --> 01:18:14,862
around here without you.

1410
01:18:18,896 --> 01:18:21,689
Maybe you could invite
Briony out for a visit.

1411
01:18:22,862 --> 01:18:24,758
Nah,

1412
01:18:24,793 --> 01:18:28,034
I'm sure she's gotten
on with her life by now.

1413
01:18:28,068 --> 01:18:30,034
I'd expect that.

1414
01:18:30,068 --> 01:18:32,172
You don't know that,

1415
01:18:32,206 --> 01:18:35,172
not for sure.

1416
01:18:44,896 --> 01:18:46,517
<i>Hi, this Briony.</i>

1417
01:18:46,551 --> 01:18:48,413
- Hey, Briony, it's...
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1418
01:18:48,448 --> 01:18:49,838
<i>I can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

1419
01:18:49,862 --> 01:18:51,379
<i>But if you leave me a message,</i>

1420
01:18:51,413 --> 01:18:53,448
<i>I'll be happy
to return your call.</i>

1421
01:18:53,482 --> 01:18:54,724
Briony. Hi, it's just...

1422
01:18:57,862 --> 01:18:59,379
Hey, Briony.

1423
01:18:59,413 --> 01:19:01,275
It's Daniel.

1424
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:03,482
Daniel Burton.

1425
01:19:03,517 --> 01:19:06,137
I just wanted to give you
a call and let you know

1426
01:19:06,172 --> 01:19:09,103
that you were right
about what you told me.

1427
01:19:09,137 --> 01:19:11,172
The sooner you start trying
to help somebody else,

1428
01:19:11,206 --> 01:19:13,689
the more you realize
that your own problems

1429
01:19:13,724 --> 01:19:16,896
don't really add up
to all that much.

1430
01:19:16,931 --> 01:19:19,068
I don't know how I ever lost
sight of that.

1431
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:23,103
Anyway, I also wanted to say

1432
01:19:23,137 --> 01:19:25,517
if you're ever anywhere
around Canaan,

1433
01:19:25,551 --> 01:19:28,000
I'd love it if you'd stop by,

1434
01:19:28,034 --> 01:19:30,965
or if you just wanna call
sometime and say hello,

1435
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,551
I'd like that, too.

1436
01:19:33,586 --> 01:19:35,517
I think about you.

1437
01:19:35,551 --> 01:19:38,275
I think about you a lot lately.

1438
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:39,827
I hope you're doing good.

1439
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:43,586
Well, anyhow,

1440
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:45,724
hope to hear from you.

1441
01:19:45,758 --> 01:19:46,793
And by the way...

1442
01:19:51,517 --> 01:19:53,000
Merry Christmas.

1443
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,379
You know, whoever invented
them daggum answering machines

1444
01:20:10,413 --> 01:20:11,482
ought to be shot.

1445
01:20:17,034 --> 01:20:18,689
Merry Christmas.

1446
01:20:18,724 --> 01:20:20,965
Merry Christmas to you.
Merry Christmas, son.

1447
01:20:22,344 --> 01:20:24,482
Thank you, folks.
Merry Christmas.

1448
01:20:24,517 --> 01:20:26,551
Merry Christmas now.

1449
01:20:26,586 --> 01:20:29,310
Merry Christmas.

1450
01:20:29,344 --> 01:20:31,448
Merry Christmas to you.

1451
01:20:31,482 --> 01:20:32,976
Hurry up and lock the door
before somebody else

1452
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,241
comes in and buys something.

1453
01:20:36,586 --> 01:20:38,896
Listen, Daniel,

1454
01:20:38,931 --> 01:20:40,310
I owe you a lot.

1455
01:20:40,344 --> 01:20:42,172
No more than I owe you.

1456
01:20:42,206 --> 01:20:45,310
Well, whoever deserves it more,

1457
01:20:45,344 --> 01:20:48,275
- thank you.
- You headed home?

1458
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:51,103
Yeah, I got a whole house
full of in-laws. You?

1459
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:53,137
I'm headed out
to the Freeman place.

1460
01:20:53,172 --> 01:20:55,310
Rodney says it's his turn
to have Christmas out there

1461
01:20:55,344 --> 01:20:57,758
this year, and I got
a feelin' him and Sarah

1462
01:20:57,793 --> 01:20:59,586
has probably got something
special cooking.

1463
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,206
Sounds real nice.

1464
01:21:01,241 --> 01:21:03,241
Yeah, I gotta enjoy having
everybody together,

1465
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,758
you know, with Sarah leaving
for college next year.

1466
01:21:06,793 --> 01:21:08,838
Once they leave the roost,
it's hard to get them back.

1467
01:21:08,862 --> 01:21:10,517
Then you'd best make
the most of it.

1468
01:21:10,551 --> 01:21:11,965
You got that right.

1469
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,310
Merry Christmas, partner.

1470
01:21:13,344 --> 01:21:15,206
Merry Christmas, my friend.

1471
01:21:15,241 --> 01:21:16,586
Merry Christmas.

1472
01:21:26,379 --> 01:21:28,379
- He's here.

1473
01:21:34,034 --> 01:21:35,862
Hey, everybody. Sorry I'm late.

1474
01:21:35,896 --> 01:21:37,896
- Hey. Hi.
- Evening.

1475
01:21:37,931 --> 01:21:39,482
I thought you'd never get here.

1476
01:21:39,517 --> 01:21:42,310
Me too. Old Shoup was so full
of good tidings,

1477
01:21:42,344 --> 01:21:43,758
I didn't think
he was gonna lock up

1478
01:21:43,793 --> 01:21:46,482
and let me come home.
How can I help you?

1479
01:21:46,517 --> 01:21:48,068
How about you
finish setting the table?

1480
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,517
I'm on it.

1481
01:21:54,344 --> 01:21:55,724
Sissy, I think you miscounted.

1482
01:21:55,758 --> 01:21:57,413
There's an extra plate here.

1483
01:21:57,448 --> 01:21:59,413
No, it's right.

1484
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:02,034
There's someone else joining us.

1485
01:22:02,068 --> 01:22:03,793
Oh, really? Somebody I know?

1486
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:06,793
I'd say there's a good chance.

1487
01:22:09,413 --> 01:22:11,068
Briony?

1488
01:22:11,103 --> 01:22:13,275
What are you doing here?

1489
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:16,137
You invited me,
don't you remember?

1490
01:22:16,172 --> 01:22:18,068
You said if I was ever
in the neighborhood,

1491
01:22:18,103 --> 01:22:20,620
I should stop and say hello.

1492
01:22:22,068 --> 01:22:24,206
So, here I am.

1493
01:22:24,241 --> 01:22:25,379
Hello.

1494
01:22:30,344 --> 01:22:32,413
Merry Christmas.

1495
01:22:45,896 --> 01:22:48,448
So, how long you plan
on staying?

1496
01:22:48,482 --> 01:22:50,379
I'm not sure.

1497
01:22:50,413 --> 01:22:52,448
There's a job opening
in Clarksboro.

1498
01:22:52,482 --> 01:22:55,448
They're looking
for a good orthopedist.

1499
01:22:55,482 --> 01:22:57,896
I've been thinking
I might apply for it.

1500
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,137
Are you sure about this?

1501
01:23:00,172 --> 01:23:02,517
About what?

1502
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:04,448
Moving to Canaan.

1503
01:23:04,482 --> 01:23:07,310
It's a long way
from the big city.

1504
01:23:07,344 --> 01:23:08,965
I've always been a country girl,

1505
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,931
you know that.

1506
01:23:10,965 --> 01:23:12,458
Besides, it'll give me
a chance to work

1507
01:23:12,482 --> 01:23:15,310
a little bit more with Bobber.

1508
01:23:15,344 --> 01:23:18,310
Well, he'll sure
appreciate that.

1509
01:23:20,344 --> 01:23:23,000
It's not a permanent position.

1510
01:23:23,034 --> 01:23:25,482
Only a year.

1511
01:23:25,517 --> 01:23:26,655
Then what?

1512
01:23:28,551 --> 01:23:30,482
I don't know.

1513
01:23:30,517 --> 01:23:32,000
We'll just have to wait and see.

1514
01:23:33,586 --> 01:23:36,448
I reckon a person
can learn a lot in a year,

1515
01:23:36,482 --> 01:23:38,655
Daniel Burton, don't you?

1516
01:23:39,793 --> 01:23:42,793
Yeah. I reckon he can.

1517
01:23:51,896 --> 01:23:54,448
Hey, you two, dinner's ready.

1518
01:23:54,482 --> 01:23:57,137
Well, let's go.

1519
01:23:57,172 --> 01:23:59,965
Oh, my, it's lovely.

1520
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,034
DJ, Bobber, we're ready.

1521
01:24:02,068 --> 01:24:03,493
Here, buddy, let me
get these for you.

1522
01:24:03,517 --> 01:24:05,172
No, it's okay.

1523
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:06,413
I'm fine.

1524
01:24:06,448 --> 01:24:08,482
You sure?

1525
01:24:37,241 --> 01:24:39,931
What's the matter, you never
seen anyone walk before?

1526
01:24:44,517 --> 01:24:46,206
Attaboy, Bobber.

1527
01:24:46,241 --> 01:24:47,551
I'm proud of you, buddy.

1528
01:24:50,275 --> 01:24:52,413
Let us bow our heads
and thank the Lord,

1529
01:24:52,448 --> 01:24:55,344
like my grandmother,
Miss Eunice, would've.

1530
01:24:58,413 --> 01:25:01,068
We thank You, Lord Jesus,

1531
01:25:01,103 --> 01:25:05,103
for us to share
this meal one to another,

1532
01:25:05,137 --> 01:25:07,586
and we ask You to bless
those folk who struggle,

1533
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:10,275
even now, as we enjoy
this plenty.

1534
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,448
And as we partake of this food,

1535
01:25:13,482 --> 01:25:16,413
help us grow,
not only in strength,

1536
01:25:16,448 --> 01:25:18,344
but in love,

1537
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:20,344
one to the other,

1538
01:25:20,379 --> 01:25:22,620
in a desire
to be more like Thee.

1539
01:25:22,655 --> 01:25:24,344
Amen.

1540
01:25:24,379 --> 01:25:25,620
- Amen.
- Amen.

1541
01:25:25,655 --> 01:25:27,931
- Amen. Amen.
- Well said, Rodney.

1542
01:25:27,965 --> 01:25:29,344
Your grandma
would be awful proud.

1543
01:25:29,379 --> 01:25:31,172
- Hey, who wants cornbread?
- Hey, uh, anyone

1544
01:25:31,206 --> 01:25:32,482
want some of these taters here?

1545
01:25:32,517 --> 01:25:33,758
Sure. As we gathered

1546
01:25:33,793 --> 01:25:35,827
around the table,

1547
01:25:35,862 --> 01:25:38,827
who could have imagined
how a gift for Bobber

1548
01:25:39,758 --> 01:25:42,068
would become for Daniel

1549
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:44,448
another gift entirely.

1550
01:25:44,482 --> 01:25:47,758
But in the words of Briony,

1551
01:25:47,793 --> 01:25:51,896
what could be better
than spending a Christmas,

1552
01:25:51,931 --> 01:25:53,000
any Christmas

1553
01:25:54,034 --> 01:25:56,620
in a place called Canaan?
