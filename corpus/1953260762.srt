1
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,137
After the destruction of Jerusalem
nearly six centuries...

2
00:00:41,202 --> 00:00:43,053
before the birth of Christ...

3
00:00:43,118 --> 00:00:45,927
the Jews were taken
into captivity in Babylon.

4
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:49,760
But 60 years later, Babylon's
territories were conquered...

5
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:55,509
by the Persian Army, and
engulfed in a new vast empire.

6
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:57,424
By edict of King Cyrus,

7
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:00,233
all captive peoples
were set free,

8
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:03,108
and allowed to return
to their own lands.

9
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:06,940
But not all the Jews
returned to Judea.

10
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:09,815
Many decided to remain
in the Persian empire,

11
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,605
the capital of which
was the magnificent city of Susa.

12
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,114
Stop! Stop!
Thief!

13
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,780
Come here, you!
Hold it!

14
00:03:01,845 --> 00:03:03,696
- Let me go!
- That's all!

15
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:09,444
That wretched man
will have his hand cut off.

16
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,360
It's the harsh law
of the Persians.

17
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:15,192
It's not the harshness, Ezra,
it's the absence of clemency.

18
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:18,066
We Jews should remember
when we write our own law...

19
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,857
People of Susa! Make way
for the counselor of your king!

20
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,521
Just look at him.

21
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,395
Ever since the kingdom of Saul,
every Jew has known...

22
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,269
as long as there's one Amalekite
on earth, we are in danger.

23
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:40,102
It's been so many years.
Will this feud never end?

24
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,976
Maybe, but I still refuse
to bow before him.

25
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,892
Come, Ezra,

26
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:48,724
we must try to do nothing which
can bring harm to our people.

27
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:51,533
Haman is just looking
for an excuse to strike us all.

28
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,366
Why can't we get through?
You stupid idiots!

29
00:03:55,431 --> 00:03:57,282
Bow your heads
before Haman,

30
00:03:57,348 --> 00:04:02,073
who brings gifts for the great
King of Persia and Media.

31
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:11,653
- How dare he?
- What is it, my lord?

32
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:17,402
Nothing.

33
00:04:28,963 --> 00:04:31,772
His riches have opened
too many doors at court.

34
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:33,688
Soon he may even win
the king's favor.

35
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:35,605
Well, you know the king.

36
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,479
- He may have his indulgences, but...
- Well then,

37
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,353
it might not be as hard as we
thought to rid ourselves,

38
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:44,227
of that impostor.

39
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:03,325
You make me so proud,
Hadassah!

40
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,199
You've a true gift for languages,
and you learn so quickly.

41
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:10,031
Well, I do have the best
teacher in Susa, cousin.

42
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:13,864
She's so generous and obedient.
That's because she has the blood,

43
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:17,696
of King Saul, from the tribe of
Benjamin, flowing in her veins.

44
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,612
- Thank you, Ezra.
- But heed my words...

45
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:22,486
don't let her marry a foreigner.

46
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:26,318
- Has someone asked for my hand?
- No one!

47
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:28,234
Haven't you some...

48
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:30,150
some chores to do?

49
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,259
Mordecai...

50
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,799
you shouldn't treat her like the
orphan you took in many years ago.

51
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,689
She's a woman now.
You have to accept that.

52
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:44,521
I know, I know.
But she is a special girl.

53
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:46,371
She deserves a man
who is worthy of her.

54
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:49,247
If it be the will
of the Lord.

55
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:52,122
Hadassah,

56
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:54,996
what is this about a man?

57
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:55,953
So...

58
00:05:56,977 --> 00:05:59,786
should someone
be asking for your hand?

59
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:01,702
Is it...
anyone in particular?

60
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,618
I don't know...

61
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:06,492
The man of my dreams,
perhaps?

62
00:06:06,557 --> 00:06:10,325
But I'll accept whomever
you choose for me.

63
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,157
You know me well, and you're a wise
man. I know you'll make,

64
00:06:14,222 --> 00:06:17,031
- the right decision.
- Today, with Haman,

65
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:19,905
I was neither wise nor prudent...

66
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:23,737
Hadassah,
Ezra is not wrong.

67
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:27,570
Living among the Persians so long,
we have become like them.

68
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:29,486
But we are still Jews.
We are different.

69
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:33,318
But you've taught me that what
matters is what's in a man's heart,

70
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:35,234
not his blood.

71
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:39,066
Your father might not
have taught you so.

72
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,791
No father is more dear
to me than you are.

73
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:46,666
Nehemia!
What are you doing?

74
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:54,331
The king's jewels,
booty from all over the kingdom.

75
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:58,163
But they are better off here
than in their original places.

76
00:06:58,228 --> 00:07:00,079
Like that gold basin.

77
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:01,995
It comes from
the Temple in Jerusalem.

78
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,828
The Jews used it to gather
the blood during the sacrifices.

79
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,744
- Have you washed?
- No.

80
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:11,576
Everything must be purified before
one of the most important banquets,

81
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:14,450
ever offered by the king.
Wash!

82
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:19,240
Tend to the wine.

83
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,072
And taste it before
offering it to the king.

84
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,821
- What if I die?
- You can...

85
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:32,653
but not the Great King Ahasuerus.
Come!

86
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,582
Parathael,
are you instructing him well?

87
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:00,372
Remember that at court, a false
move could cost him dearly.

88
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:02,289
Come with me,
Nehemia.

89
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,037
Here's the wine you requested,
my king.

90
00:08:21,515 --> 00:08:24,324
To the health
of our wise king.

91
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,198
May he live forever,

92
00:08:27,263 --> 00:08:30,072
by the grace of the god
Ahuramazda,

93
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:34,862
for the eternal joy
of his loyal subjects.

94
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:49,170
If you, my subject,
are so full of joy,

95
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:51,086
why do you look so sad?

96
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:55,876
Won't you reply?

97
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:57,792
My lord...

98
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:02,583
I was thinking
that this feast will soon end.

99
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:06,415
Your servant Haman is sad because
he cannot make it last longer.

100
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,247
You cannot,
but your king has this power.

101
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:19,818
I, Ahasuerus,
King of Persia and Media...

102
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,702
declare...

103
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:26,534
that every man here
assembled shall drink

104
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:31,324
without restraint,
each to his own desire.

105
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:36,115
You spoke well,
but answer this:

106
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,947
Which of the king's jewels
would you desire for yourself?

107
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,863
They're all equally magnificent,
Shetar.

108
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,779
I wouldn't know
which one to choose.

109
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:48,569
My king, this man finds none
of your jewels worthy of praise.

110
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:50,485
How brazen!

111
00:09:57,257 --> 00:10:01,024
Haman, you say
that the King of Kings...

112
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:04,856
doesn't own a jewel
splendid enough to...

113
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,730
reflect his glory?

114
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:09,646
My lord,

115
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,479
the king's most beautiful jewel
isn't among these.

116
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:17,311
Where is it, then?
Let it be brought!

117
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:22,101
A man's most precious jewels
are his wife's grace and honor.

118
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,017
There's no other
beauty in your empire...

119
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,891
that can rival that
of Queen Vashti.

120
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:35,449
Ishtar,
the goddess of love and war...

121
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:39,282
she must have her way,
and she is pleased when she sees...

122
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:43,114
the beautiful princess
and the valiant warrior...

123
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:45,988
fall in love.

124
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:54,611
But other gods conspire
against the match.

125
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:58,443
Ishtar, moved to pity,

126
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:03,233
begins to blow,
and blow, and blow...

127
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:08,024
until the offending gods
are swept away.

128
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:13,772
Love triumphs
and the enemies of love...

129
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:18,562
are turned into ugly pigs.

130
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:29,101
Why do I bother to bring artists
and dancers from faraway lands...

131
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,951
if my guests refuse
to show interest in them?

132
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:36,702
My queen, we are not used to plays
that ridicule our king's gods.

133
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:38,617
We are... confused.

134
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:40,533
I'm not one of those
foolish courtiers...

135
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:44,365
that prostrate themselves
in order to obtain favors.

136
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,282
I am the queen,

137
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:49,156
and I do as I please
in my chambers.

138
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:52,988
Harbona, the king's eunuch,
asks to be received.

139
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:55,862
Don't just stand there,
Harbona, speak.

140
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:57,778
The king requires
my lady's presence.

141
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,694
For what purpose?

142
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,568
He makes display
of his most treasured objects.

143
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,485
Am I such an object?

144
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,359
The most beautiful of all,
my queen!

145
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:11,191
It does not befit a lady,
much less a queen,

146
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:14,065
to be displayed before a man
quite drunk...

147
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,981
after too many days
of feasting.

148
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:20,771
The king wills it.
You are to wear the royal crown.

149
00:12:22,753 --> 00:12:25,562
Say to the king that I refuse.

150
00:12:27,543 --> 00:12:30,287
Queen Vashti...!

151
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:40,827
Queen Vashti wrongs the king
by refusing my command.

152
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:43,701
Not only the king,
but the officials,

153
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:45,617
and the whole people
in every province.

154
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:50,407
- A royal command must be obeyed.
- What does the law require?

155
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:55,197
If it pleased the king, let a royal
order go out that Vashti...

156
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:59,987
be sent away from palace life and
never return before the king again.

157
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:03,820
Let it be written among the laws
of the Persians and the Medes

158
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:06,694
so that it might not
be revoked.

159
00:13:07,717 --> 00:13:09,568
My king,
when word gets out,

160
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:12,442
all women will look upon
their husbands with contempt.

161
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:17,232
Let her royal position be given
to another who is better than she.

162
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,939
Very well, Memucan.

163
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:26,747
Scribe!

164
00:13:28,731 --> 00:13:32,498
Let it be written to every
province in its own script...

165
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:36,330
...and to every people
in its own language.

166
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:44,953
Let it be sent by swift couriers
to every province in the empire...

167
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:48,785
that I declare
by royal decree...

168
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,575
that the king no longer
recognizes Vashti as his queen,

169
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,449
due to her disobedience,

170
00:13:56,515 --> 00:14:01,240
as she dared oppose
an explicit order by the king.

171
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,791
Harbona,
go bring the queen to me.

172
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:37,582
- There is no queen, my lord.
- A decision made in haste.

173
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:40,456
It was the wine.
I revoke my command.

174
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:44,288
Bring Vashti.
I want her here.

175
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:47,162
I want to restore her crown.

176
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:51,952
It was a royal decree, my lord.
By law, it cannot be revoked.

177
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,827
And not even the king
can go against the law...

178
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:56,743
What is your advice?

179
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,239
If it pleases the king...

180
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:09,196
Speak, Haman.

181
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:13,988
Let beautiful young virgins
be sought out for the king.

182
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:16,862
And let the king appoint
commissioners in all the provinces...

183
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:20,629
to gather the virgins
to the harem in the citadel.

184
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:22,546
And let the girl
who pleases the king...

185
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:26,378
be queen in Vashti's place.

186
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:29,252
This suggestion...

187
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:34,043
pleases the king.
Let it be as Haman has proposed.

188
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:55,120
Search every house
in the town!

189
00:15:56,143 --> 00:15:57,994
What are they doing?
That's my house!

190
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:00,868
- Wait! Wait! Wait!
- Break it down.

191
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:05,658
Hurry up!
Search those houses over there!

192
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,407
- Come on, come on, hurry.
- Don't worry, Mother.

193
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:17,155
Hurry up!
Bring them all to the palace!

194
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:20,923
Hadassah!

195
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:23,797
Any resistance
will be punished!

196
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:26,671
You must obey
the king's order!

197
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:33,378
Look in that direction!
Move on to the next street!

198
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:40,084
- Hadassah?
- Mordecai?

199
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,958
Thank God you're here.
Quickly, quickly,

200
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:44,874
- you must hide!
- Why?

201
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:47,749
- They're taking girls...
- What for?

202
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:51,581
For the harem of the king!
Hurry! Hurry! Get in here!

203
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:55,413
Do you want to spend the rest
of your life in a harem? Get in!

204
00:16:56,436 --> 00:16:58,287
Be still!

205
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:04,994
Open the door!
In the name of King Ahasuerus!

206
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:07,868
I will send them away.

207
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:10,742
Come on, open up!

208
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:14,574
Yes, yes, yes...

209
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:17,383
Your daughter
must come with us.

210
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,259
Daughter?
I have no daughter.

211
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:22,175
Your neighbor says
there is a young girl here,

212
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,091
a very beautiful young girl.

213
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:27,924
My neighbor is old.
He doesn't see well.

214
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:29,840
You Jews,
you think you can outwit...

215
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:31,756
a chamberlain of
the Great King of Persia?

216
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:35,588
Perhaps it was
a servant girl he saw.

217
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:38,462
She just cooks for me,
she doesn't live here.

218
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:41,336
Look for yourself...

219
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:06,246
No daughter?
What is this?

220
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:09,120
- Sir, you were lying to me.
- It's not what it seems.

221
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:11,994
Keep searching
and bring her to me.

222
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:16,720
- Come on, up, up...
- Please...

223
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:19,594
- Leave me.
- Let's go. Hurry.

224
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:23,427
She's an orphan
and a kinswoman.

225
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:26,301
See here,
perhaps we can discuss...

226
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,217
...an arrangement.

227
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,049
Say goodbye
to your "kinsman. "

228
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:38,755
Goodbye,
my dear cousin.

229
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:41,630
May the God of our ancestors
reward you...

230
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:45,462
for all your kindnesses.

231
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:49,229
Tell no one
you're a Jew.

232
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,168
You cannot even
use your name.

233
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:56,000
Call yourself "Esther",
you know what it means.

234
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,916
Forget your name,

235
00:18:57,982 --> 00:19:00,791
but never forget
you're a Jew...

236
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:03,665
except in the silence
of your heart.

237
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:07,497
Be brave, my child.

238
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:57,316
This way. Quick, quick!

239
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:01,148
Come on!

240
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:37,490
Separate them! Find rooms for them
away from the others from Babylon!

241
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:41,322
Come, come. Enter, my beauties.
Don't be afraid.

242
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:50,903
Jews.

243
00:20:53,842 --> 00:20:56,651
I am Hegai,

244
00:20:56,716 --> 00:21:01,441
in whose charge you'll remain until
you move on to the second harem.

245
00:21:01,506 --> 00:21:04,315
Welcome to your new home.

246
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,124
Today, we shall begin
transforming you...

247
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:12,876
for your encounter with the great
king in the royal bedchamber.

248
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,707
Don't be upset. We'll begin the
prescribed treatments...

249
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:20,539
with oil of myrrh, and later
with perfumes...

250
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:22,455
- Little one, no need to cry.
... and cosmetics.

251
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,329
You will be taught
palace etiquette...

252
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:28,204
and how to conduct yourself
in the presence of the king.

253
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:31,078
So that,
when your turn comes,

254
00:21:31,143 --> 00:21:34,910
you could even become
a queen.

255
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:36,826
What is this commotion?!

256
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:40,658
- Make her be quiet!
- Lf only she could be with her sister,

257
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:42,574
who was also brought
to the palace...

258
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:45,448
- You know this girl?
- Not until now...

259
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:48,323
Then she is no concern
of yours.

260
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:53,113
But her distress
is my concern,

261
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,945
and easily remedied
by a man of authority here.

262
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:00,777
Men?

263
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:02,627
You won't find any men here.

264
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:05,503
I know a man's real strength,

265
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:07,420
and by your eyes, I see
more strength in you, Hegai,

266
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:10,294
than in an army of warriors.

267
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:16,999
Who...

268
00:22:18,023 --> 00:22:19,874
who are you?

269
00:22:20,897 --> 00:22:23,706
- I am Esther.
- Esther?

270
00:22:23,772 --> 00:22:25,623
A Babylonian name.

271
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:29,455
- Your people are from Babylon?
- No, I'm from Susa.

272
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,287
Well, Esther of Susa...

273
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:39,036
out, everyone out! To the second
wing, with the Babylonians!

274
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:44,119
This is the full tribute
of ebony?

275
00:23:44,184 --> 00:23:46,993
Six hundred talents, yes.
And next we have incense.

276
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,909
Not you, again!

277
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:50,825
I told you,
don't bother me today.

278
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,699
What happens in the harem
is of no concern to me,

279
00:23:53,764 --> 00:23:56,574
nor of any man,
save the king.

280
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:59,383
If you want a long life,
my friend, forget the girl...

281
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:04,174
I am charged by her family
to see if she is well.

282
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:08,006
Please.

283
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:11,838
What's this?

284
00:24:11,903 --> 00:24:13,754
Frankincense, sir.

285
00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:20,461
You call this incense?
This is second rate.

286
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:25,251
You know people in the court.

287
00:24:25,316 --> 00:24:29,083
You know the eunuchs.
You could ask them.

288
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:33,873
You made an error.

289
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,790
How?
What are you talking about?

290
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:37,706
Here.

291
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:43,454
- So I did.
- It's because you need an assistant.

292
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,328
Appoint me.
I am a scribe.

293
00:24:46,393 --> 00:24:50,160
I can read and speak Aramaic,
Babylonian, and Persian.

294
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:54,886
- I could be of great help to you...
- All because you know how to count?

295
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,762
That incense...

296
00:24:57,827 --> 00:25:01,594
- it isn't actually second rate...
- Enough.

297
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:05,426
My assistant...

298
00:25:05,491 --> 00:25:10,216
perhaps you will sit
within the palace gate.

299
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:15,007
You're a clever man,
Mordecai the Jew.

300
00:25:22,736 --> 00:25:25,545
The king
will tell you to rise.

301
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,461
Watch...

302
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:38,958
You will not bow with your head,
but with your heart.

303
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:45,665
You will walk lightly,
as if on water.

304
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:51,413
And when you do bow,
you will smile...

305
00:25:51,478 --> 00:25:54,222
but keep your eyes lowered.

306
00:25:57,162 --> 00:25:59,013
Silence!

307
00:26:01,952 --> 00:26:06,677
It is forbidden to look
the king in the eyes,

308
00:26:06,742 --> 00:26:11,468
save for the royal princes
and his closest advisors.

309
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:15,300
It is forbidden to rise
without the king's permission.

310
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:20,090
It is forbidden
to dress carelessly,

311
00:26:20,155 --> 00:26:22,006
and it is forbidden...

312
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:23,922
to scratch yourself.

313
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:28,713
Forget whatever you
have done up until now.

314
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:35,419
When it is your night
to go to the king,

315
00:26:35,484 --> 00:26:38,293
you may ask for anything
you want to take with you.

316
00:26:38,358 --> 00:26:43,083
I will ask for a necklace of
pearls that will reach to my feet.

317
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:45,957
I will have only a fan
of white feathers.

318
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:49,725
Perhaps the king
will never send me away!

319
00:26:51,707 --> 00:26:53,558
Maimuna,

320
00:26:53,623 --> 00:26:56,432
why has no girl ever
returned from the king?

321
00:26:56,497 --> 00:26:59,306
The first harem
is only for virgins.

322
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:02,180
And after our first night,
what then?

323
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,054
In the morning, Shaagaz
will take you to the second harem,

324
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,929
the eunuch in charge
of the concubines.

325
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,803
There you will remain,
unless the king delights in you

326
00:27:10,868 --> 00:27:13,677
and calls for you by name.

327
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:15,593
Maimuna?

328
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:17,509
My lady?

329
00:27:18,532 --> 00:27:20,383
What is it like?

330
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,299
I mean,

331
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:25,174
to make love to a man?

332
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:29,006
That depends on the man.

333
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:35,713
The murder of the governor of the
southlands is clearly an offense.

334
00:27:35,777 --> 00:27:39,544
Even the king's life
could be in danger.

335
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:42,418
The assassins must
be found and punished!

336
00:27:42,484 --> 00:27:45,293
Memucan's concern is justified.

337
00:27:45,358 --> 00:27:47,143
We must send someone there
immediately.

338
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,019
This is a very serious matter.

339
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:51,935
Perhaps you should go,
Carshena.

340
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,767
Everyone knows you've been coveting
the idea of a governorship...

341
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:57,683
in those rich lands.

342
00:27:57,748 --> 00:28:00,557
That is a lie!

343
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:08,222
Let me go!

344
00:28:10,203 --> 00:28:13,970
I bring a message to the great king
from the governor of the southlands.

345
00:28:14,035 --> 00:28:16,844
That's impossible.
The governor is dead.

346
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:19,718
Boy, don't you know no one comes
unsummoned before the king?

347
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:21,635
The penalty is death.

348
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,509
- It's the law.
- But I was summoned.

349
00:28:24,574 --> 00:28:26,425
By whom?

350
00:28:32,238 --> 00:28:35,047
He was supposed to be here,
my lord.

351
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,921
I don't see him,

352
00:28:37,987 --> 00:28:40,796
but I know his name.
It's...

353
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:45,586
it's... Carshena.

354
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,041
Carshena?

355
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:05,706
And where...
is he now?

356
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,411
I don't see him!

357
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:20,107
- Execute him!
- I'm innocent, my lord.

358
00:29:20,141 --> 00:29:21,992
- I don't want to die.
- Be brave.

359
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:23,908
Your death
shall not go unpunished.

360
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:30,605
If one of you sent for this man,
his blood is on your hands.

361
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:34,447
There will be an investigation
of this "Carshena".

362
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:41,153
Esther, what will you wear
when you go into the king?

363
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,964
You have seen to my every need,
Hegai. You decide.

364
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:46,838
But it is customary to request
something to take in with you.

365
00:29:46,903 --> 00:29:50,670
Well, in that case,
I'll rely on your wisdom.

366
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:53,544
I should bring whatever
you think I require.

367
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,831
It's for tonight.

368
00:31:17,854 --> 00:31:20,663
May the god, Ahuramazda,
be with you.

369
00:31:44,615 --> 00:31:45,507
Tell us your name.

370
00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:48,383
I'm called...
Esther.

371
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,299
Esther.

372
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:56,047
The name of the goddess Ishtar,
the goddess of love, yes?

373
00:31:56,112 --> 00:31:58,921
In the tongue of my people,
it has another meaning.

374
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:01,795
It means "hidden".

375
00:32:02,818 --> 00:32:05,628
So you hide behind a veil?

376
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:07,544
Are you that ugly?

377
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:13,292
Rise,
so I can see you.

378
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,095
Are you a...
Mede?

379
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:43,886
Are you lonian?
Assyrian?

380
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:51,550
My people are loyal subjects
of the King of Persia, my lord.

381
00:32:51,615 --> 00:32:54,424
That's not an answer.

382
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:01,131
Silence is a rare gift
in a woman,

383
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:03,047
but I command you...

384
00:33:03,112 --> 00:33:05,921
look at me.

385
00:33:12,692 --> 00:33:15,501
What do you see?

386
00:33:15,566 --> 00:33:17,417
My king...

387
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:22,208
I see a man with courage
and beauty in his eyes.

388
00:33:22,273 --> 00:33:24,124
You're all the same.

389
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:27,956
You're lying to me,
just like they taught you to.

390
00:33:30,895 --> 00:33:34,597
Well, let us do
what has to be done.

391
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:44,180
You picked a rose
in the garden.

392
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:48,012
Is it a gift for your king?

393
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:50,886
My lord,
I picked it for myself.

394
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:53,760
Forgive me for taking it.

395
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:57,592
You are different.
You are courageous.

396
00:33:58,616 --> 00:34:00,467
You're not like the others.

397
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,382
Perhaps.

398
00:34:02,448 --> 00:34:06,215
The truth is that I've always
been afraid of the unknown.

399
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:10,047
And I've never known a man.

400
00:34:12,028 --> 00:34:16,754
Esther,
no one will hurt you.

401
00:35:54,412 --> 00:35:56,263
Rise, Esther,

402
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:59,137
Queen of Persia and Media.

403
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:04,885
Hail to the Queen!
Hail!

404
00:36:05,908 --> 00:36:09,676
Long life and happiness
to Queen Esther!

405
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,893
You're a Jew who bows
before a pagan king.

406
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:52,725
Esther is crowned Queen
of all Persia. Rejoice!

407
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,599
How can I rejoice when a Jewish girl
is wed to an uncircumcised heathen...

408
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:57,515
king or no king?

409
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,389
Our sons and daughters are mixing
our precious seed with...

410
00:37:00,454 --> 00:37:04,221
with foreigners, and they take for
themselves foreign names like "Esthe

411
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:07,096
Perhaps there is a hidden design
in this turn of events.

412
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:12,845
There's one way for us, the way that
leads us back to Jerusalem.

413
00:37:14,825 --> 00:37:17,634
All guards,
two steps forward, march!

414
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:20,508
- Are you afraid?
- It's not the first time...

415
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:24,275
- I've killed a man.
- It's set then. Tomorrow night.

416
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:28,109
Here is the poison.
To slip into his drink.

417
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:31,941
You have the dagger?

418
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:34,815
Tomorrow night.

419
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:49,186
Hathach!

420
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:53,018
Send for Harbona! I must speak
with the king immediately!

421
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:56,850
- It's a question of life or death.
- Yes, my queen.

422
00:38:00,747 --> 00:38:02,599
How came this evil news
to you?

423
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:05,473
The man they
call Mordecai the Jew,

424
00:38:05,538 --> 00:38:07,389
who sits within your palace gate,
sent word to me.

425
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:08,346
A Jew?

426
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:12,179
Cannot the ears of a Jew be trusted
to save the life of our king?

427
00:38:12,244 --> 00:38:13,136
Go on.

428
00:38:13,202 --> 00:38:16,011
Mordecai overheard Teresh
and Bigthan planning to kill you.

429
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:18,885
My lady, it's the word
of a stranger...

430
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:22,718
against that of two noble members
of the king's household.

431
00:38:22,783 --> 00:38:25,592
Harbona, then why don't you show
the king your precious dagger?

432
00:38:25,657 --> 00:38:28,466
I can't, my lady.
I mislaid it several days ago.

433
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:32,298
It's by the fountain in the garden.
It was to be Bigthan's murder weapon.

434
00:38:32,363 --> 00:38:36,130
But everyone was to believe
Harbona was the real assassin.

435
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:39,963
And then Teresh was to feign
Harbona's suicide with poison.

436
00:38:44,818 --> 00:38:47,627
You wanted to poison me?!

437
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,501
- And kill my king?
- It's a lie!

438
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:54,333
- We are falsely accused, my king!
- Enough!

439
00:38:57,273 --> 00:38:59,124
Memucan...

440
00:38:59,189 --> 00:39:02,956
Memucan, you conduct
a search immediately. Guards!

441
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:06,788
Hold these men prisoner
pending an investigation!

442
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:09,662
- No!
- No, please!

443
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:13,494
It will be done, my lord,
it will be done.

444
00:39:29,782 --> 00:39:31,633
So they are guilty.

445
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:36,424
But why did
they want to kill me?

446
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:40,256
This investigation of yours
doesn't say why.

447
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:42,172
They refused to explain
their reasons.

448
00:39:42,237 --> 00:39:45,046
I had entrusted them
with my life!

449
00:39:45,111 --> 00:39:47,920
They had my complete trust!

450
00:39:48,943 --> 00:39:51,752
Who is behind this,
Memucan?

451
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:58,460
When will I see an end
to all these intrigues?

452
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:08,039
Execute them, and let it be
written in the annals.

453
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:10,913
Let it be written...

454
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:14,681
in the annals of Ahasuerus,
the Great King,

455
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:18,514
that in the month of Tebeth,
Bigthan and Teresh...

456
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:22,346
My lord,
Haman is here.

457
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:25,220
...and that the plot
was discovered...

458
00:40:25,285 --> 00:40:28,094
- Let him in.
... by Mordecai the Jew,

459
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,927
who did save
the life of the king...

460
00:40:31,992 --> 00:40:34,801
with much alacrity
and courage.

461
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,717
My king...

462
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:40,092
If you bring nothing
but bad news, Haman,

463
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:41,506
you may go.

464
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:45,339
One can hide nothing
from you, my lord.

465
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:12,100
Your stupid gifts
will get you nowhere.

466
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,976
I'm patient, Chamberlain.

467
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:18,808
And most of all,
I've time to wait.

468
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,378
Memucan...

469
00:41:29,412 --> 00:41:34,137
Memucan,
I commanded you not to die.

470
00:41:34,202 --> 00:41:37,011
How dare you leave me?!

471
00:41:38,034 --> 00:41:42,759
My lady, no one is able
to make him see reason.

472
00:41:42,824 --> 00:41:46,592
No, my lady, no one may come
unsummoned before the king,

473
00:41:46,657 --> 00:41:50,424
not even the queen.
The penalty is death.

474
00:41:56,237 --> 00:41:59,046
The queen requests
to be received.

475
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:01,920
She's worried
about your health.

476
00:42:11,502 --> 00:42:14,311
Get away, all of you!

477
00:42:14,376 --> 00:42:17,185
He is in pain, my lady.
He will overcome it.

478
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,101
No one can...

479
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:28,682
My lord,

480
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:31,556
you have mourned him
for three whole days.

481
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:34,430
Do you want Memucan to come back
from the valley of death...

482
00:42:34,495 --> 00:42:37,304
to remind you of your duty?

483
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:41,136
You must go back
to governing again.

484
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,969
If the queen has lost
the king's favor,

485
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:46,885
there will be sad days
ahead.

486
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,465
Haman...

487
00:42:56,594 --> 00:43:00,329
- What do you want?
- Help me win back the king's favor.

488
00:43:00,363 --> 00:43:02,214
Speak to him.

489
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,088
I'm not in a position
to do so.

490
00:43:05,153 --> 00:43:06,938
You think you can get away
with this?

491
00:43:07,005 --> 00:43:10,772
I got rid of Carshena for you,
and this is how you repay me?

492
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:17,478
What's the trouble?

493
00:43:17,543 --> 00:43:20,352
What was that all about?

494
00:43:20,418 --> 00:43:22,269
Shut up,
you foolish woman!

495
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:24,185
What more do you want?

496
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,017
The king is about to appoint me
his new Lord Chamberlain.

497
00:43:50,117 --> 00:43:51,968
Are you mad?

498
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:54,842
You show no respect
for the king's right hand man?

499
00:43:54,907 --> 00:43:57,717
Never will I bow to that man.

500
00:43:57,782 --> 00:43:59,633
The king commands it.

501
00:43:59,698 --> 00:44:01,549
Who are you to disobey?

502
00:44:01,614 --> 00:44:05,316
A Jew who prostrates himself
only before the Lord.

503
00:44:23,585 --> 00:44:28,310
It's not so easy as it looks.
It takes time.

504
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:31,184
It seems
I have plenty of time.

505
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,807
If you ask me, our king should pay
more attention to his beautiful queen.

506
00:44:39,872 --> 00:44:42,681
You know what the king should do
better than the king himself?

507
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:46,513
Can't you see how she suffers
since she lost his affection?

508
00:44:54,243 --> 00:44:56,987
- My queen...
- Hegai,

509
00:44:57,117 --> 00:44:59,926
am I not still the same Esther
you took under your wing?

510
00:44:59,991 --> 00:45:01,776
Yes...

511
00:45:04,718 --> 00:45:07,527
It seems I have lost favor
with the king.

512
00:45:07,592 --> 00:45:08,484
That cannot be.

513
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:12,317
If I have done anything, anything
that has displeased him...

514
00:45:12,382 --> 00:45:14,233
Why should you think so?

515
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:17,108
He's not sent for me
in weeks.

516
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:20,940
Please, Hegai, tell me...
what shall I do?

517
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:22,856
Be patient.

518
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,730
The king attends
to many urgent matters.

519
00:45:25,795 --> 00:45:28,604
He instructs a new
Lord Chamberlain besides.

520
00:45:28,669 --> 00:45:30,520
Haman.

521
00:45:31,544 --> 00:45:36,269
This man alone does not show
respect to Your Lordship.

522
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:41,059
His superiors speak to him day after
day, but he does not listen.

523
00:45:41,124 --> 00:45:43,933
Pay him no heed.
The man is mad.

524
00:45:43,998 --> 00:45:47,765
I cannot be bothered
by such foolishness.

525
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:55,430
I want to talk to the Jew.

526
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,238
Him!

527
00:45:58,305 --> 00:46:00,156
Bow your head!

528
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:08,778
You know
I can make you do it.

529
00:46:08,843 --> 00:46:10,694
You know that!

530
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,527
He despises me.
He insults me.

531
00:46:14,592 --> 00:46:18,359
He turns the sweet honey
in my mouth to bitter bile.

532
00:46:18,424 --> 00:46:22,191
You exercise the power of
the king. Do something.

533
00:46:22,256 --> 00:46:25,065
- Kill him.
- It's beneath me to lay hands on him.

534
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,939
Jews!
They cheat us,

535
00:46:28,005 --> 00:46:31,772
then hoard their wealth
to flaunt before us.

536
00:46:31,837 --> 00:46:34,646
They think themselves
better than the rest.

537
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,562
Jews!

538
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:40,394
I don't want to hear
anything more about them!

539
00:46:40,459 --> 00:46:43,268
We should destroy them.

540
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:49,976
Destroy every man, woman,
and child among them!

541
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,891
All of them...

542
00:46:53,872 --> 00:46:55,657
all at once.

543
00:46:56,682 --> 00:46:59,491
Forgive me, my lord,
forgive me.

544
00:46:59,556 --> 00:47:03,323
Haman requests to speak
with you.

545
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:05,239
Let him in.

546
00:47:10,095 --> 00:47:11,946
My lord,

547
00:47:12,011 --> 00:47:14,820
a most urgent matter
that must be discussed...

548
00:47:14,885 --> 00:47:17,694
away from indiscreet ears.

549
00:47:29,256 --> 00:47:32,065
A certain people,

550
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,939
scattered and dispersed among the
populace in all the provinces...

551
00:47:35,004 --> 00:47:37,813
Yes, yes, yes,
come to the point!

552
00:47:37,878 --> 00:47:39,729
Their laws are different.

553
00:47:40,752 --> 00:47:43,562
There can be only one law.

554
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:47,394
One day in seven they refuse
to work. They hoard money...

555
00:47:47,459 --> 00:47:49,310
and cheat on their taxes.

556
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:53,142
How do you suggest
we solve the problem?

557
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:55,058
Eliminate the problem.

558
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:59,848
If it pleases the king,

559
00:48:02,788 --> 00:48:05,597
let a decree be issued
for their destruction.

560
00:48:05,662 --> 00:48:07,513
I cannot destroy
my own subjects!

561
00:48:07,578 --> 00:48:10,387
If lawbreaking is tolerated,
others will follow.

562
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:14,219
Tributes and tax revenues
decline.

563
00:48:17,158 --> 00:48:19,009
Be logical, Haman.

564
00:48:19,075 --> 00:48:20,926
The dead yield no taxes.

565
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,800
It's not a question of taxes.

566
00:48:23,865 --> 00:48:28,590
I will pay 10,000 talents of silver
into the king's treasury if need be.

567
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,506
My lord,

568
00:48:30,571 --> 00:48:33,380
the stability of the entire
kingdom is in danger.

569
00:48:33,445 --> 00:48:36,254
These people
are capable of far worse.

570
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,171
They can conspire against us.

571
00:48:38,236 --> 00:48:42,003
They occupy important positions
in every city of the kingdom.

572
00:48:42,068 --> 00:48:45,835
That's why I insist
we rid ourselves of them.

573
00:48:47,816 --> 00:48:50,560
If what you say is true,

574
00:48:51,584 --> 00:48:53,435
we must act.

575
00:48:57,333 --> 00:49:00,142
Who might these people be?

576
00:49:01,165 --> 00:49:04,932
A small,
insignificant clan, my king.

577
00:49:05,955 --> 00:49:08,764
If my king trusts me,

578
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:13,554
I'll take care
of the details personally.

579
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:18,345
There is no one else
I can trust.

580
00:49:26,074 --> 00:49:28,883
You will be granted
all the powers.

581
00:49:28,948 --> 00:49:32,715
I want to know nothing
about the matter.

582
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:48,937
The lot falls to the 13th day.

583
00:49:49,962 --> 00:49:51,813
And now the month...

584
00:49:54,753 --> 00:49:57,562
The month of Adar
is propitious.

585
00:49:57,627 --> 00:50:00,436
The 13th of Adar...

586
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:04,268
Men cast the lots
but the gods decide.

587
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:09,058
The gods decide.
I shall make ready.

588
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:12,891
Scribes!

589
00:50:14,872 --> 00:50:17,681
To every province
in its own script,

590
00:50:17,746 --> 00:50:21,513
and to every people
in its own language,

591
00:50:21,578 --> 00:50:24,387
by a royal decree
of Ahasuerus:

592
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:28,219
Let them destroy,
kill and annihilate

593
00:50:28,284 --> 00:50:30,135
all the Jews,

594
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:33,968
young and old,
women and children...

595
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:37,800
Young and old, women
and children in one day?

596
00:50:37,865 --> 00:50:39,716
The 13th day
of the twelfth month,

597
00:50:39,781 --> 00:50:43,548
which is the month of Adar;
and to plunder their goods...

598
00:50:43,613 --> 00:50:46,357
And let this decree be issued
in every province by proclamation,

599
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:50,190
calling on all the peoples to
prepare and make ready for that day.

600
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,107
Your Persian king
is going to kill us!

601
00:50:52,172 --> 00:50:54,023
No, no.

602
00:50:54,088 --> 00:50:57,855
It cannot be.
We have lived here for years.

603
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,687
They are our friends...
They won't allow this to happen.

604
00:51:05,584 --> 00:51:07,435
They won't.

605
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:13,184
We must leave before it's too late.
Take this and go.

606
00:51:20,913 --> 00:51:22,764
Hey you, girl...

607
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,680
- Come here! Come on!
- Leave me alone!

608
00:51:24,745 --> 00:51:30,430
- You know we can do what we like.
- Help! Somebody help me!

609
00:51:34,326 --> 00:51:35,218
Jew!

610
00:51:35,284 --> 00:51:38,093
Leave him be.
We'll deal with him later.

611
00:51:39,116 --> 00:51:40,967
Oh, my God!

612
00:51:42,884 --> 00:51:45,693
Have you forgotten us, Lord?

613
00:51:45,758 --> 00:51:48,568
Have you forgotten us?

614
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:58,499
Woe to the Jews!

615
00:51:58,564 --> 00:52:01,374
Woe to the children of Israel!
We are undone!

616
00:52:01,439 --> 00:52:05,206
Our enemies sit in ambush.

617
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:12,870
Woe to the Jews!

618
00:52:12,935 --> 00:52:16,702
Woe to the children
of Israel!

619
00:52:18,684 --> 00:52:20,535
We are undone!

620
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:23,409
Why does our God...

621
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,283
why does our Lord
not save us?

622
00:52:26,348 --> 00:52:29,157
- Get away, you filthy wretch!
- Katare!

623
00:52:31,138 --> 00:52:33,947
Mordecai, be quiet.

624
00:52:34,012 --> 00:52:35,863
Get a hold of yourself.

625
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,696
- We are undone!
- Quiet, my friend.

626
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:42,570
- No, no!
- Quiet, quiet!

627
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:47,295
You want to make things worse
for you and your people?

628
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,129
You must not play the fool.

629
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,961
Get a hold of yourself!

630
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:07,416
- He's still there!
- But he's been howling for hours...

631
00:53:07,481 --> 00:53:08,373
Who?

632
00:53:08,439 --> 00:53:11,248
It is the Jew, my lady.
Such a racket.

633
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,122
He wails night and day
without ceasing.

634
00:53:14,187 --> 00:53:16,997
He dresses in sackcloth and ashes
and sits outside the king's gate.

635
00:53:17,062 --> 00:53:18,913
- What Jew?
- His name is...

636
00:53:18,978 --> 00:53:21,787
It's the man who warned you
of the plot against the king.

637
00:53:21,852 --> 00:53:23,703
Are you sure?

638
00:53:36,223 --> 00:53:39,990
The queen commands you
to make yourself presentable.

639
00:53:54,362 --> 00:53:59,087
He refused them?
Why?

640
00:54:02,026 --> 00:54:06,751
Hathach, return to him, please,
and ask him what afflicts him.

641
00:54:07,774 --> 00:54:09,625
Ten thousand talents of silver,

642
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:14,416
that is the price
of our lives for the king!

643
00:54:14,481 --> 00:54:18,248
Tell the queen that Mordecai
charges her to go before the king...

644
00:54:18,313 --> 00:54:22,080
and plead with him
for her people.

645
00:54:28,851 --> 00:54:30,702
But why?

646
00:54:32,684 --> 00:54:35,493
Why was I not informed
of this decree?

647
00:54:35,558 --> 00:54:38,367
My lady,
these are affairs of the king...

648
00:54:38,432 --> 00:54:42,134
I don't know what gives
this Mordecai the right...

649
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:45,967
"Plead for her people... "

650
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:49,799
But it is forbidden to go before
the king without being called!

651
00:54:49,865 --> 00:54:52,674
On penalty of death,
my queen.

652
00:54:53,697 --> 00:54:56,506
But if the king holds out the golden
scepter that person may live.

653
00:54:56,571 --> 00:54:59,380
Maybe the king remembers the
sweet nights he spent with you.

654
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:02,254
If there ever was such a time that
he felt such tenderness for me,

655
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,170
it is over.

656
00:55:05,193 --> 00:55:08,002
It has been so long
since he sent for me.

657
00:55:10,942 --> 00:55:13,751
I must go to Mordecai myself.
I must make him understand.

658
00:55:13,816 --> 00:55:16,625
If you are found outside the
harem, outside the palace gates,

659
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,541
in the company of a man...

660
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:27,164
Do not think that in the King's
palace you will escape...

661
00:55:27,229 --> 00:55:29,080
any more than all
the other Jews.

662
00:55:29,145 --> 00:55:33,870
Because if you keep silent
at such a time,

663
00:55:33,935 --> 00:55:36,744
relief and deliverance will rise
for the Jews from another quarter.

664
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:42,427
But you, and with you,
your father's family, will perish.

665
00:55:43,451 --> 00:55:45,302
Hadassah,

666
00:55:45,367 --> 00:55:49,135
perhaps you have come
to royalty

667
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,925
for such a time
as this.

668
00:55:56,864 --> 00:55:59,673
Those were his words.

669
00:55:59,738 --> 00:56:04,463
But, I beg of you, my queen,
do not risk your life.

670
00:56:10,277 --> 00:56:12,128
Seize him.

671
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:15,002
Come on!

672
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,792
Wait...

673
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:36,013
Mordecai...

674
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:43,680
Mordecai...

675
00:56:45,662 --> 00:56:48,471
- Mordecai...
- Hadassah!

676
00:56:49,494 --> 00:56:51,345
I'm Esther.
Go.

677
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:54,219
Gather all the Jews
to be found in Susa.

678
00:56:54,284 --> 00:56:57,093
Fast on my behalf.

679
00:56:57,158 --> 00:57:00,925
Neither eat nor drink
for three days, night or day.

680
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:05,716
Esther, if only I could
have spared you with...

681
00:57:05,781 --> 00:57:07,632
Do as I command.

682
00:57:07,697 --> 00:57:12,422
I and my handmaids will fast also.
Then, I will go to the king,

683
00:57:13,445 --> 00:57:16,254
though it is against his law.

684
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:21,045
If I perish, I perish.

685
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:28,709
May the Lord protect you,
Esther...

686
00:57:42,123 --> 00:57:44,932
Come in aid of Your servants...

687
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:47,806
We are in overwhelming danger.

688
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:51,638
Father,
You who chose our fathers...

689
00:57:51,703 --> 00:57:54,512
You who punished us...

690
00:57:54,577 --> 00:57:59,303
and turned us over to our enemies
because we have sinned against You...

691
00:58:00,326 --> 00:58:05,051
...still not happy, they want us
to be completely annihilated.

692
00:58:05,116 --> 00:58:10,800
Do not allow them to triumph, Lord,
but turn their plans against them,

693
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,631
and strike the first
of our persecutors.

694
00:58:15,655 --> 00:58:17,506
Put the words...

695
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:23,254
that will touch the heart
of my king into my mouth.

696
00:58:24,277 --> 00:58:29,002
Let them remind him of the love
he once felt for me...

697
00:58:29,067 --> 00:58:34,685
and turn his heart against those
who hate and battle against us.

698
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:37,561
Let him be the one to yield.

699
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:43,309
Free me...

700
00:58:47,206 --> 00:58:49,057
Free me...

701
00:58:51,038 --> 00:58:54,805
Deliver me from my anguish,
O Lord!

702
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:46,476
Maimuna, I need to bathe and dress.
Please, lay out my robes.

703
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:00,847
I'm ready.

704
01:00:33,423 --> 01:00:37,190
Next, Great King, we have
the trade delegation from Bactria.

705
01:00:38,213 --> 01:00:40,064
Have they paid
their tribute?

706
01:00:40,129 --> 01:00:41,980
Not yet, Majesty.

707
01:00:43,003 --> 01:00:46,770
Let them wait!
I've been waiting...

708
01:00:48,752 --> 01:00:52,519
I've been waiting for months!
I have no intention...

709
01:01:11,745 --> 01:01:14,554
Do not fear, Esther.

710
01:01:21,325 --> 01:01:23,176
If it pleases the king...

711
01:01:25,158 --> 01:01:28,925
What is your request,
Beloved Queen?

712
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:33,715
It shall be given you,
even to the half of my kingdom.

713
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,631
Let the king...

714
01:01:35,696 --> 01:01:37,547
and Haman...

715
01:01:39,528 --> 01:01:44,254
come today to the banquet
I have prepared in my quarters...

716
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,170
for the king.

717
01:02:00,606 --> 01:02:02,457
Let it be...

718
01:02:04,438 --> 01:02:07,247
as our queen desires.

719
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:48,379
Now,
my delectable queen,

720
01:02:48,444 --> 01:02:51,253
what is your petition?

721
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:58,918
Come, come.
Tell me.

722
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:02,750
What is your request?
It shall be fulfilled.

723
01:03:02,815 --> 01:03:05,624
If I have found
favor with you,

724
01:03:05,689 --> 01:03:09,456
and if it pleases the king to grant
my petition and fulfill my request...

725
01:03:09,521 --> 01:03:13,288
then let the king
and Haman come again tomorrow...

726
01:03:13,353 --> 01:03:16,163
to the banquet
I shall prepare for them.

727
01:03:17,186 --> 01:03:22,804
- This woman tries our patience.
- Indeed, my lord, as do they all.

728
01:03:23,828 --> 01:03:26,637
Then I shall tell my wish...

729
01:03:29,576 --> 01:03:32,385
as my king desires.

730
01:03:36,283 --> 01:03:40,050
Bow before the great Haman!

731
01:03:59,276 --> 01:04:02,085
All this does me no good...

732
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:05,917
as long as I see
that insolent Jew...

733
01:04:05,982 --> 01:04:07,833
refusing to acknowledge me!

734
01:04:07,898 --> 01:04:10,707
Vultures will feast on
his insolence soon enough, Father.

735
01:04:10,773 --> 01:04:13,582
Not soon enough for me.

736
01:04:13,647 --> 01:04:15,432
Then build a gallows...

737
01:04:15,499 --> 01:04:18,308
fifty cubits high.
Get the king's consent...

738
01:04:18,373 --> 01:04:24,057
- and hang Mordecai upon it.
- I'll have to build it immediately.

739
01:04:55,737 --> 01:04:58,546
- My lord?
- I cannot sleep.

740
01:04:58,611 --> 01:05:01,420
Shall I call a scribe,
with your permission, my lord?

741
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:05,252
His readings will help you
fall a sleep.

742
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:23,392
In the 10th month,
two eunuchs of the threshold...

743
01:05:23,457 --> 01:05:26,266
did conspire to assassinate
the king.

744
01:05:26,331 --> 01:05:29,141
By the grace of the god,
Ahuramazda, the Wise Lord,

745
01:05:29,206 --> 01:05:32,973
the plot was discovered
and exposed...

746
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:39,679
...by a certain Mordecai,
the Jew, who sat within the gates...

747
01:05:39,744 --> 01:05:43,511
and by whose brave action
did save the life of the king.

748
01:05:43,576 --> 01:05:45,427
Is that all?

749
01:05:45,492 --> 01:05:49,260
The eunuchs were executed
under the laws of Persia.

750
01:05:54,115 --> 01:05:55,966
Harbona!

751
01:05:58,905 --> 01:06:01,714
Ah, my lord, the king wants
to see you immediately.

752
01:06:01,779 --> 01:06:03,630
- Do you know what he wants?
- I believe he owes...

753
01:06:03,696 --> 01:06:06,505
a debt of gratitude to someone.

754
01:06:07,528 --> 01:06:10,272
I am yours to command,
King of Kings.

755
01:06:10,338 --> 01:06:12,189
Tell me,

756
01:06:12,254 --> 01:06:16,979
what shall be done for a man
the king wishes to honor?

757
01:06:18,002 --> 01:06:20,811
To the man whom
the king wishes to honor...

758
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,685
let royal robes be brought...

759
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:27,518
and the king's horse, with a royal
crown on its head, and...

760
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:32,308
let him be conducted on horseback
through the open square of the city.

761
01:06:32,373 --> 01:06:34,224
Good!

762
01:06:34,289 --> 01:06:39,973
Thus shall be done for a man
the king wishes to honor.

763
01:07:28,834 --> 01:07:30,685
I am brought low.

764
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:36,434
The gods are surely envious
of my glory to so sorely mock me.

765
01:07:36,498 --> 01:07:39,307
What scoundrel invented
my father's misfortune?

766
01:07:39,373 --> 01:07:42,182
It was I!

767
01:07:42,247 --> 01:07:46,014
I knew not that the king
meant to honor that foul toad.

768
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,846
I thought he wished to honor me!

769
01:07:51,827 --> 01:07:54,636
And thus I proposed
a fitting tribute,

770
01:07:54,701 --> 01:07:58,469
which he then charged me
to execute in favor of my enemy!

771
01:07:58,534 --> 01:08:03,259
If that Mordecai is part
of the Jewish people,

772
01:08:03,324 --> 01:08:08,942
I fear this is but
the beginning of your downfall.

773
01:08:09,009 --> 01:08:10,860
What?

774
01:08:16,673 --> 01:08:20,441
- Open in the name of the King!
- Open up.

775
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:26,189
My Lord Chamberlain,
are you ready?

776
01:08:26,254 --> 01:08:29,063
The queen's banquet
is prepared.

777
01:08:30,086 --> 01:08:34,811
You see, good wife?
I'm still the king's right hand man.

778
01:08:48,289 --> 01:08:51,098
The fowl was excellent.

779
01:08:53,079 --> 01:08:55,889
My lord,
the queen looks like a goddess.

780
01:08:55,954 --> 01:08:59,721
Even if she were to feed me
poison, I would die a happy man.

781
01:08:59,786 --> 01:09:02,530
Take care how you flatter
my wife, Lord Chamberlain.

782
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:04,447
Your king is a jealous man.

783
01:09:04,512 --> 01:09:09,237
I intend only to praise
my lord's impeccable taste.

784
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:11,152
Enough.

785
01:09:13,134 --> 01:09:18,819
Now, you promised to tell me
your petition and your request.

786
01:09:19,841 --> 01:09:21,692
And it shall be granted?

787
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:25,524
Even to the half of my kingdom.

788
01:09:31,337 --> 01:09:35,105
If I have won your favor,
and if it pleases the king,

789
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,021
let my life be given me.

790
01:09:37,086 --> 01:09:39,895
- That is my petition.
- Your life?

791
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,769
And the lives of my people.
That is my request.

792
01:09:42,834 --> 01:09:45,643
She ensnares me in riddles.

793
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:48,517
I know nothing
about your people.

794
01:09:50,499 --> 01:09:54,266
We are to be sold, I and my people,
not merely as slaves,

795
01:09:54,331 --> 01:09:57,140
for then I would have held
my peace.

796
01:09:57,205 --> 01:09:59,949
You cannot be sold.
You're mine.

797
01:10:00,015 --> 01:10:01,866
We have been sold...

798
01:10:02,889 --> 01:10:04,740
to be destroyed,
to be killed...

799
01:10:04,805 --> 01:10:08,572
- to be annihilated!
- My lord, perhaps I can explain...

800
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:11,447
And no enemy can compensate
for this damage to our king.

801
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:15,279
Speak clearly, woman.
What damage? What enemy?

802
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:21,028
Haman. Through his enmity towards
my kinsman, Mordecai.

803
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:23,901
- Your kinsman?
- Your kinsman!

804
01:10:23,966 --> 01:10:26,775
Haman has decreed death
to all the Jews,

805
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,650
every man, woman,
and child.

806
01:10:38,337 --> 01:10:41,146
My lady, I beg you...

807
01:10:42,169 --> 01:10:45,936
I had no wish to harm you...
how could I know?

808
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:55,517
Have mercy on me,
I beseech you,

809
01:10:55,582 --> 01:10:57,433
for the sake of my sons.

810
01:10:57,498 --> 01:11:01,265
I will be your slave
but spare my life!

811
01:11:04,205 --> 01:11:06,056
Guards! Eunuchs!

812
01:11:06,121 --> 01:11:08,930
Will he assault the queen
in my house, in my presence?!

813
01:11:08,995 --> 01:11:10,846
It's a misunderstanding,
I can explain...

814
01:11:10,911 --> 01:11:13,720
He insults the queen and plots
to destroy her people!

815
01:11:13,785 --> 01:11:15,636
The penalty is death!

816
01:11:15,701 --> 01:11:18,510
A gallows 50 cubits high
stands at Haman's house.

817
01:11:18,575 --> 01:11:22,342
He prepared it for Mordecai,
who saved the king!

818
01:11:22,408 --> 01:11:25,217
- Hang him on that!
- Great Queen, save me!

819
01:11:25,282 --> 01:11:27,133
Tell them the truth!

820
01:11:30,072 --> 01:11:31,923
Wait!

821
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:33,839
My ring!

822
01:11:34,862 --> 01:11:38,629
No! Have mercy!
Tell them the truth!

823
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:40,545
Please!

824
01:12:14,078 --> 01:12:15,929
Please, don't bow before me,
cousin.

825
01:12:15,994 --> 01:12:18,803
You are the most powerful
woman in the kingdom.

826
01:12:18,869 --> 01:12:21,678
But that doesn't change
the way I see you.

827
01:12:22,701 --> 01:12:24,552
Mordecai,

828
01:12:24,617 --> 01:12:27,426
you know me well,
remember?

829
01:12:30,365 --> 01:12:34,132
This is the Hadassah I know.

830
01:12:35,155 --> 01:12:38,923
The Lord has granted
my request.

831
01:12:41,862 --> 01:12:44,671
But let us not rejoice
too soon.

832
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:47,545
It's not over yet.

833
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:51,377
Yes, that is why the Jews
put their trust in you.

834
01:12:51,442 --> 01:12:53,227
Let them keep their faith.

835
01:12:56,169 --> 01:12:58,020
The king has come back
to me with his love.

836
01:12:58,086 --> 01:13:00,895
I shall go to him and ask him
to revoke Haman's decree.

837
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,769
I will not let
our people down.

838
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,559
Approach, Mordecai.

839
01:13:11,498 --> 01:13:13,349
Give us your hand.

840
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:20,056
The trust which we unwisely placed
in the hands of your enemy,

841
01:13:22,037 --> 01:13:24,846
we now confer on you.

842
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:39,217
My dear cousin,
as my king sees fit to trust you,

843
01:13:39,282 --> 01:13:41,133
so do I,
with all my heart.

844
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:43,049
I give unto you
my property,

845
01:13:43,114 --> 01:13:45,923
and set you over
the house of Haman.

846
01:13:47,904 --> 01:13:49,689
So shall it be.

847
01:13:49,756 --> 01:13:53,523
And now, if there be
no other urgent matters...

848
01:13:54,547 --> 01:13:59,272
If it pleases the king
and if I have won his favor...

849
01:13:59,337 --> 01:14:02,146
- Yes?
- My lord,

850
01:14:03,169 --> 01:14:05,978
how can I bear to see
calamity come on my people?

851
01:14:06,043 --> 01:14:07,894
My own kindred.

852
01:14:07,959 --> 01:14:11,726
Let an order be written to revoke the
letters devised by Haman the Agagite...

853
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:15,559
in which he decreed to destroy
the Jews in all the provinces.

854
01:14:15,624 --> 01:14:19,391
It was a royal decree.
It cannot be revoked.

855
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:21,307
It is the law.

856
01:14:21,372 --> 01:14:26,097
The laws are made by the king, surely
they can be unmade by the king,

857
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:30,887
An edict sealed with the
King's ring can't be revoked.

858
01:14:30,953 --> 01:14:32,804
Not even by the king himself.

859
01:14:45,323 --> 01:14:47,108
Mordecai,

860
01:14:47,175 --> 01:14:51,901
you have shown yourself to be
both wise and clever.

861
01:15:01,546 --> 01:15:06,271
Please, please, please!
Just one at a time!

862
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:09,145
If we all speak at once,
then nobody listens.

863
01:15:09,211 --> 01:15:12,978
- He's right. Listen to me.
- Why you? First listen to me!

864
01:15:13,043 --> 01:15:14,894
No, no,
please stop,

865
01:15:14,959 --> 01:15:17,768
because by the time you decide
who is to speak first,

866
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:20,642
it will be the 13th of Adar
and we shall all be dead.

867
01:15:20,707 --> 01:15:24,474
Now, you said that the Lord
has abandoned us.

868
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:28,307
What I say is...
we have turned away from the Lord.

869
01:15:28,372 --> 01:15:30,223
Ezra is right.

870
01:15:30,288 --> 01:15:34,055
How can the Lord hear our prayer
so far from Jerusalem?

871
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,929
We should return
while there is yet time.

872
01:15:36,994 --> 01:15:38,845
What safety
is there in Jerusalem?

873
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:40,761
The walls lie in ruins.

874
01:15:45,552 --> 01:15:49,320
Listen! Listen, friends! Please!
Please listen to what I have to say.

875
01:15:49,385 --> 01:15:52,194
- You're not one of us!
- I am a Jew, just like you!

876
01:15:52,259 --> 01:15:55,068
But how could I survive at the
Persian court if I told them?

877
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:58,900
- He's Nehemia, the king's cup bearer.
- Let him speak.

878
01:15:58,965 --> 01:16:00,816
Ezra is not wrong.

879
01:16:00,881 --> 01:16:03,690
One day, the Jews must
return to Jerusalem, but...

880
01:16:03,755 --> 01:16:05,606
But?

881
01:16:05,672 --> 01:16:08,481
Is it so easy to give up
what we have struggled to build?

882
01:16:08,546 --> 01:16:11,355
Our homes
and our families are here.

883
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:15,187
Our fathers and grandfathers
lie buried in this ground.

884
01:16:15,252 --> 01:16:19,019
- Listen to me! Listen to me!
- No, you must let him speak!

885
01:16:19,084 --> 01:16:21,893
Listen!
Listen...

886
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:24,768
The king has given authority to
Queen Esther and Mordecai,

887
01:16:24,833 --> 01:16:29,558
to find a solution. Give them time.
Have faith a little longer.

888
01:16:29,623 --> 01:16:33,390
Have faith?
In the laws of Persia?

889
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:36,264
Or have faith in the Lord?

890
01:16:36,329 --> 01:16:40,096
Salvation for the Jews...
our very survival...

891
01:16:40,161 --> 01:16:42,905
dwells in the land
promised to Abraham.

892
01:16:42,972 --> 01:16:45,782
I would sooner live
in a city with no walls...

893
01:16:45,847 --> 01:16:50,539
than in the richest empire
that has no true faith.

894
01:16:53,511 --> 01:16:56,320
How will we find
a way to save us?

895
01:16:57,343 --> 01:17:01,110
Oh Lord, why have you
turned away from us?

896
01:17:01,175 --> 01:17:06,860
Please, put the right words into
my mouth and turn his heart...

897
01:17:07,882 --> 01:17:09,733
Turn his heart...

898
01:17:09,798 --> 01:17:14,523
Turn the heart of he who battles
against us! Turn! Can't you see?

899
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:18,355
We have asked the Lord to turn
our fate against our enemies,

900
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:20,271
and in His goodness,

901
01:17:20,337 --> 01:17:24,104
He has given us the means
to do so.

902
01:17:25,127 --> 01:17:26,978
The law.

903
01:17:28,001 --> 01:17:29,852
To every province
in its own script,

904
01:17:29,917 --> 01:17:32,726
and to every people
in its own language.

905
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:37,516
And to the Jews
in our script and our language,

906
01:17:37,581 --> 01:17:40,325
by royal decree of Ahasuerus,
King of Kings,

907
01:17:40,392 --> 01:17:43,201
to all his governors
and officials:

908
01:17:43,266 --> 01:17:47,033
Let the Jews in every city
assemble and defend their lives,

909
01:17:47,098 --> 01:17:52,782
to destroy, kill and annihilate
any armed force of any people

910
01:17:52,846 --> 01:17:55,655
that might threaten them
on a single day:

911
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,529
The 13th day
of the 12th month of Adar.

912
01:17:58,595 --> 01:18:03,320
Let this decree be published
in every province,

913
01:18:04,343 --> 01:18:07,152
and issued
to all peoples,

914
01:18:07,217 --> 01:18:11,942
and let the Jews prepare
and make ready for that day.

915
01:18:17,756 --> 01:18:19,607
Ezra!

916
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:23,439
Ezra,
have you heard the edict?

917
01:18:23,504 --> 01:18:25,355
It doesn't promise triumph,
only bloodshed.

918
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,271
There's no guarantee
we will win.

919
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:32,061
At least we can defend ourselves,
if all we have is tools and stones.

920
01:18:32,126 --> 01:18:34,935
Is this battle the right way?

921
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:37,745
This battle will keep
the Jews alive.

922
01:18:45,475 --> 01:18:47,326
Let us begin...

923
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:51,158
Blessed art Thou,
O Lord,

924
01:18:51,223 --> 01:18:54,032
Whose hand is gracious
to those who seek You.

925
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:58,823
Protect and defend Your people
tomorrow on the day of battle,

926
01:18:58,888 --> 01:19:02,655
and deliver us
from our enemies...

927
01:20:22,174 --> 01:20:25,941
The Jews have defended
themselves well.

928
01:20:26,965 --> 01:20:30,732
Hundreds of people have
been killed, on both sides.

929
01:20:31,755 --> 01:20:35,522
We are still awaiting reports
from the provinces.

930
01:20:39,419 --> 01:20:42,228
I wanted to tell you myself.

931
01:20:45,168 --> 01:20:47,019
Rejoice, my queen.

932
01:20:48,042 --> 01:20:50,851
You have saved your people.

933
01:20:51,874 --> 01:20:53,725
It's over, Esther.

934
01:20:56,664 --> 01:21:01,389
The peril. The blood.
It's all over.

935
01:21:04,329 --> 01:21:08,096
Now I have a request for you.

936
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:15,760
And I ask you to listen
to me...

937
01:21:15,825 --> 01:21:18,634
if I have found favor
in your eyes...

938
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,065
Be my queen.

939
01:21:31,091 --> 01:21:33,900
Share my kingdom,
my nights...

940
01:21:33,965 --> 01:21:36,774
Be the light of my life.

941
01:21:44,504 --> 01:21:48,271
I shall be your lover
when you desire me,

942
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:51,145
and your counsel
when you need me...

943
01:21:52,168 --> 01:21:55,935
I've never given a woman
the love I feel for you.

944
01:21:58,874 --> 01:22:01,684
It shall be so.

945
01:22:12,287 --> 01:22:16,054
I, Esther, Queen of Persia,
decree that each year...

946
01:22:16,119 --> 01:22:20,845
the Jews will commemorate
the 14th and 15th days of Adar,

947
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:25,635
because this was the month in which
their despair was turned into joy,

948
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:29,402
their mourning into
a feast of celebration,

949
01:22:29,468 --> 01:22:33,235
with exchanging of gifts
and almsgiving to the poor.

950
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:38,025
And to remember how their fate,
or Pur, was turned around,

951
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:41,858
it shall be called
The Feast of Purim.

952
01:23:24,971 --> 01:23:27,780
While many Jews
still remained in Persia,

953
01:23:27,845 --> 01:23:31,612
others decided,
under the leadership of Ezra,

954
01:23:31,677 --> 01:23:36,403
to return to the land from which
their ancestors had been deported.

955
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:17,599
They were sustained
on their long journey

956
01:24:17,664 --> 01:24:20,473
by the desire to rebuild
a nation of their own.

957
01:24:20,538 --> 01:24:25,198
In the Temple of Jerusalem, which
rose again after the destruction,

958
01:24:25,265 --> 01:24:27,116
they would pray together
with those of the Jews

959
01:24:27,181 --> 01:24:30,948
who had returned after
King Cyrus' edict years before.

960
01:24:31,013 --> 01:24:33,823
The walls of Jerusalem
would rise again too,

961
01:24:33,888 --> 01:24:36,697
under the wise ruler,
Nehemia,

962
01:24:36,762 --> 01:24:40,529
who was appointed Governor
of Judea by the Persian King.

963
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:44,361
Ezra,
the scribe and priest,

964
01:24:44,426 --> 01:24:47,235
became the spiritual leader
of the people of Israel,

965
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:51,067
and helped them to preserve
the divine word of the Bible

966
01:24:51,133 --> 01:24:55,858
at the center of their lives
and at the heart of their faith.

967
01:24:55,923 --> 01:24:57,774
"In the beginning,

968
01:24:57,839 --> 01:25:01,606
God created the heaven
and the earth.

969
01:25:02,629 --> 01:25:05,438
And the earth
was without form,

970
01:25:05,503 --> 01:25:09,270
and void and darkness
was upon the face of the deep.

971
01:25:09,336 --> 01:25:13,103
And the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters,

972
01:25:13,168 --> 01:25:16,935
and God said,
'Let there be light',

973
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,744
and there was light... "
