00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,021
(woman cackles)

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,193
- Woman: "So, he skipped"...
- Girl: Skipped from the...

3
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,724
Woman:
No, no, no. I'm gonna do it alone.

4
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:02,263
"So he skipped from the oven
and into bread dough,

5
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:06,641
all ready to rise
in the night kitchen."

6
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,376
What time is it?

7
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,974
It's almost 10:00.

8
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,179
Why?

9
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,725
After the book,
will you do my nails?

10
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,889
You never want me
to do your nails.

11
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,557
I know.

12
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,794
But I thought it would be fun.

13
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,304
What time is it, Mom?

14
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,708
Let's see.

15
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,212
It's past your bedtime.
It's after 11:00!

16
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,680
Let's make cookies!

17
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,684
- ( Gasps )
- Please?

18
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,153
You're so pretty.

19
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,523
Thank you.

20
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,734
(crickets chirping)

21
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,477
- ( faint barking)
- ( Door creaks)

22
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,811
( knocking )

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,414
Ronnie? Come in, sweetie.

24
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,888
Ronnie: I didn't want to,
but she made me.

25
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,982
- What?
- I'm sorry, please. I'm sorry.

26
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,789
Shh. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

27
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,922
- Shh. It's okay.
- ( Sobbing )

28
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,007
Girl:
Why do I have to bring her?

29
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:50,037
Honey, you've played with her
since kindergarten.

30
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,571
She's weird.

31
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,551
Well, all the more reason
to be kind.

32
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,918
I don't think Ronnie has any friends,
sweetheart.

33
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,581
I like Ronnie.

34
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,420
Then you hang out with her.

35
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,619
( Knocking on door)

36
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,363
Woman: Come on in, sweetie.
Come on in.

37
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,959
Is this what you got
for the birthday girl?

38
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,470
- Ronnie: My mom got it.
- Woman: Yeah?

39
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,905
Boy, you're getting lovelier
every day.

40
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,706
Look at your cute figure.
( chuckles )

41
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,440
- Ronnie: I don't have a figure.
- Woman: Oh, but you will.

42
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,938
And when you do,
it's going to be outrageous.

43
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,110
(woman laughs)

44
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,984
Wait till you see
what Alice is wearing.

45
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,759
I didn't want to bring you.

46
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,399
Ronnie: I didn't want to come.

47
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,128
(dance music playing )

48
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,976
(laughing)

49
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,682
. Every day...

50
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,082
- Hey, guys!
- Girl: I can do it!

51
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,586
Can anyone do a cannonball?

52
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,782
Anyone?

53
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,850
. I can't wait to take you
far away.

54
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,329
. Don't you know...

55
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,390
Girls: Yay!

56
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,549
Woman: I wonder what that is?

57
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,127
And that with your suit!

58
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,468
- Girl: So cute!
- Oh, my God!

59
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,030
Oh, cool.

60
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,303
- Girl: So pretty.
- Birthday girl: Thanks.

61
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,902
Oh, my God.

62
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,938
Penelope, your mother
has such great taste.

63
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,143
Oh, let me see that.

64
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,345
Who's this from?

65
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,683
Birthday girl: Oh, my God,
I wonder what it is.

66
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,986
- It's just a book.
- Girl: God, you just told her.

67
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,458
Woman:
It's okay, we like books.

68
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,757
Girls: No, we don't.

69
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,262
- ( Girls giggling)
- Thanks, Alice.

70
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,094
Well, you should thank my mom.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,565
Girl: She's so weird.

72
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,090
Woman:
Well, looks like that's it, honey.

73
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,160
Girl: That girl has a present.

74
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,467
. We'll fly away...

75
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,634
Ronnie:
No, don't give it to her.

76
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,735
- Here, Mary.
- Thanks.

77
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,109
- . Can you feel.
- . Can you feel...

78
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,410
. I'm for real.
. I'm for real...

79
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,710
Woman: That's...

80
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:09,379
Thanks, she's... cute.

81
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,614
You're just a stupid bitch.

82
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,325
You don't have to pretend
like you like it.

83
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,062
Woman: Excuse me,
we don't say that word.

84
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,395
- Alice: Ronnie-l.
- Hey, I'm talking to you.

85
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,662
Can't you hear me? Wait!
( gasps )

86
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,691
Woman: Oh, my God!

87
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,101
Mary: You hit my mom!

88
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,436
Ronnie, no. What are you doing?

89
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,909
I think this party is over for you two.
Why don't you get your things?

90
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,412
Girl: What's wrong with her?

91
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,540
( Mutters )
Why do I have to leave?

92
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,609
- Go.
- Alice: Why do I have to leave?

93
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:49,453
(girls whispering )

94
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,612
- Girl: Who even invited her?
- Girl #2: I don't know.

95
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,257
(baby crying)

96
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,101
(crying continues)

97
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,882
Ronnie!

98
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,445
Ronnie...!

99
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,021
( Cooing )

100
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,732
( knocking )

101
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,802
( knocking )

102
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,688
What everyone was doing
was just pissing me off.

103
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,492
Always looking down
on other people,

104
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,521
judging everyone,
but she literally...

105
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,398
Woman: You want some breakfast?

106
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,300
Alice, you should have
some breakfast.

107
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,829
What? No, thanks.

108
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,105
Hey, just say the word
and we can paint this room.

109
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,976
It might even be fun.

110
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,448
I ran into Ronnie Fuller's mother
at the ATM.

111
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,041
She said Ronnie got a job.

112
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,644
What are you watching?

113
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,384
That one? She's the meanest.

114
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,392
She thinks she's better
than everyone else.

115
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,189
- You're being ridiculous. No.
- Man on TV: I'm being ridiculous?

116
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,250
Yeah, you're being ridiculous.

117
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:48,857
Woman: Okay, let's get
this day started, shall we?

118
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,095
What are you going to do today?

119
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,125
Look for a job.

120
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,238
- See you later.
- Bye.

121
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,405
Alice: "Dear producers",

122
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,144
All the time
I see new television shows,

123
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,742
"but I like yours the best."

124
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,650
(alarm blares)

125
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,212
"I have an idea for a show
that maybe you would like"

126
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,190
about people
who have been in jail

127
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,250
or gotten in trouble
for doing something bad,

128
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,558
but they're actually innocent.

129
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,832
I know I don't look
like most people on TV,

130
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,067
but I am on a diet
and exercising every day.

131
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,033
And I think people will be
interested in my story.

132
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,804
I am only 13,

133
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,216
but I spent a long time in jail
for a crime I did not commit.

134
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,680
If people saw me on television,

135
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,885
they would realize
that underneath it all,

136
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,951
I am just like everyone else.

137
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,432
I think this show would be
educational and popular.

138
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,369
And maybe it would help everyone
figure out the truth

139
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,431
"about what actually
happened to me."

140
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,582
Woman: Let's see,
I'll have three onion.

141
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,607
Oh, and two rolls.

142
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,884
You know what?
Since you're about to close,

143
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,517
can I get 14
for the price of a dozen?

144
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,795
Sorry, my manager says no.

145
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,798
But you're just gonna
throw them away.

146
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,824
I mean,
I come here all the time.

147
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,200
Sure thing. You can have 14.

148
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,397
Woman: Great.

149
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,068
So the rest will be... everything.

150
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,744
Woman: Oh, you know what?
I don't have any cash.

151
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,249
Can I write you a check?

152
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,719
- Manager: Certainly.
- Great.

153
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,744
( Music playing )

154
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,780
( softly ) Liar.

155
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,920
- Excuse me?
- What?

156
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,726
You know what?

157
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,395
I'm gonna need
some cash back, too.

158
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,235
Manager: How much
are you gonna need?

159
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,262
A hundred.

160
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,242
Manager: Of course, ma'am.

161
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,973
( Register beeps )

162
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,981
Thanks.

163
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:24,415
- ( Doorbell jingles)
- Ronnie, you're killin' me here.

164
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,323
You can take off.

165
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,759
Thanks, Clarice.

166
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,198
- Girl: Maybe it's because of the table.
- Kayla, art is for making a mess.

167
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,670
Don't be so scared.
Don't be so afraid.

168
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,195
Kayla: Uh-huh.

169
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:49,577
Art is not for conforming,
art is for creating, right?

170
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:55,050
Uh, hey, Ms. Manning,
can I see you for a second?

171
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,850
Ms. Manning: Uh, just a moment.

172
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,050
All right, you go ahead.

173
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,185
I'll be right back.
All right, yeah.

174
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,855
Woman: Kayla's afraid to draw
in a goddamn coloring book.

175
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:09,458
She's afraid she's no good
if she doesn't impress you.

176
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,731
Excuse me... Mrs. West?

177
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,467
I teach children to be original,

178
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:20,204
to express themselves
uniquely, independently...

179
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,508
She's eight. Who gives a shit?

180
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,974
I do.

181
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,542
I'm trying to give her
an art education.

182
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,554
Regardless of whether or not
that is something

183
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,613
that you can understand
or appreciate.

184
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,556
I want what's good for my kid.

185
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,026
And if she wants to draw
in a fucking coloring book

186
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,359
for the rest of her life,
that's okay with me.

187
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,592
- Please. Language.
- Well, then, I feel sorry

188
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,531
for your little girl.

189
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,366
You feel sorry
for my little girl?

190
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,706
Manning: So tell me a little bit
about your job searching.

191
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,509
I tried. I looked a long time.

192
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,074
I was at the mall,
asking in clothing stores.

193
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,052
Those jobs are hard to get.

194
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,784
I don't see why you don't try
for one of those fast-food places.

195
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:11,318
I'd rather not work
in a fast-food place if I don't have to.

196
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,661
Alice: I don't believe
in what they're doing.

197
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,496
I don't.

198
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,799
You won't even eat
at those places.

199
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,033
Manning: A person has to work.

200
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,144
So, where did you apply?

201
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,276
Alice: Food Emporium,
and Contempo.

202
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,115
I mean, it's called
"Wet Seal" now.

203
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,213
Those are union.
Don't waste your time.

204
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:43,125
Food Emporium is, but I didn't
find that out until I got there.

205
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,128
Not Wet Seal.

206
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,761
They don't want a girl
like me anyway.

207
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,837
Something will come through.

208
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,492
Manning:
That's beautiful, honey.

209
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,162
Can I see?

210
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,630
Who wants a sip of mine?

211
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,267
Ronnie: Me!

212
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,172
Yum!

213
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,443
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

214
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,644
Alice?

215
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,178
No, thank you.

216
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,848
It's illegal.

217
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,654
Alice Manning, the police
might come and get you

218
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,524
if you have a sip.

219
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,222
I'll protect you.

220
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,721
( Imitates police sirens )
Whoo-oo!

221
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,536
Ronnie, this is beautiful.

222
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:08,033
It's so powerful
and dark and interesting.

223
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,445
You're really talented,
you know that?

224
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,574
- Will you sign it for me?
- Ronnie: Mm-hmm.

225
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,174
Manning: Yeah?

226
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,379
( Water splashing )

227
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,789
( rustling )

228
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,235
What about this one?

229
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,401
Comfy.

230
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,842
That leather one over there,
that's the shit.

231
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,777
We are not getting
a leather couch.

232
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,712
How you gonna tell me
we ain't getting a leather couch?

233
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,273
Look at that shit.
That shit is fly.

234
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,286
- Man: That's why we ain't got company.
- Woman: It's too soft?

235
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,413
Salesman:
You guys getting closer?

236
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,980
- Yes, we are.
- Not... not with that one. No.

237
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,617
- Woman: I like this one.
- Salesman: That's chintz.

238
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,785
It's our new line.

239
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:00,160
A "bitch"?
That's "bitch." It ain't chintz.

240
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,946
- Man: The leather, yeah, that's...
- Salesman: Okay, all right. Sure.

241
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,798
- What's up with this?
- I ain't getting a leather couch.

242
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,996
What's up with that?
You can give me a price on that?

243
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,028
Woman: Devlin, I ain't
getting no leather couch.

244
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,268
- This is how I can kick back.
- Salesman: You like with the feet up?

245
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,276
Yeah, kick back,
watch the game and shit.

246
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,643
- Salesman: I hear you.
- This is how we should be living.

247
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,477
- Woman: Brittany?
- Salesman: It may have to be this one.

248
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,883
- Man: What's it... $649?
- Hey, baby, where did Brittany go?

249
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,580
Salesman: That's for
the second half of the couch.

250
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,885
But what we could do,
what we could do...

251
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,618
Brittany?

252
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,717
Devlin: She probably jumping
on some bed somewhere,

253
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,819
doing something
she ain't supposed to.

254
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,193
Brittany...?

255
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,562
- Brittany?
- Salesman: I like to conjugate, too.

256
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,762
- You know?
- Devlin: Yeah.

257
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,669
Answer me.

258
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,294
- Devlin, help me.
- Devlin: I like this.

259
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,707
Hold up.

260
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:47,768
- Brit!
- Salesman: You all right?

261
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,905
Brit-Brit! Hold on, hold on
one second-my daughter.

262
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,256
My daughter around here
somewhere.

263
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,874
- Maveen? Brit!
- Salesman: All right.

264
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,975
Ma'am, is there something
I can help...

265
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,713
Have you seen a little girl?
She's just three years old.

266
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,982
She runs off sometimes,
but never for this long.

267
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,081
Um... she's not answering me.

268
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,614
- Saleswoman: It's okay.
- Brit, I know you hear me.

269
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,126
Saleswoman:
Don't you worry. Let's look.

270
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,821
- Okay.
- Saleswoman: Brittany!

271
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,852
Now, Brit, you gonna be in trouble
if you don't come out!

272
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,195
Brittany,
don't hide from Mommy!

273
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,996
Saleswoman:
No one left the store.

274
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,696
Oh, my God!

275
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:13,725
- Brit-Brit...
- Maveen: Oh, my God!

276
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,863
Oh, calm down.
She just hiding from you.

277
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,930
- Brittany!
- Saleswoman: It's okay, it's okay.

278
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,169
Brittany, I know you hear me.
Come on, girl!

279
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,178
- Shit!
- Devlin: Brittany!

280
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,841
Brittany? Fuck!

281
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,118
I'm sorry I'm late.

282
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,213
I had to take my mom
to the doctor, and it took forever.

283
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,644
Clarice:
I thought you didn't drive.

284
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,558
We took the bus.

285
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,085
She wanted my company.

286
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,099
Why couldn't your dad take her?

287
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,623
Clarice: Listen...

288
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,034
You got some of that Red Bull?

289
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,509
Uh, yeah, I can.

290
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,138
My dad's truck is full of them.
He'll never notice.

291
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,011
Thanks.

292
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,644
- How's she doing?
- Huh?

293
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:06,121
- Your mom.
- Oh, uh, not good.

294
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,087
(door alarm beeps)

295
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,840
(truck motor humming)

296
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,526
(faint TV playing )

297
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,730
Maveen:
You're gonna find my baby, right?

298
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,932
Man: We'll find her.

299
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,669
You have my word on that, okay?

300
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,973
You got kids?

301
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,309
Two daughters...

302
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:07,147
13 and three months.

303
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,518
I only turned around
for a minute, I swear.

304
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,990
A minute is a long time.

305
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,459
I didn't think...
there were people around.

306
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,723
It was a nice store.

307
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,789
Devlin: She always running off
when she sees something she like...

308
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,324
want us to buy for her.

309
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,868
And you are...?

310
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,477
- This your husband?
- Boyfriend.

311
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,847
Of course.

312
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,977
You the baby daddy?

313
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,284
Maveen: She calls him Daddy.

314
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,722
He's here. Her daddy ain't.

315
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,625
- Detective: And the biological father?
- I don't know.

316
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,562
I don't care.
And neither does he.

317
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,564
You got a job, boyfriend?

318
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,196
Or you just "chillin"?

319
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,001
Why are you asking him
these questions?

320
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,336
I know why he asking
the questions.

321
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,671
Where were you
when Brittany went missing?

322
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,473
- He was with me.
- I'm not asking you.

323
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,173
I'm asking him.

324
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,515
Where were you
when Brittany went missing?

325
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,315
Detective:
Do I need to ask you again?

326
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,687
Nigga, do your job
and find our little girl.

327
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,855
Devlin:
You come here to harass me?

328
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,529
Are you going to answer
my question?

329
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,329
Devlin:
Do your motherfuckin' job, nigga.

330
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,460
Detective: Where were you
when Brittany went missing?

331
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,402
- Don't come askin' me...
- I'm only gonna ask you one more time.

332
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,430
Nah, man, you ain't gotta ask me
no questions like that.

333
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,601
Detective: Where were you
when Brittany went missing?

334
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,975
- Why don't you do your job?
- You didn't answer my question.

335
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,241
- Female detective: Okay.
- Devlin: Are you going to do your job?

336
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,876
That's what we're trying
to do, Mister...?

337
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,612
- Devlin: Smith.
- Mr. Smith.

338
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,927
We want to find your daughter.

339
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,659
- Okay?
- Yeah.

340
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,861
Female detective:
What the hell was that?

341
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,034
Huh, Jones?

342
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,236
You know, even good parents
could lose their kids.

343
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,339
Jones:
They aren't good parents.

344
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,585
Man: Every fucking time
I walk in here!

345
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,752
Woman: Yeah...

346
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,228
(faint yelling)

347
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,869
(crickets chirping)

348
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,874
Manning:
You said you'd be home for dinner.

349
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,279
I am home.

350
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,944
It's after 3:00.
Where have you been?

351
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,715
I was walking.

352
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,958
- Alice: I'm starving.
- I didn't wait for you.

353
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:06,190
That's okay. ( Sighs )

354
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,198
What's in there?

355
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,860
A bunch of stuff.
Olives, cheese.

356
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,699
- I hate olives.
- Oh.

357
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,762
What's this?

358
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,172
That's a walnut.

359
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,107
Surely you've seen
a walnut, Alice.

360
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,172
- ( Chuckles )
- It's good.

361
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:24,180
Sorry, sometimes I just think
you were switched at the hospital.

362
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,751
You know, my horoscope today
said that "all eyes would be on me."

363
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,519
And then I'll find something
I misplaced.

364
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:37,789
Helen: Did you find a job?
( chuckles )

365
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,956
- Not yet.
- Hmm.

366
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,897
Did you find a boyfriend?

367
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,197
What? Excuse me?

368
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,294
You were reading the personals.

369
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,498
Oh, well, they're hilarious.

370
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,269
And tragic.

371
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,709
Why don't you take a look
at the want ads?

372
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,373
Why don't you have
a boyfriend, Mom?

373
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:02,180
I mean, I would have figured
you'd found somebody by now.

374
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,524
- ( Phone ringing )
- Jones.

375
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,424
Porter: How was my brother?

376
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,020
- I... I know.
- ( Snapping fingers)

377
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,553
- There's no way.
- Jones: Mm-hmm.

378
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,860
- You should not wait up.
- Jones: Yeah.

379
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,630
And don't watch crap TV
and fall asleep on the couch.

380
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,537
- All right. Hey.
- You wouldn't want to catch...

381
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,508
They found something
at the mall.

382
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,770
- I gotta go.
- Come on.

383
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,072
- Yes. Don't wait up.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

384
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,272
Do not wait up.

385
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,708
Man: Right over here.

386
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,777
( Police radio chatter)

387
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,052
A hundred yards
from the furniture store.

388
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,822
Jones:
Similar photos have been taken?

389
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,959
Man: Pictures all around.

390
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,799
- ( Police radio chatter)
- Jones: I want a full dust.

391
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,998
Mm-hmm.

392
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,939
Jones: We got blood.

393
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,883
I'm gonna need this place wiped.

394
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,377
Okay?

395
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,618
Let's bag it.

396
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,299
I need a minute.

397
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,635
( Panting )

398
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,232
(faint creaking)

399
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:43,235
( man sighs)

400
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,974
You should come to bed.

401
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,419
It's 4:00 a.m., Nance.

402
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,887
Which means
it's 16 and a half hours...

403
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:01,523
since a three-year-old
went missing.

404
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:05,399
Right, missing kid.
You don't do missing kid cases.

405
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,363
Nancy:
I thought I could handle it.

406
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,188
( Hawk screeches )

407
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:31,453
Nancy: It's like a fort.

408
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,963
In high school, everybody
came up here to smoke cigarettes.

409
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,329
I didn't remember it
being this far.

410
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,664
Man: You smoke cigarettes?

411
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,136
I was the lookout. ( Chuckles )

412
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:50,310
It's up here.

413
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,780
This is not
part of the grid, Porter.

414
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:55,876
If we find this baby first,
where does that put us?

415
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,909
Partner: Gotta follow
chain of command.

416
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,115
See down in there?

417
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,425
Come on.

418
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,626
See?

419
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,661
In here.

420
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,609
- ( Flies buzzing )
- ( Partner coughing )

421
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,774
( gasps )

422
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,505
( clattering )

423
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:58,378
(sobbing ) Oh, God...

424
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,615
( police radio chatter)

425
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:07,885
Partner: "sector R8-26."

426
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,586
We are near
the south end of the sewer line

427
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,061
by the old bunker
near the river.

428
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,325
We need backup
and an ambulance.

429
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,860
( Sobbing )

430
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,535
Nance?

431
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,060
(birds chirping)

432
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,871
Woman: Roz, you haven't
eaten your breakfast.

433
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:55,894
(child laughs)

434
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,463
Woman on TV:
I really don't have any words...

435
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,372
Come on.

436
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,868
(TV continues)
We were just shopping for a new sofa.

437
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,882
Like a second, I turned around
and then, she was just like...

438
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,544
Hey, baby. How are you?
Good morning.

439
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,746
Daddy!

440
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,655
Reporter: Urged to contact
the police department

441
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,623
at 3-34..

442
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,058
Look, Mama, me!

443
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,755
Oh, honey,
that's... that's not you.

444
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,527
Let's turn this off right now.

445
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,596
Rosalind: Oops.

446
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,403
( Rosalind cooing )

447
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,541
The birth father was in Ossining
when it happened.

448
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:45,020
It wasn't him. B&E, 10 years,
possibility of parole.

449
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,985
Went back to Paradise Furniture,
talked to the manager.

450
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,015
- And?
- There's nothing new.

451
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,655
But he did say that
the boyfriend, Devlin Smith,

452
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,656
was "acting like an asshole."

453
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,403
His words, not mine.

454
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:12,379
Jesus, what is she doing here?

455
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,644
Who is that?

456
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,845
They're home, you know.

457
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,684
They've been home
for two weeks.

458
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,657
They're back living not even three miles
from where this happened.

459
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,125
Who? Who's home?

460
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,754
Ronnie Fuller
and Alice Manning.

461
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,623
Cynthia: That little girl has only
been missing one night.

462
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,431
It's possible she's still okay.

463
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,597
These disappearances,
they're very different.

464
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:39,404
Your daughter was an infant,
this girl is a toddler.

465
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,139
Your baby was taken on impulse.
And this, this seems to be...

466
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,671
She is a three-year-old biracial child
with short, curly black hair.

467
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,878
<i>Brittany Lyme is, 'm fact,
a dead finger h)! My daughter.</i>

468
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,047
And maybe she wouldn't be
sitting here right now

469
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,113
if these girls were smarter.

470
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,419
Nancy: Have they contacted you?

471
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,084
Have they threatened
your family in any way?

472
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,721
They've taken a child
thinking it's mine.

473
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,527
Why are you still sitting here
asking me questions?

474
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,864
Mrs. Barnes, we understand
your concerns.

475
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,632
And they'll be taken
very seriously.

476
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,939
I won't hold my breath.

477
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,776
Why didn't I know
about this connection?

478
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,479
What connection?

479
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,751
She wants it to be them,
doesn't mean it is.

480
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,349
Okay. We're gonna follow it up?

481
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,592
( Gate clatters )

482
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,132
Nancy: Brother.

483
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:48,805
Dave!

484
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,546
Jones: Dave Fuller?

485
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,813
Why is it so obvious
you're cops?

486
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,780
I didn't know better,
I'd think you were

487
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,883
boosting merchandise
off that work truck.

488
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,592
Jones: Relax, we're not here
to bust your balls.

489
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,928
I wanna talk
to your daughter, Ronnie.

490
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,195
Dave:
What did she do this time?

491
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,998
She didn't do nothin'.

492
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,197
Dave: Shut up.

493
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:19,299
You know where
we might find her?

494
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,176
Uh, she's working
at this bagel place.

495
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:26,546
Nancy: Out by the mall?

496
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,609
(doorbell jingles)

497
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,315
Clarice: Hi there. Can I help you
with something?

498
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,548
Ronnie Fuller?

499
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,057
Yeah?

500
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:43,622
I'm Detective Porter.
This is Detective Jones.

501
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,792
Is something wrong?

502
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,701
Nancy: We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

503
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:51,036
Okay. I'll meet you out front.

504
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,474
Nancy: Okay.

505
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,308
Clarice:
Ls everything all right?

506
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,647
She working on Monday?

507
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,414
Clarice: Yeah.
She works every day.

508
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,448
When's her shift start?

509
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,789
It depends on the day.

510
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:14,126
Most of the time, mid morning.

511
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,795
Shit!

512
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,385
Jones: Humph.

513
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,391
- Looks like we got our first suspect.
- God damn it.

514
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,484
( Knocking on door)

515
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,121
- Woman: Who is it?
- Metro Police!

516
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,599
- Helen Manning?
- Yeah.

517
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,500
I'm Detective Jones,
this is Detective Porter.

518
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:58,029
- May we come in?
- Why do you need to come in?

519
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,871
We're looking
for your daughter.

520
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,673
Alice. Alice Manning.

521
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,146
Well, Alice isn't here.

522
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,843
( Loudly ) Alice?

523
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,284
Nope.

524
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,219
You have any idea where
we might find her?

525
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,588
She's 13, I don't always
know where she goes.

526
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,093
She's probably out walking.

527
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,825
- Jones: Walking?
- She walks a lot.

528
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,992
You just have her call us
when she gets in.

529
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,127
- Thank you very much.
- Helen: I will pass the message on.

530
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,764
Mrs. Manning...?

531
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,172
Uh, you know what time
she got back last night?

532
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,870
Late. We were supposed
to have dinner together,

533
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,503
but she showed up late.

534
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,242
- Out walking?
- Mm-hmm.

535
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,750
Nancy: Thank you for your time.

536
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:48,047
Police dispatcher:
One-William-four-five.

537
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,683
Nancy: 10-3, it's Porter.

538
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,251
Dispatcher: We checked in
with Ronnie Fuller's parents.

539
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,643
There's no sign of her since
she left for work this morning.

540
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,829
Thanks.

541
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:02,702
Oh, okay.

542
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,866
(crickets chirping)

543
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,585
Helen: Where were you?

544
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,883
Walking.

545
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,522
Two detectives
came by here today...

546
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:27,393
looking for you.

547
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:32,366
Alice, please... tell me you didn't
do anything this time.

548
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,169
I didn't do anything last time.

549
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,405
Can you prove it?

550
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,310
Let's go talk to them.

551
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,455
( Voices overlapping )

552
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,886
Nancy: You know why
we wanted to talk to you today?

553
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,994
Because of my past.

554
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,729
Why don't you tell me
where you were yesterday?

555
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,140
Well, I was walking.

556
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,111
- Nancy: Mm-hmm.
- I'm trying to lose a little weight.

557
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,204
Walking where? For how long?

558
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:22,309
I started out on Main Street,
and I put in an application at Arby's.

559
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,685
I don't want to work there,
but my mom said

560
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,690
that I can't afford to be picky.

561
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:32,457
It's not so bad.
I did it myself.

562
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,724
You don't look like you
had to work in a place like that.

563
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,528
You could be a model.

564
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:43,536
So we go to Arby's, there'll be
a record of your application?

565
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,404
I guess so.

566
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,842
I mean, the girl who took it
seemed a little spacey, but...

567
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,436
Arby's, that's near, uh...

568
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,277
Jones: Paradise Furniture.

569
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,011
Paradise Furniture?

570
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,782
Nancy: There's a little girl missing
from Paradise Furniture.

571
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,585
Oh. I know. My mom told me.

572
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,785
I saw it on the news.

573
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,698
Nancy: You know anything at all

574
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,862
about this missing child?

575
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,782
I know something
I'm not supposed to know.

576
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,411
Because I broke a rule.

577
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,580
Nancy: What rule?

578
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,756
When I was little,
I used to go to the pharmacy

579
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,159
and get these
chocolate-covered peanuts.

580
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:43,188
But when I got out of Schechter,
the pharmacy was gone,

581
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,598
so I've been trying
to find ones that are as good

582
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:49,696
or maybe even the same kind,
but I haven't yet.

583
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:55,809
But anyway, I left because
I didn't want her to see me.

584
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,676
Nancy: Who?

585
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,217
Alice: Ronnie Fuller.

586
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,413
I saw her standing
outside of Gino's Bagels.

587
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,955
She seemed really nervous.

588
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,750
And she kept looking around her

589
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:15,696
like she was afraid
someone was watching her.

590
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:22,103
Well, Alice...
you were watching her.

591
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,107
Yeah, but she didn't know that.

592
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,576
I just thought that if I told you
where she worked,

593
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,078
that would be helpful.

594
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:38,111
Do you know anything
about Brittany Lyttle?

595
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:41,749
The three-year-old
that's missing.

596
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,385
I was hoping you
could provide insight.

597
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:50,362
When Olivia Barnes went missing,
what was going through your mind?

598
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,231
What were you
and Ronnie thinking

599
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,328
when you and Ronnie took her
from her house?

600
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,569
How would that
give you insight?

601
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:06,343
I mean, unless I did
what happened now.

602
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,783
You could help me understand
the mind of a person

603
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,447
who could take a child.

604
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,456
That could help me
solve this case.

605
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,583
You could help me.

606
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,925
You and Ronnie were friends,
you were at a birthday party

607
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,624
having fun, right?

608
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,866
(children laughing)

609
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,892
Nancy:
Walk me through that day.

610
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,037
Alice: Ronnie! Ronnie!
What are you doing?

611
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,135
Hello?

612
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,807
( Knocking )

613
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,976
- Hello?
- Ronnie!

614
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,548
( Baby coos )

615
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:00,827
I told Ronnie
we should leave it.

616
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,867
Alice: Ronnie!
What are you doing?

617
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,739
Why are you
not listening to me?

618
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,406
Are you crazy?

619
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,690
You're in so much trouble!

620
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,661
She's my baby now.

621
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,721
Ronnie: She needs me.

622
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:31,528
No, she doesn't.
She needs her mother.

623
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,229
Her mother doesn't love her.

624
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,574
I do.

625
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:45,372
I didn't even want it.

626
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,473
And I didn't kill it.

627
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,543
- ( Baby crying)
- Ronnie did.

628
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,455
I don't know why she did it.

629
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:58,119
- ( Baby crying)
- I wasn't even there when it happened.

630
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,186
I wasn't even there.

631
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,061
(laughing)

632
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,930
Alice:
Maybe if I had been there,

633
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:08,095
I could have stopped her.

634
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,436
But I wasn't.

635
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,136
I wasn't even there.

636
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,509
You went to juvenile hall
for the same crime as Ronnie Fuller.

637
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,881
Alice: That's right.

638
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,546
And it wasn't fair.

639
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:28,489
Just because she's skinny and pretty
doesn't mean that she's not bad.

640
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,753
But you won't believe me.

641
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,819
Because no one
ever believes the fat girl.

642
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,263
Especially someone like you.

643
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:44,068
If Ronnie wanted to run away...
hide somewhere...

644
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,199
where would she go?

645
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,471
I don't know.

646
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,070
I haven't even talked to her
for seven years.

647
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,945
Where were you
last night, Alice?

648
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,474
- Excuse me.
- I'd like to take Alice home.

649
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:57,850
- Where were you last night, Alice?
- Helen: Now.

650
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,183
Helen: She was with me.

651
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,815
You said she got home late.

652
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,155
What do you consider
to be late, Detective?

653
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,717
- Alice?
- Nancy: Before you go,

654
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,160
there's one last thing
you can do.

655
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,460
Because I know you want
to be helpful.

656
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:10,965
We just need a sample
of your blood.

657
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,695
Helen: Why?

658
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,634
Nancy:
I want to rule you out as a suspect.

659
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:17,002
You don't need
your mom's consent.

660
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,529
You're 13 now, Alice.

661
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:25,305
- Helen: Come on, Alice, let's go home.
- You can really help us.

662
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:29,011
Come on, Alice, we're going home.
Now. Let's go.

663
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,217
( Door closes )

664
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,229
Jones: You believe her?

665
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:46,029
Nancy: I don't know.

666
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,129
Alice's voice:
I wasn't even there.

667
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,130
Alice's voice:
I wasn't even there.

668
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:41,917
- Paul: Where you going?
- I gotta work.

669
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:44,186
It's late, Nance.
Come to bed, please.

670
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,750
You can take care of it
in the morning.

671
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:49,094
It's a missing kid, Paul.
Jesus.

672
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:53,394
I don't want to go through
this shit again, Nance.

673
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:00,475
(car door alarm beeping )

674
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,604
( beeping stops )

675
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,209
(crickets chirping)

676
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,144
(sighs)

677
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,358
( Nancy gasps )

678
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,403
Are you gonna cuff me?

679
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,078
( Rain pattering )

680
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,472
(car door alarm beeps)

681
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:21,845
(sighs)

682
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,828
- Where's Brittany Lyttle?
- Ronnie: Who?

683
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,963
Nancy: The girl that was taken
from Paradise Furniture.

684
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,736
There was a girl taken
from Paradise Furniture?

685
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,070
Come on, Ronnie.

686
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:42,270
If you didn't know a girl was missing,
why did you run away?

687
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,336
Ronnie: I knew you were cops.

688
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:47,315
You're the cop...

689
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:51,148
who found the baby.

690
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,047
Your hair is the same.

691
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,251
Nancy:
How did you know what I look like?

692
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,955
I saw you on television.

693
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,589
Getting some kind of reward.

694
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,759
Nancy: An award.

695
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,791
It wasn't a reward, it was...

696
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,267
I just got promoted.

697
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,440
For finding Olivia Barnes?

698
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,540
Yeah.

699
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,716
(sighs)

700
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:32,658
Why did you take Olivia Barnes,
Ronnie?

701
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,596
( Baby's voice crying )

702
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:40,468
Ronnie: She was crying.

703
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,993
I couldn't leave her like that.

704
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,530
Alice: Ronnie!

705
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,403
You're in so much trouble.

706
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,242
She's my baby now.

707
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,853
She is kinda cute.

708
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:11,257
Hi, baby!

709
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:15,499
All right. We can keep her.

710
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,900
(Olivia coughs)

711
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,347
(Olivia cooing )

712
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,288
Ronnie: Can I hold her now?

713
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:37,087
She likes to be bounced.

714
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,060
It calms her.

715
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:43,053
I know about babies.
My mom's a teacher.

716
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,862
Ronnie:
When do I get to hold her?

717
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:48,529
She doesn't like
to be passed around.

718
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:51,903
Alice: That's right, little girl.
Mommy's here.

719
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,240
"Daddy's" going to get you
some food.

720
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,144
Just the pudding,
that's all I can get.

721
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:00,170
Alice: Go make her a bed.

722
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,346
(Olivia coughing )

723
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,489
Ronnie:
Are you sure we can leave her?

724
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:22,800
- We have to go home.
- ( Olivia crying )

725
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,832
Alice: We'll be back tomorrow.
We promise.

726
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,415
(Olivia crying )

727
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,474
(sighs)

728
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,079
Nancy: So Alice lied.

729
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,486
She was there.

730
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,887
Let me ask you something.

731
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,228
Why pudding?

732
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:52,961
I could never figure that out.

733
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,937
If you could buy pudding,
you could buy baby food.

734
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:58,098
Ronnie:
We couldn't buy anything.

735
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,507
I just took those
from my dad's truck.

736
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,067
It was full of them.

737
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,943
(Olivia grunts)

738
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:08,506
They made her sick, though.
I'm pretty sure.

739
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:11,883
Younger Ronnie:
What's wrong with her?

740
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,548
Why won't she eat it?

741
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,285
(Olivia groans)

742
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:19,089
- It's pudding.
- She can't take bites.

743
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:22,290
Ronnie: Come on, girl.

744
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,799
It's just getting
all over her mouth.

745
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,801
Alice: Eat the pudding, please.
Eat the pudding.

746
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:29,235
- Please.
- What do we do, Ronnie?

747
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,170
Eat the pudding.

748
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,232
Nancy: Why didn't you
take her to a doctor?

749
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:37,006
We knew we would
get into trouble.

750
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,549
We saw the stuff on the news
about her being missing

751
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,279
and Alice said
that bringing her back

752
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,583
would only make it worse.

753
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,254
Nancy: That's why you did
what you did?

754
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:55,696
Ronnie: Alice said she'd
put all of the blame on me if I didn't.

755
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:00,591
Younger Ronnie:
I think she's really sick.

756
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,803
Maybe dying-

757
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:09,140
We should just take her back.

758
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:12,409
Or call someone
and tell them where she is.

759
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:15,144
Alice: You can't call someone.

760
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,482
They'll take you to jail.

761
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,384
You did this, Ronnie.

762
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,411
Not me.

763
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,119
( Rain pattering )

764
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,497
Alice's mom was my friend.

765
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,524
Not Alice.

766
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,929
She didn't like that.

767
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:53,045
Nancy:
Can I ask you one more thing?

768
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:54,419
Okay.

769
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,485
How'd the jack-in-the-box
get there?

770
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,830
I put it there.

771
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,603
(sighs)

772
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:29,652
(engine stops)

773
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,937
Jones: Ronnie.

774
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,635
Ronnie!

775
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,873
(mug clinking)

776
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,682
I think she was glad
to be found.

777
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:05,516
Something"; Not right here.

778
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,963
Jones:
We need to get their files.

779
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,662
See what happened
when they were away.

780
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,947
Cynthia: You go make some more.
Make some more.

781
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,846
And I'll feed you
when you make it, okay?

782
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,579
- Okay.
- I'll be over there in a second.

783
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,581
- Maveen: Are you comfortable?
- Yeah.

784
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,857
I know that couch is real old.

785
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,392
We were shopping for a new one
when it happened.

786
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:48,926
Cynthia:
You can't blame yourself.

787
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:52,532
- Maveen: How can you not?
- I don't know.

788
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,505
My daughter was
with her babysitter.

789
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,069
Then it wasn't your fault.

790
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:01,207
- Cynthia: If I hadn't been working...
- Well, you had to work.

791
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:05,118
No. Not really.

792
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:06,916
I chose to.

793
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,684
Maveen: Well...

794
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:13,388
I told the police I only
looked away for a second.

795
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,727
But it was longer.

796
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,790
It was a lot longer
than a second.

797
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:21,632
Cynthia:
This is not your fault.

798
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:25,731
We just-we never think
that this will happen to us.

799
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,175
( Footsteps creaking )

800
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,910
You from TV?

801
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,782
Cynthia: I'm visiting.

802
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:40,515
Maveen:
Cynthia here lost a child.

803
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:44,013
She came here for a visit,
to help me.

804
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:47,619
- Is your child still lost?
- Maveen: Devlin.

805
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:51,428
Devlin: I'm just asking
if her child lost, if she gonna help us.

806
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,661
My first child is dead.

807
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:58,529
So how is that supposed
to make Maveen feel better?

808
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:00,973
Huh?

809
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:12,680
Cynthia: I'm sorry.

810
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,179
I'm sorry.

811
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,250
Cynthia: Rosalind.
Let's go. Come on, Roz.

812
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:20,192
Toy down, let's go.
It's time to go.

813
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:23,026
Put the toy down, let's go.
Come on.

814
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:25,090
Let's clean it up.

815
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:29,263
My bad, I ain't...
I ain't mean it like that.

816
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:34,173
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

817
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:42,414
She can't take that toy.
That's Brittany's.

818
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,822
Sorry.

819
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,452
Cynthia: Okay, let's go.

820
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:10,000
You always sleep like that?

821
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:15,272
Some things are easier
if you can sleep through them.

822
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,354
Can I go now?

823
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,758
You said I wasn't under arrest.

824
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:32,328
- You're up.
- Yeah.

825
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,697
(sighs)

826
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,108
Have you seen this little girl?

827
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:50,042
She's cute.

828
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:53,314
She looks like Alice.

829
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,347
Nancy: Like Alice?

830
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,559
How? How does a biracial
three-year-old

831
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,857
with dark hair
look like Alice Manning?

832
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,364
I don't know.

833
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:05,559
I don't know why I said that.
It just popped out.

834
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,625
When was the last time
you saw her, Ronnie?

835
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:10,729
- Alice.
- I don't see Alice.

836
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:14,773
If you want
to rule yourself out,

837
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:17,108
then maybe you can
give us a blood sample?

838
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:22,582
You want me
to give you my blood?

839
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,711
If you didn't do it,
you can prove it.

840
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:27,517
- No.
- Nancy: Then you can go.

841
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,182
It's simple,
we just prick your finger.

842
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,886
No. No.

843
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,025
Ronnie.

844
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,829
Help us. Help yourself.

845
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:44,604
Ronnie: Nobody cuts me.

846
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:55,373
Yes, ma'am.
But what I need you to understand

847
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,646
is that we need
those files here... today.

848
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:59,176
Yeah, hold on.

849
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:01,985
All the files from County
were sent upstate.

850
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,718
What? Why?

851
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:06,317
Jones: Apparently,
they ran out of room.

852
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,260
Just get them.
Tell them, "Get them."

853
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:10,457
Jones: They're saying there are
like, 20 years' worth of files.

854
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,467
They can get someone
to help us with them,

855
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,527
but they're not guaranteeing
they will be complete.

856
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:20,237
This is Detective Nancy Porter.

857
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:23,608
Let me be clear.
A child is missing.

858
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,738
A three-year-old...
for two days,

859
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:27,543
and I want to find her
while she's still alive,

860
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,914
and you are going to help me.
You're gonna find your files,

861
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,215
and when you send them,
they will be complete.

862
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,745
Do your job.

863
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,881
Umph.

864
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,754
(birds chirping)

865
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,469
Alice's voice: "My mom always says,
'Never give up."

866
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:26,440
But it feels like
she's given up on me.

867
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,874
Sometimes I wonder,
'What did I do

868
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,572
to make her not like me?

869
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:37,013
Maybe it's my dad.

870
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,783
She says he was
the 'biggest mistake of her life.

871
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,626
She says he was fat, too.

872
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,758
When she looks at me,
does she see him?

873
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:52,027
(children laughing)

874
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:57,163
When I was younger,
I thought if I did everything right,

875
00:59:57,193 --> 01:00:00,003
I would fit in
with all the other girls,

876
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:04,034
but I don't think
she even notices me trying.

877
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:06,513
She wishes
she had a different daughter.

878
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:11,381
I'm gonna love my baby so much.

879
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,387
I'll let her eat
whatever she wants,

880
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,753
wear whatever she wants,

881
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,156
play with whoever she wants.

882
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:20,218
"I'm gonna be
the best mom ever."

883
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,456
( knocking on door)

884
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,426
( knocking )

885
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:41,509
Know where I was
when Olivia Barnes got murdered?

886
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,352
Eating lasagna.

887
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:51,554
She'd been missing 72 hours.

888
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:56,053
Nancy:
Brittany Lyttle's been gone 43.

889
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:02,702
- Hi, Helen.
- Ronnie.

890
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:05,035
I was wondering when you
were gonna come by and visit me.

891
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:08,508
Come here!

892
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:13,109
Oh, my girl!

893
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:14,979
Jones: Ronnie Fuller.

894
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:18,144
As damaged as that girl is,
I wouldn't put anything past her.

895
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,246
I checked on Alice's story
about Arby's.

896
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:24,121
Girl on duty
doesn't remember her.

897
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,755
Helen: You grew up so pretty.

898
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:32,460
I knew you would!

899
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:35,492
You don't need all that makeup.

900
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,630
And obviously,
you still bite your nails.

901
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,004
Don't you know when people see
your bitten-down nails,

902
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,839
they know how nervous you are?

903
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:53,045
Ronnie: Where's Alice?

904
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:55,215
Helen: I don't know.

905
01:01:56,212 --> 01:02:00,285
You know she goes walking?
( chuckles )

906
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:05,762
Helen: I was coming home
from work the other day...

907
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:09,464
I drove past the pool
and I saw her.

908
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,369
You know, at the country club?

909
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,466
Just watching people.

910
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,171
Made me sad.

911
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,303
(clinking )

912
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:28,652
( police radio chatter)

913
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,295
Nancy: Mind if I join you?

914
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,905
I guess walking
is pretty good for you.

915
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,809
Is this the route
you usually take?

916
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,982
What do you want?

917
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:05,424
I don't know where she is.

918
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,894
Who, Alice?

919
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,919
Ronnie.

920
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:14,593
We spoke to Ronnie Fuller.
She was very helpful.

921
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,695
What did she say?

922
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:18,637
Did she lie about me again?

923
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,972
Did she tell you
how she stole my jack-in-the-box?

924
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:25,605
She put it there on purpose
so I would get caught, too.

925
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,206
But I wasn't there
when she killed that baby.

926
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:29,648
But I still went to Schechter.

927
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:30,810
Now you're trying to make
this other thing

928
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,842
look like it's my fault.

929
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:38,258
Well, what is your fault, Alice?
Ls anything ever your fault?

930
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:40,852
What about you?

931
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:42,385
Do you ever wonder
what would have happened

932
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:45,524
if maybe you had found
the baby sooner?

933
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:47,796
Maybe you could have saved her.

934
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:52,631
Maybe if you had walked
just a little bit faster,

935
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,403
she would still be alive.

936
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,940
Did you ever think about that?

937
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:06,017
I want to be alone.
Am I under arrest or anything?

938
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:12,924
Ronnie: Do you remember
the honeysuckle?

939
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,759
(laughing)

940
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,594
Remember that time I tried to make
honeysuckle soda

941
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,566
and sell it from a stand
like lemonade?

942
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:23,332
Mm-hmm. I do. I sure do.

943
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,635
( Chuckles )
You picked my vines bare.

944
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:28,198
But you didn't mind.

945
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,609
You weren't mad at all.

946
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,738
It was a good idea, Ronnie.

947
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:35,044
There should be
honeysuckle soda.

948
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,644
You have great ideas.
You always did.

949
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:43,182
You and me, we think alike.

950
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:55,499
. And press your lips to mine...

951
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,071
Ronnie?

952
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,836
You got anything
you need to tell me, baby?

953
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:08,607
No.

954
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:14,111
This is heaven..

955
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:18,825
(car engine whirrs)

956
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:28,062
Alice: See you.

957
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:37,943
( Door opens, closes )

958
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:43,681
Helen: Where were you?
Did you get a ride?

959
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,780
I know you get rides.

960
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:50,689
Really?
Who do you think gives me rides?

961
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:54,421
I don't know. You tell me.

962
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,691
Well...

963
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,426
I take rides from strange men

964
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,560
because I'm fat and lonely
and I need attention,

965
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,231
so I do things to 'em...
for money.

966
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,401
Is it true?

967
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,469
(chuckles)

968
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,972
You wish.

969
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:18,417
- I got a job.
- Alice, talk to me.

970
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:19,920
You got a job?

971
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:22,252
What do you mean you got a job?

972
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:25,487
I got a job
and it has nothing to do

973
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,653
with being fat or lonely.

974
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,760
( Door closes )

975
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,539
Jones: Jesus, laceration
of the femoral artery.

976
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:41,098
Rushed to the ER.

977
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,542
Landed her on suicide watch.

978
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:45,739
What about Manning?

979
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:49,181
Nancy: Yeast infection...
yeast infection.

980
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,912
Another yeast infection.

981
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,420
Jones: One, two, three,
four, five, six fights.

982
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,251
This Ronnie girl's
a piece of work.

983
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:56,722
She managed
to get in a fight every month.

984
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:59,056
Spent most of the last seven years
on lockdown.

985
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,720
I got a bladder infection
and another yeast infection.

986
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:03,924
You know what that means?

987
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:06,433
Jones: Sounds like
she was fucking to me.

988
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:12,665
- Whoa.
- Hmm?

989
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,641
Get over here.

990
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:26,313
Helen: She was 15 years old.
He was an adult.

991
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:28,413
He was an employee
at Schechter.

992
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:31,687
Probably seduced her once.

993
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,592
Couldn't have been
terribly difficult.

994
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:37,598
She's so desperate
for attention and acceptance.

995
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,464
Hmm. I wonder why that is?

996
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,872
This adult, was he charged
with statutory rape?

997
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,103
Helen:
We agreed not to press charges.

998
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,303
By the time she figured out
she was pregnant,

999
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:53,108
it was too late for me
to convince her to have an abortion.

1000
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,407
Does Alice know
where her baby is?

1001
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:58,043
Helen: Absolutely not.

1002
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:01,248
No, no, no.
The adoption was private.

1003
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:03,723
We don't discuss it.

1004
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,623
She doesn't think about it.

1005
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:07,992
How would you know that?

1006
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:13,457
You're not a mother, are you?
A mother knows these things.

1007
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:15,833
Nancy: Where is Alice now?
Where is she?

1008
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,860
Where does she go
when she walks?

1009
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:20,237
- She doesn't tell me where she goes.
- Jones: No, Ms. Manning.

1010
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,572
That's not gonna
work this time, I'm sorry.

1011
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:25,408
There's a baby missing.

1012
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,436
And we have reason
to believe that your daughter Alice

1013
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:28,949
knows something about it.

1014
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,814
So you can answer
our questions here,

1015
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,184
or I can walk you down
that hall past your peers,

1016
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:36,622
take you downtown,
have you answer the questions there.

1017
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,888
She seems to spend
the bulk of her time

1018
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,799
just hanging out
by the pool at the club.

1019
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:53,230
( Sighs )
Just watching the other kids.

1020
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:54,832
It's pathetic.

1021
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,512
(bird screeching)

1022
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:25,396
They're going to catch you,
you know.

1023
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:27,566
Ronnie: Catch me for what?
I didn't do anything.

1024
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:30,440
Alice:
The police think you did.

1025
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:32,571
It was near where you work.

1026
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:35,548
It was near where about
a thousand people work.

1027
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:41,553
(Olivia's voice crying )

1028
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:45,952
There is only one person
like you who works there...

1029
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:49,724
A baby killer.

1030
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,163
(crying continues)

1031
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:54,931
Younger Alice:
You have to to do this, Ronnie.

1032
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:58,063
Lots of babies die all the time
of natural things,

1033
01:09:58,093 --> 01:09:59,834
like if they're turned wrong
in their crib.

1034
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,571
- Just say she died like that.
- I don't want to do it.

1035
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:13,211
You fed her pudding.
You can't feed a baby pudding.

1036
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:14,721
You told me to.

1037
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:16,484
So if Alice told you

1038
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:18,458
to jump off of a building,
would you do that?

1039
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,086
What about if she told you
to play with matches?

1040
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,595
Would you do that, huh?

1041
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:26,122
What about if Alice told you to go
and find a bridge and leap off?

1042
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:27,759
- Shut up!
- ( Olivia's voice crying )

1043
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:33,504
Your mom knows
I didn't do anything.

1044
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,976
Stay away from her.

1045
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:38,273
You don't even live
near us anymore.

1046
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,803
You have no reason
to be hanging around.

1047
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:43,844
My mom just
feels sorry for you.

1048
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:46,648
- She likes me.
- ( Alice laughs)

1049
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:48,348
Nancy: Alice Manning?

1050
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,952
You know why I made you do it?

1051
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,020
Because I knew
that they would take you away.

1052
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:58,861
I thought they
would lock you up forever,

1053
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:00,798
and I would never
have to play with you again.

1054
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:03,201
Nancy: Alice!

1055
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:06,695
Hurry, she did it!

1056
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,936
She just told me everything!
She took the baby!

1057
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:10,739
You have to catch her,
why... hurry!

1058
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,439
Jones: Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

1059
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:14,505
- No.
- No, Alice.

1060
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:16,038
We're not here for her,
we're here for you.

1061
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:18,073
- I didn't do anything.
- Let's go.

1062
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,348
You don't understand.
Ronnie did it. She just told me.

1063
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:23,789
Alice, we're walking out,
or we're putting you in handcuffs.

1064
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,222
Come on.

1065
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,028
It's not fair.

1066
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:32,555
Mm-hmm, watch your step.

1067
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,173
- You have the wrong person.
- Jones: Mm-hmm.

1068
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:44,109
You have to believe me.

1069
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,010
Ronnie did this.

1070
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:19,867
Jones: Alice.

1071
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:22,280
Jones: Alice.

1072
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,875
Where is she, Alice?

1073
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:27,512
Is she okay?

1074
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:29,955
Did you hurt her?

1075
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:35,922
( Footsteps approaching )

1076
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:44,598
Hello, I'm here to see
a Detective Porter.

1077
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,868
- ( Phone ringing )
- Mrs. Manning.

1078
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:51,173
If you're going to continue
to interrogate my daughter,

1079
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,804
- I want a lawyer present.
- She has her.

1080
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:55,076
She has Brittany.

1081
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,822
Jesus.

1082
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:08,627
- Did she hurt her?
- Where is she?

1083
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,755
I have no idea.

1084
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:14,131
We have been very patient
with you, Mrs. Manning.

1085
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:18,938
We haven't treated you
as an accessory to this crime

1086
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:21,601
or accused you
of shielding your daughter

1087
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,132
or withholding
information we need,

1088
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:25,543
but that moment is coming.

1089
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:29,072
Alice doesn't
confide in anyone,

1090
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:31,482
least of all me.

1091
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:34,750
Why does she think Brittany Lyttle
is her daughter?

1092
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,227
Oh...

1093
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:53,038
First, he would stare at me.

1094
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,910
(signal buzzes)

1095
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:04,050
Alice's voice:
You know, kind of flirt.

1096
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:10,651
He was so cute.

1097
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:13,387
I had never been
with a boy before.

1098
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,791
I'd never kissed a boy before.

1099
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:26,164
We couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

1100
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:28,232
( Moans)

1101
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:37,577
I was so excited.

1102
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:43,484
But when they took him away,
it was so sudden.

1103
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:48,427
It happened so quickly,
and I didn't know what to do.

1104
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,693
My mom said I had
my whole life ahead of me.

1105
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,166
And that she had me
when she was really young

1106
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,465
and she didn't regret it
or anything.

1107
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:59,272
Helen: You have to understand,

1108
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,331
she became obsessed
with the topic.

1109
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:03,365
"Where was her baby?"

1110
01:15:03,398 --> 01:15:05,901
Why couldn't I raise it?

1111
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:07,936
"Who had adopted her?"

1112
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,507
She wouldn't leave it alone.

1113
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:13,816
She was inconsolable.
I had to tell her something.

1114
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:22,221
(sighs)

1115
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,563
I made up a story.

1116
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:31,468
Helen's voice:
I said I'd seen her little girl...

1117
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:32,699
on the west side of town.

1118
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:35,402
You know, near those
lovely old Victorians?

1119
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:38,604
I knew Alice would like that.

1120
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:43,140
I told her that her baby
was beautiful and healthy.

1121
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:45,276
She had café-au-lait skin...

1122
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:48,049
beautiful, black curly hair.

1123
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:51,057
Oh, yeah.

1124
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:53,992
It was around that time
that I had seen the mother.

1125
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,427
The mother?

1126
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:58,522
You know... Cynthia Barnes.

1127
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,898
The mother
of the child that Alice...

1128
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:06,566
Helen's voice:
She was with this little girl.

1129
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:11,068
I took one look
at that girl and I knew...

1130
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:14,478
that child wouldn't exist

1131
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:17,507
if it weren't for Alice.

1132
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,949
Which isn't to say
that what Alice did

1133
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:25,982
can be rationalized in any way,

1134
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:28,426
I mean, a girl had died,

1135
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,726
and it was my daughter's fault.

1136
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:34,131
But the fact remains,

1137
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:36,966
another child lives.

1138
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:41,065
And I'm not sure she would
if it weren't for Alice.

1139
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:46,637
My daughter helped to bring
that little life into the world.

1140
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:49,845
At least Alice
can take some comfort

1141
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:52,750
from that little girl's
existence.

1142
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:56,552
When I got out,
I had to find her.

1143
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:00,990
I wanted her.

1144
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:03,826
I didn't care what my mom said.

1145
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:10,495
Alice's voice:
So I started walking.

1146
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:13,699
Just looking for her.

1147
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:17,142
Helen:
I also told her that her child

1148
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:19,406
had a little birthmark

1149
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:22,904
in the shape of a heart
on her back.

1150
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,749
I thought that was
a lovely sort of detail...

1151
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:32,718
you know, that would give Alice
something that she could hold on to.

1152
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:38,458
Like it was the shadow
of her own heart.

1153
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:43,092
Alice loved that. ( Laughs )

1154
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:46,402
Mrs. Manning, sit down.

1155
01:17:47,396 --> 01:17:50,400
Sit down, Mrs. Manning, sit.

1156
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:57,710
Stay there.

1157
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:06,586
She had that skin...

1158
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:13,058
the mix of my skin and his.

1159
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:17,733
I couldn't believe I found her.

1160
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,935
Brittany?

1161
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:24,671
Devlin: She probably jumpin'
on a bed somewhere.

1162
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:27,808
Alice's voice:
When I saw her back,

1163
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:31,943
there was this little heart there,
and I knew it was her.

1164
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:34,977
- Devlin, keep looking!
- Devlin: Brittany!

1165
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:37,012
Now, Brit, you're gonna be
in trouble

1166
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:38,718
- if you don't come out!
- Maveen: Oh, God! Oh, God!

1167
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:43,696
- Alice: Hey!
- Que linda, que linda! Hi!

1168
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:47,292
Alice: Good girl, good girl.
Good girl.

1169
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:49,029
Brittany!

1170
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,798
Devlin: Where is she?

1171
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:52,305
Brittany!

1172
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:55,433
Alice's voice:
She was so beautiful.

1173
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:58,104
She looked just like Rodrigo.

1174
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:02,945
- Maveen: Brittany? Shit!
- Brittany!

1175
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:05,645
( Panting )

1176
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:10,119
( Rodrigo laughing )

1177
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:12,456
Alice: Cut her hair.

1178
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:15,690
Alice's voice: I asked him to cut
her hair so nobody would find her.

1179
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:25,404
He was so nervous,
his nose even started bleeding.

1180
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:31,306
You can't arrest someone
for taking her own baby.

1181
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,516
It took me a long time
to find her.

1182
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:41,885
But now that I have,
you can't make me give her back.

1183
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:46,487
I never wanted to give her up
in the first place.

1184
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:50,094
My mom made me.

1185
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:55,396
Nancy: This is Brittany Lyttle's
birth certificate.

1186
01:19:56,858 --> 01:20:00,431
And this is your baby's.

1187
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:04,343
They are two
different girls, Alice.

1188
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:15,881
Where is Brittany?

1189
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:23,560
I know what we did was wrong.

1190
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:27,294
But what happened to me
was wrong, too.

1191
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:31,771
They took my baby.

1192
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:35,400
I want her. I want her.

1193
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:39,071
I understand, Alice. I do.

1194
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:43,114
But not everybody will.

1195
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,209
You are in a lot of trouble.

1196
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:49,814
You could be convicted
of a very serious crime.

1197
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:53,884
You need to help us.

1198
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:56,589
And we'll help you.

1199
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:01,167
What do you mean?

1200
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:03,135
Will you help me find my baby?

1201
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,175
No, Alice. No.

1202
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:12,843
( Sobs softly )

1203
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:16,179
Help me.

1204
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,946
And I'll help you.

1205
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:27,850
Rodrigo left her with his mom
while he drove me home...

1206
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,693
so that no one
would suspect me.

1207
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:37,332
We planned on keeping her there
while we waited...

1208
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:40,363
for you to think
Ronnie Fuller took her.

1209
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:45,175
You know, she's done this before,
she might do it again.

1210
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:56,853
(Olivia's voice crying )

1211
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:03,562
(Olivia's voice crying )

1212
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:08,359
Young Ronnie:
I think she's really sick.

1213
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:12,167
We should just
take her out to her family.

1214
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:14,002
It's too late, Ronnie.

1215
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:16,202
(Olivia crying. Gasping )

1216
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:25,143
(Olivia's voice crying )

1217
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:31,817
This was your idea, Ronnie!

1218
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:33,951
Alice: I'll blame it on you.

1219
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:35,962
You said you would
take care of it.

1220
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,466
(crying continues)

1221
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:54,207
(Olivia's voice crying )

1222
01:22:58,073 --> 01:23:01,054
(groaning )

1223
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:03,215
( crying $TOP$ )

1224
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:13,398
(water dripping )

1225
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:24,541
(sirens wailing)

1226
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:38,884
( knocking on door)

1227
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:42,087
Ronnie?

1228
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:43,892
Come in, sweetie.

1229
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:45,761
- I didn't want to, but she made me.
- What?

1230
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:47,494
I'm sorry, please. I'm sorry.

1231
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:50,469
Ronnie, Ronnie, shh. Shh.

1232
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:54,369
Police on radio: Separation
of the individuals at the location...

1233
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:56,398
( knocking )

1234
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:00,810
(door latch clicking,
door creaks )

1235
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:03,679
Helen:
I can't undo what you've done.

1236
01:24:04,672 --> 01:24:08,210
But I can make sure
that Alice...

1237
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:11,087
doesn't go unpunished.

1238
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:15,856
I can make it fair.

1239
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,519
( Clatters )

1240
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:56,199
Hey, Mom.

1241
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:09,811
( Police radio chatter)

1242
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:19,018
( Brittany crying )

1243
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,738
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1244
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:41,144
- Maveen: Oh, my God!
- Devlin: Yeah, yeah!

1245
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:44,116
Oh, my God! Hi, baby!

1246
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,683
- Hi!
- Brittany!

1247
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:48,312
Hi, baby!

1248
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:50,414
Brit-Brit!

1249
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:52,584
( Sobbing ) Oh, my God.

1250
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:54,560
Devlin: I love you.

1251
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:57,586
- Devlin: Ah!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1252
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:03,959
Thank you. Thank you.

1253
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:07,872
( Softly )
Thank you. Okay, I love you.

1254
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:13,434
Ah.

1255
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:20,619
- ( Sighs )
- Good work, Detective.

1256
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:24,846
(gate clicks)

1257
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:30,487
Woman on TV:
Today, state prosecution has agreed

1258
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:32,429
to a plea bargain
with Alice Manning.

1259
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:35,991
All charges are dropped against her,
while Rodrigo Gutierrez,

1260
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,937
the state employee she now
has accused of raping her in prison,

1261
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,873
will alone serve 10 years
for the kidnapping.

1262
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:44,877
Earlier today, Miss Manning
gave a statement to the press.

1263
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:47,277
Alice on video:
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

1264
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:50,340
yes, I have something
I would like to say.

1265
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:53,352
I am a victim.

1266
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:56,378
I am a victim
of the justice system.

1267
01:26:57,412 --> 01:27:02,020
As a child, I was wrongly accused
of a crime I did not commit.

1268
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:06,760
I spent seven years
in a correctional facility

1269
01:27:06,788 --> 01:27:09,462
where I was raped

1270
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:11,401
and where I gave birth
to a baby

1271
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:14,168
who was taken from me.

1272
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:18,575
Today, justice was served.

1273
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,772
- ( Jones chuckles)
- The charges against me

1274
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:21,542
have been dropped.

1275
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:24,413
And the man who
manipulated me as a minor...

1276
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:25,782
Jones: She's good.

1277
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:28,413
And who instigated
this crime will be convicted.

1278
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:30,389
Scary good.

1279
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,357
I can now live freely.

1280
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:36,021
I can seek to validate
my rights as an adult.

1281
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:38,257
Thank you.

1282
01:27:38,286 --> 01:27:40,766
- Man: Miss Alice Manning.
- Woman: Alice! Alice Manning!

1283
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:47,370
You know who's better?

1284
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:26,005
( Instrumental music playing )
