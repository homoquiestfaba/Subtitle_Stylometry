1
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:04,794
(intense orchestral music)

2
00:00:05,644 --> 00:00:08,986
(thunder crashing)

3
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:12,653
(rhythmic percussion music)

4
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,713
(intense orchestral music)

5
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:57,669
(contemplative orchestral music)

6
00:01:57,669 --> 00:02:00,836
(creature screeching)

7
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,921
(Tiko snoring)

8
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:05,779
(creature roaring)

9
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:12,745
(Tiko snoring)

10
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:38,122
(intense synth music)

11
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:42,322
- Tahra!

12
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,155
Tahra!

13
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,668
Tahra!

14
00:03:58,619 --> 00:03:59,452
Tahra!

15
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:28,691
Tahra!

16
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:32,851
Tahra...

17
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:53,162
(creature vocalizing)

18
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:08,269
(creature roaring)
(intense orchestral music)

19
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:19,927
(portal zapping)

20
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:42,893
(dog barking)

21
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:01,700
- Take a look at this.

22
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,210
- How fascinating.

23
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,830
It's a rock.

24
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,810
- Oh, shut up, Sharon.

25
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,250
What do you know?

26
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,563
- Aw, Richard, you're hurting my feelings.

27
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,180
- Just keep working.

28
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,013
- Yes, sir.

29
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,840
(portal zapping)
(intense orchestral music)

30
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:23,744
What's that noise?

31
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,541
- I don't know,

32
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,374
but I think it's coming

33
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:29,880
from around that hillside over there.

34
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,380
- Should we go see what it is?

35
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:35,110
- I guess so, but I don't
want to waste too much time.

36
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,552
I feel we're making great
progress right here.

37
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:41,120
I'm certain that prehistoric
men inhabited this area.

38
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,950
And if we just work at it,

39
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,190
I know we can make a great
archeological discovery.

40
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,370
- It'll only take a minute.

41
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,320
Besides, I want to stretch my legs out.

42
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,570
- Okay, I'm convinced.

43
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,440
I mean, after all,

44
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,340
bones of ancient man and beast
have been here for a while.

45
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,640
They'll be here when we get back.

46
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,190
- Finally, you say something
that makes perfect sense.

47
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,023
- Flattering.

48
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:01,856
- Come on.

49
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,112
- Wow.

50
00:07:29,052 --> 00:07:30,760
- What is that?

51
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,593
- Just a hunch,

52
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:34,450
but I think it's one of
those black hole vortex.

53
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,660
I read about 'em.

54
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,930
- You have?

55
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,200
- Well, in a comic book,

56
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,290
but I mean it fits the description.

57
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,883
I bet this is a portal to
another world dimension,

58
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,663
or something.

59
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:48,881
Wow.

60
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:50,077
Let me try something.

61
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:55,308
(portal zapping)

62
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,850
Whoa.
- Uh-oh.

63
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,350
- That's not good.

64
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:11,121
- Tahra scared.

65
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:18,810
- I think we've done enough
exploring for one day.

66
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,590
Why don't we go back to the
RV and stretch your legs?

67
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,240
- You don't have to twist my arm.

68
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,530
My own little piece of civilization.

69
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,540
- [Richard] All the comforts of home.

70
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,733
- I could use a little comfort right now.

71
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:55,410
That thing really freaked me out.

72
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,983
- Science is a mysterious lady.

73
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:07,131
And you were talking about
maybe stretching your legs.

74
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:09,677
- Subtle, very subtle.

75
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:21,382
(soft jazz music)
(moaning)

76
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:22,215
Come here.

77
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:28,926
(soft jazz music)
(moaning)

78
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:41,191
(faint speaking)

79
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:42,441
- By all means.

80
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,533
I'll watch you do that.

81
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:56,405
(intense orchestral music)

82
00:09:56,405 --> 00:09:57,238
Oh my god!

83
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,683
Okay, everyone just calm down.

84
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,070
- Who is that?

85
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,200
- Look at her.

86
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,690
Animal skin prints, tribal tattoos,

87
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,630
long flowing brown hair, supple breasts.

88
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,713
- I noticed.

89
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,253
- She looks positively prehistoric.

90
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,673
- [Sharon] What's your name, honey?

91
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,290
- Don't worry.

92
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,203
We won't hurt you.

93
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,087
- Tahra.

94
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,763
- Tahra.

95
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:33,249
That's good.

96
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:38,249
Tahra, Tahra, I'm Richard.

97
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:40,700
This is Sharon.

98
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,023
- And we're all here
to play super password.

99
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:44,859
- Tahra.

100
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,613
- I got that.

101
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,913
Where are you from, Tahra?

102
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,600
- I think she means that
big black hole thing.

103
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,960
- Yes.

104
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,290
Tahra, are you from the big black hole?

105
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,283
The big?

106
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:07,430
Incredible.

107
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,070
She must be some form of
prehistoric cave dweller

108
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,070
who traveled to the vortex
and got pulled into our time.

109
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,957
- [Sharon] That's unbelievable.

110
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:20,193
- Well, there she is.

111
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:24,754
(Tahra vocalizing)

112
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,820
- Okay, if this is true,
then what do we do next?

113
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,600
- Well, we need to bring
her back to civilization.

114
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,480
The world will want to know about this.

115
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,630
Think of everything we can learn from her.

116
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,280
- You know I don't
approve of bringing back

117
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,223
every little stray that we find.

118
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:47,963
(Tahra vocalizing)

119
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,553
But she is pretty and she does look lost.

120
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:58,113
- Tahra, Tahra, do you
want to come home with us?

121
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,694
I'll take that as a yes.

122
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:04,527
- Okay.

123
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:05,360
- Let's go.

124
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,210
Come on, Tahra, this way.

125
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,443
This, Richard's big cave, big cave.

126
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,583
Come on, this way.

127
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,503
Right over here.

128
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:36,336
That's good.

129
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:37,723
Watch your step.

130
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,453
Tahra, sit right here, okay?

131
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:43,660
- Okay.

132
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,120
- That's good.

133
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,070
- Just like parrot.

134
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:50,710
- Tahra.

135
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,690
- [Narrator] As he gives new life

136
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,517
to dangerous exploits and bearing--

137
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:57,130
- You, you watch this,

138
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,880
and we'll be right back, okay?

139
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,101
- Okay.

140
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:03,040
- [Richard] Good girl.

141
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,200
- [Female Speaker] The man
he took with him, they lie.

142
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,920
They're hunters, killers.

143
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,483
- Sharon, can I see you
in the bedroom, please?

144
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,140
- [Narrator] In the forbidden
wilderness of jungle beasts,

145
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,983
lurking killers, savage
torturers, deadly quicksand.

146
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:21,369
(woman screaming)

147
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:25,700
(speaking in foreign language)

148
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,430
- [Male Speaker] Invoke spirit.

149
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,925
Ask them what shall be their punishment.

150
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:30,758
- The spirit say death!

151
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:38,660
- Okay, here's what we need to do.

152
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,870
You need to get her cleaned up

153
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,510
and into some of your clothes.

154
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,530
I'll call Professor
Matthews at the university

155
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,210
and get him to come over tonight.

156
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,240
Then we'll work out a plan from there.

157
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,410
- I'll try, but if she bites me,

158
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,390
we're gonna have trouble.

159
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,240
- That's my girl.

160
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,480
- [Narrator] Werewolves and
vampires will reign supreme

161
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,580
and things will happen

162
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,637
that have never been seen by human beings.

163
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:05,523
Your blood will boil and
your flesh will crawl.

164
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:08,923
- Tahra?

165
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,183
- For whiter and brighter teeth.

166
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,080
- That's pretty good.

167
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,573
- Cuts grease like no other.

168
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,440
- Great, honey.

169
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,540
We've got some things to do.

170
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,890
Why don't you come with me?

171
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,388
- Feeling not so fresh?

172
00:14:28,388 --> 00:14:31,193
- Just come with me.

173
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:42,200
(dial pad beeping)

174
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,120
- Professor Matthews, please.

175
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,953
Thanks.

176
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,110
- Hello?

177
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,440
- Professor Matthews, it's Richard.

178
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,140
You're not going to believe
what I have to tell you.

179
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,190
Are you sitting down?

180
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,520
- Yes, I'm sitting down.

181
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,490
- Good.

182
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,553
It's like this.

183
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,223
- Really?

184
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,490
Hmm.

185
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,813
Very interesting, Richard.

186
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,720
Mm-hmm.

187
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,420
I hope you're not calling collect.

188
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,120
- Okay, let's get these
smelly things off of you.

189
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,953
Top.

190
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,110
- Top.

191
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,469
- Top.

192
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:26,302
Off.

193
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,043
Top.

194
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,663
No, top.

195
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,593
Off.

196
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:38,854
Okay.

197
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,603
Bottoms, take them down, off.

198
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,943
- Good to the last drop.

199
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,893
- Bottoms.

200
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,193
Good.

201
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,890
Do you like hot water?

202
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,063
- Half the carbs, same great taste.

203
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,967
- You'll see.

204
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,134
Okay, come on.

205
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,363
(intense orchestral music)

206
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:29,889
(portal zapping)

207
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:40,926
(Tiko yelling)

208
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:21,326
(Tiko sniffing)

209
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,983
- Tire tracks.

210
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,347
(knocking on door)

211
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:54,814
- Mr. Matthews.
- Ah, Richard.

212
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:55,897
- Come on in.

213
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,430
- Evening, Richard.

214
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,263
- Cynthia.

215
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,250
- Richard, Richard, Richard.

216
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,850
I hope you know what you're talking about

217
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,550
because that story you
told me on the phone

218
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,980
sounded absolutely fantastic.

219
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,390
- Professor, what I'm going
to show you is fantastic.

220
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,490
Sharon is working with our
new discovery right now

221
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,323
as we speak.

222
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:22,720
She'll be out in a bit.

223
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,490
So how about a cocktail?

224
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:29,020
- Martini, up, three olives, no pimento.

225
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,303
Just like the old days, Richard.

226
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,470
- Yes.

227
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,360
I'll have my martini shaken,

228
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,510
and I'll have another martini stirred,

229
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,553
and another one shaken and stirred.

230
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,030
- All right.

231
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,000
I'll see what I can do for you, Professor.

232
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,833
Come this way.

233
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,690
- Preferably in a dog dish.

234
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,130
- We have what I believe to be

235
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,573
a bonafide prehistoric cave girl.

236
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,840
- Oh, yes,

237
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,653
brought into a modern day
by a time vortex, I suppose.

238
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,473
- There is no other explanation.

239
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,593
- I have one.

240
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,630
How about you both are nuts.

241
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,230
- Ah, you'll see.

242
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,950
We've been working with her a little bit

243
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,720
and she has the amazing
capacity to pick things up.

244
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,095
She's at Cro-Magnon level already.

245
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,623
- Well, I'm anxious to test her.

246
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,760
- We'll set up the
equipment in the living room

247
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,410
and I'm sure we'll find the
results very interesting.

248
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,413
- All right.

249
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,240
Well, help me, won't you?

250
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,073
- Oh, Cynthia,

251
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:41,230
would you be a doll
and fix us those drinks

252
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,380
like the old days, huh?

253
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:54,060
- [Professor] All right, now, the monitor.

254
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,010
- The monitor, professor.

255
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,890
- Oh, careful, you fool!

256
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,000
Do you know how much this is worth?

257
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,045
- Sorry, Professor.

258
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:03,863
- All right, now the electrodes.

259
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,563
That's it.

260
00:20:09,563 --> 00:20:10,890
- Professor, this is all your own design?

261
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,420
- Oh yes, yes, yes.

262
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,590
Many years of teaching electronic shop

263
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,850
one-on-one at trade tech.

264
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,683
- Fascinating.

265
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,810
- Plug that there.

266
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,013
Now, we'll see if it works.

267
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:27,340
(machinery beeping)

268
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,103
What'd I tell you?
- Excellent.

269
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,103
- All right.

270
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:33,695
We're ready.

271
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,533
(Tiko yelling)

272
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,613
- Cynthia, you look gorgeous tonight.

273
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,123
This is Tahra.

274
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,320
- So this is your little cave girl?

275
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,300
She doesn't look too primitive
from where I'm standing.

276
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,400
- She just had a bath.

277
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,540
- Whoa, down girl.

278
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,243
- Smells fresh like a summer's day.

279
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,600
- Is she calling me a douche bag?

280
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,800
- I think she likes you.

281
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,960
- Well, there's a lot of her to like too.

282
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,163
- Pretty girl.

283
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:24,204
- Uh-huh.

284
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:26,980
- Professor Matthews, this is Tahra.

285
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,440
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,787
Well, very nice to meet you, Tahra.

287
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,650
She's very clean, isn't she?

288
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,483
- Yes.

289
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,640
She communicates in her own way.

290
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,473
- Oh, believe me.

291
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:43,000
He doesn't mind.

292
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,120
- Professor, we have everything set up.

293
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,320
Should we begin the experiment?

294
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,850
- Oh, absolutely, yes.

295
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,550
I can't wait to see what kind of results

296
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,050
we get from this test.

297
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,770
Richard, would you please score Tahra in?

298
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,800
- Of course.

299
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,713
Tahra, come with me, girl.

300
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,040
Good girl.

301
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,873
Heel, heel.

302
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,663
- Yes, yes.

303
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,543
Now, ladies,

304
00:23:08,543 --> 00:23:10,470
I must insist that you don't disturb us

305
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,670
under any circumstances.

306
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,413
Under any circumstance.

307
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,330
- Great.

308
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,190
- I trust I made myself clear.

309
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,023
- Go.

310
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:23,730
- It's gonna take a while.

311
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,410
- Hours, gosh.

312
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,310
What do we do now?

313
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,468
- Want to see my new nightie?

314
00:23:28,468 --> 00:23:29,620
- Yeah, sure.

315
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,453
- Come on.

316
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:38,304
(suspenseful synth music)

317
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:37,948
- Now, Tahra, this isn't
going to even tickle.

318
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:41,590
This is a very sophisticated
brain wave analyzer

319
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,100
that is actually going to
monitor your thought patterns

320
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,683
to see what's going on inside
that little noggin of yours.

321
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,700
You have absolutely no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

322
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,597
- Sunday, Sunday, Sunday,
destruction dirt derby.

323
00:25:00,597 --> 00:25:04,437
- Tahra, Tahra, all you have
to do is lie back and relax,

324
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,530
maybe even take a little nap.

325
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,047
You won't feel a thing.

326
00:25:08,047 --> 00:25:09,440
- $10 buys you the whole seat,

327
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,113
but you only need the edge.

328
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,590
- All righty, let's test it.

329
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,423
Shall we go?

330
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,193
Phase one.

331
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,573
Phase two.

332
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,070
There we go.

333
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,493
And phase three.

334
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:31,220
(laughing) What'd I tell you?
- Genius device.

335
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,510
- All right, all right.

336
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:37,510
Now, we should be monitoring
your brainwaves shortly.

337
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,897
- So, what do you think?

338
00:25:46,897 --> 00:25:48,023
- It's fab.

339
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,840
- Richard loves to buy me expensive stuff

340
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,920
so shut up about his fossil hunting.

341
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,750
He's such a nerd.

342
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,650
- Well, I love this.

343
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,260
The material looks so silky.

344
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,450
Can I touch it?

345
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,283
- Sure.

346
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,663
- Girls like Tahra.

347
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,068
- Oh my god, check this guy out.

348
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:30,985
- Oh, shit.

349
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,963
Now, that's what I call it a cave man.

350
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,343
- Girls like Tahra.

351
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:39,310
- What is he saying?

352
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,785
- I think he's looking for Tahra.

353
00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:43,970
I wonder how he found us.

354
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,860
- Who cares?

355
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,582
He's here now.

356
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:49,030
- [Sharon] So what do we do?

357
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,920
- Well, they did say not to disturb them

358
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,440
under any circumstances.

359
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,270
So I guess we should
just keep him occupied

360
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,193
until they're done testing her.

361
00:26:57,193 --> 00:26:58,470
What are you thinking?

362
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,420
- Probably the same thing that you are.

363
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,093
- Come here, big boy.

364
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,947
We've got something we want to show you.

365
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:29,217
(Tiko roaring)
(women laughing)

366
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,063
- Don't give up.

367
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:34,210
I mean, she's got to have some brainwaves.

368
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,600
Everybody does, right?

369
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,823
- I wouldn't bet on it.

370
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,444
- Look, look!

371
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:52,849
Isn't that amazing?

372
00:27:54,658 --> 00:27:55,658
- I knew it.

373
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:02,660
My boy, do you have any
idea what this means?

374
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,714
- She's the real McCoy.

375
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:06,867
- Yes, yes, she certainly is.

376
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,773
Well, this machine survey
does kick ass, doesn't it?

377
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,790
- Tahra, Tahra, think back.

378
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,425
Think back to prehistoric times.

379
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:26,175
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

380
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:32,777
(intense orchestral music)

381
00:28:36,264 --> 00:28:37,514
- Tahra scared.

382
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:40,323
- Oh, Tahra.

383
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:44,344
It's okay.

384
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:45,177
It's all right.

385
00:28:45,177 --> 00:28:46,150
We'll stop now, we'll stop now.

386
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,513
I've actually seen enough for one night.

387
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,183
- Well?

388
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,030
- Well, Richard,

389
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,490
this is the greatest
discovery of the 21st century.

390
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,930
Congratulations.

391
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:59,763
- Thank you.

392
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,583
It's okay, Tahra.

393
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:02,850
It's all over.

394
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,150
You can get some rest now.

395
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,250
- Yes.

396
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,260
Yes, that's a good idea.

397
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,103
You know, this whole process
can be very draining.

398
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,090
- Come on.

399
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,107
Let's go, Tahra.

400
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:24,702
- So.

401
00:29:24,702 --> 00:29:26,180
(Professor gasping)

402
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,380
How'd it go?

403
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,250
- Incredible, incredible.

404
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,707
I tell you, this girl is an
absolute megalithic throwback.

405
00:29:32,707 --> 00:29:36,182
- James, what'd I tell you
about that academic mumbo-jumbo?

406
00:29:36,182 --> 00:29:37,015
English.

407
00:29:37,015 --> 00:29:38,695
- What I mean is whoever possesses her

408
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,780
is going to be famous

409
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,280
and wealthy beyond their wildest dreams.

410
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,763
- That's plain enough for me.

411
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,470
- Now, if there was only some way

412
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,573
we could get her away from Richard.

413
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,290
- Ooh, I know.

414
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,790
You could hit him over the
head and knock him out.

415
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,910
- No, no, he'd be too
smart for that old trick.

416
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,720
- There was another one.

417
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,200
- Another one, another what?

418
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,420
- Well, her caveman buddy
showed up, but he got away.

419
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,703
We tried to stop him,
but he overpowered us.

420
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,640
- Caveman, another one?

421
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,473
- Yeah.

422
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:19,306
- You mean two?

423
00:30:19,306 --> 00:30:20,430
- Yeah, two.

424
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,500
- Oh, this is better than I thought,

425
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,333
better than I thought.

426
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:27,090
Now, listen, I've got a
great idea, a great idea.

427
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:30,190
Just come with me.

428
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,562
(Cynthia gasping)

429
00:30:39,562 --> 00:30:40,460
How about it?

430
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,750
Do I look like the caveman that you saw?

431
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,620
- Absolutely not.

432
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,670
It's dark, who cares?

433
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,721
- Okay, you know the plan, right?

434
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,554
- Yeah.

435
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:50,410
You're gonna sneak inside,

436
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,950
make her think you're a caveman.

437
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,680
I don't know how, but you'll do it,

438
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,820
and then bring her out to the car

439
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,950
and we'll drive her to the lab.

440
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,591
- Yes, right, right, right.

441
00:30:58,591 --> 00:30:59,424
- [Cynthia] Then what?

442
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,257
- Well then,

443
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:01,810
then I'm going to drain
all of the information

444
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,720
out of her brain

445
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,183
and I'm going to present
it as my own work.

446
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,760
Richard can't do anything

447
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,473
'cause he doesn't have the machine.

448
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,303
Well, come on.

449
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,150
I mean, why should we feel bad about it?

450
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,110
I mean, it's not our fault

451
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,613
if she decides she wants to go with us.

452
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:17,350
- No, no, it's not our fault.

453
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,420
- Right.

454
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,763
Showtime, let's go.

455
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:24,524
(suspenseful synth music)

456
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,793
(Professor grunting)

457
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,923
- Do you hear something?

458
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:11,039
(Professor grunting)

459
00:32:16,787 --> 00:32:17,620
- Okay.

460
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:24,760
- No, no, go back to sleep.

461
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,300
- I'm certain I heard someone say, ugh.

462
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,163
Go check.

463
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:31,123
You're pathetic.

464
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,783
Uh-oh.

465
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:43,919
I wonder where she went.

466
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:55,370
(contemplative ambient music)

467
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,060
- Now, Tahra, this won't hurt a bit.

468
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,360
Although after I'm finished
draining every brain wave

469
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,740
in that thick little skull of yours,

470
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,067
I doubt you'll ever be able
to recognize me anyway.

471
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:10,450
- It doesn't sound very nice.

472
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,380
- Nice?

473
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,350
It's not supposed to be nice.

474
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,345
I didn't build this
whole machine to be nice.

475
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:17,428
Now, hand me the headset.

476
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:21,963
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

477
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,733
Switch on.

478
00:33:33,322 --> 00:33:35,210
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

479
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,140
We're getting a picture,
we're getting a picture.

480
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,033
All right, just crank it up a little.

481
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:46,499
(Professor laughing)

482
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:48,613
Oh, excellent, excellent, excellent.

483
00:33:49,852 --> 00:33:51,648
- Aren't you afraid you're gonna fry her?

484
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:52,524
- Shut up.

485
00:33:52,524 --> 00:33:53,630
Do you want to be rich or not?

486
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,463
- Yeah, but.

487
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:55,510
- Then crank it up, baby.

488
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,343
Crank it up.

489
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:02,028
(machinery zapping)

490
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:09,152
- James.

491
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:10,068
- Don't bother me.

492
00:34:10,068 --> 00:34:13,923
- Look at the monitor.

493
00:34:13,923 --> 00:34:16,590
- Ooh, I wonder what that means.

494
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:22,526
(Cynthia screaming)
(intense orchestral music)

495
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:30,275
(phone ringing)

496
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,773
- Hello?

497
00:34:32,773 --> 00:34:34,480
- Richard, it's Cynthia.

498
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,313
- [Richard] Yeah, what's up?

499
00:34:35,313 --> 00:34:36,146
- It's your cave girl.

500
00:34:36,146 --> 00:34:37,810
She's being held prisoner at James's lab

501
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,180
and she ain't alone.

502
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,387
- Is she in danger?

503
00:34:40,387 --> 00:34:41,730
- What do you think, you big dope?

504
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,713
Just hurry up.

505
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,080
- Sharon, it's Tahra!

506
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,930
She's in trouble.

507
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:52,701
(sirens blaring)

508
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:04,647
(machinery beeping)
(Tiko laughing)

509
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,060
Oh dear.

510
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,193
- Oh dear, oh dear.

511
00:35:13,427 --> 00:35:14,777
(machinery beeping)

512
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:16,553
- Mommy, I go poopy.

513
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,640
- We're too late, he's
already gone stupid.

514
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,380
A victim of his own evil machinations.

515
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,663
- Will he ever recover?

516
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,920
- I don't know, maybe in a couple of days,

517
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,470
but this has taught us
a very valuable lesson.

518
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,821
- What's that?

519
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:37,530
- That Tahra and whoever this is

520
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,200
don't belong here in our time.

521
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,520
And as long as they remain,

522
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,510
they'll never be safe from
those like Professor Matthews

523
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,180
or others who would exploit them

524
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,483
for financial gain or worse.

525
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,370
- Don't look at me.

526
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,780
Then what do we do?

527
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,610
- I say, we take them back to the vortex

528
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,720
and let them find their own
way into their savage world.

529
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,420
- You're right, it's the only way.

530
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,160
- Come on now.

531
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,450
Let's go.

532
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,283
Let's go.

533
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,850
Well, one more hour before we have Tahra

534
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,800
and whoever that is back
at their starting point.

535
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,158
- I'm sure that must make them very happy.

536
00:36:22,158 --> 00:36:23,403
- Hey guys, how are you doing back there?

537
00:36:23,403 --> 00:36:25,480
- Maybe I should go check on them.

538
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,396
- Sure.

539
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:28,470
I'll hold down the fort from here.

540
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,670
- You just keep your
eyes on the road, stud.

541
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:39,608
(upbeat reggae music)

542
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,230
- Well, if I remember correctly,

543
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,863
the vortex should be right
around that hillside.

544
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,250
- I think this looks
very familiar to them.

545
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,970
- Come on then, let's go.

546
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,110
Let's go, guys.

547
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,010
You're going home.

548
00:37:50,532 --> 00:37:54,115
(intense orchestral music)

549
00:38:02,743 --> 00:38:04,930
Well, Tahra and whoever this is,

550
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,900
I guess this is goodbye.

551
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,880
I'm sorry for all the
troubles we've caused you.

552
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,273
I hope you guys can understand this.

553
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,373
Well, so long and have
a safe journey home.

554
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:19,865
Bye.

555
00:38:21,683 --> 00:38:22,516
- Come here.

556
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,793
- Oh, oh.

557
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,330
- [Sharon] Don't let the dinosaurs bite.

558
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:49,440
(portal zapping)

559
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,300
- Makes you feel all
warm and toasty inside.

560
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,140
- What, seeing them go back
home to their prehistoric age?

561
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,973
- No.

562
00:38:55,973 --> 00:38:59,088
One giant sustained orgasm.

563
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:01,200
- Oh yeah, baby.

564
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,553
Turn the heat up.

565
00:39:02,553 --> 00:39:03,636
- What, what?

566
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,620
Well, I guess it's time to go, right?

567
00:39:18,043 --> 00:39:19,793
- What the hell was that all about?

568
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,633
- It beats me.

569
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:23,527
I mean, they were trying
to get me to talk,

570
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,550
but I wasn't having any of that.

571
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,930
The brunette was obnoxious enough, right?

572
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,210
- Well, next time, I
pick the vacation spot.

573
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,500
- Oh, so now, it's my fault?

574
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,410
- Yeah, it's your fault.

575
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,243
Who's idea was this?

576
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:34,570
Let's go to prehistoric
times, it'd be a lot of fun.

577
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,403
It's your fault.

578
00:39:35,403 --> 00:39:36,236
- I did not.

579
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:37,430
- You did so say that.

580
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,690
- Shut up.

581
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,273
- Make me.

582
00:39:40,273 --> 00:39:42,790
- Let's just go please.

583
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,653
- Aren't you forgetting something?

584
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:45,486
- Oh.

585
00:39:47,502 --> 00:39:50,252
(portal zapping)

586
00:39:52,614 --> 00:39:53,780
- You know what,

587
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,760
sometimes I think this thing

588
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,080
is more trouble than it's worth.

589
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,225
- You said it.

590
00:39:58,225 --> 00:39:59,142
- Let's go.

591
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:04,161
(suspenseful synth music)

592
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,901
Well, I guess it wasn't that bad.

593
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:08,468
(faint speaking)

594
00:40:08,468 --> 00:40:09,301
- Next time, let's pick something

595
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:10,912
with a little bit more clothes too.

596
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:13,662
(faint speaking)

597
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:25,050
(intense orchestral music)

598
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:34,768
(rhythmic percussion music)

599
00:41:57,479 --> 00:42:01,062
(intense orchestral music)

600
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:19,171
(contemplative gentle music)
