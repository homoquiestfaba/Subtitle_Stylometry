1
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,936
I'm a bit unstable

2
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:27,843
She said with a Cheshire grin

3
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:33,213
So many cracks in my sidewalk, boy

4
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:37,852
Well, don't you fall again

5
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:41,754
Feels like the things that I've wanted

6
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:46,091
The most in this life, I can't have

7
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:51,198
So you see, I've been damning the world

8
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:56,902
Before it damns me

9
00:00:57,002 --> 00:01:00,405
She said I'm naked and shameless

10
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:03,042
And I'm peeling back the layers like

11
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:06,512
An onion girl

12
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:10,316
Don't try to save me, just stay away

13
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:14,353
'Cause I might make you cry

14
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:19,160
Like an onion girl

15
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:37,609
It's my boat.
When I get it fixed up, it's, uh...

16
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:41,879
1964. It's got a mahogany hull.

17
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:45,017
It's racing class.

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,289
God, this place is really depressing.

19
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:54,794
No wonder they're closing it down.

20
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,669
My, uh...

21
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:09,506
My sister's here.

22
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:12,110
Molly.

23
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:17,548
Yes.

24
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:23,356
So... Are you picking up a relative?

25
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,224
With a moo-moo here

26
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:29,994
- Excuse me?
- And a moo-moo there

27
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:33,631
Here a moo, there a moo
Everywhere a moo-moo

28
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:37,335
Old McDonald had a farm

29
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:39,803
E-ya, E-ya-yo.

30
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:42,973
And on his farm he had some pigs

31
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:45,075
- Mr. McKay?
- Yes.

32
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:48,879
I'm Dr. Prentice. I was beginning to
think that maybe you wouldn't show.

33
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:50,399
The other patients left years ago.

34
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:53,117
Yeah, well, I've been kinda busy.
Is he okay?

35
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:56,286
With a moo-moo here
and a moo-moo, mooooo...

36
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,889
He's been very happy here, Mr. McKay.

37
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:00,891
Yeah, I guess ignorance is bliss, right?

38
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:05,395
Of course everyone is a little
agitated about having to leave.

39
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:07,797
An orderly will be
bringing Molly down shortly.

40
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:11,168
However, I thought
we might have a little chat first.

41
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:14,271
Yeah, sure.

42
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:20,812
- E-ya, E-ya-yo.
- Hello, Domingo.

43
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:23,780
We still know very little
about Molly's condition

44
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,116
Every patient is unique.
The way she relates to certain people...

45
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:31,220
even on an emotional level,
suggests an amount of retardation.

46
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,022
In other respects, she's autistic.

47
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:35,357
But over the years
she's become quite higher functioning.

48
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:37,993
Which is why with a little help,
she should be able to adjust...

49
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,729
to life outside an institution like this.

50
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,165
She even has minor
savant-like talents.

51
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,600
I know, she recites stuff "verbatim",
she's Dustin Hoffman.

52
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,602
But the fact is she's pretty much
non-functional, right?

53
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:51,408
In recent years, Mr. McKay,
you haven't spent much time with Molly...

54
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:53,509
So, what I need you to know...

55
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,879
are her basic needs, and how to effect
them, so she can be comfortable and I...

56
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:01,218
- ...can have a life.
- Thank you.

57
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,987
I copied out the daily routine
that Molly feels most comfortable with.

58
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:09,393
That routine is very
important for Molly.

59
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,261
We'll be monitoring her progress
on a daily basis...

60
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:15,765
at least for the next few weeks.

61
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,500
You need to remember that
like many autistic people...

62
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,902
Molly has very acute hearing.

63
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:25,041
Loud noises
can be extremely painful to her.

64
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:34,815
- Hi, Molly.
- Molly, do you remember Buck?

65
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:37,785
- Your brother?
- No.

66
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:42,431
Don't you remember last Christmas, Molly?
I took you out for a walk.

67
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:43,651
No.

68
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:52,802
Well, I guess we should go now.

69
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:58,239
It's okay, here we go.

70
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,344
Mr. McKay, let her go.

71
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:04,848
May I speak with Molly?
Alone?

72
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,621
Molly, come here.

73
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:14,990
Who is this guy?

74
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:16,692
Sam's been with us for
the past couple of years.

75
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:19,694
He has a severe learning disability.

76
00:05:19,794 --> 00:05:22,598
He communicates with Molly
on a level I don't fully understand.

77
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:25,199
Sort of her interpreter...

78
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:28,270
Her guardian angel.

79
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:33,207
- Thank you for your help.
- Bliss, Mr. McKay.

80
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:36,845
Don't hesitate to call.

81
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,791
This is home, Mol.

82
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,568
- Hi, it's Jennifer.
- Asshole.

83
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:04,638
I'm gonna bring around those comps for
tomorrow, but I'm gonna be working late...

84
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,706
so I don't know
at what time I'll get there.

85
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:09,776
Big kiss!

86
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:33,699
Molly wet.

87
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:37,004
- Wet!
- What's wet?

88
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:39,906
Pants!
Molly wet pants...

89
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:42,876
Dr. Prentice, you didn't tell me
she was still wetting herself.

90
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:44,911
This was not part of the deal.

91
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:47,180
It's a reaction to the
breaking of the routine.

92
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,616
Well, how long is
this reaction gonna go on?

93
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:52,885
The sooner she's gonna start,
the sooner this sort of thing will stop.

94
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:54,989
Thanks.

95
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:01,094
Come on. Okay, uh ...

96
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:04,063
- So, are you gonna take 'em off?
- No.

97
00:07:04,163 --> 00:07:08,302
Okay, what am I supposed to do here...

98
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,472
Molly, come on.

99
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:25,752
Hold on for a second, okay?

100
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,754
- Molly hungry?
- Yes, Molly hungry.

101
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:32,757
- Do you like pizza?
- Molly like peas.

102
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:35,093
No, not peas. Pizza.

103
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:39,697
- Peas!
- No, pizza. See?

104
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:43,401
- Pizza.
- Peas!

105
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:46,070
Whatever.

106
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,441
- Peas! Peas!
- Molly, be quiet.

107
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:53,345
Okay now,
what time does the presentation start?

108
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,747
Shit.

109
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:59,717
I thought it was 10:30.
Prescott told me it was 10:30.

110
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:05,457
At what time does daycare open?

111
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:08,093
Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
Alright? Bye.

112
00:08:08,193 --> 00:08:10,728
Pizza.

113
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,697
Starch, modified flour...

114
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:20,004
[ various chemical preservatives
and flavor enhancers used in pizzas ]

115
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:23,407
I've been eating that?

116
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:35,787
Come on, Molly.
Buck's late.

117
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,623
Buck's late.

118
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:42,793
Mol, careful. It's slippery.

119
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:56,105
Come on, Molly.

120
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:06,549
Are you the person in charge here?

121
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:09,017
- Yes, Joyce Leslie.
- Joyce. Right.

122
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:13,689
I'm Buck McKay. 16th floor. My assistant
Brenda called you about unruling Molly.

123
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:16,024
Yes, of course.
Is Molly here?

124
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:18,327
Yeah. She's right here.

125
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:23,803
She's got her bag, and if you need
anything, you have my number.

126
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:26,569
Okay, then. Bye, Mol.

127
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:29,472
Mr. McKay, is this some sort of a joke?

128
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:31,207
- Mr. McKay?
- Yes?

129
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:34,577
- Is this a joke?
- No.

130
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:37,247
This is not a child, Mr. McKay.

131
00:09:37,347 --> 00:09:40,983
I know, but she has the mind of a child.

132
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:46,291
Mr. McKay, we're just not equipped
to handle Molly. I'm sorry. Goodbye.

133
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,665
Bite me.

134
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,406
- You're late, Mr. McKay.
- I know.

135
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:42,476
Ms. Duffy, this is my sister Molly.
Can she sit here, while I...

136
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:46,581
Come on. Sit down. Thank you.

137
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:49,884
Molly, sit down.

138
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:53,889
I'm gonna be right in there, okay?
Wait for me.

139
00:10:55,123 --> 00:10:57,525
There's nothing new
in the juxtaposition of...

140
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,295
contrary images, but in this campaign...

141
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,297
the hula-girl and the Eskimo...

142
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,566
the luau and igloo...

143
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,703
give us unique comic possibilities
for years to come.

144
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:14,103
Now that he's (?) to join us,
let me introduce Buck McKay.

145
00:11:14,203 --> 00:11:15,323
Buck?

146
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,731
Excuse me, may I help you?

147
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:06,024
Molly hot.

148
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:08,560
Hot.

149
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:16,102
The following campaign
reverses the situation...

150
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,538
and plants our favorite igloo
smack in the middle of Redondo Beach.

151
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,774
Polar Pete, of course,
has got his best baggies on...

152
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,843
The wife, Hula,
has got great bikini range.

153
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,845
Possibilities here for infinite varieties.

154
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:30,749
We could have a different swimsuit for
every beach east and west of Wajamea bay.

155
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:34,654
Out they come, Polar Pete and...

156
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,690
Molly hot, Buck.

157
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,213
What's going on in there?

158
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:04,915
- What happened? I was...
- Don't talk.

159
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:07,084
Just get her dressed.
Molly hungry?

160
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:09,720
- Pizza!
- Bren?

161
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,724
You go take her out for pizza
and then take her to my place.

162
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:17,963
Molly, I'll be there as soon
as I can, okay?

163
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:25,736
Oh, my God!

164
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:41,479
- Good morning, Sharon.
- Good morning, Buck.

165
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,883
Georgia.
What's up?

166
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:49,118
- Big trouble.
- What happened?

167
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:53,924
The icecream account went to Beresford
and Weir. Prescott wants to see you.

168
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:56,860
Great.

169
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,004
I put this in the closet...

170
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:12,609
- Mr. McKay, I ...
- It doesn't mean anything, Carmen.

171
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:16,246
I don't know what's wrong with her.

172
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:21,517
Did you talk to your sister
about babysitting Molly?

173
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:26,224
Oh, I don't think she would do it.

174
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:29,759
I know what you mean.

175
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:39,968
Sorry, Bren.

176
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:42,671
It's okay.

177
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:46,709
- Hi, Molly.
- Hi, Molly.

178
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:49,144
- How was it?
- Fine.

179
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:53,081
We watched the "flying monkey" scene
from The Wizard of Oz, like, six times.

180
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:55,783
That's one of her favorites.
Thanks for this.

181
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:58,586
I'm gonna miss you.

182
00:15:58,686 --> 00:16:02,792
- You're a good boss.
- You're a good liar.

183
00:16:05,092 --> 00:16:08,129
- Bye, Molly.
- Bye, Molly.

184
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:12,399
Well, I guess this is it, huh?

185
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:15,436
See you later.

186
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,216
So, I talked with this guy,
he's one of our sponsors,

187
00:16:28,316 --> 00:16:30,785
and he's fine with you working at home.
Write and copy.

188
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:32,987
I don't wanna work part-time at home.
I wanna get out.

189
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:35,757
I understand that, but in the meantime
this will tide you over.

190
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:41,265
I'm living like a hermit.
And when I do go out I feel guilty.

191
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,068
It's okay.

192
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:51,338
Molly, dog.
Look at his eyes, Molly.

193
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:04,484
Oh, Molly, they're toys.
They're not real. It's okay.

194
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:07,020
All she does is channel-surf.

195
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,690
Or she lines up her shoes.

196
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,859
Yeah, it's like living with Imelda Marcos.

197
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,395
And she knows.
She's not completely out of her.

198
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:19,267
She knows I'm gonna be on her stir-crazy.

199
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,796
I've got a surprise for you.

200
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:29,067
You've got a visitor.

201
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:50,254
I'll leave you to it.

202
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,532
She was, huh, reading to me.

203
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:02,333
Robinson Crusoe.

204
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:06,103
It would be great if she had
any idea what it is about.

205
00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:09,642
Oh, you'd be surprised,
Mr. McKay.

206
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:18,850
Look, I've got a job
at the Kerrans Institute.

207
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,684
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

208
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:25,324
Dr. Prentice got me a job.

209
00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:30,178
Actually, he's been
calling up asking, uh...

210
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:34,097
well, recommending Molly for
one of their new programs.

211
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:35,966
Yes.

212
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,868
Really? That sounds good.

213
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,938
I mean, it would be up to you,
of course...

214
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:45,209
But if they...

215
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,913
if they find her suitable...

216
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:53,116
then they'll take her of your hands...

217
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:56,286
for a while, anyway.

218
00:19:56,686 --> 00:20:01,894
I know.
It's hard, Mr. McKay.

219
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:08,165
Anyway, it's a bit
self-serving for me...

220
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:13,436
I have a learning disability.

221
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:20,010
Maybe because of that...

222
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:25,249
we're kind of on the same wavelength.

223
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:30,086
When she reads to me,

224
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:33,223
I see the words...

225
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:37,595
right here in front of me.

226
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,865
There's a real person in there, Mr. McKay.

227
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:45,802
She wants to come out.

228
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:01,850
- Mr. McKay?
- Yes.

229
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,786
- I'm Dr. Brookes.
- Hello.

230
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:07,556
- Hello, Molly.
- Hello, Molly.

231
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:11,092
I've discussed Molly's history
in great detail with Dr. Prentice.

232
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:13,962
Right, he said that she was
an ideal candidate for this program.

233
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:16,798
Well, we need to determine that
now with our own series of tests.

234
00:21:16,898 --> 00:21:20,734
You know, Dr. Brooks, Molly has
some extraordinary talents.

235
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:24,038
The tests actually include
a series of PET scans of Molly's brain...

236
00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:25,725
so, I have some forms
that I need you to fill out.

237
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,425
Oh, sure.

238
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:42,723
We make a tiny incision
in the skull, right here.

239
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:46,394
Using a probe we transplant a set of
genetically re-engineered cells...

240
00:21:46,494 --> 00:21:49,531
hopefully restoring the dormant
area of the brain to partial utilization.

241
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:51,752
Oh, and she would be able to,
you know, like...

242
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,969
I mean, look after herself
on her own, for example?

243
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:56,305
That's a definite possibility.

244
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:59,440
But there's always
a risk in any operation...

245
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,776
and with the brain, those risks involve...

246
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:06,347
stroke, paralysis, motor functions.

247
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:09,017
They're rare, but they do happen.

248
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:14,191
- How rare?
- Perhaps six percent of the cases.

249
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:18,161
Six percent?

250
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:24,165
This has got way out of hand.

251
00:22:24,265 --> 00:22:26,201
I mean, I may be a selfish schmuck,
but you're my sister.

252
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:29,570
- Selfish schmuck.
- This is a life or death issue, Mol.

253
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,889
I mean, you're happy some
of the time, aren't you?

254
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:32,305
No!

255
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:36,846
Am I just wanting this for myself,
because I'm a little inconvenieced?

256
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,019
But it would give you a chance to,
you know, have a better life.

257
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:06,973
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi, Molly.

258
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:11,078
You can undress behind the screen.

259
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:30,264
There he is. Hey, man.
What's the word?

260
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:32,999
- They're still operating.
- How are you?

261
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:38,072
So, we're just gonna hang out here, okay?

262
00:23:45,178 --> 00:23:48,949
- Is everything alright?
- Yeah, she's fine.

263
00:23:54,387 --> 00:23:56,589
How are you doing?

264
00:23:59,357 --> 00:24:02,227
Ouch, huh?

265
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:09,634
Dr. Brookes! Dr. Brookes!

266
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:13,840
What's happening?
What's going on?

267
00:24:16,141 --> 00:24:18,310
- Lorezepam, phenytoin, two-in-one.
- Got it.

268
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,212
Mr. McKay, get out of here, please.

269
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:24,182
Thank you.

270
00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:28,788
Lita, I'd like to see Dr. Simmons in here.

271
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:32,590
Dr. Simmons, ICU staff.
Dr. Simmons, ICU staff.

272
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,526
It's okay, Molly.

273
00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:49,774
I just got off work.

274
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:54,745
- She had some kind of seizure.
- Yes, I heard.

275
00:24:54,845 --> 00:24:57,915
- But it's gonna be okay.
- What makes you so sure?

276
00:24:58,015 --> 00:25:04,659
Mr. McKay, sometimes
I have a sense of things...

277
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:09,796
and I feel something
extraordinary is gonna happen.

278
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,119
Mr. McKay?

279
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:17,035
She's resting now.

280
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:20,504
We have no idea what
caused that reaction.

281
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:23,440
Well, that sounds familiar.

282
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,076
She's alright now.

283
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:29,614
She could've died, right?

284
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,525
I'm not going to sleep with you.

285
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:43,026
I'm not planning on either
of us getting much sleep.

286
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:45,328
And I'm certainly
not gonna sleep in that bed...

287
00:25:45,428 --> 00:25:47,972
not without giving the mattress
a good airing first.

288
00:25:48,072 --> 00:25:48,731
Hi.

289
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:51,467
I slept on the couch.
You can ask Fiona.

290
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:54,470
Alright. I will.

291
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:56,707
Fiona!

292
00:25:56,808 --> 00:25:58,567
Molly, are you ready
for some more tests?

293
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,187
No!

294
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,013
Our projections show...

295
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:07,383
that the red dot should
now be about the size of a dime.

296
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,453
I'm afraid the grafted cells didn't take.

297
00:26:10,553 --> 00:26:12,288
So, what happens next?

298
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:16,159
In a a few weeks we'd like to try again.

299
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:18,361
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

300
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:21,264
- After what happened last night?
- Buck, we're breaking new grounds here.

301
00:26:21,364 --> 00:26:22,831
We learned so much from
the last procedure.

302
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:26,436
Yeah, by drilling into people's heads
like they're lab rats.

303
00:26:26,736 --> 00:26:28,904
My sister nearly died.

304
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:33,243
I'm not let her go through
something like that again.

305
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,622
God damn it, son of a bitch.

306
00:26:47,722 --> 00:26:50,225
Son of a bitch.

307
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:53,762
- God damn, son of a bitch.
- God damn, son of a bitch.

308
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,701
- Son of a bitch!
- Son of a bitch!

309
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:09,711
- Molly cold.
- Yeah, I know you're cold, Molly.

310
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,746
- Molly cold.
- Yeah, I know you're cold...

311
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:14,916
but the car won't start, okay?

312
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:18,085
- Molly cold.
- Come on, you son of a bitch.

313
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:21,489
Would you shut up? Shut up, Molly!
Just... God damn it...

314
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:25,227
I didn't ask for any...
I didn't ask for you... So just shut up!

315
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,846
I'm sorry, Molly.

316
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:48,883
I'm sorry.

317
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:57,525
Somewhere over the rainbow

318
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:03,030
Bluebirds fly

319
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,198
Birds fly

320
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:09,169
over the rainbow

321
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:12,172
Why am

322
00:28:12,272 --> 00:28:14,241
oh, why

323
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:20,049
can't I?

324
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,506
- Nothing good on, hey, Mol?
- Nothing good on, hey?

325
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:50,924
Let's go for a ride.
Do you wanna go for a ride?

326
00:28:51,024 --> 00:28:52,144
No!

327
00:28:53,312 --> 00:28:56,682
There's nothing wrong
with your television set.

328
00:28:56,782 --> 00:29:00,152
Do not attempt to adjust the picture.

329
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:02,855
We are controlling the transmission.

330
00:29:02,955 --> 00:29:05,490
You are about to experience the awe...

331
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,262
and the mystery which reaches
from the inner mind to...

332
00:29:10,362 --> 00:29:13,566
the outer limits.

333
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:43,061
What do you think?

334
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:47,965
Looks like the Milky Way
just fell out of the sky...

335
00:29:48,065 --> 00:29:52,303
Four million, eight hundred thousand...

336
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:55,440
three hundred and two.

337
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,442
What?

338
00:29:57,542 --> 00:30:00,144
Stars.

339
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:18,562
Here it is. The list. "Thee" list.

340
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:20,931
- Can you say "the list"?
- No.

341
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:22,018
It's okay, you don't have to.

342
00:30:22,118 --> 00:30:25,803
Okay, the plan is while I look for a job,
you'll become self-suficient.

343
00:30:25,903 --> 00:30:28,205
- Cool, huh?
- No. Hot!

344
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:31,309
Yeah. Okay, this is a list of
of things you need to learn.

345
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:32,925
- Do you understand?
- No.

346
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:33,679
Good.

347
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:35,680
Now, you can see I've divided it
into the basics.

348
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,122
We have personal hygiene,
recreation, and eating. Hmmm...

349
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:46,358
Now, every time you complete a task, we put
a check mark in the box beside it, you see?

350
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:47,578
No!

351
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:54,465
Now, when you get all the boxes checked
you're gonna take a trip in Buck's boat.

352
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:56,534
Let's try it. Okay.

353
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:59,671
- What is your name?
- Molly!

354
00:31:00,437 --> 00:31:03,240
That is fabulous!
You see, now...

355
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,843
I'm making a big red check mark...

356
00:31:05,943 --> 00:31:09,980
in the box beside
"Says name when asked".

357
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,716
Okay, next.
Where do you live?

358
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:14,517
- Here!
- Absolutely correct...

359
00:31:14,617 --> 00:31:18,223
but you need to learn your
actual address to get a checkmark.

360
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,327
Tying shoes?
That's getting a little...

361
00:31:23,427 --> 00:31:25,462
Yes! Tie shoes.

362
00:31:25,662 --> 00:31:28,097
Alright.
Tying shoes it is.

363
00:31:28,197 --> 00:31:30,332
Okay, you take the two ends...

364
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:35,806
and make the incredibly difficult
and death-defying overhand knot.

365
00:31:35,906 --> 00:31:39,076
- Molly tries.
- Molly...

366
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:48,519
Right, you've made the loop. Good.
What do you do after that?

367
00:31:48,785 --> 00:31:54,657
Go around the loop. Remember:
Nobody's ever done this on their first try.

368
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:55,958
Okay, try again, try again.

369
00:31:56,058 --> 00:31:59,229
Okay, what do we do first?

370
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:08,471
- We'll try again tomorrow, okay?
- No.

371
00:32:08,571 --> 00:32:12,109
Go to bed.
Sleep tight.

372
00:32:43,238 --> 00:32:46,475
The wonderful things he does.

373
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:50,077
We're off to see the Wizard.

374
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,647
The wonderful Wizard of Oz.

375
00:32:52,747 --> 00:32:56,485
Go! Now, jump!

376
00:32:56,652 --> 00:33:00,722
We're off to see the Wizard.
The wonderful Wizard of Oz.

377
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:04,427
We're off...

378
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,229
Mr. McKay!

379
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:12,269
Go on, dance.

380
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:45,292
Oh, shit...

381
00:34:57,636 --> 00:35:00,539
My name is Molly McKay.

382
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:06,378
I live at 200 Mildred Avenue,
Venice, California...

383
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:10,183
90291.

384
00:35:16,554 --> 00:35:19,591
If you look over to the last image,
that's... that's present...

385
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:22,561
and we had no idea that
there would be that amount of cell growth.

386
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:26,097
I'm a bit unstable

387
00:35:26,197 --> 00:35:30,570
She said with a Cheshire grin

388
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:36,474
So many cracks in my sidewalk, boy

389
00:35:36,574 --> 00:35:41,181
Well, don't you fall again

390
00:35:41,512 --> 00:35:44,549
She said I'm naked and shameless

391
00:35:44,649 --> 00:35:48,420
And I'm peeling back the layers like

392
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,922
An onion girl

393
00:35:51,022 --> 00:35:54,793
Don't try to save me, just stay away

394
00:35:54,893 --> 00:35:58,896
'Cause I might make you cry

395
00:35:58,996 --> 00:36:03,000
Like an onion girl

396
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,537
I think it's going to rain.

397
00:36:06,637 --> 00:36:13,611
- Yes, it's getting darker by the minute.
- Yes, it's getting darker by the minute.

398
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:19,282
- Was that a flash of lightning?
- Was that a flash of lightning?

399
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:22,820
Lightning?

400
00:36:22,986 --> 00:36:24,955
Flash of...

401
00:36:25,055 --> 00:36:27,825
lightning.

402
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:32,563
Lightning.

403
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:40,036
But I needed
none of all this precaution...

404
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:44,039
for never man had a more
faithful, loving, sincere servant...

405
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:46,208
than Friday was to me.

406
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:50,112
Without passion, solemnace or design...

407
00:36:50,212 --> 00:36:52,948
perfectly applied and engaged...

408
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:57,288
his very affections were tied to me...

409
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:01,791
as those of a child to a father...

410
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:04,894
and I dare say he would've
sacrificed his life...

411
00:37:04,994 --> 00:37:10,635
for the saving of mine,
on any occasion whatsoever.

412
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:22,546
Hello, Buck.

413
00:38:07,422 --> 00:38:10,358
Why do they put
"died" people in the ground?

414
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,860
- Dead people.
- "Dead" people.

415
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,863
It's a religious ritual.

416
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:19,500
- There are a lot of people in the world.
- Yes.

417
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,805
Well, if they all die, then eventually
the world's gonna be one big cemetery.

418
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:27,507
That's a good point.

419
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:29,811
Some people are cremated.

420
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:33,715
- Cremated?
- Burnt.

421
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:38,419
They're dead.
It doesn't hurt.

422
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:41,054
How do you know?

423
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:44,593
That's a good question.

424
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,800
I wish I knew how they we're like.

425
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,739
Yeah, but they say they're
in a better place now.

426
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:01,010
Ground is not a better place, Buck.

427
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:11,685
You know, before, I lived in a hospital...

428
00:39:11,785 --> 00:39:17,462
- Well, it was more like a home.
- Yeah, for people like me.

429
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:24,467
And you waited until you had room...
and then you came to get me?

430
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:27,534
Yeah.

431
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:33,040
You see, the home got its
money from the government.

432
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,080
And one day the government
just decided to close it down.

433
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:43,718
Do you think they can feel us
lying on them?

434
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:48,688
Maybe.

435
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:12,047
- I'm really glad we're getting out.
- Yeah!

436
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,514
I'm changing.

437
00:40:14,614 --> 00:40:17,750
I have all these emotions
that I don't really understand.

438
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,252
There are some things that I
wanted to talk to you about.

439
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:21,855
What things?

440
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:25,725
- I'm getting smarter by the minute.
- Oh, that's nothing to worry about.

441
00:40:25,825 --> 00:40:29,328
- Yeah, I'm reading a lot of books.
- That's a good thing.

442
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:31,864
My vocabulary is growing exponentially.

443
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:35,569
- Good word!
- Thank you.

444
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:39,539
What's a blowjob?

445
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,949
It's right here.

446
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:07,733
Hey, batter, batter, batter!
Safe!

447
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,369
Yes!

448
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,371
- Go, Dodgers!
- Go, Dodgers!

449
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:27,086
- Come on, baby!
- Come on, baby!

450
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:33,326
- Yeah. High inside.
- High inside.

451
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:35,726
- Hey, are you hungry?
- Yes.

452
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,795
- Right, stay here to watch the game.
- Wait.

453
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,298
- I don't understand the game yet.
- Okay.

454
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:43,269
See that guy there?
He throws the ball to the guy right there...

455
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,637
who tries to hit it with the bat.

456
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:48,773
- The bat.
- And if he does, he has to run to the base...

457
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,642
before those guys can throw the ball
to the base...

458
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:53,778
and if he touches the base
before the ball arrives, he's safe.

459
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,446
- Safe.
- Safe.

460
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,816
Safe from what?

461
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,987
- From being out.
- Out of what?

462
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:06,824
I'll explain when I get back.

463
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:09,593
It's a weird game, Buck, but I like it.

464
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,895
Yes!

465
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:15,298
Go, baby!

466
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:25,976
- Safe!
- You dumb shithead! He was out by a mile!

467
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,211
- Sit down!
- The man dropped the ball!

468
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:32,015
- What, you've got binoculars on your ass?
- No.

469
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:36,051
- What are you, some kind of retard?
- I'm an irregular retard. And you?

470
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:39,323
- Wise ass.
- A wise ass retard...

471
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:44,561
- I'm not familiar with that.
- What's going on?

472
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:48,833
I'm having a disagreement
with that wise ass retard.

473
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:54,838
Look at them go. Man, I wish
I could hear what they were saying.

474
00:42:54,938 --> 00:42:57,740
Come on. What's going on?

475
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,376
Who are you? Ray Charles?
He was out by ten feet!

476
00:43:00,476 --> 00:43:03,979
- He was out by ten feet.
- He dropped the ball, dicknose.

477
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,081
He dropped the ball, dicknose.

478
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:08,917
- Ten feet!
- You dropped the ball.

479
00:43:09,017 --> 00:43:13,788
Get out of my face!
No, you get out of my face!

480
00:43:14,688 --> 00:43:17,593
Your breath smells like the
shithouse door on a tuna boat!

481
00:43:17,693 --> 00:43:20,429
Oh, my God!

482
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:26,836
This is the best part of the game so far.

483
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,607
- That was a great game.
- Would you take me again?

484
00:43:32,707 --> 00:43:34,976
Absolutely.

485
00:43:35,076 --> 00:43:38,815
You're the best brother
in the whole world.

486
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:44,852
I'd like to wake up with you
in the morning...

487
00:43:44,952 --> 00:43:49,958
feel the stubble on your chin...
your hot breath against my cheek...

488
00:43:50,058 --> 00:43:53,562
- What?
- We're brother and sister.

489
00:43:53,862 --> 00:43:56,397
So?

490
00:43:57,698 --> 00:44:01,136
We'll talk about it later.

491
00:44:08,877 --> 00:44:11,279
Brothers ans sisters cannot get married.

492
00:44:11,379 --> 00:44:13,214
Why not?

493
00:44:13,314 --> 00:44:15,717
Because that's the way that things are.

494
00:44:15,817 --> 00:44:18,119
Why?

495
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:19,954
There are scientific reasons.

496
00:44:20,054 --> 00:44:23,357
People with the same genes can't...
you can't mix 'em.

497
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:25,392
We don't have the same jeans...

498
00:44:25,492 --> 00:44:28,597
or even wear jeans.

499
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,998
It's a different meaning.
It's G-E-N-E-S.

500
00:44:32,098 --> 00:44:36,002
- It's a different spelling.
- Oh, I know that, then..

501
00:44:36,202 --> 00:44:40,307
Genes provide the blueprint
for what organisms become.

502
00:44:40,507 --> 00:44:44,878
- Where did you get that from?
- I read a lot of scientific books.

503
00:44:44,978 --> 00:44:47,347
As Jackie Collins.

504
00:44:47,747 --> 00:44:51,584
So... what can
brothers and sisters do...

505
00:44:51,784 --> 00:44:55,823
if they like each other a lot?

506
00:44:56,156 --> 00:45:00,128
They can be friends for life.

507
00:45:00,526 --> 00:45:05,501
- That's all?
- That's a lot.

508
00:45:08,234 --> 00:45:11,772
How come we weren't friends before?

509
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:18,813
I guess we didn't know
each other that well.

510
00:45:21,113 --> 00:45:23,115
You wanna dance?

511
00:45:23,215 --> 00:45:25,418
No. This is not a place where you dance.

512
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:28,188
Yes, it is.

513
00:45:32,892 --> 00:45:34,894
Molly, sit down.

514
00:45:35,094 --> 00:45:37,863
- Come on.
- Molly...

515
00:45:37,963 --> 00:45:40,901
Come on. Sit down.

516
00:45:52,577 --> 00:45:55,515
- Dance with me.
- No.

517
00:46:12,063 --> 00:46:14,465
Race you to the door!

518
00:46:14,565 --> 00:46:18,137
I'm right behind you!

519
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,773
- Careful.
- I won.

520
00:46:21,873 --> 00:46:23,607
- Hi, Molly.
- Hi, Jim.

521
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:26,477
Mr. McKay, Dr. Brookes wanted
to see you in her office when you got in.

522
00:46:26,577 --> 00:46:29,480
Thanks, Jim.

523
00:46:32,717 --> 00:46:34,952
- You cheated.
- I do not cheat.

524
00:46:35,152 --> 00:46:38,924
- Bye.
- Good night.

525
00:46:45,395 --> 00:46:48,399
- She's supposed to be in bed by eight.
- Yes, I'm trapped.

526
00:46:48,499 --> 00:46:50,401
She asked me to marry her.

527
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:53,004
- What did you say?
- No.

528
00:46:53,104 --> 00:46:56,007
Stop it, Buck. Okay? Please?
This is not funny.

529
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:59,010
This is the first time that anybody
has gone through something like this...

530
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:03,080
and we have no idea how
she's gonna react to all those stimuli.

531
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:06,116
We just have to take things very slowly.

532
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:10,388
I'm sorry. She's wonderful.

533
00:47:12,923 --> 00:47:15,993
I'm gonna thank you for...

534
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:18,996
giving her to me.

535
00:47:19,196 --> 00:47:21,531
Thank you.

536
00:47:22,165 --> 00:47:26,003
For the first time in my life, I feel...

537
00:47:26,103 --> 00:47:29,373
kind of blessed, I guess.

538
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:36,146
Thank you.

539
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:49,526
You haven't said how it was today.

540
00:47:49,626 --> 00:47:52,362
I don't know how much she remembers.

541
00:47:52,462 --> 00:47:55,465
Well, ask her.

542
00:48:05,942 --> 00:48:10,680
So that gives a complete analysis of
the components of the blood, right?

543
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,484
That's right.
Where did you find out about this?

544
00:48:14,584 --> 00:48:17,620
All these books up here.

545
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,723
Now, when I play them back,
I can finally understand them.

546
00:48:20,823 --> 00:48:23,493
How do you mean "Play them back"?

547
00:48:23,593 --> 00:48:26,363
They're like videos.

548
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:30,199
Where did you read all these books?
At the home?

549
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:33,871
Every book on Dr. Prentice's shelf.

550
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,642
So, did you have a nice time
with Buck last night?

551
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:42,681
Yes, i did. Thanks.

552
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,605
The old room 306.

553
00:49:09,871 --> 00:49:11,773
Hello, Lauris.

554
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:14,175
What ever are you doing here, James?

555
00:49:14,275 --> 00:49:17,479
What do you think he's doing there,
Lauris? Guessing your weight?

556
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,815
Duh!

557
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,984
Hi, Molly.
Wanna go shopping?

558
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:25,521
Oh, no. I can't.

559
00:49:30,525 --> 00:49:34,194
- Are you going out?
- Yeah, I'm going out with Sam.

560
00:49:34,294 --> 00:49:36,965
- Do I look weird?
- No, you look good.

561
00:49:37,065 --> 00:49:39,334
- Let me say you something.
- What?

562
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,837
Well...

563
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,939
I'm gonna take these off.

564
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:46,608
- Why?
- Because you already have eyelashes...

565
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:49,511
and they're perfectly beautiful
just the way they are.

566
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:53,348
See, Molly, the purpose of makeup
is to accentuate your strong points.

567
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,683
But I don't have any strong points.

568
00:49:55,783 --> 00:49:58,953
- Yes, you do.
- No, my eyes are too close together.

569
00:49:59,053 --> 00:50:01,789
- I look like a baboon.
- You do not look like a baboon.

570
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:03,791
Yeah, I do, I do.

571
00:50:03,891 --> 00:50:06,794
I saw them on TV.
Probably my great-great-grandfather.

572
00:50:06,894 --> 00:50:08,481
Why do you say that?

573
00:50:08,581 --> 00:50:10,465
Because we are descendents
from them, aren't we?

574
00:50:10,765 --> 00:50:13,400
We'd probably have big blue
bottoms, who would grow bigger...

575
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,836
when we wanted to have sex.

576
00:50:15,936 --> 00:50:21,008
Our bottoms do tend to get bigger
but not just when we want to have sex.

577
00:50:21,108 --> 00:50:24,045
Unfortunately...
Okay, that's great.

578
00:50:25,912 --> 00:50:29,082
Oh, my God! He's early!

579
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:30,684
Come in.

580
00:50:30,784 --> 00:50:33,587
- Hi, Dr. Trehare.
- Hi, Sam.

581
00:50:33,687 --> 00:50:35,188
Is Molly here?

582
00:50:35,288 --> 00:50:38,191
Yeah! I... She's...

583
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:41,094
Why don't you...
Why don't you, uh, have a seat?

584
00:50:41,194 --> 00:50:45,066
Alright...

585
00:51:01,281 --> 00:51:05,721
Wow, Sam...
What ever are you doing?

586
00:51:06,086 --> 00:51:09,758
I thought we were going for a walk.

587
00:51:15,929 --> 00:51:19,934
Oh, yes, I do believe you are correct.

588
00:51:25,438 --> 00:51:28,542
Tra la la.

589
00:51:41,286 --> 00:51:44,123
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

590
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:09,047
- Sam?
- Yes?

591
00:52:09,981 --> 00:52:12,984
Do you like me?

592
00:52:17,321 --> 00:52:21,093
Yeah, I like you.

593
00:52:22,494 --> 00:52:28,667
Well then, how come you never...
kiss me?

594
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:32,737
Well, I... Uh...

595
00:52:33,137 --> 00:52:36,373
'Cause, you know, when people
like each other, they're supposed to kiss.

596
00:52:36,473 --> 00:52:39,010
Well, yeah.

597
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,712
I guess so...

598
00:52:40,812 --> 00:52:43,748
- I know how to do it.
- You do?

599
00:52:43,848 --> 00:52:45,683
Yeah.

600
00:52:45,783 --> 00:52:48,186
Well, I know how to...
I know that...

601
00:52:48,286 --> 00:52:51,189
Wanna do it?

602
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:55,228
Well, I mean, it's not
that I... that...

603
00:53:05,168 --> 00:53:07,705
Wait. Okay.

604
00:53:07,805 --> 00:53:10,775
- What?
- Nothing.

605
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,494
What?

606
00:53:15,594 --> 00:53:17,714
I'm just... Uh...

607
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:22,853
Let me go to work.

608
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,258
- Bye.
- See you.

609
00:53:29,024 --> 00:53:30,593
See you.

610
00:53:30,693 --> 00:53:33,062
Bye.

611
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:49,195
Sam?

612
00:53:49,295 --> 00:53:51,047
- Yeah?
- Are you alright?

613
00:53:51,147 --> 00:53:54,952
Yes, I'm fine, uh, Dr. Brookes.

614
00:53:55,252 --> 00:53:59,825
Just a little anxious, that's all.

615
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,994
Scarlett got you on the run, huh?

616
00:54:05,294 --> 00:54:08,798
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
It's just... That's gone...

617
00:54:08,898 --> 00:54:11,634
A little bit of lipstick.

618
00:54:19,308 --> 00:54:21,976
- Hello?
- Jackie Collins is right, you know?

619
00:54:22,076 --> 00:54:24,079
There is an epidemic going on.

620
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:25,281
Of what?

621
00:54:25,381 --> 00:54:28,317
Beverly's boyfriend is sleeping
with half the women in town...

622
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:31,786
And Susan is cheating on you... with Sam.

623
00:54:31,886 --> 00:54:34,556
What?

624
00:54:35,123 --> 00:54:38,627
- Hello, Molly.
- Hello, Molly.

625
00:54:39,127 --> 00:54:41,462
Is something wrong?
A problem?

626
00:54:41,562 --> 00:54:45,300
- Problem.
- Something needs airing?

627
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,668
No, the only thing that needs
airing is your mattress.

628
00:54:47,768 --> 00:54:49,938
- Molly, what...
- Do you think I don't know?

629
00:54:50,038 --> 00:54:51,872
You just stay away from him, you slut!

630
00:54:51,972 --> 00:54:53,259
- Molly...
- Isn't it enough that you're trapping...

631
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,143
my brother into a
meaningless relationship?

632
00:54:55,243 --> 00:54:57,430
- What?
- If I ever see you near Sam again...

633
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,914
- I swear to God...
- Molly, you're being jealous.

634
00:55:00,014 --> 00:55:02,383
- I am not being jealous!
- It's okay.

635
00:55:02,483 --> 00:55:04,552
It's a normal adolescent emotion.

636
00:55:04,652 --> 00:55:06,554
I am not an adolescent!

637
00:55:06,754 --> 00:55:08,857
I am a 28-year-old woman!

638
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:11,092
God, why can't you understand that?

639
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:14,696
Why can't you understand that?

640
00:55:34,147 --> 00:55:36,751
Molly, it's okay.

641
00:55:37,985 --> 00:55:40,922
We've all been there.

642
00:55:46,893 --> 00:55:52,665
I just felt... like... before...

643
00:55:52,765 --> 00:55:55,569
Before?

644
00:55:55,735 --> 00:55:58,839
Before you fixed my brain.

645
00:56:21,728 --> 00:56:24,565
Hello, Domingo.

646
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:28,736
- Thank you, Sam.
- Sure, Janet.

647
00:56:45,218 --> 00:56:47,054
- Sorry about yesterday.
- Me too.

648
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:48,655
- Yeah.
- Me too.

649
00:56:49,055 --> 00:56:51,191
I know I was a little weird.

650
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:54,328
No, I was... uh...

651
00:56:55,094 --> 00:56:58,766
I just hope we don't
have to be embarrassed.

652
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,336
I mean, it's still us, right?

653
00:57:03,436 --> 00:57:06,238
Yeah.

654
00:57:06,338 --> 00:57:09,543
Whatever happens, it's...

655
00:57:13,312 --> 00:57:16,249
Whenever you're ready.
Not now.

656
00:57:17,416 --> 00:57:21,520
Whenever you feel ready,
then... you can kiss me.

657
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:25,157
Would you kiss me back?

658
00:57:26,091 --> 00:57:28,527
Absolutely.

659
00:57:32,731 --> 00:57:35,868
- At what time do you get off work?
- Two o'clock.

660
00:57:35,968 --> 00:57:38,203
- Would you be my date?
- Yeah.

661
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,205
Good.

662
00:57:40,305 --> 00:57:43,375
- Bye.
- Bye.

663
00:57:51,983 --> 00:57:55,755
The forbidden fruit, I think.

664
00:57:57,423 --> 00:58:00,493
- You smell like an animal.
- Thank you.

665
00:58:00,593 --> 00:58:04,765
These are a more
youthful kind of perfume.

666
00:58:10,235 --> 00:58:12,270
Do you like it?

667
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,872
Nham nham...

668
00:58:27,018 --> 00:58:29,120
Well, that's our entire range.

669
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,591
Which one did you like the best?

670
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:39,465
We'll... think about it.

671
00:58:47,638 --> 00:58:49,973
Eyes...

672
00:58:50,073 --> 00:58:52,276
Look your last...

673
00:58:52,376 --> 00:58:54,645
And lips...

674
00:58:54,745 --> 00:58:57,648
Oh, you, the doors of breath...

675
00:58:57,748 --> 00:59:01,152
sealed with a righteous kiss.

676
00:59:10,393 --> 00:59:14,098
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.

677
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:18,702
Romeo, stop! She's...

678
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:21,037
She's asleep.
She's not even dead.

679
00:59:21,137 --> 00:59:24,442
She's just asleep!
Stop!

680
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:28,480
Juliette, wake up!
Wake up!

681
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:30,146
See? She's okay.

682
00:59:30,246 --> 00:59:32,215
Jeff, can you give us a hand here?

683
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:37,386
- I got it. It's okay.
- What are they supposed to do?

684
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:40,756
She almost knocked my teeth out.

685
00:59:40,856 --> 00:59:43,526
Are you alright?

686
00:59:43,926 --> 00:59:46,629
- What's wrong?
- Are you alright?

687
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,036
It's okay, we got it.

688
00:59:53,736 --> 00:59:55,705
At the beginning,
I knew it was a play...

689
00:59:55,805 --> 00:59:58,207
but it became very real.

690
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:01,760
I would love to be in love like that.
Wouldn't you?

691
01:00:01,861 --> 01:00:02,712
Absolutely!

692
01:00:02,812 --> 01:00:05,114
So passionate...

693
01:00:05,214 --> 01:00:07,783
Here nobody ever says
how they feel about anything.

694
01:00:07,883 --> 01:00:09,785
I mean,
look at those two people over there.

695
01:00:09,885 --> 01:00:12,754
They have not said a word
to each other since they sat down.

696
01:00:12,854 --> 01:00:15,024
- Look at them!
- Shhh!

697
01:00:15,124 --> 01:00:18,527
Well, they're obviously angry at each other.
Why don't they just say something?

698
01:00:18,627 --> 01:00:20,695
I just wish they would scream.

699
01:00:20,795 --> 01:00:24,499
Well, if everybody screamed when they wanted
to, the whole world would be a mad house.

700
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:26,434
At least it would be more honest.

701
01:00:26,534 --> 01:00:31,809
- Sir?
- I'll have the mussels and the tornados.

702
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:33,541
Medium-rare.

703
01:00:33,941 --> 01:00:35,876
Madam?

704
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:38,412
Molly, and what's your name?

705
01:00:38,512 --> 01:00:41,283
Uh, Richard. Have you chosen?

706
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:44,519
I'm gonna have the mud cake...

707
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:46,821
chocolate mud cake
and then the key lime pie.

708
01:00:46,921 --> 01:00:48,323
Uh-hm, and to begin?

709
01:00:48,823 --> 01:00:51,326
I'm gonna have the chocolate mud cake...

710
01:00:51,426 --> 01:00:54,596
and then the key lime pie.

711
01:00:56,465 --> 01:00:57,900
Sir?

712
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,169
- Sir?
- Yes?

713
01:01:01,469 --> 01:01:02,671
Order?

714
01:01:02,771 --> 01:01:05,173
I'd like a coffee.

715
01:01:05,273 --> 01:01:07,775
And?

716
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:11,112
Uh... Black.

717
01:01:13,181 --> 01:01:15,616
Yeah.

718
01:01:15,849 --> 01:01:20,154
Sam, aren't you hungry?
I'm starving.

719
01:01:20,254 --> 01:01:23,358
No, coffee's fine. Thank you.

720
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:26,393
Sam, it's okay, I'm treating.
Seriously.

721
01:01:26,493 --> 01:01:29,730
I know the prices here are outrageous
but that's why I do the stuff I do.

722
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:33,166
So we can come to places like this.

723
01:01:36,203 --> 01:01:39,640
Coffee's gonna be just fine
for me, thanks.

724
01:01:40,562 --> 01:01:42,082
Okay...

725
01:01:54,954 --> 01:01:58,258
Molly, is something wrong?

726
01:01:59,692 --> 01:02:02,261
There was just a silence.

727
01:02:02,361 --> 01:02:05,332
I screamed for all of us.

728
01:02:05,432 --> 01:02:09,638
Sam doesn't want any food.

729
01:02:13,906 --> 01:02:16,342
I thought Romeo was beautiful.

730
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:19,478
Yeah, and Juliette was,
uh, not bad either.

731
01:02:19,878 --> 01:02:22,582
How are these for size?

732
01:02:25,652 --> 01:02:28,133
Oh, my God!
Sam, get that one!

733
01:02:28,233 --> 01:02:28,655
Okay!

734
01:02:28,755 --> 01:02:31,792
They can't breathe out of the water!

735
01:02:34,493 --> 01:02:38,933
- Go away from me!
- Please, go back to your table.

736
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:42,903
They are choking!

737
01:02:44,169 --> 01:02:46,672
Are you alright, Sam?

738
01:02:46,772 --> 01:02:50,377
Audrey, I could use some help.

739
01:02:53,379 --> 01:02:54,879
Sorry.

740
01:02:55,579 --> 01:02:58,820
We will pay for the dry
cleaning of that dress...

741
01:02:59,851 --> 01:03:03,487
- I'll drink to that.
- Those lobsters live in a tank.

742
01:03:03,587 --> 01:03:05,724
They're someone's pets.

743
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:09,094
Why would you eat someone's pets?

744
01:03:09,627 --> 01:03:14,165
Well, Molly, I didn't think of it that way
but I'll try to do better next time.

745
01:03:14,265 --> 01:03:16,800
Thank you.

746
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:21,973
Buck, would you dance with me?

747
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:26,476
Why not?

748
01:03:47,498 --> 01:03:50,401
Sam dances well, doesn't he?

749
01:03:50,501 --> 01:03:53,571
Sam is great.

750
01:03:54,137 --> 01:03:59,076
- Would you like him as a brother-in-law?
- I'd be honored.

751
01:03:59,176 --> 01:04:01,245
Good.

752
01:04:01,345 --> 01:04:05,015
You're gonna have to give me away.

753
01:04:05,115 --> 01:04:08,085
Dad says it's okay.

754
01:04:08,552 --> 01:04:10,020
Dad?

755
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,855
Yeah.

756
01:04:11,955 --> 01:04:17,160
I talk to them in my dreams.
They're not in the ground anymore.

757
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:20,030
Once you die...

758
01:04:20,296 --> 01:04:23,266
at least you don't get any older.

759
01:04:23,633 --> 01:04:26,570
That's one good thing.

760
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:31,743
- Are you sure you wanna see this?
- Yeah, I do.

761
01:04:48,657 --> 01:04:51,895
Honey, do you wanna give
your present to Mol?

762
01:04:51,995 --> 01:04:54,430
Buck!

763
01:04:58,568 --> 01:05:01,672
- Come on over, Buck.
- Come on, sweety.

764
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:03,706
It's real nice and soft.

765
01:05:04,006 --> 01:05:06,076
Guess, Mol?

766
01:05:06,276 --> 01:05:11,651
What's this for Mol?
I wonder what it is.

767
01:05:11,881 --> 01:05:14,184
What is it? Sweet!

768
01:05:14,284 --> 01:05:16,986
It's a bunny, Molly.

769
01:05:17,086 --> 01:05:19,923
Sweetheart, look at the bunny!

770
01:05:20,624 --> 01:05:23,460
Look at that little soft bunny.

771
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,762
Oh, it's the cutest little bunny.

772
01:05:25,862 --> 01:05:29,901
Buck, come over to the table.
Come on.

773
01:05:54,056 --> 01:05:57,259
In the world where I come from...

774
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:00,296
nothing is predictable.

775
01:06:00,963 --> 01:06:04,299
And sometimes everything's
crowding in on you.

776
01:06:04,399 --> 01:06:07,735
So you have to hunch in
on something small...

777
01:06:07,835 --> 01:06:11,740
and certain... and safe...

778
01:06:12,474 --> 01:06:15,177
In your world...

779
01:06:15,277 --> 01:06:18,515
almost everything's controlled.

780
01:06:19,415 --> 01:06:22,250
But for us, it's all jumble.

781
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:26,122
And sometimes you just have to scream.

782
01:06:27,189 --> 01:06:29,557
So people look at you strangely...

783
01:06:29,657 --> 01:06:33,396
and talk about you as if
you're not even there.

784
01:06:33,561 --> 01:06:38,902
But you always know what they're saying.

785
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:44,339
They get very upset when you scream.

786
01:06:44,939 --> 01:06:50,044
But often I know that they would
just like to scream themselves.

787
01:06:50,344 --> 01:06:53,780
I think that's what I find
most strange about this world.

788
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,454
It's that nobody ever says how they feel.

789
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:01,822
They hurt...

790
01:07:01,922 --> 01:07:05,192
but they don't cry out.

791
01:07:05,292 --> 01:07:07,361
They're happy...

792
01:07:07,461 --> 01:07:10,230
but they don't dance...

793
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:14,203
or jump around.

794
01:07:16,069 --> 01:07:17,904
And they're angry...

795
01:07:18,004 --> 01:07:21,375
but they hardly ever scream...

796
01:07:21,808 --> 01:07:25,145
'cause they'd feel ashamed and...

797
01:07:25,611 --> 01:07:28,548
nothing's worst than that.

798
01:07:31,617 --> 01:07:34,520
So we all walk around
with our heads looking down and...

799
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:40,229
never look up and see
how beautiful the sky is.

800
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:05,535
So, what's actually happening?

801
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:08,471
Her immune system
is attacking her new cell growth.

802
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,040
It's not something we expected...

803
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,442
because it originated from
her own genetic material.

804
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:15,444
The problem is to identify a suppressant
which will switch off that part...

805
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:18,180
of the immune system
in the timeframe that we have.

806
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:22,451
- Well, why not shut the whole thing down?
- She'd die of a cold in a week.

807
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,789
Look, you did this thing to Molly,
okay? You made her into a person.

808
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:28,625
What are you saying exactly?

809
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:34,501
There is a chance of the whole
process completely reversing.

810
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:41,437
This is crazy... I mean...

811
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,906
She is not gonna go back to what she was.

812
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:46,976
Okay? We gotta work at this
and we gotta stop this thing.

813
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,379
There was always the possibility
of this happening, Buck...

814
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:50,680
you knew that in the beginning.

815
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:55,888
No, I didn't know that you were gonna create
a whole new person and just give up on her.

816
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:59,822
She was always a person, Buck.

817
01:11:10,865 --> 01:11:13,235
When the hell are we gonna
tell Molly about this?

818
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:16,706
I think she knows.

819
01:11:17,338 --> 01:11:21,343
I think she has known for quite a while.

820
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:29,083
I felt some things, but
it was just in the last few weeks.

821
01:11:29,383 --> 01:11:33,356
- Why didn't you say something?
- I don't know.

822
01:11:33,554 --> 01:11:36,557
I guess I was scared.

823
01:11:43,931 --> 01:11:46,001
You're not going back.

824
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:48,570
I'm not gonna let you.

825
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:52,675
You're here and you're my sister and...

826
01:11:53,441 --> 01:11:58,048
we're gonna get through this thing
together. Aren't we?

827
01:11:59,147 --> 01:12:01,815
I don't know.

828
01:12:01,915 --> 01:12:04,919
We're gonna beat this thing.

829
01:12:21,434 --> 01:12:24,004
I'm so scared.

830
01:12:24,104 --> 01:12:27,074
I'm really scared.

831
01:12:28,408 --> 01:12:30,878
I'm not gonna go back.

832
01:12:30,978 --> 01:12:34,981
I don't wanna lose all this.
I don't wanna lose you.

833
01:12:35,081 --> 01:12:36,983
- You won't me lose.
- Yeah, I will.

834
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:39,686
You have to go and find somebody else.

835
01:12:39,786 --> 01:12:40,721
- You do.
- No, Mol...

836
01:12:40,821 --> 01:12:42,939
- Yes, you do.
- It's not gonna be any different...

837
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:44,691
- ...than how it was before.
- No...

838
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:48,427
You've seen how I am now. You're
always gonna be thinking about that.

839
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:50,963
You're always gonna be thinking
about how I could've been.

840
01:12:51,063 --> 01:12:54,501
- No, I won't.
- Yeah, you will.

841
01:12:56,002 --> 01:12:58,838
Do you know why?

842
01:13:02,341 --> 01:13:05,878
Because I'll always know it's you...

843
01:13:06,345 --> 01:13:09,114
no matter what.

844
01:14:00,099 --> 01:14:02,534
Come on, Mol.

845
01:14:03,269 --> 01:14:07,875
- I don't think I can do it.
- Yes, you can. Come on.

846
01:14:09,441 --> 01:14:12,479
Are you ready? Sit up here.

847
01:14:13,612 --> 01:14:16,181
Just pedal, alright?
Put your feet here.

848
01:14:16,281 --> 01:14:18,045
Your handlebar's there.
Just pedal, okay?

849
01:14:18,145 --> 01:14:18,851
No!

850
01:14:18,951 --> 01:14:21,519
Come on, Mol.
You were ridding yesterday.

851
01:14:21,619 --> 01:14:23,621
You can do this.

852
01:14:23,721 --> 01:14:25,924
Come on. Sit up here.

853
01:14:26,024 --> 01:14:29,561
I'm gonna give you a push-start, okay? And
then you just keep your balance and you pedal.

854
01:14:29,661 --> 01:14:31,329
- Alright?
- No.

855
01:14:31,529 --> 01:14:34,100
Yes. You can do this.
Are you ready?

856
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,934
Yes. Come on.

857
01:14:36,034 --> 01:14:37,603
Come on. Pedal.

858
01:14:37,703 --> 01:14:40,706
Pedal, come on.
Come on, you can do it.

859
01:14:40,806 --> 01:14:43,208
Keep your feet on the pedals.

860
01:14:43,308 --> 01:14:46,145
Molly, are you okay?

861
01:14:46,444 --> 01:14:48,514
Are you alright?
Huh? Are you alright?

862
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:50,382
Come on.

863
01:14:50,982 --> 01:14:54,152
Come on, let's try it again.
You did this yesterday. You can do it.

864
01:14:54,652 --> 01:14:58,223
Buck, you can't force her.
What are you doing, for God's sake?

865
01:14:58,323 --> 01:15:01,459
- She's gonna ride this bike!
- What are you trying to do?

866
01:15:01,559 --> 01:15:03,761
- She fell off the bike!
- I'm not gonna let it happen!

867
01:15:03,861 --> 01:15:06,625
She is not going back
to being a vegetable!

868
01:15:06,725 --> 01:15:07,765
Sam!

869
01:15:07,865 --> 01:15:12,671
Don't say that, Buck.
Don't say that about anybody.

870
01:15:20,712 --> 01:15:23,949
I'm sorry about out there.

871
01:15:28,752 --> 01:15:33,192
You know when you used to
come to see me every Christmas?

872
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:37,361
You'd bring me a box of candies
every year.

873
01:15:39,363 --> 01:15:43,301
Well, one year you brought me a hat.

874
01:15:45,268 --> 01:15:50,376
It was a yellow straw
hat with ribbons on it.

875
01:15:51,808 --> 01:15:54,810
I loved that hat.

876
01:15:56,146 --> 01:16:00,951
But it blew off the first time
they took me to the beach.

877
01:16:01,051 --> 01:16:04,589
It sailed up into the sky...

878
01:16:06,723 --> 01:16:09,760
until next Christmas...

879
01:16:10,561 --> 01:16:13,831
you brought me another box of candies.

880
01:16:16,132 --> 01:16:18,735
You remember that?

881
01:16:19,602 --> 01:16:21,838
Of course I do.

882
01:16:21,938 --> 01:16:27,546
I waited for you to come, all year.

883
01:16:28,378 --> 01:16:31,281
When mom and dad died,
you didn't even...

884
01:16:31,581 --> 01:16:33,649
You didn't even seem
to know what happened.

885
01:16:33,749 --> 01:16:37,254
You'd still talk about them,
like they were still around.

886
01:16:37,587 --> 01:16:40,524
Maybe they were.

887
01:16:43,425 --> 01:16:46,362
I was 17, Molly.

888
01:16:47,262 --> 01:16:50,165
All those years that they'd been,
uh, looking after you...

889
01:16:50,265 --> 01:16:53,202
I'd just go up to my room...

890
01:16:53,368 --> 01:16:58,375
When they died,
I didn't know who you were.

891
01:16:58,807 --> 01:17:02,344
I hardly knew how to look after myself.

892
01:17:02,444 --> 01:17:06,817
I always wished that you'd
bring your friends home.

893
01:17:07,482 --> 01:17:10,384
I wanted to meet them.

894
01:17:13,588 --> 01:17:17,526
I didn't want people to see you.

895
01:17:19,829 --> 01:17:25,337
I've never told anyone
I even had a sister.

896
01:17:38,212 --> 01:17:40,782
I'll still be me, Buck.

897
01:17:40,882 --> 01:17:45,186
I'm gonna be just as much
a person as I am now.

898
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:48,289
I'll just be different.

899
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:41,700
Hi there.

900
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,303
It's looking good.
You've done a lot of work.

901
01:19:45,803 --> 01:19:51,442
I'm taking it out for trials
in two weeks. See if it floats.

902
01:19:51,542 --> 01:19:54,879
Do you need some crew?

903
01:20:00,017 --> 01:20:03,754
I wanted to tell you that we've
found a good place for Molly.

904
01:20:03,954 --> 01:20:06,691
It's sort of a halfway house.

905
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:10,361
She'll be moving there
at the end of the week.

906
01:20:10,461 --> 01:20:13,197
We'll all really miss her.

907
01:20:13,297 --> 01:20:16,468
But we'll be able to visit.

908
01:20:18,469 --> 01:20:21,873
I didn't know if you'd be here,
so I wrote down the address.

909
01:20:21,973 --> 01:20:24,709
I'm sure she wants to see you.

910
01:20:25,409 --> 01:20:27,211
Does she know who I was?

911
01:20:27,311 --> 01:20:31,383
Well, you won't know until you go.

912
01:20:37,622 --> 01:20:40,291
Thanks.

913
01:21:15,224 --> 01:21:18,823
It's really close by.
You liked it when we went there.

914
01:21:18,923 --> 01:21:20,243
No!

915
01:21:22,065 --> 01:21:23,865
There's all those big gardens.

916
01:21:23,965 --> 01:21:27,936
You'll be able to help pick
all the lemons and the oranges.

917
01:21:28,036 --> 01:21:31,007
I'll come and see you everyday, Mol.

918
01:21:31,307 --> 01:21:34,645
We'll be climbing
all over those fruit trees.

919
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:50,459
Well, I'll give you
a lift to the new place.

920
01:21:50,559 --> 01:21:52,128
Is that okay, Susan?

921
01:21:52,228 --> 01:21:54,263
Of course.

922
01:21:54,363 --> 01:21:56,099
I've got a job, Sus.

923
01:21:56,199 --> 01:22:00,769
It's... It's not a great one
but I can pay off my debts.

924
01:22:00,869 --> 01:22:03,839
They re-possessed the other car.

925
01:22:04,973 --> 01:22:08,678
I was gonna come with Molly,
if that's alright.

926
01:22:21,657 --> 01:22:26,030
Molly go Buck.

927
01:22:33,636 --> 01:22:35,270
Yeah.

928
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:38,140
Molly go Buck.

929
01:22:56,825 --> 01:22:59,461
We'll see you.

930
01:23:04,399 --> 01:23:06,935
And, uh...

931
01:23:07,435 --> 01:23:10,305
I will be needing that crew...

932
01:23:10,706 --> 01:23:13,743
if she's still available.

933
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:16,478
She is.

934
01:23:44,972 --> 01:23:48,109
I thought we'd stop by on the way.

935
01:23:48,209 --> 01:23:51,413
- Molly go Buck?
- Yeah.

936
01:24:09,996 --> 01:24:12,431
So...

937
01:24:12,766 --> 01:24:16,670
What do you think of the new layout, Mol?

938
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:19,206
Good?

939
01:24:53,306 --> 01:24:56,910
Is this the right place for the bed?

940
01:25:04,416 --> 01:25:07,253
I got your cards.

941
01:25:09,487 --> 01:25:13,795
We have a nice light in here.
See that light?

942
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:20,466
You got enough shoes
there to keep you going?

943
01:25:22,589 --> 01:25:24,109
No.

944
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:29,774
And, uh...

945
01:25:31,275 --> 01:25:34,880
I got, uh, Carmen coming by everyday.

946
01:25:35,747 --> 01:25:39,786
She wants you
to give her dancing lessons.

947
01:25:39,917 --> 01:25:41,337
No.

948
01:25:43,823 --> 01:25:48,029
I'm hoping Sam's gonna be
stoping by some times.

949
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:51,330
Sam.

950
01:25:52,597 --> 01:25:55,032
So, it's...

951
01:25:56,601 --> 01:26:00,838
it's gonna be quite a household...

952
01:26:01,038 --> 01:26:03,976
if you wanna join it.

953
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:21,759
Hello, Buck.

954
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,128
Hi, Molly.
