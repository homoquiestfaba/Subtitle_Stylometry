00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,270
(scratches)

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,520
(musical tones)

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,740
(rock music)

4
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:36,192
â™«This to me is crucial, enough
that when I started thinking

5
00:00:36,192 --> 00:00:38,272
â™«It indicated something was on

6
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,852
â™«In the morning I yawn,
take a look in the glass

7
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:43,032
â™«Turn my toothbrush on

8
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:46,112
â™«Excuse me if I refer to
this as it but it's soothing

9
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,833
â™«And cooling and calming me down

10
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:50,172
â™«When I feel like Michael
Douglas in "Falling Down"

11
00:00:50,173 --> 00:00:52,813
â™«Like Calgon it takes me away

12
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:55,193
â™«101 nights of great flex

13
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:57,853
â™«I like to keep the words
simple about something complex

14
00:00:57,853 --> 00:01:00,853
â™«I'm shifting into second gear
when I'm racing down the road

15
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:03,493
â™«With my baby blue and a hole in my shoe

16
00:01:03,493 --> 00:01:05,453
â™«What is this, what is this

17
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:07,973
â™«Things are happening, quite a bliss

18
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:10,033
â™«The world is shifting

19
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:13,193
â™«Let me out, let me out

20
00:01:13,194 --> 00:01:15,714
â™«What is this, what is this

21
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:18,174
â™«Things that happen, don't wanna miss

22
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:19,793
â™«The globe is shifting

23
00:01:19,794 --> 00:01:21,814
â™«When the fires burn, turn the knob

24
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:23,774
â™«'Cause that's the way the world turns.

00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:25,934

(rock music)

43
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:27,137
- Okay, would you rather
get caught masterbating

44
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:30,267
to gay porn, or picking
your nose and eating it.

45
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,476
- I think I'm gonna have
to take picking my nose.

46
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:36,228
- I'm gonna have to go with gay porn.

47
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:38,477
- Oh, Mason, dude really?

48
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:40,998
- Yeah, masterbating is
normal, and if you're gay

49
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:42,858
then masterbating to guys is normal.

50
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:45,259
I don't care who you are,
you know, eating your boogers

51
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,509
is just nasty.

52
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:50,048
- You're right, I'm gonna
have to jerk off to gay porn.

53
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,419
- Okay, I got one.

54
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:54,938
Would you rather get
caught fucking a sheep

55
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:55,918
or fucking your cousin?

56
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,760
- My first cousin?

57
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,280
- Of course.

58
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,859
- My first cousin being a girl?

59
00:02:58,859 --> 00:02:59,809
- Yeah, sure.

60
00:02:59,809 --> 00:03:00,689
- Well, who catches me?

61
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,880
Does like a relative catch me?

62
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,050
- I don't know, why does it matter?

63
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,490
- Well, as long as my mom never finds out,

64
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,019
yeah I'd fuck my cousin.

65
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,200
- Hey, if it;s good enough for Einstein.

66
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:08,261
- I'd fuck a sheep.

67
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:10,142
- [Bernard] What, ew really?
- What's wrong with you?

68
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:11,551
- You haven't seen my cousin, okay?

69
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:14,051
- You're a senior in highschool.

70
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,048
Would you rather get
caught making out with

71
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:19,878
the ugliest girl in the
freshman class or bust a woody

72
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:22,279
in a shower room full of naked guys?

73
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:25,618
- Dude, that happened to me one time.

74
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:34,869
No, no, no,no,no, no, no look
in gym class the hottest girl

75
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:37,718
in school she was wearing this
like tight little tee shirt.

76
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:40,198
What? Hey, fuck you guys.

77
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:42,338
Like that could never happen to you.

78
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:52,768
- [Bernard] I know,
what a way to start off

79
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:53,948
a movie right?

80
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,540
It would seem appropriate
if you knew these guys.

81
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,250
This is Leroy.

82
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:00,727
He likes structure in his
life, which makes sense

83
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:01,667
he's an architect.

84
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:03,688
He's also five years
into his ten year plan

85
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:05,268
which includes buying a
house, getting married,

86
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,118
having kids, and making
partner at his firm.

87
00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:09,947
Although lately, I'm not
so sure if that plan's

88
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:10,917
working for him.

89
00:04:11,687 --> 00:04:13,527
Mason and I played soccer in highschool.

90
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:15,507
He got all of these
scholarship offers senior year

91
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:16,467
and then what's he do?

92
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,327
He up and quits the team
saying he doesn't want to deal

93
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:19,308
with the bullshit anymore.

94
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:21,769
He's a good guy, but I think
he's afraid of anything

95
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,059
becoming too real.

96
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:25,859
I'm not even sure why
I'm friends with Victor.

97
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:28,748
He's kind of angry at the
world for fighting him,

98
00:04:28,748 --> 00:04:30,928
which is odd because he started it.

99
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:33,808
He's great to at parties,
but keep him away from any

100
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,339
female family members.

101
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:36,998
Seriously.

102
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,649
- What are you bitching about?

103
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,189
You haven't even called
me since the last time

104
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,020
out at Atomic Cowboy.

105
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,709
- Atomic Cowboy was like what? Months ago?

106
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:45,279
- Yeah. So, what's doin' boys?

107
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,960
- Well,

108
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,190
- Shit, you go first.

109
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:51,331
- Yeah, you got first.

110
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:52,291
- Come on, what?

111
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,251
- That night we went
Barnapoli, that's where I met

112
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:56,652
that girl Lily, right?

113
00:04:56,653 --> 00:05:00,013
We were debating Modern
Art, specifically--

114
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,313
- [Victor] Such a dork.

115
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,431
- [Leroy] Whatever.

116
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,350
We're also talking and
even though I thought

117
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:06,951
what she was saying was kind
of bullshit, I couldn't stop

118
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,760
thinking about how
absolutely beautiful she is.

119
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:12,452
- [Bernard] Wait, back up, who's Lily?

120
00:05:12,452 --> 00:05:13,682
- [Victor] She's Crystal's friend.

121
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:15,433
- [Bernard] Crystal who?

122
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,023
- [Victor] Come on, I
told you about Crystal.

123
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:18,824
- [Bernard] No.

124
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:20,535
- [Victor] Crystal, the
craziest girl I ever met

125
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:22,055
in my entire life, Crystal.

126
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,776
- [Bernard] Dude, I haven't
talked to you in months.

127
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:24,797
I don't know who Crystal is.

128
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:26,416
- [Victor] Yes, you do,
I met her the same night

129
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:29,177
we were all over at Atomic
Cowboy and Mason met Angela.

130
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:30,107
- [Bernard] Angela?

131
00:05:30,737 --> 00:05:33,197
Wait a second, back up,
all three of you guys,

132
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:34,856
including the guy who's got a girlfriend,

133
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,836
go out and meet chicks the same night

134
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,686
and come to (mumbles) I get nothing?

135
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:41,659
- [Bernard] Okay, so now you
can see we're getting into

136
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:44,099
this thing where we tell
the story in flashback

137
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:46,379
and pause it so you can
hear us here at the bar

138
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,359
talking things over.

139
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,759
And, if I'm also doing
this voiceover narration

140
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,979
it's gonna get really
confusing so now I'm gonna

141
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:53,229
leave you to watch the story.

142
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,599
But, I might be back at
the end to explain things

143
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,720
if you don't understand it all.

144
00:05:57,721 --> 00:05:59,321
- Oh see, that's even better.

145
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:01,581
Tell 'em how you met
Angela and tell 'em about

146
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:03,661
the contest and what that girl--

147
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:05,691
- Maybe we shouldn't tell so
many people about the contest,

148
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,150
it kinda makes us look
like total assholes.

149
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:08,509
- Dude, what are you talking about man?

150
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:09,959
It's Bernard and Leroy, they already think

151
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,320
we're total assholes, come on tell 'em.

152
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,090
- All right, so that night
we were at Atomic Cowboy

153
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:15,474
and I met this girl Angela

154
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:17,274
who was just...
- [Victor] No, no, no, no, no,

155
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:19,354
no, no, no, no.

156
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:21,594
It started off at we
were at our apartment,

157
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:23,723
so Mason and I are trying
to come up with this idea

158
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,964
for this competition.

159
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:29,315
This is so exciting, this
has probably got to be

160
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:31,475
the most genius thing we
have ever come up with.

161
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:34,376
So, okay, what's on the list so far?

162
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:36,416
- Okay, African, Arab.

163
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:36,979
- Yes.

164
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:37,979
- [Mason] Asian.
- Good.

165
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,939
- Wait a minute, wait a minute
we should put East Asians.

166
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,079
- What do you mean? That's Asian.

167
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,379
- No, cause Russia's in Asia.

168
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,529
- Oh perfect, Russian, put Russian down.

169
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:48,258
- No, no, no there's no
race that's called Russian.

170
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:49,248
They're Caucasian.

171
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,829
- All right, fine, fine,
fine, fine put Caucasian down.

172
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:54,698
- Isn't going to be pretty
easy to find a white girl

173
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:55,618
to sleep with us--

174
00:06:55,618 --> 00:06:57,478
- So what? Who cares?

175
00:06:57,478 --> 00:06:59,908
You know, that's the whole point
you gotta complete the set.

176
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,340
- Like Latino.

177
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:05,631
- You mean Latina, oh Latina.

178
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:09,061
- Yeah, whatever you fucking homophobe.

179
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:13,488
- Indian, now Indian as in Ghandi,

180
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:16,492
or Indian as in Geronimo?

181
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:18,448
- How about one of each?

182
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:20,478
- Yeah, I don't know man.

183
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:23,338
I mean I've seen girls
from India in Saint Louis,

184
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:25,318
but I've never seen any Native Americans.

185
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:27,398
- So what? It'll make
the game last longer.

186
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:30,068
- No, it'll make it impossible to win.

187
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:36,018
- â™«I don't want no 'tang
that's hard to find

188
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:39,898
â™«Don't want no tang that's hard to find

189
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:42,243
- Okay, fine, fine, fine,
fine put Native American down,

190
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:42,903
we'll see.

191
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:44,043
- But, they gotta be over 50% none of this

192
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:45,663
half and half shit, it doesn't count.

193
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,083
You can't go bang Maria and call that your

194
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,543
fucking Latino girl.

195
00:07:48,543 --> 00:07:49,543
- They've gotta be like
two thirds, or whatever,

196
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:50,833
perfect, good.

197
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:53,364
- How's somebody going
to be two thirds one race

198
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:55,453
and one third another you fucking dipshit?

199
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:57,503
- What do you mean how?

200
00:07:57,503 --> 00:07:58,263
What do you mean how?

201
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:00,323
From like their...can I explain?

202
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:01,063
- [Mason] I'm sorry.

203
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,063
- Okay, from like their
grandparents or whatever.

204
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:05,503
If they got two grandparents
that are...listen to me.

205
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:07,253
If they got two grandparents
that are one race

206
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:11,293
and they got another
grandparent that's another race,

207
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:13,244
okay, you're right it doesn't work.

208
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,503
It doesn't work.

209
00:08:14,503 --> 00:08:17,363
- [Victor] No, wait I've been
thinking about this okay,

210
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,303
so listen, so, if you go
back to the grandparents'

211
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:21,563
grandparents' grandparents--

212
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:23,563
- [Mason] Listen idiot it
doesn't work, there's no exponent

213
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:25,303
of two that's also divisible by three.

214
00:08:26,183 --> 00:08:28,843
- [Victor] Okay, wow since
I don't know what that means

215
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:31,353
I'm just gonna assume I'm right.

216
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,343
- Just making it a ketchup
sandwich, or something.

217
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:35,653
- This is your ketchup.

218
00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:38,233
I can use this ketchup now?

219
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,103
- Guys, I think--

220
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:51,143
- Wait, wait, wait, what's
wrong? What's wrong?

221
00:08:51,143 --> 00:08:52,183
- I think I have to go home?

222
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,783
- Wait why? Why, why, why, why, why?

223
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,853
Don't leave.

224
00:08:56,423 --> 00:08:57,463
- My dick touched--

225
00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:58,203
- What?

226
00:08:59,943 --> 00:09:01,593
- Oh man look, I just gotta go.

227
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:03,593
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

228
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:05,183
What's going on, what's wrong?

229
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:07,073
- All right look, I was in
the bathroom, all right.

230
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,910
- Yeah.

231
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,270
- And, I had to take a
crap, okay so look, I cased

232
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,170
the joint, I made sure
nobody was in there.

233
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,160
I double papered the seat,
I sat down on the toilet,

234
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,680
dropped it between my legs and--

235
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,130
- What?

236
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,650
- Well, the water must
have been really high up

237
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,980
in the toilet because my
hang down touched the--

238
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:26,423
- Huh?
- [Victor] I don't know.

239
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:28,463
- Look, my dick touched
the toilet water, dude.

240
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:30,223
- Okay.

241
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:31,443
- Okay, so.

242
00:09:31,443 --> 00:09:32,503
- So?

243
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:33,323
Do you know how many people have taken

244
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,703
a shit in that toilet?

245
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:37,483
- Oh actually, well no not
off the top of my head.

246
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:38,733
I don't, sorry.

247
00:09:40,803 --> 00:09:41,693
It's no big deal.

248
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:43,833
- I had to clean my penis off in the sink.

249
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:48,743
- Please tell me you
locked the bathroom door

250
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:49,663
first, Bernard.

251
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:51,493
- Oh yeah, I wish I had.

252
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:55,203
- Please tell me that someone in here

253
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:57,282
didn't catch you with your
penis in the bathroom sink.

254
00:09:57,282 --> 00:09:58,022
- No.

255
00:09:58,022 --> 00:09:59,062
- Oh, well then--

256
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:03,102
- No, I was still applying
the soap when they walked in.

257
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,502
(laughs)

258
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:07,752
I gotta go.

259
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:09,207
(laughs)

260
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:10,257
- Ow.

261
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:18,987
- I just don't understand why
you always have to do that.

262
00:10:18,987 --> 00:10:20,047
- I mean I'm agreeing with you.

263
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:21,557
I guess I don't understand
what the problem--

264
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:23,507
- Well, you didn't even wait
to hear what I was gonna say.

265
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:24,647
- [Victor] Hey yo, fuck that.

266
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:26,541
- Cool.

267
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,961
- Do you want me to get you a drink?

268
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,031
- Sure.

269
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,271
(kiss)

270
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:33,301
- [Victor] Hey Denise,
I'll take a Schlafly.

271
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:34,542
- [Bernard] Oh, Glenmorangie, Denise.

272
00:10:34,543 --> 00:10:36,643
- What's up buddy? How's it going fellas?

273
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:39,344
What's up, hey how's that
new teaching job going?

274
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:40,234
- It's good.

275
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:41,625
- You know, send Denise home, okay?

276
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,665
Can we please let's just go on safari.

277
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,896
- Safari? What's that?

278
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:47,897
- Bernard, tell him what safari is.

279
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,967
- It's a perilous adventure
through the concrete jungle

280
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:54,127
hunting and capturing the
elusive poonani beast.

281
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:55,828
- Yes, come on it'll be like college.

282
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:56,689
- He can't do that.

283
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,279
- Yeah man, I don't think I could do that.

284
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,080
- Yes, you can, Denise
does whatever you say.

285
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,640
I mean, you could show up tomorrow morning

286
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,120
with another girl's
panties around your neck

287
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,560
and you could just say, you know,

288
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
"Hey, don't worry about it."

289
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,260
And, she'd be like, "Oh,
okay yeah, I won't."

290
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,600
- [Mason] Dude, he can't do that.

291
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,160
It's against the rules,
he's got a girlfriend.

292
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,040
- So?

293
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,200
- So, I'll have to figure
out a way around it.

294
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,120
- A way around it?

295
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,340
- Yeah, yeah hold on.

296
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,380
- Why are we even talking about this?

297
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,640
- Go break up with Denise
and then come tag ass

298
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,980
with us tonight and then tomorrow you can

299
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,980
get back together with her.

300
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,840
It'll be great.

301
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,540
- What?

302
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,940
- [Mason] You know she'll take you back.

303
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,520
- No, why should he go
through all of that?

304
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,860
- Because, then he's still
a nice guy, unlike you.

305
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,500
- No, that would make me a dick.

306
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,680
- Oh, Jesus Christ why
are you such a pussy?

307
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,619
- I gotta go guys, I'll see you later.

308
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:40,699
- What's wrong with you?
- [Victor] Hey, hey man.

309
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,180
He's just upset that his johnson
fell into another person's

310
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,660
corn log water.

311
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:48,041
- If you're broken up with
Denise you're not cheating

312
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,101
on her and you're not lying
to the girl you're going to

313
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:51,721
get with that night when she asks you

314
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:52,781
if you have a girlfriend.

315
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:53,541
- What?

316
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,141
- You can get your freak
on without breaking

317
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:56,901
any relationship rules.

318
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:58,661
I know girls that like
to do dirty, kinky shit.

319
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:00,541
The other night this
girl licked my asshole.

320
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,160
- Oh, come on.

321
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,280
Why would I wanna do that?

322
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,800
- Give it a try, trust me you'll love it.

323
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,860
- [Leroy] I'll just take your word for it.

324
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,780
- Okay, all right, no
that's great I'm gonna get

325
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,910
another beer.

326
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,910
- Wait, wait, total dick, fucking shit.

327
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,360
- Man, those two.

328
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:21,351
- Yeah, I know they can't help themselves.

329
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:23,952
- You know what, screw this. I'm gonna go,

330
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:25,767
- Oh no, come on man, stick around.

331
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,827
- You know, I got papers to grade.

332
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:30,187
Just tell them I left, all right?

333
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:31,398
- Dude, come on man.

334
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:34,148
That's not enough cash, man.

335
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:36,419
That's not gonna cover
it, I'm just saying.

336
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:39,929
- [Victor] Oh, boo fucking
hoo, you shoulda stuck around.

337
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,709
The girl I was talking to
had some cute friends, man.

338
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,989
- [Bernard] Okay fine,
what happened after I left?

339
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:46,509
- [Mason] So, Victor's
trying to get on this Indian,

340
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:48,349
you know, from like India
chick and he's working on her

341
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:49,209
for like an hour.

342
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:51,149
- [VIctor] That is crazy.
- I know.

343
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:55,849
- Oh, oh, look who it
is, Mason this is Jaamini

344
00:12:55,848 --> 00:12:57,248
Majaraja Perum.

345
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:58,208
- Nice to meet you.

346
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,118
- Hey, good pronunciation.

347
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:00,128
- Thank you so much, darling.

348
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:02,008
- Jaamini, nice.

349
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:03,368
- Who's ready for shots?

350
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:06,388
- Oh, look who it is, Sarah Redcloud,

351
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:10,588
meet my friend Victor and Jaamini.

352
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,439
- [Victor] You know, I still
don't believe that chick

353
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:14,048
was Native American.

354
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:15,238
- [Mason] God, you're a sore loser.

355
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,539
- [Victor] Look, she didn't even look.

356
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,320
Okay fine, what tribe was she?

357
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:20,579
- [Mason] You know what,
specifically she was Alaskan Inuit.

358
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,819
Like I was gonna ask her,
Christ just give it up already.

359
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:25,979
- Very nice to meet you
guys, there are from Mason.

360
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:27,439
- Thank you, Mason.
- [Sarah] Cheers.

361
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,209
- Cheers, thank you.

362
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:32,419
- All right, I've gotta
go to the bathroom.

363
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:33,679
- Okay, okay.

364
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,959
- I'm gonna go with you.

365
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,079
- Okay, we'll be right back.

366
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,159
- Okay, bye.

367
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,109
See you in a little bit.

368
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,299
I'm gonna what?

369
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:43,339
Take her to my teepee,
get up in her wigwam.

370
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:44,959
- Wait, wait, wait, wait
are you actually taking

371
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,699
that contest seriously?

372
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:48,019
- You're obviously taking it seriously.

373
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:49,959
- I totally forgot all about
it, I mean, the only reason

374
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,979
I was talking to that girl
was because she's cool man.

375
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:54,349
- So, you wanna forget about the contest

376
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:55,559
'cause you're striking out already.

377
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,459
- Oh, are you kidding?

378
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:58,037
I'm gonna nail her like a two by four.

379
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:58,997
- Like a two by four?

380
00:13:58,997 --> 00:13:59,797
- Yes.
- [Mason] Sure.

381
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,837
- You know what Mason, you
know what I think you need

382
00:14:01,837 --> 00:14:02,917
to grow up.

383
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:06,417
I mean that contest was a little
stupid and somewhat racist.

384
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,057
- Racist?

385
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:11,197
Nice, so what's my philosphy
when it comes to women?

386
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:12,717
They're all pink on the inside.

387
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:15,157
- Oh, Jesus Christ I can't
believe you just said that.

388
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:17,377
Look, I really don't care, okay?

389
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:20,317
This place is kind of boring
me, I think we should take off.

390
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,238
Let's go to Barnapoli, yes.

391
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:24,838
- Oh, yeah that's a great
idea so we can get there

392
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:26,978
and you can bitch about
how the whole place

393
00:14:26,978 --> 00:14:28,378
is full of gold diggers all the time.

394
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:30,378
- Oh, I don't care
there's going to be a ton

395
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:32,598
of hot ass there, it'll be great.

396
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:35,238
- There's two really nice girls
here and I think it's just

397
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:36,418
a foolish thing to do.

398
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,578
- So, are you gonna come
with or are you going to

399
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:39,238
try and get with the Two Dogs Fucking,

400
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:40,318
or whatever her name is?

401
00:14:40,318 --> 00:14:41,878
- Oh, I'm gonna stay man.

402
00:14:41,878 --> 00:14:43,778
- All right, well I'm gonna
have Leroy go with me.

403
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:44,638
- Oh, what a combo.

404
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:45,698
- You're gonna be left her alone.

405
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:47,018
- Yeah, great.
- [Victor] Good bye.

406
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:48,338
- It's better that way.
- [Victor] Have a good time.

407
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:51,488
- So, where's your girl?

408
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,158
- I said I was hungry
so she's off trying to

409
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:55,538
find me some food.

410
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:57,298
- Wow okay, listen you
need to come have some fun

411
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:58,378
with me, okay?

412
00:14:58,379 --> 00:14:59,439
Just leave her behind.

413
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:02,379
Just tell her you need a
night out with the guys.

414
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:03,378
- Dude, I'm not gonna go pick up--

415
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:06,598
- Hey listen, listen no
chasing women, all right?

416
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:10,778
Just, we're gonna go out, drink
heavily, just talk and shit.

417
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:12,528
Just you and me, come on.

418
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:15,458
- All right, I'll go.

419
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:16,299
(kiss)

420
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,089
- [Mason] You actually
believed this guy when he said

421
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:19,919
he wanted to go out and not chase women?

422
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,659
- [Leroy] No, I'm not that
stupid I knew what he was

423
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:23,219
up to, I just I wanted a change of pace.

424
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:25,069
- [Victor] Yeah, well it
wound out working out for you,

425
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:25,789
didn't it?

426
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,590
So, fuck both you guys.

427
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,119
- Lucky you met him,
he's such a great guy.

428
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,079
And, nice to meet you Sarah
- [Sarah] Nice to meet you.

429
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:37,031
- Oh, curious what percent
of Native American are you?

430
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:38,521
- Excuse me?

431
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:43,651
- Remember, it doesn't
count unless she's over 50%.

432
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:46,123
Thems are the rules.

433
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:47,754
Take care, pleasure.

434
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:49,794
- He's--

435
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:50,864
- Fuck you.

436
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:53,014
- What? Sarah, Sarah, Sarah,
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah,

437
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:54,474
wait, wait, wait he's just joking.

438
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:56,244
He's a jokester, that's what he does.

439
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:58,624
- You think I'm gonna trust you now?

440
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:02,754
- Can I do something for
you just to get you to stay?

441
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,204
Just anything, I don't care.

442
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:06,634
- Yeah?

443
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,114
- What's on your top shelf?

444
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:10,356
- We've got some Hennessy XO Cognac.

445
00:16:10,357 --> 00:16:11,607
- I'll have that.

446
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:19,496
Pay her.

447
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:20,687
- Thirty.

448
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:23,176
- Okay.

449
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:33,277
What?

450
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,567
- Oh my god, I can't believe that.

451
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:37,736
- Yeah, me neither.

452
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:39,906
What a bitch.

453
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:43,078
- No, I can't believe you let
yourself get played like that.

454
00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:50,247
- [Victor] So, what
percent Japanese was she?

455
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:52,738
- [Mason] None, she's Korean asshole.

456
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:55,239
- Maybe I deserved it.

457
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,709
You know what, can I get
a Schlafly's and a pack

458
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:00,819
of soft ones please?

459
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,770
I'm Mason.

460
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:10,791
- Angela.

461
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,112
- Nice to meet you.

462
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:13,492
Would you ever do that to a guy if you got

463
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,422
really pissed at him?

464
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,526
- No, I'd hit him up for an entire dinner,

465
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,720
then walk out on him.

466
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,480
- So, I'd be running kind
of a big risk when I ask

467
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:22,719
you out to dinner?

468
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,229
- Only if you pissed me off.

469
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,410
- Do you wanna go out to dinner sometime?

470
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,510
- No.

471
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:29,421
- [Mason] Why not?

472
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:30,561
- I don't date guys who smoke?

473
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:32,671
- I don't smoke, never did.

474
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:40,901
- Okay listen, if I wind
up talking with a girl

475
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:41,681
in this place--

476
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:43,251
- Dude, I thought you
said you weren't gonna go

477
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:43,971
on a hunt tonight?

478
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:45,271
- Well yeah man, I mean not on purpose,

479
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:46,941
but the fact of the matter is, you know,

480
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,601
even when I'm not looking for it hot pussy

481
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:50,002
just tends to find me, so.

482
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:50,761
- Oh, really?

483
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:52,141
- Yeah, it's a blessing and a curse.

484
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:55,781
Listen, girls always have
friends so if I wind up

485
00:17:55,781 --> 00:17:57,301
with a girl who wants to get with me

486
00:17:57,301 --> 00:17:59,001
you gotta take care of her friend, okay?

487
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:00,801
- Yeah, sure I'll take care of her friend.

488
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:02,181
- I mean, you know what
I mean when I say like

489
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,121
take care of her, right?

490
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:04,561
- Yeah, yeah I know buy her
a drink, fucking talk to her

491
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:05,321
all night long.

492
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:07,261
- No, no man come on.

493
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:08,195
- Dude, I have a girlfriend.

494
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:08,915
- So what?

495
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:09,995
- Okay, so I have a girlfriend.

496
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:11,695
- All right, listen if we
end up taking these girls

497
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:15,235
back to my place I can't get on my girl

498
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:17,815
if her friend's just sitting
there doing nothing, man.

499
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:19,315
- Dude, I'm not gonna
fuck the friend just--

500
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,715
- Listen, listen, listen you
don't have to fuck her, okay?

501
00:18:21,715 --> 00:18:23,725
Just mess around with her a little bit.

502
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:25,615
- No.

503
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:27,735
- All right, all right
come on man, how 'bout

504
00:18:27,736 --> 00:18:31,656
you just go down on her,
you know, you can do that.

505
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:33,816
Then she can suck you off, it'll be great.

506
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,826
- You lunatic, you really
think that's not cheating?

507
00:18:37,476 --> 00:18:39,266
- Okay, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

508
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:42,416
If she doesn't make you blow your load

509
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,396
then that's not cheating
because you didn't get

510
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:46,496
any sex out of it.

511
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:47,356
- What?

512
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:48,826
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

513
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,596
It's great, just fucking munch
on her box, enjoy yourself

514
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:54,736
and when it's her turn to go down on you

515
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:57,157
fucking fall asleep, or you
know pretend like you can't

516
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:58,236
get it up or something.

517
00:18:58,236 --> 00:18:59,136
- Dude, how is that not--

518
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:00,856
- Hey, you're gonna at
least finger bang someone

519
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:03,176
in this fucking bar, okay?

520
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,536
That's that.

521
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:05,236
- All right, but I--

522
00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:06,406
- No, no, no, no.

523
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:09,936
No, don't try and haggle with me.

524
00:19:09,936 --> 00:19:12,136
That's my final offer, let's
do this, let's do this.

525
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:13,558
- I'm a little mad at you right now.

526
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:14,278
- Good.

527
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,979
- I don't know maybe I
could've learned to love rap

528
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:20,059
if someone got me into, you
know, but the only chicks

529
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,798
I knew in highschool who
listened to rap were these

530
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:25,718
Barbie doll blondes who
were all, "I listen to Ice-T

531
00:19:25,718 --> 00:19:28,218
"and I slept with a black guy
once, that means I'm hard."

532
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:31,158
(laughs)

533
00:19:32,912 --> 00:19:33,822
- Hi.

534
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:40,272
- Oh, hey sorry I was just gonna say

535
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:42,432
I used to be really into rap, so.

536
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,173
- Oh yeah, so you can
help me out with that?

537
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:45,833
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

538
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,133
But, you know, I kinda
got burned out on it.

539
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,523
Now, I just mostly listen to Sting.

540
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,773
- [Mason] What a fucking
bullshitter you are.

541
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,764
You hate Sting.

542
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:56,198
- [Victor] Asshole, chicks
dig Sting, so you tell them

543
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:57,658
you like Sting so they'll like you.

544
00:19:57,658 --> 00:19:59,838
Now, shut the fuck up I'm telling a story.

545
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,749
- Ah, I love Sting.

546
00:20:01,748 --> 00:20:03,248
- [Victor] So, there you go dickhead.

547
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:06,478
- Oh yeah, what else do you listen to?

548
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,378
- Just about anything, really.

549
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:13,288
But, right now I have a big
collection of 80s music.

550
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:14,119
- Great.

551
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,550
- I like some reggae.

552
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,160
My dad used to play jazz so I
listen to Coltrane sometimes.

553
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,431
I like just about any kind of music.

554
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:23,621
Well, except country.

555
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:26,051
- Oh, that's cool.

556
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:29,633
I like blues, I like
funk, I like some techno.

557
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:31,754
- [Mason] Well, that one backfired on you,

558
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:32,744
didn't it ass face?

559
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:35,894
- I think there's something to appreciate

560
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,220
in every kind of music.

561
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,430
Except country, of course.

562
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:41,612
- Of course.

563
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:43,363
- [Bernard] Hey, what's
wrong with country?

564
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:46,923
(clears throat)

565
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:50,553
- I'm sorry, this is Lily.

566
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:53,003
- Hi, I'm Victor.

567
00:20:54,473 --> 00:20:56,103
- Are you here by yourself, Victor?

568
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,403
- No, no I'm actually here
with a buddy of mine, Leroy.

569
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,823
You might just getta bang out of him.

570
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:06,613
- Oh my god, you're so
completely fucked in your head.

571
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:09,733
- Oh, okay you really think
a comic book full of crude

572
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,913
sketches about guys punching each other

573
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:12,973
counts as art?

574
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,713
- Have you ever even seen
Alex Ross' watercolor

575
00:21:14,713 --> 00:21:16,113
to Kingdom Come?

576
00:21:16,113 --> 00:21:17,363
- I really wouldn't know who that is.

577
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,573
- Yeah. Or David Mack's mix media?

578
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:21,613
- [Victor] Oh my god, Leroy
please, please tell me

579
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,333
you did not talk to her about comic books

580
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,273
the whole time.

581
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:26,153
- [Leroy] You know, comic
books are a great in

582
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:28,213
to the ladies, my man.

583
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:30,213
- [Victor] Oh shit, fine. Go ahead.

584
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:32,714
- Or Craig Thompson's
brilliant brush work?

585
00:21:32,714 --> 00:21:35,074
Or the ridiculously
complex graphic matches

586
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:37,054
that Brian Bolland pulled
off in The Killing Joke?

587
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:39,354
- Using an artist medium
doesn't automatically

588
00:21:39,353 --> 00:21:40,663
makes someone an artist.

589
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:42,603
- Okay, but when Lichtenstein
borrows the asthetic

590
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:44,995
of comic books for his pop
art paintings then he counts

591
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:45,835
as real artist?

592
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:47,275
- God no, no, no, no, no.

593
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:51,275
I hate all that neo-dotist crap
in the contemporary museum.

594
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,176
And, that ass ugly Pulitzer
building, ugh it's terrible.

595
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:55,485
- You did not just say that.

596
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:57,546
The Pulitzer foundation
building was designed by

597
00:21:57,546 --> 00:21:58,646
Tadao Ando.

598
00:21:59,096 --> 00:21:59,796
- So?

599
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:00,866
- So?

600
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:03,736
Okay, so what if I told
you that Caravaggio

601
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:05,176
only painted realism
because he had no sense

602
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:06,056
of imagination?

603
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:08,356
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa easy there.

604
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:09,516
- Ooh, oh, see wait a minute.

605
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:12,646
- No, no, no Caravaggio's
use of light it was...

606
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:15,256
Hey, it was absolutely groundbreaking.

607
00:22:15,256 --> 00:22:16,176
And you know what?

608
00:22:16,176 --> 00:22:18,816
I'm sorry but it took a
whole lot more imagination

609
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:20,136
than writing pow and--

610
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:22,936
- Oh, nah wait now I don't
know I think Caravaggio

611
00:22:22,936 --> 00:22:24,856
only used that intense
lighting so he could leave

612
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:26,236
half the canvas black.

613
00:22:26,236 --> 00:22:26,856
- What?

614
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:28,716
- Yeah, yeah, yeah I read
that he thought that if

615
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:30,266
he only had to paint
half the picture he could

616
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,956
crank out paintings
faster and make more cash.

617
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:33,536
(laughs)

618
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:34,296
Read it.

619
00:22:34,296 --> 00:22:35,176
- You read it?

620
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:37,216
Okay, yeah now you're
just messing with me.

621
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:38,966
- Yeah, but we're starting
to understand each other.

622
00:22:40,196 --> 00:22:42,306
- Yes, we're starting to
understand each other.

623
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,266
And, I don't like it.

624
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:49,856
- I've got a date with Crystal.

625
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,736
- I assumed.

626
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,496
- So, what's up with that Lily girl, man?

627
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,906
- I don't know I had fun arguing with her,

628
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,936
but she's all uptight and snobby.

629
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:57,116
- She's hot.

630
00:22:57,116 --> 00:22:58,256
- So?

631
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:00,476
- So, if I were you I'd plug
her like a bathtub drain.

632
00:23:00,476 --> 00:23:02,976
- Okay dude, even if I didn't
have a girlfriend, which I do,

633
00:23:02,976 --> 00:23:05,476
I could never go out with a
girl who's all rigid like that.

634
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:06,816
You know, I mean would you
wanna go out with a girl

635
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:08,636
who has to get out of the
shower if she has to pee?

636
00:23:08,636 --> 00:23:09,756
- Fuck no.

637
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:11,876
- I know you don't get out of
the shower if you have to pee.

638
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:13,176
- Are you kidding?

639
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:15,146
I mean sometimes I take
a shit in the shower.

640
00:23:16,348 --> 00:23:18,088
- [Leroy] Dude, you brought
your drink with you man.

641
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:23,938
- You know, you are the
best boyfriend a girl

642
00:23:23,938 --> 00:23:25,518
could ask for, you know that?

643
00:23:25,518 --> 00:23:26,498
- Oh yeah?

644
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:30,378
- Yeah, flowers, romantic
dinners almost every night,

645
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:32,198
sex twice a night.

646
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:33,638
- Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

647
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:36,298
- Well yeah, but I mean
after two years you think

648
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:38,418
most guys kind of get
comfortable and stop making

649
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,108
the effort, but you're just the opposite.

650
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,858
- I just want you to know I love you.

651
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:47,098
- [Victor] Yeah, you love
her so much you went home

652
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:49,038
and banged her after meeting another girl

653
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:50,358
out at a bar.

654
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:53,108
- [Leroy] Look, it was a
complicated situation, okay?

655
00:23:53,878 --> 00:23:55,908
Okay wait, fuck you, it was your idea.

656
00:23:57,078 --> 00:23:58,198
- So, what are we doing tomorrow?

657
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,618
- Oh Sean Murphy's doing a signing down at

658
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:03,538
Star Clipper comics.

659
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:04,778
I'm gonna take some of his books down

660
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:05,748
and get 'em signed.

661
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:08,238
- [Victor] Oh good, more
comic books so I guess

662
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:11,199
that's just your go-to
subject with the ladies.

663
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:13,918
- [Leroy] Ladies like a
man who likes comic books.

664
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:15,398
Certain ladies, ladies I like.

665
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:17,658
- [Victor] Hold on, I just
wanna take some notes here.

666
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,129
- Okay, and I'll go?

667
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,060
- Well, do you really like comic books?

668
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,150
- Well yeah.

669
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,759
- Which ones?

670
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:31,691
- I mean, you've turned me onto Powers,

671
00:24:32,982 --> 00:24:35,702
Y: The Last Man, Invincible.

672
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:37,221
- Yeah, I know those are the ones I like,

673
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:40,161
but you might like some
others that I don't.

674
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:41,961
- Well, I don't know, I
mean the ones you showed me

675
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:42,702
are good.

676
00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:45,362
- Yeah, but well look around
next time we're in Star Clipper

677
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:47,562
and maybe you might find
something I hadn't noticed

678
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:50,562
and then we could show each
other new stuff we found.

679
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:52,042
- Well sure, I mean if
you want me to do that

680
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:52,751
I can do that.

681
00:24:52,751 --> 00:24:54,921
- It's not a matter of
if I want you to or not.

682
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:57,541
I just thought you might actually like to

683
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:59,311
find something that you like.

684
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:01,891
- But, I like the ones that you showed me.

685
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:06,811
- Okay, that's cool.

686
00:25:08,621 --> 00:25:11,001
- [Mason] Okay, so you
didn't go out with Lily.

687
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:12,661
- [Leroy] Well, that's
not the end of this story.

688
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:13,921
After Victor took Crystal on a date--

689
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:16,262
- [Victor] Yeah, yeah so I
take her out and it's all this

690
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:18,602
normal nice talk garbage.

691
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:21,462
And then, she goes, "You're
treating me like a girl."

692
00:25:21,462 --> 00:25:22,982
- Huh?

693
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:24,912
- Is this how you talk
to your guy friends?

694
00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:27,453
Would you like to get to know me better?

695
00:25:28,024 --> 00:25:28,874
- Yeah, of course.

696
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:31,695
- All right, then let's
talk. Quit being so polite.

697
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:34,315
- Wow, okay.

698
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:36,865
How old are you?

699
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:37,816
- 25.

700
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:40,406
- How much do you weigh?

701
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:42,906
- Between 120 and 124 and three quarters,

702
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:43,996
depends on the day.

703
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:45,776
- Interesting.

704
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:49,877
What's your favorite position?

705
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:52,887
- [Leroy] And she said cowgirl, right?

706
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:54,387
- [Mason] I don't know, I
bet she said missionary.

707
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,507
- [Leroy] She said rum punch.

708
00:25:55,507 --> 00:25:56,787
- [Mason] I always thought
she looked more like

709
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:58,186
a doggy style girl to me.

710
00:25:58,187 --> 00:25:59,127
- [Leroy] Snotty princess.

711
00:25:59,127 --> 00:26:00,527
- [Victor] No.
- [Leroy] Farmer's daughter?

712
00:26:00,532 --> 00:26:02,042
- [Victor] No.
- [Leroy] The Charlie Chaplin.

713
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:03,702
- [Victor] Okay, just stop okay?

714
00:26:03,702 --> 00:26:04,962
- [Bernard] Wait, what's cowgirl?

715
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:06,342
- [Victor] Just listen.

716
00:26:06,342 --> 00:26:08,272
- What's your favorite position?

717
00:26:08,882 --> 00:26:10,472
- Making the guy call me
Daddy while I strap-on

718
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:11,372
fuck him in the ass.

719
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,001
If I really love a guy I might throw in

720
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:15,991
a reach around for him.

721
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:19,121
- You do that a lot?

722
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:20,791
- Yeah, with every guy I date.

723
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:22,671
You'll get your turn later tonight.

724
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:25,841
- [Mason] That explains so
much about your relationship.

725
00:26:25,842 --> 00:26:27,662
(laughs)

726
00:26:27,662 --> 00:26:30,562
- It doesn't seem like
there's much in that position

727
00:26:30,562 --> 00:26:31,992
for you, though.

728
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,262
- There is if we do it in front
of a mirror so I can watch

729
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:38,162
the look on his face when I
jam it in with no lubrication.

730
00:26:40,863 --> 00:26:43,023
(laughs)

731
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:44,043
- Oh man.

732
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:46,922
- [Bernard] There's no way she said that.

733
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:48,702
- [Victor] Leroy, am I lying?

734
00:26:48,702 --> 00:26:50,262
- [Leroy] No Bernard,
you didn't meet Crystal.

735
00:26:50,262 --> 00:26:51,842
- [Bernard] Okay, would
you rather get caught

736
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:53,102
being strap-on fucked in the ass--

737
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:56,662
- [Victor] Oh fuck, can I
just tell my fucking story?

738
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,036
- [Bernard] Okay, shit sorry go ahead.

739
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:02,156
- Okay, so I am up in
the stirrups waiting for

740
00:27:02,156 --> 00:27:03,316
my gynecologist.

741
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:05,476
- Yeah so, and she keeps
looking over at me, right?

742
00:27:05,476 --> 00:27:07,756
And, I'm trying to pretend
like nothing's going on.

743
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:10,936
- And, the nurse is all, "hmm".

744
00:27:10,936 --> 00:27:12,076
And I'm like, "What?"

745
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:15,196
- I'm squeezing as hard
as I can, but the thing is

746
00:27:15,196 --> 00:27:18,816
every time the car hits a
bump I'm positive I'm gonna

747
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:20,896
completely crap my pants.

748
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:24,436
- And, she just says, "Hang
on a second," and she walks

749
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,316
outta the room leaving
me there in the stirrups

750
00:27:26,316 --> 00:27:30,436
with no clue what she saw
that caused this big, "Hmm".

751
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:33,336
- The thing is up until now
the date has just been going

752
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:36,776
really well, and it's our
second date and I'm sure she's

753
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:38,877
expecting me to walk
through her door and like

754
00:27:38,877 --> 00:27:40,677
kiss her goodnight, I don't know.

755
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:42,656
- So, she's gone a good five
minutes which seems like

756
00:27:42,656 --> 00:27:45,896
five hours because at this
point I'm seriously sweating.

757
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:48,976
- I'm thinking, okay, well
if I don't kiss her goodnight

758
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:51,616
she's gonna think I'm not
interested, but if I do

759
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:53,976
I mean I run the serious
risk of taking a dump

760
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,596
all over her doorstep.

761
00:27:55,596 --> 00:27:57,306
- And, when she comes back
she's got another nurse

762
00:27:57,306 --> 00:28:01,816
with her and she just points
between my spread out legs

763
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:03,796
and says, "What do you think?"

764
00:28:03,796 --> 00:28:07,876
- You know, so this is it's
getting worse and worse.

765
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:12,586
- And, I swear the other nurse just goes,

766
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:16,468
"Hmm" with the exact same
expression on her face.

767
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:18,637
- And, I'm thinking you
know what, "Maybe if I get

768
00:28:18,637 --> 00:28:21,597
"to her place quick enough I
might be able to hold it in

769
00:28:21,597 --> 00:28:23,037
"and walk her to her door."

770
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:26,637
- And, I am so upset by this
point I'm like, I just yell

771
00:28:26,637 --> 00:28:27,857
"What the hell is it?"

772
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:31,617
- But, if not I'm gonna
start peeing out my ass.

773
00:28:31,617 --> 00:28:34,657
So, I'm just driving faster and faster.

774
00:28:34,658 --> 00:28:36,398
- And, both the nurses look
up at me like they have

775
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:39,497
no idea what I'm so agitated
about and the first one

776
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:43,177
just casually goes, "I think
you might have Chlamydia,

777
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:44,277
"but don't worry about it."

778
00:28:44,277 --> 00:28:46,057
- Until we're going at least
a hundred miles an hour

779
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,577
and I swear to god we're going
well over 90 at this point.

780
00:28:48,578 --> 00:28:50,878
- Yeah, "Don't worry about
it because it can't cause

781
00:28:50,877 --> 00:28:52,487
"death or sterility, the
doctor will be with you

782
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:53,201
" in a moment."

783
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:55,821
- And, she turns to me,
she's like, "Yeah, could you

784
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,061
"slow down, maybe?"

785
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:59,081
And, I turn to her I'm like, "No."

786
00:28:59,081 --> 00:29:01,961
- And, they walk out of the
room and I'm just praying

787
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:04,101
that the doctor's gonna
come back in and say those

788
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:06,181
stupid fucking cunt nurses have no clue

789
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:07,461
what they're talking about.

790
00:29:07,461 --> 00:29:09,621
- And then, all of a
sudden we hit this pothole

791
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:13,021
and I make this sound like, "Oh, shit."

792
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:15,741
- But, another five minutes
goes by, she still hasn't

793
00:29:15,741 --> 00:29:18,861
come in and I'm totally freaking out.

794
00:29:18,861 --> 00:29:22,381
- Oh no, and then there's
this long silence.

795
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:24,581
- Okay, then while I'm waiting
I notice that they have those

796
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:26,381
informational pamphlets on the wall.

797
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:29,201
So, I hop off the examination
table, I go over to the wall

798
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,001
I grab the one that's for Chlamydia.

799
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:33,181
- Which would be awkward
on any second date,

800
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:34,321
but here it's worse because--

801
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:35,731
- And, the first thing it says?

802
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:38,641
May cause death or sterility.

803
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:43,296
- I keep making these grunting
noises and I can feel it

804
00:29:43,295 --> 00:29:45,045
starting to leak out.

805
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:49,609
- It was fortunate that the
nurses' diagnosis was wrong.

806
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:51,389
- No joke, it started to leak out.

807
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,499
- Unfortunate that it
took about three days

808
00:29:53,498 --> 00:29:54,758
to get the test results back.

809
00:29:54,757 --> 00:29:56,797
- And I'm afraid it's
gonna start getting smelly.

810
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:58,578
- And, by that time I'd
already kicked my boyfriend

811
00:29:58,578 --> 00:30:00,038
in the balls for giving me VD.

812
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:01,738
- And, it just the worst experience.

813
00:30:01,738 --> 00:30:03,638
Why am I telling you this story?

814
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:05,937
- He really didn't want to go
out with me much after that.

815
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:07,878
(laughs)

816
00:30:07,877 --> 00:30:11,527
- Wow, well remind me never to
give you a venereal disease.

817
00:30:12,758 --> 00:30:14,068
- You'd be better off if you didn't.

818
00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:18,756
- Yeah, I don't know I just...

819
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:21,666
I keep trying to get the
spark back in the relationship

820
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,876
and it's not working and
I'm running out of ideas.

821
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:27,497
- You think she's up for a threesome?

822
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:31,346
- You can make her wear costumes and wigs

823
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:33,527
and shit like that, then you
can pretend you're banging

824
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:35,117
a whole bunch of different chicks.

825
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:37,687
- Then, she puts her leg
up in the air and you

826
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:40,587
bend over backwards and put
your dick between her tits.

827
00:30:40,587 --> 00:30:43,307
Then, take an ice cube and
you rub it on her taint

828
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:45,087
in a counter-clockwise motion.

829
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:46,867
Make sure she's got a hand
free to pull on your balls

830
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:47,887
or it won't work right at all.

831
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,378
- Oh, I gotta write this down.

832
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,720
- Just fuck her more.

833
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,780
- Okay.

834
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,030
- Have sex with a guy
once, you'll really learn

835
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,900
to appreciate women more, trust me.

836
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,670
- You have to make her
feel really special, okay?

837
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,690
'Cause it's small day to
day things that creates

838
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,090
a loving bond between two people.

839
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,930
It's that bond of love and
trust that fills two hearts

840
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,950
and makes them beat as
one and creates a passion

841
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,090
that'll last for all of eternity.

842
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,550
If you truly love her and you
want to cherish her forever

843
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:22,991
you'll always pay attention
to the little things

844
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:25,091
that add up to a lifetime of love.

845
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,171
- [Leroy] Like what?

846
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:29,351
- Like, when she's about
to come stick your finger

847
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:30,462
in her ass.

848
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:33,931
- Oh, 'kay, stick it
right on in there, huh?

849
00:31:33,932 --> 00:31:35,532
- [Bernard] Wait, does that really work?

850
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:38,031
- [Mason] Oh, totally, yeah
but when you're doing it

851
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:38,792
you gotta--

852
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:40,302
- [Leroy] Look, that's
not actually important

853
00:31:40,302 --> 00:31:41,112
to the story, okay?

854
00:31:41,114 --> 00:31:43,774
- Okay, good yeah, no good anything else?

855
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:48,084
(sentimental music)

856
00:32:22,195 --> 00:32:23,245
Hey.

857
00:32:25,855 --> 00:32:27,535
- Came up with a more convincing argument

858
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:29,125
that comic books are real art?

859
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:33,335
- [Victor] Oh, please god
Leroy tell me you did not

860
00:32:33,335 --> 00:32:35,725
start talking to her
about comic books again.

861
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:37,935
- Oh, that's what it is, from the bar.

862
00:32:37,935 --> 00:32:40,715
Yeah, you looked familiar
and I just couldn't place it.

863
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:43,039
No, I was just looking for
some pieces for my place.

864
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,310
- Oh really?

865
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,620
- Yeah, what a coincidence.

866
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,480
- Yeah, 'cause Crystal told
me that Victor was probing her

867
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,280
for information about me a few days ago.

868
00:32:50,281 --> 00:32:53,261
- [Victor] Oh yeah, I was
probing her all right.

869
00:32:53,261 --> 00:32:54,941
- [Leroy] Yeah, thanks for
being subtle about that

870
00:32:54,941 --> 00:32:57,061
by the way, that was real
smooth, smooth operator.

871
00:32:58,722 --> 00:32:59,442
- Victor said that?

872
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:00,222
- Yeah.

873
00:33:00,222 --> 00:33:01,432
- That silly kid.

874
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:03,672
(laughs)

875
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:07,944
Yeah, I don't know I just
thought it was cool that we

876
00:33:08,705 --> 00:33:10,205
had a real conversation, you know.

877
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:12,905
I don't know many people I can
have real conversations with.

878
00:33:12,905 --> 00:33:15,035
I just thought maybe you
might wanna hang out or--

879
00:33:15,044 --> 00:33:17,014
- Are you asking me out?

880
00:33:18,544 --> 00:33:19,874
Don't you live with your fiance?

881
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:22,785
- Actually, we're not engaged.

882
00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:24,646
I don't even know if
we're gonna get engaged.

883
00:33:24,647 --> 00:33:26,207
It's kind of complicated.

884
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:28,597
- I don't think I could, I
don't do that kinda stuff.

885
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,937
- I know, I...this is not...I just...

886
00:33:33,488 --> 00:33:35,068
I know this looks bad, but--

887
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:37,418
- But it's not like that, is
that what you're gonna tell me?

888
00:33:38,848 --> 00:33:40,588
- Would you believe me if
I said I wasn't like that?

889
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:41,559
- No.

890
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:48,338
But, I might be willing to
suspend judgment for a night.

891
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,465
- [Victor] Dude, wait, wait
she knew you had a girlfriend

892
00:33:51,466 --> 00:33:53,886
and she still went on a date with you?

893
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:55,385
(laughs)

894
00:33:55,385 --> 00:33:56,755
You fucking stud.

895
00:33:57,465 --> 00:33:58,295
- Really?

896
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,495
- But, only one night.

897
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:02,705
- You've got a deal, sister.

898
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:05,365
(laughs)

899
00:34:05,365 --> 00:34:06,235
How late of a night?

900
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:07,615
Hey, we can talk about that later, okay.

901
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:09,105
I'm gonna go, and I'll see ya.

902
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:10,045
- Why don't you look around?

903
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:10,965
- I'm gonna.
- [Lily] Okay.

904
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,166
- You look great today, by the way.

905
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:13,475
(laughs)
- Thank you.

906
00:34:14,817 --> 00:34:18,747
(funky music)

907
00:34:25,017 --> 00:34:27,857
- [Victor] Oh my god,
you took a Japanese chick

908
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,537
to a sushi restaurant.

909
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:32,217
- [Mason] She's fucking Korean.

910
00:34:32,218 --> 00:34:33,888
- [Victor] So what, I
mean those are hardly even

911
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:35,287
different countries.

912
00:34:35,818 --> 00:34:37,268
- Is that okay?
- [Angela] - Go ahead.

913
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:38,857
- And then, there won't
be any awkward moments.

914
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:40,377
I'll just talk the whole
date it'll be great.

915
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:42,207
- Okay yeah, come on.

916
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,029
- But, I can't do that, can I?

917
00:34:46,029 --> 00:34:48,269
- Do you feel like you
need to be constantly witty

918
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:50,009
and charming on a first date?

919
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:52,309
- No, I know whether or not
I'm gonna get a second date

920
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:54,829
is based entirely on
my sexual performance.

921
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:56,099
- Oh.

922
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,490
- I should watch my mouth, I'm sorry.

923
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:01,309
You might take some of
this crap I say seriously.

924
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:04,629
- I've always thought people
take sex far too seriously

925
00:35:04,629 --> 00:35:07,079
and not seriously enough at the same time.

926
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:09,729
- What do you mean?

927
00:35:09,729 --> 00:35:12,029
- Well, like this one time a few years ago

928
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:14,889
on break from college
a bunch of us got drunk

929
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:17,129
and went skinny dipping
in my friends mom's pool

930
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:19,029
'cause she was out of town.

931
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:21,329
- There's this girl that I had
a crush on so she transferred

932
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:23,089
half way through freshmen
year, so we talked

933
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:24,729
for three solid years.

934
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:28,129
I have not had the balls
to ask this girl out.

935
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,890
- Well, it was all couples
and it was pitch black

936
00:35:30,885 --> 00:35:33,265
so eventually everbody starts making out.

937
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,245
- So, she ends up breaking
up with her boyfriend

938
00:35:35,245 --> 00:35:37,645
at the time who graduated a year before.

939
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:40,325
- And, probably doing some
other stuff I didn't even

940
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:41,265
want to know about.

941
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:43,405
- So, now she's single in
this big way and we just kinda

942
00:35:43,405 --> 00:35:47,305
fate has it we end up in the
same group history project.

943
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:49,365
- So, I'm naked with
my legs wrapped around

944
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:52,385
my boyfriend's waist, he was also naked

945
00:35:52,385 --> 00:35:53,685
and we're making out.

946
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:57,425
- I plan it for a night
that my parents are gonna be

947
00:35:57,425 --> 00:36:00,405
out of the house and I just
kinda conveniently forgot

948
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:02,345
to invite the other two people over.

949
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:05,425
- I guess he starts thinking,
"Hey, if everybody else

950
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:07,525
"is doing it in the pool why not us too?"

951
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:09,785
- So, I have no plans to make
a physical move on this girl.

952
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:11,985
I seriously was just
gonna ask her to dinner,

953
00:36:11,985 --> 00:36:13,065
all gentlemen like.

954
00:36:13,065 --> 00:36:14,865
- Which, I thought was
kind of presumptuous

955
00:36:14,865 --> 00:36:17,405
considering we'd only been
going out for a couple weeks.

956
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:18,805
- I get myself all pumped up for it.

957
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:19,985
I mean I'm determined I'm gonna ask her

958
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:20,745
no matter what.

959
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,405
- Well, he starts trying to angle it,

960
00:36:23,405 --> 00:36:25,305
but he's not having any success with it.

961
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:28,145
- We started on this thing,
this project and I say

962
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:31,625
something stupid out of
nervousness and she laughs.

963
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,685
- He's moving his hips
all around trying to get

964
00:36:33,685 --> 00:36:35,385
some distance between our bodies

965
00:36:35,385 --> 00:36:36,485
to get the right angle.

966
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,985
- I'm like okay, this is it, this is it.

967
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:39,565
And, just as I get the
words out, you know,

968
00:36:39,566 --> 00:36:42,106
"Would you let me take you to dinner,"

969
00:36:42,105 --> 00:36:45,525
I hear the garage door
open and it's my parents.

970
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:47,185
- Meanwhile, I'm tightening up my legs

971
00:36:47,185 --> 00:36:48,745
to make sure that isn't going to happen.

972
00:36:48,745 --> 00:36:51,585
- I introduce everyone
to everyone, no big deal.

973
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:52,925
My dad walks off, you know.

974
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:56,265
- Look, as a girl if you called
everything to a dead halt

975
00:36:56,265 --> 00:36:58,125
everytime a guy was trying
to take off your clothes

976
00:36:58,127 --> 00:37:00,567
you'd get like two
minutes of make out time

977
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:01,567
in your whole life.

978
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:04,327
- My mom decides to stick
around and start talking

979
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:05,187
to this girl.

980
00:37:05,187 --> 00:37:08,007
- We keep making out and at
first he'd try to go for it

981
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:09,867
then back off, then try again.

982
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:12,277
- So,she kinda gives this
girl a look and she says,

983
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:15,387
"Do you think it's normal
for a 17 year old boy

984
00:37:15,387 --> 00:37:17,387
"not to be sexually active?"

985
00:37:17,387 --> 00:37:19,807
- But, eventually we get
to the point where both

986
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:22,187
of our hips are just in constant movement.

987
00:37:22,187 --> 00:37:24,547
- "The fact that he's still
a virgin doesn't bother me.

988
00:37:24,547 --> 00:37:27,287
"What bothers me is that
at his age, don't you think

989
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,527
"he should at least be fooling around?

990
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:31,167
"He's a good looking
boy, don't you think?"

991
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,867
- And he's getting
frustrated, which is making

992
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:34,747
the making out less
enjoyable, and I'm just

993
00:37:34,747 --> 00:37:36,387
getting really pissed.

994
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,747
- And, this girl is just
too stunned to speak.

995
00:37:38,747 --> 00:37:40,627
She's literally just
squirming in her chair.

996
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:42,988
- And, all I can think is
doesn't he get it by now?

997
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:44,908
- And, just when I think
my mom's gonna stop.

998
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:46,267
- And, I just get tot the
point where I don't even

999
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:47,347
wanna kiss him anymore.

1000
00:37:47,347 --> 00:37:49,567
- Finally, she says, "Tell
me doesn't your boyfriend

1001
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,067
"try to copulate with you?"

1002
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:53,957
- And eventually I just yell,
"I'm not going to fuck you."

1003
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:59,167
- This girl she says,
"Oh, I gotta go," you know

1004
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:02,727
and she takes her stuff
and literally just sprints

1005
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:03,727
out the door.

1006
00:38:03,727 --> 00:38:07,547
- Yeah well, by that
point I'd kinda forgotten

1007
00:38:07,548 --> 00:38:10,288
there were like six
other people in the pool.

1008
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:11,687
- So, after that I was just like screw it,

1009
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:14,468
why take this stuff so
seriously, you know?

1010
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:16,328
And, from that point on I
just kinda do whatever I want,

1011
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,307
just refuse to put too
much thought into it.

1012
00:38:19,307 --> 00:38:21,187
- All the movement stops in the pool

1013
00:38:21,187 --> 00:38:23,727
and everybody just starts
laughing their asses off.

1014
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:27,387
And, he get really embarassed
and he broke up with me.

1015
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,249
- [Mason] Okay, she's not too uptight,

1016
00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:30,769
but she's not too slutty either.

1017
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:31,488
I dig it.

1018
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:33,189
- [Leroy] You know it's
important to walk that line

1019
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:34,888
that fun in bed, but won't cheat on you.

1020
00:38:34,888 --> 00:38:36,908
- [Victor] I always preferred
it when girls cheated on me.

1021
00:38:36,908 --> 00:38:38,088
- [Leroy] What? Why?

1022
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:39,948
- [Victor] 'Cause then
they can't bitch so much

1023
00:38:39,948 --> 00:38:41,908
when you sleep with other women.

1024
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:46,648
Keep 'em closed.

1025
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:47,393
- [Crystal] Come on.

1026
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:49,233
- Okay, open, open, open.
- [Crystal] How and I gonna--

1027
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:51,033
- Here, look, look.

1028
00:38:51,033 --> 00:38:52,623
Look, I got you something really special.

1029
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:54,863
- Oh my god.

1030
00:38:56,273 --> 00:38:59,013
Vanilla rum, how did you even remember?

1031
00:38:59,013 --> 00:39:00,193
- Well--

1032
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:03,113
- I have never seen this anywhere
other than the Carribean.

1033
00:39:03,113 --> 00:39:04,433
Where did you get it?

1034
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:07,053
- I found a place across
river that special ordered it.

1035
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,573
And then, went over and picked it up.

1036
00:39:09,574 --> 00:39:11,834
- You drove all the way to the east side

1037
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,043
just to get this for me?

1038
00:39:13,753 --> 00:39:15,873
- [Leroy] Well that and to
get a lapdance at the Emerald.

1039
00:39:15,873 --> 00:39:17,693
- [Victor] Hey, they got
great lunch specials.

1040
00:39:17,693 --> 00:39:18,793
It's good food.

1041
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:22,753
- Well, you know I mean I'm
there from time to time so.

1042
00:39:22,753 --> 00:39:25,783
- Yeah, I bet you are.

1043
00:39:27,113 --> 00:39:28,163
My god.

1044
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,883
I can't believe how sweet you are.

1045
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,083
Do you wanna get drunk and do it?

1046
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:41,743
- Yes.

1047
00:39:45,353 --> 00:39:47,413
- [Bernard] Hmm, it's like another Victor,

1048
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:48,813
only with breasts.

1049
00:39:48,813 --> 00:39:50,603
- [Victor] Oh, what could be better?

1050
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:56,003
(slow tempo music)

1051
00:40:12,573 --> 00:40:15,653
- You know, I don't want you
to think I'm a certain way.

1052
00:40:15,653 --> 00:40:18,113
- What? I don't, I do not.

1053
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:21,513
- I've only slept with
one guy in my entire life.

1054
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:24,405
- [Victor] Bullshit.

1055
00:40:24,405 --> 00:40:26,485
- [Mason] Shut up, asshole,
she was telling the truth.

1056
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:28,595
- No way, come on one guy?

1057
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:31,405
- I'm only 23.

1058
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:34,725
- Yeah, yeah, but one.

1059
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:36,015
- Yeah.

1060
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:41,776
- All right. One guy?

1061
00:40:42,926 --> 00:40:46,556
(laughs)

1062
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:57,982
Sorry.

1063
00:40:57,983 --> 00:41:00,873
- [Victor] Oh Jesus, what the fuck?

1064
00:41:04,024 --> 00:41:06,634
- It's just the second date, you know?

1065
00:41:07,644 --> 00:41:08,714
- [Victor] And?

1066
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:13,884
- I thought we had more
than a two date connection

1067
00:41:13,884 --> 00:41:15,094
going here.

1068
00:41:15,926 --> 00:41:17,086
- Are you kidding?

1069
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:19,297
We have like 102 date vibe going here.

1070
00:41:19,747 --> 00:41:22,297
I just...I'm just...

1071
00:41:23,287 --> 00:41:24,067
You know what it is?

1072
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:26,307
I'm just used to it kinda
being the other way around,

1073
00:41:26,306 --> 00:41:29,376
the whole who's trying to
get into whose pants game.

1074
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:33,376
- [Victor] Hey, so consider
yourself lucky, dickweed.

1075
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:35,436
- Yeah, me too.

1076
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:38,597
- It just kinda threw me.

1077
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:44,316
Come here, I'm sorry.

1078
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:54,927
- [Victor] Oh, oh dude,
you better fuck her.

1079
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:57,647
Seriously man, you better fuck her.

1080
00:42:02,388 --> 00:42:06,178
Oh, Jesus Christ, you have
got to fucking be kidding me.

1081
00:42:11,568 --> 00:42:12,598
- I should go.

1082
00:42:17,728 --> 00:42:18,818
- What?

1083
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:20,629
Mason, what the hell is the matter?

1084
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,950
- [Victor] Yeah, what
the hell is the matter?

1085
00:42:22,951 --> 00:42:24,951
- You know what, I don't know.

1086
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:28,781
Maybe we're not entirely--

1087
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:30,591
- [Victor] Not entirely what?

1088
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:32,991
All right, she's an Asian
chick with big titties,

1089
00:42:32,992 --> 00:42:34,312
that never happens.

1090
00:42:34,312 --> 00:42:35,662
What entirely else do you need?

1091
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:36,872
- What?

1092
00:42:36,873 --> 00:42:37,873
- I don't know okay?

1093
00:42:37,873 --> 00:42:40,963
I don't know how I feel.

1094
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:44,993
I'm sorry.

1095
00:42:44,994 --> 00:42:47,024
- [Victor] I'm sorry my
penis is chronically limp.

1096
00:42:47,874 --> 00:42:50,824
- I'll call you or...bye.

1097
00:42:52,014 --> 00:42:54,254
- [VIctor] Oh, that's
it you're a homosexual.

1098
00:42:54,254 --> 00:42:56,114
- [Mason] You know what, fuck you?

1099
00:42:56,114 --> 00:42:57,714
Okay, maybe my interest
in this girl went deeper

1100
00:42:57,714 --> 00:42:59,434
than her vaginal cavity and I'm sorry

1101
00:42:59,434 --> 00:43:00,684
you can't understand that.

1102
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:02,475
- [Victor] Hey, here's a
concept maybe you can be

1103
00:43:02,475 --> 00:43:06,515
in love with her and still sleep with her.

1104
00:43:07,894 --> 00:43:09,594
Hey buddy, let me tell
you how a heterosexual

1105
00:43:09,594 --> 00:43:10,664
handles this situation.

1106
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,210
Whoa.

1107
00:43:16,212 --> 00:43:17,242
- Yeah.

1108
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:23,532
- [Bernard] Stop liar, no
woman actually likes it rough

1109
00:43:23,532 --> 00:43:24,632
like that.

1110
00:43:24,632 --> 00:43:26,472
- [Victor] Look, they all
like it rough, all right?

1111
00:43:26,472 --> 00:43:28,342
Some girls just don't know it yet.

1112
00:43:30,492 --> 00:43:31,422
Yes.

1113
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:32,812
(laughs)

1114
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:33,691
(grunts)

1115
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:34,621
You're so...

1116
00:43:37,472 --> 00:43:41,022
Hey, question where are
all of your vibrators?

1117
00:43:42,232 --> 00:43:45,342
- They're in the repair shop,
and I wear those things out.

1118
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:48,872
- I'm sure you do, but
they didn't give you

1119
00:43:48,872 --> 00:43:50,382
like loaner or anything?

1120
00:43:51,612 --> 00:43:53,692
- Uh-huh, they didn't have any in stock

1121
00:43:53,692 --> 00:43:55,212
that met my sexual preference.

1122
00:43:56,603 --> 00:44:00,823
- I'm sorry, so you have it all

1123
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,510
to lube this up right?

1124
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:05,179
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1125
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,940
You're not actually
going to try and stick it

1126
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,820
in my butt are you?

1127
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,490
- Oh god, of course not
what are you kidding?

1128
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,960
You know, I heard that people
tend to, well you're welcome

1129
00:44:15,959 --> 00:44:19,779
like you people tend to
make jokes when they can't

1130
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,780
admit to something, so in reality

1131
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,410
I think you actually want
me to stick it in your butt.

1132
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,580
- [Bernard] You know,
that's actually true.

1133
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,100
It's a psychological phenomenon called--

1134
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,080
- [Mason] Victor, you're the
one that keeps bringing it up.

1135
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:38,241
I guess that means you want
her to stick it in your butt.

1136
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:39,941
- [Victor] If you
interrupt me one more time

1137
00:44:39,941 --> 00:44:41,641
I'm gonna fucking smack you.

1138
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,730
- No.

1139
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:49,311
(groans)

1140
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,780
- [Mason] Did you stick it in her butt?

1141
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,000
- [Victor] Totally.
- [Bernard] Liar.

1142
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,250
- [Victor] Yeah, okay I'm lying.

1143
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,170
(laughs)

1144
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,140
- So, I was a figure
skater in junior high.

1145
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,750
I even did my own choreography.

1146
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,450
- Wow.

1147
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:10,190
- Yeah, so my parents
finally thought that was what

1148
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:12,390
I was gonna settle into, but then I quit.

1149
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,450
- Why'd you quit?

1150
00:45:15,077 --> 00:45:17,537
- I don't know, I saw
some people at the rink

1151
00:45:17,537 --> 00:45:19,447
speed skating so I did that for a while.

1152
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:21,747
- And then, after that
you took up painting?

1153
00:45:22,397 --> 00:45:25,317
- Well, after playing cello
in the highschool orchestra

1154
00:45:25,317 --> 00:45:27,077
and studying Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

1155
00:45:27,078 --> 00:45:28,578
- Oh my god.

1156
00:45:28,578 --> 00:45:30,738
- Yeah, when I get interested in something

1157
00:45:30,738 --> 00:45:32,318
I tend to jump in with both feet.

1158
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:33,938
- Yeah, apparently.

1159
00:45:33,938 --> 00:45:36,248
(laughs)

1160
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:40,137
So, how do you think
the date's going so far?

1161
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:44,187
- Well, I thought that this wasn't a date.

1162
00:45:45,057 --> 00:45:47,747
- [Victor] Leroy, only you
would be a big enough pussy to

1163
00:45:47,751 --> 00:45:51,431
take a girl out to dinner and
then tell her it's not a date.

1164
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:52,637
- [Leroy] Shut up, fuck face.

1165
00:45:53,638 --> 00:45:54,758
- Right, right.

1166
00:45:55,674 --> 00:45:57,954
How do you think
this-is-not-a-date is going?

1167
00:45:57,954 --> 00:46:00,354
(laughs)

1168
00:46:00,354 --> 00:46:03,894
- I think it's going pretty well.

1169
00:46:05,735 --> 00:46:07,415
I caught myself trying to
impress you once or twice,

1170
00:46:07,415 --> 00:46:09,505
which is usually a good sign.

1171
00:46:11,065 --> 00:46:12,845
- Well, if I don't try to
impress you don't take that

1172
00:46:12,845 --> 00:46:14,095
as a sign I don't like you.

1173
00:46:14,095 --> 00:46:17,035
I kicked myself of that
habit a long time ago.

1174
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:19,335
When I was in highschool I always thought

1175
00:46:19,335 --> 00:46:21,675
the kids that were really
funny were really well liked.

1176
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:24,769
- So, when you're in the
sixth grade you're what, 12?

1177
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:26,759
- Yeah, sounds right.

1178
00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:29,819
- So, kids started experimenting
with kissing and such.

1179
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:34,279
- So, I started trying to be
funny and it kinda worked.

1180
00:46:34,279 --> 00:46:36,399
- I don't really think that
my hormones had kicked in

1181
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:39,939
because I really didn't
like kissing the first boy

1182
00:46:39,939 --> 00:46:40,959
that I kissed.

1183
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:44,899
- And then, I asked out
this really pretty girl.

1184
00:46:44,899 --> 00:46:46,739
- But, somewhere in my mind
that I knew I was supposed

1185
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:49,559
to like kissing someone, so I started

1186
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:51,259
a little experimenting.

1187
00:46:51,259 --> 00:46:53,919
- And, she said, "Okay."

1188
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:56,559
- Yeah, it's not as pervy
as you're probably thinking.

1189
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,160
I was 12, it was just kissing.

1190
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,820
- So, you know, then I
was all excited 'cause,

1191
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,880
you know, I thought was really
going to have some friends

1192
00:47:02,883 --> 00:47:04,843
and a girlfriend, and actually be happy.

1193
00:47:04,843 --> 00:47:08,543
- Well, I kissed a boy with
tongue, but I thought that

1194
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,003
was kinda gross.

1195
00:47:10,003 --> 00:47:13,783
- So, before my date with
this girl we had a field trip

1196
00:47:13,782 --> 00:47:15,242
to the like science center.

1197
00:47:15,242 --> 00:47:17,182
- Then, I kissed this
foreign exchange student

1198
00:47:17,182 --> 00:47:18,702
who really didn't speak any English.

1199
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,602
- And, a bunch of us, including this girl,

1200
00:47:20,603 --> 00:47:23,083
are running around and
we're just, you know,

1201
00:47:23,082 --> 00:47:25,102
yukking it up and having fun.

1202
00:47:25,102 --> 00:47:26,782
- Then, I kissed a girl.

1203
00:47:26,782 --> 00:47:28,222
- You see these guys they're like making

1204
00:47:28,222 --> 00:47:30,282
a big, fake dinosaur skeleton.

1205
00:47:30,282 --> 00:47:34,542
- It wasn't too long after
that that my guidance counselor

1206
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:39,182
had a meeting with my mother
who just absolutely lost it.

1207
00:47:39,182 --> 00:47:42,102
- And so, I run up to them
and I start pretending

1208
00:47:42,102 --> 00:47:46,132
that I'm mentally, well retarded.

1209
00:47:47,402 --> 00:47:50,142
- I remember I was
sitting outside the office

1210
00:47:50,142 --> 00:47:53,462
and I knew what they were talking about,

1211
00:47:53,462 --> 00:47:54,922
but I couldn't actually hear anything.

1212
00:47:54,922 --> 00:47:57,572
- So, I'm like walking funny
and drooling on myself.

1213
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:00,412
And I've got my hand up like
this, like I've got some sort

1214
00:48:00,412 --> 00:48:01,502
of palsy or something.

1215
00:48:01,502 --> 00:48:04,582
- Until my mother starts shouting,

1216
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:07,723
"Oh no, oh no, oh no."

1217
00:48:07,723 --> 00:48:09,203
- And, I start going,
"How do you do that?"

1218
00:48:09,203 --> 00:48:10,203
(laughs)

1219
00:48:10,204 --> 00:48:11,164
"How do you do that?"

1220
00:48:12,683 --> 00:48:16,073
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure that
the last one was the girl.

1221
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:17,236
- [Leroy] The girl, right.
- Yeah.

1222
00:48:17,236 --> 00:48:18,186
(laughs)

1223
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,246
- And, my new friends are like dying.

1224
00:48:20,246 --> 00:48:22,226
They're about to pee themselves
they're laughing so hard.

1225
00:48:22,226 --> 00:48:25,966
- So, my mother she comes
bursting out of the office

1226
00:48:25,966 --> 00:48:27,766
and she grabs me by the hand without even

1227
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:31,746
looking me in the eye and throws
me in the back of the car.

1228
00:48:31,746 --> 00:48:35,086
- And, I look back and
the girl's not there.

1229
00:48:35,086 --> 00:48:37,486
- She's driving down the
road like this maniac

1230
00:48:37,486 --> 00:48:40,406
holding this business card.

1231
00:48:40,406 --> 00:48:42,586
- I'm so bummed because
like everyone thought

1232
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,926
I was so funny and she missed it.

1233
00:48:43,926 --> 00:48:46,566
- And, we pull up to this
building and then next thing

1234
00:48:46,566 --> 00:48:49,046
I know I'm in a psychiatrist's office.

1235
00:48:49,046 --> 00:48:51,646
- Then, someone says that they
saw her off crying somewhere.

1236
00:48:51,646 --> 00:48:56,246
- My mother was so convinced
that I was completely warped

1237
00:48:56,246 --> 00:48:58,186
and if she didn't intervene
I was gonna become like

1238
00:48:58,887 --> 00:49:01,207
a bisexual, nympho prostitute, you know.

1239
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:02,107
- [Leroy] My god.

1240
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:05,187
Yeah, and so I guess she
caught the first half

1241
00:49:05,187 --> 00:49:07,527
of the bit, but then she ran off.

1242
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,347
- So, everytime she'd
take me in to see this guy

1243
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:13,846
this doctor just kept
badgering me and asking me

1244
00:49:13,846 --> 00:49:16,266
if I knew that what I'd done was wrong.

1245
00:49:16,267 --> 00:49:18,437
- It turns out that
like when she was a kid

1246
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:21,488
she had a hearing problem,
but that the doctor

1247
00:49:21,488 --> 00:49:22,858
diagnosed her as retarded.

1248
00:49:23,575 --> 00:49:27,235
- I just sat there with my
arms crossed and I refused

1249
00:49:27,235 --> 00:49:29,845
to answer 'cause, you
know, I didn't think that

1250
00:49:30,591 --> 00:49:32,141
I'd done anything wrong.

1251
00:49:32,153 --> 00:49:34,953
- So, I don't know I guess
her dad distanced himself

1252
00:49:34,953 --> 00:49:37,963
from her and the whole
thing really scarred her.

1253
00:49:38,873 --> 00:49:40,233
She didn't think my joke was so funny.

1254
00:49:40,234 --> 00:49:42,934
- And then, you know, finally
one day I was just fed up

1255
00:49:42,934 --> 00:49:44,894
with the whole thing so when he asked me

1256
00:49:44,894 --> 00:49:47,134
what was the right way to kiss someone

1257
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:49,714
I said, "One boy that
you're in love with."

1258
00:49:49,714 --> 00:49:51,644
- And, she didn't want
to date me after that.

1259
00:49:51,636 --> 00:49:53,256
- And, then when he told that to my mother

1260
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,136
she almost collapsed from
the release of tension

1261
00:49:55,136 --> 00:49:56,356
she was so relieved.

1262
00:49:56,357 --> 00:49:57,457
(laughs)

1263
00:49:57,457 --> 00:49:59,127
- And, all those people
that were laughing so hard

1264
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:00,717
were friends with her
longer than me, you know,

1265
00:50:00,717 --> 00:50:02,297
so they all kinda gave me the boot.

1266
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:05,436
- Yeah, she took me home and no aspect

1267
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:07,646
of any of it was ever
mentioned by my family again.

1268
00:50:08,827 --> 00:50:10,507
- And, the only reason I
did it in the first place

1269
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,697
is 'cause I wanted them to like me.

1270
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:14,717
- [Bernard] I dunno if
I woulda told that story

1271
00:50:14,717 --> 00:50:16,367
on a first date.

1272
00:50:29,136 --> 00:50:32,136
- So, were you out with that
Angela chick last night?

1273
00:50:32,137 --> 00:50:34,037
- No, man no actually I wasn't.

1274
00:50:34,037 --> 00:50:35,717
After the first date, you
know, she started to get

1275
00:50:35,717 --> 00:50:36,557
all weird on me so...

1276
00:50:37,438 --> 00:50:39,238
- [Victor] Yeah, she wanted
to have sex with you.

1277
00:50:39,238 --> 00:50:40,488
That's just bizarre.

1278
00:50:41,258 --> 00:50:42,798
- I don't know, I mean
I really dig her, man.

1279
00:50:42,798 --> 00:50:45,698
Honestly, I think she's really
cool, but I just don't know.

1280
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:46,919
Something, you know.

1281
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,288
- So, who were you out with then?

1282
00:50:49,078 --> 00:50:52,098
- Just his girl I seriously
doubt I'll ever see her again.

1283
00:50:52,098 --> 00:50:52,898
- Why not?

1284
00:50:52,898 --> 00:50:54,868
- I don't know, so we go
back to her house, thanks,

1285
00:50:54,882 --> 00:50:58,462
after the first date
and, you know, I'm about

1286
00:50:58,463 --> 00:51:00,123
to like go down on her.

1287
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,593
- [Leroy] Wait, you
thought it was too soon

1288
00:51:01,593 --> 00:51:03,623
to sleep with Angela after
two dates, but this other girl

1289
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:04,984
you'll nail after one date?

1290
00:51:04,984 --> 00:51:06,524
- [Mason] Yeah, but the
other girl was a slut.

1291
00:51:06,524 --> 00:51:08,404
you can do whatever you
want with a chick like that.

1292
00:51:08,404 --> 00:51:09,594
It doesn't matter.

1293
00:51:10,645 --> 00:51:13,025
- And, there's just something
there that, I don't know,

1294
00:51:13,025 --> 00:51:14,525
kinda stopped me, I
couldn't go through with it.

1295
00:51:14,527 --> 00:51:17,577
- Okay, what was so off that
it stopped you from hitting it?

1296
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:19,817
- Well, first off it was shaved.

1297
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:21,847
- So, you never boffed a baldie before?

1298
00:51:21,848 --> 00:51:22,928
Come on, man.

1299
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:25,149
- It was shaved so you
could see the tattoo.

1300
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,410
- Oh, a tattoo.

1301
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:27,430
- Yeah.

1302
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:28,720
- Okay, what was it a picture of?

1303
00:51:29,429 --> 00:51:30,849
- Nothing, nothing.

1304
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,770
- I mean man, it had to be something.

1305
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:33,790
- Just two words, that was it.

1306
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,201
- [VIctor] Okay, what did it say?

1307
00:51:36,633 --> 00:51:37,573
- Joe's box.

1308
00:51:37,574 --> 00:51:38,684
- Joe's box?

1309
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:44,144
- Simple block letters,
you know J-O-E apostrophe S

1310
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:46,295
next line box, B-O-X.

1311
00:51:47,114 --> 00:51:49,284
Joe's box, Joe's box.

1312
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:50,836
- Who the fuck's Joe?

1313
00:51:50,836 --> 00:51:52,816
- I dunno, do you know him 'cause I don't.

1314
00:51:52,816 --> 00:51:55,176
- What I'm saying is like
why the hell is his name

1315
00:51:55,176 --> 00:51:56,536
tattooed on her...

1316
00:51:56,535 --> 00:51:58,725
- Well, it was probably
from an ex-boyfriend.

1317
00:51:59,715 --> 00:52:01,165
- Why would she get
her ex-boyfriend's name

1318
00:52:01,165 --> 00:52:02,435
tattooed on her pussy?

1319
00:52:02,436 --> 00:52:04,486
- Because they were probably
going out at the time.

1320
00:52:06,097 --> 00:52:06,977
- Right.

1321
00:52:06,977 --> 00:52:08,527
- Yeah, so after that,
you know, it just kinda

1322
00:52:08,527 --> 00:52:09,677
killed the moment for me.

1323
00:52:09,676 --> 00:52:10,726
- Man, what's wrong with you?

1324
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:12,566
Okay, a hottie's going to
let you get all up inside her

1325
00:52:12,566 --> 00:52:14,816
you can't let a little
thing like a tattoo claim

1326
00:52:14,816 --> 00:52:16,696
vaginal ownership, stop it.

1327
00:52:16,696 --> 00:52:18,756
You gotta get it up, stick it in, work it

1328
00:52:18,758 --> 00:52:20,148
and fucking own it, man.

1329
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:22,418
- I can't own it, Vic.

1330
00:52:22,418 --> 00:52:23,418
- Why not?

1331
00:52:23,418 --> 00:52:24,388
- Because

1332
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,639
it's Joe's box.

1333
00:52:26,638 --> 00:52:29,098
- Man, the Mason I know and love

1334
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:32,339
would have hit that and
made her call him Joe.

1335
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,860
All right, what's with you man?

1336
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:34,881
- Nothing.

1337
00:52:34,882 --> 00:52:37,242
- [Victor] That's bullshit
man, I didn't keep calling

1338
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:39,301
Crystal, I called her like once.

1339
00:52:39,301 --> 00:52:41,111
- [Mason] Please, dude, you
called her like four times

1340
00:52:41,111 --> 00:52:42,161
just while we were at the bar.

1341
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:43,401
- [Victor] Oh Jesus, that's amazing.

1342
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:45,141
You know what, you're
like stoned and retarded

1343
00:52:45,141 --> 00:52:46,181
at the same time.

1344
00:52:46,181 --> 00:52:47,631
- [Mason] No, you just
didn't want to admit

1345
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:50,501
you were lodged entirely up
her ass and couldn't crawl out.

1346
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:53,541
- [Victor] Oh, okay, okay, yup that's it.

1347
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:54,322
(smack)

1348
00:52:54,322 --> 00:52:55,262
- [Mason] Ow, fucking
(smack)

1349
00:52:55,261 --> 00:52:57,021
- [Victor] Oh, I'm gonna
bitch slap you 'till you

1350
00:52:57,021 --> 00:52:58,701
fucking cry.
(smack)

1351
00:52:58,701 --> 00:52:59,681
- [Mason] Stop it.
(smack)

1352
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:00,641
- [Victor] Ouch.
(smack)

1353
00:53:00,641 --> 00:53:02,961
- [Mason] Fuck you.
(smacks)

1354
00:53:02,963 --> 00:53:03,903
- [Leroy] Hey, watch it.

1355
00:53:03,903 --> 00:53:05,003
(liquid pouring)

1356
00:53:05,002 --> 00:53:07,242
Okay, you two pansies
own me another drink.

1357
00:53:07,242 --> 00:53:08,612
- [Bernard] This better not stain.

1358
00:53:10,442 --> 00:53:13,742
- God, you see it went straight
to her voicemail, again.

1359
00:53:13,742 --> 00:53:14,702
- So, leave a message.

1360
00:53:14,702 --> 00:53:16,142
- Does she think she can play a player?

1361
00:53:16,142 --> 00:53:17,042
- Maybe she just--

1362
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:18,302
- I mean she liked me, I know she did.

1363
00:53:18,302 --> 00:53:20,082
I mean, don't you think she liked me?

1364
00:53:20,082 --> 00:53:22,442
- Vic, I just met her that one time.

1365
00:53:22,442 --> 00:53:24,142
- I mean if she liked
me why would she go out

1366
00:53:24,142 --> 00:53:26,342
with another guy, it just
doesn't make sense, man.

1367
00:53:26,342 --> 00:53:28,742
- Oh dude, just because her
cellphone's turned off--

1368
00:53:28,742 --> 00:53:31,452
- Does she think I'm stupid? Huh?

1369
00:53:32,023 --> 00:53:33,953
I fucking invented that trick, bitch.

1370
00:53:40,362 --> 00:53:42,172
- Well, rockabilly.

1371
00:53:42,962 --> 00:53:46,072
Some folk music, Cat Stevens and such.

1372
00:53:47,563 --> 00:53:50,883
Oh, I love that old sixties Jamaican Ska.

1373
00:53:50,883 --> 00:53:53,183
- Oh cool, that's cool.

1374
00:53:53,183 --> 00:53:55,223
- I don't know I like just
about any type of music.

1375
00:53:55,223 --> 00:53:57,463
Well, except for country.

1376
00:53:57,463 --> 00:53:58,993
- Well, yeah of course.

1377
00:53:59,962 --> 00:54:01,582
- [Bernard] Seriously, I'd
like to know what's wrong

1378
00:54:01,582 --> 00:54:02,492
with country.

1379
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,963
- Well, here we are back where we started.

1380
00:54:07,962 --> 00:54:09,132
- Yep.

1381
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:16,372
- [Victor] Yes!

1382
00:54:26,462 --> 00:54:28,032
- I got no idea what to do next.

1383
00:54:29,222 --> 00:54:30,392
- What would you like to do?

1384
00:54:32,522 --> 00:54:33,712
- Come upstairs with you.

1385
00:54:34,402 --> 00:54:36,922
- [Mason] Oh, that's it you just blew it.

1386
00:54:36,922 --> 00:54:39,622
- [Victor] Oh no man, okay
she gave him an opening,

1387
00:54:39,622 --> 00:54:41,182
all right he had to try and get in there.

1388
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:42,719
No hey, you made the right call, buddy.

1389
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:45,249
But, next time say it like a man.

1390
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,779
- Nice try big guy, I
gave you a date that's all

1391
00:54:49,779 --> 00:54:51,659
you're gonna get until you
break up with your fiance.

1392
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:53,439
- I'm not engaged.

1393
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,509
- Whatever, you're involved.

1394
00:54:56,399 --> 00:54:58,379
- [Victor] Yeah, this is where
you whip out your cell phone

1395
00:54:58,379 --> 00:54:59,599
and start dialing.

1396
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,499
"Hey Denise, listen so
I met a hot redhead.

1397
00:55:03,499 --> 00:55:06,399
"Yeah, uh-huh we're done, okay."

1398
00:55:06,399 --> 00:55:08,459
Come on man, things like
this are the whole reason

1399
00:55:08,459 --> 00:55:10,389
they invented cell phones
in the first place.

1400
00:55:12,259 --> 00:55:14,899
- I just want to show you
something I've been working on.

1401
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,940
- Working on?

1402
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,940
- Yeah, I'm creating a
new style of architecture.

1403
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,920
- [Victor] Oh Christ, you are killing me.

1404
00:55:21,923 --> 00:55:23,463
- [Mason] It's better
than comic books, right?

1405
00:55:23,463 --> 00:55:25,273
- [Victor] I guess.

1406
00:55:26,223 --> 00:55:27,123
- You're kidding.

1407
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:31,223
- Uh-uh, and I brought my
blueprints, they're in my car.

1408
00:55:31,222 --> 00:55:33,952
And, I've never showed
them to anyone before.

1409
00:55:34,862 --> 00:55:36,842
- [Mason] Wait, you brought blueprints?

1410
00:55:36,842 --> 00:55:38,102
- You brought blueprints?

1411
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:39,962
- Yeah.
(laughs)

1412
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,842
'Cause, I knew we'd click, I knew it.

1413
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:44,112
And, I knew when we did I'd
want to show 'em to you, so...

1414
00:55:45,202 --> 00:55:46,572
I don't know, you're artistic so I think

1415
00:55:46,572 --> 00:55:47,632
you'll understand it.

1416
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:48,852
- Okay.

1417
00:55:48,852 --> 00:55:49,682
- Yeah?
- [Lily] Yeah.

1418
00:55:49,682 --> 00:55:51,542
- Okay cool, you hang
on I'm gonna go get 'em.

1419
00:55:51,542 --> 00:55:53,172
- Okay.
- [Leroy] Okay, excellent.

1420
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,109
- [Leroy] Oh well looky there
guys, she's wants to see

1421
00:55:56,109 --> 00:55:57,119
my blueprints.

1422
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,999
- [Victor] Wow, then I take
it all back, you're comic book

1423
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,960
and blueprints panty
removal scheme is brilliant.

1424
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,900
- [Mason] You had it planned
like that from the beginning,

1425
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,670
didn't you buddy?

1426
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,800
- [Bernard] I guess we all
failed to see the subtle workings

1427
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:10,091
of an evil genius.

1428
00:56:10,642 --> 00:56:11,892
- [Leroy] Shut up you dickheads.

1429
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,821
- Okay, so my original concept
was to create a new style

1430
00:56:19,818 --> 00:56:21,718
of architecture that would be geometric

1431
00:56:21,717 --> 00:56:23,217
bordering on organic.

1432
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:24,997
Okay, for which I was using
early Distill paintings

1433
00:56:24,997 --> 00:56:26,017
as inspiration.

1434
00:56:26,017 --> 00:56:27,297
- Okay.

1435
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:29,957
- Cool, okay so but everything
I was coming up with

1436
00:56:29,957 --> 00:56:32,917
was looking a lot like
Gehry's Guggenheim in Bilbao,

1437
00:56:32,918 --> 00:56:34,938
which is super cool but it
wouldn't be my own style.

1438
00:56:34,938 --> 00:56:36,178
So, I started thinking--

1439
00:56:36,178 --> 00:56:39,318
- Wait, wait I'm sorry
are you saying that you're

1440
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:41,878
trying to create a new
style of architecture?

1441
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:43,358
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1442
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,798
- Oh, I thought you meant that you were

1443
00:56:45,797 --> 00:56:47,417
experimenting.

1444
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:48,697
You know, following a train of thought

1445
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:51,447
and you stumbled across something unique.

1446
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:53,837
- What does it matter?

1447
00:56:53,837 --> 00:56:57,227
- Well, it matters
because doing like this is

1448
00:56:58,457 --> 00:56:59,907
well, it's artificial.

1449
00:57:00,557 --> 00:57:02,517
- [Bernard] Oh shit, I
know what happens next.

1450
00:57:02,517 --> 00:57:03,957
- [Victor] Okay, you're
in her apartment man,

1451
00:57:03,957 --> 00:57:05,577
you're about to seal the deal.

1452
00:57:05,577 --> 00:57:08,247
All right, keep your eyes on the prize.

1453
00:57:10,017 --> 00:57:11,477
- Huh, you know what
I don't wanna show you

1454
00:57:11,477 --> 00:57:12,757
my blueprints anymore.

1455
00:57:12,757 --> 00:57:14,697
- [Mason] Oh shit, I knew it.

1456
00:57:14,698 --> 00:57:16,558
Couldn't stop yourself could you?

1457
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,529
- [Bernard] Mister hypersensitive,
just like eighth grade.

1458
00:57:20,158 --> 00:57:21,758
- Oh, no, no, no don't be like that.

1459
00:57:21,758 --> 00:57:23,208
- No, you're saying my architecture's bad,

1460
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:24,068
you haven't even seen it.

1461
00:57:24,068 --> 00:57:26,958
- No, I'm not saying your work is bad.

1462
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:30,428
I'm stating an intellectual
opinion about your theory.

1463
00:57:31,408 --> 00:57:32,558
Look, maybe I'll like the designs.

1464
00:57:32,558 --> 00:57:34,468
- No, you may not see my blueprints.

1465
00:57:35,248 --> 00:57:36,968
I can't even believe i
thought you were open minded

1466
00:57:36,968 --> 00:57:37,828
enough to understand it.

1467
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,939
- All right, yeah you know what fine.

1468
00:57:39,939 --> 00:57:41,769
Why don't you show them
to your girlfriend?

1469
00:57:41,769 --> 00:57:43,479
I'm sure she'll tell you
they're the greatest thing

1470
00:57:43,479 --> 00:57:44,259
she's ever seen.

1471
00:57:44,257 --> 00:57:45,047
- Yeah, I'm gonna.

1472
00:57:45,047 --> 00:57:45,877
- Well do that.

1473
00:57:45,884 --> 00:57:47,284
- Great, I bet she's gonna love 'em.

1474
00:57:47,284 --> 00:57:48,874
(clatter and thud)

1475
00:57:51,904 --> 00:57:53,714
- [Bernard] You're kind
of a baby, aren't you?

1476
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:57,061
- [Leroy] Yeah, pretty
much, yes. Yes, I am.

1477
00:57:57,061 --> 00:57:59,471
- [Bernard] Wait, you didn't
break up with Denise, did you?

1478
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:01,531
- [Leroy] You know, I walked home thinking

1479
00:58:01,531 --> 00:58:02,791
"I got it good with Denise.

1480
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:04,210
"I'm going back to her where I was happy."

1481
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:05,381
- [Bernard] But, you weren't happy.

1482
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,081
- [Leroy] Nope.

1483
00:58:06,081 --> 00:58:07,351
- [Bernard] So, you broke up with her.

1484
00:58:07,351 --> 00:58:08,031
- [Leroy] Yep.

1485
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:09,063
- [Bernard] How'd she take it?

1486
00:58:09,064 --> 00:58:11,374
- For the last two years,
two months, and 11 days

1487
00:58:11,371 --> 00:58:13,531
I've done everything for
you and yeah, you know what,

1488
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,471
that includes counting the
days we've been together.

1489
00:58:15,471 --> 00:58:18,211
Because, that's how much this
relationship means to me.

1490
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:20,891
I've hung out with your stupid,
asshole fucking friends.

1491
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:22,590
I've watched football with you on Sunday,

1492
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,751
and I even pretended to
give a shit every time

1493
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,131
you got an autograph from
some bald comic book writer

1494
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:27,910
in Cleveland.

1495
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,450
I mean, I listen to
you go on and on and on

1496
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,210
about your creative vision
and I even let you do

1497
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,390
whatever you want in bed,
even when it got weird.

1498
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,941
I mean, sticking your finger in my ass?

1499
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:40,361
What was that about?

1500
00:58:41,732 --> 00:58:42,632
You know what?

1501
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:44,953
You couldn't appreciate me,
fine, fine, just get out.

1502
00:58:44,952 --> 00:58:45,932
Just get out, all right.

1503
00:58:45,932 --> 00:58:48,462
I mean really, here take your jacket,

1504
00:58:49,672 --> 00:58:50,602
your guitar.

1505
00:58:51,392 --> 00:58:53,192
Don't forget your picture
of your asshole friends

1506
00:58:53,192 --> 00:58:55,172
in Vegas, take that, your
Frank Lloyd Wright book.

1507
00:58:55,172 --> 00:58:57,112
- Okay easy, okay, all right, all right.

1508
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:05,740
Are you gonna be--
(door slams)

1509
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:10,090
You know, by the way it was your sister

1510
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:11,800
who told me to stick
my finger in your ass.

1511
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,740
Evening, Ross. Lovely day.

1512
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:22,090
- [Victor] So, hey could
you hook me up with

1513
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,780
Denise's sister?

1514
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:30,381
- Sorry, we're closing.

1515
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,460
- Hi.

1516
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:43,380
- What were you freaking out about?

1517
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:47,110
- [Victor] I can't wait to hear this.

1518
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:49,100
- [Mason] Well, shut the
fuck up and listen then.

1519
00:59:49,111 --> 00:59:50,341
- I don't know.

1520
00:59:51,532 --> 00:59:54,372
I mean honestly, maybe I was just scared

1521
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:56,680
of ruining things by
moving too fast, you know?

1522
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,931
- And, you thought by
humiliating me it was a good way

1523
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,150
to avoid ruining things?

1524
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,310
- I never said I was that smart, so.

1525
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:05,460
(laughs)

1526
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,080
- You're not gay, are you?

1527
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:10,480
- [Victor] Yes!

1528
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,300
- Well,

1529
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:16,730
You know the Too Skinny
Jeds are coming to town,

1530
01:00:16,731 --> 01:00:17,581
you wanna go?

1531
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:19,210
- Is that a band?

1532
01:00:19,212 --> 01:00:23,092
- Yeah, yeah, yeah they
mix up a bunch of sounds,

1533
01:00:23,091 --> 01:00:24,251
rap most of their lyrics.

1534
01:00:24,251 --> 01:00:25,551
It's kinda like this kickass blend of--

1535
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:27,941
- Why should I go on
another date with you?

1536
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:31,441
- Because I'm crazy about you.

1537
01:00:32,071 --> 01:00:33,061
- [Leroy] Good answer.

1538
01:00:37,371 --> 01:00:38,811
- I mean, how many
times are you gonna find

1539
01:00:38,811 --> 01:00:41,001
a 102 date connection
after just two dates?

1540
01:00:41,791 --> 01:00:44,381
- It is gonna be like 102
dates before you get laid.

1541
01:00:44,731 --> 01:00:47,881
- Oh, I think I'm okay with that.

1542
01:00:47,892 --> 01:00:49,372
- [Victor] Hey listen,
don't worry about it.

1543
01:00:49,372 --> 01:00:51,562
All right, you know what
I prefer men anyway.

1544
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:53,492
- Yeah, okay I'll go.
- [Mason] Yeah?

1545
01:00:53,492 --> 01:00:55,332
- You don't have to sell me,
I'll go see any live show.

1546
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:56,562
- All right, awesome.

1547
01:00:57,092 --> 01:00:57,952
- Well, except country.

1548
01:00:57,952 --> 01:01:00,802
- Right, I understand that
'cause country blows, you know.

1549
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:04,043
- [Bernard] I like country music.

1550
01:01:11,453 --> 01:01:13,223
- Victor, move those pallets over there.

1551
01:01:14,693 --> 01:01:16,483
- Got it, Mister Gallagher.

1552
01:01:17,913 --> 01:01:18,743
- Psst.

1553
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:23,562
- Yeah.

1554
01:01:24,332 --> 01:01:25,232
- Wow, yeah

1555
01:01:25,232 --> 01:01:28,142
that's all I get is yeah?

1556
01:01:29,073 --> 01:01:30,463
- Hey, what do you want me to say?

1557
01:01:33,133 --> 01:01:35,063
- Why don't you just say what's what?

1558
01:01:35,673 --> 01:01:37,573
I mean why don't you just
say now that I've slept

1559
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:39,223
with you a couple of times
you're blowing me off.

1560
01:01:41,184 --> 01:01:43,274
- Okay, isn't that what
you should be saying to me?

1561
01:01:43,844 --> 01:01:44,574
- Why?

1562
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,264
Because I'm sitting at home like an idiot

1563
01:01:47,264 --> 01:01:48,804
all weekend waiting for you to call me,

1564
01:01:48,804 --> 01:01:50,864
that's me blowing you off, right?

1565
01:01:50,863 --> 01:01:53,163
- Right, okay just how
stupid do you think I am?

1566
01:01:53,163 --> 01:01:55,613
You think I don't know you
were out with another guy?

1567
01:01:56,123 --> 01:01:56,903
Please.

1568
01:01:56,903 --> 01:01:57,753
- What?

1569
01:01:58,343 --> 01:01:59,343
Who told you that?

1570
01:01:59,343 --> 01:02:00,843
- Nobody had to tell me that.

1571
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,465
I mean, I called your cell
phone what a dozen times

1572
01:02:03,465 --> 01:02:05,555
this weekend and each time
I called it went straight

1573
01:02:05,564 --> 01:02:08,804
to your voicemail which means
you turned off your phone.

1574
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:10,846
- [Bernard] Yikes, you're paranoid.

1575
01:02:10,846 --> 01:02:11,626
- [Victor] Hey, look.

1576
01:02:11,626 --> 01:02:13,396
- [Leroy] Yeah mean, if
you're gonna get all neurotic

1577
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,926
like that you should
learn to hide it better.

1578
01:02:14,926 --> 01:02:16,816
- [Victor] Fuck you, Leroy,
you're like the fucking king

1579
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:17,676
of neurotic.

1580
01:02:17,676 --> 01:02:19,366
- [Leroy] I know man, I'm
delivering wisdom to you

1581
01:02:19,366 --> 01:02:20,326
from a place of experience.

1582
01:02:20,326 --> 01:02:22,426
- [Victor] Wait, wait, wait
this totally wasn't my fault

1583
01:02:22,427 --> 01:02:23,927
all right, just shut up and listen.

1584
01:02:24,967 --> 01:02:28,667
- No I didn't. I didn't turn
off my phone once all weekend.

1585
01:02:29,437 --> 01:02:30,457
Not even when I was sleeping.

1586
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:33,767
- Bullshit, okay so why
didn't you pick up my calls?

1587
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:35,267
- You never called.

1588
01:02:36,197 --> 01:02:37,117
- [Victor] I never called?

1589
01:02:37,117 --> 01:02:38,337
- Yeah, you never called me.

1590
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:41,448
- I actually think you're
the last person here.

1591
01:02:44,258 --> 01:02:45,348
Your voicemail.

1592
01:02:47,437 --> 01:02:48,587
- Oh shit.

1593
01:02:50,377 --> 01:02:53,097
I don't know what happened,
my phone must be broken.

1594
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:56,480
- [Victor] See, there
you go. Not my fault.

1595
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,820
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1596
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,980
- Okay, so you weren't out with anybody?

1597
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:10,161
- Okay, you know what you
can apologize to me too.

1598
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:11,680
- For what?

1599
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,900
- For accusing me of cheating on you.

1600
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:19,800
I don't think I've done
anything to deserve that.

1601
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:24,580
- Hey, you're right, you're right.

1602
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:28,100
I'm sorry, hey, I'm sorry.

1603
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:32,130
I'm sorry, I did not mean
for this whole, fuck it.

1604
01:03:32,132 --> 01:03:35,842
Can we just forget this whole
stupid phone thing happened?

1605
01:03:38,311 --> 01:03:40,401
Please, I'm sorry I'm an idiot.

1606
01:03:44,012 --> 01:03:45,262
You're adorable.

1607
01:03:48,447 --> 01:03:49,757
(kiss)

1608
01:03:51,467 --> 01:03:52,457
Yeah.

1609
01:03:52,467 --> 01:03:53,777
- Look at that.

1610
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:56,798
You just got through our first big fight.

1611
01:03:56,797 --> 01:03:58,137
- Oh, yes.

1612
01:04:00,094 --> 01:04:03,184
- You know this relationship
is showing a lot of promise.

1613
01:04:03,175 --> 01:04:06,985
- So, because of that do
you think maybe I could

1614
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:12,325
stick it in your bum now?
- [Crystal] Shh, shh, shh.

1615
01:04:13,355 --> 01:04:15,775
- I mean, not now, you know, eventually.

1616
01:04:15,778 --> 01:04:17,908
(laughs)

1617
01:04:18,723 --> 01:04:21,013
- Now that we're getting
so close to one another,

1618
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,450
- Yes, yes.

1619
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,990
- there's not a fucking
chance of that happening.

1620
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:31,110
(sentimental music)

1621
01:04:32,279 --> 01:04:35,309
(phone tones)

1622
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:37,159
- [Lily] Hello?

1623
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,660
- Lilly, hi it's Leroy.

1624
01:04:38,661 --> 01:04:40,701
- Leroy, I'm not gonna let you--

1625
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,820
- I broke up with her.

1626
01:04:41,822 --> 01:04:43,722
I spent the day looking for apartments

1627
01:04:43,722 --> 01:04:46,792
and I just put down a
first month's rent on one.

1628
01:04:47,582 --> 01:04:49,432
(buzzer)

1629
01:04:53,301 --> 01:04:54,781
- Well, now that's different.

1630
01:04:54,781 --> 01:04:57,351
- Will you just forgive
me for that tantrum?

1631
01:04:58,001 --> 01:04:59,681
- [Mason] Tell her if she
says yes you'll take her

1632
01:04:59,681 --> 01:05:01,061
to her to a comic book convention.

1633
01:05:01,061 --> 01:05:02,191
That should close the deal.

1634
01:05:03,161 --> 01:05:06,341
- It depends on how
expensive dinner is tonight.

1635
01:05:06,341 --> 01:05:09,481
(laughs)

1636
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:11,831
- I got plans to make.
I'll pick you up at seven.

1637
01:05:11,831 --> 01:05:13,031
- You got it.

1638
01:05:13,031 --> 01:05:14,471
- Awesome.
(giggles)

1639
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:18,700
(kisses)

1640
01:05:20,786 --> 01:05:22,706
- I'm going.
- [Lily] Okay, go.

1641
01:05:22,707 --> 01:05:24,877

- [Bernard] I know, I
know a musical montage.

1661
01:07:00,535 --> 01:07:02,555
It's pretty cliche but
this is romantic comedy

1662
01:07:02,555 --> 01:07:03,755
so what are you gonna do?

1663
01:07:03,756 --> 01:07:05,916
What you need to know
is everybody's happy,

1664
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:08,676
everbody's going on dates,
everybody's falling in love.

1665
01:07:08,676 --> 01:07:10,486
I'm between girlfriend's right now.

1666
01:07:12,386 --> 01:07:14,066
Look boys, and they all
lived happily ever after.

1667
01:07:14,066 --> 01:07:15,456
- [Mason] Once upon a...
- [Victor] Oh.

1668
01:07:18,877 --> 01:07:19,947
I doubt that.

1669
01:07:22,017 --> 01:07:22,927
- Why not?

1670
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:34,736
- Oh, so what do you think?

1671
01:07:35,766 --> 01:07:37,246
- You know, I don't know.

1672
01:07:37,246 --> 01:07:39,926
I don't really know much about art, so.

1673
01:07:39,926 --> 01:07:41,146
- I don't either.

1674
01:07:41,146 --> 01:07:44,246
- But, it's cool how he
tends to use one color

1675
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:45,707
that kind of pops out.

1676
01:07:45,707 --> 01:07:47,047
- [Crystal] Jonathan.
- Hey Crystal.

1677
01:07:47,047 --> 01:07:50,347
- [Victor] Oh this fucking
guy, okay Jesus, what a tool.

1678
01:07:50,346 --> 01:07:52,166
He was fucking all over Crystal.

1679
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:53,447
- What are you up too?

1680
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:55,585
- Nothing really, just stopped
by because someone said

1681
01:07:55,585 --> 01:07:57,095
they had free booze here, so.

1682
01:07:58,125 --> 01:07:59,085
- Hey, Victor.

1683
01:07:59,086 --> 01:08:00,666
Crystal's boyfriend.
- [Crystal] I'm so sorry.

1684
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:01,906
Victor, this is Jonathan.

1685
01:08:01,906 --> 01:08:03,726
He and I we went to school together.

1686
01:08:03,726 --> 01:08:04,806
- Good to meet you Victor.

1687
01:08:04,806 --> 01:08:05,926
- Oh yeah.

1688
01:08:05,926 --> 01:08:07,866
- You know what, Victor's
friend Leroy he's here.

1689
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:09,906
He's an architect too,
you guys should talk.

1690
01:08:09,906 --> 01:08:10,766
- Definitely.

1691
01:08:10,766 --> 01:08:12,626
- Hey, do you wanna get a drink?

1692
01:08:12,626 --> 01:08:14,716
- Yeah, can you grab
me a glass of red wine?

1693
01:08:15,266 --> 01:08:16,006
Thank you.

1694
01:08:16,007 --> 01:08:17,577
- [Victor] I mean, you
see how she's trying

1695
01:08:17,577 --> 01:08:19,087
to blow me off here, huh?

1696
01:08:19,087 --> 01:08:21,007
Yeah, could it be more
obvious she totally wanted

1697
01:08:21,007 --> 01:08:22,557
to just bang this guy?

1698
01:08:23,446 --> 01:08:25,296
- You saw (mumbles) okay?

1699
01:08:29,035 --> 01:08:30,805
- I mean, what do you think of this one?

1700
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:34,235
- I don't know I'm not
able to think of anything

1701
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,025
other than getting you back in bed.

1702
01:08:37,935 --> 01:08:39,275
- [Leroy] Hey, what'd she say?

1703
01:08:39,275 --> 01:08:41,035
- [Mason] I don't know, it was in Korean.

1704
01:08:41,035 --> 01:08:42,565
- [Leroy] Oh, come on you gotta tell us.

1705
01:08:42,574 --> 01:08:46,594
- [Victor] No, no she said, "I
wanna fuck your friend Victor

1706
01:08:46,594 --> 01:08:51,164
"'cause unlike you he's a
real man who likes boobies."

1707
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:54,101
- [Mason] She said all
my friends are gossipy

1708
01:08:54,101 --> 01:08:55,841
sewing circle bitches, okay?

1709
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:57,591
Can we move the fuck on already?

1710
01:08:58,741 --> 01:09:00,981
- Why don't we just catch
up with our friends first,

1711
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:02,451
that might be an idea.

1712
01:09:03,742 --> 01:09:05,582
- Sorry, I thought the constant sex phase

1713
01:09:05,582 --> 01:09:08,592
of the relationship was supposed
to last more than two days.

1714
01:09:09,302 --> 01:09:11,002
- I just don't understand
what's wrong with it.

1715
01:09:11,003 --> 01:09:12,443
- Nothing.

1716
01:09:12,443 --> 01:09:13,953
- Then, why don't you like it?

1717
01:09:13,954 --> 01:09:16,874
- I think that you should
wear whatever you want

1718
01:09:16,874 --> 01:09:19,174
and not be so worried that I
absolutely adore your shirt.

1719
01:09:19,174 --> 01:09:20,904
- Well, it's your opening,
so I thought you'd want

1720
01:09:20,904 --> 01:09:22,304
your boyfriend to look nice for it.

1721
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,813
I'm just trying to make you happy.

1722
01:09:24,663 --> 01:09:26,763
- [Mason] Holy shit, did
you go from the butch

1723
01:09:26,764 --> 01:09:28,624
to the bitch in like two seconds flat.

1724
01:09:33,385 --> 01:09:35,295
- You know what, fuck it
if I'm bringing her wine.

1725
01:09:45,104 --> 01:09:47,554
- Hey, hey, hey I'm in heels here.

1726
01:09:47,545 --> 01:09:48,685
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1727
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:54,115
- You know what, you've been
acting like an ass all night.

1728
01:09:56,385 --> 01:09:57,725
Maybe you need some alone time.

1729
01:09:57,731 --> 01:09:58,821
- Oh, really?

1730
01:09:59,254 --> 01:10:00,344
And, where are you going?

1731
01:10:01,014 --> 01:10:02,834
- Jane and Rashida said
they were going to Luna,

1732
01:10:02,834 --> 01:10:04,114
I think I'm going to meet up with them.

1733
01:10:05,475 --> 01:10:06,565
- Yeah, sure you are.

1734
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,665
- You can call me tomorrow.

1735
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,045
- You wanna play like that.

1736
01:10:15,975 --> 01:10:18,405
Okay, okay.

1737
01:10:19,935 --> 01:10:20,865
- Do you wanna go to Luna?

1738
01:10:21,495 --> 01:10:22,625
- I don't think so.

1739
01:10:23,495 --> 01:10:25,535
- Why do you wanna go there so badly?

1740
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,765
I like this place.

1741
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:29,615
- Yeah, and tomorrow they'd
find me dead in a ditch.

1742
01:10:30,074 --> 01:10:31,584
- Are you retarded?

1743
01:10:32,314 --> 01:10:33,384
- How big is your cock?

1744
01:10:33,376 --> 01:10:34,736
- I don't know you.

1745
01:10:34,737 --> 01:10:36,357
- I don't wanna know you.

1746
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:37,617
- Do I look stupid?

1747
01:10:37,617 --> 01:10:38,717
- Go to hell.

1748
01:10:38,717 --> 01:10:39,677
- Suck my dick.

1749
01:10:39,677 --> 01:10:40,537
- What?

1750
01:10:40,537 --> 01:10:42,287
- Do you wanna go to Luna?

1751
01:10:43,418 --> 01:10:44,468
- What?

1752
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:46,609
- Drive dollar big price car?

1753
01:10:47,379 --> 01:10:48,089
- Huh?

1754
01:10:48,879 --> 01:10:51,689
- American drive dollar big price car.

1755
01:10:52,839 --> 01:10:57,329
- What, oh yes, yeah some American's do.

1756
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,099
I drive a Ford, no but you
know, that's just until

1757
01:11:02,098 --> 01:11:05,478
my Ferrari comes in, obviously.

1758
01:11:06,618 --> 01:11:07,348
- Ferrari?

1759
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:10,210
- Yeah, I actually just
inherited the biggest fruit

1760
01:11:10,211 --> 01:11:12,411
and produce distributer in the Mid-west.

1761
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:15,061
So, I figured, hey why not splurge.

1762
01:11:15,891 --> 01:11:16,831
- Inherit?

1763
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:17,651
- Yeah.

1764
01:11:17,651 --> 01:11:20,511
- Buy Zivanka drink hunky hunk.

1765
01:11:20,512 --> 01:11:21,562
- Huh?

1766
01:11:22,631 --> 01:11:26,851
Yes, yes how 'bout I get you a drink

1767
01:11:26,852 --> 01:11:28,262
over at Luna?

1768
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:30,872
That place is so much
better than here, let's go.

1769
01:11:30,874 --> 01:11:31,864
Yes?

1770
01:11:31,856 --> 01:11:34,546
- Must buy drink first, then marriage.

1771
01:11:35,575 --> 01:11:36,525
- What?

1772
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:42,285
Okay, yes drink okay, other bar.

1773
01:11:43,776 --> 01:11:46,606
Drink, at the other bar yes?

1774
01:11:47,195 --> 01:11:49,945
Yes? Yes? Yes?

1775
01:11:50,815 --> 01:11:51,505
Yes.

1776
01:12:08,415 --> 01:12:09,585
- What's the matter?

1777
01:12:11,175 --> 01:12:15,775
- Could you, do you think maybe

1778
01:12:17,135 --> 01:12:19,155
we could just, or you could take a shower.

1779
01:12:19,155 --> 01:12:22,625
- Oh, you wanna take a
shower, okay I'm game.

1780
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,615
- No, no, no I was
thinking like, you know,

1781
01:12:25,615 --> 01:12:26,745
you could take a shower.

1782
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:29,225
Like, to get clean.

1783
01:12:34,675 --> 01:12:36,265
- I took a shower before we left.

1784
01:12:38,215 --> 01:12:40,085
- Yeah, but...

1785
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,907
- I'm not clean now?

1786
01:12:51,498 --> 01:12:54,318
- Look Leroy, you're not the
only one in this relationship.

1787
01:12:54,318 --> 01:12:55,618
- Oh really, gee I didn't notice.

1788
01:12:55,618 --> 01:12:57,368
- You know what? Sometimes I wonder.

1789
01:12:57,849 --> 01:12:59,219
- You know, with all the shit you give me

1790
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:00,499
I wonder why I'm in this relationship.

1791
01:13:00,499 --> 01:13:03,619
- Whoa wait, all the shit I give you?

1792
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,870
- Yeah.

1793
01:13:04,868 --> 01:13:07,968
- On extremely rare
occasion I ask you really,

1794
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:10,740
really nicely to think
about me from time to time.

1795
01:13:10,735 --> 01:13:11,495
- Oh yeah?

1796
01:13:11,495 --> 01:13:13,895
- Yeah, you know what, I say,
"Hey, Leroy since you worked

1797
01:13:13,895 --> 01:13:16,135
"70 hours last week and
I didn't get to see you

1798
01:13:16,135 --> 01:13:17,615
"maybe we could go out for dinner

1799
01:13:17,615 --> 01:13:19,235
"instead of playing video
games all fucking night."

1800
01:13:19,235 --> 01:13:20,215
- Okay, wait a minute.

1801
01:13:20,215 --> 01:13:21,515
I have to work to advance in my--

1802
01:13:21,515 --> 01:13:22,375
- I never argued that.

1803
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:24,185
- Do you realize how little
- [Lily] I never asked you

1804
01:13:24,185 --> 01:13:25,565
to work less hours.
- [Leroy] money lower

1805
01:13:25,565 --> 01:13:27,405
architects make, and then at
the end of a long work day

1806
01:13:27,406 --> 01:13:28,356
I wanna come home and relax.

1807
01:13:28,357 --> 01:13:29,917
- Well, having a drink
with me at a restaurant

1808
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:30,637
should be relaxing.

1809
01:13:30,638 --> 01:13:32,378
- You know what, you don't
get it, you have no idea.

1810
01:13:32,377 --> 01:13:33,877
You've never worked to have to advance

1811
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:34,767
in anything in your life.

1812
01:13:34,767 --> 01:13:36,827
You just go around being all
good at everything you do.

1813
01:13:36,826 --> 01:13:39,006
And now, you make me feel
guilty because I have to work.

1814
01:13:39,006 --> 01:13:41,116
No, just you know what,
this isn't working.

1815
01:13:41,586 --> 01:13:43,386
This isn't working, this
relationship is not what I

1816
01:13:43,386 --> 01:13:44,156
wanted it to be.

1817
01:13:47,667 --> 01:13:49,517
It just feels so fucked
up about it all the time.

1818
01:14:00,187 --> 01:14:03,967
(sentimental music)

1819
01:14:03,967 --> 01:14:04,807
I'm sorry.

1820
01:14:04,806 --> 01:14:06,206
- I know, shh.

1821
01:14:06,206 --> 01:14:10,306
(sentimental music)

1822
01:14:15,462 --> 01:14:16,382
- [Bernard] So that's it?

1823
01:14:16,382 --> 01:14:17,862
- [Leroy] Yep, that's it.

1824
01:14:17,862 --> 01:14:18,922
- [Bernard] I don't get it.

1825
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:20,982
- [Leroy] I don't know man,
I just really like her.

1826
01:14:20,982 --> 01:14:23,412
And, I realized it was all worth it.

1827
01:14:23,422 --> 01:14:25,842
- [Bernard] Leroy, welcome to manhood.

1828
01:14:25,842 --> 01:14:27,122
- [Mason] Yeah, I got a question.

1829
01:14:27,122 --> 01:14:29,052
- [Bernard] You know actually,
I'm getting a little misty.

1830
01:14:29,053 --> 01:14:30,653
- [Mason] What's wrong
with playing video games

1831
01:14:30,653 --> 01:14:31,373
all fucking night?

1832
01:14:31,764 --> 01:14:35,364
(dance music)

1833
01:14:35,364 --> 01:14:37,794
- Buy Zivanka diamonds now?

1834
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,882
- Yeah, yeah, yeah why don't we just start

1835
01:14:42,882 --> 01:14:44,412
with some drinks first, okay.

1836
01:14:55,242 --> 01:14:57,412
- All right, I'll be back in
a sec. Can you watch this?

1837
01:14:59,302 --> 01:15:00,452
- You're a doll.

1838
01:15:00,977 --> 01:15:01,777
- Victor.

1839
01:15:01,778 --> 01:15:05,818
- Oh, hey Crystal wow, I
totally forgot you were

1840
01:15:05,818 --> 01:15:07,118
gonna be here tonight.

1841
01:15:07,118 --> 01:15:08,798
What a coincidence.

1842
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:11,121
- No bang, bang honeymoon till diamond.

1843
01:15:11,121 --> 01:15:11,981
- Yes.

1844
01:15:11,982 --> 01:15:13,312
- What the fuck are you doing?

1845
01:15:13,682 --> 01:15:15,962
- I'm grabbing a drink, same as you.

1846
01:15:15,963 --> 01:15:17,143
- Three carat.

1847
01:15:17,143 --> 01:15:18,143
- Three carats.

1848
01:15:18,144 --> 01:15:19,084
- Who is this girl?

1849
01:15:19,084 --> 01:15:19,844
- She's

1850
01:15:19,844 --> 01:15:21,744
- Mister hunky inherit dollar.

1851
01:15:21,744 --> 01:15:22,624
- Okay, okay.

1852
01:15:22,624 --> 01:15:26,314
Hey, why don't you go
get us some drinks, okay?

1853
01:15:26,311 --> 01:15:27,361
Thank you.

1854
01:15:28,651 --> 01:15:30,531
God, she's so cool, you know.

1855
01:15:30,531 --> 01:15:34,311
And, such a sweetheart,
I just love hanging out

1856
01:15:34,311 --> 01:15:35,191
with her, you know?

1857
01:15:35,191 --> 01:15:36,811
- [Zivanka] Not platinum card?

1858
01:15:36,811 --> 01:15:39,781
- Hey, it's a blue card
that's higher than platinum.

1859
01:15:41,222 --> 01:15:42,312
- What are you doing?

1860
01:15:43,202 --> 01:15:43,992
- What?

1861
01:15:45,502 --> 01:15:46,792
- What are you doing with her?

1862
01:15:48,504 --> 01:15:53,294
- Oh, oh come on we both know
we're seeing other people.

1863
01:15:54,504 --> 01:15:55,674
- Oh, we do?

1864
01:15:56,264 --> 01:15:59,824
- Well yeah, I mean, you
know, it was fun playing

1865
01:15:59,824 --> 01:16:01,464
the whole, "I love you" game,

1866
01:16:01,464 --> 01:16:04,554
but come on it gets old after a while.

1867
01:16:11,144 --> 01:16:12,454
- Why are you trying to be an asshole?

1868
01:16:13,184 --> 01:16:15,374
- I'm not, I'm just being me.

1869
01:16:17,924 --> 01:16:20,604
- Okay, by showing up to a
place you know I'm going to

1870
01:16:20,604 --> 01:16:22,534
be at with some bimbo
you just met tonight?

1871
01:16:22,527 --> 01:16:25,067
- Hey, hey I didn't just
meet her tonight, okay.

1872
01:16:25,067 --> 01:16:28,187
Honey, whenever I'm not with
you I'm drilling that girl

1873
01:16:28,187 --> 01:16:31,517
like a piece of, you
know, flat metal that I'm

1874
01:16:31,524 --> 01:16:32,654
drill a rivet--

1875
01:16:32,646 --> 01:16:33,986
- Stop, stop.

1876
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:34,916
- I do.

1877
01:16:39,566 --> 01:16:43,136
- This is all the respect you have for me?

1878
01:16:48,826 --> 01:16:49,816
- Yeah.

1879
01:16:55,106 --> 01:16:56,936
(thud and grunt)

1880
01:17:03,206 --> 01:17:04,946
- [Bernard] And, that
was the end of Crystal?

1881
01:17:04,946 --> 01:17:06,966
- [Victor] Yeah, that's what
I get for falling for a girl

1882
01:17:06,966 --> 01:17:09,006
like that, a punch in the nose.

1883
01:17:09,007 --> 01:17:11,707
- [Bernard] You didn't try
to apologize or anything?

1884
01:17:11,707 --> 01:17:12,667
- [Victor] Apologize?

1885
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:14,627
Okay, she was probably off
banging that guy from college.

1886
01:17:14,627 --> 01:17:16,397
Okay, why should I apologize to her?

1887
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:20,708
- [Leroy] Okay wait, wait
a minute she actually

1888
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:21,918
took a shower?

1889
01:17:23,489 --> 01:17:24,429
- [Mason] Yeah.

1890
01:17:24,429 --> 01:17:27,059
- [Victor] And, you didn't
get in there with her.

1891
01:17:27,549 --> 01:17:29,899
- Hey Angela, have you ever been tested?

1892
01:17:31,009 --> 01:17:32,079
- [Angela] Tested?

1893
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,720
- Yeah, you know what I mean.

1894
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:36,900
- [Angela] Never thought
I had a reason to.

1895
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:39,020
- What do you mean? Everybody needs to.

1896
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:44,230
- [Angela] I've only been with one guy,

1897
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:45,660
and he was a virgin too.

1898
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:47,920
- Yeah, he also could have been a liar.

1899
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,091
- I really don't think--

1900
01:17:50,091 --> 01:17:51,821
- He could have been with
like a hundred women.

1901
01:17:52,831 --> 01:17:55,211
You could have all sorts
of like funk and viruses

1902
01:17:55,211 --> 01:17:57,991
and mitochondria and--

1903
01:17:57,992 --> 01:17:59,272
- What are you talking about?

1904
01:17:59,273 --> 01:18:01,153
- [Leroy] Yeah, what
are you talking about?

1905
01:18:01,153 --> 01:18:03,953
- [Mason] I don't know.
I was just trying to...

1906
01:18:03,954 --> 01:18:05,864
I don't know.

1907
01:18:05,855 --> 01:18:07,575
- [Bernard] You know,
mitochondria don't carry

1908
01:18:07,575 --> 01:18:08,665
diseases, per se.

1909
01:18:09,255 --> 01:18:10,895
And anyway, they're not contagious.

1910
01:18:10,896 --> 01:18:12,116
- I knew the guy for like--

1911
01:18:12,116 --> 01:18:14,976
- Yeah, and then wait then
there were the other guys.

1912
01:18:14,976 --> 01:18:16,286
I mean, how many were there?

1913
01:18:21,696 --> 01:18:23,156
- I told you that he was the only--

1914
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:25,386
- Yeah, he's the only guy you
had sexual intercourse with.

1915
01:18:26,657 --> 01:18:29,127
That means you did other
stuff with other guys.

1916
01:18:30,017 --> 01:18:32,747
- Yeah, some fooling around, but not much.

1917
01:18:34,037 --> 01:18:37,857
- I'm sorry, I can't
have sex with you tonight

1918
01:18:37,857 --> 01:18:39,307
without a condom.

1919
01:18:40,678 --> 01:18:41,818
- You didn't think you needed a condom

1920
01:18:41,818 --> 01:18:43,288
the first time we slept together.

1921
01:18:48,198 --> 01:18:49,308
- Oh fuck.

1922
01:18:54,278 --> 01:18:55,338
- What?

1923
01:18:55,339 --> 01:18:57,109
- I have to go to a clinic right now.

1924
01:18:58,959 --> 01:18:59,999
- [Leroy] What?

1925
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:00,990
- What?

1926
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,890
What the hell is wrong with you?

1927
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,930
- [Bernard] No seriously, what
the hell is wrong with you?

1928
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:11,740
- It's just a bad idea,
I mean this whole thing

1929
01:19:11,741 --> 01:19:12,841
is just a bad idea.

1930
01:19:12,842 --> 01:19:15,022
- This whole thing, like sleeping with me

1931
01:19:15,022 --> 01:19:16,672
or even going out with
me in the first place?

1932
01:19:22,962 --> 01:19:26,622
You know what? This was a
bad idea, you should go.

1933
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:28,736
- Okay.

1934
01:19:35,066 --> 01:19:37,966
- [Leroy] Wow, I...man I
don't even know what to say.

1935
01:19:37,966 --> 01:19:41,766
I thought I had issues, but
man you have serious issues.

1936
01:19:41,766 --> 01:19:43,746
- [Mason] Yeah, I'm starting to think so.

1937
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:45,706
- [Leroy] Man, you need serious help.

1938
01:19:45,706 --> 01:19:48,006
I'm not just saying that,
like you really do need help.

1939
01:19:48,006 --> 01:19:50,546
- [Victor] Okay look, if
you're turning gay you can't

1940
01:19:50,546 --> 01:19:53,806
be in the bathroom shaving
when I'm in the shower anymore.

1941
01:19:53,806 --> 01:19:55,436
- [Bernard] So, did you
actually go to a clinic?

1942
01:19:56,247 --> 01:19:58,177
- Of course not.

1943
01:19:58,767 --> 01:20:00,117
- Did you get back together with Angela?

1944
01:20:00,887 --> 01:20:03,357
- Yeah, I called and
left a message, you know?

1945
01:20:03,907 --> 01:20:07,377
More than once, but she
never called me back, so.

1946
01:20:09,987 --> 01:20:11,157
- [Bernard] So, that's it.

1947
01:20:11,767 --> 01:20:14,007
Leroy figured it out and got the girl.

1948
01:20:14,007 --> 01:20:17,327
Victor didn't figure it
out and lost the girl.

1949
01:20:17,329 --> 01:20:20,369
Mason is finally starting
to clue in, so maybe

1950
01:20:20,369 --> 01:20:21,639
there's hope for him yet.

1951
01:20:22,049 --> 01:20:25,349
I know, I know there's no deep
lessons to be learned here,

1952
01:20:25,349 --> 01:20:28,549
just three guys, well four
guys, trying to figure out

1953
01:20:28,549 --> 01:20:29,689
their own shit.

1954
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:32,030
What else do you want, iambic pentameter

1955
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:34,660
and literary allusions
to the Canterbury tales?

1956
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:38,334
- [Voiceover] Bar's
closed, get the fuck out.

1957
01:20:39,904 --> 01:20:42,254
- Oh, oh.

1958
01:20:42,245 --> 01:20:43,975
- All right, fellas.

1959
01:20:44,725 --> 01:20:45,535
- Let's go, dudes.

1960
01:20:45,544 --> 01:20:47,454
- Wait, well I mean, hey.

1961
01:20:49,364 --> 01:20:50,814
The bars are still open on the east side.

1962
01:20:51,519 --> 01:20:53,379
- No man, I'm going over to Lily's.

1963
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:54,660
- Dude, I gotta give a final tomorrow.

1964
01:20:54,661 --> 01:20:56,321
- You'll come with me
Mason, right come on.

1965
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,920
- Yeah, guess what, I'm
not really in the mood.

1966
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,810
- No, I'm gonna go hit on the
bartender over at Emerald.

1967
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:00,940
- Oh, is she cute, is she cute?

1968
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,550
- Yeah, she's really
cute I'm gonna click her

1969
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:04,240
like a ball point pen, let's do this.

1970
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,800
- [Bernard] What the
hell does that even mean?

1971
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,550
- Don't, 'cause it always
means the same thing.

1972
01:21:09,401 --> 01:21:12,421
â™«Doctor please

1973
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:16,151
â™«Bring me anesthesia

1974
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:24,350
â™«Three more of these

1975
01:21:25,181 --> 01:21:29,051
â™«I won't have to eat

01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:50,610
â™«I'll say goodnight

1978
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,670
â™«Shut your mouth

1979
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:07,710
â™«Try to keep your composure

1980
01:22:13,241 --> 01:22:15,891
â™«Play along

1981
01:22:16,663 --> 01:22:20,413
â™«Just like no one knows

1982
01:22:24,463 --> 01:22:28,573
â™«Just say goodnight

1983
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:41,623
â™«Just say goodnight

1984
01:22:51,672 --> 01:22:54,772
â™«Got so much time these days

1985
01:22:54,772 --> 01:22:58,962
â™«Like I've got nothing else

1986
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:07,532
â™«With all my time these days

1987
01:23:07,532 --> 01:23:11,482

01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:24,262
â™«I can't seem to deny me

01:23:29,932 --> 01:23:32,862

(Board claps)
- Mark.

2001
01:25:24,945 --> 01:25:27,765
(gum snapping)

2002
01:25:27,765 --> 01:25:30,265
- So, hey, you know, do
you wanna go to maybe

2003
01:25:30,265 --> 01:25:31,715
the Pepper Lounge with me?

2004
01:25:32,525 --> 01:25:34,195
- Do you know Lydia's philosophy?

2005
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:34,965
- What's that?

2006
01:25:34,965 --> 01:25:36,625
- I don't go no where 'till I'm paid for.

2007
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:40,465
(laughs)

2008
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:41,780
- [Voiceover] Okay, cut.
