1
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,935
<i>Everyone,</i>
<i>have your money ready.</i>
<i>We only have so much time.</i>

2
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,481
Okay, say, "Cheers!"
Cheers.

3
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,141
Say, "Beer!"
Beer!

4
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,616
Say, "Cheers!"

5
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,082
Glen, you got to take
that shirt off, pal.

6
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,180
Why?

7
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,782
Hands, you wanna
field this one?

8
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,588
Uh, dude, you're getting
a fake ID

9
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,595
and you're wearing
a shirt that says
you're in high school.

10
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:04,823
So?

11
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,025
Okay, whatever.
I'll fix it later.

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,226
Just do
what you were doing.

13
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,132
Give me
some nice cat things.

14
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,737
- <i>B!</i>
- <i>Oh, hey, Schrader.</i>

15
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,534
What the hell
is going on here?

16
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,766
Relax, pal.

17
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,069
Five percent goes
to your favorite charity.

18
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,769
Uh, I forgot to tell you,
I borrowed your keys.

19
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,812
You borrowed my keys?
Come on.

20
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,107
Well, I needed them.
Ow.

21
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,808
We're providing
a vital service
to America's youth here.

22
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,180
Could we get
the next in line, please?
No, we're not. Stay there!

23
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,219
We're contributing to
the delinquency of minors, B.

24
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,255
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what will happen to me</i>
<i>if I get caught?</i>

25
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:30,983
<i>Every day</i>
<i>after eighth period,</i>

26
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,615
Vice Principal Matthews
comes in here.

27
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,421
<i>He picks up</i>
<i>the women's fitness magazine</i>

28
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,485
<i>and he snaps one off!</i>

29
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,962
Are you serious?
Yes.

30
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,020
That is a problem.

31
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,124
Uh, okay, well,
we still have the rest
of eighth period, right?

32
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,793
So, we'll just
pack everybody up
and get out of here.

33
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,858
Okay, let's go!

34
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,531
Shit!

35
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,271
Gaines! Gaines! Gaines!

36
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,075
Okay, good, good.

37
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,548
Ah, wonderful!
Vice Principal Matthews!

38
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,709
So glad you could join us!

39
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,412
What the hell is this?

40
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:01,884
It's Glee Club
practice, sir.

41
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,822
We're just gettin' ready
for Memorial Day.
It's a big one for us.

42
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,586
We don't have
a Glee Club.

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,018
Not yet,
we don't, sir.

44
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,187
But as the graduating class,
we wanted to leave behind

45
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,254
a legacy that inspires
future students

46
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,926
to take initiative
rather than spend their time,

47
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,902
I don't know,
privately defacing
women's fitness magazines.

48
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,799
I mean, I went
to read an article

49
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,932
about no carbs
and higher reps
the other day

50
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,339
and the pages were...
You are a rotten egg.

51
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,707
...as if by
some natural adhesive.
That'll be enough.

52
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,370
I need to cut
the pounds

53
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,846
and I can't open the...
Stop it!

54
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,815
Whatever does it for...
Stop it!

55
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,476
That's all
I'm gonna say.

56
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,383
Thank God
you're graduating.

57
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm the fourth-generation
Schrader...
Sorry.

58
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,622
to go to
Harmon College, okay?
Yeah.

59
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,353
I can't do anything
to screw that up.

60
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,021
You know, like, I don't know,
getting busted
for identity fraud.

61
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,429
Look at you.
Would you stop, man? Relax.

62
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,898
We're all goin'
to college, okay?

63
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,935
This is said by the guy
who's been rejected...
Hey, B.

64
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,027
...by seven schools.

65
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,696
Hey, I'm creating
dramatic tension.

66
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,569
I got a good feeling
about number eight!
Ugh.

67
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:59,302
I got in! I got in!
I got into Princeton!

68
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,370
Yeah! Yeah!

69
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,546
Hey, I think that guy
got into Princeton.

70
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,845
Oh, what makes you say that?

71
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,943
I don't know.

72
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,180
Bartleby! Hey.

73
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,085
Hey, how are you,
Monica?
Hey, how are you?

74
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,056
Good. Do you know Schrader?

75
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,559
No, I don't think so. Oh!
Yes! We...

76
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,023
I actually...
We had a class.

77
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,120
Oh, yeah.

78
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,393
My shit was all crazy.
I sat way behind you.

79
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,696
Yeah. Sorry.
I don't remember
you, either.

80
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:23,895
Sorry.
It's all right.

81
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,336
Um, anyway, I really wanted
to ask you something.

82
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,464
Sure, anything.

83
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,598
Um, you know,
I know it's really late,

84
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,972
but, um, last minute
and everything,

85
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,772
but prom is coming up soon,
you know?
It's okay. Yes.

86
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,677
And I'm actually having
a party at my house
beforehand.

87
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,442
Awesome!
And I was wondering

88
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,349
if you'd like to, um...
If you could, um...

89
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,387
I'd love to.
...mow our lawn.

90
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,614
Mow your lawn?
Yeah.

91
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,682
Oh.
I'm sorry.

92
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,860
Yeah. I'm really embarrassed,
but, you know,

93
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,056
our mower's broken
and my mom was just, like,
"Ask Bartleby!"

94
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,155
That's cool!

95
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,360
I... Yeah. Tell your mother
I would love to mow the lawn.
Really?

96
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,561
Of course.

97
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,625
Thank you so much.
Yeah, sure.

98
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,695
Thank you.
Hey, babe! Hey, yo,
Monica! Come on!

99
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,239
Sorry, I got to go.

100
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,865
But thank you, again.
Yeah, s-sure.

101
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,773
You're really helping us out.
Oh, great to see you.

102
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,436
And, hey, it was nice to meet,
um, see you. Talk to you.

103
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,173
Yes, yes. It was... It was
so nice catching up with you.

104
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,045
Yeah. Okay. Bye-bye.
B-Bye, Monica.

105
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,583
Hey, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting, baby.

106
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,812
Hoyt Ambrose. Hoyt!

107
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,753
Hoyt Ambrose.
What's that guy got
that I don't have?

108
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,518
I just need to get a car.

109
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,223
And classic good looks.

110
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,802
"I regret..."

111
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,488
I can't believe
I didn't get into State!

112
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,922
I wasn't even aiming high
with that one.

113
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,050
That was my fallback!

114
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,152
It was my safety school,
my fail-safe!

115
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,027
Maybe you're just
too average.

116
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,258
Hey, time out.

117
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,493
Too average?

118
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,393
Okay. Okay.
Excuse me, Lizzie.

119
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,028
R-R-Remember who
you're talkin' to here.

120
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,402
I didn't have to go
to gym class
for a whole year

121
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,906
'cause I claimed
to be allergic to sweat.

122
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,569
Or what about the time
I got the note from my doctor
saying I was nocturnal

123
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,236
and I was allowed
to study in my dreams?

124
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,907
I got the school bully,
Frank Daley,
kicked out for two years

125
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,813
because he was
sexually harassing me

126
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,318
by pushing me up
against the locker
and I said I felt something.

127
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,217
I mean, come on.
That was pure genius.

128
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,587
Maybe if you didn't write
an essay called
"I Don't Have a Clue."

129
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,852
Well, it's true. You know?

130
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,894
I don't have a clue
what I want to do
with the rest of my life.

131
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,622
Mom and Dad
are gonna kill you.

132
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,130
O ye of little faith.

133
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,425
They're not gonna kill me.
Uh-huh.

134
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,692
I just have to spin it

135
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,759
and put it in terms
they can understand.

136
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,168
I don't understand.

137
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,035
I don't understand, either.

138
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,899
Okay, I figure it
like this.

139
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,603
The average cost of college
is, what, $20,000 a year?

140
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,578
Now, according
to these estimates
that I got off the Web...

141
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,012
You can pass those around.

142
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,572
Someone with no education
beyond high school

143
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,642
can expect to make
about $20,000 a year
in the current job market.

144
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,779
Now, that being said,
over the next four years,

145
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,881
you could either
spend $80,000

146
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,426
or I could make $80,000.

147
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,823
Are you saying
you don't want to
go to college?

148
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,263
No. I'm saying that
it is fiscally irresponsible

149
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,426
for me to go
to college. You know?

150
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,728
Are you huffing?
Oh, God. No.

151
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,704
Are you high?
You're huffing grass?

152
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,264
No. I'm not huffing, Mom.
I'm not stoned.
I'm completely fine.

153
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,936
In fact, I'm more clear
and level-headed
than I've ever been.

154
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,104
Okay, cut the crap,
Bartleby.

155
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,579
Society has rules.

156
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,646
And the first rule is
you go to college.
Mmm-hmm.

157
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,346
You want to have a happy
and successful life?
You go to college.

158
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,412
If you want to be somebody,
you go to college.

159
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,651
If you want to fit in,
you go to college.

160
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,250
Well, you know what?
Maybe I didn't
get into college.

161
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,294
What do you mean?

162
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,107
I didn't get accepted
anywhere.

163
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,201
Oh, Bartleby.

164
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,266
Damn it.

165
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,872
I knew he should've started
preparing for college
in junior high

166
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,245
like his sister.

167
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,443
Now, she's got a shot.
I've got a shot.

168
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,781
She's got a shot.
Listen, guys.

169
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,014
There are plenty
of successful people
who didn't go to college.

170
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,886
Albert Einstein,
you know.

171
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,016
Pocahontas never
went to college.

172
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,890
Corey Feldman
and Corey Haim.

173
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,087
They had a great run.

174
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,721
Both Lewis and Clark.

175
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,660
Suzanne Somers. Bono.

176
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,960
I need to go
check on the cobbler.

177
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,905
"Check the cobbler."
Glug, glug, glug.

178
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,641
You know, I really don't
care what Sonny Bono
did or didn't do.

179
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,577
You're goin' to college.

180
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,450
I told you so.

181
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,815
You were adopted.

182
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,949
Everyone,

183
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,049
I would like
to propose a toast
to our graduates.

184
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,787
To the Class of 2006,

185
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,056
may the next four years
of college

186
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,030
be the best years
of your life.

187
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,497
Hear, hear.
Mom.

188
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,835
Hey.
Hey, man, what's up?

189
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,201
What's up, B?
How you doin'?
What's up?

190
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,169
Dude, I swear,
if one more person tells me

191
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,505
how excited they are
to go to college,
I'm gonna lose it.

192
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,976
Oh, man,
I heard about
the scholarship.

193
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,536
That's insane.
You're one of the best
receivers in the state.

194
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,242
Uh, the best. And, uh,
no knee, no football, man.

195
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,285
That sucks.
What are you gonna do now?

196
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,543
I have no idea.

197
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,545
That makes two of us, pal.

198
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,648
It's fine, it's fine,
it's fine, it's fine,
it's fine.

199
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,660
Hey, Rory. What's goin' on?
Oh, hey. What? Fine. Nothing.

200
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,992
Um, I... I didn't get into Yale.

201
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,927
I did... I didn't,
I didn't get into Yale.

202
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,626
I didn't...
I didn't get into Yale.

203
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,498
What? I can't
believe that!

204
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,901
Well, there's no room
for Rory at Yale.

205
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,769
Too many rich kids
with mediocre grades

206
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,001
and well-connected parents
this year, I guess.

207
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,634
No room for Rory,
who's been working

208
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,303
since first grade
to get into Yale.

209
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,540
Rory, who only applied
to Yale and nowhere else.

210
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,809
I had it all planned!

211
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,283
It was perfect, B!
Perfect!

212
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,979
And now
it's nothing! <i>Nada!</i>

213
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,720
It's a goose egg!

214
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,851
Okay. Well.

215
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,120
God, Rory! Rory!

216
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,521
She's handling that
really well.

217
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,462
College
is for pussies!

218
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,464
All right.
I got to get out
of here, pal.

219
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,968
Hang in there.
All right, man. You, too.

220
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,732
Bartleby! Hey!
Oh, hey, Mr. Schrader.
I was actually just...

221
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,829
Did you have any cake?

222
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,397
No, you know,
I'm not much
of a cake guy.

223
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,533
Oh, it is a hell
of a cake.

224
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,578
It is the same cake we got
for Scotty and Seth
when they got into Harmon.

225
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,170
Oh, ah, everything
comes full circle.

226
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,272
Jay! How are ya, bud?
Oh, I really don't...

227
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,646
Hey, Stu.
Hey.

228
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,480
I can't imagine your pride,
knowing your youngest

229
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,953
is headed off
to a good college.
Must take a load off.

230
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,250
Yeah, well, not to mention

231
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,587
the load it takes off
my bank account.

232
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:22,783
Dad.

233
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,625
Nothin' like gettin'
a load off!

234
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,399
What about you,
Bartleby?

235
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,903
That's a good question,
Mr. Harkin.

236
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,201
What's with the questions,
Mr. Trebek?

237
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,568
Where you goin'?

238
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,442
Um, I... I., well...

239
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,038
I didn't really, uh...

240
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,675
Bartleby screwed
around and now
he's not goin' to college.

241
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,412
He's thrown his life away.

242
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,161
Yeah, that's... that's what
I was gonna say.
Thanks, Dad.

243
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,412
Wait. South Harmon
Institute of Technology?

244
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,507
Yeah.
B, you realize
that makes it S.H.I.T., right?

245
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,251
S.H.I.T.?
I was wingin' it. Whatever.

246
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,014
Just finish building
the website, please.

247
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,785
This is the act
of a desperate,
wildly unrealistic person.

248
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,589
Yo, B, you have to hook me up
with one of these
acceptance letters, bro.

249
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,721
Are you kidding me? No way.
Why not?

250
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,527
Oh, come on. The only way
this is gonna work
is if we keep it quiet.

251
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,090
And even then,
it's still a long shot.

252
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,295
Dude, I don't care.
I have to do somethin'.

253
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,428
The minute
I lost my scholarship,

254
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,133
my pop
started talkin' about me
getting my own bus route.

255
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,640
Help me. Please?
Mmm.

256
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,667
You know something?

257
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,373
For the safety
of the public,
I can't let you drive a bus.

258
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,642
Sweet.
But listen to me.

259
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,513
This is just a temporary
stopgap measure, okay?

260
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,108
Nothing more.
Gotcha.

261
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,654
Bravo, guys. Great.
Both of you guys.

262
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,782
Let's start this fake college.
And then we'll go
start a meth lab somewhere.

263
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,792
Come on.
It's a gateway crime.
What?

264
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,884
That's how these things start.

265
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,292
You know something, Schrader,

266
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,830
you got into
a great college.

267
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,263
And your future's
lookin' really good,

268
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,062
and I'm psyched for you, pal,
'cause you're my best friend
and I love you.

269
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,764
I'm talking about
me coming to you,
asking for your help.

270
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,703
Just finish
the damn website.

271
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,364
Please.

272
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,339
What do you say?

273
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,108
There he is!
Fine.

274
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,911
Get off me,
you idiot.

275
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,247
But we need some sort of,
like, mission statement
or something.

276
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,913
Your dad's
gonna want to see that.
I know him, he's a hard-ass.

277
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,984
Hey, kids. Honey!

278
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,957
Hey. Hi.
How are you?
Hey.

279
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,084
What's this?

280
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,595
South Harmon
Institute of Technology?
What's that?

281
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,291
Mmm? What's that?

282
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,232
One of the most
respected schools in the area,
that's what that is.

283
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,394
Well, what's it say?

284
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,869
I gotta open it first.

285
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,303
Come on, hurry.

286
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,400
Oh. I'm nervous.

287
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,437
"Dear Bartleby,

288
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,315
"congratulations,
you've been accepted!"

289
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,612
I got in!

290
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,154
Aw, thank God. Thank God.
I got in!

291
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,586
Hey-o!
Oh! God!

292
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:38,816
Honey.
I'm okay.

293
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,223
Hey, this is great!

294
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,317
It's so exciting!

295
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,158
What the hell is South Harmon
Institute of Technology?
Yeah.

296
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,630
Oh, it's one of
Harmon College's
sister schools.

297
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,599
I've never heard of it.

298
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,796
Well, because
it's the baby sister.

299
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,737
It's the most
discreet and unharmed
of the sister schools.

300
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,364
You got any literature
on this place?

301
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,807
Yeah, there's a website,
I'll show you the link.

302
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,502
You did it.
You're a college boy.

303
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,874
Wow.

304
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,346
So you guys want to eat?
Yeah.

305
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,289
Hey! I hate my life.

306
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,088
I'm a huge tool.

307
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,355
Have fun being hot.

308
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,417
Bartleby!

309
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,060
Hey, Dad, what's up?

310
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:21,994
I took a look
at that website.

311
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,261
Oh.

312
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,527
Cool.

313
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:25,661
It looks unreal.

314
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,171
Unreal?

315
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,673
Yeah, it looks
pretty unbelievable, huh?

316
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,741
It seems
like a solid place.

317
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,800
Really?

318
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,175
Here you go.

319
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,616
First semester's tuition.
Paid in full.

320
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,283
That's great.

321
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,254
Wow, thank you, Dad.

322
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,122
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

323
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,158
Thanks, Dad.

324
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,126
Your mother and I
can't wait to drop you off.

325
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,104
What we need to do
is lease a place near Harmon

326
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,604
so we can fool our parents.
Yeah.

327
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,836
Hey, Schrad, do you know
any places up near Harmon
we can rent?

328
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,103
Oh, yeah, I do,
actually.

329
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,804
I carry around a list
with me at all times

330
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,710
of abandoned buildings
for fake colleges.

331
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,677
Dude, I started you guys
a bank account already.

332
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,909
What do you want me to be,
your realtor?

333
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,713
Oh, hey, guys.
What's up?

334
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:14,810
Hey, what's up, Glen?

335
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:15,876
Hey.
Hey, Glen,

336
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,889
when did you start working
at the Kwik 'N Stop?

337
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:22,326
Since I got boned, hard,
by every college I applied to.

338
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,554
Why, what happened?

339
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,289
Some political crap.

340
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,624
I got a zero on my SATs.

341
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,760
You know
you get 600 points

342
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,359
just for signing
your name, right?

343
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,765
All right,
let's get serious, man.

344
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,277
Now, where we gonna find
a place to pass off
as a college?

345
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,406
Hey, guys! I know a place.

346
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,078
How'd you know
about this place?

347
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,710
I used to do
volunteer work here.

348
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:49,845
This
place is awesome.

349
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,719
'Cause now I can
finally get hepatitis.

350
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,088
A bird
in the hand, dude.
A bird in the hand.

351
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,649
That doesn't
make any sense.

352
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,127
It's a saying.
What?

353
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,823
A diamond in the rough.

354
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,492
Hope you guys
have hobo-stab insurance.

355
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,896
Great.
The birthplace of crack.

356
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,671
Hello, beautiful.

357
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,610
Hey! Hey, guys,
don't go in there.

358
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:17,706
This is breaking
and entering.

359
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,978
Schrader, come on.
Don't be scared.

360
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,188
Who's scared?
I'm not scared.
You're scared.

361
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,951
Schrader, you were scared
to try the new flavor
of Dr. Pepper.

362
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,391
I told you that
in confidence, Hands.

363
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,354
Schrader, you were afraid
when your tooth fell out,

364
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,953
because you were terrified
of the tooth fairy.

365
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,396
That's actually
a legitimate fear.

366
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,023
She was rifling
through my shit.

367
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,931
Okay,
Fine, whatever, dude,
stay here.

368
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,526
Fine. I will.

369
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:40,967
Okay, guys, seriously,

370
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,406
I don't want to be here alone
when the walls start to bleed.

371
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,999
We don't have
to renovate the whole place.

372
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,408
We just have to focus
on essential areas.

373
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,503
We got the... the main lobby.
Hallway.

374
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,514
Dorm rooms.
Dorm rooms, exactly.

375
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,743
I think
this could really work. Huh?
It's awesome!

376
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,251
Can you hold that?
Yeah.

377
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,083
Guys, a little
can-do attitude,
some elbow grease,

378
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,452
maybe a smile from Schrader.

379
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,548
It's like cleaning up
your room, you know?

380
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,492
Welcome to the South Harmon
Institute of Technology.

381
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,324
Atta baby.
The beginning of good things.

382
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,420
Yeah.

383
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,838
Schrader,
what the hell was that?

384
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,469
Um, this is embarrassing.

385
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,534
Are you kidding?

386
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:21,636
It would be really cool

387
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,182
if you guys
wouldn't tell people
I scream like that.

388
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,928
Ready, set, go.

389
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,370
Whoo!
All right.

390
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,598
Uh, whoa, Glen.

391
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,134
Oh, hey, B.

392
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,404
What are you doing here,
buddy?

393
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,173
Rory told me about it.

394
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,680
What are you doing?
We were gonna keep
this place a big secret.

395
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,307
But he didn't have
any place to go.

396
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,749
He got fired
from the Kwik 'N Stop.

397
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,048
Is that true?
Why'd you...
Why'd you get fired?

398
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,146
I got fired
for making a shrimp slushee.

399
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,282
That's disgusting.
See?

400
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,586
Why would you
do that, pal?

401
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,854
'Cause I was hungry
and thirsty.

402
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:10,917
Oh, God.

403
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,982
This kitchen is bitchin'!

404
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,220
And this'll be the bath...

405
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,495
Close the door.
Shit!

406
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,929
Close it!

407
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,892
It takes 10,000 steps
to get from here to greatness.

408
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,456
And this right here,

409
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,464
this is step one.

410
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,830
Good luck, Son.

411
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,602
<i>Mister Ambrose,</i>
<i>do you know what makes Harmon</i>
<i>a great college?</i>

412
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:33,702
<i>Rejection.</i>

413
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,848
The exclusivity
of any university

414
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,008
is judged primarily
by the amount of students

415
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,381
it rejects.

416
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,680
Unfortunately,
for the last few years,

417
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,813
we have been
unable to match
the amount of students

418
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,688
that Yale, Princeton,
or even Stanford rejects,

419
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,727
primarily because
of our physical limitations.

420
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,059
But all that
is about to change.

421
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,557
Yale has one,
Princeton has one.

422
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,100
And now Harmon College
will have

423
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,329
the prestigious entranceway
it deserves.

424
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,961
A verdant buffer zone

425
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,472
to keep knowledge in,
and ignorance out.

426
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,236
That is a great idea, sir.
Yes, it is.

427
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,971
Now, you, Mr. Ambrose,
are chairman

428
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,774
of the Student Community
Outreach Committee.

429
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:13,580
I need you to secure
all these decrepit properties

430
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,279
in the neighboring community.

431
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,754
So that we can demolish them
to make room

432
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,882
for the Van Horne Gateway.

433
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,188
You know what?

434
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,786
This actually looks
like the real deal.

435
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,058
Guys, I don't want to be
too overly optimistic,

436
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,622
but I think
this could work.

437
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,459
It really looks
professional. Hello.

438
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,027
Hey, kid,
where the hell are you?

439
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,231
Oh, I'm, uh...
<i>Listen.</i>

440
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,705
<i>I took another look</i>
<i>at that website.</i>

441
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,537
What's all this "be
what you want to be" crap?

442
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,770
No, no, Dad, they just...
they just have to say
stuff like that

443
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,937
just to keep
from being sued.

444
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,072
Yeah, well, sounds like
a bunch of crap to me.

445
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,241
Glen, go long.
Set up a meeting
with the dean.

446
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,249
The dean? Jesus.
Mother of hell!

447
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,185
Your college does
have a dean, doesn't it?

448
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,587
I'm good!
Yes, of course
the college has a dean.

449
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,920
Dad, you know,
he's a busy guy,
though, you know,

450
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,721
he can't just, uh,
set up a meeting with parents.

451
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,887
<i>Listen. If I'm paying</i>
<i>for it, I'm meeting</i>
<i>with the dean.</i>

452
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:01,156
I want to make sure you have
the same education I did.
A real education.

453
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:05,101
<i>Dinner's at 8:00.</i>
Wait, Dad, Dad, Dad,
I can't... I can't... Aw, shit.

454
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,229
I gotta trim
this corner right here.
I think I got poisoned.

455
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,399
What's up, B?
We got a little problem.

456
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,339
What?
Who was that, Bartleby?

457
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,035
We gotta find a dean.

458
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:18,446
In life, it's important
to distinguish between
need and want.

459
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:22,383
You think you want something
because you've been
conditioned to want it.

460
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,319
I want the Pump!

461
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,186
I don't got the Pump.

462
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:30,592
Look, oh, I got the
Tim Duncan Adidas Cool-D's.

463
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,198
I want the Pump!

464
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,389
Listen,
you insolent little snot,

465
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,198
there are kids right now
in Asia who are sewing
your stupid shoes together,

466
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,899
so that their family can have
a bowl of rice to eat tonight!

467
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,067
This is the worst idea
of all time.

468
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,973
Your Uncle Ben
used to be a genius.

469
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,272
He'll be fine.
Mom!

470
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,335
What did you do?

471
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,971
You're the one who
emotionally crippled the kid.

472
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,278
You know what?
Maybe he's retarded.

473
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,278
I'm glad my mother's dead.

474
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,581
He's just having a bad day.

475
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,019
Oh, my gosh.

476
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,321
You want me to be the dean
of your college?

477
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,154
No, I want you
to pretend to be the dean.

478
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,250
It's just for one day.

479
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,921
Uh, perhaps young Sherman
didn't share this with you.

480
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,864
I've retired, I'm no longer
a shaper of young minds.

481
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,025
Oh, really?

482
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,363
Yeah, well, technically,
he was fired.

483
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,598
That's not true. I got fed up
with the education racket.

484
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,764
So I quit.

485
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,432
I did send in my resignation

486
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,408
in a rather
unorthodox fashion.

487
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,469
You sent
the dean of the university
a bag of dog shit.

488
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,442
It was a metaphor.
For what?

489
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,039
For "You're full of shit!"
Oh.

490
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,846
That's not a metaphor.
That's a metaphor.

491
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,408
Oh, semantics, schmantics.

492
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,421
Three years from now,
I'm finished with this crap.

493
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,514
I'm goin' to
Papua New Guinea.
I'm outta here.

494
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,218
Wh-Where...
Where you going?

495
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,692
I'm going off the grid.

496
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,389
No more, uh, franchises,
no more Botox,

497
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,523
no more "Eh, oh,
let's clone another goat."

498
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,761
And certainly no more
sexual harassment suits.

499
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,770
What's wrong with saying,
"Hey! Nice tits."

500
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,237
When did that
go out the window?

501
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,002
Okay, Ben,
all I'm asking you

502
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,373
is just shake a couple hands
with some parents,

503
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,571
say, "Hi, I'm the dean,"
whatever.

504
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,806
What if we pay you?

505
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,543
Don't sully my dignity
with your cash.

506
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,142
There you are!
Did you make
another child cry?

507
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,089
It's not my fault
the kid's a crybaby!
Little dipshit.

508
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,057
You're an asshole!
You're an asshole.

509
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,218
You are an asshole.
And you're fired.

510
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,720
Perhaps it is time to move on.

511
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,323
But I get to bring my house.

512
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,526
Deal.

513
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,330
Right or left?
Right.

514
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,132
Whose right?
Your call.

515
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,503
You're an idiot!
You're upset.

516
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:23,836
Go with what you feel.

517
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,467
You got about 12 feet.

518
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,039
Perfect.

519
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,511
Asshole.

520
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,113
Okay, smiles, everyone.

521
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,709
First day at college.

522
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,447
What's up with these colors?
Shit brown? Really?

523
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,352
Glen picked 'em.
Of course he did.

524
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,720
Where'd you find
all these people?

525
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,692
Uh, I volunteer at an
English-as-a-second-language
program.

526
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,025
These are my students.
I told them
if they wanted to pass,

527
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,155
they'd have to
successfully assimilate

528
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,664
into the American
college environment.

529
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,928
Whoa! The parents are here!

530
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,469
Okay!
We're on, guys!

531
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,471
Okay, people,
it's showtime!

532
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,464
Wow.

533
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,475
No frills
around here.
Oh, none at all.

534
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:03,742
None of that, uh, that ivy,
or gargoyles, or mahogany,
it's the real deal.

535
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,745
The real deal, huh?

536
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:06,909
This is it, kid.
This is it.

537
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,816
The big moment. Take this in.
Ah.

538
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,354
It's exciting, it's scary.

539
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,721
It's really scary.
Oh, look! Oh, it looks great.

540
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,115
Okay.

541
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,785
What's going on here?

542
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,352
Okay, we lost
one of the campers.

543
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,658
Curious campers.

544
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,562
What are you doing?
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

545
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,363
Honey.

546
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,734
Take it easy.
Okay, here we are. Let's...

547
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:28,997
What the devil is that?
Oh.

548
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,770
That's just a surge
of collegiate energy.

549
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,105
It's college for you.

550
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,009
Take a left up here
for the dorm room, Dad.

551
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,638
Oh, uh, can you
hang on a second?

552
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,240
I just really gotta go
to the bathroom a minute,
you know.

553
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,841
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I just wanna...

554
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,409
No, no, no, no, no!

555
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,120
Uh, it's, that's,
it's the men's room.

556
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,589
You can't go in there.

557
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:47,989
Well, can't you just
stand outside...

558
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,856
Diane, can't you wait
till we get to the restaurant?

559
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,260
Hey,
I'll see you, Rasheed.
I'll see you in math class.

560
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,627
You owe me 30 bucks,
by the way.

561
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:54,926
You jokester.

562
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,968
Here we are.
You remember Hands.
Hey, Mrs. Gaines.

563
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,502
Hey, hi.
The fam.

564
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,060
You look great.
Well, thank you.

565
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,765
When I first saw it,
I was like,
I gotta live here?

566
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,102
I can't believe this.
But it's a dorm room.

567
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,108
Mr. Gaines.
Daryl, how are you, partner?

568
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,337
Oh, thunder grip.

569
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,811
Why are there bars
on the window?

570
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:13,412
Oh, that's so nobody
accidentally gets thrown out.

571
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,248
It's fine.
It's a good
learning environment.

572
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,311
Not a lot of extras.
You'll study harder.

573
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,290
Yes. We will,
because of the blue
and the sparse walls.

574
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,347
I agree with you, sir.

575
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,415
What are these?

576
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,894
That's in case
of an earthquake.

577
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,897
Uh, never mind that.
Hey, let's go meet the dean.

578
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,193
Huh?
The dean.

579
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,196
Come here, honey.
Come on.

580
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,267
Which way?
Take a right there, Mom.

581
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,466
It's gonna be fun.

582
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,133
You know,
a lot of people say

583
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,236
that college is the time
when young men and women

584
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,438
expand the way
that they look at their world,

585
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:48,043
when they open their minds
to new ideas and experiences

586
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,610
and when they begin
that long journey

587
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,714
from the innocence of youth

588
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,019
to the responsibilities
of adulthood.

589
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,785
Now isn't that
a load of horseshit?

590
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,029
W-What?

591
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,232
Could you explain that
to us a little more?

592
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,468
Uh, Dean Lewis,
why don't you tell them

593
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,841
a little bit about
the philosophy here
at South Harmon?

594
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:17,643
Look, we throw
a lot of fancy words
in front of these kids,

595
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,980
in order to attract them
to going to school,

596
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,212
in the belief that they're
gonna have a better life.

597
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,517
And we all know
that all we're doing

598
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,489
is breeding
a whole new generation

599
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:27,923
of buyers and sellers.

600
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,392
Buyers and sellers!

601
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,793
Pimps and whores.
Pimps and whores!

602
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:36,932
And indoctrinating them
into a life-long hell
of debt and indecision.

603
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,502
I...
Um...

604
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,573
I... I just don't understand.

605
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,075
Do I have
to spoon-feed it to you?

606
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,804
Look, there's only one reason

607
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,370
that kids
want to go to school.

608
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,540
Holy shit.

609
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:00,914
Which is?

610
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,162
To get a good job.

611
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:13,369
To get a good job,
with a great starting salary.

612
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,712
I couldn't agree more.

613
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:28,352
It is so refreshing
to have somebody

614
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,684
approach education
so rationally.

615
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,213
Fuckin' A!

616
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,683
Well, Dad. Ow.

617
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:40,920
Oh, Mom.

618
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,167
You make us proud, kiddo.

619
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,496
I'll try, Dad.

620
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,098
Don't worry about
anything, okay?

621
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,935
Bye, honey.
Seat belts.

622
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,371
Spread your wings.

623
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,706
I'm gonna fly.
You gotta let me fly.

624
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,301
Bye, Lizzie.
Bye!

625
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,236
Bye!

626
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,579
So what do we do now?

627
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,856
Well, my friend,
we're in college now.

628
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,152
We can do whatever we want.

629
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,623
Gotta hand it to you, B.

630
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,855
Kids everywhere are busting
their ass in the classroom,

631
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,227
and we're killing
aliens, dude.

632
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,528
This is way better
than learning.
We are learning here, pal.

633
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,036
We're learning
the dire cost to civilization
when diplomacy fails.

634
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,799
We're learning
political science
right now.

635
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,504
What the...
What the hell is that?

636
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,572
Who is it?

637
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,782
Abernathy
Darwin Dunlap, sir.

638
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:34,912
Hi, there!

639
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:35,975
What's your name?

640
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,783
My name's
Abernathy Darwin Dunlap.

641
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,289
But you could call me A.D.D.,

642
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,621
on account of the fact
that I have A.D.D.,

643
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,285
which is
Attention Deficit Disorder
and you know,

644
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,159
everyone used to think it was
just an addiction to sugar
when I was six,

645
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,825
and my mom used to cry
because she thought
I would never be,

646
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,424
like, a fully functioning
member of society,

647
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,902
like my neighbor
who has Legionnaire's Disease.

648
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:54,894
Oh...

649
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,102
This is no longer
a mental health facility.

650
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,734
I'm so sorry
we can't help you.

651
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,371
Good luck to you, pal.
I don't need a hospital!

652
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,813
Okay, okay, wh-wh-what
are you doing here, then?

653
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,316
Well, unless
I misread the website,

654
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,318
I'm here for orientation!

655
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,381
Oh, you scared me
for a second.
In more ways than one.

656
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,323
Uh, you're looking
for Harmon College,

657
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:16,451
it's just right on
up the hill.

658
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,086
But good luck, have fun.
Go, Harmon.

659
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:21,326
No! I'm looking
for South Harmon
Institute of Technology

660
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,629
because, well,
it's the only place
I got accepted

661
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,966
and I'm looking
to pursue my degree in English

662
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,564
or law or animal husbandry
or anything really!

663
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,969
Did you just say
you got accepted here?

664
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,011
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah,
we all did.

665
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,068
What?

666
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,820
Thank you so much!

667
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,834
Oh, God.
Holy balls.

668
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,099
I'm sorry.

669
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,604
Move, fool.

670
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,812
Oh, look,
there's my old girlfriend,
Sara Pelfan.

671
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,145
You broke my heart!

672
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,547
Please.

673
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,688
Oh, uh, sorry, sorry.
No parents allowed
past this point.

674
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,695
It's part of our philosophy
here at South Harmon.

675
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,094
We need to mold
your kids into individuals,

676
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,256
and the first step is to

677
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,425
sever the ties of
the parent-child relationship.

678
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,798
Take him.

679
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,427
We're just glad
Larry got in someplace.

680
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:33,835
He's your problem now.

681
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,271
Bye, hon. No biting!

682
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,468
Hey, Larry.

683
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,540
Okay, good talk.
Go on in there.

684
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,239
You're gonna fit right in,
Larry. Unfortunately.

685
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:43,405
What are we gonna do?

686
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,812
This is supposed
to be a secret.

687
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,043
Yeah, well, I guess
the secret's out.

688
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,551
You go check the P.O. box,
I'm gonna go
find Schrader, okay?

689
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,853
Hey, pledge guy,
welcome to B.K.E. House.

690
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,660
Can I take
your blazer for you?

691
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,360
Get in there, your future
is right in there.

692
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,197
Thank you.
All right.

693
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:12,867
Oh, shit.

694
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,276
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.

695
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,374
Bartleby. Hey, how are you?
Hey, how you doing?

696
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,677
Good. I'm so sorry
about your jacket.

697
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,219
Dude, don't worry about it.
It's... It's not even
my jacket.

698
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,482
Perfect.
So, what are
you doing here?

699
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,786
I'm, I'm looking for Schrader,
actually. Have you seen him?

700
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,791
Uh, no, I haven't.

701
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,691
Hey, I'm Sherman Schrader.

702
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,224
I'll catch up with you.

703
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,490
Hey.

704
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,539
I'm Sherman Schrader. Okay.

705
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,807
This is fun.
I'm just gonna hang back

706
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,175
while you guys shoot around
and stuff, you know.

707
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,713
Oh, shit.

708
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:50,770
I got it.

709
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:00,086
Oh.
That's a... It's a G chord.

710
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,287
I used to play
in a Cranberries tribute band.

711
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,325
Uh, we disbanded.

712
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,956
Hey, you're Sherman Schrader.
Yeah.

713
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,966
Hoyt Ambrose.
Yes, right. I know.

714
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,969
Yes. You are the president
of this whole fraternity.

715
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,005
That's right.
Right.
You date Monica Moreland.

716
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,335
That I do.
Right.

717
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,136
I think about her
when I masturbate.

718
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,307
What?
What?

719
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,118
I didn't mean to say that.

720
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:34,257
Yeah. So, uh, Sherman's father
pledged alongside my father
back in the day.

721
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,553
Oh, so you're the legacy.

722
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,595
That's right. Legacy!

723
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,524
You need... You probably
need this to play, actually.

724
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,067
Was it here?

725
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,864
Uh, was it there? Was it...

726
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,371
So... So do you go
to school here now, or...

727
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,839
I don't. Uh,
I go to South Harmon.

728
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,103
Did you say South Harmon?

729
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,438
Yes, I did.

730
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,671
Oh, what's that?
Hmm?

731
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,441
Wha-What's South Harmon?

732
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,539
South Harmon is...
It's a college,

733
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,016
just a very small college.
Teeny, tiny college.

734
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,814
That's great. Well,
congratulations to you.
Thank you.

735
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,684
Hey, sweetie.
Hey!

736
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,189
Oh, my gosh,
I was so excited for you...

737
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,384
Actually, can you just give me
just one sec, okay? Thanks.

738
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,121
Hey, winner, Hoyt Ambrose.

739
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,191
Floyd Pambrose.

740
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,664
That's weird.
Our names rhyme.

741
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,200
Yeah, that is
pretty weird.

742
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,895
That's kind of crazy.
Welcome to B.K.E.

743
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,995
Thanks. It's great.
I love it here.

744
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,903
All the sexually repressed
energy.
Oh.

745
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,340
I love it.
A lot of anti-Semitism,
but under the rug, you know.

746
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,401
I like it, I like the way
you handle your business.

747
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:28,638
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

748
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,874
Well, hey, why don't you
just hang around
and meet some guys?

749
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,541
Oh, no, thanks, man,
I'm not into guys.

750
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,711
I totally respect
your lifestyle choice, though.
And good luck with it.

751
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,752
Your parents probably
don't get it, but I do.

752
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:40,791
I'll see you later, Monica.
Bye. It was good
to see you.

753
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,917
I'll see you later, Thor.
I mean Dirk.

754
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,121
Uh, I mean Trent.
Sorry, Troy.

755
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,626
Whoop, sorry, Goldie.

756
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,193
Schrader, where you been?
I've been calling you
for half an hour.

757
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,135
What the hell, man?
I'm in the middle of rush.

758
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,435
I don't care, man.
I got a situation goin' on.

759
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,997
This is huge for me,
all right?

760
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,976
You can't be here right now.
Okay, okay, okay.

761
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:02,205
Remember that time
we had to steal
my mom's birth control pills?

762
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,771
Yeah, and then
Lizzie was born.
It's worse than that.

763
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,248
Where did these people
come from?

764
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,047
Oh, from the chaos catalog.
They were going
out of business.

765
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,747
What is happening?
I'll tell you
what's happening.

766
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,689
I told you to make
the website look legitimate,
not functional.

767
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,090
Hey, you wanted to
fool your dad.
And the guy's not an idiot.

768
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,391
And, also, it was your idea
to put "Acceptance is just
one click away."

769
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,831
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Put it as one click away,
you don't make it clickable.

770
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,895
Oh, my...
Holy shit.

771
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:26,993
Yeah.

772
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,164
They all paid
first semester's tuition?

773
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,071
Oh, yeah.
10,000 bucks apiece.

774
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,372
I stopped counting
after the first 100 checks.

775
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,469
That's $74,000,000.

776
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,274
It's $1,000,000, Glen.

777
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,214
Yeah. In human dollars.

778
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,752
Okay, okay, okay.
We gotta do something.

779
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,482
Hey, don't look at me.
Ask one of
the founding fathers.

780
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,545
B?

781
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,786
This isn't my deal, man.

782
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,057
I told you this was
a bad idea
from the get-go.

783
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,119
True.

784
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,259
We could have
a Battle Royale.

785
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,498
Wow.
What is that?

786
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:04,305
B, you gotta
tell these people to go home.

787
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,032
You are absolutely right,
my friend.

788
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,543
I started this,
I'm gonna finish it.

789
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:08,704
Thank you.

790
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:16,675
Go.

791
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,492
Hey. Hey, Glen!

792
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,759
All right.

793
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,735
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

794
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,941
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, everybody.

795
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,909
Can I... Can I just
get your attention
for one minute?

796
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,377
Um, yeah, I'll be taking
questions in a minute.

797
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,278
Just give me one second,
please. Hold on.
All right.

798
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,872
Who the hell are you?

799
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,352
Ah-ah. Okay.

800
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,785
That's a good question.
Thank you.

801
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,755
My name's Bartleby. Hello.

802
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,088
Um, Gaines,
for what it's worth.

803
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,127
And, um, you know
on the website how it said,

804
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,254
"Acceptance is just
one click away"?

805
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,422
Do you remember that?

806
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:01,795
We had intended...
Hold on.

807
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,596
We added that
because we were...
Aw, shit.

808
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,003
Yeah, okay, what... I'm sorry.
What... What... What do you want?

809
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:09,903
When I got accepted here,

810
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:13,102
it was the first time
my parents ever said
they were proud of me!

811
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,190
That's cool.
Um, that's cool, man.

812
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,932
Hey, uh, just show of hands,
how many people
applied to other colleges?

813
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,170
Everybody. Uh, okay.

814
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:44,466
And how many of you got in
to the other places
you applied to?

815
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,241
Nobody.

816
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,046
Nobody got in anywhere else?

817
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,050
And you know what?
I didn't, either.

818
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,682
I didn't get into
a real college.

819
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,624
A really, really good college.

820
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,161
I know what it's like
to be rejected. It sucks.

821
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,028
Rejection blows.
Being said no to.

822
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,829
You know what,
I'm sorry, you're just
not quite good enough.

823
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,130
You didn't have
enough extracurriculars.

824
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,295
You didn't play enough tennis.

825
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,896
You didn't study hard enough
for your scores.
So you're not gonna make it.

826
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,770
You know what? Screw that!

827
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,934
What's he doing?

828
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,136
I think
he's winging it.

829
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,771
Shouldn't we all have
the chance to be said yes to?

830
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,112
At South Harmon,
we say yes to you!

831
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,277
We say yes to your hopes.

832
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,252
We say yes to your dreams.

833
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,983
We say yes to your flaws!
So welcome!

834
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,490
Grab a room, grab a friend,

835
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,083
grab yourself,
we don't give a shit.

836
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,890
Welcome to South Harmon
Institute of Technology!

837
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,493
Oh, man.

838
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,297
And welcome to S.H.I.T.!

839
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,300
You! I love you!

840
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:04,945
What are you doing?

841
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,118
Do you realize
how stupid this is?

842
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,250
You invited everyone
to a college
that doesn't exist.

843
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,887
I... I just couldn't do it,
okay? You saw their faces.

844
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,191
They got rejected
from everywhere.

845
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:16,062
What... What kind of message
does that send if I reject
them from my college?

846
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,760
You don't have a college!

847
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,097
Hey, hey, hey,
where's the bookstore?

848
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,159
Oh, we have a deal
with Amazon.

849
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,535
You just buy 'em
with a credit card.

850
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,698
When do we sign up
for classes?

851
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,240
Uh, we extended orientation.
You're fine.

852
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,208
Hey, man, where the heck
do we eat around here?

853
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,006
Uh, Glen, uh, 300 pizzas.
Order them.

854
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,070
18 pizza pockets.
What? No, no, no. 3...

855
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,707
Hey, who do I give
my intuition money to?

856
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,576
Who? What?
Me, I guess.

857
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,884
I'm done fishing singles
out of my G-string.

858
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,391
I'm a college girl now!
Aw, yeah.

859
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,620
Wow.

860
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:47,230
Uh, B, hey, uh,
you just started
a fictional college.

861
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,663
Oh, God. Yeah, yeah, okay.

862
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:49,961
Hey, do you guys have
a swim team here?

863
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,332
Yes, you know what?
This is Hands Holloway.
He's the Athletic Director.

864
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,928
He can help you with anything
you need to know.
I can't do it right now.

865
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,303
Thank you, though, thank you,
I'm sorry.

866
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,366
Uh, you guys,
what are we gonna do now?
I just need a minute to think.

867
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,270
What? What the...
Holy shit!

868
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,982
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Tex!

869
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,783
What the hell
are you guys doing?

870
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,721
What do you mean?
We're makin' the room bigger!

871
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,521
Yeah, Thorgeous,
but this is my room.

872
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,563
Who's in charge
of room assignments
around here, anyway?

873
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,222
Guys, I'd like you
to meet Rory.

874
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,234
She is the resident S.H.I.T.
room assignmenter.

875
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,202
And she'll be
more than happy to help you
out with that. Okay?

876
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,398
Okay, uh,
I... I guess I'll show you
your rooms.

877
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,770
Follow me.
Thanks.

878
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,138
Sorry about the wall.

879
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,301
Oh, it's fine.
Don't worry about it, man.

880
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:34,901
It happens all the time.
No problem.

881
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,571
Yeah, well, we actually
do have a problem

882
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,114
because you don't know
how to run a college.

883
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,410
It's fine. It's okay.
It's fine.

884
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,974
We'll just relax,
get some sleep, we'll regroup
tomorrow morning.

885
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,350
It will be totally calm.

886
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,465
Ahoy! Scallywags
and scally-ladies.

887
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,371
Okay, dude, B, I'm with you
on this, I am.

888
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,206
But we need a plan, dude.
We need a plan now.

889
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,337
I know. I know.
I... I... I... I'm processing.

890
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,147
You're gonna need
to process faster.

891
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,688
What is... Why are the...
Find out what's going on.

892
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,983
- Yo!
- <i>Ah, there's my college man.</i>

893
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,355
<i>How you doin', kid?</i>

894
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,587
Dad, now is not the... the...
the best time to talk.

895
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:25,686
<i>Hang on,</i>
<i>let me get your mother.</i>

896
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,196
Can I have this?
Come here,
let me talk to you.

897
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:30,461
Diane, pick up!
Honey! Is it you?

898
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,796
Stop yellin'
in the damn phone.

899
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,633
Oh, it feels like ages
since we've spoken to you.

900
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,172
How's school so far?

901
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,265
Oh, it's going great.
It's going really...

902
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,435
Hey, someone here
order two dozen kegs?

903
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:43,207
The... The... The old guy
with the hat, playing craps.

904
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,508
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>was that?</i>

905
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,379
Sounded like
he said something
about two dozen kegs.

906
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,281
Bartleby, are you
experimenting with alcohol?

907
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:49,944
<i>Aw, no, no, no.</i>
<i>He said two dozen eggs, Mom.</i>

908
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,851
You misunderstood.
Two dozen eggs.

909
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,150
What took you so long?

910
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,089
I've been building
a thirst over there!

911
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,753
Hey, listen,
I'm not paying for you
to be making omelets up there.

912
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,420
<i>Tell me what classes</i>
<i>you're taking.</i>

913
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:00,486
Classes?

914
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,595
Uh, right. I'm taking...

915
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,160
Statistics.

916
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,530
And, uh, business

917
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,267
and anatomy.

918
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,138
- <i>Anatomy?</i>
- <i>Anatomy?</i>

919
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,471
Thanks, dude.

920
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:14,770
<i>Bartleby, Bartleby!</i>

921
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:15,834
Yeah!

922
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,944
Hey. I always wanted
to go to college.

923
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,680
Couldn't get in
anywhere, though,

924
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,982
'cause I was in the military.

925
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,079
Oh.
Beverage ops.

926
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,318
I was snooping around,
saw something secretive.

927
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,053
Next thing I know
CIA swoops in,

928
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,958
does this whole
brain-scramble thing.

929
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,018
Now I can't remember anything.

930
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,689
So do you have room
at the college for me?

931
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,791
You know what, we already
started the semester,
I'm sorry.

932
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,529
That's cool, man.
Yeah.

933
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,503
It's just I... I got
my GI Bill,

934
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,836
and I can pay you
all four years in advance.

935
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,536
Okay, you're in.
Yeah!

936
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,601
Yeah, welcome
to South Harmon. Whoo-hoo!

937
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,342
How's the processing?

938
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,184
I just have to figure
this whole college thing out.

939
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,786
Here at Harmon College,
we offer a highly structured,

940
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:07,854
time-tested curriculum
carefully designed
to stimulate the young mind.

941
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,128
So, Mr. Gaines,
you're thinking
about transferring?

942
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,362
I don't know
about transferring.

943
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,028
My life is kind of, like,
a little weird right now.

944
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,628
But I just kind of
want to figure out

945
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,264
what all this
is all about.

946
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,433
Sorry.

947
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,774
A-And what college
are you attending right now?
Sorry?

948
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,440
The college that you're...
Oh,
it's down there. By the thing.

949
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:25,573
Pardon me?

950
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,482
I'd like to look around,
if that's okay.
Uh, that's fine.

951
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:29,678
If that's what
you'd like to do.

952
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:32,244
Thank you. It was... It was,
uh, it was great to meet you.

953
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,312
Oh, shit. Sorry.

954
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,120
That's all right. No.
You know what? Leave them,
leave them alone.

955
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,058
Leave it,
leave them alone.

956
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,527
And go on and take
your tour, okay?

957
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:44,431
A single rate of income tax
eliminates loopholes,

958
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,493
allowances and exemptions

959
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,731
as well as
encourages payments

960
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,865
through use of
low interest rates,

961
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,499
which theoretically
would cause

962
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,668
an economic boom.

963
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:57,043
Now if you would
refer back...
Aw, shit. I'm sorry.

964
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,447
So theoretically
what I was saying was...

965
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,578
This guy's pretty boring.

966
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,485
Don't talk to me, man!
Right, this is gonna be
on the midterm.

967
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,114
And my whole life is riding
on an A in this class.

968
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:13,794
This guy's...
EBITA!

969
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,922
What?

970
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,797
Earnings Before Interest,
Taxes and Amortization.

971
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,169
<i>Good afternoon, students,</i>

972
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,173
<i>and welcome, everyone</i>
<i>in the spillover class.</i>

973
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,401
What the... What is this?

974
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,240
<i>We'll begin today's lecture...</i>

975
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,686
Okay, great, yeah.
I'll see you
in the library at 8:00.

976
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,779
And I'll bring my notes.
Okay, see you then.

977
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,323
Bye, Monica.

978
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,262
Monica. Hey.

979
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:51,096
Bartleby. Hey, what, are you
stalking me or something?

980
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,157
Stalking's an ugly word.

981
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,932
I like to think of it more
like obsessively shadowing.
Oh.

982
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,303
I'm thinking about going here,
so I'm checking out
the classes.

983
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,706
Really?
Yeah. Do you like
all your classes?

984
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,802
Yeah. I mean, well,
I'm taking a bunch of classes

985
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,278
that I don't
really care about.

986
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,338
There was this one, though,
that I was dying to take.

987
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,714
But, um, I ended up
not being able to.
But, you know, it's okay.

988
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:09,218
What was that one
that you wanted to take?

989
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:12,744
Uh, ph-photography. It's...
Really? That's cool.

990
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,682
Yeah.
What was the problem?

991
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,386
Well, see, there's this,
um, photojournalism class,

992
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,258
but they said it's only
for journalism majors.

993
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,991
And then there's this
art photography class,

994
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,657
but they said
it's for fine arts majors.

995
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,066
So my advisor said
it would be best not to take
either one, or something,

996
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:28,036
because certain
photography classes

997
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,437
don't apply
to a degree in photography.

998
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:32,776
Wow, that makes,
that makes no sense at all.

999
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,243
I know.
Um, but I'm really sorry.

1000
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,803
I gotta go, I'm gonna be late
for my Ancient Roman
History class.

1001
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,679
It was good seeing you. Bye.
Okay. Bye.

1002
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,218
Hey, uh...

1003
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,616
I'm... I'm
just saying, I mean,
is that what college is?

1004
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:53,322
What were you expecting?
A renaissance
of the human spirit?

1005
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,695
American education
is in the shitter.

1006
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,926
You know why?

1007
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:00,095
Because people forget
the most important rule.

1008
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,999
College is
a service industry.

1009
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,398
A service industry?

1010
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:08,206
As in "serve us,"
as opposed
to the other way around.

1011
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,337
Look, you see
all these kids out here?

1012
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:11,938
They all paid
to come here.

1013
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,779
Right.
They all paid
for an experience.

1014
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,318
What kind of experience?

1015
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,877
The hell if I know.
I'm not a goddamn mind reader.

1016
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,250
Well, maybe
I should just ask them.

1017
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,256
Welcome to the conversation.

1018
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,055
What do I want to learn?

1019
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,628
Why are you asking me?

1020
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,756
Well, I'm asking you, Glen,
because I have a hunch

1021
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,663
that no one's ever really
asked you that before. Yeah?

1022
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:33,931
Well, I like pancakes
and alfalfa sprouts
and lemonade.

1023
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,529
Okay, you know what,
let's appropriate the bulk
of this man's tuition

1024
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,074
to learning more
about the culinary arts.

1025
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,302
Huh?
Food.

1026
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:40,638
All right.
All right.

1027
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:41,939
Rory. What about you?

1028
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,640
Ever since nursery school,
every single waking moment

1029
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,706
of every single day
has been scheduled.

1030
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,479
So what do I want to do?

1031
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,342
Nothing.

1032
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,486
Cheap, zen, beautiful.
I like it.
Hands, what about you?

1033
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:56,082
Summer camp
I made a paperweight
and won Camp Nagachewy's

1034
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,152
coveted woodcarving award
and next day,

1035
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,322
ran a 4.6 forty and it's
been football ever since.

1036
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,162
Mmm. Woodcarving,
sculpting. Good,
something with your hands.

1037
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,292
Well, there may be
something in there.

1038
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,429
You can think about that,
and then get back to me.
All right?

1039
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,235
Schrader, what about you?
Well, B, I'm glad
you asked, actually.

1040
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:12,673
'Cause since
we're going to prison,

1041
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:15,109
I'm gonna learn how to carve
a shank out of my toothbrush.

1042
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,113
Okay, ha-ha. I'll tell you
something, though.

1043
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,046
All our lives
we've been told
what to learn.

1044
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,311
Well, today the tide
is gonna turn, my friend.

1045
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,114
Because today
we're gonna ask the customer.

1046
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,246
What do I want to learn?
What do I want to learn?

1047
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,653
What am I interested
in studying?

1048
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,713
Huh?
What?

1049
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,349
W-What?
Come again.

1050
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,189
That's a good question.
No, really, come again.

1051
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:33,092
I thought you were
supposed to tell us.

1052
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,721
Please come again!

1053
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,023
I want to meet girls.

1054
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,124
Girls.
Girls.

1055
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:40,261
Some girls!
Uh, girls.

1056
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,497
I wanna rock!

1057
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:43,731
You know, and roll.

1058
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,638
Well, as you can probably
tell at this point,

1059
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,506
is that I really want to learn
how to slow things down.

1060
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,273
More speed.
More vert.

1061
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:51,246
Maybe something
with clothes, you know?

1062
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,748
Putting them on,
taking them off.

1063
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,182
I'm really good at that part.
You wanna see?

1064
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,244
I want to learn
how to blow shit up
with my mind.

1065
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:02,558
Okay.
Well, write it
on the board.

1066
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,117
Go ahead.

1067
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,691
Okay, thanks. Okay.

1068
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,098
All right.
Thank you, smiley.

1069
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,106
Pleasure doing business
with you.

1070
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,334
Yeah, buddy.

1071
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,750
Taxes? I'll tell you
about that nonsense.

1072
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,752
If you're rich,
the government'll protect

1073
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,651
every buck you make
and every shit you take.

1074
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,958
Kiki Dee.
Got a job for you, kid.

1075
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,052
New school colors and logo.
You're in charge.

1076
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,824
Really?
Don't screw it up.

1077
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:44,265
I won't screw it up,
I... I won't screw anything...

1078
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,486
What are you?

1079
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:44,652
Health insurance, my ass.
They don't pay for shit!

1080
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:48,255
You get sick on a Friday,
they only pay for Monday
through Thursday.

1081
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,495
You go to Dr. A,
they only pay for Dr. B.

1082
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,503
You break your penis,
they only fix vaginas.

1083
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,638
You mind if I join you?

1084
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,137
Ah, cool. Awesome.
Thank you, that was great!

1085
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,771
I'll see you guys later.
Okay, bye.

1086
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,913
That's pretty, uh...

1087
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,682
I know, right?

1088
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,879
That's African
fertility sculpture.

1089
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:12,751
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.

1090
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,386
The wood speaks to me.

1091
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,520
The wood speaks to you?

1092
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,933
Ladies and gentlemen,
the new S.H.I.T. line.

1093
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,571
Thank you.

1094
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,805
What is learning?
It's paying attention!

1095
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:44,547
It's opening yourself up
to this great big ball of shit
that we call life!

1096
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,988
And what's the worst thing
that can happen?
You get bit in the ass!

1097
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:51,494
Well, let me tell you,
my ass looks like
hamburger meat,

1098
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,620
but I can still sit down!

1099
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,663
I can't believe
this is a class.

1100
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:00,725
Yeah.

1101
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,008
Look what I did.

1102
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:14,344
Ugh. What are those?

1103
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,783
I call 'em GlenWads.

1104
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,821
They contain
every delicious flavor
in every single bite. Try one.

1105
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,584
I'm not gonna lie to you.
They look disgusting.

1106
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,818
This shit will get you high
on flavor alone.

1107
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,555
Glen, I love
your Wads. Hmm.

1108
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,618
Glen.

1109
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,860
This is like the most...
Literally the most incredible
thing I've ever eaten.

1110
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,892
Heads up, bro.

1111
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,058
Whoa.

1112
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,734
And it's so easy
to swallow. Mmm.
Wow, Glen.

1113
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,639
Uh, excuse me. Thanks, buddy.
Sure.

1114
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,642
Hey, how's it going?
Hey.

1115
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,304
Can I help you with something?

1116
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,143
Aren't you that guy?

1117
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,039
No, I don't think so.

1118
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,085
You're not?
I'm not what?

1119
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,177
I saw you at rush.
What are you doing here?

1120
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,586
I'm eating a Wad, man.
What are you doing here?

1121
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:55,384
Wait... wait, let me guess.

1122
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,552
You want me
to sign your petition

1123
00:49:57,627 --> 00:50:00,460
banning minorities
from your yacht club. No?

1124
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,354
I am the chairman,
actually,

1125
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,696
of the Student Community
Outreach Committee
at Harmon College.

1126
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,827
Ah! That was my next guess.
My next guess.

1127
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,097
That sounds very important.

1128
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,934
As a matter of fact, it is!
That's why I said it.

1129
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,304
And Harmon wants
to buy this property,

1130
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,435
so do you know
where I could find
the lease holder?

1131
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,671
I do.

1132
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,007
Well, could you tell me?

1133
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,416
Oh, yeah, I could.
I could, Gunther.

1134
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,011
Okay, well,
are you going to tell me?

1135
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,022
No. I'm not gonna tell you.
I will tell you this.

1136
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,581
The lease holder's
not interested in relocating
at any point.

1137
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,786
So thanks for asking,
and have a good day.

1138
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,057
And enjoy the game show
that you host. Bye-bye.

1139
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,428
Oh, look out.

1140
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:36,898
Open it.

1141
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,458
Ah. Thank you for coming by.

1142
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,403
Have a good day.
I'm gonna go enjoy my Wad.

1143
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,207
Hey! What the hell
is this place?

1144
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:51,039
South Harmon
Institute of Technology.
The best college ever.

1145
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:03,820
Is this a test?

1146
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:10,259
Hey, Sperminator.

1147
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:16,336
South Harmon?

1148
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,634
Knock, knock.

1149
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:19,866
Oh, hey, Gwynn.

1150
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:22,411
Hey. Hey, what are you doing
up here all by your lonesome?

1151
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,379
You know, you're
missing the whole party.

1152
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,940
Hey, have you ever heard
of the South Harmon
Institute of Technology?

1153
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:29,576
No. How come?

1154
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,778
No reason.

1155
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:33,755
Hey, pledge.

1156
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:36,150
Hello, knights of freedom.

1157
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:39,059
Sperman, do you know
why you're dressed like this?

1158
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,188
Because it's required
for brotherhood.

1159
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,697
Drink this.
Okay.

1160
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,064
No, wait.

1161
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:49,932
There you go.

1162
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,903
Good addition, sir.

1163
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,112
Hey, Hoyt.
Hey, what are you doin'?

1164
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,180
Oh-oh. Hoyt.

1165
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,590
Monica. Hold on. Shit!

1166
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,265
Harmon Gateway,
my ass.
Let me tell you something.

1167
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:24,296
That's the kind of group-think
mob mentality
that's dumbing down America

1168
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,205
and flushing your brains
down the toilet.

1169
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:29,074
B! We have a problem.

1170
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:33,709
Virgin daiquiri.

1171
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,876
And easy on the lime there,
Eraserhead.

1172
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,146
Comin' right up.

1173
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,518
Lizzie.
What are you doing here?

1174
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:43,184
You mean I can't swing by
and visit my big brother
at college?

1175
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,490
You are in college,
aren't you?

1176
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,121
What is that
supposed to mean?

1177
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:49,324
Come on, Bartleby.
The jig's up.

1178
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:51,264
I'm telling Mom and Dad.

1179
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,199
Uh, listen,
w-w-what do you want?

1180
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,430
$20,000.

1181
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,029
What? No way!
That's insane. Come on.

1182
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:58,506
I'm not gonna
play your little game.

1183
00:52:58,575 --> 00:52:59,803
I'm not gonna
give you a cent.

1184
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:02,208
How do you like that?
How do you like
them apples, huh?

1185
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,247
Fortunately, Mom and Dad
are on speed dial.

1186
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,043
Oh.
I'll ask them
to pick me up here.

1187
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,584
Okay, you're gonna
call Mom and Dad, sure.
Ringing.

1188
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:09,846
You are bluffing
with the best.

1189
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,581
You're very good, though.
I gotta give it to you.

1190
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:12,781
Hi, Mom.
Okay, stop it.

1191
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,118
Anything you want,
not money-related.

1192
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,215
Your Razor scooter.
Done.

1193
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,157
And a fake ID.
No! That's ridiculous.

1194
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:18,626
I'm not gonna let you drink.

1195
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,720
It's so I can vote, dumbass.

1196
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,331
Oh. Okay, deal.

1197
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,537
You need a Razor scooter
to vote?

1198
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:30,505
What do you mean,
they're a college?

1199
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:32,701
They're called
the South Harmon
Institute of Technology.

1200
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,801
The South Harmon
Institute of Technology?

1201
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,743
What is this,
some kind of joke?

1202
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,405
No, I don't think it is, sir.

1203
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,210
Mr. Ambrose,
that is the one building

1204
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:42,444
standing between me
and the Van Horne Gateway.

1205
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,077
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, sir.

1206
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,781
Tell me that
you're not that naive.

1207
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,847
Colleges don't just
spring up out of
the ground overnight.

1208
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,051
You're right.
You're right, sir.

1209
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,787
I know I'm right!

1210
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:54,822
All right, don't worry.
I'll... I'll figure a way
to get them out of there.

1211
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,889
What an excellent idea,
Mr. Ambrose.

1212
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,936
That's the kind of thinking
that will get you
into law school.

1213
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,058
Coming through!

1214
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,156
Ow!

1215
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:45,739
Hey, what are you
doing here?

1216
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:48,283
I just came to thank you
so much for my camera, B.

1217
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,012
It was so sweet, thank you.

1218
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:53,180
Come on. Please,
I figured, who needs
a life's savings, right?

1219
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,622
Actually, I had a really
hard time finding this place.

1220
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,182
You... You guys aren't listed
in the phone book,

1221
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,125
and nobody really seems
to know about you guys.

1222
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,663
Yeah, yeah, we're... we're
a pretty well-kept secret.

1223
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,824
Well, let me...
let me show you
the rest of the place.

1224
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,958
Sure. Really?

1225
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,127
Yeah, of course.
Okay.

1226
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,260
Great.
Great.

1227
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:09,396
Let's, let's go.
All right.

1228
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,068
Two lava flows.
Thank you.

1229
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,507
And keep your voice down.
People are playing.

1230
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:16,272
Okay. Thanks, buddy. Mmm.
Oh, okay. Thank you.

1231
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,143
He makes a mean drink.
Yeah. It's great.

1232
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,579
All right. Hello.

1233
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,139
<i>How do you like your drink?</i>

1234
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,276
Yeah, it's really good, Glen.
Thanks.

1235
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,377
<i>Does she like hers?</i>

1236
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:25,785
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, she...

1237
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:26,981
Yeah, it's great.
Thank you.

1238
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,319
<i>Okay, great, thanks.</i>
Okay, pal. Okay.

1239
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:29,756
Ah, Glen.

1240
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:31,789
Wait. So this is
your course guide?

1241
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:33,055
Yeah, this is
a new pilot program.

1242
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:34,994
See, the administration
wanted us to create
our own classes,

1243
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:37,226
so we just, uh,
write 'em on the board.

1244
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,460
Really?
Yeah.

1245
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:39,729
Wow, that's so cool, B.

1246
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,065
Hey, why don't you
sign up for one?
No, no.

1247
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:42,661
Come on. Sign up for one.
No. No, Bartleby, no.

1248
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,331
It... It's painless. I insist.
Oh, really?

1249
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:46,341
Even if you don't
sign up for one
you'll go on a fun ride.

1250
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:47,706
Okay.

1251
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,472
Just stop me
when you see something
that you like.

1252
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:52,572
Okay. Oh, I like this one.
"Men: The Weaker Sex."

1253
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:53,980
Give me a pen.
Oh.

1254
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,508
B, there can't honestly
be a class called
"Bullshitting 236."

1255
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:00,720
What about "The Decline
and Fall of Chevy Chase"?

1256
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,086
There's a wait list
for that one.

1257
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,355
What?

1258
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:10,660
Are... Are you okay?

1259
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:11,860
What?

1260
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,667
What the hell happened?

1261
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,227
An explosion of flavor!

1262
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,739
I'm working with some
very unstable herbs!

1263
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,469
Wait, wait, wait.
So you're telling me

1264
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,977
that there are no tests,
or essays,

1265
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,946
or required reading,
or any of that nonsense?

1266
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:28,006
That's what
I'm sayin'.
Wow. Ever?

1267
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:29,278
Yeah. Never ever.

1268
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:31,115
Ask me about my wiener!
That's amazing.

1269
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:32,814
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1270
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:34,846
Oh, no.

1271
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,824
Ask me about my wiener!

1272
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,659
What the...

1273
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,425
Ask me about my wiener!

1274
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,659
Schrader?

1275
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,963
Oh,
hey, B.
Hi.

1276
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:48,128
And Monica.

1277
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,430
Hey.
Why... Why are you
wearing this?

1278
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:53,408
Every single brother
in my fraternity
has worn this suit.

1279
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,910
President James Garfield
wore this suit
like a gentleman.

1280
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,207
Oh, yeah,
and look what happened to him.

1281
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,578
He got assassinated
by Charles Guiteau.

1282
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:01,617
Don't ask me
how I know that.

1283
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:03,811
Do me a favor,
ask me about my wiener
really quickly.

1284
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:05,184
Schrader, no.

1285
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,018
Guys, my brothers
could be watching me
right now.

1286
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,614
Just ask me
about my wiener, please.

1287
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,683
Why are you
doing this?
What do you mean?

1288
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,228
Come on. You're...
This...

1289
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,087
You're humiliating
yourself, buddy.

1290
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,326
You know what, B.
Don't mess with me!

1291
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,425
These are the happiest times
of my life, all right?

1292
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,130
Schrader.
I'm so happy,
I'm the happiest.

1293
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,331
I'm happy!

1294
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,835
Hey! Ask me about my wiener!

1295
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,144
<i>S.H.I.T. Rag.</i>
Hot off the presses.

1296
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:31,804
Here you go, B.
Thanks, Boner.

1297
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:32,939
The <i>S.H.I.T. Rag?</i>

1298
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:34,415
Yeah, come on,
every school's
gotta have a paper.

1299
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:37,112
There's a great op-ed piece
in there about not believing
everything you read.

1300
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,312
It's really provocative.

1301
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:42,222
As your de facto consigliere
my advice to you is to
shut this down immediately.

1302
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,021
And my advice to you
is to stop worrying

1303
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:45,526
before you
spontaneously combust.

1304
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:46,926
Yes, but you can't
just do this.

1305
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,190
To be a real college,

1306
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,027
you have to go through
the appropriate
legal channels.

1307
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,191
You need to be accredited.

1308
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:52,894
Well, yeah,
could you take care of that?

1309
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,904
Hey, B.
Pancho, looking good, pal.

1310
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:57,230
Who's that?
Spank me.

1311
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,774
That's, uh, the mascot.

1312
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,407
Oh, it's the mascot?
Yeah.

1313
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,705
A sandwich?
Yes.

1314
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:04,338
You're the
S.H.I.T. Sandwiches?
Yes, we are.

1315
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,507
You are taking this
way too far.

1316
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,642
How so?
Oh, I don't know, man.

1317
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:10,913
Maybe it's the pool,
or the half-pipe.

1318
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,580
That's not in the budget.
I'm re-investing
in their education.

1319
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,556
Those are South Harmon
cornerstones there.

1320
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,490
Yes, but you're overlooking
zoning requirements,

1321
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,551
noise permits,
there are insurance issues.

1322
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,393
Come on. Insurance?
What's gonna happen?

1323
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,898
Oh, shit.

1324
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,369
Wow.

1325
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,144
Yeah!

1326
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,712
Aw, shit.

1327
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:43,251
We gotta do it again, dudes.
Left the lens cap on.

1328
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,253
No, you didn't!
Damn!

1329
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,122
You know what?
You're absolutely right.
This has gone way too far.

1330
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,184
And I think we need
to do something
about it ASAP.

1331
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:54,059
Thank you.
Thank you.

1332
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,683
Is this great
or is this great?

1333
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,480
It's pretty cool, man,
but I gotta go.

1334
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,681
The Roaring '20s
is B.K.E.'s biggest party
of the year.

1335
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,690
And we're recreating
the scene from
<i>The Untouchables</i>

1336
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,885
where Roy,
as Bobby De Niro,

1337
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,860
crushes my skull
with a baseball bat.

1338
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,692
Wow, what an
incredible honor.

1339
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,857
Could you sign a copy
of your book for me?

1340
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:32,663
I got it on eBay.
They sell my shit on eBay?

1341
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,293
You wrote a book?
Yeah.

1342
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,099
But that was back
when I was drinking.

1343
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:39,573
Come on, Glen,
you can't keep
stringing us along.

1344
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:41,974
Which one of us
is it going to be?

1345
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,125
<i>Quiet, quiet, quiet!</i>
<i>Quiet, shh!</i>

1346
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,162
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>let's give it up</i>
<i>for your fearless leader,</i>

1347
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,255
<i>Bartleby Gaines.</i>
<i>Come on up here, buddy!</i>

1348
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,962
Aw, man.

1349
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,797
Thanks. Thank you.
<i>Get up here!</i>

1350
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,666
<i>Come on up!</i>
<i>I know you know this one!</i>

1351
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:11,434
Go. Go up there right now.
Go, man, go!

1352
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,577
How you doin'?
Yeah! You the man.

1353
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,681
I'm going
to have that.

1354
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:54,142
Shut up.

1355
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,208
Look, where the hell
is everybody at?

1356
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:57,650
You! Hey.

1357
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,415
Hey.
How are you?

1358
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,481
Aw, God, look,
where the hell is everybody?

1359
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,692
This is the biggest
party of the year, guys.

1360
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:07,255
Band, hey!

1361
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,798
Ah, you want to start
playing some music, please?

1362
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,262
Hey.
Hoyt, hey.

1363
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,997
There's, like, some big party
down the hill.

1364
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:17,999
Oh, that son of a...

1365
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,356
Hey!
B, oh, my gosh,
that was fantastic.

1366
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:41,761
Aw, my God, you saw that.
I'm embarrassed.

1367
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:42,855
I don't know
what happened to me.

1368
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:46,265
Someone possessed me, and...
and it was the spirit
of Johnny Ramone, I think.

1369
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:49,065
B, is there anything
that you're not
incredibly amazing at?

1370
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:50,162
Yeah, it's funny
you should ask.

1371
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:51,968
There are very few things
I'm not very good at.

1372
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,067
Off the top of my head
I can think of spelunking,
uh, telekinesis,

1373
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:56,771
not crying at
the end of <i>My Girl.</i>

1374
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:59,007
It gets me.
And dairy products.

1375
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,209
Which is good, because
you know I'm not really
in the mood

1376
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:03,047
for any
dairy products tonight.

1377
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,877
Well, let's see
if we can get you
something else then.

1378
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:07,752
Let's see.
All right.

1379
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:10,986
This is my... Oh!
Ooh!

1380
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,221
I'm okay, I'm okay.
I keep forgetting
this opens out.

1381
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,854
It happens all the time,
I gotta get used to it.

1382
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,091
Oh, no.

1383
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:17,594
And this is

1384
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:20,097
<i>Mi casa.</i>

1385
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:24,262
Bartleby, uh, oh, my God,
this is amazing!

1386
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,671
Huh? It's fine.

1387
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,074
I mean, I like it
'cause it's simple,
and functional.

1388
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:30,840
Provides a good safe
workspace for me
to focus on my studies.

1389
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:38,747
B, this is so cheesy,
in the greatest way.

1390
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,883
There is nothing cheesy
about a clap-on disco ball.

1391
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,117
Maybe it's a little bit much.

1392
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:46,218
I've wanted one
since I was a kid, though.

1393
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:49,128
Wait, is everybody's room
at South Harmon
this incredible?

1394
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:50,460
Well, at South Harmon
you're free

1395
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:51,830
to kind of design
your own rooms, you know?

1396
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,266
Whatever you're thinking,
whatever you're...

1397
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:55,133
And I was thinking
clap-on disco ball.

1398
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:57,339
How about that drink?
Can I get you a drink?

1399
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,374
I would love a drink.
All right.

1400
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,510
Ah, touch.
Ahh.

1401
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,489
This party's
off the hook!

1402
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:24,624
Hey, hey, hey, shut up!

1403
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,167
All right.
Where is that asshole?

1404
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,471
Co-Come on, Bartleby,
that was 7th grade.

1405
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,302
Yeah, exactly,
that was my point.

1406
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,467
Well, I will
have you know...
Oh, now,

1407
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:36,068
now I can't go
back to your past,
but you can go back to mine.

1408
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,875
That Christina Aguilera look
did very well for me,
thank you very much.

1409
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,176
Yeah, you did great,
you did great. I know.

1410
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:42,717
I remember you making out
with Pete Goochman
in Julie Posner's basement.

1411
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:43,843
You were at that party?

1412
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,512
Oh, even if I wasn't there,
I would have known about it.

1413
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,055
It made headline news
at school.

1414
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,284
And... And... And that day
something happened in my life

1415
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:51,223
that I never thought
would happen.

1416
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:54,354
I became envious of Pete
"The Gooch" Goochman.

1417
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,895
Never thought
it would happen.

1418
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:58,593
But I was like,
"He got to make out
with Monica Moreland."

1419
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,762
Well, if you wanted to kiss me
so bad in the basement,
why didn't you?

1420
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,806
Well, 'cause the Gooch
beat me to it,

1421
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:06,569
and I was a little shy,
and, uh...

1422
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:10,040
Well, you want to
kiss me now, don't you?

1423
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:22,181
You look like Carly Simon!

1424
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,618
If I could bang
one woman in the world
it'd be Carly Simon,

1425
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,253
and you look like her!

1426
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:29,526
Are you having fun?

1427
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:31,661
I'm having so much fun.

1428
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,463
Let's go find him.
Oh!

1429
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,437
Oh, shit, oh, shit,
oh, shit, oh, shit.

1430
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,938
Sorry. One sec.

1431
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:52,219
Oh, shit.
Uh, I got a situation.

1432
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,650
Come, come with me.
Okay.

1433
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,666
Hey, have you
seen Schrader?

1434
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:06,693
Excuse me.

1435
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:09,531
Shit.

1436
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:12,571
Monica?
What are you doing here?

1437
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:15,907
Oh, you know, just picking up
my application for transfer.

1438
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,511
You're telling me that
you're with this guy now?

1439
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,708
Actually, Hoyt, um,

1440
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:24,014
I'm telling you
it's none of your business.

1441
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,444
It's none
of my business?
Yeah.

1442
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,114
Oh, snap!

1443
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,355
Hey, Hoyt, let me
introduce you to
an old friend of mine.

1444
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:34,362
The word "rejection."
She can be a real bitch.

1445
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,159
But you don't have
to give her roofies.

1446
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,166
So you're not gonna
like her.
Ooh.

1447
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,997
You want me to give you
something funny
to laugh about?

1448
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,401
You mean something
funnier than your future
alcohol abuse?

1449
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:43,995
Battle Royale!

1450
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,768
Uh, shit.
Let's go, guys.

1451
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,937
All right, come on, guys.
Let's get out of here.

1452
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:56,114
Wow, Monica, you really know
how to pick 'em, don't you?

1453
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:57,516
Have fun with these idiots!

1454
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:58,746
Bye-bye.
Bye.

1455
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:00,254
Thank you for comin'.

1456
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:02,223
Guys, let's get
the music back up! Come on!

1457
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,811
<i>Wet T-shirt party!</i>

1458
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:49,667
Mom? Dad?

1459
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,008
Gwynn.
Hi, there.

1460
01:06:57,913 --> 01:06:59,141
What are you doing here?

1461
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,546
I'm your escort.

1462
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:02,641
Induction night,
big guy.

1463
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:06,510
B.K.E., B.K.E.,
brotherhood, brotherhood,
you and me!

1464
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:09,888
B.K.E., B.K.E. brotherhood,
brotherhood, you and me!

1465
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,756
Sherman Schrader, you rock!

1466
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,727
Aw, no! You guys rock!

1467
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:15,889
Get ready to be inducted
into the brotherhood,
you winner!

1468
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:19,162
Yes! I want it! I want
everything you guys have.
Whoo!

1469
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,669
I want lilac shirts!
I want visors

1470
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:25,104
kind of tilted to the side,
with hair gel
coming out of it.

1471
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,142
I want to have sex with girls
that look like this!

1472
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:29,234
You rock!
I know I do!

1473
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,541
You do, yeah, you do.

1474
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:35,643
Do I get hair gel
now, or do I have to go
and buy my own?

1475
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:36,844
Did you crack him?

1476
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:37,977
No.

1477
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,354
We'll crack him.

1478
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:44,622
Sherman, do you know
how long that this
fraternity has survived?

1479
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,020
Yes, sir.

1480
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,586
153 majestic years, sir.

1481
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,724
That is correct.
Because it's based on
the most sacred principle

1482
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,962
that brothers can share.

1483
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:55,230
Trust.

1484
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,374
And seriously, bro, I'm...
I'm beginning to question

1485
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:00,739
whether or not
I can trust you.

1486
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:03,437
'Cause we know you been
hanging out with those
freaks down at the loony bin.

1487
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:05,673
So with your allegiance
being called into question,

1488
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,216
I just wanted
to ask you just one thing.

1489
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:10,480
Paddle.

1490
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,885
That's actually
not a question.
Shut up!

1491
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,383
Are you with them

1492
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:19,121
or are you with us?

1493
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:36,673
Decent party.

1494
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,649
Okay, I'll give you decent.

1495
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:57,359
Hey, where is Schrader?
He should be here for this.

1496
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:58,866
I don't know.
I haven't seen him
in a couple of days.

1497
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,196
I hope he's not sick.

1498
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,530
Okay. Quick, quick, quick,
everybody say "Cheers"!

1499
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,232
Hey, "quick, quick, quick,"
get up in here.

1500
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:05,500
No.
Oh, yes.

1501
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:08,099
Yes, yes, yes.
Come over here.
Okay.

1502
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,475
Gotta up
the gorgeous quotient.

1503
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,878
Okay. Get ready and now.

1504
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,918
Cheers!

1505
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,417
Schrader.

1506
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,148
Schrader, come on, open up.

1507
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:25,451
What are you...

1508
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,920
What the hell happened to you?

1509
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:33,731
Nothing. Just a little
ritual bonding over
at the B.K.E. House.

1510
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,564
What?
What are you talking about?

1511
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:38,300
They kicked my ass,
until I told them
all about South Harmon.

1512
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,338
Oh, shit.

1513
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:43,337
They took my laptop,
the mailing list, everything.

1514
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:46,610
Shit. Man, I'm sorry.

1515
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,708
All I ever wanted
was a run-of-the-mill
college experience.

1516
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:51,650
But not me, right?
I can't have that.

1517
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,778
Not me!

1518
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,584
'Cause I'm too busy
getting the shit
kicked out of me

1519
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:55,988
and being an accomplice
to fraud!

1520
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,616
Does
the run-of-the-mill
college experience

1521
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,183
include stripping you
of your dignity?

1522
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:02,389
Totally humiliating you,
making you wear a... a... a
frigging hot dog suit?

1523
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:03,988
It's a tradition.
A tradition?

1524
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:05,658
Yes.
I got a tradition
for you.

1525
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:08,999
Schrader, you've been
my best friend
since we were 5 years old.

1526
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:10,800
That's the only tradition
I know.

1527
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:23,011
I just messed up.
I really messed up.

1528
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,848
How? What happened?

1529
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,248
With Schrader.

1530
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:28,085
I know Bartleby
is by the pool.

1531
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:29,249
Oh, my God.

1532
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:30,585
What is it? Cops?

1533
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:32,559
Worse. Parents.

1534
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:36,830
Mom! Dad! Great!

1535
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,590
Hey, guys.

1536
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,464
Bartleby! Hiya, kid!

1537
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,794
Hey, oh, it's so good
to see you!

1538
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:45,305
Oh, it's great
to see you. Ow.
You look thin.

1539
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:47,774
There's five good ones
right there
for my college boy, huh?

1540
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,174
Hey, hey, Dad.

1541
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,907
Wha... What... What... What
are you doing here?

1542
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:53,038
Well, Parents' Day.

1543
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:55,508
What a wonderful idea
on the part of the college,
you know?

1544
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,211
Yeah.
Oh, right.

1545
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:59,446
Parents' Day.
Of course.

1546
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,285
Hello, everyone.
Now, welcome to Parents' Day.

1547
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:04,553
And, uh, we're very glad
you could be here.

1548
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:07,528
Um, we have a wonderful
guided tour planned

1549
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,325
a-around the grounds
and the campus,

1550
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:11,059
Show you
what we've been working on
all year.

1551
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,760
So, welcome one and all.
Excuse me,
everyone.

1552
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:13,961
May I have
your attention, please?

1553
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,264
Oh, shit.

1554
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:16,668
I knew I smelled bacon.

1555
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,736
My name is Richard Van Horne.

1556
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:19,831
Oh, Van Horne, yes.

1557
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:22,433
The... The dean
of Harmon College,
our big sister school.

1558
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:24,479
Give him a round of applause.
He's earned it.

1559
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:26,571
Thank you for comin' by.
Great to see him here.

1560
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:28,116
They are our
big sister school,

1561
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:30,413
and we are honored
by their presence.

1562
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:34,149
Thank you for that nice
introduction, young man,
but the joke is over.

1563
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:35,918
Ladies and gentlemen,

1564
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:38,255
South Harmon
Institute of Technology

1565
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,852
is not the sister school
of Harmon

1566
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:42,655
or of anything else,
for that matter.

1567
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:44,494
More like cousins.
Thank you for coming.

1568
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,966
It is not accredited.
Any...

1569
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:50,071
Nor is it truly
an educational institution.

1570
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,907
Is this true, Bartleby?

1571
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:57,668
It is a sham, a fraud,

1572
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:00,642
that undermines the efforts
of real colleges everywhere,

1573
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:02,343
and I invite you
to confirm that

1574
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,750
with the State Board
of Accreditation.

1575
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,084
To all those students
who have been duped,

1576
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,488
good luck applying
to schools next year.

1577
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:13,790
And to Mr. Gaines
I say you will be hearing
from our attorneys.

1578
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:20,399
Wow, Parents' Day.
Man, I wish I would have
thought of that.

1579
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,228
Oh, that's right, I did.

1580
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:24,830
Oh, and by the way,

1581
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:26,568
if you, uh, if you see
that lease holder of yours,

1582
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:28,234
will you tell him
that his lease
automatically breaks

1583
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,278
when he's found
guilty of fraud?

1584
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,643
Cool. Thanks, D.

1585
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,204
Er, was it G?

1586
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:35,514
That's right, it's F.
See you, F.

1587
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:40,116
Guys, I can explain.
Mmm-mmm.

1588
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,681
You have done
some stupid things
in your life, Bartleby,

1589
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:45,492
but this...

1590
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,828
You get your stuff together.
You meet us in the car.

1591
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:50,722
This is unconscionable.

1592
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:54,491
Ridiculous.

1593
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:57,997
Hey.

1594
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:01,602
So,

1595
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:04,973
none of this was real?

1596
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,344
That's not true.

1597
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:10,282
Wait, Monica. Monica, wait.

1598
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:11,880
Monica.

1599
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:17,022
Sorry, man.

1600
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:18,889
It's cool. We tried.

1601
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,240
Have you completely
lost your mind?

1602
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:17,073
Guys, the state defines
a college as a body of people

1603
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:19,511
with a shared common purpose
of a higher education.

1604
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:20,707
Well that's us, isn't it?

1605
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:23,148
I mean, you know,
with the word "higher"
kind of loosely defined.

1606
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:25,982
Uh, yeah.
He's completely lost his mind.

1607
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:27,749
No, no. Listen,
all we have to do

1608
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,450
is go before
the state accrediting board,

1609
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,720
with a licensed administrator,
and just present our case.

1610
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:34,284
B, look, let's just cut
our losses, okay?

1611
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:36,421
What are we
talking about here, huh?

1612
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:37,829
We're talking about
a stupid piece of paper.

1613
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,197
I mean,
if a stupid piece of paper

1614
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:41,168
is what's gonna
make us acceptable,

1615
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:43,033
then let's go for it.
Why not?

1616
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:45,573
'Cause you gotta remember,
it's not just about us
anymore, okay?

1617
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,700
It's about everyone
who went to South Harmon.

1618
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:51,006
Ah, great speech.

1619
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:53,439
I was inspired,
I felt inspired by it.

1620
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,549
Thanks a lot,
I'm... I'm taking it on tour.

1621
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:56,709
What are you doing here?

1622
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:59,447
Aw, I don't know. I had...
I had to pick up some stuff.

1623
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:02,820
Some sage. Eggplant.
Olive oil. Some Funyuns.

1624
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:05,386
Wait a minute.

1625
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:06,756
Come on!

1626
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:09,058
You're the one that applied
for accreditation,
aren't you?

1627
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,395
Well, someone had
to do it, you know?

1628
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:13,491
We all can't live
with our heads up our asses.

1629
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,730
I disagree.
I... I don't get it, man.

1630
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:17,362
You said you didn't wanna
be a part of this thing.

1631
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:19,304
I didn't want to have
anything to do with it.

1632
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:22,571
I wanted to be
the fourth generation
of Schrader to go to Harmon.

1633
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:23,736
But then I realized,

1634
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:26,337
I would much rather be
the first generation
of Schrader

1635
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:29,009
to go to the South Harmon
Institute of Technology.

1636
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:30,483
I said it, okay?
I said it.

1637
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:32,110
So you're saying,

1638
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:33,916
you're saying
you want to be
a S.H.I.T. head?

1639
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:36,721
I'm sayin' I want to be
a S.H.I.T. head.

1640
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:37,816
I wanna be a S.H.I.T. head.

1641
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:39,918
Yeah, man, well, it's good
to have you back, buddy.

1642
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,124
Yes.
Yeah!

1643
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:43,255
Yay!

1644
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:44,526
All right,
so we're doing it.

1645
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,228
Thanks to this S.H.I.T. head,
we got a hearing
set for Friday.

1646
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:55,369
Don't sweat it, kid.
I'm all over it.

1647
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,173
All right, please remember,
Ben, this is serious,
all right?

1648
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,405
If this doesn't work,
I'm going to prison.

1649
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,675
Oh, don't worry,
you're young.
Your butt can take it.

1650
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:02,842
Hello, sir. Um,
we're from South Harmon.

1651
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:05,011
We have a 3:00
in Hearing Room A.

1652
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:08,386
Okay, actually
your meeting room's been
changed to the Grand Hall.

1653
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,618
Why the change?
It's bigger.

1654
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:18,796
How did they...
Rory called them.

1655
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:19,925
The whole school?

1656
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:21,469
I had to do something.

1657
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:26,334
This meeting of
the State Board of Education
will come to order.

1658
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:29,468
Today we'll be hearing
the case for accreditation

1659
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:32,240
for the South Harmon
Institute of Technology.

1660
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:35,147
Your case for accreditation
is being contested

1661
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:36,946
by Dean Richard Van Horne,

1662
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:38,577
representing Harmon College.

1663
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,758
Loser. Loser.

1664
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:47,727
In order to become accredited,

1665
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,723
a school must meet
three requirements.

1666
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:54,257
You must have a facility,
a curriculum and a faculty.

1667
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:56,536
Please state your case.

1668
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:58,430
You're on, kid.

1669
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:01,441
What? Wha... I thought
you were gonna handle this.
What are you doing?

1670
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,705
Rule number one,
lead with your star witness.

1671
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:06,873
Nobody knows South Harmon
and these kids
better than you.

1672
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:08,643
So, it's showtime.

1673
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:10,275
Let's kick some ass.

1674
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:13,177
You're gonna be great, man.
Just go do your thing.

1675
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:15,147
Sling some bull.

1676
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:17,253
Oh, God.

1677
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:18,919
Okay.

1678
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,089
Uh,

1679
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:24,588
ladies and gentlemen
of the panel, thank you
for meeting with us.

1680
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:27,965
Um, my name's Bartleby Gaines
and I'm the co-founder of

1681
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:29,765
South Harmon
Institute of Technology.

1682
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:43,175
Sorry. Friends of mine.

1683
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,749
Um, I'm... I'm sorry,
first of all,

1684
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:47,345
w-what were those
three things that you listed?

1685
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:50,186
A facility, a curriculum
and a faculty.

1686
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:51,350
Facility, right.

1687
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:53,291
Okay, well,
we definitely have a facility.

1688
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:56,421
Uh, we have a common room,
we have dorm rooms.

1689
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:58,527
Uh, we have
a skateboard ramp.

1690
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,090
We got a tiki bar. Umm...

1691
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,830
They have leased
an old mental hospital.

1692
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,133
They have
none of the traditional
support facilities

1693
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:06,299
or resources.

1694
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:09,775
Mr. Gaines,
do you have a formal
athletic facility?

1695
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:12,109
Okay, uh,
by formal you mean...

1696
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,317
No. No, we don't.

1697
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:17,749
A library?

1698
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:20,746
No.

1699
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:23,017
A health services center?
No.

1700
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:25,083
No.

1701
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:28,928
Your curriculum?

1702
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:30,225
Our curriculum?
Yes.

1703
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:34,200
Do you have a course book?
A comprehensive list
of your available classes?

1704
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,295
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Uh, Sunshine. Can you...

1705
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:50,716
What is this?

1706
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:53,619
Our curriculum.
These are the courses
we offer at South Harmon.

1707
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,717
This is a joke.
"Slacking 101"?

1708
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,057
Uh, tell me, Mr. Gaines,

1709
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:02,323
how does one major
in bumper stickers?

1710
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:04,022
Sir, um...

1711
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:05,191
I'm sorry, Mr. Gaines.

1712
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:07,497
I fail to see any merit

1713
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:11,027
or scholastic value
in anything listed
on that board.

1714
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:13,906
Okay, uh, guys,
you want to help me out here?

1715
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,000
In "Taking A Walk
and Thinking About Stuff,"

1716
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:18,102
we get to think about
what we want to do
with our lives

1717
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,875
in a stress-free environment.

1718
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:23,806
"Let It Speak To You 202"
is an art class in which
we discover our talents

1719
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,183
by examining our
personal life experiences.

1720
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:29,519
In "Skateboarding 234"
we built a ramp that teaches
us about engineering...

1721
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,252
And physics.
And aerodynamics.

1722
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,226
In "Rock Our Faces Off 222"

1723
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:36,662
we listen to the music
and lyrical angst
of a lost generation.

1724
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:38,330
And we rock our faces off.

1725
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:44,665
They do.

1726
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:49,374
Do you have
faculty present?

1727
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:50,937
Yes, we do, sir.

1728
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:53,471
Faculty, stand.

1729
01:20:57,385 --> 01:20:58,784
What is the meaning
of this?

1730
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,947
See, at South Harmon,
sir, the students
are the teachers.

1731
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:02,887
Aw, this is preposterous.

1732
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:05,984
Students are not
and cannot be teachers.

1733
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:07,423
Dean Van Horne
is right.

1734
01:21:07,495 --> 01:21:11,693
You must have a faculty
as defined by the state,
or you cannot be accredited.

1735
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:19,964
Mr. Gaines, have you
employed a faculty or not?

1736
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:25,071
Um...

1737
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:29,580
Present and accounted for.

1738
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:30,709
Oh, for God's sake.

1739
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:34,585
Dr. Alexander, this man
has not been a part of
academia for three decades.

1740
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:37,090
We were on the faculty
together at Harmon
in our late 20s,

1741
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:38,386
and he washed out.

1742
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,452
He's a drunk,
he's a degenerate,
and he's looney tunes.

1743
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:44,089
Hey, asshole!
You're talking about
my mom's brother!

1744
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:46,156
Oh, sit down!
Okay.

1745
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:50,034
Hey! Why don't you take
your PhD and shove it
up your A-S-S?

1746
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:58,606
Settle down
right this minute!

1747
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,547
Dean Lewis! Sit down.

1748
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:03,711
Order!

1749
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:06,411
Couldn't help myself.

1750
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:08,513
So, is that it,
Mr. Gaines?

1751
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,720
You have one formal teacher
for upwards of 300 students?

1752
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,629
Mr. Gaines.

1753
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:19,390
Answer the question.

1754
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:21,059
Nah, I'm not gonna
answer your question,

1755
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:22,831
'cause you guys have
already made up your minds.

1756
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:23,996
I'm an expert in rejection,

1757
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:25,733
and I can see it
on your faces.

1758
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,173
And it's too bad
that you judge us
by the way we look

1759
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,006
and not by who we are.

1760
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:31,978
Just because you want us
to be more like them

1761
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:33,537
when the truth is
we're not like them.

1762
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:35,879
And I am damn proud
of that fact.

1763
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:39,552
Rock on!

1764
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:42,283
I mean,

1765
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:46,683
Harmon College and their...
and their 100 years
of tradition.

1766
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:48,251
But tradition of what?

1767
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:49,854
Of hazing kids

1768
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:53,192
and humiliating anyone
who's a little bit different?

1769
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:54,360
Of putting
so much pressure on kids

1770
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:56,666
they turn into these...
these stress freaks
and caffeine addicts.

1771
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:59,935
Your phony school
demeans real colleges
everywhere!

1772
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:02,875
Why? Why can't
we both exist? Huh?

1773
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:04,605
You can have your grades,
and your rules

1774
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:06,510
and your structure,
and your ivory towers,

1775
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:07,707
and then we'll do things
our way.

1776
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:09,773
Why do we have to conform
to what you want?

1777
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:13,082
Your curriculum is a joke,
and you, sir, are a criminal.

1778
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,416
You know what?
You're a criminal.

1779
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,821
'Cause you rob these kids
of their creativity
and their passion.

1780
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:18,756
That's the real crime!

1781
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,419
Yeah.
Maybe he's right.

1782
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:24,356
Well, what about you parents?

1783
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:26,627
Did... Did the system
really work out for you?

1784
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:28,293
Did it teach you
to follow your heart,

1785
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:30,634
or to just play it safe,
roll over?

1786
01:23:30,705 --> 01:23:32,195
What about you guys?

1787
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:34,104
Did you always want to be
school administrators?

1788
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:35,608
Dr. Alexander,
was that your dream?

1789
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:38,077
Or maybe no,
maybe you wanted to be a poet.

1790
01:23:38,613 --> 01:23:40,638
Maybe you wanted to be
a magician or an artist.

1791
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:42,842
Maybe you just wanted
to travel the world.

1792
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:45,147
Look, I... I... I... I lied to you.

1793
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,753
I lied to all of you,
and I'm sorry.

1794
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:48,311
Dad, especially to you.

1795
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:51,848
But out of that desperation,
something happened
that was so amazing.

1796
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:53,223
Life was full
of possibilities.

1797
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:55,455
A-A-And isn't that what you
ultimately want for us?

1798
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:58,761
As parents, I mean,
is... is that,
is possibilities.

1799
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:03,166
Well, we came here today
to ask for your approval,

1800
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:05,331
and something
just occurred to me.

1801
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,204
I don't give a shit!

1802
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:09,042
Who cares about your approval?

1803
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,908
We don't need your approval
to tell us that
what we did was real.

1804
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,641
'Cause there are so few truths
in this world,

1805
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,342
that when you see one,
you know it.

1806
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:17,112
And I know that it is a truth

1807
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:19,016
that real learning
took place at South Harmon.

1808
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:20,816
Whether you like it or not,
it did.

1809
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,153
'Cause you don't need teachers
or classrooms

1810
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:25,715
or... or fancy
highbrow traditions
or money to really learn.

1811
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:27,921
You just need people
with a desire
to better themselves,

1812
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:30,829
and we got that
by the shitload
at South Harmon.

1813
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:33,299
So you can go ahead,
sign your forms,

1814
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:36,030
reject us and shoot us down,
and do whatever you gotta do.

1815
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:37,833
It doesn't really matter
at this point.

1816
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,203
Because we'll never
stop learning,

1817
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:40,536
and we'll never stop growing,

1818
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:42,872
and we'll never forget
the ideals that were
instilled in us

1819
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:44,172
at our place.

1820
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,712
'Cause we are
S.H.I.T. heads now,

1821
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,304
and we'll be
S.H.I.T. heads forever

1822
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:49,441
and nothing you can say
or do or stamp

1823
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:51,417
can take that away from us!
So go!

1824
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,090
Go ahead!

1825
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:05,226
Everyone,

1826
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,131
please, quiet down.

1827
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,332
Everyone, please
quiet down.

1828
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:11,298
Quiet down. Please.

1829
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:14,605
Thank you.

1830
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,389
Mr. Gaines,

1831
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:34,254
your presentation
was unorthodox,

1832
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:35,759
to say the least,

1833
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,457
and your methodology is

1834
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:39,329
questionable at best.

1835
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,492
However,

1836
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:44,595
the true purpose of education
is to stimulate the creativity

1837
01:25:44,672 --> 01:25:47,004
and the passions
of the student body.

1838
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:49,976
And in that regard
you have certainly succeeded.

1839
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:54,704
This board does not
reject innovation,

1840
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:56,909
but it must be
watched carefully.

1841
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,316
Therefore,

1842
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,114
the South Harmon
Institute of Technology

1843
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:04,352
will be granted a one-year
probationary period

1844
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:07,861
in which to continue
its experimental programs.

1845
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:12,361
Don't be so quick to judge
us by the way we look.

1846
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:14,398
Congratulations.

1847
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:30,950
Mr. Gaines?

1848
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:33,012
Trombone.

1849
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:34,179
What?

1850
01:26:34,255 --> 01:26:36,382
I wanted to play
jazz trombone.

1851
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,660
It's never too late, sir.

1852
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:41,092
Thank you.

1853
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:51,565
Hey.
Hey.

1854
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:53,163
What are you doing here?

1855
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:55,709
I don't know. There were just
a lot of things in my life

1856
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:58,507
that I thought were real
that ended up being fake.

1857
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:01,208
So, why can't the opposite
be true?

1858
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:19,633
This is not your orientation.
This is your disorientation.

1859
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:22,329
You have been orientated
for years.

1860
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:24,530
Don't come up to me, go
"Where am I gonna get that?"

1861
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:27,268
I'm not interested!
You figure it out.

1862
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:29,336
I only wanted
big things for you,
Bartleby.

1863
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,843
I'd say this is pretty big.

1864
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,539
Thanks, Dad.
Ah!

1865
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:34,439
Thanks, Pop.

1866
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:36,483
Okay, honey, I want you
to have a good semester.

1867
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,917
Okay, I will. I love you.
Lizzie, up top.

1868
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,279
Wasn't enthusiastic,
but I'll take it.

1869
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:43,949
And I appreciate the smile.

1870
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:46,391
Schrads!
Hey, no time for chit-chat,
my friend.

1871
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:49,157
I'm teaching "Skepticism 401."
Sha-mon!

1872
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:51,356
At South Harmon,
we like to begin each semester

1873
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:54,799
by clearing our minds
and doing some deep breathing.

1874
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:59,434
I got 85 pork tenderloins with
balsamic vinegar demiglaze.
Ka-blam!

1875
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:02,108
Eddie, we gotta pack
these paninis for Rory's
nature walk.

1876
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:03,370
Pronto!

1877
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:06,236
And someone
get a rabbi down here
to bless this chicken.

1878
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:08,407
Tomorrow we're gonna
go kosher.

1879
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:11,110
South Harmon
actually allowed me
the opportunity

1880
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:12,743
to rediscover my passion
for the arts.

1881
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:15,186
So I urge you guys
to do the same.
Let it come from the heart.

1882
01:28:15,256 --> 01:28:18,020
Let it come from inside.
And... And let the art
speak for itself.

1883
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:19,616
You agree?
Watch... Watch the tip.

1884
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:21,091
Excuse me.

1885
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,322
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1886
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:25,093
If you're gonna take
my picture, you gotta take it
from my good side.

1887
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:26,997
Um, so there wouldn't
happen to be anybody around

1888
01:28:27,068 --> 01:28:29,332
that could show me
to my new dorm room,
would there?

1889
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:32,396
As fate would have it,
I recall your room being
right next to mine.

1890
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:34,031
Really? They're not adjoining
though, right?

1891
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:36,133
Oh, no, no, no.
That would be
totally unacceptable.

1892
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:39,511
And do me a favor.
Enjoy your time here.

1893
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:42,276
You got four years,
these are the best years
of your life.

1894
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:44,113
And then, you're.

1895
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:06,038
I told you.
