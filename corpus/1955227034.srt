it hard when his dog died,

Didn't he?

33
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,001
Well, it wasn't so bad till
he got shot in the head.

who he bought it from?

No, Harry.

us to a blind alley.

in the alley last week.

it's an estate sale,

motivated to move fast.

00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,484
Ah, yes!

190
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:52,285
That's him!

191
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,253
That's him!

192
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,054
Freeze!

193
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,527
So what are all these new clues
the captain was talking about?

194
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,362
Someone found some
hairs under the bed.

195
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,296
Any pictures?

196
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,037
Very nice.

197
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,604
I've got to tell you,
Dick, none of these clues

198
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:12,572
Make any sense to me.

199
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:24,785
300 calories.

200
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,523
Look like you're
losing a few pounds.

201
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,324
Working out?

202
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,659
Not since the incident.

203
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,062
I'll tell you, Harry.

204
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,364
We've been partners,
what, two weeks now?

205
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,399
And I am your best friend.

206
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,768
I've got to tell you...
That was the worst

207
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,770
Thing that ever happened
to anybody, much less

208
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,570
All those nuns.

209
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,973
Oh, it was horrible.

210
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,107
Wife holding up OK?

211
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,210
She committed
suicide last month.

212
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,211
That's right.

213
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,579
I think I read about
that someplace.

214
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,117
How are the kids taking it?

215
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,919
I don't think we had any.

216
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,054
Bates, Smoker.

217
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,990
I want you guys
to know something.

218
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,058
You're the best
officers I ever had.

219
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,027
I love you guys.

220
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,428
Really, I do.

221
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:13,133
But sometimes, you got to get up
off your butts and get out here

222
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,003
And... oh.

223
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:22,910
Needs a little something.

224
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:38,358
Now that's what I
call a cocktail.

225
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,759
You're a good cop, Harry.

226
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,628
A damn good cop.

227
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,530
I've never been closer
with anyone in my life

228
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,464
Than I am with you.

229
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,199
But you've got to
put that family

230
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,268
Tragedy in the past, man.

231
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,204
Concentrate on the future.

232
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,807
You've got so much to live for.

233
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:54,842
How's the wife?

234
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,343
She's dead.

235
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,311
How do you tell the difference?

236
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,080
So what are these new clues?

237
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,949
I got them here somewhere.

238
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,350
Ah, here they are.

239
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,685
Let me see that.

240
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,521
Long, leggy blonde seeks
older, wealthy gent.

241
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,489
Wrong pocket.

242
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,727
We got this out of
Diorama's coat pocket.

243
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:15,996
What is it?

244
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:16,997
Wedding invitation.

245
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:17,797
Let's go.

246
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:20,901
All right!

247
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:21,869
What are you doing?

248
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:22,669
Stake out.

249
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,803
Dick, get the coleslaw.

250
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:24,604
Sorry.

251
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,278
[Tires screeching]

252
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:34,614
Jerk.

253
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,459
Are you with the bride?

254
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,260
No, I'm with Dick.

255
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,195
No, no, no.

256
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,296
For the wedding.

257
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:50,563
Are you on the bride's
side or the groom's?

258
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,365
Who invited Vinny Diorama?

259
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,333
The used car king.

260
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,134
I bought a car from you.

261
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,568
Hey, hey, back off, punk!

262
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,369
So did I!

263
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,774
That's not Vinny.

264
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,076
Vinny is dead.

265
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,777
I feel much better now.

266
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:05,879
Thank you.

267
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:06,679
Walk with me.

268
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:24,932
Where's the booze?

269
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,034
It's flowing like
mud around here.

270
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:33,206
Are you blind?

271
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:42,849
Why is it I always
meet the girl

272
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,418
Of my dreams at her wedding?

273
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,787
You know I met my old
wife at a wedding?

274
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,222
Who was she marrying?

275
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,524
Oh, me, come to think of it.

276
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,426
You know, I read her the
only religious passage

277
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,362
I knew... her Miranda rights.

278
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,998
Boy, our marriage was like
one long conjugal visit.

279
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,233
Take the fucking
rocks out of your ears.

280
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,534
Baby, that's the priest.

281
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,517
[Music playing]

282
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,789
I'm just getting warmed up.

283
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,227
I'm just getting started.

284
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,135
There's fire under that dress.

285
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:38,905
Tits!

286
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,547
I smell turkey.

287
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,858
Lyle designed the wedding cake.

288
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,862
He's an aspiring architect.

289
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,831
It's only a circle.

290
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,066
Yeah.

291
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,402
Well, like I said,
he's perspiring.

292
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,638
By the way, what happens to
that cute guy with the pager?

293
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:12,605
It's about time.

294
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,706
I ordered that drink
a half hour ago.

295
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,542
Get me some h'ordeuvres.

296
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,809
I don't believe we've
been introduced.

297
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,045
I'm...
Harry Bates.

298
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,346
Pleased, detective.

299
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,847
How did you know my...

300
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,715
I was in that 711 that
was getting robbed.

301
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,017
Oh, when I shot
all those people.

302
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:24,951
The first time.

303
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:25,918
Oh.

304
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,787
You know, you're
lucky to be alive.

305
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,056
- Did you ever find the robbers?
- No.

306
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,357
But someone is serving
time, so you can

307
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:31,991
At least be thankful for that.

308
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,493
[Clears throat]

309
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,861
Oh, lozenge?

310
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:35,995
Oh.

311
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,531
I'm sorry, this is my
partner, Dick Smoker.

312
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,468
It was a lovely ceremony,
Mrs. Beaverhyphenshots.

313
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,170
Montana, please.

314
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,473
It was a Montana ceremony,
Mrs. Beaverhyphenshots.

315
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,341
The hyphen is silent.

316
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:49,542
You shouldn't try to hide it.

317
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,178
You should be very proud
to still have your hyphen

318
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:51,978
On your wedding day.

319
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,846
Not many women do.

320
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,482
What brings you
two to my wedding?

321
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:56,449
Not an invitation, certainly.

322
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,618
A car.

323
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,320
Why are you here?

324
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,954
Police business, I'm afraid.

325
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,256
You're afraid of
police business?

326
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,057
But you're detectives.

327
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:08,495
Is this your house?

328
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:09,329
Yes.

329
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,463
How long have you lived here?

330
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,631
Since I moved in.

331
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,266
And what about Lyle?

332
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,701
He came with the place.

333
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,136
Have you known him long?

334
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,171
Well, detective, I've
known men a lot longer.

335
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,038
Oh, really?

336
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:22,942
Men like Vinny Diorama?

337
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:23,743
Sure.

338
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,512
I know Vinny

339
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:26,979
You mean you knew him?

340
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,914
Knew him?

341
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,316
Vinny is dead.

342
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,250
Dead?

343
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,451
That's right, dead.

344
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,652
So why don't you just cut
the crap, get you coat,

345
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,321
Tell your guests goodbye,
come down to the station

346
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,388
And sign a confession.

347
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,725
Do us all a favor.

348
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,628
And if I don't?

349
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,830
Harry will start
shooting your guests.

350
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,066
I'm in a 711 state of mind.

351
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,301
Yeah.
OK.

352
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,269
Let me get my things.

353
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,410
Harry.

354
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,846
This girl is it, I just know it.

355
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:00,780
I'm your biggest fan.

356
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,882
I've had bigger.

357
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,352
So boys, who's
first on the agenda?

358
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,586
Well, let me check my notes.

359
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,259
[Howling]

360
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,631
Mind if I have a candy bar?

361
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,273
There's no eating int
he interrogation room.

362
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,240
So what are you going to do?

363
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,309
Arrest me for chocolate?

364
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,277
Can we do that?

365
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,747
Want some, Harry?

366
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,948
I'm on a diet.

367
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,250
It's got nuts.

368
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,019
And you know how you
like Nuts, Harry.

369
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,989
Because of that trip you took
with your family to the park

370
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:47,194
When you were a small boy,
and a man in a dog costume

371
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:51,264
Offered you a handful of nuts if
you would take him for a walk.

372
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,666
But he got hit by a car.

373
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,134
Didn't he, Harry?

374
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:59,172
Do you remember how sad
you were that day, Harry?

375
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,074
And how your mother
beat you for crying

376
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,910
And took your own
dog to the pound just

377
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,944
To teach you a lesson?

378
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,217
How did you know this?

379
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,318
How does she know this?

380
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,685
Nobody knew about that
dog except my mommy.

381
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:13,520
All right.

382
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,188
Who gave her my personal file?

383
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,356
Could've been anybody, Harry.

384
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,891
You've told everybody
about that damn dog.

385
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,959
That's right, Harry.

386
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,328
And you know everyone
in the department

387
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:22,762
Pretty much despises you.

388
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,498
Would you like to
make love to me, Harry?

389
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:28,067
You've like a virgin
inside, and I'm

390
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,272
Anxious to let go like never
before in wave after wave

391
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,241
Of cascading ecstasy.

392
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,342
Like a waterfall.

393
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,310
God, I've got to take a piss.

394
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,545
No.

395
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:42,982
Like a ship being ripped
broadside by a big torpedo.

396
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,017
Is there anymore of
that candy bar left?

397
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,519
Now, Mrs. Beaver-Shots...

398
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,320
Montana.

399
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,088
Whatever.

400
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,723
Did you kill Vinny Diorama?

401
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,792
Would I be here
if I killed Vinny?

402
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:53,693
Actually, yes.

403
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,462
This is a police
station, and is,

404
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,963
In fact, where we
bring people we

405
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,665
Suspect of committing homicide.

406
00:19:58,765 --> 00:19:59,999
Am I a suspect?

407
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,569
Is the president a pot smoking,
womanizing, draft dodger?

408
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,637
Is a tax hike regressive?

409
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,072
Got another candy bar?

410
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,540
I'm saving it or Harry.

411
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,123
You were seen
with Vinny earlier

412
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,625
At the Heaven's Gate nightclub.

413
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,927
And you were seen with
him entering his house.

414
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,897
A neighbor in a wheelchair saw
you through his rear window

415
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,533
Tie Vinny to the bed
and hack him to bits.

416
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,134
And you were seen
leaving his house

417
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,337
With a blood drenched chainsaw.

418
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:40,206
Now, Mrs. Beaver-Shots, do you
really expect us to believe

419
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,275
You didn't kill Vinny Diorama?

420
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,711
Inquiring minds want to know.

421
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,679
Boy, she's tough.

422
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,180
We've got to release her.

423
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,517
I'll tail her, pump
her for information.

424
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:51,518
Tail her, pump her.

425
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,219
Tail her, pump her.

426
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,722
Tail her, pump her.

427
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:56,756
She's hiding something.

428
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,626
I just know it.

429
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,894
You sure you don't
want any, Harry?

430
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,496
I'm on a diet.

431
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,297
I'm not.

432
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,269
We don't have enough
to hold her, Harry.

433
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,838
You're like a son to me.

434
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,473
Make us proud of you, boy.

435
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:16,376
Not like the last time.

436
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:17,677
Bring back photos.

437
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,146
Why don't you give me
a ride home, Mr. Bates?

438
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,621
Hey.

439
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:29,622
Hi, guy.

440
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:41,568
Oh, hi, guy.

441
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:45,071
Nice seeing you again.

442
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:46,038
Oh, hey.

443
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,039
Oh, thanks, Henry.

444
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,541
I missed you.

445
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,076
I sure did.

446
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:51,444
Well, I guess you
know all the guys.

447
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:52,945
I support my local police.

448
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,447
Oh, that's nice.

449
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,422
Thanks for the ride, Harry.

450
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,428
[Horn honking]

451
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:13,199
FEMALE SPEAKER
(ON INTERCOM): Dr.

452
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,968
Kimball, report to prosthesis.

453
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:20,106
Dr. Fellatio, report to ENT.

454
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:23,410
Dr. Kimball, report
to prosthetics.

455
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,880
Doctors Mclntyre, Pearson, and
[inaudible], report to makeup.

456
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,848
Montana.

457
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:29,782
Montana.

458
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:30,750
Montana.

459
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,152
Can you hear me?

460
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,922
I can't see you.

461
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:36,723
You're all blurry.

462
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,864
That should do it.

463
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,566
How do you feel now,
Mrs. Beaver-Shots?

464
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,137
A little stiff.

465
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:52,104
No, that's me.

466
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,205
MALE SPEAKER (ON
ANSWERING MACHINE):

467
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:56,142
Dr. Lingus, called OB/GYN.

468
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:59,378
Well, looks like we won't
be needing this anymore.

469
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,212
Where am I?

470
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,013
Earth.

471
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,649
Third planet from the sun.

472
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,984
She's worse off than we thought.

473
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,318
What happened?

474
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,920
You were hit by a car.

475
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,989
Driven by your husband.

476
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,791
I was fired.

477
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,660
That's too bad, dear.

478
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,294
We're down to our last $50.

479
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,696
What?

480
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,598
Looks like we're going
to have to go Las Vegas

481
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:21,468
And gamble our entire
life saving so I

482
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,703
Can get enough money
to build a dream house.

483
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,137
That will show the
entire my world

484
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:29,609
I'm not a complete idiot, but
the world's greatest architect!

485
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:30,743
But enough about me.

486
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,011
How do you feel about my plan?

487
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,112
FEMALE SPEAKER
(ON INTERCOM): Dr.

488
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,714
Huxtable, your jello is ready.

489
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:36,348
What's wrong with me, Doctor?

490
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:37,149
Don't tell her.

491
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,384
Don't tell her.

492
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:39,619
Whatever you do, don't tell her.

493
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:42,321
Everything is fine, dear.

494
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,656
Will she be OK?

495
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,324
You mean like
I'm OK, you're OK?

496
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,494
Well, he's a real loser OK?

497
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,629
Hard to tell about
Mrs. Beaver-Shots.

498
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:51,631
We did take some x-rays.

499
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,232
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON
INTERCOM): Dr. Fleischman,

500
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,501
Call your agent.

501
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,702
What's it look like?

502
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:59,606
She's either a Cocker
Spaniel or a blowfish.

503
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:03,643
Either way, it looks like
she swallowed a ball.

504
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,578
Can you take more tests?

505
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,814
I went to medical school
eight years, detective.

506
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,816
I don't need anymore tests.

507
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:10,783
Doctor!

508
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:11,751
Come, quick!

509
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:12,719
In a moment, nurse.

510
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:13,886
In a moment.

511
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,287
Doctor, isn't there
anything else you can do?

512
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,023
Well, I juggle, but I
don't think that's going

513
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,224
To help in this case.

514
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,926
Matter of fact, nothing
is until we find out who's

515
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:21,360
Going to pay our medical bills.

516
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,362
If you don't, Doc, I'd like
to ask Montana a few questions.

517
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,665
And what are you, a
malpractice attorney?

518
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:26,599
Doctor, are you coming?

519
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,600
FEMALE SPEAKER
(ON INTERCOM): Dr.

520
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,702
Green, your codependent jumped.

521
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,303
Now, Montana, back
at the station,

522
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,673
We were discussing
Vinny Diorama.

523
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:35,141
I remember.

524
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,442
You were there.

525
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:37,343
And you were there.

526
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,548
And so were you.

527
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:42,414
That's right.

528
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:43,750
Now, you said you knew him?

529
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,917
Then I said I knew him.

530
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,152
He's dead.

531
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:48,020
He was dead then, too.

532
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,556
How did it happen?

533
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,591
Exploding headache.

534
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,025
Did you know him well?

535
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,728
I bought a car from
him a few weeks ago.

536
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,230
And that's all?

537
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,534
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON INTERCOM):
Dr. Welby, your patient died.

538
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:05,838
Well, yes.

539
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:08,708
That's all.

540
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,242
Are you still in
possession of the car?

541
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,077
No.

542
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,012
Her sister Dakota has the car.

543
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:16,315
My twin half step sister
once removed, actually.

544
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,818
Like we say in the Beaver
house, a horse is a horse.

545
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,486
Of course, of course.

546
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:25,892
Well, where is this twin
half sister twice removed?

547
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:26,893
Thanks, partner.

548
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:27,860
No problem.

549
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,829
Is she single?

550
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,263
She'll be here shortly.

551
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,266
She has an appointment with her
gynecologist this afternoon.

552
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,236
Her schedule has been tight,
but she has a small opening,

553
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,271
So it shouldn't take that long.

554
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,807
My heart, my heart!

555
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:41,808
Oh, no, no.

556
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,209
That's just my pager.
Come on, Dick.

557
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,476
We've got a meeting at 8:00.

558
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,719
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON
INTERCOM): Dr. Quinn,

559
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:53,886
Your show has been cancelled.

560
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:58,457
Dr. Gannon, lose the clogs.

561
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,726
So party 201?

562
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:02,795
Oh, yeah.

563
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,196
- Extras.
- She is.

564
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,031
I'm not.

565
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,866
I'm Dakota, Montana's sister.

566
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:09,335
Her flight came in late today,
wrote me out of the last scene.

567
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,273
[Piano music]

568
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,049
Great play.

569
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,817
William Shakespeare?

570
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,385
Story of my life.

571
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,187
So why are we here, Doctor?

572
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:31,791
Well, that is just truly
remarkable, my good man.

573
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:34,927
All this time, I have
operated under the assumption

574
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,263
That you were an idiot.

575
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:40,332
Yet all the while,
you have contemplated

576
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,569
As have I the age old
questions of human existence.

577
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,740
Where are we going, where are
we from, and why are we here?

578
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,108
Yeah.

579
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,679
Why are we here when I could
be at the monster truck pools.

580
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,714
Well, let me tell
you why we're here.

581
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,983
You see, there's
a little situation

582
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:00,787
Developing here that's turned
out to be a real problem.

583
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:04,056
You don't have any
health insurance.

584
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,858
He's right, Lyle.

585
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,126
What are we going to do?

586
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,129
Well, I could cut off
his head and pickle it,

587
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:13,299
Sell it to the
circus as a sideshow.

588
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:14,967
Don't worry, Montana.

589
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,236
We may not have any
money, but we've got love.

590
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,038
And love is all need.

591
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,873
Love is all you need?

592
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,775
Love is all you need.

593
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,443
Love is all you need.

594
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:25,377
Yeah, she loves you.

595
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,913
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

596
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,347
And I don't care
much for money.

597
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,416
Because money can't buy me love.

598
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:31,550
Look.

599
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,320
I don't want to alarm
you to any great degree,

600
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,755
But I have come
to the conclusion

601
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,589
That you don't have
the money to pay me.

602
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,626
Now, this leaves us with very
few options... one of which,

603
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:42,528
Of course, is a
visit to your house

604
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:47,266
From Dr. D. Dr. Kevorkian.

605
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,234
Oh, Montana.

606
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,869
I'm such a loser.

607
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:51,938
What are we ever going to do?

608
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:55,775
Well, let me throw out this
hypothetical possibility

609
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:59,678
For you which could solve
all your financial problems.

610
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,447
Well, as long as it's decent.

611
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,954
What if I were to present to
you a mutually agreeable sum

612
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:12,825
Of money which would entitle me
to have my way with your wife

613
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,561
For one entire night?

614
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,864
Are you serious?

615
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:18,931
As a heart attack.

616
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:19,799
Lyle, please.

617
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,067
I'm a professional.

618
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,870
I operate under the strictest
code of moral ethics.

619
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:29,075
I was merely presenting to you
a hypothetical situation, a what

620
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:36,182
If, what if, what if, what if.

621
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:37,116
I don't know.

622
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,886
I mean, she is my wife.

623
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:42,654
What's in it for me?

624
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:44,991
60/40 split with the hospital.

625
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:45,958
Come on, Lyle.

626
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:46,893
What do you say?

627
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:47,894
Be a sport.

628
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:49,896
After all, the
kind of money we're

629
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:52,331
Talking about here
if wisely invested

630
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:55,401
Could last a very,
very long time.

631
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,503
Whereas one night of
sex with your wife

632
00:28:57,603 --> 00:29:05,077
Is, after all, one night of
passionate, hot, steamy sex

633
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:08,680
With your wife.

634
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:10,482
I get the 60?

635
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,650
All right, Lyle.

636
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,052
You drive a hard bargain.

637
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:16,055
50-50 and I'll even bring
her back with her clothes

638
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,958
On having eaten breakfast.

639
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:19,826
Can I watch?

640
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:23,095
I like to watch.

641
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:26,432
Beggars can not be voyeurs.

642
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:28,367
I don't know.

643
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:29,836
It might ruin our relationship.

644
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:31,237
Oh, come on, kid.

645
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:34,640
A healthy sexual congress
between two consenting adults

646
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,579
Is a profoundly beautiful
movie experience.

647
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,449
Provided, of course,
the husband of one

648
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:44,917
Is not a down-on-his-luck
architect

649
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:48,087
With the brain of a gnat.

650
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:51,423
OK, but only if Montana agrees.

651
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,063
You really mean it, Lyle?

652
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:58,164
Oh, I do love you.

653
00:29:58,264 --> 00:29:59,431
And we do need the money.

654
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,868
And it was you who ran
me over with the car.

655
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,870
I promise you I
won't enjoy it, OK?

656
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,872
And I'll think of
you the whole time.

657
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:08,274
Now, just take your time.

658
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:09,741
I'll do it.

659
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:10,809
Nobody is forcing you.

660
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,178
I'll do it.

661
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:14,146
Whatever you decide,
it's OK with me.

662
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:16,448
I'll do it.

663
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,985
So we got a deal.

664
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:20,186
No so fast.

665
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:22,554
Neumeyer, Montana's agent.

666
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,956
An agent?

667
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,757
Just need to iron out
a few particulars here.

668
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:28,494
No big deal.

669
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:29,628
Whoa.

670
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:32,431
Now Doc, are we talking
basic one night stand,

671
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,066
Or are we talking series here?

672
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,001
No, no.

673
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,335
I'm just thinking
a little music,

674
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,404
A little more
candlelights, and heavy

675
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,638
Foreplay, and a lot of sex.

676
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:40,606
Great, Doc.

677
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:41,773
You do know foreplay
is extra, right?

678
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:42,641
No way.

679
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,176
It's part of the deal.
Oh, no.

680
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,044
It's always extra.

681
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:46,212
We got a deal?

682
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:47,213
How much?

683
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:54,153
A million bucks.

684
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:55,187
A million bucks!

685
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,156
I don't carry that
kind of cash around.

686
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,891
Well, what sort of figure
do you have in mind?

687
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,592
Well, let's see
what I have here.

688
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,097
All right.

689
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,398
$38.

690
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,500
Half a mil, take
it or leave it.

691
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,809
OK, OK, you can have $58.

692
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,212
100 grand, and that's
as low as I'll go.

693
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:25,952
All right, all right. $68.52.

694
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:26,752
Deal.

695
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,496
It was the best I could do.

696
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,801
He was ruthless.

697
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,003
But we'll get him on the sequel.

698
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:49,541
TV REPORTER: Still no break from
the serial chainsaw murders.

699
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,945
Police are baffled by
the rash of homicides.

700
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:58,884
And police spokesman Dick
Smoker had only this to say.

701
00:31:58,985 --> 00:31:59,851
Harry!

702
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:00,852
Harry!

703
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,721
Would you like to
give a statement?

704
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:10,462
We are conducting an
ongoing investigation.

705
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:11,697
That's right.

706
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:18,070
There is no suspect in
police custody at this time.

707
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,939
No further comment.

708
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,409
All right, back off!

709
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,410
Back off!

710
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,417
That's right.

711
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:34,220
The complete set of fortune
cookies and [inaudible]

712
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,323
Are just in $19.95 this hour.

713
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:38,857
Coming up, we have a...

714
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,092
My friend, you're
probably wondering

715
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,793
How to become rich like Don Wu.

716
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,862
Well, my friend, I'll tell you...
There are three letter words.

717
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,297
Three letter words that
make you successful

718
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,466
Like Don Wu, my friend.

719
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,801
Sell your family.

720
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:50,936
When I first come
to this country,

721
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:52,438
I have 50 brother and
sister, my friend.

722
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,473
I sell them all off for
scientific experiments,

723
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,575
And I'm able to
profit, profit, profit.

724
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,011
I'm able to [inaudible]
bikini [inaudible] and bimbos.

725
00:32:59,111 --> 00:32:59,978
Of course, they're beautiful.

726
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,347
I paid top dollar for them.

727
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:02,681
Yeah.

728
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:03,415
When I first come to this
country, people tell me, Don,

729
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:04,250
You're crazy, man.

730
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,051
Look at you.

731
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:05,984
You're a poor immigrant.

732
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,353
You don't speak
English very well.

733
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,488
You've got beady little eyes.

734
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,590
You've got big fat lip, and
you're obnoxious asshole.

735
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,892
I tell them to fuck off.

736
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,394
That's two word, my friend.
Yeah.

737
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,063
You know why the reason
why they say those things?

738
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:19,931
You want to know why they
talk like that to Don Wu?

739
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:22,168
You have to come to the seminar.

740
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,203
Welcome to another
episode of "Incredibly"

741
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:25,737
Unbelievable Ideas."

742
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,106
I'm your host Marty Haskle.

743
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,308
And you know, folks,
I've seen a lot

744
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:31,510
Of incredible, unbelievable
ideas in my time.

745
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,713
But today, we are going to
meet the man who has cornered

746
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,782
The market on bad taste.

747
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:39,685
Ladies and gents, I
give you Lyle Shots.

748
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:50,196
Hi, Lyle, and welcome
to "Incredibly"

749
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:51,630
Unbelievable Ideas,"
the show where

750
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,099
People buy almost anything.

751
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,033
[Applause]

752
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,638
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give a big,

753
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:03,008
Incredibly unbelievable welcome
to Montana Beaver-Shots.

754
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:04,943
[Applause]

755
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,449
So Lyle, tell me...
How do you intend

756
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,252
To get these good but
simple people to part

757
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:14,986
With their hard-earned money?

758
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,455
Isn't my wife beautiful?

759
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,257
She's lovely, yes.

760
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:20,292
She's the kind of woman
that men dream about when

761
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,493
Their wives turn them down.

762
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,195
Audience, let me ask
you... how much would

763
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:24,730
You pay to sleep with my wife?

764
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,465
$1 million?

765
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,566
Sure, if you're a billionaire.

766
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,935
But most of us don't
have that kind of money.

767
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,504
Am I right?

768
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,606
So how much would you pay?

769
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,708
Half a million, $100,000?

770
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:37,943
If you smoke Cuban cigars.

771
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:40,946
But I don't, and neither do you.

772
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,349
Montana, show these
people what you can do.

773
00:34:58,564 --> 00:34:59,765
So what do you think, folks?

774
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:01,300
$149?

775
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,203
You could buy a nice
set of knives or maybe

776
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:05,904
A food dehydrator for that.

777
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:07,639
But let me tell you something.

778
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,342
Right now, it's not
going to cost you that.

779
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,511
It's not going to cost
you the price of the two

780
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:16,582
Carat diamonique or
the unbelievable Engine

781
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:19,418
Attitude and car wax.

782
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,086
This stuff really works.

783
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:23,455
Or the Amazing Oven.

784
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:24,856
That's right, men.

785
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,393
Right now, and for
a limited time only,

786
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:29,461
If you call the
number on your screen,

787
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:31,330
You can sleep with my wife.

788
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,464
That's right.

789
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,666
You can commit adultery
with a beautiful woman

790
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:39,505
For the incredibly low
TV offer price of $59.95.

791
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,807
Offer not available
where prohibited by law.

792
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,409
So what are you waiting for?

793
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:46,778
Call 1-900-DO-MY-WIFE.

794
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,615
That's 1-900-DO-MY-WIFE.

795
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:52,584
Call now before he
comes to his senses.

796
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,153
Operators are standing by
right now to take your call.

797
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:56,622
And so am I.

798
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:59,057
[Applause]

799
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:05,931
[Knocking]

800
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,233
Who is it?

801
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,734
FEMALE SPEAKER: A free gift
for the lady of the house,

802
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,803
Courtesy of Growgaine,
makers of Woman Oxodile,

803
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,505
A revolutionary new
product that gives

804
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,641
Every woman that big hair look.

805
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:17,276
Free gift, come on in.

806
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,557
There is no lady of
the house, is there?

807
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:32,758
She died recently.

808
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,393
That's what I heard.

809
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:35,727
You pushed her over the edge.

810
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,697
I read about it
in the newspaper.

811
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:43,469
Oh, where did this dog...
Oh, what a friendly dog.

812
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:51,310
Gee whiz, you must be allergic.

813
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,478
Hey, hey, hey...
Come on, come on.

814
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:53,845
Leave her alone.
Leave her alone.

815
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:54,846
Get back to your corner.

816
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:55,747
Hey, lay down.

817
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:56,515
Lay down.

818
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:57,349
Here.

819
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:58,149
Try this.

820
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,088
That stuff really works.

821
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:03,889
What is it?

822
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:04,690
[Inaudible] spray.

823
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,610
You must be a lonely guy.

824
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,645
I like my privacy.

825
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,847
Looks like you get
a lot of it, too.

826
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,882
Why are you trying
to nail my sister?

827
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,551
Only if she leaves her husband.

828
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:35,020
I'm talking about the murder.

829
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,254
What do you know about that?

830
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:38,990
There's more than
one way to skin a cat.

831
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,191
Sharp knife works best.

832
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,260
Especially around the paws.

833
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:43,228
I get the picture.

834
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:44,162
Look straight at the camera.

835
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:44,963
Don't smile, Ms. Beaver.

836
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:48,567
Where's Montana?

837
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:49,968
She's with my psychiatrist.

838
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:52,538
They're having an affair.

839
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:56,174
So do you think I'm pretty?

840
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,477
Sure, you're pretty.

841
00:37:58,577 --> 00:37:59,778
I'm not too fat, am I?

842
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,947
Of course not.

843
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,415
You like my hair?

844
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,385
It's... big.

845
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,987
If there's anything
you'd change about me,

846
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:10,456
What would it be?

847
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:11,457
Well...

848
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:12,257
Go ahead.

849
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:14,493
You can tell me.

850
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:17,563
You have such
beautiful blonde hair.

851
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:19,531
Why [inaudible]?

852
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,500
Montana killed our
parents, you know.

853
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,969
She said to meet her at a
bar called Heaven's Gate.

854
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:25,537
She's crazy.

855
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,139
Why are you seeing
a psychiatrist?

856
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,541
I'm not.

857
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,476
You said you were.

858
00:38:30,576 --> 00:38:31,276
I was.

859
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:33,111
But I'm better now.

860
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:34,580
I can see that.

861
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,483
I hate her.

862
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:40,051
Let's make love.

863
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,019
Oh, Harry.

864
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,020
I want you.

865
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,857
What's the name of
your psychiatrist?

866
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,292
Dr. Hasselblad.

867
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:48,760
Whoa, look at the time.

868
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,795
Got to go.

869
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:52,931
I'll tell you what...
You feed the dog,

870
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,800
And I'll be back Wednesday.

871
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,208
Well, I think it
actually started

872
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,510
With my great great grandfather.

873
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,978
He was a shipbuilder.

874
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,146
He built the Titanic.

875
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,916
And well, it really
wasn't his fault. I mean,

876
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,851
Who would have figured there
would've been an iceberg

877
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,119
Out there?

878
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,587
What do you want on your pizza?

879
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:16,922
Sausage and pepperoni?

880
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:21,259
I think last year when I got
the job with the LA County,

881
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,461
I was...
Hi, Captain.

882
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:23,595
Yeah, this is Jerry.

883
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,263
I'd like a sausage and
pepperoni pizza, please.

884
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,565
I don't know the address.

885
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,567
Just trace the call.

886
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:31,069
So I understand you're
the Beaver's psychiatrist.

887
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,638
Why do you ask?

888
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:34,673
Just answer the question.

889
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:36,675
Funny you should say that.

890
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:39,077
Well, we can take it
downtown if you'd like.

891
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:39,945
Is that so?

892
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:40,746
Yeah.

893
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:41,547
Damn right.

894
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:43,348
I've got a gun.

895
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:45,183
How does that make you feel?

896
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:46,051
Empowered.

897
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:48,353
Breakaway overpasses.

898
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:49,488
Put them ll around LA.

899
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:50,856
It's a great idea.

900
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,624
Do you have health insurance?

901
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:53,759
As a matter of fact...

902
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:54,560
Oh, no.

903
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,994
We're talking about you.

904
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,362
Oh.

905
00:39:57,463 --> 00:39:59,531
I have a degree from Harvard.

906
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:01,800
I did my graduate work at Yale.

907
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,303
I completed a six-month course
of psychiatric study in Vienna.

908
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,472
Oh, I love those
little sausages.

909
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,841
I served out my
residency at Walter Reed,

910
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:13,044
And then was an intern
at John Hopkins.

911
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:17,916
I'm licensed to practice
medicine in 16 states.

912
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,985
I serve on the
board of directors

913
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,954
For four major hospitals.

914
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:25,924
I teach psychiatry UCSF.

915
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:30,562
I have a thriving private
practice with 7,000 patients.

916
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:33,364
Does that include
suicide victims?

917
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:35,667
I was Mr. Universe twice.

918
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,403
My daugther sells more
cookies than anyone

919
00:40:38,504 --> 00:40:40,071
In her girl scouts troop.

920
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:43,809
And I completed three fire
arcs with Tony Robbins.

921
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:47,479
In short, Mr. Bates, I am god.

922
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:48,346
Amen.

923
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,348
Now about Dakota Beaver.

924
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,416
What about her?

925
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:53,384
Is she homicidal?

926
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:54,319
Like her sister?

927
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:55,320
Of course not.

928
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,723
What about her?

929
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:01,459
Her sister... what
pictures I have of her.

930
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,494
All in here, you understand.

931
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,967
Do you sleep with my patients?

932
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:13,404
Or they're personal friends
or close relatives, Mr. Bates?

933
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,306
How do you know my name?

934
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,176
Montana talked about you.

935
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,145
She has a very
rich fantasy life,

936
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:23,715
And you figure most
prominently in it.

937
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,417
Please go on.

938
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:28,053
I can tell you nothing
that would violate

939
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,055
The patient's confidentiality.

940
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:33,725
Even if I threatened
to shoot you?

941
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,160
What do you want to know?

942
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,764
Why don't you tell me
more about Montana Dakota?

943
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:41,600
Mr. Bates.

944
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,704
As you surely realize by
now, there's only one.

945
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:50,676
Montana and Dakota are actually
a third person we call Amanda.

946
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:52,778
She doesn't really exist.

947
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:59,350
She suffers from multiple,
multiple personality disorder.

948
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,920
How many personalities?

949
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,888
More than a handful.

950
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:03,722
Ah, of course.

951
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,423
What a waste.

952
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,093
Have you seen them both?

953
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,561
I am her doctor.

954
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:11,529
They look completely different.

955
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,967
But I have never seen them
together in the same room.

956
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,803
That is the key to
the whole mystery.

957
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:20,371
What are you, nuts?

958
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,707
Why do you ask?

959
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:22,507
Oh, I don't know.

960
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:25,110
Just a feeling I have.

961
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,580
Try to get in touch
with your feelings.

962
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,015
I've said too much.

963
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:30,816
I'm not a therapist.

964
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,050
I'm a psychiatrist.

965
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,984
I shouldn't do this.

966
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:38,657
So what about Dakota?

967
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:40,191
You want to sleep with one?

968
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:46,131
Sleep Montana, not her sister.

969
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,132
Why?

970
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:50,235
She's got bigger tits, stupid.

971
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:52,103
Boy, this has been real fun.

972
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:55,440
That's my dream... an
inverted pyramid put on end,

973
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,208
Sort of wobbly, back and forth.

974
00:42:57,308 --> 00:43:00,245
If I could just figure out
how to get the damn thing

975
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:02,648
From falling over.

976
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:04,282
Time's up.

977
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:06,785
I will see you next week.

978
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:08,086
We are making progress.

979
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:09,314
What's a four letter word
for woman that ends in UNT?

980
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:11,516
Aunt, A-U-N-T.

981
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:12,317
That works.

982
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:13,551
Got an eraser?

983
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,320
What can I get you today, boys?

984
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,388
No boys for me today, thanks.

985
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,924
- Dick?
- Got one.

986
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:19,758
Harry?

987
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:20,792
Not today.

988
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:22,527
So what did you find
with that address?

989
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:24,730
Well, found a house.

990
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:25,997
I knew it!

991
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:28,533
This is the break we need!

992
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:31,870
What are you looking at?

993
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,973
You think the house had anything
to do with these murders?

994
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:36,708
Off the record?

995
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:39,110
Sure.

996
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,446
I don't think the house
had anything to do with it.

997
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:42,280
Why?

998
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,581
Houses don't kill people, Cap.

999
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,382
People kill people.

1000
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:46,117
But god damn it, boy.

1001
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:47,585
People live in houses!

1002
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,887
Animals kill people, too.

1003
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:50,155
Dick is right.

1004
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:51,322
Look at Katherine the Great.

1005
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,391
She was killed by
a horse, you know.

1006
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:54,425
Oh, Lorena.

1007
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,460
Hot dog.

1008
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,795
[Inaudible] with
a rope coming down,

1009
00:44:56,895 --> 00:44:59,430
And he caught around the
horse's tail and yanked it up

1010
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:04,335
In the air and came
down and... [inaudible]

1011
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,171
Reminds me of an idea.

1012
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:07,105
All right, all right, fine.

1013
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,173
What do we do now?

1014
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:10,475
Well, last night, I
sat down and mapped out

1015
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:13,178
The exact location of
each of these murders.

1016
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:14,279
What did you find?

1017
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,782
Well, Harry, I found
out I'm a lonely man.

1018
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:19,050
A lonely, lonely man.

1019
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:19,851
And the map?

1020
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:20,986
I've got it at home.

1021
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:22,720
Come on by if you want
to have a look at it.

1022
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:24,222
Whoa, look at the time.

1023
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:25,056
We'll be in touch.

1024
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:26,057
Well, it's pretty interesting.

1025
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:26,958
I'm sure it is.

1026
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:33,031
[Phone ringing]

1027
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:33,865
Hello?

1028
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,433
I was just thinking about you.

1029
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:36,534
What are you doing?

1030
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:38,369
What are you wearing?

1031
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:39,404
Why don't you come on over?

1032
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:41,639
I've got a new 45
I want you to hear.

1033
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,774
Get a day job.

1034
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:46,477
Official business.

1035
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,278
Police dispatch.

1036
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,956
Got it.
Game's afoot.

1037
00:45:58,056 --> 00:45:58,890
There's been another murder.

1038
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:09,634
What is this?

1039
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:11,069
Come on, move it!

1040
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:12,503
Get out of the way!

1041
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,772
Don't play with radio, Dick.

1042
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:16,241
Oh, that's it.

1043
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:22,113
I'll teach this
clown how to drive.

1044
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:26,651
Oh, fuck you.

1045
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:32,390
You know something?

1046
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,424
I really like this girl.

1047
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,260
Gee, I hope she's
not a mass murderer.

1048
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,764
I think we could settle down
and live happily ever after.

1049
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:41,166
20 years there.

1050
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:46,704
20 years on the force, and all
I got was this stupid T-shirt.

1051
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,173
Dahmer, time of death?

1052
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:49,374
4:57 PM.

1053
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:00,151
Good morning, captain.

1054
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:00,952
Oh, Patricia.

1055
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:02,720
Glad you're here.

1056
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,456
Dick, Harry, this
is Dr. Patricia

1057
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,058
Martin, the department...

1058
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,894
Department psychologist.

1059
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:10,295
What are you doing here?

1060
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:11,696
Here's my suspect's shrink.

1061
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:13,531
It's good to see
you again, Harry.

1062
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,633
The pleasure's all mine.

1063
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,035
It always was.

1064
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:19,237
So where's the body?

1065
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,705
Oh, in my trunk, right
where you left it.

1066
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:22,073
I meant Dr. Hasselblad.

1067
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,174
He's in there.

1068
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:26,077
The priest is administering
the last rights.

1069
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:37,388
So what do you think?

1070
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:39,857
Multiple murders like
this are very rare.

1071
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,059
Why?

1072
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:44,162
Well, for one thing, they
don't happen very often.

1073
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:45,897
[Inaudible] damn luck.

1074
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:47,665
Cause been established?

1075
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:49,100
Well, here's what
I think happened.

1076
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:54,005
First, they did this.

1077
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,011
Then, after about a
minute, they switched.

1078
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:02,013
She used her body as a weapon.

1079
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:03,781
Oh boy.

1080
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,383
That's right.

1081
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:07,252
How are you feeling, Harry?

1082
00:48:07,352 --> 00:48:08,186
A little tired.

1083
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:11,056
The constant
bouncing of lush, ripe

1084
00:48:11,156 --> 00:48:12,991
Breasts against
his sternum started

1085
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,459
His heart beating irregularly.

1086
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,894
Combine that with
high blood pressure.

1087
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:21,766
She broke his little
heart in a million pieces.

1088
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:25,503
Then she chopped him up.

1089
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,205
Look.

1090
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:28,873
I want to show you something.
You don't need to.

1091
00:48:28,974 --> 00:48:29,941
That's fine.
Over here.

1092
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:35,446
Stay away from
that woman, Harry.

1093
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:36,247
She's dangerous.

1094
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:37,215
I don't know.

1095
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:39,184
She seems perfectly
normal to me.

1096
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:41,519
She is suffering from
a very rare condition.

1097
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:42,487
How rare?

1098
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,522
She's the only one who has it.

1099
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:45,890
It?

1100
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:50,028
Your killer is suffering from
Patricia syndrome by proxy.

1101
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:51,396
Patricia syndrome?

1102
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:54,432
Sometimes, women who
are named Patricia only

1103
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,634
Want to be called Patricia.

1104
00:48:56,734 --> 00:49:01,339
Not Pat, Trish, or even Patty...
Which in comparison to others

1105
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,374
Really isn't so bad.

1106
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:07,345
My father called me that,
and look how I turned out.

1107
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:12,217
Now, when a Patricia is called
anything other than a Patricia,

1108
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:16,221
Most of them will simply correct
the person who was at fault

1109
00:49:16,321 --> 00:49:18,156
And go about their daily lives.

1110
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:21,592
But when a woman is suffering
from Patricia syndrome,

1111
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:26,497
She can experience periods
of uncontrollable anger.

1112
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:28,466
And hack people to
death with chainsaws?

1113
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:31,436
Exactly.

1114
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:33,871
Are you sure?

1115
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,206
No sweat.

1116
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:36,574
Well, that's all fine
and dandy, Doctor,

1117
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:38,943
But you're forgetting
one important thing.

1118
00:49:39,044 --> 00:49:41,079
None of our suspects
are named Patricia.

1119
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:42,447
I know.

1120
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:45,216
That's why this woman is
suffering from the Patricia

1121
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,717
Syndrome by proxy.

1122
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,187
Patricia syndrome by proxy.

1123
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:50,455
Right.

1124
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:53,324
I'm guessing that at one
time, our killer knew someone

1125
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:55,060
By the name of Patricia.

1126
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,728
Perhaps she had a
fixation on her.

1127
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:01,066
Perhaps they were intimate.

1128
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,033
How intimate?

1129
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:10,741
We both picked the same numbers
and won the lottery once.

1130
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,744
And when we went down
to pick up our prize,

1131
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,514
She developed this
really big crush on me.

1132
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:18,883
And we became lovers.

1133
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:21,252
Look, it was only once,
and I didn't enjoy it.

1134
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,787
Yeah, right.

1135
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:25,256
She used to walk up
and down the street

1136
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,426
Saying my name... Patricia.

1137
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:29,994
You wouldn't be interested
in getting together

1138
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:31,796
With her again with me there?

1139
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:34,432
Or me?

1140
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:37,235
Have you come across
any other signs which

1141
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:40,405
You might consider unusual?

1142
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:47,478
Well, one of our boys at
the crime lab found this.

1143
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:50,014
But that's as far as he went.

1144
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:51,282
I see.

1145
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,051
All the other victims were
found with a green scarf?

1146
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:55,253
That's very good.

1147
00:50:55,353 --> 00:50:58,223
So if the doctor's body
has a green scarf with it,

1148
00:50:58,323 --> 00:51:01,659
Then the Patricia syndrome
by proxy is all it could be.

1149
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,861
That will kill the smell.

1150
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,996
Here, you my need this.

1151
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:06,797
Thank you.

1152
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:15,540
That's got bite.

1153
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,341
Here you go, Dick.

1154
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:22,947
[Inaudible].

1155
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:25,650
Sorry, Captain, that's mine.

1156
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,017
Well...

1157
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:30,421
The victim has been dismembered
except for the extremities.

1158
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:31,922
No sign of struggle.

1159
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,924
Victim wore polyester.

1160
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,394
Victim never asked
for directions.

1161
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:38,396
Victim was afraid of commitment.

1162
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:41,366
Victim put his inner
child up for adoption.

1163
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:43,868
Victim thought foreplay
was a golf tournament.

1164
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:46,337
Victim left the toilet seat up.

1165
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,307
Nothing else seems peculiar.

1166
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:51,842
Stop.

1167
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,010
What is it?

1168
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,412
There's something in his mouth.

1169
00:51:54,512 --> 00:51:56,347
Tweezers.

1170
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,148
Tweezers.

1171
00:51:57,248 --> 00:51:58,048
I'll take those.

1172
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:07,958
Gold.

1173
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:11,562
Wait, there's something else.

1174
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:19,304
I guess that's just the tongue.

1175
00:52:19,404 --> 00:52:20,104
Well, wait.

1176
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,863
[Phone ringing]

1177
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:49,434
Hi, Mr. Bates.

1178
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:50,701
This is Marty Hascal.

1179
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,036
How you doing?

1180
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:54,104
I'm calling for the
county firefighters.

1181
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:56,106
As you might already know,
it's that time of year

1182
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:58,543
Again when the firefighters
have to swallow

1183
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:01,379
Their pride a little bit
and ask for your support.

1184
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:03,681
This year's benefit show
will be Pozzy Traction,

1185
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:06,984
The exciting heavy metal
band from San Francisco,

1186
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:09,687
Including some clowns and
jugglers for the opening act.

1187
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:13,458
Your tax deductible contribution
will be greatly appreciated

1188
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:17,194
For only $20, you can take
your entire family out and see

1189
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:18,796
The fun and entertainment.

1190
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:21,165
Or you can sponsor
some disadvantaged kids

1191
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:23,133
To go in your place.

1192
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:23,934
OK.

1193
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,035
So let me get this straight.

1194
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:26,604
I give you $20, and
you give me a picture

1195
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,805
Of the junkie I'm supporting.

1196
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:29,073
Oh, sounds good.

1197
00:53:29,173 --> 00:53:32,076
So someone's going to come
by and pick up the check?

1198
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:33,411
Cash?

1199
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:35,313
Leave it under the doormat
and we'll pick it up tonight.

1200
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:36,113
Pick up the cash, OK.

1201
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,315
And you are?

1202
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:38,349
Mr. Smith.

1203
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:39,450
Thanks for your support.

1204
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,251
OK.

1205
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:41,519
Well, thank you.
All right.

1206
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:42,353
Bye bye.

1207
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:48,493
Where is Dr. Hasselblad?

1208
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:49,694
He's dead, Dakota.

1209
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:50,861
Your doctor is dead.

1210
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:51,662
I know.

1211
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:53,664
It's just getting better.

1212
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:56,667
So you want to make love?

1213
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,404
Hi.

1214
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,606
I've been waiting here
all by my lonesome.

1215
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:36,407
Can I come in?

1216
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,169
Where's your sister?

1217
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:06,036
What sister?

1218
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:06,837
Dakota.

1219
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:08,873
Dakota?

1220
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:11,409
I have a sister named Dakota?

1221
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:14,979
That's news to me, not
to mention my parents,

1222
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,747
My real sister, Patricia.

1223
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:20,951
Well, your parents died in
a horrible fiery plane crash

1224
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:28,459
And Patricia is the psychologist
who won the lottery.

1225
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,395
Dakota told you that?

1226
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:32,363
She's such a kidder.

1227
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:33,964
What else did Dakota tell you?

1228
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,634
That you were sleeping
with her psychiatrist.

1229
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:38,002
He's dead.

1230
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:40,337
Let me fix you a drink.

1231
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,039
Do you think I killed him?

1232
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:49,814
I don't really know
you all that well.

1233
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:51,849
Would you like to get to
know me better, Mr. Bates?

1234
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:58,623
I'd like that.

1235
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:00,124
Hungry?

1236
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:01,125
Uh huh.

1237
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:07,998
Is that man dead?

1238
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:08,799
That's no man.

1239
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:10,435
That's my husband.

1240
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:11,802
He's just resting.

1241
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:14,405
He looks dead.

1242
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:15,205
No.

1243
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,807
He's asleep.

1244
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:19,977
He's been working
very hard lately.

1245
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:22,012
His eyes are open.

1246
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:25,049
Those are contacts.

1247
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:28,018
He's got a knife
sticking out of his chest.

1248
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,855
He's just trying
to get attention.

1249
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:32,523
Ignore him, please.

1250
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:34,992
I think I better
go have a look.

1251
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:42,366
You know, I just love all these
police things you do, Harry.

1252
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:44,301
I want you so much.

1253
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,270
This is all wrong, though.

1254
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,974
I mean, you're a cop and
I'm the prime suspect

1255
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:53,310
In six murder cases.

1256
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,713
Three.

1257
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:58,449
Yeah, I just had a premonition.

1258
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:01,819
You know, this just isn't
going to work, Harry.

1259
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,788
I mean, I'm looking for
a long term relationship

1260
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:05,956
In this stage of my life.

1261
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:09,494
And I get the feeling that
you're not ready for that kind

1262
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:11,028
Of commitment.

1263
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:12,897
Can I ask you a question, Harry?
Sure.

1264
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:14,298
Do you want children?
[phone ringing]

1265
00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:15,265
Of course I want...

1266
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,702
Excuse me.

1267
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:19,637
Hello?

1268
00:57:19,737 --> 00:57:21,572
Yes.

1269
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:23,373
You know, I'm sorry
to cut this short.

1270
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:24,975
But I'm the prize in
the church raffle,

1271
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:26,577
And a gorgeous young
billionaire just won me.

1272
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:27,377
See ya later.

1273
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:35,586
MALE SPEAKER: Nicole, tell
the waiter to get me one

1274
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:38,623
Of those big ass steak knives.

1275
00:57:38,723 --> 00:57:40,825
We were heating up like
two poodles in a microwave.

1276
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:43,227
But Montana had to do
her part for charity.

1277
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:44,595
What a gal.

1278
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:47,431
She's as honorable as my true
blue steadfast partner Dick.

1279
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,525
Dick, you've got class.

1280
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:16,426
Would you like another banana?

1281
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:18,829
I mean, Harry is
just donut chops.

1282
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:20,464
But you...

1283
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:22,800
How is the world's
greatest detective?

1284
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,670
Well, Harry and I
are just friends.

1285
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:28,505
I mean, we have
this understanding.

1286
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:31,642
You look great in black.

1287
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:33,077
I'm in mourning.

1288
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:37,582
Why does everybody have to die?

1289
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:44,388
Everybody around me is dead.

1290
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:45,355
All dead.

1291
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:06,977
I think somebody's
about to page me.

1292
00:59:07,077 --> 00:59:08,445
I really should be by a phone.

1293
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,347
I knew a guy once.

1294
00:59:10,447 --> 00:59:12,650
He drove a rental car
through a crowded bus stop

1295
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:18,188
And killed 16 people
just for kicks.

1296
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,189
I find that fascinating.

1297
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,925
Don't you?

1298
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:22,727
People can be very
hard on rental cars.

1299
00:59:22,827 --> 00:59:23,761
Now, if you'll just excuse me...

1300
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:24,561
No!

1301
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:27,431
Don't go.

1302
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:28,565
I find you very stimulating.

1303
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:29,867
- Why me?
- Why not?

1304
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:30,901
You must get it all over town.

1305
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,837
Well, it's not
that I'm deprived,

1306
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:34,839
But that I'm terribly depraved.

1307
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:36,006
I don't know.

1308
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:38,375
Harry is my best friend.

1309
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:43,013
But even I don't
like him very much.

1310
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:44,081
I went out looking for Montana.

1311
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:48,418
She wasn't at my
neighbor's apartment.

1312
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:52,890
[Screaming]

1313
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:00,865
Where's my damn dog?

1314
01:00:00,965 --> 01:00:03,300
Someone stop the dog.

1315
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,268
Oh, sorry.

1316
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:06,436
Neighborhood watch,
ever vigilant.

1317
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,939
I'll be back.

1318
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,408
[Dog barking]

1319
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:13,878
[Gunshot]

1320
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:37,935
You're out of control, Harry.

1321
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:40,337
You've got some
jelly on your face.

1322
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:42,172
Rice cake?

1323
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:42,973
No thanks.

1324
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:44,108
Did I miss anything?

1325
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:44,909
Just another homicide.

1326
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:49,680
Oh.

1327
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,981
Hey, you rough night?

1328
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:57,755
Oh, send this tool
sample to the lab.

1329
01:00:57,855 --> 01:00:58,789
What you got there, Dahmer?

1330
01:00:58,889 --> 01:00:59,690
Murder weapon.

1331
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,191
You get any lately, Harry?

1332
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,374
Lost a few pounds.

1333
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:22,512
Dahmer.

1334
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,849
Take this to the
lab for prints.

1335
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:26,316
Where's the suspect, Harry?

1336
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:29,353
It's time we picked
her up for questioning.

1337
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:31,555
Can't let her do it.

1338
01:01:31,655 --> 01:01:32,857
I can't let her go
through with it.

1339
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:33,824
I love her, Dick.

1340
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:34,591
You hear me?

1341
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,726
I love her.

1342
01:01:35,826 --> 01:01:36,693
Were you talking to me?

1343
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:39,063
Were you talking to me?

1344
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:41,966
No.

1345
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:43,433
I think it's time we
filled in the captain.

1346
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,369
Good.
Let's do that.

1347
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:47,371
Dog gone that hay fever.

1348
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:58,682
You what?

1349
01:01:58,783 --> 01:02:01,151
Captain, if you'll
just let me explain...

1350
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:04,054
Explain?

1351
01:02:04,154 --> 01:02:05,689
How do you explain this?

1352
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:08,692
I told you already,
there was nowhere else.

1353
01:02:08,793 --> 01:02:10,560
So you take my parking spot.

1354
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,096
You got some nerve, Bates!

1355
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:14,799
Will you forget about
the parking spot already?

1356
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:16,433
Now, what are we going
to do about Montana?

1357
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:17,467
What's to do?

1358
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,836
We're placing her
under surveillance.

1359
01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:19,636
Surveillance?

1360
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,604
Yeah, he's leaving now.

1361
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:22,206
Good luck, Surveillance.

1362
01:02:22,306 --> 01:02:23,007
Thank you.

1363
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:39,957
Speak of the devil.

1364
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:00,310
Hi there.

1365
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,778
How are you doing?

1366
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:02,746
What do you want?

1367
01:03:02,847 --> 01:03:03,747
You.

1368
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:04,949
What?

1369
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:06,817
I think that we should
settle down, buy a house,

1370
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:08,652
Make little rugrats.

1371
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:09,586
Right.

1372
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:11,455
Seriously.

1373
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:14,591
I think we could
have great kids.

1374
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:15,926
I want to have three.

1375
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:17,928
See, that way, if one turns
out gay, you can disown him,

1376
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:19,496
And you won't be left
with an only child.

1377
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:21,065
So what's a
substantive guy like you

1378
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:24,068
Doing in a place
like this, anyway?

1379
01:03:24,168 --> 01:03:25,903
Montana left me.

1380
01:03:26,003 --> 01:03:27,304
Do you like these shoes?

1381
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:28,738
Sure, they're nice.

1382
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:30,740
Do you think my
feet are too big?

1383
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:31,741
No.

1384
01:03:31,842 --> 01:03:33,710
Do my ankles seem fat to you?

1385
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:34,845
Of course not.

1386
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:37,147
Let's get takeout and
go back to your place.

1387
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:39,183
Do you believe in past lives?

1388
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:41,451
In my last one, I was a tarp.

1389
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:42,786
That's great.

1390
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:46,590
Let's get a bottle of wine
and go back to your place.

1391
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:50,394
You ever wanted to fire your
gun in a credit school yard?

1392
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:52,362
I love kids.

1393
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:57,567
Why don't we get some
oil and plastic sheet

1394
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,136
And go back to your place?

1395
01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:04,208
I'm hearing voices, and
they're telling me to kill you.

1396
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:05,409
Look at the time.

1397
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:09,346
Let's rent a movie and
go back to your place.

1398
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:10,814
Have you seen this one?

1399
01:04:10,915 --> 01:04:13,617
You know, I investigated the
mysterious death of a critic

1400
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:14,751
Who gave a bad review.

1401
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,520
We found him with two
thumbs stuck up his ass.

1402
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:29,166
I can't seem to get
them back together.

1403
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:35,339
I'm hungry.

1404
01:04:35,439 --> 01:04:36,706
Me, too.

1405
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:40,077
Want me to call for a pizza?

1406
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:43,480
Stay in bed all day.

1407
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,783
Have... have you
ever been married?

1408
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,618
Yeah, just once.

1409
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,387
But not for very long.

1410
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,690
What happened?

1411
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:56,693
There were a few problems
we couldn't seem to work out.

1412
01:04:56,793 --> 01:04:57,494
Like what?

1413
01:05:02,933 --> 01:05:06,436
Well, [inaudible] down
on the southbound train,

1414
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:09,306
Leaving Boston at 4:00 o'clock,
and I hopped on a bus heading

1415
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:10,774
East at 55 miles an hour...

1416
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:12,676
I... I get the point.

1417
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:19,383
He died from eating
poison mushrooms.

1418
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:21,251
That's interesting.

1419
01:05:21,351 --> 01:05:24,054
So what do you
want on the pizza?

1420
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:24,854
Mushrooms.

1421
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:25,855
But just on half.

1422
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:26,623
You got it.

1423
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,504
[Makes beeping noise]

1424
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,811
[Burp]

1425
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:52,249
[Burp]

1426
01:06:22,846 --> 01:06:24,714
Don't make a move.

1427
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:25,782
What are you doing here?

1428
01:06:25,882 --> 01:06:26,783
I'm a cop.

1429
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:28,185
My badge is in my pocket.

1430
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:30,354
[Gunshot]

1431
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:32,089
That was wonderful.

1432
01:06:32,189 --> 01:06:32,956
DICK: Harry.

1433
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:34,724
I love a good pizza.

1434
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:39,796
DICK: If you could call
911, I'd appreciate it.

1435
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:40,997
Will you marry me?

1436
01:06:41,098 --> 01:06:43,067
DICK: The phone is
on the night stand.

1437
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:43,867
When?

1438
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:44,668
DICK: Harry?

1439
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:45,869
How about right now?

1440
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:47,071
I know a delivery man
for a Chinese restaurant.

1441
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:48,105
He's also a Buddhist priest.

1442
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:48,905
DICK: Harry?

1443
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,107
But I don't you, Harry.

1444
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:51,441
No.

1445
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:55,011
But I've got a dead wife, and
you've got a dead husband,

1446
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:57,914
And we both shop at Kmart.

1447
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,350
So what do you say?

1448
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:01,585
I don't want to, Harry.

1449
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:02,952
Why not?

1450
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:04,721
Because I like you.

1451
01:07:04,821 --> 01:07:07,557
Well, I like you, too.

1452
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:09,025
I love you, Dakota.

1453
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:10,960
And I don't want to see you
end up dead like everyone

1454
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:12,462
Else in my life.

1455
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:14,698
I'll get a bulletproof vest.

1456
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:18,902
You don't have to go through
that much trouble, Harry.

1457
01:07:19,002 --> 01:07:21,037
Tell me something.

1458
01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:23,773
How much life
insurance do you carry?

1459
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,710
$10,000, $15,000
through the force.

1460
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,145
That's not very much.

1461
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:29,713
I can get more.

1462
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:30,780
On a cop's salary?

1463
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,715
I make tons of money.

1464
01:07:31,815 --> 01:07:33,883
I'm on the take.

1465
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:35,185
The answer is yes, Harry.

1466
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:36,820
I'll marry you.

1467
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,821
This calls for a celebration.

1468
01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:38,955
You like Chinese food?

1469
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,890
Love it!

1470
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,493
And they lived
happily ever after.

1471
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:45,595
Dakota, you're so beautiful.

1472
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:47,697
I'd marry you even
if you were stupid.

1473
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,733
Boy, you turn me on.

1474
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:59,042
Oh no.

1475
01:07:59,143 --> 01:08:00,477
Ow!

1476
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,246
Ow!

1477
01:08:02,346 --> 01:08:03,613
Pain!

1478
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:05,315
You can stop any time now.

1479
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:06,716
That's fine!

1480
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:07,517
Oh boy.

1481
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:08,752
Oh wow.

1482
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:11,121
What's first aid for burns?

1483
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:12,989
What, butter?

1484
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,725
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1485
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:16,560
OK.

1486
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:17,361
That's fine.

1487
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:18,628
That's good!

1488
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:23,300
If you could just... ow...
With that, I'd appreciate it.

1489
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,235
[Screaming]

1490
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:30,707
OK, everyone.

1491
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:32,609
Get them up.

1492
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:33,443
Hands only, please.

1493
01:08:36,413 --> 01:08:37,614
Take a look at this one.

1494
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:39,883
Don't you look just
like Harry Bates?

1495
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:41,185
Sure does.

1496
01:08:41,285 --> 01:08:42,586
Go ahead, make the bed.

1497
01:08:42,686 --> 01:08:45,155
You're both under arrest.

1498
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:47,391
What's the charge?

1499
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:48,192
Murder.

1500
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:50,194
He doesn't look dead to me.

1501
01:08:50,294 --> 01:08:52,496
What about this stiff
in the other room?

1502
01:08:52,596 --> 01:08:53,463
Stiff?

1503
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:54,898
In the other room?

1504
01:08:54,998 --> 01:08:56,366
That's right.

1505
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,368
Some hysterical woman
started calling 911,

1506
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,370
And the dispatcher said
that there was a murder,

1507
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,771
And the body was
right next door.

1508
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:03,607
And here we are.

1509
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:05,575
And there you are.

1510
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:06,843
Found the victim's wallet yet?

1511
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:11,415
Here's the suspect.

1512
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:12,216
What do you know?

1513
01:09:12,316 --> 01:09:13,383
He stole Harry's wallet.

1514
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:24,361
So which one of you is
the cunning little runt?

1515
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:27,130
Bates, quit clowning around
and get back to work.

1516
01:09:27,231 --> 01:09:28,332
Who has the victim's wallet?

1517
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:36,640
Bates?

1518
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:39,676
You're out of uniform, Mister.

1519
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:41,978
I oughta kick your ass.

1520
01:09:49,386 --> 01:09:50,954
You'll have to
come with me, Miss.

1521
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:51,888
Where?

1522
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:53,557
We're going to
take you downtown.

1523
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:55,825
Gonna ask you a few questions.

1524
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,527
Do you get along
with your mother?

1525
01:09:57,627 --> 01:09:59,696
She died in a
fiery plane crash.

1526
01:09:59,796 --> 01:10:02,131
Oh boy.

1527
01:10:02,232 --> 01:10:04,968
Harry, I don't
want to go downtown.

1528
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:06,436
Well, you have to, miss.

1529
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:07,371
I'll go with you.

1530
01:10:07,471 --> 01:10:09,673
Oh, thank you, Harry.

1531
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:10,907
I got to be at work, anyway.

1532
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:16,112
HARRY (VOICEOVER):
After the bars closed,

1533
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,615
The captain decided it was
time to take Dakota in.

1534
01:11:05,495 --> 01:11:08,264
No smoking in the
interrogation room.

1535
01:11:08,365 --> 01:11:09,899
So what are you going to do?

1536
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:10,834
Arrest me for smoking?

1537
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:16,205
Want a hit?

1538
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:18,742
It makes me hungry.

1539
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:20,143
Too bad

1540
01:11:20,243 --> 01:11:35,725
Did you kill... hey,
that's pretty good.

1541
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,093
I can get you some.

1542
01:11:37,193 --> 01:11:42,666
So did you kill that guy... that
dead guy at the crime scene?

1543
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:45,168
What was his name?

1544
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:47,837
Did somebody write
down his name?

1545
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:49,272
Mondale wrote it down.

1546
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:56,513
Did you kill that guy...
The guy at the crime

1547
01:11:56,613 --> 01:11:57,914
Scene, the dead one.

1548
01:11:58,014 --> 01:11:59,416
What was his name?

1549
01:11:59,516 --> 01:12:00,550
Did somebody get his name?

1550
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:01,518
Somebody write his name down?

1551
01:12:11,395 --> 01:12:12,228
It's a boy!

1552
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,029
Congratulations!

1553
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,003
Now that's interesting.

1554
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:27,777
Would you like to go
for a cup of cappuccino

1555
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:30,680
After this ordeal is over?

1556
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,148
Just can't take it anymore.

1557
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:42,426
HARRY (VOICEOVER): I tried
to squeeze off a few rounds,

1558
01:12:42,526 --> 01:12:44,428
But someone was
kidnapping Dakota.

1559
01:12:44,528 --> 01:12:45,629
Wait, come back!

1560
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:47,063
HARRY (VOICEOVER): After
the last parade shootout,

1561
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:49,165
Internal Affairs told me not
to kill anymore bystanders.

1562
01:12:49,265 --> 01:12:50,434
So I took off after her.

1563
01:12:50,534 --> 01:12:51,501
Him.
Her.

1564
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:52,301
Oh, whatever.

1565
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:05,782
Yeah, you want to watch, right?

1566
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:06,683
Well, watch this.

1567
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:31,107
Mom?

1568
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:32,041
Harry!

1569
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,042
What are you doing here?

1570
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:35,344
You know what kind
of place this is?

1571
01:13:35,445 --> 01:13:37,246
What if dad finds out?

1572
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:38,615
Harry.

1573
01:13:38,715 --> 01:13:42,285
There's something we both wanted
to tell you for a long time.

1574
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:45,288
Harry, your father is gay.

1575
01:13:45,388 --> 01:13:46,089
Come on, Mom.

1576
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:47,090
Let's go.

1577
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:57,567
Sis?

1578
01:13:57,667 --> 01:13:59,536
Harry, what are you doing here?

1579
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:08,712
Ms. Landers, my
third grade teacher?

1580
01:14:08,812 --> 01:14:09,679
A man!

1581
01:14:27,564 --> 01:14:28,998
HARRY (VOICEOVER): I had
no motive, no suspect,

1582
01:14:29,098 --> 01:14:32,368
And the dead bodies were piling
up like Presto [inaudible].

1583
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,469
Another one.

1584
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:34,704
They were everywhere.

1585
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,472
And all I had for my efforts
was a splitting headache

1586
01:14:36,573 --> 01:14:37,641
And the knowledge
that I, too, came

1587
01:14:37,741 --> 01:14:39,342
From a dysfunctional family.

1588
01:14:39,442 --> 01:14:40,243
Hmm.

1589
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:41,310
Does that one still wet the bed?

1590
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:44,413
Dakota.

1591
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:45,682
Whoa, Dakota.

1592
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:48,852
Half man, half... well,
actually, all man in a dress.

1593
01:14:48,952 --> 01:14:51,220
We kissed.

1594
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,488
I hope Dakota was OK.

1595
01:14:52,589 --> 01:14:54,591
Well, I didn't really care
what happened to Dakota.

1596
01:14:54,691 --> 01:14:56,693
In fact, I hoped the kidnappers
poked him in the head

1597
01:14:56,793 --> 01:14:57,794
With a sharp stick.

1598
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,410
Get back in here if you ever
want to see Dakota alive again.

1599
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,478
I can't her you.

1600
01:15:15,579 --> 01:15:16,713
I said get back in
here if you ever want...

1601
01:15:16,813 --> 01:15:18,014
Not listening.
Can't hear you.

1602
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:18,948
Not listening.

1603
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:19,783
Can't hear a thing.

1604
01:15:19,883 --> 01:15:20,617
No.

1605
01:15:20,717 --> 01:15:21,751
I missed you, Harry.

1606
01:15:29,559 --> 01:15:30,526
Look at me, Harry.

1607
01:15:33,496 --> 01:15:37,734
How do I know it's real?

1608
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:41,605
That's what it's
all about, Harry.

1609
01:15:41,705 --> 01:15:46,209
When we were little kids,
Dakota used to steal my dolls.

1610
01:15:46,309 --> 01:15:49,045
But then when we got
older, she started

1611
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:54,918
Stealing my clothes,
purses, shoes, makeup,

1612
01:15:55,018 --> 01:15:57,486
My boyfriends, even my husband.

1613
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:05,428
And then when he stole you,
Harry, what was a girl to do?

1614
01:16:05,528 --> 01:16:06,663
You didn't kill him?

1615
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:07,463
No.

1616
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,766
But I wanted to.

1617
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:13,703
I cut his credit cards in
half and messed up his hair.

1618
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:15,972
And then I let him go in the
woman's department at Kmart.

1619
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,941
No.

1620
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:19,408
I'll take you to him
if you want me to.

1621
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:45,568
[Honking]

1622
01:16:45,669 --> 01:16:46,703
[Screaming]

1623
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,492
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER): Let
us examine the mating ritual

1624
01:17:09,592 --> 01:17:12,461
Of the North American
heterosexual.

1625
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:18,401
It begins with chase,
followed by a series of leaps

1626
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:24,273
And bounds, culminating
in the mediocre impression

1627
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,209
Of a modern airplane.

1628
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:29,145
Truly a wondrous
sight to behold.

1629
01:17:35,618 --> 01:17:36,552
Would you like some wine?

1630
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,021
I would love some wind.

1631
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:38,822
What kind is it?

1632
01:17:38,922 --> 01:17:39,655
Red.

1633
01:17:39,756 --> 01:17:41,691
I meant what... oh, forget it.

1634
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:43,092
How about some lobster?

1635
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:44,393
What about your diet?

1636
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,729
Forget the diet.

1637
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:52,135
Oh, let me tell you.

1638
01:17:55,204 --> 01:17:59,042
You know, Harry, I've really
never seen you eat before.

1639
01:17:59,142 --> 01:18:02,578
You know, being
with you, I'm happy.

1640
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:03,546
I can be myself.

1641
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:04,748
I don't have to
hold anything back.

1642
01:18:04,848 --> 01:18:06,249
You know, and it's
all because of you.

1643
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:09,385
Well, you know, Harry, I'm
really not the easiest person

1644
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:10,754
In the word to get along with.

1645
01:18:10,854 --> 01:18:11,821
Oh, sure you are.

1646
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:15,091
Could you pass me
that coleslaw, please?

1647
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,593
You know, I'm the type
of woman who gets upset

1648
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,963
Over the slightest things.

1649
01:18:20,063 --> 01:18:21,697
Oh.

1650
01:18:21,798 --> 01:18:24,801
Would you like some
watermelon, Harry?

1651
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:25,869
Oh, look... a squirrel.

1652
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:29,899
OK.

1653
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:32,535
I'll be right back.

1654
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:33,336
Goodbye.

1655
01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:41,310
I'm off to join the
merchant marines.

1656
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:42,745
[Gunshot]

1657
01:19:42,846 --> 01:19:44,647
HARRY (VOICEOVER):
A shot rang out.

1658
01:19:44,747 --> 01:19:46,082
But the producers
were out of money,

1659
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:47,516
So it wasn't very convincing.

1660
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:55,024
Look what I got you from
the store, Angelkins.

1661
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,893
[Gunshot]

1662
01:19:56,993 --> 01:20:01,264
Oh, oh, oh!

1663
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:07,036
What was that noise?

1664
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:07,837
Gunshots?

1665
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:14,177
My dog shot these two women.

1666
01:20:14,277 --> 01:20:14,978
How awful.

1667
01:20:15,078 --> 01:20:16,112
Yeah.

1668
01:20:16,212 --> 01:20:17,813
What's your name?

1669
01:20:17,914 --> 01:20:18,614
Harry.

1670
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:20,216
Harry, I'm a producer.

1671
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:21,650
I make movies.

1672
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,419
But not for HBO.

1673
01:20:23,519 --> 01:20:24,620
Maybe you've heard of them.

1674
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,488
"Drive Through Slaughter."

1675
01:20:25,588 --> 01:20:26,755
Yeah.

1676
01:20:26,856 --> 01:20:28,757
"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,
the Story of Ted Bundy."

1677
01:20:28,858 --> 01:20:29,692
Yeah.

1678
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:31,895
And my triumph,
"Midwife Crisis."

1679
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:33,462
Oh, I loved that one.

1680
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:34,330
It was a 3D spectacular.

1681
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:35,664
I know, I know.

1682
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:37,266
But enough about me.

1683
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:39,468
Let's talk about
you and your future.

1684
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:42,038
I walk in here, you're
tied to the bed.

1685
01:20:42,138 --> 01:20:43,072
There's bodies on the bed.

1686
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:43,873
True.

1687
01:20:43,973 --> 01:20:45,141
And a homicidal pet.

1688
01:20:45,241 --> 01:20:46,542
Got me there.

1689
01:20:46,642 --> 01:20:50,279
I'll give you $500,000 for your
life story, Harry, right now.

1690
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:51,080
Great.

1691
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,350
Could you untie me first?

1692
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,819
(SINGING) For he's
a jolly good fellow,

1693
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:03,626
For he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow.

1694
01:21:03,726 --> 01:21:05,128
Fuck it.

1695
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:07,030
What are you going to do
with the money, Harry?

1696
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:09,298
Well, it was a difficult
decision to make.

1697
01:21:09,398 --> 01:21:12,335
On the one hand, Montana
needs a very expensive brain

1698
01:21:12,435 --> 01:21:14,870
Surgery to be like the
way she was before she

1699
01:21:14,971 --> 01:21:16,339
Got shot in the head.

1700
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:18,741
But it's been a long time
since I've taken a vacation.

1701
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:21,477
So tomorrow, we're flying off
to see the running of the bulls.

1702
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:55,211
Whoa, 30 seconds.

1703
01:21:55,311 --> 01:21:57,580
New record.

1704
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,681
Where are you going?

1705
01:21:58,781 --> 01:22:00,683
I thought I would make
us something to eat.

1706
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:29,012
Is everything OK?

1707
01:22:29,112 --> 01:22:31,514
[Glass breaking]

1708
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:38,954
What are you doing here?

1709
01:22:51,034 --> 01:22:53,236
HARRY (ON ANSWERING
MACHING): Dakota, it's Harry.

1710
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:54,070
Are you there?

1711
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:57,740
Pick up the phone, you freak.

1712
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,408
Anyway, I'm marrying Montana.

1713
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:01,077
But you know something, Dakota?

1714
01:23:01,177 --> 01:23:04,880
Whenever I think about you and
those special times we had,

1715
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:09,385
I just want to... [gags]

1716
01:23:19,128 --> 01:23:21,497
Oh, Montana.

1717
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:23,832
I looked all my life
for someone like you,

1718
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:26,001
And you're finally
right next to me.

1719
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:27,470
It's like a dream come true.

1720
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:39,882
I'm finally off to join
the Merchant Marines.

1721
01:23:39,982 --> 01:23:40,683
Montana.

1722
01:23:40,783 --> 01:23:43,519
What a hairy back you have.

1723
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:45,020
Oh no!

1724
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:50,626
No!

1725
01:23:50,726 --> 01:23:51,427
Don't worry.

1726
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:52,528
That's my service revolver.

1727
01:23:52,628 --> 01:23:53,362
I never keep it loaded.

1728
01:23:58,201 --> 01:23:59,102
Whoops.

1729
01:23:59,202 --> 01:24:00,803
[Knocking]

1730
01:24:00,903 --> 01:24:01,604
DICK: Harry.

1731
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:02,605
It's me, Dick.

1732
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:05,074
I've got great news.

1733
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:06,575
[Knocking]

1734
01:24:06,675 --> 01:24:10,546
I know you're in here.

1735
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:11,780
Duck!

1736
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,715
Yeah.

1737
01:24:12,815 --> 01:24:14,983
I brought you a
housewarming gift.

1738
01:24:15,084 --> 01:24:17,720
I'm really happy for you, Harry.

1739
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:18,587
I thought you were dead.

1740
01:24:18,687 --> 01:24:19,388
Yeah.

1741
01:24:19,488 --> 01:24:21,157
So did Siskel and Ebert.

1742
01:24:21,257 --> 01:24:22,858
But after we became partners,
I went out and bought

1743
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:24,393
Myself a bulletproof vest.

1744
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:26,262
I'm with Internal Affairs.

1745
01:24:26,362 --> 01:24:28,164
We thought you
were Dirty, Harry.

1746
01:24:28,264 --> 01:24:29,465
Can we get back to the killer?

1747
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:30,966
You were a prime
suspect, Harry.

1748
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,335
Who would have
thought the killer

1749
01:24:32,435 --> 01:24:36,672
Was a psychotic, loved-obsessed
transvestite fixated on you?

1750
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:39,175
You haven't seen anyone around
here matching that description,

1751
01:24:39,275 --> 01:24:39,975
Have you?

1752
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,043
Like the captain?

1753
01:24:41,144 --> 01:24:42,345
Yeah, he's OK.

1754
01:24:42,445 --> 01:24:44,147
Drinks a little too much,
but all in all, a good cop.

1755
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:45,481
Why do you ask?

1756
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:48,517
Because he's standing right
behind you in a mini skirt.

1757
01:24:52,488 --> 01:24:53,856
Hello, Dick.

1758
01:24:53,956 --> 01:24:55,791
Please tell me
you're Uncle Keller.

1759
01:24:55,891 --> 01:24:56,759
Goodbye, Dick.

1760
01:25:00,296 --> 01:25:02,030
So how do you like
the neighborhood?

1761
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:02,998
It's OK.

1762
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,468
A little quiet.

1763
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:08,637
[Inaudible] panty liner.

1764
01:25:08,737 --> 01:25:10,139
[Inaudible], Captain.

1765
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,381
Wow.

1766
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,983
Is this your car?

1767
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:55,884
Hey.

1768
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,186
Go ahead.

1769
01:25:57,286 --> 01:25:58,053
You drive.

1770
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:58,854
Really?

1771
01:26:07,563 --> 01:26:09,932
HARRY: You know, I
was just thinking.

1772
01:26:10,032 --> 01:26:12,034
How would you look in
a blonde wig, Dick?

1773
01:26:12,134 --> 01:26:13,402
You know, Dakota left
some of her dresses

1774
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:14,537
Over at my apartment.

1775
01:26:14,637 --> 01:26:15,938
You're about the same size.

1776
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:18,274
Why don't you come on
by and try them on?

1777
01:26:18,374 --> 01:26:19,208
We've got time to kill.

1778
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:20,509
DICK: What are
you talking about?

1779
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:21,477
HARRY: What are you, kidding?

1780
01:26:21,577 --> 01:26:22,411
Those legs are gorgeous.

1781
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,379
DICK: Take your
hand off my knee.

1782
01:26:23,479 --> 01:26:25,113
HARRY: Hey...
DICK: Emergency.

1783
01:26:25,214 --> 01:26:26,382
Emergency.

1784
01:26:26,482 --> 01:26:28,150
Officer needs assistance.

1785
01:26:28,251 --> 01:26:29,518
HARRY: Tell them to
bring more handcuffs.

1786
01:26:29,618 --> 01:26:30,619
DICK: Get out.

1787
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:31,920
Pull over right now
and get out of my car.

1788
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,323
HARRY: Gee, I don't handle
rejection very well, Dick.

1789
01:26:34,423 --> 01:26:35,424
DICK: Just get out of my car.

1790
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:36,692
HARRY: The car is moving, Dick.

1791
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:37,493
DICK: Great.

1792
01:26:37,593 --> 01:26:38,327
Get out anyway.

1793
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:39,895
Here, I'll get the door for you.

1794
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:41,564
HARRY: You know, I'm
detecting a lot of hostility.

1795
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,466
You should get in touch
with your feminine side.

1796
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:45,368
DICK: I'll give you something
to get in touch with.

1797
01:26:45,468 --> 01:26:47,336
Let me show you
a new choke hold.

1798
01:26:47,436 --> 01:26:48,504
HARRY: Stop it!

1799
01:26:48,604 --> 01:26:49,538
DICK: You look cold.

1800
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:50,773
How about a traffic
flare up your ass?

1801
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:57,145
Gee, haven't used
my taser in a while.

1802
01:26:57,246 --> 01:26:59,114
Your breath reeks.

1803
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,049
Look, pepper spray.

1804
