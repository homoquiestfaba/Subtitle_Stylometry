1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,211
I-I want to be an actress,
but soon as I tell my parents

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,171
that they're just gonna
yank my ass back home.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:08,257
Don't tell them and come to
the "Locked" audition with me.

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,760
<i>Previously on "Famous in Love..."</i>

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,637
This is Paige Townsend.

6
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:15,033
I can't believe I'm saying this

7
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:17,155
but did we just find our August?

8
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,329
You're into him, he's into you, too.

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,206
So do something about it.

10
00:00:21,207 --> 00:00:24,251
We should talk about
this after your play.

11
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:25,836
Can we just pretend you're behind us?

12
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:26,920
The real story isn't about Rainer.

13
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:28,130
It's about Tangey Turner.

14
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:31,175
That slut who cheated on
my son with Jordan Wilder.

15
00:00:33,346 --> 00:00:36,230
Paige, I wanted to call you personally.

16
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:39,160
You got the part.

17
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:52,821
Aren't you headed to
the studio this morning?

18
00:00:52,822 --> 00:00:55,031
I am, but I need to
finish my spreadsheet

19
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:56,324
before my parents get here later.

20
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:57,993
Paige, it's not like you're telling them

21
00:00:57,994 --> 00:00:59,327
you're becoming a sister-wife.

22
00:00:59,328 --> 00:01:01,913
You landed the lead in a huge movie.

23
00:01:01,914 --> 00:01:03,582
- How mad can they get?
- My dad's a teacher.

24
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,709
And education means everything to him.

25
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,461
If I drop out, I'll be the first person

26
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:09,421
in my family to not
get a college degree.

27
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:12,132
So... that mess of
numbers is your big plan?

28
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,593
Yes, my dad's mantra
is numbers don't lie.

29
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:16,219
So this is how I prove to him

30
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,889
that I can still be in
school and do the movie.

31
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:23,018
Oh, uh, I've got Bio,
but I'll be back later

32
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,186
to help you guys clean the apartment.

33
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:25,228
- Thanks.
- Well.

34
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,021
Get this place in shape

35
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:27,189
before your parents get here.

36
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,899
I thought Bio was on Tuesdays.

37
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,319
Did I say "Bio?" Slap
me awake. I meant Psych.

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,768
Well, good luck at your
scary producer meeting.

39
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:37,199
- Love you.
- Love you more.

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,451
Any idea why Nina wants to see you?

41
00:01:39,452 --> 00:01:41,161
Well, I mean, it can't be to fire me.

42
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:42,671
I haven't even done anything yet.

43
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:45,207
Do you wanna have coffee after?

44
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:49,252
Actually, I got a call from
that agent who read my script.

45
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:50,295
No way!

46
00:01:50,296 --> 00:01:51,713
And he wants to have a meeting.

47
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:53,715
- Why didn't you tell us?
- It's just a meeting.

48
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:55,175
I'm not letting you downplay this.

49
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:57,762
Just having somebody like
that read your script is...

50
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,226
... really...

51
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:05,008
awesome.

52
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:10,607
We should have that talk, you know.

53
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:13,109
The, the talk that we've been
talking about, talking about

54
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,321
but we still haven't actually
talked about it? That-that talk.

55
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:18,448
I think it's a little scary how I can

56
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:20,117
interpret your "Paige speak."

57
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,701
But, yeah, I do know.

58
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:25,081
We'll talk about it later, okay?

59
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:28,937
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

60
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,350
Well, I hate to think what would happen

61
00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:47,228
if anyone ever found out about us.

62
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:51,165
We're two adults, there's nothing
wrong with what we're doing.

63
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,025
It's a little bit wrong.

64
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:55,486
But isn't that...

65
00:02:56,612 --> 00:02:58,072
...part of the fun?

66
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:05,161
And I wonder what
Hollywood mega producer...

67
00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:06,497
You sure you gotta go to work?

68
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,376
My insider tells me that Rainer Devon

69
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:13,129
and Jordan Wilder feud...

70
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:16,715
That little vulva promised me.

71
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:19,175
And the mystery slut is mega pop star

72
00:03:19,176 --> 00:03:22,220
and Rainer's girlfriend, Tangey Turner.

73
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:24,180
What? No. How did he find out?

74
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:26,182
My secret source also revealed

75
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:27,976
that Jordan only had good intentions

76
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:29,978
when he checked in on
his best friend's girl.

77
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,604
But after he had too much to drink

78
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:33,648
Tangey turned on her sultry charm

79
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:36,109
and poor Jordan couldn't resist her.

80
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,194
That's not what happened.
Who told him that?

81
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:40,196
Tangey must've confided in someone.

82
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:41,990
You know we hooked up, but
it didn't go down like that.

83
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:43,242
We weren't even drinking.

84
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,629
Good morning! Hi, I'm Paige Townsen.

85
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,006
There's no D in the end.

86
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:00,467
- Do you have a drive on, miss?
- I should and, uh...

87
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:02,693
You can just call me Paige, uh...

88
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,804
Roberto.

89
00:04:04,805 --> 00:04:07,349
Anyways, uh, I'm gonna be
coming in and out of here a lot

90
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,435
so, you know, we could
be on a first-name basis.

91
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,253
We're all on the same team, right?

92
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:14,176
Photo ID, please.

93
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:18,027
Oh. Uh, uh. Yeah, of course. Sure.

94
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:21,638
Where's my driver's license?

95
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:24,075
Oh, there you go.

96
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:26,701
That's a school ID card.

97
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:29,079
I'll need a valid driver's license.

98
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,084
Um, oh, come on, look at that face.

99
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:35,960
Don't you just wanna let me in?

100
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:38,880
You're gonna need to make a
U-turn and exit immediately.

101
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:42,592
Uh, n-no, sorry, I can't.
No, no. Uh, hold on.

102
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:44,928
I'll find it, let me find
it. I know I have it in here.

103
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:46,227
It's just...

104
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:48,723
- I really need to be...
- Security One.

105
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:51,393
I have to be in Nina
Devon's office in two minutes

106
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:53,353
and it's my first day,
so I can't be late...

107
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:54,522
Good morning.

108
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:58,499
- Hi.
- Everything okay?

109
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:01,277
- Not really.
- You know her, Mr. Devon?

110
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:02,897
This is Paige Townsen.

111
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:04,988
She's gonna be a big star.

112
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:09,203
Whatever you say, boss.

113
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:12,171
Thank you.

114
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:20,423
Would you please stop?

115
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:25,301
There's a lot riding on
tomorrow night's casting party.

116
00:05:25,302 --> 00:05:27,387
We're over budget, and for
now, the studio's looking

117
00:05:27,388 --> 00:05:30,140
the other way, but I, I can't
have you going off on Hopper.

118
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:31,433
And I can't have the
world hating on Tangey

119
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:32,475
for something we both did.

120
00:05:32,476 --> 00:05:34,635
I get it, I'll fix it.

121
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,596
Now, just relax.

122
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,307
You know that I've invested
everything in "Locked."

123
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,699
And you know how much I
need this movie to work.

124
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,627
- Right?
- Of course.

125
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:53,246
So, stay away from Rainer and Barrett

126
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:55,749
until I get a chance
to work this out and...

127
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,875
Don't talk to Tangey until I can
smooth things over with her manager.

128
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:11,431
Did I ask you to set
that meeting for tomorrow?

129
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:12,766
- No, but...
- There's that word again.

130
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:16,361
I pay you so I can hear "Yes.
Nina, yes. I made it happen."

131
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:18,207
Sit, sit.

132
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:22,358
Well, that's what an Ivy League
education buys you these days.

133
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,694
"No, but..."

134
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,111
How's it going?

135
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:29,407
- I'm a little nervous.
- Do you wanna see a doctor?

136
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:31,307
We could get you on a mood stabilizer.

137
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:33,203
Have you been to see Giselle?

138
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:34,412
What're you wearing tomorrow night?

139
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:37,540
Actually I'm meeting up with
her later this afternoon.

140
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,918
She, uh, she sounds nice.

141
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,169
Oh, she's a back-stabbing bitch

142
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,838
but she's the best stylist in town.

143
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,549
By the way, Nina, I-I
really wanna thank you again

144
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,427
for letting me bring my friends
to the party tomorrow night.

145
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:50,970
- Are you excited?
- Totally.

146
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:53,473
You know, I just, I have this class

147
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:55,391
and I'm gonna miss it,
so I kinda feel bad.

148
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:58,394
But it's okay, 'cause I'm gonna
get notes from somebody there.

149
00:06:58,395 --> 00:07:00,186
I assumed you were taking a gap year.

150
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:04,067
Uh, of course not. I can do
the movie and stay in school.

151
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:06,528
I mean, it is an ensemble piece,
just like the books, right?

152
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,489
So, I won't be working every day.

153
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:11,407
We're playing up the love triangle.

154
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:13,618
So the role of August is much bigger

155
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:15,516
in the movies than she was in the books.

156
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:17,012
Look.

157
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,459
Being a movie star isn't
a part-time job, Paige.

158
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,752
You have to make a choice.

159
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:25,004
Either you eat, sleep
and breath "Locked"

160
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:27,423
or, or you spend the rest
of your life doing math

161
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:29,230
in a poly-blend sweater set.

162
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:35,808
Any chance you can come
over more than once a week?

163
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:39,736
It's just that I have school.

164
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:41,496
I'll pay you an extra fifty.

165
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,483
Um, yeah, yeah, okay.

166
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:47,068
I-I can make it work.

167
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,905
Great. Look forward to it.

168
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,754
Just let yourself out.

169
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:12,553
Oh, uh, I think you
accidentally blocked me in.

170
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,119
Oh, my God.

171
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:18,174
Alexis Glenn?

172
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:22,812
Wow, I-I never miss an
episode of "Backsplash."

173
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:24,564
Becky Barnes's, my absolute hero.

174
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:26,649
Yeah, she was America's sweetheart.

175
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,526
Uh, who am I making this out to?

176
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:31,279
Thank you. Um, Paige Townsen.

177
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,084
There's-there's no D on the end.

178
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:36,024
Paige Townsen? You're the new...

179
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:38,328
You're the new lead in "Locked?"

180
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:39,912
Yeah. Yeah.

181
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:42,123
That's-that's, uh, that's me.

182
00:08:42,124 --> 00:08:44,125
Actually, it's my first role in a movie.

183
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:45,840
Hmm. That part's obvious.

184
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:49,631
Wait, what?

185
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:51,966
You know, Paige, just because you won

186
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,719
some sort of cattle call
wearing a push-up bra

187
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,596
and some cheap hair extensions

188
00:08:56,597 --> 00:08:58,274
doesn't really mean you're an actress.

189
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:03,479
Part's not really yours until
the cameras start rolling.

190
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:19,042
Those stories in the
press are nothing but lies.

191
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:21,792
We're considering taking
legal action, Nina.

192
00:09:22,773 --> 00:09:25,252
Ida, we're friends, right?

193
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:26,609
Ish.

194
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,739
Let's fight bad press with good press.

195
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:30,660
I'm listening.

196
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:33,778
What if Tangey booked the
main title song for "Locked?"

197
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:38,630
That would create some buzz.

198
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:40,356
What's in it for you?

199
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:42,402
We're having a casting
party tomorrow night.

200
00:09:42,403 --> 00:09:44,112
We show the world that
Tangey, Rainer and Jordan

201
00:09:44,113 --> 00:09:47,157
are still friends. Everybody wins.

202
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:49,201
If it means good press, I'll do it.

203
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:51,245
If she needs to reconcile with your son

204
00:09:51,246 --> 00:09:52,162
we can make that happen.

205
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:54,248
What? No, no, no. There's no way.

206
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:55,290
Why don't we let our children work out

207
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,960
their own personal lives?

208
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:00,089
Okay.

209
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:02,297
Fine.

210
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:03,980
If that's what you want, Nina.

211
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,349
I delivered a great audition,
and you gave the part

212
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,142
to this, like, fly-over-state amateur.

213
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,853
Hey, I never made any promises.

214
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:20,065
Paige Townsen ended up being
the best choice for the role.

215
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,067
Okay.

216
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:25,571
What about the part
of the dumbass sister?

217
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:27,864
Well, I'm, I'm about to
put out an offer to someone.

218
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,284
I want that part, Wyatt.

219
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:31,570
I need it.

220
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:36,748
Things have been slow for me, lately.

221
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:39,043
I'm just not sure if
you're right for it.

222
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:41,796
I see.

223
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,917
Maybe there's a way I
can audition privately.

224
00:10:56,441 --> 00:10:58,731
Alexis, just stop.

225
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:02,190
I like you, I really like you.

226
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,401
It's always fun when you're around.

227
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,402
What?

228
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:07,303
I'd like to take you to dinner.

229
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,198
Seriously?

230
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,390
Uh, um...

231
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:15,997
Fine. Wh-whatever.

232
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,626
This place's cleaned up
pretty nice for your parents.

233
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:22,294
So who do you think is gonna
be there tomorrow night?

234
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:24,504
Beyonce? Kim-ye?

235
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:27,708
Nina made it sound like there's
no way I can do both and...

236
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:29,605
I believe her.

237
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,346
Look at these spreadsheets,
they don't lie.

238
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,101
They're here.

239
00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:41,021
What do I do? What do I say?

240
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:42,272
Paige, just breathe.

241
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:45,754
And for now, just... lie.

242
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:47,527
I can lie.

243
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:49,018
I'm a good liar.

244
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:52,163
- Guys, hi!
- Hi!

245
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:53,950
There's our California girl.

246
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:56,631
- I missed you.
- Oh, and I missed you.

247
00:11:58,081 --> 00:11:59,498
Good to see you again. Hello. Hello.

248
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:01,480
Okay, guess who we saw at the airport?

249
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,619
Who?

250
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:05,923
Carrie Ann Inaba.

251
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:08,256
- She's so cool.
- And practically naked.

252
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:10,884
Honey, I told you she
was wearing a halter top.

253
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:12,928
Alright, is that what they're
calling a bra nowadays?

254
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:14,137
Should we get to lunch?

255
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:16,223
Honey, I'm sorry they
changed the schedule

256
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:18,266
at the teacher's convention,
literally, last minute.

257
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:20,102
We're just dropping in to
say hi and we gotta run.

258
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:21,311
- No.
- I know.

259
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:23,438
We-we-we really wanna take
all of you out for dinner

260
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,190
tomorrow night, okay,
and please pick a place

261
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,483
that has famous people.

262
00:12:30,238 --> 00:12:34,795
We can't, uh, we-we have a
huge study group for Econ.

263
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,870
- Big group study.
- Yeah, it's a big test.

264
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:41,248
- Meteoric, really.
- It's half our grade. So...

265
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:43,458
No. Listen, school comes first.

266
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:45,669
I'm glad to see you have
your priorities straight.

267
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,366
Very proud of you.

268
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:49,340
Priorities. Check.

269
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:55,716
Rachel?

270
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:58,473
- Alexis.
- Hi.

271
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:00,434
Hey, it's been a while.

272
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:03,729
Yeah, I thought you were in New York.

273
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,899
I was. Um, but turns out
there's no money in theatre.

274
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,771
So, decided to give LA another shot.

275
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:12,071
Cool.

276
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:18,988
Uh, so, I heard you
and Dakota are an item.

277
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:21,455
- Happy for you.
- Yeah.

278
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:23,999
Uh, things didn't really work out.

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,167
We wanted different things

280
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:27,295
and uh, she's a bitch.

281
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:31,539
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

282
00:13:33,785 --> 00:13:35,233
I think I'm gonna get going.

283
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:39,306
Wait, hang on. We should
get a drink sometime.

284
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:41,600
I'm pretty busy, getting
settled in and stuff

285
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:43,993
but I'll call you when
I come up for air, okay?

286
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,452
Is that a Cobb salad you're eating

287
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:02,162
or the remains of your latest prey?

288
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:05,499
Alan Mills, seems they'll
let anyone in here these days.

289
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,292
Well, you're proof of that,
how much did "Bombshells"

290
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:08,773
lose the studio?

291
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:11,630
Surprised you're not funding
"Locked" on Kickstarter.

292
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:13,548
- What do you want?
- I want my film back.

293
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:14,966
Oh, it's not your film. It never was.

294
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:17,093
You stole the rights, and you know it.

295
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:18,428
Well, maybe I did play a little dirty

296
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,597
but it wasn't the first time
and it won't be the last.

297
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:23,397
Oh, you know how this business works

298
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:25,060
because I taught you.

299
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:26,728
I'm sorry, did I
forget to say thank you?

300
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:29,606
- God, you're such a bitch.
- Is that the best you can do?

301
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,525
You know, I can't
believe I used to think

302
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:32,984
you're a hot piece of ass.

303
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:34,945
Oh, wasn't that a requirement
to be one of your assistants?

304
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:36,280
It still is.

305
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:41,326
Unless you're buying my
lunch, I think we're done here.

306
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:44,413
Oh, no. We're just getting started.

307
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:48,003
Enjoy your lunch.

308
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:13,234
Heard you were back in town.

309
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:17,272
Took you a while to get here.

310
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:20,448
Yeah, well, I've had
other things on my mind.

311
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:23,451
Oh, forgive me if I thought
apologizing to your boyfriend

312
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:26,604
for sleeping with his best
friend might be a priority.

313
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:32,752
God, you know, I'm, I'm pretty
sure to be someone's boyfriend

314
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:34,212
you need to actually see them.

315
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:35,630
If you had any decency

316
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:37,465
you'd be apologizing to me.

317
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:38,735
For what?

318
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:42,137
For the dozen hook-ups you've
had since I've been gone.

319
00:15:42,138 --> 00:15:44,806
God, Rainer, you never even
cared about me or what I needed.

320
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:46,725
What did you need, Tangey?

321
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:48,035
Jordan?

322
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:52,064
You still don't get it.

323
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:57,389
You know, Jordan's ten
times the man that you are.

324
00:15:57,994 --> 00:16:00,797
And you lost me way
before I slept with him.

325
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:03,795
You're just too focused
on yourself to realize it.

326
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:18,123
You know you're in Beverly Hills

327
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:20,614
when the floor is softer
than anything on your bed.

328
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,983
Should I get one just like it?

329
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,193
Birds of a feather?

330
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:29,141
It's a little, uh,

331
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:31,781
peacocky, right?

332
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,792
There's nothing peacocky about Gucci.

333
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,494
Did you try on the Prada yet?

334
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,121
No, wait.

335
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,833
The Walter Mendez will
accentuate your curves better.

336
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,960
Here's some stilettos
to complete the look.

337
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:48,297
Oh, but, you know, I'm actually
really wobbly when I would...

338
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,217
Eh, she doesn't care.

339
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,511
I'm kind of afraid of her.

340
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,012
And I'm really afraid

341
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,098
my parents are gonna find out the truth.

342
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,143
I mean, w-what do I do, Cass?
I lied straight to their face.

343
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,395
My dad will be so
disappointed in me, and...

344
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,064
Paige, relax, it's an industry party.

345
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,941
There's no way they're
gonna hear about it.

346
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,360
Ladies, are you almost
done? I'm starving.

347
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,325
Almost ready, one sec.

348
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,540
Do you like it?

349
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,044
Amazing.

350
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,088
Pretty.

351
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:32,057
- You look pretty.
- Really?

352
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,975
So...

353
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,687
...is this the one?

354
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:48,149
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

355
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,403
Definitely. I-I mean, look at you.

356
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:01,037
I wanna enjoy all of this.

357
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,122
I do, but...

358
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,177
How...

359
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,657
How am I supposed to
get through all of this?

360
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,171
What do you mean?

361
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:12,329
This. Everything.

362
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,718
Lying to my parents, school, this movie.

363
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,470
It's, it's all just, it's...

364
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,385
It's so much.

365
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,600
It's... too much.

366
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,807
It's just too much
for me to handle and...

367
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:29,649
And now I feel like my head
is just gonna explode and I...

368
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,026
Paige, it's okay.

369
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,768
We're gonna help you get through this.

370
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:46,707
Thanks for the sit-down, man.

371
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,167
This will be in our next issue, so...

372
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,293
Jordie Michaels, right?

373
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:51,936
Nope, you've got the wrong guy.

374
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,091
Well, I-I know you're a big star now.

375
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,301
But you look a lot like a guy...

376
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,299
When you're in movies,
people think they know you.

377
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,222
I promise you, you don't.

378
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,684
Oh, my mistake.

379
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:06,489
Have a good one, Jordie.

380
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,022
I mean, Jordan.

381
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:17,316
Happens all the time,
man. You'd be amazed.

382
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,801
- Yeah. Thanks for your time.
- Yup, thank you.

383
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,418
I heard they offered
you the sister role.

384
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,088
Congrats.

385
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,486
I'm still negotiating.

386
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,462
I'm sorry you didn't get the lead.

387
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,804
Mm-hmm. So, why are you really here?

388
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,557
Apologies aren't usually your thing.

389
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,978
- Tangey dropped by.
- I know. She called me.

390
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,314
She's actually blaming
me for the breakup.

391
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,982
Like I forced her to sleep with Jordan.

392
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,151
Rain, she was lonely.

393
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,902
You were, like, never around.

394
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:59,538
- She's the one who left.
- Yeah, for work.

395
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:01,574
Why do you even care? It's over.

396
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,576
Just find someone new like you always do

397
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,746
and get sick of her,
and find someone else.

398
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,165
I get it. I'm a terrible boyfriend.

399
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,537
Well, I wouldn't date you.

400
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,858
- Really?
- Oh!

401
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,519
Baby, I've known you since you were 12.

402
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,859
You're not relationship material.

403
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,768
You seem distracted.

404
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,035
You were there for me when
my life wasn't... great.

405
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,462
You ever tell anyone about my past?

406
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,279
Of course not.

407
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:42,560
I would never do anything
to jeopardize your career.

408
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,726
You know that.

409
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,844
- Forget I even brought it up.
- Okay.

410
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,932
That son of a bitch.
They fired Fred Tate.

411
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,691
He's out of the studio.
He's our biggest ally.

412
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,566
Without him, the entire
movie could get shut down.

413
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,282
I'm sorry. I know we still need to talk.

414
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:31,322
Do you know what I've
been thinking about today?

415
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,921
Freshman theater workshop.

416
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,675
You used to come and watch Cassie

417
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,588
and I slept right through
that horrible one...

418
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:45,638
That's when I knew
we'd be friends forever.

419
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,832
And that's what you need right now.

420
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:57,054
A friend.

421
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,000
It wouldn't be right
to complicate things.

422
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,601
You know?

423
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,326
Cassie and I were talking...

424
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,912
What does Cassie have
to do with anything?

425
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,956
I mean, that-that's us, right?

426
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,085
The three <i>amigos.</i> That's
how we've been since freshmen year.

427
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,214
- Yeah.
- A little help here.

428
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,009
Ah, I got it. Ahem.

429
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,746
Everything okay?

430
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,933
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

431
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:40,314
You almost ready? What's wrong?

432
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:43,547
Um, I-I can't get my
hair out of my dress.

433
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:46,595
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:52,034
Oh, it's my mom.

435
00:22:52,035 --> 00:22:54,536
What should I say? Do
I say we're studying?

436
00:22:54,537 --> 00:22:56,813
Or you can just answer the
phone and tell me the truth.

437
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,983
Um, y-your mom's here.

438
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:04,171
Honey, you're a horrible liar.

439
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:07,184
- And you always have been.
- I know, I'm sorry.

440
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:09,810
- Are you mad at me?
- Mad?

441
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:12,304
If you're doing what
I think you're doing

442
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:15,183
I might have a heart
attack, in-in a good way.

443
00:23:15,184 --> 00:23:16,893
When we were here yesterday

444
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:19,771
I saw the "Locked" script on the table

445
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:22,778
with your name on it,
next to the role of August.

446
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,401
Are you...

447
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:27,403
Whoa!

448
00:23:27,404 --> 00:23:29,155
Yeah, I know, I know. I know.

449
00:23:29,156 --> 00:23:30,240
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

450
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:33,576
Oh, my God! You won that
at an open casting call.

451
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:35,119
I know all about it. How's Rainer?

452
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,621
I can't believe Tangey cheated on him.

453
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:39,374
I can't believe you're
doing a movie with him.

454
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,167
Oh, my gosh! This isn't
just any movie though.

455
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:42,716
This is "Locked."

456
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:46,256
Honey, my book club has
read the entire series.

457
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:47,340
Oh, my gosh!

458
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:50,302
We thought we were excited
to see "50 Shades of Grey."

459
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,388
Does dad know?

460
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:54,556
- No.
- Oh.

461
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,866
But I thought we could tell him tonight.

462
00:23:57,142 --> 00:23:59,743
If we do it together, he'll
know how important this is.

463
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:03,471
Thank you, mom.

464
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:09,405
I'll get it.

465
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:13,992
- Rainer!
- Cassie, right?

466
00:24:13,993 --> 00:24:15,743
Yeah, yeah, that's, that's me.

467
00:24:15,744 --> 00:24:17,580
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

468
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:21,792
Hey, I'm Rainer.

469
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:24,210
Uh, yeah, I know.

470
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:25,523
We've hung out.

471
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:27,630
Oh, right. Sorry.

472
00:24:27,631 --> 00:24:29,675
I meet a lot of people.

473
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,886
Okay, I'm ready.

474
00:24:35,472 --> 00:24:36,640
Oh, Rainer?

475
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:39,518
Hi.

476
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:41,770
Um...

477
00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:47,228
What are, uh, what are you doing here?

478
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:49,783
Your rabbit's a classic.

479
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:53,662
But I was thinkin'
tonight's star attraction

480
00:24:54,134 --> 00:24:55,641
should arrive like a star.

481
00:24:57,244 --> 00:24:58,479
That's your car outside.

482
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,959
Um, there's room for everyone.

483
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,670
Y-yes, please.

484
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:11,467
You look beautiful.

485
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:13,968
Thanks. You do, too.

486
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:16,471
I mean, not beautiful, of course.

487
00:25:16,472 --> 00:25:19,183
But, like, h-h-handsome.

488
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,882
Very handsome.

489
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:24,855
Let's go.

490
00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:34,301
Hey!

491
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:36,032
For the record, when you told Paige

492
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,408
you'd rather be friends

493
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:39,164
I didn't believe a word of it.

494
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:41,245
But I know why you did it and it was

495
00:25:41,246 --> 00:25:43,414
a pretty cool thing for you to do.

496
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:46,465
Look, I just wanted
to simplify her life.

497
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:48,853
And I didn't see that guy coming.

498
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:19,575
Oh, my God.

499
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:21,285
Are those real swans in the pool?

500
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:24,956
This is not a little party.
This is a very, very big party.

501
00:26:24,957 --> 00:26:27,667
Oh, my God. Is that, is that "Extra?"

502
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:29,419
- Is that a bad thing?
- Oh!

503
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,088
My mom watches that show every night.

504
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:34,465
My dad thinks I'm studying right now.

505
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:35,425
Texting her as we speak.

506
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:38,919
- No TV after the pina coladas.
- Thanks, Cassie.

507
00:26:39,555 --> 00:26:41,723
I have to leave here by 8:30 tonight

508
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:43,391
so I can tell my dad the truth.

509
00:26:43,392 --> 00:26:46,269
Paige, just take a
breath. I'm here for you.

510
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,132
Yeah, but you can't stand
by my side all night.

511
00:26:49,898 --> 00:26:51,867
This is R in sign language.

512
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:53,320
Tonight, it's our code.

513
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:56,685
If you get into a jam
just throw up a sign.

514
00:26:57,268 --> 00:27:00,019
Is that Kim Richards? No,
wait. That's Kim Zolciak.

515
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,911
This is insane. It's like a
buffet of "Real Housewives."

516
00:27:05,164 --> 00:27:06,998
Uh, I-I need a drink.
Do-do you need a drink?

517
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,458
Let's, let's, let's go
get, let's go get a drink.

518
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:12,503
- Oh, Cassie.
- Paige! Hi. Alexis Glen.

519
00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:14,338
We met at the studio. Guess what?

520
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:16,174
I'm gonna be playing your sister.

521
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:17,967
I have a hunch when this is over

522
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:19,427
we're gonna be sisters for life.

523
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:21,137
Paige, um, I wanna steal you here.

524
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:22,472
Introduce you to some friends.

525
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:24,573
- We'll see you later, Lexi.
- Okay.

526
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:33,473
- Hi.
- Hi.

527
00:27:33,817 --> 00:27:37,778
Wow, twice in two
days. Pretty crazy, huh?

528
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:39,530
Yeah. Crazy.

529
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:43,326
Uh, I'm gonna go talk to a friend.

530
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:44,879
- So, I'll see you later.
- Wait.

531
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:46,436
Look.

532
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:51,376
I know I made a mistake once,
but I'm a different person now.

533
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,790
- I tried therapy.
- Yeah?

534
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:58,967
- How many times did you go?
- Twice.

535
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:01,136
Right.

536
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:11,813
I've missed you.

537
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:15,441
I've missed you, too.

538
00:28:15,718 --> 00:28:17,485
Can we start over?

539
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:19,132
I wanna see you again.

540
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:21,322
Well, didn't Nina tell you?

541
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:22,875
I got a part in "Locked."

542
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:26,078
Didn't know it came
with fringe benefits.

543
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:38,251
Hiding out?

544
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:40,883
You never did like an industry party.

545
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,886
I just don't want
another scene with Rainer.

546
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:46,395
I, I haven't heard from you in a while.

547
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:48,403
Yeah, it's really crazy lately.

548
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:52,521
It's not right what they're
doing to you because of... us.

549
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:55,089
I'm sorry.

550
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:57,687
I'm not.

551
00:28:58,485 --> 00:29:00,903
I mean, the tabloids, tabloids blow.

552
00:29:00,904 --> 00:29:04,950
But, being with you? It was worth it.

553
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,334
- Am I interrupting round two?
- Hold on, Rainer.

554
00:29:15,335 --> 00:29:17,169
Look, Tangey and I made
a mistake. A big one.

555
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,921
- And I'm sorry for that.
- You're damn right about that.

556
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:20,506
We're all gonna be working
on this movie together

557
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:22,091
whether you like it or
not, so get over yourself

558
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:23,551
and quit being a little bitch.

559
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:25,761
- You wanna do this again?
- Look, step back, man.

560
00:29:25,762 --> 00:29:28,347
- You need to step back.
- Hey. Hey, that is enough!

561
00:29:28,348 --> 00:29:29,890
That is enough!

562
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:31,767
You're not goin' to ruin
tonight. Do you hear me?

563
00:29:31,768 --> 00:29:33,728
You have jobs to do out there.

564
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:36,647
So get it together. Here's the story.

565
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:38,899
You and Tangey amicably
broke up a month ago

566
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,450
and chose to keep your
private lives private.

567
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:43,195
And nothing happened
between you and Tangey.

568
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:44,779
It was an absurd rumor.

569
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:47,354
You were all friends before

570
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:49,619
and you're still friends now.

571
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,692
Got it?

572
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:54,790
Okay, everybody, let's put on a show.

573
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:55,792
Come on.

574
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,129
And you need to stop
believing your own press.

575
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,130
What?

576
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:03,090
You may be America's favorite good guy

577
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:05,384
but I know you sleep with a
different girl every night.

578
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:08,263
So, stop pretending that
Tangey meant something to you.

579
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:10,557
Thanks, mom.

580
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:16,979
- Tangey, who are you wearing?
- What about the album?

581
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,189
- When does it come out?
- Tangey?

582
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,483
- Can we get any quotes...
- Tangey.

583
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:24,737
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Hollywood heartthrobs

584
00:30:24,738 --> 00:30:27,740
Rainer Devon as Noah Greer.

585
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:30,701
And Jordan Wilder as Ed Khan.

586
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:35,247
You may have conned my mom
into giving you this role

587
00:30:35,248 --> 00:30:36,957
but don't think we're good.

588
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,168
I didn't have to con her into anything.

589
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:42,172
I got this part based on
my talent, not nepotism.

590
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:49,804
Next, we have America's sweetheart

591
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:52,014
Alexis Glenn as Maggie.

592
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:57,883
And Broadway sensation
Rachel Davis as Layla.

593
00:30:58,647 --> 00:31:01,774
Finally, there's a new face in
Hollywood I'd like you to meet.

594
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:03,859
After a nationwide talent search

595
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,987
playing our heroine, August Roch

596
00:31:06,988 --> 00:31:10,324
introducing, Paige Townsen!

597
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:14,495
- Whoo!
- Go, Paige!

598
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:20,751
Paige, look this way. Paige, this way.

599
00:31:20,752 --> 00:31:23,713
Look this way, Paige. Hey, over here.

600
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:25,005
Paige, what's it feel like to

601
00:31:25,006 --> 00:31:27,591
work with the hottest men in Hollywood?

602
00:31:27,592 --> 00:31:29,927
Over here, are you dating anybody?

603
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:32,138
Paige, where have you been hiding?

604
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:34,056
Uh, uh, nowhere.

605
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:36,074
Have we seen you anywhere before?

606
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:39,770
Um, maybe at the CMU quad.

607
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:55,202
Hey, take it easy, fellas.

608
00:31:55,203 --> 00:31:56,787
Her studio insurance
policy doesn't kick in

609
00:31:56,788 --> 00:31:58,247
until we start shooting.

610
00:32:02,002 --> 00:32:05,588
Ladies and gentlemen, I give
you the cast of "Locked!"

611
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,032
Hey, it's 8:00 o'clock.
Have you seen Paige?

612
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:25,076
Uh, not since the announcement.

613
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:26,202
What are those?

614
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:27,536
They're like the Swedish meatballs

615
00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:29,247
but more Mexican than Swedish.

616
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:35,420
Um, I gotta go pee.

617
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:39,927
- Hi.
- Oh.

618
00:32:40,634 --> 00:32:41,842
Hi, a-aren't you, uh...

619
00:32:41,843 --> 00:32:44,443
America's sweetheart? Guilty.

620
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:48,015
Did I see you arrive
earlier with Paige Townsen?

621
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:50,351
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we're,
uh, we're good friends.

622
00:32:50,352 --> 00:32:53,348
Well, any friend of
Paige's is a friend of mine.

623
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:55,627
Yeah, totally. I...

624
00:32:57,317 --> 00:32:59,620
Especially one with
those big brown eyes.

625
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:03,115
Guilty.

626
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,632
Reach out to all of them, Todd.

627
00:33:08,657 --> 00:33:10,909
God, the new studio
head decides my fate.

628
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:13,997
Earn your commission for once.

629
00:33:16,378 --> 00:33:19,373
- Having fun?
- Not really.

630
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:21,841
Tangey should have been
photographed with the cast.

631
00:33:21,842 --> 00:33:23,009
Why?

632
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,051
You can't become a triple threat

633
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:25,511
if all you do is sing.

634
00:33:25,512 --> 00:33:27,013
- The movie's cast.
- Oh.

635
00:33:27,014 --> 00:33:29,323
Then we don't have a
deal on the soundtrack.

636
00:33:29,323 --> 00:33:30,781
- Seriously?
- Mm.

637
00:33:30,782 --> 00:33:32,658
Have a little gratitude.

638
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:34,285
Another PR mishap like her last

639
00:33:34,286 --> 00:33:36,651
she'll be lucky if they
let her sing at the mall.

640
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,386
Enjoy the party.

641
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:48,175
Hey. Nice seeing you.

642
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,721
Brody, hi. Look, nobody
here knows that I...

643
00:33:53,722 --> 00:33:56,974
- Hey, I'm Jake.
- Hi. Brody.

644
00:33:56,975 --> 00:33:58,517
- So are you a client of...
- Oh, my God!

645
00:33:58,518 --> 00:34:00,931
- It's Selena Gomez!
- Where?

646
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:03,200
Over there!

647
00:34:04,015 --> 00:34:06,433
No. No, th-that's not Selena Gomez.

648
00:34:06,497 --> 00:34:07,998
Oh. My bad.

649
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,829
- Who are we looking for?
- Uh, no one.

650
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:21,041
Yuck! Can you believe
her with that goofy grin?

651
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,793
Those have to be veneers, right?

652
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:28,019
Why do we hate her again?

653
00:34:28,423 --> 00:34:30,255
Oh, thank goodness, you guys are here.

654
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,677
Let's bounce outta here.
Well, we really need...

655
00:34:32,678 --> 00:34:34,428
You're not done yet. You
haven't met Barrett Hopper.

656
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,888
Oh, but, uh, Nina, I should...

657
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,474
- I, uh, I really have to leave.
- What?

658
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:39,725
Uh, we were just on our way out.

659
00:34:39,726 --> 00:34:40,851
Uh, Paige's parents
are in town. So we...

660
00:34:40,852 --> 00:34:42,561
- And who are you?
- Oh, I'm Jake Salt.

661
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:45,523
- I'm Paige's friend.
- That was rhetorical.

662
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:48,567
This is part of your job,
Paige. Your parents can wait.

663
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:50,111
- But, Nina, I...
- Let's go.

664
00:34:50,112 --> 00:34:51,487
Do you want us to call your mom?

665
00:34:51,488 --> 00:34:53,280
- Paige?
- Uh, uh...

666
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:54,740
I'll shoot Mrs. T another text

667
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:56,645
while we Uber it at the shake stand.

668
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:58,744
Wait, what, you're still hungry?

669
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:00,246
- Barrett...
- Hi.

670
00:35:00,247 --> 00:35:01,455
It's my pleasure to introduce you

671
00:35:01,456 --> 00:35:02,873
to the star of our little movie.

672
00:35:02,874 --> 00:35:05,068
That hair could be a star on its own.

673
00:35:05,263 --> 00:35:08,045
Well, darling, aren't
you the talk of the town?

674
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,798
Talk to Barrett. Tell
us your life story.

675
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:20,057
Sorry, I couldn't get
you out of there in time

676
00:35:20,058 --> 00:35:21,461
to talk to your dad.

677
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:26,625
I'm sorry you and Jordan
are still fighting.

678
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:30,568
I guess what Nina said
about him and Tangey

679
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:33,013
wasn't just a rumor.

680
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:36,704
It's history.

681
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:40,619
You seem to have a lot of history

682
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,463
with a lot of different people.

683
00:35:46,721 --> 00:35:48,587
Well, not that many, a few.

684
00:35:50,756 --> 00:35:51,922
Okay, quite a few.

685
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:55,870
Did Jake and Cassie have fun?

686
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,725
They make a cute couple.

687
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:01,099
They're not dating.

688
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:03,318
Actually we're all kinda just...

689
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:05,600
friends.

690
00:36:06,153 --> 00:36:07,237
Good to know.

691
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:12,065
I've never met anyone quite like you.

692
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:15,447
Me, too.

693
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,982
I-I'm sorry, honey.
Dad saw you on the news.

694
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,124
Hi, Rainer.

695
00:36:28,835 --> 00:36:29,586
Sorry.

696
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,580
How could you lie like this, hm?

697
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:37,582
And then make your
mother do your dirty work.

698
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,000
I-I don't even know
who you are right now.

699
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:40,256
I'm sorry.

700
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,191
I was going to tell you, I swear.

701
00:36:43,437 --> 00:36:45,897
You are throwing away your education

702
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:48,635
to star in some Hollywood movie...

703
00:36:48,636 --> 00:36:51,262
I told you, this film
is a really big deal.

704
00:36:51,263 --> 00:36:53,222
And I'm not throwing away my education.

705
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:54,933
I-I found a way to make it work.

706
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,559
Yeah, that's right,
because you're gonna quit.

707
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,186
- What?
- Yes.

708
00:36:58,187 --> 00:37:01,606
I-I can't. I, I already
made a commitment.

709
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:03,483
Well, you tell them
you changed your mind.

710
00:37:03,484 --> 00:37:04,526
No!

711
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:07,529
I...

712
00:37:09,657 --> 00:37:11,053
I won't.

713
00:37:12,487 --> 00:37:13,743
Yes, you taught me

714
00:37:13,744 --> 00:37:15,787
the importance of an education, dad.

715
00:37:15,788 --> 00:37:17,538
But you also taught me

716
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,624
how, how important it is

717
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,228
to dream big.

718
00:37:22,503 --> 00:37:26,340
And, I mean, this is
as big as my dreams get.

719
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:28,926
I'm...

720
00:37:32,304 --> 00:37:33,472
I'm doing the movie.

721
00:37:41,396 --> 00:37:42,397
I see.

722
00:37:43,832 --> 00:37:45,097
Dad.

723
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:58,716
He knows you get paid a
lot for this, though, right?

724
00:37:58,789 --> 00:37:59,831
It doesn't matter.

725
00:37:59,832 --> 00:38:01,749
He's worried I'm not
gonna be able to handle

726
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,595
doing school and the movie.

727
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:05,879
I'm starting to think he's right.

728
00:38:08,757 --> 00:38:10,759
Cassie brought some
dessert home in her purse.

729
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:13,595
You want a cookie?

730
00:38:16,265 --> 00:38:17,591
What kind of cookie?

731
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:19,309
I'll go get 'em.

732
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:21,748
I'll make some tea.

733
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:30,903
Oh, Jake, your, um...

734
00:39:02,728 --> 00:39:06,162
Nina. Oh, your assistant
wasn't on his desk.

735
00:39:06,565 --> 00:39:08,649
Probably picking up
your Boniva prescription.

736
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,693
- Do I need to call security?
- Sure.

737
00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:13,227
Tell them your new boss is here.

738
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:15,198
- What?
- Oh.

739
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:17,677
I'm the new head of Gold Brothers, Nina.

740
00:39:18,368 --> 00:39:20,644
And I'm gonna have a lot of fun

741
00:39:21,246 --> 00:39:24,917
making your life a living hell.

742
00:39:29,296 --> 00:39:30,914
Glad we could work this out.

743
00:39:31,465 --> 00:39:33,845
Remember, we agreed on $50 more bucks.

744
00:39:34,468 --> 00:39:36,212
I need the money for school.

745
00:39:36,804 --> 00:39:39,098
Yeah, sure. No problem.

746
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:12,341
_

747
00:40:28,147 --> 00:40:30,731
I-I'm not sure why we are here.

748
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:32,985
Nothing's changed since last night.

749
00:40:34,778 --> 00:40:37,876
Dad, I really don't want
you to go home mad at me.

750
00:40:38,657 --> 00:40:39,907
I would like to say I'm not mad.

751
00:40:39,908 --> 00:40:42,118
I'm disappointed, but
that would be a lie.

752
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,744
Something you seem to know a lot about.

753
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:46,957
Uh, uh, excuse me?

754
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:49,497
Oh, my God, you're her.

755
00:40:49,793 --> 00:40:51,886
Hey, can I, can I have your autograph?

756
00:40:52,379 --> 00:40:54,409
Uh, um, really?

757
00:40:54,965 --> 00:40:57,049
I can't believe I'm
meeting Paige Townsen.

758
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,056
Uh, can you make it out to Jennifer?

759
00:40:59,553 --> 00:41:02,763
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course, I can.

760
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:05,308
I've read "Locked" six times.

761
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:07,226
August is my favorite
character of all time.

762
00:41:07,227 --> 00:41:09,395
I wrote a paper on her
for my English class.

763
00:41:09,396 --> 00:41:12,273
- What grade did you get?
- A plus.

764
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:14,358
Congratulations.

765
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:16,110
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

766
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:18,029
- Thanks so much, Jennifer.
- Oh, my God!

767
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,364
Thank you. Oh, my God!

768
00:41:20,365 --> 00:41:23,951
Hey, Paige, this is incredible.
You're famous already.

769
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:39,008
Okay, y-you're sure
you can make this movie

770
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:40,597
and stay at school?

771
00:41:41,094 --> 00:41:44,396
I promise I'm gonna do
whatever it takes to do both.

772
00:41:46,683 --> 00:41:48,059
Well, I'm not sure it's doable

773
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,937
but I guess I could
make up a spreadsheet

774
00:41:50,938 --> 00:41:52,348
to help you with your schedule.

775
00:41:53,565 --> 00:41:55,170
I would love that, dad.

776
00:41:55,434 --> 00:41:58,093
Okay, so what's this "Locked"
story about? What is this?

777
00:41:58,904 --> 00:42:00,405
Um...

778
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:07,506
