line two

23
00:03:44,722 --> 00:03:47,180
Paging Doctor line two.

24
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,050
- Morning Ms. Dallman.

25
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,090
I'm Brad Steiner.

26
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,623
I've been assigned as your attorney.

27
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,190
I'm a straight forward man, Ms. Dallman,

28
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,690
so let's just get right to it.

29
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,740
Tell me what happened.

30
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:16,445
Ms. Dallman.

31
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:25,504
Ms. Dallman.

32
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:27,703
Hettie, is it?

33
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,100
Hettie, what you tell me
is in total confidence.

34
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,360
Reports state that you entered the room

35
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,433
at approximately 5:30 in the morning.

36
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,720
You shot your father in
the left side of his head,

37
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,440
and then you shot your mother in the face

38
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,763
with the bullet entering
through her right eye.

39
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,970
The arresting officer
found you covered in blood,

40
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,083
on their bedroom floor, holding
the alleged murder weapon.

41
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,720
Hey, you gotta to talk to me.

42
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,843
Let's see.

43
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:30,750
You are 36 years old, no job, no husband,

44
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,600
and no means to support yourself.

45
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,070
Hettie, let me tell
you how the prosecution

46
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,370
is gonna be spinning this.

47
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:37,650
You're the sole beneficiary

48
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,040
on your parent's insurance policy,

49
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,720
and you're in a ton of debt.

50
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,877
Classic cliché.

51
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,920
But if it walks like a
duck, quacks like a duck.

52
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,973
You see where I'm going with this?

53
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:13,623
You gotta give me something
to work with, Hettie.

54
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,560
- Hey Brad.

55
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,970
What hole did you crawl out of

56
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,418
that I haven't seen you in forever?

57
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:07,870
- Get me off
the damn speaker phone.

58
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,163
- So cranky so early.

59
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,190
- It's the only way I know how to be.

60
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,720
Anyway, you know how I hate those things.

61
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,573
- Yeah, so?

62
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,440
- So I wanna get your
thoughts on something.

63
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,470
- All right.

64
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,310
- I got a doozy of a case handed to me.

65
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,370
A woman killed both her parents.

66
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,890
- Your defense on this?

67
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,040
- Sorry, allegedly
killed both her parents.

68
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:31,260
- And?

69
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,940
- Well, I had a meeting with her,

70
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,340
and I gotta tell you she's hard as steel.

71
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,380
She wouldn't say a word to me.

72
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,900
- What do you think, is malingering?

73
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,965
- That she's trying
to get an insanity plea?

74
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:43,320
- I don't know.

75
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,753
There's no doubt the DA
think she's faking though.

76
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,830
- Brad, you're a gem.

77
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,240
This is perfect timing.

78
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,693
It's exactly what I needed.

79
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,340
- Abby, I haven't even asked you yet.

80
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,713
- So ask me.

81
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,463
- I need you on this.

82
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:01,410
Will you please take on this client,

83
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,900
and do a full psych eval?

84
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:05,527
- I would be honored.

85
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,280
- Good morning, Ms. Dallman.
I'm Dr. Abigail Williams,

86
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,683
and I'll be meeting with you
for the next couple of weeks.

87
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,210
Before we get started,

88
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,860
I just need you to fill
out one of these forms.

89
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,420
This gives the courts
access to our sessions,

90
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,520
and then we can begin.

91
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,763
Hettie?

92
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,550
Do you mind if I call you Hettie?

93
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,530
These forms are just for formality.

94
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,850
This will let the court determine

95
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,950
if you're competent enough to stand trial.

96
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,370
Hettie, do you understand why you're here?

97
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,633
Hettie, you're gonna have to
talk to me so I can help you.

98
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,283
Thank you.

99
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,373
I will be recording our sessions.

100
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:33,855
So Hettie, do you
understand why you're here?

101
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,363
Do you understand the charges against you?

102
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,040
You've been charged with
the murder of your parents,

103
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,760
A Mrs. Ellie Dallman,
and Mr. Samuel Dallman.

104
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,026
- Hey, Abs, you home?

105
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,480
So this is what it has come to?

106
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,770
- What are you doing, I
am on a deadline here.

107
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,620
- Are you even willing to work on us?

108
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,323
- Do you know what'll happen
if I miss another deadline?

109
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,140
I'm not doing this right now.

110
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,083
- I'm tired of this.

111
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,860
Now, you won't even talk to me.

112
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,080
- I'm tired of the same
conversation, Martin.

113
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,490
It's the same thing
over and over with you.

114
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,012
- It's not even a conversation.

115
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:34,900
You won't open it up to discussion.
I don't get a vote, a say?

116
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,100
- A baby is not gonna fix this.

117
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,660
Me having a child is not gonna
fix what's wrong with us.

118
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,776
- Then what will, Abby?

119
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:45,533
What will?

120
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:46,900
More work?

121
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,733
- Shut up?

122
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,460
- She's a bit of a challenge.

123
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,951
- You knew that.

124
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:10,550
That's why I called in the best, right?

125
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,033
- I just need to find a
different approach, that's all.

126
00:12:15,377 --> 00:12:16,687
- Be careful what you wish for.

127
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,025
- What?

128
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,453
- Perfect closing case for the book?

129
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,670
- What is her background again?

130
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:34,977
- She's a bit of a loner,
single, can't hold down a job.

131
00:12:36,575 --> 00:12:37,423
really.

132
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,893
- There must've been a trigger.

133
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,090
There had to have been.

134
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,533
You said her parents were asleep, right?

135
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,383
- Yeah.

136
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,303
- Okay, was there an
argument earlier that day?

137
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:00,441
- And you think that's what made her snap?

138
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:02,054
- Something did.

139
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:03,700
- Apparently.

140
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,780
- No, I mean, there was
something either said

141
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,330
or done to trigger her actions.

142
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,700
I mean, she had plenty of
opportunities to kill them.

143
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,533
Why now?

144
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:15,683
- You know, it might've been the obvious.

145
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,140
- I don't buy it.

146
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,435
I don't think she did
it just for the money.

147
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,087
- You'd be surprised what people would do

148
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:25,670
just for the money.

149
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,360
Anyway, I know you'll figure it out, Abs.

150
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,260
Hello?

151
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,880
Yeah, yeah, I sent the
paperwork in yesterday.

152
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,730
Yeah, well did you check spam folder?

153
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,210
- Paging Dr. Moore, line two.

154
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,543
Paging Dr. Moore, line two.

155
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,986
- What are these papers telling me?

156
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:53,664
- Well, you're here for a reason,

157
00:13:53,664 --> 00:13:55,513
so you gotta fight this.

158
00:13:55,513 --> 00:13:56,562
- Get me outta here.

159
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:57,778
- I can only do so much.

160
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:58,828
- Oh my gosh.

161
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:03,083
- Hey, it's me,

162
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,863
your cousin, Felicia.

163
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,400
They treating you okay in here?

164
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:22,811
God, I haven't seen you in so long.

165
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,033
Didn't imagine it would be like this.

166
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,210
These chairs are so hard.

167
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,560
They could at least have
better chairs in here.

168
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,633
Why didn't you talk to me, Hettie?

169
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:56,957
I wanna to show you something.

170
00:14:59,137 --> 00:15:00,837
I found these at the thrift store.

171
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,743
Reminded me of us when we were kids.

172
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:10,290
I remembered how you always had these.

173
00:15:20,243 --> 00:15:21,376
- No. No.

174
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:22,309
- Hettie.

175
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:23,542
- No. No.

176
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:24,769
- Calm down. Don't hurt her.

177
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:29,655
Calm down, Hettie.

178
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:30,559
Hettie.

179
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,809
Don't hurt her.

180
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:34,535
Hettie, calm down.

181
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:35,368
Hettie.

182
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,401
Hettie.

183
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:39,234
Hettie.

184
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:38,270
- Good morning, Hettie.

185
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,403
I'd like to continue
our conversation today.

186
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,540
Hettie, do you understand
that you have been charged

187
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,720
with the alleged murder
of both your parents?

188
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,823
- Not alleged.

189
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,483
- Okay, you're stating that you-

190
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:11,316
- I killed them.

191
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,973
- Okay, tell me why you think that.

192
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,513
Did you fire the gun?

193
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,450
Hettie, now is the time to tell your side.

194
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,833
Was this an accident?

195
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,583
Was this on purpose?

196
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:50,290
This wasn't an accident, was it?

197
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,860
You thought they deserve to die.

198
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,833
Why?

199
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,800
They were asleep in their bed.

200
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,633
- Shut up.

201
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,123
- This wasn't self-defense.

202
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,260
They were defenseless.

203
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,138
- Stop talking.

204
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:13,223
- No, we're okay.

205
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:19,933
I know this is hard, but
you have to face this.

206
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,593
Please, sit down.

207
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:30,547
- You think you know me, don't you?

208
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,073
You got what you wanted.

209
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:41,613
So just do what you gotta do.

210
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:48,363
- Hettie, you know where this
leads if you're found guilty.

211
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,930
Tell your side of it.

212
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,730
Leave your family with some closure.

213
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,840
- We don't talk about
those things in my family.

214
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:14,829
- What things, Hettie?

215
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:19,692
Hettie.

216
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:33,200
- Hey pop, where's everybody going?

217
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,610
- We're all going south.

218
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,253
Ground hog's day, a
terrible blizzard is coming.

219
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:38,993
- Go on, that
guy don't know his shadow

220
00:19:38,993 --> 00:19:40,513
from a hole in the ground

221
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,593
You'll freeze to
death if you stay here

222
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:44,996
And you won't
have a any food either.

223
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:47,468
- Don't worry about me,
I got plenty of food

224
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:49,284
and right now I'm going swimming

225
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:00,207
- Mrs. Dallman.

226
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:01,050
- I'm Mrs. Dallman.

227
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,270
- I'm Ms. Horne, Hettie's teacher.

228
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,920
Sorry to bother you.

229
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,753
May I come in?

230
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,360
- Yes. Well, I guess.

231
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,193
Thank you.

232
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,213
- What's going on with Hettie?

233
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,296
- Hi, Hettie.

234
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,820
Beautiful home here Mrs. Dallman.

235
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,350
- Thank you, and call me Ellie.

236
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,420
Can I get you something?

237
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,460
Some water, tea?

238
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,833
- No, thank you. I'm fine.

239
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,700
- You'll excuse me, Ms. Horne.

240
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,550
I'm a bit busy.

241
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,383
What is it?

242
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,910
- Well, during recess today,
Hettie stuck her classmate,

243
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,653
Rita with a stick.

244
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,730
- I'm sorry, Ms. Horne.

245
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,690
You came all the way over here for this?

246
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,560
Kids hit and poke each other all the time.

247
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,590
Can't you handle it?

248
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,680
- Yes, Mrs. Dallman, I understand, but-

249
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,560
- Ellie.

250
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,393
- Ellie.

251
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,870
- Hettie, go up to your room.

252
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,785
Ms. Horne, I am not the
least bit amused here.

253
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:10,200
I've got to get dinner
on the table tonight

254
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,420
before my husband go to work.

255
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,710
Now, what is going on?

256
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,884
- Hettie's father is in the home?

257
00:21:14,884 --> 00:21:15,717
- What are you talking about?

258
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:16,803
Of course, he is.

259
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,470
You another one of them

260
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,240
that don't think our men stay in home.

261
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,350
- No, Ellie. I didn't-

262
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,433
- Mrs. Dallman.

263
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:25,274
- Ms. Dallman, I didn't...

264
00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:27,099
Look, I didn't mean it that way.

265
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:30,420
It's just the nature of Hettie's behavior

266
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,730
and where she poked the
girl, it suggests that...

267
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,503
Well, it's suggest that
there may be abuse.

268
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,730
- What are you trying to do?

269
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,873
You can leave now.

270
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:49,250
- Mrs. Dallman, I know this is difficult.

271
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,285
I know it's a hard situation.

272
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:52,125
This is-

273
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,190
- Thank you very much, Ms.
Horne for wasting my time.

274
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,860
I will have a talk with Hettie,

275
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,020
and I guarantee she won't
be poking nobody else.

276
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,863
Mrs. Dallman, this is serious.

277
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:13,933
- Hettie, I am so sorry.

278
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,623
I didn't mean to upset you last time.

279
00:22:16,623 --> 00:22:18,457
I just thought that if I-

280
00:22:18,457 --> 00:22:19,653
- Why are you here?

281
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:21,941
- What?

282
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,803
Hettie, we're family.

283
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,660
I care about you.

284
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,650
- Really?

285
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,100
- Don't be like that, Hettie.

286
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,303
Eva started basketball.

287
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,220
She's pretty good too.

288
00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:49,180
- You're just like all of them.

289
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,870
You act like everything is
everything all the time.

290
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,333
- Do not say that.

291
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,959
I'm nothing like them, and you know it.

292
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,117
- What is wrong with you?

293
00:23:12,117 --> 00:23:14,363
If you run these stockings girl.

294
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:18,930
- I'm gonna be late, woman.

295
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,600
- You already are, ain't you?

296
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,000
It started at 5:30, right?

297
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,330
Don't y'all forget to be back here

298
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,370
before I have to go to work.

299
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,170
- What are you worried about it for?

300
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,430
Your part-time job ain't going nowhere.

301
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,980
I gotta go to work tonight too.

302
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,280
What's wrong with you little girl?

303
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,783
Me and your mom will be back.

304
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,822
I'm going to warm up the car.

305
00:23:40,822 --> 00:23:43,110
- Look, it's not like me and your father

306
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,700
go out all the time.

307
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,197
Now, you listen to your aunt Janine,

308
00:23:46,197 --> 00:23:48,360
and you do what she tell you to do,

309
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,240
and don't be acting up.

310
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,463
Now, go on over there and
watch TV or something.

311
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,153
I look okay?

312
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:00,851
- Fine.

313
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,340
- Hey, why don't you go play
in your room or something?

314
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,070
My show getting ready to come on.

315
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:25,724
arrived in
Beverly Hills safe and sound.

316
00:24:57,306 --> 00:24:58,139
- No.

317
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:05,862
- Hey, what happened?

318
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,890
Hey, hey, it's me, it's me.

319
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,115
Breathe, breathe,

320
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:14,032
hey, relax.

321
00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:18,635
Just breathe, hold that.

322
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:22,402
It was just a dream.

323
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:25,152
It's just a bad dream, all right.

324
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:28,998
- You act like you trying to help me,

325
00:25:28,998 --> 00:25:30,640
but you just doing your job.

326
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
- Part of my job is to help you, Hettie.

327
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,573
Now, tell me about your mother.

328
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,670
You intimated that she
never listened to you.

329
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,503
- No.

330
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,873
- Why?

331
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,213
- She was just always too
busy with work or whatever.

332
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,370
- Your mother worked then.

333
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,570
- Yes.

334
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,020
- Your father, did he work as well?

335
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,993
- Nights?

336
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,370
- It was just you and your parents.

337
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:09,750
- And aunt Janine.

338
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,550
- You said your aunt lived with you?

339
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,563
Anyone else?

340
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,957
- Felicia would stay sometimes.

341
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:22,650
Why we gotta do this?

342
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,147
Why don't they just kill me already?

343
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:25,350
Why are they dragging it out?

344
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,490
- Okay, let's stay focused, Hettie.

345
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,960
- I don't wanna talk about this no more.

346
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,680
I know. I know it's hard,
but this is the beginning.

347
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,780
It's always hard in the beginning, Hettie.

348
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,743
Now, tell me about Felicia.

349
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,421
- We were like sisters.

350
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:48,217
- You were close.

351
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:53,948
It sounds to me like your
mother had her hands full.

352
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,210
Do you think she was just overwhelmed

353
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,040
with all she had to do?

354
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,573
- She was always busy.

355
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,007
- Well, you could imagine
taking care of you

356
00:27:03,007 --> 00:27:06,020
and your family is a big responsibility.

357
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,430
- She didn't take care of anything.

358
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,050
- She took care of you and your
father, clothed and fed you.

359
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,180
- Clothing and feeding ain't
taking care of your child.

360
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,683
This is all her fault.

361
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,053
- What can't you say, Hettie?

362
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,458
- Can I get some water, please?

363
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,533
- Okay, calm down.

364
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,523
Take a deep breath.

365
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,513
Slowly.

366
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,453
Take a sip.

367
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,723
Better?

368
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,310
What happened, Hettie?

369
00:28:38,362 --> 00:28:40,881
- Look how high I'm going.

370
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:43,609
- Me too, watch Felicia.

371
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:46,442
Now, I'm gonna jump over the moon.

372
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:53,300
- That's not funny.

373
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,133
- Yeah, it is.

374
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:58,270
You okay, I'll go get aunt Ellie.

375
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,103
- I'm okay.

376
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,790
- That's cause you got a hard head.

377
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,240
- Stop it.

378
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,250
- Okay, let's play a game.

379
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,900
- I don't wanna play with
you, you make fun of me.

380
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,660
- I'm sorry, okay, your
head is not that hard.

381
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,110
- Let's play doll though.

382
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,250
- Okay, I don't wanna
be the baldheaded one.

383
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,887
- They're both baldheaded.

384
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,713
- Hettie, your momma calling you.

385
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,793
- Come Felicia.

386
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:33,353
- No, she just wants you.

387
00:29:33,353 --> 00:29:34,970
Felicia can stay here.

388
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,700
Look at this ugly ass doll.

389
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:51,486
Did you do this to this doll?

390
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,530
I heard y'all up here
jumping on that bed again,

391
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,900
weren't you?

392
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,123
- We was just playing.

393
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,590
- Y'all gonna break
them springs on that bed

394
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,683
and cut your feet.

395
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:04,637
Then you won't be jumping
no more, will you?

396
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,723
What time your mama and
them coming to pick you up?

397
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,280
- I know I said I'd have
it to you last Wednesday,

398
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,023
but I'm really close.

399
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,060
I'm on my last case,

400
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,960
and then I should have the
final manuscript ready for you.

401
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,860
You won't be disappointed.

402
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,623
Just bear with me a little longer.

403
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,453
Hey, are you okay?

404
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,643
Where's your mom?

405
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,797
What did he do to you?

406
00:31:44,505 --> 00:31:45,338
No.

407
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,363
- Hey, good morning.

408
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,330
I got you something to eat.

409
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,960
You haven't been eating enough.

410
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,913
- You didn't have to do this, really.

411
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,053
I know, but I want to.

412
00:32:54,793 --> 00:32:56,730
- I really have to get back to work.

413
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,850
- I was thinking maybe
we could get out today

414
00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,910
watch a ball game,

415
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,823
have a couple of hotdogs,
maybe some beers.

416
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,433
Abby, you need to take care of yourself.

417
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,593
- It's just this case.

418
00:33:11,637 --> 00:33:12,470
This case.

419
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:14,923
- Abby, let it go.

420
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,003
Just for today.

421
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,783
Come on.

422
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,693
- Okay.

423
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,741
- No joke, it seriously took
John an hour to find his pants.

424
00:33:38,574 --> 00:33:39,810
- What?

425
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,643
- I'm not kidding.

426
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,476
- Oh my gosh.

427
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:42,790
- I told you that you'd feel better.

428
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,830
Have a good day.

429
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,076
- Yeah.

430
00:33:45,076 --> 00:33:46,714
- I told you, I told you.

431
00:33:46,714 --> 00:33:48,381
I'm right sometimes.

432
00:34:28,977 --> 00:34:30,427
- You always know, don't you?

433
00:34:31,768 --> 00:34:33,935

- Thanks, I've been working out a bit.

460
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,340
- You're a big ham, you know that?

461
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,163
- How are you really doing, Abby?

462
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,110
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

463
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,860
- I'm pulling you off this case.

464
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,150
- Why? Brad, I'm making progress.

465
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,860
- Counter transference anyone?

466
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,770
- I am not emotionally
connected to my client.

467
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,623
- What was that little
episode the other day?

468
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,033
- Not getting enough rest.

469
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,343
Working too hard.

470
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,790
Look, me and Martin are doing better.

471
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,270
I got some rest.

472
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,480
Brad, I am really close.

473
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,893
- Okay, fine.

474
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,670
We need to get the initial
competency hearing scheduled.

475
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,250
Are you close to a report?

476
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,870
- Yes, she's unlike any
client I've ever met,

477
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:59,560
and still demonstrates classic
traits of familial abuse.

478
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,983
- Was she competent enough
for the initial hearing?

479
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,110
- I need another meeting with her.

480
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:14,193
- I don't think that's
such a good idea, Abby.

481
00:38:14,193 --> 00:38:15,888
Are you gonna be okay?

482
00:38:15,888 --> 00:38:18,370
- Mm-hmm..

483
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,297
- Abby, this is me right now.

484
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:23,003
Not defense attorney
Steiner, your friend, Brad.

485
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,043
Seriously Abby.

486
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,810
- Yes, plus there's no time

487
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,810
to get another psychologist on the case.

488
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,463
I'm fine.

489
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,593
- Yeah Rich, what do you want?

490
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,793
You need to get together?
I'm on my way.

491
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,580
- So the initial hearing is not a trial.

492
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,630
It is to determine whether
or not you're competent

493
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,570
and able to stand trial.

494
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,473
Do you understand?

495
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,010
Do you understand that the actual trial

496
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,623
could result in a capital
punishment sentence?

497
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,360
You could be sentenced to death.

498
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,870
- Why is it taking so long?

499
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,400
- Well, first is the report,

500
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,040
and then the initial hearing
where the judge will-

501
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,423
- No, the sentence.

502
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,650
They already got their minds made up.

503
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,790
Why don't they just finish it already?

504
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,990
- Hettie, this isn't something
you should take lightly.

505
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,440
- Is that what you think?

506
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,053
- I would love to know what you think.

507
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:44,220
- No, you don't.

508
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,200
I mean, that all sounds
good for your J-O-B,

509
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,950
but don't nobody really wanna know.

510
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,960
- Hettie, I do wanna know.

511
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,250
You know why?

512
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,823
Because death doesn't
offer second chances.

513
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,263
- Well done.

514
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,470
You get the nuthouse
doctor of the year award.

515
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,033
That life is worth it
and everything speech?

516
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,493
- You get the award for best avoidance.

517
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,310
- What do you want me to say?

518
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,940
What does it matter?

519
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,773
- Justice.

520
00:40:26,773 --> 00:40:28,010
- It ain't no such thing.

521
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:34,160
- So that's it.

522
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,826
You die.
End of story.

523
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,169
- My story's already over.

524
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,563
- Then tell me the final chapter.

525
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,850
You believe you killed your parents.

526
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,584
- I did kill them.

527
00:40:49,584 --> 00:40:51,527
That's what you want me to say, right?

528
00:40:51,527 --> 00:40:52,985
I killed them.

529
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:53,867
I killed them.

530
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,180
I killed them.

531
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,863
- Fine, why?

532
00:41:00,804 --> 00:41:01,637
There you go again.

533
00:41:01,637 --> 00:41:02,470
Running away.

534
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,383
You believe you're gonna die,

535
00:41:04,383 --> 00:41:06,390
so you might as well have your final say.

536
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:08,843
Why?

537
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,823
Why are they dead?

538
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,023
- Perfect.

539
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,153
- Excuse me.

540
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:25,850
- Sunday dinners, maybe a cute
little puppy to play with,

541
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,523
all while daddy is bringing
his little princess presents,

542
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,430
and your only worry is what dress to wear

543
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,103
to some fancy rich girl party.

544
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,860
- Why are your parents dead, Hettie?

545
00:41:44,695 --> 00:41:47,034
What did they do?

546
00:41:47,034 --> 00:41:49,034
Did they drink too much?

547
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,842
Did they ignore on you?

548
00:41:54,103 --> 00:41:56,610
What did they do to make you suffer?

549
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,920
- You can't begin to know my suffering.

550
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,533
- So much suffering that they
paid for with their lives.

551
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:04,412
- Don't-

552
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,793
- Tell me what happened
in that house, Hettie.

553
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,593
This wasn't recent, was it?

554
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,960
How old were you, Hettie?

555
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,780
You were young, weren't you?

556
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:30,405
You were young and you weren't
able to protect yourself,

557
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,187
and it was...

558
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:39,713
All you could do to get through a day.

559
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:59,605
- You've seen the devil too?

560
00:43:00,986 --> 00:43:02,809
You've seen the devil too.

561
00:43:09,598 --> 00:43:12,328
You've seen the devil too.

562
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:13,578
- Guard, hello.

563
00:43:25,173 --> 00:43:26,006
- I know I'm not a gourmet chef,

564
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:27,360
but I don't think it's that bad.

565
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,183
- Sorry.

566
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,390
- What's going on with you today?

567
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,020
- Nothing just I'm trying to-

568
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,313
- It's that case.

569
00:43:50,888 --> 00:43:52,138
- It's nothing.

570
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:10,738
- You've seen the devil too.

571
00:44:10,738 --> 00:44:12,905
You've seen the devil too.

572
00:44:15,773 --> 00:44:17,940
You've seen the devil too.

573
00:44:20,437 --> 00:44:22,604
You've seen the devil too.

574
00:44:25,448 --> 00:44:27,615
You've seen the devil too.

575
00:44:30,547 --> 00:44:32,378
- It's that case.

576
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,061
- A baby is not gonna fix this

577
00:44:34,061 --> 00:44:35,478
- It's that case.

578
00:44:37,573 --> 00:44:38,859
- It's that case.

579
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:40,265
- A baby is not gonna fix this.

580
00:44:40,265 --> 00:44:42,004
- It's that case.

581
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:51,960
You've seen the devil too.

582
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,687
- We don't talk about
those things in my family.

- Hi.

596
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:22,620
I do believe it's getting colder.

597
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,699
Have you done your sweaters out yet?

598
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:25,532
- No.

599
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,520
The weather said it would
be warm for a while.

600
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,520
- What do they know?

601
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:35,073
Let me have this.

602
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:47,610
Look, BB.

603
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,200
Look at the colors in this.

604
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,060
You could redo your
kitchen in these colors.

605
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:58,060
Look, you could place these
around near the windowsill.

606
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:01,823
- I don't know ma'.

607
00:47:01,823 --> 00:47:04,510
I wasn't planning on redoing my kitchen.

608
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:06,290
- Well, it could use some color,

609
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,606
you know, a woman's touch.

610
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:09,683
- What am I?

611
00:47:11,743 --> 00:47:13,370
- Yeah. Well, you were
always such a tomboy,

612
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:15,603
roughhousing with those boys all the time.

613
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,093
Look at this BB.

614
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,570
You could make these curtains

615
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:29,123
and bring the color straight
out to the living room.

616
00:47:30,176 --> 00:47:32,180
- I hate that color, ma'.

617
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,870
- Well you have to
actually see it hanging up.

618
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:34,703
You'll love it.

619
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,340
- Ma', do you remember Allan?

620
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,040
- I wouldn't forget my own nephew.

621
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,720
I could get some yarn and
make some matching potholders.

622
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,723
I think that they have a sale
going on right now at Katie's.

623
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:10,290
- Do you remember how he used
to come over all the time

624
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:13,323
and then just, and stopped?

625
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,600
- Yes, he did.

626
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,073
BB look here.

627
00:48:48,914 --> 00:48:50,343
- Why are you here again?

628
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,370
- I'm gonna keep coming
here to see you, Hettie.

629
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,920
- Why?

630
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,800
- I had them put some money
on your spending account

631
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,140
so you can get some snacks
and buy some magazines.

632
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,450
- I ain't ask you for no money.

633
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:03,480
- The vending machine
snacks are probably better

634
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,100
than the food that's in here.

635
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,100
- Look, you ain't gotta do nothing for me.

636
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,790
- I'll get you one of
those wraparound blankets

637
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,080
that you can put your arms through.

638
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,514
- None of that is gonna matter, soon-

639
00:49:11,514 --> 00:49:12,347
- I'll get you some slippers too.

640
00:49:12,347 --> 00:49:14,260
- Stop. Just stop.

641
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,330
- Hettie.

642
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,970
- Ain't none of that gonna matter soon.

643
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,653
- You are scaring me.

644
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,173
You matter to me.

645
00:49:28,518 --> 00:49:30,590
You're the only one who
can possibly understand

646
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,423
what we've been-

647
00:49:31,423 --> 00:49:32,590
- What?

648
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:33,423
What?

649
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:37,803
- Never mind.

650
00:49:39,385 --> 00:49:40,880
They said I can bring
the blanket next time.

651
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,780
- I don't want it.

652
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,950
- I'm bringing it anyway.

653
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:06,742
- Julie, your mom was here again.

654
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:08,575
- How could you guess?

655
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,370
- Well, she is always trying
to redecorate our house.

656
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,830
- She hates my style or lack thereof.

657
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:17,880
- Well that's because sexy is your style.

658
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:21,610
I'm gonna take a shower.

659
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:22,660
Do you wanna join me?

660
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,425
- No, you stink.

661
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:26,258
- What, what?

662
00:50:26,258 --> 00:50:27,091
- You stink.

663
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:28,757
- No, I don't.
- Seriously, you go take a-

664
00:50:28,757 --> 00:50:29,590
- What?

665
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:30,590
- You stink.

666
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:36,870
- I do stink, okay.

667
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,100
You wanna order takeout tonight?

668
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,233
- 555-41-22.

669
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:21,350
All of these messages are from 555-41-22.

670
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,110
- What are you doing with my phone?

671
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,380
- Picture?

672
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,213
Picture.

673
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,593
And your replies.

674
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:33,773
That's hot.

675
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:36,463
Damn, you're sexy.

676
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:40,500
How about I show you a
little something, something.

677
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:44,313
- Abby, wait.

678
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,010
Calm down.

679
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,720
That's back when we were having issues.

680
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,523
- These messages came through night.

681
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,350
- Why are you going through my phone?

682
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:55,267
- I wasn't.

683
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,407
- It's not what it looked like.

684
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,023
It looked like you were
going through my phone.

685
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,173
- Is that where your ring is?

686
00:52:03,173 --> 00:52:04,006
- What.

687
00:52:04,006 --> 00:52:04,840
- At your girlfriends house.

688
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:06,541
- I lost it at the gym.

689
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:07,374
I told you that.

690
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,693
- I'm not stupid, Martin.

691
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,693
I'm not doing this, Abby.

692
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,343
- I'm not playing this game.

693
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,772
I can't.

694
00:52:20,772 --> 00:52:21,605
I'm done.

695
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,787
- Just when we were doing so well,

696
00:52:24,787 --> 00:52:27,150
you just can't allow yourself
to be happy, can you?

697
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:27,983
Get out.

698
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,482
- Don't-

699
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,315
- Leave.

700
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,360
That was a final report
on the Dallman client.

701
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,960
Could you make sure Steiner gets that?

702
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,060
Okay, thanks.

703
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:11,893
- Excuse me.

704
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,260
Are you Hettie's lawyer?

705
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,080
- I'm her doctor.

706
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,993
I'm sorry, you are?
- I'm her cousin, Felicia.

707
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:25,300
I overheard you saying
something about Hettie.

708
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,180
Could I please speak with you a moment?

709
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,340
- I can't tell you what your
cousin and I speak about.

710
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,250
That would be a HIPAA violation and-

711
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,550
- You don't have to tell me anything.

712
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,943
Just listen, please.

713
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,770
They're gonna kill her, aren't they?

714
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,277
- I can't say what the courts
will or will not decide.

715
00:53:51,447 --> 00:53:53,410
I'm sorry, I have another meeting.

716
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:56,380
- Please, I'm not asking you.

717
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,220
I'm stating a fact.

718
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,543
They're gonna kill her.

719
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:02,340
It's not her fault.

720
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,190
All of this.

721
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,990
She can't help what happened to her.

722
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,570
- You and Hettie were close?

723
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,380
- Like sisters.

724
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,890
She tell you that?

725
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:13,490
- I can't say.

726
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,343
You tell me.

727
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,600
- Doctor-

728
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,460
- Williams.

729
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,900
- Dr. Williams, there are
things we just don't talk about

730
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,250
in my family.

731
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,793
Things we look away from.

732
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,113
Hettie doesn't deserve this.

733
00:54:29,259 --> 00:54:30,459
- What happened Felicia?

734
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:33,270
- You know what's funny,

735
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,780
if a stranger committed a
crime against your child,

736
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,830
you would want him locked under the jail,

737
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,020
but we all look the other
way when it's family.

738
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,053
- Do you think your family
deserve what they got?

739
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,223
- Don't speak unless you're spoken to.

740
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,773
Listen to your elders.

741
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,963
No talking back.

742
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:01,496
You really are at the mercy
of adults as children.

743
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:06,950
- Adults are supposed to be
the protectors of children.

744
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:10,813
- Maybe, but we grew up, we survived it.

745
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,660
- Did you really?

746
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,040
- Maybe they're right.

747
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,353
Nothing we can do can change anything now.

748
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,850
Hettie made her choices.

749
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:23,683
She did this.

750
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,373
She chose this.

751
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,567
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

752
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:34,663
- No more running.

753
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,630
Isn't that the problem though?

754
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,563
You're always running, but
you have nowhere to run to.

755
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,800
- What do you want me to say?

756
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,320
You came to me.

757
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,600
Why?

758
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,583
- To save Hettie.

759
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:51,720
- You wanna save Hettie?

760
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,260
Then you need to talk to me.

761
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,800
What happened in that house?

762
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,460
- You are stepping way over the line.

763
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,310
- What happened in that house?

764
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,760
- What do you think happened?

765
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,957
- It happened to you too, didn't it?

766
00:56:12,613 --> 00:56:16,613
- We don't talk about
those things in my family.

767
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,943
- Hettie is not the only
one guilty here, is she?

768
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:25,640
- Please just save Hettie.

769
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,313
You understand now, right?

770
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,393
You're a doctor.

771
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,983
Please, can't you just help her?

772
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,833
Please.

773
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:01,883
- You're stating that in
your professional opinion,

774
00:57:02,815 --> 00:57:05,000
Dr. Williams, that Hettie
Dallman is a disturbed woman

775
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,550
who needs psychiatric care.

776
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:07,610
- Yes.

777
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:08,443
- Thank you.

778
00:57:16,491 --> 00:57:18,960
- That is exactly what Ms. Dallman

779
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,463
would like you to believe.

780
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,853
- When's the next Academy
Awards Dr. Williams?

781
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,690
I mean, she does deserve the Oscar

782
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:36,000
for best actress in the
portrayal of a psycho.

783
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,020
- Objection.

784
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,210
We have the doctor to
testify against malingering.

785
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:41,322
- Ms Barnes.

786
00:57:41,322 --> 00:57:45,720
- Dr. Williams, you requested
to examine Ms. Dallman

787
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,840
after she brutally murdered
both of her parents.

788
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,440
Can you tell us of her demeanor.

789
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:54,070
- She was unresponsive and distant.

790
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,490
- Unresponsive?

791
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,470
Did she appear to be in shock?

792
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:00,057
- No, but patients like
Ms. Dallman tends to-

793
00:58:00,057 --> 00:58:03,080
- Did she seem to understand
what had happened?

794
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,010
What was your conversation with her?

795
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:07,060
- She didn't say a word.

796
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,140
- Nothing.

797
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,100
Well, did she at least seem upset?

798
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,340
I mean, an ounce of remorse

799
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,430
over blowing her parents to kingdom come?

800
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:17,410
- Judge, your honor, sir.

801
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,990
- Ms. Barnes, I'm not amused.

802
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,840
Ask the question.

803
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,100
- Did Ms. Dallman show any signs

804
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,000
that she understood what she had done?

805
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:31,060
- I cannot ascertain that
on our first meeting,

806
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,070
but Ms. Dallman was not
in a stable, mental state.

807
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:37,220
She suffers from depression, PTSD.

808
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,610
- Yet Dr. Williams,

809
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,460
you stated the defendant to be competent

810
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,550
at the time of the murders.

811
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:43,550
What does this mean?

812
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,470
- It means that she
was in her full faculty

813
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:50,190
when she committed the act, but-

814
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,490
- You said she knew.

815
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,890
She knew what she was doing
when she took the gun,

816
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:57,490
pointed it at her mother
as she shot her first,

817
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:00,950
and then blew her father's
brains out moments after.

818
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:03,610
Am I to understand Dr. Williams

819
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:06,530
that even with PTSD and depression,

820
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:08,590
your report stated the defendant

821
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:10,373
was competent to stand trial.

822
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,850
- On further review on
my report findings, I-

823
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:22,750
- I am asking you again, Dr. Williams,

824
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:26,640
is that the defendant Ms.
Dallman competent to stand trial

825
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,683
for the murders of Samuel
and Eleanor Dallman?

826
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:31,743
Yes or no?

827
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,183
- No.

828
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:40,090
- I'm sorry, can you repeat that please?

829
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:42,003
- No.

830
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,130
- Am I to understand
that you are now changing
your diagnosis doctor?

831
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:51,160
On further examination of the patient,

832
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:55,480
I believe Ms. Dallman was
neither competent then or now.

833
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,560
- Your honor, in lieu
of this new information,

834
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,150
I recommend my client be remanded

835
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:00,784
at the facility for mental health.

836
01:00:00,784 --> 01:00:03,040
- Your honor, this is ridiculous.

837
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,190
- It is clear my client
may not be in a state

838
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:06,470
to continue to trial.

839
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,561
and needs to be examined to determine

840
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:09,610
if she can be restored to competency.

841
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,700
- I don't believe this.

842
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,100
Where'd you find this quack?

843
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,163
- That's not necessary Ms. Barnes.

844
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:21,200
Escort, Ms. Dallman out and
both of you in my chambers now.

845
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,263
- You look tired.

846
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,700
So they're keeping you here longer, right?

847
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:41,643
That's better.

848
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,343
- It's still on locked four walls.

849
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:48,590
I guess you gonna keep coming to see me.

850
01:00:49,496 --> 01:00:51,446
- Do you really want me to stop coming?

851
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,633
I understand why you did it.

852
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:07,093
I think just why didn't you talk to me?

853
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,403
It didn't have to be this.

854
01:01:12,077 --> 01:01:13,854
- You were like my sister.

855
01:01:13,854 --> 01:01:15,017
I still am.

856
01:01:15,017 --> 01:01:17,980
- Out of all of them, you was the one.

857
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:18,813
- Hettie.

858
01:01:18,813 --> 01:01:19,880
- You was the one I was supposed to-

859
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,070
- Hettie. What could I have done?

860
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:25,060
I couldn't save me.

861
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,537
How could I save you?

862
01:01:26,537 --> 01:01:27,520
- Why you leave?

863
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,903
- It was too much.

864
01:01:31,004 --> 01:01:31,837
- My sister.

865
01:01:36,604 --> 01:01:38,020
I couldn't stay.

866
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,673
You know I couldn't stay.

867
01:01:40,806 --> 01:01:44,390
- Out of all of the, you
was my family you knew.

868
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,350
- I didn't know how to face it.

869
01:01:51,529 --> 01:01:55,290
Every day, every day,

870
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,350
I had to pretend like it didn't happen.

871
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:03,310
Heavy on my back like a ton of weights.

872
01:02:05,758 --> 01:02:10,341
I just had to pretend, and
it's right there in my face.

873
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:16,440
It chocked my soul, and
every everybody know,

874
01:02:18,566 --> 01:02:20,598
but don't nobody care.

875
01:02:20,598 --> 01:02:21,993
- What was I supposed to do?

876
01:02:21,993 --> 01:02:23,590
- You weren't supposed
to leave me, Felicia.

877
01:02:27,716 --> 01:02:28,624
- I'm sorry, Hettie.

878
01:02:28,624 --> 01:02:29,845
I'm sorry.

879
01:02:29,845 --> 01:02:33,095
You're not the only one it happened to.

880
01:02:56,674 --> 01:02:58,193
- I'm gonna tell.

881
01:02:58,193 --> 01:02:59,185
I mean it.

882
01:02:59,185 --> 01:03:00,435
I'm gonna tell.

883
01:03:03,257 --> 01:03:05,053
- What that gonna do?

884
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,650
You think they don't know?

885
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:13,780
Why you think they let
me watch you the time?

886
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,880
All I do for you and you ain't nothing

887
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,313
but an ungrateful spoiled little brat.

888
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:24,760
You best not say nothing.

889
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,110
- No guard, I don't wanna see her.

890
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:04,100
- Hettie, please give me-
- You think I'm crazy.

891
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:05,220
- I wanna help you.

892
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,063
- I didn't ask for your help.

893
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,710
- Hettie, there is a way through this.

894
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:11,740
Please, sit.

895
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,840
- Why are you doing this?

896
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:19,983
Why do you even care?

897
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,230
- Tell me more about Felicia.

898
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:25,483
- Why?

899
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,950
- Because I think the same
thing that happened to her

900
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,037
happened to you.

901
01:04:32,305 --> 01:04:33,490
- You leave her out of it.

902
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:34,323
- Fine.

903
01:04:34,323 --> 01:04:35,273
This is about you.

904
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,500
You have to fight this.

905
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,483
- Look, I handled what I needed to.

906
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,063
Why can't you just let this end.

907
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,360
- Hettie, it is not your fault
that this happened to you.

908
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,610
You deserve better.

909
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:53,743
- Maybe I don't.

910
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,580
- Hettie, it doesn't have to end this way.

911
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,930
We can work through this.

912
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:03,653
Please, let me help you.

913
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,163
- Stop touching me.

914
01:05:07,076 --> 01:05:08,630
I don't want your help.

915
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:10,423
Why can't you just leave me alone?

916
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,763
- No more running.

917
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,280
Tell me something, Hettie,

918
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,203
when are you gonna take
control of your own life?

919
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:24,750
- Stupid bitch.

920
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:25,855
You think you got all of my answers.

921
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,269
Did you think the devil too?

922
01:05:27,269 --> 01:05:29,117
I should fucking kill you.

923
01:05:29,117 --> 01:05:34,117
You damn, ass stupid ass
arrogant bitch.

924
01:05:34,777 --> 01:05:37,420
Get your hands off of me.

925
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:41,003
If I catch you in this,
I'm gonna kill you.

926
01:05:51,565 --> 01:05:52,820
- You okay?

927
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:54,754
What the hell are you doing here?

928
01:05:54,754 --> 01:05:56,690
Have you completely lost your mind?

929
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:57,803
- I lost control.

930
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,350
- Loss control is an understatement.

931
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:03,023
You're just as crazy as she is.

932
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:06,220
Come on, let's go.

933
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:10,653
- Wait. I wanna try again
when she calms down.

934
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,760
- You're kidding me.

935
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:15,080
What is it with you in this case?

936
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,343
Why are you doing this?

937
01:06:17,628 --> 01:06:19,400
- Because I am her.

938
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,233
I am her.

939
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:28,895
It's coming back in bits and
pieces, but I don't know.

940
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,073
I think I blocked it.

941
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:36,890
We were just sitting there and watching TV

942
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:40,120
and then I don't know what happened.

943
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,866
- We should go, Abby.

944
01:06:44,866 --> 01:06:45,825
You should see someone.

945
01:06:45,825 --> 01:06:50,825
- I was 15 years old, and I was held down.

946
01:06:54,562 --> 01:06:55,895
I couldn't move.

947
01:06:57,349 --> 01:06:58,182
I couldn't breathe.

948
01:07:04,095 --> 01:07:05,650
time stopped, I couldn't move.

949
01:07:09,637 --> 01:07:10,997
- Come on.

950
01:07:10,997 --> 01:07:14,963
- But I see it now, the
part where I told my mother.

951
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:21,420
I see the pain that was in her eyes,

952
01:07:23,693 --> 01:07:25,360
and you know what she did, nothing.

953
01:07:29,275 --> 01:07:30,858
Absolutely nothing.

954
01:07:41,013 --> 01:07:45,180
She was my mother Steiner,
she was supposed to help me,

955
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,237
but absolutely nothing.

956
01:07:51,757 --> 01:07:52,973
- I'm sorry, Abby.

957
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:02,456
Why don't you go.

958
01:08:37,856 --> 01:08:39,370
- You son of a bitch.

959
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:40,653
- Dear. God,

960
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:44,700
- Mom, what are you doing here?

961
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,433
- Almost having a heart attack.

962
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:50,569
- I'm sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

963
01:08:50,569 --> 01:08:53,710
- I was coming to bring you
clay cats for the windowsill.

964
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:57,930
- Ma', the clay cats look like
a five-year-old made them.

965
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,233
Don't put them on the window.

966
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,053
- You've been drinking too much.

967
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:30,860
- No, ma', I'm still conscious.

968
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,570
- Where's Martin?

969
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:34,020
- Gone.

970
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,683
- Gone, gone where?

971
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:40,830
- He's a cheating asshole, so he's gone.

972
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:43,193
- Abigail, now you
watch your tone with me.

973
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,083
Well, you're not getting a divorce.

974
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:51,997
You two will work this out.

975
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,413
He may wander a bit, but
he'll come back home.

976
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:04,960
I'm gonna make you some coffee.

977
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,433
You need to straighten up.

978
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:16,263
- You said he'll come back.

979
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:19,963
Well, what if I don't want him back?

980
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:23,279
- That's the bottle talking.

981
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:24,883
The two of you will work this out.

982
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,110
- I just wanted to help her.

983
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:30,940
I couldn't even do that.

984
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,370
- Who?

985
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:34,400
- Hettie, that's who.

986
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,733
- Well, who's Hettie?

987
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,890
- The one like me, like me.

988
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:41,043
- Calm down.

989
01:10:43,916 --> 01:10:45,466
- And I couldn't even help her.

990
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:48,460
I can't even help me.

991
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:51,360
- You can't help someone that
doesn't wanna be helped, BB.

992
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:06,831
- Do you remember when
I told you about, Allan?

993
01:11:06,831 --> 01:11:08,273
- Why are you bringing that up?

994
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:15,823
- You remember when I
told you he did to me?

995
01:11:20,106 --> 01:11:21,420
Do you remember that?

996
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:22,980
- I don't wanna talk about it.

997
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,780
I just assumed you forget that name.

998
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:30,264
- Forget.

999
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:35,293
I forgot, and I buried it deep, deep.

1000
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,483
- BB, leave the past in the past.

1001
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,431
- But I can't ma'.

1002
01:11:52,431 --> 01:11:54,323
Don't you see the past is the present?

1003
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:58,430
- Those statues would have looked so nice

1004
01:11:58,430 --> 01:11:59,643
on this windowsill.

1005
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:04,420
- Stop it.

1006
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,883
You don't get to pretend anymore.

1007
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,220
- I'm not pretending.

1008
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:11,790
There's no use going on about things

1009
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:14,033
that happened over 15 years ago.

1010
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,900
- Get over it.

1011
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,520
Let it go.

1012
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,793
It's in the past.

1013
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,530
- Here, you need to drink this.

1014
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,687
- Tell me how you did it ma'.

1015
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,080
Tell me how you lived with
yourself all these years

1016
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:51,930
and knew that your 15-year-old daughter

1017
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:53,850
was raped by your nephew.

1018
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:54,683
- Stop it.

1019
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:02,210
- That he held her down
and took her innocence.

1020
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,120
- Stop it.

1021
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,443
Stop talking.

1022
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:09,223
- That you didn't do
a damn thing about it.

1023
01:13:15,672 --> 01:13:16,755
- I couldn't.

1024
01:13:18,198 --> 01:13:19,031
- What?

1025
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:25,563
- I didn't wanna believe
he was my sister's child.

1026
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:29,203
I couldn't change what happened.

1027
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:35,373
I thought it's best that
you forget and move on.

1028
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,430
What did you want me to do?

1029
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:42,380
What was I supposed to do?

1030
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:44,633
You were supposed to admit it.

1031
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:47,192
Admit that it happened.

1032
01:13:47,192 --> 01:13:49,600
- , and turn in my own nephew?

1033
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,940
Send our family to jail?

1034
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:55,123
- I was your family too.

1035
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:59,070
- Don't you think that it broke my heart

1036
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:01,043
knowing what he did to you?

1037
01:14:03,223 --> 01:14:04,733
I couldn't admit it.

1038
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:06,683
I won't.

1039
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:10,843
My little girl.

1040
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:15,393
My baby girl.

1041
01:14:19,117 --> 01:14:19,950
I'm sorry.

1042
01:14:26,063 --> 01:14:27,146
I'm so sorry.

1043
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:43,400
- All rise.

1044
01:14:51,026 --> 01:14:52,526
You can be seated.

1045
01:14:56,807 --> 01:14:58,350
Good afternoon.

1046
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:02,400
We are reconvening to determine
the defendant's competency

1047
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,010
for trial after the
specified period of time

1048
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:08,760
in the mental health facility.

1049
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,910
- Yes, your honor.

1050
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:13,300
- I have reviewed several reports
from the facility doctors,

1051
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,860
and they believe Ms. Dallman
is restored to competency

1052
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:17,740
for this trial.

1053
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:19,940
- Your honor, the defense believes

1054
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:22,350
that Ms. Dallman may still
be a danger to herself,

1055
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:23,810
and to others.

1056
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,460
This trial may heighten that state.

1057
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,160
- The hospital staff psychiatrist

1058
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:30,000
has declared her able
to continue to trial.

1059
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,070
Are we now refuting?

1060
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:32,770
This is still the case your honor.

1061
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:35,650
- Unless you have evidence,

1062
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:38,100
to the contrary, Mr. Steiner,

1063
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,633
the hospital findings will stay.

1064
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:49,183
- Your honor.

1065
01:15:49,183 --> 01:15:52,600
If I may, my client would
like to address the court

1066
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,453
on her behalf.

1067
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:56,190
- You do understand Ms. Dallman

1068
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:59,693
this is not an official testimony,
and we are not in trial.

1069
01:16:21,832 --> 01:16:24,090
- I see you, Ms. Prosecutor.

1070
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:25,290
You think I'm a monster?

1071
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,670
- You're a grown woman, Hettie.

1072
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:30,060
You made your choices.

1073
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,330
- You don't know nothing about my choices.

1074
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:36,053
- I know everything
about you, Ms. Dallman.

1075
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:40,456
Moving from job to job and from man to...

1076
01:16:40,456 --> 01:16:43,670
I'm sorry, woman to woman as well.

1077
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:45,300
- Your honor, I think we can end this now

1078
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,157
and let the trial court take it from here.

1079
01:16:48,157 --> 01:16:51,300
- Ms. Barnes.
- You dropped out of high
school, continued to leech...

1080
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:53,780
I'm sorry, live off of your parents,

1081
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:55,790
and the only way that you
could see to thank them

1082
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:57,190
was to blow their brains out.

1083
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,023
- Charlene, that's enough.

1084
01:16:58,023 --> 01:17:00,530
- Wait, you get everything.

1085
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:01,760
Don't you, Hettie?

1086
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,220
You get the money, you get the house,

1087
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:04,774
and you get the little dog too, right?

1088
01:17:04,774 --> 01:17:07,367
- You don't know shit.

1089
01:17:07,367 --> 01:17:08,887
- Order.

1090
01:17:08,887 --> 01:17:09,720
Order.

1091
01:17:14,519 --> 01:17:15,352
Adjourn.

1092
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:40,110
- Brad, I'm sorry.

1093
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:42,260
- You really don't have
to apologize, Abby.

1094
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,843
- I put you in an awkward situation,

1095
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:49,570
and my credibility is all but shot.

1096
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:51,020
- You'll come back from this.

1097
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:53,903
I wonder.

1098
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:56,663
What of Hettie?

1099
01:17:58,419 --> 01:18:00,260
- It's up to the jury now.

1100
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,340
- Do you think any justice
will come out of it?

1101
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:03,560
- I don't know, Abby.

1102
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,220
All I can do is present what I can prove

1103
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,020
and leave the rest up to the system.

1104
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:10,060
- It still doesn't change anything.

1105
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:16,900
Tell me, do you think a family
that looks the other way

1106
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,020
when a child is abused is just as guilty

1107
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,620
as the perpetrator of the crime?

1108
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,823
How many lives are ruined and for what?

1109
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,013
Family honor?

1110
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:31,763
It's family shame.

1111
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:35,640
- I don't know.
Maybe people really do
need to let go of stuff

1112
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,130
that happened over 20 years ago.

1113
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,330
Just get on with their lives.

1114
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:40,880
What does it matter now anyway?

1115
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:44,208
- Ask Hettie.

- Beauty is spelled A-B-B-Y.

1139
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,413
- I don't think that line will
work on me anymore, Martin.

1140
01:22:16,774 --> 01:22:18,550
- I've been looking all over for you.

1141
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:19,930
- Well, you found me.

1142
01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:20,763
Now what?

1143
01:22:26,930 --> 01:22:29,480
- Abby, I never cheated on you.

1144
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,620
It all started with a flirtation

1145
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,700
and then she started
sending these pictures

1146
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,300
and things got out of hand.

1147
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,163
I am so sorry.

1148
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:43,020
- I can't deal with this right now.

1149
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:47,290
I've been going through a lot,

1150
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:49,440
and I just don't think
I have the strength.

1151
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:52,990
- Hey, let me be here for you.

1152
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:53,960
Let me be your strength.

1153
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,033
Let me be your rock.

1154
01:22:58,784 --> 01:23:00,400
- You can't fix this with a joke Martin.

1155
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,690
You have no idea what I've been through.

1156
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:04,923
- Well, tell me, clue me in.

1157
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:11,163
- There are things in my past.

1158
01:23:14,979 --> 01:23:17,730
I've just had a lot of
things come to the surface,

1159
01:23:17,730 --> 01:23:21,003
and my emotions are all over the place.

1160
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:23,480
I just can't deal with this.

1161
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:26,860
I can't deal with us in
the midst of all this.

1162
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:29,400
- Hey, you don't get to walk away.

1163
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,433
You don't get to throw us away.

1164
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:34,720
Now, I know I may not exactly understand

1165
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,690
what you're going through,

1166
01:23:35,690 --> 01:23:37,250
but that doesn't mean
I wanna throw us away

1167
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:38,613
in the midst of this.

1168
01:23:39,869 --> 01:23:40,702
I don't think I can-

1169
01:23:40,702 --> 01:23:42,690
- Okay. I get it.

1170
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:43,630
The husband and wife thing

1171
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:45,550
isn't really working out right now.

1172
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:47,760
You don't have to focus on that.

1173
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:48,760
Here, just...

1174
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:56,060
How about we try the best friends thing.

1175
01:23:57,647 --> 01:24:00,780
You always were my best friend.

1176
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:03,480
Just let me be your friend through this.

1177
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,940
Try and love me as that for now.

1178
01:24:17,014 --> 01:24:18,347
- Let's go home.

1179
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,730
Yes, fine. Thanks.

1180
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:46,970
Yes, the manuscript is ready for you.

1181
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:48,820
You should have it by Monday morning.

1182
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:53,053
No, I'm gonna be taking some time off.

1183
01:24:55,653 --> 01:24:56,759
Well, thank you.

1184
01:24:56,759 --> 01:24:57,592
Okay, bye.

1185
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:18,100
- This case has been a unique one.

1186
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:22,340
In fact, our client is clearly
showing signs of aggression

1187
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:23,673
and possible PTSD.

1188
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:28,800
However, the defendant's
mental state of mind

1189
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,043
at the time of the alleged
murder is currently the question.

1190
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:38,180
The prosecution has presented
evidence that may suggest

1191
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:41,183
the client is malingering
to escape the problem.

1192
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,970
I do not believe that to be the case.

1193
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:50,210
However, I do think the
defendant was well aware

1194
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:52,370
of her actions at the time of the murders.

1195
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:53,203
- No.

1196
01:25:53,203 --> 01:25:55,490
- I find the defendant
competent to stand trial.

1197
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:00,323
- Hettie.

1198
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:04,873
- Wait, wait.

1199
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,260
Did you ever tell your parents?

1200
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:09,853
Did anyone ever know, Hettie?

1201
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:17,303
- We don't talk about things
like that in my family.
