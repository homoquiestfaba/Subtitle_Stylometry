1
00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:02,500
This program is rated G

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:07,300
and is suitable for
general audiences.

3
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,133
Hi, I'm Todd Harper.

4
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:29,266
And I hope you'll join
me as we make Hawaii

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,800
our Next Destination, only
on The Expedition Channel.

6
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:38,934
Marty, I need to, oh, Paige,
what are you doing here?

7
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:40,734
I'm seeing if there's
anything we can salvage

8
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,567
from this Hawaii promo.

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,300
Marty's the one that's supposed
to be sitting here alone

10
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:47,633
in the dark, trying to see
if we can save anything.

11
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:50,734
You're a producer,
you're allowed sunlight

12
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:53,567
Millie, you're shooting
in Hawaii in three weeks,

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,433
and we don't have a host.

14
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,867
No one gets sunlight until
we solve that little problem.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,533
Well, the network is
not gonna give Todd,

16
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,300
the salary he wants,

17
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:05,033
or the bigger dressing, room
or the bigger, wardrobe budget.

18
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,367
Well, then we need
to replace him.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,600
Well, I have submitted everyone,

20
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:11,100
with even the slightest
on-camera experience

21
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:12,600
on a travel show.

22
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:14,500
And they have rejected
almost everyone.

23
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:19,266
I think the only one
I haven't sent them, is you.

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,100
I don't host shows
anymore, remember?

25
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:22,834
You miss being
in front of the camera.

26
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,333
Don't tell me you don't.

27
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:27,300
I am perfectly content
behind the scenes.

28
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:29,633
Just not these scenes.

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,533
Come on, Millie, stop.

30
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,367
Next Destination
was your idea.

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,700
I wanna be executive producer
of a show that I created.

32
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:41,834
Well, they haven't said no.

33
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,834
No, not yet, but hang on!

34
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:50,834
You said almost,
almost everyone,
rejected almost everyone.

35
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:53,500
Is there somebody
they're considering?

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,767
Ben Burton?
You're kidding, right?

37
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,934
Well, he co-hosted the
first season with Todd,

38
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,767
and the network thinks
the viewers will love it
if he comes back.

39
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,066
I mean, you remember
him, don't you?

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,900
No, he left before I started,

41
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:17,900
but you told me how difficult
he was, you fired him.

42
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:20,233
Paige, we need a host.

43
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:22,000
If he's gonna help
us with our ratings,

44
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,734
he might be worth the trouble.

45
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:26,533
He is all about the stunt
and nothing of substance.

46
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:30,033
Is he even gonna be happy,
if he can't jump off things?

47
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,700
He doesn't only jump off things.

48
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:34,834
Who's ready to jump off a cliff?

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,667
Hey everybody, it's Ben Burton.

50
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Welcome to another
episode of Bold World.

51
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,700
Today, we are live streaming
from beautiful Belize,

52
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,900
because one of our viewers,
Jessies_Girl1944,

53
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,400
said that this was
one of the best spots,

54
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:52,533
on the entire planet
to go cliff diving.

55
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:56,500
And as you can see, it is
a long ways down to that water.

56
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:58,166
I can't get the shot from here.

57
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,266
Of course you can't
get the shot from here,

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,333
you gotta come around to here.

59
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,834
Oh no, I'm not going anywhere
near the edge of that cliff.

60
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:06,834
Luis, we're live
in 10 minutes, man,

61
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,633
you gotta find your spot.

62
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:11,967
No, I found a spot, just not
anywhere near that cliff.

63
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,166
Luis, the name of
the show is Bold World.

64
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,400
You gotta be bold, it's
right there in the title.

65
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:23,900
Yeah well, my idea
of being bold,

66
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,800
does not involve me
jumping off a cliff,

67
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:29,266
because somebody named
"Jessies_Girl1944" told me to.

68
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,934
Its probably not
even her real name.

69
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:34,100
Ben, you gotta take this
Next Destination gig.

70
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,967
They haven't offered
it to me yet.

71
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,934
And the truth is, I don't
know what I'm gonna say

72
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,066
even if they do.

73
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,900
You kidding me? You say yes.

74
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:43,734
I'm doing my own thing.

75
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:45,667
I like being able to go
anywhere, at a moment's notice,

76
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,567
and not have to follow
a script, I did that before.

77
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,433
Remember how that went?

78
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,734
The one thing I learned is that
I belong off the beaten path.

79
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:54,633
Well, that cliff
is too far off the path.

80
00:03:56,934 --> 00:03:59,734
Look, Ben Burton
is our only option right now.

81
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:02,734
It's either him,
or I submit you.

82
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's get back out there,
see the world--

83
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:08,000
No, this, this is how I like
to see the world these days.

84
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,367
Why are you pushing this?

85
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,800
Because I care
about your happiness,

86
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:17,900
and-- ughh! --
Roger in Accounting says,

87
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:20,000
I need to be more sensitive
to people's "feelings."

88
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:21,633
I mean, why would he say that?

89
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:24,800
Because you put the word
"feelings" in air quotes.

90
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:27,900
Okay, well, I'm not that
crazy about Ben Barton either.

91
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,734
But, if you don't
want to audition,

92
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:31,633
we don't have any other choice.

93
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:33,867
Okay, Millie, do you know
why Todd Harper was so popular?

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Because he's British and
people take him more seriously?

95
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:40,166
No--
Okay, yes, partly that.

96
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,800
But it's mostly

97
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:44,033
because people felt
like they could trust him.

98
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,633
They knew the things
Todd recommended,

99
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:47,967
would give them
a great vacation,

100
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,166
that would put them
in a great mood.

101
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,133
Not put them in the hospital.

102
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:55,734
Okay, I understand
how you "feel"--
Mm...

103
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:58,166
But you still have to see Ben.

104
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,967
I have to see him?

105
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,400
You already set up an audition?

106
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,066
Well, I've already
talked to him.

107
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,800
And everybody at
the Expedition Channel
is on board,

108
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,400
they just wanna
see him on film,

109
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:09,633
and make sure
he can behave himself.

110
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,934
You can handle this, sis.

111
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,467
-Hey--
-Hub-bub.

112
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:17,934
Now remember, you can
only cliff dive,

113
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,700
from certified jump locations.

114
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:25,367
Please, get some training
before you do it.

115
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,467
Okay.

116
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,400
Wha-ha-ha-hoo!

117
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:40,633
Here we go! Okay!

118
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:48,567
How's Hawaii?

119
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,900
Amazing. I'm
on the beach right now.

120
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,433
You should be here.

121
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:53,033
Well, I should be anywhere,

122
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,700
other than doing
an audition for Ben Burton.

123
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,467
It'll be
great, I promise.

124
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,367
Did you get the reel I sent
for his director, Luis Fuentes?

125
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,266
Yes I did, it's fantastic.

126
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,333
We should get him
to do the Hawaii episodes,

127
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,633
even if-- you know--
Ben doesn't work out.

128
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:07,367
First,
they're a package deal.

129
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,667
And second, we're filming
in two weeks.

130
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,500
So this needs to work, be nice.

131
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:13,133
I am always nice.

132
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,934
I can't see you.

133
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,000
Did you just do air quotes
when you said that?

134
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,333
Goodbye, Millie.

135
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,166
What, are you nervous?

136
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,934
Nervous, me?
I dove with sharks.

137
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:24,667
Oh, I know. I was there.

138
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,166
I was the guy in the water
next to you, screaming.

139
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,133
All I'm saying
is that, compared to that,

140
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,767
this is gonna be a cakewalk.

141
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,367
All I gotta do,
is go in there,

142
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,834
and be my normal, charming self.
That's it, right?

143
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:39,500
Well, being your
normal, charming self,

144
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,867
is what got you fired
from this job the first time.

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,800
So maybe just
dial it back just a bit.

146
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:45,033
You don't wanna get
into creative differences,

147
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,500
before you even have the job.

148
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:48,900
Okay.

149
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,700
Ben, Luis, hi,
I'm Paige Marshall.

150
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:54,867
Paige, Ben Burton.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,700
Luis Fuentes, nice to meet you.

152
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:00,734
Luis, I saw your demo reel.
Fantastic work, loved it.

153
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:02,800
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

154
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,233
Did you get
a chance to see mine?

155
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:09,734
Yes, thank you
for sending it in.

156
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,600
So, I'm gonna talk
to Ben first,

157
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:13,767
and then you and I can chat
afterwards, how about that?

158
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,700
-All right, I'll be right here.
-All right, shall we?

159
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:20,066
We shall. Hey, you look really
familiar to me. Have we met?

160
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Nope. I don't think so.

161
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,500
No, no, no, no, definitely,

162
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,367
I've seen you somewhere before.

163
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,166
I just have
one of those faces.

164
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,100
Anyway, so you may have
noticed a lot has changed

165
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,934
about the show
since you last hosted.

166
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:34,433
For instance, instead of
doing a different location

167
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,400
every episode, we now
focus all eight episodes

168
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:38,533
of the season
on one destination.

169
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,233
-Yeah, I've seen the show.
-Oh.

170
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:42,734
Yeah. It's very, uh, in-depth.

171
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,500
Yeah, well
we think that's better

172
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,033
than lacking in substance.

173
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,000
Right, Ben why don't
you take a seat?

174
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:54,867
Okay. Uh, you know what?
I'm gonna, I'm gonna stand.

175
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,333
I don't know,
I'm more of a stand guy.

176
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:00,934
Sure. Yep, absolutely.

177
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:03,934
I will just get
that out of your way.

178
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,633
I coulda have done
that, but yeah.

179
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,400
No, that's fine, I got it.

180
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,600
So, thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

181
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:11,333
Although, I guess
you're used to picking up,

182
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:13,467
and going wherever
the audience tells you.

183
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,100
That is a common misconception,

184
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:17,100
but yes-- we do allow
the audience to think that.

185
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,166
What does that mean?

186
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,767
Well, they make suggestions

187
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,600
but I choose where
we're gonna go next.

188
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,166
I thought the whole point
of Bold World was that,

189
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,266
there's no script.

190
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,100
Forget itineraries, and just go.

191
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:28,633
Yeah, and once I choose
where we're gonna go,

192
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,133
the rest is
very much off-the-cuff.

193
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:33,133
I find that it works
a little better that way.

194
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, okay, but on
a big show like this,

195
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,834
we need to take things
a little more seriously,

196
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:40,400
and have a plan.

197
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,500
Well, what I've learned
on my little show,

198
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:46,000
is that if we're too structured,
it kind of loses that sense

199
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,300
of adventure and spontaneity,
ya know?

200
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,100
You can plan for spontaneity.

201
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:52,166
Mm... can you?
I don't think so.

202
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,767
It's like saying "working
vacation". It's an oxymoron.

203
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,500
-You can't have both.
-Sure you can.

204
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:59,100
Just requires a little bit
of discipline.

205
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:01,333
And where is the fun
in that? Hmm?

206
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:02,867
I remember one time
we were shooting Bold World

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,800
in Costa Rica.
I saw your Costa Rica episodes.

208
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:07,800
And while you were busy,
uh, running, screaming,

209
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:09,800
being chased by a crocodile.

210
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:14,033
Ah, ah, ah, I wasn't screaming.
That was Luis. I don't scream.

211
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,467
Right. Uh, well,
you missed some things

212
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,467
that every traveler should see.

213
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,734
Because you were too busy
being Mr. Danger.

214
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:23,066
Uh-huh.

215
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,367
What about Pani Popo?

216
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
What about Pani Popo?

217
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,633
Mike, it's Millie.

218
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,867
I have something I think
the network is going

219
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,300
to want to see.

220
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,333
I don't understand.

221
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:40,033
This season in Hawaii,
you and Ben,

222
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,967
will be co-hosts
for Next Destination.

223
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,967
Explain that again?

224
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,800
The network saw the footage
of the two of you together,

225
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:48,033
and they really enjoyed
the back and forth.

226
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,967
You mean, where we argued
for 10 minutes straight?

227
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,734
Banter, they love it.

228
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:53,367
Listen, this is
just a one-season deal.

229
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,133
So, if it goes well,

230
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:57,233
they'll consider letting
you do it by yourself.

231
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:59,000
Why can't he just
do it by himself?

232
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,467
The network thinks
he's stronger with you.

233
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,233
Plus, they think you can
help keep him in line.

234
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:07,166
So now I'm his babysitter?
No, you know what, Millie?

235
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,166
I cannot host
a show again.

236
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,734
You know what
happened last time.

237
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:12,500
Ah, that was years ago.

238
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,633
-Everyone's forgotten
about that.
-I haven't.

239
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:17,967
Paige, you're not gonna
be doing this by yourself.

240
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,066
Ben's gonna be there,
I'm gonna be there.

241
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,233
This is gonna go so far

242
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,166
in showing that
you're a team player,

243
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,734
you are saving
Next Destination.

244
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:30,533
And the network
is going to remember that,

245
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,300
when they are deciding

246
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,233
on whether or not
to pick up your new show.

247
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,867
Plus, you can still do
Bold World in between seasons.

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,400
This is gonna be
such great publicity.

249
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:41,400
-I'm sorry, Millie,
absolutely no.
-Hard pass.

250
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,934
This was a terrible idea.

251
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,100
What if what happened
to me the last time

252
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:25,867
I was on camera
happens again?

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,700
How could it possibly
happen again?

254
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,767
We are in a Hawaii bubble
of luxury resorts,

255
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,800
and fine dining restaurants
and surfers.

256
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:35,767
We're never gonna be
anywhere near a goat.

257
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,967
Hey, whoa! Whoa, chip--
Don't say that.

258
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,700
Oh, no! Ay.

259
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:48,266
-What are you watching?
-Oh! Luis you have
got to see this.

260
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,867
This is the greatest thing

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,934
in the history of
the world, watch that.

262
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:54,300
Here I am at
the Dunfield Goat Farm,

263
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:55,800
a great destination
for the whole family.

264
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:57,467
Just wait.

265
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,133
And here we have a little
group of goats right now here.

266
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:03,433
So you-- Oh!

267
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:06,433
No! Stay back!
Don't, don't, don't! Help!

268
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,367
I knew it, I knew
I recognized her!

269
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,767
The minute I saw her,
I knew it.

270
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,700
This video has 10 million views.

271
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,133
I'm gonna make it 11.
Oh...

272
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:20,166
Ben, this isn't funny.

273
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,967
What, not funny?

274
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,300
She's been chased
by screaming goats.

275
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,867
Luis, I'm gonna level
with you, pal,
you were right.

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,867
I was nervous
about this gig,

277
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,133
because it's been a long time
since I've done this kinda job.

278
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:36,000
And I was a little worried,
about looking like a joke.

279
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:38,867
But now with this, now
I know I'm not the only one,

280
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,467
who got caught on camera
making a fool of themselves.

281
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,934
I'll show everybody some
of my most embarrassing clips.

282
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,467
I'm a big laugh,
it will be great.

283
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,133
Ben, listen to me,
this isn't Bold World.

284
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,967
Oh, man.
You're not by yourself anymore.

285
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,467
You have to learn
how to be a team player.

286
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,767
Bringing up the goat lady,

287
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,767
is absolutely not
the way to do that.

288
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,633
So, promise me?

289
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:00,133
Fine, I promise.

290
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,266
Hey!

291
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,033
Hello, what's so funny?

292
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:23,333
Nothing. Nothing's funny,
just videos, watching videos.

293
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,867
Silly videos
of uh... cats.

294
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,266
-Cats on skateboards.
-High comedy.

295
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,367
Yes. Yep, I see
you're going to get ice.

296
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,834
Uh, yeah.
Ordered some room service.

297
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,600
Now I'm going
to watch a documentary
about Muhammad Ali.

298
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:43,233
Oh, great, the champ.
The original G.O.A.T.

299
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,000
A goat, like G.O.A.T.?
"Greatest of All Time."

300
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:48,567
Kids are saying it
all the time.

301
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,200
Sort of a saying.
I got a headache.
I gotta go.

302
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,266
Okay, we are on
a tight schedule, people.

303
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,266
We do an episode
every two to three days,

304
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,967
and we do them in order.

305
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,000
So that means overview
first, resort second,

306
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:11,000
restaurants third,
et cetera,

307
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,400
and Ben-- question.

308
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,967
Yes, I was just
wondering what we do.

309
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,934
if we come across like
a really great opportunity.

310
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,500
I mean, I remember
this one time.

311
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:20,800
Remember when we came
across that place?

312
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:22,567
I think it was Spain,
and that lady--

313
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,133
So we save two days at
the end, for any re-shoots,

314
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,400
or to add anything
we need-- Trust me.

315
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,767
We know what we're doing.

316
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,100
-I'm just--
-That makes total sense.

317
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:33,600
And we're both very happy
to be on the team, right, Ben?

318
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:36,800
Yep. Yep, super-happy to be
on the team, very excited.

319
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:39,934
Okay, great, well have
a terrific season, everyone.

320
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:42,633
Yay, all right.

321
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:44,133
Okay, just like
we rehearsed it,

322
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,467
Ben, opening lines,
welcome to Hawaii.

323
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,233
Then you're gonna
sweep your arms out

324
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:49,800
and reveal the beautiful view.

325
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,767
-Yep.
-Absolutely, we can do this.

326
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,400
Oh, ah...

327
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:55,000
Ben, do you need more time
with your lines?

328
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,967
I know you missed
a few during rehearsal.

329
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,300
No, no, no, no. It's not
that I just, I don't know,

330
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,166
should we change it up
a little, don't you think?

331
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,133
Change it up how, why?

332
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:09,734
Well, if I'm being honest,
I felt a little flat. Right?

333
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,867
I mean, maybe
we should improvise.

334
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We don't improvise,
that's why we've got a script.

335
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:16,533
Right, Millie?

336
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,300
But sometimes you get
really great stuff,

337
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:19,867
when you don't stick
to the script, right Luis?

338
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,333
Uhhhh...

339
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,200
Okay, a lot of research
has gone into this,

340
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,133
so we need to do it
the way it's written.

341
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:28,367
Come on,
let's just give it
a try, see what happens.

342
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,533
Unless, of course, you have
something against fun.

343
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:36,333
Nope, sure, let's give it a go.

344
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,400
Okay, baba baba baba,
wawawa.

345
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:41,834
All right, you look great.

346
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,800
-Great big smiles.
-And... action!

347
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:47,033
-Hey everybody, welcome to...
-I'm Paige Marshall--

348
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,400
Okay! Still rolling.

349
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,867
Mm-hmm. Okay, here we go,
here it comes.

350
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,633
-Hey everyone, I'm Ben Burton.
-This beautiful scene--

351
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:56,133
Hey, we're relaxing,
we're having fun.

352
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:58,166
Yeah, but I'm not having fun.
Is anyone having fun?

353
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,567
Can we just go back to
the script? Please, Millie?

354
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,633
Okay, yes, let's do that.

355
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:05,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
God, that script.

356
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:07,133
Still rolling, go ahead.

357
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:12,233
Stunning beaches, luxurious
resorts, bustling nightlife.

358
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:15,300
-You missed "incredible food"?
-What now?

359
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,967
Would you say "incredible food"?
I say "bustling nightlife",

360
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,433
sunny beaches, luxurious
resorts, incredible food.

361
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:23,967
-Do you wanna take a look?
-No, I'm good.

362
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,934
Okay, when you're ready.

363
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:27,867
Still exciting, here it comes.

364
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,767
Do you wanna count us in?

365
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,200
[I'll just take it
on my own, here we go.

366
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:38,934
Stunning beaches, luxurious
resorts, delicious food.

367
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,400
Bustling nightlife,
colorful local culture,

368
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,200
and some of the most beautiful
scenery in the world.

369
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,767
I'm Ben Burton--
...and I'm Paige Marshall.

370
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,100
And this is our...

371
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:53,900
This is our Next Destination.

372
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,934
I was thinking about that "our".
Should the "our" be a "your"?

373
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,700
What?

374
00:16:57,834 --> 00:16:59,367
Right now we're saying
"our" next destination,

375
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,200
but if we say "your",
then it makes the audience

376
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,333
feel like
we're taking them along
for the ride, right?

377
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,767
Todd always said our.
"Our next destination."

378
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,200
That's how it's always been
on the show.

379
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,367
We're not Todd.

380
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,700
Okay, well this is what you get,
for trying to have a little fun.

381
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:15,133
Oh, I'm so sorry, I forgot
we didn't have time to have fun.

382
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:18,000
This is gonna be
a long three weeks.

383
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,033
Yeah.

384
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:27,400
Don't worry,
we can fix this.

385
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,133
Great, who are the new hosts?

386
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:31,567
Listen one of the reasons why
you are such a great producer,

387
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,734
is that you know
how to put out fires.

388
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,367
So now Ben and me
hosting together,

389
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,867
has become
such a disaster.

390
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,934
It's a blaze
I have to extinguish?

391
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:40,300
I didn't say it's a blaze.

392
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:43,133
Small fire,
a little bit of smoke.

393
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:45,367
I should just quit before
it burns the whole house down.

394
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,400
The network thinks
the show is gonna be stronger

395
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,867
with the both of you, and
you're not gonna quit this one.

396
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,767
I don't know, maybe
I'll just live here
in a hut,

397
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,633
selling seashells
by the seashore.

398
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:57,800
How cute-- no!
What you need to do,

399
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:01,400
is talk to Ben and find out
his point of view on this.

400
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:08,800
Okay, lets have it,
you were behind the camera,

401
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:10,600
what do you think?

402
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:13,200
That I'm smart enough not
to tell the hosts of the show,

403
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,200
what I really thought
of their performance?

404
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,967
That bad, huh?

405
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,300
At least you should understand
where she's coming from.

406
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,934
Fair enough, I guess
I should talk to her.

407
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:25,033
Tell her that I'll try
to be more considerate

408
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,633
of how she works.

409
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:29,000
Yeah, easy. I can do that.
That's a good idea.

410
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:32,033
Thanks, Luis.
See you later, bud.

411
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,500
That's okay,
I'll get the check.

412
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,500
Thank you for the walk with me.

413
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:41,533
Yes, we've got
a couple of hours off,

414
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,367
and I wanted to
talk to you as well.

415
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,367
Good, okay, well, I'll go
first if you don't mind.

416
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,333
Obviously we got off
on the wrong foot.

417
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:53,333
And I think, because we have
to work with each other,

418
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,767
we should really try and
get in step with each other.

419
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,633
Put out the fire,
so to speak.

420
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:00,100
I completely agree.

421
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:03,000
Exactly, we agree. Progress.

422
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,367
Now the million-dollar
question is,

423
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,500
-what do we do about it?
-Yeah.

424
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:11,567
Well, like you said,
we have a little bit of time.

425
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,033
We can go explore.
We could rent a car.

426
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,233
Oh, I don't know
if we should--

427
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,967
Come on, where's
your sense of adventure?

428
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,600
Look, we just--
We go for a drive.

429
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:27,934
We see some sites, you know?
Blow off some steam,
back in an hour.

430
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,867
Where would we go?

431
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,033
I don't know,
we'll figure it out.

432
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,834
Look, I realize this
isn't your thing.

433
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,533
But it could be fun.

434
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,367
Maybe if we spend a little bit
of time together off-camera,

435
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,200
it'll help us on camera.

436
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:46,400
-One hour.
-Yeah.

437
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,166
And then we come back to work.

438
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,333
Absolutely. Synchronizing
watches. One hour, let's go.

439
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,333
So you go first,
where are you from,

440
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:59,367
parents, siblings first pet.

441
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,000
My dad worked for the city.

442
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,433
My mom was a teacher,
one sibling, a sister, younger,

443
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:10,266
married with two--
soon to be three-- kids,
and, ah, Melvin.

444
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,367
-Alright, your turn.
-Okay, let's see.

445
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,033
From Calgary, Alberta, my father
was an insurance salesman.

446
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,533
My mom was
a stay-home seamstress,

447
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:21,867
and I kept her pretty busy,

448
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,734
with all
the tears in my clothes.

449
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:26,033
Um, and Harry the turtle.

450
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,600
Your favorite pet was a turtle?
Yeah.

451
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:30,700
Yeah, he was great,
played fetch and everything.

452
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,700
That's a terrible joke.

453
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,834
Paige, where are you, call me.

454
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:40,867
What are you gonna do
until they get back?

455
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:58,000
-No service.
-Okay, which way?

456
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,734
Well, if we stick
to the main road,

457
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,500
that's gonna take us
back to the resort, so.

458
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:02,934
Yeah, I think so.

459
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:04,734
If we go that way,

460
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:07,400
I believe that'll take us
to the other side of the island.

461
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,467
So I wonder where that one goes.

462
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,133
Should we find out?

463
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:14,667
Uh, we should really
be getting back.

464
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,500
You said one hour,
I demand my full hour.

465
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:20,467
All right, but only
for a few more minutes.

466
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,133
Millie is gonna freak out
if we are not back soon.

467
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:26,767
We'll be back.

468
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,433
-Ben, where are you?
-Paige, please call me back.

469
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:33,166
I'm sure everything's fine,
they just lost track of time.

470
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,767
-You think?
-I don't know.

471
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,800
Wha'?

472
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,967
Thank you so much, thank you.

473
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:49,333
-So, you're from New York?
-Arkansas.

474
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:50,500
I don't know where that is.

475
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:57,300
Hey, did you know, there
are 137 Hawaiian islands,

476
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:59,133
not just the seven
inhabited ones?

477
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:01,834
Well, do any of them have cell
service on deserted roads?

478
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,667
Because maybe that would
have been a better place

479
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,233
to get a flat tire on a vehicle
that doesn't have a spare.

480
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,800
Yeah, there it is.

481
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:09,500
The "I told you so."
I knew it was coming.

482
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:11,667
I didn't say anything.

483
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,033
But if I was gonna say
something, I would say,

484
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,133
"I told you we should've
stayed on the main road."

485
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:17,867
I thought it would be fun!

486
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,400
Well, I'm having fun,
this is so much fun.

487
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:23,233
It's kinda like
an amusement park,

488
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:28,000
except, without the rides,
or the food, or... anything!

489
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:30,800
Just try to think of it
as an adventure, okay?

490
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,800
Granted, sometimes
it doesn't work out,

491
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,967
but when it does...
I remember one time--

492
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,734
No, no, no, no, no,
no more with the,

493
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:40,066
"I remember one time--"
I can't.

494
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,900
The car rental guy
mentioned zip lining.

495
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:44,133
"I remember one time."
Crocodile wrestling?

496
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:46,000
"I remember one time,
I remember one time."

497
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:47,066
"I remember one time!"

498
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,033
I never wrestled the crocodile.

499
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,400
Right, I forgot.
You ran away screaming.

500
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:53,233
That was Luis.

501
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:55,800
And oh, I'm sorry,
I forgot the crocodiles,

502
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:57,800
weren't as scary as goats.

503
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,767
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
said that, that was mean.

504
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:08,233
Hey, hey, hey,
where are you going?

505
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:09,633
Anywhere you're not.

506
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,867
Look, I've done tons of
embarrassing stuff on camera.

507
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,567
I remember one time, I...

508
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,433
Sorry, force of habit.
Mm-hmm.

509
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,700
Look, all I'm saying is that,

510
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:27,533
you just need to learn to,
I don't know, laugh it off.

511
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:28,800
Well, I think everyone
else has done

512
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:31,400
quite a bit of laughing
on my behalf.

513
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:34,266
You don't understand,
people have come up to me,

514
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,633
random people, for years,
and would just go, "Ba-a-ah"!

515
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:39,800
Or they just scream
out of nowhere.

516
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:44,333
It's not funny, I actually
don't think it's funny.

517
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,567
You're right.

518
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,934
You're absolutely right,
it's not funny.

519
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:49,467
It's just that, I mean,

520
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,066
everybody makes a fool
of themselves at some point.

521
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,133
Yap, but not everybody
has a video of it,

522
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,133
that's been seen
by 9 million people.

523
00:23:56,266 --> 00:24:01,133
Be more like 10 now, but I
saw all their videos of you.

524
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:03,467
You know, when you were at
work, and you looked good.

525
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,433
You were.
You were charming.

526
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:08,767
Before all
the screaming goats.

527
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,633
Is that what, uh, made
you become a producer?

528
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:15,600
I saw Millie a couple
of times on assignment,

529
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:18,166
and then I ran into her
after you'd left the show.

530
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,700
She needed a producer,

531
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,333
and I thought, well,
I needed a fresh start, so...

532
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:26,500
You don't miss it? Being
in front of a camera,
going out on the road?

533
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,033
No, not at all.

534
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,500
So why did you agree
to be the co-host,

535
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:33,166
of Next Destination?

536
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,166
I pitched my own show.
It didn't work.

537
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,600
Millie says, by doing this,

538
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:41,033
I might make them
think more favorably.

539
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:43,367
And that's it?

540
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,133
Yeah, that's it.
Hmm.

541
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:50,266
I just thought that,
uh, maybe there
is a reason.

542
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,233
that the gig, like, may be
a shot at redemption.

543
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,767
Millie is gonna kill us.

544
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,767
Then I came too and I thought,

545
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,834
there's no way I'm ever
swimming with sharks again.

546
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:12,066
Oh, Luis, no bueno.

547
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Yeah.

548
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,200
Have you heard from him yet?

549
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,700
Well, I thought you were
checking your phone.

550
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:25,734
-Nothing.
-Nope.

551
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:34,200
We should really get to work
on rescheduling this day.

552
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,934
Oh, a hundred percent.

553
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,767
Oh, Mahalo!

554
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:50,033
Do you think I have feelings?

555
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,867
Well, sadly he doesn't get
reception out here either,

556
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,533
but he said he would drive
us back to the resort

557
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:01,467
when he's done,
in about 30 minutes.

558
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,133
So, we have a choice to
make, we either keep walking,

559
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:07,600
or...

560
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:12,166
we eat some pineapple.

561
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,266
-I love pineapple.
-I love pineapple, too.

562
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,400
All right, maybe it's nice,
let me see if I can...

563
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:22,500
Oh, also, I found
out that his brother,

564
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:25,934
runs the scuba shop,
next to our resort.

565
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:28,934
So we could do
a little snorkeling.

566
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:34,133
Ben, we have all our
recreation segments planned.

567
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,166
I know, it's just that...
Never mind.

568
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,133
No, what?

569
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,567
Its just that, that's
one of the reasons,

570
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,066
why I left them
in the first place.

571
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,800
You know, with Todd.

572
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:49,100
He was just so
flattened by the book.

573
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,100
You left because you didn't
get your way all the time.

574
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:52,600
What are you, 12?

575
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:53,834
I wasn't joking when
I said I like videos

576
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,467
of cats on skateboards.

577
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,166
Hey you couldn't
have always had jobs,

578
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,900
that allowed you to do whatever
it is you wanted to do.

579
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,734
So what did you do before?

580
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,734
Well, I started at a little
local station in Chicago.

581
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:05,300
Mm-hmm.

582
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:07,233
Kinda fell into the whole
Adventure Travel thing,

583
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:09,567
because I was the guy who
was willing to do anything

584
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,667
no matter how crazy.

585
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,133
Thanks to crocodiles.

586
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:14,166
Yeah, but I got to
do my own segments.

587
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,033
That was the thing.

588
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:19,900
But when I went to network,
it just didn't work.

589
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:22,867
So, Millie and I, we chalked
it up to creative differences,

590
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,233
and that was that--
I went and did my own show.

591
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:28,633
You never missed
having a regular gig?

592
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,967
Mm... No.

593
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,066
Then, why did you?

594
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:36,734
I don't know,

595
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:39,100
I guess maybe I wanted
a shot at redemption, too.

596
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,734
Hmm.

597
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:45,200
You think we'll be able to?

598
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,734
Redeem ourselves, that is?

599
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:51,667
Well, if you can get over being
chased by screaming goats,

600
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,567
I figure I can probably
learn to follow a script.

601
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,900
At least a little bit.

602
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:58,633
Just promise me,

603
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:00,700
I get
to do more than stand
and point at things.

604
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:02,433
Never fun for you?

605
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:04,100
No, it's not that,
I'm really bad at it.

606
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:06,266
Look, ground, sky-- terrible.

607
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:15,133
c]

608
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,367
All right, so we are
starting with the overview,

609
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,700
of the water activities.

610
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:25,633
Scuba, snorkeling, surfing.

611
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:27,667
Uh, I wanna make
sure I got this right.

612
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,033
So we're gonna talk
about these things

613
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,500
but not actually do
any of them, is that right?

614
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:35,533
This is where the pointing
skills come in handy.

615
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,300
Right, okay, well,
let's see I could point,

616
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:40,100
I don't know, there.

617
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:41,934
Hey, look, it's Kako's
Brothers scuba shack.

618
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:43,834
The guy that drove
us back to the hotel,

619
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:46,133
we could go snorkeling
will be so much fun.

620
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,033
Okay, for starters, this
is the overview episode,

621
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:52,266
not the actual
recreation episode.

622
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,166
So it's easier
and more efficient,

623
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,500
-we just stay on the beach.
-Hey, it easier, sure.

624
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:58,100
But not nearly as much fun.

625
00:28:58,233 --> 00:28:59,934
And just because
it's the overview,

626
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,734
doesn't mean we can't
do anything, right?

627
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,567
Luis, help me out here, man.

628
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,700
We are pressed
for time, but shots
of you two in the water

629
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:08,200
would be pretty great.

630
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,166
We're already
running behind, so--

631
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,900
Okay, you're just gonna
go into the water,

632
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,233
and you're gonna splash
around a little bit,

633
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:14,433
and that's really cute.

634
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:19,967
We're gonna...
splish-splash a little bit.

635
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,934
Paige, we said we'd try
and work together, right?

636
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:28,533
Yep, yep.

637
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,567
Okay good, I'm gonna
get my suit.

638
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,400
And action.

639
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:35,400
Hey, everybody, welcome
back to Next Destination,

640
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:37,433
and our overview of Hawaii.

641
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,367
Now, no trip here
would be complete,

642
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,767
without exploring the incredible
water opportunities,

643
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,100
that the islands offer.

644
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:46,734
We are literally
surrounded by it.

645
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:48,900
Usually how an island works.

646
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:51,100
Ha-ha, so funny.

647
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:52,667
Now, in our recreation episode,

648
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,000
we will be taking a deeper dive.

649
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:57,734
Oh. I see what you did
there, very clever.

650
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:00,100
Thanks for keeping up.
Mm-hmm.

651
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:01,767
Okay, on that note,
I thought maybe

652
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,400
we'd give you a little
sneak preview, you ready?

653
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:07,400
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

654
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:45,700
-Hi.
-Hi.

655
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:50,266
So, um, I wanted to...

656
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:59,934
apologize for, well,
pushing back on...

657
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,166
all of your ideas.

658
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,066
Our bosses are pretty strict

659
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,100
with how we do things, but
they do allow us some freedom.

660
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:11,967
Snorkeling was
a really good idea today.

661
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,900
Well, thank you.

662
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:20,066
But the truth is, I am the one
who should probably apologize,

663
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,233
for pushing so hard for changes.

664
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:24,333
I realize that
we have deadlines,

665
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:26,834
and that we have
a schedule to keep to.

666
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:29,834
And I will endeavor
to be more...

667
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:35,567
respectful of that, I'm sorry.

668
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,633
Thank you.

669
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:39,600
No, no, no thank you.

670
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:44,633
Look at us, being all
professional and mature.

671
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:45,967
I'm very impressed with us.

672
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,000
Who wouldn't be?

673
00:31:51,734 --> 00:31:53,400
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

674
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:55,567
Yes, you will.
Good night.

675
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,834
Good night.

676
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,667
We hope you enjoyed
our overview

677
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,133
of what's to come this season
on Next Destination: Hawaii.

678
00:32:07,266 --> 00:32:09,400
Join us next week, as
we explore the best hotels,

679
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:11,166
and resorts on the island.

680
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,500
The kinds of places Paige
is gonna post pictures of,

681
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:15,800
to make her friends jealous.

682
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,000
That's what you do
when you have friends,

683
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:19,066
instead of just followers.

684
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,367
-Ooh! Slay!
-I'm Paige Marshall.

685
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,533
And I'm Ben Burton,
see you next time.

686
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,066
And cut, right.

687
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,800
That's a wrap
on our overview episode.

688
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:32,300
Paige Marshall
steps up to the plate

689
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:36,467
and slams it out of the park.

690
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,166
You have got to stop
going off script.

691
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,133
Sound advice, I'll be
sure to write that down

692
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:42,967
in my script.

693
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,300
Nice work!
Good job, lucky for you.

694
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:47,734
Well, that was good.

695
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:49,333
You guys are getting
the hang of it.

696
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,400
Yep, yeah I'm learning
to hide my panic,

697
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:53,633
every time he improvises.

698
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:55,300
Well, we finished
the overview episode,

699
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:56,734
that's progress, isn't it?

700
00:32:56,867 --> 00:33:01,266
Yep, took us three days,
normally takes us two.

701
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,300
Quality takes time?

702
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:07,166
Sure.

703
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,767
You like the water so much,

704
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,367
are you thinking of
taking up surfing?

705
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,066
No, I'm
doing some research

706
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,900
for our recreation episode.

707
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:21,800
Did you want something?

708
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:24,533
So I met this cab driver
named Leilani, and
her cousin is opening

709
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,100
this really cool zip line
attraction in a few weeks?

710
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:28,033
We're not gonna be
here in a weeks.

711
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,400
I do realize that, but
they're doing test runs today,

712
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:32,200
and she said that
we could film a segment.

713
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,066
But only today, because
then they're gonna be too busy

714
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,734
getting ready to open.

715
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:38,567
Ben, we already have
everything booked for today.

716
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,066
We're filming on location
at three different resorts.

717
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,533
And then we've got
the sunset sail boat cruise.

718
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,367
Paige, come on,
a sunset cruise?

719
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,266
Boat trip to see something
that happens literally

720
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,900
every single day, or zip
lining through the tree tops.

721
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:51,400
This is fun, this is boring.

722
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:54,934
Ben, I trusted you
with the snorkeling.

723
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,467
That's true, you did.

724
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,467
I think you gotta
trust me on this one.

725
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,700
Okay, you're right, open mind.

726
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,367
-It's okay.
-Sorry.

727
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,333
There you go, thanks so much.
Okay, see ya.

728
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,967
-Whoo!
-Fan of Bold World?

729
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,500
Yeah, kinda... she wanted
a picture of you too.

730
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:21,467
-Oh...
-She thought we were a couple.

731
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,333
Oh.

732
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:25,800
I know, I told her I tend not to
date women that don't like me.

733
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:27,667
I don't dislike you.
Well...

734
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,600
I don't, I don't, you just--

735
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,967
you and I,
we're just very different.

736
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,834
So we may not always get along.

737
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:37,533
True, but it makes
for good TV.

738
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:40,333
Hopefully.

739
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:42,000
Is there a woman in your life,

740
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:44,834
that doesn't dislike you?

741
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:48,033
That doesn't dislike me?
Uhh...

742
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,667
I didn't think
it was a tough question.

743
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,900
Didn't like me, I have
to think, let me think.

744
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,200
Well, the truth is
yes, there was one,

745
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:57,100
but it didn't
work out, so--

746
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:59,533
Oh, hang on, let me guess,
she wanted to settle down

747
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:02,700
but you weren't done
being Mr. Danger--

748
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,734
Or, uh, what? Mr. Adventure.

749
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:07,567
Umm. Yeah, something
like that.

750
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,233
Hey, you guys ready?
Gonna head out.

751
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:12,100
Yeah, yeah, we'll be
there in a minute.

752
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:13,900
I still don't think this is
gonna measure up to zip line.

753
00:35:14,033 --> 00:35:15,066
I'm telling you.

754
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,100
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

755
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:20,900
Maybe if you stopped going
a hundred miles an hour,

756
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:24,600
and slowed down,

757
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:26,567
you might actually get
to see where you're at.

758
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:48,800
You were right, it's beautiful.
I stand corrected.

759
00:36:00,734 --> 00:36:02,233
because this episode
of Next Destination,

760
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:05,000
is all about the food
here in Hawaii.

761
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:06,433
From fine dining to food trucks,

762
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:08,266
to farmers markets
like this one,

763
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,934
we're gonna sample
the best eats on the islands.

764
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:13,200
Your taste buds ready
for an adventure pace.

765
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:16,033
Well, that depends
on how much of an adventure

766
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,734
you're talking about.
Well, I don't know.

767
00:36:17,867 --> 00:36:19,100
There was a booth back
there that had everything

768
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:21,266
from snails to cow's tongue.

769
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,100
Oh, uh, well, why don't we leave
the cow's tongue to you?

770
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:28,367
And I can focus on the desserts.

771
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,000
That hardly seems fair.

772
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:32,867
You're the one
who wanted an adventure.
Oh!

773
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,667
And... cut!
Great work, you two.

774
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,200
We're gonna get set up
with the next shot.

775
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,000
-Okay, thanks.
-Sounds good.

776
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,433
There may be hope for us yet?

777
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,166
Yeah, stick with me,
kid-- we'll go far!

778
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,033
One week into the shoot and
the network is very excited.

779
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,834
I hope not that excited,

780
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:53,667
'cause I only signed on to do
just the one season, right?

781
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,066
Of course, of course,

782
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,867
we can absolutely
replace you next season.

783
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,266
Okay.

784
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,734
You're not really
looking forward

785
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:02,800
to getting back
to your desk, are you?

786
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:06,767
Yes, absolutely, this
is way too much stress.

787
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,333
Oh, come on, you missed
hosting, I can tell.

788
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:14,433
Maybe a little, I think
I'm just getting distracted

789
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,734
-by the romance of it all.
-Romance?

790
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:21,333
Okay, no, no, no,
the romance of...

791
00:37:21,467 --> 00:37:23,066
the island,

792
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,333
the beach and
the people and the food.

793
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:29,967
What did you call--
the Hawaii bubble?

794
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,934
Not a single person
has recognized me
since I've been here.

795
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:37,800
I told you. I have short
memories, enjoy your bubble.

796
00:37:37,934 --> 00:37:39,734
What happens when it bursts?

797
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:41,433
Well, I'm just glad

798
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:42,934
that you and Ben have
buried the hatchet for now.

799
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:45,066
I don't know
if we've buried the hatchet,

800
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,834
but at least we're not trying to
kill each other with it anymore.

801
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:51,900
There's that.

802
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:54,000
Oh, speaking of Ben,

803
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,734
Go, go on.

804
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:00,834
I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

805
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:03,367
-Two glasses?
-Yeah, I got it.

806
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Hey. you. Paige, I would
like you to meet Kekoa.

807
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:08,233
Kekoa, this is Paige.

808
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:11,066
He was just telling me about
this restaurant called--

809
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,967
Maluhia, that's right.

810
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,834
They have the best kalua
pork in the islands.

811
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:16,867
Bake it underground for hours.

812
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,033
He described it
as life-changing.

813
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:22,800
Only locals go there, best
kept secret type of place.

814
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,233
Exactly.

815
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,033
Well, I do like
the sound of that.

816
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:28,800
What are you doing for dinner?

817
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:32,033
What I was just gonna
order some room service,

818
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,734
and do some work.

819
00:38:33,867 --> 00:38:35,367
Change of plans.
We're going out.

820
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,567
-Ben, I can't.
-I'm not saying we send a crew.

821
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,033
I just want you
to go to dinner with me.

822
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,367
Don't tell me you're
not a little bit intrigued.

823
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,066
I saw how you ate today.

824
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,066
Okay.

825
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,700
Well.

826
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:52,533
Okay.

827
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,000
-Yeah?
-All right.

828
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:55,667
She said yes,
I can't believe it.

829
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,400
Mahalo, Kekoa, so
where is it again?

830
00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:59,367
Just go straight up Mauka,

831
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,066
make a left by the two coconut
trees and you should be good.

832
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,266
-Okay. Aloha.
-Aloha.

833
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:17,033
Kekoa was right. Mm!
This is life-changing!

834
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:20,900
Life-changing.

835
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,800
What, Oh no.

836
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:26,367
No, no, no, no, it's not that.

837
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,033
You just... Looks like
you're having fun again.

838
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:33,467
You gotta be careful,
it's habit-forming.

839
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,033
What, so is this food.

840
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,600
If the network
greenlights my new show,

841
00:39:38,734 --> 00:39:41,867
these are the kind
of places I wanna explore.

842
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,066
Now, that I find interesting.

843
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,767
What else would
you do on your show?

844
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:54,033
Okay, so it's a travel show,
that unfolds like a mystery.

845
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:55,867
We're gonna give them clues

846
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,900
that they have to figure out
kind of like an escape room,

847
00:39:58,033 --> 00:39:59,934
where we're gonna
blindfold them.

848
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:03,066
All this from a woman
that needs a plan.

849
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,867
Well, I'm gonna know
what's gonna happen.

850
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,700
But it's a host.

851
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,467
-Well, you were right.
-Yeah?

852
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Yeah, that was good.

853
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:33,266
What do you think
about adding it

854
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,433
to the off-the-beaten-path
episode at the end?

855
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,233
Hey, that'd be great.

856
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,934
Help it stand out from all
the other restaurants, yeah.

857
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:41,700
-Exactly. We got a deal?
-We got a deal.

858
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:44,300
Hey, we've been
looking for you guys.

859
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:45,934
Oh, we were just
saying good night.

860
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:47,900
-Ben.
-Yes, goodnight, Paige.

861
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:49,400
-Ben.
-Paige.

862
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,867
-Ben.
-Why y'all of being weird?

863
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,066
We're not being weird,
you're being weird.

864
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,633
Why are you looking
for us for anyway?

865
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,867
We're gonna go to a concert,
you wanna come?

866
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,934
Concert, yeah that'd be fun,
you wanna go to a concert?

867
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:04,934
I have some work
still tonight.

868
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:08,100
-Come on.
-Duty calls.

869
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,700
Okay, you're right,
don't work too late.

870
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:12,266
Have fun.

871
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,667
Okay, bye.

872
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
All right guys, let's go.

873
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,100
-Good night.
-Good night.

874
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:38,867
The overview episode resorts
and restaurants are done.

875
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,100
We have a good start
on must-see sites.

876
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:43,967
And then we move into culture
fun in the sun nightlife,

877
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,367
and off-the-beaten-path.

878
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,633
Where is Ben, I thought
he was joining us.

879
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:51,133
Well, this is supposed
to be our day off,

880
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:53,967
so I told him to go
relax by the pool.

881
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,867
Why didn't I get that option?

882
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,800
Because you're not a relaxed
by the pool kind of person.

883
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,500
You're a first one
in the office,

884
00:42:00,633 --> 00:42:02,567
work on schedules on
your day off kind of person.

885
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,266
Well, we're not
in the office, are we?

886
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,266
We are in the Hawaii
bubble, remember?

887
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,500
And you are here with me,
working on schedules,

888
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:12,600
on your day off.

889
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:13,834
Yeah, and whose idea was that?

890
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:16,433
Yours. You called me!

891
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,867
Well, I have changed my mind.

892
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,533
I am going to sit by the pool,
and have a little fun.

893
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:32,033
Okay, why does
everyone keep acting,

894
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:35,033
like I don't know
how to have fun?

895
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:40,200
Oh, is this the part where
you're being more sensitive

896
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,900
to people's feelings?

897
00:42:42,033 --> 00:42:45,433
-Yes.
-Okay.

898
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:49,100
Is it not working?

899
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:00,333
I am fun, I am a fun person, hi.

900
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,300
Hey, what's going on?

901
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:10,133
Ben, hi, yeah, I was
just chilling, you?

902
00:43:10,266 --> 00:43:11,900
Well, I was gonna try
my hand at surfing,

903
00:43:12,033 --> 00:43:13,467
but now I think we should talk

904
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,900
about your use of
the word chillin'.

905
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:18,000
Well, it's our day off,

906
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:20,433
so Millie wanted
to go over schedules.

907
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:25,400
I was like, "No way.
I am going to, uh,

908
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:27,000
have some fun."

909
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:31,767
Really, well, Paige
Marshall having fun?

910
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,300
That is something I need to see.

911
00:43:33,433 --> 00:43:36,333
How about if I get us a cabana?

912
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:40,367
Yeah, sure, sounds chill.

913
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,266
Please stop saying that word.

914
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,700
Okay.

915
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
So how's that chilling
thing working out for you?

916
00:44:07,734 --> 00:44:10,767
Yeah, never felt more relaxed.

917
00:44:13,066 --> 00:44:15,633
Oh, yeah, I can tell.

918
00:44:15,767 --> 00:44:18,967
Face it, you would rather be
doing schedules with Millie.

919
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,900
No way! Okay, I find doing
scheduling very relaxing.

920
00:44:24,033 --> 00:44:25,600
What's wrong with me?

921
00:44:25,734 --> 00:44:27,800
Relaxing and having fun
are like the muscles.

922
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:30,233
If you don't use them,
they're gonna atrophy.

923
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,700
What are you, like a personal
trainer for goofing off?

924
00:44:33,834 --> 00:44:35,567
Yes, yes I am.

925
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,934
I like the sound of that.
Put that on a business card.

926
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,467
Aren't you glad you hired me?

927
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,133
You're not gonna
get that from Todd.

928
00:44:41,266 --> 00:44:43,567
That's for sure.
He's way too boring.

929
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,767
No, he isn't.

930
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,300
Oh! Yes, he is.

931
00:44:47,433 --> 00:44:50,467
I worked with him for
a year, remember, so boring.

932
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,300
Well, I find him
very interesting.

933
00:44:52,433 --> 00:44:54,100
Name one interesting
conversation

934
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,800
you had with Todd Harper, go.

935
00:44:56,934 --> 00:45:02,333
Oh, well... we talked
about clothes.

936
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:04,500
He knows a lot about clothes.

937
00:45:04,633 --> 00:45:06,300
He could, yeah,
he can talk forever

938
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:10,967
about waterproof jackets--
and, uh,

939
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,333
it was fascinating.

940
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:13,867
I just about fell asleep
listening to you

941
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,700
talk about that conversation.

942
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:18,133
I can't imagine actually
having that conversation.

943
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:19,533
Okay, well I'm sorry.

944
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:22,467
Not everyone can have
a carefree life,

945
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,867
that's all about having fun
and never anything of substance.

946
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,600
Well, that's unfair.

947
00:45:27,734 --> 00:45:29,533
I do lots of things
of substance.

948
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:32,033
Name one.

949
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:35,367
-Like now, an example?
-Yeah, yes.

950
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,367
Well, there are a lot
of them, things of substance.

951
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,934
Oh.
But we're not talking about
me, we're talking about you,

952
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:43,200
and your inability
to relax and have fun.

953
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:46,633
So, I say let's
exercise those muscles.

954
00:45:48,567 --> 00:45:50,166
How?

955
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,367
It's a good question.

956
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:58,500
-Parasailing?
-Yes!

957
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:01,166
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

958
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,700
No, no way.

959
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:04,900
Not in a million years, no.

960
00:46:05,033 --> 00:46:06,734
So you're saying
there's a chance.

961
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:09,367
No, I'm not, I'm not doing it.

962
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,266
All right, well then you
come up with something.

963
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:23,033
'80s music trivia contest?

964
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:26,567
You're so on.
Absolutely.

965
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:30,400
All right give me a guess.

966
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:31,667
Flock of Seagulls.

967
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,900
That's correct.

968
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:34,066
Yes.

969
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,600
Awesome.

970
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:38,100
Let's Get Physical by-

971
00:46:38,233 --> 00:46:39,567
-Olivia Newton John.
-Olivia Newton John.

972
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,166
Ten points.

973
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,333
Wake Me Up
Before You Go-Go.

974
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:44,500
Ladies and gentlemen, we're down

975
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:45,867
to our last question

976
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,567
and it is worth 100 points,

977
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,567
so it's anyone's game.

978
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,500
Okay we get this we
win the whole thing.

979
00:46:51,633 --> 00:46:54,066
Oh no, we get this we celebrate.

980
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,500
How?

981
00:46:55,633 --> 00:46:58,734
Oh, I think you know...
parasailing.

982
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,233
-All right.
-Yeah.

983
00:47:01,367 --> 00:47:02,567
-All right.
-Okay.

984
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,233
For 100 points.

985
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:08,433
What female group
had a 1987 hit,

986
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:11,567
with a cover of the
Simon and Garfunkel song,

987
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,633
A Hazy Shade of Winter.

988
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:16,500
Bangles, The Bangles.

989
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:17,900
That is correct.

990
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:22,467
Bangles, I knew it.

991
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,467
Awesome, champions.

992
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:28,233
Oh, my goodness,

993
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:30,633
gracious congratulations.

994
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:32,433
I got it, I got it.

995
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:33,600
Sorry about that.

996
00:47:35,867 --> 00:47:37,300
Give it up for the winners.

997
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:40,500
What are your names,
Ben, and this is Paige.

998
00:47:40,633 --> 00:47:44,000
Oh, wait a second,
I thought I recognized you.

999
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:45,567
Ladies and gentlemen,

1000
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,066
we have an honest
to goodness celebrity,

1001
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,166
right here in our midst.

1002
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,633
It's the goat lady.

1003
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:17,967
Hey there, you left without,

1004
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,500
your half the world's
greatest trophy.

1005
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:22,500
I was thinking
we could split it.

1006
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,066
Which part would you like?

1007
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,166
Oh, that's okay,
you can keep both halves.

1008
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,400
All right.

1009
00:48:34,467 --> 00:48:36,800
You know, the goats
were my idea.

1010
00:48:36,934 --> 00:48:38,500
We weren't planning it.

1011
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:42,667
We were on our way to
a location, and I saw this farm,

1012
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,567
and I thought,
"Hey, that would be fun.

1013
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,300
No script, no rehearsal,
no planning,

1014
00:48:46,433 --> 00:48:48,700
just walk out into
the middle of the field,

1015
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:50,900
and start filming it."

1016
00:48:51,033 --> 00:48:53,066
I didn't realize someone
else was filming it

1017
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,734
on their cell phone.

1018
00:48:54,867 --> 00:48:57,700
Yap, that would definitely
be embarrassing.

1019
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:02,000
Oh, it was more
than just embarrassing.

1020
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,133
I left the gate open,
when I ran away,

1021
00:49:06,266 --> 00:49:07,700
and the goats got out,
they ate everything.

1022
00:49:07,834 --> 00:49:09,300
We got sued,

1023
00:49:09,433 --> 00:49:11,700
because of course we didn't
have filming permits.

1024
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:13,700
So I was a joke, fine.

1025
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:18,734
But people lost their jobs
because of me.

1026
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:21,233
I can't help but think

1027
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:25,767
if we had just stuck
to the plan, maybe...

1028
00:49:28,233 --> 00:49:30,266
Yeah.

1029
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:36,133
You wanna know why
I left Next Destination,

1030
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:38,233
to start my own show?

1031
00:49:38,367 --> 00:49:41,333
Oh, creative differences?

1032
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:48,166
Yeah, yeah,
something like that.

1033
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,700
Tell you what, why don't
we just wipe the slate clean?

1034
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,934
here i.

1035
00:50:08,066 --> 00:50:10,033
For instance, the luau.

1036
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:13,900
Did you know, that in ancient
days, it was called, aha'aina.

1037
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:19,133
Aha meaning gathering, and aina
meaning eating many things.

1038
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,734
That was correct.

1039
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,200
I can do that.

1040
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:28,767
No you couldn't.

1041
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,100
No, I could not.

1042
00:50:31,233 --> 00:50:33,467
And cut, thank you everyone.

1043
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,367
Okay, everyone remember

1044
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,767
that we're gonna come back
here tonight for some B-roll

1045
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,233
of the luau and festivities
and everything.

1046
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:42,066
So, I think that
went pretty well.

1047
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,100
-You did a little research.
-A little bit.

1048
00:50:45,233 --> 00:50:46,533
I'm impressed.

1049
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:49,100
And for the record,
I could totally do that.

1050
00:50:49,233 --> 00:50:50,233
No, you couldn't.

1051
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:52,800
No, I could not.

1052
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:55,934
-I'll see you.
-All right, bye-bye.

1053
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:58,367
What are you smiling about?

1054
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,066
I'm not smiling.

1055
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:06,834
Is this about Paige?

1056
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:08,200
I saw you smiling again.

1057
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:09,867
Its my job, I'm on TV.

1058
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,333
Oh come on, Ben, you like her.

1059
00:51:11,467 --> 00:51:14,033
No, I don't.

1060
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:16,667
Okay, yeah, I do,
but not that way.

1061
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,333
She just, something
happened yesterday

1062
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:20,433
and she was upset, that's all.

1063
00:51:20,567 --> 00:51:22,133
Oh, what'd you do?

1064
00:51:22,266 --> 00:51:25,834
I didn't do anything,
she's not mad at me.

1065
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,533
She told me some personal
stuff and it got kinda serious.

1066
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:32,800
So I was smiling,
because she was smiling.

1067
00:51:32,934 --> 00:51:34,300
And I thought maybe she got over

1068
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:37,667
what happened
yesterday, that's all.

1069
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:46,100
Did you ask her
if she was really over it?

1070
00:51:50,967 --> 00:51:52,767
Hey, how was that?

1071
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,166
Wonderful, I loved it,
I loved it, they're beautiful.

1072
00:52:21,967 --> 00:52:24,367
Oh, is there something
wrong with my dress?

1073
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,100
No, you look amazing,
so beautiful.

1074
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:32,900
Oh, well, thank you.

1075
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:35,400
You look very handsome yourself.

1076
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:37,834
Yeah, I know.

1077
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:40,734
Thank you for saying it.
It's very kind of you.

1078
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,734
Yep, car's out front, shall we?

1079
00:52:47,867 --> 00:52:50,900
Oh, all right.

1080
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,500
Aloha!

1081
00:53:50,633 --> 00:53:52,900
Aloha!

1082
00:53:53,033 --> 00:53:55,467
We hope you're
enjoying the program,

1083
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,166
in the spirit
of Aloha,

1084
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,867
which means peace,
love and compassion.

1085
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,633
We'd like to share the tradition

1086
00:54:02,767 --> 00:54:05,400
of our Tahitian dance with you.

1087
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,033
Do we have any brave
souls out there,

1088
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:10,633
-willing to give it a try?
-Come on you guys.

1089
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:13,033
No, no, no, the joke
about how dancing, no joke.

1090
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:17,533
Oh. Suddenly Mr. Adventure
is not feeling so adventurous.

1091
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:19,333
You wanna get up there and
dance in front of everybody?

1092
00:54:19,467 --> 00:54:22,400
No, not really, but,
not because I can't dance.

1093
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,967
We have some special
guests here tonight.

1094
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,967
The new host of
Next Destination,

1095
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,233
on The Expedition Channel.

1096
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:40,333
Oh boy.

1097
00:54:40,467 --> 00:54:41,734
Make me proud.

1098
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:43,800
Come on, lets get
this over with.

1099
00:54:45,467 --> 00:54:48,133
Come on up.

1100
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:49,133
Oh.

1101
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:50,233
-Aloha.
-Aloha.

1102
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,867
Thank you so much.

1103
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,967
I'd like to apologize
in advance for the fiasco

1104
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,633
you're about to witness.

1105
00:54:55,767 --> 00:54:57,200
Don't worry I'm sure
you'll do great.

1106
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:58,867
-Okay.
-Okay,

1107
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,767
you're going to start,
by moving your hips.

1108
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,066
Oh no.

1109
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,767
Okay, now we're going
to add, a smile.

1110
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,700
Smile.

1111
00:55:23,033 --> 00:55:25,266
I've never been this
uncomfortable in my life.

1112
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,867
That's it, aren't
they doing great?

1113
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,967
Yes.

1114
00:55:40,934 --> 00:55:42,233
Don't tell me
you're not impressed.

1115
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,967
You know, if Next Destination
doesn't work out.

1116
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,533
I think we got
a shot as dancers.

1117
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:49,066
Oh no, no, no.

1118
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,734
That was the beginning

1119
00:55:50,867 --> 00:55:53,600
and the end of
my Tahitian dance career.

1120
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:58,767
Oh, poof. I'm just glad
no one recognized me.

1121
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,600
Yeah, actually I wanted
to talk to you about that.

1122
00:56:04,734 --> 00:56:05,767
You know, when you were talking

1123
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,233
the other night, about the...

1124
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:11,266
My crushing embarrassment?

1125
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,767
Yeah, thanks for bringing it up.

1126
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,433
Yeah, that.

1127
00:56:14,567 --> 00:56:17,133
Well, I wasn't exactly
straight with you.

1128
00:56:17,266 --> 00:56:19,700
The real reason I left
Next Destination

1129
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:23,467
was not because of
creative differences.

1130
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,934
Remember the girl
that I told you about?

1131
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:27,467
Yeah.

1132
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,600
Well, it was actually
pretty serious.

1133
00:56:30,734 --> 00:56:32,467
I thought she was the one.

1134
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,834
So I had it all planned
out-- the big house,

1135
00:56:34,967 --> 00:56:37,700
white picket fence,
three kids, two dogs,

1136
00:56:37,834 --> 00:56:41,533
Luis in the guest room
above the garage.

1137
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,934
Well, what happened?

1138
00:56:47,066 --> 00:56:48,700
Well...

1139
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,600
I was all in,

1140
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:53,967
and, uh, she wasn't.

1141
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,433
I'm sorry.

1142
00:56:56,567 --> 00:56:59,100
You know, I figured

1143
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:01,567
what good's a plan
if you can't make it real?

1144
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:05,667
So, after that, following
a script, it just, uh...

1145
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,400
I couldn't do it,
so I quit.

1146
00:57:07,533 --> 00:57:10,934
And I've just been operating
without a manual ever since.

1147
00:57:11,066 --> 00:57:14,066
Take it as it comes
and just see what happens.

1148
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:17,033
Seems to have worked for you.

1149
00:57:17,166 --> 00:57:18,667
Yeah, but I think

1150
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,100
that I'm realizing

1151
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:23,900
since I've been here,
with you,

1152
00:57:24,033 --> 00:57:28,567
that, uh, maybe I
really do want something...

1153
00:57:30,467 --> 00:57:32,900
with a little bit
more substance.

1154
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,734
You know?

1155
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:41,867
Uh...

1156
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,834
The Hawaii bubble,
it just...

1157
00:57:44,967 --> 00:57:46,033
The... the what?

1158
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:47,066
It's...

1159
00:57:48,233 --> 00:57:49,767
this place.

1160
00:57:52,133 --> 00:57:53,834
What happens when we leave

1161
00:57:53,967 --> 00:57:55,600
and I go back to New York

1162
00:57:55,734 --> 00:57:59,633
and you go to wherever it is
you're gonna go next?

1163
00:58:02,433 --> 00:58:04,533
What happens when
the bubble bursts?

1164
00:58:08,967 --> 00:58:10,967
I...

1165
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,600
I should go to sleep.
We've got an hour to start.

1166
00:58:14,734 --> 00:58:15,700
Yeah.

1167
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,166
Goodnight, Ben.

1168
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:20,667
Goodnight.

1169
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,867
exploring the trails
in this magnificent valley.

1170
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,834
That's right, it's a super
fun place for ATV-ing.

1171
00:58:41,967 --> 00:58:43,133
That it is, Paige.

1172
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:45,500
however, today
we were UTV-ing.

1173
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:49,066
-What? No.
-Yeah.

1174
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,367
What's the difference?

1175
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,900
Well a UTV is
a utility task vehicle

1176
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:55,200
and an ATV is
an all-terrain vehicle,

1177
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:58,133
which has a handlebar and
drives much like a motorcycle.

1178
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,467
So you just considered
the whole growing-up thing

1179
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,266
to be optional?

1180
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,467
And we'll be right back
with more recreation

1181
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,367
and sporting activities,
including golf, hiking,

1182
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,967
and making fun
of your co-host.

1183
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,967
Cut.

1184
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,200
Okay, thank you, everybody.
We're moving on.

1185
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:19,233
That's lunch, meet back
at the resort at noon.

1186
00:59:19,367 --> 00:59:20,800
All right, sounds good.
Thanks, Luis.

1187
00:59:20,934 --> 00:59:22,400
So, it sounds like we've
got a couple of hours,

1188
00:59:22,533 --> 00:59:24,734
so I think I'll head
back and check on Millie,

1189
00:59:24,867 --> 00:59:27,400
see how the cut of
the last episode's coming.

1190
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:29,400
Okay, all right,
sounds good.

1191
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:31,033
I'll see you there,

1192
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:34,233
I think I'm gonna do
a little bit more a UTV-ing.

1193
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:35,934
You wanna join me?

1194
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,900
I should probably...

1195
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,467
What, check on Millie?

1196
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,300
Yes, exactly.

1197
00:59:42,433 --> 00:59:43,767
Who's gonna
have what reaction?

1198
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,400
When you stand
over her shoulder

1199
00:59:45,533 --> 00:59:48,934
as she tries that
at the last episode?

1200
00:59:49,066 --> 00:59:51,900
UTV, you say?

1201
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:53,367
Please.

1202
01:00:13,767 --> 01:00:16,100
Yee-haw!

1203
01:00:17,667 --> 01:00:20,133
That was super fun.

1204
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:22,233
What is your place like
in L.A.?

1205
01:00:24,233 --> 01:00:26,266
-Its pretty basic.
-Oh.

1206
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,567
Yeah. I'm not there
very much, so it's
no big deal, but, uh...

1207
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,066
what's your place
in New York like?

1208
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,367
It's cute, it's cozy,
it's small, but... I like it.

1209
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,200
What if you're
not there as much,

1210
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:42,100
if they ask us to
do another season?

1211
01:00:42,233 --> 01:00:43,433
Oh, they only want me
for one.

1212
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:47,500
Yeah, I know,
but what do you want?

1213
01:00:49,734 --> 01:00:50,867
What do you mean?

1214
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,100
Well, look, I realized

1215
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,567
that we had our
ups and downs, we did.

1216
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,734
But... I don't know,

1217
01:00:57,867 --> 01:00:59,867
I think it's really
starting to click now.

1218
01:01:00,066 --> 01:01:04,467
I like who I am when
I'm with you, on camera.

1219
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:08,667
I think that we should
take the bubble with us.

1220
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:13,000
I think we should do
another season together.

1221
01:01:13,133 --> 01:01:14,200
Are you serious?

1222
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:17,433
Come on,
we're a great team.

1223
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:19,800
You know it, and I know it.

1224
01:01:19,934 --> 01:01:23,200
So... is this
something that you,

1225
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:25,333
you know, would consider?

1226
01:01:27,967 --> 01:01:29,166
I don't know.

1227
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,300
Paige, you've
gotta ask yourself.

1228
01:01:31,433 --> 01:01:33,300
Would you rather
sit in a dark room,

1229
01:01:33,433 --> 01:01:36,367
watching videos of
sunsets and snorkeling,

1230
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,033
or would you rather
do those things...

1231
01:01:39,166 --> 01:01:40,900
with me?

1232
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:45,567
Are we still talking
about the show?

1233
01:01:49,433 --> 01:01:51,033
I don't know.

1234
01:01:53,066 --> 01:01:55,700
I don't know
what we're gonna find
if we go down that path.

1235
01:01:55,834 --> 01:01:58,367
Ben, it's not even up to us.

1236
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,367
We'd have to get Millie
to buy in and the network.

1237
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,533
I know.
I agree, but I think
that we should

1238
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:05,967
at least let them know
what we want, right?

1239
01:02:10,567 --> 01:02:14,633
Okay, let me talk to
Millie about it first.

1240
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,433
Okay, got it.

1241
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:20,400
Then maybe tomorrow
night we'll get together,

1242
01:02:20,533 --> 01:02:21,934
and we could strategize.

1243
01:02:22,066 --> 01:02:23,667
-Strategize?
-Yeah.

1244
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,934
This is sounding
suspiciously like a plan.

1245
01:02:26,066 --> 01:02:27,934
-Hmm?
-Nnnnn.

1246
01:02:28,066 --> 01:02:32,066
Okay, a little bit.

1247
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:43,934
Okay, what is
wrong with you?

1248
01:02:44,066 --> 01:02:48,233
What? Nothing.
What? Why?

1249
01:02:48,367 --> 01:02:50,233
You look odd.

1250
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,333
Okay, um...

1251
01:02:55,467 --> 01:02:57,200
I did wanna
ask you a question.

1252
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:58,734
Okay, go ahead.

1253
01:02:58,867 --> 01:03:01,233
Yeah, oh... uh...

1254
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:06,233
so, Ben asked me,

1255
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:11,767
if I would consider thinking
about maybe possibly...

1256
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,100
uh...

1257
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:18,934
continuing on to host
the show next season.

1258
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,800
Wow, that-- that is big.

1259
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:26,667
Couple weeks ago, that was
the last item on your list

1260
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:30,066
of things that you
would consider thinking
about maybe possibly doing.

1261
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,734
I've had a change of heart.

1262
01:03:31,867 --> 01:03:33,600
Is this about your heart?

1263
01:03:33,734 --> 01:03:35,934
No, not... not really.

1264
01:03:36,066 --> 01:03:38,066
I mean, maybe a little.

1265
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,834
This is mostly about
me remembering

1266
01:03:42,967 --> 01:03:46,100
how much I enjoy
doing this job.

1267
01:03:46,233 --> 01:03:49,600
Hosting, seeing the world,

1268
01:03:49,734 --> 01:03:51,467
having fun,

1269
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:54,367
I missed it.

1270
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:58,433
Well...

1271
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:00,166
I've been working with
the network to make a list

1272
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,500
of possible cohosts
for Ben next season.

1273
01:04:02,633 --> 01:04:04,934
So add me to the list.

1274
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,700
Look, the network is
happy with the footage

1275
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:11,300
I've been sending them,
but I made it very clear

1276
01:04:11,433 --> 01:04:12,900
that you're only gonna
be on for one season,

1277
01:04:13,033 --> 01:04:14,367
and if I go back now...

1278
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:17,967
Are you sure
this is what you want?

1279
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,500
It's totally not like you.

1280
01:04:19,633 --> 01:04:21,867
I-I know.

1281
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,433
For the first time in,
well, a long time...

1282
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,600
I have no idea what's
gonna happen next.

1283
01:04:39,133 --> 01:04:42,166
There was a booth
back there that had everything

1284
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,066
from snails to cow tongue.

1285
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,734
Why don't we leave
the cow's tongue to you,

1286
01:04:46,867 --> 01:04:49,400
and I can focus
on the desserts?

1287
01:04:50,633 --> 01:04:53,500
Mike, hey, it's Todd Harper.

1288
01:04:53,633 --> 01:04:55,700
Yes, I got the video
footage you sent.

1289
01:04:55,834 --> 01:04:58,200
Pretty sneaky of the network
to send me footage

1290
01:04:58,333 --> 01:05:00,467
of the people
you replaced me with.

1291
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,600
Yes, very interesting.

1292
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,400
I think we should talk
about my contract again...

1293
01:05:07,533 --> 01:05:09,600
and about Paige Marshall.

1294
01:05:09,734 --> 01:05:11,467
You're the one who
wanted an adventure.

1295
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,467
s

1296
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,300
at the club
in a couple of hours,

1297
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:23,333
and then two days to finish our
"Off the Beaten Path" episode,

1298
01:05:23,467 --> 01:05:24,967
and then we are done.

1299
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,367
What are we doing
tomorrow night again?

1300
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,800
'Cause I was talking to
the bartender, and apparently,

1301
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:32,600
they're supposed
to be this amazing meteor
shower tomorrow night.

1302
01:05:32,734 --> 01:05:35,867
So the stargazing
should be incredible.

1303
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,100
Wow, unfortunately,
the schedule is locked.

1304
01:05:39,233 --> 01:05:41,367
I agree with Ben.

1305
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,000
I think we should try and
include it, it sounds amazing.

1306
01:05:44,133 --> 01:05:46,467
-Really?
-Yeah.

1307
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,500
Well, then, I will see
what I can do.

1308
01:05:49,633 --> 01:05:52,233
Yes. Thank you.

1309
01:05:54,433 --> 01:05:56,300
Where's everybody going?

1310
01:05:56,433 --> 01:05:59,033
Oh, it's the firework
show on the beach.
Happens every week.

1311
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:00,767
Yes, I've
always missed it.

1312
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,166
Hmm.
Well, then we should go.

1313
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,333
Uh, we still have a couple
of things to talk about.

1314
01:06:06,467 --> 01:06:11,166
Yeah, I know, but
we won't be here when they
do it again next week, so...

1315
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,233
That's okay. I'm sure I
can find a video of it.

1316
01:06:14,367 --> 01:06:18,033
And that's almost as good
as seeing it in person, right?

1317
01:06:21,367 --> 01:06:23,033
I'm kidding. Let's go.

1318
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:25,600
Very funny.
See you guys.

1319
01:06:25,734 --> 01:06:27,233
Good meeting.

1320
01:06:27,367 --> 01:06:29,934
So if they agree to
keep us on permanently--

1321
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:32,700
When they agree.

1322
01:06:32,834 --> 01:06:34,834
Have you thought about
where you'd like to go?

1323
01:06:34,967 --> 01:06:36,934
I mean, next season
is already set for Morocco,

1324
01:06:37,066 --> 01:06:41,600
but beyond that, the world
is our proverbial oyster.

1325
01:06:41,734 --> 01:06:43,500
I have no idea.

1326
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:48,066
Truth is, I've never been
very good, planning ahead.

1327
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,233
Okay, I can do
the planning for us both.

1328
01:06:50,367 --> 01:06:52,033
Good.

1329
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:55,400
I can't wait to see Marrakesh.
Have you been?

1330
01:06:55,533 --> 01:06:58,667
No, but I would love
to go anywhere in Morocco.

1331
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,500
Especially Casablanca.

1332
01:07:00,633 --> 01:07:02,166
I've seen that movie,
like, 200 times.

1333
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,934
My favorite movie
of all time.

1334
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:06,300
Me too. That's what made
me think of picking it

1335
01:07:06,433 --> 01:07:07,734
as the next destination.

1336
01:07:07,867 --> 01:07:09,066
-Really?
-Yeah.

1337
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,800
Huh. What do you know?

1338
01:07:13,533 --> 01:07:15,767
Thank you.

1339
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:16,834
For what?

1340
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:18,433
For...

1341
01:07:21,266 --> 01:07:23,667
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

1342
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,967
Look, I realize I'm
supposed to be the expert

1343
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,667
on loud things in motion,
but I'm pretty sure

1344
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,500
you would've found
the fireworks even
without me.

1345
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:35,066
-Not this.
-What?

1346
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,433
I mean...

1347
01:07:37,567 --> 01:07:39,133
hosting
the show, Hawaii.

1348
01:07:39,266 --> 01:07:41,767
Okay, this might be
the bubble talking,

1349
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:45,633
but... I feel different
since I've been here.

1350
01:07:45,767 --> 01:07:47,567
And a lot of that
has to do with you.

1351
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,567
You're pretty good
at making people

1352
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,800
step outside
their comfort zone.

1353
01:07:52,934 --> 01:07:56,166
Thank you.

1354
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:01,367
Wow.

1355
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,700
Hello, Millie?

1356
01:08:33,834 --> 01:08:35,333
I got your message--

1357
01:08:35,467 --> 01:08:36,300
Todd.

1358
01:08:36,433 --> 01:08:37,367
Hello, Paige.

1359
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,800
What are you doing here?

1360
01:08:38,934 --> 01:08:40,900
Well, it's...
good to see you too.

1361
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,867
Sorry, I didn't mean--

1362
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,367
I just, uh... but
what are you doing here?

1363
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,800
Well, it looks like I
didn't have to put together

1364
01:08:48,934 --> 01:08:51,233
a list of hosts for
next season after all.

1365
01:08:51,367 --> 01:08:53,867
You're coming
back to the show?

1366
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,033
Well, we still have
a few "I's" to dot
and "T's" to cross,

1367
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:57,867
but it's looking good.

1368
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,700
I just wanna come down here
and meet with you both

1369
01:08:59,834 --> 01:09:01,600
and make sure we can all be
on the same page about this.

1370
01:09:01,734 --> 01:09:04,600
And if I happen to get a little
sun in the process, well...

1371
01:09:04,734 --> 01:09:07,300
How...
How did this happen?

1372
01:09:07,433 --> 01:09:09,433
I-I thought your contract--

1373
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:11,467
You know how
negotiations can be.

1374
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,200
Look, I thought it was over,
and I was okay with that.

1375
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,633
I mean, let's be honest,
it had gotten a bit stale.

1376
01:09:16,767 --> 01:09:18,567
Stale?

1377
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,266
But then the network sent
me footage of you and Ben,

1378
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,233
and it made me realize
what was possible.

1379
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:25,700
I don't understand.

1380
01:09:25,834 --> 01:09:27,300
You made it fun again.

1381
01:09:27,433 --> 01:09:29,533
The banter.
The back and forth.

1382
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:31,100
I mean, who would
have imagined that

1383
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:32,967
that quiet producer
who stayed in New York

1384
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,133
while we were out doing all
the fun stuff had that in her?

1385
01:09:35,266 --> 01:09:37,033
Well, I think we're
gonna have that same kind

1386
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:39,033
of chemistry too.

1387
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:43,033
Mmm, wait-- you want me
to co-host with you?

1388
01:09:43,166 --> 01:09:45,100
Yes.

1389
01:09:45,233 --> 01:09:48,033
And I told the network it's
the only way I'd come back.

1390
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:51,200
Uh...
what about Ben?

1391
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:55,100
I'm sure he'll
land on his feet.
He's done it before.

1392
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,166
Right.

1393
01:10:00,266 --> 01:10:03,233
Uh, if you just can
excuse me, please.

1394
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:10,066
Paige! Paige, wait!

1395
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,867
Did you know about this?

1396
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,934
I knew that
they were talking,

1397
01:10:14,066 --> 01:10:15,867
but I didn't know what
had gotten this far

1398
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,900
until he showed up
at my door an hour ago.

1399
01:10:18,033 --> 01:10:20,133
They can't just fire Ben.

1400
01:10:20,266 --> 01:10:21,967
It's a one-season deal.

1401
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,767
It was always up to them
if there was gonna
be a season two.

1402
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:27,567
I thought they liked
what Ben and I were doing.

1403
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:31,233
They did, but Ben has
left this show once before,

1404
01:10:31,367 --> 01:10:33,033
and they were afraid
he might do it again.

1405
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:34,767
And they know that
the viewers love Todd.

1406
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,967
Then why keep me?
Why not just...

1407
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,133
Fine, give the show
back to Todd.

1408
01:10:39,266 --> 01:10:41,533
Because he wants you.

1409
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:43,967
And the network likes the
dynamic of having two hosts.

1410
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,800
They think it works.

1411
01:10:45,934 --> 01:10:49,233
Yeah, it works because Ben
and I made it work, together.

1412
01:10:49,367 --> 01:10:53,033
Look, Millie, I didn't
even wanna do this
in the first place,

1413
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,400
and I certainly don't wanna
do it now without Ben.

1414
01:10:55,533 --> 01:10:57,900
Well, Todd doesn't
wanna do it without you.

1415
01:10:58,033 --> 01:11:01,467
He will not sign the contract
unless you agree to co-host.

1416
01:11:02,834 --> 01:11:04,467
Now look at it this way:

1417
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,467
You are in
the driver's seat now.

1418
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,433
You can use this to
get them to agree

1419
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,266
to pick up the show
you pitch them.

1420
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,400
What if I say no?

1421
01:11:16,133 --> 01:11:18,400
You know, I just--
I need to find Ben.

1422
01:11:26,934 --> 01:11:30,000
-Hey, Ben.
-Todd.

1423
01:11:30,133 --> 01:11:32,100
It's good to see you again,
it's been a long time.

1424
01:11:32,233 --> 01:11:34,533
Yeah, wh-what are you
doing here?

1425
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:36,367
You know, I'm a big
fan of Bold World.

1426
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,767
Sure, I appreciate that,
thanks.

1427
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:42,000
I love how you brought
the spirit of your show
to Next Destination.

1428
01:11:42,133 --> 01:11:44,667
We're going to try
and keep as much of that
as possible moving forward.

1429
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,800
Moving forward?

1430
01:11:46,934 --> 01:11:48,500
I must say I'm really looking
forward to coming back

1431
01:11:48,633 --> 01:11:49,967
and co-hosting with Paige.

1432
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,600
I hope that we're
able to recreate

1433
01:11:51,734 --> 01:11:53,667
what you two were able to do.

1434
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,967
I'm sorry, you and Paige...

1435
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,967
are gonna be hosting
Next Destination?

1436
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,367
I know, I'm more
surprised than anyone.

1437
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,400
I think most people have
forgotten about that
whole goat thing.

1438
01:12:03,533 --> 01:12:04,867
Anyways, we'll look
great together.

1439
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sure you will.

1440
01:12:08,133 --> 01:12:09,734
So, no hard feelings
of course, I hope.

1441
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:11,867
No, no, not at all.

1442
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,433
Actually, there she is.

1443
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,734
There she is!

1444
01:12:15,867 --> 01:12:18,000
Well, I'll get out of
your way so you two can
prep for the shoot.

1445
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,000
And it's so nice
seeing you again.

1446
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:24,433
Paige, let's all go out
and grab dinner and catch up.

1447
01:12:24,567 --> 01:12:26,000
Did you...

1448
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,300
did you know about that?

1449
01:12:29,233 --> 01:12:31,867
Ben, I didn't want you
to find out like this.

1450
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,367
Wow.

1451
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,834
Well, I guess, uh...
I guess it is what it is.

1452
01:12:38,967 --> 01:12:40,867
I mean, it's probably
for the best, right?

1453
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,734
No. No, it isn't.
Ben, you and me, we worked.

1454
01:12:44,867 --> 01:12:47,100
Yeah, I know, but
it's like you said--

1455
01:12:47,233 --> 01:12:48,734
it's the Hawaii bubble.

1456
01:12:48,867 --> 01:12:50,266
And it was bound to
burst at some point,

1457
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,000
and I guess...
I guess it just did.

1458
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:53,500
That's not--

1459
01:12:53,633 --> 01:12:55,433
And the truth
about it is that,

1460
01:12:55,567 --> 01:12:58,367
there is a great big
bold world out there
for me to explore,

1461
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,900
so that's...
that's what I'm gonna do.

1462
01:13:01,033 --> 01:13:03,600
You know what? I-I need to
get ready for the segment.

1463
01:13:03,734 --> 01:13:06,500
So do you, so...
I'm gonna go do that,

1464
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:09,066
and I'll meet you
back here, okay?
But it's okay.

1465
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,100
-No.
-No, it really is, it's fine.

1466
01:13:11,233 --> 01:13:14,300
-I'm fine, I really am.
-Ben, wait.

1467
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:38,467
Ben, can we talk?

1468
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,367
Oh, hey, yeah,, actually I
wanted to talk to you too.

1469
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,200
You never did change
the lines in the script.

1470
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:45,700
You know, the last episode
where you say,

1471
01:13:45,834 --> 01:13:47,600
"Thank you for visiting
Hawaii with us,"

1472
01:13:47,734 --> 01:13:50,100
and I say, "We'll see you
at our next destination,"

1473
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:53,333
only, obviously,
we won't be seeing anybody.

1474
01:13:53,467 --> 01:13:55,967
It'll be you and Todd.
So, I think we should
definitely change this.

1475
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,767
Look, Ben, please,
I've been trying to get
five minutes with you.

1476
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,500
Can we talk after?

1477
01:14:00,633 --> 01:14:01,900
No, actually,
right away after,
Luis and I are going

1478
01:14:02,033 --> 01:14:03,266
straight to the airport.

1479
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,900
-We're gonna go to Australia.
-What?

1480
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:07,667
Yeah, never been.
It should be fun.

1481
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,500
Okay, let's get this
show on the road.

1482
01:14:09,633 --> 01:14:13,233
Todd, you're
coming with us?

1483
01:14:14,967 --> 01:14:16,333
Dressed like that?

1484
01:14:16,467 --> 01:14:18,000
Paige, you should
know by now

1485
01:14:18,133 --> 01:14:20,200
to leave the wardrobe
decisions to me.

1486
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,100
Don't worry, you look fine.

1487
01:14:22,233 --> 01:14:23,533
You always did know best.

1488
01:14:25,133 --> 01:14:26,367
Ben.

1489
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,967
You look great.

1490
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,500
I thought we were
going to be at the beach.

1491
01:14:43,633 --> 01:14:45,166
Millie, you said water.

1492
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,700
Water fall.

1493
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:50,266
This better be worth it.

1494
01:15:01,967 --> 01:15:04,066
-Are you ready?
-Uh...

1495
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,667
we were gonna change
some of the lines up.

1496
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,667
We can just wing it.

1497
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,900
Really, just wing it?

1498
01:15:11,033 --> 01:15:13,834
Okay, we're gonna wing it.
We're ready anytime you are.

1499
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:16,433
Okay,
everyone, final segment.

1500
01:15:16,567 --> 01:15:18,567
Here we go, and action.

1501
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,233
Welcome to Waimea Valley.

1502
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:22,333
We're here at
the iconic waterfall

1503
01:15:22,467 --> 01:15:24,633
in this beautiful
tropical rain forest.

1504
01:15:24,767 --> 01:15:26,633
And if you time it just right,

1505
01:15:26,767 --> 01:15:28,233
you might be able
to catch the sun

1506
01:15:28,367 --> 01:15:29,734
shining through the mist,

1507
01:15:29,867 --> 01:15:31,633
which creates these
incredible rainbows.

1508
01:15:31,767 --> 01:15:33,633
And it's a beautiful
hike to get here as well.

1509
01:15:33,767 --> 01:15:35,233
My feet
can attest to the fact

1510
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:37,633
that it is indeed
off the beaten path.

1511
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:39,834
I told you to wear
comfy shoes. I told him!

1512
01:15:39,967 --> 01:15:41,166
When will I ever learn?

1513
01:15:47,533 --> 01:15:51,467
Well, Ben, it looks like this
is the end of our journey.

1514
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,133
So it would seem.
What was your favorite part?

1515
01:15:55,266 --> 01:16:00,333
Oh, well, it's hard
to pick just one.

1516
01:16:00,467 --> 01:16:04,133
We went snorkeling,
saw some beautiful sunsets.

1517
01:16:04,266 --> 01:16:06,900
Ate some really good food.
Went to a luau.

1518
01:16:07,033 --> 01:16:08,233
We even danced.

1519
01:16:08,367 --> 01:16:11,033
Whoa. Hey, now,
one of us danced.

1520
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:13,133
I don't know what
you were doing there.

1521
01:16:13,266 --> 01:16:16,500
That's not fair.
I'm a great dancer.

1522
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:22,266
I had a lot of fun at the
dance with you, I really did.

1523
01:16:23,967 --> 01:16:26,734
Me too. Thank you.

1524
01:16:29,867 --> 01:16:31,633
And thank you.

1525
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:34,200
We hope you enjoyed
our visit to Hawaii.

1526
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:36,667
-I'm Paige Marshall.
-And I'm Ben Burton.

1527
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,166
We wish you well
on your journey to...

1528
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,266
your Next Destination.

1529
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:46,667
Wherever it may be.

1530
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,867
-And cut. That's perfect.
-I agree.

1531
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,834
Um, we can do another
take if you want.

1532
01:16:51,967 --> 01:16:53,800
No, no, no, that's good,
that was it, that was the one.

1533
01:16:53,934 --> 01:16:56,166
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

1534
01:16:56,300 --> 01:17:00,233
that is a wrap on
Next Destination: Hawaii.

1535
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,066
Paige, great work.
You know, I was thinking,

1536
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,367
we can script some of that
spontaneous banter you guys do.

1537
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,100
Or we can plan out
what to say.

1538
01:17:14,233 --> 01:17:15,934
Todd, we can't plan...

1539
01:17:16,066 --> 01:17:18,033
Can we talk about this
later? I really...

1540
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:20,700
You know, Millie was
talking about Morocco
for next season.

1541
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:22,300
But what about Japan?

1542
01:17:22,433 --> 01:17:25,233
I think that might be of
more interest to our viewers.

1543
01:17:25,367 --> 01:17:28,100
Listen, I've got this
great idea, right? We start...

1544
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:37,300
So, Luis, I gotta ask you,

1545
01:17:37,433 --> 01:17:39,133
are you sure you wanna
come with me?

1546
01:17:39,266 --> 01:17:41,333
'Cause I know that Millie would
love to have you stay on.

1547
01:17:41,467 --> 01:17:44,066
Hey, wherever you go,
I go, remember?

1548
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,967
Thanks, pal.
I owe you one.

1549
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:48,834
I got paid to spend
a few weeks in paradise
with my best friend.

1550
01:17:48,967 --> 01:17:50,467
I think we're even.

1551
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,100
Listen, you know
what I was thinking?

1552
01:17:53,233 --> 01:17:54,934
When we get to Australia,

1553
01:17:55,066 --> 01:17:57,667
we should do a couple
of days of research.

1554
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,367
You? Research?

1555
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,667
It's just I don't want us
to miss anything, you know?

1556
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,667
But that's not the Bold World
way, though, right?

1557
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,333
What do you
worry about missing?

1558
01:18:11,934 --> 01:18:16,433
Paige.
I'm gonna miss Paige.

1559
01:18:18,967 --> 01:18:23,433
She made me better,
and she made me crazy, but...

1560
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:28,533
she opened me up
in ways, I haven't been
in a long time,

1561
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:29,900
you know that.

1562
01:18:33,266 --> 01:18:35,266
Its not gonna be
the same without her.

1563
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,734
I'm not gonna be
the same without her.

1564
01:18:41,033 --> 01:18:42,467
Aloha.

1565
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,533
Welcome passengers
on Flight 493,

1566
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:48,367
nonstop to Sydney, Australia.

1567
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,900
We're going to be starting
the pre-board process

1568
01:18:51,033 --> 01:18:52,633
in a few minutes.

1569
01:18:52,767 --> 01:18:54,667
Passengers may be seated...

1570
01:19:01,233 --> 01:19:04,200
Thinking about going up?

1571
01:19:04,333 --> 01:19:07,967
No.
 I'm just gonna live vicariously through other people.

1572
01:19:09,667 --> 01:19:13,100
Oh, honey, I think you know
that living vicariously

1573
01:19:13,233 --> 01:19:15,133
is not really living at all.

1574
01:19:15,266 --> 01:19:19,033
Yeah, I guess
I'm just not that good

1575
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:22,600
at being bold on my own.

1576
01:19:22,734 --> 01:19:25,367
I kinda need....

1577
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,100
And what would you
do if Ben were here?

1578
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,800
I'd... I'd quit.

1579
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:39,700
I'd say, "Millie I am
tired of pretending

1580
01:19:39,834 --> 01:19:43,600
like I have this great
plan for my life,

1581
01:19:43,734 --> 01:19:48,266
when I actually have no real
power to make it happen.

1582
01:19:50,734 --> 01:19:53,533
I'm tired of waiting for
other people to say yes,

1583
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:58,166
when I wanna do
the things that I wanna do.

1584
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:02,066
I wanna go snorkeling,
and UTV-ing,

1585
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,967
and laugh along with the
people who are laughing at me

1586
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,967
when I do dumb things.

1587
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:11,900
And then I would...

1588
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:17,967
go on a turn to Ben
and say,

1589
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,600
"Let's go
and see the world."

1590
01:20:23,934 --> 01:20:25,633
Millie, I quit.

1591
01:20:25,767 --> 01:20:28,533
-Wait, what?
-Yeah.

1592
01:20:28,667 --> 01:20:30,800
Well, I-I didn't think
you were serious!

1593
01:20:30,934 --> 01:20:32,900
Do you really
need me to repeat?

1594
01:20:33,033 --> 01:20:36,567
No, I just, I thought
that was just musings.

1595
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:39,867
Paige, as the executive
producer of Next Destination,

1596
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,800
I have to tell you
that is totally unacceptable.

1597
01:20:42,934 --> 01:20:44,133
You made a commitment to me

1598
01:20:44,266 --> 01:20:46,600
and everybody that
works on this show,

1599
01:20:46,734 --> 01:20:48,367
and for you to just
throw that all away

1600
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,767
without any regard to
the impact that it has,

1601
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:54,734
it's both unprofessional,
and shortsighted.

1602
01:20:54,867 --> 01:20:56,200
What is this?

1603
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:57,700
That is Ben's
flight information,

1604
01:20:57,834 --> 01:20:59,433
and if you hurry up,
you can still catch him.

1605
01:21:02,633 --> 01:21:04,633
I'm getting better
at this feelings thing.

1606
01:21:04,767 --> 01:21:07,033
What about Todd?

1607
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:09,200
I'll just double
his wardrobe budget,
he'll be fine.

1608
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:10,967
Go!

1609
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,533
Then go!

1610
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:18,367
Ow.

1611
01:21:20,133 --> 01:21:23,734
Hey...
that's a lot.

1612
01:21:42,266 --> 01:21:44,633
Thank you.

1613
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,133
The flight to Australia.

1614
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:57,834
What?

1615
01:22:43,033 --> 01:22:44,433
You missed your flight.

1616
01:22:44,567 --> 01:22:46,066
What can I say?

1617
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,100
I wanted one last
Hawaiian sunset.

1618
01:22:50,533 --> 01:22:51,867
I heard you bought
a plane ticket

1619
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
to try and catch me
at the gate.

1620
01:22:54,133 --> 01:22:55,233
Is that what you heard?

1621
01:22:55,367 --> 01:22:58,333
Oh, yeah,
that's what I heard.

1622
01:22:58,467 --> 01:23:00,633
Hmm.

1623
01:23:03,567 --> 01:23:04,667
So, what do we do now?

1624
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:09,400
Oh...
I don't know.

1625
01:23:09,533 --> 01:23:11,800
-I don't have a job.
-Yeah.

1626
01:23:11,934 --> 01:23:15,000
I don't have a plan.

1627
01:23:15,133 --> 01:23:18,667
I don't know where I'm going.

1628
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,066
I just hope that
it's with you.

1629
01:23:27,033 --> 01:23:30,367
You know what?
I've got a plan.

1630
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,567
Come on, where are we?
Let me take this thing off.

1631
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:38,567
No, no, not yet.

1632
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,834
Okay. It's your show.

1633
01:23:40,967 --> 01:23:43,433
Well, we couldn't go
when we were in Hawaii,

1634
01:23:43,567 --> 01:23:46,967
so I thought we
would go now in...

1635
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,266
Bali!

1636
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,133
Oh, yes! Luis,
come on, come over.

1637
01:23:51,266 --> 01:23:52,834
You gotta see this.
Move forward.

1638
01:23:52,967 --> 01:23:54,767
I'm not
getting anywhere near

1639
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,400
the edge of that platform.

1640
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:59,834
Well, if you like this,

1641
01:23:59,967 --> 01:24:02,633
then you're gonna
love where we go next.

1642
01:24:02,767 --> 01:24:05,867
As long as I'm with you,
I know I'm gonna love it.

1643
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:21,900
Whoo!
