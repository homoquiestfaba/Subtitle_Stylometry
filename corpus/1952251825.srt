1
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,403
 I wanted really good to my mother 

2
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,699
 She was drug addict 

3
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,994
 alcoholic 

4
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,039
 had become almost blind 

5
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,709
 was schizophrenic 

6
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,545
 But I never forgot that I loved 

7
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,047
 although even if you did 

8
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,134
 continuously, 

9
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,053
 continuously ... 

10
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,142
 continuously. 

11
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,616
 Give me the money! 

12
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,951
 Are mine! 

13
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,120
 Are mine, the state from them to me! 

14
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,081
 If you do not like us do not eat! 

15
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,502
 Do not touch me, touch me not! 

16
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:07,878
 Where are they, eh? 
 Where are they? 

17
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,379
 Leave me! 

18
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:16,011
 Damele now! 
 Give me, I said! 

19
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,811
 I have them given to you, 
 you have taken. 

20
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,398
 I ve data 100 

21
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,610
 When I arrived the check 
 I gave $ 100 to any one of you. 

22
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,696
 to keep them from, 
 you understand? 

23
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,407
 Those we serve to live! 

24
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,745
 Time enough, 
 every month the same fucking story 

25
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,165
 If you take them you shoot them in the vein 
 and we die of hunger! 

26
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,542
 They are my ... 

27
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,461
 Well I do not I have taken. 

28
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,129
 You are a liar 

29
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,639
 Give me now, 
 you my stuff! 

30
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,350
 Dangerous! 

31
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,270
 Dangerous! 
 We are hungry! 

32
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,856
 Leave me! 
 Those we need to eat! 

33
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,692
 How you did it to have, eh? 
 You've given their lives. 

34
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,779
 Do you want me to go on the streets 
 a prostituitmi 
 E 'that eh? 

35
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:19,241
 And 'why do you want? 
 You know, I make the robe ... 

36
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,844
 I need ... 

37
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,849
 I need 

38
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,854
 I need 

39
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,442
 A Medina? 

40
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,031
 It 'true, and you get to $ 15,200 
 at the end of the round of double jeopardy. 

41
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,840
 I wanted to see that smile, 

42
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,052
 Oh God, how I wanted it ... 

43
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,223
 I was pathetic ... 

44
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,855
 All'Acquedotto not go! 

45
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,732
 Mom! 

46
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,028
 Dad ... 

47
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,453
 Is going all'Acquedotto. 
 Accidentals What difference does it make ... 

48
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,081
 Robbery! 
 Who cares! 

49
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,378
 Help her father, does not see, 
 robbery! 

50
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,089
 It 'always the same old story ... 

51
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,557
 Seen, they repaired the lampposts 

52
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,392
 The robbers break them again 

53
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,393
 No, quiet 

54
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,063
 You see, your mother is sure, 
 the water goes down ... 

55
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,983
 There is no water 

56
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,610
 You are wrong, 
 you do not know what the aqueduct? 

57
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:23,699
 The aqueduct brought water to New York City 
 Well, for over 100 years 

58
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,826
 Then they closed but now open 

59
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,705
 and there is water just below 
 what drags your mother. 

60
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,336
 My father, you could sit on the couch 
 and speak with him for hours 

61
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,547
 But you could not speak at length 

62
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,924
 Hey Jane! 

63
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:46,805
 He knew many things, 
 always had the correct answers 
 to quiz jeopardy. 

64
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,850
 He knew all the answers 

65
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,733
 Hey, watch where you are going! 

66
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,656
 This is the way 

67
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,451
 Parents are of your 

68
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:11,705
 I see them as an example of what 
 that I found my long life 

69
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,709
 tended so little to my needs 

70
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,963
 and I feel that their needs 
 was so strong 

71
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:24,051
 that I was neither angry nor suffering 
 that is not me interessasero 

72
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,683
 In short, I said: 
 must be the human condition that has become so 

73
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,278
 Then came reality 

74
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,038
 I have taken the husband 
 Elisabeth I kill you! 

75
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,039
 No, Mom! 

76
00:06:55,707 --> 00:07:00,003
 Did I understand you a favor, you are 
 only a sick slut! 

77
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,881
 Help me clean Liz, see if 
 this casino take away all of us! 

78
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,761
 No, noo! 
 Outside my house! 

79
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,762
 Do not stories! 

80
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,808
 I do not come with you, 
 you understand? Noo, noo! 

81
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,101
 The window is broken 

82
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,270
 I threw out the cat 

83
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,359
 Let me stay, let me stay! 

84
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,405
 Why not try to take your medicine? 

85
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,739
 No, take 

86
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,867
 Just get a little 
 Okay 

87
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,291
 E 'un vero schifo! 
 What have you done here? 

88
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,876
 He took a knife! 

89
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,085
 I fell! 

90
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,295
 Careful hoo hoo! 

91
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,683
 Where's the phone? 
 Non ce l'abbiamo. 

92
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,310
 This story must be solved 
 and now 

93
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,439
 You two have only one alternative: 
 give a cleaner to this post 
 and help your mother! 

94
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,440
 Tell our father! 

95
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,734
 No no, you are a feminist. 

96
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,903
 I can go away or send via your parents. 

97
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:09,907
 Continue to skip school 
 and here is a house that looks like a pigsty! 

98
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,536
 Where to go, come here, go back! 

99
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,039
 Go to school, you have idea how is done? 

100
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,292
 There are girls who beat you and that 
 you steal everything you have! 

101
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,878
 You can not have anything of yours! 

102
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,964
 We do clean the bathrooms, 
 does not work there if you do it here! 

103
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,135
 What happened? 

104
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,390
 Been back, been back! 

105
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,478
 There's nothing to watch 

106
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,815
 Mom! 

107
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,610
 mom 

108
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,532
 mom 

109
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,700
 But I do not notice 

110
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,495
 and yet everyone could view it 
 who suffered so much ... 

111
00:08:56,495 --> 00:09:00,624
 His efforts were so visible 
 but no one dreamed of understanding 

112
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,294
 It's not that if you rub it 
 or not that was a good mother 

113
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,798
 was that now she no longer had anything to lose 

114
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,676
 Fammi winds with you! 

115
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,208
 Here's the task, I hope you've finished. 

116
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,877
 Well, take your places! 

117
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,421
 Hey that stinks! 

118
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,590
 But what ... 

119
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,511
 I was always the one that stinks in the classroom 

120
00:09:54,511 --> 00:10:01,310
 Lisa has many benefits 
 But Dad said that was supposed to marry 
 a doctor if he had so many expectations 

121
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,771
 on the contrary I did not have any expectations, so ... 

122
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,863
 I scratched for lice, 
 between the legs also mi prude 

123
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,408
 My teachers always told me 
 not to get excited 

124
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,577
 My laundry ... 

125
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,996
 I did not know what to do with the linen 

126
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,498
 the bore until it is torn 

127
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,544
 Forza ragazzi, come back to place, 
 the interval is over. 

128
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,009
 I had bad teeth, 

129
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,010
 I was hungry ... 

130
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,097
 The teachers are treating her not to touch me 

131
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:44,937
 And 'as if those words falling on the floor 

132
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:47,689
 Give me the test, it is unnecessary for you to do. 
 No, I want to do it. 

133
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,858
 But if you're almost never came to class! 

134
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,569
 I want to do it ... 
 does not seem difficult 

135
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:54,738
 OK ... 

136
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,668
 Liz, wait 

137
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,841
 Do you have a bad odor, Liz, 
 not your mother tells you to .. 

138
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,887
 No, no ... 
 it is my fault because I forgot 

139
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:23,725
 Well, tonight when you do shower 
 remember to wash behind here 

140
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,604
 I have put aside a few things 

141
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,654
 Here ... 

142
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,285
 And this, but how did you do? 

143
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,037
 We've never in school 

144
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:47,291
 I read a lot 

145
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,167
 really, and what? 

146
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,794
 Well Encyclopedia 

147
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:56,008
 The lady of the upstairs, Eva, 
 it was found in a box 

148
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:59,511
 is almost complete, in short ... 
 R apart from the S 

149
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:04,474
 if the test there were questions between the R and S 
 I have the wrong 

150
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:08,604
 Oh Liz, you have to come to school 
 OK 
 say seriously 

151
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,772
 you are too intelligent not to be here 

152
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,775
 I do not understand why we come. 
 There will come. 

153
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,780
 How did a tell you that the school made me sad? 

154
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:23,493
 I did not know how to speak, 
 I did not know how to talk to anyone. 

155
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:28,665
 My house was not a place where you can grow up 
 and be normal. 

156
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,627
 If too many absences will have to call the social worker 

157
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:34,421
 and is not a threat, 
 is a promise. 

158
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:51,897
 Eva, look what I got, 
 thanks to your encyclopedia! 

159
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:55,943
 Brava, you must always take votes bei! 
 Un'idiota not want to be ... 

160
00:12:55,943 --> 00:13:00,405
 and keep hard, give me right 
 now that your mother is back 

161
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,575
 My mother has returned? 

162
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:08,163
 Ah, we passed a couple of quiet months, 
 is not it? 

163
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:14,378
 The good thing that my mother had been 
 in hospital was that when he returned was 
 my mother again 

164
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:21,718
 Cooked, slept, he began to study 
 shorthand for the company in a 
 while he was out of the community. 

165
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,347
 But then, the drugs appear ... 

166
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,690
 Mom .. 

167
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,205
 mom 

168
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,707
 Lizzy 

169
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,300
 Are you OK? 
 Yes, I'm good. 

170
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,513
 Sparrows, 
 just six beautiful, you know? 

171
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,099
 I am happy that you are here 

172
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,104
 .. and you are happy? 

173
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:18,233
 Well, see the hospital ... 

174
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,944
 was not all that bad. 

175
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:27,784
 No, it's not true, 
 the walls were high and also 
 the bars on the windows 

176
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:31,997
 I'm sorry, you know, you had to view it 

177
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,042
 Are accustomed 

178
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,711
 But now you are here 

179
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:49,640
 Look, 
 you see I took Mom 100 

180
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,606
 Ma. no .. 
 100 is a good vote, 100 is the highest. 

181
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,900
 Do not you ever taken, Mom? 

182
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,986
 No 

183
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,157
 I am not going to school 

184
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:13,288
 I ran that I was too young. 
 Do not ever run away from home, you understand? 

185
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,040
 No, I will not 

186
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:24,800
 I ... I will always here with you 

187
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,053
 I know, Mom 

188
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,640
 I will always be there ... remember 

189
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,352
 Sure, Mom 

190
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,482
 I am sick ... 

191
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:46,405
 are sick ... are sick, are sick ... 

192
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,200
 I have AIDS ... 

193
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,662
 No. .. no ... 

194
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,790
 No, no no ... You do not need to be afraid 

195
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:05,465
 They say that we must not be afraid 
 because I could say that well be able 
 to survive, you understand? 

196
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,676
 but not here ... 

197
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:13,807
 I have to go home .. 
 you're already home! 

198
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:17,186
 No, at home by my father, 
 and Lisa take you with me 

199
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,479
 No, no, you have to stay here 

200
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:25,277
 I have to stop drugs, 
 with your father and I can not close 

201
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,405
 But he will only 

202
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:35,245
 Liz, your sister has already left, 
 courage now 
 prepare your stuff and andiamocene 

203
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:39,791
 I do not want, 
 you have you said that you beat your father, 
 who had raped your sister 

204
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,792
 Now this is what I do 

205
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,046
 No, stay here 

206
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,507
 I can not ... 

207
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,967
 remains mum .. 

208
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,053
 Everything was in pieces 

209
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:54,765
 I thought that if I had stayed 
 I have stopped the destruction 

210
00:16:54,765 --> 00:17:00,521
 or at least I would be able 
 to not make things worse. 

211
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,290
 Want to open the door? 

212
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,837
 E 'inutile, I know you're at home. 

213
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,850
 Your mother and your sister? 

214
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,018
 Left 

215
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,353
 and your father? 

216
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:44,189
 went to take food, 
 back immediately. 

217
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,362
 We called the school, continues to do away ... 

218
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:55,200
 never go there .. 
 We must do something, you understand? 

219
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,538
 Wanda has warned, I have warned you, 
 all the social workers have done 

220
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:00,539
 We have said to you in all ways 

221
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:06,003
 Please clean this place 
 and go to school, 
 clean and go to school, 

222
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:09,923
 but you have not done neither one nor the other ... 
 o sbaglio? 

223
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,466
 No 

224
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,135
 What do you mean? 

225
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,053
 I do not know 

226
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,638
 But I will 

227
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:20,309
 Go into an institution, 
 Come away with me 

228
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:25,188
 No! But things are better now, 
 dad buys me food all day 

229
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,816
 She does not pay the rent, 
 and not send to school 

230
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,860
 I tell him to go, 
 I said to you, is not it Liz? 

231
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,863
 but you think with your head, 
 is a silly feminist 

232
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:38,035
 Are not things that joke, 
 to prepare your suitcase ... 
 now! 

233
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:44,374
 No, no! 
 I swear I'll go to school, please! 

234
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,753
 Sorry, we need an adult 
 who is responsible 

235
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:50,631
 My grandfather was in charge! 
 I take my grandfather! 
 My sister was already by him 

236
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:55,385
 But Lisa goes to school there. 
 We'll go too! 
 I shall promise, please! 

237
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,304
 Not piagnucolare 

238
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:03,101
 Talk to your grandfather 
 and if you take him 
 will be out in 24 hours 

239
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,103
 Here's the bag 

240
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,441
 and if he does not? 

241
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,115
 You will have time to think about how to live life 

242
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:51,275
 Think about how to live life ... 

243
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,569
 how many people really do? 

244
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,572
 We think while sinking? 

245
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,545
 Intercom, and you put 

246
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,506
 it was like to visit my mother 

247
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,468
 Only now I was here in hospital 

248
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,313
 Now do you see! 

249
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,491
 Andiamo! 

250
00:20:55,631 --> 00:21:01,678
 Not 24 hours after I left, 
 and even after 24 days, 
 nobody wanted me. 

251
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:05,349
 I just left them and 

252
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:17,027
 Why not go to school? 

253
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:22,032
 And 'This is the main problem, 
 why do not we go? 

254
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:37,256
 For me 
 your is a problem of discipline 

255
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:59,004
 Hello Liz! 
 Hello grandfather 

256
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:04,134
 You call your mother 
 Hey! Come out, came 

257
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,017
 Are late, 
 but first I wanted to see you 

258
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,227
 Thanks Lisa 

259
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:16,813
 Not all messed up, 
 we are well e. .. 

260
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:22,152
 you do not expect much, is dying 

261
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:29,827
 Lizzy! 

262
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:31,203
 Mom 

263
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:35,290
 Sparrows 

264
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:49,680
 When I think of my life, 
 this is the moment that I like to remember 

265
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,558
 when I went back into the life of my mother 
 was lucid 

266
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,770
 Do not take drugs anymore and so the drugs 
 schizophrenia were for effect 

267
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,815
 We went to the corner bar, 
 sedevamo us to speak 

268
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:03,819
 and ate hamburgher, 
 in short, we were together 

269
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:07,781
 even if he had weak eyes 
 I think we could see 

270
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,409
 ie could see my side dishes, 

271
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,953
 and for a while I had my mother again 

272
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:16,415
 I remember, 
 slide down the hill 

273
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:19,459
 the working board 
 as if it were a sled 

274
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,129
 We still remember? 
 Yes 

275
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:26,967
 And when you did the tickle 
 Of course I remember, 
 I do not remember precisely 

276
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,971
 Yeah, I was a good mother, 
 is not so? 

277
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,687
 Sure Mom, you were good 

278
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:40,230
 Right 

279
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,029
 You know, I am pleased that we are all together now 
 volio tell me, you and Lisa 

280
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:50,991
 Would not it be nice if Dad 
 stop to take drugs? 

281
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:54,203
 Maybe we could go back to University Avenue 

282
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:03,837
 Here, well the fact is that now your father 
 is at a shelter for homeless 

283
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,465
 I fear that we have 
 lost the apartment 

284
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:09,802
 I mean, he never paid the rent, 
 and so, you know ... 

285
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:14,056
 What happened to my stuff? 

286
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,557
 Been thrown 

287
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:18,977
 What? 
 Even my encyclopedia? 

288
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:23,065
 Feel sparrows, I am sorry to die, but 
 they put seals on doors and windows 

289
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:28,487
 In short, there was nothing we could do, 
 is that you know, bad luck is something that  happens 
 I want to say ... 

290
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:33,408
 Listen, I had almost dimanticata that I have to go 
 go around the corner to greet friends 

291
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:36,995
 We put only a minute okay? 
 You finschii Meanwhile the hamburger 

292
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:40,290
 I, I .. torno subito, 
 just stay away, promised 

293
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,918
 only a minute 

294
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:47,065
 It was just so, 
 no more return 

295
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:51,069
 I was not able to maintain anything, 
 I was only worsened things 

296
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,363
 at least if I were going to school ... 

297
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:57,493
 if only I had, 
 if only I had ... 

298
00:26:57,493 --> 00:27:00,078
 and so that part of my life was over 

299
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:05,083
 had begun a new hope ... 

300
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,757

 She is the mother? 
 Yes Like 

301
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:16,637

302
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,138

00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,140
 Hello Mom 
 Hello

 Yes, step away from their friends and

 Thank you 

310
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:02,349
 I was not the girl that stinks, 
 I had learned to get a shower every day 

311
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:07,020
 my clothes, even if they were 
 dell'usato me from the shop were good 

312
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,773
 but still I did not know how to stay in school 

313
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:12,234
 and how do I do to be accepted 

314
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:18,407
 Guys, if we quiet please,

 This is fun 
 lady ... Elisabeth? 

318
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,093
 Do not call me so 

319
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:41,305
 And 'your name, according to these forms 

320
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,141
 Liz or Lizzy 

321
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:48,145
 Liz or Lizzy are diminutives 

322
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:50,606
 They are my names 

323
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:51,607
 No, I do not think so 

324
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,735
 Damn, the name with the name you prefer! 

325
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:59,406
 Elisabeth is a beautiful name, is the name of 
 a queen, the Elizabethan era was 
  Shakespeare 

326
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,158
 What that against that name? 

327
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,247
 My father calls me Elisabeth 
 lost when your head ... 

328
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:14,671

329
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:16,590

00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,969
 Where to go to school? 

331
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:22,262
 We went 

332
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:25,641
 And how did you do? 

333
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,935
 I was in an institution 

334
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:31,355
 A lunatic asylum ... 

335
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,481
 Already 

336
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,277
 but you are not crazy .. 
 No 

337
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:41,949
 Sin, I mean 

338
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:46,745
 I try my Birthday 
 Ah si? And when? 

339
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:50,249
 Ah, you'll see 
 I put the water to my father 

340
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:55,921
 Come to school wearing a pair of boots, 
 the water, and under no ... 

341
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:01,510
 Then open the front of the professors ... 
 Happy birthday ... 

342
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,099
 You do not believe me eh? 

343
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,602
 But you, instead 

344
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:13,021
 It is not true 

345
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:20,839
 It 'a fantastic place, 
 because you did not come before? 

346
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,801
 My grandfather is a little weirdo 
 By the way, we should be out at 6 

347
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:28,889
 Liz, where is your phone? 
 Make that TV game show 
 Lì 

348
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,474
 Do not ever win, Chris! 

349
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:34,561
 Is to see! 
 I just have to make the 
 first that I forget 

350
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:38,315
 Do you understand the theorem? 
 This test is not a week before! 

351
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,776
 Can I take a piece of bread in the fridge? 
 Sure 

352
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,281
 Hey, I'm already 6 
 No. 4 and a half 

353
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:54,665
 E 'un'ubriacona 
 acidente che schifo! 
 He vomited on the door 

354
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:56,708
 I go out the window 

355
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,592
 I do not feel good, 
 help me please 

356
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:08,846
 Courage, come 
 support me 
 strength 

357
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:11,265
 boys who suck! 

358
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:14,434
 go on .. 

359
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:25,487
 I am a good mother, 
 tell who is a good mother 

360
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,951
 Courage! 

361
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:32,786
 Oh my God! 

362
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:12,451
 That's it, 
 the whole six hours pulita 

363
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:17,831
 Could not make a normal life, 
 because I would have to wait due 
 to make a normal death? 

364
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:20,751
 Dying is not for everyone 
 the hardest thing 

365
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,044
 They left 

366
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,340
 except you ... 
 ... already 

367
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,594
 Where to sleep your grandfather? 

368
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:34,139
 Here in bed 
 With his daughter? 

369
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:36,141
 But I do not think in that sense 

370
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,894
 Yeah, but do not know 

371
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:43,899
 Did things with the sister of my mother, 
 so I told her 

372
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,028
 With his sister and not her? 

373
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,533
 perhaps he did so with both ... 

374
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:53,826
 Even his sister is crazy?

375
00:33:56,536 --> 00:34:03,877
 Yes, and also their mother, 
 so do not want to come here 

376
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:09,049
 My mother is about to return with my father 

377
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:14,763
 I want it to do so even my 

378
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,935
 He does things with my sister 

379
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:24,648
 You do not have a sister 

380
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:27,359
 Good for you, no? 

381
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,572
 Have you told your mother? 
 Yes, I told 

382
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:34,741
 When he left, 
 and she cursed him 

383
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:38,537
 He said that would have called the police, 
 and you call him 

384
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:42,124
 I asked how it could do it, 
 and she told me that the missing 

385
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,044
 He missed ... 

386
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,966
 I was 7 years the first time I rapes 

387
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,968
 Chris, Chris, no! 

388
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,556
 Come and stay with me 

389
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:00,350
 What, to be here? 
 Yes 

390
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:04,605
 What .. what to tell your grandfather? 

391
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:08,192
 I do not know him .. 
 We will make sure that you do not ever see 
 insomma .. 

392
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:12,070
 There alzeremo fin that does not go out to go 
 to work you know, he is very precise, 
 leaves at eight 

393
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,115
 ... and back to 6 ... 
 Off! 

394
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:16,950
 but not a place to stay! 

395
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,410
 Not a problem my 

396
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,411
 Leave me your hands! 

397
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:29,046
 Your mother is dying 
 asshole and your father is gone 
 fit with all of you 

398
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,924
 I lost in this old age? 
 Answer! 

399
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,603
 What do you do? 

400
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:52,319
 Do as you like, 
 both end up in hell 

401
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:56,531
 just like your parents 

402
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,921
 I went 

403
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:20,472
 You do, take your stuff or .. 
 Let me go out alone? 

404
00:36:24,143 --> 00:36:26,687
 Who of us can predict 
 your life 

405
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,481
 not sure that there is only inside helmets 

406
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:32,192
 and then we must do our best 

407
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:36,947
 My mother was dying, 
 my father he had gone 

408
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:41,869
 but I believe that I had my way 
 I would have met 

409
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:46,582
 I was 15 years, I was doing .. 

410
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:59,678
 What is a house after all, 
 a roof, a bed 

411
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:05,350
 A place where if you did you 
 you do not take away 

412
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:10,397
 If so, then I had 15 years 
 when I became a homeless 

413
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:12,649
 You have a coin? 
 Go to work 

414
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,573
 Me something? 

415
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,661
 Bought food 

416
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,752
 You have some change left? 

417
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,683
 Sometimes I had the impression 
 that he never had a house 

418
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,953
 Roll the dice 

419
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:33,230
 Andiamo 

420
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,794
 Hey, stop! 

421
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:07,264
 At other times I knew 
 that was my mother anywhere 
 that was my house 

422
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,219
 Oddio .. 

423
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:52,684
 but over the months she disappeared 

424
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:56,188
 Liz ... 

425
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:00,234
 si .. 

426
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:05,823
 But where end? 

427
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:08,700
 Here I was with friends 

428
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,958
 I have six non - 

429
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:25,008
 Well grandpa has beaten me and I .. 

430
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:28,804
 I could not stay here 

431
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:30,389
 but sure ... 

432
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:37,938
 your sister told me that you 
 stopped going to school 

433
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,440
 is true, but we will come back 

434
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,484
 and when? 

435
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:48,031
 when starai better 

436
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,998
 all make fun of me 

437
00:40:55,998 --> 00:41:02,504
 Liz thinks I make fun of 
 those of the bar, why tremble 

438
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:06,049
 and I can not stop shaking 

439
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:12,347
 I think it is the fault of too much alcohol, Mom 

440
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,558
 you should stop 

441
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:19,479
 Ok, ok .. 

442
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:29,573
 can you heal .. 

443
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,673
 I love you 

444
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,052
 mom 

445
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:53,805
 I love you 

446
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:20,332
 is resumed with pictures 

447
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,468
 dai, hurry! 

448
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:46,108
 I arrive first! 
 You are wrong, look 

449
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:57,536
 Boys expect, 
 we are after ok? 
 Vado a moment a.. 

450
00:42:57,953 --> 00:42:59,329
 Hello 

451
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:02,374
 mom 

452
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:10,883
 We made a collection 

453
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:17,014
 she no longer believes it 
 that you take all the fun 

454
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:23,270
 is dead ... 
 died yesterday morning 

455
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:27,501
 Sometimes I feel that there is 
 a kind of skin beneath 

456
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:31,797
 I wish that those who are born in us 
 can look through 

457
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:35,259
 but can not pass through 

458
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:49,982
 My mother was buried in 51 
 lot of the poor 

459
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,489
 My mother was inside them, 
 the strangers had put the 
 in the enclosure 

460
00:44:57,948 --> 00:45:03,954
 was naked, scared ... 
 no, had died just 

461
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:07,249
 Hurry, let's go 
 No, a moment 

462
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:11,795
 What is the function, 
 there should be a priest, 
 is not that you use? 

463
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:14,465
 When one dies, the buried, 
 everything here 

464
00:45:14,465 --> 00:45:15,966
 E 'una donna ... 

465
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:19,136
 And it is my mother 

466
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:23,348
 There is the priest? 
 Not in these cases, do not you know? 

467
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:27,060
 Ah so is dead, 
 put underground 

468
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:38,822
 Priest or a priest, that mattered, 
 if you had gone, and perhaps had 
 already begun to rot 

469
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:40,699
 I'm sorry 

470
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:45,370
 and I had to believe that he had found 
 Peace 

471
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:54,713
 Come with us? 

472
00:45:57,466 --> 00:45:59,760
 Why do not you leave? 

473
00:46:03,513 --> 00:46:05,224
 Hey, wait 

474
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:15,127
 Ok .. 

475
00:47:22,301 --> 00:47:24,094
 So I leave here 

476
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:35,439
 Listen, the fact is that I can not 
 I .. non ce la faccio più ... 
 and then I leave here 

477
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:38,358
 Where? 

478
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:41,278
 In an institution 

479
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:43,155
 In a mental hospital .. 

480
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:48,702
 You know Lizzy, this is here, 
 this is the lunatic asylum! 

481
00:47:51,747 --> 00:47:54,500
 Come with me 

482
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,593
 Ok, see you around 

483
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:19,358
 People died, 
 things are mixed up 

484
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:24,238
 everything that is apparently so solid 
 becomes devoid of meaning 

485
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,618
 there remain only 
 gestures we do 

486
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:34,706
 gestures in the air, 
 this is what remains 

487
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:37,668
 I remember racing to my mother 
 in the crowd, 

488
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:45,509
 I felt the warmth of his arms around me, 
 when I was little, 
 when she was good 

489
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:47,886
 but it was so long ago, 

490
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:50,264
 maybe it happened once 

491
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:56,395
 I was betrayed perhaps a hundred times 
 but it does not matter, 
 I have never been good at keeping accounts 

492
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:58,522
 them we choose our memories 

493
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:01,525
 Sign out of them! 

494
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:15,873
 Where do you put the tombstone? 

495
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,209
 No plaque, no space 

496
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:27,634
 Time a week 
 and there would have been more 
 track her 

497
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:35,476
 but that mattered, 
 that was not the reality, 
 the reality is only in our hearts 

498
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:30,823
 She lived in my heart, 
 but I am not living anywhere, 
 I was alone in the world 

499
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,455
 You have 16 years and the third media 

500
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:43,168
 and you are a prisoner of a spiral 
 all sinks in worst place 
 you have ever dreamed 

501
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:47,923
 There is nothing inside of you, 
 you've exhausted every possible 
 to be accepted 

502
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,844
 and all those who believe in you 
 you set them repinti 

503
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:58,308
 Eva? 

504
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:11,071
 I do not want to be an idiot, 
 I want to go to school 

505
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:55,616
 Yes 
 Hello, I am Liz Murray, 
 I have an appointment 

506
00:51:56,575 --> 00:51:59,745
 at 9 and a half, 
 10 are the 

507
00:52:00,746 --> 00:52:03,832
 Sorry, the Underground was .. 
 sorry to me, but now it's too late 

508
00:52:06,335 --> 00:52:13,050
 The school started 2 weeks ago 
 and we have only boys that 
 come on time, dear 

509
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:21,517
 The brochure says: broad participation 
 Student Development 
 of a community calendar 

510
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:26,730
 I just need a chance 

511
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:34,571
 You can wait to talk to Daniel, 
 but a meeting immediately after 

512
00:52:55,384 --> 00:52:57,886
 I understood at that moment that I had to make a choice: 

513
00:52:57,886 --> 00:53:02,349
 I could surrender to what happened 
 creandomi living a life of excuses 

514
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:09,565
 or I could make an effort, 
 I could make an effort 
 and make my life better 

515
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:33,630
 We'll let you know Friday. 
 Ok, thanks 
 E 'stato un piacere 

516
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:37,509
 Elisabeth 
 Liz 

517
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:40,053
 Liz I am sorry, but those 
 were the last admissions 

518
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:42,764
 Oh, yes, but I can speak for a moment, 30 seconds? 

519
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:46,477
 You should make a request, 
 there is a questionnaire 

520
00:53:46,477 --> 00:53:50,606
 E.. here I have already made 
 Give me a chance ... 

521
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:04,995
 There are no adults ever been 
 able to give me confidence, to feel 
 and then to give me an education .. 

522
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:08,832
 In short, I do not know how to talk to you, here is 
 still 

523
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:17,090
 My parents were, takes drugs, 
 I do not want to like them, 
 is as though I had lived their lives 

524
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:21,345
 Today is different, I feel confused 
 and I do not understand many things 

525
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:24,431
 including why 
 refused school 
 and I stop at the third media 

526
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:26,558
 What I see though your 
 results were good 

527
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:31,021
 I did see the last week 
 in time for exams, 
 that's how I was brought 

528
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:37,110
 So who are intelligent, I can do it, 
 .., I just need a chance 

529
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:43,450
 a chance to emerge 
 the world they were born, do you understand? 

530
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:49,248
 Those who live are so empty, tired, 
 and are left to survive 

531
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:56,672
 But I know that there is an outside world that .. 
 which is better, you see? 

532
00:54:56,672 --> 00:55:02,427
 E. more developed. 
 And is what I want to live 

533
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:03,428
 Why only now? 

534
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:12,187
 My mother died of AIDS a couple of months ago 
 and for me was ... 

535
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:16,859
 beh ecco .. 
 a bad day 

536
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:23,782
 I always thought it would be healed 
 and it would be taken care of me .. 

537
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:28,162
 Bella nonsense .. 

538
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:32,750
 You have not dealt with me, 
 I worked for her .. 

539
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:36,253
 was my baby 

540
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,843
 hours if they have gone .. 
 and so I ... 

541
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:46,221
 It 'time for you take care 
 of yourself 

542
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:51,351
 ce la fai to get here 
 in time, Liz? 

543
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:55,355
 Sleep here, if necessary 

544
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:56,356
 Ok, you're eligible 

545
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:59,860
 But others said that 
 it would have known Friday 

546
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,153
 Tu ci sei 

547
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:04,948
 Thanks! 
 He changed my life! 

548
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:06,116
 Did you just enough 

549
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:11,622
 You must fill out other forms Liz, 
 the usual routine, peaceful 

550
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:16,043
 address, telephone number 
 hours we will have to talk to your father, 
 even for him 

551
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:19,755
 Take it here, and you can start 

552
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:51,662
 Dad 

553
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,710
 Lizzy! 

554
00:56:58,919 --> 00:57:02,756
 I need your help, please .. 

555
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:09,346
 All this is absurd, I do not understand 
 I wanted to say, why do not you will stay here in the Bronx 
 and maybe you will go to Kennedy eh? 

556
00:57:09,346 --> 00:57:11,515
 I can not do the normal school 

557
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:14,017
 Why, this is not a normal school? 

558
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:17,354
 Well, it is public, but it is as if it were private 
 Already 

559
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:18,855
 Dad, Dad! 

560
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:24,445
 I am able to do this school 

561
00:57:24,445 --> 00:57:29,241
 Listen to me, I'm glad, 
 but I can not do anything 

562
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:30,242
 Yes you can, you .. 

563
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:35,914
 You could say that you're a trucker and 
 who travel a lot, and so do not 
 you will never 

564
00:57:35,914 --> 00:57:38,083
 and maybe live with your companion 

565
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:41,670
 Already, a truck driver who travels, 
 and then I have a companion buckle 

566
00:57:43,422 --> 00:57:46,675
 Here .. I can not, 
 is my mother 

567
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:48,385
 Listen I need .. 

568
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:51,221
 only one address, you understand? 

569
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:54,016
 A phone number that they can call 

570
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:57,478
 Please, please, 
 do not need to know that are homeless 

571
00:57:57,478 --> 00:58:01,398
 or call the district 
 and I will be locked again 

572
00:58:02,357 --> 00:58:05,194
 Ok .. 
 Yes 
 Ok 

573
00:58:09,906 --> 00:58:15,662
 Mr Murray 
 I am Peter, Peter Fidelty, 
 in fact I never married the mother of Liz 

574
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:18,040
 Sit down, please 

575
00:58:23,212 --> 00:58:28,133
 I am very grateful that recognize 
 My daughter, in short, 

576
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:29,426
 here is pretty good 

577
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:31,929
 And 'the beginning, but we have great ambitions 

578
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:34,515
 Liz also believe, 
 she's a feminist 

579
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:36,558
 but perhaps this already knows 

580
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:41,438
 you see, his mother was beautiful, 
 looked like a movie star 
 and she was also a kind of feminist 

581
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:42,439
 or stuff like 

582
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,738
 Anyway I thought it was just a little 
 lively, while she was completely crazy 

583
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:52,449
 We need to put a signature here. 
 Sure. 

584
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:56,161
 and we also provide an address 
 and a phone number 

585
00:58:58,247 --> 00:59:02,793
 Yes, 3454 University Avenue 

586
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:07,673
 There are a number of apartment? 
 Yes, 2b 
 3b, 3b! Already 3b, right 

587
00:59:07,673 --> 00:59:10,008
 It 'true, we will transfer 
 upstairs 

588
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:11,009
 Telephone number? 

589
00:59:15,556 --> 00:59:26,567
 718 5 55 57 67 
 555 55 67 

590
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:29,194
 Excuse me, are somewhat out of phase 

591
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:32,281
 Well, all 
 why I have things to do 

592
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:33,657
 Sure, it's all 

593
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:36,618
 Thanks Peter 
 Thank you 

594
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:39,788
 Can I start now? 

595
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:42,916
 It 'good that you've really 
 want to come to school, 
 brava 

596
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:45,252
 Accompany him outside 

597
00:59:57,556 --> 01:00:02,352
 Damn 
 oh that is just going to go single chip? 

598
01:00:02,352 --> 01:00:05,188
 No, see, I found a job 

599
01:00:05,188 --> 01:00:10,360
 You know Liz, I remember when you were small 
 and walked to the shops in Foren Road 
 near the station 

600
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,238
 How many years you had? 
 8 

601
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:22,206
 I am a lonely man, 
 you know 
 Yes 

602
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:24,625
 In short, they are not 
 a sociable person 

603
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:28,754
 I have nothing to do with you, 
 it is not a personal 

604
01:00:28,754 --> 01:00:31,048
 But today you came ... 
 Already 

605
01:00:35,094 --> 01:00:36,678
 I love you 

606
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:40,516
 oh do not do, 
 you would not well, 
 it is a waste of energy 

607
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:50,609
 You know, when I was young 
 me to you was the most interesting 

608
01:00:50,609 --> 01:01:01,161
 In short, everyone was talking only 
 drug or sex 
 and get enough in the evening 

609
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:04,540
 You you have ever 
 had some ideas 

610
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:11,797
 it is thanks to you I know that there is 
 another way of being 

611
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:16,051
 Already .. 

612
01:01:18,637 --> 01:01:20,138
 You're all right? 

613
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:25,728
 Yes, I'm good, you take care of me 
 down to the service center 

614
01:01:25,728 --> 01:01:28,730
 In fact they are to me 
 my apartment everything, 

615
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:32,150
 and this way you can 
 come to find when you 

616
01:01:33,443 --> 01:01:34,778
 An apartment your ... 

617
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:40,534
 Yes, you know they like to do so, 
 I mean, hold people like me 
 out of the dorms 

618
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:46,415
 understand it, patients, 
 people with AIDS here ... 

619
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:52,838
 Hey Listen, there is different from when 
 it happened to Jane, 
 there are a lot of medicine 

620
01:01:52,838 --> 01:01:56,759
 I am clean, well survive 

621
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:05,768
 Ok, stay healthy, 
 I will live forever 

622
01:02:10,439 --> 01:02:18,405
 Continue to study, 
 I have failed, 
 ma tu ce la puoi fare 

623
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:41,011
 The coup of Tonkin 
 I remember the Maine 
 Another? The Franco-Prussian War? 

624
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:45,349
 You took Bismark 
 Do not have taken Bismark 
 I have taken six 

625
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:49,478
 I thought that was a sandwich Bismark 
 Ma che dici! 
 Bismark Perhaps it was a rustic .. 

626
01:02:49,478 --> 01:02:52,481
 Enough talk about food, 
 me be hungry 

627
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:55,984
 Daniel will book next year? 
 Why do not lose that, they 

628
01:02:55,984 --> 01:03:01,573
 Books eh? 
 Why we do not use textbooks? 
 Someone knows? 

629
01:03:01,573 --> 01:03:05,536
 Too heavy 
 Bsss they are, but it is not true 

630
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:09,581
 They cost too much, 
 the school does not have enough money 
 Bsss yet we have not kids 

631
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:14,878
 You, the new 
 Her name is Liz! 
 E 'here for a week, tries to Remember 

632
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:19,633
 Liz follow, 
 please ... 

633
01:03:19,633 --> 01:03:22,803
 Textbook, 
 text ... 
 book ... 

634
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:27,766
 Up, open it, 
 what you see? 

635
01:03:27,766 --> 01:03:29,184
 Words 

636
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:31,854
 What kind of words? 

637
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:33,522
 Those of 

638
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:37,401
 No, no, 
 it is important 

639
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:40,279
 and here we have? 

640
01:03:42,072 --> 01:03:43,991
 Many words of other people 

641
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:46,410
 they prefer and why? 

642
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:54,585
 Why only one point of view 
 shows us a world-dimensional 

643
01:03:56,086 --> 01:03:58,881
 Correct answer, here is the prize! 

644
01:03:58,881 --> 01:04:04,136
 Bismarck, Marx, the guy who sold me 
 the tires that you do as a reward 

645
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:10,434
 do not be put in the borders 
 of his ... history, but history 

646
01:04:10,434 --> 01:04:13,771
 David explained better, in short, 
 there is no official history? 

647
01:04:13,771 --> 01:04:16,773
 New girl, 
 tell him what is the story 

648
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:24,990
 The soria is .. we ... 
 all our stories 

649
01:04:29,453 --> 01:04:36,084
 It 's, take the handouts, 
 I will be in the room received 
 if you want to talk 

650
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:47,221
 Liz, this is your 

651
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:06,156
 Hello new girl 
 I have admitted and you 
 remember my name? 

652
01:05:06,156 --> 01:05:10,410
 It would remind me that, 
 but I want the other 
 side by your side 

653
01:05:11,703 --> 01:05:15,374
 You are very smart 
 Yes, you too 

654
01:05:15,374 --> 01:05:19,336
 I see that I have put a A 
 Yes, it was a very good job 

655
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:24,133
 How come you have given me this vote? 
 Liz, if you have given to you is because you are deserved 

656
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:27,052
 This is your first task in the classroom 
 All Time eh? 

657
01:05:27,469 --> 01:05:32,808
 If my job goes A 
 I want you to me the reasons 

658
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:39,606
 Okay 
 so ... 

659
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:05,215
 Oh! 
 What are you doing still here? 

660
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:09,636
 Algebra 
 Well, I am past the 11, I have to close 

661
01:06:14,475 --> 01:06:16,018
 Sorry, but those who follow courses? 

662
01:06:16,018 --> 01:06:25,194
 Ah, the regulatory cycles, 
 then the program on Saturday, 
 the evening course in French 

663
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:31,033
 and the laboratory sciences 
 after a 
 10 ... 

664
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:34,870
 Now you understand why I have to look 
 at this algebra? 

665
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:40,876
 It 'great! 
 I have 17 years, 
 I do not want to get to 21 without having finished high school 

666
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:44,546
 What would you do, 
 5 years in excess of 3? 

667
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:48,383
 In 2 ... 
 you should revise the mathematics 

668
01:06:48,383 --> 01:06:50,719
 Yeah, but so is dying! 

669
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:55,349
 No. .. 
 that is to live 

670
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:38,809
 I knew the time, the line B 
 put us 70 minutes to do the whole race 

671
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:43,814
 back and forth 4 times 
 and I would be arrived at school just 
 a little in advance 

672
01:07:43,814 --> 01:07:46,149
 Daniel and I would 
 be done 

673
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:50,446
 For the first time my life 
 had a place to which to refer 

674
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:14,595
 Chris? 

675
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:21,143
 Chris, that joy! 
 What surprise 

676
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:22,353
 What are you doing here? 

677
01:08:22,353 --> 01:08:29,026
 I go out 
 You are not at school 
 I have skipped 

678
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:32,404
 Why not have you tried? 
 I did 

679
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:38,577
 I have sought for so long 
 just that ... Well, it's hard here 
 is the sound of this place, you understand? 

680
01:08:38,577 --> 01:08:42,665
 Now I am free 
 and I go to a new school, 
 I see you 

681
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:49,713
 Hey ... 
 quiet 
 courage, it's all right, let us 

682
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:13,570
 The last to leave 
 and the first to arrive? 

683
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:17,157
 Well always arrive after you, Daniel 
 are you the king of punctuality 

684
01:09:17,157 --> 01:09:21,745
 Well, it took me years to learn, 
 at school I was always late 

685
01:09:21,745 --> 01:09:25,666
 Who are you, anyway? 
 My friend Chris, 
 my best friend 

686
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:28,877
 Chris hello 
 Hello 

687
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:32,589
 I want us to be you 
 Watch which is not a nightclub, 
 is a serious 

688
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:36,051
 se va bene a te, 
 will do to you too 

689
01:09:40,514 --> 01:09:46,020
 What do you get in bacheca 
 We decided to send our 10 
 best students on a trip to Boston 

690
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:49,898
 Cool! 
 We've never been? 
 I've never been out of New York 

691
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:53,193
 Once we were in Queens 
 Well, there you go 

692
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:56,989
 Stop it, 
 I do not believe to be among the best 
 10 students 

693
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:00,576
 You're right, 
 you're not among the best, 
 you're the best ... 

694
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:02,911
 You had the votes 
 highest of the whole school 

695
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,875
 and so will you .. Boston 
 Fully charged 

696
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:12,504
 As 
 5 days 

697
01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:24,433
 Va tutto bene? 
 Yes 

698
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:27,811
 It 's just that I am always 
 been a void ... 

699
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:31,523
 You are not a nullity 

700
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:35,360
 The tour serves to make you 
 think of the college 

701
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,323
 And as a college 
 It's not stuff for us, losing leaves 

702
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:42,576
 You could come too .. 
 Can? 

703
01:10:42,576 --> 01:10:45,788
 Of course, if you be to do 
 But to me I could not care 
 a damn! 

704
01:10:45,788 --> 01:10:49,500
 And from Chris 
 Be realistic, 
 what do you want to be great? 

705
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,210
 Why, 
 they do not seem 
 big enough? 

706
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:55,297
 Chris ... 
 I wanted to say after the above, 
 is Ok Liz 

707
01:10:55,297 --> 01:11:00,302
 No, it is not Ok, 
 I am a Barbona, a prostitta 

708
01:11:05,933 --> 01:11:08,310
 And then who cares if 
 what I will be 

709
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:18,487
 E 'fantastico 
 Welcome to Harvard 

710
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:47,933
 So, it's like you imagine it? 

711
01:11:47,933 --> 01:11:52,562
 Better, definitely better 

712
01:11:52,562 --> 01:11:56,817
 Liz, are just people 

713
01:11:56,817 --> 01:11:58,944
 Yes, but are not like me 

714
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:05,743
 Why were not like me? 
 What is that made them so different? 

715
01:12:05,743 --> 01:12:07,244
 The place where they were born? 

716
01:12:10,998 --> 01:12:15,210
 Io ce la stave putting all 
 by not having to live as a 
 Barbona prostitute or worse 

717
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:21,884
 What if .. and if I had worked more? 

718
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:28,223
 Now I was so close to the skin of the world 
 that I could touch 

719
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:41,361
 It will be hard to get here, 
 but it is not impossible 

720
01:12:49,078 --> 01:12:54,166
 Since there are other scholarships? 
 Yes, perhaps some 

721
01:12:54,166 --> 01:13:01,381
 Write about 1500 words 
 the free market in the world 
 and will win $ 500 

722
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:06,011
 Well, I neservirebbero only 70 
 all years 

723
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:11,183
 Ah, there was an interesting article 
 on the New York Times, 
 ce maybe I still here 

724
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:13,602
 Here it is 

725
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:24,488
 $ 12,000 
 Each year for 4 years! 
 What should I do? 

726
01:13:25,405 --> 01:13:30,536
 Include a short subject that describes 
 what do you think is the most 
 significant academic achievement 

727
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:36,041
 and how did you manage to overcome 
 the pitfalls and obstacles 

728
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:39,127
 I do a copy? 

729
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:44,299
 I want to stand beside the people 
 and not on the sidewalk for this 
 feel lower than their 

730
01:13:44,299 --> 01:13:53,475
 I'd like to go to Harvard, 
 have a good education 
 e able to read all the books better 

731
01:13:53,475 --> 01:13:57,104
 Then I think: 
 and if I were crazy? 

732
01:13:57,104 --> 01:14:01,775
 If you work every crumb 
 my potential to succeed? 

733
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:07,990
 I have to do, 
 I have no choice 

734
01:14:11,201 --> 01:14:15,247
 Are late? 
 No, it's me in advance 

735
01:14:15,247 --> 01:14:21,044
 I made you coffee 
 sweetener, right? 
 Right! 

736
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:29,386
 Thanks 

737
01:14:29,386 --> 01:14:32,681
 Can I have a stamp for this? 

738
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:35,976
 E 'for a scholarship 
 New York Times! 
 Not yet you have sent? 

739
01:14:35,976 --> 01:14:39,271
 When the term expires? 
 Tomorrow 

740
01:14:39,271 --> 01:14:42,899
 Io te l'ho on 4 months ago, Liz! 
 What do you expect? 

741
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:46,778
 To arrive at today, 
 and then to take 18 years 

742
01:14:46,778 --> 01:14:47,779
 E 'il tuo compleanno? 

743
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:52,868
 Happy birthday! 

744
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:55,412
 I do not believe there was 
 an age limit 

745
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:59,583
 I know, thanks 

746
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:05,881
 Now I could tell the truth, 
 that I was a homeless 
 and no one could come and take me away 

747
01:15:23,231 --> 01:15:25,776
 Lisa 

748
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:29,655
 Liz! 

749
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:30,656
 Yes 

750
01:15:30,823 --> 01:15:34,201
 What are you doing here? 

751
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:40,916
 Will I be interviewed 
 I am a finalist for a scholarship 
 New York Times 

752
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:45,712
 But, here I am ... 
 I have nothing to put me 

753
01:15:45,712 --> 01:15:47,089
 Would you like my clothes? 

754
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:53,011
 Well, nothing showy, just 
 ecco ... something to put 
 on this 

755
01:16:04,064 --> 01:16:05,899
 Thank you 

756
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:12,364
 Once Mom 
 revenge my clothes ... 
 I could not go to school 

757
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:15,451
 I remember 

758
01:16:15,451 --> 01:16:19,705
 How cried, 
 so I liked going to school 

759
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:24,459
 But there you've never gone 

760
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:27,963
 why give you a scholarship? 

761
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:33,510
 Why are homeless 
 I am going very well at school 

762
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:37,973
 You are not a homeless, Liz, 
 you could live here 

763
01:16:39,767 --> 01:16:44,771
 I could not, 
 and you know ... 

764
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:46,898
 Grandfather's fault, eh? 

765
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:55,032
 I'm becoming blind 

766
01:16:56,992 --> 01:16:59,286
 as the mother 

767
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:04,333
 and I have so much fear 

768
01:17:31,944 --> 01:17:33,153
 Liz! 

769
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:37,116
 Liz, I was thrown out by 
 with all my stuff 

770
01:17:37,116 --> 01:17:38,742
 They can not if you have not 
 yet 18 years 

771
01:17:38,742 --> 01:17:43,330
 Were either Brooklin, 
 I do not want to go to Brooklin! 
 You must help me! 

772
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:44,540
 I have an interview 

773
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,875
 No! Liz! 
 I gotta go! 

774
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:48,919
 You can not leave 
 your friend 

775
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:51,421
 Chris! 

776
01:17:51,421 --> 01:17:55,259
 Lasiami do this interview, 
 and then you can come to school with me 

777
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:58,595
 I do not care! 
 Not center anything with this place, 
 and even you 

778
01:17:58,595 --> 01:18:01,181
 Yes. 
 I was 

779
01:18:01,181 --> 01:18:04,268
 Do you believe that people like us 
 can come to Harvard? 

780
01:18:44,308 --> 01:18:52,024
 The world turns, 
 and you are not a dot, 
 everything goes on without you 

781
01:18:52,024 --> 01:18:55,986
 situations do not favor 
 what you want 

782
01:18:55,986 --> 01:19:01,366
 The needs of others and their 
 emergencies will always be 
 your strongest 

783
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:05,579
 I believe that people become frustrated 
 by the harshness of life 

784
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:11,293
 So spend time immersed 
 in those frustrations they 
 call anger 

785
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:16,006
 So continue to keep 
 eyes closed 
 situations as a whole 

786
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:21,804
 and all those little things 
 who contributed 
 to make it as 

787
01:19:24,515 --> 01:19:28,602
 Since my parents small 
 I have never given much right, 
 and this has allowed me 

788
01:19:28,602 --> 01:19:34,775
 to realize that 
 the little things that one day 
 would be my person 

789
01:19:34,775 --> 01:19:41,323
 For this I have never asked 
 why things went 
 in one way or another 

790
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:43,909
 I understand .. 

791
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:48,831
 You can not say that I was happy, 
 in fact this made me very sad, 

792
01:19:48,831 --> 01:19:50,541
 but I was aware 

793
01:19:52,209 --> 01:19:55,295
 but accept the 

794
01:19:55,295 --> 01:20:01,051
 because basically I have always known 
 that day 
 ce l'avrei fatta 

795
01:20:01,593 --> 01:20:04,930
 Is there anything else you want to tell us? 

796
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:09,143
 I loved my mother, 

797
01:20:09,143 --> 01:20:11,228
 most of my life 

798
01:20:11,228 --> 01:20:16,066
 She was a drugged, 
 was un'alcolista 

799
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:20,070
 had become almost blind 
 and was also schizophrenic 

800
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:23,282
 But .. 

801
01:20:23,282 --> 01:20:28,328
 I never forget 
 that .. I loved you 

802
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:34,418
 even if you did, 

803
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,211
 continuously, 

804
01:20:38,463 --> 01:20:40,465
 continuously, 

805
01:20:42,134 --> 01:20:44,845
 continuously ... 

806
01:20:51,935 --> 01:20:56,356
 This scholarship 
 for me is very important 

807
01:20:56,356 --> 01:21:01,612
 because I would not 
 go to college without it 

808
01:21:48,492 --> 01:21:52,788
 Had an average of 
 95 out of 150 across the winning class 

809
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:55,791
 He obtained and completed 
 5 years in excess of 2 

810
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:58,377
 and there is successful while 
 a homeless 

811
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:02,005
 Having lost his mother early 
 and with the father toxic employee 

812
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:04,633
 but it is more just that I talk you 

813
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:09,096
 then you present the winner 
 the sixth edition of 
 the scholarship of the New York Times 

814
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:10,723
 Liz Murray 

815
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:22,651
 Now everything has changed, 

816
01:22:22,651 --> 01:22:25,654
 my life will never be the same e.. 

817
01:22:25,654 --> 01:22:32,077
 and I do not know what else to say except thanks 
 thank you very much 

818
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:36,498
 Liz! 
 Liz, how did you succeed? 

819
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:41,378
 How could I not do it .. 
 my parents showed me 
 the alternative 

820
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:43,380
 Do not try displeasure 
 for your child? 

821
01:22:43,547 --> 01:22:44,631
 Displeasure? 

822
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:48,719
 Sleeping in the subway, 
 gather food from bins 
 garbage 

823
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:52,556
 Well no, 
 that was always 
 my life 

824
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:58,979
 I think .. I think I have been lucky 
 because they are deprived 
 any sense of security 

825
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:02,733
 and was this a spur 
 and force them to look ahead 

826
01:23:02,733 --> 01:23:06,403
 I had to do it, 
 there was no alternative 

827
01:23:06,403 --> 01:23:09,323
 so I arrived at the point where 
 I thought: OK, 

828
01:23:09,323 --> 01:23:15,704
 working hard, I give you to do 
 the straits of forces 
 e.. we see 

829
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:18,666
 Now I am about to go 
 to college, e. .. 

830
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:22,753
 and the New York Times 
 if they bear the costs 

831
01:23:25,505 --> 01:23:33,430
 So you were lucky ... but 
 there is something that changes 
 if I could do it? 

832
01:23:33,806 --> 01:23:35,599
 Yes 

833
01:23:38,435 --> 01:23:40,896
 back 

834
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:42,397
 ever 

835
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:48,195
 while to get my family 

836
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:55,577
 Dento are still at college, 

837
01:23:55,577 --> 01:23:57,454
 I found a job at the New York Times, 

838
01:23:57,663 --> 01:24:00,249
 I found an apartment 

839
01:24:00,249 --> 01:24:03,293
 no longer have to pull back their lives 

840
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:07,089
 no longer have to pull back their lives 

841
01:24:07,881 --> 01:24:09,716
 but I do ... 

842
01:24:11,343 --> 01:24:14,930
 All those I know, 
 what I did 

843
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:19,643
 fragments splashing away, 
 I forget the little things 

844
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:25,732
 but it's so hard to pull ahead 

845
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:28,569
 alone 

846
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:32,531
 that's why I told you so, 

847
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:34,700
 Why do I mention 
 my story 

848
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:40,539
 and now put down the burden, 
 put ashore 

849
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:45,085
 and I will go ahead 

850
01:24:48,922 --> 01:24:50,883
 Ciao, Mom
