STAKE LAND (2010)

2
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,526
<i>Call me Martin.</i>

3
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,127
<i>I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.</i>

4
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,934
<i>Things a boy shouldn't see.</i>

5
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,805
<i>But... I'm not a normal
boy anymore.</i>

6
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,776
<i>And it ain't a normal world.</i>

7
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,108
<i>Get used to it.</i>

8
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,443
<i>That's what Mister tells me.</i>

9
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,211
<i>We live by his rules
or we die.</i>

10
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,649
<i>Or worse.</i>

11
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,175
<i>We die and we come back.</i>

12
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,455
<i>But let's begin at the beginning.</i>

13
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,588
<i>I was like any other kid,
I had a family.</i>

14
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,961
<i>I went to school,</i>

15
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,057
<i>I didn't believe in the boogey man.</i>

16
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,597
<i>But then the world
woke up to a nightmare.</i>

17
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,972
<i>...Stay in your homes
and not to travel by night.</i>

18
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,608
<i>Route 22...</i>

19
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,175
Maybe we should wait.

20
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,423
We'll take the back roads,
you'll be safer there.

21
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,691
No. Martin, come back!

22
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,789
Hey!

23
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,094
Martin!

24
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,630
Cooper!

25
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,298
Cooper!

26
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,031
Cooper...

27
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:25,703
Cooper...

28
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,070
Cooper!

29
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,764
Martin, run!

30
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,100
Mom!

31
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,508
Shh! Shh!

32
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,174
You wanna live boy,
you listen to me.

33
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,807
You scream,
I'll break your neck.

34
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,282
They're dead!

35
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,478
There's nothing to be done
about it but kill that thing.

36
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,620
Can you shoot?

37
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,556
You shoot me
I'll fuckin' kill you!

38
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,951
<i>...A 24 hour hotline

00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,681

47

Get a fuckin' hammer!

48
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,654
I only got two hands, boy.
Do it!

49
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,869
Save him...

50
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,194
One day you'll learn
not to dream at all.

51
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,634
Get your shit.

52
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,732
Welcome to Stake Land, kid.

53
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,989
<i>Months passed
in a blur of days and nights.</i>

54
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,628
<i>We traveled east and west,
but always north.</i>

55
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,695
<i>Away from death.</i>

56
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,399
<i>We avoided the cities.</i>

57
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,668
<i>Mister said they were the worst,</i>

58
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,972
<i>hit the hardest in the beginning.</i>

59
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,705
<i>As people flocked together
for safety,</i>

60
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,406
<i>the plague marched through
their locked gates</i>

61
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,813
<i>and they became death traps.</i>

62
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,911
<i>When Washington fell, it was over
for America as we knew her.</i>

63
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,390
<i>As government blew away,
our great leaders ran for it.</i>

64
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,415
<i>And hope was abandoned.</i>

65
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,920
<i>We were on our own now.</i>

66
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,160
<i>Me and Mister.</i>

67
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,634
<i>Traveling through a ruined land.</i>

68
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,933
<i>Pockets of civilization survived.</i>

69
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,099
<i>Towns locked down behind fences</i>

70
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,007
<i>and guns holding the night away.</i>

71
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,376
<i>Cults spread like wildfire
across the southern states.</i>

72
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,746
<i>Waitin' for the messiah,
but he never came.</i>

73
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,280
<i>Death came instead.</i>

74
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,554
<i>And it came with teeth.</i>

75
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,345
Dumb fuck got himself trapped.

76
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,784
Burnt up in the sun.

77
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,160
Berserker.

78
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,288
It's the oldest of the vamps.

79
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,060
Can't stake 'em in the chest.

80
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,657
Got a breast bone like iron.

81
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,532
Gotta get 'em in the
base of the skull.

82
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,127
Vamps...

83
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,867
function from the reptile brain.

84
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,434
It's like pullin' the
plug on a computer.

85
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,077
<i>We were all orphans.</i>

86
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,488
<i>Just lookin' for something
to hold on to.</i>

87
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,014
<i>He's a Mister.</i>

88
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,829
<i>Maybe that's why
he keeps me with him.</i>

89
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:39,764
What's that?

90
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,670
Garlic oil.

91
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,106
Does that really work?

92
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,541
Don't hurt.

93
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,643
One strike boy.

94
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,206
Make it true.

95
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,438
Where you boys comin' from?

96
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,468
South.

97
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,775
Get outta the car.

98
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,854
Did you get any?

99
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,741
They alright boys, let 'em roll.

100
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,186
<i>Another town,
another lockdown.</i>

101
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,721
<i>People just tryin' to go on.</i>

102
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,294
<i>Hopin' they'd wake up
and it would all be a bad dream.</i>

103
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,635
<i>They could go back to their lives,</i>

104
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,197
<i>families and careers.</i>

105
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,107
He needs more fresh food.

106
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,086
And some vitamins,
if you can find them.

107
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,247
Where's his folks?

108
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,756
Dead.

109
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,883
He'd be better of here.

110
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,658
With people.

111
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,358
Other children.

112
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,827
What do I owe you?

113
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,736
I could use all of them.

114
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,404
Good.

115
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,316
Hey.

116
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,414
Got any liquor in this town?

117
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,890
Jake's.

118
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,723
Homemade, mostly.

119
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,251
We got some tap beer.

120
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,094
Little sour,
but it won’t kill ya.

121
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,661
Boy needs a haircut.

122
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,482
Sheriff said take whatever you need.

123
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,892
It's on me.

124
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,427
Have you been through Haggerstown?

125
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,024
I had family there.

126
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,059
Vamped out,
everything south of here.

127
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,268
Rea?

128
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,678
He really kills 'em, huh?

129
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,347
You gotta get 'em in the heart.

130
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,441
Pierce the breast plate.

131
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:49,614
Guns hurt 'em but unless you
sever the spine they keep comin'.

132
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,213
You got any gum?

133
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,688
Yes.

134
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,989
Cool.

135
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,398
Ah, just...

136
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,393
So who are you?

137
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,166
His helper.

138
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,106
Where are you, uhh... where are
you guys headin'?

139
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,039
North.

140
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,975
Uh, Mister says less population,
less bloodsuckers.

141
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:12,670
Wait, wait, wait...

142
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,303
Not New Eden right?

143
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,739
We had a fella,
he came through here.

144
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,777
He said there's nothing there,
there's no food at all.

145
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,018
He said it's not the Vamps
ya need to worry about...

146
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,650
it's the cannibals.

147
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,058
Thanks.

148
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,630
<i></i>

149
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,466
<i>Sometimes I think I could
stay in a place like this.</i>

150
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,068
<i>Make friends,
live in the daylight.</i>

151
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,475
<i>Just be a kid.</i>

152
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,846
<i>But the truth is
I don't feel safe around people.</i>

153
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,182
<i>They can think what they want
but New Eden was real.</i>

154
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,552
<i>It was the answer to all of this
and we were gonna find it.</i>

155
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,387
<i>Fight our way north,
make the open territories.</i>

156
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,326
<i>Like Mister says.</i>

157
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,761
<i>'Live free or die tryin'.</i>

158
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,389
<i>Fuck the cannibals.</i>

159
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,137
What's her name?

160
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,277
I didn't ask.

161
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,654
<i>Why did this happen?</i>

162
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,288
<i>How can God let this happen?</i>

163
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,264
<i>How can this be his love...</i>

164
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,333
Oh... oh, God!

165
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,731
Oh... oh, God!

166
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:27,169
It's okay, lady.

167
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,543
- No! No!
- Shh. Shh.

168
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,808
It's okay!

169
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,941
- No! No!
- It's alright!

170
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,310
No!

171
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,752
It's okay. It's okay.

172
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,915
it's okay, it's okay.

173
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,807
<i>Mister,</i>

174
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,377
<i>where'd all that
hate come from?</i>

175
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,448
<i>I never asked.</i>

176
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,024
Those men that...

177
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,631
They said they were Christians.

178
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,071
We don't do history.

179
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,041
Doesn't do anybody any good.

180
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,036
Grab them traps, boy.

181
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,198
Give me a finger.

182
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,085
Time to go fishin'.

183
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,829
Get the long pole.

184
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,402
Sister Agitha.

185
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,634
We thought she was dead.

186
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:17,937
She is.

187
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,009
What are you gonna do?

188
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,706
I'm gonna kill that thing.

189
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:26,548
Go with God.

190
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,882
Lock the door.

191
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,519
Newbie.
Shouldn't be too hard.

192
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,333
Too fat, I can't break the spine.

193
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,574
You missed the heart ya,
dumb shit.

194
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,869
Fuckin' vamps!

195
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:36,910
Stop it!

196
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,839
<i>Mister dug a grave.</i>

197
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,479
<i>I think he felt bad
for the sister.</i>

198
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,614
<i>He did pull the fangs out, but...</i>

199
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,181
<i>he waited till she went
to pick the flowers.</i>

200
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,134
How many of those things
have you killed?

201
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,604
Not enough.

202
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,044
And people?

203
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,444
Those two men?

204
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,177
In my book,
rapists got no place to live.

205
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,249
It's not ours to judge.

206
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,185
Then don't.

207
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,882
Next lockdown,
we drop you off.

208
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,413
You go save some souls.

209
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,790
And what about him?

210
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,260
He's just a boy.

211
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,455
Yeah.

212
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,929
A live one.

213
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,882
<i>But we never dropped her off.</i>

214
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,721
<i>Where was she gonna go?</i>

215
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,567
<i>Satan's soldiers
march the night,</i>

216
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,969
<i>but God has not abandoned us.</i>

217
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,463
<i>Those who believe in him
shall never fall.</i>

218
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,967
<i>Jesus and the angels are
coming and judgment is upon us</i>

219
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:18,540
<i>and the Christian Army of Aryans
are here to fight for you.</i>

220
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:22,485
<i>And have created a safe refuge
for the holy among us.</i>

221
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,853
<i>Join us brothers and sisters,</i>

222
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,554
<i>Lafayette Valley welcomes
the righteous and the pure.</i>

223
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:33,325
<i>Together we shall lead
the world back to the light.</i>

224
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,358
<i>And the right,
the America God loves.</i>

225
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,943
<i>In desperate times,
false gods abound.</i>

226
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:53,781
<i>People put their faith in the loudest
preacher and hope they're right.</i>

227
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,459
<i>But sometimes they're wrong.</i>

228
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,123
<i>Dead wrong.</i>

229
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:26,767
My name is Jebedia Loven.

230
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,302
And you killed two of my men.

231
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:32,441
In cold blood.

232
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,248
Staked one in the back.

233
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,354
He was my son.

234
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,550
My own boy.

235
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,563
He was only sixteen.

236
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,603
He cried for his mother for
three hours before he died.

237
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,672
God rest his soul.

238
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,684
Now you a fine lookin'
young buck.

239
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,386
That's your father?

240
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,028
My father's dead.

241
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,824
Oh, don't you worry.

242
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,168
We'll get you some religion.

243
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,735
Bring you to God
and the right way.

244
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,878
Good stock.

245
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,081
You'll still serve.

246
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:48,683
As for you, Mister.

247
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,490
Oh, yeah.

248
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,496
We know who you are.

249
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,725
You kill them that come back,

250
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,893
them that serve us,

251
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,302
them that God brought down
to do his work.

252
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:04,775
Leavin' us to purify
the blood of our fathers.

253
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,572
And when that day comes,

254
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,704
he will bring them back

255
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,513
in peace and purity
will reign on the earth.

256
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,211
Forever!

257
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,219
Amen!

258
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,845
Amen!

259
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:23,057
What do you have to say
for yourself, sinner?

260
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,395
Fuck you and fuck your God.

261
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,974
Well...

262
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,707
You can tell him that yourself.

263
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,544
You're about to meet him.

264
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,279
Welcome to the Valley of Them.

265
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,746
Last stop for the weak of faith.

266
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,215
Get him out here!

267
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,826
Ow!

268
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,641
Ah, look at them.

269
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,209
The children of salvation.

270
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,517
They come at my calling.

271
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,420
They feed on the unfaithful.

272
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,585
Shh.

273
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,325
They say hell is cold,

274
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,858
Hunter.

275
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,463
Don't let that flame burn out.

276
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,332
Get back, you bloodsuckers.

277
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,251
How's your head?

278
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,845
Mister.

279
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,617
I'm sorry.

280
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,605
Go down to the creek,
fill 'em up.

281
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,268
Bring 'em back.

282
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:30,905
Wait.

283
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,135
Hey, boy.

284
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,672
You can run if you want to.

285
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,542
Ain't nothing out there
but sundown and them.

286
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,877
You won't get far.

287
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,489
<i>Mister taught me
how to read the stars.</i>

288
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,227
<i>I could make my way
back to the car,</i>

289
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,234
<i>get the weapons,</i>

290
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,735
<i>find them robe-wearin' crazies</i>

291
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,466
<i>and send them back to that God
they kept talking about.</i>

292
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,250
<i>I had to keep movin'.</i>

293
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,548
<i>Had to make the car
before night came.</i>

294
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,483
<i>Mister was gone.</i>

295
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,753
<i>And out here alone
I didn't stand a chance.</i>

296
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,424
Shh.

297
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,791
How many of them
things out there?

298
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,169
One.

299
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,338
But she's really pissed off.

300
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,706
Make some noise.

301
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,612
<i>Hey! In here!</i>

302
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,012
<i>Hey!</i>

303
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,675
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

304
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,576
<i>Come and get me!</i>

305
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,315
<i>Yeah, that's right, come on!</i>

306
00:35:58,556 --> 00:35:59,955
<i>I'm in here!</i>

307
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,356
<i>Hey, I'm in here!</i>

308
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,827
<i>Heeeey!</i>

309
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,831
Come on, baby,
come on, baby.

310
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,914
Martin.

311
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,079
I hate fuckin' vampires.

312
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,960
<i>The Brotherhood needs
your eyes, followers.</i>

313
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,367
<i>There are evildoers among us.</i>

314
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,998
<i>This enemy of America
walks with faith.</i>

315
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,840
<i>His name is Mister and he
is traveling with a young boy.</i>

316
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,640
<i>They are armed and dangerous.</i>

317
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,168
What happened?

318
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,738
<i>They were last seen heading
north to Lafayetteville.</i>

319
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:35,582
<i>If spotted,
dispatch of them immediately.</i>

320
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,350
<i>These actions will not
go unrewarded.</i>

321
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,506
We're gonna leave in the morning.

322
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:01,533
We'll have to take a back road.

323
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,547
Brotherhood got the
rest locked down.

324
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,010
Let it go, boy.

325
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,989
Get over there.

326
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,225
You're gonna be crispy
in the mornin'.

327
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,232
Come on, Willy!

328
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,733
Give him a hand!

329
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:33,967
Whoa!

330
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,924
What have ya got for trade?

331
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,482
Antibiotics.

332
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,926
Some weed.

333
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:53,928
And these.

334
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,703
Goddamn.

335
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,302
That's a big one.

336
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,806
What about the boy?

337
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,110
I ain't got no soda pop.

338
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,673
Give him another glass.

339
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,622
You fellas look like
you've seen some trouble.

340
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,852
A little.

341
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:22,722
Vamps?

342
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,284
Holy rollers.

343
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,994
Yeah, well, we don't tolerate
religion or politics in here.

344
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,763
Where's the next lockdown?

345
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,269
Just over the mountains.

346
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,965
Past Lafayette Valley.

347
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,165
But that's Brotherhood territory.

348
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,038
They don't take too kindly
to strangers.

349
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:45,248
<i># ...I'll shiver the whole night through</i>

350
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:49,184
<i># Her husband,
was a hardworking man</i>

351
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,712
<i># Just about a mile from here</i>

352
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:53,689
Thanks.

353
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,488
Been talk there was a hunter about.

354
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,722
Thought you was all dead by now.

355
00:39:58,763 --> 00:39:59,923
Not yet.

356
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:05,625
<i># ...My girl, my girl, don't lie to me</i>

360
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,846
Thank you.

361
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,486
We got one more for ya.

362
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:29,857
Ready, boys?

363
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:10,697
<i># Maria please don't leave

<i># There's nowhere I can go</i>

366
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,606
<i># My up's turned down</i>

367
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:27,276
<i># My luck's spun round and left me</i>

368
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,148
<i># No I didn't see it...</i>

369
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,598
<i>Her name was Belle.</i>

370
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:23,334
<i>Her story was no different
from anyone else's.</i>

371
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,306
<i>Home gone.</i>

372
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,070
<i>Family gone.</i>

373
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,011
<i>Oh, and she was pregnant.</i>

374
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,072
<i>But I guess life goes on.</i>

375
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,584
<i>She wanted to get to New Eden
before the baby came.</i>

376
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:48,636
Hi.

377
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,501
Scamp!
In the attic!

378
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:48,758
Do it.

379
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,598
Stake the bitch.

380
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:55,462
Stake the bitch!

381
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,336
I let her go and
she'll eat your ass!

382
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,898
<i>A Scamp.</i>

383
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:02,070
<i>That's what Mister
called the kid vamps.</i>

384
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:03,670
<i>She was just a kid.</i>

385
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:08,951
<i>And if not for Mister,
I might have become like that.</i>

386
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,368
Out of the fuckin' car!

387
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,105
Out of the fuckin' car!

388
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:42,984
Get your hands on your head.

389
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,364
That's a nice shot, kid.

390
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,084
Fuck.

391
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,417
Hey, hey.

392
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,618
What the hell
happened to you, man?

393
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,025
Fuckin' Brotherhood
dumped me out of a truck.

394
00:49:58,061 --> 00:49:59,756
For vamp bait.

395
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,286
This is their territory.

396
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,821
Let's get the fuck out of here.

397
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,699
I was in the Marines.

398
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,275
Got called back from the war
when it started.

399
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,741
What happened with the war?

400
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,048
No one left to fight it.

401
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:24,951
The Middle East is gone.

402
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,148
Vamp land.

403
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,384
How did you end up here?

404
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:32,361
We were deployed to
see to the evacuation to Canada.

405
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:33,863
Keep the peace.

406
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,595
But we couldn't contain it.

407
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:42,433
Most of their troops left,
tryin' to make it home to their families.

408
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,105
I guess you heard
the President's dead.

409
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:50,142
Which asshole's president now?

410
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,841
Beats me.

411
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,281
Way I see it,

412
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:56,308
muthafuckas booked and left us
with our dick in our hands.

413
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:31,413
<i>Baby don't you cry.</i>

414
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,753
<i>Papa's gonna make sure don't...</i>

415
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:36,554
Please help!

416
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,560
No!

417
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,891
Please!

418
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,521
I need a doctor.

419
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:41,758
The baby's coming.

420
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,322
Where the hell
did you come from, girl?

421
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:47,234
I'm traveling with three men,
but they can't help me.

422
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,929
Where are they?

423
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,165
Right behind you.

424
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:52,798
You should have been an actress.

425
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:54,803
What are they doing?

426
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,439
They've been takin' out the
lockdown towns with captured vamps.

427
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,416
They crash the trucks into roadblocks
and let the vamps do their thing.

428
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,214
They even crached a few planes loaded up
with vamps into cities at the beginnin'.

429
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:04,982
That's what took down Washington.

430
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,319
Check the other one.

431
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:44,593
Howdy, Clem.

432
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:53,733
This your boy, Clem?

433
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:57,633
Shit!

434
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:14,150
Where's the woman?

435
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,087
Bitch run off.

436
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,591
We was just tryin'
to protect her.

437
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,539
Run!

438
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:20,480
<i>Vamps could smell blood
from miles off.</i>

439
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,286
<i>Mister knew it.</i>

440
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,384
<i>And so did Jebedia Loven.</i>

441
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,759
<i>I could tell by
the look in his eye.</i>

442
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:02,391
<i>We were movin' north.</i>

443
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:03,797
<i>Away from The Brotherhood,</i>

444
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,664
<i>skirting the Adirondacks</i>

445
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,863
<i>Less towns, less people.</i>

446
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,705
<i>Hadn't seen any vamps yet.</i>

447
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:20,716
<i>Mister said it was too cold for
them up here in the mountains.</i>

448
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,217
<i>They were cold-blooded.</i>

449
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,379
<i>Like reptiles.</i>

450
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,480
<i>When we hit the lowlands,
they'd be back.</i>

451
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:40,502
<i>If you are
receiving this signal,</i>

452
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,062
<i>you are approaching
the Strivington border.</i>

453
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:46,507
<i>Under protection of the
United States volunteer militia.</i>

454
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:47,840
<i>All those seeking asylum</i>

455
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:50,539
<i>will be processed and
dealt with accordingly.</i>

456
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,571
<i>Weapons will be confiscated...</i>

457
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,354
You get 'em back when you leave.

458
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:06,384
Mm-hmm.

459
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,293
Where you comin' from?

460
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,126
South.

461
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,654
Lafayetteville.

462
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,428
Any trouble with The Brotherhood?

463
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,163
Nothin' we couldn't handle.

464
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:52,306
<i>They renamed
their town Strivington.</i>

465
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,902
<i>Said it all.</i>

466
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,242
<i>It gave me hope for people.</i>

467
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,373
<i>It gave me hope for New Eden.</i>

468
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:03,079
<i>Sometimes hope is all ya got.</i>

469
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,681
<i>And it was over, like that.</i>

470
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:54,849
<i>All that goodness.</i>

471
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:58,657
<i>Shattered by some Christian crazies
droppin' vamps from the sky.</i>

472
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,788
We're gonna stay
right here till morning.

473
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,297
Fine by me.

474
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:15,306
How you doin', mama?

475
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,228
She's gone.

476
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,135
Tough old lady.

477
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,541
Climbed those stairs
and didn't say a word.

478
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:38,693
Damn Brotherhood shit-kickers.

479
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,195
Ten dead.

480
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:43,590
We've got things
under control now.

481
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:45,794
We'll have this place
up and runnin' in no time.

482
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,204
Sure you won't
stick around for a while?

483
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:51,672
We could use
a couple good men.

484
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,504
No.

485
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,032
We're headin' north.

486
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:58,711
Stick to the back roads.

487
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,739
They're the only way outta here.

488
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:02,944
Brotherhood owns the rest.

489
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:04,885
Good luck to you.

490
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,115
Thanks.

491
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:52,933
<i>We'd come far.</i>

492
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,502
<i>We didn't know
what was waitin' for us.</i>

493
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,505
<i>But anything had to be
better than what we left behind.</i>

494
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,580
<i>At least I kept
telling myself that.</i>

495
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:12,481
<i>But when I close my eyes,</i>

496
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,456
<i>I kept seein' that
little girl's dead legs</i>

497
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,754
<i>stickin' out from under that tarp.</i>

498
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:36,404
Ah, fuck.

499
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,141
What is it?

500
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:43,982
Fuckin' radiator.

501
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,248
Can you fix it?

502
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:46,653
Not this time.

503
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,884
She's dead.

504
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:51,223
Everybody grab your shit.

505
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:55,747
<i>One week in the woods and
we were becoming different people.</i>

506
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,884
<i>Small talk stopped.</i>

507
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:00,828
<i>We worked as a pack,
each to his task.</i>

508
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:09,271
<i>It was cold here in the hot passes,
but we hadn't seen any vamps.</i>

509
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:12,934
<i>The forest cast
a kind of magic over us.</i>

510
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,966
<i>Away from people.</i>

511
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:19,637
<i>I stopped thinking
about the past.</i>

512
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:21,912
<i>And about my family.</i>

513
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,885
<i>I had found a new one.</i>

514
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,394
You think we'll make it?

515
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,432
I'm just worried about the girl.

516
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,369
She's slowin' us down.

517
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:32,542
There's no wind.

518
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:35,438
Berserkers.

519
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,011
Run!

520
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,461
Come on!
We gotta run now, let’s go.

521
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:01,697
Move!

522
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:06,304
She's comin'!

523
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:13,440
No, no, no!
What are you doin'?!

524
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,074
What are you doin'?!
We gotta go!

525
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:17,383
Keep movin'!

526
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:20,282
- Please, Please. We gotta move.
- I need one second!

527
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,622
Sister?

528
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,722
I got you, I got you.
Just a little bit further.

529
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:28,627
Come on, keep moving.

530
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,833
She's comin'!

531
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:39,905
Keep going.

532
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:40,931
Come on, we gotta go.

533
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:42,170
We gotta go faster.

534
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,055
Come on, you fuckers.

535
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,796
The Lord is my strength.

536
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,995
My Lord is my...

537
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:19,713
Father,

538
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,483
forgive me.

539
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,978
Martin, let's go.

540
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:06,094
I don't think she's coming, Martin.

541
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:13,023
Come on.

542
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:50,925
<i>We've been travelin' for days
now and hadn't seen a soul.</i>

543
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:54,231
<i>It was like people
had just disappeared.</i>

544
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,533
<i>But Mister wasn't
takin' any chances.</i>

545
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,360
What's wrong?

546
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,530
Nothing.

547
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:05,437
I'm just getting old and scary.

548
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:21,748
You okay?

549
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,087
Oh, yeah...

550
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,688
Baby just kicked, I'm okay.

551
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:29,219
Here, give me your hand.

552
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:30,458
- Wanna feel?
- Yeah.

553
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,398
Oh, wow.

554
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:36,637
Let me check that out.

555
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:37,900
Here, give me your hand, wait.

556
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:41,038
That kid's got a strong kick.

557
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,101
She's like, "Let me out,
I wanna meet everybody."

558
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:26,181
Wake up.

559
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,189
Get your boots on
and your guns ready.

560
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:30,885
Willie's missin'.

561
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:27,978
Something's dead.

562
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:29,313
It's fresh.

563
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,298
Jesus! Fuck...

564
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,675
Oh, fuck.

565
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:58,741
Oh, fuck.

566
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:01,247
Fuck.

567
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:10,081
Oh, my God...

568
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:15,287
Come on. Come on.

569
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,797
- Come on. We have to go.
- I can't.

570
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:17,890
Come on.

571
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:24,164
From now on you keep your
weapons close and ready.

572
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:25,798
That thing took Willie
away to kill him.

573
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:28,105
He got around our traps.

574
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,610
What are you saying?

575
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,738
This one uses its brain.

576
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,111
I've seen a lot of mutant vamps

577
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,207
but I ain't never seen
a thinker before.

578
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:26,599
<i>We were entering the lowlands.</i>

579
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:28,660
<i>New Eden was just beyond
the mountains.</i>

580
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,171
<i>We were getting close.</i>

581
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:33,003
<i>But so far
no sign of anything...</i>

582
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,440
<i>Alive anyway.</i>

583
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:47,583
- You okay, girl?
- I...

584
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,281
I have cramps.

585
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:55,186
My back hurts really bad.

586
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,026
I just...

587
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:58,328
I just need to sit for a minute.

588
01:18:58,366 --> 01:18:59,663
I'm sorry.

589
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:01,635
- We gotta keep movin'.
- I can't.

590
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:02,830
It's okay.

591
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:07,039
I got you.

592
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,033
You okay?

593
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:17,279
My daddy used to carry me
like this when I was little.

594
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:18,980
I'm not your daddy.

595
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:23,847
You ain't such a hard ass,
you know.

596
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:52,084
Let her sleep.

597
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,519
She needs it.

598
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:56,353
At daylight were gonna put some
distance between us and this place.

599
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,722
What are we gonna do
when the baby comes?

600
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:55,810
Oh, fuck.

601
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,011
Fuck.

602
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:11,363
This way. It's close.

603
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:28,708
That's her.

604
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:30,978
That's her.

605
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,309
Wait.

606
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,586
It's leadin' us, boy.

607
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:42,588
Tough shit.

608
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:41,620
Drink up, boy.

609
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:54,262
I am a vengeful god.

610
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:55,564
Eye for eye.

611
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:56,900
Tooth for tooth.

612
01:22:56,938 --> 01:22:58,963
Son for son.

613
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:03,767
This is between me and you,
you bloodsuckin' son-of-a-bitch.

614
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:25,326
When you left me for them,
I prayed.

615
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:29,098
I prayed and God listened.

616
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:33,330
So when they came for me,

617
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:35,843
the hungry ones,

618
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:39,938
I gave my blood, willingly, hunter.

619
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:47,819
Thank you.

620
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:54,192
I am your God now.

621
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:57,023
Yah.

622
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,394
Nice try, child.

623
01:24:04,606 --> 01:24:05,937
Try this, you fucker.

624
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:52,642
'Bout time you learn how to drive.

625
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:57,545
<i>Almost there.</i>

626
01:25:58,753 --> 01:25:59,981
<i>Almost.</i>

627
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:02,719
<i>'Almost' is a big word.</i>

628
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,331
Fuck.

629
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:17,120
Hold it right there!

630
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:21,893
Don't move.

631
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,172
Thank you.

632
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:36,246
You boys look like hell.

633
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:37,251
Shit happens.

634
01:27:37,285 --> 01:27:39,048
Yeah, sure does.

635
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,748
But like my mom used to say,

636
01:27:40,788 --> 01:27:43,780
"Things are what they are.
Get used to 'em."

637
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:45,258
Smart woman.

638
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:47,318
She owned this place.

639
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:50,354
Last stop before the wilderness.

640
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:53,094
Buried her out back and
I've been on my own ever since.

641
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:55,500
Except for them.

642
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:57,094
It's good shootin'.

643
01:27:57,138 --> 01:27:58,435
Lots of practice.

644
01:27:58,473 --> 01:27:59,838
I'm gonna take a look around.

645
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:10,214
What's your name?

646
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,920
Martin.

647
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,422
I'm Peggy.

648
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,758
It's been a long time
since I seen a boy.

649
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:56,185
Come on.

650
01:28:58,232 --> 01:28:59,824
You gotta wait 'til it's in the lot.

651
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:03,163
What's wrong with it?

652
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:05,365
They're runnin' out of food
so they're...

653
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:06,964
skinnier but meaner.

654
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:10,810
It smells us now.

655
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:18,918
Oh shit.

656
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:21,217
It's Walter again.

657
01:29:21,255 --> 01:29:22,381
I went to high school with him

658
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:24,755
and I haven't been able
to get a clean shot.

659
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:26,020
He was such an asshole.

660
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:29,696
I'll get him.

661
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:31,427
Martin!

662
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:32,899
No, stop!

663
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:34,697
Get in here.
What are you doing?

664
01:29:35,903 --> 01:29:37,063
Martin!
