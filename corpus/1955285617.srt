(helicopter blades chopping)

3
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,999
(dogs barking)

4
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:28,999
 Where the hell 
 is everyone? 

5
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:31,999
 Great, we spend two years 
 planning a party 

6
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:32,999
 and no one shows up. 

7
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:34,999
 There's no 
 question he's here. 

8
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:36,999
 Keep your eyes open. 

9
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:39,999
*

10
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:54,999
What the...

11
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,999
Head shots,
head shots only.

12
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:15,999
Come on !

13
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:20,999
Get off of me !

14
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:22,999
The thing bit me.

15
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:25,999
Target spotted.

16
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:26,999
Move move !

17
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:30,999
*

18
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,999
 I think I see 
 the target. 

19
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:53,999
Clear.

20
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,999
(whimpering)

21
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:00,999
(screaming)

22
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:03,999
Clear.

23
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,999
(gun shooting)

24
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:13,999
Let's bag 'em
and tag 'em

25
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,999
and get
the hell out of here.

26
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:16,999
 (man) 
 For god and for country, 

27
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:19,999
 Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo. 

28
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,999
You're not
lookin' so good.

29
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,999
(coughing)

30
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,999
Bravo,
are you all right ?

31
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:48,999
Bravo, what's going
on, are you okay ?

32
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:50,999
 (man) 
 What's 
 going on back there ? 

33
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:52,999
Stand down, stand down,
soldier !

34
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:53,999
Ahh !

35
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,999
Hold your fire,
hold your fire.

36
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,999
 In 20, going down, 
 in 20, going down. 

37
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,999
(screaming)

38
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:05,999
(man)
Hold on !

39
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:37,999
Thanks for bringing me
out here.

40
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:41,999
Hey, let's go swimming.

41
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:44,999
I am not swimming.

42
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:47,999
Oh come on,
don't be such a baby.

43
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,999
Baby, come on !

44
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:15,999

45
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:17,709

46
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:22,999
Ana ?

47
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:28,999
Ana ?

48
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,999
Ana ?

49
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:59,999
(roaring)

50
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,999

51
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:20,999

*

53
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:40,999
What's up, doc ?

54
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:41,999
What ?

55
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:42,999
What you mean, what's up ?

56
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,999
Nice doc, five minute
mile in full gear.

57
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:46,999
I was being chased.

58
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,999
How many ?

59
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:51,999
To be honest, Captain, I didn't
get an accurate head count,

60
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,999
'cause I was
running for my life.

61
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,999
DC, get some eyes on.

62
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:08,999
Odds aren't terrible.

63
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,999
What does
that mean exactly ?

64
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:12,999
Means you'll have plenty
of chance to use that.

65
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:13,999
Be more specific,
Lieutenant.

66
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:15,999
I'd say four to one,
roughly a hundred meters,

67
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:17,999
closing fast.

68
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,999
That's what
I'm talking about.

69
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,999
Are you serious ?

70
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:22,999
What ?

71
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:23,999
It's hot out.

72
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:24,999
It could be snowing
and you'd be hot.

73
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,999
That is a terrible
pick up line, but, yes,

74
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:27,999
I will go out with you.

75
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:28,999
Eat me, Chippendale.

76
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:30,999
Me and everything
else out here.

77
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:33,542
(laughing)

78
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,999
Juliette 6-4,
Juliette 6-4.

79
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:45,999
This is Juliette 2-5 over.

80
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:49,999
Why aren't there any
Walnuts in Afghanistan ?

81
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:50,999
Ah, hell.

82
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:51,999
Why ?

83
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,999
'Cause there's targets
on every corner.

84
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:55,999
 (man) 
 Go ahead 2-5. 

85
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:56,999
6-4, this is 2-5.

86
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,999
We have twenty Class D
hostiles moving to our position.

87
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,999
Request authority
to engage, over.

88
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:02,999
 Affirmative. 

89
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:04,999
 Predator ETA two minutes. 

90
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:07,999
Roger, ISR, two mikes out.

91
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,999
Look alive, gents.

92
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:10,999
Look alive ?

93
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:11,999
Oh, the irony.

94
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:14,999
On me.

95
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,999
Hoot !

96
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,999
Enjoy your
unlimited virgins, mis amigos !

97
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:42,999
What ?

98
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:43,999
I don't mean you, tomboy.

99
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,999
I hate you Carol !

100
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,999
You're a pain in my ass !

101
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:53,999
Just had to have
the dog, didn't ya ?

102
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:59,999
We good here ?

103
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:03,999
What do you call a guy
with no legs...

104
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:07,999
... and no arms ?

105
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,999
What ?

106
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,999
Matt.

108
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,999
You have fallen
in with the wrong crowd.

109
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:29,999
Your mom warned you about
friends like this, right ?

110
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:31,999
Save some for me !

111
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:37,999
Fighting zombie
insurgents, fine by me.

112
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:41,999
(Doc)
A little help ?

113
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,999
Killing infected
civilians, it makes me sick.

114
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,999
Can't kill something
that's already dead.

115
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:50,999
Even if I get infected,
consider me a goner.

116
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:52,999
And kill the
zombie that took my place.

117
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,999
*

118
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,999
Take it easy,
DC, save some for me.

119
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,999
Do you like that ?
Yeah.

120
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:17,999
Hey, you can't
shoot the tip.

121
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,999
That was totally mine.

122
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,999
*

123
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:22,999
Ah, this sucks.

124
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:26,999
(exploding)

125
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:28,999
Where's Kate ?

126
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:55,999
 (man) 
 1-9-3-7. 

127
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:57,999
 Slew in target 
 cords now. 

128
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,999
 On target 1-5-3-1-zulu. 

129
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,999
We're all right.

130
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:03,999
We don't know the status
of the captain,

131
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,999
God rest his soul.

132
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,999
Permanently, I hope.

133
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,999
Certainly takes the fun
out of things, doesn't it ?

134
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,999
Captain's wearing the comm's
gear and radio.

135
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:16,999
So we're fubar in
that regard.

136
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:19,999
(Joker)
* Swing low sweet chariot

137
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,999
Now is not the time.

138
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,999
We have seventy-two
hours until show time.

139
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:28,999
I say we proceed
as planned.

140
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:31,999
Any bites, scratches,
blood intake, et cetera---

141
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:34,584
(growling)

142
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:37,999
Uh... uh-uh-uh...

143
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,999
(gun shooting)

144
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,999
I guess you only
live once, right ?

145
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:02,999
Or twice.

146
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:07,999
You know we can't
let that happen.

147
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:15,999
Tell Thayden I love him.

148
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:17,999
Rottweiler.

149
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,999
Okay, then.

150
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:36,375
Well, carpe diem...

151
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:38,999
... sempre phi and all
that other crap.

152
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,999
I'm sorry, Herc.

153
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:44,999
Yeah.

154
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:46,999
How much time we got ?

155
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,999
He hit an artery.

156
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,999
Five minutes, tops.

157
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,999
Let's get this
show on the road.

158
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:00,999
Who's gonna do this ?

159
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:01,999
Jeppo ?

160
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:03,999
Sorry, amigo.

161
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,999
You see Chip I'm thinking of a
number between

162
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:07,999
one and a hundred---

163
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:08,999
Sorry, man.

164
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:12,999
I'm only killing the
undead right now, buddy.

165
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,999
Joke ?

166
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,999
Rock, paper, scissors ?

167
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,999
All right...

168
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:22,999
but if I win, you gotta
figure it out yourself.

169
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:25,999
Fair enough.

170
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,999
One, two, three.

171
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,999
Rock beats scissors.

172
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,999
Two out of three.

173
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:40,999
Why does everybody
think that's part of the game ?

174
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:44,999
Come on, two out of three.

175
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:46,999
One, two---

176
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,999
I'll do it.

177
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:54,876
I figured you'd do
the same for me.

178
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:56,999
Thanks.

179
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,999
I'm not gonna watch.

180
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,999
Finish the mission.

181
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,999
Whatever's going
down the brass feels it's big.

182
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:05,999
Find the militia camp,

183
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,999
Stop the broadcast
and send as many of these things

184
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:11,999
as you can back
to hell.

185
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:14,292
Make it count.

186
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:20,999

187
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,999
(gun shooting)

188
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:37,999
Here
you are, Asif.

189
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,999
 Shochran. 

190
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,999
 Aswan. 

191
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:44,999
It's Asif.

192
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,999
I didn't say Asif ?

193
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,999
How do you say it ?

194
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:49,999
Ah-- sif.

195
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:51,999
Ah-- sif.

196
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:54,999
Good enough, right ?

197
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:56,999
I'm sorry.

198
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,999
(growling)

199
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,999
Did you hear that ?

200
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,999
No.

201
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:10,999
(speaking foreign language)

202
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,999
No.

203
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,999
You know
what, you're right.

204
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:16,999
Sorry, you'd think after a
couple weeks here

205
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:18,999
I wouldn't be so jumpy.

206
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,999
So these are the mountains of
the Registan Desert.

207
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:28,999
(speaking foreign language)

208
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:30,999
Yeah.

209
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:33,999
Still no sign of Derek.

210
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:37,999
Not to worry,
we'll find your brother.

211
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:42,999
Thank you, Asif.

212
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:43,999
When the embassy
wouldn't help me,

213
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:46,999
I didn't know what I
was gonna do.

214
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,999
(speaking foreign language)

215
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:53,999
I'm happy you're --

216
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:56,999
(growling)

217
00:17:56,999 --> 00:18:00,999
You heard it that
time, right ?

218
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:05,999
Stop, stop.

219
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:19,999
Nothing to be afraid of.

220
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,999
Ahh !

221
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,999
Help me my
friend's been hurt !

222
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:35,999
Ahh !

223
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:44,999
Help !

224
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:51,999
(Doc)
Hold your fire !

225
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:52,999
I'm from Colorado !
Drop your weapon !

226
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,999
I said drop your weapon.
I'm American.

227
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:56,999
Do not make me count because I
will not get past one.

228
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:58,999
You all right ?
Yeah.

229
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:00,999
It hit the vest
you're good.

230
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:02,999
Perimeter static for
fifty meters,

231
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:04,999
anything beyond
that is anyone's guess.

232
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,999
Everyone keep
your ears on.

233
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:09,999
I think I killed my guide.

234
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:11,999
Once he was bitten,
he was already dead.

235
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,999
If anything
you did him a favor.

236
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:15,999
Loser.
Yes.

237
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:16,999
(Chip)
He's gonna be fine.

238
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:18,999
Doesn't mean it
hurts any less.

239
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,999
Believe it or not,
he was wearing his vest.

240
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:21,999
It's a Christmas miracle.

241
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:24,999
That's gonna leave
a mark.

242
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:25,999
You should be dead.

243
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,999
Who are you... What are you
doing out here ?

244
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,083
You take a wrong turn
at the trail heading to India ?

245
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:32,999
My name is Dusty Miller.

246
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:34,999
Ahh !

247
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,999
(gun firing)

248
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:39,999
Pleased to
meet you in one piece.

249
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:41,999
DC, take corner !

250
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:43,999
My bad.

251
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,999
I'm not sure if you're
fully aware

252
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:45,999
of what we're
dealing with here,

253
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:46,999
but if you so much as
get a scratch

254
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,999
from one of these
things, you're dead.

255
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:52,999
Might not be a bad idea
if I check you out.

256
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:54,999
What ?

257
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:56,999
Scratches and bites.

258
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:58,999
Your safety and ours.

259
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:00,999
Your chivalry is
overwhelming, Chip.

260
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:01,999
If anyone's gonna be
checking her out,

261
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,999
it's gonna be tomboy.

262
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:05,999
Now remind me,
who are you ?

263
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:08,999
And what are you doing out
here in the middle of BFA ?

264
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:12,999
I'm trying to find my
brother, Derek Miller.

265
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:14,999
And he is... ?

266
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:15,999
Or was.

267
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,999
He is trying to end
the war on terror.

268
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:19,999
Well cheese and rice.

269
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:21,999
A gosh darn
freedom fighter !

270
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:22,999
Let me guess.

271
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:23,999
Business went up in
flames back home,

272
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:24,999
blamed it on the
war,

273
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:25,999
decided to solve the
world's problems

274
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,999
all on his own.

275
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:29,999
Probably bought a couple
of cheap weapons,

276
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:30,999
maybe a sword.

277
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,999
And tried to grow a beard.

278
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,000
You know, to fit in ?

279
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:35,999
Definitely a beard.

280
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:37,999
Probably still thinks
bin Laden's alive.

281
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:38,999
All right, listen up.

282
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:39,999
If it's all right if our
house guest here

283
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:42,999
solidify the perimeter
and hole up for the night.

284
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:44,999
This place is
as good as any.

285
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,999
*

286
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:20,999
Zombies.

287
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:23,999
Must not have
eaten for awhile.

288
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:27,999
What do we have here ?

289
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,999
(growling)

290
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:41,999
*

291
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:24,999
We may wanna start thinking
in terms of agua .

292
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:27,999
My map says there's
water maybe a mile out.

293
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:29,999
Let me see.

294
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:32,999
Yeah.

295
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:33,999
This is as good as ours.

296
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:36,999
Yeah, yours probably cost
about half a million dollars.

297
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:38,999
Close.

298
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,999
DC, Chip, you guys
wanna hop ahead ?

299
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:41,999
Make sure we're not
walking into an ambush.

300
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:43,999
Roger that.

301
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:45,999
Copy.

302
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,999
See you, boys.

303
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:51,999
So, um, what's
going on here ?

304
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:52,999
Can you be a bit
more specific ?

305
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:55,999
Okay, uhh...

306
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,999
how about the walking
dead to begin with ?

307
00:22:57,999 --> 00:22:58,999
Some run.

308
00:22:58,999 --> 00:22:59,999
That's classified.

309
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:01,999
I think your secret is
safe with me

310
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:02,999
considering none
of us are probably

311
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:04,999
going to make it out
of here alive.

312
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:05,999
She's got a point.

313
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:07,999
Speak for yourself, Joppo.

314
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:10,999
I plan on living in a
living sort of way.

315
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:20,999
Um, isn't el chapo a
new Mexican drug lord ?

316
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,999
Isn't dusty
an adjective

317
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:24,999
for something
covered in dust ?

318
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:26,999
I wasn't trying to
be rude.

319
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:29,999
That's better than
yelling cabeza .

320
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:44,999
Slow... slow !

321
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:47,999
Getting a little soft.

322
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:49,999
That's not what
your mom said.

323
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:54,999
My mom's dead, man.

324
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:56,999
Ugh, I'm sorry.

325
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:59,999
I'm sorry.

326
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:02,999
She lives in
Toledo, sucker !

327
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,999
Can you at least tell
me where we're going ?

328
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:10,999
Classified.

329
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:12,999
From the outside looking
in, it seems like

330
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:14,999
everything is
so classified.

331
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,999
None of you have any
idea what you're doing.

332
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,999
What does your brother
know about bin Laden ?

333
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:23,999
Well, for starters, he doesn't
think he was thrown to sea.

334
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:24,999
He's wrong.

335
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,999
Well, he still
thinks he's alive

336
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,999
and after
what I saw last night,

337
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,999
he can't be too
far off.

338
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:35,999
What aren't you
guys telling me ?

339
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:37,999
After the 9/11 attacks,

340
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:39,999
Bush pledged to win
the war on terror

341
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:41,999
by providing
increased weapon transfers

342
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:44,999
to all countries willing to
join America in the fight.

343
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:45,999
Enter Godsmack.

344
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:48,999
Godsmack was a biological
agent used to push

345
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:50,999
the militants out
from the high ground.

346
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:53,999
It was designed to contaminate
the natural water resources,

347
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:56,999
thereby forcing
the militants out of hiding.

348
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:57,999
Everything was going
as planned--

349
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,999
Until small man syndrome kicked
in from one of the piss ant

350
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,999
countries we sold
the stuff to.

351
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,999
Every country
has its Napoleon.

352
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:04,999
Who's ours ?

353
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:07,999
Well, there's Bill
Bonaparte, George Bonaparte.

354
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:09,999
Both George Bonapartes.

355
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,999
(speaking Spanish)

356
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,999
Those are the kinds of
guys that sign our checks.

357
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:15,999
And there's
Barack Bonaparte.

358
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:17,999
That one actually has
a nice ring to it.

359
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:19,999
It also increases
resale value.

360
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:21,999
Someone was bulking the
formula by adding other

361
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:25,999
biological agents to make
a sort of biochemical cocktail.

362
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:29,999
The combination had, let's
say, unexpected results.

363
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:32,999
It went from being a
relatively harmless nausea,

364
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,999
that temporarily contaminated
the water

365
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:36,999
to an active carcinogen

366
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:39,999
that create acute
biological mutations.

367
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:42,999
Acute biological mutations
as in, the living dead ?

368
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,999
Give that woman a prize.

369
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:47,999
As far as we know
the pathogens are regionalized.

370
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:50,999
Most of the outside
world has no clue.

371
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:52,999
Yeah, for now.

372
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:53,999
If it's anything
like Facebook,

373
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:55,999
it'll be in
Panama by next week.

374
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:57,999
I love Facebook.

375
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,999
(raspberry)

376
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:01,999
Now it's an
aggressive contagion.

377
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:03,999
And as far as we know, it
can only be transferred

378
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:05,999
by direct exchange
of bodily fluids.

379
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:08,000
Could you be a little more
specific on fluids, doc ?

380
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:09,999
Blood.

381
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:10,999
Unless you wanna do
your own research.

382
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:12,999
I'll pass.

383
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:13,999
The Department of Defense
has been monitoring

384
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:15,999
the militia camp for months.

385
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,999
Something big is going
down in less than 48 hours.

386
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:19,999
Detail was sketchy,
but intel suggests

387
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:22,999
there's gonna be
some heavy hitters.

388
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,999
(Dusty)
Do you think bin Laden's
still alive ?

389
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,999
It's not in our
pay grade to even ask.

390
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:28,999
Minimum, plus time and
a half on weekends.

391
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:31,999
And I'm super happy
about that.

392
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:32,999
But he could be, right ?

393
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:33,999
We've all considered it.

394
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:35,999
But how are they dealing
with the undead ?

395
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:37,999
I mean, they don't
seem too manageable.

396
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,999
They might be using them.

397
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:40,999
For what ?

398
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:41,999
For every few militants we
wipe out,

399
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:43,999
they get a few of ours.

400
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:45,999
Remember, there were
several hundred thousand

401
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:49,999
NATO boys and girls
occupying this hell hole

402
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:50,999
not too long ago.

403
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:52,999
But after somebody farted
under the covers,

404
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:54,999
the slumber party was over.

405
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:55,999
Everyone went
home in a hurry.

406
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:58,999
Confucius say, man who
fart in church

407
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:00,999
must sit in his own pew.

408
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:02,999
No one wanted to risk the
spread of the contagion

409
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,999
on their own country.

410
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,999
So all that's left is a few
lucky units of Special Forces

411
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:07,999
from a few
NATO countries.

412
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:10,999
We're American flavor,
with a squeeze of limey.

413
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:13,999
So... where's all
your support ?

414
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,999
We lost contact
with the OD a day ago.

415
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:18,999
Yeah, this is getting
better and better.

416
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:20,250
Well at least you're not
dragging around a civilian chick

417
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:22,999
with a mullet looking for
her retarded brother.

418
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,999
We have a rendezvous
point established

419
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:26,999
with overhead in two days.

420
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:28,999
My guess is we'll find
the militant's

421
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:29,999
stronghold before then.

422
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:30,999
I knew that my
brother was crazy,

423
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,999
but none of this makes
any sense.

424
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,999
When has terrorism
ever made sense ?

425
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:36,999
We and a few others are
the only things standing

426
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,999
between the people of
Afghanistan

427
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:40,999
and a zombie apocalypse.

428
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:41,999
Whether it makes sense to
you or not,

429
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:43,999
it's a hell of a mission.

430
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:45,999
One that we all
signed up for.

431
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:46,999
 (man) 
 Doc, are you guys coming ? 

432
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,999
 We found a spring 30 
 minutes ago. 

433
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:50,999
Copy...
We're on our way.

434
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:57,999
(Tomboy)
Joker, check this !

435
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:59,999
Hey, buttface !

436
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:01,999
(growling)

437
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:04,999
(gunshot)

438
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:05,999
(Joker)
Oh !

439
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:07,999
You mean no face.

440
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:13,999
*

441
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:24,999
(distant movement)

442
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:42,999
Shouldn't you be
in school or something ?

443
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:46,999
(groaning)

444
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,999
Some water ?

445
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:00,999
Come on, take some.

446
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:09,999
Should call these MRH's.

447
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,999
Meals ready to hurl.

448
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:14,999
Got some of the baddest
weapons on the planet

449
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:16,999
and the food still sucks.

450
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,999
Hey, doc.
Hey, tomboy.

451
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:20,999
Okay, shifts.

452
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,999
DC, you're first.

453
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,999
And Chip, then Chapo.

454
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,999
How come DC
always gets to go first ?

455
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,042
Joker and Tomboy will
take us 'til sun up.

456
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:33,999
Circle the perimeter
and rest on the high ground.

457
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:36,999
Everyone else, get your REM's
with one eye open.

458
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:04,999
I was only kidding
about the body search.

459
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:05,999
Yeah.

460
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:09,999
You married ?

461
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:11,999
Nope.

462
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:12,999
Girlfriend ?

463
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:15,999
A couple.

464
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:19,999
But we don't usually do body
searches on the first date.

465
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:22,876
I like to always buy
them dinner first.

466
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:27,999
How long you
been out here ?

467
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:29,999
Uh, couple weeks,

468
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:32,999
including the week it
took to get here.

469
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,999
And you never came across
'em till last night ?

470
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:39,999
I guess I was lucky.

471
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,999
Your brother either owes
you a lot of money

472
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:43,999
or you must
really love him.

473
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:45,999
Both.

474
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:47,542
You know in the end,
I think you end up doing

475
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:49,999
anything for family.

476
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:52,999
I got an uncle I
never really liked.

477
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:55,999
Probably wouldn't walk his
butt across the street.

478
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:00,999
You older or younger ?

479
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:04,999
I'm younger
by a couple years.

480
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:07,999
Don't take this the wrong way
'cause I'm not a psychologist,

481
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,999
but, your brother fits
the profile

482
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:13,999
of a guy who's a couple
tacos short of a combo plate.

483
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:14,999
Well, you're doing
the same thing,

484
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:18,417
so what does
that make you ?

485
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:19,999
Touché.

486
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:26,999
You know my brother was
a fire fighter in New York.

487
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:30,999
He was there 9/11 and his
whole crew died

488
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:34,999
in the collapse of the
towers while he was home sick.

489
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:35,999
Wow.

490
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:36,999
Yeah.

491
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:39,999
You know he never really
got over it

492
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:43,999
and he always thought of
himself as dead already

493
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:48,999
living on cheated time
and when they caught bin Laden

494
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:52,999
I thought you know,
it's finally over

495
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:55,999
and then it just got worse.

496
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,999
His conspiracy theories,
his obsessions,

497
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:04,999
and I think he just, he wants
to kill him himself, you know ?

498
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:08,999
That way, he knows
that he's dead.

499
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:14,999
I just want him home.

500
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:50,999
Derek.

501
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,999
Deh-deek.

502
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:57,999
No, my name is Derek.

503
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:00,999
Deh-deek.

504
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:03,999
Fine, take it.

505
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:07,999
What are you doing here ?

506
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:10,999
(speaking foreign language)

507
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:16,999
I have no idea
what you just said,

508
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:18,999
but I like you.

509
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,999
Ooo, ooo just not
the green one.

510
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:28,999
That tastes the best.

511
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:37,999
You think bin Laden's
still alive ?

512
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:40,999
I was reading some pretty
crazy stuff on this website

513
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:42,999
a couple weeks ago.

514
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:44,999
It made the hair on
my neck stand up.

515
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:47,999
Just something's
not right.

516
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:49,999
And I won't rest 'til
I know he's dead, I mean,

517
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:53,999
really dead this time.

518
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:54,999
What I've seen, there's a
fine line between

519
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:59,999
dead and not so dead.

520
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:28,999
Lieutenant ?

521
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:30,999
Where is everyone ?

522
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:33,999
Chip ?

523
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:35,999
Chip ?

524
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:37,999
Ahh !

525
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:40,999
Hey, easy.

526
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:42,999
Take it easy.

527
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:43,999
We're on civilian patrol
and sounds like the fight

528
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,999
is getting closer.

529
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:46,999
We have to pack
and go quietly.

530
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:48,999
Okay, okay.

531
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:52,999
Stay close and follow me.

532
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,999
Isn't
that your family ?

533
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:14,999
They look
non-infected to me.

534
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:16,999
Go get them.

535
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:22,999
Ah-hee !

536
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:24,999
Ah-hee !

537
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,999
(speaking foreign language)

538
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:46,999
We locked and loaded ?

539
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:47,999
I think so.

540
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:49,999
Can you please check ?

541
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:53,999
Thank you.

542
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:56,876
By the way, you could
sleep through a tornado.

543
00:35:56,999 --> 00:35:58,999
I guess I felt secure.

544
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:00,999
You were.

545
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:02,999
They've flanked us
from both sides.

546
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:03,999
How many ?

547
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:04,999
Fifty plus.

548
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:06,999
Fifty ?

549
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:07,999
I say we cast off before
they reach

550
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,999
Joker and Tomboy
in the rear.

551
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:10,999
Where's Chapo and DC ?

552
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:12,999
Chapo's holding the front,

553
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:14,999
DC's in the tree line
with big mama.

554
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:16,999
Carol !

555
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:20,999
That was gonna be
for your therapist !

556
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:24,999
And for your
plastic surgeon !

557
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:29,999
That was your trainer !

558
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,999
And whoever else
you're sleeping with.

559
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:35,999
I want my--

560
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:37,999
Well, it seems like
he's got things handled.

561
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:38,999
Let's move.

562
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:40,999
You stay here, duck
down by the rocks.

563
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,999
Try to shoot only what
you're sure is dead this time.

564
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:47,999
I'm not staying here.

565
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:48,999
You don't listen,
do you ?

566
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,999
(growling)

567
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:02,999
Oh, crap
it's a convention.

568
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:06,999
(gun clicking)

569
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:17,999
We have to get
to the tree line.

570
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:25,999
Let's move.

571
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:31,999
Haven't seen a group
this big

572
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,999
since they
opened a Walmart in my town.

573
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:37,999
All right.

574
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:39,999
Listen up.

575
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:42,999
We got about three minutes
to regroup before we're lunch.

576
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:43,999
How are we doing on ammo ?

577
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:45,999
Big mama's just
warming up.

578
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:46,999
Okay here.

579
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:47,999
Good n' plenty.

580
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,999
I love those.

581
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:50,999
Dropped my 45
in the clearing.

582
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:53,999
Yeah I dropped
my rifle too.

583
00:37:56,999 --> 00:37:57,999
You guys cover me.

584
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:58,999
I'll get both.

585
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:01,999
That's suicide, doc.

586
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:08,999
I'm already dead.

587
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,999
I'll get the guns.

588
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:15,999
Wait.

589
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:18,999
That's for getting bit.

590
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:26,999
I was supposed
to have your babies.

591
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:35,999
You know he's
infected, right ?

592
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:37,999
Only by blood.

593
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:40,999
You better hope so.

594
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:45,999
*

595
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:31,999
(growling)

596
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:39,999
Oh man, he's
still holding the grenade.

597
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:41,999
Shoot it !

598
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:45,999
30 meters.

599
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:53,999
20 meters !

600
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:54,999
Guys !

601
00:39:56,999 --> 00:39:57,999
Shoot it !

602
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:23,999
*

603
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:11,999
You gonna be
all right ?

604
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:13,999
Yeah, I'm fine.

605
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:20,999
That something we're gonna
have to worry about ?

606
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:22,999
Well left my Flintstone
Band-Aids back at base,

607
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:25,999
so this may
leave a pretty bad scar.

608
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:27,751
But if you're worried
about zombie offspring,

609
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:28,999
don't be.

610
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:31,999
You can still
have my babies.

611
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:36,999
This is what you
call friendly fire.

612
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:39,999
Well after reviewing all
the intel,

613
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:41,999
which consists of two maps,
one of which does not belong

614
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,999
to the US army, I think
we're close.

615
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:46,999
How close, I don't know.

616
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:48,999
Based upon our rations, I think
we should divide up

617
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:51,999
into two faster
moving quieter units

618
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:53,999
and before we start campaigning
or complaining,

619
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:55,999
let's discuss our options.

620
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:56,999
(Dusty)
I think first---

621
00:41:56,999 --> 00:41:58,999
I think DC's right.

622
00:41:58,999 --> 00:41:59,999
Splitting up increases
the chances of at least

623
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:01,999
one team making it to
the mission camp

624
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:04,999
and completing the mission.

625
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:05,999
Anyone got a better idea ?

626
00:42:05,999 --> 00:42:08,999
Steak and potatoes
at my mama's house ?

627
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:11,999
Porcelain toilet,
running water.

628
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:12,999
We'll equally divide the
food rations

629
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:13,999
and the nine mil ammo.

630
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,999
Joker you take the saw and
I'll keep Big Mama,

631
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:17,999
unless you wanna trade.

632
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:19,999
I got enough monkeys on my
back, but thanks, though.

633
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:22,999
You guys take
the military map.

634
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,999
Get out your compasses 'cause we
have zero calm overhead.

635
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:26,999
We are on our own.

636
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:28,999
I'm estimating about
a day and a half,

637
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:30,999
maybe faster
if you're humpin'.

638
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:32,999
Do not, I repeat, do not
go so fast

639
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:34,999
that you can't
fight when necessary.

640
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:35,999
Ranger training 101.

641
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:37,999
Water resources are
highlighted on the map,

642
00:42:37,999 --> 00:42:39,999
we'll rendezvous at
the objected point in 36 hours.

643
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,999
If you do not arrive at or
before 36 hours,

644
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:44,999
rangers, we will
expect the worst.

645
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:46,999
(Chapo)
We'll be there.

646
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:47,999
One way or the other.

647
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,999
Hopefully not the other.

648
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:50,999
All right, then.

649
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:52,999
We'll head due south in
the opposite direction,

650
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:54,999
but we'll be flanking you
for about the last ten miles.

651
00:42:54,999 --> 00:42:57,999
Now if you're gonna get
in trouble, do it there.

652
00:42:57,999 --> 00:42:58,999
Good ?

653
00:42:58,999 --> 00:43:01,999
Let's move out.

654
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:04,999
* One little, two little,
three little zombies *

655
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,792
* Shoot 'em in the head and
wipe the brains off me *

656
00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:12,999
*

657
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:17,999
(growling)

658
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:18,999
No, no, no, no !

659
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:20,999
(gunshots)

660
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:24,999
*

661
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:52,999
Did you ever think that
dead people

662
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:54,999
would be
the worst kind of enemy ?

663
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:58,999
Dead enemies were always
the best kind of enemies.

664
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:00,999
So where's all
the zombie crap ?

665
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:02,000
What ?

666
00:45:02,999 --> 00:45:04,999
Zombies obviously extract
some kind of nutrients

667
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:06,999
from eating, so,
where's all the poop ?

668
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:09,999
Are you serious
right now ?

669
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:10,999
Unless there's
zombies that I haven't seen

670
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,999
keeling over from
exploded bowels,

671
00:45:12,999 --> 00:45:14,999
they're evacuating somewhere.

672
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:15,999
I'll tell you what.

673
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:17,999
Next time we see one,
we'll flag him down

674
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:18,999
and check and see if he's
wearing a diaper.

675
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:20,999
(laughs)

676
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:21,999
Great, guys.

677
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:24,999
Maybe they're bulimic.

678
00:45:24,999 --> 00:45:26,999
After a delightful meal,
it daintily excuses itself

679
00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:29,999
only to return happily
for more brains.

680
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:32,999
I'd rather be bulimic
than poop my pants.

681
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:35,999
(growling)

682
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:40,999
Go ahead.

683
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:43,999
You ever seen
"Intervention ?"

684
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,999
Yeah, it's the
worst show on TV.

685
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:47,999
There was this one
episode where this lady

686
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:50,999
was yakkin' in zip loc bags
after every meal,

687
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:52,999
hiding them in a closet.

688
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:53,999
No !

689
00:45:53,999 --> 00:45:54,999
Yep.

690
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:55,999
After a hearty meal,
she'd go in the bathroom,

691
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:57,999
say hello to her dirty
little secret,

692
00:45:57,999 --> 00:46:01,999
bag it up in a
zip loc, put it in her closet.

693
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:04,999
And one day her husband
was putting his shoes on,

694
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:05,999
slides his foot into
yesterday's lunch

695
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:08,999
and cat's out of the bag.

696
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,083
That's assuming
she had cat for lunch.

697
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:13,999
So what happened ?

698
00:46:13,999 --> 00:46:14,999
Of course they did an
intervention on her

699
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:15,999
with that crazy host lady.

700
00:46:15,999 --> 00:46:17,999
You know, the one that
could probably use

701
00:46:17,999 --> 00:46:19,999
an intervention herself.

702
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:21,999
They got her
all squared away.

703
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:23,999
We had to do an intervention
on my mom once.

704
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,999
Oh yeah, what for ?

705
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:27,999
You remember those little
stuffed animal toys,

706
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:28,999
the Beanie Babies ?

707
00:46:28,999 --> 00:46:29,999
Yeah, I remember those.

708
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:30,999
She had hundreds of them.

709
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,999
After she filled up all
the bookshelves in the house,

710
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,999
she started buying special
cabinets to put them in.

711
00:46:35,999 --> 00:46:36,999
At first, my dad
thought it was a good idea,

712
00:46:36,999 --> 00:46:38,999
you know, give her
a little hobby.

713
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:40,999
What he didn't know was
that there was hundreds more

714
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:42,999
underneath all the beds
in the house.

715
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:43,999
So how'd it
come to a head ?

716
00:46:43,999 --> 00:46:46,999
My little sister, she
wanted to take one to school

717
00:46:46,999 --> 00:46:47,999
for "Show And Tell."

718
00:46:47,999 --> 00:46:48,999
She just reached up one
of the bookshelves,

719
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:51,999
she didn't know what she was
bringing down, you know.

720
00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:53,999
Turns out it was Paddy
the Platypus,

721
00:46:53,999 --> 00:46:55,999
one of the original nine.

722
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,999
Oh, not Paddy.

723
00:46:56,999 --> 00:46:57,999
So my sister comes home
from school,

724
00:46:57,999 --> 00:46:58,999
takes it
out of the backpack,

725
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:00,999
it's got a little
stain on it

726
00:47:00,999 --> 00:47:02,999
'cause all the kids were
passing it around at lunch.

727
00:47:02,999 --> 00:47:04,999
She goes ballistic.

728
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:05,999
Geez.

729
00:47:05,999 --> 00:47:06,999
So my dad's like, "Enough's
enough," y'know ?

730
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:08,999
"It's either us,
or the Beanie Babies."

731
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:10,999
To be honest, it took her
a little while to decide.

732
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:12,999
(laughs)

733
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:18,999
(Joker)
Nice, Tomboy.

734
00:47:18,999 --> 00:47:21,999
Nice.

735
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:27,999
Feel better ?

736
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,999
Yeah, a little.

737
00:47:30,999 --> 00:47:33,751
Check the pants ?

738
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:40,999
Who's Carol, anyway ?

739
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:41,999
I mean, I don't mean to pry...

740
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:43,999
it's just I heard you
yelling her name

741
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:46,999
in what seemed to be
like a hate filled rage

742
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:49,999
over and over.

743
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:51,999
I loved Carol
my whole life.

744
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:54,999
Operative verb tense--
loved.

745
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:57,334
Well, maybe you still do,
that's why it hurts.

746
00:47:57,999 --> 00:47:59,999
Somewhere in the recesses
of the heart she ripped out ?

747
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,999
Doubtful.

748
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:03,999
All Carol does is motivate
me to kill things

749
00:48:03,999 --> 00:48:04,999
that should already be dead.

750
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:06,999
But you loved her.

751
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:08,999
Well, how could I not ?

752
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:10,999
She gave me her juice box when
I was in Kindergarten.

753
00:48:10,999 --> 00:48:12,999
She doesn't
seem that bad.

754
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:15,999
She was like a foot taller
than me.

755
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:18,999
I mean, she used to make me so
nervous my hands would sweat.

756
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:19,999
Maybe she just
felt bad for me

757
00:48:19,999 --> 00:48:22,999
because I never had
enough money for school lunch.

758
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:24,999
You grow up poor ?

759
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:26,999
No, I had
a Pokémon problem.

760
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:28,999
Mom gave me money for
school lunch

761
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:31,999
and I used to spend it
on Pokémon cards instead.

762
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,999
Carol bought me school lunch
every single day

763
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:34,999
all the way up
through eighth grade.

764
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:38,999
Well, she doesn't sound
that bad to me.

765
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,999
Well, prescription drugs
do funny things.

766
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:44,999
I mean, she was so beautiful--
she just never saw it.

767
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:46,999
I don't know if it was
the screwed up relationship

768
00:48:46,999 --> 00:48:49,999
she had with her dad-- Man,
that guy was a tool--

769
00:48:49,999 --> 00:48:51,999
Or maybe some people are
just born that way I don't know.

770
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:52,999
But no matter how many
times I told her

771
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:55,999
how beautiful she
was, it never sank in.

772
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,999
I guess it didn't help
I was gone all the time.

773
00:48:58,999 --> 00:48:59,999
She knew that going in.

774
00:48:59,999 --> 00:49:01,999
Well according to her therapist,
I have all the blame.

775
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:03,999
Yeah, well next time
some rag head decides

776
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:07,999
to park a 747 in the lobby of
a ninety story skyscraper,

777
00:49:07,999 --> 00:49:09,999
a therapist will be
the first on my call list.

778
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:11,999
It wasn't his fault.

779
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:13,999
I mean, the over abundance of
crap he was prescribing

780
00:49:13,999 --> 00:49:16,999
for her didn't help, but
her damn plastic surgeon.

781
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:18,999
Sleeping with him ?

782
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:19,999
Knocking boots.

783
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:21,999
Horizontal hopscotch.

784
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:22,999
Bumpin' uglies.

785
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:24,999
Thank you, Chip.

786
00:49:24,999 --> 00:49:26,999
Point is, there wasn't a
whole lot of sleeping going on.

787
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:28,999
Turns out the road between
patient to bed buddies

788
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:29,999
isn't very long.

789
00:49:29,999 --> 00:49:31,999
How long did
they know each other ?

790
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:32,999
Huh-- Let's see.

791
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:35,999
After the nose job she
absolutely didn't need.

792
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,999
Then Botox for the crow's feet
that I thought were sexy,

793
00:49:38,999 --> 00:49:40,999
maybe two months.

794
00:49:40,999 --> 00:49:41,999
Yeah, I'm sorry.

795
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:43,999
And then all the Prozac and
whatever the hell else

796
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:46,999
she was taking, combined
with the fact that I was gone,

797
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:47,999
combined with the fact that
doctor was whispering

798
00:49:47,999 --> 00:49:49,999
in her ear the whole time.

799
00:49:49,999 --> 00:49:51,999
I guess we both
just changed.

800
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:53,999
And that's
when DC was born.

801
00:49:54,999 --> 00:49:56,999
You mean reborn ?

802
00:49:56,999 --> 00:49:57,999
No, he means born.

803
00:49:57,999 --> 00:49:58,999
My name is Ryan Parker.

804
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:01,999
DC has nothing to
do with my initials.

805
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:02,999
What's DC ?

806
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,999
Well my best friend called me
that after I spent a year

807
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:06,999
in divorce court.

808
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:08,999
It got so ugly.

809
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:09,999
Not because of me, dude--
I gave her everything.

810
00:50:09,999 --> 00:50:11,999
I know--
I was there.

811
00:50:11,999 --> 00:50:12,999
It was the dog
we argued over.

812
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:14,999
She hated that thing until
she knew I wanted him.

813
00:50:15,501 --> 00:50:16,999
That sucks.

814
00:50:16,999 --> 00:50:17,999
Yeah, anyway.

815
00:50:17,999 --> 00:50:18,999
Joint custody.

816
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:20,999
Weekends and Christmas.

817
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:22,999
(grunts)

818
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:31,999
(DC)
I doubt he'll
be getting back up.

819
00:50:31,999 --> 00:50:32,999
That's nice.

820
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:33,999
One less we have
to kill again.

821
00:50:33,999 --> 00:50:36,999
Well what do you think
he was doing out here alone ?

822
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:38,999
Maybe that was his friend
dining on him.

823
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:39,999
Doubt it.

824
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,999
The one I shot's militia.

825
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:43,999
What's left of
this one, civilian.

826
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:44,999
Not that--

827
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:47,999
What the...

828
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:53,999
His throat's been cut.

829
00:50:58,999 --> 00:51:00,999
Nobody move.

830
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:02,999
This guy's wired.

831
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:03,999
You think he was
wired before ?

832
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:05,999
Looks like an IED.

833
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:07,999
I doubt it was Hannibal
the Cannibal here though.

834
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:09,999
What's the point ?

835
00:51:09,999 --> 00:51:11,999
Whatever it is,
we fell for it.

836
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,999
Slowly step away.

837
00:51:12,999 --> 00:51:14,999
Retrace your steps.

838
00:51:14,999 --> 00:51:16,999
Yeah, real slow.

839
00:51:20,999 --> 00:51:21,999
Incoming !

840
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:24,999
Move, move, move !

841
00:51:34,999 --> 00:51:37,999
This is actually
kind of nice.

842
00:51:37,999 --> 00:51:38,999
Humans shooting humans...

843
00:51:38,999 --> 00:51:40,999
More like the war
I'm used to.

844
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:42,999
Son of a card !

845
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,999
Hey, DC, you ok ?

846
00:51:44,999 --> 00:51:46,999
I think I picked
up some schrap.

847
00:52:08,999 --> 00:52:10,999
(grunting)

848
00:52:21,999 --> 00:52:22,999
All right.

849
00:52:22,999 --> 00:52:24,999
Let's take five and
get our bearing.

850
00:52:24,999 --> 00:52:26,999
I'm going to take one.

851
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:29,999
A number one.

852
00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:32,999
Do you take a number one or do
you leave a number one ?

853
00:52:32,999 --> 00:52:34,999
Sounds like a
personal decision.

854
00:52:34,999 --> 00:52:36,999
I'll leave it.

855
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:40,999
Looks like we're coming up
on some hostile territory.

856
00:52:41,999 --> 00:52:42,999
No, really ?

857
00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:45,999
I thought this would be a
great place for a summer home.

858
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:48,999
There's no indication of
this road on the map

859
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,999
but its clear they used it
for transport at one point.

860
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:55,999
Yeah, maybe there's an IHOP
at the top of the hill.

861
00:52:55,999 --> 00:52:57,999
You know,
what's your deal, Huh ?

862
00:52:57,999 --> 00:52:59,999
Whoa !

863
00:53:04,999 --> 00:53:05,999
Joker ?

864
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:07,999
Yeah I know.

865
00:53:07,999 --> 00:53:09,999
It's platter charge.

866
00:53:09,999 --> 00:53:11,999
Never deployed.

867
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:21,999
How many of those
have we walked by ?

868
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:27,999
Man.

869
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:29,999
It's a Tupperware party
from Hell.

870
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:32,999
All right, well... uh.

871
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:34,999
Let's very carefully retrace
our steps and head back

872
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:37,999
the way we came.

873
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:40,999
Man !

874
00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:43,999
Looks like the party's
still in full swing.

875
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:49,999
Where are
these guys coming from ?

876
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:58,999
That one's gonna hit
a bomb.

877
00:53:58,999 --> 00:54:00,999
Hit it !

878
00:54:00,999 --> 00:54:02,999
Yes !

879
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:10,999
(guns shooting)

880
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:16,999
Chapo, we got to move !

881
00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:19,999
Hold your position unless
you want to go kaboom !

882
00:54:21,999 --> 00:54:23,999
(grunting)

883
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:28,999
Guys, what are we
gonna do ?

884
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:30,000
Chapo !

885
00:54:30,999 --> 00:54:32,999
I'm open for
suggestions, Joker !

886
00:54:35,999 --> 00:54:36,999
We gotta move !

887
00:54:36,999 --> 00:54:38,999
All right, it's better than
staying for dinner.

888
00:54:40,999 --> 00:54:42,999
Either way,
it's gonna end bad.

889
00:54:42,999 --> 00:54:44,584
Just watch your step !

890
00:54:47,999 --> 00:54:51,876
(Screaming and shooting)

891
00:55:03,999 --> 00:55:06,999
That was awesome !

892
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:07,999
Whoa !

893
00:55:07,999 --> 00:55:09,999
Watch where you're
pointing that thing.

894
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:10,999
Who the hell are you ?

895
00:55:10,999 --> 00:55:11,999
Derek Miller.

896
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:13,999
And you shouldn't
be on this road.

897
00:55:13,999 --> 00:55:15,999
Chances are there's
road-side bombs on it.

898
00:55:15,999 --> 00:55:16,999
You don't say.

899
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:18,999
You could have gotten
yourself and us killed.

900
00:55:18,999 --> 00:55:21,999
You wouldn't be complaining if I
didn't show up when I did.

901
00:55:21,999 --> 00:55:23,999
The man's got a point.

902
00:55:23,999 --> 00:55:25,999
We know who you are.

903
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:26,999
Your sister's with
the rest of our unit.

904
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:28,999
My sister ?

905
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:29,999
She's here ?

906
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:32,999
Looking for you.

907
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:33,999
I didn't think she'd come !

908
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:36,999
Apparently stupidity
runs in the family.

909
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:37,999
We had to save her.

910
00:55:37,999 --> 00:55:40,999
Albeit, the same way
you just saved us.

911
00:55:40,999 --> 00:55:42,999
I guess that makes us even.

912
00:55:42,999 --> 00:55:43,999
Yeah.

913
00:55:43,999 --> 00:55:45,999
Except you have no
business being here.

914
00:55:45,999 --> 00:55:46,999
I'm helping to
fund this thing.

915
00:55:46,999 --> 00:55:47,999
Why shouldn't I be here ?

916
00:55:47,999 --> 00:55:50,999
Because you're gonna get
yourself killed, Mr. Miller.

917
00:55:50,999 --> 00:55:52,999
Yeah ?

918
00:55:52,999 --> 00:55:55,999
You guys want
to ride somewhere ?

919
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:57,999
Uh, not on this road.

920
00:55:58,999 --> 00:55:59,999
Come on !

921
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,999
*

922
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:06,999
 (shouting Arabic) 

923
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,999
What do we got ?

924
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:11,999
Glass !

925
00:56:11,999 --> 00:56:12,999
Cheap mothers !

926
00:56:12,999 --> 00:56:14,999
Guns are way more effective.

927
00:56:14,999 --> 00:56:16,999
File a complaint.

928
00:56:18,999 --> 00:56:19,999
What are you doing ?

929
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:20,999
You want to bleed out ?

930
00:56:20,999 --> 00:56:22,999
You couldn't think
of anything else ?

931
00:56:22,999 --> 00:56:24,999
Nothing came to mind.

932
00:56:24,999 --> 00:56:27,999
Let's see what we got ?

933
00:56:27,999 --> 00:56:30,999
(grunts)
Yeah, that's in deep.

934
00:56:30,999 --> 00:56:33,999
You may want to
leave this in.

935
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:34,999
You out of your mind ?

936
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:38,999
If it hit an artery and I
pull it out, you're screwed.

937
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:40,999
I'll take my chances.

938
00:56:40,999 --> 00:56:42,999
All right.

939
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,999
You better
bear down then.

940
00:56:44,999 --> 00:56:46,999
What does that mean ?

941
00:56:46,999 --> 00:56:47,999
Like you're having
a baby or something.

942
00:56:47,999 --> 00:56:50,999
I don't know
what that means !

943
00:56:50,999 --> 00:56:51,999
You know what ?

944
00:56:51,999 --> 00:56:53,999
Just clench your butt cheeks
cause this is gonna hurt

945
00:56:53,999 --> 00:56:55,999
like a son of a--
(screaming)

946
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:58,999
It's definitely
an artery.

947
00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:04,999
If you bleed to death,
I'm going to be really pissed.

948
00:57:06,999 --> 00:57:07,999
Any better ?

949
00:57:07,999 --> 00:57:09,999
No.

950
00:57:13,999 --> 00:57:16,999
Guys, we have
a serious problem.

951
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:18,999
Here, chew on these.

952
00:57:18,999 --> 00:57:19,999
Don't get comfortable--

953
00:57:19,999 --> 00:57:20,999
It doesn't' sound like
we're staying long.

954
00:57:20,999 --> 00:57:22,999
Anything else ?

955
00:57:22,999 --> 00:57:23,999
Yeah-- Don't die.

956
00:57:23,999 --> 00:57:24,999
What do we got ?

957
00:57:29,999 --> 00:57:30,999
That's our exit.

958
00:57:30,999 --> 00:57:31,999
Come on !

959
00:57:31,999 --> 00:57:33,999
(shooting)

960
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:37,999
Hey !

961
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:39,999
What's the last
thing I said ?

962
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:41,999
I'm not dead yet.

963
00:57:41,999 --> 00:57:43,999
You're going to hate me, but
we got to move now !

964
00:57:43,999 --> 00:57:45,999
I can't.
Hey, hey, hey !

965
00:57:45,999 --> 00:57:46,999
Look at me--
Look at me !

966
00:57:46,999 --> 00:57:49,999
Do it for Carol,
all right ?

967
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,999
We're all going to die
if you don't leave me behind.

968
00:57:51,999 --> 00:57:52,999
You are so negative !

969
00:57:52,999 --> 00:57:54,999
Come on !

970
00:57:55,999 --> 00:57:57,999
Dusty, grab my pack and gun !

971
00:57:57,999 --> 00:57:59,999
Stop being such
a baby.

972
00:57:59,999 --> 00:58:00,999
You know I'm right.

973
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:01,999
We leave no man behind,

974
00:58:01,999 --> 00:58:02,999
weren't you listening in
boot camp ?

975
00:58:02,999 --> 00:58:04,999
Dusty, if anything gets
within ten feet

976
00:58:04,999 --> 00:58:06,999
put a bullet in it.

977
00:58:14,999 --> 00:58:16,999
(grunting)

978
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:21,999
So what do you know ?

979
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:23,999
I know this whole thing would
be a little easier

980
00:58:23,999 --> 00:58:25,999
without the flesh eating ghouls.

981
00:58:25,999 --> 00:58:27,999
I mean what do you know
about where you are,

982
00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:29,999
what your destination is,

983
00:58:29,999 --> 00:58:33,999
what you plan to do
once you get there, Superman ?

984
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:36,999
Pretty sure I'm still in
the Registan Desert

985
00:58:36,999 --> 00:58:37,999
at least that's
what the map says

986
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:39,999
that I downloaded from
Google Earth.

987
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,999
Six dollar
compass may be cheap,

988
00:58:41,999 --> 00:58:44,999
but it's still
pointing north.

989
00:58:44,999 --> 00:58:45,999
So my destination
is militia camp

990
00:58:45,999 --> 00:58:47,999
where I think
they're hiding bin Laden.

991
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:50,999
And yes, he's still alive.

992
00:58:50,999 --> 00:58:52,999
So my plan is to kill him
when I get there,

993
00:58:52,999 --> 00:58:55,999
before we have
to wait another ten years.

994
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,999
Although I'm thinking about
bringing him in alive,

995
00:58:57,999 --> 00:58:59,999
I think the bounty on
him would still be pretty good.

996
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:01,999
Would go a long way
in paying for this

997
00:59:01,999 --> 00:59:04,999
expensive vacation of mine.

998
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:05,999
I don't know how
you guys got here,

999
00:59:05,999 --> 00:59:08,501
but my, uh, coach ticket
was two thousand bucks.

1000
00:59:08,999 --> 00:59:09,999
I haven't even heard
of another bounty.

1001
00:59:09,999 --> 00:59:11,999
I mean, most of the free
world has no clue

1002
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,709
what's going on.

1003
00:59:13,999 --> 00:59:14,751
Oh.

1004
00:59:14,999 --> 00:59:16,999
Well, that sucks.

1005
00:59:16,999 --> 00:59:18,999
What makes you think
he's still alive ?

1006
00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:20,999
You're telling
me that he's not ?

1007
00:59:20,999 --> 00:59:22,999
Truth is,
we don't know.

1008
00:59:22,999 --> 00:59:24,999
I know.

1009
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:26,999
How do you know that,
living in Colorado ?

1010
00:59:26,999 --> 00:59:27,999
Let me know if you want
to talk about

1011
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:29,999
the two hundred fifty
billion dollar in bail out.

1012
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,999
That didn't do anyone
any good.

1013
00:59:31,999 --> 00:59:33,999
I got some
thoughts on that one, too.

1014
00:59:33,999 --> 00:59:35,999
Oh, I'm sure you do.

1015
00:59:35,999 --> 00:59:37,999
How about we talk about
this militia camp ?

1016
00:59:37,999 --> 00:59:40,999
Like why you even think
it's there to begin with ?

1017
00:59:40,999 --> 00:59:43,999
And why you think bin Laden
might be there ?

1018
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:47,999
I took this off of a guy that
obviously can't read anymore.

1019
00:59:50,999 --> 00:59:51,999
Yeah-- No question that
this is Intel

1020
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:54,999
on the militia camp.

1021
00:59:54,999 --> 00:59:55,999
But who's there is
anyone's guess.

1022
00:59:55,999 --> 00:59:56,999
Even we're guessing.

1023
00:59:56,999 --> 00:59:59,999
You guys do that a lot.

1024
01:00:00,999 --> 01:00:03,999
But you're trying, which
is all anyone can ask.

1025
01:00:03,999 --> 01:00:06,999
Look, the road that
we're on was not on my map.

1026
01:00:06,999 --> 01:00:08,999
Okay-- It's not on
any maps.

1027
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:10,999
But it is on this one.

1028
01:00:10,999 --> 01:00:12,999
So someone went to great
lengths to cover it up.

1029
01:00:12,999 --> 01:00:14,999
And my guess is
that anyone that stumbles

1030
01:00:14,999 --> 01:00:17,999
on this road would get a
butt full of hello.

1031
01:00:17,999 --> 01:00:18,999
Great name
for a band.

1032
01:00:19,667 --> 01:00:20,999
So we must be
close to a town.

1033
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:22,999
No.

1034
01:00:22,999 --> 01:00:24,876
No, there's no town
on here.

1035
01:00:24,999 --> 01:00:26,999
So where are all the
civilian zombies come from ?

1036
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:29,999
Well, it's my personal opinion
that they're making them.

1037
01:00:29,999 --> 01:00:31,999
Well we know
they're making them, genius.

1038
01:00:31,999 --> 01:00:33,999
No, I think they're bringing
uninfected people

1039
01:00:33,999 --> 01:00:36,999
into the camp and
they're holding on to them

1040
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:38,999
until they need them
to eat people.

1041
01:00:38,999 --> 01:00:40,999
I think the altitude
has gotten to you, amigo.

1042
01:00:41,209 --> 01:00:44,999
Most of them are prisoners,
but I think some

1043
01:00:44,999 --> 01:00:46,999
come willingly,
you know, in the name of Allah.

1044
01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:48,999
Suicide chompers.

1045
01:00:48,999 --> 01:00:50,999
 Estás loco .

1046
01:00:50,999 --> 01:00:52,999
You're crazy.

1047
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:53,999
Well I mean, if you
think about it,

1048
01:00:53,999 --> 01:00:54,999
it's really no different

1049
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:55,999
than a woman walking
into a crowded market

1050
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:58,999
with ten kilos of C4 packed
in her baby's stroller.

1051
01:00:58,999 --> 01:01:00,999
Makes sense to me.

1052
01:01:00,999 --> 01:01:04,999
Well, not really, but why not
send in a suicide bomber

1053
01:01:04,999 --> 01:01:06,999
that has a bomb
that doesn't just go off once,

1054
01:01:06,999 --> 01:01:09,999
but over and over and over ?

1055
01:01:14,999 --> 01:01:17,999
So what makes you think
bin Laden might be there ?

1056
01:01:17,999 --> 01:01:20,999
What makes you think
he isn't ?

1057
01:01:22,999 --> 01:01:24,999
(grunting)

1058
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:29,999
Sorry.

1059
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:31,999
Dusty, can you
grab that ?

1060
01:01:31,999 --> 01:01:32,999
Little help here, buddy.

1061
01:01:33,959 --> 01:01:35,999
We still gotta make it
up that hill.

1062
01:01:35,999 --> 01:01:36,999
(DC)
Then what ?

1063
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:40,999
I don't know, I'm not
a cruise director.

1064
01:01:40,999 --> 01:01:41,999
Can't feel my leg.

1065
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:44,999
That's cause you have
a bottle of Coke in it.

1066
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:45,999
I'm not gonna make it.

1067
01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:48,999
Remember that weekend we came
home from munitions training

1068
01:01:48,999 --> 01:01:51,999
and Carol had all your
stuff across the front yard ?

1069
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,999
Damn yard sale.

1070
01:01:53,999 --> 01:01:54,999
It was all your
stuff, too.

1071
01:01:55,501 --> 01:01:56,999
She had it priced good.

1072
01:01:56,999 --> 01:01:58,999
She sold my alligator boots.

1073
01:01:58,999 --> 01:01:59,999
I bought three pairs of jeans.

1074
01:01:59,999 --> 01:02:01,999
Parker.

1075
01:02:01,999 --> 01:02:04,999
Get up, Parker.

1076
01:02:04,999 --> 01:02:05,999
Get up, soldier.

1077
01:02:05,999 --> 01:02:06,999
I can't.

1078
01:02:06,999 --> 01:02:07,999
We're almost there.

1079
01:02:08,999 --> 01:02:10,999
Come on, come on !

1080
01:02:12,999 --> 01:02:14,999
(Dusty)
They're coming !

1081
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:15,999
What else is new ?

1082
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:16,999
Shoot 'em.

1083
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,999
We're going to have to find
some water if we're going

1084
01:02:18,999 --> 01:02:20,999
to get this thing
running again.

1085
01:02:20,999 --> 01:02:22,999
Pee in it.

1086
01:02:22,999 --> 01:02:23,999
Ain't gonna happen.

1087
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,999
I went an hour ago.

1088
01:02:24,999 --> 01:02:27,999
Well, I'm empty--
We leave it.

1089
01:02:27,999 --> 01:02:29,999
Leave it ?

1090
01:02:29,999 --> 01:02:31,999
It's a perfectly good truck.

1091
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:32,999
Put a for sale sign
on it.

1092
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:33,999
Somebody
will come along.

1093
01:02:33,999 --> 01:02:35,999
No, we wait around
a bit.

1094
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:36,999
We'll find water.

1095
01:02:36,999 --> 01:02:38,999
What do you want us
to do, a rain dance ?

1096
01:02:38,999 --> 01:02:40,999
Hey, pack it up.

1097
01:02:40,999 --> 01:02:41,999
I don't want to be
here when it gets dark.

1098
01:02:45,999 --> 01:02:47,999
We got to at least
take this gun.

1099
01:02:47,999 --> 01:02:50,999
Oh sure, as long as
you want to carry it.

1100
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:52,999
Never mind.

1101
01:03:03,999 --> 01:03:04,999
What ?

1102
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:08,999
One here, one there,
they weren't using them.

1103
01:03:08,999 --> 01:03:10,999
Don't shoot yourself in
the foot, Captain America.

1104
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:13,999
Don't shoot
anyone in the foot.

1105
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:23,999
(Chip)
Come on,
almost there.

1106
01:03:23,999 --> 01:03:25,999
(Dusty)
They're coming up fast !

1107
01:03:30,999 --> 01:03:31,999
I got one !

1108
01:03:35,999 --> 01:03:36,999
You with me, buddy ?

1109
01:03:36,999 --> 01:03:38,999
Huh-- Parker ?

1110
01:03:38,999 --> 01:03:40,999
(grunting)
Yeah, I know.

1111
01:03:40,999 --> 01:03:42,999
Just tightening
my shirt.

1112
01:03:42,999 --> 01:03:44,999
I got to go
in here and clear this,

1113
01:03:44,999 --> 01:03:46,999
but then I'm coming back
to fix your leg

1114
01:03:46,999 --> 01:03:47,999
I promise.

1115
01:03:47,999 --> 01:03:48,999
Okay ?

1116
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:50,999
You have my gun ?

1117
01:03:50,999 --> 01:03:51,999
All right, let's go.

1118
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:53,999
Stay with me, buddy.

1119
01:04:18,999 --> 01:04:20,999
(Dusty)
This can't be
a good idea.

1120
01:04:20,999 --> 01:04:23,999
(Chip)
It's not.

1121
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,125
We're clear.

1122
01:04:34,999 --> 01:04:36,999
What do you think
they're on line for ?

1123
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:38,999
Who knows ?

1124
01:04:38,999 --> 01:04:40,999
They're crazy.

1125
01:04:40,999 --> 01:04:42,999
Eight trillion dollars worth
of untapped natural resources

1126
01:04:42,999 --> 01:04:45,999
here and no one can seem
to get past the oil.

1127
01:04:45,999 --> 01:04:48,999
I think I'd rather take
my chances out in the open.

1128
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:50,999
(growling)

1129
01:04:53,999 --> 01:04:55,999
I think
you're right.

1130
01:04:55,999 --> 01:04:57,999
Let's get out of here.

1131
01:05:00,999 --> 01:05:02,999
(screaming)

1132
01:05:06,999 --> 01:05:07,999
Just run !

1133
01:05:07,999 --> 01:05:08,999
Chip !

1134
01:05:13,999 --> 01:05:15,999
Get out of here !

1135
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:20,999
Chip !

1136
01:05:29,999 --> 01:05:30,999
(Chip)
DC, we're coming !

1137
01:05:30,999 --> 01:05:32,999
Get out the way !

1138
01:05:37,999 --> 01:05:39,999
Here !

1139
01:05:41,999 --> 01:05:43,999
I got you, I got you.

1140
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:44,999
It hurt.

1141
01:05:44,999 --> 01:05:46,999
They don't call it
Big Mama for nothing.

1142
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:47,999
All right.

1143
01:05:47,999 --> 01:05:49,999
Let's get your leg fixed.

1144
01:05:49,999 --> 01:05:54,999
I just want to lay
down for a second.

1145
01:05:54,999 --> 01:05:57,999
Just let me lay here.

1146
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,999
We can do that.

1147
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:13,999
I really
want my dog back.

1148
01:06:13,999 --> 01:06:16,250
Okay.

1149
01:06:16,999 --> 01:06:19,999
We can do that.

1150
01:06:19,999 --> 01:06:22,999
Bark.

1151
01:06:22,999 --> 01:06:24,999
Stay with me, man.

1152
01:06:24,999 --> 01:06:27,999
Stay with me.

1153
01:06:27,999 --> 01:06:30,999
I always loved her.

1154
01:06:33,999 --> 01:06:35,999
I know.

1155
01:06:37,999 --> 01:06:39,999
Oh God.

1156
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:42,999
DC.

1157
01:07:08,999 --> 01:07:11,999
*

1158
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:26,999
(Chapo)
Zombies
and insurgents.

1159
01:07:26,999 --> 01:07:27,999
Flank out.

1160
01:07:27,999 --> 01:07:29,999
Keep your eyes peeled.

1161
01:07:40,999 --> 01:07:41,999
Lock and load.

1162
01:07:41,999 --> 01:07:44,999
Shoot anything that's
alive or zombie-fied.

1163
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:48,999
What did the zombie eat after
he got his teeth pulled ?

1164
01:07:48,999 --> 01:07:50,999
I don't know-- what ?

1165
01:07:50,999 --> 01:07:51,999
The dentist.

1166
01:07:51,999 --> 01:07:54,999
(laughing)
Shut your mouth.

1167
01:07:54,999 --> 01:07:56,999
You might as well send up a
flare while you're at it.

1168
01:07:56,999 --> 01:07:58,292
Sorry.

1169
01:07:58,999 --> 01:08:00,999
But you just
gave me the best idea.

1170
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,999
I don't know if these
things can smell this

1171
01:08:07,999 --> 01:08:10,999
but this is the best we
can do for now.

1172
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:13,999
And then what ?

1173
01:08:13,999 --> 01:08:18,999
When we get square,
we come back for him.

1174
01:08:19,999 --> 01:08:22,999
What are you going
to do with these ?

1175
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:25,999
These rightfully belong
to his ex-wife,

1176
01:08:25,999 --> 01:08:27,999
but that ain't gonna happen.

1177
01:08:31,999 --> 01:08:35,999
Uh, how'd he
carry this thing ?

1178
01:08:35,999 --> 01:08:37,999
There's movement down there.

1179
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:42,999
Wait, wait, wait,
wait-- Derek ?

1180
01:08:42,999 --> 01:08:44,999
Derek !

1181
01:08:44,999 --> 01:08:46,999
I can't' believe
you're here !

1182
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:48,999
Derek !

1183
01:08:51,999 --> 01:08:54,999
You're so stupid !

1184
01:08:54,999 --> 01:08:56,999
Come on.

1185
01:09:03,999 --> 01:09:05,999
Why doesn't it surprise me
you're not wearing a shirt ?

1186
01:09:05,999 --> 01:09:08,999
I'm going to have
to borrow one.

1187
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:28,999
Give 'em a little taste
of their own medicine.

1188
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:30,999
Anything that decides it
needs a breath of fresh air,

1189
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:33,999
it will most certainly be
its last.

1190
01:09:33,999 --> 01:09:34,999
Again.

1191
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:36,999
(Chapo)
Will you go grab that guy ?

1192
01:09:36,999 --> 01:09:38,999
The idea of a civilian
covered in guns out here

1193
01:09:38,999 --> 01:09:40,999
peeing by himself makes
me a little nervous.

1194
01:09:40,999 --> 01:09:42,999
Where would you
like me to grab him ?

1195
01:09:42,999 --> 01:09:44,999
That's up to you, amigo.

1196
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,999
He's done okay
this far.

1197
01:09:55,999 --> 01:09:56,999
Well I guess you
can choose to be offended

1198
01:09:56,999 --> 01:09:58,999
by that comment.

1199
01:09:59,999 --> 01:10:00,999
Or you can see it
as a gesture of caring

1200
01:10:00,999 --> 01:10:04,999
that I don't want another
American to die out here.

1201
01:10:04,999 --> 01:10:08,999
Especially not
under my watch.

1202
01:10:08,999 --> 01:10:11,999
Thank you, then.

1203
01:10:16,999 --> 01:10:18,999
Hey.

1204
01:10:19,999 --> 01:10:21,999
Would you
put those away ?

1205
01:10:24,999 --> 01:10:26,999
That one, too.

1206
01:10:26,999 --> 01:10:28,999
Sorry.

1207
01:10:28,999 --> 01:10:30,999
Hey, check this out.

1208
01:10:34,999 --> 01:10:35,999
No question.

1209
01:10:35,999 --> 01:10:37,999
Seems like a
lot of extra effort.

1210
01:10:37,999 --> 01:10:38,999
Pays off.

1211
01:10:38,999 --> 01:10:41,999
I'm wearing DC's dog tags
to prove it.

1212
01:10:41,999 --> 01:10:44,999
So they slit the throats,
wire them up,

1213
01:10:44,999 --> 01:10:47,417
hoping to
draw in the opposition.

1214
01:10:47,999 --> 01:10:48,999
When the booby trap
doesn't work,

1215
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:51,999
they send in
the second string to eat them.

1216
01:10:51,999 --> 01:10:53,999
Sounds right.

1217
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,999
We must be getting close
to our objective.

1218
01:10:56,999 --> 01:10:58,999
We'll make the
final push at dawn.

1219
01:11:12,999 --> 01:11:15,999
Derek, what
are you doing here ?

1220
01:11:15,999 --> 01:11:17,999
What am I doing here ?

1221
01:11:17,999 --> 01:11:21,999
I'm doing what
needs to be done.

1222
01:11:21,999 --> 01:11:24,999
You need to come home.

1223
01:11:24,999 --> 01:11:26,999
No.

1224
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:29,999
Yeah, I thought about, for
weeks, what I was going to say

1225
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:33,999
to you when I found you and
I realized none of that

1226
01:11:33,999 --> 01:11:37,999
really matters
because you're stubborn

1227
01:11:37,999 --> 01:11:38,999
and no matter what
anyone says to you

1228
01:11:38,999 --> 01:11:42,999
it's never going to
change your mind.

1229
01:11:44,999 --> 01:11:47,999
Remember when we were kids,

1230
01:11:47,999 --> 01:11:51,999
and the weatherman spoke about
the wind chill factor ?

1231
01:11:51,999 --> 01:11:52,999
And you always thought

1232
01:11:52,999 --> 01:11:55,999
he was talking about the
wind chill factory ?

1233
01:11:57,999 --> 01:12:00,999
And you said it's always
colder in the wind chill factory

1234
01:12:00,999 --> 01:12:03,999
because it's in Alaska ?

1235
01:12:03,999 --> 01:12:05,999
It is always colder in
the wind chill factory.

1236
01:12:05,999 --> 01:12:07,999
No matter what anyone says to
you, you're never going

1237
01:12:07,999 --> 01:12:09,999
to change your mind.

1238
01:12:18,999 --> 01:12:19,999
If you don't want to
for yourself,

1239
01:12:19,999 --> 01:12:22,999
will you do it for me ?

1240
01:12:24,999 --> 01:12:27,999
If you care about me,
will you come home ?

1241
01:12:29,999 --> 01:12:34,999
Because I care
about you, I can't.

1242
01:12:47,999 --> 01:12:50,999
*

1243
01:13:05,999 --> 01:13:07,999
Are you okay ?

1244
01:13:10,999 --> 01:13:13,999
Are you ?

1245
01:13:28,999 --> 01:13:31,999
(laughing)

1246
01:13:51,999 --> 01:13:55,999
Dusty !

1247
01:14:01,999 --> 01:14:03,999
Run !

1248
01:14:50,999 --> 01:14:52,999
(Dusty)
If you saw Derek,
why didn't you stop him ?

1249
01:14:52,999 --> 01:14:53,999
(Joker)
I'm not his babysitter.

1250
01:14:53,999 --> 01:14:55,999
He's a grown man.

1251
01:14:55,999 --> 01:14:56,999
If he wants to get
eaten, he can get eaten.

1252
01:14:56,999 --> 01:14:57,999
I don't care if he doesn't
value his own life,

1253
01:14:57,999 --> 01:14:59,999
but he's going
to get us all killed.

1254
01:14:59,999 --> 01:15:01,999
No offense, Dusty, but
being this close

1255
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:02,999
he's probably already dead.

1256
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:04,999
And if not, there'll probably
be a ticker tape parade

1257
01:15:04,999 --> 01:15:06,999
waiting for us
when we get there.

1258
01:15:06,999 --> 01:15:08,999
Let's go.

1259
01:15:12,999 --> 01:15:14,999
I don't think he's dead.

1260
01:15:14,999 --> 01:15:17,542
Thanks.

1261
01:15:56,999 --> 01:15:58,999
It's the back door.

1262
01:16:07,999 --> 01:16:10,999
(speaking foreign language)

1263
01:16:17,999 --> 01:16:19,999
(gun clicks)

1264
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:23,999
(groans)

1265
01:16:27,999 --> 01:16:30,999
(grunting)

1266
01:16:52,999 --> 01:16:54,999
Thank you "Call of Duty."

1267
01:17:06,999 --> 01:17:09,999
(screaming)

1268
01:17:17,999 --> 01:17:20,999
*

1269
01:17:26,999 --> 01:17:28,999
(Dusty)
Wish my brother wasn't
so stubborn.

1270
01:17:28,999 --> 01:17:31,999
(Chapo)
You're confusing
stubborn with stupid.

1271
01:17:31,999 --> 01:17:33,999
(Tomboy)
Geez, Chapo do you
ever stop ?

1272
01:17:33,999 --> 01:17:34,999
(Joker)
Cut him some slack.

1273
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,999
He was never asked to
a dance in high school.

1274
01:17:37,999 --> 01:17:40,999
Still eats him up inside.

1275
01:17:40,999 --> 01:17:43,999
So what's eating
you, Tomboy ?

1276
01:17:43,999 --> 01:17:45,999
(Tomboy)
I'd kill for an hour
on the beach right now.

1277
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:47,999
Yeah ?

1278
01:17:47,999 --> 01:17:49,999
Do you like to rollerblade ?

1279
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:50,999
Never been.

1280
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,999
(Chapo)
I love rollerblading.

1281
01:17:52,999 --> 01:17:55,999
I used to go every
weekend back home.

1282
01:17:55,999 --> 01:17:59,999
You know what the hardest
thing about rollerblading is ?

1283
01:17:59,999 --> 01:18:02,999
Probably, uh,
learning how to stop.

1284
01:18:02,999 --> 01:18:05,999
It's telling your parents
you're gay.

1285
01:18:06,999 --> 01:18:07,999
*

1286
01:18:07,999 --> 01:18:09,999
(grunting)

1287
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:11,999
Stay or go ?

1288
01:18:11,999 --> 01:18:12,999
Stay or go ?

1289
01:18:12,999 --> 01:18:14,999
(Chapo)
We're running short
on time.

1290
01:18:14,999 --> 01:18:15,999
We got to get there
before the air strike.

1291
01:18:15,999 --> 01:18:16,999
Move out !

1292
01:18:21,999 --> 01:18:23,999
(shooting)

1293
01:18:25,999 --> 01:18:28,999
(shooting)

1294
01:18:40,999 --> 01:18:43,999
(screaming)

1295
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:34,999
(Chapo)
What do we got ?

1296
01:19:34,999 --> 01:19:36,209
Looks like someone
let the dogs out.

1297
01:19:36,999 --> 01:19:37,999
Derek's been here.

1298
01:19:37,999 --> 01:19:39,999
(screaming)

1299
01:19:42,999 --> 01:19:43,999
Stay tight.

1300
01:19:43,999 --> 01:19:44,999
Shoot anything
on two feet.

1301
01:19:44,999 --> 01:19:46,999
Joker, take Big Mama.

1302
01:19:46,999 --> 01:19:48,999
Thought you'd never ask.

1303
01:19:48,999 --> 01:19:50,999
I'm gonna flank the perimeter,
see if I can find an opening.

1304
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:51,999
Chip, not a good idea.

1305
01:19:51,999 --> 01:19:52,999
The sooner we secure the cave
the sooner we know exactly

1306
01:19:52,999 --> 01:19:53,999
what we're dealing with.

1307
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:55,999
I'll find a radio
and call HQ.

1308
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:57,999
It's a death sentence.

1309
01:19:57,999 --> 01:19:59,999
I knew that when
I enlisted.

1310
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,999
I'm coming too.

1311
01:20:00,999 --> 01:20:01,999
Like hell you are.

1312
01:20:01,999 --> 01:20:02,999
My brother
might be there.

1313
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:03,999
Along with everything else.

1314
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:04,999
I'm coming.

1315
01:20:07,999 --> 01:20:09,999
It's her life.

1316
01:20:09,999 --> 01:20:10,999
All right,
don't be long.

1317
01:20:10,999 --> 01:20:12,334
If our birds actually show up
we don't want to be

1318
01:20:12,999 --> 01:20:13,999
anywhere near this place.

1319
01:20:13,999 --> 01:20:15,999
I only need a few.

1320
01:20:15,999 --> 01:20:17,542
Stay close.

1321
01:20:17,999 --> 01:20:18,999
Let's give him some cover.

1322
01:20:18,999 --> 01:20:19,999
Wake up Big Mama.

1323
01:20:19,999 --> 01:20:21,999
She's awake.

1324
01:20:39,999 --> 01:20:41,999
I gotta
remember this room.

1325
01:21:23,999 --> 01:21:25,999
(Chip)
Watch your head.

1326
01:21:37,999 --> 01:21:39,999
*

1327
01:21:42,999 --> 01:21:43,999
Get them !

1328
01:21:45,999 --> 01:21:47,999
Get them !

1329
01:21:57,999 --> 01:21:59,999
(screaming)

1330
01:22:33,999 --> 01:22:34,999
(radio playing static)

1331
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:36,999
We're in business.

1332
01:23:06,999 --> 01:23:08,999
(whispering)
Dusty-- What are
you doing ?

1333
01:23:08,999 --> 01:23:10,999
That hat almost got
you killed, bro.

1334
01:23:10,999 --> 01:23:11,999
Come on, we've got
to get out of here.

1335
01:23:11,999 --> 01:23:13,999
I've called an air strike--
We have to leave now.

1336
01:23:13,999 --> 01:23:16,999
This is the end of the
cave as far as I can tell.

1337
01:23:16,999 --> 01:23:18,999
This is the last room.

1338
01:23:42,999 --> 01:23:46,999
(grunting)

1339
01:23:55,999 --> 01:23:57,999
I knew it.

1340
01:24:03,999 --> 01:24:05,999
We got to move.

1341
01:24:09,999 --> 01:24:11,999
We got to go now !

1342
01:24:21,999 --> 01:24:23,999
(Derek)
Oh I hate
being in the back !

1343
01:24:24,999 --> 01:24:26,999
Go, go !

1344
01:24:26,999 --> 01:24:28,999
I'm right behind you !

1345
01:24:41,999 --> 01:24:43,999
Tomboy, down !

1346
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:48,999
Joker !

1347
01:24:50,999 --> 01:24:51,999
Where's he hit ?

1348
01:24:51,999 --> 01:24:52,999
I don't know--
Looking for the entry.

1349
01:24:52,999 --> 01:24:54,999
Well get the vest off !

1350
01:25:25,999 --> 01:25:27,999
Just what
I need, right ?

1351
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:28,999
Another pie hole.

1352
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:29,999
Yeah, well
shut both of them.

1353
01:25:30,999 --> 01:25:31,999
Put pressure on it.

1354
01:25:31,999 --> 01:25:33,999
Put your hand here.

1355
01:25:36,999 --> 01:25:38,999
Stay with me, Joker.

1356
01:25:39,999 --> 01:25:41,999
I mean it.

1357
01:25:41,999 --> 01:25:43,999
I don't
have anything.

1358
01:25:47,999 --> 01:25:50,999
So, there's
a murderer, right ?

1359
01:25:50,999 --> 01:25:52,999
He's sitting in an
electric chair.

1360
01:25:52,999 --> 01:25:56,999
He's about to be executed.

1361
01:25:56,999 --> 01:25:59,999
"Any last requests ?"
asks the chaplain.

1362
01:26:02,999 --> 01:26:05,999
"Sure," says the murderer.

1363
01:26:08,999 --> 01:26:11,999
Will you hold my hand ?

1364
01:26:11,999 --> 01:26:15,999
(crying)
That was the worst
joke I've ever heard.

1365
01:26:21,999 --> 01:26:24,501
They're all bad.

1366
01:26:27,999 --> 01:26:29,999
I'm going to miss you.

1367
01:26:29,999 --> 01:26:32,999
I'm going to miss me, too.

1368
01:26:51,999 --> 01:26:52,999
Damn you !

1369
01:27:07,999 --> 01:27:08,999
Where's Derek ?

1370
01:27:08,999 --> 01:27:09,999
He was right
behind us.

1371
01:27:09,999 --> 01:27:10,999
We have to go
back and get him.

1372
01:27:10,999 --> 01:27:11,999
Dusty, there's no time.

1373
01:27:11,999 --> 01:27:13,999
The strike's coming now.

1374
01:27:16,999 --> 01:27:19,999
Just in time to blow
out the candles.

1375
01:27:53,999 --> 01:27:54,999
Die !

1376
01:27:54,999 --> 01:27:56,999
Die !

1377
01:28:09,999 --> 01:28:12,999
Who crapped their pants ?

1378
01:28:14,999 --> 01:28:17,999
(heavy breathing)

1379
01:28:31,999 --> 01:28:33,999
This is what
I've been waiting for.

1380
01:28:35,999 --> 01:28:36,999
Go back to hell
you son of a--

1381
01:28:42,999 --> 01:28:45,999
*

1382
01:28:49,999 --> 01:28:51,999
Bring in the rain-- we gotta
get out of here.

1383
01:28:54,999 --> 01:28:55,999
(Dusty)
Derek !

1384
01:28:55,999 --> 01:28:57,999
Derek !

1385
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,999
We've got to move.

1386
01:29:10,999 --> 01:29:12,584
 (man) 
 Target neutralized. 

1387
01:29:12,999 --> 01:29:14,999
 Pick up our boys 
 and bring them home. 

1388
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:31,999
Guys, we got a straggler.

1389
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:34,999
(Chapo)
Shoot it,
I'm too tired.

1390
01:29:40,999 --> 01:29:42,999
You have got
to be kidding me.

1391
01:29:42,999 --> 01:29:44,999
Derek ?

1392
01:29:44,999 --> 01:29:46,999
Derek !

1393
01:29:46,999 --> 01:29:48,999
Derek !

1394
01:29:50,999 --> 01:29:51,999
Oh !

1395
01:29:54,999 --> 01:29:55,999
It's over.

1396
01:29:55,999 --> 01:29:57,999
I got him.

1397
01:29:57,999 --> 01:29:59,999
You're so stupid !

1398
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:05,999
Was it worth it ?

1399
01:30:07,999 --> 01:30:08,999
Yeah.

1400
01:30:08,999 --> 01:30:09,999
Nothing left
of the bastard.

1401
01:30:09,999 --> 01:30:11,999
I got to say,
I'm kind of jealous.

1402
01:30:11,999 --> 01:30:12,999
Amen, brother.

1403
01:30:12,999 --> 01:30:14,999
The man who did the deed.

1404
01:30:28,999 --> 01:30:31,999
(Tomboy)
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm due for a leave.

1405
01:30:31,999 --> 01:30:34,999
(Chip)
Yeah, I could
use some time off.

1406
01:30:34,999 --> 01:30:36,999
What are you doing the next
couple of months ?

1407
01:30:36,999 --> 01:30:37,999
I'm available.

1408
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:39,999
(Dusty)
I'd go
to Alaska if you go.

1409
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:41,999
Alaska it is.

1410
01:30:41,999 --> 01:30:43,999
You might have to wear a shirt,
it's kind of cold out there.

1411
01:30:43,999 --> 01:30:46,999
Hey, well he isn't
coming with us, is he ?

1412
01:30:46,999 --> 01:30:47,999
I don't know.

1413
01:30:47,999 --> 01:30:48,999
Derek, do you want to go ?

1414
01:30:48,999 --> 01:30:51,999
Please no.

1415
01:30:51,999 --> 01:30:54,999
(Derek)
I wouldn't mind seeing the
wind chill factory up there.

1416
01:31:03,999 --> 01:31:07,999
