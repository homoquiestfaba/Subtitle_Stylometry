About anyone in particular?

82

Raul Montenegro. He's a

drug producers and the border cartels.

00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,093
Finance, mainly.

87
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,862
So he's a banker, a mob banker.

88
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,399
Exactly.

00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,603

about him, being a federal agent and all.

he stole from him, um...

103

104

Right, 26 bonds worth 500,000 each.

106

Sarah's informant
stole them from Cesar.

107
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:38,751
When he met up with Sarah, he panicked,
and he asked her to hide them.

108

- You know where the bonds are?
- GRACIE: No.

You know, what I don't understand,

110
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,759
why can't she just give back
the bonds and walk away?

111
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,495
If she's still alive it's
because she's holding out.

112
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:55,435

the bonds back, they'll kill her.

yourself as a campaign contribution.

You know, sometimes people, who may not
otherwise be happy or feel appreciated,

about what they know...

RAUL:
You know we want to take this legit.

158
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:40,692
I'm gonna take this whole
family out of the shadows.

159
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:45,331
And we are going to become
properly society people.

00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,705
GRACIE: That can't be true.

177
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:36,808
COLE:
I need you to jump in the back seat.

178
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,810
What?

179
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,546
Now, you need to get
in the back seat now.

180
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:44,549
- Get in the back seat now.
- You get in the back...

181
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,519
Oh, Jesus, who's...

182
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,756
- Cole.
- Dale.

183
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:53,992
Who's the chick, Cole?

184
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,394
GRACIE: Excuse me?

185
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:59,097
- Chick?
- Hold that.

186
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,232
She's cool.

187
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,502
DALE: Alright we got this geo-intel
from a drone late yesterday.

188
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,073
This is a drop point in Raul
Montenegro's trafficking network.

189
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:11,576
We think his son Cesar's been
using it for his own exploits.

190
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:14,245
Unbeknownst to daddy.

191
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,348
I've seen a lot of activity
the last 48 hours there.

192
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,918
Courier vehicles?

193
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:24,155
There was one vehicle that entered
under the loading dock last night.

194
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,596
Too small for a drop,

195
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:31,096
but just the right size for,
let's say, a hostage.

196
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:34,566
Do you have intel on
this particular building?

197
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,533
Yeah.

198
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,872
It's all there.

199
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,711
Hey look, if you think you
can do something about it...

200
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,280
the agency would love
to see it zeroed out.

201
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,184
He means destroyed.

202
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:56,723
You really think I'm going to
put my neck out for the agency?

203
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:01,393
All I want is to get the girl back.

204
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,697
You were suspended
for a reason, Cole.

205
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,266
Suspended?

206
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:12,270
DALE: You put a Mexican
intelligence officer in the hospital.

207
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,143
You made a bonehead call
and it bit you in your ass.

208
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:23,349
A little extracurricular activity could go
a long way in getting your badge back.

209
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,085
This isn't for the agency, is it?

210
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,987
COLE: They don't even
know you're here, right?

211
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:32,591
It's always about the agency.

212
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,762
Wait, you're considering this?

213
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:41,666
What are you going to do, fly into some
cartel stronghold and shoot it up?

214
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:46,071
It's not protected at night.
We walk in, we walk out.

215
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:50,676
Look, we're not going to
be able to talk her out.

216
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:56,617
You paying for this?
Scale, two operators?

217
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:01,451
We can loosen up some cash here.

218
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,027
COLE: Fine.

219
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:11,029
Good.

220
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,564
Make some calls, this needs
to happen right away.

221
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,440
DALE: Hey...

222
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:23,641
Hey, hey.

223
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,944
I want one of them donuts.

224
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,551
Hey don't you go shooting
anyone I know with that piece.

225
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,720
COLE: Fuck you too, Dale.

226
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:38,156
Invoice me.

227
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,824
Hey, I'm borrowing the van!

228
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:50,102
I'm gonna need a computer.

229
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,538
You know any internet
cafes around here?

230
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:57,340
Yeah let's go to my place,
it'll be a lot safer.

231
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,923
GRACIE: Bathroom's over there.

232
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:37,180
I gotta take a shower, I smell like
a hooker. You need anything?

233
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,586
COLE: Just gonna use your laptop.

234
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,620
Yeah, go ahead.

235
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,068
So you live alone?

236
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:02,708
GRACIE: Yeah, when I'm around,
travel a lot for work.

237
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,778
You travel with Sarah?

238
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:11,548
GRACIE: Yeah, articles had
taken her down to Colombia.

239
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:39,177
- Did you get the laptop?
- Yeah.

240
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,346
GRACIE: What's going on?

241
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:44,917
Nothing, it's fine everything's okay.

242
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:49,687
You mind if I make
myself some coffee?

243
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:53,056
Yeah, second cabinet.

244
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,725
You want me to heat that up for you?

245
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,073
I gotta get out of here.

246
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:18,243
And you get out of my email.

247
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,412
Where are you going?

248
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,948
COLE: Gotta meet the contractors.

249
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:28,854
- GRACIE: You mean like, mercenaries?
- Yeah, same thing.

250
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:32,290
Well what if something happens
to her? What if she dies?

251
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:35,892
I don't see we have any other
options in the time we have left.

252
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:42,932
- And you're not coming with me.
- Like hell I'm not.

253
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,876
- GRACIE: What is it?
- We've got company.

254
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,576
GRACIE: Shit.

255
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,419

Hey, it works.

262
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:16,921
GRACIE: What happened to your
multi-billion dollar DEA budget?

263
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:19,622
That van kept getting stolen.

- Everything okay at the border?
- FITZ: We're clean.

270
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:46,250
Okay, so listen you guys are
going to invoice me personally.

271
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,719
COLE: Money will become available
upon admittance to the DEA.

272
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,960
COLE: Okay, this is a
single mark extraction.

273
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:57,996
FITZ: Okay.

274
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:00,763
COLE: Let's talk operations.

275
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,332
You have to stay here.

276

GRACIE: Wait, wait...

277
00:35:37,456 --> 00:35:40,706
What am I supposed to do?
What if they come here?

278
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:43,040

- GRACIE: <i>We have company.</i>

285
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:50,301
There's four guys,
four guys on the loading dock.

Don't worry about it.

You're gonna get him to a medic?

I think we should split up.

Cole, this is not the way to do this.

You're never going to get
close to Cesar like this.

Stop it! Stop it!

not gonna bring her back.

326
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:37,315

bring down Montenegro.

COLE: To a census taker?

347
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,861
She made me coffee.

348
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:40,297
I did get an address.

349
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:44,701
It's a motel just out of town,
she said it's her son's.

350
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:47,770
Made me promise not to
give it to any bad guys.

351
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:58,914
Alright.

352
00:47:10,361 --> 00:47:12,697
It's right there.

353
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:17,166
You wait here, I'll check it out.

354
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,583
(GUN SHOT)

355
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,194
COLE: A friend of Sarah's,
I just want to talk!

356
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,533
I just want some information!

357
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:57,573
COLE:
Trying to find out where she is.

358
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,997
Hector...

359
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:07,343
it's me, Gracie.

360
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,665
GRACIE: Gracie...

361
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:13,855
the photographer.

362
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:17,260
How did you find me?

363
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,830
We found your mother.

364
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,400
How is she?

365
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:27,104
- Is she okay?
- She's okay, she's fine.

366
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:30,774
For now, but if we can
find her, anyone can.

367
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:33,977
- HECTOR: Put the gun down.
- GRACIE: (WHISPERING) Put the gun down.

368
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:36,047
HECTOR: Put it away!

369
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:39,381
GRACIE: Put it away.

370
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:48,126
He's okay.

371
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:51,693
GRACIE: We just wanna talk.

372
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:09,844
GRACIE: Relax, okay?

373
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,235
COLE: We're looking for
information on Sarah.

374
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:40,842
Did you hear what
happened to her husband?

375
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:45,148
Yeah, I did.

376
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,782
Poor bastard didn't have a chance.

377
00:49:54,058 --> 00:49:56,526
We think she could still be alive,

378
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:59,462
but we need to know how to find her.

379
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,930
I doubt that she's alive.

380
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:08,471
Do you know what she
was working on, exactly?

381
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:11,709
She was following the money.

382
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,143
Offshore money transfers.

383
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:21,784
Then came the bearer bonds,
and that's what derailed everything.

384
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:30,528
By the way, how is my mother?
Is she worried?

385
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,696
She's fine, she made me coffee.

386
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,270
(KNOCK)

387
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:14,771
Did you ever see any
of her informants?

388
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:17,107
No, I never met them.

389
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:20,610
She was religious about
protecting their identity.

390
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,746
How many were there?

391
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:27,285
HECTOR:
I don't know. They came, they left.

392
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:31,621
A recent one she called "the boy".

393
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:35,759
- She was very protective of him.
- Do you know how she contacted him?

394
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,229
Ya, she would text message him,
through this number.

395
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:52,908
We have to send a password
with it too, it was her idea.

396
00:51:57,415 --> 00:51:59,683
Well...

397
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,453
thank you very much.

398
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:07,723
- HECTOR: Sorry I shot at you.
- COLE: You're not the first.

399
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:13,163
- Want to go?
- GRACIE: Yeah, thank you.

400
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:15,332
- HECTOR: So, what do I do now?
- COLE: You're doing it.

401
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:19,807
- Just lay low and hopefully this'll go...
- (AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE)

402
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,618
Get to the bathroom,
keep your head down.

403
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:11,820
Check if they're dead.

404
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:37,366
Come on, we're going to
get the fuck out of here.

405
00:53:37,367 --> 00:53:40,849
- Just go to the car, okay?
- Okay, okay, let's go.

406
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:50,594
COLE: On three, straight to the car.

407
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,896
Two, three.

408
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:54,250
- Oh, god.
- You okay?

409
00:55:54,251 --> 00:55:57,087
GRACIE: Yeah, you?

410
00:55:57,488 --> 00:55:59,955
COLE: Yeah, still in one piece.

411
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,668
I need you to send that text now.

412
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:37,260
He's agreed to meet in
an hour, by the school.

413
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:40,996
- You know where that is?
- Yeah.

414
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:46,696
- <i>Está bien.</i>
- Okay.

415
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:48,763
GRACIE: <i>Gracias.</i>

416
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:20,096
Okay, so by "boy" she
actually meant boy.

417
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:22,964
He's the one that stole the bonds.

418
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:28,305
Did he know where she is?

419
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:33,376
GRACIE:
He's not sure. He's Raul's nephew.

420
00:58:33,377 --> 00:58:35,498
He was working for Cesar and...

421
00:58:35,499 --> 00:58:40,217
said there's been a lot of activity on his
uncle's property the past couple days.

422
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:43,386
That could be anything.

423
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:47,755
It's the best we got,
and it's recent.

424
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,430
What do you wanna do now?

425
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,668
I don't know yet.

426
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:07,911
We could go to the police.

427
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:12,680
Who can we trust?
Look what happened to Johnny.

428
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:18,454
I understand now why she
agreed to take the bonds.

429
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:21,058
COLE: She was protecting that boy.

430
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:25,095
GRACIE: You two ever have kids?

431
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:28,262
No, but not for lack of trying.

432
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:33,068
She really wanted a son.

433
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:42,946
GRACIE: I need some sleep.

434
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:46,080
Let's get out of here.

435
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,951
COLE: I'll uh...

436
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:27,590
I'll take the back seat.

437
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:29,691
GRACIE: Okay.

438
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:17,800
(KNOCKING)

439
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:21,638
DALE: This is how you lay low?
You shoot up a damn motel?

440
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:24,005
Let me in.

441
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:36,619
COLE: So how'd you find us?

442
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:39,088
We've had a tracer
on your car for days.

443
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:43,627
Would you mind not blowing off our
surveillance? Those guys aren't cheap.

444
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,994
That was you?

445
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:52,435
Who's the guy in
the black shirt, Dale?

446
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:55,137
DALE:
He's an enforcer, works for Raul.

447
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:58,175
He's trying to get to
Sarah through you.

448
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:03,246
He came to my house,
and he killed Hector.

449
01:03:03,847 --> 01:03:06,817
Yeah, you should probably move.

450
01:03:07,818 --> 01:03:12,189
DALE: Look, you've done your country
a great service, both of you.

451
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:15,324
Are you fucking serious?

452
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:18,996
I used that line,
I taught it to you, you muppet!

453
01:03:20,597 --> 01:03:23,497
Look, we got it from here, okay?

454
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,838
DALE: I'll let you know.

455
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:31,775
DALE: I know you talked to the boy.

456
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:34,575
You what?

457
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,687
Bugged my car too?

458
01:03:44,688 --> 01:03:48,258
For crying out loud Dale,
we're on the same side.

459
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:51,496
Wait, you've been listening?

460
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,301
Just to the good stuff.

461
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:02,672
Look, just go back
to laying low, man.

462
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:07,875
- I'll take care of the rest.
- Get the fuck out of my car, Dale.

463
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:37,106
So what do you know about Cesar?

464
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,909
What do you mean?

465
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:42,445
Did you and Sarah figure
out where he lives?

466
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:45,405
In plain sight.
He had expensive tastes...

467
01:04:45,406 --> 01:04:49,478
and I think he knows his <i>papi's</i>
not gonna kill his only son.

468
01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:54,924
He stays at The Grand.
Why, what are you thinking?

469
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:59,796
Well, if I was Cesar and I knew enough
to move Sarah in the first place,

470
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:04,467
then I think I'd be smart enough to
figure out the boy was the leak.

471
01:05:04,468 --> 01:05:08,638
If I could figure it out,
then somebody else can too.

472
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,642
Think we got fed false information?

473
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:16,546
I think the kid thought
it was true enough.

474
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:21,615
Yeah, but then how do we get to Cesar?
I mean, he has tons of guards around him.

475
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,459
No way.

476
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,726
Fine.

477
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,479
- (PUNCHING)
- (BODY DROPPING TO FLOOR)

478
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:15,325
Big smile, Cesar.

479
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:18,827
You have no idea who my dad is.

480
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:22,898
He's going to find you,
and he's going to kill you.

481
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:26,603
Oh, I think he's going to be a
little bit more agreeable than that.

482
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:31,641
And all that money you can't
even afford a breath mint?

483
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:34,041
GRACIE: Disgusting.

484
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:38,445
Mr. Montenegro.

485
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:44,218
- RAUL: What?
- This just came in.

486
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,498
Leave.

487
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:10,546
Now that didn't take long.

488
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:12,648
What do you want?

489
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:17,219
COLE: I think you know what I want.
The journalist, I want her back.

490
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:21,524
RAUL: I don't have her, Cesar does.

491
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,793
Well, I'll give you three options.

492
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:30,266
You can find out, I can beat
it out of Cesar for you,

493
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:35,504
or the next call that I make will be
to tell you where to pick up his body.

494
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:39,241
How am I supposed to
function as a businessman

495
01:09:39,242 --> 01:09:41,577
if people think that
they can steal from me?

496
01:09:41,578 --> 01:09:45,147
She didn't steal anything,
your own people did.

497
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:49,885
Anyway, a few million dollars is
the least of your worries right now.

498
01:09:49,886 --> 01:09:54,021
Because you, my friend,
are about to become childless.

499
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:05,501
Dad, dad, get me out of here!
These people are fucking crazy! Please!

500
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:10,771
CESAR: <i>Please, get me out of this.
These fuckers are crazy. Please!</i>

501
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:15,544
What do you propose?

502
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:19,114
COLE: We switch, Sarah for Cesar.

503
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:22,316
And then we both go
our own separate ways.

504
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:27,955
Where and when?

505
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:37,131
Atta boy, Cesar.

506
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,641
Get ready.

507
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:16,669
Stay there. Let's go.

508
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:25,413
Hold up!

509
01:11:28,585 --> 01:11:30,685
Come on, then.

510
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:45,033
CESAR:
You're a dead man. This is my town.

511
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:47,868
You're dead, motherfucker.

512
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,555
- (CRYING)
- MAN: Shut up!

513
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:12,627
MAN: Sit down!

514
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:28,075
You're free.

515
01:15:05,401 --> 01:15:08,102
Let's go, let's go.

516
01:15:58,121 --> 01:16:00,187
MAN: Come on!

517
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:58,145
COLE: Cesar!

518
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,419
COLE: Let her go.

519
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,655
COLE: You're all alone.

520
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:09,159
It's over.

521
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:14,598
COLE: It's over, let her go.

522
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:19,799
CESAR: It's not fucking
over 'til I say it's over!

523
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:17,285
There he is.

524
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:20,119
DALE: What's up, Rambo?

525
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:25,394
<i>Una cerveza, por favor.</i>

526
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:30,597
Fantastic. Good work, man.

527
01:19:32,735 --> 01:19:35,104
<i>Gracias.</i>

528
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:41,309
DALE: Hopefully the police get what they
need from Sarah's notes to indict Raul.

529
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:43,243
So it's all good?

530
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:49,484
Yeah, it's great.

531
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:52,285
Station chief says thank you.

532
01:19:54,323 --> 01:19:56,423
DALE: Oh, and...

533
01:20:00,997 --> 01:20:05,265
Welcome back buddy.
Ready to go catch some bad guys?

534
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:17,547
Wanna take a little time off first?

535
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:22,017
No, I'm all good.

536
01:20:22,018 --> 01:20:25,211
You lost your brother, man.
No one would blame you...

537
01:20:25,212 --> 01:20:29,427
for taking a little time off, Cole.
Get your head straight.

538
01:20:31,928 --> 01:20:34,864
I'd rather go right back to work.

539
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:37,565
Good.

540
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:40,267
(COUNTING)

541
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,146
This is a little light, man.

542
01:20:51,647 --> 01:20:55,301
I count twenty-four bonds,
that's two short.

543
01:20:56,318 --> 01:21:01,021
- Where's the other million dollars?
- I don't know, <i>amigo.</i>

544
01:21:04,093 --> 01:21:07,026
Where's the other
million dollars, Cole?

545
01:21:12,668 --> 01:21:15,837
Gotta chill out Dale,
drink your beer.

546
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:18,405
Life's good.

547
01:21:32,688 --> 01:21:36,935
So maybe when this all blows
over and you're back this way,

548
01:21:36,936 --> 01:21:41,098
- maybe I can give you a call.
- (GIGGLES)

549
01:21:43,099 --> 01:21:45,401
I'd like that.

550
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:49,304
How long do you think it'll be?

551
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:53,977
It's gonna be a while, so just follow
the news and you'll know when.

552
01:21:55,978 --> 01:21:58,078
Okay.

553
01:22:06,222 --> 01:22:09,324
You take care of yourself.

554
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:11,391
Later, man.

555
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:23,871
