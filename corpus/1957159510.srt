00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,280
Well, what about telegram or FedEx?

168
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,280
I wouldn't even know where to send it.

169
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,880
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait
and pray he calls.

170
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,760
Here I am reveling in
this epic NSYNC moment

171
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,240
when our entire family unit
is crumbling beneath us.

172
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,360
I can't believe this is happening.

173
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,000
There's no way Dad's found someone yet.

174
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,680
Doesn't matter if he did,
'cause he'll never make it back in time.

175
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,920
Clearly it's up to me to fix things.

176
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,960
-Why is it up to you?
-Because it's my fault.

177
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,360
I mean, Dad quit his job
to dedicate his time to racing...

178
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,920
Look, look, I told you already.
This is not your fault, okay?

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,480
Look, will you just admit it?

180
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,440
If it wasn't for me, you would be upstairs
right now packing for the first race.

181
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,600
Think I can do it?

182
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,720
-Do what?
-Race. For the cup.

183
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,000
Totally. Of course, there's a long list
of reasons why we'll never find out.

184
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,840
The main one being you're a chick.

185
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,000
You did not just call me a chick.

186
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,000
Sorry. Girl.

187
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,480
Look, guys would tear you up
if you went out and tried to race.

188
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,040
I mean, it doesn't matter
how good you are.

189
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,880
They'd do anything to beat you.

190
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,960
Yeah, but they'd have
to keep up with me first.

if you went out and tried to race
with a bunch of guys.

get things ready for when Dad gets home.

Okay, honey.
I've got errands to run anyway, so...

Andrea Rose,
do you need anything while we're in town?

Oh, all righty. Well, let's hurry then.

a second ago.

to get over here without them.

Uh... No. I don't need boots.
Just the parts.

in a minute to pay for them.

You know that? You're freaking me out.

286

What's wrong, Jimmy?

287
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,840
All right. First you don't have
your crutches, and then you do, all right?

288
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,760
Then you don't have the boots,
and now you want the boots.

289
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,320
You know what? I forgot something.
Can you save just these for me?

298
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,000
Whatever. Okay, your total,
it comes to $550.25.

How many parts did you order?

300
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,600

without the boots?

308
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,440

309
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,240

Not to mention if Dad finds out,
he's gonna ground us. You know that?

320

Neither one of them is gonna find out.
Are they, Jason?

321
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,320

when you say that?

just talking to?

-Mmm.

330

Not yet.
You know, part of me hopes he will,

331
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,680
and the other is praying he doesn't
so I don't have to break the news to him.

332
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,840
Um...

333
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,360
I'm going to go into town tomorrow

Yeah, I suppose.

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,760
-Can I go?
-No! You'll be bored.

337
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,280
I'll probably be gone before you wake up,
and I didn't want you to worry.

338
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,800
Mmm. Well, thanks for the consideration.

339
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,200
-(CHUCKLES)
-Uh...

340
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,960
By the way, honey, where were you today?
We missed you.

341
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,400
I was at the mall.

342
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,320
Hmm. Did you buy anything?

343
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,560
Some clothes.

344
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,960
ANDREW: Yeah. She's trying out a new-look.

345
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,200
-You should see it, Mom.
-Yeah. You'd hardly recognize her.

346
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,200
Okay. Somebody want to tell me
what's going on around here?

347
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,800
Nothing. Mom, everything's fine.

348
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,440
Well, you know I will find out eventually.
It's just a matter of time.

349
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,840
-(TIMER BEEPS)
-(SIGHING IN FRUSTRATION)

350
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,280
I don't know anything.

351
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,720
I promise.

352
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,880
Oh, Mom...

353
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,200
(ROOSTER CROWING)

354
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,440
I brought you those boots
that you said you didn't need.

355
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,840
Thanks.

356
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,040
Dude, I don't get you, man.
How are you gonna ride and stuff?

357
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,000
'Cause yesterday you were,
like, on crutches.

358
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,520
I think you were...
Weren't you? I don't know.

359
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,040
You're messing with my head.

360
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,640
-Just don't worry about it.
-Yeah?

361
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,920
I'm ready to ride,
and I really appreciate this, so...

362
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,720
Look, you've got
your driving glasses, right?

363
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,560
Yeah. Check them out, man.

364
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,840
You know, if I remember correctly,
the mall doesn't open till 10:00,

365
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,120
and I don't think
they let motorcycles inside.

366
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,200
Hey, Mrs. Carson. How you doing?

367
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,760
Jimmy. I'm sure that "Andrew"
appreciates everything,

368
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,320
but this is one race
he's not gonna be riding in.

369
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,320
Okay. Uh... That was weird.

370
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,240
We should probably
get your bike outta my truck,

371
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,200
'cause I got other places to go
if you're not going, man.

372
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,200
What's going on here?

373
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,960
(SIGHS) I cannot believe that you were
actually gonna go through with this.

374
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,200
Not to mention the fact
that you were gonna

375
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,120
get into a car with Jimmy Bottles.

376
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,880
He had his driving glasses.

377
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,080
Besides, I wasn't gonna
sit back and do nothing.

378
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,680
Mmm-hmm.
And just look at your beautiful hair.

379
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,480
Tell you one thing.
We're going over to the salon first thing

380
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,480
and see if there's anything
that they can do with it.

381
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,520
Now, go put the motorcycle
back in the garage.

382
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,880
Now do you know why I always look at you?

383
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,480
I'm sorry! I cracked.

384
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,560
You've seen her. I mean, she should
work for the CIA or something.

385
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,520
Mom, why won't you let Andi race?

386
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,080
Because girls don't race motorcycles.

387
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,600
Well, they do, but not with boys.
It's just not done.

388
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,160
But in school, they were teaching us
about women's rights.

389
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,840
And Mrs. Cabison was saying that

390
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,480
today there aren't any jobs
that women can't do.

391
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,200
You know, and how great it is
that we've come so far and everything.

392
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,040
So, I guess I don't understand
why Andi can't race.

393
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,400
I mean, she's as good
as those guys, right?

394
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,360
I don't want to talk about this.
Go upstairs, make your bed.

395
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,920
I already did.

396
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,560
Well, then, go upstairs
and put these clothes away,

397
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,680
neatly, in their proper place.

398
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,040
Oh, Geneva, don't even go there.

399
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,640
Just go back and fold your laundry
and think about something else.

400
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,400
Okay, explain something to me.

401
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,280
Is this all because you feel guilty
about what happened to your brother,

402
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,880
or is this something
you really want to do?

403
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,400
Which one will get you to let me go?

404
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,200
We're not even
talking about that right now.

405
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,800
I just want to know the truth.

406
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,080
Look, I really want to ride,
and I can win.

-Are you serious?
-Serious.

410
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,600
Yeah, if we go now.

411
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,400
Well, if we're gonna do this,
might as well do it right.

412
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,240
What made you change your mind?

413
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,480
Did you think I was gonna let you
save this family single-handedly,

414
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,960
and take all the glory?

that you broke the leg.

We'll do this later.

It's 20 minutes from now.
I better get going.

sooner or later.

Hi, sweetie. Did your dad call yet?

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,880

a good thing right about now.

you were doing your nails,

in my car, and I was...

I'm sure I'll be fine.

No possible way. Under no circumstances
am I gonna miss my boy's U.S. debut.

503
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,640

Go, honey! Go!

511
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,840

513

519
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,840
<i>And Barrett has finally caught Carson.</i>

520
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,360

<i>like he's a world champ or something.</i>

521
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,680

523

to beat all those guys

528
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,080
your very first time, did you?

529
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,280
Yeah, but I didn't think
I was gonna be in the way.

530
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,320
You finished the race.
That's all that matters.

531
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,800
Now, you do the same thing
in the next heat,

532
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,000
you've accomplished
what you came here for.

533

There she is!

534
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,120
I showed the other girls what you did,

535
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,000
and they were hoping
if you wouldn't mind...

536
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,600
I don't see why not.
Looks like a very long day ahead of us.

537

538

-Really?
-I was.

539
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,560
How sick is that, Dean? Look at that.

540
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,040
That guy shows up for one race,
which he gets smoked in, by the way,

541
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,400

swarming his rig.

What can I say?
I guess some guys are just magnets.

543
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,880
You need to chill on Faryn Henderson.

544
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,080
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

Um... Thanks.

621
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,480
So basically, you've got, like, enough
parts in here to build five spare bikes.

622
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,800
Yeah, basically.

623
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,600
Well, then why are you
even in the factory sponsorship?

624
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,120
Because factory sponsorship
equals factory support.

625
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,640
I mean, we get their expertise on
making the bikes go as fast as they can.

626
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,600
Shoot, they spend as much on this fork
as we do three bikes.

627
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,040

My sister wears it.
It smells a lot better on you, though.

638
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,320
Thanks.

639
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,760
You know better
than to bring the competition in here.

Don't worry about it, boss.
He's no competition.

641

You know, I better get going.
We got a gnarly drive home.

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,520
Yeah. Yeah.

Yo, Andy! Hold up, man.

644
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,880
Dude, I gotta cop to something.

645

You're madly in love with Faryn Henderson?

Is it that obvious?

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,440
Dude, you're toast. You're like Jell-O.

648
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,840
I know, man.
I want to go out with her so bad.

649
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,080
And?

650
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,360
And every time I see her, I just tank it.
You know?

651
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,520
It's like coming up on a triple, and then
just letting off, you know? Casing it.

-Thanks.

Look, if you're gonna
go compete with those guys,

657
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,920
there's some things you gotta know,
and I can teach you.

to do something for me.

You are a genius with women.

661
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,880
All you gotta do is get her to go out
with me one time. I'll do the rest.

662
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,640
(STAMMERS) I really would, but...

663
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,640
I don't even think I'm gonna be here
for the next couple of races.

664
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,760
What are you talking about?

665
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,800
Look, I really can't explain,
but it's like a freaky family thing.

666
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,720
Well, there's got to be some kind of way

667
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,000
that you could just,
you know, get her to...

668
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,520
Look, I can't... But, you know,
thanks for giving me the grand tour.

669
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,880
It was really cool.

670
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,480
Yeah.

671
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,720
Okay, I love you. Bye.

672
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,360
Well, I think
that's about the cutest boy ever.

673
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,520
If I wasn't the second cutest boy,
I might actually have a chance.

674
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,560
Was that Daddy?

675
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,800
It was indeed.

676
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,680
Well, did he find another rider?

677
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,800
Not yet.

678
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,840
You didn't tell him, did you?

679
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,840
Must have slipped my mind.
You know how forgetful I can be.

680
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,840
Honey, you really loved that
out there today, didn't you?

681
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,160
(SIGHS)

682
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,120
Yeah. Look, I know that
I can beat those guys.

683
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,880
I just wish
I didn't have to quit right now

684
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,360
so that I could find out for sure.

685
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,960
Well, young lady, I guess this is one
of those defining moments

686
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,400
-that they're always talking about.
-(GROANS)

687
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,960
Defining moments?

688
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,040
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, we all have one of those
in our lifetime.

689
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,360
Well, did you?

690
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,280
Sure. Yeah, I was just
a little bit older than you,

691
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,200
and I was singing in this band...

692
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,800
No way!

693
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,120
-Oh, way!
-(BOTH LAUGH)

694
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,120
Don't look so shocked.
I was actually kind of good.

695
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,840
And I loved singing just about as much
as you like riding that motorcycle.

696
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,440
Now, unfortunately, your grandmother

697
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,200
about had a heart attack
when she found out,

698
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,240
and she said if I quit right away,
she would never tell Grandpa.

699
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,280
-Well, what did you do?
-I quit right away.

700
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,160
And there hasn't been a day
where I haven't wondered about

701
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,040
whether I did the right thing.

702
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,520
Now, on one hand,
I did meet the man of my dreams

703
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,360
and have
the three best kids on this Earth,

704
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,760
but I still wish that I could have
at least given it a chance.

705
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,120
And I promised myself a long time ago

706
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,280
that I would never let my kids
give up on their dreams.

707
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,280
So what do you say? You up for it?

708
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,000
You and I...
Carson Racing against the world.

709
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,720
Or at least
against the rest of the Southwest.

711
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,760
-You're serious?
-Absolutely.

712
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,080
Now, honey, I have been
doing a little reading here,

713
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,200
and if we're gonna win this cup,

714
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,760
you're gonna have
to start getting some points.

715
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,880
Don't worry.
I know how to make sure that we do.

716
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,960
-I'll do it.
-Do what?

717
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,720
You got a deal.
You hook me up on the track,

718
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,400
and I'll hook you up with Faryn.

719
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,200
All right.

720
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,200

Here it is.

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,760
Now, Carson, you know how to make turns
and how to jump,

734
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,280
but what you don't know how to do
is retrain.

735
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,760
You know, all the different surfaces.

736
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,600
Out here, you learn all that,
so when you get on the track,

737

no matter what, you're ready.

just to look at it.

how great Andrew is at riding?

Well, that's how bad he is at cooking.

just do whatever you can
to help your brother out, okay?

on the Learning Channel

about shopping euphoria,
or maybe it was shoplifting. I don't know.

Why not?

than a guy who never changes
out of motocross tee-shirts and jeans

and spends every waking moment
thinking of loopholes and knickknacks.

then I don't have to bum him out
about Faryn.

802

So if he comes by,
just tell him that I'm not here, okay?

00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,320
Where would you like me to say you are?

804

I don't know. Just tell him that I went
for doughnuts or something, okay?

Well, hello there, Dean.
We were actually just talking

808
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,200
about how thankful Andy is for you
taking time with him yesterday.

809
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,360
I had a great time, too, Mrs. Carson.

Tell you what?

Oh, come on, dude.
Just tell me what happened.

She's not into it.
She's looking for something different.

821
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,200
I don't get it.
Like, what's she looking for?

822
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,280
Basically, as far as I can tell,
she's looking for a guy

who drives an expensive foreign car

of the galleria.

01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,240
Dad, I just don't understand
what is so wrong about it.

989
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,960
It's wrong
because I asked you not to do it.

990
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,200
I stood right here, I said,
"Stay away from motorcycles."

991
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,040
-But, we...
-Especially after what happened to Andrew.

992
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,240
You think I want you getting hurt
like that or worse?

993
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,400
But, Dad, she podiumed in a pro race.
I mean, don't you think that's awesome?

994
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,240
Of course it is, but what do you think
is gonna happen when they find out

995
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,160
she's not only not Andrew Carson,
she's his sister?

996
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,200
They're gonna take
all those points you racked up away.

997
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,560
I will be the laughingstock
of the entire racing community.

998
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,400
But, Dad, nobody is gonna find out.

999
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,680
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

1000
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,600
I'll never understand
what you were thinking,

1001
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,760
aiding and abetting
in Andrea's little racing caper.

1002
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,720
I don't know. It just seemed like
a good idea at the time.

1003
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,800
In fact, part of me still thinks
it was a good idea.

1004
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,640
Please, tell me you don't mean that.

1005
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,760
Edward, honey, you have all these reasons
why she shouldn't race.

1006
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,760
"There's too much at stake.
She is just a girl."

1007
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,000
Well, the truth of the matter is,
she is just as good as any of those boys,

1008
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,720
and as far as her getting hurt,

1009
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,240
well, if you're willing to allow Andrew
to take that risk,

1010
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,800
don't you think it's a bit hypocritical

1011
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,800
that you're not also willing
to do the same thing for Andrea?

1012
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,280
Hmm?

1013
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,000
I love you, honey. Don't stay up too late.
Big day tomorrow.

1014
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,160
Do you think I'm hypocritical?

1015
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,160
If that's a good thing, then yeah,
but if it's a bad thing, then no way.

1016
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,920
Yeah.

1022

I don't know. Some sales guy,
but he completely grossed me out.

<i>Monsieur</i> Carson,
it's good to see you again.

1027
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:02,640
Welcome, welcome, welcome. Come in.
Let's see if we can find the family.

1028
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,120
Andrew? Jason? Right in here. Here.

1029
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,880
Kids, this is Rene Cartier.

1030
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,560
He's going to be our new rider
for the rest of the series.

1031
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,160
And you must be Andrew.
It's a shame about the leg.

1032
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,280
Motocross can be a very dangerous sport,
you know.

01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:25,080
-Oh, honey. Honey. And this is my wife.
-Ah. <i>Madame</i> Carson.

1035
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,320
I can't tell you how I am looking forward
to all of us working together.

1036
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,160
Right. Right. Let's give you
the grand tour of the house, shall we?

1037
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,480
We'll start with the garage.
It's no factory shop,

1038
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,800
but I think you'd be surprised.

1039
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,480
Is that guy for real?

1040
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,480
Cartier. The name sounds really familiar.

1041
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,120
Yeah. I think I read about him, like,

1042
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,840
on the Internet
or in a magazine article or something.

1043
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,040
Look. All I have to say...
If that guy kisses my hand again,

1044
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,800
there's gonna be a WWF smackdown
in the Carson house.

1045
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,400
GENEVA: Jason, that's enough riding
for today. You've got chores to do.

1046
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,080
I hope you don't mind.

1047
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,640
I need to sleep in a west-facing room
so the sun does not wake me.

1048
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,000
I'm gonna need
just the right amount of rest

1049
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,160
if I'm gonna compete at optimum level.

1050
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,080
Why don't you go sleep in the garage?
There's never any sun there.

1051
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,360
Andrea, can I see you for a minute?

1052
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,160
Dad, you told him that's okay?
That's my room!

1053
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,840
Honey, look. Look.
Put yourself in his position.

1054
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,000
He's a long way from home.
He doesn't know anybody.

1055
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,400
It's gonna take us a while
to get used to each other.

1056
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,760
Please, just do this for me. Please. Huh?

1057
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,160
What's going on?

1058
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,920

how long this is gonna take?

You can time me.

I'd rather you do it, Andrew.

than I am.

the foot pegs.

bright and early.

actually misses him?

What was that for?

1083
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,000
For everything. For this week.
For believing that I could do it.

1084
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,080
We did make a pretty good team, didn't we?

-The best.
-Yeah.

it could win a mini-bike race.

-How's he doing?
-He's over-revving it.

1091

I told him to take it easy
till we got the motor broken in.

1092
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,600
He's gonna blow the top end.
I can feel it.

An old injury flared up,
but we got a new guy to fill in.

1148
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,320
Yeah, yeah, I heard about him.
He's kind of a whack job. Huh?

1149
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,760
Yeah, tell me. We got him living with us.

1150
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,160
Ouch.

1151
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,080
By the way, this is my sister Andrea.
This is Dean, and this is...

1152
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,200
It's Faryn. Hi.
I've heard a lot about you.

1153
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,160
-Hi.
-Hi. I'm Dean.

1154
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,480
-Hi.
-Pleased to meet you.

1155
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,360
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Yeah. It's just...

1156
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:35,520
-You guys look so much alike.
-We are twins.

1157
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:42,000
Honey, I think we need to go back
to the trailer. You know how Daddy gets.

1158
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,640
DEAN: Yeah. I do.

1159
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:50,080
Well, hey, it was nice meeting you.
And, you, good luck out there, bro.

1160
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,680
Sorry. If you were riding,
you'd have won.

1161
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,640
-Thanks, man.
-Yeah. Bye.

1162
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,400
This is way too bizarre.

1163
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:05,280
Actually, I thought it went pretty well.
This is kind of fun.

1164
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,800
Maybe I should pretend to be you
being me all day.

1165
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,840
Well, we don't exactly have a choice now,
do we?

1166
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,040
COMMENTATOR:
<i>Well, Barrett is still in the lead,</i>

1167
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:15,600
<i>but the replacement rider</i>
<i>for Carson Racing, Rene Cartier,</i>

1168
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,880
<i>is living up</i>
<i>to his body-banging reputation.</i>

1169
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,520
<i>He is so close,</i>
<i>pressuring Barrett at every corner.</i>

1170
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,400
<i>They are heading</i>
<i>into the final few moments of the moto,</i>

1171
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,960
<i>and here comes Cartier.</i>
<i>Dives in front of Barrett. Nothing to it.</i>

1172
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,560
<i>Now Cartier goes speeding by.</i>
<i>Barrett looks over his shoulder.</i>

1173
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:34,960
<i>Here comes Cartier. He is ready</i>
<i>to make a move on the outside,</i>

1174
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,760
<i>and Barrett looks over his shoulder</i>
<i>at Cartier. Here they come into the turn.</i>

1175
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,040
<i>Cartier looks back at him.</i>
<i>Cartier bumps him in twice.</i>

1176
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,680
<i>He's knocked Donny Barrett down.</i>

1177
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,520
<i>Cartier, living up to his reputation</i>
<i>as a body-slammer.</i>

1178
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,160
<i>He'll take the checkers and the win.</i>

1179
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:57,200
Well, guess I better go
pull the top end out of the practice bike,

1180
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,280
seeing as he's fried all the other ones.

1181
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,960
Rene, congratulations on the win.

1182
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,760
You really slammed the door
on Barrett there at the end of the race,

1183
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,240
but now you're a replacement rider
on Team Carson,

1184
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,520
what can you tell me
about the injured Andrew Carson?

1185
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,240
That kid, a rookie,
but really showing us some potential.

1186
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:17,400
Well, you know, I don't really know
anything about his injury.

1187
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:22,200
I guess all I can say is, it's old news,
so let's stick to the subject.

1188
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,440
Now, I got a great start today,

1189
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,560
and I think I really proved
to the Carson team

1190
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,480
how lucky they are
to have a rider like me.

1191
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,600
Yeah, but it feels
like it's got no top end, man.

1192
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,480
I mean, I'm still getting beat
in the straightaways.

1193
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,120
Hey, dude, I don't know what to tell you.

1194
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,960
How's Barrett?

1195
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,760
He's pretty tweaked.

1196
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,080
I don't think
he's gonna race the second heat.

1197
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,760
You ever thought
about putting the stock pipe back on?

1198
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,080
Well, I mean,
this track is mostly straight,

1199
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,640
so this aftermarket pipe
has great bottom,

1200
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,440
but you don't really have to worry
about that here.

1201
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,280
Just make sure you change the jets.

1202
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,640
That's not a bad idea.

1203
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,800
That's pretty amazing.
(CLEARS THROAT)

1204
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,000
You know, how you knew
about the bike like that.

1205
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,160
Yeah, well, I grew up around racing.

1206
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,000
Yeah. So did my girlfriend,

1207
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,560
but she doesn't know
a head pipe from a brake pad.

1208
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,040
I'll definitely be talking to you soon,
<i>Monsieur</i> Henderson.

1209
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,000
Yeah. Well, I hope that works out for you.

1210
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,600
Thanks. Bye.

1211
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,880
Dean. Dean, what are you staring at?

1212
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,280
I feel like I know her somehow.

1213
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,960
What were you talking
to Art Henderson about?

1214
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,160
-Don't walk away from me.
-Please take your hands off of me.

1215
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,640
What were you
in the Hendersons' trailer for?

1216
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,800
It's none of your business. Now back off.

1217
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,200
Look, okay, I'm not gonna back off.

1218
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,480
You may have my father fooled,
but I know exactly what you're about,

1219
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,920
so once again, I'm gonna ask you...

1220
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,040
What's going on?

1221
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,880
I caught him in the Hendersons' trailer.

1222
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,320
It looked like they were making
some kind of deal.

1223
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,040
I just thought it might be nice to see
how a real team operates,

1224
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,920
so he was showing me around their trailer.
That's all.

1225
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,760
Oh, please. You are so making that up.

1226
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,600
I know for a fact
that Art Henderson doesn't do that.

1227
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:10,800
Andrea, we have no reason to believe
Rene is lying about something like that.

1228
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:11,960
RENE: Of course you don't,

1229
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,480
and I resent being treated
like some sort of a criminal.

1230
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,120
He's a snake, Dad,
and I was just trying to help.

1231
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,480
-If you want to help, go apologize to him.
-Apologize?

1232
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,160
Honey, we need him to focus.

1233
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,840
He's never gonna be able to
if he's all worked up like this.

1234
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,040
I'll see you back at the truck.

1235
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,640
(SCOFFS)

1236
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,080
Aren't you the one who always said

1237
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,960
that if something barks like a dog
and scratches like a dog,

1238
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,480
it probably has fleas like a dog?

1239
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,800
Well, that boy is one big spoiled puppy
if you ask me.

1240
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,000
I'll fully back you up on that, Mom.

1241
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:58,440
Jason, why don't you check and see
if the gas is mixed for the next race?

1242
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,080
Man, I never get any respect.

1243
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,000
Edward, I love you,
and I will stand by you

1244
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,280
until the world comes to an end,
which it may very well do today,

1245
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,360
but you are making a gigantic mistake.

1246
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,480
Geneva, do you really want to get
into this right now?

1247
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:23,280
Okay, look. If somebody asked you
to describe your daughter,

1248
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,400
what would you say?

1249
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,120
Well, she's beautiful and smart.

1250
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,960
She gets along with just about everybody.

1251
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,160
"She gets along with
just about everybody."

1252
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:35,720
Hmm.

1253
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,160
If you won't listen to us, will you listen
to what you just said yourself?

1254
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,720
(SIGHS)

1255
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:57,720
-Don't feel bad, Dad.
-Yeah. She broke me, too.

1256
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,040
Look, all I'm trying to do
is help my family out, okay?

1257
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,920
Your family? Your family is a joke.

1258
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,560
Now, I am warning you for the last time,
stay out of my face.

1259
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,240
-Hey. Hey. You okay?
-Dad, I'm just trying to apologize.

1260
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,640
Wait here. Wait here. Hey, Cartier.

1261
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,920
Look, I'm sorry,
but I cannot accept her apology.

1262
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,600
Yeah? Well, that's okay,
because it's been withdrawn.

1263
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,920
By the way, you are fired.

1264
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,720
Dad, I was a jerk.

1265
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:40,840
No, you weren't. You were trying to help.
You were doing a great job, by the way.

1266
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,960
-Really?
-Really.

1267
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:49,040
You know, no matter what you might think,
when your mom and I were married

1268
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,800
and we started thinking about kids,
I always prayed for a girl.

1269
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,960
-You did?
-Yep.

1270
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,760
-I always thought that because...
-Of the racing and everything?

1271
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:06,000
-Well, yeah.
-Well, it was pretty much the opposite.

1272
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,600
When I was racing and I got hurt,
and I saw a lot of my friends get hurt,

1273
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,520
I swore I'd never let my kids
go through that,

1274
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,600
and I thought if we had a girl,
that'd never be a problem.

1275
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,080
-And then me came along.
-Yeah, you did.

1276
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,280
Funny thing is, when you have kids,
no matter what you'd hoped for,

1277
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,400
you're just so happy they're there
and that they're healthy,

1278
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,840
you forget everything else.

1279
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,320
I guess I always held on to the hope
that you'd be the one that'd be spared

1280
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,800
any of the pain or disappointment
that comes with this.

1281
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,200
Dad, but that's part of it.
I mean, if it wasn't for the bad stuff,

1282
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,920
it wouldn't make winning so great.

1283
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,880
You know, I never thought I'd say this,
but if it wasn't for you and your mother,

1284
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,000
there's no way Carson Racing
would have gotten this far.

1285
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,640
I'm very proud of you.

1286
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:55,040
I just wish that I could change
what happened to Andrew, Dad.

1287
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,400
I wish that it was me.

1288
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:01,280
Don't even think that.
You're our only hope. We need you healthy.

1289
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,440
-Are we ready to go racing?
-Mom told me you fired Rene.

1290
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,240
-Everything's almost loaded.
-Well, let's unload it.

1291
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,600
There's still one Carson left
who can bring this thing home.

1292
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,880
Yeah!

1293
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,640
Oh, shoot. I took the top end
out of the practice bike,

1294
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,800
and I haven't put it back
in the race bike yet.

1295
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,680
We won't have time now.

1296
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,560
Oh, how quickly you all give up.

1297
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,200
And he does it!

1298
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,600
(ALL CHEERING)

1299
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,400
Little brother, you rock!

1300
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,560
Hey, show them
what real speed's all about, okay?

1301
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,760
Remember, don't take your helmet off
when they interview you on the podium.

1302
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,600
Well, if I'm being you,
who are you gonna be?

1303
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:46,080
Me? I'm just gonna be

Let's just say we got rid of some trash

1311
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,840
and things are smelling a lot better
around our rig.

1312
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,320
Yeah. It got dumped on our front lawn.

1313
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,680
Hey, so, I wanted to ask you
about your sister.

1314
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:14,800
What about her?

1315
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,920
Is she, like, dating anybody?

1316
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,680
You know, because if she isn't,
I was just wondering...

1317
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:21,240
Dude, you have a girlfriend, okay?
Remember?

1318
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,320
Man, we realized
we don't have anything in common.

1319
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,040
Besides, I think she has something
for French guys, anyway.

1320
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,720
So, what about it, huh?

1321
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:31,120
I'll talk to her.
She is pretty picky, though.

1322
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,840
Dude, come on. We're bros. Hook me up.

1323
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,400
Tell you what. I'll think about it,

1324
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:38,000

some kind of deal.

Obviously, the guy took one to the head.

then who's that right there?

Andi. Andrea Carson.

01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:16,120

there was something weird about that kid.

So, if you're...

1388
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,160
You made me believe
that you were a guy this whole time.

1389

Look, I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you.

she was just helping out our family.

1392

I trusted you. I mean, I told you stuff.

1393
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:35,960
She should be disqualified.
It's a joke. She's a girl.

1394
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:37,760
There's got to be something
in the rulebook about this.

No, there's nothing.
I just read the rulebook again.

1396
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,800
There's not one thing
that says a girl can't race.

1397
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:48,360
What about having an unregistered rider
racing for you? What's it say about that?

01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:53,680
She registered Andi Carson.
This is Andrea Carson, Andi for short.

1400
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,240
to be the first female to win
a major motocross event?

1401
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,320
Amazing. It was a family win, though.

1402
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,520
I mean, my dad and my brother
put together my bike,

1403
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,000
and my mom ran my pit,

1404
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:08,760
and my little brother Jason
did a full top-end rebuild between races.

1405
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,160
So you think the factory's gonna stand

1406
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,080

and give you the full sponsorship?

I'm Barbara Rollins,
Senior Vice President in charge of racing.

01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,960
Andi gonna be a full factory-sponsored

After everything this young woman did?

1415
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,000
The way she masqueraded as her brother,
kept her identity a secret?

1416
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,480
After what she went through,

1417
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,520
a woman who came out on top
in a man's sport,

1418
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,920
you think we'd let her sign
with anyone but us?

1419
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,640
And I'll do you one better.

1420
