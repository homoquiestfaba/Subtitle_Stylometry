00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,376
So who will
start the bidding?

3
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,148
No Bids?

4
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,158
Surely she can work
in your fields.

5
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,919
(Auctioneer)
Anyone?

6
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,521
(Auctioneer)
Anyone?

7
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:12,932
Let me see this
for a second.

8
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:13,830
Hey, I'm playing.

9
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:14,530
Alright, ladies
and gentlemen,

10
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,164
we've got a state-of-the-art
technological achievement

11
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,536
of the 21 st century.

12
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:17,506
Who'll give me
five bucks for this?

13
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,542
Who will give me five? Five?
Who'll give me five?

14
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,303
I'll give you two.

15
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,435
Great, we have a bidder!

16
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,945
I've got two, but I'm looking for five,
who will give me five?

17
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,340
What about you
beautiful young lady?

18
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,438
Well, if you
put it that way.

19
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,610
I'll give you five
if you don't give it back to me.

20
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,416
Going once.
Going twice.

21
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,423
Sold back to the original owner
for five dollars. Congratulations.

22
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,959
Next on the menu we have
Carrie's sleeping bag for $2.50...

23
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,429
Hello.

24
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,193
Miss Helen, come on in.

25
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,462
Well, we're here
Brother Stuart.

26
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,697
You got her to come?

27
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,433
It was a struggle
but she finally agreed.

28
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,669
Good, good it's going
to be a great trip, I'm so glad.

29
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,679
Sometimes I don't know
what to do with her.

30
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,737
Well, teenagers.

31
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,684
And just before we left her mother
called making all kinds of promises

32
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,211
about how she was going to come
and take her with her again.

33
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,622
Wow, that makes it hard.

34
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,956
I feel so sorry for her.

35
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,361
Deep down inside
she is a sweet girl.

36
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,456
I hope she cooperates for you.

37
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,831
I'm sure she will.

38
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,927
Ashley,
it's good to see you again,

39
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,438
I'm glad you're coming
camping with us.

40
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,235
Not my choice.

41
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,272
Don't you worry about a thing,
alright, Miss Helen,

42
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,744
we're going to take
good care of her.

43
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,007
Thank you.

44
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,407
Have fun sweetheart.

45
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,918
Unlikely.

46
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,749
Hey guys.
ready I09°?

47
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,620
Where are all the kids?

48
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,284
This is us.

49
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,453
But there are 30 kids
in our youth group.

50
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,292
30 in the youth group,
10 who signed up,

51
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,958
6 had to cancel at the last minute
so this is all of us.

52
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,298
Well, this isn't
going to be any fun.

53
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,303
I don't want to go
if I'm the only girl.

54
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,702
Well as it turns out
you're not the only girl

55
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,967
we actually have Ashley
coming with us.

56
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,633
Ashley,
you remember Carrie?

57
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:58,607
Hi.

58
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,905
And we have Cooper.

59
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,036
<i>Call me Coop.</i>

60
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,006
Steve.

61
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,642
And lastly
we have Gameboy.

62
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,550
(Stuart) And here right on time
is my beautiful wife, hi honey.

63
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,518
Hey.

64
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,851
(Stuart) Guess what?
We have Ashley coming with us.

65
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,858
Oh, fantastic!
Ashley good to see you, I'm Beth.

66
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,359
Have you been camping before?

67
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,588
No.

68
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,958
Neither have I,
but I'm sure it'll be fun.

69
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,759
Plus, the cabins
are supposed to have

70
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,458
air conditioners and whatnot.

71
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,899
What's he talking about,
there aren't any cabins.

72
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:24,991
Steve!

73
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,662
Honey, do you have
everything you need?

74
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:27,898
You know what,
I have to run to the office

75
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,633
if you don't mind
getting everybody loaded up.

76
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,539
I'll be down in a sec.

77
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,339
Ashley, why don't you come
with me to the van, I'll get your bag.

78
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:34,969
Okay.

79
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,646
Look at her bags.

80
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,448
We're only going to be gone
for two days.

81
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,456
What? She's never been camping
before so she over packed.

82
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,992
Hey Steve,
are there going to be bugs?

83
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,994
<i>Yeah Coop, we're camping in
the woods there's going to be bugs.</i>

84
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,723
I hate bugs.

85
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,459
We're not even there yet
and she's already doing her nails.

86
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,330
Bugs bite.

87
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,427
You can borrow
my bug spray, Coop.

88
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,937
- (Coop) 'Thanks, man.
- No problem.

89
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,737
- I know what you're thinking.
- What?

90
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,710
She's out of your league.

91
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,476
Carrie's right.
She only dates guys with "money".

92
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,107
How do you know?

93
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,011
I know what I know.

94
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,849
Are they big bugs'?

95
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,855
Yes. Big enough
to bite your head off!

96
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,618
You don't know that.

97
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,354
Ashley only dates guys
that can buy her lots of "stuff."

98
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,861
(Carrie)
And you're not rich enough.

99
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,590
There's more to life
than money.

100
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,359
I'm just saying
I think she's out of your league.

101
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,128
It's not like
I'm going to date her.

102
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,869
Then what?

103
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,598
I think she just needs a friend,
that's all.

104
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,033
Carrie, Do you think one can
of bug spray will do it?

105
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:40,941
Do what?

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,070
Keep the big bugs away.

107
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:42,840
Cooper!

108
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,642
What?

109
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,610
Let's go everybody,
load up,

110
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,620
the bags aren't going
to pack themselves

111
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:55,676
[music]

112
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:46,461
[music]

113
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,990
Alright everybody
let's get out and check around --

114
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,792
this is going to be your home
for the next two nights.

115
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,598
- Is this it?
- This is it.

116
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,001
Where are the cabins?

117
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,165
There's no cabins, Coop.
This is wilderness living.

118
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,608
No cabins? But Carrie said
there would be cabins.

119
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,612
Why do you think they asked us
to bring our own sleeping bags?

120
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,740
You mean we actually have to sleep
on the ground, with the bugs?

121
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,149
Oh wait, you know what?
We might not even have tents.

122
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,153
No tents!
What if it rains?

123
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,746
Don't worry Coop,
we brought tents.

124
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,021
<i>You know what Stuart?
I like it, looks good.</i>

125
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,925
What about snakes?
Any snakes up here?

126
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,930
No, I don't think we get snakes
this time of year.

127
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,659
That's a relief.

128
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,995
At least I don't think so.

129
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,626
Hey Ashley, we're only going
to be here for this weekend,

130
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,763
do you really need
all that luggage?

131
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,603
I couldn't decide
what to wear.

132
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,009
(sarcastically)
"I couldn't decide what to wear."

133
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,877
Come on, be nice,
she's just different.

134
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,507
It doesn't make her
a bad person.

135
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,281
No, but the fact that she's stuck up,
spoiled and self-involved does.

136
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,285
Guys! Guys!
Is there something on me?

137
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,820
No!

138
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,915
'Thought I felt something.

139
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,027
He's a funny kid.

140
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,758
Well, we're back.

141
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,733
Yeah. We love this place,
don't we?

142
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,133
Yep, we sure do.

143
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,897
Something good
always happens up here.

144
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,841
Alright everybody let's go,
grab your tents.

145
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:30,898
[music]

146
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,900
Gameboy,
what are you doing?

147
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,905
What? I'm making
another hot dog.

148
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,201
That's like your third one.

149
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,866
It's my fourth.

150
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:32,909
You cook a mean
hot dog, Stuart.

151
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,638
Thank you very much,
Gameboy.

152
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,146
It's the only thing I learned
to do right at culinary school.

153
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,910
What kind of school?

154
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,009
Culinary... you know, cooking.

155
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:45,146
<i>You went to a school to learn
how to cook hot dogs?</i>

156
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,020
[laughter]
No Coop.

157
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,958
Stuart's kidding but that's
what culinary school is.

158
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,326
A school where you learn
how to cook hot dogs?

159
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,386
[laughter]

160
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,290
What's so funny?

161
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:58,358
<i>It's a school where you learn
to cook, not just hot dogs.</i>

162
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,665
Man, you don't
know anything.

163
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,830
I didn't know.

164
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,841
It's okay Coop.
We learn something new everyday.

165
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,968
I actually wanted
to study hamburgers

166
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,343
but you had to go
an extra year to do that.

167
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:14,402
[music]

168
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,929
My family and I
camp out like this a lot.

169
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,799
This will be a fun weekend,
you'll see.

170
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,338
Look, I don't really want to talk
to anybody, okay?

171
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,341
I mean, no offense,
but I hate it out here

172
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,344
and I'm just trying to get
through this as quick as possible.

173
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,438
Okay.
I Understand.

174
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,684
Appreciate it.

175
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,186
Alright, since we're
all gathered around

176
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,816
let's take a moment to get
to know one another a little better.

177
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,191
Alright. I want to ask
everybody a few questions.

178
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,821
Is this going to be one of those
dumb games, Stuart?

179
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,093
No, this isn't "going to be
one of those dumb games, Stuart."

180
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:07,035
Think of it as an experiment
and everyone has to answer.

181
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,130
So, here is the question.

182
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,971
What is your favorite book
in the Bible?

183
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,375
<i>Coop, you go first.</i>

184
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,175
My favorite book.
How about the Gospel of John.

185
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:21,048
Gospel of John.
Carrie?

186
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,984
Do I have to?

187
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,046
Yes, you have to,
come on.

188
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,353
Um, Matthew

189
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,791
(Stuart) Steve,
how about you?

190
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,328
Romans.

191
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,057
Romans, good.
Gameboy?

192
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,895
I prefer Amos.

193
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,832
[laughter]

194
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,335
(Gameboy)
What are you laughing at?

195
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,870
Amos?

196
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,371
Yes, Amos.
It's in the Old Testament.

197
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,339
I know where Amos is.

198
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,069
Leave it to Gameboy
to be different.

199
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:46,940
Gameboy says he likes Amos

200
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,377
there is some good stuff in Amos,
we'll go with that.

201
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,346
(Stuart)
And last, Ashley?

202
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,314
Stuart.

203
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,818
Ashley, please.

204
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,914
Matthew John,
it really doesn't matter.

205
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,050
You gotta choose one.

206
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,787
Matthew.

207
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,193
Matthew it is. Okay.

208
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,790
Now, can each of you tell me
something about your favorite book?

209
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,129
It can be a verse,

210
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,796
something that spoke to you,
anything.

211
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,100
. Coop?
. Me?

212
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,472
- Yeah.
- Now?

213
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,478
Tell me something about John.

214
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:26,040
Oh, I don't know, I can't think
of anything right on the spot.

215
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,917
Okay.
Carrie?

216
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,114
Lets let Steve go.

217
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,987
(Stuart)
Come on it's your turn.

218
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,860
I can't really think
of anything right now.

219
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,797
Okay.
Steve how about you?

220
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,094
"For all have sinned

221
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,398
and have come short
of the Glory of God." Romans 3:23

222
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,803
Excellent.
That's why we all need Jesus.

223
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:55,138
How about you,
Gameboy?

224
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:59,445
You want me to tell you something
about the book of Amos?

225
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,486
You said it was
your favorite book.

226
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:07,581
Ah yeah, but I didn't knowwe were
going to have a pop quiz on it.

227
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,827
Oh, alright, sorry.

228
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,828
-(Stuart ) Ashley?
- Yes?

229
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,834
Can you tell me
something about Matthew?

230
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,100
No...um...l can't...

231
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,437
Alright.
Thanks for being honest.

232
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,970
(Stuart)
Alright last question.

233
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:34,211
If you could change one thing about
your character, what would it be?

234
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,080
Coop?

235
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,850
I don't know,
I never thought about it.

236
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,382
Okay, well, take your time.

237
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,396
I guess, not to be
so scared of everything.

238
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,954
Like bugs.

239
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,263
Hey, that's a legitimate fear.
Doctors diagnose it all the time.

240
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,166
Yeah, bug doctors.

241
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,465
[laughter]

242
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,005
I agree with Coop.

243
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,870
It's a legitimate fear,
I accept it.

244
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,035
(Stuart) Carrie?

245
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,272
Stuart, no offense,
but these questions?

246
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,972
They have a purpose.

247
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,950
Please, just give me something.

248
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,614
I don't know, reach out
to more people I guess.

249
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,384
That's good.

250
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,494
Steve?

251
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,995
Be more sensitive to others.

252
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,032
<i>I realize that a lot of people
look good on the outside</i>

253
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,260
but on the inside
they're really hurting.

254
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,564
(Stuart)
Okay, good.

255
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,400
Gameboy?

256
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,034
I guess be more attentive.
My mind wander sometimes.

257
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,204
Sometimes?

258
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,248
Okay.

259
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,215
And Ashley?

260
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,684
I don't like this.

261
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,013
I know.
It's the last question.

262
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,216
Come on Ashley,
it'll help him prove his point.

263
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,288
Be more neat.

264
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,261
(Coop)
Be more neat?

265
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,629
Ashley, you're like the neatest
person I've ever met

266
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,998
(Stuart) No, this is good,
this is good.

267
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:02,403
We could all, present company
included, be a little more neat.

268
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,701
Okay.

269
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,965
What's the point?

270
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,501
The point is that all of you gave
really good answers, for the most part,

271
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:13,345
and if you noticed,
they were all pretty different.

272
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:17,148
And that's the point,
it's okay to be different.

273
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:20,349
We don't all have to try
to be like everyone else.

274
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:25,418
We need to recognize that we were
all created by God to be ourselves.

275
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,125
Instead of just criticizing each other
and tearing each other down,

276
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,362
we should see each other as special
in the eyes of the Lord

277
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,634
and help each other.

278
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,038
Sound like a plan?

279
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,509
Sounds good, Stuart.

280
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:44,104
Good. Oh, also,
I think just while we're here,

281
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,006
it might be a good idea to brush up
on our favorite books in the Bible.

282
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:48,212
It might be a good idea to brush up
on our favorite books in the Bible.

283
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:59,346
[music]

284
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,415
(Steve)
Do I see a bug?

285
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,420
Huh? A bug?

286
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,513
(Screams) Ah a bug!
A big bug! Ahhhhh!!

287
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,114
(Carrie)
What's wrong with him'?

288
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,660
Coop! I was just messing with you,
it's just a twig, not a bug.

289
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,162
That's not funny, Steve.

290
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,026
What's wrong?

291
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:34,791
Steve put a bug on my face!

292
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,055
It was ajust a twig.

293
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:36,758
Steve?!

294
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,563
Didn't feel like it.
I almost had a heart attack!

295
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,695
Man, I was just trying to help
you overcome your fear.

296
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,397
Well, surely you can find
a better way to do that.

297
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,134
Now, come on it's night time,
turn in.

298
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,573
Not funny Steve.

299
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,271
Okay, okay.
I'm sorry, Coop.

300
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,142
At least it wasn't
a real bug.

301
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,374
Yeah well, just for that,

302
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,314
I'm not paying you back
for the can of bug spray.

303
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,045
It was just a joke.

304
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,452
No, jokes make people laugh,
not fear for their lives.

305
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,116
I said I was sorry.

306
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,564
- Still hoping?
- Hoping for what?

307
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:15,298
You know.
I saw you trying to talk to her earlier.

308
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,671
Someone has to.
Maybe you should.

309
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,267
You said you wanted
to reach out more.

310
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,279
Is that your motive?
To reach out.

311
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,643
Why, you jealous?

312
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,273
- Of her?
- Yeah.

313
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,681
- No way.
- I think you are.

314
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,446
I think you like her.

315
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,782
I have some compassion.

316
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,845
My mom knows
Ashley's grandmother.

317
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,420
Ashley's living with her

318
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,586
because her mom's living
with her new boyfriend.

319
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,753
I guess her Mom's
always finding guys

320
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,660
that have money
who can buy her things.

321
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,132
Maybe Ashley is the way she is
because she doesn't know any better.

322
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:47,534
Or maybe she's just the way
she is because she likes it

323
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,574
and she uses guys
to get nice things just like her mother.

324
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,667
Has it ever occurred to you that

325
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:57,111
maybe one of the purposes of this
trip is to show her a better way?

326
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,740
That girl is nothing like us
and she never will be.

327
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,785
You don't know that.

328
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,786
She may be tough
on the outside

329
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:07,688
but on the inside I think
she's really hurting.

330
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:12,126
And you can be the one
to rescue her, right?

331
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,664
Yeah.

332
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:22,268
[music]

333
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,301
(Coop)
Good pancakes Beth.

334
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,673
(Steve)
Yes, they sure are.

335
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:31,146
Thank you. I'll have some
more for you in just a minute.

336
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,807
It's actually Stuart's recipe.

337
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,750
(Coop)
Stuart? No, I don't think so.

338
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,842
Oh, come on.

339
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,549
Beth makes the pancakes,
I make the French toast.

340
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,818
Hey Gameboy, how you
liking your pancakes?

341
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,190
I'm finding them very palatable.

342
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,694
Palatable?

343
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,424
(Steve)
Yeah, it means he likes them.

344
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,397
You speak a different
language, Gameboy.

345
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:58,706
Hey Carrie, why don't you go see if
Ashley would like some pancakes?

346
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,712
I would really prefer not to.

347
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,749
Please.
I think it'd be a nice gesture.

348
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,678
Okay.

349
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,697
We're having pancakes for breakfast,
how many do you want?

350
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,699
Who said I wanted pancakes?

351
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,463
This isn't a restaurant.

352
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,435
She's making pancakes
so how many?

353
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,233
I don't want any.

354
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:43,280
She says she doesn't want any.
They're not good enough for her.

355
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,982
So Stuart, what are we
going to do today?

356
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,249
Well, we're going to change
the oil on the van and rotate the tires

357
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,316
and since we're there we may
as well vacuum cleaner out

358
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,555
and you know kind of
spruce it up a little.

359
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,996
We came here to camp,
not work.

360
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,291
(Steve)
He's just messing with you, Cooper.

361
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,826
Yeah, plus, there's not an electrical
outlet to run the vacuum.

362
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,964
Why do you think I brought
extra batteries for my game?

363
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,340
Always thinking there Gameboy.

364
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,003
So what are we going to do?

365
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,942
I have an idea.

366
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,416
I say we go scuba diving
in the lake.

367
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,417
That sounds like fun.

368
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,454
You can't go scuba diving
in a lake,

369
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,455
you got to go scuba diving
in the ocean.

370
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,548
Did you bring the scuba gear?

371
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,957
You know what? I didn't.

372
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,962
- You know what I did bring though?
- (Stuart) What?

373
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,395
Fishing poles.

374
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,996
Alright everybody,
we about ready to go?

375
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,039
I am! Hey Stuart, thanks
for letting me borrowthis net.

376
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,774
Don't thank me
thank Beth,

377
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:38,705
she's the one who thought
you might need it.

378
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,971
- Thanks Beth.
- (Beth) You're welcome.

379
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,603
I'm ready too.

380
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,909
Where's Gameboy?

381
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,414
Oh, he's coming.

382
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,950
- Okay Steve where is it?
- What?

383
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,418
My game.
I can't find my game.

384
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,613
What did you do?

385
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,849
Did you try to sell it
to somebody again?

386
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,549
I didn't take your game.

387
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,286
Your laughing.
See, you can't keep a straight face.

388
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,554
I knowyou took it.

389
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:58,560
I didn't take it, honest.

390
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,756
Coop, did you take it?

391
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,422
I didn't take it.

392
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,831
Well, I can't go fishing
until I find my game.

393
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,834
We didn't take it.

394
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:09,031
Where is it then?
Stuart, do you know?

395
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,971
I'm sorry Gameboy,
I don't.

396
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,030
Do you remember
the last place you saw it?

397
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,075
We'll help you look for it.

398
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,779
Well, I knowl had it in my tent
last night before Steve took it.

399
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,614
Ashley?
Hey. you ready to go?

400
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,018
Home? Yes.
Fishing? No.

401
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,717
Everybody's got
to go fishing Ashley.

402
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,350
(Ashley) Yea I know;
but I don't want to.

403
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,330
We're going to have
a good time.

404
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,867
I much rather stay here.

405
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:41,598
Everybody has to go okay?
Come on, Stuart's rule.

406
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,473
(Carrie) I'm ready!
And I love fishing.

407
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,876
It's my favorite thing about camping.
I can't wait.

408
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,848
(Beth)
Well, that's the spirit, Carrie.

409
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,474
Listen, why don't you go ahead

410
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,916
and tell Stuart we'll be there
in a minute.

411
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:02,523
Thank you.

412
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:10,967
Ashley,
I'll be expecting you.

413
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,998
We need to find
this "game", boys.

414
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,768
What's wrong?

415
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,866
I can't find my game.

416
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,036
Steve took it
but he won't admit it.

417
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,773
For the last time,
I did not take your game.

418
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,714
See you're laughing.
Guilty as charged.

419
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,981
You mean the game you left behind
on the log after breakfast?

420
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:34,717
There it is! Thanks Carrie.
You're the best.

421
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,158
Okay guys, thanks for helping me
look for the game.

422
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,862
Nowlet's go,
the fish are waiting.

423
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,727
Gotta love Gameboy.

424
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,630
Told you I didn't take it.

425
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,869
You know if somebody
doesn't catch a fish

426
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,497
we're not going to have
anything to eat for dinner.

427
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,905
We'll catch some.

428
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,071
Maybe we should give a prize out
to the first person who catches one.

429
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,171
What they get to change
the oil on the bus?

430
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,973
That's funny.

431
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:03,178
I know who's not going to catch
the first one.

432
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,046
Gameboy, you got one.

433
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,424
[laughter]

434
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,962
Hey Carrie,
you ever been fishing before?

435
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,156
(Carrie)
Yeah, all the time.

436
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,061
Really. When?

437
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,862
My Dad used to fish in tournaments
and I would go with him.

438
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,460
Being in the boat
doesn't make you a fisherman Carrie.

439
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,129
I beg your pardon.

440
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,538
Oh sorry, a fisher woman.

441
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,132
I bet I've been fishing
more than you have.

442
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,905
Nope, not a chance.

443
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,876
The Coop man grew up

444
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,880
with his own personal fishing
pond right in his back yard.

445
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,507
I've been fishing ever since
I was a little bobber.

446
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,108
He got you there, Carrie.

447
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,982
Well we'll see who
catches the first one.

448
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,884
Would you mind taking
a drink to Stuart for me?

449
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:44,655
- I guess.
- Thank you.

450
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,196
You know what you're supposed to do
if you catch a big one Carrie?

451
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,596
A big one? In this lake?

452
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,724
Sure.

453
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,860
Kind of like the big ones you
used to catch in your pond.

454
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,131
She got you there Coop.

455
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,673
When you think you got one,
the first thing you gotta do

456
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,710
is step back and pull
your pole hard like this.

457
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,005
Hey!

458
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,604
I'm sorry Ashley!

459
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,977
You are such an idiot!

460
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:06,879
Ashley!

461
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,474
Do you know how much
this outfit cost'?

462
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,780
I said I'm sorry.

463
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,479
Yeah? Well, I'm going to send you
the dry cleaning bill!

464
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,022
He said he was sorry!

465
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,614
Like it matters now.

466
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,625
Why did you even come
on this trip anyway?

467
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,490
You obviously
don't want to be here.

468
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,756
You think I wanted to be here?

469
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,229
And you certainly
don't fit in.

470
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,162
Carrie!

471
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,166
My grandmother
made me come on this trip, okay.

472
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,633
I hate this church stuff.

473
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,761
Why? Because you think
you're too good for us?

474
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,775
Alright guys, just keep fishing.
I'll be back in a minute.

475
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,614
Carrie!

476
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,284
I don't want to talk, alright!

477
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,620
I don't like her and she doesn't
like me and that's that.

478
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:56,097
So whatever you came over
here to say, you can just save it.

479
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,827
She needs our help.

480
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,031
She's beyond our help.

481
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,768
What if the Lord had
that attitude about us?

482
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,300
She's the one with the attitude,
can't you see that?

483
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,310
Okay, even if she does,
how should we react?

484
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,142
I'm not sorry for what I said.
It was the truth.

485
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,153
- Like I said...
- Steve Just save it!

486
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,621
Okay.

487
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,553
[music]

488
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,620
- (Beth) Ashley.
- Just leave me alone, okay?

489
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,893
Ashley it was an accident.

490
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,298
You know what,
she's right.

491
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,302
I don't belong here.
I don't belong anywhere.

492
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,804
(Beth) That's not so.
We love having you here with us.

493
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,306
I just...
I just want to go home.

494
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,309
(Beth) Look, I think if you would
just meet everyone halfway,

495
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,641
you would see their
a great group.

496
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,875
And that's just going
to fix everything?

497
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:50,283
Look, I understand that your life has
been hard with your family situation.

498
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,083
No, you don't understand.

499
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,680
I never met my father
because he left when I was little

500
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,693
and I've lost count of how many
boyfriends my mom has had.

501
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,353
Because of all of them
Ashley's always in the way

502
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,757
and I get shufﬂed
to some family member.

503
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,232
(Sarcastically) Is that how
life is for you, is it?

504
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,760
Because if not, please do not
tell me that you understand.

505
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:21,047
<i>Well, that didn't look good.</i>

506
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,677
That girl is really troubled.

507
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:28,213
Well, can you blame her
the way she's been passed around.

508
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,088
How's Carrie?

509
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,755
I don't know, probably feels terrible
the way she blew up at her.

510
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,297
What can we do?

511
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:39,301
Nothing for now.
Just let both girls be alone for a while.

512
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,776
Ashley just needs a huge dose
of unconditional love.

513
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:52,107
What did you just say?

514
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,050
Ashley needs a huge dose
of unconditional love.

515
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,326
Alright, since this
is our last night here,

516
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,920
I think it would be
appropriate to end with a story.

517
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:08,964
(Gameboy)
Can we tell ghost stories?

518
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,430
(Coop)
Let me tell one!

519
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,326
(Gameboy) Tell him the one
about the guy with the hook!

520
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,096
No, no, no.
I'm telling the story alright?

521
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,798
It's going to be a love story,
not a ghost story.

522
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,340
(Coop) There's more guys than girls.
We should be able to pick.

523
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,342
(Gameboy) Can it at least still
have a guy with a hook in it?

524
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,208
(Coop) Yeah, that'll work.
A love story about a guy with a hook!

525
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,909
This is actually a Bible story
about a man named Hosea.

526
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,917
He was a prophet
in the Old Testament.

527
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,782
Come on Stuart,
the Old Testament?

528
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,947
Yeah, this is the now,
not the then.

529
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,456
You haven't even heard
the story yet.

530
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,021
It's a good one, I promise.

531
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,459
And you might be surprised
to find out how it applies to us.

532
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,220
(Coop) I'd rather hear a ghost story.
No offense against Hos-ee.

533
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,357
- (Steve) It's Hosea!
- You don't know the guy.

534
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,697
- Yes I do. I've read Hosea before.
- You have not.

535
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,202
- Yes I have.
- You have not.

536
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:50,831
Guys! Alright.

537
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,968
Now, in order to understand
the story of Hosea,

538
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:58,071
you got to know something
about the times he was living in.

539
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:03,313
In those days, God's people, Israel,
was divided into two kingdoms;

540
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:06,821
the Northern Kingdom
and the Southern Kingdom.

541
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:11,190
The Southern Kingdom
was faithful in following God.

542
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,924
But, the Northern Kingdom,
not so much.

543
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:18,365
They had chosen to worship pagan
gods from neighboring countries

544
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,801
instead of following the Lord.

545
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,931
And because of this lack of faithfulness
by the Northern Kingdom,

546
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:27,943
God was sending in the Assyrians
to attack and enslave them.

547
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:33,947
But even in His judgment,
God loved His people.

548
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:40,046
He wanted to give them every
opportunity to come back to him.

549
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,058
So He sent them a warning.

550
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:47,927
He sent them a prophet,
a man named Hosea.

551
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,364
(Hosea) For I desire mercy and not
sacrifice the knowledge of God

552
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:58,202
and not burnt offerings,
so says The Lord our God.

553
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:02,075
Therefore shall the land mourn
and everyone who dwells therein

554
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,410
shall languish with
the beasts of the field

555
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,471
and with the fowls in Heaven,

556
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,247
yea the fishes of the sea
also shall be taken away.

557
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,346
I thought you said
this was a love story.

558
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:13,980
This sounds depressing.

559
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,389
Sounds like the making
of an awesome video game

560
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,984
where those Assyrian guys
come to attack.

561
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,393
Yeah.

562
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:21,452
Stuart?

563
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,998
Don't worry Carrie.
Don't worry.

564
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,294
The love story part is coming.

565
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,528
I just got to keep setting the stage
a little bit, alright?

566
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:30,539
To God, the people of Israel
are like His wife,

567
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,472
His one true love.

568
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,979
Only she keep being unfaithful
to Him by worshipping other gods.

569
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,482
What God really wanted was
for someone to understand

570
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,209
how He was feeling.

571
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,946
That's where Hosea comes in.

572
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,114
Hosea was a good man and God
knewthat He could relate to him.

573
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,352
That's also where Hosea's
future wife, Gomer, comes in.

574
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,225
Wait a minute! Gomer'?
What kind of a name is that?!

575
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,093
What? That's her name.

576
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,860
I don't see anything
wrong with it.

577
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,059
Right up there
with Amos, huh?

578
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,968
Hey, what if Gameboy married Gomer.
Gameboy and Gomer.

579
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,233
[laughter]
Gameboy and Gomer.

580
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,603
(Stuart) Like I was saying,

581
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,366
this is where Gomer
comes into the picture.

582
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:11,244
The Bible tells us that Gomer
was a woman of harlotry

583
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:15,079
but what we don't know is
was she was already a harlot

584
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:19,610
or was that something in her heart
that she would one day act out on.

585
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,859
That's not even really the point.

586
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:27,488
The point is that she would
never be faithful to one man.

587
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:32,865
She would sell herself and her love
in exchange for expensive jewelry

588
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:36,235
and a place of status
in their society.

589
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,503
In a way, she was kind of like
the people of the Northern Kingdom.

590
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,976
Never being faithful to their God

591
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,981
and always looking to other false
gods for prosperity and prestige.

592
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:55,622
And then God said to Hosea
"Take this woman as your wife."

593
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,680
[music]

594
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,134
Such beautiful bracelets.

595
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,536
Yes, they are indeed.

596
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:46,973
Are you buying them
for someone?

597
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,409
They are for my wife.

598
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:53,142
A very fortunate woman.

599
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,980
Yes, she is.

600
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,384
I wish I were that fortunate.

601
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:04,220
Maybe one day you will be.

602
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:11,533
[music]

603
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,233
(Hosea) Gomer.

604
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:15,634
Hosea.

605
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,570
There you are,
I have been looking for you.

606
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,574
Why did you leave the temple?

607
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,541
I have heard your sayings before.

608
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,601
They are not just sayings,

609
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,648
these are prophecies
from the Lord.

610
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,980
I decided to come to the marketplace
ahead of you.

611
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,111
Such beautiful bracelets.

612
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,382
You knowwe
can not afford them.

613
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:37,392
Sometimes it is better not to even gaze
upon the things we can not have.

614
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:40,395
So beautiful.

615
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:44,126
Do you remember this place,
Gomer?

616
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,667
This is where I
first approached you

617
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,397
to tell you that God wanted me
to marry you.

618
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,406
I never understood why you would
want to marry someone like me.

619
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,772
Because it was the Lord's will.

620
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,044
And I promise to love you
a lifetime.

621
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:04,275
You have business left with Zedekiah.
Go ahead.

622
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,255
<i>I will see you at home.</i>

623
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:15,264
[music]

624
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:35,374
Ho, there, Hosea!

625
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,450
Zedekiah my friend.

626
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,513
And what have you for me today?
Another jar I hope.

627
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:46,619
Yes...here you are.

628
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:54,828
A beauty. I can see that you
work hard on these.

629
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:59,405
Creating these from dust and clay
help me to understand the Lord better.

630
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:03,708
I see howfragile we all really are.

631
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:08,274
I just hope you keep bringing
your work sol can sell to my customers.

632
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:12,515
Yes, of course I will.
It is our only means of provision.

633
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,650
And here is your share
from the last one.

634
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:25,657
Thank you. I was afraid, I must confess,
that my jars might stop selling.

635
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:30,129
You were speaking
to the people again today.

636
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,800
Yes. I deliver to them
the words of the Lord.

637
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:36,641
Why do you talk
of such great judgment?

638
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:37,771
'L'lmes are good!

639
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,405
To some it may seem so,
Zedekiah,

640
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,417
but the truth is we have
abandoned our true God

641
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:46,319
in exchange for little statues
that we pretend are gods.

642
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,857
Something terrible is coming

643
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,859
and if the people of the
Northern Kingdom do not repent

644
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,361
and turn from their ways,

645
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,330
then we will all suffer
a horrible fate.

646
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,594
Your God does not
sound so kind.

647
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,897
He is not only my God,
Zedekiah.

648
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,265
Have you forgotten the name
of your true God?

649
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,299
His Name is Jehovah.

650
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,404
Let us not talk about such things.

651
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:15,417
I do not want to upset
the working relationship we have.

652
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:21,156
(to self) A horrible fate.

653
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:25,422
I see that Gomer was about
the marketplace today.

654
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,690
Yes, she came with me.

655
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:32,565
She is a very beautiful woman
but she has a wandering eye.

656
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,297
I see the way
she looks at other men.

657
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,430
Please do not say
such things Zedekiah.

658
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,441
It is the truth.

659
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:42,444
She is not a woman
you can trust with your heart.

660
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,174
I do not understand
why you married her.

661
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,182
The Lord told me to do so.

662
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,845
Surely there were finer
and purer women for you to marry.

663
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:53,946
She's in need of love
like everyone else.

664
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,955
Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim,
has never lacked in love.

665
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,663
She's being faithful to me now
and there is a difference between

666
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,962
the love she's used to receiving
and the love that I have for her.

667
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,534
Only a broken heart will
this woman give you Hosea.

668
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,705
I will see you again soon.

669
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,836
So long my friend.

670
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:23,502
[music]

671
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:40,898
They have been
talking about you.

672
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,370
The people do not like
what you are saying,

673
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,906
so why do you persist?

674
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,847
The words I speak
are from the Lord.

675
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:52,778
But they are harsh.

676
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:57,582
No my wife, they are truth.
Always the truth.

677
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,555
Because of your words,
they do not speak well of me either.

678
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,818
I cannot change what
the Lord instructs me to say.

679
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,985
Why does God not show mercy
to the people?

680
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,586
God has shown great mercy
to His people

681
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:11,293
by allowing them to live in their
sinful ways for such a long time.

682
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:15,462
The people have forgotten the great
things the Lord has done for them.

683
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:19,406
Perhaps if God was not so judgmental,
the people would respond.

684
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:30,452
Lord God, I pray that your words
might affect the people.

685
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,284
I pray that they would turn
their hearts back to you again.

686
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,346
Please, God, forgive us our sins.

687
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,553
Help us to turn away
from the sacrifices to idols,

688
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:46,034
cause us to be the people
who long for You and only for You.

689
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,037
- Uh...Stuart?
- Yes, Steve.

690
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,301
I don't mean
to interrupt you here,

691
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,866
but I've read the story
of Hosea and Gomer before

692
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,969
and I don't remember
any of this.

693
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,980
Well, you are not wrong.

694
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,743
<i>The Book of Hosea
doesn't go into detail</i>

695
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,081
about how Hosea and Gomer met

696
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,321
or the circumstances surrounding
their marriage.

697
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:09,449
It simply says that God told Hosea
to marry Gomer and so he did.

698
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,484
What I am doing is coming up with
a way that might have happened

699
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:16,725
so you can get a little more
appreciation from the facts.

700
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,734
We do know from the Bible
that Hosea married Gomer

701
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,464
and Gomer gave birth
to a son.

702
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:26,474
And the Lord told Hosea
to call the child "Jezreel"

703
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,374
because he would put an end
to the kingdom of Israel.

704
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,743
Okay, what was his name?
Jez-who?

705
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,340
Jezreel. You see,
the judgment was coming.

706
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:38,012
And the Lord was trying
to warn the people.

707
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:41,613
It was God's will that the child
be called "Jezreel"

708
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,592
as a prophecy against
the Northern Kingdom.

709
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,855
Wait a minute Stuart,
I got a question.

710
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,454
If God knew that Gomer
was going to be unfaithful,

711
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,761
then why would He have
Hosea marry her?

712
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,029
Especially because you said
he was a good man.

713
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:58,130
God wanted Hosea to understand Him,
and that's the key here.

714
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,104
He wanted Hosea
to love so deeply

715
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:04,772
knowing that it would
never be returned.

716
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:08,681
It was a very hard lesson,
but in the end...

717
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,481
well, I'm getting ahead
of myself.

718
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,790
He's finally sleeping.

719
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,801
<i>I have to go the temple
again tomorrow</i>

720
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:33,739
To sell another jar?

721
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,904
Yes, and I need to speak
to the people again.

722
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:42,007
Hosea, why can you not just be
concerned about taking care of us.

723
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:45,485
We have enough food
and we have a place to live,

724
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,750
a place for our son to sleep.

725
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,917
It is the people we need
to be concerned about.

726
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,857
These are good times
for the people.

727
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,725
The harvest was plentiful.

728
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,764
The merchants are selling
their goods.

729
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,858
But we do not acknowledge the One
who is providing for us.

730
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,995
We have traded the living God
for silent statues

731
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:05,165
that are no more than
pieces of clay.

732
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:09,473
Hosea, what have you gained
by obeying your God?

733
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,605
How can you ask such a question?
He is your God, too.

734
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,618
We need money, Hosea.
Not more prophecies of doom.

735
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:20,622
Hear this, you priests.
Hearken, you house of Israel.

736
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:24,125
Give ear oh you house of the king;
for judgment is toward you.

737
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:27,924
I know Ephraim and Israel
is not hid from me,

738
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:32,661
for now, oh Ephraim, you commit
prostitution and Israel is defiled.

739
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:37,138
(Jahaz) He speaks of prostitution,
while his own wife is a harlot!

740
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:45,545
[laughter and murmur]

741
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,607
They do not frame their doings
to turn unto their God,

742
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,619
for the spirit of prostitution
is in the land

743
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,621
and they have not known
the Lord.

744
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,749
And the pride of Israel
does testify to his face,

745
00:41:56,814 --> 00:42:00,990
therefore shall Israel and Ephraim
fall in their iniquity.

746
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,759
Judah also shall fall with them.

747
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,631
They have dealt treacherously
against the Lord

748
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,638
for they have begotten
strange children.

749
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,534
So says the Lord our God.

750
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:21,182
The only person bearing strange
children is your wife.

751
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,911
[laughter]

752
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:28,150
You speak of this judgment to come
only to provoke the people.

753
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,624
My heart breaks for God's people.

754
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,628
Your words are false.

755
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:37,154
The words that I deliver to you are the
words of the Lord and they are true.

756
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,169
We need to take heed
before it is too late.

757
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,536
If you keep speaking these words,

758
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:51,910
we shall deal treacherously
with you, Hosea.

759
00:42:54,638 --> 00:43:04,218
[music]

760
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,622
Hosea, so good
to see you my friend.

761
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,031
I thought you had found yourself
another business partner.

762
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,069
No, no.

763
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,832
It has been hard for me to find
time to make jars these days.

764
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,839
How much is this one?

765
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:30,351
Perhaps if you would spend less time
warning the people

766
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:34,055
and more time tending to your jars,
you would find yourself better suited.

767
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,887
The Lord and His work
must always come first.

768
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,757
Be careful with the people,
Hosea.

769
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,093
I do not want to see
anything happen to you.

770
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,291
Neither do I.

771
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,959
<i>I will see you next time.</i>

772
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,900
Yes.

773
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,032
Hosea, you forgot your pay!

774
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,667
Why wouldn't the people listen?

775
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,211
Because they probably
thought Hosea

776
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,177
was a nut case
with all that judgment talk.

777
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,875
And you heard Zedekiah,
times were good.

778
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,316
Sometimes it's hard to hear
God when it's going well.

779
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,320
Yeah, but these people
are deaf.

780
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:08,357
Easy to forget that He is the one
who allows us to prosper.

781
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:11,256
Well I'm not forgetting
and I would have listened.

782
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,157
No you wouldn't have.

783
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,059
Yes, I would've.
And I would have helped Hosea too.

784
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,756
(Stuart)
You know what Coop,

785
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,662
I bet Hosea would have
appreciated the help.

786
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:33,645
You have returned so soon?

787
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:36,651
I said what I needed
to say to the people.

788
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,653
Did you get a good price
for the jar?

789
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:42,657
Yes I did. Zedekiah is always
fair with me.

790
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,923
Where is the payment?

791
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:54,062
Oh, I do not have it.
I have forgotten to take it from Zedekiah.

792
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,900
That money is our only means.

793
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,335
Zedekiah is a loyal friend.

794
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,381
He will keep the money for me.

795
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:09,077
I shall go there tomorrow
and get it.

796
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:12,177
I am tired now
from today's journey.

797
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:14,222
And you are bringing us
to poverty.

798
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,689
The Lord is providing.

799
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,225
<i>Soon, we will have nothing at all.</i>

800
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,692
Gomer, where are you going?

801
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,854
To the marketplace to get
your payment from Zedekiah.

802
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,329
Tomorrowwill be soon enough.

803
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:28,100
Gomer!

804
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,965
(Gomer) Zedekiah!

805
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,341
(Zedekiah) Gomer? What brings you
to the marketplace at close?

806
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,346
I have come
for my husband's pay.

807
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,473
Yes, of course.

808
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,115
Hosea left in such a hurry.

809
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,345
I tried calling out to him.

810
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,978
Here you go.

811
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:48,455
Thank you.
We need this payment.

812
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,049
You have a fine man
in Hosea.

813
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:54,324
A man that is bringing us
to poverty.

814
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:57,058
His jars always bring
a good price.

815
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,067
But he does not make
enough of them.

816
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,332
He spends too much time
being concerned about the people.

817
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:06,841
Indeed, your husband speaks boldly
for his God.

818
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:11,243
But have you noticed
that no one is listening.

819
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:17,980
What I have noticed is that your
husband loves you very much.

820
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:21,388
I will be on my way.

821
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,880
[music]

822
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:38,940
Shhh!

823
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,135
It is you.

824
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:43,075
I did not mean to scare you.

825
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,079
You surprised me.

826
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,945
I have been looking for you
each day at the marketplace.

827
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:50,076
I do not come here often.

828
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,051
I want to see you.

829
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,316
But you are married.

830
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,518
I am giving my wife
a bill of divorcement.

831
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,425
I have a husband
who loves me.

832
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,930
Your husband is of
no concern to me.

833
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:07,935
But you, you are a very beautiful
woman and deserve beautiful things.

834
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:12,999
So Beautiful.

835
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:16,408
Beautiful things that
I can give you.

836
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:22,334
[music]

837
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,877
I have been waiting for you.

838
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,975
Hosea, you frightened me!

839
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,246
I have not been able to sleep.

840
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,982
You said you went to the market
to see Zedekiah

841
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,285
but this was many hours ago.

842
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,850
My wife,
where have you been?

843
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,863
I went also to see my father.

844
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:11,092
I thought it would be best
to spend time with him.

845
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,633
He is not feeling well.

846
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,631
Diblaim's health is failing?

847
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,963
I thought it'd be best
I spend time with him.

848
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,234
Yes, of course.

849
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:23,244
I wish you to visit Diblaim
as often as you like.

850
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:32,253
This Gomer, what a loser!
Hosea should have dumped her.

851
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,619
Hosea was doing what
God told him to do.

852
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:35,383
He couldn't dump her.

853
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,618
That's right,
when you make a vow to the Lord,

854
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:41,026
you keep it, no matter what the
circumstances are or the situation.

855
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,554
You stay true to your word
and marriage is a vow.

856
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,966
The Lord had put that
deep in Hosea's heart.

857
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:51,131
Well, I didn't mean for him
to really dump her.

858
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:55,973
I know you didn't, you just don't
like her unfaithfulness to Hosea

859
00:48:56,033 --> 00:49:00,311
just as God didn't like His
people's unfaithfulness to Him.

860
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,214
The Bible tells us that
Gomer conceived again

861
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,253
and gave birth to a daughter.

862
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:09,951
The Lord told Hosea
to name this child Lo-Ruhamah,

863
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:15,122
that He would no more have mercy
upon the house of Israel.

864
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:18,496
Hear the word of the Lord,
you children of Israel,

865
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:22,128
for the Lord has a controversy
with the inhabitants of this land,

866
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:25,969
there is no truth, nor mercy,
nor knowledge of God in the land.

867
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,532
There is only cursing
and lying,

868
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:31,977
killing and stealing
and committing adultery.

869
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:33,673
Therefore shall the land mourn,

870
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,650
and everyone that
dwells in it shall anguish.

871
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,210
These are the words
of the Lord our God.

872
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:46,655
Hosea, dare you continue to speak
these words of judgment against us.

873
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:49,960
I say to you Jahaz
and to all the people.

874
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,364
You bow down to gods
that are no gods.

875
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,665
And you have rejected the Lord God,
your true maker.

876
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:59,401
But we are blessed
and our purses are full.

877
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,670
We do not need the ways
of your God.

878
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,508
The ways of the Lord are right
and the just shall walk int

879
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:08,380
Hosea is jealous because
we are prosperous

880
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,042
and he has come into poverty.

881
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,518
[laughter]

882
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,647
Do you see this
barren olive tree?

883
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:17,555
Such will be the result
of your prosperity.

884
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:21,528
You shall all of you become
as barren as this tree

885
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,360
if you do not turn back
to the true God.

886
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,400
The God of Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob.

887
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:28,299
It is you that is barren.

888
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,998
Our gods have
well taken care of us.

889
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,268
To all the people I say.

890
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:37,403
After the judgment,
your God will not forget his children.

891
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:41,438
The day will come when all Israel
will return to the Lord

892
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:46,352
and this tree
shall be full again.

893
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:52,711
[music]

894
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:32,325
<i>[voice of Jahaz] Hosea is jealous
because we an-2 prosperous</i>

895
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:33,697
<i>and he is come into poverty.</i>

896
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,532
<i>[laughter]</i>

897

[music]

899
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,811
Did she steal it?

900
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:28,117
Cooper, would you
stop interrupting.

901
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,521
I just want to know
if she stole it.

902
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,115
No, the rich guy
bought it for her.

903
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,660
What makes you say that?

904
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,821
Because that's what rich guys do,
they buy things for women.

905
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,523
That's how they get 'em
to like them.

906
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,566
How do you know?

907
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,158
I know what I know.

908
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:42,396
Plus, Hosea's savings were
still in his safe spot.

909
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,166
It was the rich guy.

910
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,672
Well money can't buy true love.

911
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,675
Yeah, but that's not
what Gomer was thinking.

912
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,472
Sorry Stuart this Hosea guy,

913
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,410
he might be a prophet
but he's not very smart.

914
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:54,210
Yep, I saw through this Gomer lady
a half hour ago.

915
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:58,413
You guys are pleading a good case
and I hear you loud and clear.

916
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,785
Which brings me to this.

917
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:05,259
There's a verse in the Bible,
way back in the book of Numbers

918
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:10,822
that says you can be sure
that your sin will find you out.

919
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:13,458
So what do you think
is about to happen?

920
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,729
She's going to get caught.

921
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,431
I doubt it.
At least not by Hosea.

922
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:20,168
Would you guys stop talking
and let Stuart continue the story.

923
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,436
Keep going Stuart.

924
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:24,445
You're the one who
started talking first.

925
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,242
(Stuart)
A couple of days later...

926
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:35,688
Diblaim!

927
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,457
Hosea!
I am surprised to see you.

928
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,326
Howis my son-in-law!

929
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,695
I am well.
It is you who I am concerned about.

930
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:47,200
Gomer says your health
has not been good.

931
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:49,601
My health is very strong
these days.

932
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:51,434
But Gomer said you were ill.

933
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,873
But I am well.
Howis my daughter?

934
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:58,879
I have not seen her
in many weeks.

935
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:01,541
Many weeks?

936
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,318
She has lied to me.

937
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:10,722
She was not with her father
so where could she have gone?

938
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,884
- Hosea.
- Where could she have gone?

939
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:22,303
I think you already know
the answer to that my friend.

940
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:27,837
I did not want to say
anything before...but...

941
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,707
there has been talk
of Gomer and -

942
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,304
Please do not say it.

943
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,974
You need to know the truth.

944
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:36,984
Gomer has been unfaithful again.

945
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:43,821
You do not know that for certain.
I will ask her.

946
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,690
I would not trust the answer
from that harlot.

947
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,559
Do not call her that!

948
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,291
Why do you defend her?

949
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:51,696
Because I love her.

950
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:54,429
Then you are a fool!

951
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,994
You would love her even though
she has done this?

952
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,803
And more than once.

953
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,572
She is my wife.

954
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:06,341
Okay, Hosea enough is enough.

955
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:07,404
Yea, she's toast.

956
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,448
First Gomer lies,
now she cheats.

957
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,314
'L'lme to throwthis fish back
in the water.

958
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,717
But not back in my pond.
I don't want her.

959
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,414
He's not going
to get rid of Gomer.

960
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,751
Why not?
He knows she's doing wrong.

961
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:16,813
Yea, but you are
missing the point.

962
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,917
She's been nothing
but trouble.

963
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:19,926
I'm with Coop.

964
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,587
Hosea's not going
to get rid of her guys.

965
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:25,292
The next day,
Hosea was working on ajar.

966
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,973
Gomer, where are you going?

967
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,601
To see my father.

968
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,872
Your father?

969
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:40,881
Yes, I want to see about his health
and prepare him some food.

970
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,974
Ah, good,
let me come with you.

971
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,916
We can ask Lydia to care
for the children.

972
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:46,851
No, please stay here.

973
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,719
I would like to see him alone.

974
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,451
We can go see him
together another time.

975
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,856
When will you return?

976
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:53,758
I will be back before sunset.

977
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:56,593
Gom er.

978
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,633
Yes?

979
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,532
Please give Diblaim
a greeting for me.

980
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,470
Yes of course.

981
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:09,527
[music]

982
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:21,488
(Hosea) Please God, I can not take
this anymore, my heart will not last.

983
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:25,720
I would send her away, but I know
I can not, for it is not your will.

984
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:29,127
I have made a promise
to you and I will keep it.

985
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,024
Man, I don't think
I would have been like that.

986
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,033
I'd probably would have been
mad at God.

987
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,365
Yeah, had to be tough
to deal with.

988
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,099
And maybe that's
why God chose Hosea

989
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:39,970
because he knew
Hosea would understand

990
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:42,009
and stay faithful
to his vow.

991
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,636
I think it's cool that Hosea's
going to stay with her,

992
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,147
even after what he
found out about Gomer.

993
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,611
What Hosea was going
through right now

994
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,482
is what God was going
through with His people.

995
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:56,718
Hosea was feeling God's pain.

996
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,954
So the Bible tells us that
Gomer had another son

997
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:04,624
and the Lord told Hosea
to call him Lo Ammi,

998
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,598
which has the meaning,

999
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:10,035
you are not my people
and I will not be your your God.

1000
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:10,426
Why do you insist
on these names?

1001
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,065
Why do you insist
on these names?

1002
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:13,402
I name them
as the Lord tells me.

1003
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,033
But we are being ridiculed
by our people.

1004
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,600
The names of our children
is not what is troubling us.

1005
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:17,770
What do you mean?

1006
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:20,144
I see the jewelry you are wearing,
Gomer?

1007
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:22,945
We can not afford these
on what we make from the jars?

1008
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,610
They are gifts.

1009
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,085
It is wrong what you are doing.

1010
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,644
I do not know
what you are saying.

1011
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,021
You do Gomer! It is wrong for you
to be seeing another man.

1012
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,583
I told you
I could not be tamed.

1013
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,755
He only wants you for what
you can offer him.

1014
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:38,459
I want to be with you for what
I can give to you.

1015
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:42,731
You give nothing, he does.

1016
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,136
It is against God's Holy Law

1017
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:48,608
I do not need your God
or you to pity me.

1018
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,612
You speak of this doom
that is to come, let it come.

1019
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:52,908
Let your God destroy us all.

1020
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:56,473
God does not want to destroy us.
He wants to save us.

1021
00:57:56,539 --> 00:58:00,112
Not all of us want to be saved.

1022
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,456
[music]

1023
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:10,992
Today we celebrate
the leaving of my wife!

1024
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:15,002
I pray that no man here ever
gets married to one such as she.

1025
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:16,503
[laughter]

1026
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,903
We can see you
are no longer lonely!

1027
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:22,136
No, not at all, for I have found
one far lovelier.

1028
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:24,144
A toast!

1029
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,146
To the most beautiful woman
in the land!

1030
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:29,206
Here, here!

1031
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,115
[laughter]

1032
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:45,950
Why? Why? Why? Why Lord?
Why? Why? Why?

1033
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:55,805
The idols of the people
are silver and gold,

1034
00:58:55,865 --> 00:59:02,578
the work of men's hands,
nothing more than this piece of clay.

1035
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:09,884
Mouths have they
but they speak not.

1036
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,620
They have eyes but see not.

1037
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:16,755
Ears have they
but they hear not,

1038
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:19,993
nor is there any breath
in their mouths.

1039
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:28,940
Everyone that trusts in them
shall become like them.

1040
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:37,173
Your people have rejected you...

1041
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:44,558
as Gomer has rejected me.

1042
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:51,292
I feel sorry for Hosea,
he deserved better.

1043
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,834
Here Hosea is doing right
and Gomer is doing wrong.

1044
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,927
Yet, Hosea is the one
who has to pay.

1045
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,768
Plus, no one is doing anything
about what he's saying.

1046
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:01,707
So you got Hosea
taking care of his kids,

1047
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,004
he's busy making jars,

1048
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:05,569
he's gotta speak
God's Word to the people,

1049
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:08,912
and nobody's listening to him,
and what's Gomer off doing,

1050
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:13,648
she's in some five star hotel
with the rich guy.

1051
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,021
Thank you Gameboy
for capturing that so eloquently.

1052
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,823
However, there's a little more
to this story.

1053
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:24,031
My people are destroyed
for lack of knowledge.

1054
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:27,296
And because you have rejected
knowledge, I will also shall reject you.

1055
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,803
You shall be no priest to me,

1056
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,772
for seeing as how you have forgotten
the law of your God,

1057
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:35,366
I also shall forget your children.

1058
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,909
As they were increased,
so they sinned against me,

1059
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:43,041
therefore will I change
their glory into shame.

1060
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:49,284
I shall punish them for their ways,
and reward them for their doings.

1061
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:53,657
For they shall eat,
and not have enough

1062
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:57,687
because they have left off
to take heed to the Lord.

1063
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:02,166
Son of Beeri! Wait for me!

1064
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:05,104
Zedekiah.

1065
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,301
Those were strong words
to the people.

1066
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:12,107
The patience of our God
will not endure forever.

1067
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:15,706
You continue to warn us of this
great judgment that is to come.

1068
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:18,912
But nothing has yet happened.
All is well.

1069
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,649
No Zedekiah,
all is not well.

1070
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:23,918
The people do not worship
the one who created them

1071
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:28,053
and they do not fear
His Holy name.

1072
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:31,655
Judgment is coming.

1073
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:37,904
Has Gomer returned?

1074
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:51,351
Ah, Gomer, my love!
Come and dance with me!

1075
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,048
Come dance!

1076
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:59,059
Dance with me! Dance!

1077
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,185
I am not in the mood.

1078
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:02,058
Dance with me.

1079
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,358
I am not in the mood.

1080
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:06,366
Your husband Hosea
may have stood for your moods,

1081
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:09,198
but I will not because
I am in the mood.

1082
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:12,796
Now, dance with me!

1083
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:15,365
<i>I will not.</i>

1084
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:17,468
You resist me?

1085
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,475
I do not desire it.

1086
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,113
But I do!

1087
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,343
No!

1088
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:27,815
Was not I the one you left
that false prophet

1089
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,914
and all your other lovers for?

1090
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:33,358
You ran into my arms because
of all the nice things I can give you.

1091
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,487
Now, dance with me!

1092
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:36,787
Leave me alone.

1093
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,493
- You will do as I say.
- No!

1094
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,499
No?
Guards! Guards!

1095
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:49,467
What are you doing?

1096
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:52,809
Since you do not desire
my charms tonight...

1097
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:56,009
I do not care to see
this one anymore.

1098
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,484
Put her up for auction.

1099
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:01,215
Please! Leave me alone!
Let me go!

1100
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,781
Let me go, just please,
no, no!!

1101
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,327
[music]

1102
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:11,286
My Lord God, howcan I love one
who loves another?

1103
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:15,326
My Lord God, howcan I love one
who loves another?

1104
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:17,371
Why did You want me
to marry her?

1105
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:20,532
She has been unfaithful
so many times.

1106
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,004
I know now how
Your heart grieves

1107
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:26,444
over Your people that
have abandoned you.

1108
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:32,316
So, how can You still love us'?
How'? How'?

1109
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:38,348
[music]

1110
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:43,130
You love us because Your love
is not dependent on us.

1111
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:55,203
Oh, my Lord God,
how great is Your love.

1112
01:03:55,264 --> 01:04:00,264
[music]

1113
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:24,099
And now what say you of this one?
Do I have a bid'?

1114
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,109
She is still of child bearing age.
If that suits you.

1115
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:31,975
So, who will start the bidding?

1116
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:37,113
No bids?

1117
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:40,154
Surely she can work
in your fields.

1118
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:45,392
Anyone? Anyone? !

1119
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:49,487
A half homer of barley.

1120
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,862
Half homer of barley?

1121
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:54,367
Surely, this woman has many
good years of work in her.

1122
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:57,233
Who will give me one piece
of silver for her?

1123
01:04:57,293 --> 01:05:00,069
One homer of barley.

1124
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:03,542
One homer of barley.

1125
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,102
This woman
is of strong stock!

1126
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:08,148
She can bear your children.

1127
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:10,377
One piece of silver.

1128
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:12,510
One homer of barley,
I said.

1129
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,987
One homer of barley.

1130
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:18,958
Anyone else?

1131
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:23,225
One homer of barley going once.

1132
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,093
One homer of barley going twice...

1133
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:29,625
(voiced from out of crowd)
Fifteen pieces of silver!

1134
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:33,105
Fifteen pieces of silver?

1135
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:37,110
And a homer of barley
and a half homer of barley, too.

1136
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:45,914
Sold for fifteen pieces
of silver

1137
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:50,515
and a homer of barley
and a half homer of barley too!

1138
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,524
[music]

1139
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:23,455
You shall not be for another,

1140
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:27,426
and I will be for you always.

1141
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:35,033
Come, come.

1142
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:41,058
[music]

1143
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:09,759
And he bought her back.
I call it Amazing love.

1144
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:19,438
The story of Hosea is a picture,
a picture of God's amazing love for us.

1145
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:25,544
And just as Hosea bought back
his own wife with all that he had,

1146
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:30,284
Jesus Christ paid the fifteen pieces
of silver for us

1147
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:33,418
when He died on that cross.

1148
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:37,259
He certainly gave all He had.

1149
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:42,530
And if we through faith
believe in Jesus Christ,

1150
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:49,440
and receive Him into our lives,
then all of our sins are forgiven

1151
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:53,446
and we have entered
into God's family, forever.

1152
01:07:56,105 --> 01:08:04,456
[music]

1153
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:13,096
You know, Stuart would
never tell you this part...

1154
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:18,798
but he is my Hosea.

1155
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:23,276
When I was really little my
parents were divorced

1156
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:30,409
and I was passed back and forth
between them for years.

1157
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:37,652
I felt so unloved like neither
parent really wanted me.

1158
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:47,865
Then, I met Stuart at church.
He made me feel so special.

1159
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:53,870
I think it was the first time
I really realized what love was

1160
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,873
and that He is my real Father.

1161
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:05,347
I don't think I could do
what Hosea did.

1162
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,286
I'm not sure any of us could,
Steve.

1163
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:12,850
I don't know that any of us could
muster up that much selfless love

1164
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:16,453
to love someone
who treated us like that.

1165
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,829
(Stuart) It's hard enough just
to like someone sometimes

1166
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:21,835
even when their just a little bit
different than we are.

1167
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:30,475
But just like we need Jesus
to get to heaven for salvation,

1168
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:37,473
we also need Him to live
His life through us daily.

1169
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:42,555
Jesus in you
could love a Gomer.

1170
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,628
What happened to
the Northern Kingdom

1171
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,630
and all of Hosea's prophecies?

1172
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,892
Did they come true?

1173
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,695
(Stuart)
Yes, Cooper they did.

1174
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:56,828
The people didn't turn back
to God so the Assyrians came

1175
01:09:56,892 --> 01:10:00,840
and they enslaved
the Israelites for many years.

1176
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:06,577
Just goes to show how serious
God is about His Word.

1177
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:13,450
You see, most of us don't
revere the Lord as we should.

1178
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:17,457
Hosea did.

1179
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:21,427
Yes, Steve. Hosea did.

1180
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,460
So, what are you guys reading?

1181
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:34,201
Figured it was time to read my
favorite book in the Bible again.

1182
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,334
The Gospel of John.

1183
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,241
That's good.

1184
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,973
Gameboy?

1185
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,716
Just reading a little bit
of Amos.

1186
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:03,360
Do you have a moment?

1187
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:08,998
I guess.

1188
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:12,839
Ashley, I'm so sorry
about what I said earlier.

1189
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:16,576
I shouldn't have
said those things.

1190
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:19,984
You meant them.

1191
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:24,582
At the time maybe,
but it was wrong.

1192
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:27,685
I just got so mad
and said some stupid things.

1193
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:31,288
Did that story change
your mind?

1194
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:35,301
Yeah, it did.

1195
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:40,573
I knowa little about
your situation with your mom

1196
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,906
and I'm really sorry.

1197
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,311
It must be so tough.

1198
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:50,316
How would you know'?

1199
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:54,320
You probably have two parents
who are there for you

1200
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:57,585
and who care about you.

1201
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:02,425
You don't have any idea
of what it's like.

1202
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:11,734
Your right. I don't,
but God does.

1203
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:17,839
He can make it better
if you just give Him a chance.

1204
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:21,848
Yeah well, I can handle it myself.

1205
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:27,851
I'd like to be your friend
if you give me a chance.

1206
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:32,859
I knowl haven't acted like
much of a friend on this trip,

1207
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:37,364
but if you ever need
someone to talk to.

1208
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:42,519
[music]

1209
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:02,383
Alright everybody, make sure
you've got everything!

1210
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:03,548
It's time to go!

1211
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:05,023
I read the whole book of Amos
last night Stuart.

1212
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,458
- Did you?
- I did.

1213
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:08,893
That's like 8 chapters, isn't it?

1214
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,453
Nine to be exact.

1215
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:12,624
I think that's the most
I've read the Bible in one time.

1216
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:15,726
- Very impressive.
- Thanks.

1217
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,361
We're going home, Coop.

1218
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:19,133
Yep. No more lumpy ground
to sleep on.

1219
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:22,137
- No more bugs.
- No more bugs!

1220
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:25,038
- I'm going to miss it.
- Yeah. Me too.

1221
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,478
Hey Ashley, give me a sec,
I'll come get those for you.

1222
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:30,745
It's okay, I got it.

1223
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:37,751
[music]

1224
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:41,491
Hang on a sec.

1225
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:47,158
- Do you mind sitting in the back?
- Not at all.

1226
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,000
You ready?

1227
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:56,167
Um hum.

1228
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:07,485
Hey, can I sit with you?

1229
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:08,817
Um hum.

1230
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:13,924
[music]

1231
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:22,099
We really love this place,
don't we?

1232
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:23,431
We sure do.

1233
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:30,703
Good things always
happen up here.

1234
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:39,036
[music]

1235
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:29,626
(Knock on door)

1236
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:50,921
Jahaz?

1237
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:53,926
Hosea, can we speak?

1238
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:58,021
Yes, yes, we can speak.

1239
01:15:58,086 --> 01:16:01,966
I would like to know
more about your God.

1240
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,760
[music]

1241
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:33,792
The day will come when all
Israel will return unto the Lord

1242
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:38,702
and this tree shall be full again.
