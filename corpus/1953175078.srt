1
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,408
(Saw whirring)

2
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,350
What the fuck?

3
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,185
What the fuck happened
over here?

4
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,186
Shit!

5
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:23,855
Sorry, Mr. Parsons.

6
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,057
What are you doing, dude?

7
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,758
You haven't paid your bills
in three months.

8
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:27,892
It's out of my hands.

9
00:00:27,893 --> 00:00:29,161
You don't have to do
jack shit!

10
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,828
Come on,
just give me another break!

11
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:32,030
I'm just doing my job, man.

12
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,332
You are just another
fucking asshole!

13
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,700
Have a nice day.

14
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:38,503
Fucking shit!

15
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:40,705
It's one thing I hate,
is warm beer.

16
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,843
Hey, listen, maybe I can give
a little donation

17
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:47,645
to the Electrical
Worker's Ball.

18
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:48,947
Just pay your bill, sir.

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,650
Fucking dickhead!

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,020
What's wrong, Dad?

21
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:57,522
They shut the power off again!

22
00:00:57,523 --> 00:01:00,192
Just go and get
some power, boy!

23
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:39,797
What do you think?

24
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:42,367
Four thousand
nine hundred square feet.

25
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,370
Seven bedrooms,
four and a half bathrooms.

26
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:49,007
Hardwood floor, Italian marble,
Jacuzzi, tennis courts.

27
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:52,477
I think
I'm going to like it here.

28
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:54,012
Do you play tennis?

29
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:57,849
Are you alone?
Where are your parents?

30
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,619
Beverley Hills,
Rome, London.

31
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,819
Who knows?

32
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,121
Lucky bastard.

33
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,627
What are you doing?

34
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,994
Redistributing the wealth.

35
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:11,963
Well, I call it stealing.

36
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:13,532
You do not need to worry about
what I'm doing.

37
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,400
You need to learn
to mind your own business.

38
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,135
But it is my business.

39
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:19,171
You can't just
walk onto a person's property

40
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,438
and expect them to--

41
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:23,241
Look, kid,
be a good neighbour,

42
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:25,310
or I'll kick
your fucking ass!

43
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:27,812
MAN:
Jack!

44
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:29,147
Coming, Dad!

45
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:53,825
(Honking)

46
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,460
MAN:
Jesus! Fuck!

47
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,796
Fuck!

48
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,830
Fuck!

49
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,264
Pull the fuck over,
Jack!

50
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:04,636
I have had enough!
I want out!

51
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,637
Fuck!

52
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,239
Can't lose, can't lose.

53
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Can I get a little
"Amen" on that?

54
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:10,241
Look at the fucking road!

55
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,814
It's a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

56
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,549
No, it's not!
It's a fucking death wish!

57
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,983
And I'm not planning to die!

58
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:20,318
Would you please turn on
the fucking lights?

59
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,591
Jack, will you please, please
put on the fucking lights?

60
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,493
I'm driving
by sound here, man!

61
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,728
What?

62
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,062
How drunk are you?

63
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:32,864
Relax.
It is an old bootlegger's trick.

64
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,033
I know this road like the
back of my fucking hand, okay?

65
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,569
Fucking left or right?

66
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,570
Put your hands
on the fucking wheel!

67
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,171
Right, right, right!
It's a left!

68
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,542
Put on the lights, Jack!

69
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:47,044
Winner!

70
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:48,112
Jesus Christ!

71
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,155
(Moaning)

72
00:05:58,156 --> 00:06:01,058
The train
is in the station!

73
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:03,862
Choo fucking choo!

74
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,864
(Moaning)

75
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,574
Hey! I hope we didn't
keep you up, man.

76
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,209
Oh, no, no, no.

77
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,344
I slept like
I was in the womb.

78
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:21,513
Jack.
Jack, those are mine.

79
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,681
These are my shoes,
man.

80
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:25,249
Oh, Vera, if I put
anything else up my nose,

81
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,985
I'm going to end up like
that chick from Fleetwood Mac.

82
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:30,388
Anne said
you're pledging Veritas.

83
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,156
Shh.
It's a secret.

84
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:34,258
She said you told her.

85
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,660
Kings of funny hats.

86
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,195
Same bullshit, different
secret handshake, silly clubs.

87
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:40,598
No, no, no.
Mickey Mouse has the silly club.

88
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,467
These are key men.

89
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,602
Where are you going
so early, man?

90
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:46,270
I wanna see Anne
before class.

91
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,271
Class.

92
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:48,640
Yes, class.

93
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,374
Save the wisecracks
for Bristor.

94
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,744
Give Professor Bristor
our best.

95
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,081
That's my towel.

96
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,787
Treats for my peeps.

97
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:08,593
You do it yet?

98
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,027
Veritas isn't just
some fraternity.

99
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,896
These guys
end up ruling the world.

100
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:14,065
Presidents, senators, lords!

101
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,434
(Sniffing)

102
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:17,902
Look, I'm going to go
look for Anne.

103
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:21,706
Mark, pump him so full of drugs
that he does exactly what I ask.

104
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,283
MARK:
If Jack gets in to
these trust fund pricks.

105
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:35,152
I can finish off
a shitload more of my stuff.

106
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:39,390
Too early to process
your bullshit.

107
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,160
Class. Class.
Class!

108
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:45,162
I know why they chose
Donald Hallford.

109
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:48,065
He symbolizes everything
that is wrong

110
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,501
with the United States
of America.

111
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,002
You have any thoughts on how we
are going to move this fucker?

112
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,303
He probably weighs a ton.

113
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,605
Got steroids?
No.

114
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,873
No, I got some homemade acid

115
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,307
that will make you feel
like Superman.

116
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:59,210
There is a 40 percent chance
you might have an aneurysm.

117
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,050
Class.

118
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,451
No, fuck class!

119
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:09,453
I can teach you
everything you need to know!

120
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:15,393
MAN:
I hope you have all studied,
because Professor Bristor

121
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,729
is going to get to the bottom
of your thoughts on philosophy.

122
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,832
And even Mr. Parsons.

123
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,735
Since we have not seen or heard
from you since fraternity week,

124
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,571
maybe you would like to expound
philosophy of the Greeks.

125
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,073
The Greeks believed
that it is neither a short life

126
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,307
nor a long life.

127
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:33,377
There is only the life
that you have.

128
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:35,079
And what kind of life
do we have, Jack?

129
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,981
I quote Aeschylus:

130
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:39,884
"The life you were given
is the perfect life."

131
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:41,753
If you work with it, it has got
its own shape, its own arc.

132
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,187
It's perfect.

133
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,623
Ah, that is quite an original
take on the text, Jack.

134
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:48,059
But what happens when this
perfect life comes to an end?

135
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,562
Death is not the end
to the Greeks.

136
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:54,265
They see the soul or person
inhabiting the body

137
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,167
as a sort of a pilot.

138
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,604
Tacitus even said that some men
are born posthumously.

139
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,072
Do you know
what occurs to me, Jack?

140
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,441
If you were to stay away
from the parties,

141
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,677
you might even
have a brain.

142
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,711
Who gives a fuck then?

143
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,946
About what?

144
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,346
About what we do
in this life,

145
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:11,215
because the next one is going
to be better no matter what.

146
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,051
"Call no man happy
until he is dead!"

147
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,053
"Lay not treasures
upon the Earth!"

148
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:19,123
"Love, seek it not itself
to please,

149
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:22,694
but build a heaven
in hell's despair!"

150
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,597
Thank you, Mr. Parsons.

151
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,864
That was William Blake,

152
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,701
for those of you
scoring along at home.

153
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,838
So if that is the end
of today's outburst--

154
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,506
Well, this is all
just practice.

155
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,775
What does anything matter,
like coming to class?

156
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:38,843
Well, none.

157
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,411
Except that then
maybe finally

158
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:42,346
I could get you thrown out
of this college!

159
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:46,150
I can take away
your perfect little life.

160
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:51,956
Of course, according to Tacitus,
I'd be doing you a favour.

161
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:54,058
Are you threatening me?

162
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,028
No, of course not, sir.

163
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:01,833
All right,
you have got your papers.

164
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,167
Let us start.

165
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,837
I can't lose.

166
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:25,822
So you are thinking about
going into medicine?

167
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:27,391
Sure.

168
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:30,094
I could lose an entire weekend
in my dad's medicine cabinet.

169
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:31,895
Where the hell do you think
you are going?

170
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:33,664
Relax.
It's a shortcut.

171
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,666
Shortcut, my ass!

172
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:44,708
I'm going to spend
all the money I can,

173
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:47,378
which my family has made
over the last 300 years.

174
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:48,446
Are you serious?

175
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,014
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Yeah?

176
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:52,816
And also marry Anne,
and make her my princess.

177
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:56,554
I'll get my girl
once I get my Benz.

178
00:10:56,555 --> 00:11:00,924
Oh, and my 911 Porsche
with 33-inch tires.

179
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:02,426
A Ferrari...

180
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:05,496
Your dad is going to have to mow
a million lawns for that shit.

181
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:07,098
Shh!
There she is.

182
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:21,678
(Dance music playing)

183
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:40,297
Oh, boy.

184
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:47,804
Word around campus is that
a couple of fraternity pledges

185
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:49,306
were spotted diving off
the roof of the Chem Lab

186
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:50,574
into a nearby dumpster.

187
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,510
Crazy kids.

188
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,044
Their parents
must have given them peyote.

189
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:56,347
I understand Freddy's need
to submit himself

190
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,782
to these idiotic initiation
rights,

191
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:01,152
but I would assume
that you would mock

192
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,853
that sort of behaviour.

193
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:06,257
You should know,
my dear sweet Anne,

194
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,325
why this is important to me.

195
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:10,394
Freddy.

196
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:12,929
I'm going to class,
but I just--

197
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,798
I just wanted to plant a seed

198
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,468
about rethinking
this whole fraternity thing.

199
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,370
Plant all you want,
but my fields are barren,

200
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,673
as far as growing any kind of
deep thoughts are concerned.

201
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:28,879
The sad thing is that
you might actually mean that.

202
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:36,320
I can't get
a read on Anne lately.

203
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:38,955
She seems so distracted.

204
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,558
I need to make my move,
you know?

205
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,092
I need to do something
so bold

206
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:43,760
that it will be impossible
for her to ignore.

207
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:44,895
Well, shit, man,
what's the rush?

208
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:47,264
It has only been, what?
Ten years?

209
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:51,034
Do you ever wonder about
Jack and Freddy?

210
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:52,336
In what way?

211
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,171
Are they really just
a couple of homos,

212
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:55,506
fucking with our minds?

213
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:56,873
(Laughing)

214
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,309
You can answer that last one,

215
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,678
seeing as how you are
Jack's current conquest.

216
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,314
Conquest implies
he had to fight to get me.

217
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:08,118
What the fuck are you doing?
That's cat food!

218
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,554
The brothers need dip,
pledge.

219
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:11,755
Fine.
Well, in that case...

220
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:13,890
(Laughing)

221
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:15,559
Not to sound like
a total slut,

222
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,661
which is so hard
because I'm one,

223
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,630
but I would not mind
being the meat

224
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,298
on a Jack and Freddy sandwich.

225
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:24,635
A little rich man,
poor man action, you know?

226
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:27,170
I think you need to
think real hard about

227
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:29,540
what it is that you need
in a relationship.

228
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,309
Otherwise, someone is just going
to end up getting hurt.

229
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,111
Wow.

230
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:36,247
You are such
an uptight bitch.

231
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,815
Can't you take off the halo
for one second?

232
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:47,291
You want to see the horns?

233
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:49,993
(Laughing)

234
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,607
Don't fuck with Jack.

235
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:04,742
It's too bad
we don't have any salt.

236
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:07,144
It's not a problem, man.

237
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:10,881
(Urinating)

238
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,342
Are you hot?

239
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,444
No, man, I'm just fat.

240
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:22,786
What about
that girl over there?

241
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:24,521
The one with the nipples
that could cut glass.

242
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:25,789
Those are nipple rings.

243
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,790
(Coughing)

244
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,592
Bullshit, man.
How do you know?

245
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:30,093
Because I just got finished
chewing on them

246
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:31,261
a couple of hours ago.

247
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:33,096
(Laughing)

248
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:35,265
You get me through all of this
fucking initiation bullshit,

249
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:37,100
I will see what I can do
about you and nipple rings.

250
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:41,137
Yeah?

251
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:42,239
(Cheering)

252
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:58,154
Hey!
Man, hey!

253
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:00,190
I don't care
what they say about you, man!

254
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:02,593
I'm glad you are going to be
a brother.

255
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,562
Honour, respect, privilege
right?

256
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:07,330
Privilege.
Hey, no hard feelings, man!

257
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:08,866
Abso-fucking-lutely,
man.

258
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,769
Is this dip?
I fucking love dip!

259
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,270
Thanks, man!

260
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,314
Yeah. Well done, man.
Well done.

261
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:26,417
Now go get the fucking hose,
pledge!

262
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:28,852
You're my complete hero.

263
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:30,120
You know that,
don't you?

264
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:25,042
YOUNG JACK:
Anne is going to make you
a great first wife.

265
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:26,776
YOUNG FREDDY:
If she will ever put out.

266
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:29,146
I'm not buying the cow
until I get some milk.

267
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:31,548
That is the most perverted thing
I've ever heard of!

268
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:33,984
She said she's going to save it
until we get engaged.

269
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:35,685
When will that be?

270
00:17:35,686 --> 00:17:37,187
Straight after university.

271
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:39,689
Oh?
Congratulations.

272
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,824
Does she know?

273
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:42,893
Well, there's no need
to tell her.

274
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,895
I'm not going to take no
for an answer.

275
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:09,853
You scared the shit
out of me!

276
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,989
Do you know
that ancient proverb?

277
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,423
You save somebody's life,

278
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:16,860
you are responsible for them
for the rest of their life?

279
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:18,862
You're an asshole.

280
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:20,364
You do this to yourself.

281
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:29,739
Actually, a buddy of mine
made this.

282
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,441
It actually stimulates
the part of the brain

283
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,743
they call the "uber-brain"
by the Germans.

284
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:35,112
Does it work?

285
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:37,114
Well, they almost
made it to Moscow, didn't they?

286
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:47,457
FREDDY:
So how was it?

287
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,591
What?

288
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:50,260
Wherever it is
that you've been.

289
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,898
I don't remember.

290
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:57,234
Why do you always pass out
on your face like that?

291
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:04,174
Because if you pass out
on your back,

292
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:06,543
you can asphyxiate
on your own vomit.

293
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:15,352
Let us make more memories.

294
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:18,956
Sure.

295
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,657
Whose car are we borrowing?

296
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:24,328
Uh, Miller's.
I bumped into him.

297
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,862
Let's hope it's decent.

298
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:27,297
What is a decent car?

299
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:30,300
A sports car, a four by four,
a rear-wheel drive?

300
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:31,501
You know what
the best cars are?

301
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,937
Somebody else's.

302
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:35,839
What the fuck
is Bristor doing?

303
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,307
Well, he's got to
earn a living.

304
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:40,944
What kind of car
would Miller drive?

305
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:43,246
(Beeping)

306
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:46,749
Jackpot.

307
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,485
See what kind of trouble
we can get into.

308
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,912
(Chirping)

309
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,797
I've been
looking for you.

310
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:37,867
Well?
What?

311
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:39,936
Come on, Jack,
just own up to it.

312
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:41,638
To what?

313
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:42,805
You really don't remember?

314
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,410
Remember what?

315
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,711
Maybe you hit your head
harder than I thought.

316
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:51,081
My head?

317
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:53,816
Jack, you were
driving the car!

318
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,885
What car, man?

319
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:06,029
Have you got Donald?

320
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:10,700
Yeah, yeah.

321
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,335
Well, get ready,
we have got to go.

322
00:21:25,516 --> 00:21:27,917
(Clearing throat)

323
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:29,286
What the fuck is that?

324
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,388
Donald Hallford,
in the flesh.

325
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,722
Oh, are you
fucking serious?

326
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:33,856
Bones, brother.

327
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:35,592
I take my fucking
very seriously.

328
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:37,394
Hey, hey, hey!
Shut the fuck up!

329
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:40,630
When I said,
"Bring me Donald Hallford."

330
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:43,300
I want Donald Hallford,
not just his fucking head!

331
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,468
Let's vote!

332
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,269
Is the skull
of Donald Hallford enough?

333
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,605
Nah.
I got it.

334
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:49,706
Sorry, man.

335
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:57,314
Brother, how far would you say
you are from your feet?

336
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:00,883
About five feet, ten inches.

337
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:02,986
And from your chest?

338
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:04,654
I don't know,
about a foot.

339
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:06,889
So if you were to describe
the locus point of you,

340
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,924
you would say that
you are in your voice,

341
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:09,959
which comes out of your mouth,
yes?

342
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,528
What the fuck?

343
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:13,062
Just bear with me,
Einstein,

344
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:15,298
or the Potemkin goes down
for the count.

345
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,867
When you say that you are five
feet, ten inches from your feet,

346
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:22,506
that's ridiculous, because your
feet are a part of you, right?

347
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,507
Yeah.

348
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,342
But you naturally assume

349
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,244
that your feet
are not a part of you,

350
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,512
they are "over there."

351
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,615
"Dipso" facto,

352
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:35,218
we can assume
that before he died,

353
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:38,288
Donald Hallford too believed
that he existed only

354
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:40,323
in his mind, in his head.

355
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:42,292
And so in bringing you
the head of Donald Hallford,

356
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:45,228
I have brought you
the himmest part of him,

357
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:47,264
the he-ist part of he,

358
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,400
as confirmed by your
characterization of your feet

359
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:51,768
as "over there."

360
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,070
You confirmed that existence
occurs only between the ears,

361
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:56,906
and that the rest of the body
is but a support mechanism.

362
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,647
I don't know what
the fuck you just said, but,

363
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:08,151
either way, there has got to be
a penalty clause.

364
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:10,187
There's always
a penalty clause, man.

365
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:14,157
A late arrival, plus no body,
it is double the mission.

366
00:23:14,158 --> 00:23:15,925
Fuck it.
Me and Don are out of here.

367
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:17,460
No great loss.
No!

368
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:18,528
Wait, wait!
Wait!

369
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:20,797
Look, this is
too fucking important.

370
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:22,432
Don't let them get to you.

371
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:24,967
We said we were going to
do this together.

372
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:26,469
Go.

373
00:23:29,607 --> 00:23:31,508
You can't get rid of me
that easy.

374
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:35,445
Someone jacked my car.

375
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:37,314
Pretty witty, bitch.

376
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:44,120
Tell them you want to use
Rule Four.

377
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,357
Trust me, Rule Four.

378
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:49,593
What about Rule Four?

379
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,395
Rule Four?
Rule Four.

380
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:54,964
Fuck, man!
Fuck Rule Four!

381
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:57,267
Fuck Rule Four.
Fuck you.

382
00:23:57,268 --> 00:23:58,668
No offence,

383
00:23:58,669 --> 00:23:59,836
but you're a little
too hairy for me, brother.

384
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:02,038
That's my boy.
Don't break down.

385
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:05,609
You sure you can handle
Rule Four?

386
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,577
I can handle anything
your grey matter wants to

387
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:09,346
squirt out at me, bro.

388
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,751
Steal some more wheels, bitch.

389
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:17,554
And swipe some balls
while you are at it.

390
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,391
You're going air bagging.

391
00:24:21,392 --> 00:24:22,492
All right!

392
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:24,361
He's going
air bagging, man!

393
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,895
How do you like that?
(Cheering)

394
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,934
Yeah!

395
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:35,204
You look a little sick, man.

396
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:36,339
Something you ate?

397
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:54,924
Did you catch a buzz yet?

398
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:13,910
I can feel the rings
on my fingers,

399
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:17,481
even the ones
I'm not wearing.

400
00:25:21,652 --> 00:25:23,586
Why do we do so much shit?

401
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:24,821
Because I'm a shaman.

402
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:29,792
Don't shake your head
when I say that, I'm serious.

403
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,995
I'm shaking my hair.
I crossed the river of death,

404
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:33,530
and I steal sand
and I bring it back,

405
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:37,401
and I'll build you castles
you will never live in.

406
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,136
Shamans don't drive cars.

407
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,770
In America they do.

408
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:42,005
The others are just pussies,

409
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:43,606
humming naked prayers
in the dark,

410
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:45,242
while walking
from somewhere to nowhere

411
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:48,878
at the slowest of speeds.

412
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:52,015
If you're a shaman,

413
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:53,683
what am I?

414
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:56,153
You are my muse.

415
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,521
A muse.

416
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:00,023
That's right,
we're "a-musing" together.

417
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:05,862
Are we ready?

418
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:07,830
Freddy's not here yet.

419
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:09,433
Ain't one girlfriend
enough for you?

420
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,539
Got meth?

421
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,006
No, this is
my own special shit.

422
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:19,742
This is
motor neuron stimulants.

423
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:21,778
This is motor crazy shit.

424
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,146
For the car?

425
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,814
No. DSD.

426
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:27,784
It is kind of like
what they give fighter pilots,

427
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:29,619
to make their nerves
and their reflexes sharp.

428
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,556
To sharpen up their reflexes.

429
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,958
It is kind of like speed,
you know,

430
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:38,462
but they take all the crazy
energy from the neurons,

431
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,363
and they make them--
Make them stronger,

432
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:41,465
instead of weaker.

433
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,632
Make them stronger,

434
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:43,700
'cause they're weaker.

435
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,168
What is it?
What?

436
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:46,169
This makes me smarter?

437
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,404
No, faster.

438
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,540
Let me try it.
Wait, let me--

439
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,409
No, just see what happens.

440
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,344
I haven't tasted
this shit yet.

441
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:00,783
Excuse me.

442
00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:03,220
Remember, ladies,
only pussies can't drive 55.

443
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,122
Any less and you're out.

444
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:07,957
Go bag it.

445
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:13,096
The inmates have taken over
the asylum.

446
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,306
Thirty-five.

447
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:24,441
Forty.

448
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,042
Fifty!
Fifty-five!

449
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:35,218
Fifty-seven miles.

450
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:39,556
We'll be watching you.

451
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,094
(Engine starting)

452
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:54,604
Honda Prelude, '88 model.

453
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:56,439
It does have the airbag,
right?

454
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,508
Let's find out.

455
00:27:58,509 --> 00:27:59,576
MILLER:
Are you clear on the rules?

456
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:03,079
Man, if I see brake lights,
you lose.

457
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,148
You've got to hit 55.

458
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:07,116
You won't lose
if you can't lose.

459
00:28:09,753 --> 00:28:11,221
(Phone ringing)

460
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,390
Make this extremely quick.

461
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,626
FREDDY:
This ain't no thing
for a speed racer like you.

462
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:18,361
I thought you were gonna
leave me hanging.

463
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:21,898
Just another mission
for our heroes.

464
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,703
You're next.

465
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,573
Oh, click it or ticket.

466
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,241
Thank you, officer.

467
00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:49,359
(Cheering)

468
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,744
MAN:
Jack?

469
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,214
Jack, you made it.

470
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:12,649
Who the fuck are you?

471
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:16,819
You're a lucky man, Jack.

472
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,321
I don't feel lucky.

473
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:21,258
Well, I'm here on behalf of
the fraternity.

474
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,993
I would just like to
ask you a question or two.

475
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:25,862
I almost
fucking killed myself.

476
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:28,298
What more is there
to question?

477
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,601
Well, why do you want to be
a Veritas man?

478
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,672
Veritas gives hope.

479
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:36,740
Hope?

480
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,141
Yeah,
like if you die,

481
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:40,777
you got somebody
to give you a decent burial.

482
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:43,613
Well, you can always
pay people to do that.

483
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:45,882
Yeah, but you can not pay them
to give a fuck.

484
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:50,320
So for you,
fraternity is like a family.

485
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:53,356
Yeah, I guess so.

486
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:55,492
And it's the only one
you've got.

487
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,628
Why don't you tell me why
I want to join Veritas, then.

488
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:00,664
Well, don't you remember
your Latin?

489
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,467
Veritas means truth.

490
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,005
(Phone ringing)

491
00:30:11,074 --> 00:30:12,074
Hello?

492
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:13,075
FREDDY:
Jack?

493
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:14,977
Yeah?

494
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:16,713
Where are you right now?

495
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,815
Um, in bed.

496
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:19,816
Who is this?

497
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,851
It's the Prince of Darkness.

498
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:23,386
Freddy.

499
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:25,154
Hey!

500
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:26,623
Are you alone?

501
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,057
Yeah.

502
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:29,392
You're a fucking liar!

503
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:32,329
You're fucking my girlfriend!

504
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:34,531
You're fucking dead!

505
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:41,204
Are you okay?

506
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:43,239
Yeah.

507
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,642
Nightmare.

508
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,811
What happened?

509
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,779
Freddy was here.

510
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,514
He saw us.

511
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,719
Fuck.
Did I hit my head?

512
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,721
(Chuckling)

513
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,524
It was me.

514
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:03,192
You hit your head?

515
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:05,795
Oh.

516
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:07,797
(Ringing)

517
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:12,502
Hello?

518
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,503
FREDDY:
Are you in bed?

519
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:16,138
Yeah. Why?
Where are you?

520
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:17,440
I'm home.

521
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:18,842
You know,
where the, um,

522
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,077
where the dear
and the aristocracy play.

523
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:22,078
England home?

524
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,246
Well, they--

525
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:24,381
They found my wallet
in Miller's car.

526
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,382
Fuck!

527
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,016
Oh, don't shit a brick.

528
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:28,284
I kept you out of it.

529
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:30,720
But they do know
that somebody else was driving.

530
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:32,154
So, what I suggest you do,

531
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:34,257
is you come over here
whilst it blows over,

532
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:35,492
and lay low in style.

533
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,227
Can you get the natives
to call me "the Ripper"?

534
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:39,496
(Laughing)

535
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,798
I would like you to bring
the rest of the gang.

536
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,834
Tell Mark that there is a
serious need for his expertise.

537
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:46,302
And don't let Anne
say no.

538
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:50,206
Uh, yeah.
I'll make sure she's there.

539
00:31:50,207 --> 00:31:52,575
We'll come
after Bristor's final.

540
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,010
There won't be a final,
Jack.

541
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:55,412
I think you know that now.

542
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,414
I wired you the money.
Start packing.

543
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,815
Okay.

544
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,492
You know that, um,

545
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:13,463
recurring nightmare
I told you about?

546
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:14,964
It's occurring.

547
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,571
Why do I love you?

548
00:32:24,374 --> 00:32:26,375
Because
you smell like milk.

549
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,248
No, really, I'm serious.

550
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:35,151
Milk and smell and scent,

551
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:38,187
it's all the true essence
between two people.

552
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:39,522
There's no bullshit.

553
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:49,599
I love it
when you're serious.

554
00:32:57,908 --> 00:32:58,908
(Phone ringing)

555
00:32:58,909 --> 00:32:59,909
(Yelling)

556
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:07,817
(Screaming)

557
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:19,595
Are you all right, sir?

558
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:23,066
We're about to land.

559
00:34:17,654 --> 00:34:19,222
I'll be right back.

560
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,356
Whoa!

561
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:21,857
Oh, I feel sick.

562
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:23,960
Oh, my God!
Shit!

563
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:27,197
This place has got to have
secret passageways.

564
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,233
VERA:
Where are his folks?

565
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,902
Monaco, Montserrat,
Beverly Hills.

566
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:35,605
Only their psychotherapist
knows for sure.

567
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:52,989
(Laughing)

568
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,224
Hello!

569
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:57,093
You should come up here.
It's so beautiful.

570
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,624
(Door opening)

571
00:35:30,994 --> 00:35:34,264
FREDDY:
Twenty-seven thousand
square feet.

572
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,433
Thirty-seven bedrooms,

573
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:39,502
14 and a half bathrooms.

574
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:40,936
Italian marble.

575
00:35:40,937 --> 00:35:42,672
No Jacuzzi, I'm afraid,

576
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:46,209
but then, I do have
five tennis courts.

577
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,110
I think you're gonna
like it here.

578
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:51,080
Must be a bitch to heat
in the winter.

579
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:53,049
Well, we do have
electricity.

580
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,553
Where's your folks?

581
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,322
Monaco, Geneva,
Beverly Hills.

582
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,058
We've come a long way.

583
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,859
We most definitely have.

584
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,297
Welcome.
Thank you.

585
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,032
(Laughing)

586
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:32,288
(Engines running)

587
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,467
(Laughing)

588
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,370
You've been
ominously quiet.

589
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,138
When have I ever
gotten a word in

590
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,940
around
the Jack and Freddy show?

591
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:25,941
Touché.

592
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:27,710
Hey,
you had me worried.

593
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:29,445
Really!

594
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:30,880
I did?

595
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,848
One morning you were just gone?
Of course I was worried!

596
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:34,183
You're like a brother
to me!

597
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:35,985
Is that a good thing?

598
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:37,820
How can you feel otherwise?

599
00:37:37,821 --> 00:37:40,890
How can you be so confident
around the rest of the world,

600
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,558
and doubt yourself
around me?

601
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:45,728
Someone has to throw me.

602
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:47,163
Look, it's like
Jack always says--

603
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:51,000
Look, pretend for a minute
there is no Jack!

604
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:52,902
Are you saying that Jack has
some sort of control over me?

605
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,370
I didn't mean it
like that.

606
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:58,775
It's just that sometimes
I look at the two of you,

607
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:03,145
and it reminds me of how similar
you both still are

608
00:38:03,146 --> 00:38:05,648
to the 13-year-olds
who used to peek at me

609
00:38:05,649 --> 00:38:07,950
when I was dancing
in my backyard.

610
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,121
You knew about that?

611
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:14,223
Why do you think
I practiced so hard?

612
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:24,967
Close your eyes.

613
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,680
Okay,
now keep them closed.

614
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,818
There's something
I want to show you.

615
00:38:55,298 --> 00:38:58,267
Open your eyes.

616
00:38:58,268 --> 00:39:00,570
Oh, my God!

617
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,572
This is beautiful!

618
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:04,974
Wow!

619
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,784
My grandfather had it built
for my grandmother.

620
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:19,389
She was Italian,
so beautiful.

621
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,758
He loved her more than
anything else in the world.

622
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,059
You never told me this.

623
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,595
Well, it would have
spoiled the surprise.

624
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:28,564
That's not all.

625
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:31,000
He gave her one more thing
before he died.

626
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,374
God, it's beautiful!

627
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,642
I want you to have it.

628
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:42,111
Shh.

629
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:46,949
Don't tell me now.

630
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,485
Tell me tomorrow night

631
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:50,953
at the party.

632
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:19,882
Excuse me.

633
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:23,218
Do you know where I can get
a drink around here?

634
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,060
Two guys, one girl.

635
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,494
An equation whose solution

636
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:34,764
always leaves
someone out in the cold.

637
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:39,835
Yeah, me.

638
00:40:39,836 --> 00:40:42,171
Money always finds happiness.

639
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:55,885
Well, it seems a clear-cut case
of who wants it most.

640
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,188
That's the problem with you
rich, fucking,

641
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:00,923
over- privileged dicks!

642
00:41:00,924 --> 00:41:02,457
It's always about
getting "it"!

643
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,198
We're not even
talking about a--

644
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,234
A house or a car,
or a corporation.

645
00:41:13,303 --> 00:41:14,636
We're talking about a woman.

646
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:19,108
But who says, uh,
"it" is a girl?

647
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,677
What is "it" then?

648
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:24,346
Now, Jack,
this pain I see in your eyes,

649
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:25,881
where does it come from?

650
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:26,949
I don't know.

651
00:41:28,551 --> 00:41:30,219
Yeah!

652
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:25,500
What happened to you?

653
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:27,569
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

654
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,008
I must have blacked out
during a blackout.

655
00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:35,945
Where do you go
when you black out?

656
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,981
It's, uh, stressful.

657
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:44,887
Basketball courts,
swimming pools,

658
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,323
car wrecks, sex.

659
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:50,659
Same shit,
different nightmare.

660
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,462
Then why do you still keep
doing drugs?

661
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:56,131
Drugs are how
a man with no past

662
00:43:56,132 --> 00:43:59,168
faces a world
with no future.

663
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,837
Okay, so

664
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:04,406
if you can still
be all lyrical about it,

665
00:44:04,407 --> 00:44:07,076
then it means
that you're not a drunk.

666
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,780
What's wrong?

667
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:13,849
Nothing.

668
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,785
What's wrong?

669
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:19,154
Freddy asked me
to marry him.

670
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,198
What about us?

671
00:44:31,434 --> 00:44:33,535
You know how I feel
about you, but--

672
00:44:33,536 --> 00:44:35,237
But what?

673
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:39,942
You're an addict.

674
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:40,943
You're an addict,

675
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:43,012
and I don't know
where you are.

676
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,548
Even when you're here with me,
I don't know where you are.

677
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:48,717
You are just another
fucked-up poor kid

678
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:50,719
whose parents
did not care enough

679
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,388
or give him enough
attention.

680
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:56,125
And now, you have some
pathological need

681
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,294
to be the life or the soul

682
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,730
of some party,

683
00:45:01,731 --> 00:45:03,032
only it's just in your mind.

684
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:05,867
I can change, okay?

685
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:08,670
I can be the fucking perfect,

686
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:12,841
well-adjusted,
mature gentleman,

687
00:45:12,842 --> 00:45:17,012
ready to carry you off
to your perfect life.

688
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:20,215
You're planning our future
together when

689
00:45:20,216 --> 00:45:23,518
you can't even remember
what you did the night before.

690
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:25,520
I think I'm entitled to more.

691
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:27,089
You want more?

692
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:29,959
Because
I can give you more.

693
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,327
More is not
a fucking problem!

694
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,962
More is easy!
I can give you more!

695
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:34,363
Stop!

696
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,198
Come here.

697
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:37,732
What am I gonna do
with you?

698
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,017
You're not
making this easy.

699
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,418
I know.

700
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:15,471
Tell me about hell.

701
00:46:18,774 --> 00:46:21,176
Hell is a mall and--

702
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:23,178
(Laughing)

703
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:27,649
and in it, outside it,
all around it,

704
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:30,986
there are bums and geeks,

705
00:46:30,987 --> 00:46:32,954
and they kind of want to get in

706
00:46:32,955 --> 00:46:36,291
because they have to
beg for money,

707
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:39,561
or for someone to kill them,

708
00:46:39,562 --> 00:46:42,097
because they're too scared
to go inside.

709
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:48,570
So is this like a strip mall,
or is this a regular mall?

710
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:52,341
It's like a Jersey mall,

711
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,710
only first you have to
cross a river.

712
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:57,712
The river is round.

713
00:46:57,713 --> 00:46:59,714
Like a moat?
Yeah.

714
00:47:28,945 --> 00:47:31,146
MAN (Quietly):
Jack! Jack!

715
00:47:31,147 --> 00:47:32,948
Jack!

716
00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:35,451
The bathtub ate Vera.

717
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:36,651
I need some salt.

718
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,524
Listen, listen, listen,
baby.

719
00:47:42,525 --> 00:47:43,858
Come on,
listen to my voice.

720
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:45,127
You have got a pulse,
you're doing okay!

721
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,596
Party.

722
00:47:47,597 --> 00:47:49,731
Hospital!
No, no, no, no!

723
00:47:49,732 --> 00:47:51,633
When's the last time
you've been to a hospital?

724
00:47:51,634 --> 00:47:53,868
I don't remember.

725
00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:54,869
Have you got a fucking watch?

726
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,171
No!

727
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:57,306
Want me to go look for
a watch?

728
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,807
I'm just trying
to fucking help!

729
00:47:58,808 --> 00:48:00,041
You want to fucking help?

730
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:01,276
Get her some fucking
sodium chloride, all right?

731
00:48:01,277 --> 00:48:03,312
Get some fucking table salt.

732
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:04,313
Hurry the fuck up!

733
00:48:31,107 --> 00:48:32,541
Put the towels
on the ground.

734
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,943
Put the fucking towels--
Come here!

735
00:48:34,944 --> 00:48:36,345
Will you fucking hurry?

736
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:37,846
Close the fucking door!
I need your fucking help!

737
00:48:37,847 --> 00:48:38,847
All right!

738
00:48:38,848 --> 00:48:39,914
What did you give her, man?

739
00:48:39,915 --> 00:48:41,116
Same fuckin' thing
we took.

740
00:48:45,288 --> 00:48:47,656
Up straight,
aim your body straight!

741
00:48:47,657 --> 00:48:49,324
Can't even
get a vein up.

742
00:48:51,427 --> 00:48:52,461
She looks like shit.

743
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,129
Listen, she can hear us
in there.

744
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,730
You have got to fucking
keep it positive.

745
00:48:55,731 --> 00:48:57,366
There is nothing else
we can do now

746
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,268
until the saline cycle
is through.

747
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,935
Fuck it, let's just
crack open another 40

748
00:49:00,936 --> 00:49:02,771
or smoke some kill!

749
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:04,540
Or some champagne,
that'll do!

750
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,408
Where did you get
fucking ice, man?

751
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:08,243
I've been looking all over
this country for fucking ice

752
00:49:08,244 --> 00:49:09,744
since we got here!

753
00:49:09,745 --> 00:49:12,347
The Europeans aren't as obsessed
with refrigeration.

754
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:13,715
Yeah, clearly!

755
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,320
(Gurgling)

756
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:20,656
Fuck!

757
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,224
(Coughing)

758
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,159
Hey!
Hey, baby!

759
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:27,128
Why am I in
an ice bucket?

760
00:49:27,129 --> 00:49:28,397
No, no.
No sleeping.

761
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:29,898
We gotta keep her talking,
Jack, come on.

762
00:49:29,899 --> 00:49:31,766
I want one of them.

763
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:32,767
Yeah!

764
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:38,473
Jesus Christ!

765
00:49:39,975 --> 00:49:41,076
Hi.

766
00:49:42,078 --> 00:49:44,179
VERA:
Your halo's crooked.

767
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,181
(Laughing)

768
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:58,827
Obviously, you have a problem
with authority.

769
00:49:58,828 --> 00:50:00,495
Who doesn't?

770
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:02,831
You think you're smarter
than anyone, don't you?

771
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:06,235
Including me,
no doubt.

772
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:09,304
I think you have a problem
about telling the truth.

773
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:12,407
What are you implying?

774
00:50:12,408 --> 00:50:13,708
Lying.

775
00:50:13,709 --> 00:50:15,610
Oh, excuse me, nurse,

776
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:17,279
would you mind
turning that volume down?

777
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,881
Thank you.

778
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:22,717
We'll ring
when we need you.

779
00:50:26,956 --> 00:50:31,059
Now,
that maid you remember,

780
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,862
did she tell you her name?

781
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:35,130
Marisol.

782
00:50:35,131 --> 00:50:37,499
Marisol.
That is a beautiful name.

783
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,901
Beautiful.

784
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,435
Spanish, is that right?

785
00:50:42,505 --> 00:50:43,538
I don't know.

786
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,540
You don't know.

787
00:50:47,343 --> 00:50:48,610
Let me tell you something,
Jack.

788
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:51,980
In the Brotherhood,
we can't abide secrets,

789
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:55,750
because secrets,
they have a habit of

790
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:58,220
creeping back
and haunting you.

791
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,222
I don't have any secrets.

792
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,590
Jack, you do.

793
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,861
You do, Jack.

794
00:51:08,164 --> 00:51:10,098
You know what happened
to that girl, Jack.

795
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:22,911
When you woke up
by the pier,

796
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:26,148
Marisol had not just
disappeared, had she?

797
00:51:30,653 --> 00:51:32,620
JACK:
She was no longer there.

798
00:51:32,621 --> 00:51:37,125
I don't know how else
you could describe that.

799
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:39,661
You know what happened
to that girl, Jack.

800
00:51:57,513 --> 00:51:59,848
You know, I really am
a fan of the grunge look, Jack,

801
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:02,917
but I was kind of hoping you
might go dapper for the evening.

802
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:09,124
We had
a little problem upstairs.

803
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:14,329
Vera almost Joplin'd,
and then when that didn't work,

804
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:18,033
she tried to drown herself
in the bathtub.

805
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:21,736
Yes, she really is a fuck up at
anything but fucking, isn't she?

806
00:52:21,737 --> 00:52:24,339
That was pretty cold.

807
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,609
Are you defending
your sex doll?

808
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,511
You know, I could always
loan you ten pounds,

809
00:52:29,512 --> 00:52:31,413
and you can go
and buy another one.

810
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:34,282
Only this time,
please buy one that can't talk.

811
00:52:34,283 --> 00:52:35,917
You know,
it's good to know

812
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:38,120
that even when
you're playing dress-up,

813
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,455
the prick in you
doesn't die.

814
00:52:40,456 --> 00:52:43,858
Oh, this prick
will never die, dog.

815
00:52:46,662 --> 00:52:49,197
Gosh.

816
00:52:49,198 --> 00:52:52,300
I'm shaking like a crack ho
at a methadone clinic.

817
00:52:55,638 --> 00:52:57,506
This is it, amigo.

818
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,775
I feel like my whole life has
been building up to this moment.

819
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,881
We need to talk.

820
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,851
Why?
What have you done?

821
00:53:09,852 --> 00:53:13,121
And how much of my money
will it take to make it go away?

822
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,460
It's about Anne.

823
00:53:21,564 --> 00:53:23,665
What about Anne?

824
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,935
We, um--

825
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,215
If it makes a difference--
Jack.

826
00:53:42,985 --> 00:53:44,986
First rule of Veritas,

827
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:49,124
"Brothers before others."

828
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:56,264
Brothers before others.

829
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,074
Why don't you get dressed?

830
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:41,169
Hey, what is in that stuff
you're giving them?

831
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:44,372
Well, there is tryptamine
and there's dimethyltryptamine.

832
00:55:44,373 --> 00:55:46,675
You trip.
Know what I mean?

833
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,376
"Di" means two,
and "methyl" became popular

834
00:55:48,377 --> 00:55:50,378
from its lesser cousin,
simply known as meth.

835
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:52,013
Essence and speed.

836
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:53,948
Twice, hold the cow shit.

837
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:55,817
My friends have such an intimate
relationship with their drugs.

838
00:55:55,818 --> 00:55:57,185
You drink alcohol.

839
00:55:57,186 --> 00:55:58,687
Everything I make in my lab
is just the same.

840
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,422
It's not just the same!

841
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,357
What you make in your lab
is hardcore illegal drugs.

842
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,659
Hardcore, softcore.
Drugs are a conduit.

843
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,793
No, he's right.

844
00:56:05,794 --> 00:56:09,097
Psilocybin mushrooms
grow in cow shit.

845
00:56:09,098 --> 00:56:11,866
Apes would eat
these mushrooms.

846
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:14,369
Must be where the term
"some good shit" comes from.

847
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,105
Anne.
Should we tell everybody?

848
00:56:17,106 --> 00:56:19,541
What?
About us.

849
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,775
(Laughing)

850
00:56:20,776 --> 00:56:22,244
Us? What, us?

851
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:27,682
Ladies and gentlemen,

852
00:56:27,683 --> 00:56:28,683
(Clinking glass)

853
00:56:28,684 --> 00:56:31,018
I have an announcement
to make.

854
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:32,387
Or is it a confession?

855
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:34,989
You see,
I have asked Anne,

856
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:39,494
if she would do me
the unfathomable honour

857
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:41,963
of becoming my wife.

858
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:43,131
Cheers!
No, no.

859
00:56:43,132 --> 00:56:45,500
You see, she has yet
to give me a reply.

860
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:48,202
But she has promised
to let me know this evening.

861
00:56:48,203 --> 00:56:52,073
So all that remains
in the presence of my dearest,

862
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:53,375
most cherished

863
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:57,345
and trusted friends,

864
00:56:57,346 --> 00:57:00,148
is for me to humbly
beseech her response.

865
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:02,784
Providing, of course,
there are no objections.

866
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:14,629
Anne, this could be
our wedding party.

867
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:18,300
This could be our final
"bon voyage" to the wild life.

868
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:22,036
One final fling before
we wave goodbye to childhood.

869
00:57:22,037 --> 00:57:24,773
Anne, be with me,
please!

870
00:57:34,216 --> 00:57:36,318
Just as I thought.

871
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,119
Ladies and gentlemen,

872
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,222
Jack, the lad,
is fucking my girlfriend!

873
00:57:43,091 --> 00:57:45,360
Freddy,
don't do it, man.

874
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:48,563
You ungrateful little cunt!

875
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:51,065
I gave you everything
you could possibly ever want!

876
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:53,501
But you had to take the one
thing that I did not offer you!

877
00:57:53,502 --> 00:57:55,470
Freddy, calm down.
Freddy, please, man!

878
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:57,372
I feel like I've gone to hell
already, and I'm dead!

879
00:57:57,373 --> 00:58:00,975
Mark, can we fucking smoke
a joint over here or something?

880
00:58:00,976 --> 00:58:03,110
Jack, I'm going out of
my fucking head, here!

881
00:58:03,111 --> 00:58:04,612
What do you want me
to fucking do about it?

882
00:58:04,613 --> 00:58:07,148
It's not my fault! I didn't--
Yes, you did!

883
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:10,418
I did all of this so that
I could get close to you!

884
00:58:10,419 --> 00:58:12,787
This is bad.
This is bad, dude!

885
00:58:12,788 --> 00:58:15,690
Fucking water
or something for...

886
00:58:15,691 --> 00:58:18,793
If by bad, you mean, good,

887
00:58:18,794 --> 00:58:20,795
then, yes, it is.

888
00:58:23,432 --> 00:58:25,500
You're fucking out of your mind
right now!

889
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:26,868
You don't think
I've known about you and Anne

890
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:28,202
all of this time?

891
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:29,671
This isn't about me and her,
about me and you!

892
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,139
Freddy, why don't you get
yourself a fucking life?

893
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,541
That's exactly what
I intend to do.

894
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,615
MAN:
Get over here!
Come over here!

895
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,320
(Screaming)

896
00:59:07,342 --> 00:59:10,111
MAN:
This pain I see in your eyes,
where does it come from?

897
00:59:10,112 --> 00:59:11,379
I don't know.

898
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,149
The boozing, the partying,
the fornicating,

899
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,817
it doesn't alleviate it?

900
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:17,952
No, it just makes me numb.

901
00:59:17,953 --> 00:59:19,754
Your father was a gardener,
wasn't he?

902
00:59:19,755 --> 00:59:21,756
Yeah.

903
00:59:21,757 --> 00:59:24,125
So how could the son
of a gardener afford

904
00:59:24,126 --> 00:59:25,727
to go to
such a prestigious college?

905
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,729
Scholarship program.

906
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,333
Your best friend
paid your fees.

907
00:59:32,334 --> 00:59:34,869
So?

908
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:38,773
Well, I guess he always
felt guilty after the accident.

909
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:44,345
So tell me,
what happened in your childhood?

910
00:59:44,346 --> 00:59:46,915
Nothing.

911
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,917
And who was Simon?

912
00:59:52,955 --> 00:59:54,823
I don't know
who you're talking about.

913
01:00:07,302 --> 01:00:09,270
Hi, guys!
I was hoping you would be here.

914
01:00:09,271 --> 01:00:10,338
How're you doing,
Simon?

915
01:00:10,339 --> 01:00:12,073
Anne looks great,
doesn't she?

916
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:14,075
Look, Simon,
Jack and I are having a talk

917
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:16,344
about some private stuff.
Maybe you could get--

918
01:00:16,345 --> 01:00:18,179
Did you hear about
the big contest?

919
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,748
What contest?

920
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,216
We are going to see who can
hold their breath the longest

921
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:22,516
in the pool.

922
01:00:22,517 --> 01:00:25,386
The winner gets five minutes
in heaven with Anne.

923
01:00:25,387 --> 01:00:27,288
Oh, yeah?
Who decided that?

924
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:29,858
Anne.
She called me last night,

925
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,192
to ask me if I thought
it was a good idea.

926
01:00:31,193 --> 01:00:33,394
Anne phoned you last night?

927
01:00:33,395 --> 01:00:34,796
We talk almost every day.

928
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,731
Well, if you will
excuse us, Simon,

929
01:00:36,732 --> 01:00:38,967
Jack and I are going to
discuss some exercises

930
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,902
to expand our lung capacity.

931
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,771
Okay, I got you.

932
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,438
May the best man win.

933
01:00:46,942 --> 01:00:48,977
There's no way
Simon can win that contest.

934
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,111
Calls her every night!

935
01:00:50,112 --> 01:00:51,512
Who the hell
does he think he is?

936
01:00:51,513 --> 01:00:53,114
Relax, it's just Simon.

937
01:00:54,616 --> 01:00:56,785
I hope
I can count on you, Jack.

938
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:59,020
I have to be the one
who ends up with Anne.

939
01:00:59,021 --> 01:01:00,221
Whatever you need, buddy.

940
01:01:09,431 --> 01:01:12,934
So, what happened in the pool,
Jack?

941
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:14,735
It was a long time ago.

942
01:01:14,736 --> 01:01:16,637
Yes, but you keep
coming back to it.

943
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:19,573
ANNE:
You all jump in together.

944
01:01:19,574 --> 01:01:22,510
The last one
who comes up wins.

945
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:25,980
JACK:
Can I get a kiss
for good luck?

946
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:31,152
Step forward.

947
01:01:31,153 --> 01:01:32,987
Who brought him?

948
01:01:32,988 --> 01:01:37,225
I apologize.
He's my personal trainer.

949
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:38,726
We'll see how he shapes up.

950
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:44,232
Ready, set,

951
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,266
go!

952
01:02:42,691 --> 01:02:44,492
The truth, Jack,

953
01:02:44,493 --> 01:02:48,229
for once in your cheap, sordid,

954
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,064
miserable little life.

955
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,902
Simon thought that
he could just take her.

956
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,770
Yeah, but you muscled in on her,
didn't you?

957
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:57,405
Didn't you?

958
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,374
And that is really
what's killing you, isn't it?

959
01:03:40,015 --> 01:03:41,649
Is everyone all right?

960
01:03:46,488 --> 01:03:49,757
Fuck you. It's your
goddamn fault we are here!

961
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:53,962
Why couldn't you have broken
the heart of some poor schmuck,

962
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,230
instead of that fucked up rich
kid with the house of horrors?

963
01:03:56,231 --> 01:03:59,200
They locked me up like this
before,

964
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:00,568
and then they put a hose in.

965
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,439
Who is they?

966
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,274
Veritas.

967
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:07,608
They nearly drowned me.

968
01:04:07,609 --> 01:04:09,210
That's what
he's gonna do next.

969
01:04:09,211 --> 01:04:10,644
Who's "he"?

970
01:04:10,645 --> 01:04:11,879
VERA:
How stoned are you?

971
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,814
Freddy, the twisted fuck,
is going to kill us all,

972
01:04:13,815 --> 01:04:15,950
because the love of his life
would rather fuck Jack!

973
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:18,853
Best friends
make the worst enemies.

974
01:04:18,854 --> 01:04:21,122
Who asked you, huh?

975
01:04:24,893 --> 01:04:26,694
Hello!

976
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:28,896
Wait.

977
01:04:28,897 --> 01:04:31,232
Listen.

978
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:33,234
What is it?

979
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:37,472
The birds are gone.

980
01:04:40,575 --> 01:04:42,576
He knows my fears.

981
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:07,668
Out of one box
and in another.

982
01:05:10,672 --> 01:05:13,274
Perfect!
Fucking perfect!

983
01:05:13,275 --> 01:05:16,577
There's got to be a door
or a window.

984
01:05:16,578 --> 01:05:18,212
What do we do now?

985
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:20,348
We should call the police.

986
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,950
It's fucking dead!

987
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:24,952
It must be a holiday
or something.

988
01:05:24,953 --> 01:05:26,954
I have a cell phone!

989
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:31,526
(Beeping)

990
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:32,527
It's wet!

991
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,162
I wonder how it got wet.

992
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,730
My parents are going to freak
unless I call!

993
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:38,566
Don't touch anything!
Don't touch anything!

994
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,034
Assume everything
is a trap!

995
01:05:40,035 --> 01:05:41,702
It's just the wine cellar,
dude!

996
01:05:41,703 --> 01:05:43,071
Listen to him, Mark!

997
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:44,738
Jack knows Freddy
better than anyone!

998
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:49,243
VERA:
Right now, I wish I had never
met any of you assholes.

999
01:05:49,244 --> 01:05:51,779
MARK:
Look, Freddy is just
yanking our chain.

1000
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,548
Any second,
the door is going to open up,

1001
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,283
he is going to be there with
a great big smile on his face,

1002
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,017
and the joke is on us,
and the party continues.

1003
01:05:57,018 --> 01:05:58,018
JACK:
Do not kid yourself.

1004
01:05:58,019 --> 01:06:00,588
Freddy is capable of
very bad things.

1005
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:01,589
VERA:
What does that mean,
Jack?

1006
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:03,291
Jack, what are you saying?

1007
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:07,328
Jack? Jack? Jack?

1008
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:10,664
Jack? Jack, get up!

1009
01:06:10,665 --> 01:06:12,133
Jack?

1010
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:15,536
And you, uh, really think
you killed that kid?

1011
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:17,638
That wasn't Simon.

1012
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:20,308
I killed him.
I swear, I killed him!

1013
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:23,711
No.
That wasn't Simon, Jack.

1014
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,015
JACK:
I am going to lose
my fucking mind, I swear!

1015
01:06:28,016 --> 01:06:31,452
And yet, you swear.
By what do you swear?

1016
01:06:31,453 --> 01:06:33,654
By your honour?

1017
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:37,057
By your drugged-out,

1018
01:06:37,058 --> 01:06:40,361
wasted little ingrate life,

1019
01:06:40,362 --> 01:06:43,164
could happily fuck
the only girl

1020
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,066
his only friend
had ever loved?

1021
01:06:46,067 --> 01:06:48,503
You really like
jerking the world off,

1022
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,872
don't you, Jack?

1023
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:07,421
Jack?

1024
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:09,556
Jack?

1025
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:13,794
You need to stay with us,
Jack.

1026
01:07:13,795 --> 01:07:14,995
We sure can pick our men.

1027
01:07:16,364 --> 01:07:18,232
MARK:
What happened, bud?

1028
01:07:18,233 --> 01:07:19,233
Nightmare.

1029
01:07:19,234 --> 01:07:22,136
Yeah?
What did you see?

1030
01:07:22,137 --> 01:07:24,338
A tunnel of light.

1031
01:07:24,339 --> 01:07:26,607
It is common for people who
survive a near death experience

1032
01:07:26,608 --> 01:07:27,808
to say the same thing.

1033
01:07:27,809 --> 01:07:30,244
"A tunnel of light
calls to me."

1034
01:07:30,245 --> 01:07:32,146
It's a collective memory.

1035
01:07:32,147 --> 01:07:34,215
Where do these
tunnels of light go?

1036
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,383
What is the light
at the end of the tunnel?

1037
01:07:36,384 --> 01:07:37,785
Are you really awake, Jack?

1038
01:07:39,654 --> 01:07:40,955
I'm just fucking with you.

1039
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:43,423
Look, don't touch anything,
man.

1040
01:07:43,424 --> 01:07:44,759
Vera, come here.

1041
01:07:46,795 --> 01:07:48,896
This is exactly
what we need.

1042
01:07:48,897 --> 01:07:50,965
Mark, use what's left
of your brain for once

1043
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:52,466
and get over here!

1044
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:55,335
MARK:
You know, I guess
they get paid in wine over here.

1045
01:07:55,336 --> 01:07:57,171
That's why nothing works.

1046
01:07:57,172 --> 01:07:59,006
See, we're not
drunk enough yet.

1047
01:07:59,007 --> 01:08:00,674
That's my theory.

1048
01:08:00,675 --> 01:08:02,376
If we get completely wasted--

1049
01:08:02,377 --> 01:08:04,378
That phone over there
is not fucking working.

1050
01:08:09,217 --> 01:08:11,518
1875.

1051
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:13,954
Do you realize how pickled
our brain is going to be

1052
01:08:13,955 --> 01:08:14,955
when we drink this?

1053
01:08:14,956 --> 01:08:17,491
Mark, just put it down.

1054
01:08:17,492 --> 01:08:19,493
Let's drink a little bit
to smooth out the edges.

1055
01:08:19,494 --> 01:08:20,828
Listen to Jack.

1056
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:22,863
Hey, Vera, I know
you're always good for a screw,

1057
01:08:22,864 --> 01:08:24,631
but what about a corkscrew?

1058
01:08:24,632 --> 01:08:26,033
Mark!
Bite me!

1059
01:08:26,034 --> 01:08:27,168
Mark!

1060
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:28,635
(Rumbling)

1061
01:08:28,636 --> 01:08:30,971
Mark! Mark!

1062
01:08:58,633 --> 01:08:59,633
This is so cool!

1063
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:04,038
(Screaming)

1064
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,233
(Screaming)

1065
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:06,700
How hard would it have been
to marry the rich boy

1066
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:08,435
and live happily ever after?

1067
01:10:08,436 --> 01:10:10,504
Shut up, Vera.

1068
01:10:13,241 --> 01:10:15,309
You know,
all you had to do was ask.

1069
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:17,278
I would have put on a wig

1070
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:20,547
and dressed
like Miss Uptight over there.

1071
01:10:20,548 --> 01:10:23,583
We would be upstairs
safe and sound,

1072
01:10:23,584 --> 01:10:27,687
instead of wondering which one
of us dies next.

1073
01:10:27,688 --> 01:10:29,589
He had a choice.

1074
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:32,159
You've been Freddy's
since the second he decided

1075
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,294
it was gonna be that way!

1076
01:10:35,463 --> 01:10:38,299
All the money in the world
does not give a person the right

1077
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,100
to decide
another's future for them.

1078
01:10:40,101 --> 01:10:44,104
Then how come it's always us
poor bastards who end up paying?

1079
01:10:58,253 --> 01:10:59,820
We have to get out of here.

1080
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,427
So...

1081
01:11:07,728 --> 01:11:10,831
What is at the end
of the tunnel of light?

1082
01:11:10,832 --> 01:11:13,600
We are born into this world
through a tunnel into light,

1083
01:11:13,601 --> 01:11:16,236
and we leave this world
through a tunnel into light.

1084
01:11:16,237 --> 01:11:19,539
One tunnel just leads
to the next, and the next,

1085
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:23,143
and the next, and the next,
whether we are ready or not.

1086
01:11:23,144 --> 01:11:27,147
The nature of life is that
there is no end to anything.

1087
01:11:30,218 --> 01:11:31,518
Who said that?

1088
01:11:31,519 --> 01:11:33,320
Nobody.

1089
01:11:54,976 --> 01:11:56,543
Freddy!

1090
01:11:56,544 --> 01:11:59,346
Help!

1091
01:11:59,347 --> 01:12:01,348
Damn you!
Let us out!

1092
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,254
Hello!

1093
01:13:08,249 --> 01:13:09,450
Guys?

1094
01:13:16,157 --> 01:13:17,824
It smells like a sewer.

1095
01:13:18,859 --> 01:13:21,095
It's pretty small.

1096
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,263
You can stay
and calculate the circumference,

1097
01:13:23,264 --> 01:13:24,798
but I'm getting
the hell out of here

1098
01:13:24,799 --> 01:13:26,467
so I am not next
on Freddy's to-do list.

1099
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:28,068
I think we should wait.

1100
01:13:28,069 --> 01:13:32,038
I will take questionable odours
over certain death any day.

1101
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:33,707
Hey.

1102
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:36,776
You can guide me into the hole
for once, okay?

1103
01:13:36,777 --> 01:13:38,812
Wait, wait, wait.

1104
01:13:38,813 --> 01:13:41,781
Where did you get this?

1105
01:13:41,782 --> 01:13:44,251
You're such an asshole.

1106
01:13:44,252 --> 01:13:46,220
It is from the doll we won
on the Brighton Boardwalk.

1107
01:13:48,055 --> 01:13:49,189
Jack?

1108
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,161
Are you coming?

1109
01:13:56,297 --> 01:13:59,199
Jack?
Jack, I'm not waiting for you!

1110
01:14:01,102 --> 01:14:02,869
Vera.

1111
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:18,485
Hey!
Hey, I can stand!

1112
01:14:22,823 --> 01:14:26,393
Jack! Anne!

1113
01:14:26,394 --> 01:14:28,695
It's not so bad!

1114
01:14:31,432 --> 01:14:33,099
Hey!

1115
01:14:36,404 --> 01:14:40,174
When I was a kid,
my mom took me school shopping.

1116
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:43,210
There was this pair of Nikes
that I wanted,

1117
01:14:43,211 --> 01:14:44,545
and she wouldn't
get them for me.

1118
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:46,713
She said
they were too expensive.

1119
01:14:46,714 --> 01:14:48,448
So she got me
these fakes instead.

1120
01:14:48,449 --> 01:14:51,885
So I went to school on the first
day, and I had my fakes on,

1121
01:14:51,886 --> 01:14:56,723
and this older kid was like,
"Cool fucking Jeepers, man."

1122
01:14:56,724 --> 01:15:00,561
And I said, "Yeah,"
and I smiled.

1123
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:06,066
Only the ghetto kids
had Jeepers.

1124
01:15:06,067 --> 01:15:08,235
Only the kids
that I made fun of had Jeepers.

1125
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:12,472
And I realized right there

1126
01:15:12,473 --> 01:15:15,275
that I was
one of those kids.

1127
01:15:15,276 --> 01:15:18,812
A born loser.

1128
01:15:28,022 --> 01:15:31,024
It's like
you don't realize it, but

1129
01:15:31,025 --> 01:15:34,127
you smile because

1130
01:15:34,128 --> 01:15:38,532
you can not let them see you
wince when you got to eat shit.

1131
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:41,301
So you just smile,
and you fucking bear it.

1132
01:15:46,641 --> 01:15:48,375
And I remember thinking,

1133
01:15:48,376 --> 01:15:51,378
"Just act like a frat guy,

1134
01:15:51,379 --> 01:15:54,080
act like a fucking frat guy,"

1135
01:15:54,081 --> 01:15:57,150
until you can
get them all back.

1136
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,393
I went home that day
and I said,

1137
01:16:06,394 --> 01:16:08,328
"Mom, you got me
some fucking Jeepers!"

1138
01:16:25,946 --> 01:16:28,214
I'm not gonna
let you die in here, Jack.

1139
01:16:30,685 --> 01:16:32,852
Hey.

1140
01:16:32,853 --> 01:16:34,854
Can't lose, won't lose.

1141
01:16:49,837 --> 01:16:53,373
Anne!

1142
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:55,375
Anne!

1143
01:16:58,913 --> 01:17:00,914
I'm over here.

1144
01:17:07,655 --> 01:17:09,122
Come on.

1145
01:17:25,206 --> 01:17:28,575
You think Mark told Freddy
about us?

1146
01:17:28,576 --> 01:17:29,576
I told him.

1147
01:17:29,577 --> 01:17:30,844
Why?

1148
01:17:30,845 --> 01:17:33,814
Because I felt like
I was losing the race.

1149
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:35,482
I'm not a race!

1150
01:17:39,487 --> 01:17:41,488
Why do you keep
looking behind us?

1151
01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:42,723
Because you never
see it coming.

1152
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:46,460
Do you think Vera made it?

1153
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:48,061
Vera has
the survival instincts

1154
01:17:48,062 --> 01:17:50,196
of a cockroach
during nuclear winter.

1155
01:17:50,197 --> 01:17:54,100
Does that mean, yes?
Does it?

1156
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:33,006
Please! Please!

1157
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,081
Is this it?

1158
01:18:44,552 --> 01:18:46,119
Stay here.

1159
01:18:51,959 --> 01:18:53,126
Jack?

1160
01:18:57,498 --> 01:18:59,098
Jack!

1161
01:19:02,603 --> 01:19:04,303
There is a light
on the other side,

1162
01:19:04,304 --> 01:19:07,541
and there is an opening
in the grate!

1163
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:09,943
It looks like
Vera made it!

1164
01:19:09,944 --> 01:19:12,512
I am not going.
I can't.

1165
01:19:14,615 --> 01:19:15,949
Anne,
we gotta get out of here!

1166
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:16,950
There is not enough room!

1167
01:19:16,951 --> 01:19:18,384
I can't do it!

1168
01:19:22,423 --> 01:19:25,058
Okay.
All right.

1169
01:19:25,059 --> 01:19:26,092
I'll go check it out,
all right?

1170
01:19:26,093 --> 01:19:27,093
Wait!

1171
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,396
I love you.

1172
01:19:38,973 --> 01:19:40,974
(Crying)

1173
01:19:59,727 --> 01:20:00,727
Stop!

1174
01:20:04,632 --> 01:20:05,632
(Screaming)

1175
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:44,303
You scared the shit
out of me!

1176
01:20:45,472 --> 01:20:46,873
How did you do that?

1177
01:20:46,874 --> 01:20:49,575
What?
You were dead!

1178
01:20:49,576 --> 01:20:51,577
You weren't moving!

1179
01:20:51,578 --> 01:20:52,578
What?

1180
01:20:52,579 --> 01:20:53,913
You weren't fucking moving!

1181
01:21:03,524 --> 01:21:05,391
It looks like
we have a winner!

1182
01:21:05,392 --> 01:21:06,793
Yeah!

1183
01:21:06,794 --> 01:21:08,795
(Cheering)

1184
01:21:15,602 --> 01:21:18,437
Why do you always pass out
on your face like that?

1185
01:21:24,078 --> 01:21:27,147
So I don't choke.

1186
01:21:40,594 --> 01:21:43,697
So whose car
are we borrowing?

1187
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:46,166
Miller's.

1188
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:47,834
I hope it's decent.

1189
01:21:47,835 --> 01:21:49,335
Well, what is decent?

1190
01:21:49,336 --> 01:21:52,005
A sports car, a four by four,
a rear-wheel drive?

1191
01:21:52,006 --> 01:21:53,573
Do you know what
the best cars are?

1192
01:21:53,574 --> 01:21:55,508
Somebody else's.

1193
01:21:57,745 --> 01:21:59,846
Why is Bristor here?

1194
01:21:59,847 --> 01:22:01,314
Well, he's got to
earn a living.

1195
01:22:02,516 --> 01:22:05,185
What kind of car
would Miller drive?

1196
01:22:11,525 --> 01:22:12,826
That one.

1197
01:22:18,966 --> 01:22:22,001
Now we come to
the difficult part, Jack,

1198
01:22:22,002 --> 01:22:26,639
and you won't be
the first to falter.

1199
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,474
Can we just
change the subject?

1200
01:22:28,475 --> 01:22:30,643
Well, rules are rules, Jack,

1201
01:22:30,644 --> 01:22:32,411
and if you won't
tell the truth,

1202
01:22:32,412 --> 01:22:36,049
then I am afraid
that I shall have to tell it.

1203
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:45,291
What are you doing
in my car?

1204
01:22:47,494 --> 01:22:49,763
Trying to get it
fired up.

1205
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:52,766
Okay, Mr. Parsons,
that's it.

1206
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:55,869
MAN:
You deliberately

1207
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:58,171
struck your professor

1208
01:22:58,172 --> 01:23:00,706
with a tire iron!

1209
01:23:00,707 --> 01:23:04,144
Eventually
puncturing his lung.

1210
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,112
He died soon after.

1211
01:23:19,593 --> 01:23:22,528
Oh, click it or ticket.

1212
01:23:22,529 --> 01:23:24,397
Thank you, officer.

1213
01:23:45,686 --> 01:23:47,553
Thirty.

1214
01:23:47,554 --> 01:23:50,223
Thirty-five.

1215
01:23:50,224 --> 01:23:52,225
Forty!

1216
01:23:53,227 --> 01:23:55,094
Fifty!

1217
01:23:58,098 --> 01:23:59,132
Fifty-five!

1218
01:23:59,133 --> 01:24:00,333
He's going
too fucking fast!

1219
01:24:02,502 --> 01:24:04,070
Sixty!

1220
01:24:04,071 --> 01:24:05,071
Sixty-five!

1221
01:24:12,512 --> 01:24:14,513
(Cheering)

1222
01:24:16,283 --> 01:24:18,218
Somebody?

1223
01:24:19,987 --> 01:24:21,487
Jack!

1224
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,361
Jack!
Somebody call 9-1-1!

1225
01:24:29,496 --> 01:24:31,530
Are you happy now?
Huh?

1226
01:24:31,531 --> 01:24:33,699
Is this what you need
to get high on yourself?

1227
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,236
Is it?

1228
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:37,803
He was supposed to drive 55.

1229
01:24:39,706 --> 01:24:41,607
He went 72.

1230
01:24:41,608 --> 01:24:44,143
You are so fucked up!

1231
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:49,315
Listen to me, Jack.

1232
01:24:49,316 --> 01:24:51,584
MARK:
He can't hear you!

1233
01:24:51,585 --> 01:24:53,552
Shut the fuck up, Mark!

1234
01:24:53,553 --> 01:24:54,988
Am I back?

1235
01:24:56,857 --> 01:24:58,791
Well, you must be
if you're talking to me.

1236
01:25:00,294 --> 01:25:02,028
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck was that?

1237
01:25:02,029 --> 01:25:03,496
The crystalline amide.

1238
01:25:03,497 --> 01:25:06,232
I had to do a lithium alcohol
hydrogen four mixer,

1239
01:25:06,233 --> 01:25:08,067
and then it crystallized
back into dimethyltryptamine.

1240
01:25:08,068 --> 01:25:10,403
English, man!

1241
01:25:10,404 --> 01:25:13,172
In short,
it is the food of the gods.

1242
01:25:13,173 --> 01:25:14,740
No airbag.
Fuck!

1243
01:25:31,992 --> 01:25:33,692
Don't worry
about the pain, baby!

1244
01:25:33,693 --> 01:25:36,462
Doctor Mark
is going to set you up.

1245
01:25:36,463 --> 01:25:38,097
Have I ever told you about my

1246
01:25:38,098 --> 01:25:41,734
"you can't lose if you
don't lose" philosophy, Anne?

1247
01:25:41,735 --> 01:25:45,838
It's a slogan, Jack,
not a philosophy.

1248
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:54,314
So, Jack,
what can you tell me?

1249
01:25:57,184 --> 01:25:59,152
It is a characteristic
of the human mind

1250
01:25:59,153 --> 01:26:02,422
to hate
the one we have injured.

1251
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:05,125
Oh, very good.
Tacitus.

1252
01:26:10,731 --> 01:26:12,598
Are you here to make sure

1253
01:26:12,599 --> 01:26:15,969
that I do not tell the police
about the Brotherhood?

1254
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:19,239
Veritas does not work
in that way.

1255
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,309
I'm not even a member.

1256
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:24,311
It's still
under consideration.

1257
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:33,954
Professor Bristor
was just an example, but,

1258
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:36,589
you and I know well,
Jack,

1259
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:40,026
that is not
your real secret, is it?

1260
01:26:41,929 --> 01:26:44,530
Do we have a winner?!

1261
01:26:44,531 --> 01:26:46,399
Jesus Christ!

1262
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:57,677
Jack?

1263
01:26:57,678 --> 01:27:00,580
What was all that noise?

1264
01:27:00,581 --> 01:27:03,249
Oh, lord,
look at the stars, Freddy.

1265
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:05,585
Freddy, look at the stars.

1266
01:27:05,586 --> 01:27:08,054
You know,
if one ever did meet God,

1267
01:27:08,055 --> 01:27:10,423
one would have to
congratulate him on those.

1268
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:13,059
Where's the roof?

1269
01:27:15,596 --> 01:27:19,065
That's a very touching
story, Jack.

1270
01:27:19,066 --> 01:27:22,502
You and your friend Freddy
seemed to be guided by angels.

1271
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:25,705
It is a miracle
we both survived.

1272
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:28,808
There was no miracle, Jack.

1273
01:27:28,809 --> 01:27:30,510
So I made some stuff up.

1274
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:31,677
You know,
that's a good thing.

1275
01:27:31,678 --> 01:27:32,778
It means
I didn't kill Bristor,

1276
01:27:32,779 --> 01:27:34,881
it means
I didn't kill Marisol!

1277
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:36,516
Yeah, that's right.

1278
01:27:39,586 --> 01:27:41,321
I can't fucking lose, man!

1279
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:46,759
Jack, why do you think
I'm here?

1280
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,896
I have no fucking idea.

1281
01:27:49,897 --> 01:27:51,431
Ask me.

1282
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:58,971
You killed your best friend,
Jack.

1283
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:05,545
Freddy,
look at the stars.

1284
01:28:07,814 --> 01:28:09,815
Freddy?

1285
01:28:11,018 --> 01:28:12,452
Freddy,
quit fucking around.

1286
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:15,855
Freddy?

1287
01:28:15,856 --> 01:28:19,725
Freddy? Freddy?

1288
01:28:19,726 --> 01:28:21,727
Freddy?

1289
01:28:28,502 --> 01:28:29,802
You killed Freddy.

1290
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:48,521
Congratulations, Jack.

1291
01:28:48,522 --> 01:28:50,523
You made it.

1292
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:56,796
Now, that was not so hard,
was it?

1293
01:29:02,169 --> 01:29:03,503
What about the police?

1294
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:05,972
Oh, the police
won't be a problem.

1295
01:29:23,757 --> 01:29:25,758
(Clearing throat)

1296
01:29:27,294 --> 01:29:28,528
What the fuck is that?

1297
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,997
Donald Hallford
in the flesh,

1298
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:32,698
or bones, brother.

1299
01:29:32,699 --> 01:29:33,799
Are you fucking serious?

1300
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,869
I take my fucking
very seriously!

1301
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:38,471
Oh, fuck!

1302
01:29:38,472 --> 01:29:41,174
What's time when you are dealing
with the dead, brother?

1303
01:29:41,175 --> 01:29:43,176
(Cheering)

1304
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:27,554
It is too fast!
He's going too fucking fast!

1305
01:30:42,169 --> 01:30:43,603
Somebody?

1306
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:46,506
Jack!

1307
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:53,413
Who are you?

1308
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:55,582
You know who I am, Jack.

1309
01:30:57,084 --> 01:30:58,384
You know.

1310
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:32,218
Anne! Anne!

1311
01:31:32,219 --> 01:31:34,454
Anne!
