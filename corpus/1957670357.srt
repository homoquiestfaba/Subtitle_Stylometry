-[blasting]

82
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,488
[Jeff] We've made every Jackass movie
like it's the last one.

83
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,949
We always take on that attitude.
"This is the last one."

84
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,369
We did that after the first movie.
We did it after the second movie.

85
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,745
We did it after the third movie.

86
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,250
And after the third movie,
I truly did believe that was the last one.

87
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,545
Oh my God! Look in the mirror.

88
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,172
-A grown man. Yes.
-[group cheers]

89
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,634
And, uh, I got a call
from Knoxville, and he's like, "Hey."

90
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,469
"I think, I'm…"

91
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,641
"I wanna do another Jackass movie."
I'm like, "Holy shit."

92
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,477
I don't know.
I just had a feeling, y'know?

93
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,898
I'd been writing it
for ten years, since the last one.

94
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,320
And I just got looking through
all the ideas one day,

95
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,531
and I thought,
"These would really be fun to shoot."

96
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,160
Then I got that feeling,
which I couldn't get rid of until we shot.

97
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,537
I was 100% sure that the ship had sailed

98
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,748
and that we would never make
Jackass again.

99
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,292
Then all of a sudden,
outta nowhere, after a decade,

100
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,128
Knoxville says, "I'm ready to go again."

101
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,921
Yeah, I know. Totally blindsided me.

102
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,590
But I was stoked. God.

-Good morning.

104
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,844

-Good to see you.

105
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,263
[Jeff] We all knew
we wanted to bring in some new blood,

106
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,681
but I wanted to also make sure

107
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,059
we had the original cast
and get them represented.

108
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,685
They had to be on board with it too.

-[Wee Man] Yeah, man.

111

as far as finding new cast,

112
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,069
we just reached out to friends.

113
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:05,656
This man right here, Trip Taylor,
is the reason we have this man, Poopies.

-Yeah.

122

called Loiter Squad together.

-[man] You a'ight, Jasper?

from the World Wide Web.

for that film in South Africa

144
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,466

-Ooh. Sorry, Mom.

150
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,147
[Jeff] So we got
this great new cast together,

151
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,357
but I think we still all
had some questions.

152
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,569
And then, you know, there's,
like, there's trepidation just on,

153
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,489
y'know, how we're older now.

154
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,075
-Like, is it still funny?
-Yeah, I was skeptical. I was… I mean…

155
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,578
-You were the most skeptical.
-I was very skeptical--

156
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,164
We came to you. We were all psyched.
Then you were like, "Uh…"

157
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,876
It was like, "We have to prove it
to ourselves that it's a good idea."

158
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,504
So let's shoot
a couple days but not commit,

159
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,923
and let it tell us that it's a movie.

160
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:31,594

was a bit that Steve-O shot a while ago,

could really, y'know, keep up.

00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,732
[all laughing]

167
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,025
-Wow.
-Holy shit.

168
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,819
-Oh, stop. Stop. Please stop.
-[group cheering]

169
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,530
All right.

170
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
This is Fire in the Hole.

171
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,117
[Ehren chuckles]

172
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,995
There's other hot sauces, but this is his.

173
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,373
Wee Man's Chronic Tacos.

174
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,459
-For the best in hot sauce enemas.
-[group chuckling]

175
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,045
[cracking up] The old taste of Mexico.

176
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,256
[all laughing]

177
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,175
[Johnny] Let's, uh…
let's assume the positions, fellas.

178
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,928
-[group chattering]
-[Johnny] I… Goddamn.

179
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,389
I don't know
where I'm gonna put it in at, Preston.

180
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,100
There might be
some, uh, scrounging around a little.

181
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,227
Okay, everybody insert.

182
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,562
Sorry, bro!

183
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,981
-Oh my God, kid.
-[all clamoring]

184
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,608
[Chris] You gotta make sure it goes up.
It's in his butthole.

185
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,696
-[Ehren] To the left! Too much air!
-[Preston] To the left! The fuckin' left!

186
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,824
Oh my God! No, you're too low!
Higher! Higher! Higher! Higher!

187
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,908
[Chris] Are you ready?

188
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,744
-[Ehren] You can put it in yourself.
-[Wee Man] Hot sauce is goin' in!

189
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,662
Are you ready?

190
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,623
[guys screaming and groaning]

191
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,542
-[Johnny] It's not goin' down!
-[Poopies] Hey!

192
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,627
-It's not goin' down!
-[group laughing]

193
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,589
-[Preston] I don't have any.
-Oh, Poopies' is going down.

194
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,257
-[men groaning]
-[Johnny] Oh no!

195
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,175
-[Chris] Slowly going in.
-[Wee Man] It burning?

196
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,760
-It's burning!
-[Johnny] It's not going!

197
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,720
[Ehren] There you go.

198
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,807
-Oh, fucking fuck!
-It's all over my hands now. Ugh.

199
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,310
-[Jaws] Yours isn't goin' in either!
-Oh shit!

200
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,769
-[Poopies] Oh God!
-[Dave] Jesus!

201
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,770
[Jaws] Ehren.

202
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,399
-[Jeff] Here, try this pump.
-[Johnny] Okay, we got a pump.

203
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,068
[Chris] Guys! I got shit on my hands!

204
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,487
-[Johnny] One second.
-[Jeff] We gotta let-- Go on, Spike.

205
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,781
-[Johnny] Okay, are you in, Jaws?
-[Jaws] I'm in.

206

211
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,171
-[group laughing]
-[Johnny] Guys, watch it. Whoo.

212
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,673
-[Wee Man laughs] Yeah.
-[Poopies] Oh God.

213
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,344
-Here's some relief, fellas. There you go.
-Yes. [sighs]

214
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,304
-[Johnny] What flavor you need?
-I want one.

215
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,430
[Preston] PJ, please.

216
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,141
-[Chris] He needs a poopsicle real quick.
-[Johnny] There, Preston.

217
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,143
-Who-- There you go, Poopies.
-Thank you, sir.

218
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,021
-[Ehren] Relieve your ass.
-[Johnny] Jaws, are you okay?

219
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,523
-It feels so much better.
-[Poopies] It does feel way better.

220
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,275
-[Preston] Great.
-Good. Doin' the trick.

221
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,027
-[Wee Man laughs]
-[Poopies] Oh, yeah.

222
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,570
You dare me to do this?

223
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,615
[group screams and groans]

224
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,867
[Chris] Ass to mouth. ATM!

225
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,911
-My God!
-[Poopies] Wanna see something? Watch.

226
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,080
-[Wee Man] Oh God!
-[group laughing]

227
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,206
[Poopies] Oh shit.

228
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,167
-[Dave] It's gonna be a fucked-up movie.
-[Wee Man] Yeah.

229
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,919
In hindsight, it was like an initiation.

230
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,464
It was like, if you can get through this,
then you can, y'know?

231
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,175
If you don't storm off set going,
"Nothin' doing,"

232
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,053
then it shows that you're down. [chuckles]

233
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,971
I didn't know what to expect with Jackass.

234
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,184
'Cause it was this weird feeling
of, "I've known you guys my whole life."

235
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,520
But also, "Oh my God."

236
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,272
"I can't believe
I'm here with them in person."

237
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,902
We're gonna have a little competition
between Preston Lacy and Zach Holmes.

238
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,654
Who can do the biggest long jump?

239
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,657
All competitors follow our instructions
as the gospel truth.

240
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,660
We frown on poor sportsmanship,
gambling, and slang.

241
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,246
-[man 1] Okay.
-All right. Get in our positions!

-Fuck, I'm prime time! I'm prime time!
-We are fucked.

00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,800
[group continues laughing]

247
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,512
-[Wee Man] He's like, "I'm fucked."
-[man 3] Stretch it out, Zach. Stretch.

-I'm makin' muscles.

Judging this contest
is next to impossible.

There's only one way to really find out
which athlete's day will be today,

277
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,999
and that's if they run simultaneously.

-[Rachel] It was magnificent.
-[Preston] No.

288
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,191
[Rachel] The judges
have, uh, assessed the results,

289
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,653
and it's obvious
the clear winner today is diabetes, but…

-[Wee Man] Wow.

00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,535

Oh my gosh.
This is where I was like, "Okay."

304
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,359
"Things are gettin'
a little too gnarly right now."

305
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,944
"Things are goin' too far."

306
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,779
But I had to do it.

307
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,991
First time I've ever shown my dick
on camera.

308
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,660
I've for sure never seen
a dick that flat in my life.

309
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,953
It was like science class.

310
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,330
You just learn something new.
What the dick can do.

311
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,542

-Whoo-hoo-hoo!
-Victors!

326
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,868

This is like a mini tug-of-war. See how…

00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,328
-Back up.
-Oh.

328
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,662
-Ow.
-[Chris] Oh, dear.

329
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,748
-Ow! Oh my God! Ow!
-[Poopies screams]

330
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,917
[all groaning]

331
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,754
-[Poopies groaning] Ow! Oh my God! Ow!
-[group laughing]

332
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,340
[Poopies] It's a slider! Oh my God!

333
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,966
[Rachel] That was my first day,

334
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,887
meeting everyone and then seeing
all of their dicks and their buttholes.

335
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,598
And then it felt like family after that.

336
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,726
-That's a wrap on this test.
-Sorry, sorry.

337
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,019
Amazing job, everyone.

338
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,812
Thank you, everybody.

339
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,898
[all cheering and applauding]

340
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,942
[Jeff] And so, after the two-day shoot,

341
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,903
me, Spike, and Knoxville all said,
"It's a go."

342
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,238
"And it's definitely… It feels right."

343
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,448
[cast chattering]

344
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:53,702
[Jeff] So, we officially began shooting
the movie on March 3, 2020.

345
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,912
Here they come.

346
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,540
Yeah, legend.

347
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,210
-[man] What up?
-What's up? How are you?

348
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,420
-[man] Good, and yourself?
-Good, man. I'm ready.

349
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,465
Got the boys here.
We got the crew. First stunt of the year.

350
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,176
Um, first stunt of the movie, actually.

351
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,552
-Yeah, Cordell.
-'Sup, buddy?

352
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,845
-How're you?
-Great to see you.

353
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,348
Good to see you.
So, yeah, we're on. Good to see you.

354
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,685
[man] Yeah, man.
Are you excited to get things picked up?

355
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,894
Dude, I'm so excited.

356
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,772
I've been waitin'
pretty much my whole life for this, so…

357
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,316
I mean, we're…
I'm workin' with legends right here.

358
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,609
I mean, it's crazy.

359
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,902
I'm excited.

360
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,320
[indistinct chatter]

361
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,572
[Johnny] Can you guess who I am, Dimitry?

362
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,658
-Who?
-[Johnny] Can you--? I'm Tesla.

363
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,786
Tesla's under-admired.

364
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,373
And this is going to do
nothing to help that. [chuckles]

365
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,166
[man] All right.

366
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,796
This is our friend James,
an esteemed scientist.

367
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,047
-You're a scientist?
-Yes.

368
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,090
What is that?

369
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,591
[James] That is an electric eel.

370
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,344
-They can put out up to 600 volts.
-[Johnny gasps]

371
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,847
So, the idea
for the electric eel was that,

372
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,726
"Can electricity come
from this animal, go through somebody,

373
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,020
and into a metal key
and then into somebody else?"

374
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:01,937
[Johnny] Yeah.

375
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:02,938
That was funny.

376
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,607
Oh, man. Wee Man tryin' to do intros?

377
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,486
He could not get those intros right,
and it was so satisfying.

378
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,783
Hi. I'm Benjamin Franklin,
father of electricity,

379
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,036
and this is an electric eel.

380
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,164
Countrymen, natives…

381
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,498
-[laughs]
-Wait, no.

382
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,583
-Romans.
-Friends.

383
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,709
-Friends.
-Romans.

384
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,627
-Romans and countrymen.
-Countrymen.

385
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,298
Friends, Romans, and countrymen,

386
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,300
show me your rears.

387
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,426
[group cracks up]

388
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,387
[Rachel, laughing] Lend me your ears.

389
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,015
-[Steve-O] Show him your rear!
-[man 1] Lend me your ears.

390
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,185
[laughing] Friends, Romans,
and countrymen, lend me your ears.

391
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,686
[group laughing]

392
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,439
-[Johnny] Okay. Oh, yeah.
-[Wee Man] Ready? Yes.

393
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:50,319
Friends, Romans, and Ehren,
lend me your rear.

394
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,905
-[electricity crackles]
-Oh gosh! [scoffs]

395
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:53,822
It did.

396
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,533
-[Steve-O] Jesus!
-[Wee Man] Are you ready?

397
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,659
[Steve-O laughs]

398
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,662
-[electricity crackles]
-[Ehren groans]

399
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,873
-[electricity crackles]
-[yelps]

400
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,626
[Johnny] Keep it on there, Wee Man.
Get the key in.

401
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,879
-[electricity crackles]
-[Ehren screams]

402
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:09,922
[group laughing]

403
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,926
[man 2] Did it work?

404
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,596
-Yeah, it worked. We got electricity, man.
-What? Fuckin' key, man.

405
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,473
What do you think the lights are on for?

406
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,850
-[key clangs]
-[laughs]

407
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,229
We learned that electric eels
do conduct enough electricity

408
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,649
to go through Wee Man,
into a key, into a butthole.

409
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,527
It's like, we learned important things.
Science things.

410
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,279
-[Jeff] Yeah. Who knew?
-[Spike] Who knew?

411
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,115
[Johnny] We ended that day on a high.

412
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,158
And I remember

413
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,621
going home that night,
and it was my birthday.

414
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,748
And I got a call from Spike,

415
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,876
and I'm like, "Oh, Spike's callin'
to wish me happy birthday."

416
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,670
-[laughs]
-And he's like, "Hey man."

417
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,674
[spluttering] "Uh,
we're going to shut down."

418
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,426
I'm like, "What do you mean?"
He goes, "COVID."

419
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,181
And I was-- I just couldn't wrap my head
around us shutting down.

420
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,642
We didn't know
if it was gonna be for two weeks,

421
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,519
if it was gonna be for a month.

422
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,814
-[nurse] Exposure to someone positive?
-[Dave] No.

423
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,899
[nurse] All right.
You're gonna get swabbed twice.

424
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,819
So if you need to blow your nose,
go ahead and do so now.

425
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,362
[Johnny] Because of the coronavirus,

426
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:19,032
today is our first day
filming again in seven months.

427
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,910
-Notice anything different?
-[Jeff] A funny thing happened.

428
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,663
When we came back,
Johnny Knoxville had gray hair.

429
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,166
-[Johnny] Thank you. We're good?
-[man] You're okay.

430
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,208
[Johnny] All right.

431
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:32,588
I'm all safe to shoot
a very dangerous film. [chuckles]

432
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:37,134
And then, we're one of the first movies
in Los Angeles that's back up and running.

433
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,469
[Poopies] Good morning. Whoo. Day one.

434
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,514
[Jeff] And we're almost like guinea pigs.
Like, it was tricky.

435
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,725
And we had to get tested every day.

436
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,060
There was just
a whole new set of safety protocols.

437
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,438
-[Steve-O coughs]
-[man] Steve-O just coughed.

438
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,942
-[group laughs]
-[Chris] I'll get Ebola.

439
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,820
So, let's use that to our advantage.
Like, let's…

440
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,156
Let's throw a COVID safety meeting.

441
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:03,118
This is Don,
our "COVID safety officer" for today.

442
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,581
He will be running the guys through
some safety precautions while on set.

443
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:11,043
And, uh, man, I just hope it goes well.

444
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,836
[Johnny and Don laugh]

445
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,756
[man] There's Pontius, Zach.

446
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,633
[Don] Well, my name's Don Ruffin.

447
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,010
I'm a COVID-19 compliance officer.

448
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,512
I'm here to help implement
the standards by the CDC

449
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,181
to help you get-- keep you guys safe.

450
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,016
So, we wanna keep the crew--

451
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,268
[air whooshing loudly]

452
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,064
[Poopies] Oh my God!

453
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,900
[cast laughing and grunting]

454
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,944
[man] What the fuck, you asshole?

455
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,822
[Ehren] Jesus Christ! Fuck!

456
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,824
[cast continues laughing]

457
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,160
[Poopies] I thought
the world was ending for a second.

458
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,746
[group laughing loudly]

459
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,414
[Ehren] I thought that was a COVID test.

460
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,667
Aren't we supposed
to take this shit seriously?

461
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,544
That was a real good way
to get back into… [chuckling]

462
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,506
And at that moment,
I truly realized, like,

463
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,424
we're fucked.

464
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,718
[chuckles] Like, anything goes.

465
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,098
Uh, we, as, uh, the cast,
are basically gonna just be

466
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,767
tortured for the next year.

467
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,852
-Whatever.
-[man] Oh my God.

468
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,189
That was the first thing
we shot back from COVID.

469
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,441
So already, the guys were on their toes.

470
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,610
And plus, with the new protocols,

471
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,571
they knew we weren't gonna be able
to shoot as much man on the street,

472
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,616
so we were gonna take that out
on the cast. [chuckles]

473
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,910
Hi. What's up, everybody?
My name's Poopies.

474
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,496
I'm the newest member
of the Jackass 4 crew.

475
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,291
[interviewer] What is gonna change
about your life once this comes out?

476
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,167
Well, I think that, um…

477
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,546
Well, one thing that I think
is gonna change in my life is, uh,

478
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,381
the fame.

479
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,509
But I don't let that get to me, dude.

480
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,721
I just wanna be by the beach,
surfin' and chasin' chicks my whole life.

481
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,099
So, I mean,
that's gonna be definitely a plus,

482
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,227
but I just wanna make
more… more projects and film more--

483
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,313
-[Poopies groans]
-[Johnny laughing]

484
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,523
Oh my gosh, dude. [chuckles]

485
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,151
-Oh, bro!
-[Johnny] Are you okay?

486
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,529
-Are you okay?
-Oh my gosh! That was a good slap, dude.

487
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,782
[chuckling] Holy shit.
Knoxville, good morning.

488
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,743
I'm always on edge
when I'm on set because,

489
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,536
y'know, anything can be a prank.

490
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,163
[air whooshing loudly]

491
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,706
[Ehren] What the fuck?

492
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,959
-What the fuck?
-[Johnny] Oh my God!

493
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,377
[Zach] I knew it!

494
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,671
-I fuckin' knew it!
-[Johnny] Oh my God!

495
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,425
Like, this could be a prank right now.
I don't fuckin' know.

496
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,052
-[laughs] You know?
-[blasting]

497
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,721
And every-- Nothing is real.

498
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,390
-[man] Let's lay it down.
-[laughing] What the fuck?

499
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,267
[all laughing]

500
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,981
[sighs, laughs nervously]

501
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,443
Sorry. It's so nerve-racking in here.

502
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,489
[interviewer] What's the grossest bit
that was shot so far in this movie?

503
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:46,907
Huh.

504
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,701
-[loud popping]
-[Johnny] Oh.

505
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,912
[group laughing]

506
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,875
[man] Jesus.

507
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,668
-[cast laughing]
-[man] Jeez.

508
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,755
That was five gallons of horse semen!

-[chuckling] I'll fuck you up!
-[electricity crackling]

514
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,394
They told me
they was doing something. I forgot.

515
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,020
Sayin' they were scaring somebody else.

516
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,689
Next thing you know, I'm locked in a room.

517
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,234
But I never imagined
they'd put me in a room with a bear.

-Hey, man!

-Hey, hey!
-[bear growling]

520
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,410
Hey, get that fuckin' bear, bro!
Hey! Aw, shit.

521
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,121
-Hey, man! What the fuck, bro?
-[bear growls]

522
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,498

-Help! Hey, man, get this damn thing, bro!
-[Johnny on PA] Dark Shark.

525
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,423
[laughing] My dad's in there
with a bear right now.

526
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,384
[on PA] Dark Shark,
those trees aren't real.

527
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,760
You can't climb them.

528
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,011
[both laughing]

529
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,471

[screams] He's biting me! He bit me!

533
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:02,149
Throughout the years, y'know,
I slowly developed more and more PTSD,

534
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,318
just like any of the other guys,
about what's really happening

535
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,778
or if we're getting pranked.

536
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,822
And I'm gonna have to say that that came,

537
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,116
for me, at a height
at Silence of the Lambs.

538
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,452
-That was… They took it too far.
-[loud bang]

539
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,786
[Dave] Doggone it!

540
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,079
[Ehren] Oh fuck!

541
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:21,460
[Dave] We got locked in a pitch-black room
and tortured for like 20 minutes straight.

542
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,836
It was terrifying.

543
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,046
[Dave] Hey, what do you guys
want us to do--? Ow!

544
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,798
[groaning] Ow! Ow!

545
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,259
-You guys are fuckin' assholes!
-[man] Guess!

546
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,847
I hope it's funny, but, man, to be
in that moment, it was… it was…

547
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,807
It was like…

548
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,936
I thought I was gonna die,
and not a… a painless death.

549
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:44,274
That was… I don't remember
being that scared, like, maybe ever.

550
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,067
Fuck!

551
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,696
[sighs, exhales deeply]

552
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,115
Oh, man, dude. I still don't…

553
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,618
It's so hard to trust.
Is it over? Is it over?

554
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,785
[man 1] It's over.

555
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,205
-[woman chuckles]
-[man 2] It's over, bro.

556
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:02,042
I'm scared of what you guys do,
you guys go through.

557
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,377
-Like, no one's safe.
-[electricity crackles]

-[Ehren groans] Fuck! Why?
-[group laughing]

559
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,260
And, uh, I was, like,
kind of scared every time I showed up.

560
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,763
I was, like…
I was very nervous the first day.

561
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,892
-[nurse 1] Get your temperature taken.
-[thermometer beeps]

562
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,686
[nurse 1] All right.
You're all good. There.

563
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,772
[mellow country music playing]

564
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,859
[nurse 2] Thank you.

565
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,154
-[Eric] Actually, I'm gonna pee quick.
-[woman] We're ready.

566
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,657
-[Eric] I'm gonna pee.
-[woman] Oh, okay. Go.

-I fuckin' knew it! I fuckin' knew it!
-[group laughing]

569
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,629
-I knew it. I knew it, you motherfucker.
-[laughing]

570
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,006
I fuckin' knew it!

571
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,259
-[cracking up]
-[Wee Man] Yeah!

572
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,344
-[Preston] Yeah!
-Fired up!

573
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,389
-That thing caught on fire, dude.
-[Zach laughs]

574
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:01,017
-[man] Oh my God! Oh my God!
-[Eric] I peed, like, all over myself.

575
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,938
Went into the porta-potty,
and it fuckin' exploded. [laughing]

576
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,566
Like, hook, line, and sinker.

577
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,485
[scoffs] Like, I produce pranks
for a living.

578
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:15,240
And the whole cast
plays it so well, I had no idea.

579
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,408
It's one of those things.

580
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,160
When you watch it growing up,
you're in love with it,

581
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,373
but when you're actually there on set,
you're like, "This is fuckin' hardcore."

582
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,500
[in exaggerated British accent]
Hello, governor.

583
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:30,505
We're here with Eric André,
world-famous elephant hunter.

584
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,091
And we're gonna do
a little big-game hunting today.

585
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:37,012
[in British accent] This might be
the diphtheria, but they look delicious.

586
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,140
-[Wee Man] That's fuckin' gnarly.
-[Zach] Which way are we gonna go?

587
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,559
[in British accent] If there's one thing
any schoolboy knows,

588
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,978
it's hunting big game requires a big gun.

589
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:45,979
[group laughs]

590
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,773
[Wee Man] This is a bad day
to be an elephant.

591
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,191
[Zach laughing] So bad.

592
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,152
It appears they're linked together.

593
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,321
-Is that how they snog?
-[group laughs]

594

["British Grenadiers" playing]

595
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,574
[Johnny] Oi! Dead ahead.

596
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,576
-[Eric] Aim for the mother!
-[Dave] Hup, hup!

597
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,744
[Chris] Okay!

598
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,745

-[Eric] Thrust, thrust.
-And fire when ready.

[Chris] Twenty pound sterling bounty
on the baby elephant.

605
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,344
[Eric] Twenty quid for a baby?
Are you mad?

606
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,305
-[group groans]
-[Wee Man] Oh fuck!

607
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,640
[Johnny] He's feisty.

608
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,226
He'll make a fine decoration
for the sitting room. Ha ha ha!

-[Dave] Fully reloaded!

[Preston groans] Motherfucker, dudes.

617
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,244
Would someone provide this elephant
with a veterinarian?

618
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,704
He seems hurt.

-[Preston groans]
-[Jeff] Keep shooting. What are we doin'?

620
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,583
We gotta get it again.

621
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,253
We don't have this yet. Like…
Can you take another? You're all right.

622
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,756
My favorite part of that
is Knoxville trying to get you

623
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,801
to go talk
to the elephants, who are upset.

624
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,844
And I feel like
that's a big part of the thing.

625
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,555
You guys are like--
You're good cop, bad cop.

626
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,683
You need to go talk to the elephants.

627
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,101
-They're good.
-[man] They're good.

628
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,395
-Preston's good to go?
-Preston, you're good, right?

629
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,480
[Preston] I don't know.
It's startin' to swell up.

630
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:14,901
-Ah, fuck. It hurts so bad. Oh, shit.
-[Jeff] Let's reset. We're goin' again.

631
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,821
-Let's go after the bull.
-[Jeff] You guys are thirsty.

632

-You're around your watering hole.
-You guys go on one leg. Go on one leg.

-[Jeff] Just happy.
-[Johnny] Move the camera.

need to be on this side of the pond--

-[Jeff] Fuck!
-[Eric, in British accent] Good show!

[groans loudly]

639
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,758
It's weird, though.
They don't like seeing me get hit or hurt.

640
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:39,843
-Really?
-Yeah.

641
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,470
-What are you talkin' about?
-Yeah, what are you talking about?

642
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:46,266
What? Everyone cheers when,
like, I stun-gun you or, like…

643
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,602
People were so happy
when you got shot by the elephant gun.

644
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,020
-Yeah.
-Are we ready?

645
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,856
I'm sorry. I'm on cloud nine.

646
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:56,526
-I dropped my accent and everything.

[man] Show me what you got here.
Oh my God.

648
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,113
[Jeff] That thing hurt.

649
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,866
But then our hunt
was rudely interrupted by an explosion.

650
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,453
I think-- Was it Ehren
that was blasted out of the toilet?

00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,333
-[shouts]
-[Johnny] Okay!

653
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,419
-Get him!
-[Johnny] Okay. Put the gun down!

654
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,504
-Gun down.
-It's loaded. It's hot!

655
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,883
[screams] What the fuck! Ah, goddamn it!

656
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,509
[cast laughing]

657
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,594
[Ehren] Seriously?

658
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:23,762
Fuck you guys!

659
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,764
-[Johnny] Yeah! We got Ehren!
-[Chris] Holy shit!

660
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,140
[Ehren panting]

661
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,517
[group laughing]

662
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,312
-[Dave] It got you?
-[Ehren] What do you mean, did it get me?

663
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,732
We were shooting in the field,
and we saw a huge fireball from over here.

664
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,817
Everyone dropped the whole bit
and started running.

665
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,486
[Ehren] Are you fuckin' kidding me?

666
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,862
[group chuckling]

667
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,073
-[woman] Okay.
-[man] What are you, Johnny?

668
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,494
I'm a fuckin' flamingo. What do you think?

669
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,828
[man 1] What? I dunno.

670
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,247
So, what's gonna happen here
is we're swinging.

671
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,251
And they're coming down,
and they're gonna get in our way.

672
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,961
But our goal is to really damage them,

673
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,298
and their goal is to,
uh, somehow avoid us,

674
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,633
but they're not going to.

675
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:05,261
I'm Jasper,
and this is the Swingset Gauntlet.

676
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,472
-Mya!
-[Johnny] Ooh-whee!

677
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,224
-Nya!
-[Johnny scoffs]

678
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,477
-That's your cow sound?
-[man] That's your, uh…

679
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,146
-Yeah, I'm a different type of cow.
-[surf music playing]

680
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,191
[Jeff] I wanna see a little pelican head
go flyin' across the yard.

681
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,528
[man 1] Look at the pelican fly!
Come on, pelican!

682
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,946
[man 2] All right, start pumpin'.

683
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,406
[Johnny] You had me at "start pumpin'."

684
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,411
[Johnny grunts]

685
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,455
[all laughing]

686
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,624
-Watch your head!
-[Jasper yelps]

687
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,545
[Jeff] Oh my God.

688
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,421
[Jasper yelps, groans]

689
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,799
-[Chris laughs]
-[Dave] Oh.

690
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,092
[yelps, grunts]

691
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,344
[all groaning and laughing]

692
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,680
Are you okay?

693
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,265
Holy…

694
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,519
-Are you okay?
-Dude.

695
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,522
-[laughing] Holy shit!
-[Johnny] Are you all right?

696
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,941
[Ehren] He spun
in the air like a fuckin'…

697
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,776
-[Dave spits]
-[Ehren] Dude!

698
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,945
-Did I do it right?
-[laughing] Oh my God!

699
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,531
-[Dave] I didn't even know what happened.
-[Ehren] Oh my God!

700
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,075
[Dave] I was cruisin' along
on my cool little box here.

701
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,494
Fuckin' dickhead Ehren
smashed the fuck outta me.

702
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,787
[Ehren laughs]

703
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,832
[Dave] I didn't land in the soft sand.
I landed back on this bullshit.

704
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,168
-[group laughs]
-[Johnny] Your head broke your landing.

705
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,797
[Chris in East Coast accent]
Hi, Nick Merlino. Bye, Nick Merlino.

706
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,508
[group laughing]

707
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:29,095
-I'm gonna clobber that crustacean.
-[all laugh]

708
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,139
Okay, go.

709
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,932
Get the speed, Chris.

710
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,436
[Chris] I'm gonna pulverize that prawn.

711
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,939
[all groan and laugh]

712
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,482
[Chris laughing] Oh my God!

713
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,694
-[Johnny cracking up]
-[Ehren] Holy shit!

714
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:48,531
-Dude, he did, like, four flips. Dude.
-[Nick groans]

715
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,035
-[Chris] Dude.
-[Johnny] Pontius, that was a good one.

716
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,995
-Holy shit.
-[man 3] That was great.

717
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,122
[Nick] Yeah, that knocked
the wind outta me.

718
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,041
-Dude.
-That fuckin' sucked.

719
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,001
[in East Coast accent]
Hey lobster, you lost?

720
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,338
-[man 4] Awesome.
-[all laughing]

721
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,007
[machine whirring]

722
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,385
[Jeff] It was really fun
to bring back Irving Zisman.

723
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,220
We haven't seen that guy in a while.

724
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,515
You gotta see the manager in here.

725
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,143
You should see the bunglestein on her.

726
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,063
-[laughs]
-I'd like to tap her like a keg.

727
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,023
Oh no. [laughs]

728
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,608
[quietly]

729
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,443
No?

730
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,531
[Irving] Okay.
What kind of a thing should I…

731
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,617
'Cause she's a little sweet on me too.

732
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,285
Man.

733
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,914
-I feel like--
-She's about your age.

734
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,415
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

735
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,500
Damn.

736
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,086
-Maybe--
-Don't go blowin' up my spot.

737
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,713
[laughs] Gotta watch out.

738
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,176
Yeah, I don't need
any cockblocks around here.

739
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,845
-[container pops]
-It's Brad?

740
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,766
-Yeah.
-[Irving, softly] You wanna have some fun?

741
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,060
-Yeah, man.
-[Irving] Okay.

742
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,398
[groans, grunts]

743
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,276
-[alarm blaring]
-[Irving] Oh.

744
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,528
[quietly]

745
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,613
[Irving exhales, groans]

746
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,117
Irving, what did you…
what did you do that for?

747
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,995
-What should we do now?
-[Irving laughs]

748
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,663
-Oh my goodness.
-Hold onto that.

749
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,039
That's a pretty nice soup bone.

750
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,919
Mm, my goodness,
check out the torpedo on that submarine.

751
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,131
-He's got a broomstick like a banana slug.
-[alarm stops]

752
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,757
[manager] How--? Oh my God. Oh wow.

753
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,009
Hi, Cheryl.

754
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,261
Oh, fuck. Hello, Irving.

755
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,597
-What the hell did you do now?
-I didn't do it. He pulled it.

756
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,558
What?

757
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,061
Why do what? You pulled it!
You said, "Watch this" and pulled it.

758
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,898
[softly] Oh, why are you being
a cockblock? Talk me up.

759
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,651
You're bein' a cockblock. Talk me up.

760
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,698
He's your age,
so he's, like, trying to hit on you.

761
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,785
And it's not a good time
for you to do that.

762
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,872
-I…
-What?

763
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,290
-What's your name?
-Brad.

764
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,333
-[Cheryl] Did you pull the fire alarm?
-No.

765
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,294
-[Cheryl] Okay. Irving says you did.
-I know--

766
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,047
[Irving] All of you who think Brad did it,
raise your hand.

767
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,381
[men exclaim]

768
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,551
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-What's your problem?

769
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:17,388
-Ah. Wow, this is my kind of party.
-[men laugh]

770
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,932
-All right.
-I kinda feel like partyin' right now.

771
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,726
[dance music playing on boom box]

772
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,519
[men exclaim]

773
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,024
[Irving] Oh! Hey, oh!

774
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,359
-[men cheer]
-[Irving grunting]

775
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,154
[men clamoring]

776
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,448
[Irving] Come on, Brad. Let's get rad.

777
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,492
-[man 1] C'mon!
-Yeah, man.

778
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,078

-[Brad laughs]

779
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,664

782
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,630
-[Johnny] Good luck, Wee Man.
-[Wee Man] Thanks.

783
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,883
[Jeff] That's one of the disco-iest
camel toes I've ever seen.

784
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,259
[group laughs]

785
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,095
-[Chris grunts]
-Stop, okay?

786
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,763
-[both laugh]
-Oh my God.

787
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,475
I'm Wee Man, and this is the Ballknocker.

788
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,937
[machinery whirring]

789
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,689
-[Steve-O] It's fuckin' party time, man.
-[man 1] Yeah.

790
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,402
[Preston grunts]

791
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,904
[machinery stops]

792
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:18,449
-[Johnny] Three, two, one, go!
-[Wee Man grunts]

793
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,243
-[Wee Man groans]
-[man 2] Oh shit!

794
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,578
-[all groan and laugh]
-[Steve-O claps]

795
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,746
[Preston] Fuck.

796
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,998
[Preston, Zach, and Wee Man groaning]

797
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,627
-Wee Man, are you okay? Holy shit.
-[man 3] Jason? Jason, speak.

798
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,712
-[man 4] That was intense.
-[Johnny] You okay?

799
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,256
-Yeah.
-Talk. Talk, talk.

800
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,550
-Am I bleedin'?
-[group] No.

801
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,970
-[Johnny] How did that feel?
-[Wee Man] It felt like a car crash.

802
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,931
-[Johnny] It looked like a car crash.
-[Wee Man] Fuck.

803
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:42,932
[Zach] Oh my God.

804
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,935
-[Johnny] How do you feel, Zach?
-[Zach] Dude, my asshole hurts.

805
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,980
-[group laughing]
-[Wee Man] How does your asshole hurt?

806
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,440
I don't wanna hear anything about that.

807
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,485
-You asked me how I felt.
-I know. But why does that hurt?

808
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,113
-I don't know! [laughs]
-[group chuckles]

809
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,449
-I don't know!
-I don't know what bit you just did.

810
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,285
[Zach and Wee Man laughing]

811
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,247
So, on Wildboyz, we filmed this bit

812
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,293
where we were in Africa,
and we had fish attached to strings.

813
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,128
Like, cinched up around our packages.

814
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:16,340
It's time for a little penis fishing.
We're fishing for fish eagles!

815
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,843
[Chris] And so, the eagles
would swoop down, grab the fish,

816
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,469
and then yank our packages taught.

817
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:24,140
-[Wee Man inhales sharply, screams]
-[Chris groans, laughs]

818
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,184
[Wee man shrieking and laughing]

819
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,144
[Chris laughing] Oh my God!

820
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,314
But MTV wouldn't let us air it.
It was a little graphic.

821
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,025
And so we thought,
"Well, let's try to do that idea."

822
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,444
Like, I got word
that this guy had two fish eagles.

823
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,988
I'm like, "Ah, fish eagles.
I've got an idea for that."

824
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,491
I gotta tell ya, breaking bones
and shovin' things up your butt

825
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,452
doesn't get any easier with age.

826
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:45,912
I'm just kidding.

827
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,372
Shovin' things up your butt
gets a lot easier.

828
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,958
I'm Steve-O,
and this is the Dine and Dash.

829
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,168
[group chuckles]

830
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,172
-Oh no.
-Oh God.

831
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,758
The basic idea
was shove a fish up Steve-O's butt

832
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,677
and have an eagle come
and just grab the fish hard

833
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,055
and fly off,
hopefully grabbing some of his butt

834
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,306
and flying away with it.

835
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,434
But the fish eagle just,
kinda just gently lands next to him.

836
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,519
[Steve-O] Oh my God.
I just saw his fuckin' beak.

837
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,022
-[Chris] He's checkin' it.
-[Jasper] Just smack it.

838
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,815
-[eagle cries]
-[Rachel] Oh my God.

839
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,192
-Ow!
-[Rachel] Oh my God!

840
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,612
-I saw it come out of his asshole!
-Ow! Oh!

841
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,615
-Ow!
-[Jeff] He got the first fish easily.

842
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,909
So, well, we got…
we gotta make something out of this.

843
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,703
So, we just stuffed the fish
a little further up in there

844
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:31,082
and wrapped it up
around his balls and stuff. [chuckles]

845
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:35,127
Do you want to, uh,
really rub the fish all over my balls?

846
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,587
[man 1] Ooh.

847
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,756
-I can.
-[group laughs]

848
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,133
[Johnny] Do we have a rubber band? Ah, no?

849
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,219
Jesus Christ. How big are his nuts?

850
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,055
-I don't know how-- My God.
-[group laughs]

851
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,266
[Chris] I got a hair tie. Would that work?

852
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,435
-You're a genius.
-[Chris] I want that back, though.

853
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,728
-[Johnny] I need--
-[screams]

854
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,273
-[Johnny] Wait, Steve-O, I'm not--
-Hey, no cheap shot!

855
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,150
-It doesn't get any cheaper than this.
-[Steve-O laughs]

856
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,487
-[man 2] Let him get every last scrap.
-[Steve-O chuckling]

857
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,406
Come on, man. That's HomeTown Buffet.

858

-Oh shit.

-[man 3] Need to go for it.
-Oh shit! [groans]

Ow!

869
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,770
Here I am, like, butt naked.

870
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,523
I got, like, stickin' stuff up my butt,

871
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,984
and my balls were on the line.

872
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,902

00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,245
-Does it look sweet?
-[Johnny] Give Pontius his hair tie back.

876
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,205
Dude, I'm gonna sell this on eBay.

877
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,208
-[laughs]
-Yeah.

878
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,295
-[chuckles]
-I'm not surprised that bit's in 4.5.

879
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,881
-But I wasn't givin' up on the raptors.
-Yeah.

880
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,551
So, we got a raptor
to rip off my eyebrows.

881
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,635
That was amazing.

882
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,512
-Put your chin down.
-Okay.

883
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,681
After we're all done, after it's all over,

884
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,976
I want you to relax
with some cucumber and elderflower water.

885
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,979
[Dark Shark] That's crazy.
Look at that big motherfucker.

886
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,607
-Do you like birds?
-I ain't sayin' nothin'.

887
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,319
Yeah, no. I'm scared of birds.
You can't tell I keep jumpin'?

888
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,739
Dark Shark was funny during that bit
because he's so scared of birds.

889
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:31,285
Yeah, I'm… I been scared of birds
since I was, like, ten years old.

890
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,120
You know, I got a phobia.

891
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,791
-[man] We're ready to go.
-Oh, shit! Oh, damn.

-Oh, shit.

893
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,629
[Dark Shark] That motherfucker
ready to go, got business.

894
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,838
I'm serious.

[Johnny snickers]

896
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,387
I'm gonna be well groomed.

897

Got one little bit still left. [laughs]

903
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,113
[Chris] There's a tiny racing stripe.

904
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,907
That's the way
they're wearing them these days.

-[hair rips]
-Ow. [sighs]

906
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,703
Know what? I have those eyebrows.

907
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,122
-I saved them.
-Oh, did you?

908
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,374
[Chris] Yeah.
I thought it'd be a good idea.

909
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:22,336
After 4.5 comes out, we can auction them
off to charity to help the kids.

910
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,671
-That's great.
-Yeah.

911
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,214
[Chris] You look really sexy.

912
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,883
If you think I look good now, just wait.

913
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,720
-Job's only just begun.
-[both chuckle]

914
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:35,182
Yeah, I didn't even realize
how badly I missed working with Chris

915
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,017
until we started shooting this movie.

916
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,853
Yeah, we just have the best time.

917
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,274
Yeah, I think it makes us become better
than our own individual selves.

918
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,317
It makes our personalities multiply.

919
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,028
Chris and I together
is better than the sum of its parts.

920
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,364
-That's the word, yes.
-[chuckles]

921
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,159
[Jeff] The problem was,
once we ripped his eyebrows off,

922
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,827
now we got Steve-O with no eyebrows,

923
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,497
and we're only two-thirds of the way
through the movie, so… [chuckles]

924
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,334
[Steve-O] I walked out, and I was like,
"What the hell ramp is that, dude?"

925
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,670
Like, "What kind
of sissy operation is this?"

926
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:07,339
And then I found out
that he's wearin' a rocket pack.

927
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,968
I'm like, "Okay, cool. I'm in." [laughs]

-Welcome to my Fantasy Island.

931
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,394
a rocket jet pack.

932
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,271
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

933
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,815
Oh, and we also got,
uh, Bunny the Lifeguard.

934
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,693
-[Chris] Kind of a new alter ego.
-[Johnny laughs]

-Yeah, there we go.

00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,618

[group laughs]

939
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,832
[Parks] Poopies, with the two liquid CO2
rocket-powered backpacks,

940
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,919
and he's gonna edge out
of the big red kicker.

941
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,255
And then he's got a little strap here,
and as soon as you pull that,

942
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,549
she kicks, and you're goin'
for a ride for eight seconds.

943
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:55,387
[man] Poopies, when you hit the ramp,
hit the jet pack for additional thrust.

[Ehren] Oh, look at that. Jesus.

1140
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,432
-[Poopies] Wow.
-[Chris] Look at how slick he is.

1141
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,475
-Oh. Ugh.
-[Poopies retches]

1142
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,352
All right. Hey, guys.

1143
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,187
You like shrimp?

1144
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,064
[Johnny] I see one
with Steve-O's name on it.

1145
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,941
Steve, feast on that eel.

1146
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,860
Should I… should I do it no hands?

1147
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,820
Steve-O going for the no-hander.

1148
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,072
-[Steve-O] That's wet-ass bootie.
-[Chris] No-hander.

1149
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,158
Oh yeah. [retches]

1150
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:38,952
-[Poopies] This is not--
-[Johnny] Leaning down in everyone's puke.

1151
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,580
-[Steve-O retching and groaning]
-[group laughing]

1152
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,417
[Poopies] Oh my God!

1153
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,420
[Steve-O coughing and retching loudly]

1154
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,380
[Johnny] Can we get… can we get…

1155
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,632
[Chris] Get it down. Get it down.
No, no, no, no, no.

1156
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,302
[Steve-O and Zach retch]

1157
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,721
-[Poopies] You got it, Steve-O.
-[Johnny] Hold it together.

1158
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,515
[Steve-O groans and retches loudly]

1159
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,933
[moans]

1160
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,144
Feels like we've really crossed a line.

1161
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,938
-[vomit splashes]
-[Johnny laughs] Oh God.

1162
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,106
I can't believe it.

1163
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,402
-[Lance retches]
-[Johnny] Focus. How you doin', Lance?

1164
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,363
-[Lance coughing]
-[Johnny] Can we get Lance another mask?

1165
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,076
How many times
did you puke this film, Lance?

1166
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,745
[Lance] I think it was six.
I tried to stay off camera.

1167
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:25,749
[Johnny] So, you puked once or twice
in past movies and six times in this one.

1168
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:26,792
[Lance retching]

1169
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,752
-That was a record.
-That's a record.

1170
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,379
I came for sushi, but I had salad.

1171
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,298
[all laughing]

1172
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,883
Jeff was joking with me before

1173
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:38,261
about like, "You're gonna find sushi
somewhere when you get home."

1174
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,056
And I was thinking,
"Oh, ha ha. You know, whatever."

1175
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,391
I'm pretty sure
he found one two days later.

1176
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:48,063
He sent me a photo of a piece of sashimi
that he found two days later. [laughs]

1177
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,774
[laughing] It was nasty. So messed up.

1178
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,070
-[Rachel] Hello.
-Hi. How's it going?

1179
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,446
-[Rachel] Good.
-Hi.

1180
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,950
-This is my grandpa.
-[woman] Hi.

1181
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:00,867
Hi.

1182
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,410
-My name is Alex. How are you?
-Good.

1183
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,620
-Alex?
-Alex, yeah.

1184
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,913
-Irving.
-Irving.

1185
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,540
-I'm Rachel.
-Hi, Rachel.

1186
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,875
Um, so, I just have
a couple meetings today,

1187
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,837
and I just need you to, like,
sit with him for a couple hours.

1188
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,881
You don't have to babysit him,
but just kinda keep an eye on him.

1189
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,802
And then just one thing.
Like, just make sure he doesn't smoke.

1190
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,053
Like, that's all.

1191
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,930
-All right. Thank you so much.
-Of course.

1192
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,558
-Have fun, Grandpa. Be good, okay?
-[Irving] All right, baby doll.

1193
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,725
-[Rachel] Love you.
-Right.

1194
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,435
-[Alex] It was Irving, right?
-Yes.

1195
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,937
[Alex] What would you like to do?

1196
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,691
There's a little coffee truck
right around the corner.

1197
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,652
Would… would you mind getting me a coffee?

1198
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,654
-Do you want black coffee?
-Please.

1199
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,781
-With no sugar? Nothing?
-No sugar.

1200
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,907
I'm sweet enough.

1201
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,493
[energetic music playing]

1202
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,292
[Irving] Help!

1203
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,587
-Where are you?
-[Irving] Help!

1204
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,965
-Where are you?
-[Irving] Help?

1205
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:57,883
Whoa.

1206
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,010
-How did you get up there?
-Help.

1207
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,095
[Alex] Oh my God. Don't move.

1208
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,222
-Don't move.
-[Irving] Oh my God.

1209
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,018
-[Irving groans]
-[Alex] Don't move.

1210
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:12,355
-No! No, you're not supposed to smoke.
-[Irving] I gotta smoke. I'm nervous.

1211
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,482
-[Irving] Mm.
-[Alex] Don't move.

1212
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,650
[line ringing]

1213
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,028
-[Irving] Mm. Mm.
-Oh my God, please. You're gonna fall.

1214
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,821
Oh! Oh! Ah!

1215
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,200
[screams] Oh shit! Oh God!

1216
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,327
[Irving shrieks]

1217
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,579
-[Alex] Oh my God!
-Oh shoot! [grunts, yells]

1218
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,581
Throw the coffee! Throw the coffee!

1219
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:32,417
Oh, ow! Ow!

1220
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,752
Throw it! Throw it!

1221
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:34,961
Ow! [groans]

1222
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,339
-[screams, groans]
-[wheelchair clatters]

1223
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,424
[Irving grunting]

1224
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,801
[Alex] Oh my God!
Don't move. You're gonna fall!

1225
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,345
[Irving groans]

1226
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,055
You want a smoke?

1227
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,306
No, I don't want a smoke.

1228
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,349
Do you have weed?

1229
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,767
I don't have weed.

1230
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,935
Do you have acid?

1231
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,686
-No, I don't.
-[Irving] Come on!

1232
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,939
-[grunts]
-[Alex] Oh my God!

1233
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,690
[Irving groans]

1234
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,609
Oh! Oh my God!

1235
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:00,070
[groans] These things will kill you.

1236
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,322
Oh, my back!

1237
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,658
Okay.

1238
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,952
[softly] Okay. Okay. Okay.

1239
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,578
-[clangs loudly]
-Ow!

1240
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:16,211
-I haven't been able to walk in two years.
-[Alex gasps]

1241
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,213
-Okay.
-Bless you.

1242
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,422
[Irving sighs]

1243
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,425
You're giving me a heart attack.

1244
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,971
[Zach chuckles]

1245
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,347
Get some of this…

1246
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,183
in the folds.

1247
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:32,852
-Thank you.
-[laughs]

1248
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,479
[Zach] Jeff loves painting me.

1249
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,773
He really likes
all the detail and everything.

1250
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:39,609
Getting in every crevice, under each roll.

1251
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,695
Makes sure you're painted really well.

1252
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,156
[interviewer] How did you first
become familiar with Jeff's work?

1253
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,076
I saw… like, when I was a little kid, uh…

1254
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,703
When I was in elementary school,

1255
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,080
I was told
I wasn't allowed to watch Jackass.

1256
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:56,167
And I just… I would have to,
like, sneak to watch it on TV. [chuckles]

1257
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,546
Yeah. I lived in a super,
like, Christian household,

1258
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,589
and they were, like…

1259
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,009
They were just anti-MTV and everything.

1260
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:08,096
So, I would just watch it and have
another channel on the channel return.

1261
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,515
It was pretty dope. [laughs]

1262
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:14,102
-[man] Three, two…
-[Johnny] Shirt looks a little small.

1263
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:17,522
[whispering] I had Emily
take the extra-large tag

1264
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:21,109
and put it in a size medium shirt.

1265
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,945
[Emily] Tuck. You have to tuck it.

1266
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,031
-It's a tuck deal?
-[Emily] Yeah. You gotta tuck it.

1267
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,283
You left me
a lot of room to tuck, asshole.

1268
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,160
[group laughing]

1269
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:33,747
It was funny because when they set it up,
it was supposed to be a winch,

1270
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,833
but the winch wasn't gonna work out,
so they just tied a truck to me.

1271
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,501
I was just pulled by a truck.

1272
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,379
-That's really somethin' else.
-This is half-assed, even for us.

1273
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,630
[laughs]

1274
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,925
-[Wee Man] That's a big ball.
-[Johnny] That's a really big ball.

1275
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,012
Four hundred pounds
of baseball right there.

1276
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,264
I'm Zach, and it's time to Play Ball.

1277
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,558
Some people call this pitch a slider.

1278
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,060
I call it a spitball.

1279
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,895
-[Zach chuckles nervously]
-[spits]

1280
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,438
[group laughs]

1281
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,982
[Johnny] Let's break up the party.
We got a game to play.

1282
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,734
-All right. 'Kay.
-Let's do it.

1283
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,446
I warn you, I'm wearing sexy lingerie
under this uniform.

1284
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,489
[both chuckle]

1285
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,324
["Charge" playing on organ]

1286
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:22,379
[Jeff] Batter, batter!
Batter, batter, batter! Batter, swing!

1287
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,839
-[Zach] Whoa!
-[Zach, Johnny, and Wee Man groan]

1288
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,092
[Zach laughing and moaning]

1289
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,303
[Wee Man grunts]

1290
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,516
-[Poopies] You all right?
-[Zach] Oh my God! Are you okay?

1291
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,642
Strike!

1292
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,852
[Zach laughing]

1293
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,979
Good job, you guys. That was awesome.

1294
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,565
-Jasper, way to…
-[Jasper] Yes, sir.

1295
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,317
[Jeff] Way to watch it.

1296
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,445
-[Zach, Johnny, and Wee Man groan]
-[clamoring]

1297
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,531
[laughing] It was pretty scary.

1298
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,617
Yeah, like, granted,
we had these just mini pads on,

1299
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,495
like baseball players, but he took us out.

1300
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,456
[thuds loudly]

1301
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,625
[Wee Man] He knocked me
outta my shoes too.

01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,598
-Be gentle with me.
-[Shannon] Mm-hmm.

1466
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,350
So, how fast do you serve, Shannon?

1467
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:15,935
Up to 100 miles per hour.

1468
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,270
-Hey?
-[Shannon] Mm-hmm?

1469
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,898
-Uh, Poopies said he doesn't believe you.
-[circus music playing]

1470
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,859
-You don't?
-[Poopies] I didn't say that.

1471
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,194
-Totally said that!
-He said it!

1472
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,405
-Oh, I'm mad now.
-[Johnny] Yeah.

1473
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:28,906
[man] That hurts!

1474
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,284
-[groans]
-[all grunt]

1475
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,119
-Oh!
-[Shannon giggles]

1476
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,161
[group laughs]

1477
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,706
[screams] Why'd you get me?

1478
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,165
-[Shannon laughs]
-The fuck?

1479
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,127
-You need to get Poopies.
-Yeah. Poopies is the one way left.

1480
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,128
Way left.

1481
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,755
-[Chris] Poopies' wiener is asking for it.
-[Shannon grunts]

1482
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:47,842
-[Poopies groans]
-[group cheering and laughing]

1483
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,136
-[man] Yeah!
-[thuds loudly]

1484
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,096
-[group applauds]
-[Eric] Yeah!

1485
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,598
-[Chris] Calm down.
-[Eric] Right.

1486
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,892
[group laughing]

1487
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,768
What about this side, Shannon?

1488
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:01,647
Ow. Motherfucker! Goddamn it!

1489
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:03,524
Leave the rookies alone!

1490
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,067
-[Shannon grunts]
-[groans]

1491
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,068
[Eric cheers]

1492
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,696
He only has one ball, and you hit it.

1493
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,072
[group and Shannon laughing]

1494
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,950
-I gotta get that middle one.
-[Wee Man] Ooh.

1495
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,660
-[Shannon grunts]
-[Johnny groans]

1496
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,245
[Chris] There you go.

1497
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,373
-I've gotten hit. Oh shit.
-[Shannon grunts]

1498
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,375
[Johnny] She's reckless.

1499
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,711
[group groaning]

1500
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,256
-[Shannon grunts]
-[Eric yelps] Oh!

1501
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,549
[Steve-O laughs]

1502
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,093
-[Shannon grunts]
-[Eric groans]

1503
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,678
-She hit me twice!
-[Poopies] Oh, man.

1504
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,555
Oh, one man standing.

1505
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:36,515
Chest up. Chest up.

1506
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,225
-[Ehren] Chest up!
-[Chris] Make me proud.

1507
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,810
-[Shannon] Yeah.
-[Steve-O grunts]

1508
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,062
[Wee Man] Get him good.

1509
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,104
[Shannon grunts]

1510
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,732
-[group groaning and laughing]
-[Shannon] C'mon!

1511
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:47,401
[Chris] Oh, wow.

1512
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,320
Yeah, Shannon. Whoo.

1513
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:51,072
-Yes. Oh my God.
-Nice.

1514
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:53,240
-[Steve-O] God!
-Nice.

1515
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,826
[Steve-O] Oh God,
that was so fuckin' right on.

1516
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,079
-[Shannon chuckles]
-[Steve-O] Thank you, Shannon.

1517
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,455
[group laughs]

1518
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:00,623
Way to go.

1519
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,917
-[scoffs] You're welcome?
-[Chris grunts, sighs]

1520
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,419
I heard Knoxville
go over to that tennis professional,

1521
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,880
and he goes,
"See that big fat guy over there?"

1522
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,632
"I want you to hit him right here."

1523
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,926
Where I'd been shot by the elephant gun.

1524
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:15,054
And I thought that it'd be pretty hard
for that tennis lady to do that.

1525
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,639
But no, she could curve it right there.

1526
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,140
-[man 1] Whoa.
-[man 2] Let's see.

1527
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,058
[man 3] Let's see, P.

1528
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,935
[man 4] Oh my God! She hit that?

1529
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,853
-This center part is new.
-[man 5] How dare you!

1530
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,814
-[Chris] Literally a bull's-eye.
-This is new.

1531
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:27,608
-[Chris] It's like tie-dye.
-[group laughs]

1532
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:33,906
All right, you guys. We're up
in one of the buildings right here,

1533
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,784
and, um, they're filming the opening,
so, take a look.

1534
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:39,036
[director on PA] Background and action!

1535
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,872
-[explosions blast]
-[extras screaming]

1536
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,463
[Eric laughs] Whoa, dude.

1537
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:52,466
-[group chuckling]
-Oh my God!

1538
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,511
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville.
Welcome to Jackass!

1539
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:57,722
[Jeff] So, the big opening sequence
of Jackass Forever

1540
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,391
started off as a much smaller idea.

1541
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:04,812
We wanted to do
this sort of '70s monster movie,

1542
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:07,898
where Chris's penis
was attacking a miniature city.

1543
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:11,193
The airbrush is chillier
on the balls. [chuckles]

1544
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,237
-It was never gonna be the opening.
-Right.

1545
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,697
It was always gonna be a bit.

1546
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:16,741
[interviewer] What's gonna happen?

1547
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:21,829
Well, the sea monster
is going to lay waste to this town.

1548
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,791
[Johnny] Trying to get our talent
in the proper position

1549
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,377
for, uh, the sea monster to perform.

1550
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,588
There we go.

1551
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:33,340
I see the fearsome sea monster.

1552
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:36,052
I mean, poor Chris was
in the most awkward position

1553
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,470
'cause he's under the set.

1554
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,930
[interviewer] You look
like you're having sex with the set.

1555
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,141
I kind of am.

1556
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:45,603
[Jeff] And we basically cut a hole
in the middle of the street,

1557
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:48,230
and Chris had to fit his penis through it.

1558
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:52,526
[laughs] Well, the monster's "thighs,"
his balls,

1559
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:56,614
kept dropping down
from underneath the, uh, sandpaper street

1560
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:58,240
we had built for him.

1561
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,076
[Johnny] Here. I'm going to--

1562
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,453
-I've gotta push your balls through, okay?
-No worries.

1563
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,456
-Okay. This is me, Pontius.
-[Chris] No worries.

1564
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:09,960
[Johnny] Like, I knew we had a problem,
and I knew I had a solution.

1565
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,589
And by God, I was right there.

1566
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:17,635
And if Pontius needed me to do that again,
I'd be there again.

1567
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:22,098
[sighs] I wasn't plannin' on this
when I came to work today.

1568
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,475
[director] Let's try to make this happen.
Let's go.

1569
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:26,727
-[Johnny exhales]
-[man 1] Well done.

1570
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,979
-Yeah, moviemaking.
-[man 2] Mm-hmm.

1571
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:32,233
I think as soon as we started shooting it
that day, we were like,

1572
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:35,569
"This is a great idea,"
and then we looked at the test footage.

1573
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,948
-[dramatic music playing]
-[monster howling]

1574
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:41,367
[smoke hisses]

1575
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,452
[Jeff] Man, it looks so funny.

1576
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,705
And that's when we decided to make it
the open and not just a bit.

1577
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:50,209
[monster roars]

1578
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,671
-[Spike] I started getting excited.
-And then the idea started growing.

1579
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:55,589
[director] Three, two, one!

1580
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:58,384
[explosion blasts]

1581
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:01,428
-Yeah. Then the idea started growing.
-And then kept growing.

1582
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:04,723
[monster coughs, cries, growls]

1583
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,268
[soldiers groan]

1584
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,191
Yeah, it kept growing.

1585
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,901
And the budget kept expanding.

1586
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,736
-It kept doubling.
-It kept doubling.

1587
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:21,699
-[director] Background and action!
-[extras screaming]

1588
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:26,453
[explosions blast]

1589
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:30,082
I just wanted it to be right.

1590
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,794
And I would settle for no--
nothing but the best.

1591
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:36,338
Every time Spike
opened his mouth, it was just, like,

1592
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,049
millions of dollars
were just falling out of it.

1593
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,719
-[both laugh]
-Uh…

1594
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:43,304
[interviewer] Pretty exciting.

1595
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:45,431
-[man] Hey!
-[Steve-O] It's a big deal, dude.

1596
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,809
It's an expensive dick joke.

1597
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,228
[Steve-O] The opening sequence
and the ending

1598
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:54,064
have always felt
like real, blockbuster Hollywood.

1599
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,525
-[Chris] Yeah.
-We feel like movie stars when we do this.

1600
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,735
Oh, yeah. It's so fun.

1601
01:09:57,818 --> 01:10:00,946
-Rest of the time, we feel like schmucks.
-Yeah. Exactly.

1602
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,991
-[machinery whirring]
-[Steve-O thudding and grunting]

1603
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:09,121
-Okay, stop! Stop.
-[man 1] He said, "Stop."

1604
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,165
[Steve-O breathing heavily]

1605
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,459
-[poop splattering]
-[shoes squeak]

1606
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:17,046
-[Steve-O] I hit my head fuckin' hard.
-[woman] Listen, lay down that way.

1607
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:19,298
[Steve-O groans, spits]

1608
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:21,008
[loudly] Did we get it?

1609
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:24,887
[grunts]

1610
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,139
[groans] Did we get it?

1611
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,558
-[woman] We-- We good?
-[man 2] No, we don't.

1612
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,393
It was really strenuous to film.

1613
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,230
It was… it got so physically demanding.

1614
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,690
I'd always be in these weird positions.

1615
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,525
He's completely vulnerable too.

1616
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:41,445
And it's cold
where we were shooting, and, like--

1617
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:43,781
And we're shooting pyro
that he can't even see.

1618
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:48,035
There's all this pyro on either side,
just blasting little debris into his dick,

1619
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:49,870
and he doesn't even see it coming.

1620
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,664
[interviewer] Tell me
about these puppeteers.

1621
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,249
It's very exciting.

1622
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:56,085
The puppeteers are very exciting people.

1623
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:57,253
[puppeteer chuckles]

1624
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,921
My favorite thing is, like,

1625
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,758
we pulled out, like,
the best people on every level.

1626
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:05,636
The guy who's puppeteering it,
he's the guy who did

1627
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,846
the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man
in Ghostbusters.

1628
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,932
He's just got this list of credentials.

1629
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,643
We brought in Elia Popov,
who does special effects

1630
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,311
for these huge blockbuster movies.

1631
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:17,231
And this really talented DP, Shasta Spahn.

1632
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:20,234
And our production designer,
Shepherd Frankel, who does Marvel movies,

1633
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:22,361
designed this amazing set for us.

1634
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:26,198
-And Tony Gardner's done these really--
-[Spike] Academy Award-nominated movies.

1635
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,867
[Jeff] People who have worked their way
to the top.

1636
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,287
We're just dragging everybody down
to their lowest.

1637
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:36,125
They brought their A-level skills
to our D-level idea.

1638
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,459
[all laugh]

1639
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:41,297
Why did we come up with so many ideas
that were penises? What was our…

1640
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,881
Apparently, as you get older…

1641
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,384
-That's all you can think of?
-It's all you can think of.

1642
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,261
[all laugh]

1643
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:50,139
But Jackass Forever has more penis in it

1644
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:52,933
than any R-rated movie
in the history of R-rated movies.

1645
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,686
-[Spike] More penis hits or more penis?
-[Jeff] Just penis in it.

1646
01:11:55,769 --> 01:11:59,481
Penises are biologically fascinating
and so underused,

1647
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,860
like, as far as movies go
and just entertainment.

1648
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:03,861
I don't know why.

1649
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:05,738
It's like, little boys know it.

1650
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:09,408
When you're a little boy, you run around,
doing crazy stuff with your penis.

1651
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:12,411
Flippin' it around,
peein' on things, doing all this stuff.

1652
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:16,582
It's like, why do we all forget that
as we go into adulthood, y'know?

1653
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:19,418
So, thank heavens
that we didn't. [chuckles]

1654
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:22,504
'Cause there's so much
you can do with it.

1655
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,883
Now it's time
for a friendly game of chance.

1656
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:27,926
Here we stand,
with our penises tethered to bricks

1657
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,179
that we're going to drop
to the ground below.

1658
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:32,806
Unfortunately, one of the strings
is too short.

1659
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,642
Actually, two of the strings
are too short.

1660
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,061
I wonder who it is.

1661
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:39,021
[group laughing]

1662
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,232
We don't know.
That's why we have to play the game.

1663
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,651
-I know, dude.
-[Johnny] Are we ready?

1664
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:47,946
Three, two, one, drop.

1665
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:48,906
[Steve-O grunts]

1666
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:50,991
[Steve-O and Dave scream]

1667
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:52,951
[group groans]

1668
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,745
-[Chris] Bro.
-[Steve-O moans]

1669
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,415
-[Chris] Yeah.
-Ow.

1670
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,919
-[Steve-O moans]
-Oh, it's bleeding. Oh, it's bleeding.

1671
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,253
[Chris] Ah.

1672
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:06,006
-[Dave screaming]
-[Johnny] Oh shit!

1673
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:11,470
The thing is, is where you tie it
is behind your balls.

1674
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,222
So, I only have one ball,

1675
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:17,017
so I don't have that anchor point
that some of the other guys do.

1676
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:20,270
Threw the brick, and it slid past that
and caught me mid-shaft

1677
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,481
and just pinched as tight as it could

1678
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:26,777
and then stretched my wiener to a…
I'm gonna have to say a good foot long.

1679
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:30,155
I really don't think you could come closer
to ripping your dick off than that.

1680
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,451
I really don't think you can, and I am
so dumb for agreeing to do it at all.

1681
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,912
-Just, the vein.
-[group groans]

1682
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:38,831
-My dick's ruined!
-[Steve-O] Oh!

1683
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,290
[man] Holy shit.

1684
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:42,209
[Steve-O] It has love spikes now.

1685
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:45,003
That bit was like a bruised dick.
You just can't beat it.

1686
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,089
[group laughs]

1687
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:52,344
Making these movies is really probably
the funnest thing that I think you can do.

1688
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:55,764
God. What a great time it's been,
hanging out with all your friends.

1689
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:59,393
It's so rare to have the chemistry
of this… of a group of people

1690
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:01,728
that come together
to make something like this.

1691
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,064
And every single person
is so important to the mix.

1692
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,733
Everyone was gonna make this one count.
It was obvious.

1693
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,445
It felt like we were all unsure
going into it,

1694
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,322
but coming out of it,
it felt as good as all the others.

1695
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:15,784
In the friendships that not only remain,

1696
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,579
but have gotten stronger
over the years, uh,

1697
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:23,459
really mean a lot, and, uh, for us
to still be doing this after 20 years…

1698
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,629
For there to be interest
and for us to physically be able

1699
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:31,175
and for it to be as fun as it is,
I think that's special.

1700
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:36,346
So what we have
behind me is my dad, Dark Shark.

1701
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:43,187
He made his name up himself, but this man
is a OG Crip gangbanger from Los Angeles.

1702
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,606
Doesn't bang anymore,
but been through a lot.

1703
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:49,276
Been to prison multiple times,
probably did a lot of dirt in the hood.

1704
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:52,029
You know, been through--
How many times you been shot?

1705
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:53,906
Got nine bullet holes in me.

1706
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,616
[Jasper] Been shot nine times, still here.

1707
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:57,743
But when it comes
to little things like birds

1708
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,287
and flying in a, I don't know, a airplane,

1709
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:02,414
just simple things
you don't see in the hood,

1710
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,416
it makes him very scared.

1711
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,753
Dark Shark is terrified of flying,
and, uh…

1712
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,924
So we thought, "All right.
What's the scariest thing we could do?"

1713
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,051
Let's make him skydive.

1714
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:16,261
Then we started adding on to the bit.

1715
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:19,598
Like, "Yeah, let's make him skydive.
Let's make everything go wrong."

1716
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,518
This is Jasper,
and today we're gonna fulfill

1717
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:25,604
your father's lifelong dream
of jumping out of a plane.

1718
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:26,813
He's very excited.

1719
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,440
-Yes.
-He's not excited.

1720
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,651
I'm scared as fuck.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1721
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:32,486
Scared as fuck, fuck, fuck.

1722
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:35,531
But, um, y'know,
I'm with the big boys now, you know?

1723
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:38,033
Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O,
Wee Man, and them.

1724
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:41,662
He doesn't know that "the plane
is gonna take a little oopsie."

1725
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:44,581
And also, the pilot's gonna jump out
in the middle of it.

1726
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,750
So, shit is gonna get
a little bit of real.

1727
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:49,294
Scared of airplanes, scared of heights.

1728
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:54,132
Second time I'm ever on a fuckin' plane,
and I'm finna jump out.

1729
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,885
He's flown once before.
And how did that go?

1730
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:59,555
We took this man to Hawaii,
and he cried the whole way there.

1731
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,265
Had his eyes closed the whole time.

1732
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:04,434
[Dark Shark] Yeah, I been scared of planes
all my life. I pump myself up.

1733
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,311
That was my first time on a plane.

1734
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,854
[laughing]

1735
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,481
I closed my eyes the whole way.

1736
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,150
-Tears in my goddamn eyes.
-[Jasper laughs]

1737
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:15,112
[Dark Shark] Not cryin',
but, uh, tears came out my eyes.

1738
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:19,074
This is Boyd, our pilot.
He's gonna be flying the plane today.

1739
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:24,413
And Boyd, I just beg of you,
just no turbulence, as safe as possible.

1740
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:26,039
Don't upset Dark Shark.

1741
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,332
-Nice and smooth.
-Yeah.

1742
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,709
-I can do that.
-Thank you.

1743
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:31,962
[laughs] Oh Lord.

1744
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:34,464
-[dramatic music playing]
-[onlookers cheer]

1745
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:37,342
[Johnny] From Longwood, California…

1746
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,719
[Dark Shark laughs]

1747
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:43,348
…the workin' girls' dream,
the old maids' delight, Dark Shark!

1748
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:44,891
I'mma cry like a bitch.

1749
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:46,602
How'd I get here?

1750
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,478
[group cheers]

1751
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:52,065
-How'd I get here? A blessing, though.
-Bring it in. We got this.

1752
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:55,152
-Yeah, Dark Shark. You got it, buddy.
-[Dark Shark] Goddamn.

1753
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:57,362
-You ready?
-Hell no.

1754
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:02,618
-Yeah, Dark Shark.
-[Dark Shark groans]

1755
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:05,162
[Jasper] Already got the first step done.

1756
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:07,331
Yeah.

1757
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:09,833
[ominous music playing]

1758
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:14,713
-[Dark Shark exhales]
-You got this.

1759
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:18,717
-Our pilot is solid as they come.
-[engines whir]

1760
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,055
[man 1] Whoo.

1761
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,766
[Johnny] Yeah, Dark Shark.

1762
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:30,854
How high are we gonna be when we jump?
How many feet?

1763
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:32,022
-Two thousand.
-[man 2] High.

1764
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:34,691
-[Johnny] Thirteen thousand feet.
-[man 3] First for me.

1765
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,699
Everyone's wavin' to you, Dark Shark.

1766
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,701
[group cheers]

1767
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:52,459
[Johnny] He was so terrified, right?

1768
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:55,337
He was in a fear lock on the way up.

1769
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:59,966
He just took both of his elbows
and just pressed them into me and Jasper.

1770
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,427
And he just… he was somewhere else.

1771
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:06,264
As the plane takes off,
you know, he's already terrified.

1772
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,724
He's just, like…

1773
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:09,559
[breathing deeply]

1774
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,813
He ain't sayin' nothin',
and then Johnny's cracking little jokes.

1775
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:14,106
You got this.

1776
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:16,942
[Dark Shark breathing deeply]

1777
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:18,860
[mouthing] He doesn't got this.

1778
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,780
It was real quiet on that plane,
aside for me mouthing off.

1779
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:24,199
[Johnny] We're at 4,100 feet.

1780
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:28,912
I kept telling him, like,
"Oh, 3,100 feet, 4,700 feet."

1781
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:30,288
Just tryin' to get in his head.

1782
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,666
[Johnny] Now we're at 7,000 feet.

1783
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:39,214
It's pretty smooth, though, right? Really.

1784
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,008
Why the fuck you get on this damn plane?
