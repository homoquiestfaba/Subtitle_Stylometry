1
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,331
Raymond Taylor?

2
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:31,247
How can you remember that?

3
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:32,770
How could she not?

4
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:35,643
That was the last time the
three of us came here together.

5
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:39,386
We had to call 911 because
your braces got stuck to his.

6
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:41,301
Oh it was so horrible.

7
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:44,304
I can still remember the
pieces of chili cheese dog

8
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:45,609
trapped between us.

9
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,959
Well speaking of chili
cheese dogs, I'm hungry.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,040
Let's get something to eat.

11
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:53,443
That's when I realized
I've never had a friend

12
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:55,750
try to set me up
with their friends.

13
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:58,100
Should I be scared
to find out why?

14
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,275
Maybe I should be offended.

15
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:01,103
I did try and set you up.

16
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:02,539
The 7th grade doesn't count.

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,672
Don't worry you're
gonna meet someone.

18
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,630
Besides, we can't all be
as lucky as Helen here

19
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:09,633
and be a stay at home mom,
with a perfect husband

20
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:12,115
and a pair of slightly
spoiled, but adorable kids.

21
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:16,118
Who are in need of a
little brother or sister.

22
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,641
You and Brian better
get to work on that.

23
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:18,903
Oh, no, no, no, no.

24
00:01:18,904 --> 00:01:20,992
One boy and one girl
is just right for me.

25
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,168
Next.

26
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:24,126
Hi, can I get a
single cheeseburger?

27
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,128
Wait, no, make that a double.

28
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:30,785
A corn dog, extra large fries
and an extra large drink.

29
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,482
Oh, can I also get
some chile cheese fries

30
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,658
and a extra large
strawberry shake.

31
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,487
Is that for all
of us or just you?

32
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:38,836
- Me.
- Oh.

33
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:39,751
What?

34
00:01:39,752 --> 00:01:41,361
I'm hungry.

35
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:45,539
Can you make that a
triple cheeseburger?

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,542
You gonna finish that?

37
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:50,110
Enjoy.

38
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,980
Thanks, man.

39
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:54,201
Ooh, look at her, gorgeous.

40
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:57,072
Do you ever stop?

41
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:01,904
If you were a Transformer,
you'd be Optimus Fine.

42
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:05,602
Have any of your
lines actually worked?

43
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,126
I swing and miss often.

44
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,431
But in professional baseball

45
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:09,998
getting a hit three
out of 10 times

46
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:13,611
is considered an excellent
average, my friend.

47
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,050
Oh I see where you're looking.

48
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:20,617
You know the question is,

49
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:22,358
are you going to
step up to the plate

50
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:24,447
or you gonna watch
from the stands?

51
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:25,666
You're embarrassing.

52
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,755
No, this is a
momentous occasion.

53
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:30,540
I can't remember the last time
you even looked at a woman.

54
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,108
Well, not since Jessica.

55
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:34,109
Yeah.

56
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:39,636
I know.

57
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,075
Where are the kids today?

58
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:46,121
Oh, Brian took the
day off to be with them.

59
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:47,470
The kids wanted him
to bring them here,

60
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:49,080
but I know somehow
they'd find me

61
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,344
and I'd be covered
in dirt and food.

62
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:55,086
You're doing a pretty
good job all on your own.

63
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,697
So, how's work?

64
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:57,959
Same as always.

65
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,439
Haven't you been stuck
there for five years?

66
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,180
I wouldn't put it that way.

67
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,920
It's a job and it's steady.

68
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,184
Plus, I'm even getting
a promotion soon.

69
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,620
Oh, that's awesome.

70
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,665
I couldn't sit in front
of a computer all day.

71
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,233
But a Computer and
Information Systems Manager

72
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,193
sounds important, right

73
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:17,500
I really don't think I would
change a thing with my life.

74
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,023
Everything's great.

75
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:20,024
Knock on wood.

76
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,201
That's metal.

77
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,420
I just didn't picture you single

78
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:25,595
and sitting in
front of a computer

79
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:27,641
at this point in your life.

80
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:29,425
Not that there is
anything wrong with that.

81
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:31,993
What did you picture
her life like then?

82
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:33,212
I don't know,

83
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,431
married, maybe a kid or two,

84
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:36,563
working as a nurse,

85
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:37,738
you used to carry band-aids

86
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,087
around in your
pockets growing up.

87
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:40,697
I did want to become a nurse.

88
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:42,133
And not everyone has the goal

89
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:43,613
of getting hitched Helen.

90
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,659
I'm not saying she
should be married,

91
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,271
I'm just saying, I
thought she would be.

92
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:52,841
Well, like I said, I am
happy just the way things are.

93
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,761
Now's your chance,
here they come.

94
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:01,676
No, no, no, no, no.

95
00:04:01,677 --> 00:04:04,068
You're not gonna say anything?

96
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,635
It's all right man, I got you.

97
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:07,942
Oh it's handy that I
brought my library card

98
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:10,553
because I'm totally
checking you out.

99
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,512
Was that addressed
to all three of us

100
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:14,949
or did you feel like
singling one of us out?

101
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,821
Because she is married,
she's unavailable

102
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:20,476
and I'm not interested.

103
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:22,652
Well, tell me this,
are you religious?

104
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:25,134
Because you are the
answer to my prayers.

105
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,181
I'll start
praying for you to disappear.

106
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,661
Ooh, ouch.

107
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,837
Come on, you guys, you should
be ashamed of yourselves.

108
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,448
I take no part in this.

109
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,363
I imagine you two
should be here working

110
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:40,366
not wasting tax payer money
hitting on the guests.

111
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:41,845
Hang on, I think
you misunderstood.

112
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:43,370
No, you're done.

113
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:47,374
Why don't you keep
an eye on him.

114
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,290
Have a good day.

115
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,076
What?
Come on.

116
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,686
You are vicious.

117
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:57,905
Honest, is all.

118
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,298
Unavailable?

119
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,387
Well unavailable to them, yes.

120
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,737
Allison.

121
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:04,695
Me?

122
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:07,219
I've been expecting you.

123
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:10,091
Come in.

124
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,051
Come in.
Do you know her?

125
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,714
- Really are we doing this?
- Come on.

126
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:37,553
Which one of you be
liking to go first?

127
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:38,947
Sure, why not?

128
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,301
Your palm.

129
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,354
I see green aventurine

130
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:59,489
with dark, brown stones.

131
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:03,231
Tiger's eye.

132
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:04,799
And black obsidian.

133
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:09,804
And I'm coming to a divide.

134
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,895
One side feels intense

135
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:18,507
and will become successful.

136
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:21,381
You will innovate,
adapt and grow.

137
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:26,037
Other side will decline.

138
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:32,521
A challenging assignment will
likely give you opportunity

139
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,350
to prove your mettle.

140
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:37,484
But you are up to the task.

141
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:42,052
A little vague but I'll take it.

142
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,490
Okay, I'm next.

143
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:47,450
Hi.

144
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:53,412
Now, what I am looking
for is peace of mind,

145
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,674
to be skinnier

146
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:57,459
and maybe my husband
to be a little more.

147
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,808
Ouch.

148
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:00,637
Close your eyes.

149
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:06,816
Do not keep things
in your heart,

150
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,645
share them with
the one you love.

151
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:13,607
It will only improve your
mutual understanding.

152
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:20,177
What, no tiger's
blood or stones for me?

153
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:21,178
No colors?

154
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,356
Rouge.

155
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,535
Double rouge.

156
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:32,277
Heavier times.

157
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:38,979
That's it?

158
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,850
That's all I get?

159
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:41,069
It's plenty.

160
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,163
Thank you.

161
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:51,470
Okay, my turn.

162
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,865
Destiny has much
in store for you.

163
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:58,782
Spit.

164
00:07:58,782 --> 00:07:59,740
Huh?

165
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:01,350
[Madame Zoe Spit.

166
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:05,180
I think she wants you
to spit in her hand.

167
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,621
Oh, disgusting.

168
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,191
The sun,

169
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:19,846
the moon

170
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:22,284
and the stars are converging.

171
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,330
Universe is pushing you

172
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:29,552
to embrace the
changes of the three.

173
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,341
The stars shows, you will
find new place to call home.

174
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,042
The scales of the
moon are imbalanced

175
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:45,524
and you will need
to find a new trade.

176
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,222
Something that is
closer to your heart.

177
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:49,223
At last,

178
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:54,751
the fiery sun urges you
to be on the lookout

179
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,233
for your soulmate,

180
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,323
a man named John.

181
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,982
He will be the
love of your life.

182
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:13,856
She told me the exact
opposite of what I wanted.

183
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,118
I asked for skinny

184
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,816
and she tells me heavy.

185
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:18,687
Does that mean I
am gonna get fat?

186
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:21,908
I would have been happy
if she predicted mono.

187
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,257
Why did you say you
wanted your husband

188
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:24,954
to be a little more average?

189
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,695
Okay, this may sound strange,

190
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:29,785
but sometimes my
husband drives me crazy.

191
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,004
- What?
- What?

192
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:33,136
Don't get me wrong, I love Brian

193
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:37,314
but sometimes he is
too perfect, you know.

194
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,447
He's too loving and caring.

195
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,318
Oh, that sounds terrible.

196
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:43,799
My heart bleeds for you.

197
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,019
Well, at least I'm
excited about my fortune,

198
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,761
a challenging assignment
that will test my mettle.

199
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,153
Well then Ali gets
the mother load.

200
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:50,981
What was it,

201
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:51,808
a new home,

202
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:53,330
a trade, must be job.

203
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:54,984
Oh and a new man named John.

204
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:56,638
No.

205
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,031
And please no.

206
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:00,599
I have an amazing apartment
and my job is secure

207
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,472
and I have no
interests in any Johns.

208
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,170
All right, go ahead.

209
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,650
What do you think
she meant by heavy?

210
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,999
Oh don't give it any credence,

211
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,827
it's just vague guess work.

212
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:14,700
Oh, only two at a
time when you are so.

213
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,876
If you say big, so help me.

214
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:18,922
When you are an adult.

215
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,533
Only two adults per chair.

216
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:23,926
Okay.

217
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:27,888
You guys can go ahead,
I'll just catch the next one.

218
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,458
Here we go.

219
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,851
All right, go ahead.

220
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:36,679
Thanks.

221
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,724
Have fun.

222
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:41,030
You ride one of these before?

223
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:43,163
Yeah, they're lots of fun.

224
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:43,947
I'm Ali.

225
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:44,948
I'm John.

226
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:48,385
I'm sorry, did you say, John?

227
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:49,605
John Kimball.

228
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,045
Guys, you're never guess
who I'm up here with.

229
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,133
Who's that?

230
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:59,876
My new friend, John Kimball.

231
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,881
You see, the predictions
are already coming true.

232
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:09,798
Are you afraid of heights?

233
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,888
I don't think so.

234
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,502
I should probably answer this.

235
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,244
Hi, this is Ali.

236
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:22,637
What?

237
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,770
How did this happen?

238
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:26,816
Could anything be saved?

239
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:30,471
I understand.

240
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,735
Thanks for letting me know.

241
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,477
Everything okay?

242
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:40,960
My apartment flooded and
there is a lot of damage.

243
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:43,136
How much is a lot?

244
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:44,964
Like I could charge
people admission

245
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,182
to come and swim.

246
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:47,532
What?

247
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:53,842
The first part of the fortune.

248
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:56,324
It has to be a coincidence.

249
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:07,335
Just catch the
next one, I guess.

250
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:19,869
Oh, no, not again.

251
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,132
Not again?

252
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:26,441
I'll get help.

253
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,620
That can't be good.

254
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:34,884
Don't worry John.

255
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:43,326
Okay, I've decided
I don't like heights.

256
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:44,502
Me neither.

257
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:47,026
I mean, when we are
moving it's one thing

258
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:49,986
but being stationery is
a whole different story.

259
00:12:57,298 --> 00:12:58,820
Is that?

260
00:12:58,821 --> 00:12:59,821
Yup.

261
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:03,652
Hi.

262
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:04,652
You?

263
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,046
You guys wanna
come down from there?

264
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,177
Yes, sir.

265
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:09,918
Yes, please.

266
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,051
Be careful.

267
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:13,835
I've got you.

268
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,017
All right, hold on.

269
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:36,902
Ali, Ali.

270
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,649
Thank you, mister.

271
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,914
We're back on the ground.

272
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,480
Right, oh.

273
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:53,441
Why don't we get
you out of here.

274
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:56,747
Sorry.

275
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:57,879
Bye.

276
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,403
You are so brave.

277
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:01,449
Thank you.

278
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:03,711
Sean.

279
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:04,669
Sean Carpenter.

280
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,061
Sean.

281
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,020
Hi, we were so
worried about you.

282
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:10,718
I've been stress eating so bad.

283
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:13,287
Do you have some water.

284
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:29,389
Hey.

285
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,433
Hi.

286
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:31,434
Come in.

287
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,351
Thanks for letting me stay.

288
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:36,266
Yeah, of course.

289
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:37,919
Stay as long as you need.

290
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Is this it?

291
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,619
Pretty much everything
was ruined in the flood.

292
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,927
My clothes, my
computer, my furniture.

293
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,582
Even my toothbrush.

294
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,019
I was planning on donating
these to a thrift store,

295
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,110
but they've lived in my trunk
for the past several months.

296
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:57,939
They smell like they
died in your trunk.

297
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,376
I'll introduce you to my
washing machine later.

298
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:01,464
What are you working on?

299
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:02,944
Oh, a commercial.

300
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,120
Oh, what kinda actors
are you looking for?

301
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,644
Just one happily married couple.

302
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:09,168
I have already found the wife,

303
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:11,039
but I'm still looking
for right actor

304
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,606
to play the part of the husband.

305
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:13,781
Everyone I've put up
on the board though

306
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:15,304
just doesn't feel right.

307
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:16,176
The board?

308
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:17,654
Oh, casting board.

309
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:20,048
Basically photos of all
the potential actors.

310
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,572
We like to see who
looks good together.

311
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:25,402
Oh, it's Helen.

312
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:27,665
Hello.

313
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,188
Hey, is Ali with you?

314
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:30,711
I'm right here.

315
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,843
Okay, do I need to
be the one who says it?

316
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:33,715
Says what?

317
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,369
Madame Zoe was right.

318
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:38,414
She got one thing right.

319
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:39,763
There's no way she
could have guessed

320
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,896
your apartment would flood.

321
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,245
I have yet to be
presented with something

322
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,638
that will test my mettle.

323
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,945
I haven't had a production
I couldn't cast.

324
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,816
Yeah, well, it
hasn't even been a few hours,

325
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,426
I'd give it time.

326
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:51,819
No way.

327
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,560
Besides, I have a promotion
coming up at work.

328
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:56,867
I'm meeting with my
bosses about it, tomorrow.

329
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:58,521
And you can borrow
some of my clothes.

330
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,001
Thank you.

331
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,047
So you see Helen, you have
nothing to worry about.

332
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:03,700
Fine, bye.

333
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,572
Okay, sorry about that.

334
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:08,054
"Oh dear, elephant got
scared and ran away."

335
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:13,536
Hi.

336
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:16,017
Bob.
Ali.

337
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,714
- Harold.
- Ali.

338
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:18,934
- Tina.
- Ali.

339
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,066
New guy.

340
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:24,765
I'm Ali.

341
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:26,942
Have a seat.

342
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,684
This is Richard.

343
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:32,599
He's part of a
consulting company

344
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,473
that helps restructure
corporations in transition.

345
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:38,474
Great.

346
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:40,476
I mean, I know this promotion's

347
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:42,174
gonna be coming with
a lot of changes

348
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:45,699
but what kinda transition
are we talking about here?

349
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,788
Downsizing.

350
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:54,099
We're not here to
give me the promotion?

351
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,926
You promised me
this six months ago.

352
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:56,927
I know.

353
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,714
But your whole department
is going to be consolidated.

354
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:03,369
We through time,
hopefully we can rehire.

355
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,067
Well, after the
restructure period.

356
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,417
We need to streamline ourselves

357
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:09,898
through corporate restructuring.

358
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:21,126
That good of a day, hah?

359
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,257
I got canned.

360
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,085
What?

361
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:24,955
Discharged, axed,

362
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:27,784
laid-off, furloughed,
let go, terminated.

363
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,047
Just like that?

364
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,526
They gave me the option

365
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:33,834
of staying until the end of
the week or leaving today.

366
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,358
Oh, Ali, I'm so sorry.

367
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,447
I should have seen
the warning signs.

368
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:40,449
The numerous
closed-door meetings,

369
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,582
no new hires,

370
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,237
the decrease of work loads.

371
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:46,499
Ice cream?

372
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,544
Ice cream.

373
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,459
It's over.

374
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,287
It's the end.

375
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:53,984
I can't go on.

376
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:55,595
Did someone die?

377
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:56,596
No.

378
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,731
I'm pregnant.

379
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:03,037
With twins.

380
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,044
We're out of tissues.

381
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,830
I'll see if I have another box.

382
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,876
How far along are you?

383
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:17,225
Almost three months.

384
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:18,357
Do you know what your having?

385
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:19,185
Boys?

386
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:20,228
Girls?

387
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,621
One of each?

388
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:24,014
I have another
ultrasound in a few weeks.

389
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:26,017
Do you know what you want?

390
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,715
This is all I could find.

391
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,151
Thank you.

392
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,979
Well, if you're extra
hungry during your pregnancy,

393
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,634
you're probably pregnant
with a boy, right?

394
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,418
That's not proven, is it?

395
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,506
By the way you were chowing down

396
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,029
at the carnival the other day,

397
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,076
I'd say you have about half
a baseball team in there.

398
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:44,383
Do you wanna know what
the worst part about it is?

399
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:45,906
What?

400
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,126
Brian is excited.

401
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,693
He's genuinely excited.

402
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,347
Well should he not be?

403
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:53,957
I don't want to be
the one to say this,

404
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,700
but everything Madame Zoe
has said is coming true.

405
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,400
Madame Zoe said double rouge.

406
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:02,488
Double pink.

407
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:04,446
Maybe you're having twin girls.

408
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:07,362
By heavy, she meant
pregnant, not fat.

409
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:08,885
And the first two
parts of my fortune

410
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:10,322
have already come true,

411
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:13,194
needing a new place to
live and needing a new job.

412
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,804
Wait, what?

413
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,677
I lost my job today.

414
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,722
We need to speak with Madame Zoe

415
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,551
and get this straightened out.

416
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,901
It just makes me feel pretty bad

417
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:26,512
trying to reach to
his high standards.

418
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:28,514
I mean, I know I'm a good mom

419
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:31,343
but Brian is always
one step ahead of me,

420
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:32,605
and he doesn't do things

421
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:33,736
because he feels like
he is better than me,

422
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,173
he just wants to help.

423
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,219
But it makes me feel bad.

424
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,577
I don't think the
carnival is open yet.

425
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:49,405
Come on.

426
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,405
Hey, Helen.

427
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:53,409
Hurry.

428
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,670
Okay.

429
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:56,063
I don't even know
how to approach him

430
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,760
and ask him to stop or change.

431
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:00,894
I just want him to relax
sometimes, you know.

432
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,548
Leave the dirty
dishes in the sink

433
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,854
and forget to help the
kids with their homework,

434
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:08,380
watch lots of TV after
coming home from work.

435
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:09,685
It almost sounds
like you're asking

436
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:11,644
how to make Brian
a worse husband,

437
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,080
a less concerned father

438
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:14,822
and a lazier man.

439
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:22,611
Maybe it wasn't a fortune.

440
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,004
It was a curse.

441
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:24,832
Oh my gosh we've been cursed.

442
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,311
We weren't cursed.

443
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:27,964
There was that woman in
Florida who got prison time

444
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:30,140
and had to repay $1.6 million
to a woman she cursed.

445
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:33,840
Stop trying to convince
yourself that we were cursed.

446
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,451
Maybe she's inside.

447
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:38,061
Madame Zoe.

448
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,847
Madame Zoe, are you there?

449
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,414
Madame Zoe.

450
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:44,154
You have to be in there.

451
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:46,113
Madame Zoe.

452
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,376
That's it, I'm going in.

453
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:49,856
What?

454
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:53,076
What are you doing?
You'll see, you'll see.

455
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:55,470
You see, I could have
easily fit through

456
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,298
if I wasn't pregnant.

457
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,952
You try.

458
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,170
That's not a good idea.

459
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:01,476
Oh I'm sorry, but
you're smaller than me.

460
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:02,695
We have to get in there.

461
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:03,262
We have to speak with her.
Fine.

462
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,175
Alright.

463
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:05,175
Gosh.

464
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,183
Oh no.

465
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:14,576
What?

466
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:15,708
I think I'm stuck.

467
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:16,709
How bad?

468
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,190
I can't move.

469
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:22,062
Do you want me to push or pull?

470
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:23,324
Pull.

471
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,109
Okay, yeah, I'm
gonna pull, okay.

472
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,110
You ready?

473
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:30,026
Okay not helping.

474
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:30,985
Not helping.

475
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:31,768
Try sucking in.

476
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:33,508
I am sucking it in.

477
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:35,510
Hello again.

478
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:36,469
Hey.

479
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,208
How's it going?

480
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:40,167
You okay here?

481
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:41,691
- No.
- Yes, fine.

482
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,998
We don't need any help.

483
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:48,175
You won't happen to know
if Madame Zoe is here yet?

484
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:50,220
Oh I think she won't be
back for several weeks.

485
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:51,700
What?

486
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,528
Yeah, the carnival's
moving on to another city,

487
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:54,790
possibly even out of state.

488
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,923
Great.

489
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:58,228
So what are you doing here?

490
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,360
Just here as a safety precaution

491
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:02,189
as everything gets packed up.

492
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,627
Oh, that was really nice
of you the other night,

493
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:08,064
saving that little boy
and my friend here.

494
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:10,372
Of course, happy to help.

495
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:13,635
You sure you're all right?

496
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:14,810
Yes.

497
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:16,377
Good.

498
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,292
Fine.

499
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:19,468
It's nice to see you again.

500
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,383
We better run.

501
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,080
He's super cute.

502
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:25,081
So long.

503
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:32,394
You see what I mean.

504
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:33,655
Not only do the kids love him,

505
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:37,225
but apparently all the
mothers do here as well.

506
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,835
Well, what's not to like?

507
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:40,836
Brooke.

508
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,710
Hey, no more complaining
about Brian, okay?

509
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,799
Just positive things
coming from your mouth.

510
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,062
You're right, you're right.

511
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:50,585
I'll work on it.

512
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,500
So, Madame Zoe is gone?

513
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:54,981
Yeah, for several weeks.

514
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:57,287
What were you planning
on saying to her anyway?

515
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:59,464
That we want a refund.

516
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:01,683
Or for her to take
back what she said.

517
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:04,512
I think it's a little
too late for some things.

518
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:05,818
Well she should.

519
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:08,647
I mean I have to start
my life completely over.

520
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:11,084
I need to find a new
job, a new place to live.

521
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:12,694
I have to buy everything again.

522
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:15,829
It's like I am
starting from scratch.

523
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:20,049
Am I having like a
mid-midlife crisis?

524
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,355
No.

525
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:22,748
Look on the bright side,

526
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:25,011
at least you are not suffering
from pregnancy brain.

527
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,969
And apparently my toes
have decided to grow

528
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,406
along with my belly.

529
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,973
Sadly, I had to say
goodbye to my cute shoes.

530
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:32,888
Positive, remember, Helen?

531
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:34,803
I thought I was being positive.

532
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:36,196
Madame Zoe said
that you will find

533
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:37,980
the love of your life, right?

534
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:39,460
Something like that.

535
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:42,158
Okay, well instead of
focusing on the negative,

536
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,379
let's really do focus
on the positive here.

537
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,469
What exactly did she say?

538
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:51,472
She said something about
looking for my soulmate.

539
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,387
His name being John.

540
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,345
Okay, that sounds
promising to me.

541
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:59,698
A soulmate who will be
the love of your life.

542
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:00,786
We can help you.

543
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:02,352
Yes.

544
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:04,224
What do you mean?

545
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,748
This could be the
challenging assignment.

546
00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:09,490
You know, the one where
I am to prove my mettle.

547
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:12,101
We can help you on your
quest to find the right John.

548
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:13,320
Oh it'll be perfect.

549
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:15,191
It will help keep your
mind off of things

550
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:16,628
and it will give
you something to do.

551
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:17,890
I do have something to do,

552
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:19,413
I have to find a new job.

553
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:22,024
No one's going to date me,
sleeping on your couch.

554
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:23,417
You search for a new job.

555
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:25,681
And we'll find your John.

556
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:32,861
Hey, I got a new one.

557
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:33,776
Oh please, no.

558
00:24:33,777 --> 00:24:36,083
Let me try it out on you.

559
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,216
Go on, feel my jacket.

560
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:42,871
It's made of boyfriend material.

561
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:43,699
No?

562
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,873
That doesn't work?

563
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:46,266
It might be your worst one yet.

564
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:47,485
Okay.

565
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,877
Okay, I got another
one, you ready?

566
00:24:48,878 --> 00:24:50,663
Do I have a choice?

567
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:55,014
Hey, girl, is your name WiFi,

568
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:57,407
'cause we got a connection.

569
00:24:57,408 --> 00:25:00,541
You do realize most
women hate pick up lines.

570
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,717
Oh, are you an
expert on women now?

571
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:03,892
Far from it.

572
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:06,068
Maybe just try saying,
hello, next time.

573
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:08,897
It could work wonders
despite its simplicity.

574
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:10,203
This coming from a guy

575
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:12,553
that who hasn't been
on a date in a year.

576
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,207
Or was it two?

577
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,556
You got a point.

578
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,340
And why is that anyway?

579
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:18,907
I know your heart was broken.

580
00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:22,998
But it has had plenty of
time to repair itself.

581
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:26,741
You know, I did run
into carnival girl again.

582
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:29,091
Brown hair, yellow dress?

583
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:30,050
That's the one.

584
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,050
What?

585
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:34,488
And you thinking you like her?

586
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:36,621
I wouldn't mind
seeing her again.

587
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,448
That's what I'm talking about.

588
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:41,496
Now, what are you
gonna do about it?

589
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:48,197
All right ladies, how
do we go about this?

590
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:51,026
We'll start by putting
together a list of Johns.

591
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:53,463
How many Johns do you know
off the top of your head?

592
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:54,856
Two Johns from work.

593
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:56,336
One from the gym.

594
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:57,424
The mailman.

595
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:58,643
I need last names.

596
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:01,210
The Johns from work
are Peebler and Green.

597
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,823
And the other two I don't know.

598
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:08,391
We'll call them Gym
John and Mailman John.

599
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:10,437
Oh, my old landlord's
name is John.

600
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:11,960
Oh, Landlord John.

601
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:12,961
No, wait.

602
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:15,703
His name is Steve.

603
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:17,270
Oh.

604
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:18,924
But I have down my list
of potential jobs for me,

605
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:19,795
you guys wanna hear?

606
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:20,882
Sure.

607
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,231
Pharmacist.

608
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:23,624
Lawyer.

609
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,017
Dental Hygienist.

610
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:26,235
Librarian.

611
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:27,497
Sales.

612
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:29,369
Educator and nurse.

613
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,632
Oh, you're talking a
complete career change,

614
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,547
not just a new job.

615
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:35,810
I mean, at this point,
I'm not really sure.

616
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:38,030
But something new and different

617
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,162
may be just what I need.

618
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:41,381
That's it?

619
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:42,904
Four names is all
you can come up with?

620
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,732
That should make finding
the right John real easy.

621
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:47,648
Oh no, four does not cut it.

622
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:48,823
Here's what we'll do,

623
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,695
we will all go
through our phones

624
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:54,221
and write down anyone
with the name John.

625
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:02,621
Sean, hold up.

626
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:05,666
What's this?

627
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,407
You can thank me later.

628
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:08,451
Is this?

629
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:09,670
How did you get this?

630
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:10,976
It was with the incident report.

631
00:27:10,977 --> 00:27:12,499
She must have left it.

632
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,674
Now she didn't leave
a phone number,

633
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:17,373
but I do see an
address right there.

634
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:18,636
I don't know.

635
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,463
You're the one
that said you want to

636
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:20,725
get to know her better.

637
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:22,509
And now you have
this opportunity

638
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,815
of chivalrously returning

639
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:26,688
her lost Driver's
License to her.

640
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:30,213
You can thank me later.

641
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,042
To become a Librarian
I would need a Master's

642
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:36,131
in Library and
Information Science.

643
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:39,047
But I can earn this
degree 100 percent online.

644
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:40,746
Ali the librarian?

645
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:43,399
I don't see it.

646
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,966
I guess I'll still
send out my resume

647
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:47,142
to those looking
for an IT manager.

648
00:27:47,143 --> 00:27:49,842
John Moyer and John Underwood.

649
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,539
That's all of them.

650
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,454
How many are on the list now?

651
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:54,846
30, 40?

652
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:55,935
Close, 187.

653
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,894
That's ridiculous.

654
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,461
No.

655
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:02,941
You take half and find
someone for yourself.

656
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:05,160
No, the fortune was about you.

657
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:07,772
She didn't say anything
about my love life.

658
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,077
Look, why don't you
go out for a bit

659
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:11,298
and we can finish this up?

660
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:14,082
Fine.

661
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,431
I do need to see if my landlord

662
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:17,695
was able to salvage
anything else.

663
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,087
Just give us a few hours

664
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,134
and we'll have
everything ready for you.

665
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:36,104
Wouldn't be considered
stalking, would it?

666
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:38,324
No, it's a bad idea, Sean.

667
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:39,368
You should leave.

668
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:41,023
You should definitely leave.

669
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:45,548
Oh no, no, no, you're just
returning this to her,

670
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:47,247
you're already here.

671
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:50,162
I might as well knock.

672
00:28:50,163 --> 00:28:51,685
I can do that.

673
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:53,644
You can do that, Sean.

674
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,777
Hey, does an Ali
Schafer live here?

675
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,474
Are you the insurance adjuster?

676
00:28:58,475 --> 00:28:59,780
No, I'm a friend.

677
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,782
Oh she had to move out.

678
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,784
Her place flooded

679
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:06,352
along with most of the
apartments in this building.

680
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:07,962
Gonna be at this for a while.

681
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:10,617
If you do see her though,

682
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:12,314
tell her she's not gonna
be able to move back in

683
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:13,708
for a few weeks.

684
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,520
Hey.

685
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:46,958
Hey Ali, did your
friend find you?

686
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,786
What friend?

687
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,353
He was just here
looking for you?

688
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:55,618
He, did he leave a name
or say what he wanted?

689
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:57,620
I can't remember.

690
00:29:57,621 --> 00:30:01,015
Oh wait, were you able
to save anything else?

691
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:02,712
- All right, there you are.
- Thank you.

692
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:04,280
Have a great day.

693
00:30:05,281 --> 00:30:06,281
John.

694
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:09,024
Hey I'm John.

695
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:11,679
You have a good day.

696
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,549
Thank you.

697
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:13,333
- Hey babe.
- Hey.

698
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,290
You ready?

699
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,031
Okay let's head out.

700
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:20,470
This is Ali.

701
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:25,693
Yes, I'm so glad my
resume reached you.

702
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:28,564
An interview?

703
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:29,565
Yes.

704
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:32,221
Monday at two.

705
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,790
Yes, I will see you then.

706
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:37,618
Okay great.

707
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:38,706
Thanks again.

708
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:42,579
Monday at two, interview.

709
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:46,756
Oh my goodness.
Excuse me.

710
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:48,193
I am so sorry.

711
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:50,325
I should've been watching
where I was going.

712
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:51,587
Hello again.

713
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:52,459
Hi.

714
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,851
It's Ali, right?

715
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,852
Yes.

716
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:56,811
Sean.

717
00:30:56,812 --> 00:30:58,159
I remember.

718
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,770
I promise I am not
this accident prone.

719
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,903
You just seem to
catch me at my worst.

720
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,339
Been avoiding Ferris Wheels?

721
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,863
At all costs.

722
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,256
Life has been a bit of an
adventure since that night.

723
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:10,563
In a good way or a bad way?

724
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:12,217
Well, let's see,

725
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:13,914
I lost my job.

726
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:14,785
Ouch.

727
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:15,786
My apartment flooded.

728
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:16,700
I know.

729
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:17,918
And the Ferris Wheel incident,

730
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,789
all that within 24 hours.

731
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,008
I'm sorry.

732
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:21,880
Hopefully that's
the worst of it.

733
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,054
Wait, I'm sorry,

734
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:25,273
how did you know
about my apartment?

735
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:26,274
Oh,

736
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:30,757
I tried dropping
this off earlier.

737
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:32,802
You left it when filling
out the incident report.

738
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:35,370
Would've tried calling but
we didn't have your number.

739
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:37,329
I didn't even
notice it was missing.

740
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,113
It's a good thing I
haven't been pulled over.

741
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:39,941
Yeah.

742
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:40,899
Thanks.

743
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
Of course.

744
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:46,251
Well, at the rate we are going,

745
00:31:46,252 --> 00:31:49,036
I'm sure I'll see you again.

746
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:50,996
Hope, uh, probably.

747
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,128
See ya.

748
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:55,783
Bye.

749
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:01,615
Good news guys.

750
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:03,964
I have a job interview for.

751
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,662
What is all of this?

752
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:09,230
It's your casting wall.

753
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:12,800
These are the men who are
auditioning for your heart.

754
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:15,890
Is every wall covered?

755
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:17,979
Pretty much.

756
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,153
We've numbered all of them.

757
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:20,589
And we've put together details

758
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,374
for each and every one.

759
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:24,202
Basically a list
of their skills,

760
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:27,248
qualifications, educations,
likes, dislikes.

761
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:29,337
How did you find
all of this out?

762
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:31,296
You can find out anything
you want on the internet.

763
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:34,473
Now whether it's all true,
that's a different story.

764
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:37,694
Go ahead, try it
out, pick a number.

765
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:40,435
117.

766
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:43,743
Oh, he's a handsome one.

767
00:32:43,744 --> 00:32:46,485
This is John Jeffries.

768
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:49,705
He's a martial arts
instructor, has his own dojo.

769
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,925
No kids, never been married.

770
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:54,188
Favorite movie is,
"Best of the Best."

771
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:56,712
Dislikes pickles,
mustard and coconut.

772
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,324
He's 44 years old.

773
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:01,500
No, he's not gonna work out.

774
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:02,544
Was it the pickles?

775
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:03,545
No.

776
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:05,721
He's too old for me.

777
00:33:05,722 --> 00:33:10,030
I think, like 10 years
older than me is my limit.

778
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,292
Okay, good to know.

779
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:12,902
We can eliminating
a bunch by knowing

780
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,382
what your requirements are.

781
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:16,341
Have a seat.

782
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,778
We will put them all
in three categories,

783
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,258
Yes, no and maybe.

784
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:22,477
And we don't
eliminate the maybes.

785
00:33:22,478 --> 00:33:23,478
There have been plenty of times

786
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,740
that someone out of the maybes

787
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,133
has ended up wowing the director

788
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:27,048
and getting the part.

789
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:29,919
So John Jeffries is a no?

790
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,748
What would prevent you
from going out with someone?

791
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:34,054
I don't know.

792
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,796
Well, how important
are looks to you?

793
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:38,711
Not super important,

794
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:42,237
but I mean it's a plus
if he's attractive.

795
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:44,760
Is there anyone
here on the walls,

796
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:47,286
you'd eliminate just by looks?

797
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:53,595
I don't know, I mean,
I feel super weird

798
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:56,946
judging all these Johns
just based on their photos.

799
00:33:56,947 --> 00:34:00,820
Fine, we won't eliminate
any based on looks.

800
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:02,300
So 10 years older is the limit,

801
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,779
can he be younger than you?

802
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,651
No, no one younger than me.

803
00:34:05,652 --> 00:34:10,264
Really, not even like a
year or just a few months?

804
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:11,787
Okay,

805
00:34:11,788 --> 00:34:14,703
someone between 30 and 40.

806
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:17,010
Let's see what that does.

807
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:19,057
That only eliminates 24.

808
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:24,800
They never even got a chance.

809
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:28,108
There's still 163 on the list.

810
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,154
Oh, I thought of something.

811
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:33,113
I would like for
them to have a job,

812
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,334
be financially responsible

813
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:39,467
and to not live at home
with their parents.

814
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:42,602
How much taller
than you can he be?

815
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:45,953
Eight inches.

816
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,476
What?

817
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:50,913
I don't want to have to
stand on a stool to kiss him.

818
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:53,133
So what does that
do to the numbers?

819
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:56,093
Has to be employed,
not living with parents,

820
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,921
between 5.4 and six feet.

821
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:00,314
Anything else?

822
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:02,490
I think that's a
pretty good start.

823
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:03,665
Okay.

824
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:06,016
That eliminates another 73.

825
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:09,715
90.

826
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:12,109
That's a great number
to start scheduling.

827
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,414
Scheduling?

828
00:35:13,415 --> 00:35:14,459
Your dates.

829
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,460
90.

830
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:16,809
Don't worry.

831
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,072
We have a plan.

832
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:21,814
Am I supposed to be the
one contacting these people?

833
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:23,337
Just the Johns you know.

834
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:24,556
I'll worry about the ones I know

835
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:27,036
and Brooke will contact
the ones she knows.

836
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:29,909
It's either that or we
create a dating profile for you

837
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:33,042
stating that you are looking
for your soulmate named John.

838
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:35,350
Okay, your way is better.

839
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:38,875
You're doing good buddy,
just a little further.

840
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:42,226
There you are.

841
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:43,227
I got you.

842
00:35:47,754 --> 00:35:49,363
Here you go Miss.

843
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,236
Geez, thanks mister.

844
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:53,846
You see that,

845
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:57,371
fulfilling your knightly responsibilities.

846
00:35:57,372 --> 00:35:59,025
Oh speaking of, how did it go

847
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:01,288
with the future Mrs. Carpenter?

848
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:02,203
I blew it.

849
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:03,464
I didn't ask her out.

850
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:04,726
I didn't even ask
her for her number.

851
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:05,988
I'll probably never
see her again.

852
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:07,599
You're just out of
practice, that's all.

853
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,168
Maybe you'll get another shot.

854
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,735
Oh, look at those little feet.

855
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:16,303
They sure are wiggly in there.

856
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:20,177
It feels like they are
having a wrestling match.

857
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,745
Let's see if we can
find that heartbeat.

858
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:26,139
I read that a
higher fetal heartbeat

859
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,749
means you're having a girl.

860
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,924
How high?

861
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:30,622
Over 140.

862
00:36:30,623 --> 00:36:32,276
What's normal?

863
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:34,844
120 to 160 beats per minute.

864
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:42,764
It's so beautiful.

865
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:44,201
There's still only
two in there, right?

866
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,419
Yes.

867
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,378
Two healthy heart beats.

868
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:48,597
Both over 140.

869
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,251
Would you like to
know the genders?

870
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:52,861
Oh no, my husband and
I would like to find out

871
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:55,124
at the same time, but he
couldn't make it today

872
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,301
because he is home with
our sick little girl.

873
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:59,999
Oh well, we'll do
it next time then.

874
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,740
If you don't mind me asking,

875
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:04,960
how long did it take you to
become an Ultra Sound Tech?

876
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:08,181
Ah, see, with
school and everything,

877
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:09,443
about four years.

878
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:10,792
Seems worth it.

879
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:12,881
Oh, definitely.

880
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:15,101
Well, the doctor
will be in shortly.

881
00:37:15,102 --> 00:37:16,146
Thank you.

882
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:20,628
So are you still weighing
your career options?

883
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:22,151
I've made up my mind

884
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:24,284
that I wanna try something
completely different.

885
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,286
The other day when I went
in for my job interview,

886
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,157
it was very clear
that I'm no longer

887
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:29,376
interested in that field.

888
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:32,510
And I think the company
could see it too.

889
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:35,252
Are you leaning toward
anything particular?

890
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,253
Sadly, no.

891
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:43,956
Yes?

892
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:45,914
Hey, make it quick, the
doctor will be in any minute.

893
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:47,307
Okay I have everything booked.

894
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:50,310
I just sent you
over the calendar.

895
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:53,661
You have me going out
every night this week.

896
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:56,360
Guys, I'm starting to
second guess this decision.

897
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:58,318
Oh you are not backing out now.

898
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,667
You are committed.

899
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:01,669
I'm gonna get so fat
eating out that much.

900
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,367
Not every date is
taking you out to eat.

901
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:04,629
And we've put them in charge

902
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,891
of what you are
going to be doing.

903
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:08,197
And we did say no
to zero effort men.

904
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:10,112
We did not accept
coffee or a walk

905
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:12,811
as a suitable date option
and neither should you.

906
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:14,203
But I like walks.

907
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:15,857
You are not a dog.

908
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:18,425
And I have a Nespresso
machine at home.

909
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:21,515
You know, I think it's
all about compatibility.

910
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:23,082
When people our age,

911
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,258
get set and comfortable
in their routines,

912
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:28,870
we forget how to
be around others.

913
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:30,307
Did you read that somewhere?

914
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:34,006
In a magazine in
the waiting room.

915
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:37,226
Guys maybe we should just
let a John come into my life

916
00:38:37,227 --> 00:38:39,533
instead of forcing it to happen.

917
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:40,795
So far the only John

918
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:42,101
that has come into
your life naturally

919
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:43,342
is the kid on the Ferris Wheel.

920
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:45,234
Oh, gotta go, bye.

921
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:46,497
Hi, Doctor Murphy.

922
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:47,889
Hi.

923
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:48,890
John.

924
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:50,719
Alison Schafer?

925
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,067
Oh my gosh.

926
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:54,593
How are you?

927
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:57,508
We knew each other
in high school.

928
00:38:57,509 --> 00:39:00,032
In fact, I think that's
the last time I saw you.

929
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,164
We had like four or
five classes together.

930
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:03,601
Did you hear
Mr. Green retired?

931
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:04,863
History teacher, Green?

932
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:08,083
After 46 years,
can you believe that?

933
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:09,302
Oh Helen, I'm so sorry,

934
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:10,782
you and your babies
are the priority here.

935
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:12,044
How are you feeling?

936
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,262
Oh, no, you two should catch up.

937
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:14,612
Maybe over lunch or something.

938
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:15,570
I don't.

939
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:17,832
I think that's a good idea.

940
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,444
I'll add him to the list.

941
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,928
This would be a lot easier

942
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:28,147
if you just wait
until I was finished.

943
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:29,235
Brian's gonna be
here any minute.

944
00:39:29,236 --> 00:39:30,236
I know.

945
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:33,762
Oh got it, she's all yours.

946
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:38,200
What's wrong?

947
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:39,854
Aren't you excited?

948
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:42,074
I guess I am a
little apprehensive.

949
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:46,121
It's been a while since
I've been out on a date.

950
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:47,601
Don't be afraid of rejection.

951
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:50,256
Besides, you're gonna be
the one doing the rejecting.

952
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:51,736
That sounds worse.

953
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:54,086
I mean, it just
doesn't seem fair

954
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:56,262
to everyone else I'm
gonna be going out with.

955
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,437
Just have fun.

956
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:58,960
If there is something
there, pursue it.

957
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:01,093
If not, remember that the date's

958
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:02,573
gonna be over in a couple hours

959
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,618
and you don't have to see him
again, if you don't want to.

960
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,577
Plus, you're
charming and beautiful

961
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:11,320
and anyone, John or not, would
be lucky to go out with you.

962
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:12,321
Thanks.

963
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:16,978
I don't see it.

964
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:18,240
He's a maybe.

965
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:20,460
Remember what you
said about maybes.

966
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:22,114
Is he one of yours?

967
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:23,463
He's one of mine.

968
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:24,813
I knew him from college.

969
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:27,685
Oh.

970
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:29,818
I'll get it.

971
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,171
Hey Ali.

972
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:37,477
Hi John.

973
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,001
You ready to go?

974
00:40:40,046 --> 00:40:41,395
I'm all ready.

975
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:43,397
Great.

976
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:50,490
He better open the door for her.

977
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:54,668
Yeah, or else this
date is over real quick.

978
00:40:54,669 --> 00:40:55,756
Oh good, he did it.

979
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:57,106
Lucky for him.

980
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:12,077
Everything okay?

981
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:13,296
Yeah, great.

982
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,867
It's been a few
years since college,

983
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:21,826
how've you been?

984
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:23,132
Oh, so great.

985
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,874
And your family, they good?

986
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,574
Oh yeah, they're really great.

987
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:32,446
That's great.

988
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,851
Tell me everything.

989
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:47,939
Is he the one?

990
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,115
Definite no.

991
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:52,552
What did you guys do?

992
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:56,556
We drove in his truck
for a long, long time.

993
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:58,732
I had no idea where
we were going.

994
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:01,518
And then we stopped
at a gas station

995
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,694
where he bought me
an ice cream bar

996
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:05,260
and then took me back home.

997
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:07,828
Was the conversation
at least good?

998
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:09,351
Oh it was great.

999
00:42:09,352 --> 00:42:10,788
Or at least that
is how he responded

1000
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:14,009
to every single thing
that I asked him.

1001
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:17,665
Who's next?

1002
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:28,110
Hi Ali.

1003
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,290
Wow, this looks great.

1004
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:37,816
We'll it tastes even better.

1005
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:40,122
Will someone be joining us?

1006
00:42:41,428 --> 00:42:43,038
That must be my mother.

1007
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:47,302
I think I love all of 'em.

1008
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:49,478
The best one is
my Florida tattoo.

1009
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:52,133
Wanna see Florida dance?

1010
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:53,918
How tall are you?

1011
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:57,443
Just to like venture out
and like see other parts.

1012
00:42:57,444 --> 00:43:00,664
My favorite childhood
memories just to

1013
00:43:00,665 --> 00:43:01,665
do that.

1014
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:03,449
Whoa.

1015
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:06,191
What?

1016
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:08,367
Whoa.

1017
00:43:10,718 --> 00:43:12,589
It was a very shaky night
for the rookie quarterback

1018
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,199
seeing his first bit of action.

1019
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,899
He threw for 11-of-24
passes, 112 yards.

1020
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:24,513
If you're choosing
to start dating again

1021
00:43:24,514 --> 00:43:25,602
after a long while

1022
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,820
then you've gotta do it

1023
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:28,039
when you really feel
like you're ready.

1024
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,214
You're probably
gonna be bringing

1025
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:30,824
all of this emotional
package with you

1026
00:43:30,825 --> 00:43:32,871
which is just the worst.

1027
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:37,048
♪ That sparkle in your eye

1028
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:39,267
♪ Tells me I'm the only guy

1029
00:43:39,268 --> 00:43:41,356
♪ Who can take
your breath away ♪

1030
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:43,924
♪ And make you smile

1031
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:47,014
♪ Oh my Ali

1032
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:50,149
♪ I'm smitten by you

1033
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:56,241
I can't decide
if I wanna set her up

1034
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:58,112
with this one or this one.

1035
00:43:58,113 --> 00:44:01,028
I just don't
know if I love the mustache.

1036
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:03,422
Oh, how'd it go last night?

1037
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:05,554
I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

1038
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:07,687
That good, huh?

1039
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:12,387
At the end of the date he
hugs me then leans in and says,

1040
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:15,564
"I like my women
flabby, not firm,

1041
00:44:15,565 --> 00:44:17,566
"this isn't gonna work out."

1042
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:19,699
How did you respond?

1043
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,440
I said, thank you.

1044
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:24,922
And then hurried
into the apartment.

1045
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:27,794
He wasn't one of mine was he?

1046
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:32,494
Well, there are still
plenty of Johns on the list.

1047
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:34,627
Maybe we went about
it the wrong way.

1048
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:36,063
What do you mean?

1049
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:37,412
Or am I the issue?

1050
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:38,240
No.

1051
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:39,545
Am I undatable?

1052
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:41,590
You are not the issue.

1053
00:44:41,591 --> 00:44:42,853
Have hope.

1054
00:44:42,854 --> 00:44:46,160
Tomorrow you have a
date with my doctor.

1055
00:44:46,161 --> 00:44:47,988
Finally, someone normal.

1056
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,555
Or at least he was
in High School.

1057
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:51,209
What do you know
about this guy anyway?

1058
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,429
Besides the fact that he's
delivering your babies.

1059
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:55,996
He dresses really well.

1060
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:58,390
Has a nice car, a good job.

1061
00:44:58,391 --> 00:44:59,391
Single.

1062
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:03,570
I might actually be
looking forward to this one.

1063
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,096
So you've never been married?

1064
00:45:09,097 --> 00:45:09,924
Nope.

1065
00:45:09,924 --> 00:45:10,924
Never?

1066
00:45:12,013 --> 00:45:13,231
Why is that so hard
for you to believe?

1067
00:45:13,232 --> 00:45:15,668
I just always pictured
you happily married.

1068
00:45:15,669 --> 00:45:18,105
Oh you drew a picture
of me happily married?

1069
00:45:18,106 --> 00:45:20,935
No, but I could take a
shot at it, if you'd like.

1070
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:24,634
Thank you.

1071
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:26,114
You're welcome.

1072
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,639
Do you know those yearbook
predictions from high school,

1073
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,293
like, "Whose most likely
to end up in prison."

1074
00:45:32,294 --> 00:45:33,817
You know, that sort of thing.

1075
00:45:33,818 --> 00:45:35,427
Yeah, did yours say, "Most
likely to become a doctor?"

1076
00:45:35,428 --> 00:45:38,518
Yes, actually,
and happily married.

1077
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:40,954
You're not married, right?

1078
00:45:40,955 --> 00:45:43,696
No, no, no, divorced
for a few years.

1079
00:45:43,697 --> 00:45:45,176
No kids.

1080
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:47,875
Maybe the happily married
part is still yet to come.

1081
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:51,749
So what was you predictions?

1082
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:56,231
I don't remember.

1083
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,844
So who left who?

1084
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:01,846
She left me.

1085
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:04,325
I'm sorry.

1086
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:06,675
No, we wanted different things.

1087
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:11,725
I wanted a family and she wanted
Raul, her personal trainer.

1088
00:46:13,205 --> 00:46:15,684
You know, she would always
tell me how exhausting it was

1089
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:17,512
for her to have to
tell me all the things

1090
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:18,427
that I needed to do.

1091
00:46:18,428 --> 00:46:19,688
And I'd reason, you know,

1092
00:46:19,689 --> 00:46:20,689
"Just tell me what
you want me to do

1093
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:23,388
"and I'll gladly do it."

1094
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:26,087
She didn't want to be my mother.

1095
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:30,875
You okay?

1096
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:33,877
John?

1097
00:46:34,922 --> 00:46:35,922
John?

1098
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:39,360
He's choking.

1099
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:40,709
Help, somebody help.

1100
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,234
Come here, I've got
you, I've got you.

1101
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:48,195
There you go, breathe, breathe.

1102
00:46:48,196 --> 00:46:49,154
Are you okay?

1103
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:50,111
Yeah, thank you.

1104
00:46:50,112 --> 00:46:51,503
Have a seat.

1105
00:46:51,504 --> 00:46:54,375
Let's make sure
you're all right.

1106
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:55,769
Grab some water.

1107
00:47:01,296 --> 00:47:02,080
Hi.

1108
00:47:02,081 --> 00:47:04,211
The date was that bad?

1109
00:47:04,212 --> 00:47:08,259
The date was actually
going really well,

1110
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:12,785
that is until John started
choking and I panicked.

1111
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:14,918
- Is he okay?
- What happened?

1112
00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:17,877
I wanted to do
something, but I just froze

1113
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:19,574
and did nothing.

1114
00:47:19,575 --> 00:47:22,273
Luckily, the fireman from
the carnival was there

1115
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:23,535
and helped him.

1116
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:24,406
Was it the handsome one

1117
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:26,712
or bad pick up lines.

1118
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:28,323
His name is Sean.

1119
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:32,023
I don't even think
I thanked him.

1120
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,243
I don't know what my problem is.

1121
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:40,595
I was sitting there staring
at her the entire time.

1122
00:47:40,596 --> 00:47:42,989
While she was on a
date with another guy.

1123
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:45,513
I'm just setting
my up for failure.

1124
00:47:45,514 --> 00:47:46,645
What are you doing?

1125
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:47,646
Hi.

1126
00:47:49,954 --> 00:47:50,954
Ali.

1127
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:55,046
Hey, I gotta go, yeah.

1128
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:04,097
Can I?

1129
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:07,144
I wanted to say thank you

1130
00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:10,451
for saving the guy
that I was with.

1131
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:12,932
How's your date,
is he doing okay?

1132
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:15,021
As far as I know.

1133
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:16,022
Good.

1134
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,374
It looked like your
date was going well.

1135
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:21,375
It was,

1136
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:23,551
actually,

1137
00:48:23,552 --> 00:48:25,337
well until, you know.

1138
00:48:26,512 --> 00:48:27,991
Why did you keep staring at me

1139
00:48:27,992 --> 00:48:30,297
while you were on a
date with another woman?

1140
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:32,256
I hope it wasn't a date.

1141
00:48:32,257 --> 00:48:33,300
What?

1142
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:35,302
My aunt, Sherry.

1143
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:38,785
The woman I was with
was my aunt, Sherry.

1144
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:40,655
Oh.

1145
00:48:43,137 --> 00:48:45,791
Sorry for jumping
to conclusions.

1146
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:46,792
Yeah.

1147
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:51,884
But still, you did
keep looking at me.

1148
00:48:51,885 --> 00:48:52,885
I did.

1149
00:48:55,889 --> 00:48:59,326
How did you not panic
when my date was choking?

1150
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:01,459
Like, you came over and assessed
the situation and acted.

1151
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,027
You saved his life.

1152
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:06,029
You know, I still
feel a little nervous

1153
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,031
every time there is a
situation like that,

1154
00:49:08,032 --> 00:49:11,774
but I just let the
training take over.

1155
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:17,040
What would it take to
become a first responder?

1156
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:21,348
Any particular field,
Paramedic, EMT, firefighter?

1157
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:24,264
I started taking an EMT
course my freshman year,

1158
00:49:24,265 --> 00:49:26,223
but I never finished.

1159
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:29,008
I'm sure that would
be easy to pick back up.

1160
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:30,792
What happened
earlier at the cafe,

1161
00:49:30,793 --> 00:49:32,533
I do not want a repeat of that.

1162
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:36,059
I want to be ready
and willing to act.

1163
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,539
Everyone responds different
in a situation like that.

1164
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,499
But you responded
how I want to respond.

1165
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,719
Finish your EMT course
and I'm sure you would.

1166
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,548
What are the typical
hours like for an EMT?

1167
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:49,724
Mostly 12 hour shifts.

1168
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:51,639
But it's not uncommon
to have to stay late

1169
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,555
because of a call that comes
in at the end of your shift.

1170
00:49:54,556 --> 00:49:56,775
And how long did
you get certified?

1171
00:49:56,776 --> 00:49:58,559
Six months at a
community college.

1172
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,648
I was taking other
courses at the same time.

1173
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:02,955
Being EMT certified
really helped

1174
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:04,826
when I decided to
become a fireman.

1175
00:50:04,827 --> 00:50:07,178
What made you decide that?

1176
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:09,048
My mom.

1177
00:50:10,398 --> 00:50:13,313
She embroidered a quote and
hung it on our wall at home.

1178
00:50:13,314 --> 00:50:16,360
It was from Ralph Waldo Emerson.

1179
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:19,928
And it said, "The purpose
of life is not to be happy.

1180
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:23,541
"It is to be useful, to be
honorable, to be compassionate,

1181
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:26,065
"to have it make some
difference that you have lived

1182
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:28,024
"and lived well."

1183
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,591
Your mom embroidered all that?

1184
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:31,418
Yeah.

1185
00:50:32,986 --> 00:50:36,641
And you feel like you're
making a difference?

1186
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:38,122
Some days, yeah.

1187
00:50:39,297 --> 00:50:41,341
All in all, I recommend
it as a profession

1188
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:44,214
if you're looking to give
back to your community.

1189
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:47,173
On the other hand, if
you're looking to be a hero

1190
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:50,437
or make a lot of money,
it's not the field for you.

1191
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:52,352
Thanks for answering
all of my questions,

1192
00:50:52,353 --> 00:50:54,006
I know it was a lot.

1193
00:50:54,007 --> 00:50:55,617
Yeah, no problem.

1194
00:50:57,837 --> 00:50:59,968
Let me give you my number.

1195
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:01,448
If you have any more
questions, I could.

1196
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:02,449
Oh yeah.

1197
00:51:03,234 --> 00:51:05,278
Okay yeah, that would be great.

1198
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:07,064
That's nice actually.

1199
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,763
Okay, I've finally decided,

1200
00:51:11,764 --> 00:51:14,113
I want to be a first responder.

1201
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:15,636
Like a firefighter?

1202
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:17,682
I wanna be an EMT
and then work my way up

1203
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:19,466
to being a paramedic.

1204
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:20,728
Is there a difference?

1205
00:51:20,729 --> 00:51:23,383
Well EMTs, they
mostly deal with CPR,

1206
00:51:23,384 --> 00:51:26,125
tourniquet application
and wound treatment.

1207
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:29,476
Paramedics perform more
advanced procedures.

1208
00:51:29,477 --> 00:51:31,478
I think you are
suffering the effects

1209
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:34,568
from your mid-midlife crisis.

1210
00:51:34,569 --> 00:51:36,092
I'm serious.

1211
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,658
After talking to Sean,

1212
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:39,486
I am sure that this
is what I wanna do.

1213
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:41,749
But isn't that like
starting over with school?

1214
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,664
Are you still going to have time

1215
00:51:43,665 --> 00:51:47,190
while we're trying to find
your one and only John?

1216
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:50,018
You guys are not
being too supportive.

1217
00:51:50,019 --> 00:51:52,064
Did Sean talk you into this?

1218
00:51:52,065 --> 00:51:53,935
Not at all.

1219
00:51:53,936 --> 00:51:56,764
I just asked him a
bunch of questions.

1220
00:51:56,765 --> 00:51:59,550
And we actually had a
lot of fun together,

1221
00:51:59,551 --> 00:52:02,553
we spent the entire
afternoon talking.

1222
00:52:02,554 --> 00:52:04,120
That's swell and all,

1223
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,034
but you are supposed to be
finding love with a John.

1224
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:07,471
Mom.

1225
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:10,343
Alright everyone, let's find
out what these babies are.

1226
00:52:10,344 --> 00:52:12,171
Don't forget you have
six dates this week.

1227
00:52:12,172 --> 00:52:13,172
Six?

1228
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:14,131
Check your calendar.

1229
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:15,261
I did give you tomorrow off.

1230
00:52:15,262 --> 00:52:16,741
Oh I should probably tell you

1231
00:52:16,742 --> 00:52:18,308
that I set you up on a
second date with my doctor

1232
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:19,613
and it's tomorrow.

1233
00:52:19,614 --> 00:52:22,007
Okay, on the count of three.

1234
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:24,053
One, two, three.

1235
00:52:29,058 --> 00:52:30,494
Oh my goodness.

1236
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:32,236
Double rouge.

1237
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,024
Nice swing.

1238
00:52:39,025 --> 00:52:40,199
Thanks.

1239
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,722
You sure you haven't
done this before?

1240
00:52:41,723 --> 00:52:42,811
First time.

1241
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:55,606
Wow, that is
incredibly accurate.

1242
00:52:55,607 --> 00:52:56,911
Don't look so surprised.

1243
00:52:56,912 --> 00:52:59,566
Are you sure you're
not signed with the PGA?

1244
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:01,133
This was a good idea.

1245
00:53:01,134 --> 00:53:03,571
Yeah, I'm glad we did this.

1246
00:53:05,007 --> 00:53:07,531
So I've been thinking
of making a career change.

1247
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:09,576
Something still
with computers, right?

1248
00:53:09,577 --> 00:53:11,099
EMT, actually.

1249
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,710
That's is quote the change.

1250
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:13,928
I know.

1251
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:16,409
Are you sure you
want to do that?

1252
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:17,671
You don't think I should?

1253
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:18,933
No, no, no, it's
not what I meant.

1254
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:19,934
It's just.

1255
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:25,026
It's the hospital, I got
a delivery, I gotta go.

1256
00:53:25,027 --> 00:53:26,245
It's not Helen, is it?

1257
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:28,160
No, no, no, she's
still a ways out.

1258
00:53:28,161 --> 00:53:29,683
We should do this
again sometime.

1259
00:53:29,684 --> 00:53:30,989
Sure.

1260
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:31,990
Sorry.

1261
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:39,216
Hey, hold up.

1262
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,696
Who is it?

1263
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:43,611
Hi.

1264
00:53:43,612 --> 00:53:44,698
Hey.

1265
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:47,092
It's her isn't it?

1266
00:53:47,093 --> 00:53:48,746
I wanted to say thanks again

1267
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:51,923
for answering all my
questions the other day.

1268
00:53:51,924 --> 00:53:55,579
I decided that I
want to be an EMT.

1269
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,102
That's awesome.

1270
00:53:57,103 --> 00:54:00,627
And then maybe work my
way up to being a paramedic.

1271
00:54:00,628 --> 00:54:02,629
I could totally
see you doing that.

1272
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:03,978
Thank you.

1273
00:54:03,979 --> 00:54:05,328
You're the first person

1274
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:07,286
who's shown any
excitement about this.

1275
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:08,940
What's not to be excited about?

1276
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:09,941
It's such a great choice,

1277
00:54:09,942 --> 00:54:12,378
I know you are gonna love it.

1278
00:54:12,379 --> 00:54:13,814
I was wondering if you would

1279
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:17,035
point me in the right direction.

1280
00:54:17,036 --> 00:54:19,342
I could do better than that.

1281
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,257
I could help you along the way

1282
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,781
and make sure you
take the best courses

1283
00:54:23,782 --> 00:54:24,912
with the best teachers.

1284
00:54:24,913 --> 00:54:26,174
Show you what to prepare for,

1285
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:28,829
help you with the exams.

1286
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,309
You would do that?

1287
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:33,312
Yeah, I wanna see you succeed.

1288
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:34,314
Thank you.

1289
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:37,403
I'll put some things
together for you

1290
00:54:37,404 --> 00:54:41,146
and maybe we can meet
up tomorrow morning.

1291
00:54:41,147 --> 00:54:44,411
Let me check my
calendar, one sec.

1292
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,633
I can't tomorrow morning.

1293
00:54:49,634 --> 00:54:50,982
When can you?

1294
00:54:50,983 --> 00:54:53,593
Or Thursday morning.

1295
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:55,378
You're a busy lady.

1296
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:57,336
How's Friday morning?

1297
00:54:57,337 --> 00:54:58,511
I'll make it work.

1298
00:54:58,512 --> 00:55:00,470
Come by the fire
station around nine.

1299
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:01,341
Great.

1300
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:02,341
Thank you.

1301
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:05,823
Perfect, I'll see you then.

1302
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:06,955
Bye.

1303
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:13,874
That's right, that's right.

1304
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:14,875
Man.

1305
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:19,880
What are we going
to do about Ali?

1306
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:21,317
I'm worried about her.

1307
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,840
I think out of everyone
she's seen so far,

1308
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:24,930
I think Doctor John is the best.

1309
00:55:28,063 --> 00:55:29,542
What is it?

1310
00:55:29,543 --> 00:55:31,631
It's too quiet.

1311
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:32,632
Brian.

1312
00:55:35,157 --> 00:55:36,157
Brian.

1313
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:38,029
Try calling him.

1314
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,205
Yeah.

1315
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,386
Voicemail again.

1316
00:55:47,387 --> 00:55:50,041
Maybe he finally snapped.

1317
00:55:50,042 --> 00:55:52,913
He realized that being married
to you is too much work

1318
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:55,829
and he is on his way to Belize.

1319
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,353
This is so unlike him.

1320
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,398
Isn't this what
you wanted though?

1321
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:01,748
Irresponsible,
lazy, less perfect.

1322
00:56:01,749 --> 00:56:04,577
Yeah, but kids were supposed
to be to bed hours ago.

1323
00:56:04,578 --> 00:56:06,536
Oh, he's gonna be
in so much trouble.

1324
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:08,276
I'm sure they're fine.

1325
00:56:08,277 --> 00:56:10,104
Have you noticed Ali is
starting to act irrationally.

1326
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:11,410
Wait, wait, wait.

1327
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:12,455
Do you hear that?

1328
00:56:12,456 --> 00:56:13,673
What?

1329
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:15,110
That.

1330
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:24,642
Too perfect, huh?

1331
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:36,479
Oh you've gotta be kidding me.

1332
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,654
What?

1333
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:39,743
He sent me some texts
I didn't even see.

1334
00:56:39,744 --> 00:56:42,136
Letting me know the
kids were scared,

1335
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:43,573
and he was gonna stay with them,

1336
00:56:43,574 --> 00:56:48,142
but would get to the dishes
after they fell asleep.

1337
00:56:48,143 --> 00:56:49,493
I am a bad wife.

1338
00:56:50,363 --> 00:56:52,190
You're not a bad wife.

1339
00:56:52,191 --> 00:56:53,670
You're just starting to realize

1340
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:55,541
what an amazing man you have.

1341
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:57,500
He is pretty amazing, huh?

1342
00:56:57,501 --> 00:56:59,937
And he even left some
dishes for you to do.

1343
00:56:59,938 --> 00:57:01,547
But look what he did to me.

1344
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:04,986
Oh I think you had a little
bit to do with that yourself.

1345
00:57:07,249 --> 00:57:08,989
So what are we
gonna do about Ali?

1346
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,208
I wouldn't stress about it.

1347
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:11,644
She's made up her
mind about work

1348
00:57:11,645 --> 00:57:14,255
and the best thing we
can do is support her.

1349
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:16,997
Yeah, just as long
as she doesn't forget

1350
00:57:16,998 --> 00:57:20,001
about finding her
soulmate, John.

1351
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:23,177
I made a list of
some things you'll need to do

1352
00:57:23,178 --> 00:57:25,005
and some resources to
help you get signed up.

1353
00:57:25,006 --> 00:57:27,225
This is amazing, thank you.

1354
00:57:27,226 --> 00:57:29,488
You don't need a college
degree to be an EMT,

1355
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:30,837
but you do need a
high school diploma.

1356
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:32,360
Check.

1357
00:57:32,361 --> 00:57:33,840
You'll need to be CPR certified

1358
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:35,189
before you enroll in the course.

1359
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,582
Okay, I had one of those

1360
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:38,366
but I think it's expired now.

1361
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:40,499
Yeah most certifications
only last for a year or two,

1362
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,196
so you'll have to redo that.

1363
00:57:42,197 --> 00:57:43,981
But luckily, we offer a course,

1364
00:57:43,982 --> 00:57:45,504
it only takes a couple hours.

1365
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:47,028
Sign me up for the next one.

1366
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:51,118
Then you'll have
to take the cognitive exam.

1367
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,293
Is that the
kind of that the test

1368
00:57:52,294 --> 00:57:53,381
that you can take online?

1369
00:57:53,382 --> 00:57:54,644
Yep.

1370
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:56,863
You'll answer between
60 and 110 questions.

1371
00:57:56,864 --> 00:57:58,474
What kinds of questions?

1372
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,867
It covers everything
from airways, ventilation,

1373
00:58:00,868 --> 00:58:03,522
respiration, cardiology, resuscitation.

1374
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:05,002
It takes about two hours.

1375
00:58:05,003 --> 00:58:06,394
The biggest thing
you'll need to do

1376
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:08,571
is complete a state-approved
education program.

1377
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:10,703
Is that like the one
I started in college?

1378
00:58:10,704 --> 00:58:12,096
Yep.

1379
00:58:12,097 --> 00:58:14,925
However, there is an
accelerated EMT training course.

1380
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:16,230
It takes only 19 days,

1381
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:19,016
as opposed to six months
at a community college.

1382
00:58:19,017 --> 00:58:20,539
Okay.

1383
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:24,412
I definitely want to do
the accelerated course.

1384
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:28,416
It's just my schedule
is a little crazy

1385
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:30,244
over the next little while.

1386
00:58:30,245 --> 00:58:31,419
Oh.

1387
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,420
I know it sounds bad,

1388
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:34,771
it's just I have a date

1389
00:58:34,772 --> 00:58:38,427
like every day for the
next several weeks.

1390
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:42,823
Every day?

1391
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:48,262
With the same guy
or different guys?

1392
00:58:48,263 --> 00:58:49,308
Different.

1393
00:58:50,178 --> 00:58:51,615
Oh, dare I ask?

1394
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:56,402
I know, it sounds so
bad saying it out loud.

1395
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:00,231
It's complicated.

1396
00:59:00,232 --> 00:59:02,015
But I am serious
about being an EMT.

1397
00:59:02,016 --> 00:59:04,757
So I'm going to start
as soon as I can.

1398
00:59:04,758 --> 00:59:06,978
Amid your serial dating?

1399
00:59:08,762 --> 00:59:10,068
You don't know the half of it.

1400
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:13,070
While we wait for the
last few people to arrive,

1401
00:59:13,071 --> 00:59:15,289
make sure you have your
packet so we can review.

1402
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:19,772
And we're going to go over
the, "Dr's ABCs" shortly.

1403
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:21,034
Thanks for coming with me.

1404
00:59:21,035 --> 00:59:22,296
Yeah, no problem.

1405
00:59:22,297 --> 00:59:24,429
One of my worst fears is
one of my kids choking

1406
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,954
and me not knowing what to do.

1407
00:59:28,826 --> 00:59:33,394
So, how did the date
with the latest John go?

1408
00:59:33,395 --> 00:59:35,179
While we were watching the movie

1409
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,791
I reached for the popcorn
and he pulled the tub away

1410
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:41,315
and asked if my
hands were clean.

1411
00:59:41,316 --> 00:59:42,578
Oh I'm so sorry.

1412
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,796
It gets better.

1413
00:59:43,797 --> 00:59:45,711
He said he had to
go to the bathroom

1414
00:59:45,712 --> 00:59:48,584
and he took the tub
of popcorn with him.

1415
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,498
What?

1416
00:59:49,499 --> 00:59:51,500
And then he never came back.

1417
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:58,463
At least I was finally
able to enjoy the movie.

1418
00:59:58,464 --> 01:00:01,945
Hey, Helen, will you cancel
all my upcoming dates?

1419
01:00:01,946 --> 01:00:04,164
Even my doctor?

1420
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:06,471
No, he actually
has some potential,

1421
01:00:06,472 --> 01:00:09,996
but all the others,
I just can't handle.

1422
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:13,392
I really wanna focus
on my EMT training.

1423
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:18,657
Okay, as long as you take
time to focus on Doctor John.

1424
01:00:18,658 --> 01:00:20,093
Thank you.

1425
01:00:20,094 --> 01:00:22,400
Now I have to convince Brooke.

1426
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:25,011
All right, everyone,
the "Dr's ABCs"

1427
01:00:25,012 --> 01:00:27,144
is a handy acronym
to help you remember

1428
01:00:27,145 --> 01:00:29,842
what to do when you find
someone unconscious.

1429
01:00:29,843 --> 01:00:31,365
You can't give up.

1430
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:33,629
I'm not giving up.

1431
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,806
I just can't go on
any more blind dates.

1432
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:40,548
But some potential
good ones are coming up.

1433
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:43,769
How many dates have I been on?

1434
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:44,901
A lot.

1435
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:45,902
Over 50.

1436
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:47,991
50 dates.

1437
01:00:47,992 --> 01:00:50,820
And I've only been on
one second date, one.

1438
01:00:50,821 --> 01:00:52,952
What does that tell you?

1439
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:54,954
That I've failed.

1440
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:55,782
No.

1441
01:00:55,783 --> 01:00:56,956
Yes.

1442
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:57,957
No.

1443
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:02,701
Look, I appreciate
everything that you and Helen

1444
01:01:02,702 --> 01:01:04,007
have set up for me,

1445
01:01:04,008 --> 01:01:07,664
I just, I think it was
too much, all at once.

1446
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:13,452
I may have gone
a little overboard.

1447
01:01:14,932 --> 01:01:15,932
A little.

1448
01:01:26,378 --> 01:01:27,726
Are you sure?

1449
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:28,902
I'm sure.

1450
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:36,735
But you still think there
is potential with Doctor John?

1451
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:37,736
I do.

1452
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:39,129
He's really nice.

1453
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,306
But we have yet
to finish a date.

1454
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:50,488
Nice hit, nice hit, nice hit.

1455
01:01:50,489 --> 01:01:51,882
There you go.

1456
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:54,449
Nice.

1457
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:04,329
That's game.

1458
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:06,939
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have played that hard.

1459
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,636
I'm glad you didn't hold back.

1460
01:02:08,637 --> 01:02:10,769
This is your first time playing?

1461
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:11,728
It showed that much?

1462
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:12,989
No, you're great.

1463
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:15,687
I mean, you play like a pro.

1464
01:02:15,688 --> 01:02:17,558
So, how's the EMT thing going?

1465
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:19,038
I have test coming up.

1466
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:22,259
If I pass, I can start
the accelerated course.

1467
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,303
I'm a little nervous.

1468
01:02:23,304 --> 01:02:25,131
No, I'm sure you'll do great.

1469
01:02:25,132 --> 01:02:26,872
Maybe you can help me study?

1470
01:02:26,873 --> 01:02:28,134
How?

1471
01:02:28,135 --> 01:02:30,223
I don't know, like
quiz me on things

1472
01:02:30,224 --> 01:02:31,790
like, "How many liters of oxygen

1473
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,793
"is a D size cylinder
capable of carrying?"

1474
01:02:38,189 --> 01:02:40,365
Look, it's the hospital.

1475
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:43,236
I'm sorry, our gotta get going.

1476
01:02:43,237 --> 01:02:44,760
I'm still trying to figure out

1477
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,196
this whole balance between
work like and personal life.

1478
01:02:46,197 --> 01:02:48,198
You mean like not dating
your patients friends?

1479
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:49,329
Yeah.

1480
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:51,463
Yeah, something like that.

1481
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:55,640
Which symptoms are
most commonly associated

1482
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:57,207
with cardiac related chest pain?

1483
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:59,905
It's not lower back pain,

1484
01:02:59,906 --> 01:03:01,341
jaw pain.

1485
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:02,822
That's correct.

1486
01:03:03,692 --> 01:03:05,389
All right, next one.

1487
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:06,825
What patient would
be the most likely

1488
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:09,219
to require insulin injections?

1489
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,699
A 92-year-old male
with Type 2 diabetes.

1490
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,658
A 25-year-old male
with Type 1 diabetes.

1491
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:15,921
25-year-old male
with Type 1 Diabetes.

1492
01:03:15,922 --> 01:03:17,444
You don't wanna hear
the other options?

1493
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:19,359
Well if he's a 25-year-old
male with Type 1 Diabetes,

1494
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,710
he most likely isn't capable
of producing his own insulin.

1495
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:24,451
You got 'em all.

1496
01:03:24,452 --> 01:03:25,539
You're definitely ready.

1497
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,845
I feel ready.

1498
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:28,281
You nervous?

1499
01:03:28,282 --> 01:03:30,545
Not with you in my corner.

1500
01:03:31,503 --> 01:03:33,199
Thanks for helping me study.

1501
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,245
Of course.

1502
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:42,861
What's the rule about having
boys over when I am not here?

1503
01:03:42,862 --> 01:03:44,428
She's kidding.

1504
01:03:44,429 --> 01:03:45,864
I was just leaving.

1505
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:47,345
I bet you were.

1506
01:03:49,216 --> 01:03:50,869
You'll do awesome tomorrow.

1507
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:51,870
Thanks.

1508
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:54,265
Nice to see you again.

1509
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:03,447
What do you think you are doing?

1510
01:04:03,448 --> 01:04:05,057
Studying for my test tomorrow.

1511
01:04:05,058 --> 01:04:07,712
With your hair all done
up nice and smelling all,

1512
01:04:07,713 --> 01:04:09,279
smelling, you're
wearing my perfume.

1513
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,889
You said I could borrow some.

1514
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:14,110
Yeah, when you're out with
Doctor John, not with that guy.

1515
01:04:14,111 --> 01:04:15,459
Don't worry.

1516
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:18,462
I'm seeing Doctor John
tomorrow after my test.

1517
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:19,898
Good.

1518
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:23,685
I just wanted to make sure
your priorities are straight.

1519
01:04:27,124 --> 01:04:29,255
On call again?

1520
01:04:29,256 --> 01:04:30,474
Yeah.

1521
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:31,779
I mean, that's why
I chose this place,

1522
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,782
just in case I'm called in.

1523
01:04:34,783 --> 01:04:36,045
Does that ever get to you?

1524
01:04:36,046 --> 01:04:38,482
Just always feeling
like you're at work?

1525
01:04:38,483 --> 01:04:40,832
It's crossed my mind.

1526
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:42,921
But I love what I do.

1527
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:44,141
It feels like,

1528
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:49,929
taking care of women
is my life's calling.

1529
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:53,149
You know, that sounded
a lot more strange

1530
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,370
coming out than just
staying up there.

1531
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,982
Wasn't your dad a surgeon?

1532
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:01,331
Yeah, he still is.

1533
01:05:01,332 --> 01:05:02,767
I mean, that's why I got
into the medical field,

1534
01:05:02,768 --> 01:05:04,464
in the first place.

1535
01:05:04,465 --> 01:05:06,031
I love surgery.

1536
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:08,468
I mean you can actually
cure a patient's disease

1537
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:11,254
with the right operation.

1538
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:14,126
Then I delivered my first baby

1539
01:05:14,127 --> 01:05:16,302
and it all made sense.

1540
01:05:16,303 --> 01:05:19,088
You know, in my line of
work, there's two patients,

1541
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:20,959
the mother and the child.

1542
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,701
And there is nothing

1543
01:05:23,876 --> 01:05:26,269
like bringing new
life in the world.

1544
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:28,358
I got to be at my niece's birth.

1545
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:32,406
And seeing those little
hands and her eyes open,

1546
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:35,669
for the first time,

1547
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:36,933
it was amazing.

1548
01:05:41,198 --> 01:05:43,504
I can see why you do it.

1549
01:05:45,332 --> 01:05:46,332
What?

1550
01:05:47,421 --> 01:05:48,639
It's kinda like we
just picked back up

1551
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,989
from when we were
in high school.

1552
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:08,965
You're never gonna believe.

1553
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:11,141
The hospital?

1554
01:06:12,403 --> 01:06:15,883
I'm sorry I have to
cut our time short.

1555
01:06:15,884 --> 01:06:18,756
It's okay, I understand.

1556
01:06:18,757 --> 01:06:20,323
I'm off next week, okay,

1557
01:06:20,324 --> 01:06:23,021
I'll pick you up, take
you on a formal date.

1558
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:24,240
Okay.

1559
01:06:24,241 --> 01:06:25,893
Thank you for understanding me.

1560
01:06:25,894 --> 01:06:28,114
Yeah, of course.

1561
01:06:44,043 --> 01:06:45,391
Sean.

1562
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:46,523
Ali.

1563
01:06:46,524 --> 01:06:48,569
Is everything all right?

1564
01:06:49,614 --> 01:06:51,485
Where did you run from?

1565
01:06:53,748 --> 01:06:54,922
You passed.

1566
01:06:54,923 --> 01:06:55,750
Yeah.

1567
01:06:55,751 --> 01:06:57,751
100%, that's amazing.

1568
01:06:57,752 --> 01:06:58,752
Thanks to you.

1569
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:00,929
Hey, I just led you
in the right direction.

1570
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:02,104
That's all you.

1571
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:04,019
I couldn't have
done it without you.

1572
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,281
Let's celebrate.

1573
01:07:05,282 --> 01:07:08,110
We can celebrate by
letting me take you out.

1574
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,546
I'm all sweaty.

1575
01:07:09,547 --> 01:07:11,765
How about this Saturday?

1576
01:07:11,766 --> 01:07:13,202
That is, if it doesn't interfere

1577
01:07:13,203 --> 01:07:15,639
with your other
dating adventures.

1578
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:19,295
That's pretty much done
with now, thank goodness.

1579
01:07:19,296 --> 01:07:20,296
Really?

1580
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:23,604
Saturday would be nice.

1581
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:37,748
I'm glad you came.

1582
01:07:37,749 --> 01:07:39,880
It's nice to spend
some time together.

1583
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:41,491
Studying doesn't count?

1584
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:43,058
You know what I mean.

1585
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,973
This is one of the few times
you haven't seen me in uniform.

1586
01:07:45,974 --> 01:07:48,106
It does look good on you.

1587
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:49,760
Thanks.

1588
01:07:49,761 --> 01:07:53,111
I bet your mom is really
proud of you being a fireman.

1589
01:07:53,112 --> 01:07:54,765
My mom?

1590
01:07:54,766 --> 01:07:57,202
Her quote that
inspired you, right?

1591
01:07:57,203 --> 01:07:58,203
Oh.

1592
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:00,685
Yeah, she would be.

1593
01:08:02,165 --> 01:08:04,862
I lost both my parents
when I was in college.

1594
01:08:04,863 --> 01:08:05,907
I'm sorry.

1595
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,128
It's okay, it was
a long time ago.

1596
01:08:18,311 --> 01:08:20,834
Now the only family I
have close by is my aunt.

1597
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:22,315
The one you thought
I was dating.

1598
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:26,797
But she is always
off traveling, so.

1599
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:28,146
I imagine it gets lonely,

1600
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:30,540
not having any family around.

1601
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:31,542
Definitely.

1602
01:08:33,805 --> 01:08:36,763
What were your parents like?

1603
01:08:36,764 --> 01:08:38,809
Everything a kid could ask for.

1604
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:40,854
I had a really ideal
childhood growing up.

1605
01:08:40,855 --> 01:08:42,639
I was a very happy kid.

1606
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,860
My family, ate dinner together
every night, prayed together.

1607
01:08:46,861 --> 01:08:49,515
My parents even came to
all of my baseball games.

1608
01:08:49,516 --> 01:08:52,344
Now my family is my work.

1609
01:08:52,345 --> 01:08:55,521
What about a family of your own?

1610
01:08:55,522 --> 01:08:57,871
You know I almost
got married once.

1611
01:08:57,872 --> 01:08:59,873
After a year together, she said,

1612
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:02,441
"If it's too good to be
true, it probably is."

1613
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:03,922
And she ended it.

1614
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:06,924
I'm sorry.

1615
01:09:06,925 --> 01:09:08,143
It's okay.

1616
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,189
Better to break up
before we got married.

1617
01:09:11,059 --> 01:09:13,105
And no one since then?

1618
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:16,935
No, just me and my work.

1619
01:09:18,197 --> 01:09:19,416
What about you?

1620
01:09:20,765 --> 01:09:22,331
Same, I guess.

1621
01:09:22,332 --> 01:09:25,464
I kinda just threw
myself into work

1622
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:26,684
and my routine

1623
01:09:28,207 --> 01:09:30,339
and just never made
time for friends

1624
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,429
or anything else, really.

1625
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:36,519
I guess I just got comfortable.

1626
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,565
Yeah, I get that.

1627
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,969
What did I just walk into?

1628
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,711
An intervention.

1629
01:09:56,104 --> 01:09:59,933
You and Sean have been
spending lots of time together.

1630
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,196
Yeah.

1631
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,589
Because he's been
helping me study.

1632
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:06,244
I don't think there
was any studying today,

1633
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:09,640
unless it was about the
nerves in each others lips?

1634
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:12,511
We haven't kissed.

1635
01:10:12,512 --> 01:10:14,122
- Good.
- Why not?

1636
01:10:16,864 --> 01:10:19,301
Listen, I really enjoy
spending time with Sean.

1637
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:21,128
We know why he is helping you.

1638
01:10:21,129 --> 01:10:23,392
It's because he likes you.

1639
01:10:23,393 --> 01:10:24,958
I like him too.

1640
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:26,482
What about John?

1641
01:10:26,483 --> 01:10:28,876
I like both John and Sean.

1642
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:33,967
Helen and I agree that
this John could be the one.

1643
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:38,015
It's just, we're not enough
of a priority to one another.

1644
01:10:38,016 --> 01:10:39,886
But John's great.

1645
01:10:39,887 --> 01:10:44,282
Yeah, when I actually
have a chance to see him.

1646
01:10:44,283 --> 01:10:46,197
Sean is really nice though.

1647
01:10:46,198 --> 01:10:47,982
Helen, not helping.

1648
01:10:49,593 --> 01:10:52,248
Do you have feelings for Sean?

1649
01:10:53,858 --> 01:10:55,685
I'm not sure.

1650
01:10:55,686 --> 01:10:58,427
What's holding you back?

1651
01:10:58,428 --> 01:11:01,647
Everything Madame Zoe
has said has come true

1652
01:11:01,648 --> 01:11:02,909
and that's why I keep wanting

1653
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:05,172
to spend time with Doctor John.

1654
01:11:05,173 --> 01:11:09,046
But I just a little confused
because spending time with Sean

1655
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:10,830
is so much easier.

1656
01:11:10,831 --> 01:11:15,270
Either Madame Zoe's fortunes
are real or she is a fraud.

1657
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,056
So far, she's
seemed pretty real.

1658
01:11:20,188 --> 01:11:23,756
All I know is, I used to
feel in control of my life.

1659
01:11:23,757 --> 01:11:28,500
Then after Madame Zoe, I
started to feel uncertain.

1660
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:30,589
So many things were concrete

1661
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:35,639
and I just feel like I'm on
board a ship that's lost at sea,

1662
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:39,381
and I have no control.

1663
01:11:39,382 --> 01:11:41,470
Do you feel you
have control now?

1664
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:43,341
It's had to feel in control

1665
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:45,691
when fortunes seem to
be dictating your life.

1666
01:11:45,692 --> 01:11:47,737
But it's not that.

1667
01:11:47,738 --> 01:11:49,739
It's fate not
dictating your life,

1668
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:53,220
but showing you a better future.

1669
01:11:53,221 --> 01:11:55,266
I just want stability

1670
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:59,009
and to feel like I am
accomplishing something good.

1671
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:02,752
By taking this course, I
feel like I am doing that.

1672
01:12:02,753 --> 01:12:06,712
Maybe Sean is helping
you to get what you want.

1673
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:10,412
But that doesn't mean
that he's the one.

1674
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:12,196
You need to make a choose,

1675
01:12:12,197 --> 01:12:15,287
and you know who I vote for.

1676
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,090
You kiss her yet?

1677
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:38,570
No.

1678
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:39,658
And that's none
of your business.

1679
01:12:39,659 --> 01:12:41,356
Of course it's my business.

1680
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,835
I gotta know when
to get me a new suit

1681
01:12:42,836 --> 01:12:45,403
for when you ask me
to be your best man.

1682
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:46,578
I'm taking it slow.

1683
01:12:46,579 --> 01:12:49,015
A little too
slow, if you ask me.

1684
01:12:49,016 --> 01:12:51,409
Does she even know how you feel?

1685
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:52,976
I don't know.

1686
01:12:52,977 --> 01:12:54,673
Why are we talking about
this stuff anyways?

1687
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:57,067
'Cause you gotta let
her know how you feel.

1688
01:12:57,068 --> 01:12:58,416
Yeah, I don't know.

1689
01:12:58,417 --> 01:12:59,896
It seems risky.

1690
01:12:59,897 --> 01:13:02,115
You're a good looking man, Sean.

1691
01:13:02,116 --> 01:13:04,248
Thank you, I think.

1692
01:13:04,249 --> 01:13:05,163
I mean it.

1693
01:13:05,164 --> 01:13:06,685
You got a lot going on for you.

1694
01:13:06,686 --> 01:13:11,342
And ever since you met this
girl, you've been different.

1695
01:13:11,343 --> 01:13:13,779
And I don't want you to
lose out on this opportunity

1696
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,956
for you to be happy again.

1697
01:13:53,211 --> 01:13:54,211
Wait.

1698
01:13:56,997 --> 01:13:59,172
This isn't fair to you, John.

1699
01:13:59,173 --> 01:14:00,173
What?

1700
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:05,049
I don't think.

1701
01:14:17,714 --> 01:14:20,064
That this is gonna work out.

1702
01:14:21,413 --> 01:14:22,848
Oh.

1703
01:14:22,849 --> 01:14:25,372
It's just not meant to be.

1704
01:14:25,373 --> 01:14:27,723
It was worth a shot.

1705
01:14:27,724 --> 01:14:30,552
You're a really good man John.

1706
01:14:30,553 --> 01:14:34,512
You know, you're gonna
make someone really happy.

1707
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:35,775
But not you.

1708
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:41,651
Thanks for understanding.

1709
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:51,442
Mike, hey, have you seen Sean?

1710
01:14:51,443 --> 01:14:53,313
I haven't been able
to get a hold of him.

1711
01:14:53,314 --> 01:14:54,706
I thought he was on
his way to see you.

1712
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:56,055
No, I haven't seen him.

1713
01:14:56,056 --> 01:14:57,710
Oh, let me try him.

1714
01:15:01,148 --> 01:15:02,453
Hey Sean.

1715
01:15:02,454 --> 01:15:03,411
Hey what's going on, man?

1716
01:15:03,412 --> 01:15:06,544
I got Ali here looking for you.

1717
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:07,545
Ah, okay.

1718
01:15:11,071 --> 01:15:12,071
Yeah I see.

1719
01:15:13,247 --> 01:15:14,987
All right, bye.

1720
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:15,988
He's okay?

1721
01:15:15,989 --> 01:15:17,121
Yeah, he's.

1722
01:15:21,865 --> 01:15:22,865
He said.

1723
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:27,566
Mike, where is he?

1724
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:35,921
Hey, Sean.

1725
01:15:37,097 --> 01:15:38,707
I've been looking for you.

1726
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:39,970
You found me.

1727
01:15:41,449 --> 01:15:46,193
Sean there's something that
I need talk to you about.

1728
01:15:47,368 --> 01:15:49,021
Remember that day
at the carnival,

1729
01:15:49,022 --> 01:15:51,546
after the whole
Ferris Wheel incident,

1730
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,766
I was there looking for Madame
Zoe, the fortune teller?

1731
01:15:54,767 --> 01:15:57,073
It was because of
something that she told me.

1732
01:15:57,074 --> 01:15:59,728
Because she said I would
need to find a new apartment,

1733
01:15:59,729 --> 01:16:01,207
and that I would need a new job.

1734
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:03,732
And that I should be on the
lookout for my soulmate,

1735
01:16:03,733 --> 01:16:05,690
some guy named John.

1736
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:07,170
Why are you telling me all this?

1737
01:16:07,171 --> 01:16:10,477
My friends and I, we put
together a list of every John

1738
01:16:10,478 --> 01:16:11,696
that we knew.

1739
01:16:11,697 --> 01:16:14,525
And then they gave me
this dating calendar

1740
01:16:14,526 --> 01:16:16,483
and I went a long with it.

1741
01:16:16,484 --> 01:16:19,748
And I don't know why I did,
I really shouldn't have.

1742
01:16:19,749 --> 01:16:21,576
And then it turned
into this fiasco,

1743
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:25,057
where I was going out
on a date every night.

1744
01:16:25,058 --> 01:16:27,669
So, every one of
those dates you went on

1745
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:30,063
was with someone named John?

1746
01:16:32,979 --> 01:16:34,153
I didn't want to give

1747
01:16:34,154 --> 01:16:35,938
Madame Zoe's fortune
a second thought,

1748
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:38,331
but then my apartment flooded

1749
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:40,116
and then needed
to find a new job.

1750
01:16:40,117 --> 01:16:43,859
And I thought that there
might be something to it.

1751
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,818
You know, I know
that sounds crazy.

1752
01:16:46,819 --> 01:16:48,212
Yeah, it does.

1753
01:16:49,866 --> 01:16:52,912
But I don't want
it to be that way.

1754
01:16:54,305 --> 01:16:57,655
I broke off my date
tonight because I wanted.

1755
01:16:57,656 --> 01:17:01,180
You break all your
dates with a kiss?

1756
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:03,226
You see that?

1757
01:17:03,227 --> 01:17:05,708
Apparently I wasn't supposed to.

1758
01:17:08,536 --> 01:17:10,755
Sean, it is not what you think.

1759
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:12,715
No, then what is it?

1760
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,024
It's just that, he
not the right one.

1761
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:22,507
Well I'm sure there are
plenty more Johns out there.

1762
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,255
You're gonna make
a great EMT, Ali.

1763
01:17:49,273 --> 01:17:54,278
It's fine, at least now I
can focus completely on class.

1764
01:18:04,767 --> 01:18:07,291
It's rigorous but.

1765
01:18:08,335 --> 01:18:10,990
You know what I mean.

1766
01:18:42,326 --> 01:18:43,936
Thank you so much
for everything.

1767
01:19:14,488 --> 01:19:18,796
I'm tired of being
around Mr. Doom and Gloom.

1768
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:20,842
So what if your name isn't John.

1769
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:22,321
You liked her right?

1770
01:19:22,322 --> 01:19:24,629
I mean you really like her?

1771
01:19:26,065 --> 01:19:27,850
Yeah, I really did.

1772
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:32,027
There are some men who are good

1773
01:19:32,028 --> 01:19:34,986
at communicating what they want.

1774
01:19:34,987 --> 01:19:38,424
But more often than not,
we're taught to stay strong,

1775
01:19:38,425 --> 01:19:40,775
be tough in the face of sadness.

1776
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,559
It's like we are supposed
to put up a false bravado

1777
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,041
when grappling with emotions.

1778
01:19:46,172 --> 01:19:47,694
That's surprisingly deep.

1779
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:50,523
Most of us aren't always
able to share our worries

1780
01:19:50,524 --> 01:19:53,613
and fears and
frustrations with others.

1781
01:19:53,614 --> 01:19:57,052
We all need a woman we can
open up to, someone kind

1782
01:19:57,053 --> 01:20:01,012
and understanding, we
can be vulnerable with.

1783
01:20:01,013 --> 01:20:03,624
And you need to open up to her.

1784
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,933
I know you've been
hurt before, I know.

1785
01:20:09,935 --> 01:20:12,633
But you gotta give her a chance.

1786
01:20:34,612 --> 01:20:36,352
It's a lot more
quieter with Ali gone.

1787
01:20:36,353 --> 01:20:37,570
You hear from her?

1788
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:40,269
No, not since she
moved to her new place.

1789
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:41,879
I need some chocolate.

1790
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,880
Okay.

1791
01:20:45,536 --> 01:20:46,319
Everything okay?

1792
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,494
Oh, this isn't good.

1793
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:49,756
Oh no.

1794
01:20:49,757 --> 01:20:50,757
Do we need to go
to the hospital?

1795
01:20:50,758 --> 01:20:51,629
That might be a good idea.

1796
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:52,716
Okay, all right.

1797
01:20:52,717 --> 01:20:53,935
Okay, come on.

1798
01:20:53,936 --> 01:20:55,893
Oh, no, no, no, it's
worse when I stand.

1799
01:20:55,894 --> 01:20:56,721
Okay.

1800
01:20:56,722 --> 01:20:57,895
Call 911.

1801
01:20:57,896 --> 01:20:59,723
- Okay, all right.
- And then call Brian.

1802
01:20:59,724 --> 01:21:00,638
Okay.

1803
01:21:00,638 --> 01:21:01,595
Okay, I'm gonna lie down now.

1804
01:21:01,595 --> 01:21:02,509
Yes, yes, yes, okay.

1805
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:03,989
Oh, mind my feet, thank you.

1806
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,007
It can't be.

1807
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:25,054
Breathe.

1808
01:21:25,054 --> 01:21:26,054
Okay.

1809
01:21:26,751 --> 01:21:27,751
Oh, okay.

1810
01:21:30,276 --> 01:21:31,581
You've gotta be kidding me.

1811
01:21:31,582 --> 01:21:33,061
Oh, let them in.

1812
01:21:33,062 --> 01:21:35,150
- Okay.
- Hey Brooke.

1813
01:21:35,151 --> 01:21:36,151
Hi.

1814
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:38,284
Hi Sean.

1815
01:21:38,285 --> 01:21:39,545
Hi.

1816
01:21:39,546 --> 01:21:41,417
You're still in your
second trimester, right?

1817
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:42,461
How far apart are
your contractions?

1818
01:21:42,462 --> 01:21:43,723
Are they pretty regular?

1819
01:21:43,724 --> 01:21:45,073
Usually every 15 to 30 seconds,

1820
01:21:45,074 --> 01:21:47,249
but some as long as
two or three minutes.

1821
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:49,120
Okay, let's get you as
comfortable as possible

1822
01:21:49,121 --> 01:21:51,471
and see if they subside
as you change positions.

1823
01:22:03,005 --> 01:22:04,483
Alison,

1824
01:22:04,484 --> 01:22:06,051
I was expecting you.

1825
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:22,197
It looks like your
blood pressure's back to normal.

1826
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:24,503
So they weren't contractions?

1827
01:22:24,504 --> 01:22:25,765
Did you have Braxton-Hicks

1828
01:22:25,766 --> 01:22:28,551
with either of your
previous pregnancies?

1829
01:22:28,552 --> 01:22:29,422
No.

1830
01:22:29,423 --> 01:22:31,207
Braxton, who, what?

1831
01:22:32,599 --> 01:22:34,513
It's like when your uterus
rehearses for delivery.

1832
01:22:34,514 --> 01:22:36,559
The contractions are
infrequent and irregular

1833
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,909
and usually subside as
you change positions.

1834
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:41,172
Real labor contractions
are longer, stronger

1835
01:22:41,173 --> 01:22:44,349
and get closer together
the more you're near labor.

1836
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:46,482
Just try to stay off
your feet for a while.

1837
01:22:46,483 --> 01:22:47,918
Give your doctor a call.

1838
01:22:47,919 --> 01:22:49,747
Try and avoid stress.

1839
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:53,358
You can help me avoid stress

1840
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:55,360
by making things right with Ali.

1841
01:22:55,361 --> 01:23:00,366
She doesn't care if your name
is Sean, John, Jacob, Alice.

1842
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:01,976
She wants you.

1843
01:23:02,412 --> 01:23:03,760
She does.

1844
01:23:03,761 --> 01:23:05,240
Yeah.

1845
01:23:05,241 --> 01:23:07,199
Maybe you need to go find her.

1846
01:23:08,722 --> 01:23:13,161
Sean, I realize that I may
have been a little blinded

1847
01:23:13,162 --> 01:23:15,337
by trying to find
a guy named John,

1848
01:23:15,338 --> 01:23:17,904
rather than seeing what
you and Ali have together.

1849
01:23:17,905 --> 01:23:21,256
I just love Ali and I
want what's best for her.

1850
01:23:21,257 --> 01:23:23,954
So I'll find out where she is.

1851
01:23:23,955 --> 01:23:25,042
Helen.

1852
01:23:25,043 --> 01:23:26,217
Brian.

1853
01:23:26,218 --> 01:23:28,264
It's okay, it's
okay, false alarm.

1854
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,180
I'm so sorry, I cam
as fast as I could.

1855
01:23:32,181 --> 01:23:33,746
Wow you look fantastic
in this sweater.

1856
01:23:33,747 --> 01:23:35,662
Oh babe, thanks.

1857
01:23:45,498 --> 01:23:48,196
Not everything
you said came true.

1858
01:23:48,197 --> 01:23:50,067
It's not possible.

1859
01:23:50,068 --> 01:23:52,939
Was written in the
stars and must be so.

1860
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:57,074
The first two predictions
came true, but the third one.

1861
01:23:57,075 --> 01:23:59,077
There is no John for me.

1862
01:24:01,253 --> 01:24:03,038
What did you say?

1863
01:24:13,352 --> 01:24:16,311
That there is no John for me.

1864
01:24:16,312 --> 01:24:18,836
I'm meant to be with Sean.

1865
01:24:28,454 --> 01:24:31,326
That is what I said, Sean.

1866
01:24:31,327 --> 01:24:32,458
Wait, what?

1867
01:24:33,851 --> 01:24:35,808
Spell his name for me.

1868
01:24:35,809 --> 01:24:38,334
S-E-A-N, Sean.

1869
01:24:40,553 --> 01:24:42,511
Are you serious?

1870
01:24:42,512 --> 01:24:45,167
That's not what it sounds
like you're saying.

1871
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,752
I remember you.

1872
01:25:07,058 --> 01:25:10,495
I'm so sorry about what
happened last time.

1873
01:25:10,496 --> 01:25:11,932
Do you want a free ride?

1874
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:15,022
Sure, why not.

1875
01:25:25,903 --> 01:25:26,903
Thanks.

1876
01:25:29,863 --> 01:25:30,951
Hold up.

1877
01:25:40,265 --> 01:25:42,876
I thought you wouldn't get
on one of these things again.

1878
01:25:45,357 --> 01:25:48,011
What are you doing here?

1879
01:25:48,012 --> 01:25:49,535
Looking for you.

1880
01:25:59,763 --> 01:26:02,460
Why were you looking for me?

1881
01:26:02,461 --> 01:26:04,810
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

1882
01:26:04,811 --> 01:26:07,204
You shouldn't be
the one apologizing.

1883
01:26:07,205 --> 01:26:10,033
I'm the one who had my
priorities all mixed up.

1884
01:26:10,034 --> 01:26:13,819
I didn't see what I had
right in front of me.

1885
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:16,692
I was wrong to turn
away from you so quickly.

1886
01:26:16,693 --> 01:26:19,957
I was just hurt and
trying to protect myself.

1887
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:22,176
You know, what
you saw that night,

1888
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:23,612
it's not what you think.

1889
01:26:23,613 --> 01:26:25,657
The only John worth dating,

1890
01:26:25,658 --> 01:26:27,877
I told him I didn't
wanna see him any more

1891
01:26:27,878 --> 01:26:32,098
so he kissed me to try
and change my mind.

1892
01:26:32,099 --> 01:26:33,274
Why did you break up with him

1893
01:26:33,275 --> 01:26:36,103
if you were supposed
to end up with a John?

1894
01:26:38,018 --> 01:26:39,584
Because I finally found someone

1895
01:26:39,585 --> 01:26:41,631
that I did want to be with.

1896
01:26:43,676 --> 01:26:44,676
Me too.

1897
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:47,158
I mean, with you.

1898
01:26:48,942 --> 01:26:51,422
All the time we've spent
together, its felt so natural.

1899
01:26:51,423 --> 01:26:54,774
Like nothing's missing anymore.

1900
01:26:57,951 --> 01:26:59,475
I feel the same.

1901
01:27:00,563 --> 01:27:03,869
Even though my name's not John?

1902
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,436
It's a funny story about that.

1903
01:27:05,437 --> 01:27:08,484
It turns out, it
was you, all along.

1904
01:27:16,753 --> 01:27:18,188
Sorry,

1905
01:27:18,189 --> 01:27:21,279
I know how to fix it now,
just give me a minute.

1906
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,630
It's okay, we're good up here.

1907
01:27:26,066 --> 01:27:28,112
More than good.
