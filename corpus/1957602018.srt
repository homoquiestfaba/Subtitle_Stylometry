00:48:57,021 --> 00:48:59,762
LOOK, MY BOSS CALLED.
THEY LOST HIM.

718
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:00,850
HIM?

719
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:02,113
THE KOREAN GUY
WHO DEFINITELY DOES HAVE

720
00:49:02,156 --> 00:49:03,810
A BULLET MEANT FOR ME.

721
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:05,116
SHIT.
I'LL ARRANGE SURVEILLANCE.

722
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:06,987
SURVEILLANCE?
YEAH, RIGHT.

723
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:08,119
WHY DON'T YOU
CALL MY DAD?

724
00:49:08,162 --> 00:49:10,512
HE'S GOT REAL
HEAVY CONNECTIONS.

725
00:49:10,556 --> 00:49:11,644
LOOK, I GOT WORK TO DO.

726
00:49:11,687 --> 00:49:13,167
NOT ON THIS CASE, TRACY.

727
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:14,386
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY,

728
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:16,388
YOU'RE NOT ON ASSIGNMENT
IN BERLIN, OKAY?

729
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:18,303
EXCEPT I KNOW WHAT
WALTER IN BALLISTICS

730
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:19,739
TOLD ME ABOUT THE GUN.

731
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:21,175
WAIT A MINUTE.

732
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:23,134
YOU SAID WALTER
IN BALLISTICS TOLD YOU?

733
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:25,484
ABOUT WHAT GUN?

734
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:29,053
LOOK, ERIK...

735
00:49:29,096 --> 00:49:32,012
I NEED SOMEONE
I CAN TRUST.

736
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:36,625
LET'S GO.

737
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:43,981
LISTEN, I WANT TO
SOLVE THIS CASE

738
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:45,417
AND BE DONE WITH IT
MORE THAN ANYONE,

739
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,635
BUT THE FACT IS
ALL I'VE GOT

740
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:47,636
IS THIS
ANDRE MARKIWICH.

741
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,508
MARKINICH.

742
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:51,640
AND NOW OSLER
KNOWS HIS NAME.

743
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:54,121
ERIK, YOUR FRIEND
OSLER STINKS.

744
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:56,080
THE BULLET REMOVED FROM MY FATHER,

745
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:59,039
THE BULLET YOUR FRIEND OSLER
SAYS WAS NEVER FOUND,

746
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:01,563
CAME FROM THE GUN
I RECOVERED.

747
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:04,653
YOUR BALLISTICS GUY TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT.

748
00:50:04,697 --> 00:50:06,916
I DIDN'T THINK YOU KNEW.

749
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,745
ERIK, IT ALL ADDS UP.

750
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:11,095
HE TOOK YOU OFF YOUR CASE

751
00:50:11,138 --> 00:50:12,574
BECAUSE YOU WERE GETTING TOO CLOSE.

752
00:50:12,618 --> 00:50:14,098
HE SEALED
THE BALLISTICS REPORT

753
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:16,056
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
LIKE ITS CONTENTS.

754
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,319
HE MADE SURE HE GOT
MARKINICH'S NAME.

755
00:50:18,363 --> 00:50:22,410
OH, SO YOU THINK HANS
WOULD DO SOMETHING
TO MARKINICH.

756
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:24,369
YES.

757
00:50:24,412 --> 00:50:27,720
WHAT ABOUT HIM?
HE'S YOUR SUSPECT.

758
00:50:27,763 --> 00:50:29,026
NOT ANYMORE.

759
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:33,943
THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING,
MY FATHER WAS LATE.

760
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:36,076
HE INTRODUCED ME 
TO AN OLD FRIEND--

761
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,383
HANS OSLER.

762
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:41,951
HE ATE BY THE WINDOW 
WITH ANOTHER MAN.

763
00:50:41,995 --> 00:50:45,868
HE WAS STILL THERE 
WHEN WE LEFT.

764
00:50:45,912 --> 00:50:47,000
WE WALKED OUT OF 
THE RESTAURANT...

765
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,001
[ gunshot]

766
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,176
I HEARD DAD GASP.

767
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,960
I TURNED AROUND

768
00:50:51,004 --> 00:50:53,528
AND SAW THE MAN 
STOP ABOUT THERE.

769
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:56,401
BUT I DID NOT SEE
A GUN IN HIS HAND.

770
00:50:56,444 --> 00:50:59,143
MAYBE HE HAD IT HIDDEN.

771
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:01,580
HE LOOKED TO HIS LEFT.

772
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:03,451
THEN WHIRLED AROUND 
AND TOOK OFF.

773
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:06,672
I TURNED BACK TO DAD, WHO WAS LYING ON THE SIDEWALK.

774
00:51:06,715 --> 00:51:08,935
HE'D FALLEN WITH 
HIS BACK TO THE DOOR,

775
00:51:08,978 --> 00:51:12,069
WHICH MEANS THAT THE BULLET
DID NOT COME FROM HIM.

776
00:51:13,244 --> 00:51:15,333
IT CAME FROM...

777
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:20,077
[ gunshot ]

778
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,295
THERE.

779
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:24,777
SO THE SNIPER
WAS IN THE BMW.

780
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,084
Tracy: 
AND THE TARGET WAS NOT ME,

781
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,477
NEITHER MY FATHER, 
NOR HANS OSLER.

782
00:51:29,521 --> 00:51:32,045
IT WAS KONSTANTIN VARDA.

783
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,133
VARDA?

784
00:51:45,232 --> 00:51:47,974
ANDRE MARKINICH?

785
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,898
GOOD NEWS.

786
00:52:00,508 --> 00:52:03,207
I HAD AN INSTINCT,
A FEELING YOUR KIDNAPPING CASE

787
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,122
AND MY FATHER'S SHOOTING
WERE CONNECTED.

788
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:07,211
JUST SHUT THE DOOR.

789
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:26,578
YOU HAVE TO
CONFRONT OSLER,
EXPOSE THE TRUTH.

790
00:52:26,621 --> 00:52:28,449
COME ON, I'VE KNOWN
OSLER FOR YEARS.

791
00:52:28,493 --> 00:52:30,625
HE DOESN'T HAVE
A SINGLE MARK AGAINST HIM.

792
00:52:30,669 --> 00:52:33,193
THERE'S BEEN NO REASON
TO SUSPECT HIM.

793
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:34,673
KONSTANTIN.

794
00:52:34,716 --> 00:52:37,066
KONSTANTIN VARDA,
OUR CHIEF SUSPECT.

795
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:38,677
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

796
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,244
MISS TRACY, I HEAR DOOR
JUST IN TIME.

797
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:42,376
I SNEAK OUT BALCONY.

798
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,860
WAIT HERE.

799
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:15,714
YOUR FRIEND
FROM CALIFORNIA?

800
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:19,370
COME ON, LET'S GO.

801
00:53:19,413 --> 00:53:22,111
Erik: 
THE RUSSIAN MAFIA 
KIDNAPPED HIS CHILD.

802
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:25,071
WHY RUSSIAN?

803
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:27,682
ORGANIZED CRIME
IS THE NEW COMMUNISM.

804
00:53:27,726 --> 00:53:30,816
THE RUSSIANS ARE DEEP
INTO THE REFUGEE CAMPS.

805
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:33,079
BLACK MARKET, DRUGS, GUN RUNNING,

806
00:53:33,122 --> 00:53:35,124
EVEN NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY.

807
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:37,692
AND THEY'RE
VERY WELL CONNECTED.

808
00:53:37,736 --> 00:53:40,826
INFANTS STARTED
DISAPPEARING MORE FREQUENTLY

809
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:42,175
TWO AND A HALF
YEARS AGO.

810
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,959
WHEN WAS YOUR
DAUGHTER KIDNAPPED?

811
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:46,788
- FOUR MONTHS AGO.
- AND SUDDENLY HE'S
SHIPPED OFF TO MUNICH--

812
00:53:46,832 --> 00:53:49,574
NO POLICE EFFORT
TO FIND HIS CHILD, NOTHING.

813
00:53:49,617 --> 00:53:51,576
WHY DID YOU
COME BACK TO BERLIN?

814
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:53,273
I HEAR RUMOR.

815
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:55,101
MAYBE MY DAUGHTER
HERE SOMEWHERE.

816
00:53:55,144 --> 00:53:57,669
A RUMOR?

817
00:53:57,712 --> 00:54:01,629
A MAN HAS MY NADIA.

818
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:02,978
BRUMM.

819
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:05,938
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THIS BEFORE?

820
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:08,506
I NOT SURE I TRUST YOU.

821
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:11,422
- [ Erik dialing]
- NOW I DO.

822
00:54:12,901 --> 00:54:15,730
PETRA, GET ME
A LIST OF COUPLES

823
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:18,255
DENIED ADOPTION
THE PAST FOUR YEARS,

824
00:54:18,298 --> 00:54:20,561
AND RUN A CHECK
ON THE NAME OF BRUMM.

825
00:54:20,605 --> 00:54:21,606
OKAY.

826
00:54:21,649 --> 00:54:22,998
BRUMM MEANS
SOMETHING TO YOU?

827
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:24,086
MANFRED BRUMM DOES.

828
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,001
HE'S GOT MORE
MONEY THAN GOD,

829
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:28,134
AND HE IS VERY
WELL-CONNECTED.

830
00:54:28,177 --> 00:54:31,050
OKAY, YOU'LL STAY HERE.
YOU'LL BE SAFE.

831
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:35,141
TOMORROW NIGHT
IS A BENEFIT DINNER

832
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:37,012
AT THE LAPIDARIUM MUSEUM.

833
00:54:37,056 --> 00:54:38,231
MANFRED BRUMM
WILL BE THERE,

834
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,146
AND SO WILL WE.

835
00:54:51,244 --> 00:54:53,594
SEEMS SOMEONE
FELL IN, HUH?

836
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:55,204
OH.

837
00:54:55,248 --> 00:54:58,120
THAT'S WHY WE GIVE YOU
SWIMMING LESSONS, HUH?

838
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,866
SO, MR. BRUMM,
YOUR LOVELY WIFE

839
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:49,346
AND BEAUTIFUL BABY
DAUGHTER ARE WELL?

840
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:50,738
QUITE WELL,
THANK YOU.

841
00:55:50,782 --> 00:55:52,218
AND YOUR FAMILY?

842
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:55,439
SEEMS LIKE
I'M ALWAYS HAVING TO
IMPOSE NEW DISCIPLINES,

843
00:55:55,482 --> 00:55:57,789
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY
AS LARGE AS MINE,

844
00:55:57,832 --> 00:55:59,878
I GUESS
IT'S TO BE EXPECTED.

845
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:01,967
OUR ENTERPRISES,
PROGRESSING WELL?

846
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:05,405
WE ARE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE,
AND GAINING EVERY DAY.

847
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:08,060
AND THE MINOR
INCONVENIENCE?

848
00:56:08,103 --> 00:56:10,105
HMM?

849
00:56:10,149 --> 00:56:11,106
THAT ROMANIAN.

850
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:13,152
THIS PROBLEM
WILL GO AWAY SOON.

851
00:56:13,195 --> 00:56:15,459
GOOD. MY FAMILY
WILL BE GRATEFUL.

852
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:17,896
CONSIDER IT DONE.

853
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:21,073
AND THEY SAY
THE GERMANS AND RUSSIANS
COULDN'T WORK TOGETHER.

854
00:56:21,116 --> 00:56:22,030
HMM.

855
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:25,077
[ both chuckle ]

856
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:30,125
YOU MIND?

857
00:56:30,169 --> 00:56:32,998
NO. YOU SUITS DON'T
GET DOWN HERE VERY OFTEN.

858
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:34,869
HELP YOURSELF.

859
00:56:37,306 --> 00:56:39,004
YOU DIDN'T COME DOWN
TO THE DUNGEON

860
00:56:39,047 --> 00:56:42,007
JUST TO, LIKE,
LET OFF STEAM,
DID YOU?

861
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,922
TELL ME, THAT AMERICAN
WHO WAS SHOT,

862
00:56:43,965 --> 00:56:45,837
DID YOU CONDUCT
THOSE TESTS?

863
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,666
NO, THAT WAS WALTER.

864
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:51,016
- WALTER.
- YEAH.

865
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,976
IS HE AROUND?

866
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,238
NO, LUCKY MAN'S
LYING ON A BEACH

867
00:56:56,282 --> 00:56:58,110
SOMEWHERE IN MAJORCA.

868
00:56:58,153 --> 00:57:00,373
UH-HUH.
VACATION.

869
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,810
HOW ABOUT HIS REPORT?

870
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:04,116
SEALED AND REMOVED.

871
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:06,423
THERE ISN'T EVEN 
A LAB COPY.

872
00:57:08,947 --> 00:57:10,862
THAT'S NOT STANDARD
PROCEDURE, IS IT?

873
00:57:10,905 --> 00:57:12,733
NO, IT CERTAINLY ISN'T.

874
00:57:12,777 --> 00:57:14,126
POOR WALTER WAS
HALFWAY OUT THE DOOR,

875
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:16,563
AND OSLER DEMANDED THAT
HE TAKE THE CASE OVER.

876
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:18,478
I MEAN, I REALIZE
IT'S HIGH PRIORITY,

877
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:21,612
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN
OSLER QUITE SO EAGER.

878
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:24,092
I SEE.

879
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:26,181
WELL, THANK YOU.

880
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:27,879
A PLEASURE.
NICE TO SEE YOU, ERIK.

881
00:57:27,922 --> 00:57:28,923
TAKE CARE.

882
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:30,969
SEE YOU.

883
00:57:37,149 --> 00:57:41,893
BUT THERE'S A BEAR WALKING
THROUGH THE WOODS.

884
00:57:41,936 --> 00:57:45,462
AND HE'S SO HUNGRY.
HE NEEDS FOOD.

885
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:48,334
HE WANTS TO EAT A LITTLE
FROM YOUR HAND.

886
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:55,167
"EMIL AND
THE DETECTIVES."

887
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,560
Konstantin: 
BUT STILL HUNGRY!

888
00:57:56,603 --> 00:57:59,171
YOUR FATHER WILL REMAIN
ON A 24-HOUR WATCH.

889
00:57:59,214 --> 00:58:00,302
THANK YOU.

890
00:58:00,346 --> 00:58:01,956
OH, GREAT,
YOU FOUND EMIL.

891
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,655
IT'S BEEN
