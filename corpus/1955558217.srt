1
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:38,409
- I am the
first and the last.

2
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,912
I am the honored one
and the scorned one.

3
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,542
I am the whore and the holy one.

4
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,337
I am the wife and the virgin.

5
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,507
I am the barren one

6
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,553
And many are my daughters.

7
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,730
I am the silence that
you cannot understand.

8
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,860
I am the utterance of my name.

9
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,641
- I can't believe it.

10
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,852
I had no idea.

11
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:12,938
Cousin Mary.

12
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,820
Praise the lord, Mr. Snead,
my dear cousin, Mary Peazant.

13
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,615
This has turned out to
be a very special day

14
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,285
for the Peazant family, indeed.

15
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,123
- Viola.

16
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,795
- Pleasure to meet
you, Mary Peazant.

17
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,925
- Yellow, they call
me Yellow Mary.

18
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:49,183
- Our
fathers were brothers.

19
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,685
Of course, compared
to some people,

20
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:55,773
Yellow Mary's not all
that lightskinned, but...

21
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,068
Yellow Mary, I'd
like you to meet

22
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,612
my photographer, Mr. Snead.

23
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,865
I've commissioned Mr.
Snead to photograph

24
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,577
our family crossing
over to the mainland.

25
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,456
What's past is prologue.

26
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:19,797
I see this day as their
first steps toward progress,

27
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,385
an engraved invitation
to the culture

28
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,888
and education and
wealth of the mainland.

29
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,975
Yellow Mary, wouldn't you agree?

30
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,756
- My
story begins on the eve

31
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,676
of my family's migration north.

32
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,514
My story begins
before I was born.

33
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,360
My great-great-grandmother,
Nana Peazant,

34
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,988
saw her family coming apart,

35
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,951
her flowers to bloom
in a distant frontier.

36
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,373
And then, there was my
ma and daddy's problem.

37
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,532
Nana prayed and the old souls

38
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,993
guided me into the New World.

39
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,915
I came in time for
the big celebration,

40
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:23,086
to be among my cousins,
my aunties, and uncles.

41
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,173
I can still see their faces,

42
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,259
smell the oil in
the wicker lamps.

43
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,095
I can hear the voice
of Auntie Haagar

44
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:36,016
calling out for her
daughters, Iona and Myown.

45
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,937
And teasing the newlyweds.

46
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,131
- Kalos, beautiful, eidos, form.

47
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,218
Skopein, to view.

48
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,186
If an object is placed
between two mirrors,

49
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:26,149
inclined at right angles, an
image is formed in each mirror.

50
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,777
Then, these mirror
images are in turn

51
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,154
reflected in the other mirror,

52
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,074
forming the appearance of four,

53
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,827
symmetrically-shaped objects.

54
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,372
Oh, I think it's just
a wonderful discovery.

55
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,208
It's beauty,
simplicity, and science

56
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,210
all rolled into one small tube.

57
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,965
I think the children
will enjoy it.

58
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,009
- Yellow Mary, look!

59
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,974
Uncle Spikenard
used to live there.

60
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,475
Do you remember him?

61
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,102
Oh, I guess not.

62
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,897
I was just a young
Miss, too, then.

63
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:09,860
He was from Africa,
and just after the war,

64
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,778
he moved from the plantation to

65
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,990
that little house
on the waterfront.

66
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,788
Remember how when
Uncle Spikenard

67
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,375
got excited or angry
he'd talk funny

68
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,336
so the children
couldn't understand him?

69
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:31,757
He'd speak in
African words and sounds.

70
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:37,346
You know, just before the
war, Uncle Spikenard told me,

71
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:41,016
they'd keep boatloads
of fresh Africans

72
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,018
off on some secret
islands around here.

73
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,897
- Viola, our government banned
the transporting of Africans

74
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,734
for slavery 50 years
before the Civil War.

75
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,947
- Not back off on
these islands, no.

76
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,702
Just before the
war, they were still

77
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,122
running and hiding
saltwater Africans,

78
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,334
pure-bred, from the Yankees.

79
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,928

- Iona, you have to
go North with us.

00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,528
Auntie Haagar
won't let you stay.

117
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,405
We all have to leave.

118
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:50,241
We all have to leave together.

- Who's that?

120
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,847
What's your children up to now?

121
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,645
Get on with you, son, and help
me clear away these weeds.

122
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,073
- Just 'cause we crossing
over to the mainland,

123
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,076
it doesn't mean
we don't love you.

124
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,707
It doesn't mean we're not
going to miss you none.

125
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,462
And it doesn't mean
we're not going

126
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,883
to come home to visit
with you soon.

127
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:36,347
- Eli Peazant, if you don't
stop grinning at me...

128
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,600
It ain't right to
tease old folks,

129
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,518
especially your
great-grandmother.

130
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,939
You're lucky I've got breath
in me yet, you old Goober Head.

131
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,234
Goober Head.

132
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:52,655
Your name used to be called
Goober Head, remember that?

133
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,577
Goober means peanut.

134
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,207
- What is this?

135
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,546
Something seems to
be stuck in here.

136
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,431
- You know, your
grandaddy Shad ain't like

137
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,226
to see no woman chewing tobacco.

138
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,311
Ain't that so?

139
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,147
You know that's so.

140
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,357
- No, ma'am.

141
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,631
- I visit with old
Peazant every day

142
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,801
since the day him died.

143
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,722
It's up to the living to keep
in touch with the dead, Eli.

144
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,350
Man's power don't
end with death.

145
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,603
We just move on
to another place,

146
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:10,191
a place where we go and
watch over our living family.

147
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,153
Respect your elders.

148
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,072
Respect your family.

149
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,576
Respect your ancestors.

150
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,872
You're worried that
baby Eula's carrying

151
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:27,000
ain't yours because
she get forced.

152
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:32,589
You won't have no baby
that wasn't sent to you.

153
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,010
The ancestors and the womb,
they're one, they're the same.

154
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,764
Those in this grave, like those

155
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,976
who're across the
sea, they're with us.

156
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:49,272
They're all the same, the
ancestors and the womb.

157
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,652
Call on your ancestors, Eli.

158
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,362
Let them guide.

159
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,573
You need their strength.

160
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,910
Eli, I need for you
to make the family

161
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,537
strong again, like
we used to been.

162
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,750
- How can you understand
me and the way I feel?

163
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,753
This happened to
my wife, my wife!

164
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,469
I don't feel like
she mine no more.

165
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,598
When I look at her, I feel I
don't even want her no more.

166
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,435
- You can't get back
what you never owned.

167
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,856
Eula never belonged to
you, she married you.

168
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,277
- Why didn't you
protect us, Nana?

169
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,905
Someone put the fix on me.

170
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,616
Was it the conjure or bad luck?

171
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,535
Or were the old souls too
deep in their graves to give

172
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:48,623
a damn about my wife while
some stranger was riding her?

173
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:01,177
When we was children,
we really believed

174
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,555
you could work the
good out of evil.

175
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,976
We believed in the
newsprint on the walls,

176
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:11,187
your tree of glass
jars and bottles,

177
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,275
the rice you carry
in your pockets.

178
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,945
We believed in the
frizzled-haired chicken.

179
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,952
The coins, the roots,
and the flowers,

180
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,290
we believed they
would protect us

181
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,751
and every little thing
we owned or loved.

182
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,548
I wasn't scared of
nothing and no one

183
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,760
because I knew, I knew
my great-grandmother

184
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:46,681
had it all in her pocket
or could work it up.

185
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,061
- Never forget who we is

186
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,024
and how far we done come.

187
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,109
- I have to leave here.

188
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,947
I don't have no other choice.

189
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:07,702
- Eli, Eli!

190
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,415
There's a thought,
a recollection,

191
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,917
something somebody remembers.

192
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,422
We carry these
memories inside of we.

193
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,551
Do you believe that
those hundreds and
hundreds of Africans

194
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,720
brought here on this other side

195
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,015
would forget everything
they once knew?

196
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,851
We don't know where the
recollections come from.

197
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,395
Sometimes we dream them.

198
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:38,232
But we carry these
memories inside of we.

199
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,693
- What are we supposed
to remember, Nana?

200
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:44,280
How at one time we were able
to protect those we loved?

201
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,573
How in Africa
world we were kings

202
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,659
and queens and built
great, big cities?

203
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,830
- Eli, I'm trying to learn you
how to touch your own spirit.

204
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:58,753
I'm fighting for my life,
and I'm fighting for yours.

205
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,172
Look in my face!

206
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,804
I'm trying to give you something
to take north with you,

207
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,224
along with all your
great, big dreams!

208
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:17,271
Call on those old Africans, Eli.

209
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:21,401
They'll come to you when
you least expect them.

210
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,487
They'll hug you
up quick and soft

211
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,697
as the warm, sweet wind.

212
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:32,245
Let them old souls come
into your heart, Eli.

213
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,998
Let them touch you
with the hands of time.

214
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,127
Let them feed your
head with wisdom

215
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,130
that ain't from
this day and time.

216
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:47,218
'Cause when you leave
this island, Eli Peazant,

217
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:50,805
you ain't going to no
land of milk and honey.

218
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,605
Eli, I'm putting
my trust in you,

219
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,944
to keep the family
together up north.

220
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,367
That's the challenge facing
all you free Negroes.

221
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,912
Celebrate our ways.

222
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,850
Nana prayed for help.

223
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,478
I got there just in time.

224
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,821
- Come, child, come!

225
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:02,788
- Fresh and sweet like a
baby's breath.

226
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:56,676
- Eula.

227
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,763
Who done this to us?

228
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,891
- Nothing good can
come from knowing!

229
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,149
- Everything good done gone.

230
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,615
Our dreams are all gone.

231
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,975
- God as my witness...

232
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,110
when I leave this
place, I'm never

233
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,238
again going to
live in your land!

234
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,017
- Oh girl, you're so silly.

235
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,063
What are you looking at?

236
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,794
- Oh, I love you, oh!

237
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,925
Now, this means--

238
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,219
- Gumbo!

239
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:46,929
- Pot called?

240
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,222
- Sojo.

241
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:53,143
- Water, water.

242
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:55,020
- Deloe.

243
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,230
- Fire.

244
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,398
- Diffy!

245
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,110
- Yeah!

246
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,530
Now, that's all what
grandma remember.

247
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:14,456
- They the last of the
old and the first of the new.

248
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:18,669
The older I get, the
closer I get to the ground.

249
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:24,884
This was the worst place to
have been born in slavery time.

250
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:34,143
Their hands scarred with blue
from the poisonous indigo dye

251
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:38,564
what built up all them
plantations from swampland.

252
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:44,904
We spirit numb from the sting
of fever from the rice fields.

253
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,536
We back bend down
while we did planting

254
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:57,333
and the hoeing and
the Sea Island cotton.

255
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:04,882
I was an elder, and
many, many years back,

256
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:08,010
when I lay in my mother's arms,

257
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,346
I saw Africa in her face.

258
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,277
- It was an age

259
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,155
of beginnings, a
time of promises.

260
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:34,036
The newspaper said it
was a time for everyone,

261
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:39,166
the rich and the poor, the
powerful and the powerless.

262
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:57,851
- Eula say, we the
bridge that they cross over on.

263
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:00,896
We're the tie
between then and now,

264
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,900
between the past and the
story that will come.

265
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:25,939
- Old Man Peazant
granddaughter done come home.

266
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,276
- Oh, she got ruined.

267
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,488
Yellow Mary gone
off and got ruined.

268
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,241
- What's that she got with her?

269
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:37,493
- Iona!

270
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:40,454
Iona!

271
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,298
You go warn Nana Peazant.

272
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:54,843
It'll most likely kill her to
see this heifer done returned.

273
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,262
- But Ma, I don't think...

274
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,484
- All that yellow wasted.

275
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,918
- Ah, is this the
same little girl

276
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:32,339
I used to rock in
Gussie's yard?

277
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,764
- The shameless hussy.

278
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:48,605
- Look, Trula, this is Eula.

279
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:50,899
- Eula, nice to meet you.

280
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:06,874
- What is this?

281
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:19,469
- Store-bought
biscuits, Haagar.

282
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,597
- Bread from a store?

283
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,940
You know, Yellow
Mary, they say a woman

284
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:35,360
who knows how to cook
is mighty pretty.

285
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,113
- Ma, can I taste one?

286
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:47,247
- You know, I don't like
messing around in no kitchen.

287
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:50,667
- I wouldn't eat them no
how if she touched them.

288
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:53,503
- You never know where
her hands have been.

289
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:55,631
I mean, I can just
smell the heifer.

290
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:59,092
- Buzzards don't circle
in the air just for fun.

291
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,012
That gal's come back
here for something.

292
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,166
- Girl, what are you
doing with those things?

293
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,876
- Just make sure
ain't no dead crabs.

294
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,544
Ain't nobody wanna
eat no dead crab.

295
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:37,172
- Why're you making them crawl?

296
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:41,176
- Girl, you need to be
plucking this chicken.

297
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,596
- Throw one of them
things on Haagar.

298
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:45,597
- No, no.

299
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:11,290
- The Earth, O Lord, is
swelling with fruitage

300
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,670
and reminds us that this

301
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,840
is the seed time of life.

302
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,971
That not today, not
tomorrow will come

303
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,765
the true reaping
of the deeds we do

304
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,767
but in some far-veiled

305
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,730
and mighty harvest,

306
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,028
not deceiving ourselves with
the apparent ease of evil,

307
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:43,113
looking to that harvest

308
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:48,118
when the earth
belongs to the Lord,

309
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:52,331
not us and the fullness thereof.

310
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,006
Put that down.

311
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,348
Now, you know, when
I left this island,

312
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:15,187
I was a sinner and I
didn't even know it.

313
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,481
But I left these islands,

314
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,942
touched that mainland,

315
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,113
and fell into the
arms of the Lord.

316
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:31,244
- What they got
out there, Auntie Viola?

317
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:34,956
- Life, child, the
beginning of a new life.

318
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,795
- Who's out there?

319
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,759
- Jesus Christ,
baby, the Son of God.

320
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,349
- Heard you was coming.

321
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:56,144
I've been waiting to
see you since daybreak.

322
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,023
- I heard the drums
but I didn't know

323
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:03,777
they were talking
about me, you know.

324
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,946
- I wanted to
surprise you, Nana.

325
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:09,491
It's a hard thing to
do in Ibo Landing.

326
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:13,578
- No surprises
here, Yellow Mary.

327
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:32,722
What's that you wear
around your neck?

328
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,895
- St. Christopher's charm,
for travelers on a journey.

329
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,733
- What kind of belief is that?

330
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,485
He protect you?

331
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:24,900
- I see your family
sticks to the old ways.

332
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,654
- Yeah, yeah, we stick to them,

333
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:34,242
but times is a-changing,
and you know, Mr. Snead,

334
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:37,245
you have to change
with the times.

335
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:41,833
- Mr. Hail, you know
any of those old

336
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,420
Africans from your
plantation days?

337
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,781
- As much as I like to fish,

338
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,326
I'll never put a
pole in that water.

339
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:19,788
That's the spot where the
girl got drowned by her owner.

340
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,123
- Isn't this Ibo Landing?

341
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,795
- That don't mean
you can't drown here.

342
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:36,388
Say again how they
say water in Spanish.

343
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,350
- Agua.

344
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:45,272
- Agua, agua.

345
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:58,368
My Ma came to me
last night, you know?

346
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,830
She took me by the hand.

347
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:07,961
- Your titty's been
dead a long time, Eula.

348
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,048
- I needed to see my Ma.

349
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,970
I want to talk to her.

350
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:21,766
So I wrote her a letter,
put it beneath the bed

351
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:24,978
with a glass of
water, and I waited.

352
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,941
I waited, and my Ma came to me.

353
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,985
She came right away.

354
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:38,783
- Eula!

355
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:44,914
You're a real back-water
Geeche girl!

356
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:54,507
This must be the most
desolate place on the earth.

357
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,052
You know, I think
what I would do--

358
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,055
- No, Mary,
it's beautiful.

359
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,354
- Here it is folks, Ibo Landing,

360
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:11,691
reflecting the muddy
waters of history.

361
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,988
Me, myself, personally,
I don't look for

362
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:20,283
my reflection in no
muddy water, you know?

363
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:25,038
The only way for things to
change is to keep moving.

364
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,831
People sitting still,
men sitting still,

365
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:29,751
don't get it with me, you know?

366
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:37,175
Wish I could find
me a good man, Eula.

367
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,012
Somebody I could depend on.

368
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:45,392
Not that I'd want
to depend on him.

369
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:49,896
Just to know that I
could if I had to.

370
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,092
- Eula!

371
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:45,994
- Mind now, Yellow
Mary, you'll be itching soon.

372
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,705
- A little face powder never
hurt Yellow none, y'know.

373
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,039
It's these blood sucking gnats

374
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,709
is going to drive me back
over to the mainland.

375
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:56,337
You live like savages
back over in here.

376
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,277
Oh, you know,

377
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:25,575
I sure hope they're
fixing some gumbo.

378
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:29,287
It's been a long time since
I've had some good gumbo.

379
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,581
I had some in
Savannah, you know,

380
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,834
but they didn't put
everything in it.

381
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:43,259
I've haven't had some
good food in a long time.

382
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:47,222
- I found her.

383
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:52,143
I found her fetching her
parasol by Ibo Landing.

384
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,649
What kind of woman she is?

385
00:46:57,899 --> 00:46:59,984
Yellow Mary's no family woman.

386
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,028
She's a scary woman.

387
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,240
- She's a new kind of woman.

388
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,868
- At the same time, the
raping of colored women

389
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,663
is as common as fish in the sea.

390
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:19,003
You didn't tell Eli
who did it, did you?

391
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:30,098
You've got a good man, Eula,
somebody you can depend on.

392
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,350
He doesn't need to know what
could get himself killed.

393
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,310
There's enough uncertainty
in life without

394
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:38,064
wondering what tree your
husband's hanging from.

395
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,232
Don't tell him nothing.

396
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,075
- I
remember how important

397
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:52,495
the children were to
the Peazant family,

398
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:56,916
and how I had to convince my
daddy that I was his child.

399
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,341
- Hold it.

400
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:50,428
- If you want to know
about them African people,

401
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,847
you need to talk to Bilal.

402
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:59,020
- Salt
water negroes.

403
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:22,460
- They stole Bilal from Africa

404
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,796
when he was just a little boy.

405
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:28,299
He came over on the
very last slave ship.

406
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,094
Bilal came over on The Wanderer.

407
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,516
- My baby was born dead...

408
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,816
and my titty was full of milk.

409
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:51,572
We needed money, so I hired
out to a wealthy family,

410
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,326
some big, supposed
to be, muckety-mucks,

411
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:58,955
off Edisto Island,
high-falutin' buckra.

412
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:03,835
They go to Cuba, I go.

413
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:12,844
I nursed their baby and took
care of their other children.

414
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,558
That's how I got ruined.

415
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,605
I wanted to go home
and they keep me.

416
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:25,940
They keep me.

417
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,070
So I fix the titty,
they send me home.

418
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:48,726
- Iona, Iona!

419
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:53,606
Iona, Iona!

420
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:00,613
Where's that girl?

421
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,493
I don't know why
Nana Peazant won't

422
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:06,869
come sit herself down over here

423
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,747
near where we can
watch over her.

424
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,877
Snakes off in that high grass.

425
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:17,964
- Old people think they have
all the answers, you know?

426
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:21,842
Carrying around that
tin can.

427
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:24,762
I don't think I ever
see her without it.

428
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:27,598
- We ought to
save this one for Eula.

429
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,601
She's about as strange
as Nana Peazant.

430
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:34,063
Sometimes, I think that old
woman isn't in her right mind.

431
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:37,733
- Haagar Peazant, you're
laughing at an old woman,

432
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:42,280
and just like Eula, you
married into this family,

433
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,699
but she's our grandmother.

434
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,451
There's nothing wrong or harmful

435
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:51,539
in that tin can she
carries, just some old--

436
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:56,544
- Scraps of
memories!

437
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,046
- Now, I'll be
the first to admit

438
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:02,133
that Nana is carrying
a lot of luggage,

439
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:05,636
and she needs to put her soul
in the hands of the Lord,

440
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:09,473
but she built her life
around this family.

441
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,812
She's old and she's frightened.

442
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:21,110
What does Nana know
about the world outside?

443
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,111
Nothing.

444
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,614
Nana was never educated.

445
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:28,659
All she knows are simple things,

446
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,873
things people told
her a long time ago.

447
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,377
- That's why I say Nana
Peazant needs to pack

448
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,464
her things like the rest
of we and come along.

449
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:42,882
She doesn't need
to stay here like

450
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:45,926
she's somebody with no people.

451
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:47,678
- I might not have
been born into

452
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,805
this family, but I'm here now,

453
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:51,932
and I say let Nana
Peazant stay behind.

454
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:54,518
That's what she wants.

455
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:55,728
We're moving into a new day.

456
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:58,856
She's too much a
part of the past.

457
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:03,277
- Don't let Daddy Mac
hear your mouth!

458
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,072
- I'm a fully grown woman,

459
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:09,325
and I don't have
to mind what I say.

460
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,702
I done born five
children into the world

461
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,455
and put two in the ground
alongside their daddy.

462
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,666
I worked all my life and
got nothing to show for it.

463
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,669
And if I can't say
what's on my mind,

464
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,297
then damn everybody to hell!

465
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,009
- Mind now, the
Lord is listening!

466
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,721
- I'm an educated person,

467
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,765
and I'm tired of
those old stories,

468
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,892
watching her make
those root potions.

469
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,228
Hoodoo, she be talking!

470
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:39,563
Washing up in the river
with her clothes on,

471
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:42,733
just like those old Salt
Water folks used to do.

472
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:43,901
My children ain't gonna be like

473
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:47,238
those old Africans,
fresh off the boat.

474
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:50,157
My God, I still remember.

475
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:53,285
- And look at that
old crazy Bilal.

476
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,663
- Bilal Muhammed is a heathen.

477
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:56,580
- But he does

478
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,582
strange things, just like Nana.

479
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:02,002
- Hush, she's
our grandmother!

480
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,381
- Those old people,
they pray to the sun,

481
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,801
they pray to the moon,
sometimes just to a big star!

482
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,345
They ain't got no
religion in them.

483
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:15,474
No, this is a new world
we're moving into,

484
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:19,770
and I want my daughters to grow
up to be decent somebodies.

485
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:20,896
I don't even want
my girls to have

486
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:23,816
to hear about all that mess.

487
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,735
I'll lock horns with anybody and

488
00:57:26,986 --> 00:57:30,072
anything that tries
to hold me back.

489
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:34,034
Now I say, if Nana Peazant
wants to live and die

490
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:38,539
on Ibo Landing, then
God bless her old soul.

491
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:42,293
- I think it's going to rain.

492
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:50,843
- My
time was running out.

493
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,183
The women were
arguing and fighting.

494
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:00,227
I can still see the fear and the

495
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:03,022
hope in the eyes of our fathers.

496
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,484
They were the sons of drums,

497
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:10,321
who could only speak
of their future.

498
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:14,116
Everyone was just as
scared as Nana Peazant.

499
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:08,207
- Solomon's in town, got
a colored lady with him.

500
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:09,375
Says she's a newspaper woman.

501
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:34,066
- Cousin!

502
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:50,791
- We're working on the
anti-lynching law again.

503
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,419
Maybe you want to be with us.

504
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,045
- Maybe...

505
01:01:57,047 --> 01:02:00,801
I still be leaving with
the rest come morning.

506
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,741
- Maybe when we go north,
you'll take with you

507
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:26,410
more than Eula and your dreams.

508
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:32,332
- I ain't got no more
dreams, cousin.

509
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:44,219
- You've been practicing.

510
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,849
- In
this quiet place,

511
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:33,560
years ago, my family knelt down

512
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:37,815
and caught a glimpse
of the eternal.

513
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:44,404
We left our markers in the soil

514
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:48,408
in memory of the families
who once lived here.

515
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:02,881
We were the children of
those who chose to survive.

516
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:08,303
Years later, my Ma
told me she knew

517
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:13,433
I had been sent forward
by the old souls.

518
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,799
- That's mine,
that's me, no wait,

519
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:30,302
this one, this one,
wait, that one's you.

520
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:46,401
I was travelling on a spiritual mission,

521
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:49,821
but sometimes, I
would get distracted.

522
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,244
- I wish I had this doll,
I wish I had this doll,

523
01:05:56,495 --> 01:05:58,163
I wish I had this bed
to go inside my house.

524
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:00,165
- You ain't got no house!

525
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,292
- I wish I did.

526
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:06,213
If I did, I'd put this
bed inside my house.

527
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,714
Then I wish I had a rabbit.

528
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:09,383
- What'd
you wish for, Ninnyjugs?

529
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:10,592
- Everything!

530
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,262
- Ninnyjugs, you
can't have everything!

531
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:16,139
You've got to go like this.

532
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:20,227
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe,
catch a piggie by his toe,

533
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,479
my mother said to pick

534
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,524
this one right over here.

535
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:29,236
Wish for the one right
where my finger stopped.

536
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:31,863
Now, put that wish book away.

537
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:33,365
It's time to eat.

538
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:38,203
- I hear they
done opened up the old

539
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:42,207
Seminole Creeklands for
the white homesteader.

540
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,337
The only thing left is scrap
iron stills and tenant farming.

541
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:48,922
Listen to what I tell you, man.

542
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,383
If Roosevelt does
anything at all,

543
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:55,595
it will be for Northern
industry and not for we.

544
01:07:01,143 --> 01:07:03,020
- Supper's
ready, Mr. Snead.

545
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,147
We'll be taking our
places right up there.

546
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:07,941
- Wish books, saltwater negroes,

547
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:13,989
gold earrings, to sharpen
your vision?

548
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,203
- Oh, they spoil their children

549
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:22,456
with dreams, wishes, magic.

550
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:31,506
But then, they're the most
important members of the family,

551
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:34,342
the children and the old souls.

552
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:40,974
Come.

553
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:52,277
Gather up those
kids on Ibo Landing!

554
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:54,446
Bring them over here!

555
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,282
- Let's go and get them.

556
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,617
Come now, no!

557
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:19,971
- Hey, Yellow Mary, they
say you're a rich woman.

558
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:52,379
- My Ma said
she could feel me by her side.

559
01:08:55,757 --> 01:09:00,345
I remember the call of my
great-great-grandmother.

560
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:03,306
I remember the journey home.

561
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:07,686
I remember the long
walk to the graveyard,

562
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:12,107
to the house that I would be
born in, to the picnic site.

563
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:15,735
I remember, and I recall.

564
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:26,413
- It's 50 years since
slavery, Mr. Snead, but here,

565
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:30,458
we still give our
children names like

566
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:32,460
Myown and Iona, Unita,

567
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:37,716
Iadora, Euadora.

568
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:42,137
We even have a Pete
and Re-Pete.

569
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:47,726
Sometimes, these Islanders
name their babies

570
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:52,147
the day of the week or the
season in which they were born.

571
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:56,818
Not to mention,
everyone has several nicknames,

572
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,820
Goober, Boy Rat, Hail,

573
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,575
Harvest, Winter,
Pidgeon, Hardtime,

574
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:07,996
Fantee, Cudah, Ocra, Yono,

575
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:13,126
Cish, Alexmine, Jackiemine,

576
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,422
Jaspermine, Cornhouse,

577
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:22,594
Binah, Shango,

578
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,308
Obatala, Oya-yansa,

579
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:33,688
Yemonja,

580
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:37,317
Eshu Elegba.

581
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,749
- We're here today to show

582
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:39,504
our respect to our family elders

583
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:45,176
and to celebrate our family's
crossing to the mainland.

584
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:51,391
But we're also here today
to honor the old souls,

585
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,895
many, who from the
very, very beginning

586
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:00,275
of our creation
guided our journey

587
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,862
from one world to another.

588
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:10,744
We're here today because our
parent took we by the hand

589
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:15,790
and teach we to swim the current
surrounding these islands.

590
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:18,460
And they teach we to--

591
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:21,254
- I recollect
how we lived in the time

592
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:24,549
before freedom come,
in the old days.

593
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:31,681
They didn't keep good
records of our births,

594
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:35,769
our deaths, or the selling
of the slaves back then.

595
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:44,778
A male child might get took
from a mother and sold at birth.

596
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:48,365
Then years later,
the same person

597
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:52,285
might have to mate with
his own mother or sister

598
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:56,039
if they was brought
back together again,

599
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,166
so it was important
for the slave,

600
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,960
theyself, to keep
the family ties.

601
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:03,588
Just like the African Griot,

602
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:06,925
who would hold these
records in his head,

603
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:09,552
the old souls in each family

604
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:13,223
could recollect all the births,

605
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:15,725
deaths, marriage, and sale.

606
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:20,855
Those 18th century Africans,

607
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,818
the watchers, the keepers,

608
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:27,862
the ancestors.

609
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:44,087
- We Peazants, we
come from a long,

610
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:48,299
long line of creation and hope

611
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:54,597
begun by those
first-captured Africans.

612
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:59,811
And Nana, Nana, she
carried them with her,

613
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,356
four generations of Peazants.

614
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:07,902
And we, we must
carry them with us,

615
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:11,865
wherever we go.

616
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:55,033
- It was here they brought them.

617
01:14:56,493 --> 01:15:00,663
They took them out of the boats
right here where we stand.

618
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:09,714
Nobody remembers how
many of them it was,

619
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:14,135
but there was a good
few, according to my
great-grandmother.

620
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:18,848
She was a little,
little girl at the time.

621
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:29,108
The ship had just come
from the deep water.

622
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:33,613
It was a great big
old ship with sails.

623
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:38,535
The minute those Ibo
were brought ashore,

624
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:42,872
they just stopped and
took a look around.

625
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:49,712
Not saying a word, just
studying the place real good.

626
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:57,929
And they saw things
that day that you

627
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,766
and I don't have
the power to see.

628
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:09,774
Well, they saw just
about everything

629
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:14,195
that was to happen
around here that day.

630
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:19,158
The slavery time, the war my
grandmother always talks about,

631
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:23,454
those Ibo
didn't miss a thing.

632
01:16:23,705 --> 01:16:27,667
They even saw you and me,
standing here talking.

633
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:38,886
When they got through sizing
up the place real good

634
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:41,514
and seeing what was to come,

635
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:45,226
my grandmother said they turned,

636
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,107
all of them, and walked
back in the water,

637
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:55,820
every last man,
woman, and child.

638
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:00,366
Now you wouldn't think
they'd get very far

639
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:04,412
seeing as it was water
they were walking on.

640
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:07,040
Had all that iron upon them,

641
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:12,003
upon their ankles
and their wrists,

642
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:16,215
and fastened around their
neck like dog collars.

643
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,346
But chains didn't
stop those Ibo none.

644
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:25,767
They just kept walking, like
the water was solid ground.

645
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,525
When they got to where
the ship was,

646
01:17:34,776 --> 01:17:38,237
they didn't so much
as give it a look.

647
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:40,531
Just walked right past it

648
01:17:43,201 --> 01:17:45,578
because they was going home.

649
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:24,117
- I'm especially proud today

650
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:27,870
to bless the coming child of

651
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:30,206
our Eli and Eula Peazant.

652
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:34,919
Our first child that's
going to be born up north,

653
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:37,296
we child of the future.

654
01:18:39,716 --> 01:18:41,968
- Just counting stumps,
don't clear the field.

655
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,721
Let's eat.

656
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:45,198
- Once, I saw a pink satin case,

657
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:52,330
for jewelry, for rich
women in a shop window.

658
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,623
And it had a thing on the side

659
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:56,918
and you turned it
and music came out.

660
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:04,175
I couldn't afford
that case for myself,

661
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:08,596
and I didn't ask nobody to
buy it for me, you know?

662
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:14,060
But in my mind, I put
all those bad memories

663
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,230
in that case, and I
locked them there,

664
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:21,067
so that I could take them out

665
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:22,652
and look at them when
I'd feel like it,

666
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:25,112
and so I could study
them when I want to,

667
01:20:25,363 --> 01:20:27,073
and figure it out, you know?

668
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,992
But I didn't want
them inside of me.

669
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:32,787
I didn't want them inside of me.

670
01:20:34,372 --> 01:20:37,166
I don't let nothing in that case

671
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:41,754
or nobody outside that
case tell me who I am

672
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:44,340
or how I should feel about me.

673
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,771
- Bilal, Bilal!

674
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,277
Bilal Muhammed, come join we.

675
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:08,239
Come wash away your sins
in the blood of the lamb.

676
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,408
- Let him go, Deacon.

677
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:12,702
He's a saltwater negro.

678
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:14,328
He has no shame!

679
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:18,666
He's the master of
the sun and the moon.

680
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:23,588
- When I
leave here, you know,

681
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:27,300
I'll be heading up for
Canada, Nova Scotia.

682
01:21:29,844 --> 01:21:33,598
I like the sound of it,
you know, Nova Scotia.

683
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:36,142
- No-va Scotcha.

684
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:40,229
- Nova Scotia.

685
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:47,737
- I never had too much
trouble making a dollar.

686
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:50,781
Never needed nobody
to help me do that.

687
01:21:51,032 --> 01:21:52,575
I can't stand still.

688
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:55,745
Got to keep moving.

689
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:58,831
New faces, new places...

690
01:22:04,337 --> 01:22:07,006
Nova Scotia will be good to me.

691
01:24:25,478 --> 01:24:28,856
- Come closer together,
closer, come on.

692
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:31,484
- Mind now, Mr. Snead, there's

693
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:33,444
gators back off in these waters.

694
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:47,041
- I don't think about
those old days much lately,

695
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:51,962
but when I start to study them,

696
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,510
lots of things come back to me.

697
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:20,908
- You're a natural
fool, Haagar Peazant.

698
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,579
Nobody ever said
that the old souls

699
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:28,791
were living inside
those glass jars.

700
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:32,711
The bottle tree
reminds we of who

701
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:35,131
was here and who's gone on.

702
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:40,302
You study upon the
colors and the shapes.

703
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:43,931
You appreciate the bottle
tree each and every day,

704
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:46,934
as you appreciate
your loved ones.

705
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:51,397
- Mr. Snead!

706
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:57,695
- Can you take me to
the old man, Bilal?

707
01:25:57,945 --> 01:25:58,612
- That old heathen?

708
01:25:58,863 --> 01:26:00,364
He's not important.

709
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:02,074
- Is he family?

710
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:03,534
- Oh, I guess so.

711
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:09,748
Everybody back off on
these islands is family.

712
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:14,503
Unfortunately, so many like
Bilal are so backwards.

713
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:17,840
They believe everything
that happens is caused by

714
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,384
conjure, magic, or
their ancestors.

715
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:23,637
They don't leave nothing to God.

716
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:27,433
- Where we're headed Nana,
there'll be no need for trees

717
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:31,437
covered with glass
jars in our yard.

718
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,772
We'll have gardens
of fresh flowers,

719
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:36,483
vegetables for the dinner table.

720
01:26:36,734 --> 01:26:38,986
Where we're headed
Nana, there'll be

721
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:42,114
no need for an
old woman's magic.

722
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,065
- Look, look up!

723
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:20,486
And remember Ibo Landing!

724
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:23,364
Hold!

725
01:27:43,092 --> 01:27:46,220
- Can't complain none about
them horseflies worrying you.

726
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,639
Stop putting that
lard on your head.

727
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:55,271
- The Lord will
carry us through, Nana.

728
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:56,814
Trust in Jesus.

729
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:02,611
Nana, we don't need no charms
of dried roots and flowers.

730
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:11,287
- When I was a child,
my mother cut this

731
01:28:11,537 --> 01:28:15,416
from her hair before she
was sold away from we.

732
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:21,672
Now, I'm adding my own hair.

733
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:30,139
There must be a
bond, a connection,

734
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:34,310
between those who go North
and those who remain,

735
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:40,607
between us who are here and
those who are across the sea.

736
01:28:40,858 --> 01:28:41,900
A connection!

737
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:48,991
We are as two
people in one body,

738
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:54,038
the last of the old

739
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:57,791
and the first of the new.

740
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:03,172
We will always live
this double life,

741
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:06,508
you know, because
we're from the sea.

742
01:29:07,468 --> 01:29:09,303
We came here in chains,

743
01:29:11,221 --> 01:29:12,765
and we must survive.

744
01:29:14,308 --> 01:29:16,101
We must survive!

745
01:29:16,352 --> 01:29:18,937
There's saltwater in we blood.

746
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:55,641
- Mister,
for many years,

747
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:59,019
I've not spoken those
words with no one.

748
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:01,814
What I remember,
I'll tell you in

749
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:05,734
this language that I
learned to speak here.

750
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:12,783
I come here on a ship
called The Wanderer.

751
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:14,576
I come with the Ibo.

752
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:21,625
Some say the Ibo flew
back home to Africa.

753
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:24,628
Some say they all joined hands

754
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:27,589
and walked on top of the water.

755
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:31,385
But, Mister, I was there.

756
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:36,765
Those Ibo, men, women, and
children, a hundred or more,

757
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:39,893
shackled in iron,
when they go down

758
01:30:40,978 --> 01:30:44,273
in that water, they
never came back up.

759
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:48,652
Ain't nobody can walk on water.

760
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:57,161
- We'll be fine, Nana.

761
01:30:57,411 --> 01:31:00,038
Now, Nana, don't
you go worrying.

762
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:02,958
We're going to be just fine.

763
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,461
Mind now, Nana Peazant.

764
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,504
Don't go work yourself up.

765
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:10,507
It's too hot out
here for no mess.

766
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:14,970
Get a hold of yourself, Viola!

767
01:31:16,555 --> 01:31:20,601
- I remember what my father
teach me before he passed on.

768
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:24,146
It was the same as
his father teach

769
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,857
him on the day he become a man.

770
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:32,196
He said, "Women are
the sweetness of life.

771
01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:39,661
"They're sweet to the eye
because they're beautiful.

772
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:42,664
"They're sweet to
the ears because of

773
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:46,251
"their lovely voice
and the way they sing.

774
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:56,094
"Woman is the
sweetness of life,"

775
01:31:57,054 --> 01:31:59,306
and that's what I remember.

776
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:54,695
- I've been on my own
since I was a little girl.

777
01:32:58,448 --> 01:33:01,743
I've been on my own
for such a long time,

778
01:33:01,994 --> 01:33:05,664
I thought I wanted
it to be that way.

779
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:09,334
- Lord knows, you've
done worked hard, gal.

780
01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:14,840
- You know, I'm not like
the other women here,

781
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,800
but I need to know
that I can come

782
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:19,761
and hold onto what I come from.

783
01:33:21,013 --> 01:33:23,974
I need to know that
people here know my name.

784
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:26,893
I'm Yellow Mary Peazant!

785
01:33:27,144 --> 01:33:30,272
And I'm a proud woman,
not a hard woman.

786
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:37,404
I want to stay.

787
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:41,325
I want to stay with you here.

788
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:46,788
- Oh, now how's
she going to come

789
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:50,208
and put her shame
upon Mother Peazant?

790
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:53,420
- I can't understand...

791
01:33:56,882 --> 01:33:58,842
how me and Peazant
put you children

792
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:02,346
here on Earth to fight
among yourselves.

793
01:34:02,596 --> 01:34:05,849
How you can leave
this soil, this soil.

794
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:12,064
The sweat of our love,
it's here in this soil.

795
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:19,404
I love you
'cause you're mine.

796
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:25,077
You're the fruit of an
ancient tree.

797
01:34:25,327 --> 01:34:26,995
- Hush, hush, hush!

798
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:33,251
Hush, all of you.

799
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:37,631
Some of us aren't forgetting
how Yellow Mary sent the money

800
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:40,967
to get Cousin Jake out
of jail last spring.

801
01:34:41,218 --> 01:34:45,222
- Now, Nana, we aren't talking
about no Cousin Jake here.

802
01:34:45,472 --> 01:34:49,226
A dog don't get mad
'cause you say he's a dog.

803
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:53,980
- Say it!

804
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:58,443
- If you're so
ashamed of Yellow Mary

805
01:34:58,694 --> 01:35:02,656
'cause she got ruined,
what do you say about me?

806
01:35:03,657 --> 01:35:04,950
I'm ruined too?

807
01:35:06,785 --> 01:35:10,664
- Whatever's to be said,
just say it now, Eula!

808
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:16,294
- As far as this
place is concerned,

809
01:35:18,296 --> 01:35:20,465
we never was a pure woman.

810
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:27,931
Deep inside, we believed
that they ruined our mothers

811
01:35:28,181 --> 01:35:32,102
and their mothers who
had come before them,

812
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:35,564
and we live our lives
always expecting the worst

813
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:39,151
'cause we feel we don't
deserve no better.

814
01:35:44,531 --> 01:35:47,576
Deep inside, we
believe that even God

815
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:51,955
can't heal the
wounds of our past

816
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:55,041
or protect us from the world

817
01:35:55,292 --> 01:35:57,627
that put shackles on our feet.

818
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:04,301
- My God loves me and protects
me and watches over me.

819
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:08,472
- Even though you're
going up north,

820
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:13,101
you all think about
being ruined, too.

821
01:36:14,478 --> 01:36:18,106
You think you can cross
over to the mainland

822
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:20,233
and run away from it?

823
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:24,154
You're going to be sorry,
sorry if you don't change

824
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:28,241
your way of thinking before
you leave this place.

825
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,805
If you love yourselves,

826
01:36:52,057 --> 01:36:53,809
then love Yellow Mary,

827
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:59,773
because she's a part of you,

828
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:04,194
just like we're a
part of our mothers.

829
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:12,202
A lot of us are
going through things

830
01:37:12,452 --> 01:37:15,413
you feel you can't
handle all alone.

831
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:24,381
There's going to be all kinds
of roads to take in life.

832
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:30,011
Let's not be afraid
to take them.

833
01:37:31,263 --> 01:37:34,474
We deserve them because
we're all good women.

834
01:37:43,692 --> 01:37:46,069
Do you understand who we are

835
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:50,240
and what we have become?

836
01:37:52,325 --> 01:37:55,704
We're the daughters
of those old dusty

837
01:37:55,954 --> 01:37:58,790
things Nana carries
in her tin can.

838
01:38:02,961 --> 01:38:06,131
We carry too many
scars from the past.

839
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,178
Our past owns us.

840
01:38:17,517 --> 01:38:21,062
We wear our scars like
armor for protection.

841
01:38:24,524 --> 01:38:26,651
Thick, hard, ugly scars that

842
01:38:28,445 --> 01:38:32,449
no one can pass through
to ever hurt us again.

843
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:39,831
Let's live our
lives without living

844
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:42,250
in the fold of old wounds.

845
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:49,109
- Shad, how can
we plant in this dust?

846
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:53,530
- We plant 'em each and every
year, or we're finished.

847
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:09,004
- My life is almost over,

848
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:12,549
and yours is just starting.

849
01:40:13,591 --> 01:40:15,802
And I'm not going
to live long enough

850
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:19,597
to see what becomes of
all you free Negroes.

851
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:24,853
- We're gonna
be watching from heaven, Nana.

852
01:40:25,103 --> 01:40:29,190
- No, I'm not going to be
watching from no heaven

853
01:40:29,441 --> 01:40:33,611
while there's still soil
here for me for planting.

854
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:42,495
We've done took old Gods

855
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:48,626
and given them new names.

856
01:41:02,098 --> 01:41:04,976
This hand, it's
from me, from them,

857
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:08,730
from us.

858
01:41:10,065 --> 01:41:12,233
Same soul as you all have.

859
01:41:15,862 --> 01:41:19,365
Come children, kiss
this hand full of me.

860
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:23,369
- Lord, have mercy, have mercy.

861
01:41:32,754 --> 01:41:34,672
- Take my hand.

862
01:41:36,049 --> 01:41:39,344
I'm the one that can
give you strength.

863
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,900
Take me wherever you go.

864
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:56,361
I'm your strength.

865
01:42:06,496 --> 01:42:07,580
Take my hand.

866
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:10,416
Take me wherever you go.

867
01:42:13,753 --> 01:42:15,338
I'm your strength.

868
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:20,093
Wherever you go.

869
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:24,472
- Old folks are supposed to die!

870
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:25,723
It ain't right!

871
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:30,937
They're supposed to
die and go to heaven!

872
01:42:31,187 --> 01:42:34,482
It ain't right!

873
01:42:40,655 --> 01:42:43,783
It ain't right!

874
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:51,249
- Hoodoo!

875
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:52,250
Hoodoo!

876
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:55,211
Hoodoo!

877
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:56,421
Hoodoo mess!

878
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:03,511
Ain't no roots and herbs
going to change nothing.

879
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:06,389
Don't go and spoil everything.

880
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:10,727
Old Used-To-Do-It-This-Way
don't help none today!

881
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:37,795
- Come, come child, I
love you 'cause you're mine!

882
01:43:43,676 --> 01:43:45,762
- Mama, please!

883
01:44:11,663 --> 01:44:14,499
- Look at that, see?

884
01:45:24,902 --> 01:45:28,364
In this quiet place,
simple folk kneel down

885
01:45:30,116 --> 01:45:32,994
and catch a glimpse
of the eternal.

886
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:41,419
Morning would begin a new life

887
01:45:42,962 --> 01:45:44,797
for my children and me.

888
01:45:47,175 --> 01:45:49,427
They would carry my spirit.

889
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:53,890
I would remain here
with the old souls.

890
01:46:33,846 --> 01:46:34,847
- Iona, Iona!

891
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:41,771
Iona!

892
01:47:30,987 --> 01:47:33,698
- And
so, on the 19th day

893
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:35,283
of August, 1902,

894
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:40,079
they left these islands.

895
01:47:41,873 --> 01:47:45,835
And set out for the North,
having said farewell,

896
01:47:47,628 --> 01:47:50,631
perhaps, never to see us again.

897
01:48:16,949 --> 01:48:21,120
My Momma and Daddy stayed
behind with Yellow Mary.

898
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:25,708
Some say Eli got
himself all involved

899
01:48:27,043 --> 01:48:29,295
with the anti-lynching issue.

900
01:48:32,048 --> 01:48:36,177
Some say Eula saw too much
of herself in Nana Peazant

901
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:39,972
and wanted her children
born on this island.

902
01:48:42,475 --> 01:48:45,686
They say Mama was
always peculiar,

903
01:48:45,937 --> 01:48:49,190
and Nana's roots and
herbs set her off.

904
01:48:53,486 --> 01:48:57,657
All I know is, I was born
here before Nana passed on.

905
01:49:03,162 --> 01:49:05,915
We remained behind,
growing older,

906
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,086
wiser, stronger.
