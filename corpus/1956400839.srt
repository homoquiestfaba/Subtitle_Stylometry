00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:36,476
Drea, did you see that?

3
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:39,812
'Drea!'

4
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:41,379
What is it?

5
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:43,581
I think
it was an alien spaceship.

6
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,050
Don't be weird, Phillip.

7
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:47,952
I'm not being weird.
Come down here and see.

8
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:50,621
'It was headed
towards the park.'

9
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:54,526
It was probably just like
a plane flying low or something.

10
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,698
Oh, I think there may be two.

11
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:38,071
What the?

12
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:44,104
Hello?

13
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:26,905
Drea!

14
00:04:26,907 --> 00:04:28,907
Turn that thing down right now.

15
00:04:40,753 --> 00:04:42,386
Uncle Lou.

16
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:43,955
Hey, Phillip. Hi.

17
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:46,323
Did the UFO pass by your office
last night?

18
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,825
UFO?

19
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:49,561
Unidentified Flying Object?

20
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:52,998
Y-yeah, I-I know what UFO means.

21
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,434
You do know
aliens don't exist, right?

22
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:58,436
Yes, they do. And they're here.

23
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:00,241
- Really?
- Yeah. Look.

24
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:04,977
The UFO started on its way
to the park.

25
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,212
Well, actually,
I think there's two of them.

26
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:10,047
Two? What, two little green guys
or, uh, two ships?

27
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:11,616
Were they butt-naked?

28
00:05:11,618 --> 00:05:13,719
Uh, you know, if they're
butt-naked, it's quite funny.

29
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:16,821
I.. Phillip,
I'm just messing with you, man.

30
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:19,726
Phillip, I'm just messing.
Phillip.

31
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:30,402
Drea!

32
00:05:30,404 --> 00:05:32,770
Come on, you gotta keep
the music down in the mornings.

33
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:35,106
- I mean, I work night shifts...
- Yup, got it.

34
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:37,008
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Everything's fine.

35
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,044
- I just gotta get to work.
- Drea..

36
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,719
What's wrong?

37
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,020
I thought I got into Leroy,
but I didn't, so..

38
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:51,489
- Aw, geez.
- I got waitlisted again.

39
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:53,357
So I thought this is it.

40
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,393
But, nope, not happening, so..

41
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:59,765
Hey. Who needs those
fancy colleges anyways, eh?

42
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,965
I mean,
I-I didn't go to any college.

43
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:04,802
Yeah. You always say that.

44
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:07,205
You know,
I'm only trying to help you.

45
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:09,407
- 'Sometimes you get so...'
- Please, Uncle Lewis.

46
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,376
I'm not in the mood
to argue with you right now.

47
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:13,010
I really gotta get to work.

48
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:16,314
I'll try again next year,
it'll be fine. Please.

49
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:19,885
Okay, before you go to work,
can I give you some advice?

50
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:22,888
You can get
into any college you want.

51
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,924
I know you wanna go to Leroy
'cause your mom went there.

52
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:28,994
No. Nope, nope, that is not
the only reason I want...

53
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:31,063
Let me finish, alright?

54
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:33,868
Your mom was very smart,
you are very smart.

55
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,967
And, you know, she was able
to get a scholarship

56
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,236
to go to Leroy and you weren't.

57
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:41,373
Sometimes
smart just is not enough.

58
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:45,212
Sometimes it's like, you know,
people you know in the world.

59
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:49,049
Right.

60
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:54,287
Okay, well,
thanks for the pep talk.

61
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,724
- You can drive safe.
- Thanks.

62
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:00,926
Please move back, officer.

63
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:02,960
I don't wanna roll over
your foot.

64
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:05,729
- Step away from the car.
- Yeah. That.

65
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:07,165
Whatever you guys say.

66
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,042
Crites.

67
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:07,878
'Hey,
where did you learn to do that?'

68
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,980
Uh, I just, um

69
00:10:09,982 --> 00:10:12,617
just kinda figured it out,
I guess.

70
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:15,720
Plus, we have the best blades
in the business.

71
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:18,690
- Best blades, huh?
- Oh, and YouTube videos.

72
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:21,859
Oh. You know,
I got my own YouTube channel.

73
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:24,495
- Nice.
- OutdoorDougie.com.

74
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:27,665
That's cool. I'll try
to check it out sometime.

75
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,337
I just got some new merch
for my online store.

76
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:34,906
OutdoorDougie stress ball.

77
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:38,877
- Hey, Drea.
- Hey.

78
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,512
I need you to deliver this.

79
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,946
What happened to Kevin?

80
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:44,349
He took off
with a delivery last night

81
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,950
and I never heard from him.

82
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:48,353
Sounds like Kevin.

83
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:51,325
Hey, I thought you might enjoy
this delivery, Drea.

84
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:55,225
It's your dream place.

85
00:10:55,227 --> 00:10:56,661
Yeah, where is that?

86
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:08,142
Oh, boy.

87
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:10,141
Drea!

88
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:12,543
- Hi, Shawn.
- Wow!

89
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:15,312
Uh, you're finally taking me up
on that personalized tour?

90
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:17,715
We can get in a-any building
on campus you want.

91
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:20,851
Oh, wow, I mean, I'd love to,
but I'm just here to make

92
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:24,455
a delivery and then I gotta
head back to work, so, bummer.

93
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:26,157
Yeah. Ha-ha.

94
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,926
I don't have to sign in, do I?

95
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:32,162
Oh. Um, uh, no, no, it's fine.

96
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:33,665
Yeah. I know you. You..

97
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,234
Oh, hey, did you, uh,
get a chance

98
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:38,668
to listen to that cassette?

99
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,672
Oh. Yes, I love it.

100
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:43,106
Uh, uh, I don't know how
it's not in my player right now.

101
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:45,244
That's crazy. I've been..

102
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:48,615
Got it!

103
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:02,561
Right?

104
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:05,430
You, you're hittin' it.
You're really hittin' it.

105
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:07,331
You're really hitting
those notes.

106
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,133
I can't believe
you really love it. I mean..

107
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:11,335
You know,
I wrote all those pieces myself.

108
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:14,839
Wow! Yeah, it-it,
it is something.

109
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:16,209
Do you wanna hear it live?

110
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:19,176
- I'm sorry, what?
- Yeah!

111
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:22,880
I always come prepared.

112
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:24,416
Wow! Okay.

113
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:26,984
You know, I'm, I'm good
with this one right here.

114
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:29,620
I, I gotta go
drop this food off, though.

115
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:32,422
Like, I don't wanna keep
the customer waiting, so..

116
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:33,724
- Drive safe now, alright?
- Alright, thanks.

117
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:35,158
- Have a great one.
- You, too.

118
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,729
- Bye.
- Bye.

119
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,403
Oh, my God.

120
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:01,321
Hi, mommy.

121
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,342
What is this?

122
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,544
Hall?

123
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,380
Leroy Hall?

124
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:31,749
♪ Leroy University
we stand tall ♪

125
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:34,185
♪ Leroy University
won't let fall ♪

126
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:38,922
♪ There's no adversity that
we can't handle and that's ♪♪

127
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:40,624
And that's the Leroy way.

128
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:43,460
- Oh, my God.
- Ah, don't be embarrassed.

129
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:46,433
That was a lovely rendition
of the "Leroy Fight Song."

130
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:48,266
Oh..

131
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:51,234
- Hello.
- Hey.

132
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:54,940
- Hi. Okay, uh, sorry.
- Yeah.

133
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:56,606
Uh, I have some sushi here for...

134
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:58,409
- Gregory Sax.
- Yeah, that's you.

135
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:00,043
I believe you're looking for me.

136
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:03,114
- I've been looking for you.
- You take card, right?

137
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:04,617
No.

138
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:07,417
Okay. Cash?

139
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:09,253
Mm-hmm, that's all we take.

140
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:10,654
Okay, well,
then if you come with me

141
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:12,255
I can get some cash from inside
and we can...

142
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:14,325
I'd love to come with you.

143
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:15,796
Okay. Just this way.

144
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:19,363
You know, my mom actually
went to this school.

145
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:20,864
- Really?
- Yeah, but..

146
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,066
Only for one semester 'cause

147
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,401
then she got pregnant with me.

148
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:26,403
So I guess you can kinda say
I ruined her plans.

149
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:29,542
Oh, come on. I'm sure
you didn't ruin anything.

150
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,379
Yeah, I'm just messing.

151
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:39,283
Well, she should come
back and finish up, though.

152
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:42,987
I saw older people in a few
of my classes last year, so..

153
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:44,221
She'll be fine.

154
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,790
She died two years ago, so..

155
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:47,358
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no, no, no.

156
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,593
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- It's fine.

157
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:50,027
I'm gonna go to school here
one day.

158
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:52,964
It's just, I just got
my second rejection letter.

159
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:56,334
But you know what they say,
third time's the charm.

160
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:57,701
- Yeah, I bet it will be.
- Sorry.

161
00:14:57,703 --> 00:14:59,571
Uh, sorry, we got
a few more flights to go

162
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:01,973
and then I'm sure somebody's
gonna have cash for you, so..

163
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:03,574
Oh, yeah, for sure, no worries.

164
00:15:07,414 --> 00:15:09,480
Hey. What do you think, Mandy?

165
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:12,182
Mm, yeah, looks good.

166
00:15:12,184 --> 00:15:14,320
You didn't even look at it.

167
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:19,690
Wait, what is this font?

168
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:22,426
- I thought you liked it.
- Hey, Mandy!

169
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:24,963
You got any cash for, um..

170
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,564
I'm sorry,
what was your name, again?

171
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:30,033
- 'It's, uh..'
- Drea.

172
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:33,037
Oh. What, you've ordered
from this place before or...

173
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,242
- No.
- That'll be, uh, 16.40.

174
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:39,844
Okay. Great.

175
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:42,413
Well, you two can, um,
do your little..

176
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:44,447
You do have cash on you, right?

177
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:48,521
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Thank you.

178
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:50,691
Yeah.

179
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:59,229
Geez, I feel like I haven't
seen you in a long time.

180
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,868
So I'm just gonna give a..

181
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:06,470
- Okay.
- Yeah.

182
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:09,407
Well, you got into
our dream school and I didn't.

183
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:12,409
So there's that.

184
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:16,413
- Are you and, like..
- Oh, yeah. We're..

185
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:18,716
- Oh. Cool.
- Yeah.

186
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:20,017
Yeah, it's cool.

187
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:24,022
Um, did you hear back about
your admissions for this year?

188
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,224
Yeah, i-it's a no for me, again.

189
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:29,661
- So..
- Well..

190
00:16:29,663 --> 00:16:31,229
The head
of the history department

191
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,398
is looking to fill
a job position.

192
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,133
You-you think getting a job here

193
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:36,901
would really help me
with admissions?

194
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:39,273
Yeah. Totally.

195
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:40,907
Here.

196
00:16:42,107 --> 00:16:44,407
Her name is Professor Lacy.

197
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:45,777
You'd have to start tomorrow,
though.

198
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,545
That's perfect.
I'm off tomorrow. Let's..

199
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:49,113
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

200
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:50,848
Cool.

201
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,149
I'll give her a call
and let her know

202
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:55,019
that she'll see you tomorrow.

203
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:59,824
Thanks, Mandy. This is really,
really, really nice of you.

204
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:00,992
Oh, um..

205
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:03,460
I appreciate it
more than you know, like..

206
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:06,533
Yeah, the, um, uh,
the job, it's..

207
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,901
Well, it's babysitting her kids.
It's..

208
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:12,035
Babysitting?

209
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:13,638
- Yeah, but Professor Lace...
- Yeah, no.

210
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,705
I'm, I'm too old
to be babysitting.

211
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:17,609
What, is this a joke?

212
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:20,878
She's on
the board of admissions, though.

213
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,985
She could seriously help you.
It's all about who you know.

214
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:28,054
Thanks.

215
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,116
'And we've Fred from New Jersey.
Fred, you're on the line.'

216
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:33,716
'Uh, hey.
I'm a big fan of the show.'

217
00:18:33,718 --> 00:18:35,889
'Yeah, listen,
I-I-I've been getting..'

218
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:40,127
Hey, kiddo. Time for bed.

219
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:49,903
Hey.

220
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:54,138
It's fine, I like this spot.

221
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,641
I know,
but this is Uncle Lewis' favorite chair

222
00:18:57,643 --> 00:18:59,343
and I don't want him
yelling at me about it.

223
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:02,413
So please, just go to your room.

224
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:04,618
Can you get me mom's blanket?

225
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:08,955
Yeah.

226
00:19:21,935 --> 00:19:23,870
'Goodnight, weirdo.'

227
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:22,895
Oh. What is that?

228
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:28,565
Oh, my! What is that?

229
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:34,608
I can't believe I'm seeing this.

230
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:37,340
Wow, amazing!

231
00:20:39,713 --> 00:20:42,015
Aren't you a beautiful bird?

232
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:43,950
Ah..

233
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:47,053
Oh.

234
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:00,863
- 'Did you read this, um..'
- 'Mm?'

235
00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:04,036
- 'This thing here about, uh..'
- 'About what?'

236
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:10,176
What the hell happened to you,
Bob?

237
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:13,778
I don't wanna talk about it.

238
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,548
No disrespect, Bob,
but you kind of stink.

239
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,317
My apologies.

240
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,618
I didn't have a napkin on me

241
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,386
and I-I didn't wanna ruin
my uniform.

242
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:25,222
On the plus side,
I read somewhere that, uh

243
00:21:25,224 --> 00:21:28,093
it's a sign of good luck
if a bird poops on you.

244
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:32,329
- Really?
- That's what I read.

245
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:33,600
Oh..

246
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:37,868
Well, then, things are
looking up for me for a change.

247
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,739
Still, you should shower.

248
00:21:42,275 --> 00:21:43,342
Copy that.

249
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:59,758
Ooh, I wonder if that's
my little porcupine friend.

250
00:22:11,737 --> 00:22:13,340
Daryl?

251
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:19,945
Daryl the porcupine, is that you
out there, little buddy?

252
00:22:25,484 --> 00:22:26,820
No, sir.

253
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,453
What the hell is that?

254
00:23:36,455 --> 00:23:38,390
What the hell is that?

255
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,692
Oh, my God!

256
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:52,302
Well, guys, that was
my babysitting 101 video.

257
00:23:52,304 --> 00:23:56,173
Just remember, your main job
is to take care of those kids.

258
00:23:56,175 --> 00:23:58,841
So if you're constantly
anticipating potential problems

259
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:00,377
you'll always be prepared.

260
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:03,080
Please, don't forget to have fun
and subscribe to my channel.

261
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:05,251
It's easy now. Got it.

262
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,495
Come on, we gotta go. I am late.

263
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,562
What?

264
00:24:19,564 --> 00:24:23,033
Oh. Sorry,
I was listening to a podcast.

265
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:25,034
God. Was it about aliens again?

266
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:26,403
Yeah. What if it was?

267
00:24:26,405 --> 00:24:29,372
Okay, loser,
well, please hurry up

268
00:24:29,374 --> 00:24:31,809
because I have to go babysit.
We discussed this.

269
00:24:31,811 --> 00:24:34,177
Yeah, but you agreed to babysit,
not me.

270
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:37,214
Well, you know, the Lacys
do have a really big house.

271
00:24:37,216 --> 00:24:39,116
Maybe you could, like, bring
your telescope or whatever.

272
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:41,985
'Or, you know, stay here,
listen to your podcast.'

273
00:24:41,987 --> 00:24:43,986
Wait. Lacy?

274
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:46,890
- Like, like, Trissy Lacy?
- Yeah.

275
00:24:46,892 --> 00:24:48,859
You're-you're babysitting
Trissy Lacy.

276
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:50,095
I am.

277
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:55,064
Oh, my gosh. My-my hair,
is my hair messed up?

278
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:56,800
Phillip,
will you please hurry up?

279
00:24:56,802 --> 00:24:59,337
Yeah, I know.

280
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:01,304
- What's taking you so long?
- Nothing, nothing.

281
00:25:01,306 --> 00:25:02,907
Oh, my gosh.
Did you fix your hair?

282
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:04,175
- Yes.
- You still got a little...

283
00:25:04,177 --> 00:25:05,509
- Don't. Don't touch it.
- Okay, fine, fine.

284
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:07,043
- Thank you.
- What were you doing?

285
00:25:07,045 --> 00:25:08,646
Like, putting cologne on
in the car or something?

286
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:10,414
Don't-don't worry about
what I was doing.

287
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:13,984
Let me see. You look cool.

288
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:16,719
The door's open.

289
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:17,987
I love you.

290
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:21,995
Be good
and do what Drea says, okay?

291
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:25,227
- Hi, Drea.
- Hi, Professor Lacy.

292
00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:27,097
You're a lifesaver.
Thank you for babysitting.

293
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,499
- 'On such short notice.'
- 'Yes, of course.'

294
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:30,167
Okay,
so the low-down on my kids.

295
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:32,469
Trissy, smart, but sometimes
too smart for her own good.

296
00:25:32,471 --> 00:25:35,038
So be prepared.
I gave Jake your number.

297
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,175
He insists
on only communicating by text.

298
00:25:38,177 --> 00:25:40,744
I know, it's weird,
I was hoping it was just a phase

299
00:25:40,746 --> 00:25:42,079
but maybe that's just how

300
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:43,813
the next generation
communicate, huh?

301
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:45,782
Who knows?

302
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:47,984
Okay, taxi's here, gotta go.

303
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:50,156
Thank you again so much, Drea.

304
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,193
Actually, I, um..

305
00:26:04,937 --> 00:26:06,438
Hi.

306
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:22,355
Anybody know any good jokes?

307
00:26:24,523 --> 00:26:25,555
I've got one.

308
00:26:25,557 --> 00:26:28,625
What does sushi A
say to sushi B?

309
00:26:28,627 --> 00:26:29,926
Wasabi!

310
00:26:29,928 --> 00:26:32,364
Like, what's up, B? You know?

311
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:42,140
Okay, um, uh,
anybody wanna play a card game?

312
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:44,974
A card game?

313
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:47,280
What is this, 1986?

314
00:26:48,213 --> 00:26:51,451
Yeah, what is this, 1986?

315
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,324
Okay. No card games,
no jokes, um..

316
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:04,061
How about we watch a movie?
Everybody loves movies, right?

317
00:27:04,063 --> 00:27:06,096
We could do a movie night,
order pizza.

318
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:09,233
Do you like scary movies?
I love scary movies.

319
00:27:09,235 --> 00:27:11,437
No, they're too violent.

320
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:16,376
Right.

321
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,353
Oh, my God, Jake.
This meme is so funny.

322
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:34,190
Ooh, another text coming in
from Jake.

323
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:36,926
Oh. You wanna go to the park?

324
00:27:36,928 --> 00:27:38,462
That's a great idea!

325
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:41,432
Actually, that idea
doesn't sound half bad.

326
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:45,034
I mean, I can pack us a picnic.

327
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:48,039
Nice. What do you think?
Picnic, yes?

328
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,005
Well, yeah,
if, uh, Trissy wants to do that

329
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:51,710
a picnic sounds great.

330
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:55,611
Should we reconfirm here
with Jake?

331
00:27:55,613 --> 00:27:59,215
Yeah? Ah, blow it up?
No, put the pin back in.

332
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:02,619
It's not time.
Okay. Let's do this.

333
00:28:08,628 --> 00:28:11,896
I can't believe all the
plant life we've seen so far.

334
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,067
Can anyone else believe it?

335
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:19,101
- No, I-I can't believe it.
- Me either.

336
00:28:19,103 --> 00:28:21,370
Jake, look! Cloudberries.

337
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:23,340
They have very distinct lobes.

338
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:25,510
Do you see the distinct lobes,
Jake?

339
00:28:28,046 --> 00:28:30,414
Licorice fern.

340
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:33,149
Guys, come on, check this out!

341
00:28:33,151 --> 00:28:35,651
Wow, this cannot be real.

342
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:37,222
Someone pinch me.

343
00:28:42,227 --> 00:28:44,764
She sure is, uh, talkative.

344
00:28:47,132 --> 00:28:49,736
Hey. What you thinking about?

345
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:53,035
Nothing.

346
00:28:53,037 --> 00:28:55,173
You nervous
about talking to her?

347
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:58,975
I don't know. I guess. I just..

348
00:28:58,977 --> 00:29:00,511
I just feel like an idiot
every time

349
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:02,682
I think of something
to say to her.

350
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:05,517
You're not an idiot.

351
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,255
More of a moron, really.

352
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:12,455
- Wow, thanks.
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

353
00:29:12,457 --> 00:29:14,593
Come on, don't be nervous.

354
00:29:24,636 --> 00:29:26,072
What was that?

355
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:32,376
I think it's some wildlife.

356
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:33,579
Come on.

357
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:37,249
Hey, kids, wait up! Uh..

358
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:51,730
What is that?

359
00:29:56,134 --> 00:29:59,638
I think it's some sort of animal
or something.

360
00:30:05,142 --> 00:30:07,577
Hey! Don't get too close
to that thing.

361
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:11,184
Did you get your, you know,
rabies shot?

362
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:14,516
We have our shots.

363
00:30:14,518 --> 00:30:17,390
- Don't worry so much.
- Okay..

364
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:21,958
Hi.

365
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:27,930
Aw.. She's so cute.

366
00:30:27,932 --> 00:30:30,167
- Really?
- Yeah.

367
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:31,936
Here. Come take a look.

368
00:30:31,938 --> 00:30:33,206
Actu..

369
00:30:36,874 --> 00:30:38,210
See?

370
00:30:39,244 --> 00:30:42,178
What do you think it is?

371
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,282
I don't really know, which
is kind of troubling to me.

372
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:48,521
What if it was an alien?

373
00:30:52,457 --> 00:30:54,293
'That would be cool.'

374
00:30:56,861 --> 00:30:59,398
Wait-wait a second.
I think she's hurt.

375
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:03,966
Drea, what do we do?

376
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:06,302
Just leave it there.

377
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:09,005
Leave it there?
We're not leaving her there.

378
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:11,809
Okay, Trissy.
That's-that's a wild animal.

379
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:13,475
You don't take
wild animals home.

380
00:31:13,477 --> 00:31:15,245
You don't know
where that thing has been.

381
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:18,749
But she's cute, and-and
she really needs our help.

382
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,984
C-come on, please.

383
00:31:20,986 --> 00:31:22,487
Please, Drea.

384
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,891
Okay.

385
00:31:27,893 --> 00:31:30,426
You know what, actually, let's
take her to the park ranger.

386
00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:31,594
They'll know what to do with her

387
00:31:31,596 --> 00:31:33,362
and then maybe they can, like

388
00:31:33,364 --> 00:31:35,300
donate her to a zoo.

389
00:31:37,602 --> 00:31:39,804
Uh, be careful, guys. She'll..

390
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:47,546
Okay. She's cute, right?

391
00:31:49,015 --> 00:31:50,414
Sure.

392
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:52,552
'Come on, guys.
Let's get out of here.'

393
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:06,330
Aunt Dee,
you still haven't told me

394
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:08,165
how long
you're gonna be gone for.

395
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:11,434
Oh, not too long, I don't think.

396
00:32:11,436 --> 00:32:13,669
'Which one needs
the insulin shot?'

397
00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:17,507
- Little Herrick.
- 'And which one's Herrick?'

398
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:21,512
Wrote it all down for you,
and there's pictures.

399
00:32:21,514 --> 00:32:23,280
Okay.

400
00:32:23,282 --> 00:32:25,013
Oh, you need any help?
That looks heavy.

401
00:32:25,015 --> 00:32:27,917
Got it.

402
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,253
Oh, if you don't hear from me
for a little while

403
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:32,656
just know I'm okay.

404
00:32:32,658 --> 00:32:34,392
- 'Okay?'
- Okay.

405
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:36,861
Bye, babies.

406
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:40,999
Have fun with your friends.

407
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:48,905
Here we go.

408
00:32:48,907 --> 00:32:50,474
Come on, guys.

409
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:52,841
Oh, Phillip, how's she doing?

410
00:32:52,843 --> 00:32:54,144
Oh, um..

411
00:32:55,547 --> 00:32:59,183
Yeah, she-she seems fine,
I guess.

412
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,484
Thanks for checking.
Come on, Jake!

413
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:04,053
No, no problem.

414
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:14,566
Hello?

415
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:20,005
Maybe no one's here.

416
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:26,011
Hello? Is anyone inside?

417
00:33:27,312 --> 00:33:29,512
Please,
we have an injured animal.

418
00:33:29,514 --> 00:33:32,815
'A really weird-looking animal
that we've never seen before.'

419
00:33:32,817 --> 00:33:35,953
'Someone, open the door!'

420
00:33:35,955 --> 00:33:38,120
'Can you help us out, please?'

421
00:34:05,816 --> 00:34:06,951
So weird.

422
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:09,519
Hey, um, Phillip, is she okay?

423
00:34:09,521 --> 00:34:12,425
Is she doing something weird?

424
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:21,263
Looks like she's
sniffing at something.

425
00:34:21,265 --> 00:34:22,664
Sniffing?

426
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:25,300
Oh, she is not happy.

427
00:34:25,302 --> 00:34:27,504
Yeah, maybe we should just
take it to a vet or something.

428
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:31,644
Alright.

429
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:14,783
So Shawn is still giving you
these mix-tapes, huh?

430
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:17,120
Hey, can you roll down
your window for a sec?

431
00:35:17,122 --> 00:35:18,657
Sure. Why?

432
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:24,561
That's why.

433
00:35:24,563 --> 00:35:27,166
- That was rude.
- You like bagpipe music?

434
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:33,870
'Hi, you've reached
the Clark County Veterinary Office.'

435
00:35:33,872 --> 00:35:37,407
'Our hours are 10 a.m. to
6 p.m., Monday through Friday'

436
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:39,041
'10 a.m. to 2 p.m..'

437
00:35:39,043 --> 00:35:41,211
The vet is closed.

438
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:43,979
Actually, we have
a first-aid kit at our place.

439
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,952
What was that?

440
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:52,457
Uh..

441
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:56,626
I think there's something
under the car.

442
00:35:56,628 --> 00:35:58,760
Okay, how about
we lock the doors

443
00:35:58,762 --> 00:36:02,865
and, uh, we'll fix her up
at your place, okay?

444
00:36:02,867 --> 00:36:03,902
Hm.

445
00:36:23,555 --> 00:36:24,687
So, Trissy, I was thinking

446
00:36:24,689 --> 00:36:26,356
maybe after we get her

447
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:28,224
all cleaned up and everything

448
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:30,760
'and she's feeling better,
she could, I don't know'

449
00:36:30,762 --> 00:36:32,394
'we could let her out
in the backyard'

450
00:36:32,396 --> 00:36:34,497
or put her in a cage or..

451
00:36:34,499 --> 00:36:36,533
A cage?
We're not putting her in a cage.

452
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:38,100
Yeah, but she's a wild animal.
I don't..

453
00:36:38,102 --> 00:36:40,704
'I don't wanna leave her
in your-your house'

454
00:36:40,706 --> 00:36:42,571
'and she, I don't know,
you could go to sleep'

455
00:36:42,573 --> 00:36:44,573
'and she tears up everything.
Like..'

456
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:46,376
'I think we all want her here.'

457
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,059
Okay.

458
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,933
Hey, Jake. What's the matter?

459
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:19,171
No signal.
Hold on, let me check.

460
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:22,405
Yeah, I-I don't have
a signal either.

461
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:23,742
Yeah.

462
00:38:29,247 --> 00:38:32,881
Okay. Whatever.
Let's get this over with.

463
00:38:32,883 --> 00:38:35,818
I don't think she's gonna like
that iodine very much.

464
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,287
What if she, like, freaks out
and bites one of us?

465
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:40,490
- She's not going to.
- 'Maybe Phillip's right.'

466
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:43,195
I mean,
those teeth do look sharp.

467
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,032
Actually,
can you two hold her down

468
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:53,236
and I guess I'll do the honors?

469
00:38:53,238 --> 00:38:55,006
Yeah. Okay, girl.

470
00:38:57,441 --> 00:38:59,142
Okay, okay, okay.

471
00:39:10,555 --> 00:39:11,757
Mm..

472
00:39:13,425 --> 00:39:14,457
Be careful, Drea.

473
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,825
Phillip,
why would you do that?

474
00:39:16,827 --> 00:39:19,963
You're making me nervous. Stop.

475
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:22,133
Okay, let's try this again.

476
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:26,271
Please don't bite me.

477
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:33,746
Oh, thank God.

478
00:39:36,648 --> 00:39:38,983
You're a tough little girl,
aren't you?

479
00:39:40,651 --> 00:39:43,419
- Alright.
- We should name her.

480
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:46,990
How about Snowball?

481
00:39:46,992 --> 00:39:48,825
- That's not very original.
- Yeah.

482
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:52,262
Okay, well,
let's see what you come up with.

483
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,198
What about Bianca?

484
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,533
- I like that.
- Yeah.

485
00:39:57,535 --> 00:39:59,135
Bianca it is, then.

486
00:39:59,137 --> 00:40:00,970
Alright, let me get my phone
so we can take a picture

487
00:40:00,972 --> 00:40:02,104
with us and Bianca.

488
00:40:02,106 --> 00:40:04,242
- Okay, hurry up.
- Mm-hmm.

489
00:40:05,644 --> 00:40:08,311
- I think she likes it.
- 'Yeah.'

490
00:40:47,452 --> 00:40:49,388
Is that another one?

491
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:00,729
Look, look, look, look.

492
00:41:00,731 --> 00:41:03,100
There's, uh, there's, uh,
there's something in your trunk.

493
00:41:03,102 --> 00:41:05,838
Uh, it's blurry,
but I-I think it's an alien.

494
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:16,380
Jake?

495
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,481
Jake?

496
00:42:05,664 --> 00:42:08,631
You scared me.

497
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:11,434
Do you wanna come in here
with us? We named her B..

498
00:42:13,537 --> 00:42:15,771
'Oh, my God. What is that?'

499
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:24,981
- Wait, wait, we forgot Bianca.
- What? Are you kidding me?

500
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:26,983
That thing just tried to rip
your brother's foot off.

501
00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:29,050
Are you okay?

502
00:42:29,052 --> 00:42:31,354
He's fine. We have to get her.

503
00:42:31,356 --> 00:42:34,090
Uh, yeah, no.
What if she tries to eat us?

504
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:36,260
She's clearly not gonna eat us.

505
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:39,097
She loves us.

506
00:42:41,164 --> 00:42:43,198
Here, Phillip,
take my key, go to the car

507
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,234
lock the door behind you.
Go, go, go.

508
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:46,635
I'll be back in a, in a second.

509
00:42:46,637 --> 00:42:47,671
'Oh, and, Drea.'

510
00:42:47,673 --> 00:42:49,608
'Grab the iodine for Jake!'

511
00:43:28,146 --> 00:43:29,981
Hey..

512
00:43:31,448 --> 00:43:33,783
Hey, Bianca.

513
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,655
You didn't do that, did you?

514
00:43:42,427 --> 00:43:46,162
Um, well, girl,
you made some fans

515
00:43:46,164 --> 00:43:48,396
so I'm gonna just
put you in this bag

516
00:43:48,398 --> 00:43:51,100
and you're gonna go
with us, okay?

517
00:43:51,102 --> 00:43:53,570
Little road trip, yeah?

518
00:43:53,572 --> 00:43:55,604
'You're so cute.'

519
00:43:55,606 --> 00:43:57,840
Love your highlights, it's..

520
00:43:57,842 --> 00:43:59,510
Please don't kill me.

521
00:44:01,878 --> 00:44:03,611
Who's that, Phillip?

522
00:44:03,613 --> 00:44:04,946
Huh?

523
00:44:04,948 --> 00:44:08,584
Oh, that's our mom.

524
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:11,088
Those are the Leroy steps,
right?

525
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:16,028
So what's she doing now?

526
00:44:19,497 --> 00:44:23,402
She, uh, she died
in a car accident.

527
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:28,104
Drea thinks it's her fault.

528
00:44:28,106 --> 00:44:29,439
She snuck out to a party

529
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:32,675
and, well, mom wanted to go pi..

530
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,149
- Let's go.
- Uh..

531
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:43,151
I have one Bianca,
one first-aid kit.

532
00:44:47,092 --> 00:44:49,725
Professor Lacy's
gonna need a cleaner.

533
00:44:49,727 --> 00:44:51,697
- What?
- What?

534
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:56,198
Nothing.
Keys, keys, where are my keys?

535
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,033
- What did you do with my keys?
- Right there.

536
00:44:58,035 --> 00:45:00,135
Sorry.

537
00:45:06,077 --> 00:45:07,175
Oh, my God.

538
00:45:07,177 --> 00:45:09,611
- What?
- What?

539
00:45:09,613 --> 00:45:13,251
Just give me a second,
just let me check one thing.

540
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:26,863
We're gonna have to walk.

541
00:45:26,865 --> 00:45:29,231
Walk? Walk where?

542
00:45:29,233 --> 00:45:31,133
To Uncle Lewis.

543
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:04,136
Hello, your highness.

544
00:46:44,742 --> 00:46:46,475
Uncle Lewis?

545
00:46:46,477 --> 00:46:49,178
Uncle Lewis? Uncle Lewis?

546
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,082
Drea, what's going on?

547
00:46:52,015 --> 00:46:54,082
Hey, Phillip.

548
00:46:54,084 --> 00:46:55,850
Huh, what's wrong
with your friend?

549
00:46:55,852 --> 00:46:58,086
He got bit by an alien.

550
00:46:58,088 --> 00:46:59,988
- An alien?
- Yeah.

551
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:03,094
Are you okay, son? Huh?

552
00:47:04,628 --> 00:47:06,695
What's your name?

553
00:47:08,398 --> 00:47:10,399
Kid's a mute, right?

554
00:47:10,401 --> 00:47:12,702
Um, not necessarily,
he's just..

555
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,870
Listen, I'd just, uh,
like to take a look at that...

556
00:47:14,872 --> 00:47:16,472
Yeah, no, no, no,
don't worry about it, we already

557
00:47:16,474 --> 00:47:18,374
cleaned it up
with iodine back at the house.

558
00:47:18,376 --> 00:47:19,908
What is going on? Phillip..

559
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,843
Have you got these people
on some wild alien chase?

560
00:47:21,845 --> 00:47:24,912
Phillip,
just show him your phone.

561
00:47:24,914 --> 00:47:27,119
Look.

562
00:47:28,718 --> 00:47:30,586
Thank you.
Think I'll keep that. Drea...

563
00:47:30,588 --> 00:47:32,120
You didn't even look
at the picture.

564
00:47:32,122 --> 00:47:35,524
No, no, Drea.
Just come to the office.

565
00:47:35,526 --> 00:47:37,662
- A minute.
- Huh. Great.

566
00:47:40,298 --> 00:47:43,164
Drea, you cannot bring
those kids into this office

567
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:45,167
talking all that nonsense.

568
00:47:45,169 --> 00:47:46,734
You want me to help that kid,
I'll help him.

569
00:47:46,736 --> 00:47:48,570
But otherwise,
what is he trying to prove?

570
00:47:48,572 --> 00:47:51,606
I'm trying to tell you that
something attacked Jake, okay?

571
00:47:51,608 --> 00:47:53,575
Something chewed its way
through my car.

572
00:47:53,577 --> 00:47:56,144
I had to walk here
from Professor Lacy's house!

573
00:47:56,146 --> 00:47:58,280
- You walked here?
- Yes!

574
00:47:58,282 --> 00:48:00,448
Well, what did you walk here
to say?

575
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:03,387
That aliens are real!

576
00:48:06,957 --> 00:48:08,390
Come on, Drea.

577
00:48:08,392 --> 00:48:10,158
I understand Phillip.

578
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,327
He's a kid,
he's got imagination.

579
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:13,896
You know? It's okay.

580
00:48:13,898 --> 00:48:15,298
But you, I don't understand.

581
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,631
- You're too old for this.
- No.

582
00:48:16,633 --> 00:48:18,434
We have one in Trissy's bag,
if you would just

583
00:48:18,436 --> 00:48:19,734
go out there and look at it

584
00:48:19,736 --> 00:48:22,805
it's a good one, I think, but..

585
00:48:22,807 --> 00:48:26,508
Drea, I don't have time
for this. Well, man, you, uh..

586
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,977
I got a lot of things
on my mind, you know?

587
00:48:27,979 --> 00:48:30,948
I got a lot of things to do.
I don't have time.

588
00:48:32,383 --> 00:48:33,818
I see you do.

589
00:48:35,253 --> 00:48:39,821
Hey, kids,
we're just gonna go see Chef.

590
00:48:39,823 --> 00:48:42,226
I'm sure
he'll be able to help us.

591
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,887
Dumbass.

592
00:50:27,097 --> 00:50:28,965
Thank you.

593
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:30,365
Please come again.

594
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:32,702
Uh, excuse me, Lan.

595
00:50:32,704 --> 00:50:34,870
Have you seen my nephew, Kevin?

596
00:50:34,872 --> 00:50:36,439
No.

597
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:38,807
Chef. Chef.

598
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:41,345
Hey, Drea. How's babysitting?

599
00:50:42,146 --> 00:50:45,079
Uh... it's goin' great.

600
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:47,048
Listen, I need to talk to you
about something

601
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:50,818
and you have to promise
that you'll take me seriously.

602
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,655
And also, we need your van,
'cause we gotta get out of town.

603
00:50:53,657 --> 00:50:56,026
Wait a minute.
What is this all about?

604
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:00,465
Can you show him the..

605
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,606
- Oh!
- No. No, no, no.

606
00:51:11,608 --> 00:51:13,142
It's-it's okay. It's okay.

607
00:51:13,144 --> 00:51:16,845
'But we seriously need to take
your van.'

608
00:52:15,874 --> 00:52:16,941
Okay.

609
00:52:58,347 --> 00:52:59,948
What the hell is that?

610
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,642
Ah..

611
00:54:08,751 --> 00:54:11,253
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.

612
00:54:11,255 --> 00:54:13,090
What is going on?

613
00:54:43,454 --> 00:54:45,990
No.. No.

614
00:54:47,224 --> 00:54:48,325
No.

615
00:55:17,088 --> 00:55:21,055
So you're telling me
there are a bunch of evil aliens

616
00:55:21,057 --> 00:55:25,162
and this one sitting here
is good?

617
00:55:26,863 --> 00:55:29,597
'Well, how do you know
he's good?'

618
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,068
She saved us from a bad one.

619
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,269
It's a she?

620
00:55:34,338 --> 00:55:35,803
Sorry.

621
00:55:35,805 --> 00:55:38,640
So, what's the plan?

622
00:55:38,642 --> 00:55:40,408
Where are you gonna go?

623
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,744
State police.

624
00:55:42,746 --> 00:55:44,512
That's quite a drive.

625
00:55:44,514 --> 00:55:47,816
And that van is pretty beat
to you-know-what.

626
00:55:47,818 --> 00:55:51,153
I know,
but we have to try something.

627
00:55:51,155 --> 00:55:55,423
Wait a second. My mom has
a satellite phone in her office.

628
00:55:55,425 --> 00:55:57,258
- Really?
- Yeah.

629
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:00,796
She uses it to communicate
with her researchers.

630
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:03,032
I totally forgot about it.

631
00:56:03,034 --> 00:56:04,899
Well there you have it,
we'll just use that phone

632
00:56:04,901 --> 00:56:07,401
to call for help,
and Leroy's not too far away

633
00:56:07,403 --> 00:56:08,838
so that's perfect.

634
00:56:13,577 --> 00:56:15,013
What the?

635
00:56:23,053 --> 00:56:24,620
'Uncle Lewis?'

636
00:56:24,622 --> 00:56:26,057
He's here?

637
00:56:33,863 --> 00:56:35,863
'I have to go out there.'

638
00:56:35,865 --> 00:56:38,769
Just lock the door behind me
and watch the kids, okay?

639
00:56:39,802 --> 00:56:41,371
I'll be back.

640
00:56:50,447 --> 00:56:52,150
No! No! No!

641
00:57:00,557 --> 00:57:03,258
That is gross.

642
00:57:08,331 --> 00:57:10,333
Kevin's sneaker.

643
00:57:18,474 --> 00:57:21,041
Hey. You okay?

644
00:57:21,043 --> 00:57:22,477
You can drive, can't you?

645
00:57:22,479 --> 00:57:24,948
- I'm 12.
- Exactly.

646
00:57:25,682 --> 00:57:27,852
Go. Get out of here.

647
00:57:29,919 --> 00:57:31,787
But what are you gonna do?

648
00:57:31,789 --> 00:57:34,025
I know they killed my nephew.

649
00:57:38,428 --> 00:57:40,497
I'm gonna make them pay.

650
00:57:45,468 --> 00:57:47,436
Uncle Lewis?

651
00:57:47,438 --> 00:57:48,704
Uncle Lewis, what happened?

652
00:57:48,706 --> 00:57:51,939
Drea, listen to me.

653
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:55,542
Sound. They can't take it.

654
00:57:55,544 --> 00:57:57,445
It'd kill them.

655
00:57:57,447 --> 00:58:00,916
Loud, high-pitched sound.

656
00:58:00,918 --> 00:58:02,651
You understand me?

657
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:04,756
Okay. Um..

658
00:58:05,923 --> 00:58:07,957
We gotta get you to a hospital.

659
00:58:07,959 --> 00:58:09,527
There's no time.

660
00:58:17,968 --> 00:58:21,135
Your mother called me
that night.

661
00:58:21,137 --> 00:58:24,107
She asked me to go and get you
at your friend's party.

662
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:29,843
I was in a bar.

663
00:58:29,845 --> 00:58:32,082
That's why she came to get you.

664
00:58:34,617 --> 00:58:36,353
It should've been me.

665
00:58:38,655 --> 00:58:42,425
Drea, I know you blame yourself
for your mom, but it's not you.

666
00:58:44,528 --> 00:58:46,861
It's not your fault.

667
00:58:46,863 --> 00:58:50,731
It's okay, Uncle Lewis.
I forgive you, okay?

668
00:58:50,733 --> 00:58:53,434
I-I just, I just gotta get
Chef's truck

669
00:58:53,436 --> 00:58:56,173
and I, and I, and I gotta get
the kids and then..

670
00:58:58,207 --> 00:59:00,410
You hear me, Uncle Lewis?

671
00:59:01,445 --> 00:59:03,247
Uncle Lewis!

672
00:59:15,459 --> 00:59:16,828
You bastards.

673
00:59:18,095 --> 00:59:19,861
Drea, we have the keys!

674
00:59:54,432 --> 00:59:55,566
Move, move!

675
00:59:59,936 --> 01:00:02,169
- Where's Chef?
- Not coming.

676
01:00:02,171 --> 01:00:03,537
- Okay.
- What about Uncle Lewis?

677
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:06,642
He okay? Drea?

678
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:09,010
Um, remember something for me.

679
01:00:09,012 --> 01:00:10,278
- What?
- High pitched-sounds.

680
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,881
They hate high-pitched sounds,
okay?

681
01:00:17,186 --> 01:00:18,921
Hey! Wait. Get up, get up!

682
01:00:28,865 --> 01:00:32,934
Taste my steel,
you rat bastards.

683
01:00:32,936 --> 01:00:36,571
I have the best blades
in the business.

684
01:00:36,573 --> 01:00:38,142
Hyah!

685
01:00:42,412 --> 01:00:44,012
You want some?

686
01:00:44,014 --> 01:00:45,981
'Huh? Huh?'

687
01:01:28,659 --> 01:01:30,425
Never there when I need him.

688
01:01:30,427 --> 01:01:32,561
- Who? Shawn?
- Yes.

689
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:34,729
Shawn has the keys
to every building on campus.

690
01:01:34,731 --> 01:01:38,832
We find Shawn, we get the keys,
we get to the satellite phone.

691
01:01:38,834 --> 01:01:41,972
- But Shawn is not here.
- Nope.

692
01:01:49,012 --> 01:01:50,211
I-I hear him.

693
01:01:50,213 --> 01:01:52,080
I-I-I-I hear him.

694
01:01:52,082 --> 01:01:53,580
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Um..

695
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:55,416
Everybody out of the car.
Let's..

696
01:01:55,418 --> 01:01:56,386
Okay.

697
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,954
Quickly, please.

698
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:03,524
Hey, Jake, you okay?
Good to walk?

699
01:02:03,526 --> 01:02:06,063
Well, at least
he's playing a lot better.

700
01:02:08,765 --> 01:02:10,267
Hey, Shawn?

701
01:02:11,302 --> 01:02:12,436
Shaw..

702
01:02:14,938 --> 01:02:16,338
Shawn?

703
01:02:20,577 --> 01:02:22,109
Oh, my God.

704
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:24,245
Guys, um, Shawn is busy.

705
01:02:24,247 --> 01:02:27,481
Run, run.
Don't look back, just run.

706
01:02:27,483 --> 01:02:29,885
'Keep running! Keep.. Trissy?'

707
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:32,019
'You're lagging behind,
come on!'

708
01:02:41,331 --> 01:02:43,564
How did they get here so fast?

709
01:02:43,566 --> 01:02:46,066
I don't know. Just, please,
just give me a second to think.

710
01:02:46,068 --> 01:02:47,436
This is hopeless.

711
01:02:47,438 --> 01:02:50,240
They-they must have spread
all across town by now.

712
01:02:53,343 --> 01:02:55,542
Guys.

713
01:02:55,544 --> 01:02:58,481
I think they keep finding us
because of Bianca.

714
01:03:02,619 --> 01:03:05,055
Jake, did you
just say something?

715
01:03:07,624 --> 01:03:09,791
You know, you got a deep-ass
voice for a nine-year-old.

716
01:03:09,793 --> 01:03:12,660
Wait, wait a second.
You think they're after her?

717
01:03:12,662 --> 01:03:16,129
Yeah.
I think they can smell her.

718
01:03:17,767 --> 01:03:19,934
Okay. You know what?
We can't stay here.

719
01:03:19,936 --> 01:03:22,736
Let's um.. Mandy and Gregory.

720
01:03:22,738 --> 01:03:26,642
Let's go see if they have keys
to your mom's office.

721
01:03:26,644 --> 01:03:30,546
- Well, what about this gate?
- What gate?

722
01:03:33,784 --> 01:03:36,050
'Mandy!'

723
01:03:36,052 --> 01:03:38,787
'Gregory!'

724
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:41,088
Is anyone there?
Please let us in. Hello?

725
01:03:43,093 --> 01:03:47,262
Mandy! Oh, Mandy, Mandy, hi. Hi!

726
01:03:47,264 --> 01:03:49,865
It's an emergency.
Please open, please..

727
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:51,999
- Thank you.
- Okay, go, go!

728
01:03:54,671 --> 01:03:58,907
Mandy, there are, there are
creatures, monsters outside

729
01:03:58,909 --> 01:04:02,244
from outer space,
and they're trying to kill us.

730
01:04:02,246 --> 01:04:04,879
I'm sorry,
did you just say monsters?

731
01:04:04,881 --> 01:04:06,814
- Yes.
- Drea.

732
01:04:06,816 --> 01:04:10,419
Don't screw up this gig
with some elaborate prank.

733
01:04:10,421 --> 01:04:12,320
These kids should
probably be in bed by now.

734
01:04:12,322 --> 01:04:13,754
No, this is,
this is not a prank.

735
01:04:13,756 --> 01:04:16,057
This-this is serious.

736
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:20,461
Listen, I know that this isn't
the campus job that you wanted

737
01:04:20,463 --> 01:04:22,129
but I really was doing you
a favor.

738
01:04:22,131 --> 01:04:24,164
Okay, well,
you know what, bitch?

739
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:26,602
Do me a favor and don't do me
anymore favors, okay?

740
01:04:26,604 --> 01:04:28,736
- We need help!
- Oh, okay.

741
01:04:28,738 --> 01:04:31,039
Yeah, because you were doing
perfectly fine on your own

742
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:33,006
getting into the school?

743
01:04:33,008 --> 01:04:34,811
You know what, Mandy?

744
01:04:39,115 --> 01:04:40,751
Eat shit.

745
01:04:42,251 --> 01:04:43,385
Yeah, real mature.

746
01:04:43,387 --> 01:04:44,885
No, you know what's real mature?

747
01:04:44,887 --> 01:04:46,722
You not answering
your best friend's calls

748
01:04:46,724 --> 01:04:49,122
once you got accepted
into this fancy-ass college.

749
01:04:49,124 --> 01:04:50,524
That's what's real mature.

750
01:04:50,526 --> 01:04:54,028
Okay, I'm sorry, but... yeah.

751
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,430
No. I'm-I'm not doing this
right now.

752
01:04:56,432 --> 01:04:57,466
Okay.

753
01:04:57,468 --> 01:05:00,271
But good luck with your aliens.

754
01:05:02,972 --> 01:05:06,073
So, uh, what is going on

755
01:05:06,075 --> 01:05:07,843
and why are you back here?

756
01:05:07,845 --> 01:05:09,010
Okay, so listen.

757
01:05:09,012 --> 01:05:11,312
We need the keys
to the history department.

758
01:05:11,314 --> 01:05:12,981
My mom has a satellite phone
in her office

759
01:05:12,983 --> 01:05:14,316
and we need to call for help.

760
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:15,582
Okay, I don't have the keys

761
01:05:15,584 --> 01:05:16,852
to the history department.

762
01:05:16,854 --> 01:05:18,285
Just to the great hall
that we're decorating

763
01:05:18,287 --> 01:05:19,486
for the freshmen.

764
01:05:19,488 --> 01:05:22,457
Ugh! Okay. New plan.

765
01:05:22,459 --> 01:05:26,260
We have to, uh, go back
to the security shed

766
01:05:26,262 --> 01:05:27,394
and-and get Shawn's keys.

767
01:05:27,396 --> 01:05:30,097
Oh, no, no,
I do not love that plan.

768
01:05:30,099 --> 01:05:31,966
Okay, hold on just a second.

769
01:05:31,968 --> 01:05:35,836
If that's all you need to do,
then, I mean, I can do that.

770
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:38,106
- Uh, it's kind of complicated.
- No, it's gonna be fine.

771
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:39,841
- It's fine.
- No. Uh..

772
01:05:39,843 --> 01:05:41,575
What are you doing, bro?

773
01:05:41,577 --> 01:05:45,546
Listen,
I don't believe in monsters.

774
01:05:45,548 --> 01:05:48,283
But I do believe in one thing.

775
01:05:48,285 --> 01:05:51,251
- Oh, uh..
- I can run incredibly fast.

776
01:05:51,253 --> 01:05:52,820
Okay, but you don't understand.

777
01:05:52,822 --> 01:05:55,856
- Shawn was actually just...
- Shh!

778
01:05:55,858 --> 01:05:59,227
I took States
in the 800 and 1600 last year.

779
01:05:59,229 --> 01:06:00,928
I'll go get those keys

780
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:04,099
and then I'll be back here
in 2.7 minutes.

781
01:06:04,101 --> 01:06:05,633
- Don't miss me.
- Wait.

782
01:06:05,635 --> 01:06:07,401
But-but you-you really need
to be careful

783
01:06:07,403 --> 01:06:09,704
because I-I was trying
to tell you that..

784
01:06:10,573 --> 01:06:12,240
...Shawn was actually killed.

785
01:06:12,242 --> 01:06:13,908
Dammit! Come on!

786
01:06:20,718 --> 01:06:21,852
Whoo!

787
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,754
Yeah!

788
01:06:31,561 --> 01:06:33,827
What's that sound?

789
01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:35,298
I don't know.

790
01:06:37,834 --> 01:06:38,969
Oh!

791
01:06:42,805 --> 01:06:44,238
Oh..

792
01:07:06,428 --> 01:07:07,794
We gotta get
to your mom's office.

793
01:07:07,796 --> 01:07:09,463
We gotta get
to your mom's office.

794
01:07:09,465 --> 01:07:10,731
I'm sorry you had to see that.

795
01:07:10,733 --> 01:07:12,566
Come on, come on, we gotta get

796
01:07:12,568 --> 01:07:14,269
to your mom's office.

797
01:07:21,577 --> 01:07:24,412
We're all gonna die tonight.

798
01:07:24,414 --> 01:07:25,579
Aren't we?

799
01:07:25,581 --> 01:07:27,682
No. No one's dying.

800
01:07:27,684 --> 01:07:31,119
But a huge ball of those things
just devoured Greg.

801
01:07:31,121 --> 01:07:34,823
- Yeah, well, we're not Greg.
- Yeah, but..

802
01:07:34,825 --> 01:07:38,459
But nothing.
No one's dying tonight.

803
01:07:38,461 --> 01:07:41,064
- You know why?
- Why?

804
01:07:42,965 --> 01:07:45,466
Because..

805
01:07:45,468 --> 01:07:47,434
...no one's coming to save us

806
01:07:47,436 --> 01:07:49,504
and we need to stop thinking
that someone will

807
01:07:49,506 --> 01:07:51,642
because it's not happening.

808
01:07:55,811 --> 01:07:57,445
You're not making us feel
any better.

809
01:07:57,447 --> 01:07:59,048
No, you're not.

810
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:04,452
My point is,
we don't need saving.

811
01:08:04,454 --> 01:08:06,454
We don't need some fancy-ass

812
01:08:06,456 --> 01:08:09,090
Leroy University students
to help us.

813
01:08:09,092 --> 01:08:13,227
We don't need Uncle Lewis
and we don't need Chef.

814
01:08:13,229 --> 01:08:14,963
We don't need anyone.

815
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,633
Just each other.

816
01:08:17,433 --> 01:08:19,400
Okay?

817
01:08:21,937 --> 01:08:23,506
C-come on.

818
01:08:26,509 --> 01:08:29,110
No one else is dying tonight.

819
01:08:29,112 --> 01:08:31,413
I promise.

820
01:08:31,415 --> 01:08:32,713
And if anyone's dying,
it's gonna be

821
01:08:32,715 --> 01:08:35,017
one of those little turds,
you feel me?

822
01:08:37,687 --> 01:08:40,754
Now let's find
your mom's office.

823
01:08:40,756 --> 01:08:43,358
I don't care if we have
to kick down her damn door.

824
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,507
Guys, i-it's a keypad.

825
01:09:33,509 --> 01:09:35,409
We can't get through
without a password.

826
01:09:35,411 --> 01:09:36,577
Okay, well, try something.

827
01:09:36,579 --> 01:09:39,413
I mean,
how many numbers could it be?

828
01:09:39,415 --> 01:09:41,716
How many numbers can it be?

829
01:09:41,718 --> 01:09:44,586
I-it can be so many numbers.
Too many numbers.

830
01:09:44,588 --> 01:09:46,221
I mean, mathematically,
this is impossible.

831
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,021
- We can't...
- Okay, just-just hold on.

832
01:09:48,023 --> 01:09:49,891
It's not impossible,
just think of some numbers

833
01:09:49,893 --> 01:09:52,129
that would be important
to your mom.

834
01:09:53,429 --> 01:09:56,629
I mean, I-I can try my birthday.

835
01:09:56,631 --> 01:09:58,602
Yeah. Try that.

836
01:10:08,143 --> 01:10:10,146
It worked.

837
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:16,253
- Let's go through the door.
- Yeah.

838
01:10:37,273 --> 01:10:39,641
Um, my mom's office is just

839
01:10:39,643 --> 01:10:43,043
is just right through
this room, okay?

840
01:10:43,045 --> 01:10:44,180
Okay.

841
01:10:51,854 --> 01:10:53,687
We'll make it there.

842
01:10:53,689 --> 01:10:55,556
What is that smell?

843
01:10:55,558 --> 01:10:57,160
Doesn't smell good.

844
01:11:00,696 --> 01:11:02,532
Wait a second.

845
01:11:08,004 --> 01:11:09,203
Wait.

846
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,847
Go! Go!

847
01:11:17,647 --> 01:11:19,346
Wait!

848
01:11:21,049 --> 01:11:23,016
Trissy?

849
01:11:23,018 --> 01:11:24,084
She's upset.

850
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:28,122
I think she has some unfinished
business with the other ones.

851
01:11:30,326 --> 01:11:32,892
Look, I'm sorry, kiddo,
but we gotta leave her here.

852
01:11:32,894 --> 01:11:35,096
- But...
- Trissy..

853
01:11:35,098 --> 01:11:39,199
It's the right thing to do.
Leave her here.

854
01:11:39,201 --> 01:11:41,703
She can handle herself.

855
01:11:41,705 --> 01:11:44,305
She already proved she can.

856
01:11:44,307 --> 01:11:45,642
Come on.

857
01:11:48,045 --> 01:11:50,778
I'm gonna miss you, Bianca.

858
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:53,148
Trissy, we gotta go.

859
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:55,483
Okay, I'm coming.

860
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,704
Hello?

861
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,440
What the?

862
01:12:27,349 --> 01:12:29,018
M-Mandy!

863
01:12:33,156 --> 01:12:35,025
I'm so sorry.

864
01:12:37,692 --> 01:12:39,396
Mm. Okay.

865
01:12:40,662 --> 01:12:42,799
Did I leave the car on?

866
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:48,302
No! No!

867
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:09,757
Hey, guys,
I-I don't see 'em anymore.

868
01:13:09,759 --> 01:13:11,428
Just keep running.

869
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:16,396
Whoa! Shh...

870
01:13:16,398 --> 01:13:19,132
- Hey.
- Hi.

871
01:13:19,134 --> 01:13:21,534
I-I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

872
01:13:21,536 --> 01:13:23,369
Yeah, you should've.

873
01:13:23,371 --> 01:13:25,239
Have you seen Gregory?

874
01:13:25,241 --> 01:13:26,443
Uh..

875
01:13:27,643 --> 01:13:30,278
Can we talk about that later?

876
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,878
Okay.

877
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,580
- Drea?
- What?

878
01:13:33,582 --> 01:13:35,283
- Oh, my God.
- He's back.

879
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:40,687
Why is he just staring at us
like that?

880
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:42,090
Who cares? Get in!

881
01:13:42,092 --> 01:13:44,057
Right.
Come on, come on, come on.

882
01:13:44,059 --> 01:13:45,892
Come on, right here.

883
01:13:45,894 --> 01:13:47,227
- Okay.
- Okay?

884
01:13:50,066 --> 01:13:51,966
'My car is in the parking lot.'

885
01:13:51,968 --> 01:13:53,199
We just gotta get there

886
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:55,502
and get out
of this shitty campus.

887
01:13:55,504 --> 01:13:56,971
Shitty campus?

888
01:13:56,973 --> 01:13:59,440
Yeah. Sucks here.

889
01:13:59,442 --> 01:14:02,510
Hold up! Why are we running
from these fur balls?

890
01:14:02,512 --> 01:14:04,110
'Cause we don't wanna die?

891
01:14:04,112 --> 01:14:06,314
You don't have anything in your
bag like a, like a sharp weapon

892
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:08,449
or a knife or, I don't,
I don't know, like a...

893
01:14:08,451 --> 01:14:12,252
No. I mean, next
to the nunchucks and axe, maybe.

894
01:14:12,254 --> 01:14:13,289
Wait.

895
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,591
What's in that shed?

896
01:14:17,593 --> 01:14:19,162
Yes.

897
01:14:20,362 --> 01:14:21,294
Okay.

898
01:14:21,296 --> 01:14:23,864
Okay, everybody out,
go, go, go! Go!

899
01:14:37,813 --> 01:14:39,646
You guys got all the good stuff.

900
01:14:39,648 --> 01:14:42,016
I don't know.

901
01:14:42,018 --> 01:14:44,254
Here, you can have
this leaf blower.

902
01:14:45,354 --> 01:14:46,620
What am I supposed to do
with that?

903
01:14:46,622 --> 01:14:47,788
Blow them away, like, literally?

904
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:49,623
- I don't know.
- Okay, listen.

905
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:53,593
All we got is a stupid air horn
and a paintbrush?

906
01:14:53,595 --> 01:14:55,529
- Wait. Drea.
- What?

907
01:14:55,531 --> 01:14:57,367
High-pitched sounds.

908
01:14:58,434 --> 01:15:00,234
Remember?

909
01:15:00,236 --> 01:15:03,203
Right. Uncle Lewis said
high-pitched sounds.

910
01:15:03,205 --> 01:15:04,971
They, they hate
high-pitched sounds.

911
01:15:04,973 --> 01:15:06,940
Okay. Alright, guys.

912
01:15:06,942 --> 01:15:09,642
I'm, I'm gonna see
if Uncle Lewis was right.

913
01:15:09,644 --> 01:15:11,080
Uh, just..

914
01:15:11,848 --> 01:15:13,216
Be careful.

915
01:15:18,521 --> 01:15:20,988
- 'Why isn't it working?'
- I don't know!

916
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:22,323
- 'Is it empty?'
- I don't know.

917
01:15:22,325 --> 01:15:25,426
It doesn't sound empty.

918
01:15:25,428 --> 01:15:27,561
'It doesn't sound like
anything, actually.'

919
01:15:27,563 --> 01:15:29,564
Come on, please, please, please.

920
01:15:33,768 --> 01:15:34,868
Ha!

921
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:40,408
Take that, you little dickhead!

922
01:15:47,983 --> 01:15:50,251
Okay, okay.

923
01:15:50,253 --> 01:15:51,886
Now, where's that
other little shit?

924
01:16:00,763 --> 01:16:02,930
This is for my Uncle Lewis

925
01:16:02,932 --> 01:16:05,332
the only family I had,
you asshole!

926
01:16:17,179 --> 01:16:18,044
Oh, no.

927
01:16:21,884 --> 01:16:22,983
Oh..

928
01:16:25,754 --> 01:16:27,590
Oh, shit.

929
01:16:35,798 --> 01:16:39,534
Let's not wait for someone
to come and save us, right?

930
01:18:27,076 --> 01:18:28,208
Nice.

931
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:29,944
We got this.

932
01:18:44,626 --> 01:18:45,659
Are you..

933
01:18:45,661 --> 01:18:49,529
I'm... fine?

934
01:18:58,273 --> 01:19:00,140
'I got it, just stay back.'

935
01:19:02,978 --> 01:19:05,613
Ah! Ah!

936
01:19:38,781 --> 01:19:41,384
Best blades in the business,
bitch.

937
01:19:46,988 --> 01:19:49,590
Wow! Oh!

938
01:19:49,592 --> 01:19:51,458
- You good, bro?
- Yeah, I'm good.

939
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:54,428
Trissy, I saw you
kickin' butt and taking names.

940
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:57,634
Jake, he was kickin' em
like soccer.

941
01:19:58,733 --> 01:20:00,601
Mandy, it was alright.

942
01:20:00,603 --> 01:20:04,070
You did that, Philly
cheesesteak, alright? Whoo!

943
01:20:05,707 --> 01:20:07,608
Drea, behind you!

944
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,156
Who the hell is that?

945
01:20:22,758 --> 01:20:25,428
I don't know,
but that's a really big gun.

946
01:20:27,563 --> 01:20:29,128
Everybody get your weapons.

947
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:31,030
- Okay.
- Uh..

948
01:20:33,768 --> 01:20:36,606
Five against one?
We can fight that bitch.

949
01:20:38,741 --> 01:20:40,740
Hey, guys, I'm Aunt Dee.

950
01:20:40,742 --> 01:20:42,943
- Whose aunt are you, exactly?
- Uh..

951
01:20:48,549 --> 01:20:51,351
I'm a bounty hunter,
I'm looking for the queen

952
01:20:51,353 --> 01:20:54,157
and I'm pretty sure
she's inside.

953
01:20:55,057 --> 01:20:56,693
Protect yourselves.

954
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,265
What just happened?

955
01:22:17,805 --> 01:22:19,773
Ah.

956
01:22:19,775 --> 01:22:21,274
There you are.

957
01:22:38,227 --> 01:22:40,260
You saved me.

958
01:22:44,567 --> 01:22:47,367
You travelled all this way
to keep the male crites

959
01:22:47,369 --> 01:22:49,906
from taking over the Earth,
didn't you?

960
01:22:56,144 --> 01:22:57,914
A peaceful leader.

961
01:23:00,249 --> 01:23:01,584
Cover me.

962
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,694
Hey, when the phone lines
are back

963
01:23:13,696 --> 01:23:15,796
I'm gonna give
Professor Lacy a call.

964
01:23:15,798 --> 01:23:17,396
You should be
her teacher's assistant

965
01:23:17,398 --> 01:23:19,800
not this babysitting crap.

966
01:23:19,802 --> 01:23:22,569
No offence.

967
01:23:22,571 --> 01:23:26,440
If you become
a teacher's assistant for a year

968
01:23:26,442 --> 01:23:28,742
make a lot of friends in admin

969
01:23:28,744 --> 01:23:30,810
I think you'd have a real shot.

970
01:23:30,812 --> 01:23:32,447
A year, huh?

971
01:23:36,018 --> 01:23:37,551
You know, on second thought

972
01:23:37,553 --> 01:23:40,555
I never really saw myself
as, like, a teacher's assistant.

973
01:23:42,089 --> 01:23:44,492
Wait, are you serious?

974
01:23:44,494 --> 01:23:46,062
Hell, yeah.

975
01:23:47,095 --> 01:23:50,163
Um, does your neck hurt?

976
01:23:50,165 --> 01:23:51,900
Oh. Uh, no.

977
01:23:53,902 --> 01:23:55,802
How about now?

978
01:23:55,804 --> 01:23:56,939
Ow.

979
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,006
Yeah. Now, now it hurts.

980
01:24:04,278 --> 01:24:06,316
You guys are gross.

981
01:24:07,348 --> 01:24:08,547
Alright, kids.

982
01:24:08,549 --> 01:24:10,751
Let's get on the road.

983
01:24:10,753 --> 01:24:13,555
State police is a long drive.

984
01:24:21,129 --> 01:24:23,532
- What the hell is that?
- Hey!

985
01:24:24,265 --> 01:24:25,966
Look alive, guys.

986
01:24:25,968 --> 01:24:27,234
You know how to use that?

987
01:24:27,236 --> 01:24:29,572
- Not a damn clue.
- Follow me.

988
01:24:30,973 --> 01:24:32,471
Drea, are you crazy?

989
01:24:32,473 --> 01:24:34,108
'Watch the kids!'

990
01:24:46,388 --> 01:24:48,154
Okay, here we go.

991
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:54,261
Turn that switch on the side.

992
01:24:54,263 --> 01:24:55,796
Okay.

993
01:24:57,133 --> 01:24:58,664
Stay calm.

994
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:00,100
Phillip, help me aim.

995
01:25:02,405 --> 01:25:03,939
On my count.

996
01:25:05,206 --> 01:25:06,541
One.

997
01:25:07,744 --> 01:25:08,878
'Two.'

998
01:25:10,379 --> 01:25:11,714
Three.

999
01:25:12,848 --> 01:25:13,879
Kill crites!

1000
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:23,925
Told you aliens were real.

1001
