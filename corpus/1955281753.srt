00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,097
I've had people dropping out
of trees making me huge offers

185
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,199
to tell them where these
two little freaks are; okay?

186
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,334
Judith Grey: Fine.

187
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,035
So what does it hurt you
to help me a little bit?

188
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,105
Collins: I made a
promise to be discreet.

Judith Grey: What?

190
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,108
Your big offers weren't
big enough.

Collins: Let's just say my
integrity means a lot to me.

192
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:18,050
Look, you and I don't
have to negotiate

193
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,552
on a cash basis, do we?

194
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,354
Judith Grey: Give me a break.

195
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,356
Collins: You've
got assets, baby.

196
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:31,230
You should learn
how to use them.

197
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,231
Well...

198
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,333
Judith Grey: Maybe
you're right.

199
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,234
Collins: I always
figured that the cops

200
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:41,207
and the press should learn how
to cooperate with each other.

201
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:47,680
But I can't give up anything
until you give something to me.

202

Judith Grey: Fair enough.

203
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:54,287
But I've got to have
something, just a taste.

204
00:20:54,287 --> 00:21:00,192
Just so I know that your
information is good, you know?

be able to talk about it.

I can wait another year.

717
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:59,383
It depends on you.

718
00:56:59,383 --> 00:57:02,520
Well, it seems your Dollman
doesn't think as much

719
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,054
of you as you believe.

720
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:07,024
Ginger: Don't
listen to him, Brick.

721
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:08,459
Now drop it on the floor.

723
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:12,663
Ginger: No, no.

724
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:13,363
Get over here.

725
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:14,431
Here's the plan, Bardo.

726
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:20,905
You try anything and
I'll break her neck.

727
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:22,873
Do we understand each other?

728
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:23,574
Brick Bardo: Yeah.

729
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:24,709
Now, tell you what?

730
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:30,748
I'll let you watch me do
the nasty with Ginger.

731
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:38,923
You'll be the first to
experience my human birth.

732
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:39,890
Ginger: No.

733
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:44,895
It will be a real
honor for you.

734
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:47,231
Ginger: Don't listen
to that creep, Brick.

735
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:49,466
Remember he's still just a doll.

736
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,435
How wrong you are, my dear.

737
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:54,371
I have all the tools
necessary now.

738
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:55,506
Ginger: All the tools.

we going to do now?

743

Brick Bardo: Call the cops.

744
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,973
Tell them Judith Grey died
in the line of duty and after

745
00:58:28,973 --> 00:58:34,478
that we've got to find
our way back home.

Brick Bardo: Pahoota.

00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:02,306
What? You say you
want to come here?

749
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:04,508
Brick Bardo: I
said Pahoota, pal.

750
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:08,112
What's the matter?

751
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:10,247
You don't hear so well?

Brick Bardo: Step on it.

754
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:21,692
We're a little short of patience
if you know what I mean.
