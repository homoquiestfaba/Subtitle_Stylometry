Why this police man is behind my son?

389
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,167

lt was my fault. All this is because of me

393
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,675
Love is not a mistake

394
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,778
Love is blind

395
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,187
lts not that blind that you can*t
differentiate between a girl and a boy

396
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:45,255

But now they gave that position
to someone else

414
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,985
lts not a big deal.
Why are you crying?

415
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,187

416
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,820

Everything is vanished

417
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,796
You are fired.

418
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:33,333

421
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:58,423
Or anything you want.
Our friendship is more rocking than any plan

422
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:34,695
Listen.

424
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,740
This body will come for use that day

425
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,578
Chill and be ok!
