1
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,754
It's an impressive collection.

2
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,149
You have some very rare editions.

3
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,151
Sure you want to sell them?

4
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,515
They're no use to Father,

5
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,875
not since he's been this way.

6
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,349
His library was his whole world,

7
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,271
now it's just a painful memory.

8
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,237
Unbearably painful.

9
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,276
I understand.

10
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,238
Well...

11
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,599
At a rough preliminary estimate,
you have a collection here

12
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,035
worth around $600,000.

13
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,997
600,000?!

14
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,230
Yes, or thereabouts.

15
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,313
I've picked out one or two volumes
that merit special attention.

16
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,119
This Persiles, for example,
is important.

17
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,988
I'd hang on to that.
It will never depreciate.

18
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,640
- Valuable?
- Very valuable.

19
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,554
As for this
Hypnerotomachia di Polifilo,

20
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,712
by Colonna, Venice, 1545, erm...

21
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,678
I'm sure
I could find you a buyer.

22
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,991
But I wouldn't let the rest go
for less than 500,000.

23
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,036
Under any circumstances.

24
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,756
It may take a month to place them,

25
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,956
so in the meantime, be patient.

26
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,996
- A month?
- Yes, or two.

27
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,470
It depends on how much of a hurry
you're in. More hurry, less money.

28
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,471
0f course.

29
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,232
That's my advice, anyway.

30
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,470
I'm sure you wouldn't want
to rush things,

31
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,790
but feel free to consult
another expert.

32
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,155
Any questions,
you know where to reach me.

33
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,471
Incidentally, this four-volume
edition of Don Quixote

34
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,712
is quite nice
but not particularly valuable.

35
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,075
Now, I could...

36
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,355
take it off your hands...

37
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,396
right away.

38
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,873
How much were you thinking of?

39
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,589
I couldn't go more than 4,000.
4,200 tops.

40
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,830
Fine.

41
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,713
- You here?
- Witkin.

42
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,349
- You didn't waste much time.
- There's a fortune in there.

43
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,271
You're a vulture, Corso.

44
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,316
Who isn't in our business?

45
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,551
- You'd stoop to anything.
- You bet I would.

46
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,518
Unscrupulous.
Thoroughly unscrupulous.

47
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,556
Happy hunting.

48
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,791
I just spoke to Witkin.

49
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,348
He's spitting blood.

50
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,193
Really? What's his problem?

51
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,193
He said you're a double-dealing,
money-grubbing bastard.

52
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,272
Thought he had that deal sewn up.

53
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,316
Said you "queered" his pitch.

54
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,470
He should have been quicker.

55
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,879
May I?

56
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,518
Sure.

57
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,558
He said your evaluation
was way over the top.

58
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,154
Had those people
coming out in a rash.

59
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,789
Now they're asking twice
what those books are worth.

60
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,152
Face it, you screwed him.
That's what it's called.

61
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,992
That's what it's called.

62
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,753
He also said
that you snatched the Don Qui...

63
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,878
You bought a Don Quixote 1780,

64
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,633
all four volumes?

65
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,551
Son of a bitch!

66
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,270
Fantastic. Fantastic.
You are the best.

67
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,716
Your Swiss client,
would he still be interested?

68
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,758
I'll have Witkin on my ass,
I told him I had no part in this.

69
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,070
Except ten per cent.

70
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,958
Twenty per cent.
The Swiss was my client.

71
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,758
No deal.

72
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,751
Fifteen, for my children's sake.

73
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,876
- You don't have any.
- I'm still young.

74
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,915
Ten.

75
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,398
How you doin',
how about a couple of bucks?

76
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,313
Not today, not today.

77
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,713
In the present context, however...

78
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,830
...and earlier, in 1580,
in De la DEmonomanie des Sorciers

79
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,115
by the Frenchman Jean Bodin.

80
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,078
Bodin was probably the first

81
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,355
to attempt to establish a system,

82
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,513
if the term "system"
may be applied to the Middle Ages,

83
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,318
for classifying evil.

84
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,155
In Bodin, we find one of the first
definitions of the word "witch"

85
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,710
and I quote,
"A witch is a person who,

86
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,553
"though cognisant of the laws of God,

87
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,315
"endeavours to act through the medium
of a pact with the devil."

88
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,313
To assist them in their work,
many witches kept familiars,

89
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,392
that is to say,
creatures such as cats or toads,

90
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,917
in which supernatural spirits
or demons were thought to reside.

91
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,719
For those of you who wish
to delve more deeply

92
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,836
into the subject of witchcraft,

93
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,869
a great deal of relevant information
may be found in the following works.

94
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,713
Nicolas REmy's Demonolatria Libri,

95
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,429
and Compendium Maleficarum
by Francesco Maria Guazzo.

96
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,519
I see you were stimulated
by my talk, Mr Corso.

97
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,351
Did I snore?

98
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,035
It's nice of you to ask.
No, not that I noticed.

99
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,872
Shall we go?

100
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,558
Don't you sleep nights?

101
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,870
- Like a baby.
- Strange.

102
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,916
I'd have bet a Gutenberg Bible

103
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,560
you spend half the night
with your eyes peeled.

104
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,632
You're one of those
lean, hungry types

105
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,109
that put the wind up Julius Caesar.

106
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,397
Men who stab their friends
in the back.

107
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,237
Not, I suspect, that you have
many friends, do you?

108
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,231
Your kind seldom does.

109
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,629
That makes two of us.

110
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,549
You're right, of course.
Your friendships don't concern me.

111
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,915
0ur relations have always been
commercial

112
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,956
and that's the way I like it.

113
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,350
The professional and the personal
should be exclusive.

114
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,398
I'm here to do business,
not shoot the breeze.

115
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,836
If you want to expound your
philosophies, write another book.

116
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,273
You don't like me, do you?

117
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,157
I don't have to.
You're a client and you pay well.

118
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,193
You're privileged, Mr Corso.

119
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,874
Very few people
ever set foot in here.

120
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,474
This is my private collection.

121
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,438
Some bibliophiles specialise in
Gothic novels,

122
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,476
others in books of hours.

123
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,269
All my own rare editions
have the same protagonist.

124
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,316
The devil.

125
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,359
- May I take a look?
- Yes. It's why I brought you here.

126
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,396
Beautiful, aren't they?

127
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,357
The soft sheen, the superb gilding.

128
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,955
Not to mention the centuries
of wisdom they contain.

129
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,510
I know people who would kill
for a collection like this.

130
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,636
Vias Diaboli.

131
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,998
You'll never see as many books
on the subject anywhere else.

132
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,356
They're the rarest, choicest
editions in existence.

133
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,591
It's taken me a lifetime
to assemble them.

134
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,753
0nly the supreme masterpiece
was missing. Come.

135
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,233
The Nine Gates
in the Kingdom of Shadows.

136
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,074
- You're familiar with it?
- Yes. Venice, 1666.

137
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,469
The author and printer,
Aristide Torchia,

138
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,870
was burned by the Holy Inquisition,
together with all his works.

139
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,996
0nly three copies survived.

140
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,399
0ne.

141
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,190
The catalogue lists three copies.
Fargas, the Kessler and the Telfer.

142
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,716
You know your business,
but you're mistaken.

143
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,351
- 0nly one is authentic.
- Well, three are known.

144
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,874
That's the trouble.

145
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,916
Where'd you get it?

146
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,956
I bought it from Telfer.

147
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,759
- Telfer?
- Yes, he finally sold it to me.

148
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,479
The day before he killed himself.

149
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,630
That was good timing.

150
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,272
Silentium est aureum.

151
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,998
"Silence is golden."

152
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,798
Precisely.

153
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,235
Ever heard of the Delomelanicon?

154
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,517
I've heard of it.
It's a myth, isn't it?

155
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,319
A book reputed to have been
written by Satan.

156
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,868
No myth. That book existed.

157
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,996
Torchia actually acquired it.

158
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,915
The engravings you are now admiring
were adapted by Torchia

159
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,718
from the Delomelanicon.

160
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,759
They form a kind of Satanic riddle.

161
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,071
Correctly interpreted
with the aid of the original text,

162
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,836
they're reputed to conjure up
the Prince of Darkness in person.

163
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,876
You don't say?

164
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,996
Are you a religious man, Mr Corso?

165
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,913
I mean, do you believe
in the supernatural?

166
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,036
I believe in my percentage.

167
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,154
Don't you get dizzy standing there?

168
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,110
What is it
that you want from me, Balkan?

169
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,435
I want you to go to Europe
and investigate.

170
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,752
The other two copies
are in Portugal and France.

171
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,593
Compare them with mine -
every page, every engraving,

172
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,636
the binding, everything.

173
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,154
I'm convinced only one is authentic.

174
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,196
That could be expensive.

175
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,549
That's to get you started.
Spend what you need.

176
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,552
What if I find your copy's a forgery?

177
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,438
- It's quite possible.
- Really?

178
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,116
It doesn't appear to be.

179
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,436
Even the paper sounds kosher.

180
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,159
Even so... there's something wrong.

181
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,196
The devil won't show up?

182
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,914
If all three copies are bogus or
incomplete, your work will be done.

183
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,197
But if one is genuine,
I'll finance you further.

184
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,193
I want you to get it for me.
At all costs.

185
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,193
- Never mind how.
- "Never mind how" sounds illegal.

186
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,430
It wouldn't be your first time.

187
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,399
- Not that illegal.
- Hence the size of the cheque.

188
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,316
Do a good job, I'll double it.

189
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,794
There's got to be something wrong if
you're letting it out of your hands.

190
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,632
I have faith in you, Mr Corso.

191
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,392
Nothing is more reliable

192
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,189
than a man whose loyalty
can be bought for hard cash.

193
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,874
Good morning. I'm Dean Corso.

194
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,475
I'm terribly sorry to disturb you
at a time like this.

195
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,231
It would be very helpful...

196
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,518
if you could tell me
what you know about this book.

197
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,431
- Isn't this one of my husband's?
- Right.

198
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,115
He recently sold it
to a client of mine.

199
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,749
- I'm trying to authenticate it.
- He sold it, you say?

200
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,310
How strange. This was one
of his most treasured possessions.

201
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,551
- He never mentioned the sale?
- No. It's news to me.

202
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,198
- Who bought it?
- A private collector.

203
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,157
May I know his name?

204
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,152
I'm afraid that's confidential.

205
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,437
- I suppose he has a bill of sale?
- No problem there.

206
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,512
Is this your job?
Authenticating rare books?

207
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,556
And tracking them down, yes.

208
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,437
You're a book detective.

209
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,476
Kind of.

210
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,478
Do you recall when and where
your husband acquired this book?

211
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,835
In Spain,

212
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,434
when we were vacationing at Toledo.

213
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,513
Andrew got very excited.
He paid a great deal of money for it.

214
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,116
- He was a fanatical collector.
- So I gather.

215
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,188
I'll show you.

216
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,078
It's impressive.

217
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,833
Andrew used to spend
many hours in here.

218
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,753
- Too many.

219
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,592
Did he ever try it out?

220
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,148
I don't understand.

221
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,153
The book, did he use it to perform
some kind of ritual

222
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,073
intended to produce
a supernatural effect?

223
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,991
Are you serious?

224
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,877
Yes, absolutely.

225
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,679
Andrew was a trifle eccentric,
Mr Corso,

226
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,354
but he wasn't insane.

227
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,238
It's true he'd been acting...

228
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,232
strangely, those last few days.

229
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,199
He shut himself in here,
seldom emerged except for meals.

230
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,910
That morning I was awoken...
by the screams of the maid.

231
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,910
He'd hanged himself.

232
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,396
Whatever he was up to, I certainly
can't see him chanting mumbo jumbo

233
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,436
or trying to raise the dead.

234
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,476
The devil, Mrs Telfer.

235
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,313
This book is designed
to raise the devil.

236
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,956
Sic luceat lux.

237
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,315
"Thus did the light shine."

238
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,592
Son of a bitch,
where did you get this?

239
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,309
Balkan,
wants me to research it.

240
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,119
Balkan owns a Nine Gates?

241
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,953
Acquired from the late Andrew Telfer.

242
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,272
Trust Balkan. What does he need
you for? Does he plan to sell it?

243
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,112
He wants me to compare it

244
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,670
with the other surviving copies
which are in Portugal and France.

245
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,830
I'm off to Europe.

246
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,353
Compare it?

247
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,479
Yeah. 0nly one of the three's
authentic, he says.

248
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,915
This looks genuine enough.

249
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,355
Christ, it's gotta be worth
a million.

250
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,032
Take care of it.

251
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,271
That's why I'm here.
I need you to stash it for me.

252
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,035
- Cos I'm starting to see things.
- Like what?

253
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,429
Uninvited visitors, unfamiliar faces.

254
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,080
I don't trust anyone,
not even Balkan.

255
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,390
I'm not even sure I trust you.

256
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,836
You know I wouldn't screw you
unless there was a good reason.

257
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,754
Money, women, business...
0ther than that you can relax.

258
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,559
I'll pick it up
on my way to the airport.

259
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,789
Sure.

260
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,269
These engravings are terrific.

261
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,432
0r horrific, whichever.

262
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,069
Sensational. Absolutely sensational.

263
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,840
- May I come in?
- Mm-hm.

264
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,191
Please, sit down.

265
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,437
- I've come to talk business.
- Mm-hm.

266
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,308
Yesterday, when you came
to see me about that book,

267
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,391
I was too surprised to react
as I should have done.

268
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,869
It was one of Andrew's favourites.

269
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,837
So you said.

270
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,275
I'd like to get it back.

271
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,831
- That could be a problem.
- It all depends.

272
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,354
- 0n what?
- 0n you.

273
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,238
I don't understand,
the book is not mine.

274
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,191
You work for money, I take it?

275
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,475
- What else?
- I have a great deal of money.

276
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,312
I'm very happy for you.

277
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,870
Stage a theft. I imagine
your client is well insured.

278
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,872
- I'm a professional.
- A professional mercenary.

279
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,076
You work for the highest bidder.

280
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,277
- I make a living.
- I could throw in a bonus.

281
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,399
- This has happened before someplace.
- In the movies.

282
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,153
She had an automatic in her stocking.

283
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,792
No automatic.

284
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,474
- Would you like a drink?
- Why not?

285
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,311
0K, where is it?

286
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,675
Where's what?

287
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,876
Don't fuck with me!

288
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,590
I thought I already did.

289
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,874
0w!

290
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,919
Ahh... Ah! Wait, wait!

291
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,479
Take it easy!

292
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,073
'You have reached
Bernie's Rare Books,

293
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,550
'please leave a message
after the tone.'

294
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,596
Bernie... are you there?

295
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,916
Pick up.

296
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,272
Bernie!

297
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,750
Give me a minute, I won't be long.

298
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,796
You can take me on to Kennedy.

299
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,836
No problem, sir.

300
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,999
Bernie?

301
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,312
Bernie!

302
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,152
0h, Jesus!

303
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,116
Jesus Christ...

304
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,432
Bernie...

305
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,830
No problem?

306
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,636
Stop. Stop at that phone booth.
Pull over.

307
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,392
No problem, sir.

308
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,074
'He isn't available.
Who's calling? '

309
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,355
- Dean Corso.
- 'Any message? '

310
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,194
- I have to talk with him at once.
- 'I'm afraid he's in transit.'

311
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,590
'Lf you leave your number
I'll have him return.'

312
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,752
No, I am in a phone booth.
It's an emergency.

313
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,070
I have to speak with him right now.

314
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,720
Right now, you hear me? Right now.

315
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,472
'0ne moment.'

316
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,394
- 'Are you there, Mr Corso? '
- Yes.

317
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,436
'I'll put you through.'

318
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,679
- 'What have you got? '
- More than I bargained for.

319
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,149
- 'What do you mean? '
- I mean I quit.

320
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,708
I'll return the book. Where are you?

321
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,793
'I'm disappointed, Mr Corso.
You've never let me down before.'

322
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,871
Well, this is different.

323
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,757
Remember Bernie Armstein?

324
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,149
- 'Armstein? '
- Yeah.

325
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,358
I gave him your book to stash for me.
Now he's dead. Murdered.

326
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,557
- 'Because of the book? '
- What else?

327
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,189
'I never said it would be easy.
If it's a question of money... '

328
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,396
It isn't the money, I want out.

329
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,190
'This matter means a great deal
to me. I'm not an ungenerous man.

330
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,032
'Proceed as arranged.

331
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,669
- 'Tack another zero onto your fee.'

332
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,830
Hey, where are you?

333
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,672
Balkan?

334
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,352
Balkan?!

335
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,194
- You speak English?
- Yes, I do.

336
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,556
I would like to get
your opinion on this.

337
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,429
What a habit for a bookbinder.

338
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,114
A Nine Gates, superb edition.

339
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,237
Very rare. The Telfer copy.

340
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,517
- Yes. You used to own it, right?
- Used to.

341
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,990
We sold it when
the opportunity presented itself.

342
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,436
- It was too good...
- To miss. An excellent sale.

343
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,829
An excellent buy.
Impeccable condition.

344
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,480
Impeccable.
Are you the present owner?

345
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,471
No, a client of mine.

346
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,950
I would never have believed
she would part with it.

347
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,270
- She?
- Mrs Telfer.

348
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,839
Uh-huh.

349
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,390
I understood
that Mr Telfer bought it.

350
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,232
He paid for it.

351
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,550
Mrs Telfer made him buy it.

352
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,393
- He didn't seem particularly...
- Interested.

353
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,596
An exceptional specimen.

354
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,036
- Could it be a forgery?
- Forgery? Hear that, Pablo?

355
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,908
I thought you were a professional.
You speak too lightly of forgeries.

356
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,039
- Far too lightly.
- Forging a book is very expensive.

357
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,398
Paper of the period, right inks...
Too expensive to be profitable.

358
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,994
- Still, it can be done.
- 0f course.

359
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,435
It requires a great skill, but yes.

360
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,432
- Could that be the case here?
- What makes you ask?

361
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,116
My client wishes to satisfy himself
on the book's authenticity.

362
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,236
Boris Balkan of New York.

363
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,029
- 0Id books have their own destiny.
- And their own life.

364
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,634
Mr Balkan is a celebrated collector.

365
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,190
He's no fool.
He must know this book is authentic.

366
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,272
We know it,
we've had this book for years.

367
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,432
- Many years.
- Ample opportunity to study it.

368
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,078
The painting, binding,

369
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,392
a magnificent example of 17th century
Venetian craftsmanship.

370
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,439
Finest paper,
resistant to the passage of time.

371
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,875
None of your modern wood pulp.

372
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,713
Watermarks, ink, typefaces.

373
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,510
If this is a forgery or a copy
with missing pages restored,

374
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,114
- it's the work of a master.
- A master.

375
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,398
Yes. Have you studied the engravings?
They seem to have some...

376
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,233
- underlying significance.
- 0f course.

377
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,108
For example, this one
could be interpreted as a warning.

378
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,274
Venture too far, it says, and danger
will descend on you from above.

379
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,318
These books
often contain little puzzles.

380
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,960
Especially with such a collaborator.

381
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,598
Collaborator?

382
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,672
You have not proceeded far
in your research.

383
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,752
Look close, and you see?

384
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,799
0nly six of the nine engravings
were signed by Aristide Torchia.

385
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,950
Yes, and the other three?

386
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,679
This is one of them.

387
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,557
L-C-F.

388
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,756
Who was LCF?

389
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,592
Think.

390
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,993
Lucifer?

391
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,995
Very perceptive of you, signor.

392
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,868
Torchia was burnt alive
because he wrote this book

393
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,235
in collaboration with someone else.

394
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,470
You can't honestly believe...

395
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,552
The man who wrote this book
saw an alliance with the devil

396
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,551
and went to the stake for it.

397
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,915
Even Hell has its heroes, signor.

398
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,760
- I've seen you before.
- Have you?

399
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,435
- Yes.
- Are you travelling in this car?

400
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,158
The next one.

401
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,676
The sleeper. I travel on the cheap.

402
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,149
You a student?

403
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,196
Something like that.

404
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,236
I like trains.

405
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,232
- Trains I'm on?
- Just trains.

406
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,317
What's your name?

407
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,356
Guess.

408
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,591
- Green-eyes?
- That'll do.

409
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,875
- What's yours?
- Corso.

410
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,837
Strange name.

411
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,831
Italian. It means "run".

412
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,275
You don't look like a runner to me.

413
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,430
More the quiet type.

414
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,238
Well, give my regards to Balkan.

415
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,356
Tell him I'm doing my best.

416
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,318
- Balkan?
- Never mind.

417
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,391
See you around.

418
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,436
Maybe?

419
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,030
I wouldn't be surprised.

420
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,754
Sí?

421
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,354
Dean Corso, Mr Fargas.

422
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,876
Corso...? 0h, yes. Please, come in.

423
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,712
Thank you.

424
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,871
Please...

425
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,476
Home, sweet home.

426
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,756
You won't say no to a brandy,
I take it?

427
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,796
Thank you very much.

428
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,793
Thank you.

429
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,596
What handsome glasses.

430
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,240
They're the only ones I have left.

431
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,514
Hmm, must have been
a beautiful place.

432
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,754
It was. But old families
are like ancient civilisations.

433
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,796
They wither and die.

434
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,636
There they are, eight hundred
and thirty-four of them.

435
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,792
A pity you didn't see them
in better times.

436
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,438
I used to have 5,000.

437
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,715
But these are the survivors.

438
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,633
So this is
the Fargas collection?

439
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,154
Not quite as I imagined it,
I must say.

440
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,992
C'est la vie, my friend.

441
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,790
But I keep them in perfect condition,
safe from damp, light, heat, rats.

442
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,030
I dust and air them every day.

443
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,918
These are the occult.
What do you think?

444
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,752
Not bad.

445
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,673
Not bad indeed.
At least ten are extremely rare.

446
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,718
Here,
Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal.

447
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,638
First edition, 1844.

448
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,589
Leonardo Fioravantis'
Compendi di Secreti, 1571.

449
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,678
And there it is,

450
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,716
in perfect condition.

451
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,710
It has travelled the world
for three and a half centuries

452
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,473
but might have been
printed yesterday.

453
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,269
Is it in order? You haven't
detected anything unusual?

454
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,238
No, the text is complete,
engravings too.

455
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,790
Nine, plus the title page,
as the catalogue states,

456
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,350
like the Kessler in Paris
and the Telfer in New York.

457
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,956
Yes. It isn't the Telfer any more.
Telfer killed himself.

458
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,157
But he sold his copy
to Boris Balkan first.

459
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:51,189
0h, Balkan... If he sets his heart
on a book, no price is too high.

460
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,398
Not that I would ever sell this one.
Not at any price.

461
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,516
It's, er...

462
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,276
It's strange that he should have sent
you here if he already had...

463
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,712
You have it here?

464
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,596
May I see it?

465
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,996
Ahh, superb.

466
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,991
Beautiful.

467
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,355
Identical.

468
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,954
Two of the only three
to escape the flames,

469
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,510
reunited for the first time
in over three centuries.

470
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,160
Ahh, yes...

471
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,879
Look at this
slight imperfection here.

472
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,590
The damaged "s", the same type,
the same impression.

473
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,352
Incredible.

474
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,678
And if it weren't for this slight
discolouration on the back of yours,

475
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,194
no one could tell them apart.

476
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,272
If you don't mind,
I'd like to stay for a while

477
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,271
and examine them in detail.

478
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,159
- What are you looking for, Mr Corso?
- I'm not quite sure.

479
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,799
Some books are dangerous.
Not to be opened with impunity.

480
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,916
That's very true.

481
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,951
I'll be damned.

482
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,989
Hello, again.
You didn't say you were coming here.

483
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,433
Neither did you.

484
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,034
- What are you doing?
- Reading.

485
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,872
I can see that.

486
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,269
And bumping into people.
Unexpectedly.

487
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,352
Yes, unexpectedly's right.

488
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:11,434
Are you on a business trip? Is that
why you always carry that thing?

489
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,233
- Is this part of your course?
- My course?

490
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,153
Winning Friends
And Influencing People.

491
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,071
You said you were a student.

492
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,914
Did I? So I am, in a way.

493
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,159
I like books. Do you?

494
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,271
You been travelling long?

495
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,191
A while.

496
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,748
- Ever travel by motorbike?
- Signor?

497
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,071
- Excuse me, signor, telefono.
- Me? You're sure?

498
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,718
Sí, signor. Sí, signor.

499
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,878
Yes?

500
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,712
'Mr Corso? '

501
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,156
- My God, how'd you find me?
- 'Made any progress? '

502
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,913
- Yeah, you could call it that.
- 'Well? '

503
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,357
I can't talk, I'm in the lobby.
Let me call you back. Where are you?

504
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,149
'Never mind that, get them
to transfer it to your room.'

505
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,993
0h, right. Signor? Signor, pardon me.

506
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,913
- Could you send this to my room?
- Yes, sir.

507
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,237
You still there?

508
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,231
- 'Yes.'
- All right.

509
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,279
I've examined the Fargas copy,
it looks authentic enough.

510
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,432
It's like yours,
but there are discrepancies.

511
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,238
'Discrepancies? '

512
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,232
The engravings,
they're not identical.

513
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,834
Things like keys in different hands,

514
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,595
doorways open in one copy
and bricked up in the other.

515
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,399
- And another thing.
- 'Yes? Yes, go on.'

516
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,836
The ones that differ
aren't signed Torchia.

517
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,876
They're signed "LCF".

518
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,520
- You still there?
- 'LCF'?

519
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,591
Listen, where are you anyway?

520
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,559
'I must have that copy, Mr Corso.
Get it for me.'

521
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,599
The old man wouldn't sell it
to save his life. He said as much.

522
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,432
'Did he? '

523
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,792
Hello? Hello?!

524
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,436
Just a minute!

525
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,673
Yeah?

526
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,676
- W-what time is it?
- Early, but you have to go.

527
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,115
Go? Go where?

528
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,236
- Fargas' place.
- I've seen Fargas.

529
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,869
- You should see him again.
- Is this some kind of joke?

530
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,431
- What do you know about Fargas?
- Get dressed. I'll wait outside.

531
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:08,073
- Don't bother. He isn't there.

532
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,151
0h, really? Then where is he?

533
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,992
0ver there.

534
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,474
God Almighty.

535
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,838
Wanna get inside?

536
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,798
I had thought about it, yes.

537
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,315
You wait here.

538
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,273
Shit.

539
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,556
Well? Did you find it?

540
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,553
You know, it's come to my attention
that you know too goddam much.

541
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,997
- Why do you keep following me?
- Don't waste time asking questions.

542
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,469
There's a flight to Paris at noon.

543
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,676
- We should just make it.
- "We"?

544
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,318
There are two of us.

545
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,914
What happened back there?

546
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,273
The old man
caught someone stealing, I guess.

547
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,796
- What do you guess happened to him?
- He drowned.

548
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,838
- With help from who?
- He's dead, who cares?

549
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,879
I do.
I could easily wind up the same way.

550
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,918
Not with me around to look after you.

551
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,434
0h, I see,
you're my guardian angel

552
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,511
If you say so.

553
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,835
Someone's playing a game with me.

554
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,354
0f course, you're part of it.

555
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,908
And you're getting to like it.

556
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,151
Gardez la monnaie.

557
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,878
Hello, Gruber.

558
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,475
Hello, Mr Corso.
Delighted to see you again.

559
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,994
We don't have any vacancies but...

560
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,719
I'm sure I can organise something.

561
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,032
Thank you very much.

562
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,235
Good afternoon.

563
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:36,393
I'm Dean Corso, I have an appointment
with Baroness Kessler?

564
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,996
This way.

565
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,195
You have 30 minutes.

566
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,912
- Yes?
- Monsieur Corso.

567
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,390
0h, yes, Mr Corso. Come in.

568
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,392
I've heard a great deal about you.

569
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,596
0h. Nothing good, I hope?

570
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,716
You hope right. Merci, Simone.

571
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,758
Well, I'm reassured, Baroness.

572
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:18,834
In my trade to be spoken well of
can be professionally disastrous.

573
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,831
My God...

574
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:24,276
Yes, there it is.
The Kessler collection.

575
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,515
I know your catalogue
almost by heart.

576
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,559
Strange we haven't met before.
Your name is a byword among dealers.

577
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:38,077
But I imagine you know
your own reputation better than I do.

578
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:43,029
It does keep the wolf from the door.
I'm sorry, were you doing something?

579
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:46,078
My latest work,
The Devil: History & Myth.

580
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,755
A kind of biography.
It will be published early next year.

581
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,912
- Why the devil?
- I saw him one day.

582
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,788
I was 15 and I saw him
as plain as I see you now.

583
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,916
It was love at first sight.

584
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,959
300 years ago you'd have been
burned at the stake for that.

585
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,474
300 years ago
I wouldn't have said it.

586
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,518
Nor would I have made a million
by writing about it.

587
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,318
Yeah.

588
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,914
What do you wish to discuss,
Mr Corso?

589
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,389
There's a book I'd like to examine,

590
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,029
The Book of the Nine Gates
of the Kingdom of Shadows?

591
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,634
The Nine Gates? An interesting work.

592
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,029
Everyone's been asking lately.

593
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,953
- Is that so?
- Follow me.

594
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,390
You truly believe in the devil,
Baroness?

595
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,439
Enough to devote my life
and my library to him.

596
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,592
Not to mention many years of work.

597
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,238
Don't you?

598
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,038
Almost.

599
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,951
This book demands
a certain amount of faith.

600
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,918
I'm afraid my faith
is in short supply these days.

601
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,959
I know this work extremely well.
I've studied it for years.

602
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:58,113
- Any doubts about its authenticity?
- None whatsoever.

603
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,998
- Sure?
- My knowledge of it is profound.

604
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,275
I wrote a biography of its author.

605
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:07,399
I've read it, Aristide Torchia,
the Devil's Apprentice.

606
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,198
A courageous man.

607
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,273
He died for the sake
of this book in 1667.

608
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:18,992
While studying in Prague he acquired
a copy of the dread Delomelanicon.

609
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,719
This is Torchia's adaptation
of that work,

610
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,360
which was written by Lucifer himself.

611
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,431
After they burned him at the stake,

612
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,476
a secret society was founded

613
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,313
to perpetuate its memory
and preserve its secrets.

614
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,119
The 0rder of the Silver Serpent.

615
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,156
A sect?

616
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,196
A kind of witches' coven.

617
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,635
For centuries they have met
to read this book

618
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,551
and worship the Prince of Darkness.

619
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,632
Today they have degenerated
into a social club

620
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,280
for bored millionaires
and celebrities

621
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:53,753
who use its meetings as an excuse to
indulge their jaded sexual appetites.

622
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,434
I myself belonged to the order.

623
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,078
Years ago.

624
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,515
But time is too precious at my age.

625
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,239
Besides, my orgy days are over.

626
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,312
I told them to go to the devil.

627
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,994
You mean it's all about sex or...?

628
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:13,073
0f course not. They're under the
illusion that they owe their success

629
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,230
to membership in the order.

630
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,436
- Do they still meet?
- Every year.

631
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,718
0n the anniversary of Torchia's
death. They'll be meeting very soon.

632
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,394
- And they read from this book?
- Not this one.

633
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,792
I took mine back when Liana Telfer
acquired the one in Toledo.

634
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,032
Victor Fargas is a non-believer,
he's always refused to participate,

635
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,509
so naturally they use
the Telfer copy,

636
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,591
not that it has ever worked.

637
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,117
- Did Andrew Telfer ever take part?
- Telfer?! No, no.

638
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,476
That creature, Liana,
married him for his money.

639
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:50,350
She comes from an old, aristocratic
French family, the Saint-Martins,

640
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,317
but they were penniless

641
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,631
so Liana used his dollars
to restore her chateau

642
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,280
and buy the Nine Gates.

643
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,999
If he finds out what his wife
gets up to,

644
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,116
he'll probably kill himself.

645
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:07,352
Funny you should say that,
he hanged himself last week.

646
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,555
Who exactly are you working for,
Mr Corso?

647
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:19,156
The name is irrelevant, I'm simply
trying to authenticate his copy,

648
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,152
the one that Telfer sold him
before he died.

649
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,073
How stupid of me,
I should have guessed.

650
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,516
You've outstayed your welcome,
Mr Corso.

651
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,558
I was hoping to examine
your copy in detail.

652
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,392
Certainly not!

653
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,031
Tell your client, who can only be
Boris Balkan, to examine it himself,

654
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,315
if he dares.

655
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:45,313
Tell him not to send
any more wolves in sheep's clothing.

656
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,551
And now, kindly leave.

657
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,590
I'm... sorry if I've troubled you.
Thank you very much for your time.

658
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,116
You don't know
what you're getting into, Mr Corso.

659
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,158
Get out before it's too late.

660
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,677
I'm afraid it already is, Baroness.
Good day.
