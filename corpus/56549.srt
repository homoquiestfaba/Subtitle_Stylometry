00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,792
<i>Dre, I know you've been wanting</i>
<i>this body for a long time.</i>

2
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,165
I know you fantasize
about me.

3
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,830
You damn skippy.

4
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,601
I've been knowing you since you were
a little boy. But you know something?

5
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:44,472
I think it's time you get
what you been dreaming of.

6
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,446
Yes, indeedy.

7
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,847
Now, let me see
what we're working with.

8
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,678
You're really not
a little boy anymore.

9
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,054
You think you can handle
that, Mrs. Anderson?

10
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,525
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't get cocky with me now.

11
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,926
- I'm old enough to be your mama.
- Yes, ma'am.

12
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,329
The real question is...

13
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,993
can you handle...

14
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,003
- Damn!
- All of this?

15
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,096
Hmm? You think you can?

16
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,541
It ain't but one way
to find out.

17
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,474
Dre!

18
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,451
It's almost 9:00.
You need to wake up.

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,456
Listen. I'm gonna run some errands
and I'm gonna go by the mall.

20
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:35,483
I prepared a turkey. I want you
to put it in the oven on low, Dre.

21
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,393
Okay?

22
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,500
You ain't got to worry with that, baby.
I helped make that one.

23
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,368
- Ma!
- You're a lot like your daddy.

24
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,339
He called.
Said he was gonna come by.

25
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,172
- Yes, ma'am.
- You know what my rule is.

26
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,734
Yes, ma'am.

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,075

Now, back to
your mama, A.J.

52
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,662
We need to get off of mamas
'cause I just got off of yours.

53
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,393
- Old-ass joke.
- Whatever.

54
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,594
- I didn't do nothing.
- Take it easy, asshole.

55
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,763
Nobody did nothing, right?

56
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,897
- I told you I didn't do nothing, man.
- What do we got here?

57
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,374
- Suspect in the armored truck crash.
- We're taking him to the precinct.

58
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,241
Yeah, exactly.
You were. Okay?

59
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,146
- Now, take a hike.
- Thank you. We'll take him from here.

60
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,514
- Go fetch yourself a mop.
- Asshole, man.

61
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,351
- Unbelievable.
- Look at his face.

62
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,130
Come on, guys.
Let's go to a strip joint.

63
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,463
- So what we doing today?
- Same thing we did yesterday.

64
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,800
Just stand out here
and talk about everybody.

65
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,271

- Nothing you need to know about, Boom.

68
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,237
Yeah, Boom, get your freaky ass
on away from here, man.

69
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,442

Your mama's a freaky ass.

70
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,213
- What the hell you want, Boom?
- Let me see.

71
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,813
My fortune tells me
that I wanted a big dick...

72
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,222
but obviously I don't
see one around here.

73
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,624
Click, click.

74
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,721
So, did you eat the last penis
they gave you?

75
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,788
Hey, Boom,
seriously, though, man...

76
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,800
I would let you use mine...

77
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,166
but Earl mama
using it right now.

78
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,899
See, you likes to play funny,
but just to let you know...

79
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,464
you wouldn't know what a big dick
look like if you woke up with one.

80
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,477
I'm sorry.
Click, click.

81
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,946
Probably looks like the one
that's always in your mouth.

82
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:29,180
- I heard the police was over here.
- You heard wrong.

83
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,456
I don't know what's so funny.
Where is your sister?

84
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,324
I don't know.
What you want with my sister?

85
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,954
Don't trip.

86
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,488
Sometimes you go through a close family
member to get what you really want.

87
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,937
Click, click.

88
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:57,176
Now, we know you grabbed a bundle
of cash from the armored truck crash.

89
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,309
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You just run from the site...

90
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,319
of an armored truck crash
every day?

91
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:05,255
- Lf one crashes every day.
- You hear that? He's a fucking comedian.

92
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,792
Why did you run if you
didn't grab any money?

93
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,794
To be honest with you,
I was out on my daily jog...

94
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,626
- and I ran past the accident.
- Your daily jog, huh?

95
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,632
- Hey, man!
- Tell me about that daily jog!

96
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,168
- Relax!
- You need to control your monkey, man.

97
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,228
- I know my rights.
- Shut up! We're not through with you.

98
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,434
I looked at your rap sheet. We can
keep you here for a couple of days...

99
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,468
or you can cooperate and be out
of here in a few minutes.

100
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,806
- Huh?
- Man, y'all some crooked cops.

101
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,147
I'm not saying nothing
until I get my phone call.

102
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,414
You're gonna get your
phone call from jail.

103
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,649
Son of a bitch.

104
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,621
You and Boom look like
y'all make a good couple anyway.

105
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,754
Man, y'all make
a good couple of nuts.

106
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,929
What's up, fellas?

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,367
- Nothing.
- Now that you hiding the sun.

108
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,997
Otis, we needed
some shade.

109
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,667
Yeah, that's a little jokey-joke
'cause I'm a little overweight.

110
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,040
Hey, Otis, ain't nothing little
about you, bro.

111
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,342
- Yeah, your mama must've told you that.
- Please stay off my mama.

112
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,349
And why is
my mail open?

113
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,578
It's just a little check
for your family to smoke up.

114
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,847
At least we smoking weed
and not turkey.

115
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,754
That's real funny. But what you need
to do is put some lotion on you.

116
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,917
I've seen volcanoes
ain't that ashy.

117
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,425
- Stop. Man, ain't nobody...
- There's your little piece of mail too.

118
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,432
Guess what.
Your grandmama died.

119
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,968
- Oh, man. How did that happen?
- She drowned.

120
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,900
Sorry to hear
that, Earl, man.

121
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,905
Well, shit happens.

122
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,942
I told her,
"Take showers." "Take showers."

123
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,773
Hold up. This ain't for me, Otis.
This is for 1508.

124
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,870
I'm at 1580, fat ass.

125
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,381
You got me crying over
somebody else's grandmama, man.

126
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,384
Shit. My bad.
Y'all all look the same to me.

127
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,286
- Get your fat ass away from here.
- Stop reading people mail too.

128
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,984
Well, guess what. Next time it might
really be for one of y'all.

129
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,117
And it could be
for that chili dog too.

130
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,594
- Man, ain't that illegal?
- Yeah.

131
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,154
I need to take
his round ass to court.

132
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,666
Why, so they can arrest you
for your warrants?

133
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,761
- He got a point.
- Yeah, that's true.

134
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,102
- True dat, man.
- You better come correct.

135
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,435
Well, hey, Shamu.

136
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,944
How you doing, Moses?
What, you ain't dead yet?

137
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,447
I'll live to bury
your fat ass.

138
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,574
At least I ain't late.

139
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,814
Didn't they tell you when they made you
a mailman, you was gonna have to walk?

140
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,117
Yeah, at least
I don't need a walker.

141
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,123
- Funny.
- Here's your mail.

142
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,751
Give me my stuff.
Give me my stuff.

143
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:25,490
Hey! Look at this.
Look at this. Look at this.

144
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,467
The Clearinghouse sweepstakes.
I'm gonna be a rich son of a bitch.

145
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,526
Won't even have you
for a mailman no more...

146
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,004
- 'cause I'm gonna be up on the hill.
- Guess what.

147
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,837
You didn't win.

148
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,174
Son of a bitch. I told you not
to be reading my mail.

149
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,180
You think someone's
sending me food?

150
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,240
Guess what. If they did,
you ain't gonna get it.

151
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,685
- Yeah, I believe that.
- You need to read that bill there...

152
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,484
'cause your lights
about to be turned out.

153
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,117
And you better read it while you can.
'Cause it's gonna be dark soon.

154
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,853
Son of a bitch.

155
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:03,391
Get out of here, you fat fuck.
Get out of here.

156
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,861
Oh, yeah.

157
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,501
Wonder if he got
a dog up in here.

158
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,447
Damn boogers.

159
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,893
Movin' day. Movin' day.

160
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,234
This boy needs
some roughage.

161
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,939
What's this?

162
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,941
Glove.

163
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,943
Knife.

164
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,447
Damn O.J.
O.J. been in the trash.

165
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,910
Another box full of nothing.
Look at this.

166
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,680
Just nothing but junk.
My goodness. What's in here?

167
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,291
Jesus!

168
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,354
God Almighty!

169
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,561
This is my day, baby.

170
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,265
- What the hell you doing back here?
- Nothin'.

171
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,831
- Get your ass up out my backyard.
- All right.

172
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,810
- Up in my trash. Man, go on!
- Go on back in the house.

173
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,575
- Get your ass out my backyard.
- I'm gettin' out.

174
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,575
- Man, fuck you!
- Mess with me...

175
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,484
I'm gonna stomp a nut in your ass,
old baby shit-colored nigga.

176
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,853
Kick your nuts up around your chin,
make a bow tie.

177
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,256
Get in the house!

178
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,589
- You a baby shit!
- Your mama!

179
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,063
- Look at that.
- See that?

180
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,335
It's... That's why I don't live
in the neighborhood.

181
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,035
How did you get out
of the neighborhood?

182
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,011
I never was
in the neighborhood, you know?

183
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,014
But that's
a good reason why.

184
00:11:56,082 --> 00:12:00,416
It's garbage. The pants are hanging
halfway down by their assholes.

185
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,351
That's ridiculous.
Fashion. That's fashion?

186
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,447
That's considered a fash... It's
a fashion faux pas. That's what it is.

187
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,458
That's bullshit.
That's what I say.

188
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,359
- It's all ghetto mentality.
- Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto.

189
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,964
- Hey, Dre, what you lookin' for?
- Nothin'.

190
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,435
Well, can I help you find
whatever you lookin' for?

191
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,972
No, you can't.
Thank you, Boom.

192
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,372
Why you up
so early anyway, man?

193
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,707
My mama talkin' about kicking me out
the house at the end of the month.

194
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,146
- Why?
- Well, she got this new boyfriend.

195
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,208
And he just... he ain't comfortable
with another man in the house.

196
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,482
But see, that's cool 'cause I done
heard that before, so it's all right.

197
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,489
Well, what you gonna do?

198
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,958
See, I got a cousin that lives in D.C.,
all the way over there somewhere.

199
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:45,463
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong with D.C.?

200
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:50,059
Ain't nothin' wrong with D.C. It's
a party town. I'm, like, do your thing.

201
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,696
I like to get my boogie on,
so, you know, it's cool.

202
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,640
Other than the fact that I ain't got
the money, and the plane ticket's $600.

203
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,974
$600 for a plane... You can get
a plane ticket for 250 in coach easy.

204
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,013
Coach? I know you didn't
say "coach" to me...

205
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,743
'cause I'm a queen bee bitch
and I fly first class.

206
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,150
- You should know, Dre.
- Well, catch the bus, Boom.

207
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,815
A bus? A bus is 36 hours,
plus I'm "clausaphobia."

208
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,019
- It's "claustrophobic," Boom.
- Well, whatever you wanna call it.

209
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,562
You know what
I'm tryin' to say, Dre.

210
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,829
- What do you want, Boom?
- Have you seen Tasha?

211
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,427
No. Why don't
you ask Slim?

212
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,768
I've already asked Slim,
but he ain't even seen her either.

213
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,777
- Lf he ain't seen her, I ain't seen her.
- Are you going to the block party?

214
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:39,713
- I don't know. I might.
- Good. I'll see you there then, right?

215
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,946
Maybe, Boom.

216
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,288
Okay, Boom.

217
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,991
Okay, Boom.

218
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,739
Man, who this?

219
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,140
Look, don't worry
about who this is.

220
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,146
Oh, hey, sorry about that, Diggs.
Hey, man, this is Mike.

221
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,148
Yeah, Mike
from Crenshaw, dog.

222
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,150
I'm gonna handle that
for you, man.

223
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,517
I swear to God I'm gonna handle
your business for you.

224
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,318
Yeah. Hold on.

225
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,790
- Hey, is there a Tome in here?
- I'm Tome.

226
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,794
- One of you fools Tome?
- I'm Tome.

227
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,830
- Come get the phone, Toby.
- Who is it?

228
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,889
Man, don't worry about who it is.
Just come get the phone, fool.

229
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:33,070
- Hello.
- Where is it?

230
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,630
- Where's what?
- I will have you killed right now...

231
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,643
and be out tomorrow
celebrating your death.

232
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,179
- Don't fuck with me.
- Man, you said I had a week.

233
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,375
I said you had a week.
Well, I lied, asshole.

234
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,509
I heard you came
into some money.

235
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,952
- Who told you that?
- Don't fucking worry about who told me.

236
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,990
Where's my fucking money,
motherfucker?

237
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,992
Well, they lied to you.
You know how people be lying.

238
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,463
Listen to me, motherfucker.
Turn your ass around.

239
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,829
<i>Now, you see that big</i>
<i>motherfucker looking at you?</i>

240
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,636
Wave.

241
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,935
That's right. Now, where is
my motherfucking money?

242
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:16,914
- <i>If I tell you, you'll kill me.</i>
- If you don't, I'll have you killed.

243
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,008
Baby, if you're gonna sit on my car,
give it a little buff.

244
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,610
There you go.
A little to the right.

245
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,452
You looking good, baby.
You looking good. Where's my money, man?

246
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:29,153
My lawyer said I'll be out in a few
hours. Then I'll give you what I owe.

247
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,629
I want my money. I want my money.
I'm gonna be on my spot.

248
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,724
You get my money to me
by midnight tonight or that's your ass.

249
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,794
All right, man, cool. So I'll talk
to you when I get out, all right?

250
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,705
- I'm gonna be right here.
- All right, cool.

251
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,541
Baby, baby.

252
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,602
Give it a little buff. You ain't doing
nothing else. You looking all good.

253
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,707
You got your fingers all over it.
Baby, come on now.

254
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,908
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, Tasha. It's Dre.</i>

255
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,449
Oh, it's you.
What do you want?

256
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,082
I was thinking it was a pretty nice day
today. Maybe we could go to the park.

257
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,384
- Didn't I just see you yesterday?
- <i>Yeah, but you know</i>...

258
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,723
- Hello.
- <i>Yo, Cisco.</i>

259
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,225
Tome? A.J. said
you got arrested, man.

260
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,989
- <i>I did.</i>
- Aw, damn. Hey, man, where you at?

261
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,657
Don't worry about all that right now.
I need you to do something for me.

262
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:17,065
<i>Go to Dre's backyard and get a brown</i>
<i>paper bag I put in his trash can.</i>

263
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,161
Brown paper bag?
What it look like?

264
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,172
What you mean,
what does it look like?

265
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,731
It's a paper bag. It's brown.
It's made of paper.

266
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,246
- It got $20,000 in it.
- You got $20,000 in a brown paper bag?

267
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,474
Man, you got to give me
half or something.

268
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:34,013
When you get it, take it to your house.
I should be out in a few hours.

269
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,849
All right, man. Cool.

270
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,823
- Yeah.
- Phone check, punk.

271
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,623
Handle that for me, man.
I'll get back to you. Bye.

272
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,535
Mother...

273
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:01,470
- Hey, Boom, didn't I tell your ass...
- Boom? Oh, it's like that.

274
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,038
Boom was in the back...
Man, whatever. Whatever, man.

275
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,313
- Don't ask, don't tell.
- You got my mail?

276
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,048
- Yeah. Here you go.
- Give me my damn mail.

277
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,592
You didn't read
my shit again, did you?

278
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,890
Nah, nah.
Your stuf<i>f'</i>s boring.

279
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,795
But I might start
reading it soon.

280
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:21,965
Fat...

281
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,731
Oh, okay.
Finally. The check.

282
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,044
'Bout time.

283
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:08,547
<i>Get it, player</i>
<i>Get it, player</i>

284
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,344
<i>Get it, player</i>
<i>Get it, player</i>

285
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:14,112
- <i>Get it, player, get it, player</i>
- Break it down.

286
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,355
Take that down there. Y'all in front
of my house. Take it down there.

287
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,365
You know what, man?
You need to get some color.

288
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,629
I know you ain't talking about color,
with your blotchy-face ass.

289
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,241
Hey, brother,
I know you ain't laughing.

290
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,243
Your big brother called,
said he want his shirt back.

291
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,370
Dre, I know
you ain't baggin'...

292
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,882
- with your old skinny ass.
- I know you ain't talking about skinny.

293
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,909
- Look like you bench-pressing backwards
- Get off me, you old freak.

294
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,651
Dre, come here, man!

295
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,715
Your boyfriend's calling.

296
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:58,126
Watch your mouth with that boyfriend
stuff. I'll knock out the front.

297
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,598
- Man, watch the teeth.
- He's right about your teeth.

298
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,101
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

299
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,104
What you doing
hanging out with them bums?

300
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,606
I ain't hanging out with them. I'm
trying to get them away from my house.

301
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,836
- They're lowering my property value.
- If you got beef with them cats...

302
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,971
- just say the word.
- I will beat their ass my damn self.

303
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,141
Okay? Look at Slim.

304
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,913
- All of them.
- Losers, man.

305
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,853
- You still going to the block party?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

306
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:27,085
Guess what. I got a little
something something in the mail today.

307
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,855
- What?
- Come by later. I'll let you know.

308
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,987
- Come on, dog. I'll tell you later on.
- All right.

309
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,328
- I'm about to whup some ass right now.
- Handle your business.

310
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,594
Hey, show me
how you do it.

311
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,669
Y'all still here?
I done told y'all, man...

312
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,174
- y'all need to move down.
- Man, you don't own this property.

313
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,371
I own this foot that I'm gonna
put in your ass if y'all don't move.

314
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,778
- Nobody scared of you, Dre.
- First of all...

315
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,782
you need to get
a chest for that shirt.

316
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,875
- So now move.
- Forget you, man.

317
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,648
Move. Move.

318
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,984
Move.

319
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,718
Hey, Dre, you kinda punk,
you know that?

320
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,489
Move. There's a job application
out there waiting for y'all.

321
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,497
Four of'em.

322
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,829
Ignorant mother... Why...
I hate this. I hate this.

323
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,440
Why is everybody
in Dre's trash can?

324
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,241
- What you talking about "everybody"?
- First it was Dre, now it's you.

325
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,838
What's the deal, Cisco?

326
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,407
- Dre was in these trash cans?
- Hello. I just said that, didn't I?

327
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,579
- I guess you're not listening to me.
- Oh, man.

328
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,522
Then you must think
I'm some damn fool or something.

329
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,924
Don't even answer that.
What's the deal, Cisco?

330
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,929
- Could you keep a secret, man?
- Yes, I can keep a secret.

331
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:42,194
'Cause last Thursday Miss Geraldine
had a big ol' thing on her hip...

332
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,201
she fell off
and burnt her ass up.

333
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,567
If you can keep this secret,
I'm gonna keep you in on this.

334
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,868
- I'll cut you a little of the money.
- Mon...

335
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,137
Oh, yes. Mum's the word. I'm cool
with it. What's up? How much is it?

336
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,043
I swear to God, if you tell anybody,
it's gonna be your ass.

337
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:58,082
You got my word.
What's up? What's the deal?

338
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,051
My cousin took a bag of money
and put it in one of these trash cans.

339
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,316
But it ain't here right now.
I think Dre might have taken it.

340
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,823
What makes you think
your cousin ain't got the money?

341
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,826
'Cause he ain't no thief.
He don't be stealing like that.

342
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,828
So why he hide it
back here?

343
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:15,265
I don't know. But I think
he took without even asking.

344
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,700
- How am I supposed to...
- Hey, hey, man!

345
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,068
- What are y'all doing back here?
- Nothin', man.

346
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:24,575
Well, you need to take y'all
doing-nothin' asses out my backyard.

347
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,407
Fool, I done told you once.
You better get gone.

348
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,448
Man, get off my fence.
Man, you crazy?

349
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,746
- Go on, Boom.
- I like your shirt.

350
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,117
Man! Damn!

351
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,918
<i>69.9 KNUT, the station</i>
<i>all in your mouth.</i>

352
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,984
<i>PJ. Butter. We found the suspect who</i>
<i>took the money from the armored truck.</i>

353
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,826
<i>But he don't got the money. We got</i>
<i>some missing money out there, y'all.</i>

354
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,526
<i>If you find it, why don't you break</i>
<i>me off a little something something...</i>

355
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,069
<i>and maybe I'll take you in my limo</i>
<i>to the block party, all right?</i>

356
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,332
<i>Till then, bump your head to this.</i>
<i>Break ya neck.</i>

357
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,136
<i>69.9 KNUT,</i>
<i>the station in your mouth.</i>

358
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,345
So, how's your
situation going?

359
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,977
- Dolores?
- Yeah.

360
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,987
Got a call
from her lawyer.

361
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,821
She wants the car,
the house and $1,200 a month.

362
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,225
- That's bullshit!
- And she wants full custody of Bret.

363
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,230
That's why I told myself
I'll never get married.

364
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,232
It costs too much.

365
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,098
You know, I hear black women
don't do their men like that.

366
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,638
Who's planning on
marrying a black woman?

367
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,177
You know,
if we find that money...

368
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,770
there's no way
they can trace it.

369
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,213
- What are you saying?
- Those are all deposits.

370
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:42,686
Those companies are insured. That money
means nothing to them in the long run.

371
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,450
I wonder how much
it really is.

372
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,458
I heard it's more
than we make in a month.

373
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,591
One man's loss,
another man's gain?

374
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:54,359
Huh? You thinking
what I'm thinking?

375
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,492
Yeah?

376
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,001
Doughnuts?

377
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,571
Let's just get
something to eat.

378
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:07,143
Man, what you mean don't worry
about it? Get my stuff back.

379
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,146
<i>Should be out ofhere</i>
<i>in a couple ofhours.</i>

380
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,682
Cool, man. I'm gonna
get started on it right now.

381
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,809
Keep that on the down,
all right?

382
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,353
All right, cool, man. Cool.

383
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,256
Motherfuck...

384
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,174
Aim.

385
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,709
- What you want?
- Tibbs, man, sit your nosy ass down.

386
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,083
- Ain't nothing happening over here.
- Don't tell me to sit my ass down.

387
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,088
I've been living here
all my life.

388
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,090
I've been here
since before you was born.

389
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,092
Get your ass in the house.
Get away.

390
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,425
- I'll put a buckshot in your ass.
- What's up, dog?

391
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,022
What's going on?
So, what's the news?

392
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,033
Pull up a chair.

393
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,696
- Come on now. You got to tell me.
- Pull up a chair.

394
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:11,470
That's bangin' right there.
All right, I'm listening. What's up?

395
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,478
Well, I just got
my insurance check.

396
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,310
- That's what was in the envelope?
- I'm trying to do something tonight.

397
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,442
- How much you get?
- Don't worry about all that now.

398
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,817
- What, you get more than a "G"?
- Yep.

399
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,719
- More than two G's?
- Yep.

400
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,887
- More than three G's?
- Partner, don't worry about all that.

401
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,919
You're the one volunteering information.
What you trying to do tonight?

402
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,925
- Thinking about going to a strip club.
- All right.

403
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:40,438
- What's the move?
- My car's still got a dent in it...

404
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,303
- and I can't ride with no dented car.
- Dre, my truck's riding smooth.

405
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,402
That's what I'm saying.
I figure this: You drive, I'll pay.

406
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,243
- What time you trying to roll out?
- 'Bout 10:00?

407
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,613
All right. But you still trying
to go to the block party.

408
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,847
See, I don't know
about that, man.

409
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,617
If it's gonna be all kids,
I ain't trying to stay long, dude.

410
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,818
Meet me at my house
between 9:45, 10:00.

411
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,691
- All right?
- I'm good with that.

412
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,594
All right.

413
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,532
- You get that for me, man?
- Come on, Dre. I ain't your slave, man.

414
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:13,002
I ain't ask you all that.
You right by the door. Get the damn...

415
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,305
Get the damn door.

416
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,209
- Hey, Mom, what you doing here?
- Hey, baby.

417
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,213
- What's going on?
- All right.

418
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:27,308
Hey, Dre.
Is your mother home?

419
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,876
- I know you fantasize about me.
- Damn!

420
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,683
Oh, yes, ma'am.
She went to the mall. Yeah.

421
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,695
- The mall.
- Girl's always shopping. I'll go there.

422
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:42,494
- Somebody called from Kelvin's school
- What did they want?

423
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,762
They didn't say. They just said
they needed to talk to you ASAP.

424
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:47,361
So it's probably
'cause he messed up in school again.

425
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,704
Lord, I'm about to send
that boy to his father.

426
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,243
Hey, baby, look here.
Nice, isn't it? Huh?

427
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:58,479
Yeah, Ma. This is nice the first time
you showed me. I saw this already.

428
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,177
Oh, Lord, a two-week cruise
across the Mediterranean Sea.

429
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:07,554
Soon as I get some money, I'm gonna take
this trip. What was the number today?

430
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:11,153
- I don't know, Ma.
- If I hit that number, I'm gonna go...

431
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,161
with your mama.

432
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,563
My mama already got...
She already got her ticket.

433
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,831
Yeah, I know. She told me. That's all
right, 'cause I'm going on this trip.

434
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,463
Ma, look, if anybody deserves
to go on that trip, you do.

435
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,064
Thank you, baby.
Listen, darling.

436
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,111
Help your brother with his homework.
I got an appointment at the salon.

437
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:30,409
Come on now. The fool never gonna
pass the math class anyway.

438
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,416
- What's the point?
- Look here.

439
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,715
You know if he passes this test Friday,
he gonna graduate junior high.

440
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,756
- Now, don't you know that?
- He should've been studying instead...

441
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,882
of talking to them girls
on the phone all week.

442
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,893
Would you just watch
your brother?

443
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,953
Ma, he's old enough to watch himself.
Besides, I had plans to go out tonight.

444
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,898
Oh, really?
I thought you were broke...

445
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,868
when I asked you for $20.

446
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,531
What's up with that? Huh?

447
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,940
Can I talk to you outside
for just a second, please? One minute?

448
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,806
See you, Andre.

449
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,922
Yo, man, don't be
looking at my mom's ass.

450
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,289
- I ain't looking at her ass.
- I saw you looking.

451
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,590
- We're like family. You trippin'.
- If we like family...

452
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,130
don't be looking
at my mom's ass.

453
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,065
I wasn't looking
at her ass.

454
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,402
Ma, why you trying to embarrass me
in front of my friend?

455
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,408
I thought you said
you didn't have any money.

456
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,910
I don't have any money,
but Dre just came into some big cash.

457
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,776
- Oh, really?
- Like a couple of thousand dollars.

458
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,409
- Really?
- Why you looking at me like that?

459
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:43,420
- He wants to take me out to celebrate.
- What time y'all leaving?

460
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:46,480
- Around 10:00.
- Well, I'll be back way before you go.

461
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,721
I got to get my hair done. So you just
help your brother with his homework.

462
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,728
- I've been watching him all week.
- Here he is right now.

463
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,730
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, Ma.

464
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,330
I'll holler
at you later, man.

465
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,338
Bye, Ma.

466
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,466
Mom said you're gonna help me
with my math homework.

467
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,936
- Man, you get on my damn nerves.
- What?

468
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,986
Who need a cut?
I'll hook you up.

469
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,256
What's up, bro?
You need a cut?

470
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,889
- How about you, man?
- Nah. I'm waiting on somebody.

471
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,297
- Who you waitin' on?
- Anybody but your ass.

472
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:34,134
You better sit down,
you old NBA look-alike wanna-be.

473
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,639
Lucky I got a bunion.
What's up with you?

474
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,241
How about you, man?
I know you need a cut.

475
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,405
- Man, who did your shit?
- I did my shit, man.

476
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,314
Look at you. You got me saying it.
Man, look at my hair!

477
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:52,746
You want the do of the Millennium, you
better ask somebody. Look at that.

478
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:59,692
Huh? Yeah. You better ask.
Ah, ah, ah, ah. Huh?

479
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,934
Hey. What's
the latest, Twan?

480
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,342
- Girl, haven't you heard?
- About what?

481
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,437
About the armored
truck crash.

482
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:19,108
Somebody grabbed a couple
of bundles of money...

483
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,914
and when they found the suspect,
he didn't have a dime on him.

484
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,920
- When?
- Today.

485
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,922
And since the deposits
were just made...

486
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,924
they won't know
how much until Monday.

487
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,928
And the best part about it is,
that money is untraceable.

488
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,556
- Come on. Who told you that?
- It was on the news.

489
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,964
- Get out!
- And guess where it happened.

490
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,300
- Where?
- A couple of blocks from your house.

491
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:44,671
Well, I heard the guy stashed
the money in Andre Mitchell's backyard.

492
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,007
- Where you get that at?
- Boom.

493
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,013
You know Boom
don't know shit.

494
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,447
Don't be talking
about my Boom.

495
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,950
- Bitch, please.
- I got your bitch.

496
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,043
You may have my bitch,
but you ain't got Boom.

497
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,614
No, I got Boom, and he's at home looking
at my white chocolate ass every night.

498
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,585
- You know it's true, girl.
- You need to be trying to get an ass.

499
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,061
- I don't think so.
- Hey, excuse me.

500
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,098
Can we get on
with my hair, please?

501
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,862
I'm sorry, baby.
Everything as usual, right?

502
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,869
Yeah.

503
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,302
If I had that money,
I'd be on a cruise somewhere.

504
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,470
Get up out of here.

505
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,682
I don't have any money,
but Dre just came into some big cash.

506
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,117
- Oh, really?
- He got a couple of thousand dollars.

507
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:32,281
<i>Thousand dollars,</i>
<i>thousand dollars.</i>

508
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:32,490
- Are you sure?
- That's what his cousin said.

509
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,756
- Are you sure?
- That's what his cousin said.

510
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,626
But how you know his cousin
ain't lying though?

511
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,631
That's why the police
was over here.

512
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,595
Oh. You know what?

513
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,333
I think I'm gonna give my Dre baby
a call, see how he's doing.

514
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,309
You know how the police get.
Could you pass me the phone?

515
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,174
Go on, girl. You so...

516
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,183
- Give me the phone.
- I know you was looking.

517
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,185
I wasn't looking
at your old tired booty.

518
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,279
Call my baby Dre.

519
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:12,353
- Hello.
- Hey, Dre, baby. How you doing?

520
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,665
- Who this?
- Tasha.

521
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,759
- <i>Who?</i>
- It's me, Tasha.

522
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:21,999
I need you to come over
my house soon as possible.

523
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,509
<i>It's an emergency. I have</i>
<i>to talk to you, right now.</i>

524
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:30,013
- What emergency?
- Please, Dre. Baby, please.

525
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,078
- All right.
- Okay, I'll see you later.

526
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,086
All right, Tasha.

527
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,823
Here. Hang that up
for me, please.

528
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,830
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

529
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:50,891
Boom, you know what? You're gonna have
to leave 'cause I got some things to do.

530
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,962
- What you about to do?
- Handle my business.

531
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,304
- You know how I do it, girl.
- See, girl, you ain't even right.

532
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,243
You ain't even right.
But you better give me some though.

533
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,440
You know I'm gonna give you some.
You my girl. I always look out for you.

534
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,415
Okay, maybe not that time
I didn't have your back.

535
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,285
But I got you
this time, girl. Okay?

536
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,520
I'm gonna call you later.
Just go on. I'm gonna call you.

537
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,527
Yeah, whatever.
You stressin' me.

538
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,792
- But anyway, I'll holler at you later.
- All right then.

539
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,633
Hey, what's up, Dre?
What's going on, player?

540
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:31,232
- Where my money at, Cisco?
- That's why I came over... to pay you.

541
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:35,439
- What I owe you, about 5, $10?
- You owe me $20, man.

542
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,448
You lucky I didn't
charge you interest in two years.

543
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:42,384
My fault, man. Things be coming up.
You know how it is, man.

544
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,217
You a good brother, though.
Helping the needy out.

545
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,223
What's going on?
Whoo! Dang, man.

546
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,192
- What you looking for?
- You got a new love seat, a new couch.

547
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,388
That's old, dude.
That furniture's old. I been had that.

548
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,397
- That's old?
- Yes.

549
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,263
- The shirt is tight. What's that, large?
- Dude, dude, it's old too.

550
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,428
All this is old.
Everything in here is old.

551
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,667
Just like your outfit. The same thing.
Just as old as your stuff is.

552
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,005
Hey, man, since you always be
hooking me up and looking out for me...

553
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,307
it's my turn, you know,
to return the favor, baby.

554
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,542
- You know what I'm saying?
- Whatever.

555
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:15,814
- What the hell is that?
- This is a joint, baby.

556
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,015
- Ajoint?
- Yeah, straight from Jamaica.

557
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,059
- Go on and smell a little bit.
- How high are you trying to get?

558
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,617
This is the best shit
money can buy, dog.

559
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,255
- You don't want none of this? You sure?
- No, I'm cool. Yes, I'm cool.

560
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,265
I'm gonna break you off
a piece of the roach for later on.

561
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,063
- Dude, I'm cool. I'm cool.
- You don't want none?

562
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,070
- Thank you. Go, Cisco.
- You positive?

563
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:37,266
All right. Hey, you got
a lighter I could borrow, man?

564
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,275
Man, just go. Go.

565
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,743
I'm gonna smoke this by myself.
You missing out. All right, Dre.

566
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,008
Freak.

567
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,483
<i>It's PJ. Butter, giving you</i>
<i>the hottestjoints in your mouth.</i>

568
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,544
<i>Hey, the money</i>
<i>is still out there. Believe me.</i>

569
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,784
<i>Hey, stop blowing me up. I told you,</i>
<i>the money is still out there.</i>

570
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:57,021
<i>Look at you. It's like Easter in</i>
<i>the hood. You trying to find this cash.</i>

571
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,188
<i>Break me off if you get it,</i>
<i>all right? Holler.</i>

572
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,426
<i>69.9 KNUT,</i>
<i>the station in your mouth.</i>

573
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:13,205
Hey, Dre! Just the man
I've been looking for, brother.

574
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,243
Dre! My man!

575
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,148
- Just the man I've been looking for.
- What's up, Too Sweet?

576
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:23,517
I've been watching you
for a minute now.

577
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,522
And I know
you got a job...

578
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,082
but I think you're ready to make
some serious money, my brother.

579
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,028
- How, Too Sweet?
- I notice the way you handle people.

580
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,065
And that's a quality
everybody don't have.

581
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,159
It takes a special kind
of individual, brother.

582
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:42,366
- So I'm that individual?
- Yeah. You damn right.

583
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,931
Too Sweet knows quality
when he sees it.

584
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:48,001
- Look at me.
- What is that? Rat fur or something?

585
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,741
It's rat and possum, brother.
You don't find this everywhere.

586
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,079
- You would have found it on the freeway.
- Freeway, my ass.

587
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,551
Princess, come here, baby.
Come, come, come.

588
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,282
- Oh, shit.
- You like this?

589
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,154
Yeah. Turn
that ass around, baby.

590
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,658
Damn.

591
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,527
- Is that straight or what?
- That's nice.

592
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:11,557
Because if you don't like that,
I got all types, brother.

593
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,730
Light. Bright.
Damn near white.

594
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,569
Dark. Midnight. Fat.

595
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:22,045
Oh, my bad. You can't
call them "fat" no more.

596
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,047
It's bad
for their self-esteem.

597
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,551
Now you got to call them ho's
"pleasingly plump."

598
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,247
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

599
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:35,258
All right, all right.
You making me reach into my...

600
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,227
my secret stash.

601
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,764
I didn't wanna blow
your mind with this one...

602
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,289
but... Passion! Passion!

603
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,394
- Come on, girl.
- Oh, shit.

604
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,378
Yeah. My baby.

605
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,040
Motherfucker,
where's my shit?

606
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:01,448
Baby, don't trip.
I got your shit.

607
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,387
Passion, don't get out of pocket
in front of a potential investor.

608
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,514
Hey there, sugar.

609
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,125
You looking for some spice?

610
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:17,224
Come on, baby. You think
you can handle this?

611
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,792
I'm just saying...
I'm just...

612
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,137
Hey, don't let the size
fool you, honey.

613
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:28,702
'Cause you know what?
I'd pop your cork.

614
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,441
I would tear
that ass up.

615
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,451
I don't know.
I don't know.

616
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,318
He ain't
'bout it, 'bout it.

617
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,353
I'll talk to you a little later,
you hear, honey?

618
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,591
Sweet, you better have
my shit when I get back.

619
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:53,532
Like that, Sweet?
She punk you like that?

620
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,539
Yeah. Hey, I told you
I got all types, didn't I?

621
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,541
Yeah, you wasn't
lying, dog.

622
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,169
A lot of folks
would pay, my brother.

623
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:04,146
- Man, I'm not paying for her.
- I don't want you to pay for her.

624
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:08,845
I want you to work it. Make them ho's
make money for you, brother.

625
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,047
They don't wanna
work for me.

626
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,092
Princess, baby,
would you work for him?

627
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,356
- Wait now. Don't start nothin'.
- Hell, yeah.

628
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:26,802
I told you. I'm getting too old
for this young man's game.

629
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:31,831
I wanna pass my empire over
to someone who can make them dollars...

630
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,173
and you have what it takes.

631
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,244
- You think so?
- You wanna make $20,000 a week, brother?

632
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,377
Man, you ain't make
$20,000 a week.

633
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:45,411
I know, but if
we work together, we can make it.

634
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:51,718
- What the hell you need from me?
- A couple of dollars for more ho's.

635
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:55,425
- What does a couple of dollars mean?
- About $10,000.

636
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,525
Ten thousand...
Man, are you out your damn mind?

637
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,127
Too knows you just got
some money, brother.

638
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,139
Man, I ain't spending
no money on no ho's.

639
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,539
You can make mo' money
off of ho money.

640
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:08,100
Well, you need to spend yo' money
'cause I ain't got no money.

641
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,240
Oh, it's like that, huh?

642
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:16,912
- It's exactly like that.
- Baby, let's get the hell out of here.

643
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:21,390
- I thought this fool had potential.
- Take you and your rat coat...

644
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,087
- havin' ass up out of here.
- I've stole you money.

645
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:28,791
I bought you your first pair of shoes.
This is class, man. My jacket is class.

646
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:32,802
Fix your damn muffler.
Fix the muffler.

647
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:41,941
- Cracker?
- Nigger!

648
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,949
I just wanted to know
if you wanted a cracker.

649
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,352
I'm very
stressed out, Lewis.

650
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,355
I'm sorry.

651
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,716
No offense taken.

652
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,853
- Thanks.
- I like the crackers.

653
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,330
<i>Your boy, PJ. Butter.</i>

654
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,926
<i>Let me get on up out ofhere and go try</i>
<i>to find me some of this missing money.</i>

655
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:08,995
<i>But don't you go nowhere 'cause up next</i>
<i>we got my man for all you ladies.</i>

656
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,633
<i>He gonna make you wet. He gonna</i>
<i>make you take off your panties.</i>

657
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,075
<i>He gonna make you do things</i>
<i>you never thought you could do.</i>

658
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:18,172
<i>Tooth is up next on 69.9 KNUT,</i>
<i>the station in your mouth.</i>

659
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:18,665
Goddamn!
Damn, where the fuck am I?

660
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:28,177
Hey, bro! My main man!
What's happening?

661
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,518
I locked my keys in my car.
Come on. Let me show you.

662
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:44,132
I was thinking. I wondered
if you could, you know...

663
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:47,898
you know, you could...
You know what I'm talking about.

664
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,839
- I could get in there for you.
- Yes.

665
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:55,402
Hey, and there's
$5.00 in it for you.

666
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,145
Really, homie?
Let me get this right.

667
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:02,583
If I help you get those keys out,
I can have that $5.00 bill?

668
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,144
You sure can, homie.

669
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,089
Okay, homie.
Hold on one second, okay?

670
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,831
Goddamn motherfucker!

671
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,840
You broke my window!

672
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,502
Thanks, homie.

673
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:30,104
You broke my window!
This is a company car!

674
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,115
Goddamn! What am I
fucking doing here?

675
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,242
I could be in
fucking Beverly Hills!

676
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:39,653
This is Tooth coming to you live,
KNUT 68.9 on your FM dial...

677
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,213
<i>on your lunch hour.</i>

678
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,226
<i>Yes, indeed,</i>
<i>we got the hottest tracks.</i>

679
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:47,253
<i>Speaking ofhot, this morning</i>
<i>an armored truck turned over...</i>

680
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,595
<i>and a gang of money</i>
<i>is now missing.</i>

681
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,601
Come on in, Dre, baby.

682
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:58,335
- What's the emergency, Tasha?
- I just wanted to see you, that's all.

683
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,343
You saw me yesterday.

684
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:05,405
I know. But I was thinking.
We should spend more time together.

685
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:09,145
- Are you high?
- You know I stopped doing that.

686
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,380
Stop playing.

687
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:17,894
No, see, that's my mom's medication,
for her eyes and stuff. She's...

688
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,896
Damn near blind?

689
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:23,456
Dre, you are too silly.
Come on. I wanna show you something.

690
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:26,094
Sit down.
Sit right there.

691
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,400
Okay? Don't... Don't...

692
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,406
No time to be playing, Tasha.

693
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:40,772
I bought something,
and I need someone's opinion.

694
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:44,378
Why me? When you saw me yesterday,
you said you didn't wanna see me again.

695
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,355
I was just playing.

696
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,550
I guess you was playing
when you shot at me too.

697
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,652
Dre, you take stuff a little
too serious. Lighten up, baby.

698
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,959
Plus, they were just blanks.

699
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,465
Come on, Tasha.
What do you want?

700
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:00,060
It's from Victor's
Trashy Secrets.

701
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,432
What do you think?

702
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,773
- It's all right.
- All right?

703
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:11,178
I know I'm the bomb.

704
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:14,115
Ooh, yeah, baby.

705
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:17,381
What's my name? What's my name?
What's my name?

706
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,388
Yeah, you like that.

707
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,924
Yeah!
You like that.

708
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,222
Yeah, Dre.

709
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:27,229
I wanna do things to you
you never had done...

710
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,231
- to you before.
- Damn, Tasha.

711
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,426
Hell, yeah.

712
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,562
Hey, hey, hey!
Go get the condom, baby.

713
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,606
- Oh. That shit.
- Back it out.

714
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,905
- Okay. Stay right there, baby.
- Can't afford it. All right.

715
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:49,250
Damn.

716
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,356
Okay. Here you go.

717
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,298
But hold this for me.
I got to tee-tee. Be right back.

718
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,896
Yeah, you know I still
wear these big ones.

719
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,485
Excuse me. Sorry.

720
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:41,800
I'm ready, baby. Yeah.

721
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,863
But didn't you just go in the...

722
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:48,810
Damn.

723
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,282
Shit.

724
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,955
Ooh, yes, Dre!

725
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,462
Aw, hell, no.

726
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:17,268
God. That's it?

727
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,774
Huh?

728
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:23,210
Two minutes?

729
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,805
I got... I just got
a lot on my mind.

730
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:29,410
A lot on your mind?
You little...

731
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,420
I'm sorry, baby.

732
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:35,686
I know it's hard to perform
when you have so much on your mind.

733
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:39,923
Just tell me what's
on your mind, baby.

734
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,989
I'm getting like a weird vibe
from everybody.

735
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,499
Really?

736
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:48,670
Yeah.

737
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:53,506
You know, baby,
if you ever, ever need me...

738
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,205
all you have
to do is ask, okay?

739
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,214
I'm here for you, baby.

740
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,617
Same here, Tasha.

741
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,887
For real?

742
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,889
Yeah.

743
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:23,239
Tasha, what's wrong, baby?
It was that good?

744
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:29,274
I never had no one
who was down for a bitch.

745
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,707
You know
I'm down for a bitch.

746
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:38,482
I wanna get an abortion,
but I can't afford it.

747
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,926
How much is it, Tasha?

748
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:47,327
I promise, as soon as I get
the money, I'll pay you back, baby.

749
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,331
Tasha, you ain't
got no job.

750
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:53,267
But as soon as I get one,
you'll be the first person I pay.

751
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,931
Please.
I almost got enough.

752
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:57,940
How much
you need, Tasha?

753
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,274
- Two thousand dollars.
- Two thousand dollars? Damn!

754
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,838
- How many years you pregnant?
- I'm two months.

755
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,578
But it costs more the first time
you get pregnant, Dre.

756
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:12,588
You might have to wait till you about
nine months. I ain't got it like that.

757
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:18,484
- It's like that?
- Tasha, I just ain't got it right now.

758
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,496
I heard
you got some money.

759
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:25,867
Is this what this shit is about?
Is this what...

760
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:28,234
I got plans for
that money already.

761
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,743
Whatever.

762
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,140
Dre, you know what?

763
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:42,276
You ain't shit!
I wasn't pregnant anyway.

764
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,718
I just wanted to see what your
little stupid ass was gonna say.

765
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,722
- You little stupid-ass motherfucker.
- Whatever.

766
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,883
- I wasn't little a few minutes ago.
- Get your tired ass out my bed.

767
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:51,689
I don't wanna see
your stupid ass again. Get out!

768
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,696
I'm gone.

769
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,096
Okay. Dre, baby.
Come on.

770
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:59,829
- You just gonna do me like that?
- Move out the way, please.

771
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,565
I don't hit no girl.

772
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,369
Oh, you gonna stay there?

773
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,240
Get your crazy ass
out of here.

774
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,803
Oh, I got something
for your ass.

775
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,815
It's on now.

776
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:29,155
Give me this. Hold on.
Did you just dick-slap me?

777
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:33,168
You simple ass... I had just enough
of your shit. You got a problem.

778
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,704
Don't ever raise your dick
at me again. You understand me?

779
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:37,933
Simple ass.

780
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:42,536
Simple. You know what? Open this damn
door. That damn shit should be black.

781
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,622
- Listen. This is me. This is me.
- <i>Me?</i>

782
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:59,685
- <i>Me who?</i>
- Stay out of everybody's business.

783
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:01,697
- Just mind your own.
- <i>Oh, it's like that?</i>

784
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:06,134
That's... Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on. Yello.

785
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:10,037
Dre ain't trying to come off of no
money, but I got something for his ass.

786
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,041
Hold on for one second.
Hold on.

787
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,601
Listen. I gots to go. But first
of all, mind your own business.

788
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,943
Secondly,
I'll call you back. Bye.

789
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,949
Hello. Okay,
girl, what's up?

790
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,451
- Oh, you gonna hear about it, girl.
- <i>What's the matter?</i>

791
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,455
- Oh, it's on. I'm gonna call you later.
- <i>You need to tell me what's up</i>...

792
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,590
Ooh, it's gonna be on.

793
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:34,391
It's gonna be on like
hot butter popcorn up in here soon.

794
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,489
Hold up!

795
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,024
Keep knocking.

796
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,367
I said hold up!

797
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,432
Hold...

798
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:20,533
Who the hell's
knocking like that?

799
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,204
Man, who the hell
is doing this?

800
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,214
Oh, shit. Damn.

801
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,386
They probably in there hiding.
Knock harder!

802
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:41,125
It's like that? Y'all wanna play like
that? It's about to be really on now.

803
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,492
Whoa. Damn.

804
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,137
Ooh, Jehovah!

805
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:55,337
- Come on, ladies. We got to go.
- That brother's been blessed.

806
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:57,607
- Wait a minute.
- What's the address in here?

807
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,309
Y'all ain't got to go.
Come on in.

808
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,977
My house is available
for everybody.

809
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:06,682
I bet you won't
come back again.

810
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:40,214
Get in... Get inside,
you big perv.

811
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,418
Don't do me
like that, man. Come on, man.

812
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,462
Whatever, whatever.
Hey, fellas.

813
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,966
- New meat.
- Don't... Man...

814
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:51,967
And he's got little beef.

815
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:57,334
Mm-hmm. You better
watch your shoes, fool.

816
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,177
I'm crazy.

817
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,171
You ain't crazy.
You wanna see crazy?

818
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,765
- You wanna see crazy?
- Step off!

819
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:12,105
- All right.
- Quiet down in there!

820
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,620
You touched Ivory. Hello.

821
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,383
- Hello. Can you hear me?
- Shit.

822
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:26,395
Getting hungry.

823
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:29,864
You ever had
your salad tossed?

824
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,800
Yeah. I can go
for one of them right now.

825
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:37,363
- Stop it.
- You like it plain or with something?

826
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:42,209
I need something on it.
It don't taste right when it's plain.

827
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,339
- A little added flavor.
- I know what you mean. I like honey.

828
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:49,447
Oh, you like that Chinese style.
A little sweet and sour?

829
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,079
Strictly vinaigrette.
Italian.

830
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:55,124
When was the last time
you had your salad tossed?

831
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:59,854
- Last night.
- Who did it for you?

832
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,393
- Tossed my salad?
- Yeah.

833
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,968
- I did.
- You did?

834
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,405
Oh, you limber like that.

835
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:16,345
Yeah, I know how I like it.
I know how to mix it all up.

836
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:19,712
Get all into it.
Just get into it. Just get into it.

837
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,717
Who did it for you last?

838
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:27,516
My mom.
She likes doing it too.

839
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:31,287
Your mom? Man, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

840
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,295
What the hell's
wrong with you?

841
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:37,697
- I don't let her cut my meat.
- Man, you are fucking sick!

842
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,567
He's fucking sick, man!
He's fucking sick! He's fucking sick!

843
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:44,937
- It's a salad. It's healthy for you.
- That shit ain't healthy.

844
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,532
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

845
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:53,604
I wanna tell y'all
brothers something. I love you, man.

846
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,150
Y'all my dogs.

847
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:59,154
- I don't know what I'd do without y'all.
- Coons.

848
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,925
Are you ready
to speak jigaboo?

849
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,330
Absolutely.

850
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:17,238
I love you, man.

851
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,969
Man, go on with that bullshit.
What the hell is you doing?

852
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,978
- Pouring some for the homies not here.
- Man, we here.

853
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,916
- Look at this. Five-0 coming over here.
- What?

854
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,919
Hi there, fellas.

855
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,614
What's up?

856
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:35,624
I wonder if you've heard anything about
the armored truck crash this morning.

857
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:38,286
- Nah, dog.
- What you mean, "Nah"?

858
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:41,626
This y'all's hood. Y'all should
know what's going on around here.

859
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,829
Well, we don't recall...

860
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,665
hearing of any incident
of that nature...

861
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,705
occurring in this vicinity.

862
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:51,707
That's kind
of strange, isn't it?

863
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,970
If someone made off with $100,000,
someone would've heard something.

864
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,977
There's a big reward in it.

865
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:59,139
Reward? Like the reward gonna
be more than the money.

866
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,308
How about five years in prison?
How's that sound to you?

867
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:03,818
Ooh, that sounds cool.
This the hood, man.

868
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,014
The best thing that can happen
to you is to get locked up.

869
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,786
- That's for sure for sure.
- I'll run you in for public drinking.

870
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:13,124
Drinking? Since when
is it against the law...

871
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,130
to drink juice
in public?

872
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:18,565
- Have some?
- That's real funny.

873
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:21,627
We will be
patrolling the area.

874
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,638
Don't fuck up!

875
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,640
Don't be caught in anything stupid
you might regret it.

876
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,768
Like helping y'all
non-dressing asses.

877
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:31,643
- That's why I can't stand niggers.
- Me neither.

878
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:34,046
- What?
- Tango and Ash.

879
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,347
<i>This is Tooth coming</i>
<i>to you live, KNUT.</i>

880
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:40,446
<i>Speaking ofhot, you know this morning</i>
<i>an armored truck turned over...</i>

881
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,457
<i>and a gang of money</i>
<i>is now missing.</i>

882
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:45,460
<i>The suspects have been apprehended,</i>
<i>but the money's still at large.</i>

883
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,597
<i>If you got a little time on your lunch</i>
<i>break, go and check out your backyard</i>...

884
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,121
<i>If you got a little time on your lunch</i>
<i>break, go and check out your backyard</i>...

885
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,566
- What's wrong with homeboy?
- I wouldn't even mess with him.

886
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,229
Sometimes he forget
he even in a wheelchair.

887
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,432
- Oh, it's like that?
- Yeah.

888
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:05,110
- What the hell you in here for?
- Jaywalking, fool.

889
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,050
Probably rolled up
on some fools.

890
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:11,586
Supposed I rolled over there
and whupped your bright ass?

891
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:17,788
- Eastside!
- Westside!

892
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:24,023
2:00. 4:00. 6:00.
8:00. 10:00. 6:00. 12:00.

893
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,160
2:00. 4:00. 3:00.

894
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:30,798
One. Five.
6:00. 4:00. Twelve.

895
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,546
Diggs, can I talk
to you for a second?

896
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,677
But you ain't got my money, man.
What you messin' with me for?

897
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:44,811
Huh? You need to be out
robbing a liquor store or something.

898
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,722
You got 5 hours
and 14 minutes.

899
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,088
That's what I wanna
talk to you about, the money.

900
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,087
This better not be
no bullshit, man.

901
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,290
This ain't no bullshit.
This shit is real, man.

902
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,630
I got a partner who helped me get
the money, but he ain't home right now.

903
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:02,228
- We're hooking up at the block party.
- Who's your partner?

904
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,239
I ain't trying to get him
all caught up in this shit, all right?

905
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:08,175
By the looks of this shit, he's already
in it. You better not be playing me.

906
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,508
If you don't believe me, you're
welcome to come to the block party.

907
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,775
- I think I got another invitation.
- I can come to the party?

908
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:15,317
Oh, that's so nice.
Don't tell me where I can come.

909
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,377
I know I can come to the party.
Where's the party?

910
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:21,218
You got until midnight.
If I don't see some cash by midnight...

911
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,919
that's your ass,
and you too, stupid.

912
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:26,154
- All right then. We out then.
- What are you waiting on?

913
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,289
- Get the fuck out of my face.
- Man, he gonna kill us.

914
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:32,027
I don't wanna die.
Why didn't you tell him the truth?

915
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:35,002
If I told him the truth, he'd try to
get it, and I still would've owed him.

916
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,005
This way we got
a chance to get it.

917
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,007
Andre Mitchell.

918
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,542
What?

919
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:43,579
Get your little sorry ass up.
Come on. Let's go.

920
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:48,250
- Hurry up!
- Hey, man! Don't be tacky.

921
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,980
- Leave that boy alone. Come on.
- He's after me.

922
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,988
- Whatever.
- I told you she be lyin'.

923
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:55,786
Now, look. She dropped
all the charges, okay?

924
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:57,792
Got me in here with all
these fuckin' freaks, man!

925
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,794
Don't worry about it.
Hey, listen to me.

926
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:02,695
First, you might need to go down to
the clinic and get yourself checked out.

927
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,598
- For real?
- Anybody in contact with that woman...

928
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:07,932
- is subject to have an STD.
- Oh, shit.

929
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:10,097
Goddamn!

930
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:11,663
Did you have fun?

931
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,808
What?

932
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:25,911
Hey, don't let the gray hairs
fool you, man.

933
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:31,257
Don't trip.
I'm just hangin' out.

934
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:33,761
Came to see
who got some shit.

935
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,264
Oh, hell, no!

936
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,932
- I got a little cough.
- Cough.

937
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:45,507
Pulled my back.
You know.

938
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:49,238
Workin' out.
Your ass don't ever work out.

939
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:56,642
What do you have? And don't give me
that cold bullshit either.

940
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,449
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

941
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:03,583
Is the problem below your waist
and above your knee?

942
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,787
Yeah.

943
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:09,798
Have you had sex with
a skanky little ho lately?

944
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,800
- Excuse me?
- A ho.

945
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:14,962
A hootchie. A freak.
A crackhead.

946
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:18,030
- I mean kinda.
- What do you mean, "kinda"?

947
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:20,041
I mean, you know,
she don't smoke crack.

948
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,600
Well, then she's a ho.
She's a freak!

949
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,045
She's a hootchie!
Now just sign here!

950
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:26,706
Damn, lady, you need
to chill, miss, okay?

951
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:30,344
Yeah, chill. Where'd chillin' get you?
Sign that thing.

952
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,684
Lady, come on.
People listenin'.

953
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:35,315
Listening.
Sign it!

954
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,621
- You got a problem. You know that?
- Yeah, you got a problem.

955
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,663
You nasty little thing.
You infected little freak of nature!

956
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:44,222
You little nasty thing, you!
You're just nasty!

957
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,291
Comin' up here
and messing everything up.

958
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:50,135
- So what you got?
- I don't know.

959
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,935
Look, brother.
I don't want no trouble.

960
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:54,340
You keep it real with me,
I keep it real with you.

961
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,243
- Like I'm sayin', I don't really know.
- Clinic.

962
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:59,508
- What's your symptoms?
- What's wrong? What do you need?

963
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:02,142
- Symptoms?
- You itchin', scratchin', burnin'?

964
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:06,245
Oh, no, man. I'm all right.
I ain't got none of that kind of stuff.

965
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:08,290
Hurts like a mutha
when I pee.

966
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,287
Sorry to hear that, man.

967
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:16,089
No, don't be sorry for me.
See, I got discharge.

968
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:20,934
What the hell
you talkin' about?

969
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:25,706
See, the doctors,
they can see what I got.

970
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:28,676
But you... gotta get
the old Q-Tip.

971
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:31,946
Oh, you don't know
about the Q-Tip?

972
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:33,948
I don't know
about the Q-Tip.

973
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,951
Oh, see, that's when they get
a stick about this long...

974
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,953
and the head be
about this wide, man.

975
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:42,218
Then they grab your dick, man,
and they dig and dig!

976
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:43,986
- And they dig!
- Get back!

977
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:50,026
Back it up, dog. Don't crack the jaw
like that again. Don't do that.

978
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,430
Scared me.

979
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,427
- You got a problem.
- No, brother. I ain't got no problem.

980
01:02:55,505 --> 01:03:00,135
See, I got symptoms.
You? You got the problem.

981
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:02,200
No, you got the problem
with that outfit.

982
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,237
- Hey, don't worry about where I shop.
- I got the burning!

983
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:09,341
I got the burning.
I got to see the doctor right now.

984
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,545
- I've got the burning.
- Just sign in.

985
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,256
Not with that hand!

986
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,691
Sorry.
I have the burning.

987
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:21,927
I've got the burning.

988
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,057
Just go sit down!

989
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:27,330
No, I can't sit with the people.
I got the burning.

990
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:30,895
Well, they've all got
the burning too. Go on!

991
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:35,103
No. That's how I got it.
I gotta see the doctor.

992
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,408
- What are you doing here?
- Who, me?

993
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,506
I'm waitin' on him.

994
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:45,180
- Calm down, young man.
- But, Doc...

995
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,313
- You've got the burning.
- I've got the burning.

996
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,324
Drop your drawers.

997
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:51,360
We'll give you
a little shot.

998
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:54,555
It'll be just fine.
Just fine.

999
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,394
I do a lot of these things,
and all of you guys are the same.

1000
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:00,435
You wanna dance,
but you don't wanna pay the band.

1001
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,597
- You've got the burning!
- I've got the burning!

1002
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:11,237
- Andre Mitchell?
- Mm-hmm. Right there.

1003
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:14,044
- Doctor's ready to see you.
- I ain't next.

1004
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:17,210
- They was here before me.
- No, you're next. He's waiting.

1005
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,813
Y'all know damn well
y'all was here before me.

1006
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,223
And, Boom, you know damn well
you should be the first one.

1007
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,557
They was there before me.
All of them was there before me.

1008
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:28,563
Hey, what's up, Doc?

1009
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,565
I'll be with you
in a second.

1010
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,828
I always wanted to say,
"What's up, Doc?"

1011
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:35,427
Very clever.
Why don't you hop up on the table.

1012
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:43,236
There.
Now how can I help you?

1013
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,746
I think I have an STD.

1014
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,747
What are your symptoms?

1015
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,154
I don't have any symptoms.

1016
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,958
Well, then what makes
you think you have STD?

1017
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:02,521
'Cause I was with a girl
who had an STD.

1018
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:04,828
And what did she have?

1019
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,831
I don't know.
They just said she had an STD.

1020
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,831
Who are they?

1021
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,843
Look. It's
a long story, Doc.

1022
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:18,347
They just said it's best
if I get tested for everything.

1023
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:22,447
All right.
Drop your drawers.

1024
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:25,885
We'll take a little swab.
We'll send it in to the lab.

1025
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:28,423
That way we'll know for sure
in just a couple of days.

1026
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:31,460
You know what I say,
"Better safe than sorry."

1027
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,566
- See ya later.
- Gotta go.

1028
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:40,568
- Gotta go.
- Mm-mmm!

1029
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:45,106
Good lookin' out, dog.

1030
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:47,870
- You comin' to the block party, man?
- I might.

1031
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:02,316
- Hello.
- You hear what's up with Tasha?

1032
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:04,689
- No. What happened?
- <i>Man, she got an STD.</i>

1033
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,160
And anybody that ever messed with her
is supposed to go down...

1034
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:09,288
and report to the clinic
on 103rd.

1035
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:12,198
<i>Yeah, I just came from there, man.</i>
<i>They tried to get me, but I'm cool.</i>

1036
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:15,898
Hold on, man.

1037
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,973
He honkin' like he crazy.
I'm gonna holler at you later, Kent.

1038
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,540
- All right, dog?
- All right.

1039
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:33,344
Man, what are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

1040
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:36,152
I'm lookin' for a loaf of bread.
I'm hungry.

1041
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:40,286
A loaf of bread? Yo, are you
purposely trying to irritate me?

1042
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:42,729
Go sit down somewhere.

1043
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,096
- Go sit down!
- Kiss my ass!

1044
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:55,974
- What's up, Dad?
- Hey, boy.

1045
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:58,570
- Where's your mom?
- She went shoppin'.

1046
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,581
She'll be gone for
a couple hours, though.

1047
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:03,174
That woman
always could shop.

1048
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:12,823
Say, fool, cut that noise down.
Asshole!

1049
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:17,989
- How you been doing, son?
- I'm cool as a fan.

1050
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:21,230
- How's your car?
- Still got a dent in it.

1051
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:24,534
Can't even open the trunk up.
You know.

1052
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:26,541
When you gonna
fix that thing?

1053
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:28,804
Oh, you know what?
I got an insurance check today.

1054
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:32,939
You know, you can't date
no girl without no car.

1055
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,643
You could if you stopped
dating them hootchies.

1056
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,652
Come on, Dad.
I don't date no hootchies.

1057
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,915
All girls are hootchies.

1058
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,923
Oh, so what you saying,
Mom's a hootchie?

1059
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:45,085
Oh, no.
Now your mom's a rarity.

1060
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:47,095
She's got class.

1061
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:51,099
Kind of crazy, but classy.

1062
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,034
The rest of'em
are all freaks.

1063
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,196
But don't men
make women freaks?

1064
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:59,264
Now you're starting to sound
like your mother.

1065
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:02,674
That's why we not together
till this day.

1066
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:06,010
I thought it was 'cause you got
that little gambling problem.

1067
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:09,643
Yeah, and I got a horse
comin' in any day now.

1068
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,252
Dad, that's your problem.

1069
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:16,849
- You gotta curb your gambling problem.
- I ain't got no problem.

1070
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:21,124
That's your first problem is denying
that you have a problem, Dad.

1071
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,688
Sound like
you've got some sense.

1072
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,496
Must have taken that
from your mother.

1073
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,867
I'm movin' out
next month, Dad...

1074
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,872
and she's gonna
be here by herself.

1075
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:34,506
I think she misses you too.

1076
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:37,307
- Hi, Mr. Mitchell.
- Hey, Boom.

1077
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:39,939
Got any pussy yet?

1078
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,540
Oh, no, but I'm gonna keep tryin',
though. I'll let you know.

1079
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,416
All right. You let me know
when you get some.

1080
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:47,581
Yes, sir, for sure.
I sure will.

1081
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,060
Dre, I need
to talk to you.

1082
01:08:55,331 --> 01:09:00,064
- No. What you want, Boom?
- Not in front of your daddy.

1083
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,604
What are you two up to?

1084
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:04,832
Oh, it ain't like that.
You better go on with that bullshit.

1085
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:08,172
No, for real.
It's important.

1086
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,673
That's what you get for opening up
other people's mail.

1087
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,919
That's what you get,
fat bastard.

1088
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:24,051
Well, I got things to do.

1089
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:27,391
- You'll let your mother know I came by.
- Yes, sir.

1090
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:30,762
Y'all take it easy.

1091
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,131
It ain't like that, Dad, for real.
It ain't even like that.

1092
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:35,796
- Bye, Mr. Mitchell.
- Bye, Boom.

1093
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,533
- You let me know now, hear?
- Yes, sir.

1094
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:40,268
What is it, Boom?

1095
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,505
- Dre, are we friends?
- I don't know now.

1096
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:48,880
What you just did around my father.
Don't ever do that, man.

1097
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:53,821
Tasha's tryin' to set you up
'cause she heard you got some money.

1098
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:56,619
- She already tried. It didn't work.
- Good.

1099
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,160
- Also, thank you, Dre.
- For what?

1100
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:02,629
You the only one around here who
don't say bad, mean things about me.

1101
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:06,395
- I mean, you all right, Boom.
- You the only one who understands me.

1102
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:11,167
It's like you've been in positions
I've been in before, you know?

1103
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,299
I know a couple of positions
I ain't never gonna go to.

1104
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:17,311
- Stop. You so crazy.
- Boom.

1105
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:20,644
But thank you though.

1106
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:23,241
- All right, Boom.
- Bye, Dre.

1107
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:33,060
- Hey, Boom.
- Huh?

1108
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:38,158
Why don't you come by
my house tomorrow at 3:00.

1109
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,429
I got something for you.

1110
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,834
At 3:00, Boom. At 3:00.

1111
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,964
- Okay.
- All right. All right, Boom.

1112
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,441
- Boom, I'm cool with that.
- Thanks, Dre.

1113
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:51,377
Go ahead. No.
Go, Boom.

1114
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:53,938
- Bye, Boom.
- See you.

1115
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:18,673
Hey, Mrs. Anderson.
How you doin'?

1116
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:21,505
My mom's not here right now.
She went to the mall.

1117
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:26,674
I know. I made you
some brownies. Homemade.

1118
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,210
That's nice, Mrs. Anderson.

1119
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,585
Well, aren't you gonna
let me come in?

1120
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:36,557
Oh, yeah, of course.

1121
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,874
Mmm. I thought you might like
to try my brownies.

1122
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:56,274
Ooh, I would love
to taste your brownies.

1123
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:59,007
- Would you really?
- Hell, yeah!

1124
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:03,848
Ever since my husband and I divorced,
I can't get anybody to try my brownies.

1125
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:06,444
Should've asked me.

1126
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:09,582
You are so sweet.

1127
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:13,424
Not having a man around,
you know, it's really hard.

1128
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:16,487
- What about Kent?
- Kent. Oh, well...

1129
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:20,262
he's a good son, but I need
somebody there emotionally...

1130
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,270
and financially.

1131
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,466
- I know that's right.
- You know, Dre...

1132
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:30,240
I have seen you grow up from
a little boy to a big old, strong man.

1133
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:35,283
I bet you got a lot of young girls
chasing after you, don't you?

1134
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,410
Well, you know, I gets mine,
Mrs. Anderson.

1135
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:41,217
Oh, no, it's Brenda.

1136
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,224
We're both adults,
aren't we?

1137
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,226
Yeah.

1138
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:48,559
I wanna show you something.

1139
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,757
- Really?
- Really.

1140
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,767
Let's go up to your room.

1141
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:55,929
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

1142
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:58,837
If I'm dreamin',
I'm gonna be mad as hell.

1143
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:01,569
Mmm. Lay down.

1144
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:06,612
Wow! Mrs...

1145
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:14,182
- Dre.
- Oh, shit!

1146
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:17,282
I know you're not about
to bone my moms.

1147
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:19,657
We're supposed to be
like family!

1148
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,856
- I love you.
- Boom?

1149
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:25,866
- Boy, I taught you better than that.
- Mom!

1150
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:29,165
That's right. You call me Mommy,
and I'm gonna call you Poppy.

1151
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,866
I can't, Mrs. Anderson.
I can't.

1152
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,067
What's the matter, honey,
have you got a little problem?

1153
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,804
Oh, no, ain't no problem
down there.

1154
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,743
- Hmm?
- Uh-uh.

1155
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:40,509
I mean, what,
you don't find me attractive?

1156
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,209
You fine as hell!

1157
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:45,851
Dre, I'm sorry.

1158
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:48,481
I'm sorry I came on to you.
It's just that...

1159
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:51,458
I've been going through a lot
ever since I found out that...

1160
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:55,353
Well, what's wrong?

1161
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:58,264
The doctor said I've gotta
have a kidney operation...

1162
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,358
or I'm not gonna live
another six months.

1163
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,597
- Kent ain't never tell me that.
- That's because he doesn't know.

1164
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:05,663
And I don't wanna worry him,
because I can't afford the operation.

1165
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:08,369
- How much is it?
- About $4,000.

1166
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,743
- Damn, don't you got some insurance?
- That is with insurance.

1167
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:15,545
I don't know who to turn to.
If I knew somebody I could get a loan.

1168
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,847
- What about a bank?
- The banks?

1169
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,081
They won't help me.

1170
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:22,453
I'm a little embarrassed
to say this, Dre...

1171
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,924
but, well, Kent told me
that you came into some money recently.

1172
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:28,121
It would just be a loan.
Just a loan.

1173
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:31,291
- How much you need, Mrs. Anderson?
- Oh, just $4,000.

1174
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:34,699
It would just be
a loan, honey. Hmm?

1175
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:39,598
- Hmm? Please, please.
- Okay.

1176
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:43,076
Oh! Oh, you are such
a sweet boy!

1177
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,170
I'm sorry I came on
to you like that.

1178
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:47,841
And remember,
I only have six weeks.

1179
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:50,407
Oh, I thought
you said six months.

1180
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:54,620
It was, when he told me that
41/2 months ago.

1181
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,386
Thank you. Thank you.

1182
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:59,859
Thank you so much.
Don't forget.

1183
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:02,396
- All right.
- Thank you.

1184
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:08,268
Oh, man!

1185
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:13,701
This has been
the craziest day of my life.

1186
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:15,709
I could make a movie
about this day.

1187
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:20,379
I don't wanna go outside again.
I don't know what's next.

1188
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:36,126
Dre, wake up!

1189
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,861
- Dre, do you know what time it is?
- Oh, shit!

1190
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:41,732
Are you hungry?
Do you want some supper?

1191
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:44,431
No, ma'am.
I'm going to the block party...

1192
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,440
and then I'm going
to the club afterwards.

1193
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:48,499
Oh, okay.

1194
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:09,960
This is what I'm saying.
I got my hat on. And it's like, whoo!

1195
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,807
You sure you don't want
nothing to eat?

1196
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:22,070
No, ma'am. I won't be out
too late, though.

1197
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:25,602
- All right. You be careful out there.
- Yes, ma'am.

1198
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:41,295
Hey, Pops.
Ooh, you is clean!

1199
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,456
Is your mother home?

1200
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:49,562
Yeah. Hey, Ma.
Mom, somebody's here to see you. Ma!

1201
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:53,005
Who is it, Dre?
George.

1202
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,669
Carol, I thought
you might like these.

1203
01:16:57,746 --> 01:17:01,409
- They're beautiful.
- Not as beautiful as you.

1204
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:04,975
Ooh, now that was smooth, Pops.
I like that.

1205
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,521
That is real, son.

1206
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:12,424
See, Ma. Now you have someone
to eat dinner with.

1207
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:15,463
Would you like to come in?

1208
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:17,293
I'd love to.

1209
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:39,721
I see ya, beige boy.

1210
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:44,657
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Tooth on KNUT, 68.9.

1211
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:47,490
I am so tired right now,
I'm drooling on myself.

1212
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:51,589
I have been here since 9:00 in the
morning getting prepared for this day.

1213
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,192
I can't find anybody to replace me.
I'm playing songs.

1214
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:57,261
People been calling me
about this money.

1215
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,705
It's about time for me
to sign up outta here.

1216
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:02,335
What I'm gonna do right now is go
to this block party I heard about.

1217
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,811
It's supposed to be off the hook.
Look, if you find the money...

1218
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,280
<i>come down to the block party,</i>
<i>spend the money well.</i>

1219
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,909
All I'm sayin', the party
better be off the hook.

1220
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:13,318
Look, if it's wack, we just hop
in the truck and go to the strip club.

1221
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:15,822
All I'm saying is the party
better be off the hook.

1222
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:30,265
You better be right.
I'm serious.

1223
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:33,239
- I was telling you about this house.
- Diggs is on my ass, man.

1224
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,674
- Hi. May I help you?
- Hi. Is Dre home?

1225
01:18:40,749 --> 01:18:43,047
Oh, no, baby,
you just missed him.

1226
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:45,678
I believe he went
to a block party.

1227
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:47,688
Oh, that's right. Okay.
Well, thanks a lot.

1228
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:50,281
All right.
Who shall I say came by?

1229
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:54,856
- Tell him that Diggs came by.
- Diggs.

1230
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,830
Okay.

1231
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,612
- I heard Boom gonna be there too.
- What?

1232
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:15,616
Well, you know it's gonna be
off the hook if that fool is there.

1233
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,504
Man, I don't want
the burnt one.

1234
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:39,506
You don't want the burnt one?
I'll give you any one you want.

1235
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:41,508
- Take off that sweater. How about that?
- Whatever.

1236
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,185
What's crackin' over here?

1237
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:53,881
Hey there, dog.
Oh, man.

1238
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:59,885
- Oh, what's up, dog? All right,
- What's up, dog?

1239
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,986
You know what?
Kelvin ran out the house...

1240
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:05,692
- when I was on the phone with you.
- Your brother gonna be there?

1241
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,745
Ooh, I am just
hot and sweat...

1242
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,680
Oh, no. See, I don't like to come
to no parties stinkin' like this.

1243
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,842
I gots to go home
and change my clothes.

1244
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:31,386
What's up, man?

1245
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:34,223
- I want a half a bird, man.
- A half a bird, dog.

1246
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:36,287
You got to talk to my cousin.
He'll be out in a week.

1247
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:46,707
There's about three future baby mamas
up in here tonight, boy.

1248
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,709
If you had some rhythm,
maybe you'd be gettin' some.

1249
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:50,836
That's messed up, man.
You know I got a clubfoot.

1250
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:55,448
- Man, she is fine over there.
- Yo, man, you seen Dre?

1251
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,179
I haven't seen Dre all night, man.
Hey, man, whatcha gonna do...

1252
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:00,221
when Diggs finds out you ain't
got that money you owe him?

1253
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:02,916
Oh, what you mean what I'm gonna do?
You mean, what are we gonna do?

1254
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:06,085
- What you mean "we"?
- We in this together, or did you forget?

1255
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:10,427
No, that was your $20,000
you found and put in Dre's backyard.

1256
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,830
- I had nothing to do with that.
- But if I had the money now in my hand...

1257
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:15,495
- who's money would it be?
- We're cousins. We'd split it.

1258
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,504
Exactly. Shut up, man.
Look for Dre.

1259
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:20,405
What's up? What's up, guys?
You got my money?

1260
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,240
Big Dre, what's up, man?

1261
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:26,712
Oh, what, we can't stand
here neither, man?

1262
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:29,443
I don't care if y'all stand here, as
long as you're not in front of my house.

1263
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:31,815
Oh, and speaking of in front
of my house, have y'all noticed...

1264
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:35,186
there's been some cops
in front of my house all day today?

1265
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:37,851
Probably lookin' for that crazy fool
Tome. Heard he stashed some money.

1266
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:42,192
- Whoa, what money? I didn't hear.
- You didn't hear?

1267
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:45,825
Tome robbed an armored truck today
after it crashed earlier.

1268
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,835
They say he stashed
the money somewhere.

1269
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:51,896
Yeah, they said he put it in somebody's
trash can. Can't find it though.

1270
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:54,737
But the cops have been chasing
that fool all day around here, man.

1271
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:59,303
Yeah, whatever. On the real, Diggs say
he's looking for whoever got his money.

1272
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:02,111
Man, y'all know Tome didn't
stash that damn money.

1273
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:05,482
He too cheap to let some money
out of his sight for a second.

1274
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:09,114
Somebody got that $20,000
somewhere.

1275
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:11,351
I heard
you got some money.

1276
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:14,020
Too know you just got
some money, brother.

1277
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:17,462
Kent told me you came into some money
recently. It would just be a loan.

1278
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:20,990
Cisco is your man, all right?
'Cause I got your back, man.

1279
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:24,470
Other than the fact that I ain't got
the money, and the plane ticket's $600.

1280
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:27,133
- What the hell you doing back here?
- Nothin'!

1281
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,073
Get your ass
up out my backyard!

1282
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:31,942
Find the money, man.

1283
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:33,503
You said Boom has
something to do with it.

1284
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:36,812
There goes Dre right there.
Dre, come here!

1285
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:39,080
- My backyard!
- Backyard?

1286
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:57,934
What the hell? Oh!

1287
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:32,967
Killin' me!

1288
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:45,949
- Whoa!
- Give me my motherfuckin' money!

1289
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:49,787
- I don't know where your money at, man.
- You know where the money is.

1290
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,951
Would I be back here
if I knew where the money was?

1291
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:54,154
- Don't play stupid!
- I'll beat your ass.

1292
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:56,925
- ** Dre gots the money ****
- Cut it, Boom.

1293
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:00,661
You got the money?
It was in your backyard all the time?

1294
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:03,329
Give the drag queen my money.
Have her bring it over here right now.

1295
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:05,339
I ain't got time to play
with you motherfuckers.

1296
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:09,309
Do you hear me, huh?
Give me my money, man! Shit!

1297
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:15,349
- Drop the gun, asshole. Drop the gun.
- What's up with you, man?

1298
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:19,319
You stupid fucks. We knew you'd
lead us right to the money.

1299
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:22,413
Give it up, jiggas.
Jiggas, give it up.

1300
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:25,084
Give up the money. Give up the money
so we can get out of here...

1301
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,890
- and get on vacation.
- That suit you got is jiggas.

1302
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:31,329
- Steal the money like I stole the rest.
- Freeze! Freeze!

1303
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,458
Drop the gun, tough guy.

1304
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:35,628
Officers, you have it all wrong here.
You're all wrong. Listen.

1305
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:38,263
You gotta let me go. Hey, whatcha doin'?
Let me go, Officer.

1306
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:41,035
- Detective, let me...
- Discrimination, goddamn it!

1307
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:45,945
Go, go.
It's my yard, man.

1308
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:47,948
- You go, man. You have the money.
- What are you talking about?

1309
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:49,950
I live here.
Go on through. Go. Go!

1310
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:51,815
I knew I shouldn't have
went to that party.

1311
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:55,322
- Go, man. Go! Go!
- What? What?

1312
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:57,324
- Boom?
- Is the coast clear?

1313
01:24:57,392 --> 01:25:01,328
Get up and go.
Get up!

1314
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:03,330
Take them shoes
with you too.

1315
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:07,664
- But...
- Boom! Go. Pull your pants up.

1316
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:10,135
I see the crack of your ass
hangin' all out, man.

1317
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:15,873
- Who's the asshole now?
- You racist bastard!

1318
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:26,081
Bad old little kids. Excuse me. Where
is the man with the leather jacket?

1319
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:31,158
- We need to take you downtown.
- Yo, baby shit!

1320
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:35,253
Yeah! Surprise!

1321
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:37,863
Oh, I'm sorry. Huh?

1322
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:41,766
Tomorrow we need to take you
downtown and ask you some questions.

1323
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:43,770
Oh, yeah, all right.

1324
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:46,136
I need you to sign here.

1325
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:48,835
<i>Whoo</i>- <i>wee.!</i>
<i>Man, what a day.</i>

1326
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:50,844
<i>Well, those cops,</i>
<i>they got arrested.</i>

1327
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:53,710
<i>My mom and pops, man, they got</i>
<i>back together, so that's all good.</i>

1328
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:56,249
<i>And nobody</i>
<i>got with Tasha anymore.</i>

1329
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:58,478
<i>And the homeless man?</i>
<i>Well, he got away with the money.</i>

1330
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:01,750
<i>I couldn't snitch on him. So I guess</i>
<i>everybody got what they wanted.</i>

1331
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:05,054
<i>And when I say, "Everybody got</i>
<i>what they wanted, "I mean everybody.</i>

1332
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:11,030
No!

1333
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:11,232
<i>You know I was good.</i>

1334
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:12,665
<i>You know I was good.</i>

1335
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:21,135
I just wanted to know if you...

1336
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:24,406
You know what?
You were right.

1337
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:25,878
School is more important.

1338
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:30,908
No, I ain't seen...
Why don't you ask Boom?

1339
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:34,580
I mean,
why don't you ask Slim?

1340
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:36,749
Shit, I already asked Slim.

1341
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:38,519
Shut the fuck up!

1342
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:48,731
- Hi, Dre.
- Hey... I fucked up.

1343
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:51,931
Twenty dollars, man.
Give me my twenty dollars.

1344
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:56,468
- You take credit cards, man.
- Cut!

1345
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,538
Dre! Hey, Dre! Come on!

1346
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:12,087
- Not as wonderful as you.
- Cut that shit down!

1347
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:16,123
Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut.

1348
01:27:16,197 --> 01:27:20,531
Wow, we have an "S-S..."
Oh, we keep on going.

1349
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:23,969
Oh, we forgot the "B."

1350
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:25,471
Perfect.
