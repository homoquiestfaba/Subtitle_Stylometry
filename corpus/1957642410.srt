01:56:12,250 --> 01:56:14,541
- On the boardwalk?
- About... about the young mother,

1538
01:56:14,625 --> 01:56:16,375
the young Jewish mother
and her son...

1539
01:56:16,458 --> 01:56:17,833
- Ah, yes.
- ...walking on the beach.

1540
01:56:18,708 --> 01:56:20,125
They're walking on the beach.

1541
01:56:21,375 --> 01:56:25,291
All of a sudden, a wave
comes out of the blue,

1542
01:56:25,375 --> 01:56:27,625
takes the boy
out into the ocean.

1543
01:56:27,708 --> 01:56:30,125
The young mother, she screams.

1544
01:56:31,125 --> 01:56:34,083
"God, what have you done?

1545
01:56:34,166 --> 01:56:37,083
What have you done
with my only son?"

1546
01:56:37,166 --> 01:56:38,833
Out of nowhere, another wave

1547
01:56:38,916 --> 01:56:41,750
throws the child back
onto the beach.

1548
01:56:41,833 --> 01:56:45,208
She holds him, she squeezes him,
she kisses his head.

1549
01:56:45,291 --> 01:56:47,500
She looks up to the sky
and she says,

1550
01:56:48,375 --> 01:56:49,708
"He had a hat!"

1551
01:56:54,666 --> 01:56:56,041
(LAUGHS)

1552
01:57:00,583 --> 01:57:07,166
(BOTH LAUGH)

1553
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,291
RUSHKA:
<i>We're a long way from our homes,</i>

1554
01:57:22,375 --> 01:57:25,458
<i>and away from much
that has happened to us, and...</i>

1555
01:57:25,541 --> 01:57:27,708
<i>to so many of us.</i>

1556
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:30,625
Now we're here
in this new country,

1557
01:57:30,708 --> 01:57:32,458
where we have been accepted,

1558
01:57:33,625 --> 01:57:35,625
and where we live without fear.

1559
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:38,208
