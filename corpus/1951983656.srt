1
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:13,043
Fuck!

2
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:24,007
Okay,
you caught me.

3
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:25,183
I mean...

4
00:01:25,396 --> 00:01:28,126
men are not the only ones who like
to whack off like zoo monkeys.

5
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,397
Why isn't it okay for girls
to just like fucking?

6
00:01:31,735 --> 00:01:34,636
If you could have sex once a week,
no attachments, no expectations...

7
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:38,365
...just straight up fucking, would you?
- <i>I like fucking.</i>

8
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:41,874
I like it a lot.
Who doesn't?

9
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:44,541
But people make such
a big deal out of it.

10
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:47,808
And there's so much emphasis
placed on appearance.

11
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:52,213
I don't know why. I've had sex
with fat girls and skinny girls...

12
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,521
...it's really all the same.
- <i>I know...</i>

13
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:57,656
that everyone is a little...

14
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:01,196
self-conscious about
how good they are in bed...

15
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:05,024
and I was never really, I guess,
great in bed because...

16
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:07,669
I didn't read Cosmo's latest article
on how to please my man...

17
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:10,465
because I don't read those magazine
articles and, quite frankly...

18
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:12,904
I haven't really been too concerned
about pleasing him.

19
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,442
Fuck me.
I blew a great setup.

20
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:17,341
Did you ever fuck something up and
you knew you were fucking it up...

21
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:18,947
but you did it anyway?

22
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:20,912
Maybe she fucked it up.

23
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:23,780
I don't know. I'll let you people
decide. My opinion is biased.

24
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:26,148
I don't why there's this myth that
women get dependent on men.

25
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:29,324
I mean, every day in America some
guy snaps and kills his girlfriend.

26
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:32,427
They gotta get restraining orders
taken out against them all the time.

27
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,087
Women never do that.
Oh, you think you're immune, pal?

28
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,394
Well, brother, you just haven't met the
girl you wanna fuck and kill someday.

29
00:02:39,603 --> 00:02:40,831
You're a fucking asshole!

30
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:43,268
I was trying to tell you
how much I love, for fuck's sake!

31
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:46,500
- How, if you think I'm fat? Thanks!
- I didn't say that. You're nuts.

32
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,644
- You're paranoid. You realize that?
- No, you're the one that's paranoid.

33
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:51,644
You're the one that gets pissed off
every time Damien comes here.

34
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:53,874
- Grow up!
- Listen, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

35
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:56,109
you got insulted by my attempt
to compliment you.

36
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,414
But if you're gonna bring up your
ex-boyfriend, at least understand...

37
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,250
...why I wan to punch him in the face!
- What the hell is that?

38
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,553
A woman's place in procreation
has always been to attract a man:

39
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:07,560
big tits, small waist
and round ass.

40
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:10,529
And you're really sensitive about
that shit being in its proper place.

41
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:14,033
- I'm not even half as sensitive!
- Okay, tell me that I gained 5 pounds!

42
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:16,172
If I get a new haircut and you didn't
notice, would I give a shit? No!

43
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:19,342
I do not like to be insulted, no,
but that has nothing to do...

44
00:03:19,543 --> 00:03:21,943
with you wanting to punch
somebody in the God damned face!

45
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:23,738
You tell me that you love me
'cause I'm so manly.

46
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:25,505
This is it, this is
the whole package.

47
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:27,911
Oh, shut the fuck up!

48
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:29,679
<i>What a mess!</i>

49
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:33,456
How do two people end up
talking to each other like that?

50
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:36,753
Let me rewind to the
very, very beginning.

51
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:50,430
LA's real interesting,
but it ain't cheap, huh?

52
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:52,472
I'm down to my last hundred.
What'd you got?

53
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:57,204
76... no, 72 bucks.

54
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,646
I bought your cigarettes.

55
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,448
Fuck.

56
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:04,315
I don't understand...

57
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:07,388
we've been here like a month.
We should've found jobs by now.

58
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:09,923
It's the concrete companies here,
they just hire migrant workers.

59
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:11,116
It's bullshit.

60
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,461
You think California
was a bad idea?

61
00:04:17,134 --> 00:04:19,034
Couple guys like us,
we'll get something going.

62
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:21,594
Well, we better get
something going soon.

63
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:24,772
We don't have even have enough
money to get friggin' drunk!

64
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:29,269
When was the last time
we went into a fancy hotel bar...

65
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:32,778
ran up a huge tab
and then just bolted?

66
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:34,678
Shit. Months?

67
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:38,117
Come on, this is the kind of sun shit
we always talked about doing.

68
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:39,721
Fun shit you always
talked about doing.

69
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:41,618
I'm only going along
to make sure you're okay.

70
00:04:41,825 --> 00:04:43,918
Haven't you ever wanted
complete control in bed?

71
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:45,617
They'll have to do whatever
we say, it'll be amazing.

72
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:47,558
How do you even know
how to find male prostitutes?

73
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:48,753
Please tell me you didn't
go on the Internet.

74
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:51,332
No, no, there's this hotel downtown.
It has a lounge.

75
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:52,524
That's what it's famous for.

76
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:54,294
This woman at my salon was
telling me all about it.

77
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:58,065
You go down there, you see the
guys and pick out the one you want.

78
00:04:58,275 --> 00:04:59,708
Sounds very romantic.

79
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:03,770
- How's your black eye by the way?
- Not so bad. I keep covering it up.

80
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:07,409
How do you even do it?
God, you're like Houdini.

81
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:10,052
I keep 'em pre-tied in my nightstand
and I just slip them on.

82
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:13,454
Well, that's you, babe.
Very efficient.

83
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:38,813
Stanny, think that
security guy's onto us.

84
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:42,485
Joe, we've done this to every fancy
hotel in NY for what, ten years?

85
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:44,551
You think some
LA rent-a-cop's gonna bust us?

86
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:45,983
We shouldn't be doing this.

87
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:48,680
They charge us like
seven bucks for a beer.

88
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,792
That's ripping people off.
We're just making shit even.

89
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:54,154
The guy will think that we're
so desperate to get laid that...

90
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:57,663
Stop it! God!
They're gonna be so excited.

91
00:05:57,868 --> 00:06:00,393
They usually have to do it with
a bunch of disgusting old women.

92
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:04,069
- They're gonna think that we...
- They're whores! They're prostitutes.

93
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:07,766
If anyone has issues with their
self-image, it's them, not you.

94
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:11,410
Oh yeah.

95
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:15,949
- Check it out. Check that shit out!
- Wait, wait!

96
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:18,246
- Please don't. We should...
- Hey there.

97
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:22,221
- Hey.
- Hi. California is a friendly place.

98
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,451
Yeah, we're not used
to two beautiful girls...

99
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:28,256
...just walking right up to us.
- So, you two boys have names?

100
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:32,458
- Yeah, I'm Joe. This is Stanny.
- This is Christi Ann. I'm Donna.

101
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:34,432
Hello, Joe and Stanley.

102
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:36,833
No, it's not Stanley, it's Stanny.
There's no "L".

103
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,305
Oh, Stanny.
Does it really matter now?

104
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,375
So, where are you girls
from and stuff?

105
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:44,505
Up in the hills, Laurel Canyon.

106
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:46,342
We just moved to town.

107
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,782
Oh, a couple of regular guys
new in town looking to meet people.

108
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:53,855
Yeah. Yeah, we're both
in construction.

109
00:06:54,057 --> 00:06:57,117
Time's a little slow right now,
but we'll get something going soon.

110
00:06:57,327 --> 00:07:00,262
- Just trying to get by, huh?
- Construction workers.

111
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:02,523
Are you girls like models
or something?

112
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,860
You don't have to belittle us,
we don't usually do this.

113
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:07,093
Let's grab a table.

114
00:07:09,006 --> 00:07:11,907
What, do you work out?
I work out a lot.

115
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:14,335
But usually I get enough
of a workout on the job.

116
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:18,106
We work with concrete.
Shit's heavy.

117
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:21,375
Yes, look, we wanted manly men...
but you're overdoing it...

118
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:24,554
with the blue collar routine.

119
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:29,756
- Is that Drakkar you're wearing?
- Yep. Thanks.

120
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,293
- So, what do you do for a living?
- I'm a writer.

121
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,063
Really?
Like books and shit?

122
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:37,392
Screenwriter,
like movies and shit.

123
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:39,933
Get out of here!
That's so cool.

124
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:41,934
I mean, what have I seen
that you wrote?

125
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,798
Nothing yet. None of my scripts
have been turned into movies yet.

126
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,444
Well, you gotta start
by writing it first, right?

127
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:53,138
- What about you? What do you do?
- Christi Ann is a clothing designer.

128
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,979
- She designed this.
- Really? Very nice.

129
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:58,950
Shit! Christi Ann,
I totally forgot.

130
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:00,145
I was in this coffee shop...

131
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:02,348
and I saw a woman wearing
one of your new shirts.

132
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,083
- Really?
- Man!

133
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:06,728
Somebody took your shit
from the Laundromat?

134
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,795
That happened to me.
Remember that, Stanny?

135
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:11,126
Somebody just took my stuff
from the dryer...

136
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:14,861
and then we see this guy from two
floors up wearing my sweatpants!

137
00:08:15,105 --> 00:08:19,474
No, Joe, she's saying that she
makes clothes. She made this here.

138
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,904
- Oh, you invent clothes!
- Yes, I invent clothes.

139
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:28,380
In fact, people were running around
naked before until I came along.

140
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:30,177
I have to go to the bathroom.

141
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:39,089
I'll be... right back.

142
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,429
California girls, man.
They're fucking unbelievable!

143
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:49,628
Okay, what about the bill?

144
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:53,872
- I think we should hire them.
- Shut up!

145
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:55,601
You flirted, you got
your twisted affirmation.

146
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:56,972
I think we should get out of here.

147
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,875
Look, I'm inviting Stanny
back to the house.

148
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:01,812
If you don't wanna sleep with Joe,
you don't have to.

149
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:10,288
I got it. I'll make it look like
I left my wallet back at the motel.

150
00:09:10,494 --> 00:09:12,724
These girls come here all the time.
They can cover us.

151
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,089
No, that ain't right, man.

152
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:16,265
Why don't we just stick the hotel
with the bill and split?

153
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,400
These girls shouldn't...

154
00:09:18,902 --> 00:09:22,963
I... I think I left my wallet
back at my motel.

155
00:09:23,173 --> 00:09:25,733
Sure you did.
Why don't I just get this round?

156
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:29,875
So, how do you boys wanna do this?
Should we get a room upstairs or?

157
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:32,509
Why don't we just go back
to my house...

158
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:35,276
and we can fool around up there?

159
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:37,777
Okay.

160
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,517
Let me show you my room.

161
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:46,186
Wow!

162
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:51,392
- Is this your parents' house?
- No.

163
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:55,932
No, it's Donna's house.
I just live here.

164
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:02,639
Wow, you must come home
everyday and do this, huh?

165
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:07,416
- No.
- If I lived here, I would.

166
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:16,919
- You like it rough, don't you?
- Yeah!

167
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:19,118
Boy, did you pick the right guy!

168
00:10:20,897 --> 00:10:22,660
Punish me, I'm bad!

169
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:25,391
Look, this was all
my friend's idea. I...

170
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,362
I don't think I can do this.

171
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:31,900
You must have a fancy bar
or something around here, right?

172
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:34,368
Oh, perfect.

173
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,742
Perfect.

174
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:44,019
You don't wanna have sex?
That's fine.

175
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:47,520
Your friend, Donna...

176
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:51,754
she needs to get laid.
You, Christi Ann...

177
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:54,227
you need to get drunk.

178
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:58,763
- What, you wanna get me drunk?
- No, I wanna get me drunk.

179
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:02,496
But I can tell you're one of those,
you know, uptight people...

180
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:06,107
that I love to help out by getting
them good and hammered.

181
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,573
So, here's the deal:

182
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:12,304
for every two drinks that I have...

183
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:18,413
you gotta have one, until you're
either puking or laughing.

184
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,634
- Yeah! Yeah!
- You like that, don't you, nasty?

185
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:42,474
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

186
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:48,312
- You're so bad.
- You're the man! You're the man!

187
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:50,247
I was 15 years old...

188
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:55,914
I'd been jerking off two years
straight, dreaming of this moment.

189
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:58,153
And the second
she goes to kiss it...

190
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:02,356
my dick just starts like,
flapping all over the place!

191
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:04,760
And she looks up at me,
all freaked out.

192
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:09,302
At the same time, whack!
My dick hits her right in the jaw.

193
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:16,103
You're gonna make me come!

194
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:18,644
Oh, my God!

195
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:22,417
- Do you want some water?
- Sure.

196
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:24,280
- Do you like that?
- Oh yeah.

197
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:27,979
I go to the gynecologist like a week
later, 'cause I felt uncomfortable.

198
00:12:28,191 --> 00:12:30,751
I know the doctor's gonna know
it's cause I lost my virginity...

199
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,188
but I don't care, because
I was starting...

200
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:34,454
to get paranoid something's wrong.

201
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:39,267
The doctor finds the condom.

202
00:12:40,403 --> 00:12:42,200
My asshole boyfriend was so
embarrassed to tell me...

203
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:43,394
that he finished right away...

204
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:46,302
so he's moving around 'til
it got soft and it just came off.

205
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:49,603
And the thing was stuck up in me
for like a week!

206
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:51,007
What was he thinking?

207
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:57,275
You're okay? God, that felt so...
Oh, my God! So fucking great!

208
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:02,518
You want a cigarette?

209
00:13:06,262 --> 00:13:08,025
- Do you want some water?
- Sure.

210
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:12,258
That... That was...
That was thrilling.

211
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:14,494
I can't believe it.
That was...

212
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:17,332
Did you like that?
You okay?

213
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:19,364
Want a cigarette?
Here, here's a cigarette.

214
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:21,669
So, should we?

215
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,844
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you do.

216
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:28,711
You know, I've never ever...

217
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:32,684
ever had a one-night stand.

218
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,619
You're the first girl
who's told me that...

219
00:13:37,827 --> 00:13:40,125
who I believe it's true.

220
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,036
- Alright.
- Alright.

221
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:21,499
I'm sorry.
Everything tickles.

222
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,144
I'm sorry.
I don't think I can do this.

223
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:34,045
Okay.

224
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,946
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

225
00:14:38,588 --> 00:14:42,524
How often... do you think men cry?

226
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,223
What the fuck kind
of fucked up question is that?

227
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:46,452
Well, I'm writing this character...

228
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:49,257
and I was just trying to figure out
how real he was.

229
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,400
So I'm asking you how often.

230
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:56,033
Fuck, I don't know
the national average or nothing.

231
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:59,833
And how often
do you think you cry?

232
00:15:00,176 --> 00:15:02,667
Never, really. I mean...

233
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:08,113
life sucks sometimes, but you know,
I get pissed off and shit.

234
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:11,082
Crying never solved nothing.

235
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:19,719
- You guys ever get caught?
- For what?

236
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:23,596
You know, loitering at the bar?

237
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:28,902
Damn, was it that obvious?
It's not like we always do that.

238
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:32,131
You know, it's just something fun
to do when the funds are low.

239
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:35,368
So the he yells out,
"So yeah, I'll call you tomorrow!"

240
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:37,704
Seriously, I swear to God I burst out
laughing.

241
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:40,280
I don't care that it was rude.

242
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:44,685
God!

243
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:52,355
My God!
Are they doing it again?

244
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:56,329
My record is five times.

245
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,937
- One night, five times.
- Wow! Really?

246
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:07,071
I usually do it once. Well, I mean,
sometimes, you know, I've done it...

247
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:08,642
I've had guys who wanted
to do it more.

248
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:10,676
And that one that was finished
after the first time...

249
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,939
but I had another guy who...

250
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:16,181
who would sometimes wanna go
again and sometimes I would.

251
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:23,254
You like... have a thing
with sex, huh?

252
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:30,858
Well, if Donna's gonna do it, I mean
I should... Maybe I'll do it too.

253
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:33,126
- Don't do it on account of her.
- No.

254
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:38,799
- No, no. I want to.
- Alright.

255
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:47,978
I mean, we probably
shouldn't do it here.

256
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,560
- Okay, you gotta relax.
- Oh no, I'm relaxed.

257
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:10,572
You like that?

258
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:16,771
That doesn't feel good?

259
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:24,250
Okay.

260
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:29,648
Okay, okay.

261
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,038
Okay.

262
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:04,452
You know any jokes?

263
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:10,826
No.

264
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,802
A guy walks into a bar...

265
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,874
and the bartender says...

266
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:30,312
Shit, I forgot what he said.
He said something.

267
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,755
We heard you two having fun
last night.

268
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:13,223
Never mind that.

269
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:15,761
Check out the sunrise.
Isn't it beautiful?

270
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:19,059
Cool. I love dusk.

271
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:26,368
Does anybody need anything
to drink? Water, juice?

272
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:28,843
Just sit here and relax, baby.

273
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:33,211
Actually, you know, I...

274
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,281
I should probably try
and get some sleep.

275
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:37,385
I've got a lot of writing
to do tomorrow.

276
00:19:37,954 --> 00:19:41,754
- I mean, today.
- Yeah, I guess it is getting kinda late.

277
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:45,050
So, I guess you boys deserve
to get paid.

278
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:46,250
How much do we owe you anyway?

279
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:49,590
Yeah, you know, I have to admit
I was opposed to the idea...

280
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:52,398
but I think, who knows,
maybe in like six months...

281
00:19:52,602 --> 00:19:56,163
if we're still two lonely women,
we might call you again.

282
00:19:56,372 --> 00:19:59,398
Yeah. Leave us your cards,
your pager numbers or whatever.

283
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:00,940
Can you take a check?

284
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:03,669
Cause I don't think we have
that much laying around.

285
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,314
- A check?
- It's good.

286
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:10,077
Look, we can go to an ATM.
How much do we owe you, anyway?

287
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:12,946
I mean, I have money.
Hold on.

288
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:17,252
Wait a minute. Do you think
that we're prostitutes?

289
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:28,026
What, making fun of the girls
who've never done this before?

290
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:31,269
So, what's the damage?
I have 1,000 dollars.

291
00:20:31,474 --> 00:20:33,169
You gotta tip 'em,
mine was really good.

292
00:20:33,843 --> 00:20:36,004
Wait. You're serious?

293
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,506
Why is everything getting
all strange all of a sudden?

294
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:42,547
I asked you if you'd ever
been arrested...

295
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:44,913
Yeah, for drinking dash.
We're not gigolos!

296
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,180
We thought you girls just
wanna hang out and stuff!

297
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:50,523
- You're serious?
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious!

298
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:53,058
We're hanging out at the bar,
you roll up on us...

299
00:20:53,262 --> 00:20:55,196
you say you wanna fuck us, what
the hell are we supposed to think?

300
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:57,263
We never said you had
to pay us to fuck you!

301
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:02,267
Wait a second. What about that
1,000 bucks? That was pretty cool.

302
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:03,938
Joe, they think
we're male prostitutes.

303
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,768
They're kicking us out of here,
they never wanna see us again.

304
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:13,312
Man! I thought you thought
I was funny and stuff!

305
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:21,179
So, you two are really two
construction workers from Queens?

306
00:21:21,924 --> 00:21:23,949
Yeah!

307
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:28,285
I knew this was gonna happen!

308
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,795
I can't believe you made me do this!
I am so mortified!

309
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,663
I didn't make you, how was
I supposed to know they were...

310
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:36,964
- Gross! God!
- Fuck you, ew!

311
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:39,141
You sure seemed to like
when I had your legs in the air!

312
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:42,072
Goddamned freaks!
Wanna get spanked and shit?

313
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:45,179
We are not freaks! You're the one
who wanted to spank me!

314
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:47,345
Yeah, but I didn't know
I was getting hired to do it!

315
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,677
Come on, Joe,
let's get the fuck out of here.

316
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:55,253
- I don't believe it. I've been used!
- Must be some rich girl thing.

317
00:21:55,892 --> 00:21:59,089
California girls!
Where are we?

318
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:01,990
You think they'll still
give us the money?

319
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:03,563
Oh, they'd better!

320
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:07,493
I'm never drinking again. I can't
believe you made me do this.

321
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:10,263
Stop blaming me! Hell, you were
with the really stupid one.

322
00:22:10,473 --> 00:22:12,031
Why couldn't you tell
he was just some moron?

323
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:14,368
Why couldn't you tell?! God!

324
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:18,040
And Jesus, they were both morons.
Your guy was drooling all over you.

325
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:19,475
It was pathetic!

326
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:23,808
- I forgot something.
- Yeah?

327
00:22:25,655 --> 00:22:27,316
Never mind.

328
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:54,346
Stanny, wake up.

329
00:22:55,751 --> 00:23:00,154
We gotta go find a place
to live. And a job!

330
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:10,293
- Can you believe those bitches?
- Just forget about it, bro.

331
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:14,359
Let's just go find a place to stay.

332
00:23:14,704 --> 00:23:17,298
We have enough for
a deposit now, right?

333
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:22,736
What are you talking about? We have
80 something bucks left between us.

334
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:26,073
We made 1,000 dollars last night.

335
00:23:30,086 --> 00:23:32,418
What, they wouldn't give it to you?

336
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,646
- No.
- No, they wouldn't give it to you?

337
00:23:34,857 --> 00:23:38,384
- Stanny, you didn't ask them, did you?
- No, I didn't fucking ask them.

338
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:40,357
Fuck them, friggin' rich chicks!
I don't need their money.

339
00:23:40,563 --> 00:23:42,895
I'm a working man.
I worked my whole fuckin' life.

340
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:45,158
Can you believe that one girl
told me she was a writer?

341
00:23:45,368 --> 00:23:48,064
Yeah, if I had rich parents, I'd tell
people I was the King of Egypt.

342
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,103
We really could've used
that thousand bucks, Stanny.

343
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:55,571
Well, you wanna hike back up there
and get the money, go ahead.

344
00:23:55,945 --> 00:23:57,776
I need cigarettes.

345
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:19,631
Christi Ann, I'm sorry.
The whole thing was my idea...

346
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:22,326
and I shouldn't have forced you to do
something that you didn't wanna do.

347
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:25,837
It's okay. Maybe we'll look back
at it and laugh.

348
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:27,771
Look, I'm really sorry
'cause I know you.

349
00:24:27,977 --> 00:24:29,774
And you wouldn't have done
anything with that guy.

350
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:33,039
You probably only did it 'cause
you didn't want me to do it alone.

351
00:24:33,716 --> 00:24:35,775
Well, that's true. But...

352
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:39,316
I don't know,
my guy was kinda cute.

353
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:42,188
- Was he?
- He wasn't very smart...

354
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:43,756
but he was really sweet.

355
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,419
- How was he in bed?
- He was fine.

356
00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:48,563
Just fine? Mine was nuts.

357
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:54,527
- What, like crazy nuts?
- No, nuts like amazing nuts!

358
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,063
- Wow. Really?
- It only stands to reason.

359
00:24:57,273 --> 00:24:59,434
Good in bed,
fucking asshole in the morning.

360
00:24:59,642 --> 00:25:01,473
You need to take that up
with your therapist.

361
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:04,045
Next time I come up with
a stupid idea...

362
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:05,645
just tell me I'm being stupid, okay?

363
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:07,944
- Deal.
- Friends?

364
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:10,107
Okay.

365
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:28,196
Joe.

366
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,602
- Hi.
- Hi.

367
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,169
- Your name is Joe, right?
- Yeah, Joe Santarella.

368
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:36,772
Nice to meet you.

369
00:25:37,012 --> 00:25:38,570
Thank you for telling me
your last name...

370
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:40,874
'cause I have a short mental list
of the men I've had sex with...

371
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,813
and I would've hated
just to have Joe.

372
00:25:46,055 --> 00:25:48,285
I was hoping that...

373
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:52,257
I could get that money from you.
Stanny and I, we're...

374
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:54,986
gonna get booted out
of this motel and...

375
00:25:55,197 --> 00:25:58,257
since you guys were gonna give us
a thousand bucks anyway...

376
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:00,094
We could really use it.

377
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:03,937
Yeah, sure.

378
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:07,398
Can you hold on a second?

379
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:18,879
What's up?

380
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:21,514
It's Joe.
They want the money.

381
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,657
- Is Stanny there too?
- No, just Joe.

382
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:26,719
He's probably gonna
sleep for two days.

383
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:29,159
I mean, I fucked him so hard
he was incoherent.

384
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:31,356
You know, when you
fuck a guy into a coma?

385
00:26:32,268 --> 00:26:34,896
No, obviously I don't
because he's fully conscious.

386
00:26:35,104 --> 00:26:37,299
Why do you ask me questions
you already know the answers to?

387
00:26:37,506 --> 00:26:39,440
Why should we even pay them?
I mean, every other guy...

388
00:26:39,642 --> 00:26:41,371
in America went home drunk
and lonely last night.

389
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:43,238
They're getting booted
from their motel, plus...

390
00:26:43,445 --> 00:26:45,572
I don't think they have a car.
I think he walked here.

391
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:50,681
Fuck it.
Go ahead, pay him.

392
00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:54,617
Although I gotta admit, best 500
bucks I have spent in a long time.

393
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:11,365
Thanks. This is really gonna help.
I appreciate it.

394
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,671
Nice meeting you, then.

395
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:26,886
Bye.

396
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:35,155
I was a really lousy lay,
wasn't I?

397
00:27:38,234 --> 00:27:39,826
No.

398
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:47,006
Look, usually when people first
have sex, they're a little inhibited.

399
00:27:49,211 --> 00:27:51,975
No, that was me at my best.

400
00:27:52,982 --> 00:27:55,576
But thanks for being honest.

401
00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:20,569
- What's the matter?
- I'm...

402
00:28:20,776 --> 00:28:22,505
I don't know, you know
how I'm a shitty dancer?

403
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:25,976
How every other girl in the world
can dance, but I have no rhythm.

404
00:28:26,348 --> 00:28:28,578
- You dance fine.
- Fine!

405
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:31,378
- Great. Story of my sex life: fine.
- Wait a minute.

406
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:36,786
Are we talking about your sex life
or about you being a shitty dancer?

407
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:42,521
I'm a shitty lover, I'm a shitty
kisser, I'm a shitty blowjob giver...

408
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:45,393
- And never mind...
- I thought you didn't give blowjobs.

409
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:48,934
I don't. I can't. I don't know,
I missed that class in college.

410
00:28:49,138 --> 00:28:51,698
Man, that's the only thing
I do remember about college.

411
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,309
How come I never fucked a guy...

412
00:28:56,512 --> 00:28:57,877
until he was laying there
like a zombie?

413
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,310
I wanna turn a guy into a zombie.

414
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:10,958
Look, I just think this is
too extreme an idea!

415
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,149
You said you wanted to get laid!

416
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:14,693
We'll have them come in at night,
or every couple days...

417
00:29:14,897 --> 00:29:16,330
you know, we'll hardly notice
they're there.

418
00:29:16,598 --> 00:29:19,089
I just don't like people knowing
my private business.

419
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:21,963
- I didn't live with my boyfriends...
- They're not living with us.

420
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:23,829
They're crashing in the pool house,
like our neighbors.

421
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,097
But we have to share
the yard with them.

422
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:26,899
Please! When have you ever
gone in the back yard?

423
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:28,406
We go in that pool
maybe once a month.

424
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,271
When did you become
the nympho all of a sudden?

425
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:33,505
Well, not all of us got
to sport fuck through school!

426
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:36,646
Excuse me, it was college,
and everybody else was fucking!

427
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:39,343
You were just too uptight,
so don't talk shit about me.

428
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:42,888
Besides, you're supposed to have
cabana boy when you're 45, not 25.

429
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,751
I'm sorry I called you
a sport fucker.

430
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:50,259
You really think this will
help you get some experience...

431
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:52,491
or confidence boosting
with some boy toy?

432
00:29:53,302 --> 00:29:56,066
I guess so. Yes, exactly.

433
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:09,073
We don't have to pay the rent.

434
00:30:09,284 --> 00:30:12,651
We'll have somewhere to stay
until we get on our feet.

435
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:17,689
I don't know. There's some weird
catch to this you ain't telling me.

436
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:22,091
Stanny, we're about a week away
from getting booted outta this motel.

437
00:30:22,297 --> 00:30:27,064
We don't have jobs. This is about the
best thing that ever happened to us.

438
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:31,472
- Are we allowed to go in the pool?
- I guess so.

439
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:34,940
- How often I gotta fuck her?
- Come on, man.

440
00:30:35,144 --> 00:30:38,477
I know you like fucking her
even if you don't like her.

441
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,808
Yeah, she's nasty.
Still, how come...

442
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:44,443
how come I get the bitchy one
and you get the nice one?

443
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:46,644
Mine's a terrible lay.

444
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:47,981
She can't even kiss.
It's like...

445
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,920
making out with a baloney
sandwich or something.

446
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:53,185
- Really?
- Yeah, she's like...

447
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,593
- It's terrible.
- Okay.

448
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,130
I can't believe this.

449
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,302
I have gotta go write.
I can't spend all day doing this.

450
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:03,903
Yeah, but you said yourself you can't
write when you're not getting laid.

451
00:31:04,106 --> 00:31:07,269
This is gonna cure any
writer's block you've ever had.

452
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:14,905
Okay, you understand:
we don't want boyfriends.

453
00:31:15,117 --> 00:31:18,450
We don't want boyfriends,
we don't want relationships.

454
00:31:18,654 --> 00:31:22,021
We want two guys to service us,
this is strictly sexual.

455
00:31:22,224 --> 00:31:25,751
You're on call 24 hours. We get laid
when we want, how we want.

456
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:29,863
You work for us. We'll give you
a place to stay in the pool house...

457
00:31:30,065 --> 00:31:32,465
and you're not allowed in the house
unless you're working.

458
00:31:32,668 --> 00:31:34,863
You know, and during the day
you can look for legitimate jobs...

459
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,628
and try to save money
until you get on your feet.

460
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:39,672
Okay, alright. But we got
a few small requirements.

461
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:43,267
We want TV with a satellite
in the pool house.

462
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:47,142
I have a TV. And I'm sure you know
how to run a cable through the yard.

463
00:31:47,683 --> 00:31:50,083
Anything else?

464
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,619
Beer.

465
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:09,400
Know what I love about LA, Joe?

466
00:32:09,605 --> 00:32:12,506
People don't date.
They just move in.

467
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:28,689
Yo! Yo!

468
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:32,756
- Dick, gimme it.
- You're being a dick, man, I found it.

469
00:32:32,961 --> 00:32:34,792
Dude, it ain't yours. It belongs
to somebody else, let me have it.

470
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:37,431
It ain't yours either, man.

471
00:32:47,276 --> 00:32:51,542
- They're fighting over a ball.
- Just spray them with the hose.

472
00:32:54,116 --> 00:32:56,277
Should we do something?

473
00:32:56,752 --> 00:32:59,346
They're probably hungry,
put a bowl of food out for 'em.

474
00:32:59,555 --> 00:33:01,955
- Let go, dick!
- Gimme it!

475
00:33:02,157 --> 00:33:04,318
It's my ball, man!

476
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:13,225
You guys hungry?

477
00:33:20,943 --> 00:33:22,001
Where are you going?
Isn't it Saturday?

478
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,007
No, I'm going to the store.
It's open.

479
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:26,680
In fact, I have a very important
meeting with a fashion rep.

480
00:33:34,323 --> 00:33:36,018
Okay.

481
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:39,216
Bye.

482
00:33:43,966 --> 00:33:47,527
I'm going to write.
You two boys behave yourselves.

483
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:50,330
- Don't you write at home?
- Too distracting.

484
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,199
See that, Joe?

485
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:59,539
They're up all night on Friday
and then go to work on Saturday.

486
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:02,444
Yeah, they're like guys.

487
00:34:02,818 --> 00:34:07,221
Hardworking. Like us.
I respect that.

488
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:11,518
Look, fashion week is next month.
All the top designers, all the critics...

489
00:34:11,727 --> 00:34:14,389
...every magazine are gonna be there.
- Yeah, I know.

490
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:17,156
No, I know you know.
You're a designer but I'm the rep.

491
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:18,697
And I'm very successful
at getting people in.

492
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:23,234
- Absolutely. You're one of the best.
- My being the best isn't the point.

493
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:26,669
The point is that's very difficult
to get into fashion week.

494
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:29,343
Only a certain amount of designers
get in. You're lucky.

495
00:34:29,544 --> 00:34:32,479
This guy just dropped out.
Drugs, overdose, who cares?

496
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:34,342
- I want you to take his place.
- Are you serious?

497
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:35,641
- You can get my line in?
- Yeah.

498
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:38,319
Just have your line ready.
And putting the show on isn't cheap.

499
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,351
You're gonna have to pay
for all this yourself.

500
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:42,022
Don't come to me.
I'm not the bank.

501
00:34:42,224 --> 00:34:43,384
Well...

502
00:34:43,592 --> 00:34:45,617
...I cab barely make ends meet now...
- Make it happen.

503
00:34:45,827 --> 00:34:47,158
I make the rest happen.

504
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:52,492
How do you like my dog? Makes me
seem warm and approachable, right?

505
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:15,755
- Think we're invited for dinner?
- Shit, I guess not.

506
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:19,824
- I think we're slaves.
- We are.

507
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:23,928
- We are whores.
- We are, aren't we?

508
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:28,099
Should we go invite them in?

509
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:30,362
No, we always make enough
food for four.

510
00:35:30,572 --> 00:35:33,473
I don't know, I guess I just
thought you were... I don't know.

511
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:37,540
You are such a liar. You always
act like this when you like a guy.

512
00:35:37,746 --> 00:35:40,180
Don't even!
I like fucking the guy.

513
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:47,051
- Boys, dinner's ready!
- Guess we're invited.

514
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:55,859
This is a good gig
we got going on here.

515
00:35:56,064 --> 00:35:58,965
- So don't, you know, mess it up.
- What do you mean?

516
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:03,365
You know what I mean. You can just
kinda piss people off sometimes.

517
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:39,296
So, how come y'all didn't
have girlfriends back home?

518
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:42,940
What?

519
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:46,603
Did you just kick me? She asked
a legitimate question. I'll answer it.

520
00:36:46,815 --> 00:36:49,079
No, no, never mind.
It was a stupid question.

521
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:55,686
Tell you why we didn't have
girlfriends back home.

522
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:59,791
Three simple words:
women are morons.

523
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:05,096
Excuse me?
Are you for real?

524
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,598
He just said all women are morons
and I'm included in that group.

525
00:37:07,803 --> 00:37:10,795
- I mean, you know what I mean.
- He didn't mean you two.

526
00:37:16,178 --> 00:37:18,738
And where do you get off
saying something like that anyway?

527
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,915
No, I'm trying not to piss you off,
so forget it.

528
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:24,483
No, no, please.
Please, let's hear this.

529
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:28,212
Women wanna be treated like shit.

530
00:37:28,423 --> 00:37:29,720
Thus the fact: they're morons.

531
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:32,758
Can you generalize a bit more?

532
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:35,896
Listen, whether she's a supermodel,
works at a daycare center...

533
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:40,124
ugly, hot, it don't matter. You all look
for the guy that pisses you off...

534
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:42,064
a guy you couldn't complain
about try and fix.

535
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,362
Should I complain about men?

536
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:44,971
Where should I be getting?
First of all...

537
00:37:45,173 --> 00:37:46,265
You wanna know the number
one complain...

538
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:48,738
I hear about men from women?

539
00:37:48,944 --> 00:37:51,674
"He's too nice."
That's considered a detriment.

540
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,110
Show me some girl can date
any guy she wants:

541
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:56,045
fifty bucks says
she's with some asshole.

542
00:37:56,251 --> 00:37:57,240
They don't want nice.
They want asshole.

543
00:37:57,452 --> 00:37:59,044
Okay, let's just drop it
'cause you're pissing me off now.

544
00:37:59,254 --> 00:38:02,655
Alright. I'm a guy. I'm the one
suffering the injustice of it all.

545
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:04,391
You don't see guys saying...

546
00:38:04,593 --> 00:38:06,993
"Yeah, I broke up with this girl
because she was too nice".

547
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:08,762
I don't do anything shitty.

548
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:10,397
Guys break up with you
'cause you're too nice?

549
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:13,796
- No, I break up with them.
- Oh, yeah? How come?

550
00:38:21,076 --> 00:38:24,512
Stanny, it's not
in your job description.

551
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:27,105
You're right.
Would you like some sex?

552
00:38:27,315 --> 00:38:29,783
You have a way with words.
You should be a writer too.

553
00:38:30,886 --> 00:38:31,944
Oh yeah, I'm gonna write a book.
It's called...

554
00:38:32,153 --> 00:38:35,054
"Men Are From Mars and
Women Are Fucking Morons"!

555
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:42,320
What? Bro, this is what they're really
paying for, they want to hear abuse.

556
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,122
You should thank me.
All you can do is sit there.

557
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:46,232
You look like Mr. Compassionate
next to me.

558
00:38:48,336 --> 00:38:51,533
So, wait.
If all they want is abuse...

559
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,731
and I'm the nice guy...

560
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:56,968
does that make me
the good one or the bad one?

561
00:38:57,779 --> 00:39:00,179
We're a team.
We're a team, brother.

562
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,722
My God.

563
00:39:14,663 --> 00:39:18,531
Right there. That was so good.
Don't stop.

564
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:24,034
While I'm down here
can I ask you something?

565
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,104
Well, okay.

566
00:39:26,608 --> 00:39:28,735
Where the hell does the pee
come out of this thing?

567
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:32,710
- No, don't stop what you're doing.
- You want me to explain specifically...

568
00:39:33,148 --> 00:39:34,979
That's okay, later.

569
00:39:57,072 --> 00:40:02,009
Fucking amazing view. I could stand
here for hours and just take it in.

570
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:06,039
Yeah, it's funny.
Never really come out here anymore.

571
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:12,410
I'm sorry if I offended you before.
I was just fucking around.

572
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,884
No, you weren't.

573
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,054
No, I guess I wasn't.

574
00:40:18,259 --> 00:40:20,227
Actually, it's alright.

575
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:24,595
I'm writing and you're giving me
a lot of good material.

576
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:28,934
- What do you mean?
- I guess writing is...

577
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:32,072
just putting down on paper
what people say.

578
00:40:32,273 --> 00:40:35,640
I forget sometimes
how the male mind works.

579
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:40,472
It's good just to, you know,
get it down.

580
00:40:40,682 --> 00:40:42,343
I hope you're learning something.

581
00:40:43,051 --> 00:40:46,452
Let's just say my characters
are coming to life.

582
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,483
You must be a really great writer.

583
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:53,585
How do you know
how good or bad I am?

584
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:55,490
'Cause you got conviction, you know.

585
00:40:55,697 --> 00:40:59,531
Not a lot of girls are like that.
When you talk about men or sex...

586
00:40:59,734 --> 00:41:02,931
you don't apologize, you don't
hold back. You just say shit.

587
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:06,065
You got something to say.
I love that.

588
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,840
I think it's time
you got back to work.

589
00:41:21,556 --> 00:41:23,615
That was amazing.

590
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:29,960
Don't be shy to tell someone
what you like.

591
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:32,065
People miss out on great sex
all the time...

592
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:34,963
just because they're shy about it.

593
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,502
It's just communication.

594
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:44,211
- You're secretly very smart.
- I know. Don't tell anyone.

595
00:41:44,412 --> 00:41:48,178
- No one would believe me anyway.
- Okay.

596
00:41:49,084 --> 00:41:51,985
So, there's gotta be something
you've never done...

597
00:41:52,187 --> 00:41:55,020
something you swore
you'd never do.

598
00:41:55,223 --> 00:41:58,784
- Yes, there is but I'm not gonna do it.
- Well, why not?

599
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,794
Is it something that your last few
boyfriends wanted you to do...

600
00:42:01,996 --> 00:42:03,896
and you wouldn't?

601
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:06,090
Oh, yeah.

602
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:14,808
Tell me, how come you write? I mean,
you don't really have to do anything.

603
00:42:15,009 --> 00:42:17,068
Why do you write stuff?

604
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:20,177
I don't know.

605
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:24,750
I guess I should have some Byzantine,
philosophical reason why, but...

606
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:27,717
mostly I just like making
things up. It's fun.

607
00:42:27,956 --> 00:42:29,651
Yeah, it probably is, huh?

608
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:34,359
It's kind of like reading a great
book or going to a great movie.

609
00:42:34,562 --> 00:42:36,792
It's just this amazing escape.

610
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:42,434
Yeah, fuck reality.
I just drink more.

611
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:48,566
- Okay, you just gotta relax.
- Oh, my God. No, no, no.

612
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:52,405
This isn't physically possible to...
No, this can't fit.

613
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:56,050
What d'you mean? You've seen
the size of my dick, right?

614
00:42:56,584 --> 00:42:59,576
Well, have you ever taken
a poop that big?

615
00:43:00,355 --> 00:43:03,882
See? It's gotta fit then. All you have
to do is just relax a little bit.

616
00:43:04,092 --> 00:43:07,323
So here we go, just relax.
Here, look.

617
00:43:07,896 --> 00:43:13,232
- My God! Did I just?
- What? Did you what?

618
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,800
- Just relax.
- This is so fucking overrated.

619
00:43:17,005 --> 00:43:20,031
This is the furthest thing
from sexual I've ever done!

620
00:43:23,211 --> 00:43:28,342
No, no, I should go in.
I didn't get any sleep last night.

621
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:30,541
Alright.

622
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,653
Good night.

623
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:42,619
Good night.

624
00:43:50,071 --> 00:43:54,599
- I can't believe I did that.
- My aunt Emily used to say...

625
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:58,108
"You never know if you like
something until you try it".

626
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:09,420
Is she alone?

627
00:44:10,391 --> 00:44:13,918
I don't know.
Sounds like it.

628
00:44:16,397 --> 00:44:17,955
Joe, maybe you should leave
because I think...

629
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:21,567
this whole thing's made Donna
really uncomfortable.

630
00:44:24,372 --> 00:44:26,101
Okay.

631
00:44:32,513 --> 00:44:35,710
You know, Stanny's funny and
everything, but he's so intense.

632
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:41,219
I don't know, I think sometimes
he just needs to get over himself.

633
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:46,223
- Don't do that, okay?
- Do what?

634
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:50,058
- Don't talk shit about my friend.
- I wasn't talking shit.

635
00:44:50,265 --> 00:44:53,757
I didn't... I was just saying
that I... No, I'm serious.

636
00:44:53,968 --> 00:44:57,301
- Whatever.
- I didn't mean to get you all defensive.

637
00:44:57,505 --> 00:44:58,836
Wait.

638
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,405
Joe, gimme a break.

639
00:45:00,608 --> 00:45:04,601
Joe, I didn't mean that. I promise
I didn't mean that in a nasty way.

640
00:45:11,653 --> 00:45:15,214
You know how I said Stanny and I
got kicked outta Concrete Union?

641
00:45:16,624 --> 00:45:19,593
Well, it was me
that got kicked out.

642
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:23,628
It was for a stupid reason,
and that's the point.

643
00:45:24,132 --> 00:45:28,592
Stanny came with me
to the hearing.

644
00:45:28,836 --> 00:45:31,202
We had great jobs.

645
00:45:31,439 --> 00:45:33,805
And he told the guys on the board,
"That's bullshit".

646
00:45:34,008 --> 00:45:37,466
And if you're gonna kick me out,
then might as well kick him out too".

647
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,244
And they did?

648
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:46,113
Yeah, well, Stanny didn't
exactly say it so nicely.

649
00:45:47,322 --> 00:45:52,919
But he wasn't mad. We got
shitcanned from a solid union job.

650
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:59,623
22 bucks an hour. And he just said,
"Fuck it. Let's move to California".

651
00:46:00,501 --> 00:46:02,093
So we did.

652
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:08,368
We just have this understanding,
wherever we go, we go together.

653
00:46:10,144 --> 00:46:12,009
That's a good friend you have.

654
00:46:13,147 --> 00:46:14,944
Yeah.

655
00:46:39,941 --> 00:46:43,001
- What time is it?
- Almost midnight.

656
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,339
- How was your first lesson?
- Shut up.

657
00:46:49,817 --> 00:46:52,945
What's that smile for?
Did you get some too?

658
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:55,922
Maybe.

659
00:47:01,429 --> 00:47:03,056
To us.

660
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:07,829
Brother, we are the
mack fucking daddies.

661
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:10,526
Man, it ain't easy.

662
00:47:10,738 --> 00:47:13,400
This girl don't know
the first thing about sex.

663
00:47:13,608 --> 00:47:16,042
We could trade tomorrow
if you want.

664
00:47:16,744 --> 00:47:18,143
No.

665
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:21,243
She's a doll, I like her.
Besides...

666
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:25,112
I'm helping her with something that's
gonna make her whole life richer.

667
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,651
Yeah. We're good fucking
Samaritans, that's all.

668
00:47:27,855 --> 00:47:29,686
Seriously.

669
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:33,823
Just like a sister I never had,
just sweet.

670
00:47:35,096 --> 00:47:39,556
Yeah, I wish I had a sister
to instruct on proper ass fucking.

671
00:47:47,742 --> 00:47:50,006
Hello?

672
00:47:50,311 --> 00:47:52,677
- Anybody home?
- Hi, Damien.

673
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,071
What's new with you guys?

674
00:47:56,617 --> 00:47:59,586
- How's the store going?
- Good. How's the movie going?

675
00:47:59,987 --> 00:48:01,181
God pushed.

676
00:48:01,389 --> 00:48:05,120
Man, all these studios waste a lot
of money making good scripts lousy.

677
00:48:05,326 --> 00:48:06,725
When are you gonna finish
your script?

678
00:48:06,928 --> 00:48:08,725
- I wanna read it.
- It's getting there.

679
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:11,262
Just working in the second act.
It kinds of slows down.

680
00:48:11,466 --> 00:48:14,594
Well, why don't you let me
look at it, give you some notes?

681
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:22,634
Hey, bro.

682
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,908
There's some dude
in the house with them.

683
00:48:27,181 --> 00:48:28,705
Who the fuck is that dick?

684
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,281
You have to be more assertive.

685
00:48:30,485 --> 00:48:31,645
You should've seen the rep
I met today.

686
00:48:31,853 --> 00:48:33,377
She was the most confident person
I've ever met...

687
00:48:33,588 --> 00:48:35,988
This has nothing to do
with confidence, okay?

688
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,521
The script is not ready yet, okay?

689
00:48:37,725 --> 00:48:40,250
So I do not wanna show it to anybody
until I'm happy with it.

690
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:43,988
- Somebody's a little tense.
- I am not tense, okay? I'm just...

691
00:48:44,499 --> 00:48:47,263
I do not appreciate my ex-boyfriend
and my best friend...

692
00:48:47,468 --> 00:48:49,663
trying to tell me how to run
my business, okay?

693
00:48:49,871 --> 00:48:52,135
We heard some yelling,
so we came over.

694
00:48:52,373 --> 00:48:55,740
- We were arguing about nothing.
- I'm Damien Radford.

695
00:48:55,943 --> 00:48:58,844
- Joe Santarella.
- Yeah, I'm Stanny.

696
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,980
I'm renting the pool house
out to them.

697
00:49:01,182 --> 00:49:03,707
The pool hou?
You mean the cabana?

698
00:49:03,918 --> 00:49:07,115
- Yeah, they just got into town.
- Cool.

699
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:10,552
I was just getting ready to go
to bed, Damien. Good night.

700
00:49:10,758 --> 00:49:13,226
Gosh, actually, me too.

701
00:49:14,729 --> 00:49:15,855
Hey, you guys play videogames?

702
00:49:16,063 --> 00:49:17,690
- No.
- Yeah.

703
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:21,301
Don't mention anything
about your job here.

704
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:23,299
Why not?

705
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,814
This whole thing with the boys
is getting out of hand already.

706
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:39,646
This has nothing to do
with Stanny and Joe.

707
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:42,721
Well, I've got all kinds of people
tripping in and out of the house.

708
00:49:43,491 --> 00:49:45,652
- I'm talking about your career.
- And...

709
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,953
let's not bring that up
in front of Damien, okay?

710
00:49:48,162 --> 00:49:52,098
Because I'm sick of him
needling me about my work.

711
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,325
Okay. Sorry.

712
00:49:54,735 --> 00:49:56,464
But, you know, I...

713
00:49:56,737 --> 00:50:00,468
I was really nervous about opening
my store, but I didn't have a choice.

714
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:03,005
And I think sometimes I'm lucky
my family didn't have money...

715
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,077
because I always had to put myself
out there. It's how I pay my bills.

716
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,770
What're you getting at?

717
00:50:09,884 --> 00:50:12,580
I just think sometimes your back's
never up against the wall...

718
00:50:12,787 --> 00:50:15,187
so you never have to push hard
to move forward.

719
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:16,378
Okay, and what about you?

720
00:50:16,591 --> 00:50:19,321
Isn't that rep supposed to be getting
your stuff into stores over the world?

721
00:50:19,794 --> 00:50:22,456
Yeah. But I can't afford to do that.

722
00:50:22,663 --> 00:50:25,154
And if I had money like you,
I would put up a show...

723
00:50:25,366 --> 00:50:27,425
and then I would have
backers to start manufacturing.

724
00:50:27,635 --> 00:50:30,297
Excuse me? What'd you mean
if you had money like me?

725
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:34,330
Exactly like I said. If I had money
to do the show, I would.

726
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:37,636
I just think you need to be a little
more aggressive. That's all.

727
00:50:37,845 --> 00:50:40,245
Okay, I got it.
I've got money but no balls.

728
00:50:40,448 --> 00:50:43,906
You've got balls but no money.
Shut the light off on your way out.

729
00:50:53,227 --> 00:50:55,957
You almost got me there, sporty!

730
00:50:56,364 --> 00:50:59,162
"Sporty". That's funny.

731
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:04,836
- How do you know the girls?
- Donna and I dated for like a year.

732
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,031
But, yeah, I stay friends
with all my ex-girlfriends.

733
00:51:08,242 --> 00:51:09,903
It's like Zen Buddhism thing.

734
00:51:30,998 --> 00:51:32,795
Make you a business offer?

735
00:51:34,735 --> 00:51:37,499
- Okay.
- Look...

736
00:51:38,939 --> 00:51:40,304
I invest in all kinds of things.

737
00:51:40,508 --> 00:51:42,874
Why don't I invest
in your putting on a show?

738
00:51:43,077 --> 00:51:46,069
You put on a big fashion show.
You have a blowout party and...

739
00:51:47,114 --> 00:51:48,604
you're the next Donna Karan.

740
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,579
Donna, you've read me all wrong.

741
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:57,383
I wasn't trying to hit you up
for a loan.

742
00:52:05,766 --> 00:52:07,757
I know you weren't.

743
00:52:10,304 --> 00:52:11,566
Look, Christi Ann,
your store does well...

744
00:52:11,772 --> 00:52:14,070
and if that rep knows
what she's talking about, then...

745
00:52:14,275 --> 00:52:17,301
it's not a favor.
It's a good investment.

746
00:52:21,682 --> 00:52:23,377
Are you serious?

747
00:52:25,352 --> 00:52:27,115
Okay.

748
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:29,414
Yeah, let's do it.

749
00:52:30,057 --> 00:52:31,490
But you have to promise me
you'll finish that script...

750
00:52:31,692 --> 00:52:34,320
and start sending it out.
No more excuses.

751
00:52:35,563 --> 00:52:38,396
- Okay.
- Okay.

752
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:43,194
Gee, this is crazy. Why am I gonna
show my new men's clothes?

753
00:52:43,404 --> 00:52:45,065
I just started making these.

754
00:52:45,272 --> 00:52:46,933
- They look great to me.
- Thank you.

755
00:52:47,141 --> 00:52:50,508
Alright, the word's out, lots of buzz.
All the critics are gonna be there...

756
00:52:50,711 --> 00:52:52,303
mostly because of the celebrities.

757
00:52:52,513 --> 00:52:54,572
You know, I'm not sure
who I hate more frankly.

758
00:52:54,782 --> 00:52:59,378
Actually, no, that's not true. I hate
them all. But I do love this dress.

759
00:53:00,387 --> 00:53:02,116
Please tell me
you're sleeping with him.

760
00:53:03,057 --> 00:53:05,924
- No, he's just an employee.
- Put him on the runway.

761
00:53:06,193 --> 00:53:08,320
- Well, I don't know if I'm...
- No, you have to.

762
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:09,655
It'll be a fun surprise.

763
00:53:09,864 --> 00:53:13,732
Think about it: hot new designer
puts warehouse boy on catwalk.

764
00:53:13,934 --> 00:53:18,428
It's brilliant. It's a tease.
Leave them wanting more. I gotta go.

765
00:53:21,909 --> 00:53:25,242
- This is the last box.
- Will you do me a favor?

766
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,914
Will you try this on?

767
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:41,023
I wish I was as confident as you look.
Will you model this for me?

768
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:47,057
Yeah, sure. Why not?

769
00:53:47,668 --> 00:53:51,798
Thank God. I need as many pillars
of strength around me as possible.

770
00:53:52,006 --> 00:53:55,203
Christi Ann, this looks fine.

771
00:53:55,709 --> 00:53:58,803
Hey, come on now.

772
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:02,480
This is all good.
It's exciting!

773
00:54:02,683 --> 00:54:05,243
Look, no matter what
the critical people say...

774
00:54:06,654 --> 00:54:09,179
might as well enjoy
what's going on.

775
00:54:10,257 --> 00:54:12,225
Come here.

776
00:54:32,813 --> 00:54:35,179
- <i>You got brothers and sisters?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

777
00:54:36,984 --> 00:54:39,612
I mean, I got a brother
and I got a sister.

778
00:54:40,221 --> 00:54:44,715
- Older, younger?
- One's older, one's younger.

779
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:46,686
Why do people always ask this?
I don't...

780
00:54:46,894 --> 00:54:48,794
Who cares about
somebody's brothers and sisters?

781
00:54:48,996 --> 00:54:52,932
- Do you talk to your parents a lot?
- No. We got an understanding.

782
00:54:53,367 --> 00:54:55,232
What kind of understanding?

783
00:54:55,803 --> 00:54:59,136
I left when I was 17.
I gave them one of these.

784
00:55:00,975 --> 00:55:03,034
What's that?
What does that mean?

785
00:55:04,378 --> 00:55:07,541
My mom and dad weren't
very bright people.

786
00:55:07,748 --> 00:55:08,737
Which would've been okay
if they were nice...

787
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:11,383
I mean, there's plenty of dumb
but sweet people in the world.

788
00:55:11,585 --> 00:55:15,419
But, I don't know, they were shitty
too. They were just mean people.

789
00:55:17,091 --> 00:55:20,151
- How were they mean?
- They just always said mean things.

790
00:55:20,361 --> 00:55:26,231
You know, told me I was a fucking liar
and a goddamned bullshiter.

791
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:30,270
I go to a therapist. I've been going
for three years actually and...

792
00:55:30,471 --> 00:55:35,602
I've learned that you have to move on,
that you have to forgive them.

793
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:37,674
Right, yeah.

794
00:55:38,646 --> 00:55:42,082
I mean, I forgive them. Like I say,
they weren't bright people.

795
00:55:42,283 --> 00:55:45,252
They had me.
They didn't abort me.

796
00:55:45,452 --> 00:55:49,218
I mean, they raised me, kind of
a fucked up way to do it, but...

797
00:55:49,423 --> 00:55:52,085
maybe them being so harsh
made me the way I am today...

798
00:55:52,293 --> 00:55:54,090
you know, like resilient?

799
00:55:55,963 --> 00:55:57,863
Gotta thank them for that, huh?

800
00:55:58,065 --> 00:56:01,398
Yeah, so whatever.
That's why I gave them one of these.

801
00:56:02,903 --> 00:56:04,894
'Cause what it means is...

802
00:56:05,205 --> 00:56:07,765
you did your best to love me.
I did my best to love you back.

803
00:56:07,975 --> 00:56:12,139
We just reached a point where
there's nothing left to say, so...

804
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,580
...good luck.
- I like how you explain things.

805
00:56:18,352 --> 00:56:20,081
You ever thought about writing?

806
00:56:22,456 --> 00:56:24,390
- Me?
- Seriously.

807
00:56:24,591 --> 00:56:26,616
- Come on!
- Seriously.

808
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:30,392
Seriously. You definitely
have a way with words.

809
00:56:30,998 --> 00:56:34,024
I think you should write stuff
down, you know? Not to...

810
00:56:34,234 --> 00:56:37,362
not to be rich or famous
or anything, but to...

811
00:56:38,672 --> 00:56:40,663
to express yourself.

812
00:56:44,478 --> 00:56:46,605
I'm gonna get you a notebook
and a pen. Just try it.

813
00:56:46,814 --> 00:56:48,577
Just jot stuff down.

814
00:56:49,917 --> 00:56:52,613
Okay, yeah.

815
00:56:59,259 --> 00:57:01,124
Good luck with the show.
We can't wait to see it.

816
00:57:01,328 --> 00:57:03,489
Thank you.
See you on the front row!

817
00:57:03,697 --> 00:57:05,324
Thanks.

818
00:57:07,634 --> 00:57:10,125
"See you on the front row"?
How ass-kissy was that?

819
00:57:10,337 --> 00:57:11,702
Honey, you don't even
need to be kissing her ass.

820
00:57:11,905 --> 00:57:15,068
She's just a manufacturer.
I gotta go.

821
00:57:24,918 --> 00:57:26,510
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

822
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,712
You know, I think you're
making me addicted to sex.

823
00:57:29,923 --> 00:57:31,288
Thanks.

824
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:34,685
And, you know, I've never...

825
00:57:35,796 --> 00:57:39,163
given a blowjob to a guy in a car.

826
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,892
I'm just gonna... I just wanna...

827
00:57:49,743 --> 00:57:53,179
You've gotten really good at that.

828
00:57:56,817 --> 00:57:58,910
When you're through with that can
you please call the silk place back...

829
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,088
and tell them that you're
repped by me? They'll knock off 20/.

830
00:58:15,669 --> 00:58:17,466
Where is everybody?

831
00:58:17,671 --> 00:58:19,502
Joe's helping out Christi Ann
at her store.

832
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:22,903
Good. Did you get
any writing done today?

833
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:26,477
- Yeah, yeah, no, it's really cool.
- So what you writing about?

834
00:58:29,049 --> 00:58:31,711
Never mind.
Just keep getting it down on paper.

835
00:58:31,919 --> 00:58:33,250
Okay.

836
00:58:33,454 --> 00:58:36,184
Had the printer print up like
100 copies of my script today.

837
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:38,119
Getting ready to send it out
to agents.

838
00:58:38,325 --> 00:58:40,156
- Great.
- Tell you what...

839
00:58:40,461 --> 00:58:44,693
when you're ready to take a break,
why don't you come inside?

840
00:58:44,898 --> 00:58:46,991
Okay. I will.

841
01:00:08,715 --> 01:00:13,778
I'm sorry! I know, I'm a bad little slut
and you're the big strong man!

842
01:00:13,987 --> 01:00:16,080
That's right.
I'm not done fucking you.

843
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:18,121
I'm gonna fuck you harder
and you're gonna like it.

844
01:00:18,325 --> 01:00:21,556
Oh, no, no!

845
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:25,857
Don't punish me! Hey!

846
01:00:27,801 --> 01:00:31,897
- Baby, I can't do this anymore.
- Why? What's wrong?

847
01:00:32,105 --> 01:00:36,872
This... this whole routine
of me holding you down and...

848
01:00:37,244 --> 01:00:39,804
your begging me to stop...

849
01:00:40,647 --> 01:00:42,308
it's fucking weird, I don't know.
It's just...

850
01:00:42,516 --> 01:00:46,077
Well, you seemed to enjoy it just fine
every day for the past three weeks.

851
01:00:46,286 --> 01:00:49,915
I know. Look, at first I did.
It's just lately...

852
01:00:51,024 --> 01:00:54,187
It's 'cause I care about you,
and I don't wanna do that...

853
01:00:54,394 --> 01:00:57,795
...to somebody I care about.
- Look, we're just playing. Come on.

854
01:00:57,998 --> 01:00:59,590
I mean, we're just...

855
01:01:00,867 --> 01:01:02,562
Why are we even having
this conversation?

856
01:01:02,769 --> 01:01:04,031
You have a simple job, Stanny.

857
01:01:04,238 --> 01:01:06,706
Are you telling me that you can't
fulfill it? Because, you know what?

858
01:01:06,907 --> 01:01:09,671
There are a lot of guys in this city
that would be more than happy...

859
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:12,037
to do this without complaining.

860
01:01:14,715 --> 01:01:16,546
Are you fucking kidding me?

861
01:01:17,684 --> 01:01:19,914
Is that all that I am to you?

862
01:01:21,421 --> 01:01:25,414
I think you'd better
take the blindfold off now.

863
01:01:37,471 --> 01:01:39,769
I'm such a fucking idiot.

864
01:01:40,007 --> 01:01:42,168
I'm an asshole.

865
01:01:42,909 --> 01:01:45,639
I mean, I was like ready to tell...

866
01:01:45,846 --> 01:01:47,279
What?

867
01:01:51,752 --> 01:01:54,721
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

868
01:02:03,964 --> 01:02:06,728
Okay. Can you untie me, please?

869
01:02:41,802 --> 01:02:43,997
I think you and Joe
need to move out.

870
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:58,642
Joe, get up. We gotta go.

871
01:03:00,787 --> 01:03:02,812
Seriously. I'm not fucking
around, man. Pack your shit.

872
01:03:03,023 --> 01:03:05,355
Stanny, what did you do?

873
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:08,960
I didn't do anything shitty. I stopped
being shitty. Figure that one out.

874
01:03:09,162 --> 01:03:12,029
Come on, we got a pretty good deal
going on here, man.

875
01:03:12,232 --> 01:03:14,962
How long did you think this was
gonna last, you know, seriously?

876
01:03:15,168 --> 01:03:16,726
Okay, it's been a fun month
or two, but...

877
01:03:16,937 --> 01:03:19,804
we milked this for as much
as we could. The milk's gone sour.

878
01:03:38,592 --> 01:03:41,891
What did you?
Joe, what the hell's going on?

879
01:03:42,095 --> 01:03:43,653
- We're leaving.
- Hold on!

880
01:03:43,864 --> 01:03:47,300
- Did you get in a fight with Donna?
- What the fuck you think?

881
01:03:47,501 --> 01:03:50,993
I guess we're gonna go and try
and find our own place.

882
01:03:51,204 --> 01:03:53,570
No, I don't want you to go.
I don't want either one of you to go.

883
01:03:53,774 --> 01:03:54,934
Well, you don't always get
what you want.

884
01:03:55,142 --> 01:03:57,508
- Take care.
- Wait! Wait!

885
01:03:57,711 --> 01:04:00,271
Hold on one minute!

886
01:04:00,947 --> 01:04:02,812
Hold on.

887
01:04:09,389 --> 01:04:13,052
- Donna, what's going on?
- I guess they're leaving.

888
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,352
And you're just gonna sit there?

889
01:04:14,561 --> 01:04:16,756
Yeah,
what am I supposed to be doing?

890
01:04:17,097 --> 01:04:19,497
What happened?

891
01:04:19,699 --> 01:04:21,929
It was just getting too...

892
01:04:22,602 --> 01:04:25,435
...I don't know, too weird.
- Too weird?

893
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:28,665
Why is it that every time you like
a guy things get too weird?

894
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:31,605
- Who says I like the guy?
- You're full of shit.

895
01:04:31,812 --> 01:04:34,144
And I don't have time to sit here
and listen to you lie to yourself...

896
01:04:34,347 --> 01:04:37,282
because they're leaving!
What do you wanna do?

897
01:04:38,385 --> 01:04:41,411
- Well, Joe doesn't have to go.
- Joe goes wherever Stanny goes!

898
01:04:41,621 --> 01:04:45,148
And I'm not about to let him do that
because you got this thing about...

899
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:46,484
What? This thing about what?

900
01:04:46,693 --> 01:04:48,593
I don't know,
but you've got this thing!

901
01:04:49,029 --> 01:04:50,428
And...

902
01:04:52,232 --> 01:04:55,963
if you look at me and tell me
that you don't like the guy...

903
01:04:56,403 --> 01:05:00,464
fine, I'll say goodbye
to both of them.

904
01:05:06,546 --> 01:05:08,980
Tell me what happened.

905
01:05:10,484 --> 01:05:14,386
He said he thought
he was falling in love with me.

906
01:05:15,555 --> 01:05:18,649
Okay. Well...

907
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:23,221
the guy who loves you
is walking out the door right now.

908
01:05:23,563 --> 01:05:26,361
Is that what you want?

909
01:05:30,904 --> 01:05:32,895
Let's get out of here.
This is friggin' humiliating.

910
01:05:33,106 --> 01:05:36,564
She asked us to wait a minute,
so we're gonna wait.

911
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:40,776
- It's been over a minute. Let's go.
- It's an expression, Stanny.

912
01:05:40,981 --> 01:05:43,313
Okay? It's like "hold on a sec".
It's more than a second.

913
01:05:43,517 --> 01:05:45,985
Okay, it's a stupid fucking
expression then.

914
01:05:53,493 --> 01:05:54,983
Just...

915
01:05:55,262 --> 01:05:57,696
don't ask me to say it to you
'cause I can't, Stanny. I'm sorry.

916
01:05:57,898 --> 01:06:04,326
- I just can't say it to you.
- Just... just let me love you.

917
01:06:47,147 --> 01:06:49,707
I was close.

918
01:06:50,383 --> 01:06:52,715
It's alright.

919
01:06:52,919 --> 01:06:57,117
I'm sorry. My mind's just
on the fashion show.

920
01:06:57,824 --> 01:07:00,850
Don't be sorry.

921
01:07:01,394 --> 01:07:05,990
Joe, how come you never
slept in my bed?

922
01:07:08,335 --> 01:07:11,532
You never asked me to.

923
01:07:11,738 --> 01:07:16,107
Well, will you sleep here with me?
I mean...

924
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:22,177
just for the next two nights
until the fashion show.

925
01:07:25,151 --> 01:07:26,846
Well...

926
01:07:27,654 --> 01:07:29,781
sure, girl.

927
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:33,518
Be happy to.

928
01:07:50,977 --> 01:07:54,435
- What about the cuteness?
- What about the dumbness?

929
01:07:54,648 --> 01:07:56,707
- You're dumb.
- No, you're dumb.

930
01:07:56,916 --> 01:08:01,478
- What about the sweetness?
- Guys, do it in private! Jeez!

931
01:08:01,688 --> 01:08:02,677
You guys, really.

932
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:04,754
Why don't you just
give each other hickies?

933
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:06,858
You have rug burns on your elbows.

934
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:09,255
You broke your nails
scratching his back!

935
01:08:09,462 --> 01:08:10,986
I chipped my tooth last week...

936
01:08:11,197 --> 01:08:12,323
'cause we were doing it
doggy style...

937
01:08:12,532 --> 01:08:16,935
and she friggin' jerks her head
back right into my jaw. You did!

938
01:08:17,137 --> 01:08:20,368
My God, Christi Ann!
Remember back in college...

939
01:08:20,573 --> 01:08:23,064
when I was giving a blowjob
to that guy...

940
01:08:23,276 --> 01:08:24,709
that would not take the beret off?

941
01:08:24,911 --> 01:08:27,778
My God. the bathroom is in-between
our two bedrooms...

942
01:08:27,981 --> 01:08:29,539
which is right next to this
little tiny living room.

943
01:08:29,749 --> 01:08:31,546
So I'm ready
to come out and spit...

944
01:08:31,751 --> 01:08:34,914
and there's like ten people
in the goddamned living room.

945
01:08:35,121 --> 01:08:39,057
So I come out and my mouth's like
this 'caused it's all full of his cum.

946
01:08:39,259 --> 01:08:41,819
And I come out and
everybody starts laughing.

947
01:08:42,028 --> 01:08:43,723
And then I start to laugh...

948
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:45,625
and then everyone's jumping back
out of the way...

949
01:08:45,832 --> 01:08:48,767
'cause they're like terrified I'm gonna
spit up right there on the carpet.

950
01:08:48,968 --> 01:08:52,267
So I got running into the bathroom
and I spit out and...

951
01:08:52,572 --> 01:08:54,870
I get a standing ovation.

952
01:08:55,975 --> 01:08:58,671
That's disgusting. Ew!

953
01:09:06,453 --> 01:09:08,478
Honey, you know
what I was just thinking?

954
01:09:08,688 --> 01:09:11,987
- How adorable you are?
- No, I think pretty highly on myself...

955
01:09:12,192 --> 01:09:14,217
but I ain't best described
as adorable.

956
01:09:14,427 --> 01:09:16,292
No, I was thinking about
how we first met and all.

957
01:09:16,496 --> 01:09:17,588
It's funny, I used to be
so choosey.

958
01:09:17,797 --> 01:09:20,823
Like every girl I dates
had to have a perfect ass.

959
01:09:21,034 --> 01:09:22,296
Joe and I used to argue
about it all the time.

960
01:09:22,502 --> 01:09:24,663
If the girl had like
a big square man ass...

961
01:09:24,871 --> 01:09:27,465
forget it. I couldn't do it.
And it's funny when I met you...

962
01:09:27,674 --> 01:09:31,132
I was like, "This chick is hot-looking,
but what does her ass look like?

963
01:09:31,344 --> 01:09:32,834
So we get naked
and we start fucking...

964
01:09:33,046 --> 01:09:35,514
And I'm like,
"Wow, this chick has a big ass!

965
01:09:35,715 --> 01:09:39,242
But I'm diggin' it. It's great."
It's like you converted me.

966
01:09:39,452 --> 01:09:43,388
Now I'm like all the black and Puerto
Rican guys I used to give shit to...

967
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:47,720
'cause they always went for the
big booty. I love big asses now.

968
01:09:47,927 --> 01:09:50,794
It's weird how like your taste
could change like that.

969
01:09:52,632 --> 01:09:54,793
How about how adorable you are?

970
01:09:55,001 --> 01:09:57,060
Don't fuckin' touch me. I cannot
believe you just told me I was fat.

971
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:58,259
I didn't say you were fat!

972
01:09:58,471 --> 01:10:01,463
I said I love you no matter
what your body looks like.

973
01:10:03,443 --> 01:10:06,503
Another sacrifice to the beer gods.

974
01:10:10,817 --> 01:10:13,581
Man, Donna's making me insane.

975
01:10:14,821 --> 01:10:18,814
Yep. Well, you're in love with her.

976
01:10:19,025 --> 01:10:22,756
Yeah. Still, she's got
some mental problems.

977
01:10:23,263 --> 01:10:25,697
Women just have
more emotions than we do.

978
01:10:25,899 --> 01:10:29,198
And they don't think of all the things
they're thinking as mental problems.

979
01:10:29,402 --> 01:10:31,336
That's just their
daily way of thinking.

980
01:10:31,538 --> 01:10:35,736
And he repeats himself. I think
he's borderline schizophrenic.

981
01:10:36,376 --> 01:10:39,641
We argue and I explain to him
how he's being ridiculous.

982
01:10:39,846 --> 01:10:40,835
He admits it.

983
01:10:41,047 --> 01:10:43,515
He apologizes for it and then he does
it again the very next day!

984
01:10:43,716 --> 01:10:44,705
Well, what're you arguing about?

985
01:10:44,918 --> 01:10:46,215
It just depends on what
you're fighting about.

986
01:10:46,419 --> 01:10:49,183
It has nothing to do
with what you were fighting about.

987
01:10:49,389 --> 01:10:51,380
She always gives me this
psycho-friggin'-logical bullshit...

988
01:10:51,591 --> 01:10:53,149
I ain't in touch with my feelings.

989
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:56,121
After about an hour of yelling, I just
say, "Yeah, whatever. You're right".

990
01:10:56,329 --> 01:10:58,854
And then the next day we have the
same argument like a bad rerun!

991
01:10:59,065 --> 01:11:01,761
You're lucky.
Joe seems a lot more sensitive.

992
01:11:01,968 --> 01:11:04,198
- He tries.
- Yeah, he tries.

993
01:11:04,404 --> 01:11:06,929
Bro, just make it look like
you're trying. Don't say nothing.

994
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,769
At most just say, "I wish
I was more aware like you guys.

995
01:11:10,977 --> 01:11:14,879
- But I'm still learning".
- He says that? That is so sweet!

996
01:11:15,682 --> 01:11:18,742
And Stanny can be so great.
I mean, he really can.

997
01:11:18,952 --> 01:11:24,288
And that's why it kills me
to get rejected like that.

998
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:27,084
What does she expect me to say?
I feel like saying to her...

999
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:30,452
"All those years shoveling concrete
I had a lot of shitty days.

1000
01:11:30,663 --> 01:11:33,359
Would've been really nice to just
lay on a couch on a doctor's office...

1001
01:11:33,566 --> 01:11:35,898
and talk about my feelings".
It ain't fair!

1002
01:11:36,102 --> 01:11:38,593
I worked so hard
to get to this point.

1003
01:11:38,805 --> 01:11:40,932
My therapist is so proud
of my progress.

1004
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:43,165
But this whole relationship
is putting me in a tailspin.

1005
01:11:43,376 --> 01:11:45,606
You're not thinking of breaking up
with him, are you?

1006
01:11:45,812 --> 01:11:50,010
No! Well, thinking about it
but no, I mean...

1007
01:11:50,216 --> 01:11:52,741
we've come this far and
we should try and get through this.

1008
01:11:52,952 --> 01:11:54,943
You ever cry in front of her?

1009
01:11:55,255 --> 01:11:56,745
No.

1010
01:11:57,957 --> 01:12:00,323
You don't cry ever, do you?

1011
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,525
No.

1012
01:12:08,067 --> 01:12:10,331
You ever cry in front of Donna?

1013
01:12:12,405 --> 01:12:14,430
Yeah, I suppose. This once.

1014
01:12:15,341 --> 01:12:16,968
And he cries.

1015
01:12:17,176 --> 01:12:19,337
- Really?
- He cries a lot, actually.

1016
01:12:19,545 --> 01:12:21,069
And more and more lately.

1017
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:23,840
Joe doesn't cry
in front of you, huh?

1018
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:26,611
Well, no.

1019
01:12:26,819 --> 01:12:31,256
Just take it in a notch, Stanny.
I know you, man, you don't let shit go.

1020
01:12:31,557 --> 01:12:34,117
- This chick could turn on you.
- No.

1021
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:37,386
You kidding me?
This chick is crazy about me.

1022
01:12:38,164 --> 01:12:39,495
You really love her, don't you?

1023
01:12:41,935 --> 01:12:44,665
Joe, I never loved nothing
like I love that girl.

1024
01:12:44,871 --> 01:12:50,138
Joe is... he'll open up. He's the type
of guy who grows on you.

1025
01:12:50,343 --> 01:12:51,571
He's somebody you
fall in love with slowly.

1026
01:12:51,945 --> 01:12:52,934
Love him like a friend.

1027
01:12:53,146 --> 01:12:54,477
You don't say "I love you"
to each other?

1028
01:12:54,681 --> 01:12:56,706
- No! You don't say that to friends.
- Yes, you do. We do.

1029
01:12:56,916 --> 01:12:59,214
- I mean, you know I love you.
- I love you too!

1030
01:12:59,419 --> 01:13:02,445
- But guys don't say that as friends.
- You're right.

1031
01:13:02,655 --> 01:13:06,216
- Joe, I fucking love you, man.
- I love you too, bro.

1032
01:13:23,776 --> 01:13:25,937
Christi Ann...

1033
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:29,243
you gotta relax.

1034
01:13:30,216 --> 01:13:33,549
I want you to know something, okay?

1035
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:37,150
Sex isn't about...

1036
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:39,885
talking dirty or...

1037
01:13:40,093 --> 01:13:42,926
some silly new position.

1038
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:46,924
It's about trust.

1039
01:13:48,434 --> 01:13:50,766
Do you trust me?

1040
01:13:55,008 --> 01:13:56,737
It's tender...

1041
01:13:58,111 --> 01:13:59,772
soft.

1042
01:14:01,014 --> 01:14:03,778
I'm gonna kiss you delicately.

1043
01:14:04,217 --> 01:14:08,381
If it makes sense, give it back.

1044
01:15:32,638 --> 01:15:35,937
This is going to be a great show.

1045
01:15:41,047 --> 01:15:42,878
Yeah, it is.

1046
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:45,238
- You're amazing. Okay.
- Thank you.

1047
01:16:46,312 --> 01:16:48,007
This is insane!

1048
01:16:54,053 --> 01:16:55,145
I think you're gonna get backers.

1049
01:16:55,354 --> 01:16:57,879
I've gotten so many cards
I can't even keep track!

1050
01:16:58,090 --> 01:16:59,557
That's awesome.

1051
01:17:00,526 --> 01:17:03,461
- Do you know that guy over there?
- Mark.

1052
01:17:03,829 --> 01:17:07,424
He's like, "Come to Europe.
You know...

1053
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:10,100
the fashion season's
just starting".

1054
01:17:10,303 --> 01:17:14,239
Like, he told me I could be making
a couple grand a day just doing this.

1055
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:17,703
- Is he like for real or what?
- Well, he owns a modeling agency.

1056
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:20,674
- He's for real.
- It was nice for him to say it and all...

1057
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,745
but I don't know if he meant it,
you know?

1058
01:17:22,949 --> 01:17:27,283
Christi Ann. I want you to meet Arthur.
He's an editor from Vogue Magazine.

1059
01:17:27,486 --> 01:17:30,819
Love your show, very elegant.

1060
01:17:48,941 --> 01:17:50,408
Nikki, you don't care about fashion.

1061
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:51,907
You're just here for the
party afterwards.

1062
01:17:52,111 --> 01:17:53,578
How can you blame me?
You always seem to have...

1063
01:17:53,779 --> 01:17:55,804
the most entertaining guests.

1064
01:17:56,015 --> 01:17:57,414
I'm sure he's already
told you ladies...

1065
01:17:57,617 --> 01:17:59,915
but Nikki sold his first
screenplay last year.

1066
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:01,882
And now he's in production
on his next film.

1067
01:18:02,088 --> 01:18:03,112
Congratulations.

1068
01:18:03,322 --> 01:18:04,311
Of course when I sell
one of my scripts...

1069
01:18:04,523 --> 01:18:07,856
I'm gonna have to surround myself
with a bevy of beautiful men...

1070
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:11,291
which I'll have to secretly blow
because I have a boyfriend.

1071
01:18:11,731 --> 01:18:12,925
You know...

1072
01:18:13,132 --> 01:18:16,624
you always have to talk about cock
and fucking and it's really disgusting.

1073
01:18:18,304 --> 01:18:20,067
Excuse us.

1074
01:18:23,643 --> 01:18:27,443
I am trying to host a party here
so back the fuck off.

1075
01:18:27,647 --> 01:18:29,410
Okay, can you not
embarrass me, please?

1076
01:18:29,615 --> 01:18:30,741
Can not talk like that
in front of me?

1077
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:32,577
Stop smoking that thing in my face.

1078
01:18:32,785 --> 01:18:35,515
I smoke wherever I want.
How do you like that?

1079
01:18:35,721 --> 01:18:37,951
You're drunk.
You're such an ass.

1080
01:18:52,805 --> 01:18:56,366
- Stanny, you won't believe this shit.
- I've figured it out. Relationships...

1081
01:18:56,575 --> 01:18:59,703
it's all about control. If you're
in control you don't get hurt.

1082
01:18:59,912 --> 01:19:00,901
'Cause everyone's afraid
of getting hurt.

1083
01:19:01,113 --> 01:19:02,808
I gotta tell you what this guy
was saying to me.

1084
01:19:03,015 --> 01:19:04,676
You know what?
These girls, they just own us.

1085
01:19:04,884 --> 01:19:06,249
It was never about sex.
It was about...

1086
01:19:06,452 --> 01:19:08,886
being able to give us shit
and we couldn't give shit back.

1087
01:19:09,088 --> 01:19:11,955
I know Donna can be shitty
at times but Christi Ann...

1088
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:13,284
Yeah, yeah, she's more subtle at it.

1089
01:19:13,492 --> 01:19:16,620
You don't even realize you got
a leash around your neck.

1090
01:19:19,231 --> 01:19:21,631
You know what?
You ain't always right, Stanny.

1091
01:19:22,168 --> 01:19:25,695
You ain't always right about shit
and you're wrong about that girl.

1092
01:19:25,905 --> 01:19:28,897
Yeah, right. You're falling all over
these phony who wants to be...

1093
01:19:29,108 --> 01:19:32,339
...a high-class designer.
- Why do always do this?

1094
01:19:32,545 --> 01:19:34,775
Why is that every time
I like a girl...

1095
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:37,278
you say she's no good
'cause of something?

1096
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:41,417
You say it like she's trying
to split you and me up or something.

1097
01:19:41,821 --> 01:19:43,288
You know what?

1098
01:19:43,489 --> 01:19:46,185
- I think it's the other way around.
- You really think...

1099
01:19:46,492 --> 01:19:49,188
that that girl
considers you her equal?

1100
01:19:49,695 --> 01:19:51,720
Brother, that girl considers
herself above you.

1101
01:19:55,768 --> 01:19:58,931
I'm just saving you
from a painful fall!

1102
01:19:59,405 --> 01:20:03,136
My girlfriend's got me buying
every goddamned thing here.

1103
01:20:03,342 --> 01:20:05,037
That's wonderful! Or maybe not.

1104
01:20:05,244 --> 01:20:06,836
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for her.

1105
01:20:07,046 --> 01:20:09,207
I'm blowing cash
on that dress, this skirt...

1106
01:20:09,415 --> 01:20:10,541
Don't even listen to him.

1107
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:13,082
- He can afford it. He's a lawyer.
- Lawyer my ass.

1108
01:20:13,285 --> 01:20:17,312
She's got one hand in my pants,
one hand in my goddamned wallet.

1109
01:20:17,523 --> 01:20:20,185
- Your illustrious model.
- He's not really a model.

1110
01:20:20,393 --> 01:20:23,419
He's actually my personal cabana boy.

1111
01:20:24,897 --> 01:20:26,728
Come with me right now.

1112
01:20:32,371 --> 01:20:35,807
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Great. Okay, talk to you later.

1113
01:20:36,776 --> 01:20:38,175
Don't be showing up
at my girlfriend's house.

1114
01:20:38,377 --> 01:20:39,844
You guys are boyfriend
and girlfriend now?

1115
01:20:40,045 --> 01:20:41,034
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

1116
01:20:41,247 --> 01:20:43,875
So maybe you don't need
to be stopping by here anymore.

1117
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:45,710
Christi Ann invited me.

1118
01:20:45,918 --> 01:20:48,250
You wanna push it?
We'll settle this old school.

1119
01:20:48,454 --> 01:20:50,115
What? We're gonna break dance?

1120
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,486
Look, shit. I forgot
to tell you about him.

1121
01:20:53,692 --> 01:20:55,455
Tell him about me what?
I'm standing right fucking here.

1122
01:20:55,661 --> 01:20:57,185
Don't talk about me like
I'm a piece of friggin' wood.

1123
01:20:57,396 --> 01:20:58,385
Easy, fella, you don't gotta...

1124
01:20:58,597 --> 01:21:00,394
"Easy, fella"? Do I look like a fucking
horse to you?

1125
01:21:00,599 --> 01:21:02,999
Do I have fucking hooves?
Don't fucking say "easy fella" to me!

1126
01:21:03,202 --> 01:21:04,931
Did you say the word "fuck"
enough in that sentence?

1127
01:21:05,137 --> 01:21:07,662
No, let me add a few more.
Fuck you. And fuck you too!

1128
01:21:07,873 --> 01:21:09,397
Let's just all cool out.

1129
01:21:09,842 --> 01:21:11,309
- Stanny!
- Wanna try to grab me again, fucker?

1130
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:13,603
- Easy, fella, just...
- Quit saying "easy fella" to me!

1131
01:21:13,813 --> 01:21:15,280
- Just chill the fuck out!
- Stanny!

1132
01:21:15,648 --> 01:21:18,674
- Don't you lay a hand on me!
- I'm not gonna lay a hand on you.

1133
01:21:18,884 --> 01:21:19,873
Didn't even lay a hand on him.

1134
01:21:20,085 --> 01:21:21,143
I knocked him on his ass
with my elbow.

1135
01:21:21,353 --> 01:21:24,618
Stanny, get in the goddamned house.
And, Damien, you can go!

1136
01:21:26,525 --> 01:21:28,652
- I hope you're proud of yourself.
- I hope you're proud of yourself...

1137
01:21:28,861 --> 01:21:31,591
using that stupid fuck
to get a reaction out of me.

1138
01:21:31,797 --> 01:21:35,028
Yeah, go ahead, keep fooling yourself.
At least you're fooling somebody.

1139
01:21:40,906 --> 01:21:46,503
- Joe, I'm gonna cum...
- You motherfuckin' shit!

1140
01:21:56,121 --> 01:21:58,248
Thank you, Joe.

1141
01:21:58,457 --> 01:22:02,325
Was that good?
Was that good, Joe?

1142
01:22:04,296 --> 01:22:07,390
Do you want me to get you a towel?

1143
01:22:42,234 --> 01:22:45,533
Just fucking listen to me, alright?
You realize what you do to me?

1144
01:22:45,738 --> 01:22:50,072
You insist that I throw you down
and treat you like a cheap whore...

1145
01:22:50,276 --> 01:22:51,334
'cause it's the only way
you can get off.

1146
01:22:51,544 --> 01:22:54,274
Then in daily life if I show
any form of aggression...

1147
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,916
or jealousy, you freak the fuck out.
Do you know how confusing it is...

1148
01:22:58,117 --> 01:23:00,483
...to be in a relationship with you?
- What we do in the bedroom...

1149
01:23:00,686 --> 01:23:03,154
and what we do in our relationship
out in the real world...

1150
01:23:03,355 --> 01:23:04,879
those are two goddamned
different things, Stanny.

1151
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:08,787
So just as long as we do everything
the way you want on your terms...

1152
01:23:08,994 --> 01:23:10,393
then we'll be fine.

1153
01:23:10,596 --> 01:23:12,826
Why do you have to be
so combative with me?

1154
01:23:13,032 --> 01:23:16,900
I'm not the combative one, okay?
This is what you do. It's not funny.

1155
01:23:17,102 --> 01:23:19,627
You pick fights with me and then
you yell at me for fighting!

1156
01:23:19,838 --> 01:23:22,534
I'm not the one who's fucking
yelling here, okay, buddy?

1157
01:23:22,741 --> 01:23:24,140
You instigate me to do shit.

1158
01:23:24,343 --> 01:23:27,039
Then when I do you get to point out
how fucked up I am.

1159
01:23:27,246 --> 01:23:30,909
'Cause you're so pathetically afraid
I might realize how fucked up you are.

1160
01:23:31,116 --> 01:23:33,778
Oh, I'm the fucked up one?
I'm the fucked up one?

1161
01:23:33,986 --> 01:23:37,786
Honey, I gotta fucking hold you down
and call you a whore for you to cum...

1162
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:39,685
and you say I got self-esteem issues?

1163
01:23:39,892 --> 01:23:42,019
You know what?
Fuck this and fuck you...

1164
01:23:42,227 --> 01:23:45,594
because I am not gonna do this
with you, fucking asshole!

1165
01:23:45,798 --> 01:23:49,290
- I am through!
- Be a fucking rich bitch crybaby.

1166
01:23:49,501 --> 01:23:53,062
It doesn't affect me anymore 'cause
I'm done back-peddling just so...

1167
01:23:53,272 --> 01:23:56,673
I don't notice what a goddamned
psycho you are. You're a head case.

1168
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:59,435
I am not the fucked up one.
I am not the psycho, okay?

1169
01:23:59,645 --> 01:24:03,775
I'm not the one that's hit people.
You should be in goddamned therapy!

1170
01:24:03,983 --> 01:24:05,974
You're the one who's fucked up,
just like your goddamned parents.

1171
01:24:06,185 --> 01:24:08,415
- You're just like them!
- Well, I don't have the luxury...

1172
01:24:08,621 --> 01:24:13,524
of your rich parents to pay for
your goddamned therapist, alright?

1173
01:24:13,726 --> 01:24:16,388
And you know what? All that
money you waste on that bullshit...

1174
01:24:16,595 --> 01:24:20,725
I'll solve your problem right now
in three words: eat less food!

1175
01:24:29,842 --> 01:24:34,370
You're a fucking asshole,
you know what?

1176
01:24:35,614 --> 01:24:37,844
You're a fucking asshole.

1177
01:24:38,317 --> 01:24:41,844
And I loved you. I did.
I loved you.

1178
01:24:42,187 --> 01:24:46,283
I don't know why. I don't know
why I did! I was stupid!

1179
01:24:46,492 --> 01:24:51,122
I was really dumb! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry I did this to us!

1180
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:55,130
I did it and I'm sorry!
You gotta go!

1181
01:25:24,063 --> 01:25:26,896
- Here we go again.
- No, it's for real this time, bro.

1182
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:31,199
- What happened?
- I stopped thinking with my dick.

1183
01:25:31,804 --> 01:25:34,238
No, I take that back.
I stopped thinking with my wallet.

1184
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,965
You think if I had a job I'd be putting
up with that bullshit?

1185
01:25:37,176 --> 01:25:38,643
I just wanted to sleep late.

1186
01:25:38,844 --> 01:25:41,506
I've been working hard my whole life
and I wanted a break.

1187
01:25:41,714 --> 01:25:44,979
We got a break.
Now what?

1188
01:25:45,317 --> 01:25:49,413
Now what? I'll get myself
a job tending bar at night...

1189
01:25:49,722 --> 01:25:51,713
write during the day...

1190
01:25:52,057 --> 01:25:54,184
I'm gonna be a starving artist.

1191
01:25:54,393 --> 01:25:57,294
Look, you don't gotta come
with me, alright? Stay here.

1192
01:25:57,496 --> 01:25:59,191
This works for you.
Doesn't work for me.

1193
01:25:59,398 --> 01:26:01,093
Stanny, just calm down.

1194
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:04,531
Just sleep over it. Maybe you'll feel
different about it in the morning.

1195
01:26:04,737 --> 01:26:06,830
I ain't gonna feel any different
about it tomorrow, Joe.

1196
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:09,507
Where the fuck are you
gonna go at three a. m?

1197
01:26:21,854 --> 01:26:24,152
Bro, just go back to the party.

1198
01:26:24,823 --> 01:26:27,417
Go have fun, alright?

1199
01:26:27,626 --> 01:26:30,288
Don't worry about me.

1200
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:37,891
Just try and get
some sleep, alright?

1201
01:27:22,981 --> 01:27:24,471
So...

1202
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:28,951
I think I'm gonna take
that guy up on that offer.

1203
01:27:29,154 --> 01:27:30,644
What guy?

1204
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:33,290
That agent guy. He...

1205
01:27:33,992 --> 01:27:36,187
said he'd get me a plane ticket
and that his...

1206
01:27:36,395 --> 01:27:38,420
agency has some sort
of a deal with a...

1207
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:43,226
hotel in... Milan.
It's in Europe.

1208
01:27:48,473 --> 01:27:50,566
I leave tomorrow.

1209
01:27:52,144 --> 01:27:57,241
- The fashion season starts soon so...
- I know when the season starts.

1210
01:28:00,085 --> 01:28:04,021
It's kinda cool though, right?
I mean, never been to Europe.

1211
01:28:04,690 --> 01:28:07,420
Shit, I've never been anywhere.

1212
01:28:11,463 --> 01:28:14,296
How am I ever gonna
repay you for this?

1213
01:28:19,671 --> 01:28:22,697
I think it's a great opportunity.

1214
01:28:28,146 --> 01:28:30,171
- Christi Ann.
- Hi!

1215
01:28:30,382 --> 01:28:33,044
- Hi. These are my friends. Justin.
- Justin.

1216
01:28:33,252 --> 01:28:35,550
- And this is Carlos.
- Hi. How you doing?

1217
01:28:35,754 --> 01:28:37,881
- Thanks for the invitation...
- Yeah.

1218
01:28:38,457 --> 01:28:43,292
...for your party.
- It was fantastic. The show...

1219
01:29:26,371 --> 01:29:31,536
- So you'll be back in four months?
- Yeah, when the season ends.

1220
01:29:33,078 --> 01:29:35,569
Well, good luck.

1221
01:29:37,349 --> 01:29:40,147
You too.

1222
01:29:55,934 --> 01:29:59,426
Well, at least your show
was a big hit.

1223
01:30:07,813 --> 01:30:09,940
And to think I didn't want to go
to California with you.

1224
01:30:10,148 --> 01:30:14,278
- Wherever we go, we go together.
- Yeah.

1225
01:30:14,486 --> 01:30:17,546
This is gonna be a tough act
to follow, though.

1226
01:30:18,457 --> 01:30:21,915
But I bet there's all kinds of
different countries and shit in Europe.

1227
01:30:23,829 --> 01:30:26,024
Man, my best friend's gonna be
a friggin' supermodel.

1228
01:30:26,231 --> 01:30:28,529
We're gonna be balls deep
in ass over there.

1229
01:30:30,902 --> 01:30:32,267
Wow...

1230
01:30:32,938 --> 01:30:36,601
...what a summer.
- Tell me about it.

1231
01:30:39,077 --> 01:30:41,170
Goddamn it, I smoke too much pot.

1232
01:30:43,348 --> 01:30:47,478
I'm sorry that it didn't work out
with Stanny.

1233
01:30:48,353 --> 01:30:51,345
Yeah. I'm sorry too.

1234
01:30:53,525 --> 01:30:56,187
Guess it's just
you and me again, kiddo.

1235
01:31:01,299 --> 01:31:03,130
They sure were funny.

1236
01:31:06,972 --> 01:31:09,065
Yeah.

1237
01:31:09,741 --> 01:31:12,141
You said we'd look back
on this and laugh.

1238
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:19,915
We're crazy, aren't we?

1239
01:31:20,819 --> 01:31:25,620
Yeah.
But we're damned great at it.

1240
01:31:37,602 --> 01:31:39,593
My God!

1241
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:49,947
- You're gonna miss her, ain't you?
- You're gonna miss Christi Ann?

1242
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:53,350
Joe...

1243
01:31:54,553 --> 01:31:56,817
look, I'm starting
to like this LA thing...

1244
01:31:57,022 --> 01:31:59,490
like writing movies and...

1245
01:32:00,959 --> 01:32:03,120
I don't know if I'd like Europe
all that much.

1246
01:32:04,362 --> 01:32:09,493
- Bro, you gotta come with me.
- No. This writing thing, I gotta do it.

1247
01:32:09,701 --> 01:32:12,033
Well, I don't wanna go
over there all by myself.

1248
01:32:12,537 --> 01:32:16,234
I don't think you really want
to go there in the first place.

1249
01:32:16,608 --> 01:32:19,805
Look, I gotta leave that house,
but you don't.

1250
01:32:21,446 --> 01:32:25,940
And what I said about you and
Christi Ann last night, I was wrong.

1251
01:32:26,718 --> 01:32:31,712
I mean, thank God girls bitch at us:
make you dress better, motivate you.

1252
01:32:33,558 --> 01:32:38,359
I ain't the expert on relationships
obviously, but I know this:

1253
01:32:39,197 --> 01:32:40,926
you don't wanna leave your girl.

1254
01:32:44,636 --> 01:32:48,868
- Did you love Donna?
- Despite how much I hated her...

1255
01:32:49,407 --> 01:32:51,136
I always will.

1256
01:32:55,347 --> 01:32:56,974
You think I'm in love?

1257
01:32:59,451 --> 01:33:01,919
Do you think you are?

1258
01:33:25,911 --> 01:33:29,813
Me and you ain't breaking up.
Go on, get out of here.

1259
01:34:15,894 --> 01:34:19,762
You wouldn't kick me out or nothing
if I told you I loved you, would you?

1260
01:34:20,999 --> 01:34:22,728
I love you too.

1261
01:35:22,594 --> 01:35:26,052
<i>So it's kind of a happy ending,</i>
<i>for Joe and Christi Ann anyways.</i>

1262
01:35:26,564 --> 01:35:27,997
<i>Don't worry about me and Donna.</i>

1263
01:35:28,199 --> 01:35:30,258
<i>You know real life,</i>
<i>it ain't like the movies.</i>

1264
01:35:30,468 --> 01:35:31,867
<i>Life is just a bunch of stories</i>
<i>you go through...</i>

1265
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:33,594
<i>and they all end sooner or later.</i>

1266
01:35:34,439 --> 01:35:37,875
<i>But it's okay. I'm gonna go</i>
<i>find my next story.</i>

1267
01:35:38,877 --> 01:35:40,105
<i>Hope you do the same.</i>
