1
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:50,663
- The Lord is my shepherd;

2
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:52,565
I shall not want.

3
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:55,702
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures;

4
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:58,471
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

5
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:00,406
He restoreth my soul;

6
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:02,775
He leadeth me on the paths
of righteousness

7
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:04,711
for His namesake.

8
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:06,412
Though I walk through
the valley

9
00:01:06,412 --> 00:01:09,649
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil;

10
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:11,818
for thou art with me;

11
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:14,821
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

12
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:17,090
Thou preparest
a table before me

13
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,958
in the presence of my enemies.

14
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:22,028
- We are live
at the Texas State Cemetery

15
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:24,731
for the memorial service
of Blake Redding,

16
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:26,866
son of Texas Governor
Dean Redding,

17
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:29,135
who lost his life
when he failed

18
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:30,903
his thinning exam last week

19
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:32,872
at Vista Point High School.

20
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:35,541
Reports have since indicated

21
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,076
that Blake Redding
was not among

22
00:01:37,076 --> 00:01:39,045
the initial students
to fail the exam,

23
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:40,780
which has shrouded
the Governor's campaign

24
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,549
for president in
a flurry of controversy.

25
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:44,951
- Thank you.

26
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:47,053
- Governor, your thoughts
on the Vista Point scandal?

27
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,488
- Not today.

28
00:01:48,488 --> 00:01:49,922
- Attending the service

29
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:52,392
is former
Vista Point High School student

30
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:53,659
Laina Michaels,

31
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,595
who has become a public figure

32
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:58,865
since she was wrongfully accused
of failing her exam

33
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:02,535
and framed for committing
acts of domestic terrorism.

34
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:04,170
- Laina, do you have any plans

35
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,506
for taking legal action
against the Board of Education

36
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:09,175
for mishandling
your test scores?

37
00:02:10,743 --> 00:02:12,512
- I don't know.

38
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:14,747
- Do you hold Governor Redding
personally responsible

39
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:17,116
for implicating you
as a domestic terrorist?

40
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:20,019
- No comment.
all: Miss Michaels!

41
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:21,754
- I hate to be all business,

42
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:24,690
but the DPC has appointed
a special investigator

43
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,025
for the Vista Point incident.

44
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:27,927
- It's Agent Joanne Morris.

45
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:29,595
<i> They didn't waste any time.</i>

46
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:30,963
- Fortunately for you,
Mason King

47
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:32,465
has signed an affidavit
absolving you

48
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:34,667
of any connection to the events.

49
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:36,636
<i> Per your request,
 he's been reassigned.</i>

50
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:38,070
<i> - Good.
 Where is he?</i>

51
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,505
- I'll handle this myself.

52
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:40,907
You just focus
on what's important:

53
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:42,975
getting elected.

54
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:50,983
<i> - How close would you say
 you were to Blake Redding?</i>

55
00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:54,954
- I barely knew him.

56
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:57,590
Talked to him a few times
over the years

57
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,791
but that was it.

58
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,627
- Was he your boyfriend?

59
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:03,663
You guys have
a personal relationship?

60
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:06,232
- He was with Ellie
until last year.

61
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:09,535
Then he kept to himself.

62
00:03:09,535 --> 00:03:11,604
I barely knew him.

63
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:12,805
- Barely knew him.

64
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,211
You don't have to tell me about
some boy you had feelings for,

65
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:20,513
but we need to be honest
with each other.

66
00:03:20,513 --> 00:03:22,782
Let's go over the timeline.

67
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:24,250
An hour before the kiss,

68
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,152
I have you on
the internal server computer.

69
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:27,653
I need to know what you saw.

70
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:29,555
- I was working fast.

71
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:32,658
Everything I saw
was posted on the news.

72
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:35,895
I knew they switched my test,
I was just trying to prove it.

73
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:39,499
- Anything regarding the school
or sensitive material?

74
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,868
- I really wish
I could help you.

75
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:47,874
- Here's my card.

76
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:49,775
If you remember anything

77
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:52,011
or need someone you can trust,

78
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:54,247
I just want you to know
you're not alone.

79
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:59,819
- What's so funny?
- Joey's on TV.

80
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,489
- No, guys, cut it out.

81
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:06,526
- That's my cue.

82
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:09,095
Take care of yourself, Laina.

83
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:14,901
- Guys.

84
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:18,871
I need you two to focus.
both: Okay.

85
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,275
- No interviews.

86
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,010
- Miss Michaels,

87
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,879
it's Jack Prescott
with Governor Redding's team.

88
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,180
- What does he want?

89
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,982
- He needs to see you.

90
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:32,184
It's about Blake.

91
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:38,124
- Hi.

92
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:40,793
- Hi.

93
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:43,229
- You said something
about Blake?

94
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:46,899
- I can't believe
I'm walking these floors.

95
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:48,067
Two years ago, I put a picture

96
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,602
of this place
on my vision board.

97
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:50,803
Now I'm here.

98
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:52,171
- Loving the new look, Wendy.

99
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:53,806
Auburn?
- Rosewood.

100
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:55,207
This is the bullpen.

101
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:57,109
A lot of the junior staffers
get thrown here,

102
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:58,811
but since I took a chance
getting the station

103
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:00,813
to hire the first
non-intern under 20,

104
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:02,048
you get your own office.

105
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:04,317
Now we're talking.

106
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:06,752
- This room used to be a closet.
Now it's yours.

107
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:08,888
- In real estate terms,
they call this

108
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:10,990
"cozy with potential."

109
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,594
- There are still a lot
of questions that need answers

110
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:16,162
about what happened
at Vista Point High.

111
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:17,196
- I get it.

112
00:05:17,196 --> 00:05:19,165
You want me to dig deep
and uncover what's really

113
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:20,833
going on at
Vista Point High, right?

114
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,135
Question authorities,
make it clear that BNC News

115
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:25,271
is gonna ask hard questions
and accept the blowback

116
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,106
regardless of the consequences.

117
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:28,274
- No.

118
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:30,076
Kellan, this is your first day.

119
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:32,979
You're starting at the bottom.
That's how this works.

120
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,880
First up, a science piece.

121
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,782
Parents want to know what
chemicals are being administered

122
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:38,150
to the students who
go to the thinning.

123
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,119
I'm gonna send you out
to do a prelim.

124
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,320
- Uh, two things.

125
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,022
Number one, what's a prelim?

126
00:05:43,022 --> 00:05:44,957
Number two,
when are you grabbing dinner?

127
00:05:44,957 --> 00:05:46,826
- Talk to people.
Find an angle.

128
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:47,994
Set up interviews, chase leads.

129
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:50,129
You do that, we'll get dinner.

130
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:52,098
- It's a date.
- I'm married.

131
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:54,000
Get to work.

132
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,840
- Miss Michaels.

133
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,943
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

134
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:07,680
- You went on TV
and said I was a terrorist.

135
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,816
- Right to the chase.
I love it.

136
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,058
I was given misleading
information from my people.

137
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:21,327
I want to apologize.

138
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:25,765
- You didn't call me in here
to apologize.

139
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,700
- I wanted to offer you
an advisory role

140
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,337
on our new
Thinning Oversight Committee.

141
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:33,105
- No thanks.

142
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:35,975
- The thinning isn't perfect,
but it's the law.

143
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:37,410
And with this recent incident,

144
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,412
there's been strong
headwinds against it.

145
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:42,415
People want to see
the other side of the story.

146
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:45,384
- You want me
to stump for you.

147
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:46,886
- It'd be a very
generous paycheck

148
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,754
for you and your siblings,

149
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:52,391
take care of you
for quite some time.

150
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,393
- Thanks for the water.

151
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:59,865
Hi, guys.
Let's go.

152
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:07,373
- Laina.
Georgina Preston.

153
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:11,143
Oh, this must be your family.

154
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:14,780
I hear you will be taking
your first test this year.

155
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,484
How exciting.

156
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:21,220
Corrine has 11 more years
of testing.

157
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,091
I'd imagine it would be nice
to have a little...

158
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:26,192
support.

159
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:32,331
Jack will take you home.

160
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:52,752
- Excuse me?
You just passed our house.

161
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,355
- Laina?

162
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:00,760
- Help!

163
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:22,381
Who are you?
Where are Corrine and Joey?

164
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:24,016
- They're safe.

165
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:26,252
Everything is okay.

166
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:27,987
See?

167
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,494
- Miss Cole?

168
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:38,097
all: Morning, Miss Cole.

169
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:39,799
- Maggie.

170
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,033
I'm sorry for the scare.

171
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:44,036
This is kind of
a sensitive operation.

172
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:45,938
- Tell the Governor
I'm not working for him.

173
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:48,808
- We're not with the Governor.

174
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:50,142
We're with The Fight.

175
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:51,544
<i> - We're hiding in plain sight</i>

176
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,145
<i> at all levels of government</i>

177
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:55,848
to garner influence
to end the thinning,

178
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:58,050
and transport at-risk students
to safe houses.

179
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,852
- You can get people out?

180
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:01,287
- That's what we do.

181
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:03,222
Mister Leonard over there
has personally escorted

182
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:06,258
over 100 students
across the border

183
00:09:06,258 --> 00:09:08,260
to a secure island
off the Gulf.

184
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,095
- Corrine and Joey--
you have to get them out.

185
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:12,198
- That's why we need you
to help the Governor.

186
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:13,966
- No.

187
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:17,102
I'm not going to be
a mouthpiece for the thinning.

188
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:18,270
If you won't help me
get them out,

189
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,139
then I'm going to do it myself.

190
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:22,141
- You know what happens
when they catch a runaway?

191
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,509
The kids get split up.

192
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,144
<i> They bounce around
 in state homes.</i>

193
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:26,512
<i> They get
 a third-rate education</i>

194
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:28,480
and a guaranteed trip
to the thinning.

195
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,249
You don't want that.

196
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:32,251
- With the right candidate
in place,

197
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,353
we can do a full repeal
of the thinning,

198
00:09:34,353 --> 00:09:37,957
and find a more humane way
to combat our population crisis.

199
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:39,959
- But if Redding
becomes president,

200
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,493
the thinning will stay strong

201
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:45,064
and continue to send
innocent kids to die.

202
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:47,199
And that could just be
the tip of the iceberg.

203
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,003
- What does Georgina have
to do with all this?

204
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:52,271
- We don't know.

205
00:09:52,271 --> 00:09:53,472
That's what
we need you to find out.

206
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:55,207
If she has her way,

207
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:57,409
when Governor Redding
becomes President Redding,

208
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:00,145
we lose our window
to stop the thinning.

209
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:03,082
I mean, who knows
what the future could hold.

210
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:10,489
- So, uh, you worked the day
Blake's body was being prepared?

211
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:12,091
- Yes, I was on-site.

212
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,926
- And did you handle the body?

213
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:16,262
- Not personally, no.

214
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,501
- Kellan,
it's 3:00 in the morning.

215
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:25,104
- I know.
Um, weird question.

216
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:27,239
Do you own a shovel?

217
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:30,376
And out of all nine employees
who worked that 72-hour period,

218
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:33,512
not one person ever
saw or handled the body.

219
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:35,247
- That's crazy.

220
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:37,549
- No.
We're crazy.

221
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:41,954
Okay--oh.

222
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:43,289
Hey.

223
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:45,557
Are you good?
- Yeah.

224
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:47,360
- Be careful.

225
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:50,296
Wait.

226
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:52,031
No.

227
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:58,537
Yeah.

228
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:01,374
Are we doing this?

229
00:11:05,077 --> 00:11:07,179
- Here.

230
00:11:11,383 --> 00:11:12,618
I can't believe
you're doing all this for a guy

231
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:14,987
that doesn't even
know your name.

232
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:17,289
- Light.
- Yeah, sorry.

233
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,570
- Congratulations.

234
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,306
Your class has been spared.

235
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:10,609
<i> Every single one of you
 was chosen by our system</i>

236
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:12,678
<i> and deemed worthy to receive</i>

237
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:15,214
<i> a second chance at life.</i>

238
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:18,150
<i> I realize you may have
 a couple of questions.</i>

239
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,486
<i> Okay, let's begin.</i>

240
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:24,089
<i> Our first, most commonly-asked
 question is:</i>

241
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:26,291
<i> "Am I dead?"</i>

242
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,394
<i> No.
 You're not dead.</i>

243
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:30,496
<i> Question two:</i>

244
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:32,197
<i> "Where am I?"</i>

245
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:35,734
Well, you're in The Incubator,

246
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:38,303
a special facility
designed and sponsored

247
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:41,573
by the great minds
at Assuru Global.

248
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:43,275
<i> We are here
 to help you grow</i>

249
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:45,711
from a parasitic leech
on our society

250
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:49,081
to a productive member
of the working class.

251
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:52,484
<i> I know what you're thinking:
 "Why me?"</i>

252
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:54,820
<i> Using our patented algorithm,</i>

253
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,156
<i> we analyzed the test scores
 of this year's</i>

254
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:59,058
<i> failing students
 and determined that</i>

255
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:01,126
<i> you still have
 value and special skills</i>

256
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:03,395
<i> that can be utilized
 to better America.</i>

257
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:06,131
Sorry, that was a lot of words.

258
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:08,700
To put it simply:
you were chosen, silly.

259
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:11,837
<i> Last question:</i>

260
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:14,673
"Do I get to go back?"

261
00:13:14,673 --> 00:13:17,543
The most productive members
of the Incubator program

262
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:20,612
will be considered
for reintroduction to society.

263
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:23,582
<i> Again, congratulations
 on being selected</i>

264
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:26,151
<i> and getting to begin
 your new life.</i>

265
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:28,087
<i> Be worthy.</i>

266
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:39,198
- We made it!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

267
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,201
<i> - Please proceed
 to the assignment room.</i>

268
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,711
<i> - Heather Forester, you have</i>

00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:54,546
<i> been assigned to "Assembly."</i>

00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:57,483
<i> Please proceed to

271
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:59,585
<i> Today you will be

00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:04,356
<i> Ned Walker.</i>

273
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:07,359
<i> You have been assigned

<i> Blake Redding.</i>

00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:20,405
<i> You have been assigned

276
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:22,207
- What happens if I say no?

<i> As a member
 of the Incubator,</i>

280
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,360
<i> your day breaks down
 into three sections:</i>

281
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,562
<i> work, eat, and sleep.</i>

282
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:47,900
<i> During work hours,
 each member will report to</i>

283
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,434
<i> their assigned section</i>

284
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:52,204
<i> for 14 hours of labor.</i>

285
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:54,540
<i> Then, each member
 will be released</i>

286
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,643
<i> to have one hour of
 dining and personal time.</i>

287
00:14:57,643 --> 00:15:00,245
<i> At curfew,
 each member must return</i>

288
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:03,348
<i> to their domiciles
 for rest and recuperation.</i>

289
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:12,491
<i> Please proceed to the

290
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:16,328

291
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:24,536
<i> - All workers please return</i>

292
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:26,572
<i> to living and dining quarters.</i>

293
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:28,407
<i> All workers please return</i>

294
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,676

295
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:33,812
<i> All workers please return

296
00:15:33,812 --> 00:15:36,315
<i> Remember: be worthy.</i>

297
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:48,594
- Ellie!

298
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:54,366
Ellie!

299
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:56,302
Ellie!

300
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:18,490
You're alive.

301
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,691
- I am alive.

302
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,530
- I thought I was
seeing things.

303
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,633
Where are we?

304
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:30,335
- They didn't tell you?

305
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:34,473
We were chosen.

306
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:37,243
- I never thought
I'd see you again.

307
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,848
- No.

308
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:44,850
Not here.

309
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,686
We have a curfew in an hour.

310
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:02,668
- Ellie, I love you.

311
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:04,936
- I can't believe
it's been a year.

312
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:10,909
I don't know how
I'd live without you.

313
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:14,380
- I missed you so much.

314
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:28,527
- It's crazy that
we're still alive.

315
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,028
I thought it was all over.

316
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:31,963
- When they put
that needle into my neck,

317
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:34,700
I really thought that
that was it.

318
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,401
I thought I was gonna die.

319
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:37,502
- Hey.

320
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:39,971
This place gives us a purpose.

321
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:42,708
Like, a second chance
to help and do right.

322
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,911
- Why would they kill some kids
and spare others?

323
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:47,479
That doesn't make any sense.

324
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,814
You don't really
believe that, do you?

325
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:50,549
- Of course.

326
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:52,050
We were chosen.

327
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,752
I mean, they believe that

328
00:17:53,752 --> 00:17:55,487
we have something to contribute.

329
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:57,556
We can be worthy.

330
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:58,824
- If they lied
to everyone before,

331
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:00,392
why wouldn't they lie
to us now?

332
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:02,027
<i> - Refusal to work.</i>

333
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:03,729
<i> Refusal to work.</i>

334
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,511
- Oh, you've had enough?

335
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:22,647
- Do it!
- Do it!

336
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:24,750
Jump, jump!
Come on!

337
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,485
Jump, jump!
- You're weak!

338
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:27,853
- Come on!
You're weak!

339
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:31,022
You hear me?

340
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,524
- Come on!
Do it!

341
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:33,892
- You're weak!
- Jump!

342
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:35,827
- Come on!
- Jump! Jump!

343
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:37,028
- He's weak.
- You're not worthy!

344
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:38,530
Now jump!

345
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:42,934
<i> - Get the net!</i>

346
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:49,775
- Snip, snip.

347
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:51,109
- "Snip, snip"?

348
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,011
- I heard anyone
who refuses to work

349
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:54,913
is sent to the infirmary,
and within a few hours

350
00:18:54,913 --> 00:18:57,716
they come back with alterations.

351
00:18:59,918 --> 00:19:01,086
- What'd he get?

352
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:02,955
- That's him.

353
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,110
- You must be new.

354
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,111
I'm Cage.

355
00:19:26,111 --> 00:19:28,881
- Blake Redding.

356
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:37,889
- Governor's kid, right?

357
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:39,758
That's cute.

358
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:41,793
Probably used to
getting whatever you want,

359
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:44,529
like Ellie.

360
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:47,232
You know,

361
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:49,634
since you're new here,

362
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:53,104
I'm gonna take it easy on you.

363
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:56,808
Ellie belongs

364
00:19:56,808 --> 00:19:59,945
to me now.

365
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:03,915
You can do whatever you want.

366
00:20:03,915 --> 00:20:09,054
But if you look at her again,

367
00:20:09,054 --> 00:20:11,824
I'm gonna kill you.

368
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:21,666
Okay.

369
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:29,241
- It's not gonna stop.

370
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:39,217
- What's up, boss?
- Hey.

371
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:42,120
- Hey, what's the deal with
those kids with the patches?

372
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,722
- Oh.

373
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:45,657
That's The Worthy.

374
00:20:45,657 --> 00:20:47,225
They're hand-selected
by The Incubator

375
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:50,595
to help supervise
the other workers.

376
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:53,565
- They're like cops?
- Yeah, more like mall cops.

377
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:56,768
- They're first in line
for reintroduction.

378
00:20:56,768 --> 00:21:00,539
- Oh, that's pretty awesome.
All this shit's co-ed.

379
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,076
- We're slaves, idiot.

380
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:07,846
- I'm not a slave.

381
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:09,247
I'm nobody's slave.

382
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,950
I'm Wade Freeman, bitch.

383
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,618
- You know what?

384
00:21:13,618 --> 00:21:15,554
Yeah,
that's a really good point.

385
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:17,889
You're Wade Freeman.
- Bitch.

386
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:20,125
He's Wade Freeman Bitch.

387
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:40,679
- Go.

388
00:21:41,346 --> 00:21:43,915
- Ellie, what is this?

389
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:45,216
- Just leave.

390
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:47,652
- I'm not going anywhere
without you.

391
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:49,254
- They will kill you.

392
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:51,289
Please go.

393
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:55,327
- Uh, this is Cage's girl,
Redding.

394
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:57,863
So you can move along now.

395
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:01,266
- We're just talking.

396
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:03,268
- Move along now.

397
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,771
- No.

398
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:08,373
I'm not leaving
without her.

399
00:22:08,373 --> 00:22:09,941
- Let's go.

400
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:18,249
Security!

401
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,818
It's over.

402
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:29,060
Come on.

403
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,695
- They're
approaching Sector 24!

404
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:39,204
Come on.

405
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:43,408
Run. Go!

406
00:22:43,408 --> 00:22:45,410
Run, Ellie!
Run!

407
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:06,665
- Blake!
- Keep them separate.

408
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:08,033
- Ellie!

409
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:10,368
- Blake!
- Ellie!

410
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,371
You.

411
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:15,740
- Going somewhere, Blake?

412
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:25,316
No.
- Not anymore.

413
00:23:38,096 --> 00:23:39,931
<i> - Things are heating up
 in an election that</i>

414
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:42,467
<i> could be a turning point
 in American history.</i>

415
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,803
<i> Texas Governor Dean Redding,</i>

416
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:46,771
<i> backed by tech leader
 Assuru Global,</i>

417
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:48,473
<i> is running on
 the strength and success</i>

418
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:50,909
<i> of the national
 thinning program.</i>

419
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:52,444
<i> Vermont Senator Elaine Davis</i>

420
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:54,813
<i> has taken a strong
 anti-thinning platform</i>

421
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:57,949
<i> that has brought her all the wa
 to her party's nomination.</i>

422
00:23:57,949 --> 00:24:00,385
She calls for a complete repeal
of the thinning,

423
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:03,154
which has proven very popular
among young voters.

424
00:24:03,154 --> 00:24:05,757
- Enough is enough.

425
00:24:05,757 --> 00:24:07,859
It's time to protect our kids

426
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:11,262
from this inhumane
and unconstitutional law.

427
00:24:11,262 --> 00:24:15,133
It's time to end the thinning.

428
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:17,368
- Even with a chance to reform,
Laina Michaels

429
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:19,370
continues her unwavering support

430
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,339
for Governor Redding
and the thinning.

431
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:25,844
- Being against the thinning
is a dishonor

432
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:29,013
to all the brave students
who sacrificed their lives

433
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:31,182
so we could be here today.

434
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:34,119
- The Governor
went on television

435
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,154
and called you
a domestic terrorist,

436
00:24:36,154 --> 00:24:39,190
a murderer,
without any evidence.

437
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,759
How can you support someone

438
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,994
who would
so viciously slander you?

439
00:24:42,994 --> 00:24:46,030
And what does that say about
the Governor's leadership?

440
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,500
<i> - I credit a man
 who will correct his mistakes</i>

441
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,201
<i> and own up to them.</i>

442
00:24:50,201 --> 00:24:52,337
<i> Governor Redding
 is that kind of man.</i>

443
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:54,005
<i> - But the investigation--</i>

444
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:55,907
<i> - It's been nearly a year,</i>

445
00:24:55,907 --> 00:24:58,843
<i> and nothing substantial against
 the Governor has emerged.</i>

446
00:24:58,843 --> 00:25:03,014
<i> - Why should people vote
 for Governor Redding next week?</i>

447
00:25:03,014 --> 00:25:06,017
<i> - Governor Redding
 has sacrificed everything</i>

448
00:25:06,017 --> 00:25:09,087
<i> for us to move forward
 as a society.</i>

449
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:12,490
<i> He will do whatever it takes
 to lead this country</i>

450
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,926
<i> and I proudly stand with him.</i>

451
00:25:16,828 --> 00:25:18,096
- And we're out.

452
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:21,065
All right, let's reset
for the next shot.

453
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:23,334
Can I get escort
for talent off set?

454
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:25,036
Thank you very much.

455
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:31,876
I can't keep doing this.

456
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:33,812
It's been eight months.

457
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:35,880
I've been giving you
everything.

458
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,549
Rifling through building files,

459
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:39,117
photos of restricted areas.

460
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:41,386
- Now is the time to focus
and do our jobs.

461
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:43,188
- What do you even do?

462
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:45,356
I'm out there every day

463
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:49,027
destroying my reputation
for a few bread crumbs.

464
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:50,862
I'm putting my life
on the line,

465
00:25:50,862 --> 00:25:52,197
and it feels like
I'm the only one!

466
00:25:57,001 --> 00:25:59,437
I'm sorry.

467
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:02,540
It's just--
this is eating away at me.

468
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,543
- If you stop now, it's over.

469
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:08,146
- I need to know Corrine
and Joey are taken care of.

470
00:26:08,146 --> 00:26:11,049
- I will see to it myself.

471
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:12,550
We now believe that

472
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,620
the files are on
Georgina's private computer.

473
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,590
If you can get access, we can
get what we need and pull you.

474
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,124
- No one is allowed
inside that office

475
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:21,926
without Georgina present.

476
00:26:21,926 --> 00:26:25,296
- We didn't say
this was gonna be easy.

477
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:28,132
Find a way in.

478
00:26:28,132 --> 00:26:29,968
If anyone can do it, you can.

479
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:32,470
- How am I going to
get access to her computer?

480
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,038
They all have password locks

481
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:36,074
or need special key card access.

482
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:39,277
- Jean's a digital safe cracker.

483
00:26:39,277 --> 00:26:41,412
- This provides both
the clearance and the file space

484
00:26:41,412 --> 00:26:43,114
needed to secure
any and all files

485
00:26:43,114 --> 00:26:44,616
from Georgina's database.

486
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:47,185
- The election is next week.

487
00:26:47,185 --> 00:26:50,188
It's now or never, Laina.

488
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:53,591
And, also,
we know about your friend.

489
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:56,294
- What friend?

490
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:57,428
- The one who's been
at every meeting

491
00:26:57,428 --> 00:26:59,097
for the last eight months.

492
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:02,634
- He's listening in right now.

493
00:27:04,402 --> 00:27:07,405
- Kellan, you can take off
the glasses now.

494
00:27:08,973 --> 00:27:10,909
<i> - No habla inglés.</i>

495
00:27:11,943 --> 00:27:14,679
- My opponent doesn't want
to invest in the future.

496
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:17,548
He thinks things are going fine
just the way they are.

497
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:20,118
And I'm here to tell you,
they aren't.

498
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,523
- Your state has more students
with higher test scores

499
00:27:25,523 --> 00:27:27,959
than in the history of Vermont,

500
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:30,061
and your entire campaign
is about rolling back

501
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:33,097
all that progress.

502
00:27:33,097 --> 00:27:35,199
- That's a good point,
but I refuse to--

503
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,001
- "That's a good point"?

504
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:38,937
We're never gonna hear that
in the debate, Alan.

505
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:44,575
- You mind if
I took a brief recess?

506
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,511
- No.
Go ahead, Congressman.

507
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:49,514
And, please, take your time.

508
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:52,116
- Let's have Thomas flown in.
- The former energy secretary?

509
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:53,551
- Yeah, he won't let up
on anybody.

510
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:56,254
- Thomas Hausman?
That's no good.

511
00:27:56,254 --> 00:27:58,156
You need to get used to
debating a woman.

512
00:27:58,156 --> 00:27:59,958
- I'll have Lindsay get you
a list of names.

513
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,660
- I can do it.

514
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,596
I'll debate you.

515
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,700
- Well, I appreciate
the sentiment, Laina,

516
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,336
but we're looking for someone
a little more qualified.

517
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:13,471
- The thinning
is a barbaric program

518
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:15,373
that blames students
for the failures

519
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:17,241
of a broken education system.

520
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:20,111
But it sure makes it easier
to put the blame on students

521
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:23,081
than having to look
higher on the totem pole.

522
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:28,619
- Why not?

523
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:37,128
- Our teachers
are the finest in the world.

524
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:38,563
And if you're gonna
blame them because

525
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:40,598
a few students are unwilling
to push themselves

526
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:43,067
to realize their full potential,

527
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:45,036
well, I won't stand for that.

528
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:47,705
- But you will stand
for a program that preys on

529
00:28:47,705 --> 00:28:50,508
the most disadvantaged
students in our society,

530
00:28:50,508 --> 00:28:52,143
students who are
less likely to pass

531
00:28:52,143 --> 00:28:54,145
because of their
socioeconomic background.

532
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:58,116
Whereas those born with
a silver spoon in their mouths

533
00:28:58,116 --> 00:29:00,051
never truly have to worry
about whether or not

534
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:01,686
they get to see
the next school year.

535
00:29:04,422 --> 00:29:09,694
- I think we all know
that my son had to worry.

536
00:29:09,694 --> 00:29:11,262
- Blake was one
of the kindest souls

537
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:14,198
I've ever had
the pleasure of knowing.

538
00:29:14,198 --> 00:29:16,567
And he failed the test
on purpose,

539
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:19,303
to protest this rigged system.

540
00:29:19,303 --> 00:29:21,339
You tried to bail him out,

541
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,141
but you got caught,

542
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:24,275
and you threw him under the bus

543
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:26,744
to advance
your political career.

544
00:29:26,744 --> 00:29:28,379
Is there enough room
for the American people

545
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:31,216
under that bus?

546
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:35,253
How was that?

547
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,256
- Uh, that was good.

548
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:39,657
- Yeah, it was good.
- Really good.

549
00:29:44,395 --> 00:29:46,697
<i> - Assuru global stocks
 are soaring this morning</i>

550
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:49,434
<i> as the company announces
 its quarterly earnings report,</i>

551
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:51,135
<i> surpassing expectations</i>

552
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:52,670
<i> of analysts and
 shareholders respectively.</i>

553
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,305
<i> - Software and services growth</i>

554
00:29:54,305 --> 00:29:56,340
<i> are crucial, but
 it's the hardware...</i>

555
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,709
<i> - Analysts are saying that's
 a 36% jump in R&D spending...</i>

556
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,445
<i> - That's what it takes
 to have stakes in this game.</i>

557
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:04,315
<i> - Assuru Global ensures
 made-in-America quality.</i>

558
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:07,545
<i> - All workers, please return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

559
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:11,182
<i> All workers, please return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

560
00:31:13,184 --> 00:31:16,387
<i> All workers, please return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

561
00:31:16,387 --> 00:31:18,823
<i> Remember: be worthy.</i>

562
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:29,467
- Hold it, hold it.
You know the rules.

563
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:31,636
Only The Worthy
and residents of this sector

564
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:34,572
are allowed in this area.

565
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:12,743
- Finish his ass!
- Get him, Cage!

566
00:32:12,743 --> 00:32:14,412
- He's a parasite!
Flush him!

567
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:16,380
- Get up!

568
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,549
I'm not done with you yet.

569
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:21,953
- You're not worthy!
- Stand up, man, let's go!

570
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:24,355
- You're not worthy!

571
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:33,664
- You just don't
got it in you!

572
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:38,703
- Punch him in the face, Cage!

573
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:40,271
- He was asking about you.

574
00:32:40,271 --> 00:32:41,739
Who?

575
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:43,274
- Cage.

576
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:45,276
He's waiting for you to slip,

577
00:32:45,276 --> 00:32:47,511
force you in there with him.

578
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:51,249
- Why hasn't anyone
kicked his ass yet?

579
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:52,583
- I don't know, bro.

580
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:55,519
Don't look like a bitch to me.

581
00:32:56,988 --> 00:33:00,424
He's not worthy!

582
00:33:00,424 --> 00:33:02,827
He's not worthy!

583
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:04,562
- Yeah.

584
00:33:04,562 --> 00:33:07,298
- Get this parasite out of here!

585
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:10,468
- If you're not worthy,
you're nothing!

586
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:13,337
Worthy! Worthy! Worthy!

587
00:33:13,337 --> 00:33:14,872
- Let's go, Cage!

588
00:33:14,872 --> 00:33:17,976
Worthy! Worthy! Worthy!

589
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:20,778
- Isn't anybody gonna help him?

590
00:33:20,778 --> 00:33:24,482
Not till after the fight.

591
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:25,983
- Hey.
- Oh, come on.

592
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:28,986
- This kid needs serious
medical attention now.

593
00:33:28,986 --> 00:33:31,956
Are you really gonna
make me take him?

594
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:33,424
- Let's see it!

595
00:33:33,424 --> 00:33:34,759
Come on, let's go.

596
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,627
- Who's next on the list?
- Next victim!

597
00:33:36,627 --> 00:33:38,596
- If you win, you lead.

598
00:33:38,596 --> 00:33:39,797
- Who's got it, baby?

599
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:42,867
Who's going next?

600
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:44,935
- Sooner or later, Redding,

601
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:47,004
you'll be in here.

602
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:48,839
Sooner or later.

603
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:53,911
- Come on, daddy's boy,
let's see it!

604
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:56,714
Let's see the daddy's boy!

605
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:12,563
<i> - Curfew is now in effect.</i>

606
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:14,765
<i> Curfew is now in effect.</i>

607
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:17,001
<i> Curfew is now in effect.</i>

608
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:26,911
- This is gonna be good.

609
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:28,413
- Get off.

610
00:35:10,554 --> 00:35:12,456
- See you tomorrow.

611
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:24,402
That's about an eight.
- Eight?

612
00:35:24,402 --> 00:35:26,137
How about this?

613
00:35:28,005 --> 00:35:30,141
Nine.

614
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:33,010
- This thing just won't heal.

615
00:35:34,812 --> 00:35:37,615
Blake, what
are they doing to you?

616
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:40,118
- I fell in the shower again.

617
00:35:48,826 --> 00:35:50,728
What's the deal with her?

618
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:52,596
- She refused to work.

619
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:01,605
- There is no reintroduction,

620
00:36:01,605 --> 00:36:03,641
is there?

621
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:10,214
Do you know that we're all here
against our will?

622
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:12,183
- The law is the law.

623
00:36:12,183 --> 00:36:15,853
- But they tell everyone
that we're dead.

624
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:19,190
- I can't be having
this conversation.

625
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:22,460
- Help me get out of here, Doc.

626
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,596
Doc, please.

627
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:38,542
- I'll see you in a few weeks.

628
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:43,514
Let's go, Blake.

629
00:36:43,514 --> 00:36:45,917
On way to living quarters, King.

630
00:37:12,276 --> 00:37:14,479
- Hey.

631
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:17,715
- Hi.
- Hi.

632
00:37:21,752 --> 00:37:23,854
Have you talked
to Ellie recently?

633
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:26,657
- Yeah, but
she's always with Cage,

634
00:37:26,657 --> 00:37:28,792
so not for long.

635
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:32,830
- I need you to get
a message to her, from me.

636
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:36,200
- You spend so much time
caring for her.

637
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,170
I think it's time you let
somebody take care of you.

638
00:37:44,942 --> 00:37:48,846
- Tell Ellie to come
to the cage match tomorrow.

639
00:37:48,846 --> 00:37:51,215
It's important.

640
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,828
- This isn't gonna take more
than five minutes, is it?

641
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:06,564
- I'll talk fast.
- Shoot.

642
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:08,098
- Okay, so I was looking into
the Vista Point story--

643
00:38:08,098 --> 00:38:09,199
- Oh, my God, Kellan,
you have a new angle

644
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,668
on this story every week.

645
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,102
- This one's different.
Five minutes.

646
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:14,138
- You have one minute.

647
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:16,974
- I practiced it for five.

648
00:38:16,974 --> 00:38:19,009
Okay, I'll talk very fast.

649
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:21,745
The machines the T-2401 tests
are performed on

650
00:38:21,745 --> 00:38:23,314
<i> are made by Assuru Global.</i>

651
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:25,215
both: But we already knew that.
- Right, exactly.

652
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:27,651
And Assuru Global has been
touting their massive increase

653
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:29,587
in production, which
I thought I had figured out

654
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:31,221
when I bum-rushed
Georgina Preston at her office.

655
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:33,123
- You did what?

656
00:38:33,123 --> 00:38:36,093
<i> - Where you headed, Georgina?
 - Shareholders' meeting.</i>

657
00:38:36,093 --> 00:38:37,995
<i> We're talking about
 how Assuru has tripled</i>

658
00:38:37,995 --> 00:38:39,863
<i> its production
 and is on its way</i>

659
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:41,765
<i> to having
 a record-shattering year.</i>

660
00:38:41,765 --> 00:38:43,233
- How could you have
increased production?

661
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:45,202
You laid off
half your workforce.

662
00:38:45,202 --> 00:38:47,905
Obviously our young friend

663
00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:49,340
hasn't heard of automation.

664
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,841
Excuse me.

665
00:38:50,841 --> 00:38:53,010
- I know, it was premature,
you know,

666
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,212
but that gave me everything.

667
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:56,880
Automation.

668
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,949
<i> If they're making
 more tablets now,</i>

669
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:00,651
<i> then they're using a lot more
 machines to make them, right?</i>

670
00:39:00,651 --> 00:39:02,252
So I dug up their expenditures.

671
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:04,288
- How did you get those?

672
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:06,323
- I have a friend... who hacks.

673
00:39:06,323 --> 00:39:08,092
<i> Not important.</i>

674
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:10,027
But I found that they
are paying for machines

675
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:11,195
that they're not
actually receiving.

676
00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:12,930
So I took a tour
of the new campus,

677
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,298
which is really nice.

678
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:16,834
- Assuru Global
is the industry leader

679
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:19,003
in cutting-edge
consumer electronics.

680
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:21,271
<i> - And you should really see
 their manufacturing room.</i>

681
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:23,340
Really, you should.
Because I didn't.

682
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,142
<i> Because they don't have one.</i>

683
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:27,177
<i> I walked the entire campus
 with a pedometer.</i>

684
00:39:27,177 --> 00:39:29,013
And if you were to fill
the entire thing with machines,

685
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:30,948
even in the places I walked--
which had none--

686
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:32,716
<i> you wouldn't be able
 to get to half</i>

687
00:39:32,716 --> 00:39:34,718
<i> of the output
 that they're shipping.</i>

688
00:39:34,718 --> 00:39:35,886
- So they're outsourcing.

689
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:37,354
- Right,
I though the same thing.

690
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:38,956
<i> But according
 to their expenditures,</i>

691
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:40,324
<i> they're also
 regularly "in-sourcing"</i>

692
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:41,825
<i> 100 million pounds
 of food per year</i>

693
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:43,927
<i> from a company called TXPAK.</i>

694
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:46,964
Military rations.

695
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:50,200
Let me just make sure
I got this right.

696
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,770
TXPAK is the sole distributor
of MREs

697
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:55,773
for the entire U.S. military?
<i> - One of three, actually.</i>

698
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:57,941
<i> We're very proud to be one
 of three major suppliers</i>

699
00:39:57,941 --> 00:39:59,443
<i> for heat-and-serve
 meal packages.</i>

700
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:01,779
- The average human eats
three pounds of food per day.

701
00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:04,882
<i> They have enough food to feed
 100,000 people per year.</i>

702
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:07,051
And that's just
what I've found so far.

703
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:08,385
- What are you saying?

704
00:40:08,385 --> 00:40:10,254
- I think they're using
failed students

705
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:13,190
to make tablets
and phones and whatever,

706
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,426
and I think it's all connected
to Vista Point.

707
00:40:15,426 --> 00:40:16,427
- How?

708
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:17,995
- Have you ever looked at

709
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:19,363
the blueprints
for the original build?

710
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:20,798
<i> - Of course not.</i>

711
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:22,466
<i> - I just did.
 Massive vents, by the way.</i>

712
00:40:22,466 --> 00:40:23,967
You could fit a human in there.

713
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,803
They also have
special designated areas

714
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:27,738
<i> for freight elevators.</i>

715
00:40:27,738 --> 00:40:30,374
And these elevators only go
from the first floor down.

716
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:33,277
15 stories,
and--and they go to nothing,

717
00:40:33,277 --> 00:40:36,313
nothing that's on the plans.

718
00:40:36,313 --> 00:40:37,881
So I say we call the cops.

719
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:41,151
- Hi, Brad.
Now's a good time.

720
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:42,453
- Oh, my God.

721
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:44,421
- What you have
is circumstantial.

722
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:46,223
It's a conspiracy theory.

723
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:48,392
No photos, no videos,
no proof?

724
00:40:48,392 --> 00:40:49,860
No story.

725
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,329
- So you want me
to get video?

726
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:53,964
- Yes, we are working on
confirming that interview.

727
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:56,100
- Of an illegal,
underground slave operation

728
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,935
run by the biggest corporation
in the world,

729
00:40:57,935 --> 00:41:00,003
which also happens to be
the single largest donor

730
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:01,905
to Governor Redding's
campaign for president.

731
00:41:01,905 --> 00:41:03,073
- Can you get a truck
ready for me?

732
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:04,274
- Super.

733
00:41:04,274 --> 00:41:05,275
- Shut the door
on your way out.

734
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:06,810
- I'm only 18.

735
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:07,945
It's my first job
out of high school,

736
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:09,513
but you got it, boss.

737
00:41:09,513 --> 00:41:11,381
Wish I got thinned.

738
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:12,983
I don't mean that.

739
00:41:12,983 --> 00:41:14,885
Maybe I do.

740
00:41:14,885 --> 00:41:16,019
Yeah.

741
00:42:06,336 --> 00:42:07,905
- Blake?

742
00:42:07,905 --> 00:42:08,906
- Shh.

743
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:10,541
We don't have much time.

744
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:15,078
- I can't keep doing this.
- You have to.

745
00:42:15,078 --> 00:42:16,980
You're so close.

746
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,183
Don't give up now.

747
00:42:46,176 --> 00:42:48,478
- What's up?

748
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:50,047
I got some brews.

749
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:51,481
Paid a homeless dude
50 bucks for this.

750
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:53,550
- Kellan,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

751
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,985
- It's 2:00 in the morning?

752
00:42:54,985 --> 00:42:57,221
That means it's time to party!

753
00:42:57,221 --> 00:42:59,490
Whoo!
Let's cruise and do some shots!

754
00:43:00,257 --> 00:43:04,261
So, you know, I was hanging out
at my place, alone,

755
00:43:04,261 --> 00:43:05,929
and I was thinking,

756
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:07,497
"Do you know who I want
to hang out with?

757
00:43:07,497 --> 00:43:09,199
My best friend, Laina."
- Kellan.

758
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,601
- Now, full disclosure,
I drank some of them,

759
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:12,369
so you have
some catching up to do.

760
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:14,004
- Kellan, what the hell?
They're sleeping.

761
00:43:14,004 --> 00:43:15,505
- Yeah, "what the hell"
is right.

762
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:17,241
We've gotta get some tunes
in here, it's too quiet.

763
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:18,475
Oh!

764
00:43:18,475 --> 00:43:19,476
- Kellan, stop.

765
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:22,479
Kellan, knock it off.
Kellan!

766
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:24,081
Kellan, why in the world--

767
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:15,465
<i> - All workers, return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

768
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:19,703
<i> All workers, return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

769
00:44:19,703 --> 00:44:23,173
<i> All workers, return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

770
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:25,409
- Hey.
<i> - Remember: be worthy.</i>

771
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:27,244
- Heather.
- Hey.

772
00:44:27,244 --> 00:44:29,279
- Have you seen Blake?

773
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:32,182
- I don't know how
to tell you this...

774
00:44:32,182 --> 00:44:34,084
- What?

775
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:35,719
Did something happen?

776
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:38,989
- Blake, he--

777
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:41,491
he doesn't want
to see you anymore.

778
00:44:45,562 --> 00:44:47,998
- I--I didn't--
- Ellie.

779
00:44:47,998 --> 00:44:50,367
You should just move on.

780
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:52,703
I know that this is
a terrible thing to say,

781
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:57,074
but you have to live your life
without Blake Redding.

782
00:44:57,074 --> 00:44:59,043
I'm sorry.

783
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:04,448
Okay.

784
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:06,316
It's done.
- She gonna be okay?

785
00:45:06,316 --> 00:45:07,985
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

786
00:45:07,985 --> 00:45:11,054
So you're gonna put in
a good word for me, right?

787
00:45:11,054 --> 00:45:12,189
- Absolutely.

788
00:45:12,189 --> 00:45:14,191
I'm very close with Mason.

789
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:16,159
He takes my recommendations

790
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,496
for a reintroduction seriously.

791
00:45:19,496 --> 00:45:21,765
You did good.

792
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:37,614
<i> - Dean Redding believes in

793
00:45:37,614 --> 00:45:39,616

00:45:39,616 --> 00:45:42,052

<i> If you want

800
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:54,564
<i> vote Dean Redding.</i>

801
00:45:54,564 --> 00:45:57,501
- I'm Dean Redding,
and I approve this message.

802
00:46:00,337 --> 00:46:01,738
- Okay, you guys.

803
00:46:01,738 --> 00:46:04,174
Everything's going
to be okay.

804
00:46:04,174 --> 00:46:07,077
Just be good to Miss Cole.

805
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:09,780
- Okay.
- I love you both so much.

806
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,648
- I love you, too.

807
00:46:19,456 --> 00:46:21,458
- You ready?

808
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:30,634
- Hey, guys.
I have breakfast ready for you.

809
00:46:30,634 --> 00:46:33,037
Hurry before it's cold.

810
00:46:36,773 --> 00:46:39,609
- So this is our last chance
at this, right?

811
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:41,678
- You're going to be fine.

812
00:46:41,678 --> 00:46:43,313
I'll be unreachable
for a little bit

813
00:46:43,313 --> 00:46:44,848
while we get them to safety.

814
00:46:44,848 --> 00:46:47,317
Once you get the information,
all you have to do

815
00:46:47,317 --> 00:46:50,454
is get it to Jack,
and you're home free.

816
00:46:50,454 --> 00:46:52,122
And no matter what happens,

817
00:46:52,122 --> 00:46:54,691
Corrine and Joey
are going to be safe.

818
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:56,560
We'll be seeing you.

819
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:09,706
Okay, you can eat those
on the way.

820
00:47:09,706 --> 00:47:10,808
Let's go.

821
00:47:12,809 --> 00:47:14,344
Just down here a little.

822
00:47:15,212 --> 00:47:17,547
This way, guys.
Come on.

823
00:47:19,716 --> 00:47:21,785
Just wait here.

824
00:47:39,402 --> 00:47:41,105
Come on.

825
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:55,585
- Everything's gonna be okay.

826
00:47:55,585 --> 00:47:58,755
I've got a good feeling.

827
00:47:58,755 --> 00:48:00,457
- Why are you doing this?

828
00:48:00,457 --> 00:48:03,827
- My map is telling me
this is a faster route.

829
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:06,296
- No, I mean,

830
00:48:06,296 --> 00:48:08,398
why are you helping?

831
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,572
- My little sister, Kelli,

832
00:48:15,572 --> 00:48:19,442
uh, she was dyslexic.

833
00:48:19,442 --> 00:48:21,912
Everything took
a little more time.

834
00:48:21,912 --> 00:48:24,548
Every day after school,
I would stay and help her,

835
00:48:24,548 --> 00:48:26,683
make sure she didn't
fall behind.

836
00:48:26,683 --> 00:48:29,753
Senior year came around, and,

837
00:48:29,753 --> 00:48:33,823
you know, I got too wrapped up
into partying,

838
00:48:33,823 --> 00:48:37,894
and overconfident with
the idea that she would be fine.

839
00:48:37,894 --> 00:48:41,731
And I started
to let things slip.

840
00:48:41,731 --> 00:48:45,969
She was taken from me.

841
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:47,771
And not a day goes by
that I don't wish

842
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:50,474
I had done more.

843
00:48:54,377 --> 00:48:56,513
That's why I'm here.

844
00:48:58,448 --> 00:49:01,518
- Well, if this works,
no one will ever have to

845
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:03,820
go through something
like that again.

846
00:49:32,949 --> 00:49:35,786
- Good luck in there.

847
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,294
- You too.

848
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:56,740
<i> - It's gonna be
 an exciting race, for sure.</i>

849
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,842
<i> It's really, really difficult
 to know who's gonna</i>

850
00:49:58,842 --> 00:50:00,610
come out on top here,
so we're interested to see

851
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,012
how the day will play out.

852
00:50:22,332 --> 00:50:23,600
- Bathroom?

853
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,968
- Ma'am, this is
a secure facility.

854
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:25,969
I'll have to escort you.

855
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:27,003
This way.

856
00:50:39,082 --> 00:50:40,917
Miss?

857
00:50:40,917 --> 00:50:42,819
The bathroom.

858
00:51:00,437 --> 00:51:02,472
- If you don't want to work
on the line,

859
00:51:02,472 --> 00:51:04,341
then you work in here with me.

860
00:51:05,642 --> 00:51:07,644
- Cage! Cage! Cage! Cage!

861
00:51:07,644 --> 00:51:10,781
Cage! Cage! Cage! Cage!

862
00:51:15,485 --> 00:51:16,886
- I don't want
to work on the line.

863
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,029
- I'm gonna enjoy this.

864
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:27,864
Someone get ole limpy up here.

865
00:51:37,374 --> 00:51:40,477
- Now this is entertainment.

866
00:52:06,836 --> 00:52:08,638
- He was faking it!

867
00:52:08,638 --> 00:52:09,639
He was faking it!

868
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:11,908
- When you go down,

869
00:52:11,908 --> 00:52:13,810
you're gonna stay down.

870
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:15,979
- If you go down,

871
00:52:15,979 --> 00:52:17,847
I lead The Worthy.

872
00:52:17,847 --> 00:52:20,650
- I never go down.

873
00:53:11,868 --> 00:53:13,903
- Ellie Harper,
you are in direct violation

874
00:53:13,903 --> 00:53:15,505
of Section 6 work order.

875
00:53:15,505 --> 00:53:17,607
Proceed to your workstation now.

876
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,852
- Come on!

877
00:53:38,995 --> 00:53:40,763
- Yeah, Cage!
Get him!

878
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:53,243
- No response?
- Nothing.

879
00:53:53,243 --> 00:53:55,011
She won't get up.

880
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,265
I'm getting out of here!

881
00:54:16,766 --> 00:54:18,701
Take her down!

882
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,788
- Take her down.
- No! No!

883
00:54:38,788 --> 00:54:39,756
- Come on.
- No!

884
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:41,958
- Lock her down.
- Get off of me!

885
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:43,760
Let me go!
- That's it, guys.

886
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,994
Hey, back to your sector!

887
00:54:44,994 --> 00:54:46,996
- Oh, my God.
- No!

888
00:54:46,996 --> 00:54:48,131
Stop!
- Ellie.

889
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:51,801
- Cage!

890
00:54:51,801 --> 00:54:53,770
- Get up, Cage, come on!

891
00:55:03,913 --> 00:55:05,281
- No!

892
00:55:05,281 --> 00:55:07,684
- Come on, Cage, get up!

893
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:11,021
Blake! Blake! Blake! Blake!

894
00:55:31,975 --> 00:55:35,078
Blake! Blake! Blake!

895
00:55:40,817 --> 00:55:43,954
Blake! Blake! Blake!

896
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,896
- The new leader of The Worthy!

897
00:56:02,772 --> 00:56:04,907
- It's Ellie.

898
00:56:24,727 --> 00:56:28,831
- Everything you've been told
about this place is a lie.

899
00:56:28,831 --> 00:56:31,701
There were no killed students.

900
00:56:31,701 --> 00:56:35,104
They did it for cheap labor
to help Assuru make products.

901
00:56:35,104 --> 00:56:38,174
- So...

902
00:56:38,174 --> 00:56:41,277
there's no reintroduction?

903
00:56:41,277 --> 00:56:43,012
- No.

904
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:45,048
The alarm was for Ellie.

905
00:56:45,048 --> 00:56:48,017
And I can get to her.

906
00:56:48,017 --> 00:56:50,353
But I'm gonna need all of
your help to get her out.

907
00:56:50,353 --> 00:56:52,922
- No one's ever
gotten out before.

908
00:56:52,922 --> 00:56:55,324
- Then this is gonna
end quickly,

909
00:56:55,324 --> 00:56:57,727
but I have to try.

910
00:57:00,463 --> 00:57:03,433
What do you need us to do?

911
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:08,771
- We just received audio
of presidential candidate

912
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:12,408
Elaine Davis having a sordid
conversation with a staffer.

913
00:57:12,408 --> 00:57:13,910
<i> - We have to warn you,
 there is some</i>

914
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,411
<i> crude language
 within the tape.</i>

915
00:57:15,411 --> 00:57:17,346
<i> - Oh, come the on,
 Meredith,</i>

916
00:57:17,346 --> 00:57:19,849
<i> voters have their head up
 their ass.</i>

917
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:21,417
<i> They shouldn't even have
 the right to vote, because</i>

918
00:57:21,417 --> 00:57:23,920
<i> when they do, they just
 this country up.</i>

919
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,823
<i> Everyone between
 California and New York</i>

920
00:57:26,823 --> 00:57:29,358
<i> are dumb
 for brains.</i>

921
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:31,461
<i> It's not even exaggeration.</i>

922
00:57:31,461 --> 00:57:34,397
<i> It's true.</i>

923
00:57:34,397 --> 00:57:35,998
- This is a game-changer.

924
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:37,467
I mean,
this could cost her Iowa.

925
00:57:37,467 --> 00:57:39,202
- Is this getting played
everywhere?

926
00:57:40,436 --> 00:57:42,872
- Yeah.
Everywhere.

927
00:57:42,872 --> 00:57:44,807
- Oh.

928
00:57:44,807 --> 00:57:46,909
Whoever leaked this,
I love you.

929
00:57:46,909 --> 00:57:48,311
<i> - She was very...</i>

930
00:58:08,364 --> 00:58:10,166
- You okay in there?

931
00:58:14,537 --> 00:58:15,805
Miss Michaels?

932
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:33,823
- Oh, my God.

933
00:58:46,135 --> 00:58:48,838
Blake.

934
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:50,840
- Georgina, Frank Paulsen's
calling for you.

935
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,409
- I left something in my office.

936
00:59:18,501 --> 00:59:21,370
- Excuse me.
Miss Preston?

937
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:23,539
The Governor would like
to see you right away.

938
00:59:23,539 --> 00:59:25,374
- Give me a minute.

939
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:36,286
- No.

940
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,956
He said it's urgent.

941
00:59:55,538 --> 00:59:58,541
- That's excellent.
Thank you so much for that.

942
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:01,477
- What?
- Beg your pardon?

943
01:00:01,477 --> 01:00:04,113
- You told Jack you needed me
for something urgent.

944
01:00:04,113 --> 01:00:06,416
- No.
No, I didn't.

945
01:00:19,662 --> 01:00:21,130
- Yeah, go ahead.
Just take it off.

946
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:24,133
Take the whole thing off,
I don't care.

947
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:27,904
- Everything okay?

948
01:00:29,972 --> 01:00:32,041
You didn't respond.

949
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:34,944
- I had to use the bathroom.

950
01:00:41,417 --> 01:00:45,221
- Laina.

951
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:47,624
What happened to you?

952
01:00:53,229 --> 01:00:55,097
- Laundry day.

953
01:00:55,097 --> 01:01:00,069
- Laundry.

954
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:02,939
I've never done my own laundry.

955
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:10,579
- Go, go, go.
Just--don't stop.

956
01:01:13,482 --> 01:01:14,717
- Is the shuttle on time?

957
01:01:14,717 --> 01:01:16,118
- It leaves out of Matamoros
at 6:00.

958
01:01:16,118 --> 01:01:17,119
- We'll make if we go now.

959
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,622
I'll lead the way.

960
01:01:21,357 --> 01:01:23,192
<i> - I'm sorry,
 the number you have--</i>

961
01:01:26,362 --> 01:01:28,064
<i> - You've reached
 Agent Joanne Morris.</i>

962
01:01:28,064 --> 01:01:29,966
<i> Please leave a message.</i>
- This is Laina Michaels.

963
01:01:29,966 --> 01:01:32,068
I need to see you right away.

964
01:02:07,503 --> 01:02:09,271
- Got a worker down.

965
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:10,606
- Oh, chief, he's bleeding.
You gotta do something.

966
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:12,608
- Take him to
the infirmary. Let's go.

967
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:15,211
<i> - Production ceased
 until further notice.</i>

968
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,055
- Watch where you're going,
Freeman.

969
01:02:26,055 --> 01:02:27,690
- Don't touch me, bro.

970
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:30,226
- I'm not your bro.

971
01:02:30,226 --> 01:02:32,661
That's right.

972
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:34,597
'Cause you're my bitch.
- Bitch.

973
01:02:34,597 --> 01:02:36,732
- Yeah.
- Bitch!

974
01:02:36,732 --> 01:02:38,234
- Fight!

975
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,038
- Let's go,
let's go!

976
01:02:42,038 --> 01:02:43,072
- Take out the boys!

977
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:50,246
- Seal all exits.

978
01:02:50,246 --> 01:02:52,081
Code 695.

979
01:02:52,081 --> 01:02:53,516
All DPC Guards report
to the mess hall.

980
01:02:53,516 --> 01:02:54,817
<i> Code 695!</i>

981
01:02:54,817 --> 01:02:56,052
I got an injured student

982
01:02:56,052 --> 01:02:57,253
here at the East Corridor.

983
01:03:08,264 --> 01:03:10,633
- You know what to do.

984
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:21,110
- Sorry for all the theatrics.

985
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:22,678
I don't know
who might be after you.

986
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:25,114
- Blake Redding is alive.
- What?

987
01:03:25,114 --> 01:03:26,449
- I saw him.

988
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:28,084
Assuru Global
has a remote complex

989
01:03:28,084 --> 01:03:29,652
where failed students
are being put to work

990
01:03:29,652 --> 01:03:31,320
in some kind of labor camps.

991
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,256
- Who else knows about this?

992
01:03:34,256 --> 01:03:36,325
- You're my first call.

993
01:03:36,325 --> 01:03:38,661
- Is your theory backed up
by evidence?

994
01:03:40,162 --> 01:03:43,632
- Here.
It's all here.

995
01:03:43,632 --> 01:03:45,234
- We're gonna have to hide you.

996
01:03:45,234 --> 01:03:47,103
They might be onto you already.

997
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:49,138
I need your phone, keys, wallet,

998
01:03:49,138 --> 01:03:51,507
anything they might have
bugged you with.

999
01:03:55,511 --> 01:03:59,482
More importantly, your family.

1000
01:03:59,482 --> 01:04:01,617
Where are your siblings?
- They're with a friend.

1001
01:04:01,617 --> 01:04:02,885
- You don't have friends
anymore.

1002
01:04:02,885 --> 01:04:04,520
Who's this friend?

1003
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,522
- Maggie Cole, their teacher.

1004
01:04:06,522 --> 01:04:08,524
She's taking them out
of the country.

1005
01:04:08,524 --> 01:04:11,327
- How?
- I don't know.

1006
01:04:11,327 --> 01:04:13,896
Through some kind of
tunnel system to the border.

1007
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:15,598
- Okay.

1008
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:17,900
They're safe.
We can work with that.

1009
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,535
Do you have any
other devices on you?

1010
01:04:19,535 --> 01:04:22,171
- That's it.
- Good.

1011
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,642
Turn around.
- What?

1012
01:04:26,642 --> 01:04:28,544
- Walk to the edge.

1013
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,284
- Wait.

1014
01:04:35,284 --> 01:04:39,188
That sign says "El Toro."

1015
01:04:39,188 --> 01:04:40,789
We're going the wrong way.

1016
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,629
Joey!

1017
01:04:46,629 --> 01:04:48,664
- John.

1018
01:04:48,664 --> 01:04:50,699
- They found my kids.

1019
01:04:54,503 --> 01:04:56,639
- No!

1020
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:59,275
Please!
Please!

1021
01:05:04,313 --> 01:05:07,183
- You're with Assuru?

1022
01:05:07,183 --> 01:05:08,184
- Kind of.

1023
01:05:08,184 --> 01:05:09,619
<i> - Help!</i>

1024
01:05:16,825 --> 01:05:19,261
Blake.

1025
01:05:19,261 --> 01:05:22,264
- It's way harder for a coroner
to explain bullets in your back

1026
01:05:22,264 --> 01:05:23,933
from an unmarked weapon

1027
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:26,502
than an overworked employee
cracking under pressure

1028
01:05:26,502 --> 01:05:29,238
and taking the plunge.

1029
01:05:29,238 --> 01:05:31,340
But I'll leave it up to you.

1030
01:05:52,294 --> 01:05:54,330
- Damn it!

1031
01:06:09,578 --> 01:06:11,714
<i> - She may just
 handed this race over</i>

1032
01:06:11,714 --> 01:06:12,882
<i> to Governor Redding.</i>

1033
01:06:16,752 --> 01:06:18,621
- Shit.

1034
01:06:23,392 --> 01:06:24,560
- It's okay.

1035
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,728
You're safe now.

1036
01:06:25,728 --> 01:06:27,029
We just have to hurry.

1037
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:28,464
Come on.

1038
01:06:40,442 --> 01:06:42,411
- We don't have much time.

1039
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:50,019
You might want
to look away for this.

1040
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,021
- Oh, no.

1041
01:06:54,323 --> 01:06:55,591
Oh, God...

1042
01:07:10,005 --> 01:07:11,707
What are you doing?

1043
01:07:11,707 --> 01:07:13,909
It was all a lie.

1044
01:07:17,613 --> 01:07:20,049
Who?
Who put you up to this?

1045
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:21,583
Who put you up to
this?

1046
01:07:27,656 --> 01:07:28,657
Redding.

1047
01:07:36,498 --> 01:07:37,766
<i> - California then
 goes to Davis, but...</i>

1048
01:07:37,766 --> 01:07:39,501
Shit.

1049
01:07:39,501 --> 01:07:41,503
- <i> It may be too late
 in the game.</i>

1050
01:07:41,503 --> 01:07:44,106
<i> I mean, what's happening here
 in the Midwest...</i>

1051
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:46,075
- Hi.

1052
01:07:54,783 --> 01:07:56,085
Sorry.

1053
01:08:02,124 --> 01:08:04,793
<i> I credit a man
 who will correct his mistakes</i>

1054
01:08:04,793 --> 01:08:06,528
<i> and own up to them.</i>

1055
01:08:06,528 --> 01:08:09,598
<i> Governor Redding
 is that kind of man.</i>

1056
01:08:09,598 --> 01:08:11,633
<i> - BNC can now confirm</i>

1057
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:14,837
<i> that North Carolina has gone
 to Governor Redding.</i>

1058
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:18,574
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, Donna.

1059
01:08:18,574 --> 01:08:20,142
Thank you, thank you.

1060
01:08:20,142 --> 01:08:21,610
Barbara, thank you.

1061
01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:23,412
It's still early.
It's still early.

1062
01:08:23,412 --> 01:08:24,847
- How could this have happened?

1063
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:26,715
My property was stolen
and you did nothing?

1064
01:08:26,715 --> 01:08:27,916
Where's the girl?

1065
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:29,551
Has anyone found the girl?

1066
01:08:29,551 --> 01:08:32,021
I'll handle this myself.

1067
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:43,766
- Is this a bad time?

1068
01:08:45,634 --> 01:08:47,136
You have a high-tech program
that can

1069
01:08:47,136 --> 01:08:49,104
extract data from
damaged drives, right?

1070
01:08:49,104 --> 01:08:50,606
- For water damage?

1071
01:08:50,606 --> 01:08:52,775
Oh, yeah.

1072
01:09:01,917 --> 01:09:03,585
- Oh.

1073
01:09:03,585 --> 01:09:06,121
- It's 2040.
It's the best we've got.

1074
01:09:06,121 --> 01:09:09,558
- You don't have something
more cutting-edge?

1075
01:09:09,558 --> 01:09:10,893
- Oh, wait, I got it.

1076
01:09:10,893 --> 01:09:12,895
One sec.

1077
01:09:14,997 --> 01:09:18,167
This is the latest
in fan technology.

1078
01:09:19,768 --> 01:09:21,737
- Clearly.

1079
01:09:21,737 --> 01:09:24,073
- So you've been good?

1080
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:27,576
Okay, here goes nothing.

1081
01:09:33,549 --> 01:09:35,818
It worked.

1082
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:42,958
I, uh--

1083
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:44,860
I gotta make a copy of this.

1084
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:47,663
This is way too big to have
on one waterlogged drive.

1085
01:09:47,663 --> 01:09:50,199
- Thank you, Kellan.

1086
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:53,101
You're literally the only person
I can trust anymore.

1087
01:09:53,101 --> 01:09:55,971
- Well, until Blake comes back.

1088
01:09:55,971 --> 01:09:58,907
- Kellan, I--
- No, it's--it's cool.

1089
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:00,576
We're good.

1090
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:04,480
I've, uh, moved on.

1091
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,982
Actually, I'm really into
this one coworker of mine.

1092
01:10:06,982 --> 01:10:08,684
It's getting pretty serious.

1093
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:10,018
She's a little more into me
than I'm into her,

1094
01:10:10,018 --> 01:10:13,055
but I'm warming to her.

1095
01:10:13,055 --> 01:10:14,556
- Isn't Wendy married?

1096
01:10:14,556 --> 01:10:16,592
- Oh, she is.

1097
01:10:18,093 --> 01:10:20,128
But we can trust her.

1098
01:10:20,128 --> 01:10:21,797
And once she sees
what you've got,

1099
01:10:21,797 --> 01:10:24,766
she won't be able
to ignore this anymore.

1100
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:26,235
Or me.

1101
01:10:27,569 --> 01:10:29,671
All right.
We're all set.

1102
01:10:29,671 --> 01:10:30,739
- Perfect,
I'll bring it to Wendy.

1103
01:10:30,739 --> 01:10:31,840
- Whoa, no.
No way.

1104
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,041
They're looking for you.

1105
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:35,277
Just stay here and lay low.

1106
01:10:35,277 --> 01:10:38,113
I'll take this to Wendy
and she'll get it live.

1107
01:10:38,113 --> 01:10:40,916
You're, uh--
you're gonna be okay.

1108
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:41,984
- Thank you.

1109
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:43,218
- Oh, and whatever you do,

1110
01:10:43,218 --> 01:10:45,020
don't look through
my browser history.

1111
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,555
No, I need you to promise me

1112
01:10:46,555 --> 01:10:48,257
you won't look through
my browser history.

1113
01:10:48,257 --> 01:10:49,791
You know what,
I'm just gonna, um--

1114
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:50,792
I'm just gonna
delete it quickly.

1115
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:51,927
Can you close your eyes?

1116
01:10:51,927 --> 01:10:53,829
- Are you serious?
- Please.

1117
01:10:58,066 --> 01:11:00,002
Okay.

1118
01:11:01,637 --> 01:11:03,005
See you soon.

1119
01:12:22,317 --> 01:12:24,686
- Where are we going?

1120
01:12:24,686 --> 01:12:27,022
- Home.

1121
01:12:46,074 --> 01:12:47,142
- Wait!

1122
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:27,315
Go for it.
- Okay.

1123
01:13:27,315 --> 01:13:29,217
- Did she say
where they were going?

1124
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:34,222
- Georgina, what's going on?

1125
01:13:34,222 --> 01:13:36,858
- The drive is all that matters.
The girl is of no further use.

1126
01:13:36,858 --> 01:13:38,460
Thank you, Joanna.

1127
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,796
- Who was that?

1128
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:44,232
- None of your concern, honey.
- Sir.

1129
01:13:44,232 --> 01:13:45,333
Sir, that was Ohio.

1130
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:47,936
You're over 270.
- What?

1131
01:13:49,404 --> 01:13:50,839
- May I be the first

1132
01:13:50,839 --> 01:13:52,474
to congratulate you,
Mister President.

1133
01:13:52,474 --> 01:13:54,042
- We did it?

1134
01:13:54,042 --> 01:13:56,078
- Yes, we did it.
- We did it? We did it!

1135
01:13:57,746 --> 01:14:00,182
We did it!

1136
01:14:00,182 --> 01:14:02,150
We did it, everybody!
We did it!

1137
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:03,485
Outstanding!

1138
01:14:07,122 --> 01:14:08,924
- Medical staffers.
Where did they go?

1139
01:14:08,924 --> 01:14:10,893
Uh, southwest corridor.

1140
01:14:17,933 --> 01:14:19,901
Thanks.
- Are you okay?

1141
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:21,403
- Yeah.

1142
01:14:21,403 --> 01:14:22,938
Let's go.

1143
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:35,517
- Where is it?

1144
01:14:35,517 --> 01:14:37,452
Where is the drive?

1145
01:14:37,452 --> 01:14:39,388
- Go to hell.

1146
01:14:43,792 --> 01:14:45,894
- Where is the drive?

1147
01:14:45,894 --> 01:14:47,162
Where is it?

1148
01:14:47,162 --> 01:14:48,463
Is it with your sister?

1149
01:14:48,463 --> 01:14:49,998
Your brother?

1150
01:14:49,998 --> 01:14:51,466
'Cause that's where
I'm going next.

1151
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:07,182
Oh, my--oh, my God.

1152
01:16:16,084 --> 01:16:17,352
- Go.

1153
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:21,189
- Hey, Marvin,
did you get an ID

1154
01:16:21,189 --> 01:16:23,525
on the car-bombing victim?

1155
01:16:23,525 --> 01:16:25,961
- Wendy.

1156
01:16:26,928 --> 01:16:29,030
- Oh, my God...

1157
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,010
- We just received word
that Senator Elaine Davis

1158
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,379
did call Governor Redding
to concede the election.

1159
01:16:44,379 --> 01:16:46,982
- Which means that
we are only moments away from

1160
01:16:46,982 --> 01:16:49,484
hearing the President Elect's
acceptance speech.

1161
01:16:49,484 --> 01:16:50,552
<i> - This is amazing.</i>

1162
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:52,621
<i> - What a historic night indeed.</i>

1163
01:16:56,124 --> 01:16:59,461
Where's Laina?

1164
01:16:59,461 --> 01:17:01,964
- She's coming.

1165
01:17:06,401 --> 01:17:08,370
- Ellie.
Come on.

1166
01:17:23,318 --> 01:17:25,086
- Can I help you?

1167
01:17:25,086 --> 01:17:28,657
- I need to see Wendy Banks,
please.

1168
01:17:28,657 --> 01:17:32,928
- Do you have an appointment,
or...

1169
01:17:32,928 --> 01:17:35,264
You know what,
I'll just go get her.

1170
01:17:57,953 --> 01:18:00,355
Oh, my God.

1171
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:05,660
You did it.
- We did it.

1172
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,696
- Oh, my God.

1173
01:18:07,696 --> 01:18:09,531
- Yeah, they must have
tracking devices

1174
01:18:09,531 --> 01:18:11,166
on all of the failed students.

1175
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:13,468
- Do you know where this is?

1176
01:18:13,468 --> 01:18:15,637
- The coordinates.
Right there.

1177
01:18:15,637 --> 01:18:18,006
- Kellan was right.

1178
01:18:18,006 --> 01:18:19,741
- We have to
get this out tonight.

1179
01:18:21,476 --> 01:18:23,712
- Marvin,
I need two vans and a chopper.

1180
01:18:23,712 --> 01:18:26,147
- They're all booked out.
It's election night.

1181
01:18:26,147 --> 01:18:27,382
- Forget election night!

1182
01:18:27,382 --> 01:18:29,484
I need a chopper!
Now!

1183
01:18:40,128 --> 01:18:42,230
- There's nothing for miles.

1184
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:43,365
Which way are we going?

1185
01:18:43,365 --> 01:18:44,366
To hell!

1186
01:19:08,189 --> 01:19:10,592
This time...

1187
01:19:10,592 --> 01:19:12,794
you'll die for real.

1188
01:19:34,816 --> 01:19:36,584
- I'd hate to be Elaine Davis
right about now.

1189
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:40,155
So I implemented
a few last-minute changes

1190
01:19:40,155 --> 01:19:41,289
to your acceptance speech.
Here you go.

1191
01:19:41,289 --> 01:19:42,357
- Changes?
- Uh, yeah.

1192
01:19:42,357 --> 01:19:43,491
Georgina's team requested that

1193
01:19:43,491 --> 01:19:45,060
we omit your son
from the speech.

1194
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,694
I'm sorry,
she found it too macabre.

1195
01:19:47,729 --> 01:19:48,730
Excuse me.

1196
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:50,465
Carl--Carl, what's up?

1197
01:19:50,465 --> 01:19:52,367
We're about to go on.

1198
01:19:52,367 --> 01:19:55,703
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow--
slow down.

1199
01:19:55,703 --> 01:19:57,338
What?

1200
01:19:59,574 --> 01:20:00,809
I'll call you back.

1201
01:20:02,644 --> 01:20:04,512
<i> - We're getting breaking news,
 folks,</i>

1202
01:20:04,512 --> 01:20:06,714
<i> right here, live, at the BNC.</i>

1203
01:20:06,714 --> 01:20:08,349
<i> Blake Redding is alive.</i>

1204
01:20:08,349 --> 01:20:11,553
<i> I repeat,
 Blake Redding is alive.</i>

1205
01:20:11,553 --> 01:20:12,153
- Blake?

1206
01:20:12,153 --> 01:20:13,621
<i> - We're gonna go live to</i>

1207
01:20:13,621 --> 01:20:15,323
<i> a helicopter
 in the Texas desert</i>

1208
01:20:15,323 --> 01:20:17,592
<i> and you will see
 Blake Redding is there...</i>

1209
01:20:17,592 --> 01:20:19,794
- What is this?
- I--I don't know.

1210
01:20:19,794 --> 01:20:21,629
- This isn't very funny.
What is this?

1211
01:20:21,629 --> 01:20:23,298
- Calm down, sir.

1212
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:25,600
- Somebody tell me
what the fuck is going on!

1213
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,202
<i> - ...and the legitimacy</i>

1214
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:29,204
<i> of the entire
 thinning program.</i>

1215
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:31,473
- Dean.

1216
01:20:31,473 --> 01:20:32,740
Dean?

1217
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:35,710
It's time to make your speech.

1218
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:38,379
Just go out there and
smile for the cameras.

1219
01:20:41,349 --> 01:20:43,818
You're on, Mister President.

1220
01:20:53,628 --> 01:20:55,363
- You guys,
check the fire escape.

1221
01:20:55,363 --> 01:20:56,865
Out there in two,
three minutes, got it?

1222
01:21:22,657 --> 01:21:23,658
- Thank you.

1223
01:21:37,939 --> 01:21:40,175
Hi.

1224
01:21:40,175 --> 01:21:42,177
- Hi.

1225
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,615
- From this moment,

1226
01:21:47,615 --> 01:21:51,219
united, determined,

1227
01:21:51,219 --> 01:21:54,589
we move forward together.

1228
01:21:54,589 --> 01:21:56,724
- I've worked in PR
my entire professional life.

1229
01:21:56,724 --> 01:21:58,259
There is no way
we can spin this.

1230
01:21:58,259 --> 01:21:59,761
- We don't have to.

1231
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:01,296
- Look, I don't mean
to be a downer, here,

1232
01:22:01,296 --> 01:22:04,232
but all of this
is extremely illegal.

1233
01:22:04,232 --> 01:22:06,868
- Not anymore.

1234
01:22:08,803 --> 01:22:10,772
Advanced systems.

1235
01:22:10,772 --> 01:22:13,775
Give me the list of everyone who
has ever opposed the thinning.

1236
01:22:13,775 --> 01:22:16,844
<i> We can't break the law,
 because now</i>

1237
01:22:16,844 --> 01:22:18,880
<i> we are the law.</i>

1238
01:22:59,621 --> 01:23:01,856
- Moving in.
Moving in.

1239
01:23:01,856 --> 01:23:03,424
Blake Redding.

1240
01:23:03,424 --> 01:23:04,759
Laina Michaels.
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

1241
01:23:04,759 --> 01:23:06,427
- Ellie Harper,
you're all under arrest.

1242
01:23:06,427 --> 01:23:08,496
- No, stop, stop!

1243
01:23:21,876 --> 01:23:24,279
- Where are they taking us?

1244
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:28,349
This doesn't add up.

1245
01:23:28,349 --> 01:23:30,585
- Assuru already had access

1246
01:23:30,585 --> 01:23:34,355
to everyone's locations,
cameras, keystrokes.

1247
01:23:35,923 --> 01:23:38,693
They had to go through
the courts to spy on a civilian.

1248
01:23:41,429 --> 01:23:44,565
It'll only take
the wrong person in power

1249
01:23:44,565 --> 01:23:47,368
to end freedom as we know it.

1250
01:23:47,368 --> 01:23:48,703
- We have to stop them.

1251
01:23:50,938 --> 01:23:52,340
- I don't think we can do--

1252
01:24:18,499 --> 01:24:19,967
- Come on.
- Jack?

1253
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:21,869
- We gotta go.

1254
01:24:21,869 --> 01:24:23,104
- Who are you?

1255
01:24:23,104 --> 01:24:24,972
- I'm FBI, come on.

1256
01:24:24,972 --> 01:24:26,107
There we go.

1257
01:24:26,107 --> 01:24:29,010
We gotta go, now.

1258
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:31,346
- Where?

1259
01:24:31,346 --> 01:24:32,780
- We're going to war.

1260
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:44,000
