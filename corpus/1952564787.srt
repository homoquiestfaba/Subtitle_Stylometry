1
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:06,551
<i>Somebody get me a beer,
please.</i>

2
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:08,003
You gonna be my girlfriend!

3
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:09,965
I said...

4
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:11,936
- You gonna be my girlfriend!
- Get off me!

5
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:14,508
Get off me!
You hurting me!

6
00:01:18,982 --> 00:01:20,506
Stop it!

7
00:01:58,823 --> 00:02:00,521
Texas.

8
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:09,757
<i>True love. Two words
I never quite understood.</i>

9
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:13,905
<i>Where was this place in the world
and how could it be found?</i>

10
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,437
<i>Have faith. That's something
I understood even less.</i>

11
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:23,610
<i>Could you change it, or we just blindly
following the natural order of life?</i>

12
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:27,152
<i>When I was a baby,
my mother died in a car crash,</i>

13
00:02:27,153 --> 00:02:29,253
leaving my father and I alone.

14
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:32,348
<i>He never spoke of it, I assumed
that he carried the grief...</i>

15
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:34,449
nightly inside himself.

16
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:38,023
<i>At bedtime, he'd always point out
at the night sky, and said...</i>

17
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:40,491
<i>"there's your moon, Amy",
isn't it beautiful?</i>

18
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,861
<i>That's where your dreams
come from.</i>

19
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:46,862
<i>But, as I grew older,
the words "true love and faith...</i>

20
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:49,264
<i>seams illusive
as my dream.</i>

21
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:53,970
<i>Until one day, they all collided
against my shot to life.</i>

22
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:58,349
<i>And for me,
it all began right about...</i>

23
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:00,547
<i>here.</i>

24
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:04,379
Someone's in trouble.

25
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:05,523
Where?

26
00:03:05,524 --> 00:03:08,324
I just pull over and look
if anyone's inside.

27
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,901
All right.

28
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:22,108
I don't know, man,
I don't see anybody.

29
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:24,800
Well, I'll go check it out.
You stay here.

30
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:43,821
- Holy shit, Earl!
- What?

31
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:45,890
- You gotta see this.
- What is that?

32
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,269
Car-load of shit
everywhere!

33
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:56,872
Yeah, what is it?

34
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:25,116
Viagra I tell you, is the greatest
fucking thing in the world.

35
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:27,088
Yeah, that's if you needed.

36
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:29,088
If you don't need it,
who gives a shit.

37
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:32,332
I'm gonna tell you something, this...
this Viagra is a wonder potion.

38
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:35,265
You have a great big boner
that does the "Deep Down".

39
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:40,703
Hello, Deb.
Two sugars today, yeah.

40
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:44,139
I need some
sweetin' up.

41
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:46,013
Thanks Deb.

42
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:48,948
Hey, speakin' of heart,
take a look over there.

43
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,249
Leave the lady alone, alright?

44
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:56,983
John, you sure
you don't want some of this Viagra?

45
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,392
No, I told you,
that you guys work our asses off.

46
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:04,761
Alright, you guys finish up here. Somebody's
gotta do some work around this town.

47
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:07,230
Yeah, uh...
you'll be working on that.

48
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:18,141
- That's for the sheriffs, uh... coffee.
- You got it.

49
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:20,011
Hi, Sam.

50
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:23,012
Let me take a look at you.

51
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:27,719
Well, you look the same.

52
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:29,447
Thank God.

53
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,551
I saw your news this morning,
what was that all about?

54
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:37,732
Yeah, well, there should never been
any news at all.

55
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,102
I don't how the media
get's a hold of that.

56
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,103
- Mh-hm.
- Hm...

57
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,107
- Well, what a surprise.
- Hm...

58
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:54,177
Oh, I gotta go back to work.
You know, I make my living here.

59
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,742
- Good seeing you.
- Same here, you mind if I walk you out?

60
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:00,883
Yeah, why not?

61
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:07,560
How's the ranch going?

62
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:09,958
Well, we're hanging in there,

63
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,759
gettin' by on the skin of our teeth,
you know.

64
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:16,200
You look great, Sam.

65
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,441
- You too, John.
- Thanks.

66
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,377
How's Amy?

67
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,440
She's nearly a woman now.

68
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,342
I can imagin', yeah.

69
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:29,876
- Long time.
- Yeah, long time.

70
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,083
Well...

71
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:38,323
- See you around.
- See you around.

72
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:42,255
- Keep your other side down.
- Always do.

73
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:44,986
Sweetie, my dear...

74
00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:48,163
I miss you so much.

75
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:54,662
Maybe I'll just join you.

76
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:55,863
Hm?

77
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:01,812
Oh, I could now put this silver bullet
in my own head.

78
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:09,555
Oh...

79
00:11:09,556 --> 00:11:11,724
Oh, I know,
oh, I know.

80
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,204
You think I got parts for all this.

81
00:11:33,213 --> 00:11:35,005
Look at the work, mister.

82
00:11:35,716 --> 00:11:38,946
Guys, you know what I hate,
I hate my job.

83
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:43,088
- Hard day at the offfice?
- Ah, samo, samo. Give me a cigarette.

84
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:44,189
Sure.

85
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:47,193
Walla.

86
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:49,295
Never loose it, sister.

87
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:54,634
Hey...

88
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:56,396
Honey alert!

89
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:02,934
I dare you,
to go make contact.

90
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:06,175
- I'm okay.
- Come on.

91
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,874
- Just do it, don't be scared.
- I don't want to, I'm not scared, I just...

92
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:13,144
I'm a little more selective
then you guys.

93
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:16,551
- So selective, you haven't been laid yet.
- Yeah.

94
00:12:16,757 --> 00:12:18,247
So?

95
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:20,927
Come on,
chicken-shit.

96
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:23,495
- Just do it. Come on, little lady.
- Do it, do it.

97
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,723
- Come on... Go.
- Go! Come on, go!

98
00:12:35,377 --> 00:12:37,238
I just talked to him
the other day.

99
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,607
Can Amy pick up an ass-hole...

100
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:41,908
- you think?
- I don't think so.

101
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:44,108
Hey.

102
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:47,479
Can I help you with sometin'?

103
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:51,048
Hey, you live here.
Right?

104
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:53,894
Yeah, I know.

105
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:13,940
I saw you driving that little car
the other day. Is that yours?

106
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:14,941
Yep.

107
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:21,887
Hey!
What you think you're doing?

108
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:24,357
Smoking.

109
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,057
Yeah, you can't smoke here.

110
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:29,030
Oh, I'm sorry,
sorry.

111
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:37,037
That's a beautiful car.

112
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:39,840
What is it?

113
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:42,812
It's a 68 AMX.

114
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:45,943
- Do you do all the work on this...
- Look, kid...

115
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,143
if I sit here and talk you,
I never would get any work done.

116
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:52,845
So, why don't go
play somewhere else.

117
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:56,120
See you around.

118
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:59,422
Whatever.

119
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:09,331
See you guys later,
I'm gonna go home.

120
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:20,277
Jesus Christ, mother...

121
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,427
Would you like to ride?

122
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:41,134
- Not today
- Come on?

123
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:42,863
Look, I'm sorry.

124
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:50,441
- It's windy out.
- I like the wind.

125
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,754
Look, I'm sorry about that earlier.

126
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:09,765
I only been working here a week, kid,
the boss is kind of brick.

127
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:11,882
I guess there's a lotta
bricks in that shop.

128
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:14,236
Yeah, I guess so.

129
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:19,102
Wait here for one second.

130
00:15:32,893 --> 00:15:34,100
I'm sorry.

131
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:37,720
It's a fucking cactus!

132
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:41,100
Well, use your imagination.
It could be a flower.

133
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:42,101
Okay.

134
00:15:44,638 --> 00:15:45,634
I'm Amy.

135
00:15:47,874 --> 00:15:50,320
- Dan.
- Nice to meet you.

136
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:53,269
Nice to meet you too.

137
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:12,794
I had that thing purring
like a chick in an hour.

138
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,046
I swear to God, the old mans' jaw,
about hit the ground.

139
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:18,776
That's why
you got the job, huh?

140
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:21,036
Yep.

141
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:27,498
So...

142
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,215
So...

143
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:36,593
Will I see you again?

144
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:40,371
I don't know. Maybe.

145
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:45,094
My dad's real protective.

146
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:51,186
Well, I can live with maybe.

147
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:56,862
Why don't you drop
by the shop sometime?

148
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:59,630
I promise
I won't be such a brick.

149
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:02,319
Alright.
As long as you promise.

150
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:05,984
- Thank you.
- Any time.

151
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:11,585
Oh...

152
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:14,453
Don't forget your flowers.

153
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:16,293
I don't wanna forget that.

154
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:18,925
Bye.

155
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:56,222
Jack on the rocks.

156
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:04,014
You live around here?

157
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:07,363
No, man, I'm just visiting.
I'm fom L.A.

158
00:18:07,364 --> 00:18:08,264
You?

159
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,091
Heading towards Nevada.

160
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:13,624
Just slummin' a little.

161
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:15,660
Drink pioson...

162
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:20,521
take a look at some titties,
and see what bites.

163
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:24,239
Nevada,
titties and ass bites.

164
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,474
Yeah, I remember back

165
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:30,693
Hey, gorgeous.

00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:34,707
I been watching you
all night...

167
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,718
What's your sign?

168
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:43,220
Stop, that's my sign.

169
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,450
Oh, come on...

170
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,921
You don't believe in astrologie?
What's your rising sign?

171
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,114
I don't know.

172
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,026
I think it's stupid.

173
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,412
Can I see your hand?

174
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,488
You know what that says?

175
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,370
Rosie Palmer.

176
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,524
You're a fucking ass-hole!

177
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,137
Wasn't that sometin'?

178
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,824
Well, you take it easy now, Rosie.

179
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,519
- Have a good night.
- Likewise.

180
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,831
- Bartender.
- One second, be right with you.

181
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:23,903
What can I do for you?

182
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,340
Gimlet for one of your fancy girls.

183
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,688
The girl over by the pool table.

184
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:30,434
<i>Do you want it
sweet or dry,</i>

185
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,098
<i>- ripe or fruity?
- Fruity.</i>

186
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,616
You got it, buddy.

187
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,560
<i>- You see that guy over there?
- I don't know him.</i>

188
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,047
<i>He just bought you a drink.</i>

189
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:48,148
<i>Who got next game?</i>

190
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:04,604
Hey...

191
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,869
So... how'd you know
what I like?

192
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:18,274
I be damned! I know a lot more,
we're going out tonight.

193
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,559
Besides...

194
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:24,760
you looked like you needed rescuing
from those beers uptown.

195
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:26,161
"Wankers only".

196
00:21:28,657 --> 00:21:31,423
- I like a girl with experience.
- I'm not a hooker.

197
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:34,918
- Not here.
- Let's go in my truck outside, alright?

198
00:22:28,018 --> 00:22:32,161
- Let me see your ass!
- You sure are a wild one!

199
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,159
Get outta the truck!
you ass-hole!

200
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,927
Come here you fuck
you here to fuck us up!

201
00:22:37,928 --> 00:22:39,914
Stop! No! Stop it!

202
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,487
Get the fuck back in the truck,
you old whore!

203
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:47,056
Yeah!
You like that?

204
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,972
You want more, huh?

205
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:54,073
Stay the fuck
right there!

206
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:01,321
No...

207
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:11,754
See that, huh?

208
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:14,730
This is your boyfriend!

209
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:21,106
Hey!

210
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:23,963
Give me the shovel, ass-hole!
I asked you for the fucking shovel.

211
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:20,166
Hey...

212
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,644
Keep the fuck away.

213
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:25,565
I'm busy right here.

214
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,994
There's so many rich people
they're just out there...

215
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:47,352
waiting for the perfect
Miss Fabulous to come along.

216
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:49,894
They're coming here lining up,
and all I have to say is please.

217
00:24:49,897 --> 00:24:50,847
Give me a break.

218
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:54,250
Okay, fine. Then I'll just take 'em off
until they're 3 inches longer.

219
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:55,251
You would.

220
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:00,621
Quit your smoking.

221
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:08,051
Hey, ladies.

222
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:12,130
You wouldn't happen to be
Johns daughter?

223
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:13,881
Hm?
Would you?

224
00:25:14,957 --> 00:25:16,057
Yeah, I am.

225
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:18,839
I... I was just...
I was in the neighborhood,

226
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,040
and thought I stop by.

227
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:21,308
Is your dad around?

228
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,744
He actually just left,
but he'll be right back.

229
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:24,745
Hm...

230
00:25:25,634 --> 00:25:27,523
Is there anything
I can do for you, sheriff?

231
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,685
Um... no,
no, just, um...

232
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:33,470
just... tell him
I... I stopped by, okay?

233
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:34,671
Who do I tell him?

234
00:25:34,776 --> 00:25:37,842
Sam's the name.
Your father and I...

235
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,819
Yeah, my dad,
he...

236
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:42,961
- he told me about you.
- Oh, good.

237
00:25:42,996 --> 00:25:44,465
Good things,
I would think.

238
00:25:44,553 --> 00:25:45,497
Good.

239
00:25:46,656 --> 00:25:49,227
Good, um...
I tell you what, just...

240
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:51,527
- tell him that I was here.
- Sure thing.

241
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:55,710
Been great to...
to be hanging out, do nothing.

242
00:25:55,907 --> 00:25:57,710
Sure be nice,
to see you again.

243
00:25:57,711 --> 00:25:59,701
- You too.
- Okay... bye you all.

244
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:01,056
Bye.

245
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:28,433
Where are you?

246
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,161
Oh, here you are.

247
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:38,998
- Hi.
- Hi-ah.

248
00:26:39,476 --> 00:26:40,510
- Hey.
- Hi.

249
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:42,850
Come on, come on.

250
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:44,715
Hey...

251
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:46,019
How are you?

252
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:47,267
Thank you.

253
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:48,568
Thank you.

254
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,189
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

255
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,390
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

256
00:27:44,243 --> 00:27:45,869
Why walk,
when you can ride?

257
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,431
Uh... I'm alright,
thank you, though.

258
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:53,722
I wouldn't feel right, if I was gonna
let you walk over there all by yourself.

259
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:59,994
Relax. I know your dad,
big John over at the ranch.

260
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:01,728
He wouldn't want me
to leave you here.

261
00:28:02,762 --> 00:28:03,697
You know my dad?

262
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:06,056
Yeah.

263
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:09,451
Alright.

264
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:12,096
Get in the car.

265
00:28:16,476 --> 00:28:18,043
It is kind of cold.

266
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:41,286
- Where we going?
- Rustig aan. This will just take a second.

267
00:28:41,368 --> 00:28:42,566
I wanna go home now.

268
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,476
We have to have
some fun first.

269
00:28:44,477 --> 00:28:45,777
Fuckin' bitch.

270
00:28:46,306 --> 00:28:47,548
- Get off me!
- Yeah.

271
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:49,097
Fuckin' bitch!

272
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:54,736
- Get off me!
- Yeah, you fucking like that?

273
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,755
Help me!

274
00:28:58,586 --> 00:28:59,732
Get outta the car!

275
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:03,203
- Chicken-shit!
- Where the fuck did you come for?

276
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:12,789
You brick.
Stay away from her.

277
00:29:20,141 --> 00:29:21,328
Amy, let's go.

278
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,126
Are you okay?

279
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:39,410
It's alright.

280
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:25,956
- Are you okay?
- Mh-hm.

281
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:27,688
Yeah.

282
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:31,567
- Are you?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

283
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,008
Where are you from originally?

284
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:42,493
Well...

285
00:30:43,294 --> 00:30:44,717
I moved around a lot.

286
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:46,910
Guess you could say,
I am from...

287
00:30:48,532 --> 00:30:49,917
everywhere and anywhere.

288
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,180
So, what you doing
out here tonight?

289
00:30:58,642 --> 00:31:00,778
I don't wanna freak you out,
but...

290
00:31:03,814 --> 00:31:06,416
I've been following you
ever since the first day we met.

291
00:31:08,486 --> 00:31:09,962
So, you're a stalker?

292
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:13,088
No, it's nothin' like that.

293
00:31:15,827 --> 00:31:17,398
You seam different.

294
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:21,099
Sorta like the outsider like me.

295
00:31:27,072 --> 00:31:28,744
I'm really glad,
you were there tonight.

296
00:31:29,941 --> 00:31:33,221
That guy told me he's...
friends with my dad.

297
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:40,392
This... certainly never happened
to me before.

298
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,791
It's okay.

299
00:32:00,273 --> 00:32:01,577
Did you have a good night?

300
00:32:02,108 --> 00:32:04,825
Hey, dad.
Yeah, it was fun.

301
00:32:05,578 --> 00:32:07,059
You didn't have to wait for up,
though.

302
00:32:07,914 --> 00:32:09,241
Evidently I do.

303
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:11,509
Who drove you home?

304
00:32:12,418 --> 00:32:13,413
Just a friend.

305
00:32:14,153 --> 00:32:15,188
A friend?

306
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:19,993
He's no friend, Amy.

307
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:22,944
It's not like that, dad.

308
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:28,665
I'm going to sleep.

309
00:32:31,104 --> 00:32:32,040
Good night, dad.

310
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:35,806
- Don't give me that face.
- Good night, dad.

311
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:37,427
Good night.

312
00:32:39,746 --> 00:32:41,147
Son of a bitch!

313
00:33:34,235 --> 00:33:35,589
What you doing out here, Sam?

314
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:40,123
- Oh, you think you're fast, huh?
- But I believe, the slowest got it.

315
00:33:40,943 --> 00:33:42,308
You should?

316
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,650
- Look at that slicin' moon up there, girl.
- It's magical.

317
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,018
I like it out here.

318
00:34:38,068 --> 00:34:39,490
Jesus Christ!

319
00:34:39,936 --> 00:34:40,884
My God!

320
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:42,789
What's wrong?

321
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,804
Amy! Over here!

322
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,402
I love you!

323
00:35:15,606 --> 00:35:17,627
Oh, my God!

324
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,359
- Amy, you gotta come in!
- You're crazy.

325
00:35:27,685 --> 00:35:29,185
- You'll enjoy it.
- You're crazy.

326
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,355
- What you waiting for, let's go.
- Is it cold?

327
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:32,756
- Huh?
- Is it cold?

328
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,431
- Come on, take your clothes off.
- No...

329
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,032
Come and join me.
It's great!

330
00:36:26,112 --> 00:36:27,514
It isn't cold.

331
00:36:29,048 --> 00:36:30,260
Go ahead!

332
00:36:32,585 --> 00:36:33,879
Watch your step.

333
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:45,751
The water is cold!

334
00:37:05,753 --> 00:37:07,049
I got an idea.

335
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:15,838
What are you doing?

336
00:37:18,232 --> 00:37:21,647
I'm lettin' you take the wheel.
Come on, slide over!

337
00:37:30,512 --> 00:37:33,604
You shift her in first,
it's a four speed and let it go.

338
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,063
I know how to drive, Mario.

339
00:37:35,116 --> 00:37:37,117
Let me just see
if you got that.

340
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:39,411
- You got your seat-belt on?
- I'm no dummy.

341
00:37:40,722 --> 00:37:42,314
Are you ready?

342
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:45,472
- If you go a little faster, it's fine.
- Oooh...

343
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:46,973
Okay.

344
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:52,550
- Not bad for a rookie.
- Wanna see what this car can do?

345
00:37:52,634 --> 00:37:54,926
Oh, I know
what this car can do, trust me.

346
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:05,684
<i>I didn't realize it at the time
that this small thing...</i>

347
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:07,985
<i>the memoires I was collectin'
would sustain me...</i>

348
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,524
<i>now I carry them with me forever.</i>

349
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:26,868
<i>No, it's not out there yet...</i>

350
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:30,274
Dear, I know you like this,
but this sure gives me the creeps.

351
00:38:31,707 --> 00:38:33,972
Then why come back to that
anyway, Linda?

352
00:38:33,973 --> 00:38:35,373
Oh, it's nothing.

353
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,503
Look, Floyd!
Oh... oh... oh...

354
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:18,131
Go get him, Norman!

355
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,666
You son of a bitch!

356
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:02,412
You mother-fucker!

357
00:41:12,906 --> 00:41:15,655
Shit! What a crazy fuck!
I'm gonna kill the fucker!

358
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:17,573
Get your ass back here,
I'll kill you!

359
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:12,490
Why?
Why me?

360
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:13,491
Why!

361
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:15,327
What did I do?

362
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:23,986
Why?

363
00:42:42,598 --> 00:42:44,831
Hey, what in the world
happened to you?

364
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:47,708
Got the motor runnin' here,

365
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:49,609
get in the truck
and I'll take you to town.

366
00:43:01,485 --> 00:43:05,132
- It's about fucking time, Sam.
- What is going on, Louie?

367
00:43:05,188 --> 00:43:06,968
Well, I was hopin'
you could tell me.

368
00:43:07,691 --> 00:43:09,577
- Come here.
- Let's see.

369
00:43:14,998 --> 00:43:16,482
Fuckin' pretty, ain't it?

370
00:43:22,406 --> 00:43:26,258
It's some bad shit, I tell you!
Mother-fuckers are pissin' me off!

371
00:43:33,451 --> 00:43:35,787
- Come over here.
- Louie, I'm coming.

372
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,214
- Come on, over here.
- Coming, Louie.

373
00:43:41,392 --> 00:43:42,729
Take a look at this shit!

374
00:43:45,096 --> 00:43:46,937
- God.
- Yeah.

375
00:43:47,398 --> 00:43:50,102
I took a shot at the mother-fucker!
I don't know if I hit anything.

376
00:43:50,168 --> 00:43:51,367
To fuckin' dark.

377
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:56,406
I don't know what the fuck's over here?
But... that's a dog lying here.

378
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:58,070
The other half is in there.

379
00:44:09,321 --> 00:44:11,848
What I wanna know is what the fuck
you gonna do about this Sam!

380
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:14,081
Goddamn it, I don't need anymore
of your crap Louie!

381
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:16,492
I'm sick and tired
of your bull-shit.

382
00:44:18,297 --> 00:44:21,455
Go down to my truck
and bring me my camera...

383
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:25,486
It's on the seat,
I... need to take picture.

384
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:29,451
I swear to God, I'm getting
sick and tired of this shit!

385
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,653
The best fucking dog I ever had!

386
00:44:31,654 --> 00:44:34,154
Some mother-fucker's gonna die,
behind this shit, I tell you!

387
00:44:34,155 --> 00:44:37,055
As soon as I can get,
this mother-fucker.

388
00:45:15,689 --> 00:45:17,641
I waited for hours last night.

389
00:45:19,126 --> 00:45:20,211
Where were you?

390
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,727
Hell, Amy.

391
00:45:25,528 --> 00:45:27,628
I was in hell.

392
00:45:57,732 --> 00:45:59,331
Those will kill you,
you know?

393
00:46:00,368 --> 00:46:04,494
Is this a fucking joke?
This it least a choice.

394
00:46:10,412 --> 00:46:11,587
What is it, Dan?

395
00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:16,309
You know you can tell me
anything, right?

396
00:46:19,888 --> 00:46:21,258
Anything Amy?

397
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:22,790
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

398
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:25,846
Anything? What makes you
sure with everything?

399
00:46:26,362 --> 00:46:27,662
Huh?

400
00:46:28,063 --> 00:46:29,555
What makes you so sure?

401
00:46:34,637 --> 00:46:36,236
Because I'm in love with you.

402
00:46:48,784 --> 00:46:49,827
Okay.

403
00:46:52,188 --> 00:46:53,095
Okay!

404
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:56,039
I've become the wolf, Amy.

405
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,831
I know you are.

406
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:02,239
Listen to me!
I'm a fucking werewolf!

407
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:07,736
Those slayings at the farm?
That was me.

408
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:12,754
Well, what are you saying?

409
00:47:14,044 --> 00:47:15,332
It's true, Amy.

410
00:47:18,615 --> 00:47:20,035
It's real.

411
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,020
Remember
what you promised me...

412
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,508
I scream,
you drive away.

413
00:48:02,994 --> 00:48:04,923
You never told me about
when you were a kid.

414
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,693
It's not much to tell...

415
00:48:08,966 --> 00:48:10,110
I don't remember much.

416
00:48:20,979 --> 00:48:23,582
Sometime I...
see my mother...

417
00:48:25,017 --> 00:48:28,098
she's running through a forest,
with somethin' chasing her.

418
00:48:30,189 --> 00:48:33,293
I think it's me, but...
I never quite remember.

419
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:38,999
I have this memory,
this vision of her...

420
00:48:39,865 --> 00:48:42,333
holding me.
which is just so real.

421
00:48:44,536 --> 00:48:48,275
When I reach out to touch her,
she just fades away.

422
00:48:53,912 --> 00:48:55,065
And your father?

423
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:58,785
Yeah...

424
00:49:00,386 --> 00:49:01,832
good old dad.

425
00:49:02,555 --> 00:49:04,362
I never even knew my father.

426
00:49:09,963 --> 00:49:12,764
Amy, it's happenin'!
Get outta here!

427
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,032
- Are you okay?
- Amy, go!

428
00:53:37,337 --> 00:53:39,026
Goddamn it, Amy.

429
00:53:39,873 --> 00:53:41,328
<i>There's this kid...</i>

430
00:53:41,841 --> 00:53:42,879
a drifter...

431
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:45,606
he seams to be hangin' around Amy
and I thought...

432
00:53:46,379 --> 00:53:48,760
Wait a minute, you're talking about
the kid at the auto-shop?

433
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:52,061
- Nice car he's got.
- Oh, come on, Sam.

434
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,462
There's somthin' creepy about him.
He's... he's strange.

435
00:53:55,489 --> 00:53:56,968
I don't want him
anywhere near Amy.

436
00:53:58,492 --> 00:54:00,589
Okay, lets...
lets get this straight.

437
00:54:01,795 --> 00:54:05,331
You want me to maybe arrest him,
because your daughter like him?

438
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,835
No, well I thought...

439
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:14,618
you know, you could... scare him off.
Or shoot him or hang him.

440
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:18,130
Well I... I don't kow
if I can do that, John.

441
00:54:19,413 --> 00:54:20,961
He ain't broken any laws.

442
00:54:21,082 --> 00:54:24,702
Oh, Jesus Christ, Sam!
Come on, that's ridicules!

443
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,206
I don't want that son of a bitch
around my daughter.

444
00:54:27,422 --> 00:54:29,450
I mean, do I have to beg you
to do someting?

445
00:54:30,325 --> 00:54:31,272
Funny...

446
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,220
that's exatly how my dad...

447
00:54:36,598 --> 00:54:40,559
God rest his soul,
felt about us back then.

448
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,157
Didn't make a bid of differnce,
did it?

449
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,874
Okay, I get it laud and clear,
but I'm telling you, he's trouble.

450
00:54:48,977 --> 00:54:52,315
I mean please, could you just...
just check him out?

451
00:54:58,854 --> 00:55:01,131
Why is it people
who have never raised kids...

452
00:55:01,557 --> 00:55:03,781
always have an opinion
of how it should done?

453
00:55:03,793 --> 00:55:05,781
Stop! Woa, wait... wait a minute,
you... you're right,

454
00:55:05,782 --> 00:55:08,230
I... I have no experience
raising kids.

455
00:55:08,231 --> 00:55:11,533
I'm not giving you any advise,
on how to do any of if.

456
00:55:11,734 --> 00:55:15,276
I'm not speaking as a parent,
I am speaking as a law-man.

457
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:21,956
As a law-man I'm telling you,
Amy needs to learn a few things on her own.

458
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,394
Come on, Sam.

459
00:55:25,514 --> 00:55:27,993
- Come on.
- I see what I can do.

460
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:30,515
Thanks.

461
00:55:50,807 --> 00:55:52,113
You sure about this?

462
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,006
It costs you dollar.

463
00:55:59,116 --> 00:56:01,888
- I got it.
- He's the man. He's got the money.

464
00:56:07,524 --> 00:56:08,481
Thank you.

465
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:15,065
Okay...

466
00:56:15,066 --> 00:56:16,219
let's begin.

467
00:56:19,337 --> 00:56:22,986
We were wondering if you...
knew anything about, um...

468
00:56:25,043 --> 00:56:27,020
people that
change in their life?

469
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:28,021
Hm...

470
00:56:28,446 --> 00:56:29,746
Things that are...

471
00:56:30,815 --> 00:56:32,818
kind of crazy
and unimaginable.

472
00:56:32,819 --> 00:56:33,819
Hm.

473
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:41,098
Like, uh...

474
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:43,107
Like vampires?

475
00:56:45,029 --> 00:56:46,032
Gablets?

476
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:50,408
Werewolves?

477
00:56:51,403 --> 00:56:52,568
The werewolves?

478
00:56:57,009 --> 00:56:59,007
Sometimes called
"Skin-shifters".

479
00:56:59,578 --> 00:57:00,824
"Windigowak".

480
00:57:02,314 --> 00:57:03,348
"Glabligouk".

481
00:57:11,657 --> 00:57:14,322
The things our minds can conject
can be very real.

482
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:24,268
The problem we're talking about,
is yours, isn't it?

483
00:57:28,007 --> 00:57:28,961
Yes.

484
00:57:31,177 --> 00:57:32,549
Give me hand.

485
00:57:35,148 --> 00:57:36,695
Close your eyes.

486
00:57:38,551 --> 00:57:40,550
Take a deep breath and focus.

487
00:58:09,116 --> 00:58:11,701
You are...
you are c... cursed.

488
00:58:13,888 --> 00:58:15,308
You one of them...

489
00:58:17,525 --> 00:58:18,497
Exuse me...

490
00:58:19,927 --> 00:58:20,948
Exuse me...

491
00:58:22,363 --> 00:58:24,120
Mother in haven!
Mother in haven...

492
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:26,297
Mother in haven...

493
00:58:33,073 --> 00:58:34,133
What's that?

494
00:58:35,342 --> 00:58:38,412
This will...
this will protect you from...

495
00:58:39,381 --> 00:58:40,344
From me?

496
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:43,597
No.
From the curse...

497
00:58:45,153 --> 00:58:46,441
and its origin.

498
00:58:47,789 --> 00:58:50,868
- How did this happen?
- This was...

499
00:58:53,695 --> 00:58:57,246
It started...
with your father.

500
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:02,094
- My father?
- And was passed on to you.

501
00:59:02,104 --> 00:59:05,718
I don't even know who my father is,
not alone know, if he's even alive.

502
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:06,630
Oh, he's alive...

503
00:59:08,176 --> 00:59:09,325
I can feel him...

504
00:59:13,014 --> 00:59:14,862
Okay, what do you do,
when you have problem?

505
00:59:16,285 --> 00:59:17,214
What do mean?

506
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:24,034
If... if he didn't exist,
the curse would not be upon you.

507
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:28,192
You see this werewolf?
Right here?

508
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,966
He got cursed
to a sorcery.

509
00:59:32,668 --> 00:59:37,171
His was the first...
the first hated blood.

510
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,034
That's your daddy...

511
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:44,398
he brought this down on you...

512
00:59:45,414 --> 00:59:49,095
Your are his descendent.
You are his beta.

513
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:53,051
Is there any... hope?

514
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:55,451
Can we...

515
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:02,810
I think there still is hope, because
you have not tasted the human blood.

516
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:06,003
But, look at me.
Look at me!

517
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,443
Once you have it,
your soul...

518
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:15,589
your soul...

519
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:23,150
Not from being within you,
except become... that what you already are.

520
01:00:23,487 --> 01:00:25,685
How do you know
I haven't killed a human?

521
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,792
Because I feel it.
Because I...

522
01:00:27,892 --> 01:00:30,279
I know... I...
I feel it.

523
01:00:31,196 --> 01:00:33,239
No lies in your eyes...

524
01:00:34,098 --> 01:00:37,935
You're... you're... you're save with him.
You're save with him.

525
01:00:40,038 --> 01:00:41,530
So, it's okay?

526
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:44,435
It's your father...

527
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:50,043
He cherishes the curse...

528
01:00:50,782 --> 01:00:54,850
and he can kill... anytime,
anywhere, that he wants.

529
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:58,898
And retain human intelligent...

530
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:03,017
clear knowledge
and mind of his acts.

531
01:01:09,034 --> 01:01:13,647
He's more dangerous...
then you'll ever know.

532
01:01:14,573 --> 01:01:16,732
Is there anything
I can do about this?

533
01:01:22,081 --> 01:01:23,235
My guees is...

534
01:01:26,785 --> 01:01:28,634
you gotta kill your daddy.

535
01:01:35,227 --> 01:01:36,443
Good bye.

536
01:01:37,029 --> 01:01:39,136
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

537
01:01:39,198 --> 01:01:40,588
Please don't let out the kiddy.

538
01:01:42,435 --> 01:01:43,470
Thank you.

539
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:53,657
When everything else fails,
you've got your instincts.

540
01:01:57,384 --> 01:02:00,002
It sounds
really, really weird...

541
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,121
what's going on around guys,
I don't know, at this moment.

542
01:02:05,912 --> 01:02:07,397
My instincts are screaming.
