Ithier vain illusions. Not even
Thi has not made sexual advances.

00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,960
- I do not wear it!
- I understand. I'm serious! I know how it is

48
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,730
People like him
would be allowed to transact orally.

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,950
You're a moron!

50
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,100
You put on your seat, trying to stay calm

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,700

- Super!
- A small resort apropiaþi.

59
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,830
You can not do this every morning.
It is downright ordinary.

60
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,280
Come zâmbiþi!

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,521
Only until they reach age 18 and older.

62
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,550
- A gift.

63
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,840

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,200
Periuþa teeth that wash Ithier

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,910
Like brushing my teeth.

But we need to correct certain documents.
We can help you Luke?

68
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,200
After yesterday, you probably have remained
unemployed. He and so ...

69
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,510
You think I exaggerate
when I told him that a cow?

70
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,400
I think I'm happy to head
This frank exchange of opinions.

71
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,400

- When?

72
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Yesterday, on his birthday.

73
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,660
Yes, I sent a bouquet of roses
and a map made by my mânuþa.

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,280
And I finished the sewing

75
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,450
You're impossible.

76
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,850
You've seen what we've received this year
my birthday? I get a grunt.

77
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,760
My mother said: "In many years, baby!"
and my father ...

78
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,930
It was the happiest moment of my life.
They gave me tears, nothing else.

79
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,000
Have you ever thought that someone should
to be more mature in such situations?

80
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,860
I want to tell you that memory
the custody hearing.

84
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,450
And now, you give up.

Are you ready?
They line up.

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,130
Now they are aligned.
You tell me when you start.

87
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,160
Give it up!

88
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,550
Open it!

89
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,590

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
You can sleep here

107
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,920
as long as you stay on your side of the bed.
We understood?

108
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,800
And mecherule!

109
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,300
I do not know why I always fooled.

110
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,000
Or maybe, I pretend I do not know.

111
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,880
Hey!

112
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,696

Build your own castle?

133

What's this?
A castle gate?

134
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,100
I was afraid to go to school?

135
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,110
No. I went to class, and not embraced
and even turned his head to greet me.

136
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,600
Look at his friends!

137
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,900

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,420
- When you how was your first day?
- Super!

139
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,180
Half of the class

- About the call?

144
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,850
Yes, but do not say anything.
Bring Thi remember what Meyer says.

145
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,530
- Do not ...
- It could take several months

146
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,160
until a court decides.

147
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,200
I saw this woman. He was there.
He had to disappear and how, suddenly.

148
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,400
- Meyer will find another investigator.
- And the clothes in my bag agatha.

149
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,480
I heard that I skipped a button
to be blind not to find it.

150
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,800
We re-evaluate all the evidence.

151
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,330
It's great!
Because we are not yet faliþi.

152
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,950
- We can cope.
- Minds all the time.

153
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,030

154
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,040

- Yes.

169
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's a little crazy about that girl you?

170
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,750
Have to go, Carrie!

171
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,800
No!

172
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,900
Read what you write there.
We must make a decision ...

173
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,600
What happens if they find
Women who left the parking lot?

174
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,550
Appeal was dismissed.

175
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,050
- We can not present other evidence.
- It was a holdup!

176
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,760
And if I use a credit card
we can say that.

177
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,900
Sorry.

178
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,150
It's crazy!

179
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,950
All Rights Reserved.
So we have no choice.

180
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,750
All you can do is call
Supreme Court, and you?

181
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,100
John, over the past 30 years, the Supreme Court
has not even solved a murder case.

182
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,400
No decent lawyer
not one to call.

183
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,650
Thus, A and all I have to do
ask a lawyer "indecent."

184
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,480
It would be very difficult to find.

185
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll handle this.

186
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,450
- But I want to do something for me and you.
- What?

187
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,100
I want to analyze samples,
but remember that your wife Lara.

188
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,500
We have seen evidence, Meyer.

189
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:33,510
Thi not to judge the criminals
or innocent, but to analyze the samples.

190
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,311
An officer saw her
when he left the scene,

191
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,500
victim had blood on his clothes
and fingerprints on murder weapon ...

192
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,200
I took it out for dinner in town!

193
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,600
How could you do
after killing someone?

194
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,290
- Must be a psychopath!
- And the fight ...

195
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,550
- Lara is not psycho!
- Fight in the office?

196
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,560
- Everyone is and fight with their heads!
- But that ended with a crime.

197
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,350
There and then, you say you do not think
I never that innocent?

198
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,850
- How can you say something like that?
- What do you mean?

199
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:03,370
I want to say that no matter what we believe
Lara was a child to escape from the cavity!

200
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,500
You do not know how I hate to say it.

201
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,450
You will find someone else
for appeal.

202
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,350
John. John!
Be serious! John!

203
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,700
John!
For the love of God!

204
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,300
Come.
See for Scouting.

205
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:37,050
Let's hug eZi Peng
Micuþul Peng,

206
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:42,080
Kiki and Opossumy.
With lots and lots of love, Mom.

207
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,160
You do not want to write about us?

208
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,700
- I have 25 cents?
- To give you 25 cents?

209
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,700
Yes, but you allowed them to spend it all.

210
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,200
Where is the remote that me and mom
We pick you up when you were a baby and you.

211
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,000
- Can I take them all?
- Sure.

212
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,780
My wife, Lara Brennan
was sent here.

213
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,290
B-R-E-N-N-A-N. You have to see!

214
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,500
- Sorry!
- Lara! Lara!

215
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,850
You can not go there!

216
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,050
- No you do here!
- Turn it up! Come back!

217
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,090
- What do you do, sir?
- Lara!

218
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,150
- Come here!
- Lara!

219
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,880
- Sir!
- But what is happening here?

220
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,400
My wife tried to commit suicide!
He was brought here. You have to see, please!

221
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,480
- It is allowed to receive visitors.
- Why the Emergency Room?

222
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,990
- He was transferred to the prison.
- Only two minutes, please!

223
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,550
Two minutes.

224
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,650
Well.

225
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,150
Thank you.

226
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,300
Two minutes.

227
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,304
"Life and Adventures of Don Quixote."

228
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,100
What's this?

229
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,600
About the fact that faith in the virtue
But it is more important than virtue?

230
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,450
Yes, it says in the book.

231
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,600
But what is it?

232
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:06,390
It could be about
Ithier soul-destroying rational thought.

233
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,100
Or the triumph iraþionalitãþii
and the power that lies within her.

234
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,450
We lose a lot of time
try to organize the world.

235
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,930
Manufacturing by clocks, calendars,
weather forecasting.

236
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,720
What part of our lives
is really under our control?

237
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,300
What happens if we choose to run
facing the reality that surrounds us?

238
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,760
Prisons GUIDE

239
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,300
It would be a total madness.

240
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,150
What would be probably better
a life full of hopelessness.

241
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,220
BEYOND THE WALLS
Damon Pennington

242
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,300
This is a course they need people
than to be free, regardless of cost.

243
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,050
For another teacher
i was put on the spot "Butterfly".

244
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,150
Listen, you've missed
seven times in prison.

245
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,300
And what do you want to know?

246
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,000
How have you managed to escape when
does anyone else managed this?

247
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,450
I took courage and a little luck.

248
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,400
All prisons in the world
"Weaknesses".

249
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,200
Everyone has a key.
You only have one finds you.

250
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,200
How did you do?

251
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,000
I looked closely. Especially when things
who were not part of daily routine.

252
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,550
The guards are common Nuith
and doing these things every day.

253
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,700
And they make mistakes, what happens.
When you see this, you must be prepared.

254
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,700
You need to have everything well prepared plan
even before you decide to escape.

255
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,250
Escape is a breeze,
the hardest part is to remain free.

256
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,020
You need to know where to go
and how.

257
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,950
Need to know when they plan
to take, how and where.

258
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,850
- How on earth can you find these things?
- You pay someone who knows.

259
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,750
And if the prison is very important
is in the province or city.

260
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,100
He is in town.

261
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,950
- How are you?
- From Pittsburgh.

262
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,750
Pittsburgh is a city difficult,

263
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,450
with many bridges and tunnels
which can be easily blocked.

264
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,310
Once they received a call

265
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,920
Police may close the downtown
and to isolate it completely in 15 minutes.

266
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,700
How can I be so for exacþi?

267
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,950
In the wake of 9 / 11
Homeland Security has decided that each city

268
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,600
to have a safety plan:

269
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,400
downtown Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston,
Minneapolis to close in 15 minutes.

270
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,850
They can become "dead zones"
within 10 minutes.

271
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,650
And 35 minutes each border point
between states will be guarded by police

272
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,460
and all secondary roads will be closed.

273
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,970
If you do not take a picture with you,
Your description will be detailed.

274
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,250
- And if I do not fit in 30 minutes?
- Then, you teach.

275
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,560
Because the site will draw on
you and those who are with you.

276
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,330
Stay away from stations
and bus stations.

277
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,450
Look for local airports.
Escape to another state.

278
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,400
The second thing: identity.
It is easy to obtain false documents,

279
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,110
but it is difficult to obtain documents
you can pass control of the airport.

280
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,900
Need a passport book
management and social insurance.

281
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,200
If you rent a car
Find a place where you can pay in cash.

282
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,400
Will check the books of credit and thus,
for acts uses a real name.

283
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
The third thing: the destination.

284
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,180
You must go to a place
not attract American tourists.

285
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,800
Remember to Yemen
and I know what I mean.

286
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,900
Second, money.
You need a truck of money.

287
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,600
All hotels are expensive,
travel information.

288
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,130
For how much money do I need?

289
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,550
Both come to tell you how
at least five or six years.

290
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,970
If you're short of money, short of friends.

291
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,350
But before you do something, you must
ask if you are able to do so.

292
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,000
You can get to say goodbye to parents
because I never see more.

293
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,950
Can you kill a guard, you can thi
abandon your child in a gas station

294
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
or if you are slammed on the ground a little old lady
Nice that stands in your way Thi?

295
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:25,380
Because if you want to do
things, he and the future.

296
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:31,450
And if you're not in this state
does not start, because someone will be killed.

297
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,000
What is your sin?

298
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,950
I willingly surrendered.

299
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,850
I never thought I supported him to find
and waits on the threshold of the door of the bedroom.

300
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,000
So how much money you have in your pocket?

301
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,000
Good luck!

302
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,880
3 months

303
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,650
All prisons in the world have "weaknesses".

304
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,760
Everyone has a key.
You only have one finds you.

305
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,400
How did you do?

306
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,300
I looked closely. Especially when things
who were not part of daily routine.

307
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,550
In the left Allegheny County Jail's.
The world's biggest prison.

308
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,500
There were three attempts to escape
but they paid for it with life.

309
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,660
E. Right ..

310
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:50,000
"The first landing by turning
this pillar to provide housing,

311
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:55,350
a sort of niche, on a stage wide and about
further, so as to adapt ... "

312
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,750
LIFT

313
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:10,150
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

314
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,500
Okay?

315
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,900
Second, money.
You need a truck of money.

316
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,760
All hotels are expensive,
travel information.

317
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,600
Continue to select image

318
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,960
and the magic lasso tool "that you can do
dramatic changes.

319
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,750
Hey!

320
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,650
Identity.
It is easy to obtain false documents,

321
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,550
but it is difficult to obtain documents
you can pass control of the airport.

322
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,560
- Oxycodone.
- $ 10 each.

323
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,350
Or 5-40.

324
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:41,200
- Hey, I need someone passports.
- Get out of here, man!

325
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,280
Gone!

326
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,750
Very well, my boy?

327
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,850
For passports
should you pay for vans.

328
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,850
- I think I can do.
- You know where I Hotel Lafayette?

329
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,800
Ave E Street. Go
enters the bar and asks the Harv.

330
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,200
- You like the name?
- Tell him I sent you Moussa.

331
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,200
Harv? I'm looking Harv.

332
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,100
- You're Harv?
- Yes.

333
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:57,150
- Moussa told me to look for you.
- He sent you? And what do you want?

509
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,300
- I spent enough time with him?
- No.

510
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,700
You never dealt fairly by him?

511
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,900
Jesus! John.

512
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:51,150
This time around, even exaggerating.

513
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:55,600
Luke welcomes you because the weights
his mother is in prison for murder,

514
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:58,710
not because his father
I spent enough time with him.

515
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:03,550
Your father was right. You are life
in a different world from ours.

516
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,250
It is good that you say you
and you in business.

517
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,700
- I live in the world, Lara?
- I do not know John, but not true.

518
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,900
I'll spend the rest of my life here

519
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:19,010
and you want to believe
I do not know this fantasy in which he did not ...

520
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,400
It is everything okay?

521
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,100
Yes. Sorry!

522
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,750
And now, with a face that time on,
I want you for your leaves.

523
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,370
What do you want to do
You want to make you feel better?

524
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:44,900
I understand!

525
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,550
- Sorry.
- Ithier apologize?

526
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:51,500
- You are a true gem!
- What do you want me, Lara?

527
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:55,510
What I want from you?
Nothing. Already you're too perfect!

528
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,700
You never asked me
so I did.

529
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,200
- If we really killed.
- Because I know I killed you.

530
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,420
Then, you and Eli.

531
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,250
I'm done.

532
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,400
Mr. President, did you leave the station there.

533
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,400
Sir!

534
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,850
Sir!

535
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,700
- What?
- Shut up!

536
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,250
I do not care what you say and how you say it.

537
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,790
I do not think you did something like that.

538
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,650
I do not believe it.

539
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,750
I know who you are.

540
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,960
I promise you that ...

541
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,000
one to tell you not to spend life and a.

542
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,000
Shut up!

543
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,170
- What happened to my merchandise?
- I know you?

544
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,200
How dare I not Trimithi?

545
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,550
Move as you! Back!

546
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,960
Back!

547
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,060
- This time both of them!
- Shoot the dog!

548
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:19,500
- Take your dog here!
- If your dog shoot, kill!

549
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,600
- Police want to come here, asshole!
- Good idea!

550
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:25,200
- Take the dog out of here!
- That he was shot!

551
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:26,610
Paint it!

552
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,735
- Enter and you there!
- I'm not going there!

553
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,100
Go ahead!

554
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,520
Go! Go there!

01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,350
- I have done nothing!
- Did you bring me here!

558
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,050
I never did!

559
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,200
Put your knees!
Down!

560
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,700
Where are the prices?

561
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:00,450
Here. I hope to be helpful.

562
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:03,850
- Where are the others?
- Here, take them to everyone.

563
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,600

- Wait until I give you money, yes.

564
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:08,900

565
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:10,560
- We kill them both!
- No, I'll kill you both!

566
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:13,220
- Give them money!
- Shut up, zdreanþã!

567
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:15,970
Give them money!
Jesus! you stop!

568
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,200
See?
You are not able to kill me.

569
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,650
That's all you can do?

570
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,750
Go home. I'll come get you
and I'll kill you.

571
01:06:39,277 --> 01:06:41,177
Waste and your kindness of spirit.

572
01:06:41,412 --> 01:06:43,912
Yes, good things.
Contains a large amount of alcohol.

573
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:52,200
- What do you do, give me fire?
- Yes.

574
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:54,450
- That I will do.
- Jesus Christ!

575
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,510
This is a drug lab, you idiot!

576
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,600
No, it was.

577
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,650
- Phooey!
- Where is the money?

578
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,600
My baby is upstairs!

579
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:06,750
My baby is upstairs!

580
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:10,570
Arise! Arise!

581
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:35,500
Please!
Let me go! Please!

582
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:15,350
Anyone there?

583
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,550
Do not leave me here!

584
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,050
I do not want to die here!

585
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:52,100
Please!

586
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:28,650
Take me to the hospital, please!

587
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:32,150
I can not breathe!

588
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,700
Please!

589
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,850
I can not breathe!

590
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,300
Give yourself a hand.

591
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,750
- What have we here?
- A strange miracle.

592
01:11:13,818 --> 01:11:16,350
The basement is a drug lab,
and the house is still standing.

593
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:19,030
- Must be a crater there.
- We know who is the victim?

594
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,750
Alex Gaidar. He was known to history
violence and drug trafficking.

595
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,100
Can a child?

596
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:37,500
His neighbor said his wife left him
last year. Once there, surprise!

597
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,172
Blood that here ...

598
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,450
to know who owns it?

599
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:46,350
No, but it seems that someone who was bleeding
it out through the back door,

600
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:50,160
and in District 3, on a bench next to the passage
we found a victim who was shot and how much.

601
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,900
- I came to pick up Luke.
- Your son is asleep.

602
01:12:43,307 --> 01:12:45,507
Yes, we got Luke to take him home.

603
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,000
John!

604
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:58,450
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

605
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:11,850
Hey, chicken and the city.
Wake up, you go home.

606
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,900
- How do you say?
- Thanks, Mom!

607
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:19,050
Go fuck her grandmother.

608
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,030
- I'm too tired to give them more kisses.
- Baby!

609
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,800
There is no problem.

610
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:25,050
O give me many kisses
next week.

611
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:29,700
We want to take the Harvest Festival
Kutztown, see Clydesdale cãluþii.

612
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,500
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

613
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:38,650
Bye!

614
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,450
Hey!

615
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:47,250
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye!

616
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:04,950
Goodbye!

617
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,900
- Bye, Mom!
- Bye!

618
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:42,700
- At bãtrâneþe become sentimental.
- Yes, the so-i.

619
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:47,850
Me and someone serves me a coffee?

620
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,050
Hey, idioþilor!

621
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,900
Can I take it and him?

622
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,900
No, baby.
Everything that goes in the backpack.

623
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:29,150
- But in your pockets?
- Or in the pocket.

624
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:56,350
Hello!

625
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,800
Hello?

626
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:25,550
Hey, chicken and the city!
I'll be back soon, yes?

627
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,050
Well.

628
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,250
Baby.

629
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:03,450
A and a.

630
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,600
- You okay?
- Yes.

631
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:15,150
See where spending occurs.
Yield 922, street.

632
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,600
What would you say?
Do you agree?

633
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:19,450
Here we go.

634
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,600
Stop all models
The Prius did in 2004-2009.

635
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:42,640
What's killer and that
driving a Prius?

636
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:44,650
A very responsible
socially?

637
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,950
The city has recorded more than a thousand
Prius and sites throughout the state, about seven miles.

638
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,150
How many have been recorded
on behalf of criminals?

639
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:55,300
The statewide, six. Four crook
evazioni're or a rapist and murderer.

640
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:58,200
- Start with the murderer.
- Is in jail for the rest of life.

641
01:19:58,450 --> 01:20:00,350
The rapist is free.

642
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,080
it finds.

643
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:14,400
- Hi!
- Hello!

644
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,100
- Glad to see you.

645
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:23,700
- Hi, Luke.
- It's a pony.

646
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,900
Gifts are packed.

647
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,730
You know the party starts
11:00, you?

648
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,500
Really? Read more carefully
what is written on invitation.

649
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:36,950
There is no problem. Why do not you
give her gift to Carrie?

650
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,700
- I think you could help me.
- Actually, I must go. I have something to do.

651
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:47,050
Sorry.

652
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,250
Then you will see later.

653
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,700
Thank you very much.

654
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,600
Hey ...

655
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:02,300
Is the phone number
the jacket of my parents,

656
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:04,350
the top pocket of his jacket.

657
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:08,510
Where the end.

658
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:11,150
No problem.

659
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:23,750
The rapist is in a wheelchair.
I do not know if it was karma or bad luck.

660
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,800
Criminal ...
Where is incarcerated?

661
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,800
In state prison,
here in town.

662
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:31,350
She has a husband or an adult child
I could drive a car?

01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:47,900
- Yes. What?
- Lara Brennan blood tests.

664
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:52,950
Get me to the lab.

665
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,700
You angry against someone, it is clear.

01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,450
- Busy, try again.

667

- Her husband is a teacher.
- You know the address where she lives?

670
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,400
There is no car in the garage.
Want to ask a warrant?

671
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:28,850
Yes.

672
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:59,250
Do you in the office!

Tell them that we meet in hospital
in 10 minutes.

677

Yes! Yes, we agree.

678
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:57,650
Location: it's not serious.
There is no problem, sir.

679
01:24:58,150 --> 01:24:59,650
The so-us.

680
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:03,150
- Hands Up!

681
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,650
Give me the phone.

- Do not stop at traffic lights.

689
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:33,650
Tie his hands and feet
close as you can.

690
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:36,550
If you leave out of here with him
I'll kill you both.

691
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,350
- Stop the silence Thi!
- John, he's right.

692
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,850
Listen to him. You will die here.
Why do this?

693
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,140
Because we have no other choice!

694

01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,250
- It's Where?
- You wait.

700
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,600

- Why do this to me?

701
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:59,300
Click "send".
Tell him that I return without you.

702
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:02,650

- You think you can come back to me, Lara?

703
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:08,000

01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:39,950
Travel too far.
And now, you just check?

You know how many times we lost baggage?

815

822
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:44,600

Come on, Luke.

826

Thank you.

829
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:31,700
Too bad you did not find him any more.

830
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:35,550
Yes. I would love to
to know what it is.

831
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:39,350
I searched all the sights,
but I found nothing.

832
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:43,150
- It's the presidential palace.

833
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:45,800
They aired on CNN and when it was the collapse
the earthquake.

01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:52,300
- I know where they went.
- Me and my show.

835
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,700
Open the door!

836
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:03,250
And I'll take a look!

837
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,300
Let's go!

838
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:27,800
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
Yet nobody gets up on the plan.

839
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:29,850
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
Sorry!

840
01:50:30,150 --> 01:50:31,650
Excuse me, please!

841
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:52,150
Sorry, nobody on the flight

01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:54,850
Not at all. I'm here.
You have pictures?

843
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:58,800
We have their pictures
but not in this plan.

844
01:50:59,550 --> 01:51:01,850
There are flights to Haiti and other
tonight?

845
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:03,800
There are no other flights, sir.

It started to rain.

850
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,800
I'll tell the FBI.

851
01:51:33,950 --> 01:51:37,650
Have you wondered why I find
this bag and others not?

852
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:49,360

855
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:08,500
