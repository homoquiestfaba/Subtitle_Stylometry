My car is a piece.

Mm-hmm.

74
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:46,846
I guess if you were coming
back is the important part,

75
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,053

their ass into Mexico.

he can not pay for her.

The way she's looking
at you, you hit her face.

108

Never mind about your friend then.

109

You fuck my wife then.

110
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,824
Now I'm fucking your wife?

111
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,292
That's what I'm gonna tell the police.

112
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:51,130
You fucked my wife, then
you hit her face, my wife.

113
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:52,765
The fuck she's your wife.

114

Listen to me my friend,
you're a long ways from home.

It is very simple for you to go to jail.

Nope.

Stay right here.

138
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:16,876
Mitch, this is the Captain.

139
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:19,512
Mitch is from Texas.

140
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:21,382
Is that so?

141
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,052
Yeah he's got a bad ass black SUV.

142
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:27,920
No shit.

143
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:29,989
What do you need me for Mitch?

144
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,925
I never said that I did.

146
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:39,399
Well, it's like this.

147
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,968
You know Halliburton right?

148
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:44,872
Yeah.

149
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:48,174
You do?

150
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,577
No.

151
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:53,945
It's a company.

152
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:55,982
- OK.
- They're in Iraq.

153
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:59,017
They've got private security
working for the government.

154
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:03,055
A Halliburton truck driver makes five times

155
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:05,491
what a four star general makes.

156
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:07,394
You know why?

157
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:11,030
I guess cause it's a rip off.

158
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:15,603
Cause they get the fucking job done.

159
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:19,338
And when you get the fucking job done,

160
00:13:19,372 --> 00:13:22,108
you get to name your price.

161
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:27,046
Do you wanna name your price, Mitch?

162
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:30,984
Hell yeah, he does.

163
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:39,425
Look, Jesse's a dip shit.

164
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:41,393
Anybody can see that.

165
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:44,898
He likes to talk a good game but you,

166
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:48,102
you don't like to talk.

167
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:53,071
So I'm not gonna say shit to you.

168
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:54,507
I'm not gonna tell you how you could be

on the war on drugs,

saving I don't know how many sisters

172
00:13:59,145 --> 00:14:01,046
from a life of prostitution and whoring,

173
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,249
just to get their next fix.

174
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:06,718
I'm not gonna tell you,

175
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:09,188
you could make big money carrying a gun

176
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:11,556
and wearing a badge and getting sweet look

177
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,725
from every senorita that walks by.

178
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,460
And I'm not gonna tell you

179
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:17,964
that it feels like a
shot of mainline heroine

180
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:20,098
to be kicking ass and taking names,

181
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:22,068
all in the name of Uncle Sam,

182
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:25,170
all the while knowing that
you've got diplomatic immunity

183
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:27,305
under section 434.868C,

184
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:29,709
passed by the U.S. Senate last year.

185
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,146
What I am gonna tell you...

186
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:35,416
...is I'll pay you,

187
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,018
5,000 dollars a week to ride by my side.

188
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:42,188
What do you say cowboy?

189
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,528
I don't know.

190
00:14:58,637 --> 00:15:05,244
Look... I know you've got a
crap ass situation to go back to.

191
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:08,613
We all do.

192
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:10,782
Nobody spends one night in Mexico

193
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:14,020
if they've got anything
to go back to up there.

194
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:17,323
But you know deep in your gut,

195
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:19,525
that whatever might happen down here,

196
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,460
can't be half as bad as
that crap ass situation

197
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:24,998
you have to go back to.

198
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:35,375
So why go back?

199
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:00,600
[sighs]

200
00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:08,575
It'll be easier if I drive.

201
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:51,318
[car door closing]

202
00:17:00,593 --> 00:17:02,161
Come on.

203
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:43,337
Take your pick.

204
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:45,599
[thunder rumbles]

205
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:48,701
[man] Attention!

206
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:50,802
Wake up, girls.

207
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:52,405
Come on!

208
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:54,373
Line up!

209
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:56,776
Come on!

210
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:05,319
Come on!

211
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:12,358
Four mile, double time hike.

212
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:16,861
I don't want any talking,
belly aching, or grab ass.

213
00:19:16,895 --> 00:19:19,564
I'll see you in the mess.

214
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:22,635
Camarillo, get Mitch an outfit.

215
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:46,425
No one goes in the big house.

216
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:49,429
OK.

217
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:16,387
What's this for?

218
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:19,457
That's your weapon.

219
00:20:19,491 --> 00:20:21,592
Am I supposed to hit somebody with it?

220
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:24,429
It's your rifle.

221
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:26,598
Am I supposed to shoot somebody with it?

222
00:20:26,632 --> 00:20:30,036
You will get a real weapon
whenever you earned it.

223
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:26,692
[hawk screeches]

224
00:21:47,078 --> 00:21:49,615
So, how'd you get here?

225
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,084
Just came down.

226
00:21:54,953 --> 00:21:58,756
Aren't you gonna ask how I got here?

227
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,460
- You want me to?
- Yeah.

228
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:02,927
How'd you get down here?

229
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:06,531
My daddy stole me out of
Oklahoma, away from my mama,

230
00:22:06,565 --> 00:22:07,899
who had no right to me.

231
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:09,568
They say I'm on a milk carton,

232
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:11,571
but I don't believe them.

233
00:22:12,771 --> 00:22:13,839
Your daddy?

234
00:22:13,873 --> 00:22:15,573
The Captain's my daddy.

235
00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:16,875
Stole me away.

236
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:20,147
Say he'd waited a year,
then couldn't wait no more.

237
00:22:22,681 --> 00:22:24,015
That's quite a story you got there.

238
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:26,752
That's why I made you ask me.

239
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:31,557
[whistles] Break.

240
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:33,559
[Mitch] So how long you all been at this?

241
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:34,760
Forever.

242
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:36,561
Where's it going?

243
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:40,901
Around the tree, all the way to the corral.

244
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,601
What's it for?

245
00:22:43,635 --> 00:22:45,638
Protection.

246
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:49,041
Protection against what?

247
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:51,111
[man] It builds character.

248
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:06,593
[yells]

249
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,876
OK, back to work.

250
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:26,979
Back!

251
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:31,517
You can't mean him right?

252
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:33,220
Everyone!

253
00:23:40,992 --> 00:23:42,661
Stop.

254
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:44,865
Stop.

255
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:52,704
Hey, we can pick up the pace.

256
00:23:52,738 --> 00:23:55,607
We're not gonna miss one saw.

257
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:57,710
We have orders.

258
00:24:00,011 --> 00:24:02,580
You ever been bit by a scorpion?

259
00:24:02,614 --> 00:24:07,685
There's a lot of things
worse in war than scorpions.

260
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:08,520
This isn't fucking war.

261
00:24:08,554 --> 00:24:11,157
We're just digging a fucking ditch!

262
00:24:12,924 --> 00:24:14,728
Paul!

263
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:21,966
Sir.

264
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,304
If this soldier talks back
to me again, you silence him.

265
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:28,740
Paul, you touch me and
you'll see what happens.

266
00:24:28,774 --> 00:24:32,677
Money says it's on, it's on.

267
00:24:32,711 --> 00:24:34,879
Benito, go back to cutting.

268
00:24:34,913 --> 00:24:36,848
Don't move.

269
00:24:36,882 --> 00:24:39,619
Discipline the soldier.

270
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:42,220
Don't do it, Paul.

271
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:43,688
Now!

272
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:45,724
[grunting]

273
00:24:53,732 --> 00:24:55,901
[clicking]

274
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:02,241
[buzzing]

275
00:25:10,248 --> 00:25:12,786
[groaning]

276
00:25:38,678 --> 00:25:40,278
[Mitch] Jack.

277
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:41,848
Jack.

278
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:44,950
I can see you.

279
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:46,984
No you can't.

280
00:25:47,018 --> 00:25:48,819
Come on Jack, let me out.

281
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:50,657
[Jack] You know I can't.

282
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:55,928
- Is it piss or water?
- Water.

283
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,934
- Are you lying?
- Smell it yourself.

284
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:13,046
Do you have any food?

285
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:19,886
[wolves howling]

286
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:11,470
[coughing]

287
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,039
[Benito] Mitch.

288
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,841
Yeah.

289
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,811
[Benito] Thank you.

290
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:36,021
[banging]

291
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:36,181
Attention!

292
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:52,030
God bless, let's eat.

293
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:39,912
Mitch.

294
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,451
[door opens]

295
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:52,558
I want my money, I'm going home.

296
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:03,635
Mitch, I can't keep building fences,

297
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:06,104
knowing they ain't gonna hold.

298
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:09,974
That's not 5,000 dollars.

299
00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:13,444
You're lucky you're still breathing.

300
00:31:13,478 --> 00:31:16,149
I want what was promised to me.

301
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:20,219
You want to be great?

302
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,120
You are great.

303
00:31:23,154 --> 00:31:25,656
It's itching inside of you,
just waiting to get out,

304
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,258
but there's no way to prove it.

305
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:29,127
There's no playing field.

306
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:33,031
You go back up to the
States now... [scoffs]

307
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:35,733
...no one will ever know it.

308
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:36,768
But here...

309
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:43,742
When you look out on the
desert, what do you see?

310
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,609
You see sand.

311
00:31:45,643 --> 00:31:48,213
I see shimmering horizons.

312
00:31:48,247 --> 00:31:52,250
I see silver and gold that flow like water.

313
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:57,454
You see a mirage, I see mercury plains.

314
00:31:57,488 --> 00:32:01,025
I see women, I see music.

315
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:06,164
I see love, and I see a whole lot of money.

316
00:32:06,198 --> 00:32:07,698
There's no money down here.

317
00:32:07,732 --> 00:32:10,100
Oh, that's where you're wrong son.

318
00:32:10,134 --> 00:32:11,502
There's more money down here

319
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:14,138
than all the banks in Texas combined,

320
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:17,009
you can thank the cartels for that.

321
00:32:17,742 --> 00:32:19,543
What's in it for me?

322
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:23,181
The only way to find out,
is to measure yourself

323
00:32:23,215 --> 00:32:25,752
against the mercury plains.

324
00:32:31,489 --> 00:32:35,326
Whatever we confiscate, you keep half.

325
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,095
But I need you here.

326
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:40,299
Boys are starting to look up
to you, they need a leader.

327
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:43,402
Half.

328
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:52,778
[sawing]

329
00:33:28,913 --> 00:33:31,150
Mitch Davis.

330
00:33:41,826 --> 00:33:44,296
Paul Whitesall.

331
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,666
Pleased to meet you.

332
00:33:54,238 --> 00:33:56,508
I'm here to kick ass.

333
00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:00,712
Who's ass, I don't care.

334
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:05,750
As long as it's spic,
Injun, or white trash.

335
00:34:05,784 --> 00:34:07,886
Which is pretty much a damn near certainty,

336
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,588
considering this line of work.

337
00:34:10,622 --> 00:34:12,692
Wouldn't you say?

338
00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:18,698
That's a pretty gun Paul.

339
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:35,715
Thank you.

340
00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:42,352
There's suddenly a time in any mans life

341
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:47,457
where he can look back
and see a turning point.

342
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:52,797
But for a soldier, every
moment is a turning point.

343
00:35:01,806 --> 00:35:03,743
Who wants it?

344
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:15,352
Paul the apostle.

345
00:35:15,386 --> 00:35:17,854
There's a drug runner
working out of Monclova.

346
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,323
It's a smaller town,

347
00:35:19,357 --> 00:35:22,327
and he's keeping a low
profile for a white man.

348
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:25,363
But last week, a little girl turned up dead

349
00:35:25,397 --> 00:35:28,499
in Houston, on some bad meth,
his operation sold to her.

350
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:30,501
I got a newspaper article
with a picture on it

351
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:33,437
if you wanna let that little girl's face

352
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:35,506
burn into your brain a little bit.

353
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,542
But you shouldn't need the motivation.

354
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:41,745
This guy is wrong, and you are right.

355
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:44,716
But he's smart, and he's well protected.

356
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,719
So we're gonna need to
use a little diversion.

357
00:35:55,926 --> 00:35:58,463
Look at that bastard.

358
00:35:58,497 --> 00:36:00,397
[speaks Spanish] ...shirt.

359
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:02,334
Beautiful fucking shirt.

360
00:36:03,535 --> 00:36:04,904
Yo, guys.

361
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:23,454
- Sir, you need taxi?
- No.

362
00:36:23,488 --> 00:36:25,423
You're going to the airport,
yes? You need a taxi.

363
00:36:25,457 --> 00:36:26,591
I sent for a car thanks.

364
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:27,758
They're not here.

365
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:29,760
Taxi's better and less money.

366
00:36:29,794 --> 00:36:32,729
Yeah, you know what, I'm gonna

I found the letter, in the shirt.

Maybe from the girlfriend.

I've been planting a new

Sometimes I think
planting is the best part.

431
00:41:26,357 --> 00:41:28,693
And if so, why plant the garden at all?

432
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:30,595
I guess that's life.

I understand your reasons

You say you love the country

and that it's good for your career.

449
00:42:20,111 --> 00:42:22,680
But I can't help but think
that your fight with your father

451
00:42:24,848 --> 00:42:26,117
I talked to him and he said

452

that he's sorry about what happened

453
00:42:28,953 --> 00:42:33,323

What the fuck is Juarez?

606
01:00:48,451 --> 01:00:51,756
It's the city across

You know that don't you?

You're a quiet motherfucker.

628
01:03:19,703 --> 01:03:21,939
That means you think too much.

629
01:03:23,073 --> 01:03:24,539
I like that.

630
01:03:24,573 --> 01:03:27,142
I think too much.

631
01:03:27,176 --> 01:03:31,214
It's a bad thing for
musicians lovers, and soldiers.

632
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,286
Stop thinking so much.

633
01:03:36,453 --> 01:03:38,055
OK.

634
01:03:39,221 --> 01:03:41,423
But not just yet.

635
01:03:41,457 --> 01:03:44,561
Right now I want you to
think just a little bit.

636
01:03:48,998 --> 01:03:51,434
If you say so.

637
01:03:51,468 --> 01:03:54,071
You ever wonder what soldiers are for?

638
01:03:56,605 --> 01:03:58,707
- War.
- And what is war?

639
01:03:58,741 --> 01:04:02,512
I mean take out the killing
part. What's its purpose?

640
01:04:02,546 --> 01:04:06,249
To take and keep territory.
And what is territory?

641
01:04:06,283 --> 01:04:10,388
If you think about it, I own this,
you don't, get off my property.

642
01:04:11,721 --> 01:04:14,390
It's the foundation
for the power structure.

643
01:04:14,424 --> 01:04:17,993
Armies are all about keeping
power structure in place.

644
01:04:18,027 --> 01:04:20,562
Keeping the rich folks rich,
and the poor folks poor.

645
01:04:20,596 --> 01:04:23,968
And the places where
there's no power structure...

646
01:04:25,468 --> 01:04:28,104
...those armies are worthless.

647
01:04:28,138 --> 01:04:31,374
But out here in the third world,

648
01:04:31,408 --> 01:04:33,977
the power structure is all fucked up.

649
01:04:34,011 --> 01:04:37,046
They've got hospitals
for shit, police for shit,

650
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,450
but they also don't have the man,

651
01:04:40,484 --> 01:04:42,584
locking you in place.

652
01:04:42,618 --> 01:04:46,321
Down here, any one man can be
as powerful as any one other man

653
01:04:46,355 --> 01:04:50,193
at any point in time.
That's the beauty of it.

654
01:04:50,227 --> 01:04:54,564
It means, if I'm sharp up
here, and if I've got guts,

655
01:04:54,598 --> 01:04:57,168
I can own the whole world.

656
01:05:01,471 --> 01:05:06,075
Back in America, I'd probably
just be another fucked up vet,

657
01:05:06,109 --> 01:05:09,745

658
01:05:09,779 --> 01:05:12,515

660
01:05:16,386 --> 01:05:20,323
But down here... look at me.

661
01:05:20,357 --> 01:05:21,490
I've got my family.

662
01:05:21,524 --> 01:05:24,260
I got a ranch. [chuckles]

01:05:25,227 --> 01:05:27,597
I'm a king.

A funny thing happened
on the way to the castle.

665
01:05:32,234 --> 01:05:36,138
Now I gotta protect my power structure.

666

I didn't see it coming but here I am.

667
01:05:40,109 --> 01:05:43,013
That's why I need soldiers like you.

01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,714

01:15:15,283 --> 01:15:17,052
[the Captain] Go to the ditch.

733
01:15:17,086 --> 01:15:18,855
Go that way.

734
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:24,827
[the Captain] Come on,
Mitch, he's gaining on us.

735
01:15:24,861 --> 01:15:27,598
- I don't see it.
- [Camarillo] That way, that way.

[sirens blaring]

737
01:15:32,801 --> 01:15:34,136
[the Captain] Right turn, right.

738
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:36,672
There he is.

739
01:15:40,943 --> 01:15:42,813
Turn right at the tree.

740
01:16:01,029 --> 01:16:02,163
[Mitch] What are we doing here?

741
01:16:02,197 --> 01:16:04,634
[the Captain] Waiting on a paper.

742
01:16:05,734 --> 01:16:06,735
For what?

743
01:16:06,769 --> 01:16:09,139
Find out who took that move.

744
01:16:11,206 --> 01:16:15,244
You steal from federal police,
they're bound to find us.

745
01:16:15,278 --> 01:16:17,280
Yeah, but not that fast.

746
01:16:22,385 --> 01:16:25,822
Maybe you did it. Did you do it?

747
01:16:27,857 --> 01:16:31,294
Nah, that's not your style.

748
01:16:35,864 --> 01:16:37,867
What have we got?

749
01:16:39,836 --> 01:16:42,906
[speaking in Spanish]

750
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:49,311
...gang, operating from a farmhouse.

751
01:16:50,846 --> 01:16:54,483
May have been connected
to other acts of violence.

752
01:16:54,517 --> 01:17:00,154
Jesse... of Macon, Georgia,
found dead in Monterrey.

753
01:17:00,188 --> 01:17:05,894
Paul Whitesall, of Houston, shot
dead in Juarez, by federal agents.

754
01:17:05,928 --> 01:17:07,863
[speaking Spanish]

755
01:17:07,897 --> 01:17:12,367
Captured at the scene was
Ruben Gustavo Hernandez, 13.

756
01:17:12,401 --> 01:17:15,471
Material witness, Alyssa Booker, 19,

760
01:17:44,367 --> 01:17:46,069
Benito.

761

He's not listed there.

762
01:17:53,075 --> 01:17:55,444
Oh, Benito.

763
01:18:04,586 --> 01:18:06,288
How you doing, son?

764
01:18:07,255 --> 01:18:09,190
I made it out alive.

765
01:18:09,224 --> 01:18:10,861
Glad you did, too.

766
01:18:39,087 --> 01:18:41,524
Let's go for a little walk, Benito.

767
01:18:42,425 --> 01:18:45,293
[Benito] What for?

768
01:18:45,327 --> 01:18:47,096
[the Captain] Just want
to have a little talk.

769
01:18:48,331 --> 01:18:50,801
No, no, that's OK.

770
01:18:52,535 --> 01:18:54,869
- Come on, let's go.
- No.

771
01:18:54,903 --> 01:18:57,206
- Get out...
- [Benito mumbling]

772
01:19:19,028 --> 01:19:20,397
Sometimes...

773
01:19:22,998 --> 01:19:27,970
Sometimes, a great man have to do...

774
01:19:29,237 --> 01:19:31,173
...terrible things.

775
01:19:33,142 --> 01:19:34,911

...shit!

795
01:27:34,857 --> 01:27:37,627
We are animals!

796
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:43,700
There's one alone that sets
us apart from the beasts.

797
01:27:47,035 --> 01:27:48,802
What is war?

798
01:27:48,836 --> 01:27:50,806
Not to bind us.

799
01:27:53,841 --> 01:27:57,714
It gave us castles and cities and nations.

800
01:27:59,081 --> 01:28:03,553
Inside the walls, we built cities.

801
01:28:05,854 --> 01:28:08,925
Around the armies we formed nations.

802
01:28:18,599 --> 01:28:20,535
[grunting]

803
01:28:34,015 --> 01:28:39,589
You see, there is a beauty in the darkness.

804
01:28:42,224 --> 01:28:43,860
A purpose.

805
01:28:45,794 --> 01:28:47,596
[horse whinnies]

806
01:28:50,666 --> 01:28:52,869
Parley, son!

807
01:28:54,502 --> 01:28:56,639
Parley and talk!

808
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:02,978
Come to me and parley, boy!

809
01:29:06,915 --> 01:29:08,718
Come to me!

810
01:29:15,623 --> 01:29:19,127
I alone know you.

811
01:29:19,161 --> 01:29:21,529
You suspected you were meant for greatness,

812
01:29:21,563 --> 01:29:24,932
but I knew, I told you,

813
01:29:24,966 --> 01:29:27,603
I birthed you!

814
01:29:28,504 --> 01:29:29,937
And now that you have tasted

815
01:29:29,971 --> 01:29:34,641
that hot salt of life, you are high.

816
01:29:34,675 --> 01:29:39,014
Your blood runs with a quicksilver pulse.

817
01:29:39,747 --> 01:29:41,983
But you are afraid.

818
01:29:43,785 --> 01:29:44,985
[grunting]

819
01:29:45,019 --> 01:29:48,190
Boldness is best tasted in the first gulp.

820
01:29:50,626 --> 01:29:53,463
But the buzz is wearing thin.

821
01:30:00,702 --> 01:30:06,742
A step faltered... and breath cut short.

822
01:30:08,644 --> 01:30:10,847
Shallowness in the belly.

823
01:30:13,681 --> 01:30:16,719
For greatness is too much to bear alone.

824
01:30:19,054 --> 01:30:22,757
And now you long for another shoulder.

825
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:31,767
Come to me.

826
01:30:34,736 --> 01:30:37,172
Come and rest your head.

827
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:03,798
[grunts]

828
01:31:13,108 --> 01:31:15,845
Have you told yourself you hate me?

829
01:31:20,181 --> 01:31:21,651
Come here.

830
01:31:22,783 --> 01:31:25,787
Do you hate me, boy? Huh?

831
01:31:28,657 --> 01:31:31,325
David thought he hated Goliath.

832
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:33,727
Then he stood alone on that field,

833
01:31:33,761 --> 01:31:36,131
the Israelite's in their tents,

834
01:31:37,632 --> 01:31:39,601
the Philistines in theirs.

835
01:31:39,635 --> 01:31:42,369
One man joined him on that battle field.

836
01:31:42,403 --> 01:31:45,205
Enemies, who do we have,

837
01:31:45,239 --> 01:31:47,775
but each other?

838
01:31:47,809 --> 01:31:50,278
Come to know what you've always known,

839
01:31:50,312 --> 01:31:54,684
- what you were born knowing!
- [groans]

840
01:31:55,884 --> 01:32:00,723
War, war is how men love.

841
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:03,858
Now come...

842
01:32:06,761 --> 01:32:08,730
Come and kiss.

843
01:32:08,764 --> 01:32:09,799

Sir, can I help you?

850
01:35:03,572 --> 01:35:04,907
Nope.

851
01:36:56,451 --> 01:36:58,921
What are you doing?

852
01:37:10,998 --> 01:37:13,601
What is going on?

853
01:37:13,635 --> 01:37:18,073

friend of Brad's in Mexico.
