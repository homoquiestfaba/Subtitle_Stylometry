00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:04,422
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,029
Monitors on.

3
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:33,751
Program Bertolucci.

4
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,078
Assignment on.

5
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,706
(dramatic music)

6
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,669
Satellite link on.

7
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,339
(dramatic music)

8
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,939
(glass shatters)

9
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,181
(tense music)

10
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,032
Shh.

11
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,662
Spyder, that way.

12
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:35,997
Let's do it.

13
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,332
Live feed...

14
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:40,877
On.

15
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,422
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

16
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,251
Mr. Bertolucci is not
to be underestimated.

17
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:48,678
He's known as "The Cat."

18
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:49,512
[Man] Why's that?

19
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,839
He survived eight
assassination attempts.

20
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,924
This is why our client has come to us.

21
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,691
Display camera A.

22
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,020
(tense music)

23
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,694
(fountain water sprays)

24
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,918
Jimmy.

25
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,418
What's your status?

26
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,962
All clear.

27
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,550
Go that way.

28
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:31,971
[Man] Ben?

29
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,797
Everything's okay.

30
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,425
(tense music)

31
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,855
Good afternoon, boss.

32
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,023
You okay, sir?

33
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,526
You tell me.

34
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,741
[Warbeck] Alexander.

35
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,034
Yes, sir?

36
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,152
I'd like Damian to lead this, please.

37
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,786
What?

38
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:58,998
Damian.

39
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,700
I'd like to use this again
later as a training sequence.

40
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,627
Use a hands-on technique.

41
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,127
Understood.

42
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,505
Alexander.

43
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,958
You and Spyder remain back
until I tell you otherwise.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,343
Yes, sir.

45
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,837
(tense music)

46
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,603
- Sir, your usual.
- Thanks.

47
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,354
Our guests will be arriving soon.

48
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,515
Go see what's going on down there.

49
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,278
Two o'clock.

50
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,862
Bodyguard on main balcony.

51
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,868
Baby.

52
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,611
I've been waiting for you, tiger.

53
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,406
You're not the only one, sweetheart.

54
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,629
Mm.

55
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,998
That's one smooth dude.

56
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,625
(tense music)

57
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,508
(water splashes)

58
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,816
Commence.

59
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,527
Jamming...

60
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,739
now.

61
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:14,990
Hey, Jimmy.

62
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,775
Are you picking up any interference?

63
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,282
(Bertolucci grunts)

64
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,744
(dramatic music)

65
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,420
Excellent work, Damien.

66
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,625
(water splashes)

67
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,673
(dramatic music)

68
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,100
(woman screams)

69
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,852
[Woman] Help!

70
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,179
(gun fires)

71
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,268
Shoot!
(guns firing)

72
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,236
Spyder, where are you?

73
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,524
I'm in position.

74
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,152
(guns firing)

75
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,740
(plates shattering)

76
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,039
Sir, Damian's under fire.

77
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,549
Permission to engage.

78
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,046
(Spyder grunts)

79
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,259
(dramatic music)

80
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,496
(men grunting)

81
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,547
(Spyder yells)

82
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,315
[Spyder] Nothing personal.

83
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,412
Hey, you!

84
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,833
No, you don't.

85
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,369
(man yells)

86
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,372
(plates shattering)

87
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,006
Mission complete.

88
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,175
Not quite.

89
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,295
There are three bodyguards
left on the perimeter.

90
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,928
Take them out immediately.

91
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,849
Make sure it's all on video.

92
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,094
(tense music)

93
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,517
There's a guard on approach
from behind the granite pyramid.

94
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,777
And he's armed.

95
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:03,567
(suspenseful music)
(men grunting)

96
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:27,850
Stop!

97
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,010
(gun fires)

98
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,554
(man yells)

99
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,265
(men grunting)

100
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,108
Come on, baby.

101
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,493
Shh.

102
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,828
[Damian] Spyder, Alexander.

103
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,868
Rendezvous back in Position
One in two minutes.

104
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,455
Let's get outta here.

105
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,876
Termination's complete, sir.

106
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,203
[Warbeck] Excellent work, gentlemen.

107
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,796
Return to base immediately.

108
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:58,964
[Damian] Yes, sir.

109
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,758
[Warbeck] Computer, stop recording.

110
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,592
Monitors off.

111
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,296
(water bubbles)

112
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,591
I guess we'll need a
replacement agent at the academy.

113
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,969
(car revs)

114
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,529
It is Jordan.

115
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,573
Jeez.

116
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,869
Don't look good.

117
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,369
What a waste.

118
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,825
(tense music)

119
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,225
I heard good things
about this Justin Vanier.

120
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,110
He's Federal Security Bureau.

121
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,572
Oh, I hope he works out.

122
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,774
Can't afford to lose another agent.

123
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,408
No kidding.

124
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,701
(car doors slamming)

125
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:18,836
Hold on, let me show you.

126
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:19,670
Stand over here.

127
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,338
The gun comes up.

128
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,048
Bang, step to the side.

129
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,875
Take him down, take the gun out.

130
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,635
Bang, bang, he's dead.

131
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,171
Now let's see you try it
with bullets in the gun.

132
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,473
Incoming!

133
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,474
Get down!

134
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,801
(gun fires)

135
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,444
What kind of gun is that?

136
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,528
Standard issue.

137
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,480
It's called shoulder strength.

138
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,149
Good concentration, too.

139
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,117
That's a definite gift.

140
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,027
Try it again, you'll get the hang of it.

141
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:54,496
Yes, sir. Thank you.

142
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,330
Yes, sir.

143
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,748
Justin.

144
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,083
How you doin', sir?

145
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,460
Woods.

146
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,711
Let's go talk over there.

147
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,337
I didn't bring my sunblock.

148
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,089
You guys make sure you practice.

149
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,589
- Okay.
- Uh huh.

150
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,377
So, did you get through
the file I sent you?

151
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,344
I read it.

152
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,963
This guy Warbeck sounds
like a prince of darkness.

153
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,599
Well, we think he is.

154
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,975
We just need some proof.

155
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,718
What happened to your undercover?

156
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:23,901
Hmm.

157
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,769
Now, we want you to contact this man.

158
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,403
His name's Eric.

159
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,531
Eric.

160
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,033
He seems familiar.

161
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,534
He's your contact on the inside.

162
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,244
He's posing as an instructor.

163
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,913
And why hasn't he called you?

164
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,656
Well, Jordan was his only contact.

165
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:38,665
He's playing it smart.

166
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,077
He's gonna sit tight and wait
'til we get in touch with him.

167
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,580
Warbeck's Virtual Arts Academy
accepted your application.

168
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,959
And they made a very thorough
background search of you.

169
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,461
You can't take any
chances with these people.

170
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,179
Good luck.

171
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,100
You'll need it.

172
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,594
(tense music)

173
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,935
(people chattering)

174
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,856
(tense music)

175
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,902
(computer beeps)

176
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,240
(bell dings)

177
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,995
(men grunting)

178
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,517
VR Control, give me
a level two opponent.

179
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,395
(computer beeps)

180
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,400
Sonny, come on, give it your best shot.

181
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,611
Give me a ready stance.

182
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:58,829
Good.

183
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,329
All right.

184
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,176
Direct contact to your
opponent's strike zones

185
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,876
will give you the highest score.

186
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,588
Concentrate, Sonny.

187
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,207
His moves are based on what
you give him to choose from.

188
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,553
One two, one two.

189
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,922
Complete punches, front kick.

190
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:22,352
Hey!

191
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,645
Are you trying to kill him?

192
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,439
(computer beeps)
Get me in there!

193
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,732
Link me up now!

194
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,142
(Eric yells)

195
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,980
That still was level two!

196
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,073
Sorry.

197
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,366
It's a glitch.

198
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,866
Glitch my...

199
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,250
Hey, will you wait a minute?

200
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,370
We're understaffed and
accidents are happening.

201
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,739
We're still trying to find
a replacement for Jordan.

202
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,999
Well, if she hadn't quit, we
wouldn't have this problem.

203
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,973
I know this isn't a good time to ask you,

204
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,462
but could you please
take the afternoon class?

205
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,350
Sure.

206
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,517
Thanks.

207
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,137
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

208
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,482
(beeping)

209
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,684
Hey, what's with this?

210
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:11,693
My card doesn't work.

211
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,278
Could you open the door, please?

212
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,730
[Woman] This area is off limits.

213
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,451
Let's go the other way.

214
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:20,285
This place is getting outta hand.

215
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,404
I mean, everything is so hush hush.

216
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,614
I feel like they don't trust me.

217
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,248
They don't.

218
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,953
[Woman] Integrated and
comprehensive programs

219
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,788
hold considerable promise

220
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,040
for the psychologically advanced students.

221
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,544
You are encouraged to use our resources.

222
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,009
We are a family, here to support you.

223
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,096
Failure to comply with the
recognition of the system

224
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,307
results in a discredit on registrants'

225
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,192
end of term evaluation.

226
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,562
What do you suppose Warbeck's
doing that's so secret?

227
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,155
And why don't you ask him?

228
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,065
I was hoping you'll introduce me to him.

229
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,742
No such luck.

230
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,320
That's like trying to gain
an audience with the Pope.

231
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:07,198
(ominous music)

232
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,586
[Warbeck] Do you think
there's a connection?

233
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,672
To the agent?

234
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,800
I doubt it.

235
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:21,762
Hmm.

236
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,008
(dramatic music)

237
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,720
(people chanting)

238
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,359
Mr. Bromfield has arrived.

239
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:43,992
Right on time.

240
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,704
Good.

241
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,330
Show Mr. Bromfield in.

242
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,202
(dramatic music)

243
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,501
Please, come in, gentlemen.

244
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,422
(tense music)

245
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,511
Mr. Bromfield.

246
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,188
Mr. Warbeck.

247
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,981
I appreciate your punctuality.

248
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,065
I understand that we have a deal.

249
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:18,561
Oh, we do, if you can
deliver what you say.

250
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:19,738
Well...

251
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,690
You're not here because
you think we can't,

252
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,492
are you, Mr. Bromfield?

253
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,118
What Mr. Bromfield is saying

254
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,870
is he wants some sort of proof

255
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,746
you guys aren't just full of air.

256
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,245
Perhaps a demonstration
of my staff's abilities.

257
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,878
Would you like that?

258
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,714
If it's possible.

259
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,137
Ah, I got just the thing.

260
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,343
(Damian grunts)
(man gasps)

261
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,977
Jesus.

262
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,307
As you can see, I value our reputation.

263
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,227
So, we have a deal then?

264
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:09,320
The price for killing Goldberg
will be three million.

265
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,122
Three million?

266
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,665
You said one and a half.

267
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,126
You're not gonna charge me for him.

268
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,954
Oh, no, we never charge
for demonstrations.

269
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,290
However, my staff has done some research,

270
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,418
and you've neglected to
give us all of the facts.

271
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,053
It seems that killing
Goldberg will net you

272
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,805
about a half a billion dollars.

273
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,515
And such a high profile case

274
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,425
and the enormous amount
of media attention,

275
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:35,555
I feel that three million is
being more than reasonable.

276
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,647
All right.

277
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,809
You'll have the money in 48 hours.

278
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,654
24.

279
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,148
(tense music)

280
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,659
(people grunting)

281
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,715
Hello, my name is Justin Vanier.

282
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,375
I called earlier about
joining the academy.

283
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,253
(computer beeps)

284
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:12,851
[Man] You're cleared, Mr. Vanier.

285
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,844
Proceed to the registration office.

286
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,478
Thank you.

287
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,651
[Man] Miss Lawson.

288
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,520
Justin Vanier is on his way.

289
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,605
All right, thanks.

290
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,483
(dramatic music)

291
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,624
(people yelling)

292
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,106
(knocking)

293
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:41,940
Hi.

294
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,857
[Justin] I'm Justin Vanier.

295
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,657
I'm glad you could make it. I'm Vicki.

296
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,069
Hi.

297
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,696
You mind if I ask you a question?

298
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,364
Why the guards on the way in?

299
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,524
Security is very important around here.

300
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,326
I'm not quite sure why.

301
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,045
Sometimes, I think it's to give the place

302
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,654
a more impressive image.

303
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,373
I'm sure impressed.

304
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,384
But then again, when you
do have hundreds of people

305
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,918
training to become lethal,

306
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,586
average discipline won't do.

307
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,467
And through the use of
computer technology,

308
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,167
we're able to compress as
much as 20 years of experience

309
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,760
into a two year program.

310
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,803
Well, that's amazing.

311
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,471
Mm-hmm.

312
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,465
But when am I gonna learn something?

313
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,098
Right now.

314
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,053
(woman grunts)

315
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,472
This is the heart of our operations.

316
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:23,523
This?

317
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,191
Don't look like that much here.

318
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,192
It doesn't look like that much

319
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,019
until you put on the helmet.

320
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,480
Then I promise you, you'll be impressed.

321
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,157
That's what she's seeing,

322
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,400
just like it's happening
to her in real life.

323
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,988
See, these programs are
designed for training.

324
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:42,992
And each student is escorted
to a better sense of self being

325
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,828
on a physical, mental,
and spiritual level.

326
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:54,462
She can also choose from an
unlimited number of scenarios.

327
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:58,091
Out of body experiences,
near death, flying,

328
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:03,137
scuba diving, space walking, passion, sex.

329
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,773
Sex?

330
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,225
You mean she can do all
that inside a computer?

331
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,858
Mm-hmm.

332
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,314
(Frank laughs)

333
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,241
What's so funny, Frank?

334
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,618
Oh, jeez.

335
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,945
I love these chop sake movies, man.

336
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:19,913
You know?

337
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,740
Hey, you ever seen the one
where the old man and the son

338
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,000
are fighting in the dark,

339
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,994
and the old man reaches
into his son's chest

340
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,879
and rips his heart out?

341
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,914
Jeez, I love that stuff.

342
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,417
Four days in this place.

343
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,302
I'm going nuts!

344
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,596
You call this a safe house?

345
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,307
I'm gonna get shot.

346
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,350
He's watching television.

347
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,470
Mr. Goldberg, with all
due respect, lighten up.

348
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,595
Nobody's gonna get shot here.

349
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,140
Now, let's just go over
your testimony for court.

350
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,818
I can't think straight.

351
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,854
The defense is gonna ask
you why you took the job

352
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,197
with Mr. Bromfield's company

353
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,482
if you have so little respect for him.

354
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,326
Now, what are you gonna say?

355
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,194
He wasn't wearing a name tag

356
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:03,156
saying Harold Bromfield, crook.

357
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,750
It's just a job.

358
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:14,459
(tense music)
(siren blares)

359
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,883
(Damian coughs)

360
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,399
Goodnight, Mr. Ward.

361
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,979
(Damian coughs)

362
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,607
(tense music)

363
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,993
I'm sorry, you've got the wrong office.

364
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,455
Where are you holding Goldberg?

365
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,132
What is this?

366
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,834
(dramatic music)

367
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,763
From here on, it gets bloody.

368
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,931
And painful.

369
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,802
(man screams)

370
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:08,688
Where's Goldberg?

371
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,481
I swear to you, I don't know!

372
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,642
I was hoping you'd say that.

373
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,228
(man yells)

374
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,022
What a lovely singing voice you must have.

375
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,282
It's here.

376
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,943
Counselor, you're off the case.

377
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,321
(man groans)

378
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,450
(bell dings)

379
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,467
(unnerving music)

380
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,153
(people shouting)

381
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,786
You've done well.

382
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:13,870
The results of your efforts
have not gone unnoticed.

383
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,374
We are...

384
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:23,087
The force that everyone wants!

385
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:27,133
We are...

386
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,767
The future!

387
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:34,307
(people chanting)

388
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,879
(Damian claps)

389
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,258
If they only knew what
I was really up to, huh?

390
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,177
(Warbeck chuckles)

391
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,812
Did you get the information on Goldberg?

392
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,022
It's all right here.

393
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:15,064
Pictures?

394
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,024
Everything.

395
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:17,317
Excellent.

396
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,651
Give it to the technician.

397
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,229
Have him put it into the
VR system immediately.

398
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,439
I want them preparing
in two hours, Damian.

399
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,327
[Woman] Illuminating the functions

400
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,655
between emotional and
psychological relationships

401
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,741
creates an environment where
students can consequently

402
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:35,126
alter those situations.

403
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:36,911
Well, into the belly of the beast.

404
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:42,675
Hey, beginner.

405
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,010
That's my room.

406
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,129
(Justin chuckles)

407
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,757
(light beeps)

408
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:55,596
(ominous music)

409
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,557
[Justin] I'm here.

410
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,275
You put it on your head.

411
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,526
Really?

412
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,322
Everything you learn here

413
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,399
you can practice on the outside.

414
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,032
I don't like it.

415
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,444
Won't work unless you wear it.

416
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,239
(ominous music)

417
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,125
Now, was that hard?

418
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,215
I don't see anything.

419
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:23,916
Wait until we start the program.

420
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,712
(computer beeps)

421
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,758
The levels of
conditioning are as follows.

422
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,635
Level one is zero pain.

423
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:35,686
Eric.

424
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,271
That is, you will feel no contact

425
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,348
from your virtual opponent or opponents,

426
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:40,817
as the case may be.

427
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:43,978
Level two is half what
real contact would feel like.

428
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,855
Three is full contact.

429
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,815
Four is contact and half.

430
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,318
Five is double contact.

431
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,904
Our goal is to get you to that
level as quickly as possible.

432
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,665
Your opponent has been designed

433
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,291
to attack with precise hits

434
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,827
the moment it discovers an
opening in your defense.

435
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:02,288
Students are encouraged
to be on the offense.

436
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,957
Always think it's better
to create an injury

437
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,342
than to suffer one.

438
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,044
You will temporarily feel the pain,

439
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,920
but without the actual injury.

440
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,797
Remember, the more you advance,

441
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,966
the tougher your opponent becomes.

442
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,802
(computer beeps)

443
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,481
(intense music)

444
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:21,981
Whoa.

445
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,196
(man yells)

446
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,042
[Vicki] That's great, Justin.

447
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,119
All right, let's try
a more advanced level.

448
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,302
Is that it?

449
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,465
How about a level five opponent?

450
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,970
(men grunting)

451
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,322
Impressive.

452
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,529
(footsteps tapping)

453
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:18,706
Hey!

454
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,206
Hold it.

455
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,209
Do you know the name Wilkinson?

456
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:26,163
(people grunting)

457
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,167
So, what have you learned?

458
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,379
Jordan's gone, I haven't
seen her in a week.

459
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,013
Jordan's dead.

460
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,675
They found her body two
days ago in the lake.

461
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,019
I'm sorry.

462
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,772
What about Warbeck?

463
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,562
He keeps this place air tight.

464
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,106
Information is on a
need to know basis only.

465
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,983
What do you recommend?

466
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,402
Whatever's going on,
it's beyond these walls.

467
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,404
Everything is run by computers.

468
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:01,907
We have to access Warbeck's
master control room

469
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,784
so I could hack into his files.

470
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,088
We'll need an access card

471
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:09,165
if we're to get in there unnoticed.

472
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,466
Leave it to me.

473
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,501
I'll see you at the
great hall at 10:00 p.m.

474
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:20,760
(dramatic music)
(people grunting)

475
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,098
(tense music)

476
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,937
(Eric grunts)

477
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,372
Eric, are you okay?

478
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:45,625
Yes.

479
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,752
Are you sure?

480
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,625
I just had some bad news.

481
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,258
I'll be all right.

482
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:59,131
This is a self expanding
Kayuga steel baton.

483
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,427
It can be used closed and concealed,

484
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,521
or you can whip it out

485
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,432
and use it for more effectiveness.

486
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,066
Make no mistake.

487
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,937
Either way, it is versatile and deadly.

488
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,981
A weapon you can't afford
not to learn and master.

489
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,120
You two.

490
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,620
Get started.

491
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,699
(tense music)

492
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,624
(batons clanging)

493
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,510
[Warbeck] Next position.

494
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,144
Okay.

495
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,639
Hojo, make your move now.

496
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:51,725
Hojo, be stealthy.

497
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,359
Billy, go!

498
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:54,904
Pick it up.

499
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,404
Alexander.

500
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,489
That's it.

501
00:30:58,899 --> 00:30:59,909
Position three.

502
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,410
Better, gentlemen.

503
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,910
Better.

504
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,865
(ominous music)

505
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,465
Doesn't this look good?

506
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,128
You finished yours already?

507
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,021
Think you're pretty tough, don't you?

508
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:22,882
Is that hostility I detect?

509
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,892
You're gonna detect this, pal.

510
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:32,975
Let me introduce myself.

511
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,120
You might be able to
beat that silly machine,

512
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:37,229
but that doesn't mean
you can really scrap.

513
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:38,989
I couldn't agree more.

514
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,616
Well, then, let's do it.

515
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,701
Do what?

516
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:42,743
Fight.

517
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:43,744
What for?

518
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,246
It's what I do.

519
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:50,242
(man grunts)
(plate rattles)

520
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,747
(table clangs)

521
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,250
I'm gonna rip off your head!

522
00:31:58,584 --> 00:31:59,635
Don't you think we need
to do a little warm-up

523
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:00,761
before we start?

524
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:01,595
What?

525
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,264
You know, a little jogging,

526
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,182
something to loosen up the legs.

527
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:09,470
(man grunts)

528
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,063
And one.

529
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:11,897
And two.

530
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:12,732
- Hey, hey.
- And three.

531
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,400
Break it up, that's enough.

532
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,693
Okay, man. Okay, man.

533
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:16,736
I'm cool, I'm cool.

534
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,612
I don't know what came over him.

535
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,691
(tense music)

536
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,702
Okay, it's clear.

537
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,345
(beeping)
Slowly.

538
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:48,726
I hate this techno-crap.

539
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:51,637
Why don't they make keys like
they make for normal locks?

540
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,976
(beeping)

541
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:03,482
(tense music)

542
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,290
Where do you think you're going?

543
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,242
This area is off limits.

544
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,543
I'm calling security.

545
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,170
No, you're not.

546
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,415
(Vicki grunts)

547
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,048
Get off me!

548
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,093
Shut up!

549
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,462
You shut your mouth for two minutes.

550
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,096
Two minutes only.

551
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,801
[Justin] We have to get
into Warbeck's files, okay?

552
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,305
There's more to Warbeck than you think.

553
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,269
(tense music)

554
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,908
Sit down and shut up.

555
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,037
Don't move.

556
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,829
Doesn't anybody use papers anymore?

557
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,715
You've been out of touch.

558
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,215
Way out.

559
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,921
(computer beeps)

560
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,476
What do you think all this is worth?

561
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,803
Hundred million, maybe more.

562
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,356
He can afford it.

563
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,108
Not teaching martial arts.

564
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:19,942
Exactly.

565
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,019
Now let's find out what he's up to.

566
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,896
Without a password...

567
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,822
I'll need to find a back door.

568
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,326
(computer beeps)

569
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,826
It's no good.

570
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,863
I've got to create a new password.

571
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:34,790
While you do that, I'm gonna go around

572
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:39,078
and see what I can find
without using the computer.

573
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,334
(computer beeps)

574
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:55,344
(men grunting)
(batons clanging)

575
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:01,642
(tense music)

576
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,170
That should do it.

577
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,799
(alarm beeps)

578
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,310
Keep training.

579
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,720
Let the enforcers handle it.

580
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,849
(suspenseful music)

581
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,562
He is running an assassination business.

582
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,030
There is enough evidence here

583
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,232
to put him away for 10 lifetimes.

584
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:51,325
What?

585
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,110
This whole school is a front.

586
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,203
Now that we've got the evidence,

587
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:56,405
all we have to do is stroll out of here.

588
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:57,831
Oh, shoot.

589
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,331
What's wrong?

590
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,750
You didn't...

591
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:05,139
Damn it, Vicki, I told you to trust me.

592
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,457
I thought you were industrial spies!

593
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,252
(intense music)

594
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,554
Where's Justin?

595
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:20,312
Oh, there he is.

596
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,938
Wait, look, look.

597
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,191
Justin.

598
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,359
Security's onto us.

599
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,144
Get out of there now!

600
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,777
Now!

601
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,826
Let's lock all the doors.

602
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,739
(computer beeps)

603
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,950
(banging)

604
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,758
Get out of the way!

605
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:51,969
(computer beeps)

606
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:52,803
Yes!

607
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,471
We'll use the other door.

608
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,466
(suspenseful music)

609
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:04,356
I've got it.

610
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,391
- Right.
- Let's go.

611
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,019
(tense music)

612
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,857
(Justin yells)

613
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,734
That's my passcard.

614
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,495
Leave the rest to me now.

615
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:19,995
Gimme the disk.

616
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:21,915
Why?

617
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,292
Trust me.

618
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:25,043
Jordan was my friend, too.

619
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,665
It's been real nice knowing you.

620
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,921
(suspenseful music)

621
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,887
(men grunting)

622
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,486
[Man] Hey, that's him!

623
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:03,573
(suspenseful music)

624
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:11,331
(men grunting)

625
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,390
Come on.

626
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,638
(men grunting)

627
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,490
You too?

628
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:44,906
(intense music)

629
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,022
That virtual reality stuff is crap.

630
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,115
Let me show you the real thing.

631
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,069
(intense music)

632
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,780
(men grunting)

633
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,273
Come on, come on.

634
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:06,655
(intense music)
(men grunting)

635
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,387
Hey, Justin!

636
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:28,977
[Justin] Did you find any evidence?

637
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,477
It's all on disk.

638
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:35,607
Jump for it.

639
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:37,978
(arrow fires)

640
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,611
Justin.

641
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,191
(arrow fires)

642
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,453
Good shooting, Damian.

643
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:52,292
(bodies thudding)

644
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,293
I'll dispose of them.

645
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,287
Hmm, not yet.

646
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,414
They have something to give us first.

647
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:00,041
Let the computer have them for a while.

648
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,895
When the computer has all their moves,

649
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,795
then you can dispose of them.

650
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,395
(Vicki types)

651
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,815
(computer beeps)

652
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:28,069
(ominous music)
(beeping)

653
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,162
Well, big boy.

654
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,031
You're in for a real ride.

655
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:35,327
(ominous music)

656
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,512
Show us your best move, hotshot.

657
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,184
(Eric groans)

658
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:04,606
(computer beeps)

659
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,119
Justin!

660
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:09,953
Eric, where are you?

661
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,697
I can hear you, but I can't see you.

662
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,036
This damn thing is locked on me.

663
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,254
How are we feeling?

664
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,754
[Eric] Go to hell!

665
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:23,917
There's no need to be rude.

666
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,714
(Eric groans)

667
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:33,093
(electricity surges)

668
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,726
Please stand.

669
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:38,640
I hate this computer stuff.

670
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,851
Who do you want for
their first opponent?

671
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,946
I don't know, Damian.

672
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,447
Who do you have in mind?

673
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,234
Well, I've always favored Fango.

674
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:50,243
Oh, Fango.

675
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:51,786
Excellent choice.

676
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:56,032
(computer beeps)

677
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,170
(Fango yells)

678
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,706
(men grunting)

679
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:27,272
(computer beeps)

680
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:34,404
If Eric broke into this,
he's a better hacker than I am.

681
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:39,492
(intense music)
(men grunting)

682
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,111
Warbeck.

683
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:10,065
Is that all you got?

684
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,283
[Warbeck] Of course not, Justin.

685
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:12,825
Try one of these.

686
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,535
Do you like that?

687
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:18,907
(electricity surges)

688
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,913
(computer beeps)

689
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,546
Oh, man.

690
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,133
Maybe.

691
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,674
(Vicki types)

692
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:38,517
You're late.

693
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,146
I'm sorry about that.

694
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,473
What do you wanna do with these two?

695
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:44,983
Well, I hate to leave all this fun,

696
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,851
but Goldberg is more important.

697
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:52,156
Work 'em 'til they drop.

698
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:54,659
Thank you.

699
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,536
Thank you very much.

700
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,703
(men grunting)

701
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:11,927
Hoo hoo, woo!

702
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:12,761
Woo hoo!

703
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:14,261
Woo hoo!

704
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,351
Main monitor on.

705
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,934
Goldberg program on.

706
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,813
(computer beeps)

707
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:33,707
Has everything gone as planned, Damian?

708
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,450
[Damian] We're ready for anything.

709
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,194
(computer beeps)

710
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,922
(intense music)

711
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:16,149
(men grunting)

712
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:25,208
Woo hoo!

713
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:26,708
Woo!

714
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:30,079
(men grunting)

715
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,294
Think you are pretty good, eh?

716
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:38,387
Give me the great man, please.

717
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,512
(men grunting)

718
00:46:59,234 --> 00:46:59,993
(computer beeps)

719
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:01,493
Oh, my God.

720
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,164
That's just two hours away.

721
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:06,032
God, I've gotta tell Eric.

722
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,458
Right.

723
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:12,038
Okay, let's make this a
little more interesting.

724
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:16,459
(computer beeps)
(dramatic music)

725
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:17,761
Justin.

726
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:18,887
If I don't get outta here and you do,

727
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:21,005
you make sure you express
to Warbeck how I feel.

728
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:21,973
Count on it.

729
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,308
You do the same for me, okay?

730
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:24,808
You got it.

731
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:30,265
(intense music)
(thunder rumbles)

732
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:36,988
Hi.

733
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,490
I'm having trouble opening this.

734
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,116
Could you help me, please?

735
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,947
(computer beeps)

736
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,534
(intense music)

737
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:51,168
You'll see!

738
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,913
(men grunting)

739
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:01,337
(dramatic music)

740
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,307
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

741
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:05,850
Wa hoo hoo!

742
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,350
Woo!

743
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:10,471
(men grunting)

744
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,707
Hey, you are not allowed in this area.

745
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:23,702
Abort this program.

746
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:25,862
You are making a serious
mistake, young lady.

747
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:28,406
(man grunts)

748
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:42,554
(beeping)

749
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,054
Are you all right?

750
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,599
God, I thought you were dead.

751
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:48,810
So did I.

752
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,478
Look, we don't have much time.

753
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,347
Warbeck is gonna assassinate Goldberg.

754
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,857
Let's get Justin.

755
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:55,233
Come on.

756
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,727
(tense music)

757
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:04,192
(beeping)

758
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:05,326
[Vicki] Hey, how you feelin'?

759
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,327
I'm okay.

760
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,655
Warbeck's going to assassinate Goldberg.

761
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:10,373
That man is our star witness.

762
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:11,791
[Eric] Where's Warbeck now?

763
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:12,876
I don't know.

764
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:14,716
But I just saw Damian and Alexander leave

765
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,004
a little while ago.

766
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:18,414
You guys, help me take this crap off.

767
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:19,382
All right, come on.

768
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:20,882
Let's go.

769
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,389
Is this your truck?

770
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:27,889
Yeah, so?

771
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,389
(engine revs)

772
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,018
(tires screeching)

773
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:41,729
(gate explodes)

774
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,857
(suspenseful music)

775
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:52,281
All right, everybody
move into position one.

776
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,715
There are four people inside.

777
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,794
Goldberg and three cops.

778
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:07,387
Yes, I heard.

779
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,133
All right, let's not have any slip ups.

780
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:12,101
This should only take a minute.

781
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,762
We've done this a dozen times.

782
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:16,806
So let's not make any mistakes.

783
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:21,728
Spyder and I will
approach from this side.

784
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,563
Let me know when you're in position.

785
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:27,316
(tense music)

786
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:35,575
You do have the rest of
the money with you, correct?

787
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,208
Right here.

788
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:39,829
Have we got the target on screen?

789
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:40,922
[Damian] Negative.

790
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:42,802
No one's gonna in or out since we arrived.

791
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,467
Goldberg's in there, alright.

792
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,502
Level the entire
building and get back here.

793
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:49,047
No, I want proof that
Goldberg's in there.

794
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,133
I'm not paying three million
to see you blow up a shed.

795
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:54,052
I want to see him die.

796
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,554
Mr. Bromfield, I don't recommend

797
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,931
that you tell me how to
conduct my operation.

798
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:01,234
It's not healthy.

799
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:03,936
I see him die or the deal's off.

800
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:10,909
Very well.

801
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,036
Sit down.

802
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,083
Hold on, Damian.

803
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:19,577
You and the others remain
in your current positions.

804
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,954
We have a request that
the execution be seen.

805
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,250
(tense music)

806
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:40,899
Hey, Frank.

807
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,392
Twenty bucks says your
replacements are gonna be late.

808
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:47,946
You're on.

809
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:52,026
Um, they're already late.

810
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,163
What?

811
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:56,664
They still got 10 minutes.

812
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:58,207
He changed your watch.

813
00:51:58,407 --> 00:51:59,542
(laughing)

814
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,042
You shits.

815
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:02,587
Great!

816
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,463
Wonderful, wonderful.

817
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:08,217
I hate babysitting.

818
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,345
Ah, put yourself in his shoes.

819
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:12,096
You'd be scared shitless, too.

820
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,174
(tense music)

821
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,913
(gun cocks)

822
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,419
Brace yourself, Mr. Bromfield.

823
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:05,683
(dramatic music)

824
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:12,857
I still want to see Goldberg dead.

825
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:15,535
It's painfully obvious you're not

826
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:17,495
cut out for this, Mr. Bromfield.

827
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:19,830
You don't have to watch.

828
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,417
I'll be fine.

829
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:27,747
(tense music)

830
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:38,424
What's taking him so long?

831
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:43,980
I'll check it out.

832
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,474
(tense music)

833
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:02,448
Don't play games, Frank.

834
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,160
(tense music)

835
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:27,523
[Warbeck] Alexander.

836
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,768
He's directly behind
you, gun in right hand.

837
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:32,987
All right, Frank,

838
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:34,814
I'll give you your 20 bucks back.

839
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,278
(car honks)

840
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,131
Hope you guys got a toilet.

841
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,799
Yeah, in there.

842
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,670
Three more cops have just arrived.

843
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:00,515
If you guys were any later,

844
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:03,092
I'd have to send a
search party out for you.

845
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,729
Commence the execution.

846
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,565
(suspenseful music)
(gun cocks)

847
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:20,276
(gun fires)
(glass shatters)

848
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:22,820
(man groans)

849
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:28,242
(guns firing)

850
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:31,120
(dramatic music)

851
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,376
(Goldberg groans)

852
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,254
(glass shatters)

853
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:45,475
Man in the window.

854
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:47,895
(gun fires)

855
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,638
[Spyder] I have a clear shot.

856
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,107
Take him.

857
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:55,478
(gun fires)
(man groans)

858
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,111
Not bad, Spyder.

859
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:05,654
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

860
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,879
(glass shatters)

861
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:15,206
(gun fires)

862
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,542
(man groans)

863
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:25,098
(neck breaking)

864
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:27,894
You sure this is the place?

865
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:28,769
[Alex] Yes.

866
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:31,430
(gun fires)

867
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:34,392
(window shatters)

868
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,438
Well, this was unaccounted for.

869
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:41,908
Stay down!

870
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:44,235
(gun fires)

871
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,447
Man, did you bring a gun?

872
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:49,999
Didn't you?

873
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:51,209
I can't believe you guys were parked

874
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:52,084
in the middle of a shootout

875
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:53,711
and you didn't bring a gun.

876
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,337
I'll go get one.

877
00:56:57,206 --> 00:57:02,128
(gun fires)
(dramatic music)

878
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,299
(man grunts)

879
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,844
If they're still shooting,
Goldberg's still alive.

880
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:11,679
Oh, man!

881
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:12,813
Oh.

882
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,933
(guns firing)

883
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:18,811
(dramatic music)

884
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:22,865
Cover me!

885
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,283
I got your back!

886
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,735
(guns firing)

887
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,581
(Goldberg shrieks)

888
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,624
I'm a cop! I'm a cop!

889
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:43,135
Are you Goldberg?

890
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:44,887
Yeah, get me outta here!

891
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,514
Get down!

892
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:48,299
(guns firing)

893
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:49,433
What was that?

894
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,552
Come on, let's see some
strategy out there.

895
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:55,605
Damian.

896
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:58,809
That was an unacceptable
performance level for Alexander.

897
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:01,946
Kill him.

898
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,281
[Damian] That's a lot
of expensive training

899
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:04,782
down the drain, sir.

900
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:05,866
He knew the risks.

901
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,366
He's history.

902
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:09,820
I haven't had iguana since El Salvador.

903
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:14,492
(gun fires)
(Alexander groans)

904
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,125
Sorry, Alexander.

905
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:20,631
Vicki, you stay put.

906
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,131
I'm going to help Eric.

907
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,795
(guns firing)
(Goldberg yells)

908
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,923
Where are they?

909
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:34,053
(glass shatters)
(guns firing)

910
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:37,640
(dramatic music)

911
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:03,499
(Goldberg grunts)

912
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:51,046
(Goldberg yells)
(glass shatters)

913
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:02,182
(explosion booms)

914
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:18,833
Oh, man.

915
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:19,792
Oh, man!

916
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:21,292
Ah!

917
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,502
Eric?

918
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:27,049
Are you all right?

919
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:28,966
Where's Goldberg?

920
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,010
He went that way.

921
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:32,388
I'll get him.

922
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:33,305
Wait here.

923
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:36,050
(dramatic music)

924
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:38,602
There he is.

925
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:39,728
That's him!

926
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:42,389
Kill him. Kill him!

927
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:43,774
Move!

928
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:44,859
Damian.

929
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,235
Abort mission now.

930
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:47,736
Return to base immediately.

931
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,855
He's getting away, you can't stop now.

932
01:00:50,189 --> 01:00:51,073
It's over.

933
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,533
We'll get him later.

934
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:54,234
And you'll get your money later.

935
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:58,030
(Bromfield gasps)

936
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:00,908
There won't be a later for you.

937
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:06,664
(Goldberg yells)

938
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,215
Calm down, calm down.

939
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:09,091
Calm down, calm down.

940
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:10,050
Don't kill me, don't kill me!

941
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,093
- I'm not gonna kill you!
- Don't kill me!

942
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,470
I'm not gonna kill you.

943
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,963
(tense music)

944
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:22,888
Looks like the day
won't be a total loss.

945
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:24,522
Bring her to me.

946
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:27,893
(dramatic music)

947
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:31,614
- No!
- Calm down.

948
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:32,865
That's Goldberg.

949
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:33,908
I'm Goldberg.

950
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:35,326
I'm Goldberg.

951
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:36,952
Where's Vicki?

952
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,079
(gun fires)

953
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:40,498
- There she is.
- Come on!

954
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:42,282
I'll take that.

955
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:44,618
(grunting)

956
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,169
Let's go.

957
01:01:57,589 --> 01:02:00,008
(engine revs)

958
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:04,939
Hey!

959
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:05,773
Hey!

960
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:07,975
Don't leave me here!

961
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,610
Come on!

962
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,353
Where are the keys?

963
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:15,441
(engine revs)

964
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,243
(tires screeching)

965
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:18,944
[Damian] Sir, we're en route now.

966
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:21,455
[Warbeck] Bring the prisoner in.

967
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,081
We have a change of plans.

968
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:26,368
(dramatic music)

969
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,760
Shouldn't we radio for backup?

970
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,129
It's our mess, let's go clean it up.

971
01:02:37,463 --> 01:02:38,097
[Eric] If only you
had kept an eye on her.

972
01:02:38,297 --> 01:02:39,515
Don't even say it.

973
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:41,216
I was looking after Goldberg.

974
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,135
You should not have left her alone.

975
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:44,353
Oh, now it's my fault?

976
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:46,346
You're supposed to be protecting me,

977
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:48,932
not chasing after them!

978
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:50,566
[Both] Shut up!

979
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,480
(suspenseful music)

980
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:08,711
(Damian chokes)

981
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,087
Stop the car.

982
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,088
I don't think so.

983
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,588
Let go of him!

984
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:18,587
(dramatic music)

985
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:24,602
They're getting away.

986
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:26,103
This crate won't go any faster.

987
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:27,354
If you'd learned how to drive,

988
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:28,230
we would've gotten there by now.

989
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,440
Arguing won't help!

990
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,434
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

991
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:35,312
(dramatic music)

992
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,487
We got company.

993
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:46,114
(engine revs)

994
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:54,164
They're gaining on us.

995
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:59,169
(car honks)
(tires screeching)

996
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:00,179
[Damian] Oh, wonderful.

997
01:04:00,379 --> 01:04:01,555
A Sunday driver.

998
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,966
I'll take care of 'em.

999
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,517
Drop dead!

1000
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,845
(gun fires)

1001
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:12,099
(intense music)

1002
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,190
(tires screeching)

1003
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:24,870
Get me out of here!

1004
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:25,704
We're gonna die!

1005
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,289
Take the wheel.

1006
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:28,123
Justin.

1007
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:29,625
No, no, Justin!

1008
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:32,703
(grenades exploding)

1009
01:04:40,002 --> 01:04:41,720
[Damian] Take 'em out, now!

1010
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:47,050
(intense music)
(grenade explodes)

1011
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:48,810
Die, you scum.

1012
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,107
[Justin] Come on, get out!

1013
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:56,101
We're sitting ducks, come on!

1014
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:57,444
Goldberg.

1015
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:59,271
(tense music)

1016
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:01,156
[Spyder] Eat this.

1017
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:02,074
He got out the other side.

1018
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:03,450
[Alex] Run for it!

1019
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,361
(grenade explodes)

1020
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:11,533
(fire blazes)

1021
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:24,171
[Justin] Goldberg,
Goldberg, where you goin'?

1022
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:27,132
I would've been safer in their car!

1023
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,802
(dramatic music)

1024
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:34,512
[Damian] That oughtta
slow them down for a while.

1025
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:38,527
Let's get Warbeck.

1026
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:40,027
Come on!

1027
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:52,199
This time, I'm driving.

1028
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:53,832
It's yours.

1029
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:01,041
(car honks)

1030
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:02,960
- Hey, hey!
- Hold it, stop the car.

1031
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,836
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

1032
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:05,804
Excuse me, ma'am, we need your car.

1033
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:07,764
- Hey, hey!
- Thank you.

1034
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:09,224
Thank you, ma'am.

1035
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:10,058
It's a police business, ma'am.

1036
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:11,852
- What are you doing?
- Bye!

1037
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,763
(tires screeching)

1038
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,944
Thank you, thank you.
- What are you doing?

1039
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,566
Stop!

1040
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:22,521
That's my husband's car!

1041
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:28,660
[Warbeck] You betrayed me.

1042
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,571
You ran to my enemies
without even a thought.

1043
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:33,907
What did I do to you that was so terrible?

1044
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:35,541
You kill people.

1045
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:38,294
Yes.

1046
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,800
That's true.

1047
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:47,678
But so what?

1048
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,925
The government of this country
kills people every day.

1049
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:59,057
If the government can kill, why can't I?

1050
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:01,852
Because you're not the government.

1051
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:08,775
If I have as much
power as the government,

1052
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:12,904
then why am I so different, hmm?

1053
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:18,118
Your worldview is very
conventional, Vicki.

1054
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:20,328
I don't think you think about issues

1055
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:25,417
such as power, authority,
and the right to kill.

1056
01:07:29,046 --> 01:07:31,214
Who gives the government
the right to kill?

1057
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,018
God?

1058
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:37,186
I think not.

1059
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:39,688
The people.

1060
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:45,771
And if the government represents
the wishes of the people,

1061
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:47,981
then isn't it the people that kill?

1062
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:49,699
People like you?

1063
01:07:51,485 --> 01:07:52,785
Oh, Vicki...

1064
01:07:54,196 --> 01:07:58,742
Why can't people understand
such a simple concept?

1065
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:00,577
You are mad.

1066
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:02,211
Mad?

1067
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,254
Mad?

1068
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:13,882
What an obvious and ordinary thing to say.

1069
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:15,850
Our time here is done, Damian.

1070
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,387
Have Spyder set the charges.

1071
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,070
I know a wonderful little castle in Spain

1072
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:24,184
that will be perfect
for our new operation.

1073
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:27,062
Those two heroes will be arriving soon.

1074
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:28,989
How shall we greet them?

1075
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,525
Ah, yes. The heroes.

1076
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:32,784
Well, if we have heroes on their way,

1077
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:35,445
we must give them a damsel
in distress to rescue.

1078
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:37,489
We can arrange that, can't we?

1079
01:08:37,823 --> 01:08:39,783
A little gift for the cowboys?

1080
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:42,953
Use that wonderful
imagination of yours, Damian.

1081
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,580
(tense music)

1082
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:03,065
Eric!

1083
01:09:03,265 --> 01:09:03,982
Justin!

1084
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:04,858
[Justin] Just hang in there, Vicki.

1085
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,276
We're coming for you.

1086
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:07,110
No, you can't.

1087
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,654
What do you mean no?

1088
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:09,988
They've set bombs everywhere,

1089
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:10,989
this whole place is gonna blow.

1090
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:12,324
And you gotta get the students out!

1091
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:14,192
Well, we can't leave you here.

1092
01:09:14,526 --> 01:09:15,577
[Vicki] There's no time!

1093
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:18,155
You go for her, I'll go
for Warbeck and the bombs.

1094
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:21,208
Where are these bombs?

1095
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:22,708
The boiler room!

1096
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:26,621
(tense music)

1097
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:29,166
(bomb ticks)

1098
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:44,347
(dramatic music)

1099
01:09:47,017 --> 01:09:49,519
(men grunting)

1100
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:06,703
(bomb ticks)

1101
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:10,332
Nice place you got here.

1102
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:12,334
Nice place to die, too.

1103
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,128
(gun fires)
(dramatic music)

1104
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:17,839
(men grunting)

1105
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:56,636
Take him out.

1106
01:10:57,295 --> 01:11:02,217
(men grunting)
(intense music)

1107
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,502
Good kick.

1108
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:36,251
(intense music)
(men grunting)

1109
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,731
Oh, Justin, come on.

1110
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,574
You can do better than that.

1111
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:07,949
(dramatic music)
(men grunting)

1112
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:49,532
(tense music)

1113
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:23,525
(men grunting)

1114
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,761
Spyder, come on, hit him!

1115
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:53,395
Kick him!

1116
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:58,893
(men grunting)
(dramatic music)

1117
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:08,995
Damn it!

1118
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:10,580
Fight him!

1119
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,324
(dramatic music)

1120
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,245
(men grunting)

1121
01:14:42,187 --> 01:14:44,606
It's all over for you, chump.

1122
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:46,858
It's time for some steam cleaning.

1123
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:51,988
If you need the job done right,

1124
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,791
you gotta do it yourself.

1125
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:59,162
(dramatic music)

1126
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:03,541
(men grunting)

1127
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:16,020
Justin.

1128
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:18,564
Justin, I know you can hear.

1129
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,025
One final game.

1130
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:23,277
Just you and me.

1131
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:27,315
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

1132
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:31,995
(Warbeck chuckles)

1133
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:33,455
You're getting warmer.

1134
01:15:33,655 --> 01:15:36,282
(Warbeck cackles)

1135
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,545
Well, Mr. Virtual Reality himself.

1136
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:49,846
You're under arrest.

1137
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,131
I got your bombs and I got you now.

1138
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:53,892
You'll have to find me first.

1139
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:55,185
What are you talking about?

1140
01:15:55,385 --> 01:15:56,895
I'm taking you down right here.

1141
01:15:57,095 --> 01:15:58,563
You're not paying attention.

1142
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:00,231
You'll have to put those on.

1143
01:16:02,267 --> 01:16:04,060
I'm not playing your damn games.

1144
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:05,695
Fine.

1145
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:07,195
Then arrest me.

1146
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:12,485
(Warbeck cackles)

1147
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:16,114
My world is the electronic
universe, Justin.

1148
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,993
Do you have the courage to join me there?

1149
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:21,752
I'll meet you anywhere.

1150
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,256
I'm waiting.

1151
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,963
(Warbeck cackles)

1152
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:38,219
(eerie music)

1153
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:39,853
Warbeck!

1154
01:16:41,723 --> 01:16:43,023
I'm here.

1155
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:59,198
(Warbeck grunts)

1156
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:05,622
(mysterious music)

1157
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:09,375
(men grunting)

1158
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:19,886
(Warbeck cackles)

1159
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,522
(Warbeck cackles)

1160
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,241
By the way, Justin.

1161
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:36,486
Those bombs? You missed a few.

1162
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:39,447
(Warbeck cackles)

1163
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,954
(bomb ticks)

1164
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,832
(dramatic music)

1165
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:56,764
[Vicki] Eric!

1166
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:57,891
Vicki!

1167
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:00,635
(dramatic music)

1168
01:18:02,637 --> 01:18:04,105
Vicki, come on.

1169
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:09,977
(Eric grunts)
(dramatic music)

1170
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,326
(Vicki shrieks)

1171
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:39,090
[Warbeck] Well, look what
I've caught in my trap.

1172
01:18:39,424 --> 01:18:40,725
It's all over, Warbeck.

1173
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:41,643
Oh, no.

1174
01:18:41,843 --> 01:18:43,344
It's over for you, Justin Vanier.

1175
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:48,141
You haven't accepted the future.

1176
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:51,069
I...

1177
01:18:51,269 --> 01:18:53,563
I represent the new human being.

1178
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,606
One that will thrive in the new world,

1179
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,984
where information is valued above all.

1180
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:02,405
My knowledge is stored.

1181
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:04,574
Not only in my brain,

1182
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:06,784
but in a global network of computers.

1183
01:19:07,118 --> 01:19:08,586
I am more than my body.

1184
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:12,582
I am in my body and outside my body.

1185
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,834
The world belongs to me.

1186
01:19:15,168 --> 01:19:16,711
Your world is dead, look at it!

1187
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:18,713
Nothing's real.
(Warbeck cackles)

1188
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:20,673
You can't know my world, Justin.

1189
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:24,427
But it is as real as yours.

1190
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:26,937
The only difference is...

1191
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:31,267
I am in complete control.

1192
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:36,272
(Warbeck cackles)

1193
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:40,193
(electricity sparks)
(explosion booms)

1194
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:43,404
(electricity sparks)

1195
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:47,158
(tense music)

1196
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,586
(men grunting)

1197
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:05,101
Expect no mercy.

1198
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,679
(dramatic music)

1199
01:20:14,227 --> 01:20:15,978
(Damian laughs)

1200
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:17,488
I'm glad it's you, Damian.

1201
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:18,781
You won't be.

1202
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:20,733
(Damian laughs)

1203
01:20:21,067 --> 01:20:22,493
Come on, hotshot!

1204
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:25,071
(men grunting)

1205
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:31,577
(dramatic music)

1206
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:27,717
That's a very bad habit you have,

1207
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,393
killing people, you know.

1208
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,388
Sometimes, I really enjoy it.

1209
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:34,315
Like when I did Jordan.

1210
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:36,100
Now that was a lot of fun.

1211
01:21:38,853 --> 01:21:41,647
(Damian chuckles)

1212
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:43,574
Vicki!
(Damian chuckles)

1213
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:46,235
(Damian groans)

1214
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:51,115
I was really expecting
much more from you, Justin.

1215
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,327
I guess heroes aren't
what they used to be.

1216
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,708
This is one opponent you can't shut off.

1217
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,463
(men grunting)

1218
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:24,732
(dramatic music)
(men grunting)

1219
01:22:58,349 --> 01:23:00,935
(intense music)

1220
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:32,508
You surprised me.

1221
01:23:32,842 --> 01:23:34,593
I didn't think you were this good.

1222
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:35,561
You surprised me.

1223
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:37,263
I didn't know you could think.

1224
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:42,268
(Damian yells)

1225
01:23:44,228 --> 01:23:46,564
(body thuds)

1226
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:51,285
(dramatic music)

1227
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:52,453
Eric! Eric!

1228
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:53,996
Vicki, Vicki!

1229
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:55,496
Grab the rope!

1230
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:03,629
Hang on.

1231
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:07,460
(dramatic music)

1232
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,110
God.

1233
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:39,450
Let's get outta here.

1234
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:44,538
(intense music)
(men grunting)

1235
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:59,595
Everybody evacuate, the
building's gonna blow!

1236
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:01,480
(alarm rings)

1237
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:06,477
(men grunting)
(intense music)

1238
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:17,738
(people chattering)

1239
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:41,595
(Warbeck groans)

1240
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,027
Welcome back to reality.

1241
01:25:57,361 --> 01:26:00,239
(bomb ticks)

1242
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:05,077
(bomb explodes)
(glass shatters)

1243
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:08,205
(dramatic music)

1244
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:11,333
(people chattering)

1245
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,922
- Hey!
- Hey, Justin!

1246
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:17,932
Did you get the bombs?

1247
01:26:18,132 --> 01:26:18,766
There wasn't enough time,

1248
01:26:18,966 --> 01:26:20,593
we better get out of here!

1249
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:23,554
(bombs exploding)

1250
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:27,808
(people screaming)

1251
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:39,111
(intense music)

1252
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:01,610
And Warbeck? He's gonna
have a different view

1253
01:27:01,634 --> 01:27:03,060
for a long time.

1254
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,812
Computer warlord.

1255
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:05,896
Were you ever worried?

1256
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:06,981
Me?

1257
01:27:07,181 --> 01:27:07,982
Are you serious?

1258
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:09,650
I think Warbeck was only the first

1259
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,352
in a whole new breed of criminal.

1260
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:12,985
The cyber criminal.

1261
01:27:13,354 --> 01:27:14,654
And now it's over.

1262
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:18,157
Or is it?

1263
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:21,612
(intense music)
