1
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,119
Your grandmother's grandfather

2
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:23,090
came out here in 1873
after the Civil War.

3
00:00:28,997 --> 00:00:31,566
Family lore has it
when he topped Johnson Mesa

4
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,467
and he looked down
at this valley

5
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:38,438
and saw buffalo and antelope
belly deep in a sea of grass,

6
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:40,842
with the Sangre de Christos
behind him,

7
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:42,544
he knew this was it.

8
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,680
Your people have
been here ever since.

9
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:58,726
Now me, I was born in Louisiana,

10
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,695
came out here after the war.

11
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:05,132
I was a wandering soul,
looking for a North Star.

12
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:10,638
And I found it right here in
this valley along this river.

13
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,144
To me, this is the Peace River.

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,616
I feel peace
every time I look at it.

15
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,418
Casey, what you want to
be when you grow up?

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,221
A cowboy, just like you, Pop.

17
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:35,128
Well, you come from
a long line of cowboys.

18
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,800
The cowboy loves big
sky and open range.

19
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:43,270
Works hard,
is a man of his word.

20
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,139
Loyal to his friends and family.

21
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:50,210
Treats everyone with respect,
especially women.

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,584
Is courageous,
fearing God and no man.

23
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,556
Don't ever forget
what's important.

24
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,693
Friendship with God.
Family. Friends.

25
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:11,298
Meaningful work
and one good horse.

26
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:19,107
Never make the mistake
of measuring wealth by money.

27
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,508
You do that,

28
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:23,745
and you'll be a rich man
and a good cowboy.

29
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,914
That's what I want to be.

30
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:38,626
I met your grandmother
on the spring round-up.

31
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:42,429
I loved her from
the first time I saw her.

32
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:45,700
The love of a good woman
can save your life.

33
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,903
When I came back from the war,

34
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:52,540
I had shrapnel in places
the doctors couldn't get to.

35
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,242
The doctor said
I better live well

36
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,812
because I probably
wouldn't live long.

37
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:01,248
Son, that was 40 years ago,

38
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,216
and I ain't dead yet.

39
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,021
Be thankful.

40
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:09,757
Always be thankful.

41
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:18,833
All right.
No peeking. No peeking.

42
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:24,505
All right.
You ready?

43
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,673
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,945
Well, what do you think?

45
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,680
He's beautiful.

46
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,817
Well, you know,
at the end of the day,

47
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,317
cowboy in' is teamwork.

48
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,253
Cowboy is only as good
as his horse.

49
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,422
So I've been looking for
your one for a while.

50
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:44,592
I think this may be the one.

51
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,830
Now, listen, he got
a lot of cow in him,

52
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:51,032
so don't you be trying
to teach him anything.

53
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:54,068
If you pay attention,
he'll teach you something.

54
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:55,368
Okay?

55
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,471
All right.
Go see what you think.

56
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,786
His name is Pecos.

57
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,963
Hey, Pecos.
I'm Casey.

58
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,933
And I'm gonna take
good care of you.

59
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:33,040
Casey, slow it down, buddy.

60
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:34,609
Okay, that's it.

61
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:48,823
Hey, you kids stick together.

62
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,758
No running!

63
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,394
Those kids were born running.

64
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,272
That'll be two bits.

65
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,074
Drop it in
Bo's jar on the way out.

66
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,309
Little Casey had a head start.

67
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,945
Two bits all the same.

68
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:17,285
- Hey, Casey.
- Oh, no.

69
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,289
I guess you Shanes will take
in any strays, even beaners.

70
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,723
You are so stupid.

71
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:25,560
That's funny,
coming from a fence jumper.

72
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:34,467
Mr. Shane, I appreciate
you coming in today.

73
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,938
Yesterday on the playground,
there was an altercation

74
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,338
with your grandson.

75
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,709
We have a zero tolerance
policy for fighting.

76
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:44,011
He needs to be suspended
for a day.

77
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,881
I don't understand.

78
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,516
What did I do wrong?

79
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,919
Well, Case,
you had good intentions

80
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:54,755
of defending Maria's
dignity and honor.

81
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,425
But the problem is,
you delivered the first blow.

82
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,195
There's only two blows a cowboy

83
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:02,897
ought to deliver for sure.

84
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,733
That's the second one
and the last one.

85
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,836
You know, if everybody responded

86
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,806
to every verbal provocation
in this world,

87
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,876
civilization would come unglued.

88
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,689
You okay?

89
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:32,660
Grandma, you reckon
he's still mad at me?

90
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,763
Heck, no, he ain't mad at you.

91
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,901
Casey, that man loves you
more than you can know.

92
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:45,773
He just wants you to be
a kind and a strong man.

93
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,483
Hey, little buddy.

94
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,520
What you looking at there?

95
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,229
What was my daddy like?

96
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,900
Man, your daddy
was something else.

97
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,836
Full of life and laughter.

98
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,339
As the cowboys would say,
he was a man

99
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,974
to ride the river with.

100
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,743
What a cowboy.

101
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,880
That boy could ride
the hair off a bull.

102
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:04,552
And you know,
when I look at you,

103
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,622
I often think
I'm looking at him.

104
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,996
Why did God let my daddy die?

105
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:21,602
Case, there are some things
in this life that

106
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:24,505
it's hard
to understand or explain.

107
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,208
We just have to...

108
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,011
trust in God.

109
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:35,182
I believe God is, and he's good
in all that he does.

110
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,818
I believe there's a heaven.

111
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:41,689
And someday you
and me and Grandma

112
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:44,625
and your mom will be
with your dad in heaven.

113
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,330
So, Lord, I thank You for Casey.

114
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:53,300
I pray that You give him
the dreams of God tonight.

115
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,604
We thank You for our loved ones

116
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,706
pray that
You watch over them all.

117
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,710
- In Jesus name, Amen.
- Amen.

118
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,112
All right, little man.

119
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:07,681
Get you some rest.

120
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,917
Morning comes early for cowboys.

121
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:22,229
Ooh! Not a bad
ride there by Dakota Shaw.

122
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,163
Let's give him a round
of applause, everybody,

123
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:26,410
and thank you for coming out
today for Cimarron's Youth...

124
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:28,903
Who are these parents
who let these kids ride bulls?

125
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,771
Up next in his debut ride,

126
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:34,341
Cimarron's own Casey Shane.

127
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,611
Did you do this?

128
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,265
I was just sitting
over here wondering,

129
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,749
who are these parents
who let these kids ride bulls?

130
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:59,200
Go, Casey!

131
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,239
Woo!

132
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:09,743
On his debut ride...

133
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:13,747
Casey Shane!

134
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,396
Out back.

135
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,404
Get lower.

136
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:19,473
I can't crawl as low as you.

137
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:20,941
Why not?

138
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,944
Do I need to draw
you a picture, dummy?

139
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,682
One of these days,
you'll be glad

140
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,950
I can't crawl as low as you.

141
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,322
Shoot the big buck on the right.

142
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,867
Shoot.
I missed him.

143
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:49,436
No.
No, you got him.

144
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:02,983
You shoot him, you skin him.

145
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,353
You are a cowgirl, aren't you?

146
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:12,252
I've loved you my whole life.

147
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:16,591
I could never love anyone
other than you.

148
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,295
I love you forever.

149
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,156
You know, Pop...

150
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,527
been thinking a little
more about it lately.

151
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:57,565
I think I might just join
the Army after graduation.

152
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:02,169
Casey, this family's

153
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,938
done enough military service
for several families.

154
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,440
You don't have to do that.

155
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,843
Pop, I know the family's
done enough,

156
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,411
but I ain't done enough.

157
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:13,882
What about college and rodeo?

158
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,884
See, I figure this way,

159
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,218
get the service out of the way,

160
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,187
before I got me a wife.

161
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,055
Couple grandkids for you, huh?

162
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:23,601
You know,
there's a little prerequisite

163
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,360
to that kid's deal.
You got anybody in mind?

164
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:30,097
Ah, I figured Maria
would do. Huh?

165
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,567
Boy, I sure do like that
little lady.

166
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:36,170
Case, it's a profound
and powerful thing

167
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,439
to stand on the wall
for your country.

168
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,476
Not something to be entered
into lightly.

169
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,348
The young men
we send into battle

170
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:51,586
are riding point
into the gates of hell.

171
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,353
You gotta be ready for it.

172
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:55,956
You gotta take
Almighty God with you.

173
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:58,827
It's a serious decision,

174
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,328
something you need
to be ready for.

175
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:02,229
Yes, sir.

176
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,064
You think you're ready?

177
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,668
Yes, sir.

178
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,671
I'm gonna tell you what:

179
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:11,038
I believe in you.

180
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,508
You know, you're a good man.

181
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,977
Whatever you decide,
I'm gonna support it.

182
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:21,148
Thanks, Pop.

183
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:41,435
I know.

184
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:44,271
- You know.
- I'm late.

185
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,275
Maria, I've been thinking.

186
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,310
Well, now, that's a scary thing.

187
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:56,684
No, it's about us
and the future.

188
00:16:57,685 --> 00:17:00,087
Are you trying to propose to me?

189
00:17:02,824 --> 00:17:05,144
More like wanting to know if
you're willing to wait for me.

190
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,427
Willing to wait for you
to do what?

191
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:11,064
I'm joining the Army
after graduation.

192
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,215
Maria, four generations
of Shane men have served

193
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,106
and I can't break that chain.

194
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:24,746
Casey, God doesn't want you
to do something for me.

195
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:29,216
He wants you to be the man
that he created you to be.

196
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,824
Would I wait?

197
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:43,430
I wouldn't like it.

198
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,399
But yes.

199
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,902
- Yes?
- I'd wait.

200
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:49,571
- You'll wait?
- Yeah.

201
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,788
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

202
00:17:57,812 --> 00:18:00,213
<i>to the National
High School Finals Rodeo.</i>

203
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,665
All right, Casey.

204
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:21,468
All the big
rodeo colleges are here

205
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:24,204
and they're talking
about you, son.

206
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,610
PBR's here too sniffing around,
looking for talent.

207
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:31,378
And you've drawn

208
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:35,282
a really good bull tonight
for this go round.

209
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:38,019
I want you to stick
your toes out, hang your spurs

210
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:42,222
in his hide and ride like
Old Freckles Brown on Tornado.

211
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,359
How are you feeling, Maria?

212
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,196
Good.
Little nervous.

213
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:51,833
There'd be something wrong

214
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:53,701
if you weren't just
a little bit nervous.

215
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:07,649
<i>And as we go to our barrel race</i>

216
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:09,383
<i>here this evening,
the ladies barrel race</i>

217
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:11,077
<i>coming down the alley
for you right now,</i>

218
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,420
<i>the young lady has had an
outstanding year,</i>

219
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:15,322
<i>has been moving up
in the rankings</i>

220
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,091
<i>and the standings
each and every week.</i>

221
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:20,728
<i>We hope that it culminates
right here this week,</i>

222
00:19:20,862 --> 00:19:24,098
<i>the National Finals rodeo
for these young men and women.</i>

223
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,667
<i>So, here we go, Maria Martinez,</i>

224
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,436
<i>the Mexico Cowgirl
and this first barrel.</i>

225
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,839
<i>Looking good,
six seconds right now.</i>

226
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:34,274
<i>We go to number two,
still standing.</i>

227
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:36,476
<i>Around it we go,</i>

228
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:38,513
<i>and it's a horse race
back to the house,</i>

229
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:42,984
<i>and in with... a 16:58.</i>

230
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:46,219
<i>Oh, look out, leader board,
that might change.</i>

231
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:49,891
<i>And as we go to the bucking
chutes for the next one,</i>

232
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:51,726
<i>it's gonna be Casey Shane,</i>

233
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,529
<i>the young man that we've been
talking about all week long.</i>

234
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:57,297
<i>This kid has exploded
here tonight.</i>

235
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,232
<i>Nods his head, and here we go.</i>

236
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,669
<i>Pulling it out.
Attaboy.</i>

237
00:20:01,803 --> 00:20:02,670
<i>Perfect moves...</i>

238
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:04,105
Casey, go!
Casey, go...

239
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,107
<i>And here we go.</i>

240
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,909
<i>Look out, there's the horn...</i>

241
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:11,178
Whoa!

242
00:20:12,814 --> 00:20:14,058
<i>So, what do you think,
ladies and gentlemen?</i>

243
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:15,616
<i>High 80s, low 90s?</i>

244
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,985
<i>You tell me
and the judges will tell us.</i>

245
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,822
<i>And let's go to that
little Mexico Cowgirl...</i>

246
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:25,827
<i>Maria Martinez,
through the first.</i>

247
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,227
<i>Looking good.</i>

248
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,253
<i>All right, to the bucking
chutes we go for the young man</i>

249
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:46,714
<i>who had an outstanding ride
in round number one.</i>

250
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:48,458
<i>Let's see if he can
back it up here tonight.</i>

251
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:50,118
<i>Got a good bull,
maybe not as good</i>

252
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,419
<i>as that first one he had,
but a good bull nonetheless.</i>

253
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,021
<i>Nods his head.</i>

254
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:55,656
<i>Bald-faced bull.</i>

255
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,658
<i>Yeah, a lot of buck.
A lot of buck.</i>

256
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:00,161
<i>Turning back right about there.</i>

257
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,329
<i>Into his hands. Oh, look out,
look out, look out.</i>

258
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,031
<i>Into the well he goes.</i>

259
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:09,103
<i>Go get him, boys.
Help him, help him.</i>

260
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:11,438
<i>Oh. All over him.</i>

261
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,775
<i>Let's see what happens.</i>

262
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:15,586
<i>We got to see what happened
on him right here.</i>

263
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,845
<i>He's holding
that arm a little bit.</i>

264
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:19,914
<i>I am getting confirmation,
though,</i>

265
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:21,983
<i>it was an 8-second ride.</i>

266
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:23,584
<i>I think we're in business.</i>

267
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:26,386
<i>So he's two up, two down,
two in the books.</i>

268
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:28,055
<i>But they got to check him out.</i>

269
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,259
It's gonna be all right, Casey.

270
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,560
Hey, everybody.

271
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,896
Hey, Casey, got some bad news.

272
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,296
We got your results back.

273
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,132
You have a fracture
of the radius.

274
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:39,901
It's not all the way through,

275
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:41,536
but it's structurally
compromised.

276
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:44,172
You're not gonna be able
to ride in the finals.

277
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,706
Sorry.

278
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:54,182
Hey, Doc, what's the lightest
and strongest cast you got?

279
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:57,752
I know what you're thinking,
son, it's not a good idea.

280
00:21:57,885 --> 00:21:59,821
Man, if you rebreak this arm,

281
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:02,290
you could have some
serious permanent damage.

282
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:03,658
No, but, look, hey.

283
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,760
I got another one
that looks just like it.

284
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:08,395
You're not ambidextrous,
are you?

285
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:09,831
Well, I wasn't until today.

286
00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:12,667
So, come on, Doc,
give me the best you got.

287
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:19,006
Okay, Maria,
you've got your strategy

288
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,642
all worked out and settled
in your mind?

289
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:23,978
Well, yeah, but I don't
think I can take the lead

290
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:25,646
with a standard run.

291
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,083
I want to go for the win.

292
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:30,450
That's my girl.

293
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,371
<i>All right,
let's go to the young lady</i>

294
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,957
<i>that is still in the hunt
for that aggregate title.</i>

295
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,458
<i>She came in close
in the second round.</i>

296
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:41,461
<i>Here she comes for number three.</i>

297
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:46,701
<i>Maria Martinez
through the first.</i>

298
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:49,402
<i>Around it, good.</i>

299
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:50,938
<i>Oh, this is looking good.</i>

300
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:53,174
<i>Headed to number two,
tight, best barrel</i>

301
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:57,712
<i>of the performance so far,
now the elusive number three,</i>

302
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:59,580
<i>it's the money barrel.</i>

303
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:02,216
<i>Oh, oh, oh no!
She didn't need that.</i>

304
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,620
<i>No, no, no. It's a penalty
of five seconds.</i>

305
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:07,688
<i>That's going to hurt her
in that average</i>

306
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:10,157
<i>and take her completely
out of this run.</i>

307
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,759
Hey, girl.

308
00:23:13,094 --> 00:23:18,465
Look, it's a sport
of inches and microseconds.

309
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,669
You did the right thing.

310
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,436
Hold your head up.

311
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:26,173
I'm so proud of you.

312
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:31,503
<i>Now, ladies
and gentlemen, we just got</i>

313
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:33,748
<i>confirmation that Casey Shane</i>

314
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:35,761
<i>is the national High School
champion bull rider.</i>

315
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,789
<i>But he is going to go ahead
and get on this last bull.</i>

316
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:43,524
<i>So I guess it's true.</i>

317
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:47,094
<i>You can't keep
a good cowboy down.</i>

318
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:52,900
<i>New Mexico's own Casey Shane
glides up on the rope.</i>

319
00:23:57,605 --> 00:23:59,407
<i>Nods his head, and here we go.</i>

320
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,942
<i>Looking good.
No, no, no.</i>

321
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:03,344
<i>Get on him, on him, on him.</i>

322
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:04,912
<i>Reach, grab, no.</i>

323
00:24:05,046 --> 00:24:06,847
Still the champ.
Still the champ.

324
00:24:08,616 --> 00:24:10,751
<i>...is still your</i>

325
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:14,288
<i>National High School
bull riding champion.</i>

326
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:15,423
<i>How about it</i>

327
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:19,427
<i>for New Mexico Casey Shane?</i>

328
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:35,285
Hey, we should go celebrate
tonight, what do you say?

329
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:37,945
I just need to go
the hotel and go to sleep.

330
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:40,982
You're not happy that I won?

331
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:45,786
Yes, for sure, but...
I'm also processing my loss.

332
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,823
I'm exhausted and I feel
upside-down inside.

333
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:52,660
And I don't know how to rejoice
and grieve at the same time.

334
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:55,930
All right. But there is
a ton of other girls

335
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:57,503
who would love to
go out with the guy

336
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:59,533
who won this
championship buckle.

337
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,669
Are you crazy?

338
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:04,038
That sounds like a threat.

339
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:09,910
Don't lose the best thing
you ever had.

340
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:23,791
Whoa!

341
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:26,961
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

342
00:25:28,162 --> 00:25:30,164
Going to the
Maverick club tonight.

343
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:45,613
You won the
national championship, man.

344
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:46,914
Time to celebrate.

345
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:48,916
Hey, I don't drink,
though, so...

346
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,851
- Never did or quit?
- Never did.

347
00:25:50,985 --> 00:25:53,154
Well, you got to try it
once in your life.

348
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,797
- One more! One more!
- Cowboy!

349
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:03,157
Maria.

350
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,326
Yeah?

351
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:09,663
There's been a lot of talk
around town that...

352
00:27:10,898 --> 00:27:12,266
Casey two-timed you.

353
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:14,735
Are you sure?

354
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,472
I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

355
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:21,175
but as your friend, I believe
that you should know.

356
00:27:23,512 --> 00:27:24,745
Thanks.

357
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:28,649
Nobody wants to be played
for a fool.

358
00:27:41,462 --> 00:27:43,063
I heard you went out
after we parted

359
00:27:43,197 --> 00:27:45,132
the last night of the rodeo.

360
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:47,268
Yeah, I went out with
some of the guys.

361
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:03,217
You didn't have a late date?
Huh?

362
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:08,022
No.

363
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:10,991
I don't like what
I see behind those eyes.

364
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,994
Don't lie to me, Casey.

365
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,864
I'm not lying to you.

366
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:19,266
You don't think I can tell
when you're lying?

367
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:24,205
This is your fault.

368
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:27,474
My fault?
How is this...

369
00:28:32,112 --> 00:28:37,184
You dirty two-faced
faithless liar!

370
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:26,300
Juan said Maria went
to Albuquerque this morning.

371
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,469
Is there something here
I need to know?

372
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:35,242
We had a little fight.
She'll get over it.

373
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:38,221
Well, that's comforting to know.

374
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:39,490
From the looks
of that strawberry,

375
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:40,757
I would have thought it was more

376
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:41,901
than just a little squabble.

377
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,795
Take a seat.

378
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,434
So I want to be special ops.

379
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:03,003
What do I gotta do
to be one of those guys?

380
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:09,109
Let's see if you can make it
through basic training first.

381
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:13,013
There you are.

382
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:17,117
Well, Pop...

383
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,355
It's time for me to go.

384
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:32,132
Well, I've been
saving something for you here.

385
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:37,938
This is the Bible
I gave to your dad

386
00:30:38,072 --> 00:30:40,107
when he left for the service.

387
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:43,977
Left you a little memento
in there.

388
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,192
"Peace forever and never forget
your way back home."

389
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:04,031
Memory is the bank into which
we make deposits in good times

390
00:31:04,164 --> 00:31:07,901
so that we can draw
from it in tough times.

391
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:11,372
She's never gonna
forgive me, Pop.

392
00:31:15,543 --> 00:31:17,812
I don't know
if I can forgive myself.

393
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:20,849
No bridge too far for the Lord.

394
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:23,450
Trust in Him. Pray.

395
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:26,086
Do the right thing.

396
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,222
It'll work out in the end.

397
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:48,075
May the Lord bless you
and keep you.

398
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:51,813
May His light shine upon you,

399
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,480
and be gracious to you.

400
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:58,352
May He lift His countenance up
and bring you peace.

401
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:01,656
The Lord God is a fortress
and a shield.

402
00:32:02,423 --> 00:32:05,492
And Lord,
today may You be Casey's.

403
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:09,129
- Amen.
- I love my people.

404
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:14,935
Please tell Maria
I love her, too.

405
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:45,132
Attention!

406
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:51,606
Private, what are you
wearing on your feet?

407
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:54,074
- Cowboy boots, sir.
- Do I look like a sir to you?

408
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,076
Do not address me as sir,
I work for a living.

409
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,690
You will address me
as drill sergeant.

410
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,146
Yes, drill sergeant.

411
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,024
What are you gonna do
with those roach killers?

412
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:02,382
Do you think you're Roy Rogers?

413
00:33:02,517 --> 00:33:04,051
- No, drill sergeant!
- Do you think

414
00:33:04,184 --> 00:33:06,220
you're actually gonna
ride a horse into combat?

415
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:08,121
I don't think so,
drill sergeant.

416
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:11,325
You don't think so?
You don't think so?

417
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,393
We have landed
a man on the moon.

418
00:33:13,528 --> 00:33:17,164
There hasn't been a cavalry
charge in over 100 years.

419
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:18,867
And if you ride a horse
into battle,

420
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:20,735
then I'm Peter Frikkin' Pan.

421
00:33:21,703 --> 00:33:24,338
We're gonna get you
some righteous boots, soldier.

422
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:27,575
'Cause those feet are gonna
carry you into battle.

423
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:29,777
- Do you understand this?
- Yes, drill sergeant!

424
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:32,614
Yeah, I know, but have you
seen or heard from her?

425
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:36,316
<i>We've not seen her
since she left last week.</i>

426
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:39,654
She came by the ranch and...

427
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:42,222
she didn't have much
to say, but...

428
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:44,893
<i>She cried like a baby
when she left.</i>

429
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,795
<i>Casey, you gotta trust
the Lord with these things.</i>

430
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:49,531
You got to focus.

431
00:33:49,664 --> 00:33:51,498
You're about to stand the wall.

432
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,735
Yes, sir.

433
00:33:53,868 --> 00:33:55,335
Okay.

434
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:57,572
All right.
We love you, son.

435
00:33:57,705 --> 00:33:59,039
Bye bye.

436
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:08,115
Good morning, gentlemen.

437
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,986
I'm Sergeant Major Spencer.

438
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:14,956
Welcome you to the fifth
Special Forces Group.

439
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:16,323
Congratulations.

440
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:18,425
You completed
qualification training,

441
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,862
made it through our
training pipeline.

442
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:22,162
A lot of people try it.

443
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:23,616
A lot of people
don't pull it off.

444
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:25,232
So you got that one
under your belt.

445
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:27,334
But let me tell you this:

446
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:29,003
you trained to get here.

447
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:30,705
You're gonna train to stay here,

448
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:34,174
every hour, every day.

449
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:36,076
We are training
and we are learning,

450
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:37,912
or we're not doing our jobs.

451
00:34:38,046 --> 00:34:40,113
- Roger?
- Roger.

452
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:43,585
Here at Second Battalion,
we're going to emphasize

453
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:47,154
foreign internal defense
and unconventional warfare.

454
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:51,059
We are gonna become
masters at infiltration,

455
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:52,426
link up operations

456
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,494
with guerillas and
guerrilla chiefs,

457
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:57,164
learning from them,
building rapport,

458
00:34:57,297 --> 00:34:59,634
using what we learn
to lead guerrilla forces

459
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:02,570
anywhere in our
area of operations.

460
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:03,704
That is the goal.

461
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:10,612
Roll him, roll him!

462
00:35:10,745 --> 00:35:13,447
- Roll him over!
- Roll him!

463
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:32,634
Look to your left
and your right.

464
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:36,336
That is our most
important asset,

465
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,372
is the Special Forces soldier.

466
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:39,907
The man next to you.

467
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:43,645
You will be each
other's savior...

468
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,180
and ally at all times.

469
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,585
So, Staff Sergeant
Casey Shane...

470
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:53,588
meet your new guys.

471
00:35:55,188 --> 00:35:56,557
Take care, gentlemen.

472
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:01,129
So, you mean to tell me
you're a cowboy?

473
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:03,631
- Like, a real cowboy?
- Yes, sir.

474
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:06,199
Boots, hat, horses...
That type of cowboy?

475
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:09,202
Or you playing football
in Dallas?

476
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,639
- No, I rode bulls.
- Okay.

477
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:16,144
Ohh.
How big is your ranch?

478
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:18,713
Uh, 50,000 acres.

479
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:20,882
50,000 acres?

480
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:22,449
Exactly how big is that?

481
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:25,887
It's twenty miles long,
four miles wide.

482
00:36:26,888 --> 00:36:29,023
Wow. Okay.

483
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,826
How many people
live on your ranch?

484
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:32,959
We got seven.

485
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:35,663
Seven?
Seven people?

486
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:39,266
Dude, that's almost like
the size of Detroit,

487
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,334
and we got 700,000 people there.

488
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:43,370
Y'all got seven
people on the ranch?

489
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,272
Dude, I know you get lonely.

490
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:47,909
No, man, it's...

491
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:50,578
it's paradise.

492
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:52,032
Just come out
and see it some time

493
00:36:52,113 --> 00:36:53,781
and you'll know
what I'm talking about.

494
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:55,893
I just might have to take you
up on that offer, man.

495
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,285
But first, is there
any Black people out there?

496
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:00,588
- We ain't got no Black people.
- What?

497
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,934
Man, you're telling me
you want me to come

498
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:07,427
to a place where
there's no Black folk,

499
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:11,364
a few white folk and a whole
lot of empty space?

500
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,300
Yeah, a'ight.

501
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:16,470
Why are there no Black people
out there, man?

502
00:37:16,604 --> 00:37:18,206
You know, honestly,
I have no idea.

503
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:20,942
It's kind of funny
'cause Black cowboys

504
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,711
were some of the first people
to settle the West.

505
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:28,783
Well, look, man,
I'm definitely interested.

506
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,886
And I just may have to
take you up on that offer.

507
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,253
Maybe.

508
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:34,822
Gonna have to count us in.

509
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:37,558
What, they let the riffraff
in here this morning?

510
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:40,293
In? You guys are supposed
to be in 20 minutes ago, man.

511
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,295
Hey, government time.
Government time.

512
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:44,397
Tu, what you say, next game?

513
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:46,433
So, since we're all here,

514
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,603
what made you join
the military, Casey?

515
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:50,403
Oh, uh...

516
00:37:51,606 --> 00:37:53,841
I don't know.
Family tradition, I guess.

517
00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:56,944
Four generations have served.

518
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,413
My dad died
in the Beirut bombings.

519
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:03,918
Felt like something
I needed to do.

520
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:05,485
What about you?

521
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:08,623
Mine is, um, it's pretty simple.

522
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:10,191
Actually, very simple.

523
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:12,292
But to make a
long story short...

524
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:17,231
my daddy left my mom,
me and my little brother

525
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:18,766
like 12 years ago.

526
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,569
And my mom, she was working
two jobs back then.

527
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:23,947
And it was horrible
to see my mom, you know,

528
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,874
hustling like that,
trying to make ends meet.

529
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:30,678
My little brother was doing
horrible in school.

530
00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:32,713
It was just all around bad, bro.

531
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:34,649
But thank God for the military.

532
00:38:35,683 --> 00:38:37,350
You know, it really
changed our lives.

533
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:39,954
Now, my mom, she only works
40 hours a week.

534
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:42,223
You know, they don't
hear gunshots anymore.

535
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:43,691
Unfortunately, I do.

536
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:45,669
But, you know, it's a blessing
to have my family

537
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:47,228
out of that situation.

538
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,730
My little brother's following
right behind my footsteps.

539
00:38:49,864 --> 00:38:51,364
And I just got married, guys.

540
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:54,401
So, my life is good.
I'm blessed.

541
00:38:55,236 --> 00:38:56,904
Tu, what about you?

542
00:38:57,038 --> 00:38:58,973
Well, um...

543
00:38:59,774 --> 00:39:02,610
My parents made it
out of Vietnam on a boat

544
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:04,812
and they were out
on the South China Sea

545
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:06,948
when they were rescued
by the US Navy.

546
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:09,584
They became
commercial fishermen.

547
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:12,019
And they're the hardest
working people I know.

548
00:39:12,153 --> 00:39:15,388
Luckily, I had the good
fortune of going to Harvard.

549
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:16,757
Some folks might say

550
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:18,926
you're wasting a high
powered education.

551
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,063
Yeah. But the military is
part of my master plan.

552
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,632
- Master plan, huh?
- Now, listen,

553
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:26,934
seven out of 43 presidents
have Harvard degrees.

554
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:30,171
31 out of 43
served in the military.

555
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,906
There's a method to my madness.

556
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,174
Okay.

557
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:35,676
My money's on the fisherman
from the bayou.

558
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,879
Well, John, how about you?

559
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:39,947
I'm from Highland Park, Texas.

560
00:39:40,081 --> 00:39:42,149
My dad's in the oil business
up there.

561
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:44,384
You know, to tell you the truth,

562
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:46,954
he really wasn't excited
about me signing up.

563
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:49,657
But my grandfather
was a World War II hero,

564
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,159
and I admired him my whole life.

565
00:39:52,293 --> 00:39:54,929
You can call it whatever
you want... rich white guilt.

566
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:57,331
But I just wasn't gonna sit
in the lap of luxury

567
00:39:57,464 --> 00:39:58,900
- my whole life.
- What?

568
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:01,702
That sounds like
a comfortable lap to sit in.

569
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,106
So, Joe.
What's your story, bro?

570
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:07,675
I'm Lakota Sioux.

571
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:10,778
Lakotas were great warriors
for generations.

572
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:12,489
And at one time we were
one of the greatest

573
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:14,148
light cavalry in the world.

574
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:17,785
Native Americans have
the highest per cap it a

575
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:21,589
military service of any
ethnic group in America.

576
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:25,059
There have been
29 Medal of Honor recipients

577
00:40:25,192 --> 00:40:26,459
from the Native Americans.

578
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:31,766
These warrior ways,
they run deep and die hard.

579
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:34,467
My man...

580
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:38,205
that's like you're working
for the same institution...

581
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,841
that oppressed your people.

582
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:43,878
Yeah, some would say
the same institution

583
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:45,980
that tried to enforce slavery.

584
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:49,050
But history is a river, guys.

585
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:52,720
You can't dam it up.
You can't back it up.

586
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:55,957
We can't change the past.

587
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,227
You can only alter its
downstream course, the future.

588
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:02,964
Because an eye for an eye

589
00:41:03,097 --> 00:41:05,166
would leave this
whole world blind.

590
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,603
No cross, no crown.

591
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:13,741
No pains, no gains.

592
00:41:16,444 --> 00:41:17,945
You know, Joe...

593
00:41:19,714 --> 00:41:20,948
Always wanted a brother.

594
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:24,752
Now I got four
from all walks of life.

595
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:27,655
Leave it to
the US military, huh?

596
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:30,658
<i>De oppresso liber.</i>

597
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:32,093
To free the oppressed.

598
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,061
Whoa!

599
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:35,363
What's up, man?

600
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:37,164
How we doing?
Okay, boys.

601
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:38,332
We officially made it.

602
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:39,934
Graduation present.

603
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:41,712
We're going off to cowboy
paradise, but here's the deal.

604
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:43,170
I can only adopt one of y'all,

605
00:41:43,304 --> 00:41:45,384
so there might be a fight
to death to earn that spot.

606
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:46,707
My bets are on John.

607
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:49,977
So Casey,

608
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:53,147
you're telling me in the age
of the Internet,

609
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,182
fast cars and airplanes,

610
00:41:55,316 --> 00:41:57,785
you are still
talking about horses?

611
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:01,722
John, there's been five major
advances in man's ability

612
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:03,324
to transcend
space and time, okay,

613
00:42:03,457 --> 00:42:05,035
and that has been the
domestication of the horse,

614
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:06,659
the sailing vessel,
the steam locomotive,

615
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:08,095
the car and the airplane, okay?

616
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:10,007
They all have a romantic
culture surrounding them,

617
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:12,466
but only one has
a dynamic relationship.

618
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,768
Oh, man.

619
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,903
You know, relationships,
I don't know.

620
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:17,948
You're talking about
an ignorant beast of burden.

621
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:20,875
What exactly do you mean,
relationship?

622
00:42:21,842 --> 00:42:23,282
Okay, you can ask
millions of people,

623
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:24,912
millions of testimonies.

624
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:27,124
But there's a magical bond
between a man and his horse.

625
00:42:27,148 --> 00:42:28,382
Going to have to sell me, man.

626
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:30,084
It sounds a little crazy.

627
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:31,285
Hey, laugh all you want.

628
00:42:31,419 --> 00:42:32,987
Just telling you what it is.

629
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,690
White dude speak
with unified tongue.

630
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:39,226
Woo!

631
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:46,667
- Cowboy land, baby.
- Woohoo!

632
00:42:46,801 --> 00:42:48,903
Hey.
Oh, wow.

633
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:50,438
All right, guys.
This is mom.

634
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,573
This is grandma and grandpa.
These are the guys.

635
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:53,941
Nice to meet you.

636
00:42:54,075 --> 00:42:54,775
Oh, wow.

637
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:56,811
- Cowboy.
- Oh, wow.

638
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,122
Don't believe anything
she says, y'all.

639
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:09,990
Hey, boys. Jackpot.
Bull riding tomorrow.

640
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:12,069
You ain't gotta ride
unless you're feeling froggy.

641
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:14,929
But you're welcome to join.
Come watch, cool?

642
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:17,182
All right, turn in early.
You got a long day tomorrow.

643
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:27,241
Mr. Shane, this must be
Casey's dad.

644
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:31,011
Yep. That's him.

645
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:35,416
He was a... he was a great,
great man, served in Vietnam

646
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:39,687
and survived Vietnam
and died in an age of peace.

647
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,558
Beirut '83.
Casey told us about it.

648
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:44,825
Yeah.

649
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,460
Very sorry for your loss,
Mr. Shane.

650
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:48,629
Well, I appreciate that.

651
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,666
Pain fades,
but never goes away completely.

652
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:57,938
But Casey was a real blessing.
He was a clone of his dad.

653
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:00,074
Every time I look at him, I...

654
00:44:09,283 --> 00:44:11,118
thought I was looking
at his dad.

655
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:19,927
But... he gave me
a second shot at fatherhood,

656
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,297
and it's been a great ride.

657
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:29,670
This country
never ceases to amaze me.

658
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:32,006
Right.

659
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:34,643
Greatness emerges
from every corner.

660
00:44:34,775 --> 00:44:36,110
Amen.

661
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:45,386
Good Lord, what a surprise.

662
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,954
Look at you, man.

663
00:44:47,087 --> 00:44:48,698
- Still one piece, one piece.
- All grown up, man.

664
00:44:48,722 --> 00:44:50,391
- How's everything, man?
- Still alive.

665
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:51,868
- Still breathing, kicking.
- All right.

666
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:53,160
- Everything's good?
- Yeah.

667
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:55,396
All right, come on in, man.
Come on in.

668
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,166
Hey, Carla, you ain't gonna
believe who's here.

669
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,367
Carla.

670
00:45:02,136 --> 00:45:04,171
- Thank you.
- Thanks, hon.

671
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:07,241
Sure is good to see you guys.
Yeah.

672
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:10,444
How's everybody doing?
Family, parents?

673
00:45:11,513 --> 00:45:13,881
I heard Maria is still
riding in school?

674
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:20,221
How is she?

675
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,293
Fair.

676
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:32,733
Casey, whatever happened...

677
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:35,436
you broke her heart.

678
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:39,940
I messed up.

679
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,277
And I know that.

680
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,981
I'd do anything
to take it back, but I can't.

681
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:52,920
I just hope that you two
are able to forgive me someday.

682
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:56,991
Please, I just need
to talk to her.

683
00:45:59,994 --> 00:46:01,228
Well, Casey...

684
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:05,899
she made me swear
I would not do that.

685
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:13,073
Please, Juan.

686
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:22,816
Sorry. We can't.

687
00:46:27,522 --> 00:46:28,856
Yes, sir.

688
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:35,929
Well, I got our guests waiting.

689
00:46:37,097 --> 00:46:39,099
It's been a long day,
I should probably head off.

690
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:41,035
Just wanted to stop by,
say hello,

691
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:43,170
see how everyone's doing.

692
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,273
Yeah.

693
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:49,376
Thinking about you over there.

694
00:46:50,545 --> 00:46:51,879
Praying for you.

695
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:57,117
Come by again to have
some of those tortillas.

696
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,353
Yeah.

697
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:16,270
Could you give her this for me?

698
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:19,273
Just tell her I love her,
please.

699
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:22,677
I will.

700
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:27,314
But I think she's ready
to move on without you, Casey.

701
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:31,385
She sent all your letters
back to me unread.

702
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:36,558
Casey...

703
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:39,661
Take care of yourself.

704
00:47:39,794 --> 00:47:41,529
I will. Promise.

705
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:02,650
Oh-ho-ho.

706
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,697
All right, let's go, boys, come
on, wake up, wake up, wake up!

707
00:48:06,721 --> 00:48:08,922
Everybody, let's go, let's go,
come on, come on.

708
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:10,424
Burning daylight, here we go.

709
00:48:10,558 --> 00:48:12,278
Yeah, let's go.
Good morning, how you doing?

710
00:48:12,326 --> 00:48:13,494
Man, I'm from the hood,

711
00:48:13,628 --> 00:48:14,948
you can't be barging in
like that.

712
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:16,172
Five minutes, Tu,
if you don't get

713
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:17,832
that scrawny butt
of yours up, boy.

714
00:48:17,965 --> 00:48:18,966
Let's go.

715
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:20,635
I'll meet y'all out there.

716
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:27,609
Hustle up, boys.

717
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,077
Ready, boys?

718
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,514
All right, Poppy is gonna
show you how it's done.

719
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:34,257
You might want to listen up,
'cause I've seen you all

720
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:36,216
try and aim
a rifle before, so...

721
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,853
Good morning.

722
00:48:38,986 --> 00:48:40,855
Welcome to New Mexico.

723
00:48:41,656 --> 00:48:44,526
Hold your hands up.
How many fingers you got?

724
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:46,360
- Ten.
- Ten?

725
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:48,162
The objective is
to come away with ten

726
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:50,063
after you finish roping.

727
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:53,267
Roll that wrist.

728
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:58,939
All right, nothing to it.

729
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:00,216
All you gotta do
is think it there.

730
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,011
So, who wants to try it first?

731
00:49:17,491 --> 00:49:18,726
All right.

732
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:21,529
All right.

733
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:23,531
Oh!

734
00:49:24,532 --> 00:49:26,133
Hey!

735
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:28,235
Woo-hoo-hoo.

736
00:49:40,047 --> 00:49:42,584
I just wanna shortstop
any cowboy and Indian jokes

737
00:49:42,717 --> 00:49:43,751
from you chumps.

738
00:49:57,498 --> 00:50:00,535
Maria.
We got to have a girl talk.

739
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:06,173
That sounds kind of serious.

740
00:50:08,108 --> 00:50:09,878
Maria, I've bit my tongue
for months now,

741
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,212
and that's not fair
or right to you.

742
00:50:13,447 --> 00:50:16,216
I'm going to read
the tea leaves for you.

743
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:21,990
Okay.
4.0 GPA, pre-vet, check.

744
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:25,425
Co-captain of the rodeo team.
Check.

745
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,729
Unofficial New Mexico State
record holder

746
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:30,698
for being asked out
by good-looking guys,

747
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:34,736
but never having more than
two dates with the same guy.

748
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:35,904
Now...

749
00:50:36,738 --> 00:50:41,341
either Maria is highly
motivated and ambitious...

750
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:46,881
and has super high
standards or...

751
00:50:47,649 --> 00:50:49,483
Maria is running from something.

752
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:54,087
Maria...

753
00:50:54,756 --> 00:50:56,558
You might as well
be wearing a shirt

754
00:50:56,691 --> 00:51:00,929
that says
"Trust issues. Beware."

755
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:02,697
Don't waste your time.

756
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:05,365
That obvious, huh?

757
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:07,769
Yes.

758
00:51:09,971 --> 00:51:11,204
Yes.

759
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,043
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

760
00:51:15,175 --> 00:51:17,879
I feel like I can't move forward

761
00:51:18,012 --> 00:51:21,749
and... I can't go back.

762
00:51:23,216 --> 00:51:24,552
Back to what?

763
00:51:28,656 --> 00:51:30,858
You're still in love
with Casey, aren't you?

764
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:34,328
Maybe.

765
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:39,634
Yeah, like maybe the sun
will rise tomorrow.

766
00:51:41,803 --> 00:51:44,839
Did he ever reach out
to you after the breakup?

767
00:51:46,975 --> 00:51:50,243
Yeah, he sent
several letters to my parents.

768
00:51:50,377 --> 00:51:51,846
Did you respond?

769
00:51:54,048 --> 00:51:55,282
No.

770
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:01,656
Well, that's a creative way
to catch a guy.

771
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,192
That's playing
hard to get on steroids.

772
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:08,796
Well, I...

773
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,733
I didn't think I could ever
get over the betrayal.

774
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:17,572
And then I got to the point
where I thought

775
00:52:17,705 --> 00:52:21,208
I'd take him back
if he crawled on broken glass.

776
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:25,513
And then I got to
the point where I'd...

777
00:52:26,346 --> 00:52:28,382
take him back
if he just walked in.

778
00:52:29,282 --> 00:52:33,755
But... by then he was over
2,000 miles away.

779
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:48,936
You got to send him
a smoke signal, girl.

780
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:53,775
- Like, how?
- Like...

781
00:52:53,908 --> 00:52:56,309
Like, how about
the old-fashioned way?

782
00:52:57,578 --> 00:53:01,015
Write him a letter.
Express your true feelings.

783
00:53:01,149 --> 00:53:02,817
Send it snail mail.

784
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,451
Spill some perfume on it.

785
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:08,122
I don't know if I could do that.

786
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:10,958
I haven't talked
to him in two years.

787
00:53:12,225 --> 00:53:13,460
Hmm.

788
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:20,968
Well, you better
figure it out, and fairly soon.

789
00:53:23,403 --> 00:53:24,603
Or you're gonna end up married

790
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:26,641
to that barrel horse of yours.

791
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:29,844
Well, at least we know

792
00:53:29,977 --> 00:53:32,279
we wouldn't have
any trust issues there.

793
00:53:36,918 --> 00:53:38,285
Hey, you all right, Pop?

794
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:40,555
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

795
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:43,691
You know, I think Doc
may have picked up a rock.

796
00:53:43,825 --> 00:53:45,760
Come on.
I'll check him.

797
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:48,328
You take him on down
to the spring and loop back.

798
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:50,031
Pick me up on the way back.

799
00:53:50,164 --> 00:53:51,733
- You sure?
- Yeah.

800
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:52,900
I'll be all right.

801
00:54:39,013 --> 00:54:43,050
Oh, boy, lookie here.
Lookie here.

802
00:54:44,886 --> 00:54:48,455
That's a "Bonanza" shot
if ever there was one.

803
00:54:57,364 --> 00:54:59,667
Warrior spirit still lives.

804
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:17,723
All right, so tell me what
you guys think?

805
00:55:17,785 --> 00:55:20,288
- Beautiful.
- Unbelievable.

806
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,956
Man, it's amazing.

807
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:25,893
Tell you what,
you come out here...

808
00:55:27,261 --> 00:55:28,863
imagination runs wild.

809
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:31,331
Dreams come true.

810
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,101
Worries don't even exist.

811
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:39,607
I'll tell you what,
I'm a believer.

812
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:43,277
I'm definitely a believer.

813
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,412
I wouldn't have
never dreamed it.

814
00:55:45,546 --> 00:55:47,849
But I'm here and I can see it.

815
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,718
When I get out of the Army, bro,

816
00:55:50,852 --> 00:55:52,920
I'm gonna come kick it
with you, for sure.

817
00:55:53,054 --> 00:55:54,565
And you know I'm gonna take you
up on that, right,

818
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:56,090
put you to work?

819
00:55:56,224 --> 00:55:58,693
Hey, man, just keep me out
of that truck, and we good.

820
00:55:58,826 --> 00:56:00,595
Hey, you come back any time.

821
00:56:01,494 --> 00:56:03,496
Reclaim the ancestor's
legacy, huh?

822
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:04,932
Thank you.

823
00:56:26,854 --> 00:56:28,789
We saw Casey last week.

824
00:56:30,157 --> 00:56:34,028
He came to the ranch with
some of his soldier fellows.

825
00:56:38,032 --> 00:56:39,133
How was he?

826
00:56:39,901 --> 00:56:43,371
I'd say he was good
and that he looked great.

827
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:46,207
He must have gained
ten or 15 pounds,

828
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,642
- and all muscle.
- Muscle.

829
00:56:47,775 --> 00:56:49,510
I'd hate to tangle with the guy.

830
00:56:49,644 --> 00:56:54,081
And he's got some great men
in his special operations unit.

831
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:55,816
- Mm-hmm.
- And I tell you,

832
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:59,186
those guys make me feel good
about America.

833
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:02,056
What was the bad?

834
00:57:02,924 --> 00:57:07,094
Well, Casey came to see
your mother and me in private.

835
00:57:07,862 --> 00:57:09,764
Never seen lover's remorse
like that.

836
00:57:09,897 --> 00:57:12,499
- Mm.
- And I got to tell you, Maria,

837
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:14,335
I think this guy Casey

838
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:16,436
loves you more than he ever has.

839
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:21,742
He fessed up

840
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:24,545
that the breakup
was all his fault.

841
00:57:25,746 --> 00:57:28,382
He expressed
his undying love for you.

842
00:57:29,283 --> 00:57:31,919
And he said he was gonna
come back for you.

843
00:57:33,387 --> 00:57:34,667
So, you better be thinking about

844
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:36,724
what you're going to say
when he shows up.

845
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:39,794
I don't know
if I can go back there.

846
00:57:42,096 --> 00:57:43,130
Maria...

847
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:47,668
most young men
have to Fool's Hills

848
00:57:47,802 --> 00:57:49,904
once or twice
before they grow up.

849
00:57:50,905 --> 00:57:55,009
And the Lord knows I was
captain of the Fool's Brigade.

850
00:57:59,347 --> 00:58:01,015
If there's no forgiveness...

851
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:04,852
there wouldn't be many men
standing in the end.

852
00:58:08,422 --> 00:58:09,890
Mama, what did you think?

853
00:58:11,258 --> 00:58:13,661
I saw a heartbroken man

854
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:16,097
deeply in love
with our daughter.

855
00:58:20,668 --> 00:58:22,336
Would you trust him?

856
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,138
With my life.

857
00:58:26,674 --> 00:58:28,275
So, what are you thinking?

858
00:58:29,777 --> 00:58:31,812
Daddy, don't push me.

859
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:35,249
The heart has reasons
the mind knows nothing of.

860
00:58:36,751 --> 00:58:38,219
- Fair enough.
- Mm-hmm.

861
00:58:39,286 --> 00:58:40,521
Fair enough.

862
00:58:44,058 --> 00:58:46,560
He asked me to give you this.

863
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:55,469
Dear Maria,

864
00:58:55,603 --> 00:58:58,472
shame and grief have haunted
me since my stupidity,

865
00:58:58,606 --> 00:59:02,209
arrogance and sin caused
the chasm in our relationship.

866
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:05,312
I think about you
a hundred times a day.

867
00:59:06,247 --> 00:59:08,349
I would understand
if you choose to move on.

868
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,570
But if there's
a glimmer of chance

869
00:59:10,651 --> 00:59:12,420
to put us back together again,

870
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:15,423
I believe I can persuade you
that I'm a changed man.

871
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:18,527
I love you
as much as I ever have.

872
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:20,394
I hope to hear from you.

873
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:22,696
Love forever, Casey.

874
00:59:41,182 --> 00:59:43,918
Dear Casey,
thank you for your kind note.

875
00:59:44,051 --> 00:59:46,654
I am not sure whether
the pieces of our mutual life

876
00:59:46,787 --> 00:59:47,988
can be put back together,

877
00:59:48,122 --> 00:59:50,024
but I am willing to get together

878
00:59:50,157 --> 00:59:51,826
to see where the trail may lead.

879
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:53,761
I look forward to
hearing from you soon.

880
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:55,596
Love, Maria.

881
01:00:44,011 --> 01:00:45,455
<i>These are live pictures</i>

882
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:47,181
<i>for you right now,
a tragic accident</i>

883
01:00:47,314 --> 01:00:49,150
<i>apparently has just happened
in New York City.</i>

884
01:00:49,283 --> 01:00:53,754
<i>A plane has crashed right
into the World Trade Center.</i>

885
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:55,288
<i>You can see the smoke
and the flames</i>

886
01:00:55,356 --> 01:00:57,158
<i>coming out of the
shattered windows.</i>

887
01:00:59,561 --> 01:01:00,961
Woo!

888
01:01:08,302 --> 01:01:10,137
<i>Appeared to bank sharply,</i>

889
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:15,376
<i>and smash directly,
perhaps purposefully into...</i>

890
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,278
<i>- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, God.</i>

891
01:01:17,411 --> 01:01:18,445
<i>There's another one.</i>

892
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,048
<i>Oh, my goodness,
there's another one.</i>

893
01:01:21,182 --> 01:01:23,059
<i>This seems to be on purpose.</i>

894
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,694
<i>Oh, my goodness, now you...</i>

895
01:01:24,718 --> 01:01:27,087
<i>- Is that a plane?
- Now it's obvious, I think.</i>

896
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:29,223
Do you know where Casey is?

897
01:01:30,758 --> 01:01:32,293
No.

898
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:34,386
<i>I think we have a terror attack.</i>

899
01:01:34,995 --> 01:01:39,767
<i>Obviously a suicide
terrorist attack</i>

900
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,536
<i>on the World Trade Center.</i>

901
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,837
<i>What we have been fearing...</i>

902
01:01:44,738 --> 01:01:46,373
<i>What we have been fearing</i>

903
01:01:46,508 --> 01:01:50,444
<i>for the longest time here
apparently has come to pass.</i>

904
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:52,346
<i>A disastrous terrorist...</i>

905
01:01:52,479 --> 01:01:56,317
Let's strap it on, boys.
We're going to war.

906
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:07,962
It's Casey.

907
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:19,840
Yeah, we're the first ones
going in.

908
01:02:19,974 --> 01:02:21,976
We ship out in 48 hours.

909
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:23,911
Where are you going?

910
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:25,513
I don't know.

911
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:27,147
<i>How long will you be gone?</i>

912
01:02:29,016 --> 01:02:30,384
Can't say.

913
01:02:30,518 --> 01:02:32,953
Well, Casey, I wish to God
I could go in your place

914
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,656
or at least go with you.

915
01:02:35,523 --> 01:02:38,292
There's nobody I would trust
more in defending my family

916
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:40,027
and my country than you.

917
01:02:42,963 --> 01:02:46,333
Know that we... love you,

918
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:50,838
and hold you in our hearts
and pray for you every day.

919
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,907
<i>We love you more than
you can know.</i>

920
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:56,277
Forever and always.

921
01:02:59,947 --> 01:03:02,850
I love...
I love my people, and...

922
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:06,453
I'll communicate as I'm able to.

923
01:03:08,822 --> 01:03:10,324
Bye, Pop.

924
01:03:48,095 --> 01:03:49,597
Got two minutes.

925
01:04:20,894 --> 01:04:23,097
Contact alive, 50 meters.

926
01:04:32,005 --> 01:04:33,474
Got a red chem light.

927
01:04:34,975 --> 01:04:36,243
It's our guy, Case.

928
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,345
Ruck up.

929
01:04:43,718 --> 01:04:45,152
All right, let's do this.

930
01:04:54,395 --> 01:04:55,129
Hello.

931
01:04:55,262 --> 01:04:56,997
Staff Sergeant Casey Shane.

932
01:05:00,702 --> 01:05:02,035
All right, let's move.

933
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:47,114
This is General Daood.

934
01:05:49,851 --> 01:05:51,084
Please.

935
01:05:52,986 --> 01:05:54,556
Joe, Tu, take watch out front.

936
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:15,877
We are very grateful
you are here.

937
01:06:16,678 --> 01:06:19,914
More Americans come
when the towers fall.

938
01:06:20,047 --> 01:06:22,316
We prevail, we're very thankful.

939
01:06:29,757 --> 01:06:32,292
The Taliban have ruined
our country.

940
01:06:32,426 --> 01:06:34,995
Our men are very valiant.

941
01:06:35,128 --> 01:06:36,898
We will fight the ground.

942
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,999
We need your air support.

943
01:06:41,936 --> 01:06:43,705
Do your men ride horses?

944
01:06:48,943 --> 01:06:50,410
All experts, sir.

945
01:07:21,141 --> 01:07:22,610
Cars cannot climb mountains.

946
01:07:22,744 --> 01:07:27,047
Elevation.
It is key in my country,

947
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:30,785
mobility for battle
effectiveness.

948
01:07:38,258 --> 01:07:40,060
Huddle up on me.

949
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:53,073
Our Father, who art in heaven,

950
01:07:53,206 --> 01:07:54,509
hallowed by thy name.

951
01:07:54,642 --> 01:07:57,011
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

952
01:07:57,144 --> 01:07:59,313
on Earth as it is in heaven.

953
01:07:59,446 --> 01:08:01,481
Give us this day our daily bread

954
01:08:01,616 --> 01:08:03,718
and forgive us our trespasses,

955
01:08:03,851 --> 01:08:06,554
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

956
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:09,891
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

957
01:08:10,024 --> 01:08:11,626
Blessed be the Lord.

958
01:08:11,759 --> 01:08:15,897
My God, my rock, who prepareth
my hands for war,

959
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:17,599
and my fingers for battle.

960
01:08:18,398 --> 01:08:20,434
Lord have mercy on every soul...

961
01:08:21,903 --> 01:08:23,403
we're about to send to you.

962
01:08:59,073 --> 01:09:01,018
Hey, they look like they're
about to make a cavalry charge.

963
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:02,185
They say anything about that?

964
01:09:02,209 --> 01:09:03,745
Negative.
Not that I heard.

965
01:09:03,878 --> 01:09:05,412
Mm-mm.

966
01:09:05,546 --> 01:09:08,549
21st century cavalry charge,
Bo ain't gonna believe this.

967
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:13,453
Hey, I ain't missing
this, fellas.

968
01:09:14,354 --> 01:09:15,757
You're not going without me.

969
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:17,233
Well, come on, brother.
What do you say, Chief?

970
01:09:17,257 --> 01:09:19,459
Time to go kinetic.

971
01:09:19,594 --> 01:09:21,863
Hey, guys, me and Tu
will stay behind,

972
01:09:21,996 --> 01:09:23,397
calling in our CAS.

973
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:24,932
We'll rendezvous from here

974
01:09:25,066 --> 01:09:26,299
straight down the wadi.

975
01:09:26,433 --> 01:09:28,603
Nobody goes through the pass.
Nobody.

976
01:09:30,538 --> 01:09:34,174
Guys, drop everything
but your arms and ammo.

977
01:09:41,149 --> 01:09:43,450
- Let's do this.
- Hoi!

978
01:10:06,339 --> 01:10:07,575
Ah!

979
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,999
Many Muslims say...

980
01:10:34,635 --> 01:10:37,004
Americans are infidels.

981
01:10:37,872 --> 01:10:42,342
It is strange you and I
be fighting together.

982
01:10:42,476 --> 01:10:45,747
Different countries.
Different religions.

983
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:51,953
Many will cut my head
if they could.

984
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:59,660
But... I fight for my people.

985
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,863
Why you say you here?

986
01:11:03,865 --> 01:11:06,466
We're here to kill the people
who attacked our country.

987
01:11:08,102 --> 01:11:10,538
But we're also here
to help you and your people...

988
01:11:11,338 --> 01:11:12,807
experience liberty.

989
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:15,676
Because that's a basic
human right.

990
01:11:17,845 --> 01:11:21,348
See, God represents freedom,
and without freedom,

991
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:22,984
you can't have love.

992
01:11:24,952 --> 01:11:31,058
So, although you and me
practice a different religion,

993
01:11:31,192 --> 01:11:32,432
we're willing to risk our lives

994
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:33,699
to make sure it stays that way.

995
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:43,738
My country has been called
the Graveyard of Empires.

996
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:47,675
Alexander the Great
has been broken here.

997
01:11:48,776 --> 01:11:51,612
The British, broken here.

998
01:11:52,747 --> 01:11:53,781
Russians.

999
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,652
I pray to Allah...

1000
01:12:00,387 --> 01:12:02,757
that you not broken here.

1001
01:12:04,357 --> 01:12:05,827
I pray so, too.

1002
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:08,729
We don't break.

1003
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:13,734
We hear tales of cowboys
in America.

1004
01:12:14,602 --> 01:12:17,038
I saw John Wayne movie once.

1005
01:12:17,972 --> 01:12:20,608
You Americans don't disappoint.

1006
01:12:20,741 --> 01:12:24,045
I am proud to fight with you.

1007
01:12:28,348 --> 01:12:29,851
Sleep well, my friend.

1008
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:51,632
Hey, I need you 203
over here in this corner.

1009
01:13:51,766 --> 01:13:53,267
You, cover one to three o-clock.

1010
01:13:53,401 --> 01:13:54,535
Take a knee, take a knee.

1011
01:13:54,669 --> 01:13:55,869
How's he doing?
How's he doing?

1012
01:13:57,905 --> 01:13:59,874
Okay, good work.
I need another rifle up front.

1013
01:14:00,007 --> 01:14:01,441
I need another rifle up front.

1014
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:02,777
All right, all right.

1015
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:06,013
Hey. Griffin 99,
this is Sabre two zero.

1016
01:14:06,147 --> 01:14:07,715
In contact, 50 hostiles.

1017
01:14:07,848 --> 01:14:12,687
We are taking small arms fire
and heavy RPG.

1018
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,064
I need immediate air support
and medevac, over.

1019
01:14:14,088 --> 01:14:15,856
I got two wounded, one critical.

1020
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:18,092
<i>Viper 61.10 minutes
out...</i>

1021
01:14:27,601 --> 01:14:29,103
Griffin 99, Sabre two-zero.

1022
01:14:29,236 --> 01:14:32,907
<i>Echo, tango, whiskey,
zulu 379248.</i>

1023
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,876
I need immediate air support
north of my position. Over.

1024
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:40,014
<i>Viper 61, tally target...</i>

1025
01:14:40,581 --> 01:14:41,749
Hang in there.

1026
01:14:41,882 --> 01:14:42,993
All right, boys,
all right, boys, hey,

1027
01:14:43,017 --> 01:14:44,552
air support is 10 mikes out.

1028
01:14:44,685 --> 01:14:46,296
Our boy's 10 mikes out,
we gotta hold it, right?

1029
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,855
Hold it down.

1030
01:14:53,394 --> 01:14:55,096
Put me in the fight!

1031
01:14:55,229 --> 01:14:56,931
All right,
how are we doing, guys?

1032
01:14:57,064 --> 01:14:59,633
Heads in the fight.
Heads in the fight.

1033
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:05,773
Viper 61, roger that.

1034
01:15:05,906 --> 01:15:08,309
We are the only structure
in this grid square.

1035
01:15:08,442 --> 01:15:11,645
I need 100 meters on
every corner. Expedite.

1036
01:15:13,681 --> 01:15:16,517
<i>That's too tight...</i>

1037
01:15:16,784 --> 01:15:19,387
Viper 61, I need 100 meters.
Danger close.

1038
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,189
I repeat again, 100 meters.

1039
01:15:25,326 --> 01:15:26,861
Anybody see that girl?

1040
01:15:28,863 --> 01:15:30,731
Put me in the fight.

1041
01:15:41,909 --> 01:15:44,545
- I need cover.
- What?

1042
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:47,681
No, what are you doing?

1043
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:53,087
No!

1044
01:15:55,256 --> 01:15:56,624
Come on!

1045
01:16:40,935 --> 01:16:45,673
Lord, watch over our boys.

1046
01:16:46,407 --> 01:16:48,876
Casey, Quan,

1047
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:53,948
Joe, Tu, John.

1048
01:16:55,116 --> 01:17:00,187
As a mighty man of old,
I pray, Lord,

1049
01:17:00,321 --> 01:17:02,923
that You'd protect them,
You'd watch over them,

1050
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,793
and that You bring them home.

1051
01:17:07,328 --> 01:17:11,832
In Jesus' name, amen.

1052
01:17:18,139 --> 01:17:19,306
<i>Engage.</i>

1053
01:17:42,531 --> 01:17:45,032
<i>CAP one, Angel one, wheels up.</i>

1054
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:48,369
<i>Twenty mikes out, standby,
CAS evac...</i>

1055
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:51,805
<i>We got five KIA, one crippled.</i>

1056
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:53,941
<i>O positive, pushing blood now.</i>

1057
01:17:54,808 --> 01:17:58,812
<i>CAP one, angel one,
casualty in cardiac arrest.</i>

1058
01:17:58,946 --> 01:18:01,215
<i>Popping de-fib and CPR now.</i>

1059
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:17,198
Hello, Sergeant Shane,

1060
01:18:17,331 --> 01:18:20,267
I'm Major Rogers,
and this is Captain Jones.

1061
01:18:22,336 --> 01:18:24,438
We're so glad
you're gonna be okay.

1062
01:18:26,407 --> 01:18:29,143
I will be doing the post-op
on this mission.

1063
01:18:30,778 --> 01:18:32,379
How are my guys?

1064
01:18:34,281 --> 01:18:36,317
Casey, we regret to inform you

1065
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:39,386
that all of your men
have been killed.

1066
01:18:43,357 --> 01:18:48,262
The QRF team found
a detonated suicide vest

1067
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:49,664
in the house.

1068
01:18:49,797 --> 01:18:55,035
Little girl must have been
wired with a suicide vest.

1069
01:18:55,169 --> 01:18:57,639
I killed my...
I killed them.

1070
01:18:58,673 --> 01:19:01,041
No, Casey, you tried
to save a little girl

1071
01:19:01,175 --> 01:19:03,811
in an awful firefight.

1072
01:19:03,944 --> 01:19:05,212
I killed them.

1073
01:19:05,346 --> 01:19:08,282
Casey, you did not
kill those men.

1074
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:11,252
You acted with great bravery
and compassion.

1075
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,825
But it looks like everything
will heal up

1076
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:21,362
except for your leg.

1077
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:24,431
Casey, you need
to get some rest.

1078
01:19:24,566 --> 01:19:27,535
Push number two on that
telephone if you need me,

1079
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:30,404
and I'll be checking up
on you periodically.

1080
01:19:37,512 --> 01:19:41,448
Major, that soldier's world
has just imploded.

1081
01:19:42,316 --> 01:19:45,553
I want a suicide watch placed
on Sergeant Shane immediately.

1082
01:20:08,976 --> 01:20:11,045
There's something
not right with that boy.

1083
01:20:12,379 --> 01:20:15,349
He hasn't left this ranch
in six weeks.

1084
01:20:20,555 --> 01:20:21,756
None of us have had

1085
01:20:21,889 --> 01:20:24,191
a significant
conversation with him.

1086
01:20:27,261 --> 01:20:29,163
He's isolated himself.

1087
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:34,101
I smell liquor on him.

1088
01:20:38,773 --> 01:20:42,409
Only good thing
is he started riding again.

1089
01:21:20,715 --> 01:21:22,149
Case.

1090
01:21:22,282 --> 01:21:24,686
Johnny called and said
he and some of the buds

1091
01:21:24,819 --> 01:21:27,789
were getting together for a
game of cards in town tonight.

1092
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:31,225
They'd sure like you
to join them.

1093
01:21:32,459 --> 01:21:35,162
Nah, I got some reading
to do tonight.

1094
01:21:37,766 --> 01:21:41,235
They really want you to come.
I think it'd be good for you.

1095
01:21:43,937 --> 01:21:45,205
Think about it.

1096
01:21:48,843 --> 01:21:50,110
Okay.

1097
01:22:38,893 --> 01:22:41,495
Hey, toots.
Jager bomb.

1098
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,367
You just back
from the Middle East?

1099
01:22:50,471 --> 01:22:52,306
Good to see you, Casey.

1100
01:22:56,778 --> 01:22:58,178
How you guys been?

1101
01:22:58,312 --> 01:22:59,480
- Good.
- Yeah?

1102
01:22:59,614 --> 01:23:01,181
- Explain to me.
- Quench your thirst.

1103
01:23:01,315 --> 01:23:03,092
- Thank you, sir.
- You think those camel jockeys

1104
01:23:03,116 --> 01:23:05,452
give a rip about us
being over there?

1105
01:23:06,654 --> 01:23:09,056
Why would you join the military
and fight their war?

1106
01:23:14,361 --> 01:23:16,531
You know, it's been said
that patriotism...

1107
01:23:17,565 --> 01:23:20,568
is the last
refuge of scoundrels.

1108
01:23:25,907 --> 01:23:27,274
Whoever that chump was,

1109
01:23:27,407 --> 01:23:29,443
he'd have a different idea
if he knew my guys.

1110
01:23:30,344 --> 01:23:32,179
How much they pay you guys?

1111
01:23:33,515 --> 01:23:34,616
Enough.

1112
01:23:35,482 --> 01:23:36,882
Not to mention
Uncle Sam's gonna pay

1113
01:23:36,918 --> 01:23:39,453
for my college education
when I finish my tour.

1114
01:23:39,587 --> 01:23:44,692
Kind of makes you
a mercenary, doesn't it?

1115
01:23:45,527 --> 01:23:49,396
Look, buddy, you need
to watch your mouth.

1116
01:23:49,531 --> 01:23:51,431
Well, it does, doesn't it?

1117
01:23:51,566 --> 01:23:53,267
All right, ponytail,
that's enough.

1118
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:58,006
Just apologize to that soldier
and call it a day, huh?

1119
01:23:58,138 --> 01:23:59,741
Hey, this ain't your affair.

1120
01:23:59,874 --> 01:24:02,309
- Yeah, I got it covered.
- Yeah, stand down.

1121
01:24:03,377 --> 01:24:05,880
Actually, it is my affair,
'cause you see, this man,

1122
01:24:06,748 --> 01:24:08,188
yeah, he could definitely
handle you,

1123
01:24:08,248 --> 01:24:10,250
but then he'd get
court martialed.

1124
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:13,721
And I'd get kind of sad.
So, do the right thing.

1125
01:24:13,855 --> 01:24:16,791
Apologize.
Go home.

1126
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,260
What happens if I don't?

1127
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:25,876
Well, they're gonna have
to carry you out of here

1128
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:27,367
horizontal and feet first.

1129
01:24:53,962 --> 01:24:56,531
Case, what are you doing?

1130
01:24:57,799 --> 01:24:59,266
Have you lost your mind?

1131
01:25:00,535 --> 01:25:03,503
We've been friends for life.
Now I've got to take you in.

1132
01:25:05,006 --> 01:25:07,240
You're really
putting me in a bind here.

1133
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:09,409
D.A. may classify you
as a lethal weapon,

1134
01:25:09,544 --> 01:25:11,178
and call this armed assault.

1135
01:25:11,311 --> 01:25:13,213
And you act like
you don't even care.

1136
01:25:14,247 --> 01:25:15,984
Yeah, maybe I don't.

1137
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:17,384
Hmm.

1138
01:25:18,185 --> 01:25:19,587
All right, let's go.

1139
01:25:24,124 --> 01:25:25,560
Hey, Marshall.

1140
01:25:28,495 --> 01:25:30,130
It's good to see you.

1141
01:25:58,726 --> 01:26:01,763
Well, nothing like a night
in the slammer

1142
01:26:01,896 --> 01:26:04,297
to give you
a whole new perspective.

1143
01:26:18,846 --> 01:26:19,881
Casey...

1144
01:26:21,516 --> 01:26:23,584
I've been knowing you

1145
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:26,219
ever since you were
just a glimmer

1146
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:28,488
in your mama and daddy's eye.

1147
01:26:33,928 --> 01:26:35,429
I love you, son.

1148
01:26:36,329 --> 01:26:37,832
God knows I love you.

1149
01:26:40,535 --> 01:26:42,502
This whole community loves you.

1150
01:26:44,271 --> 01:26:47,875
But it's getting about past time

1151
01:26:48,009 --> 01:26:49,711
for you to tell somebody

1152
01:26:49,844 --> 01:26:52,245
what happened to you over there.

1153
01:26:58,519 --> 01:27:01,455
The only people I want to
talk to about that are dead.

1154
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:14,702
That old boy
needed to be checked,

1155
01:27:14,836 --> 01:27:17,237
but you didn't need
to beat him half to death.

1156
01:27:19,073 --> 01:27:20,407
What say you?

1157
01:27:48,603 --> 01:27:50,671
Case, I don't
want to push too hard.

1158
01:27:53,406 --> 01:27:55,743
I realize some things take time.

1159
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,916
But don't stay in
the wilderness too long.

1160
01:28:04,519 --> 01:28:07,021
Sometimes bad things
take root...

1161
01:28:09,356 --> 01:28:11,025
if you let them fester.

1162
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:25,006
We'd love for you to go to
church with us in the morning.

1163
01:28:26,439 --> 01:28:29,376
Mean a lot to your mother
and grandmother.

1164
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:45,860
So, Jesus' disciples came to him

1165
01:28:45,993 --> 01:28:48,763
with a very
interesting question.

1166
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:53,267
They said, "Lord, who sinned?

1167
01:28:54,101 --> 01:28:57,504
"This man or his parents,
that he should be born blind?"

1168
01:28:57,638 --> 01:29:00,708
Jesus said neither.

1169
01:29:00,842 --> 01:29:05,279
It's what theologians
call the mystery of evil.

1170
01:29:05,412 --> 01:29:08,816
How can good and evil coexist

1171
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:11,953
to bring about the glory of God?

1172
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:21,055
Pop... did you fight
in the war like my daddy?

1173
01:30:22,123 --> 01:30:24,424
Yeah, it was
called World War II.

1174
01:30:25,293 --> 01:30:26,994
We fought a great evil...

1175
01:30:28,229 --> 01:30:29,697
and we won.

1176
01:30:30,898 --> 01:30:33,167
Many good men did not return.

1177
01:30:35,069 --> 01:30:37,305
Casey, you need to always
be thankful.

1178
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:39,040
Thankful for the sacrifices

1179
01:30:39,173 --> 01:30:40,741
others have made for you.

1180
01:30:59,226 --> 01:31:00,460
Morning.

1181
01:31:08,936 --> 01:31:10,237
Where are you headed?

1182
01:31:11,372 --> 01:31:12,840
Gonna go see Maria.

1183
01:31:14,709 --> 01:31:16,110
Does she know you're coming?

1184
01:31:17,511 --> 01:31:18,746
No.

1185
01:31:20,982 --> 01:31:22,350
Don't you think
you should give her

1186
01:31:22,482 --> 01:31:24,819
a little prior notice
before just showing up?

1187
01:31:25,653 --> 01:31:27,021
See you when I'm back.

1188
01:31:51,412 --> 01:31:52,813
Hey, Maria.

1189
01:31:54,515 --> 01:31:55,916
Hello, Casey.

1190
01:32:02,757 --> 01:32:04,859
Was hoping we could
talk for a bit.

1191
01:32:18,572 --> 01:32:20,174
I'm sorry for what I did.

1192
01:32:23,878 --> 01:32:25,212
I forgive you.

1193
01:32:26,847 --> 01:32:28,158
Leaving in the middle
of the night

1194
01:32:28,182 --> 01:32:29,622
without telling me
where you're going

1195
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:30,927
and not responding to my letters

1196
01:32:30,951 --> 01:32:32,653
sure didn't
feel like forgiveness.

1197
01:32:32,787 --> 01:32:34,355
You ignored my letter, too.

1198
01:32:34,488 --> 01:32:36,090
Never got a letter from you.

1199
01:32:36,223 --> 01:32:37,691
Well, I sent one
eight months ago,

1200
01:32:37,825 --> 01:32:39,827
and I never heard anything
back from you.

1201
01:32:44,832 --> 01:32:46,934
You know, forgiveness
is one thing.

1202
01:32:47,735 --> 01:32:49,170
But growing up
with another person

1203
01:32:49,303 --> 01:32:51,906
in a committed love
relationship for a lifetime...

1204
01:32:52,873 --> 01:32:54,341
that's even bigger.

1205
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:58,579
Ideals are prickly things.

1206
01:33:00,047 --> 01:33:03,117
Without them, life
isn't worth much, and...

1207
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:07,721
with them can come
disappointment.

1208
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:11,192
I grew up believing
that cowboys were tried

1209
01:33:11,325 --> 01:33:14,261
and true to their word

1210
01:33:14,395 --> 01:33:15,830
and their people.

1211
01:33:17,798 --> 01:33:19,733
And especially their women.

1212
01:33:22,169 --> 01:33:25,639
I can fix it.
We can put it back together.

1213
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:32,913
What we had was so special.

1214
01:33:36,551 --> 01:33:37,885
So unique.

1215
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:42,656
I thought it was a one
in a million kind of thing.

1216
01:33:45,826 --> 01:33:47,661
I thought it was sacred.

1217
01:33:47,795 --> 01:33:50,998
But... you trashed it.

1218
01:33:53,901 --> 01:33:57,338
And if you would trash it
in the best of times,

1219
01:33:57,471 --> 01:33:58,973
how could I ever trust you

1220
01:33:59,106 --> 01:34:01,108
to be there when
the days go dark?

1221
01:34:02,309 --> 01:34:05,012
I... cannot.

1222
01:34:05,146 --> 01:34:08,749
And I will not live
with a man I cannot trust.

1223
01:34:12,419 --> 01:34:14,188
Some awfully hard words.

1224
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:18,459
Sometimes life is hard.

1225
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:22,363
Sometimes we make them hard
by our own actions.

1226
01:34:22,496 --> 01:34:24,932
Doesn't that tried and true
go both ways?

1227
01:34:27,668 --> 01:34:29,170
I'm in a bad place, Maria,

1228
01:34:29,303 --> 01:34:32,940
I thought my oldest and
best friend could help me out.

1229
01:34:33,073 --> 01:34:35,376
I know you're in
a bad place, Casey.

1230
01:34:37,278 --> 01:34:40,080
And that something bad must
have happened in Afghanistan.

1231
01:34:40,214 --> 01:34:42,049
But we have too much history.

1232
01:34:42,183 --> 01:34:45,386
We're too emotionally entangled.

1233
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,955
And I'm trying to rebuild
my shattered dreams

1234
01:34:48,088 --> 01:34:50,024
and find a way forward.

1235
01:34:51,125 --> 01:34:53,093
And with God's help,
I'm gonna make it.

1236
01:34:58,732 --> 01:35:00,134
I know you're suffering.

1237
01:35:02,169 --> 01:35:05,940
And I want the Lord to heal you
and to restore you.

1238
01:35:10,144 --> 01:35:12,479
You have no idea what
happened to me over there.

1239
01:35:16,116 --> 01:35:18,018
You just throw me out?

1240
01:35:18,152 --> 01:35:21,889
And then you have the nerve
to preach to me about God,

1241
01:35:22,022 --> 01:35:25,960
- you selfish, sanctimonious...
- That's it.

1242
01:35:26,794 --> 01:35:29,263
Get out. Leave!

1243
01:35:31,332 --> 01:35:35,069
You have crushed
every dream I ever had.

1244
01:35:37,905 --> 01:35:43,410
Don't ever come see me again
unless God has changed you.

1245
01:35:47,281 --> 01:35:49,383
I can't go through
another crushing.

1246
01:35:51,819 --> 01:35:53,187
Sorry.

1247
01:37:00,287 --> 01:37:01,287
Hi, Mom.

1248
01:37:01,322 --> 01:37:03,792
<i>Casey, Pop is sick.</i>

1249
01:37:04,559 --> 01:37:06,493
We're at a hospital
in Albuquerque.

1250
01:37:09,296 --> 01:37:10,998
What's wrong with him?

1251
01:37:11,865 --> 01:37:13,265
That shrapnel from
the war has moved

1252
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:14,769
and caused some damage

1253
01:37:14,902 --> 01:37:16,303
and he's developed an infection.

1254
01:37:16,437 --> 01:37:19,306
It's... it's not responding
to the antibiotics.

1255
01:37:20,974 --> 01:37:22,242
Casey, it's not good.

1256
01:37:22,376 --> 01:37:24,011
You need to get here
as soon as you can.

1257
01:37:24,813 --> 01:37:26,347
<i>He's asking for you.</i>

1258
01:37:27,247 --> 01:37:28,482
Yeah, I'm on my way.

1259
01:37:28,616 --> 01:37:30,552
Just tell him I'm on my way,
all right?

1260
01:37:30,685 --> 01:37:31,919
Okay.

1261
01:37:55,744 --> 01:37:58,011
Well, did you get the girl?

1262
01:37:58,145 --> 01:38:02,182
Uh... I'm working on that.

1263
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:04,686
How are you doing?

1264
01:38:04,819 --> 01:38:08,355
I feel about like I look,
which ain't too good.

1265
01:38:08,489 --> 01:38:11,425
You look pretty amazing to me.

1266
01:38:13,026 --> 01:38:14,261
Well...

1267
01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:18,966
I believe the old thumper's
about to quit on me.

1268
01:38:21,101 --> 01:38:24,839
Man, I... I robbed
the Angel of Death

1269
01:38:24,972 --> 01:38:26,140
for several decades longer

1270
01:38:26,273 --> 01:38:27,876
than the doctors
thought I'd have.

1271
01:38:28,008 --> 01:38:30,210
So I got no complaints.

1272
01:38:32,246 --> 01:38:36,818
You ladies, give me and Casey
a little time alone

1273
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:38,385
for a few minutes?

1274
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:41,689
We'll be outside if you need us.

1275
01:38:55,302 --> 01:38:57,137
I know you're in trouble.

1276
01:38:59,473 --> 01:39:01,609
I know you know
you're in trouble.

1277
01:39:04,178 --> 01:39:07,948
The trouble you're in,
I've been there.

1278
01:39:10,885 --> 01:39:14,154
Casey, I don't know
what happened over there.

1279
01:39:15,322 --> 01:39:19,159
It's a world that'll break
a man in a thousand pieces.

1280
01:39:20,294 --> 01:39:21,796
And when it does,

1281
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:24,833
there's only one architect
in the universe

1282
01:39:24,965 --> 01:39:26,433
that can put it together.

1283
01:39:27,301 --> 01:39:29,503
That's our Heavenly Father.

1284
01:39:33,908 --> 01:39:35,643
Case, he did it for me.

1285
01:39:37,779 --> 01:39:39,514
He can do it for you.

1286
01:39:45,285 --> 01:39:47,221
Pop, I killed my men.

1287
01:39:49,524 --> 01:39:52,292
I don't believe that, Case.

1288
01:39:55,095 --> 01:39:58,131
We were ambushed
by about 50 Taliban.

1289
01:39:59,567 --> 01:40:04,104
Went down the mountain,
Alamoed in an abandoned house.

1290
01:40:08,041 --> 01:40:10,210
Two wounded,
but we were fighting.

1291
01:40:11,846 --> 01:40:13,648
Called in CAS and evac.

1292
01:40:17,619 --> 01:40:20,622
And a little girl ran out into
the middle of the firefight.

1293
01:40:24,291 --> 01:40:26,093
So I went and got her.

1294
01:40:27,829 --> 01:40:29,229
Brought her back.

1295
01:40:34,434 --> 01:40:37,437
She was wired with explosives
and blew us all up.

1296
01:40:43,011 --> 01:40:47,114
If it wasn't for me,
my men would still be alive.

1297
01:40:49,182 --> 01:40:52,987
No, Case.
No, Case.

1298
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,522
No, Case.

1299
01:40:55,757 --> 01:40:58,726
You've got this thing all
twisted up in your mind.

1300
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:05,567
That was heroism
in its purest form.

1301
01:41:06,968 --> 01:41:10,470
That was self-sacrificing love.

1302
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:13,140
No, Pop.

1303
01:41:13,273 --> 01:41:15,208
Those men were my best friends.

1304
01:41:16,143 --> 01:41:17,812
The best men I've ever known.

1305
01:41:18,713 --> 01:41:20,247
And I don't even have
the courage

1306
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:22,215
to go talk to their families.

1307
01:41:23,383 --> 01:41:25,285
I can't even tell them
what happened.

1308
01:41:26,854 --> 01:41:28,155
Can't face 'em.

1309
01:41:29,089 --> 01:41:30,592
You can do this.

1310
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:34,729
You've got to do this.

1311
01:41:34,862 --> 01:41:40,802
Those families, they deserve
to know how their sons died.

1312
01:41:40,935 --> 01:41:46,206
They deserve to know how brave
and valiant they were.

1313
01:41:47,809 --> 01:41:50,210
And you can relay that
to them, Case.

1314
01:41:51,244 --> 01:41:52,814
The cowboy way.

1315
01:41:54,214 --> 01:41:56,183
I lost Maria too, Pop.

1316
01:42:00,387 --> 01:42:02,155
She was supposed to be
my love of my life,

1317
01:42:02,289 --> 01:42:05,727
but I... betrayed her.

1318
01:42:07,294 --> 01:42:08,663
Broke her trust.

1319
01:42:10,632 --> 01:42:12,800
She told me she never
wanted to see me again.

1320
01:42:15,335 --> 01:42:16,738
Case...

1321
01:42:18,039 --> 01:42:19,373
I see you.

1322
01:42:24,979 --> 01:42:28,816
I see you through the eyes...

1323
01:42:29,984 --> 01:42:31,653
of our heavenly Father.

1324
01:42:32,687 --> 01:42:35,422
And I know what He has
planned for you.

1325
01:42:36,456 --> 01:42:39,359
And I know how He feels
about you.

1326
01:42:44,565 --> 01:42:47,200
Come talk with Him.

1327
01:42:48,268 --> 01:42:49,604
With me.

1328
01:42:56,811 --> 01:42:58,513
Oh, Lord God.

1329
01:42:59,947 --> 01:43:01,616
I thank You for Casey.

1330
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:04,752
I thank You for the man he is.

1331
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,555
I thank You
for the man he's gonna be.

1332
01:43:11,626 --> 01:43:15,295
I pray that You would bring
and put the pieces of

1333
01:43:15,429 --> 01:43:18,566
his life, his soul, his spirit,

1334
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:20,835
that You put it back
together again.

1335
01:43:20,968 --> 01:43:26,339
Father, I know this man.
I know this man.

1336
01:43:32,947 --> 01:43:36,383
I know what he's made of.

1337
01:43:37,719 --> 01:43:40,822
I pray that You would open
the eyes of his heart.

1338
01:43:41,622 --> 01:43:44,826
The power of Your Holy Spirit
would come upon him,

1339
01:43:44,959 --> 01:43:46,226
You to heal him.

1340
01:43:46,359 --> 01:43:47,862
You'd put the
pieces of his soul,

1341
01:43:47,995 --> 01:43:50,098
of his spirit
back together again.

1342
01:43:50,898 --> 01:43:53,067
I pray, Lord, that You'd
give him the courage

1343
01:43:53,201 --> 01:43:55,435
to go see those families.

1344
01:43:55,570 --> 01:44:00,942
Lord, I pray that You'll
bring him the woman

1345
01:44:01,075 --> 01:44:02,677
of Your design.

1346
01:44:04,244 --> 01:44:06,346
And Lord, if it's okay with You,

1347
01:44:07,347 --> 01:44:09,517
I pray that it be Maria.

1348
01:44:11,152 --> 01:44:12,887
I thank You for Casey.

1349
01:44:13,721 --> 01:44:16,791
I love him with all that I am

1350
01:44:16,924 --> 01:44:18,726
and all that I have.

1351
01:44:19,994 --> 01:44:23,463
In Jesus' name, Amen.

1352
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:15,382
I thought you might
slip in a little late.

1353
01:45:17,919 --> 01:45:18,953
Maria.

1354
01:45:20,087 --> 01:45:22,890
You were one of
Bo's favorite people

1355
01:45:23,658 --> 01:45:25,993
in the whole wide world.

1356
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:29,396
I feel like an orphan.

1357
01:45:31,699 --> 01:45:36,369
I've abandoned those
most dear to me, and...

1358
01:45:37,672 --> 01:45:40,641
now, I have no opportunity
to make it right.

1359
01:45:43,978 --> 01:45:47,515
Some of the most
ominous words in the Bible

1360
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:51,052
are "forgive us our sins

1361
01:45:52,253 --> 01:45:53,955
as we forgive others."

1362
01:45:55,957 --> 01:45:59,694
I think I know
a couple of young people

1363
01:46:00,661 --> 01:46:03,097
that are gonna have
to deal with that.

1364
01:46:40,101 --> 01:46:41,636
Bye, boy.

1365
01:47:41,395 --> 01:47:42,863
God!

1366
01:47:50,304 --> 01:47:51,939
Where are you?

1367
01:47:59,347 --> 01:48:02,683
You have taken everything
that I've dreamed and loved.

1368
01:48:08,255 --> 01:48:12,026
Jesus... Jesus... Jesus.

1369
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:20,334
Please.

1370
01:48:20,468 --> 01:48:24,105
Please, please, please.

1371
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:27,108
Please.

1372
01:49:27,034 --> 01:49:30,438
Case, don't ever forget
what's important in life.

1373
01:49:30,571 --> 01:49:35,042
Friendship with God.
Family. Friends.

1374
01:49:36,343 --> 01:49:37,745
Meaningful work.

1375
01:49:38,612 --> 01:49:40,214
One good horse.

1376
01:51:43,304 --> 01:51:44,738
Casey.

1377
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:47,975
I know. I saw.

1378
01:51:49,243 --> 01:51:51,145
All your loved ones are with me.

1379
01:51:52,846 --> 01:51:56,050
Someday, you will understand.

1380
01:51:56,183 --> 01:51:58,252
But for now, you must trust me.

1381
01:51:59,153 --> 01:52:01,322
It's time to
come out of the darkness.

1382
01:52:02,356 --> 01:52:03,457
And walk with me.

1383
01:52:17,771 --> 01:52:19,206
God, is that you?

1384
01:54:11,452 --> 01:54:12,986
Casey...

1385
01:54:16,990 --> 01:54:19,426
We were worried sick about you.

1386
01:54:24,666 --> 01:54:26,333
I'm gonna be okay, Mom.

1387
01:54:34,274 --> 01:54:36,143
Well, that went all right.

1388
01:57:19,473 --> 01:57:20,542
Hey, Kel.

1389
01:57:25,914 --> 01:57:27,247
Is she here?

1390
01:57:28,048 --> 01:57:29,283
No.

1391
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:33,453
Do you know where she's at?

1392
01:57:36,558 --> 01:57:37,659
Casey...

1393
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:43,363
I know she loves you in
a profound and inescapable way.

1394
01:57:46,466 --> 01:57:48,235
Now I need to know...

1395
01:57:49,804 --> 01:57:51,639
are you gonna cowboy up?

1396
01:57:53,373 --> 01:57:54,842
With all my heart.

1397
01:58:16,564 --> 01:58:19,333
She's at her grandparents'
house in Lordsburg.

1398
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:24,572
Go get her.

1399
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:26,841
I'm pulling for you.

1400
01:58:37,585 --> 01:58:38,620
Kel...

1401
01:58:44,626 --> 01:58:45,660
Thank you.

1402
01:58:54,267 --> 01:58:55,903
Thank you, hon.

1403
01:58:58,305 --> 01:59:00,374
Oh, and that one, that sunset.

1404
01:59:00,508 --> 01:59:02,442
Isn't it beautiful?

1405
01:59:25,365 --> 01:59:26,934
Daddy, no.

1406
01:59:29,302 --> 01:59:31,204
I'll take care of this.

1407
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:50,658
What are you doing here, Casey?

1408
01:59:52,192 --> 01:59:54,394
I don't want to lose you, Maria.

1409
01:59:56,731 --> 01:59:58,398
I've loved you my whole life.

1410
01:59:58,533 --> 02:00:00,668
I knew as a little boy
that I wanted to marry you.

1411
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:07,709
Casey, that's mighty bold.

1412
02:00:08,509 --> 02:00:11,579
Do you think I can just
take your word for it?

1413
02:00:11,713 --> 02:00:14,182
How could I ever trust you?

1414
02:00:14,314 --> 02:00:16,050
Look into my eyes, Maria.

1415
02:00:17,085 --> 02:00:19,352
As God is my witness,
I'll be true to you.

1416
02:00:20,154 --> 02:00:21,689
God is healing me
and delivering me

1417
02:00:21,823 --> 02:00:24,224
from the darkness, and I will
not drag you down into it.

1418
02:00:30,131 --> 02:00:33,500
There's a lot of water passed
under the bridge, Casey.

1419
02:00:34,468 --> 02:00:36,838
A broken heart
is a complex thing.

1420
02:00:39,406 --> 02:00:40,942
I'll always love you, Maria.

1421
02:00:47,782 --> 02:00:49,784
I know with sin
comes consequences,

1422
02:00:49,917 --> 02:00:53,921
and I'll have to live with that.

1423
02:00:56,490 --> 02:00:59,227
I just want you to know
you're such a beautiful,

1424
02:00:59,359 --> 02:01:03,463
extraordinary woman,
truly Godly woman.

1425
02:01:05,767 --> 02:01:07,668
I just want the best for you...

1426
02:01:08,703 --> 02:01:10,403
even if that's not with me.

1427
02:01:16,376 --> 02:01:18,345
You deserve better than me.

1428
02:02:09,329 --> 02:02:11,098
You're gonna buck off that easy?

1429
02:02:15,937 --> 02:02:17,038
Never again.

1430
02:05:52,853 --> 02:05:53,988
What can I do for you?

1431
02:05:54,121 --> 02:05:56,090
- Mr. Shane?
- Yeah.

1432
02:05:56,223 --> 02:05:58,826
Isaiah Smith,
Kwan's little brother.

1433
02:06:07,368 --> 02:06:08,736
Man.

1434
02:06:10,838 --> 02:06:12,740
You got to be kidding me.

1435
02:06:13,808 --> 02:06:15,208
I didn't recognize you
all grown up.

1436
02:06:15,276 --> 02:06:17,036
What are you doing
all the way out here, huh?

1437
02:06:17,144 --> 02:06:20,781
A man you knew well,
and the best man I ever knew.

1438
02:06:21,782 --> 02:06:23,150
My best friend.

1439
02:06:23,984 --> 02:06:28,355
He told me about a place
where the wind blows free

1440
02:06:28,489 --> 02:06:30,591
and the sky meets the horizon.

1441
02:06:31,692 --> 02:06:33,694
A place my ancestors
helped settle.

1442
02:06:34,895 --> 02:06:36,630
He said he would bring me
here one day,

1443
02:06:36,764 --> 02:06:38,032
but in chance that he couldn't,

1444
02:06:38,165 --> 02:06:40,134
I was to come here alone
and meet you,

1445
02:06:40,267 --> 02:06:42,636
and you would give me
a job in his place.

1446
02:06:44,872 --> 02:06:46,774
Yeah, well,
he wasn't lying to you.

1447
02:06:48,577 --> 02:06:50,111
Oh, and he also said

1448
02:06:50,244 --> 02:06:52,847
you have a shortage
of Black folks out here.

1449
02:06:54,782 --> 02:06:56,917
Man, he wasn't lying
about that, either.

1450
02:06:58,285 --> 02:07:00,589
Welcome home.
Welcome home.

1451
02:07:00,721 --> 02:07:02,056
All right, hop in.

1452
02:07:04,992 --> 02:07:06,260
You rode a horse before?

1453
02:07:06,393 --> 02:07:08,662
- No.
- Okay.

1454
02:07:10,097 --> 02:07:12,199
- You fix things?
- No.

1455
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:14,335
All right.

1456
02:07:16,403 --> 02:07:18,706
- Got any boots?
- No.

1457
02:07:18,839 --> 02:07:21,842
No?
We'll figure it out.

1458
02:08:23,237 --> 02:08:25,039
All right, Bo.

1459
02:08:25,172 --> 02:08:27,141
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

1460
02:08:27,274 --> 02:08:29,476
Cowboy, just like you, Pop.

1461
02:08:30,477 --> 02:08:32,746
We come from
a long line of cowboys.

1462
02:08:33,682 --> 02:08:35,816
We love big sky, open range.

1463
02:08:36,585 --> 02:08:38,385
We work hard.

1464
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:40,020
Man of our word.

1465
02:08:42,056 --> 02:08:44,124
Loyal to our friends and family.

1466
02:08:45,259 --> 02:08:47,061
Treat everyone with respect,

1467
02:08:47,861 --> 02:08:49,330
especially our women.

1468
02:08:51,533 --> 02:08:52,800
Courageous.

1469
02:08:53,734 --> 02:08:55,236
Fearing God and no man.

1470
02:08:57,706 --> 02:09:00,040
Don't forget the important
things in life, Bo.

1471
02:09:01,610 --> 02:09:03,143
Friendship with God.

1472
02:09:03,277 --> 02:09:04,845
Family, friends.

1473
02:09:04,979 --> 02:09:06,480
And a good horse.

1474
02:09:08,282 --> 02:09:12,753
If you do that,
you'll be a rich man...

1475
02:09:13,988 --> 02:09:15,422
and a good cowboy.

1476
02:09:21,228 --> 02:09:23,063
That's what I want to be.
