00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:14,608
Can we get you anything?

3
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:15,942
No, no thanks.

4
00:00:16,074 --> 00:00:18,273
All right, Officer
Hutchinson will be right in.

5
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:19,875
Thank you.

00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:23,675
[door closing]

00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:39,641
[door opening and closing]

8
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:47,373
How are you?

9
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,875
This is Officer Hutchinson,

10
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,440
the date is Thursday,
September 12th, 2019.

11
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:58,741
[beep] Police Department,
regarding case 2018-010-075.

12
00:01:01,473 --> 00:01:03,741
This is a multiple homicide
investigation

13
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:08,206
that occurred at the [beep].

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,808
I'm here seated with the
victim's mother, Nancy Williams.

15
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:13,373
Nancy for voice identification
purposes,

16
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:16,173
please state your name out loud?

17
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:18,240
Nancy Williams.

18
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:21,206
Okay, the time is 1515 hours.

19
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:27,641
Okay, we're here to present you

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,273
with the film made by the
culprits

21
00:01:32,407 --> 00:01:34,708
in connection with your
daughter Katie's murder,

22
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:36,775
along with her friends.

23
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:40,608
Thank you.

24
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:42,575
You instructed us you'd rather

25
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,008
watch that here with someone.

26
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,508
Well, I just feel safer here,

27
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:49,608
I don't have anybody
else and I'm all alone.

28
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:51,140
That's why I was willing to do
it.

29
00:01:51,273 --> 00:01:52,440
Thank you.

30
00:01:54,875 --> 00:02:00,042
I must warn you again that
this footage is quite graphic.

31
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:02,273
I've been doing police work for
15 years,

32
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:06,173
I've never seen anything quite
like this.

33
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:08,474
And granted it's a small
town, not much happens,

34
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:10,975
but ask any of my three officers

35
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:15,273
and they'll tell you the same,
this is complete insanity.

36
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:18,441
You mean it's like a real
movie?

37
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:22,273
What kind of sick people
do stuff like this?

38
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:23,808
Well, you could call it a
movie.

39
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:28,173
There's music, different
scenes, they've edited together,

40
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:30,741
they really knew what they were
doing.

41
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,273
Filmmakers or something.

42
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:34,875
I know it seems insane that

43
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,942
they would wanna document
their crimes and sell that,

44
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,741
but once something like this

45
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,875
hits the black market overseas,

46
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:43,373
that's where it usually stays.

47
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:46,808
Apparently there's a lot of
money in it.

48
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:48,441
I'm ready, I won't sleep at
night

49
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:51,474
until you put these people away.

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,173
Well, we do have most
of them in custody,

51
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:02,307
and our goal is to eliminate
anyone

52
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,575
who's had any part in this.

53
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:06,708
Thank you.

54
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:13,708
I assure you we'll reach
our ultimate goal on that.

55
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:27,007
Now, if for any reason
this becomes too much,

56
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,875
or you need me to stop at any
time,

57
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:31,307
please let me know and I will.

58
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:34,273
I appreciate that, thank you.

59
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:39,975
[Jin] Hello, welcome to my
restaurant.

60
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:41,173
Hi, thank you.

61
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:42,675
[Jin] Are you dining alone?

62
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:44,641
No, my boyfriend's in the
bathroom.

63
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:46,307
[Jin] Oh, okay.

64
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:48,808
Thank you.

65
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:50,474
[Jin] You don't mind if I
take a picture of you, do you?

66
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,140
I like to have them in my
restaurant

67
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,942
for very special guests.

68
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:54,942
Sure!

69
00:03:56,007 --> 00:04:00,041
[Jin] So on three, say
sushi, one, two, three.

70
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,541
Sushi!

71
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:05,374
Oh, wait-
[ominous music]

72
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,474
[Reo] Wake up beautiful.

73
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:24,408
[Katie groaning]

74
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,508
Happy birthday, baby.

75
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:32,575
Aw, they're beautiful, thank
you.

76
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,408
[Reo] Come on, it's your
birthday.

77
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:40,508
You gotta get up early,
it's only come once a year.

78
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:45,308
Oh, you're supposed to
sleep in on your birthday.

79
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:47,874
What is with the camera, Reo?

80
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:51,741
[Reo] Well, I wasn't sure
what to get you this year.

81
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:56,007
So I decided I would document
your 35th birthday on camera,

82
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,708
so you will always have it as a
memory.

83
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:01,840
Oh, that's thoughtful, I
guess.

84
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:06,708
[Reo] I eventually added
two or 10 minutes of video.

85
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:10,041
It's very thoughtful Reo.

86
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:11,575
I look like shit right now,
though.

87
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,408
[Reo] You always beautiful.

88
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:18,675
These tits so great, baby.

89
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:22,508
I know, like you tell
me on a daily basis.

90
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:24,274
Also, if you wanted to get me
something

91
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:26,174
that lasted a lifetime,

92
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:28,974
you could have gotten
me an engagement ring.

93
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:30,840
[Reo] That will come soon.

94
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,474
I've been hearing that for a
year now.

95
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:35,840
[Reo] I have the day
all planned out for you,

96
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:37,073
we have a lot to do.

97
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:40,174
Oh, really, and what is that?

98
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:43,007
[Reo] Just follow my lead.

99
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,608
Okay, well, I'm going to get a
shower,

100
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:49,441
and you are not documenting
that.

101
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,974
[Reo] Can I, please?

102
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:53,041
No, shut it off!

103
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:55,341
[Reo] All right, fine.

104
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:12,675
[water running]

105
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:30,374
Reo, what the fuck, I
told you not the shower!

106
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:34,308
[Reo] Aw, come on babe,
this won't make the final cut.

107
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:35,541
Stop, seriously?

108
00:07:35,675 --> 00:07:38,575
Stop videoing me on my birthday!

109
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:47,073
[Reo] How are they?

110
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:50,641
They're good, what are you
looking at?

111
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:54,575

[Waiter] You're welcome,
enjoy.

123
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,274
[Reo] I had to it.

124
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:25,241
Most embarrassing thing ever.

125
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:37,007
Are you trying to get me fat?

126
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,274
There has to be close to
1,500 calories in this slice.

127
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:41,575
[Reo] Hey, it's your birthday,

128
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:44,740
there's no calorie counting
today.

129
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:48,575
Yeah, you're right, you're
right.

130
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:51,508
[Reo] You should be ordering
cocktails.

131
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:52,907
It's 10:00 in the morning!

132
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:54,874
[Reo] You've gotta
give us some good stuff

133
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:57,441
to make this video exciting.

134
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,608
How about you can film us
fucking later?

135
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,508
[Reo] Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

136
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:05,740
You wouldn't let me film
you in the shower earlier,

137
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:10,074
but now you are ready
to make a porn video?

138
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:12,774
I'm obviously kidding.

139
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:15,008
[Reo] Time for the cake?

140
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:16,740
Do you want a piece?

141
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:19,807
[Reo] No, you know I hate
cake.

142
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:25,207
Come one, you have to,

143
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,441
it's bad luck not to eat a
piece of my birthday cake.

144
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:34,042
[Reo] You're right, it is.

145
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:39,807
But first, I have to document
you actually eating cake.

146
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:49,707
Come on, you can do it.

147
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:57,941
It's terrible.

148
00:09:58,074 --> 00:10:02,341
[Katie] It's delicious,
suck it up buttercup.

149
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:07,241
See that's not so bad, I'm proud
of you.

150
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,707
Asian don't eat cake.

151
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,575
[Katie] Well you should
then, 'cause it's delicious.

152
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:22,042
[Reo] Not that many people
here today.

153
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:23,674
You enjoy that, huh?

154
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:27,374
Yeah, I'm over the
whole calorie thing now.

155
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:29,441
[Reo] Now you're in
the birthdays feeling.

156
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:31,441
Just wait till tonight.

157
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:33,207
[Reo] Lots of wine.

158
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,441
Oh, you're gonna drink?

159
00:10:35,574 --> 00:10:37,174
[Reo] You're ready to get
outta here?

160
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:38,907
Where are we going?

161
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,341
[Reo] You will see.

162
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,840
Oh, now I'm getting exited.

163
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,541
[Reo] Okay, let me get that.

164

[train chugging]

165
00:10:59,474 --> 00:11:00,975
Why didn't we just drive,

166
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:04,074
you know how I feel about
trains?

[bright music]

168
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:31,908
I do like this one.

169
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:33,875
[Reo] Yeah, that's sexy.

170
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:35,107
Should I try it on?

171
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:36,674
[Reo] Yeah, you look great in
red.

172
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:38,640
Would you like to try that
dress on?

173
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:39,875
It's a beautiful dress.

174
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:43,774
Yes, I would love to,
oh wait, never mind.

175
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:46,008
It's 30% off today.

176
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:47,707
[Reo] Just try it on Kate.

177
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,942
Did you see the price?

178
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:50,374
[Reo] Don't worry about the
price,

179
00:11:50,507 --> 00:11:52,975
I want you to look
amazing tonight, I got it.

180
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:55,707
Did you hit the lottery
overnight or something?

181
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,107
[Reo] Maybe.

182
00:11:57,241 --> 00:11:59,308
Okay, I'll take you to the
fitting room.

183
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:01,341
[Katie] Thank you.

184
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:08,074
I'm sorry sir, you can't
come back to the fitting room.

185
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:10,441
[Reo] Okay, no problem.

186
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,674
- How?
- It's perfect.

187
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:34,774
- It's not too dressy?
- Nope, perfect.

188
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:37,341
- Should I get it?
- If you like it?

189
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:39,674
- Oh, I love it.
- Let's get it.

190
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:43,241
What other discount you can
offer?

191
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:45,540
I'm already offering you 30%
off.

192
00:12:45,674 --> 00:12:48,540
[Reo] But can you take
another 5% off for her birthday?

193
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:51,141
I wish I could, but I just
work here.

194
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:53,740
[Reo] Okay, can't say I didn't
try.

195
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,607
So what's with the camera?

196
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,042
[Reo] I'm documenting her
birthday from start to finish.

197
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:01,107
- Oh, nice.
- Don't ask!

198
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:06,408
[laughs] Okay, that come to
$395.

199
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:26,942
Would you like a receipt
or I can email you one?

200
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,975
[Roe] Email, please.

201
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:31,407
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

202
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,574
[All] Cheers!

203
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,274
That was good.

204
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,507
I told you, it's my favorite.

205
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,942
What is it?

206
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:08,407
Simple syrup, cranberry
juice, and a touch of vodka.

207
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,640
So it's just sugar
with a touch of alcohol?

208
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:12,908
Basically, yes.

209
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,775
What are you guys doing
tonight for your 35th?

210
00:14:14,908 --> 00:14:17,174
[Reo] I'm going to take her
to the restaurant I work at,

211
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:18,741
some of the best food around.

212
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,340
Yes, I love that place,
we were there last week,

213
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:24,207
food is phenomenal, it's just
out of this world, really.

214
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,708
How long have you worked
there, Reo?

215
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:27,975
[Reo] About eight months
now, thanks to Brian.

216
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:29,174
Ready for another shot.

217
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:31,008
[Bartender] Ready for another
round?

218
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:34,008
[Reo] Oh yes, we sure are.

219
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:38,507
Oh boy, and I guess
[indistinct].

220
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,440
[Reo] Me too, just the way I
planned it.

221
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:42,875
You having all the time of your
life

222
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,507
by me getting it all on film.

223
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:50,373
[Reo] Hey bartender, can
you get us doing the shot?

224
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:52,607
[Bartender] Sure.

225
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:53,574
Ready?

226
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:59,507
To Katie 35th, and to good
health, many more to come.

227
00:15:00,307 --> 00:15:01,675
[All] Cheers!

228
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,274
My turn to do some
documenting.

229
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,540
Oh yeah, what are you going to
document?

230
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:18,708
[Katie] Well, I wanna ask you
something.

231
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:19,675
Yes?

232
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:22,207
[Katie] And I want it on the
record,

233
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,607
what do you love about me?

234
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:27,708
I mean, what don't I love
about you?

235
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:31,675
[Katie] I'm listening,
and the camera is blotching,

236
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,741
so go ahead and say it?

237
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:37,307
Okay, where do I start?

238
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,808
You are beautiful, sweet,
caring, sexy,

239
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:45,174
you're fantastic in bed.

240
00:15:45,307 --> 00:15:47,241
[Katie] Keep going.

241
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:49,507
Smart, I haven't met someone

242
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:52,307
as intelligent as you in a
while.

243
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,174
[Katie] What do you guys
think?

244
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:57,174
Is he being truthful or
just trying to get laid?

245
00:15:57,307 --> 00:16:00,042
Oh no, he's being such a
sweetheart,

246
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:02,042
that was so sweet Reo.

247
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:05,107
He is absolutely without a
question

248
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,942
of a doubt trynna hit.

249
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:09,841
[Katie laughing]

250
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:13,074
I mean, I wouldn't mind
getting laid,

251
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,141
but I meant every word.

252
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,741
[Katie] I know you meant it
babe.

253
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,042
So, what are we doing tonight,
guys?

254
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:22,708
[Brian] Nothing, we
are just hanging out.

255
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:25,273
Hey, you're more than welcome
to hang with us tonight.

256
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:27,340
[Katie] Yes, I would love
that.

257
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:29,741
- Let's do it.
- We're in!

258
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,273
[Reo] So, what do you
think hun, double date?

259
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,473
Yes, I would love the company.

260
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:35,875
And we are good company.

261
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:39,008
Yeah, yeah, so what time do
you guys go?

262
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:41,507
- Its perfect.
- Can't wait.

263
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:44,042
[Reo] Hey bartender, can
you get us another shots?

264
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:45,808
[Bartender] Okay.

265
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:04,608
[Reo] Happy birthday, Katie.

266
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:06,875
Happy birthday, Katie.

267
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:08,173
Thank you.

268
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:15,373
Awesome, very cool you're
getting all this on film.

269
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:18,407
[Reo] Yeah, I know, I'm gonna
have a lot of editing to do.

270
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,841
- Sure.
- This is my gift,

271
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:23,373
so I expect it quickly mister.

272
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:26,608
[Reo] Hey masterpieces take
time.

273
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:29,240
All right, say bye guy.

274
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:30,541
[All] Bye.

275
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:34,675
Peace!

276
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:37,473
[bright music]

277
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:50,206
That isn't recording, is it?

278
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,140
No, it isn't.

279
00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:54,975
You aren't lying, are you?

280
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,541
No, I'm not.

281
00:17:56,675 --> 00:18:00,307
So why is the phone
propped up like that?

282
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,741
I was going to record, but I
didn't.

283
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:08,140
All right, I want you to lie
back.

284
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,074
Why?

285
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:16,474
I have a surprise for you.

286
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:17,474
What?

287
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,240
You will see, lie back
and close your eyes.

288
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:28,273
What are you doing?

289
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,575
Stop asking questions, just do
it.

290
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:36,273
- You're scaring me.
- Oh, don't be scared.

291
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,708
Just trust me.

292
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,340
Okay, what are you doing?

293
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:50,641
It's a surprise I said, hold
on.

294
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,206
Okay, open your eyes.

295
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
Why did you lie to me?

296
00:19:07,474 --> 00:19:09,975
I knew it was recording.

297
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:13,173
I see you try to be kinky,
huh?

298
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:15,942
Did you really think
I thought it was off,

299
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,474
and facing right at us!

300
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:22,173
You caught me, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry.

301
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:26,408
I would like to look at you,
instead of surfing porn site,

302
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,775
is better than looking at
strange woman, isn't it?

303
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:35,106
It is, but it's still
strange if you ask me.

304
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,575
How is it weird?

305
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,741
It just is.

306
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:43,273
Okay, well can we finish
[indistinct]?

307
00:19:43,408 --> 00:19:45,441
Yeah, as soon as you
turn the camera off.

308
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:46,841
Okay.

309
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:49,140
And then make sure that
stuff is deleted as well.

310
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,641
Whatever you say my dear.

311
00:19:56,441 --> 00:20:00,374
[Katie] Someone had one too
many drinks.

312
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:02,608
Reo, it's five o'clock.

313
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:05,508
[phone ringing]

314
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:08,608
Wake up Reo, work is calling
you.

315
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,841
Hello, hey Jin?

316
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:18,073
Yes, we will be there soon.

317
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:24,841
Coming in with another couple
too.

318
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,140
Okay, I'll see you then.

319
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:39,106
[Katie] I guess I'm
gonna start getting ready.

320
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,942
I'm gonna get into the shower.

321
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,173
[Katie] Or maybe I'll
sneak up on you and film it.

322
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:47,073
Go ahead, no problem at all.

323
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:56,240
- How's this?
- Very sexy.

324
00:20:57,908 --> 00:20:59,173
Good.

325
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:01,741
[Reo] You look stunning.

326
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:06,273
I really love this dress,
it fits me perfectly.

327
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,541
[Reo] I'm so glad.

328
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:15,641
Do some modeling for me in that
dress?

329
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:16,775
Like that?

330
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:21,106
[Reo] Yeah, turn around
so I can see that ass.

331
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,341
- How's that?
- Perfect.

332
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:33,173
You have made my day so
special so far, thank you.

333
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:36,073
[Reo] Just wait for tonight.

334
00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:37,775
It's gonna be a good night.

335
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:39,575
[Reo] It sure is.

336
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:45,608
[wood squeaking]

337
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:03,474
Yeah, I like it, hi?

338
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,575
[Reo] We have to have you
looking your best for tonight.

339
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:13,241
Its not like it's my 50th
birthday Reo, it's only my 35th.

340
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,775
[Reo] Every year is a
blessing.

341
00:22:14,907 --> 00:22:17,241
Ain't that the truth,
he's got a point there.

342
00:22:17,374 --> 00:22:20,140
[Reo] See, she agrees
babe, life is too short.

343
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:22,508
Yeah, you're right.

344
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,474
Doing anything special
tonight?

345
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:26,841
Yeah, we are going to
the restaurant he works at.

346
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:28,173
That sounds like so much fun.

347
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:29,775
[Reo] Oh yeah, it will be.

348
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:31,073
Well, you're all done.

349
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:32,441
Thank you.

350
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:35,741
So I have to ask,
what is with the camera?

351
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:37,508
[Reo] I'm making her a
birthday video,

352
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:40,741
documenting different
stuff throughout the day.

353
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:42,508
That is so special.

354
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:47,106
At first I thought it was
weird, but it has grown on me.

355
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,173
Something I'll always have.

356
00:22:49,308 --> 00:22:52,441
[Reo] All right, well say
bye, I'm going to turn it off.

357
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:54,041
Bye, happy birthday, Katie,

358
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,741
glad I could help make you look
beautiful.

359
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:57,741
Bye.

360
00:23:02,474 --> 00:23:04,073
Ben, I really appreciate you
coming

361
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:07,308
along with us tonight and
taking care of the camera.

362
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:09,441
[Ben] Hey, no problem at all.

363
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:11,441
I'm taking care of you
tonight.

364
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:13,374
[Ben] I appreciate my brother,

365
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:14,974
it's been rough for me lately.

366
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:16,474
It has been for me too.

367
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:19,974
But with this new gig I
got, I'm gonna be okay.

368
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,775
They can't wait to meet you.

369
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:23,140
You're gonna get a better job?

370
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:24,474
Yeah, hopefully.

371
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:26,140
You wanna talk to him tonight?

372
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:28,207
[Ben] I'll do whatever.

373
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:30,106
So how are you feeling, babe?

374
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:32,274
Great, I'm starving.

375
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:35,874
Me too, you're gonna love
their food.

376
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:37,174
You keep bragging about it,

377
00:23:37,308 --> 00:23:39,941
the anticipation is killing me.

378
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:42,441
[Ben] Turn around and say
hi to the camera, Katie?

379
00:23:42,575 --> 00:23:43,374
Hi.

380
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:44,941
[Ben] Where are you headed?

381
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:46,575
To Reo's restaurant,

382
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,641
has this amazing thing food
that he keeps raving about.

383
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:49,708
[Ben] How is day going

384
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,374
- on so far?
- What's up every one?

385
00:23:51,508 --> 00:23:53,675
- Hey guys.
- Hey, what up?

386
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,741
Hey guys?

387
00:23:57,308 --> 00:24:00,474
And you must be creepy camera
guy?

388
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,141
[Ben] Yes, I'm the hired
cameraman

389
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:06,541
- for the night.
- Nice to meet you.

390
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:09,274
[Reo] Well, I didn't wanna
hold the camera all night.

391
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:10,508
[Meghan] Smart move.

392
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:12,408
[Reo] Plus Ben needed a few
bucks.

393
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,874
Win-win situation.

394
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:16,341
[Reo] Okay, Ben,

395
00:24:16,474 --> 00:24:18,675
get a quick couple of words
from Brian and Meghan,

396
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:22,874
and then you can cut the
camera to save the battery.

397
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:25,308
Happy birthday to Katie.

398
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:30,174
My friend, my colleague,
it's gonna be a great night,

399
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:32,474
and hopefully many more
at this restaurant.

400
00:24:32,608 --> 00:24:37,374
Happy birthday, Katie,
can't wait to get you wasted.

401
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:42,241
All right, you can cut the
camera, Ben.

402
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:49,807
Nice work Ben.

403
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:52,374
[Ben] Yeah, trying to
get creative with it.

404
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:54,441
Hey, the better shots you got
me,

405
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:57,541
the better final product will
be.

406
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:18,541
Reo, hey?

407
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:22,042
Party of four, right?

408
00:25:22,174 --> 00:25:25,441
- Mh-hmm.
- Hey Reo, how are you?

409
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:27,241
Doing great, Jin, how are you?

410
00:25:27,374 --> 00:25:28,874
Doing good, thank you.

411
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:31,874
We've been waiting for you guys.

412
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:33,541
This must be our birthday girl.

413
00:25:33,674 --> 00:25:35,141
- Hi.
- Happy birthday,

414
00:25:35,274 --> 00:25:38,508
welcome to my restaurant, it's
going to be a great night,

415
00:25:38,641 --> 00:25:40,141
we will take a good care of you.

416
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:43,508
Thank you very much, it's
a great place you have here.

417
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:47,408
Hasn't been open too long,
business isn't always steady.

418
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,074
We're just trying to make it.

419
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:50,907
Well, I heard the food is
great,

420
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:53,042
so I'm sure you'll do just fine.

421
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:54,474
Thank you.

422
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:58,608
Oh, this is our
friend, Meghan and Brian.

423
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,174
- Welcome, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

424
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:02,608
Nice to meet you.

425
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,141
I hope you guys have
brought your appetite?

426
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:09,008
I'm glad that you are filming
her birthday

427
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:10,474
like you told me you would.

428
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:13,441
Yes, I brought my
buddy Ben along to do it.

429
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:15,074
You met him remember?

430
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:19,174
I remember, we can talk later
about his involvement here.

431
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:22,207
[Ben] I would love that,
thanks.

432
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:24,107
Good, follow me.

433
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:39,541
Excellent, I'll stop by later,

434
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:42,274
and see how you guys doing,
enjoy.

435
00:26:42,408 --> 00:26:44,441
- Thank you.
- Hold on.

436
00:26:45,274 --> 00:26:48,042
Do you mind if I take your
pictures?

437
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:49,374
I like to hang pictures

438
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,674
around the restaurant of our
customers.

439
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:53,508
[Katie] Yeah, that's really
great, good.

440
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,074
All right, okay, ready?

441
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:00,840
- Say, sushi!
- [All] Sushi!

442
00:27:05,474 --> 00:27:06,508
Cheers!

443
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,942
I'm starting to feel it now.

444
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:10,441
[Reo] That is the goal.

445
00:27:10,574 --> 00:27:13,374
Hey guys, how are things?

446
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:17,408
Hey, listen, this is one
of my brothers, Aikio.

447
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:21,508
He's a chef here, I
wanna introduce you guys.

448
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,408
Hello, welcome.

449
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:29,508
- Nice to meet you Aikio.
- Me too.

450
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,207
[Reo] That's my girlfriend,
Katie.

451
00:27:31,341 --> 00:27:33,508
We out here to celebrate
her birthday tonight.

452
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Make sure you're taking good
care of her.

453
00:27:35,774 --> 00:27:37,308
Beautiful, yes.

454
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,308
[Brian] Aikio?

455
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:41,774
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

456
00:27:41,908 --> 00:27:44,308
Look I'm putting all of
my faith in you man, okay?

457
00:27:44,441 --> 00:27:45,774
I'm trusting you with this food,

458
00:27:45,908 --> 00:27:47,840
now, they are hungry, so keep
them happy.

459
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:49,207
No problem.

460
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:52,008
And listen, he's one of the
chef,

461
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:53,607
that's the best chef there is,
okay?

462
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,008
We'll take a good care of
you, don't worry about it.

463
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,474
- Thank you.
- Aikio, you know what?

464
00:27:57,607 --> 00:27:59,441
I think Harvey is swamped, go
get changed.

465
00:27:59,574 --> 00:28:00,740
- Right.
- [indistinct], okay?

466
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:02,274
- A little bit, yeah.
- All right.

467
00:28:02,408 --> 00:28:06,042
- Okay, enjoy, all right.
- Thank you.

468
00:28:06,174 --> 00:28:07,840
How's the battery, Ben?

469
00:28:07,975 --> 00:28:09,942
[Ben] It's at about 3/4.

470
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:15,074
All right, save it, we have
a long night ahead of us.

471
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,308
- How's is it Reo?
- Hey, Jin?

472
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,274
So your friend here is
aware of everything, right?

473
00:28:32,408 --> 00:28:33,640
Completely.

474
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:39,341
You're getting some good
stuff?

475
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:42,942
[Ben] I'm recording everything
I can.

476
00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:47,473
These are huge over in
Asia, big market for them.

477
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:48,908
So I've heard.

478
00:28:50,141 --> 00:28:53,740
I wasn't fully aware, or I
would have made them earlier.

479
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:57,074
I was told by one of my
cousins who are there.

480
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:58,540
I'll make sure to take care

481
00:28:58,674 --> 00:29:01,841
of you guys at the end of the
night.

482
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,341
Cut the camera though, this
won't make the final cut.

483
00:29:10,174 --> 00:29:12,207
We should go out after dinner.

484
00:29:12,341 --> 00:29:14,408
Yes, my friend's been
bartending all night too,

485
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,908
we can get some free drinks
[indistinct].

486
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:18,241
- Yes!
- I'm in.

487
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:26,841
[Charlie] Hey, you guys
ready for some magic?

488
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:27,942
[Brian] Magic?

489
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:29,408
- Yeah.
- Whoa, what up Charlie?

490
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,341
Hey buddy, you didn't tell 'em
about me?

491
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:32,975
[Reo] This guy is the best
I've seen.

492
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:34,074
[Brian] Oh yeah?

493
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:35,341
What have you got for us
Charlie?

494
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,274
- So exiting.
- Look,

495
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:37,540
I'm gonna do like this,

496
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:39,008
you just stick your finger in
anyway.

497
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:40,274
- you're ready?
- All the way in?

498
00:29:40,408 --> 00:29:41,640
Oh my God, look at that!

499
00:29:41,775 --> 00:29:42,841
Now here's what imma do,

500
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:45,042
you can look at the card
show everybody else,

501
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:47,574
don't show me, you're ready?

502
00:29:47,707 --> 00:29:49,607
Tell me, did everybody see it?

503
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,207
- Yes.
- All right, here it is.

504
00:29:51,341 --> 00:29:52,607
Just stick the tip of it in.

505
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,942
- [indistinct].
- Sticking all the way in,

506
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:56,707
and watch this [indistinct],

507
00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:57,707
You're ready?

508
00:29:57,841 --> 00:29:59,008
I got a magic rubber band,

509
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:00,241
you're not gonna believe this,
right?

510
00:30:00,374 --> 00:30:01,440
- Okay.
- All right, here it goes.

511
00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:02,841
- You're ready?
- Okay.

512
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:05,107
All right, was that your card?

513
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:06,141
Tell the truth.

514
00:30:06,274 --> 00:30:07,574
- No.
- Watch this.

515
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:10,008
One, two, three, oh my
God look at that shit.

516
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,674
[laughs]

517
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:16,341
What [indistinct], that's
crazy.

518
00:30:17,841 --> 00:30:19,407
How did you do that?

519
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,341
- It's magic.
- I told you he legit bro.

520
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:26,042
- Enjoy the night.
- That's crazy,

521
00:30:26,174 --> 00:30:28,341
do you think he [indistinct]?

522
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:30,440
No, it's a shit tone of
practice though.

523
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:34,341
- Pretty cool though.
- Yeah, I'm starving.

524
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:38,640
No kidding, Ben, you can cut
it.

525
00:30:38,775 --> 00:30:40,241
[Ben] Cutting.

526
00:30:50,574 --> 00:30:53,407
Hey guys, dinner will be right
out.

527
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,107
In the meantime though, it's
Sake time.

528
00:30:57,975 --> 00:30:59,107
Who wants some Sake?

529
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:02,107
- Oh, I do.
- Good, anybody else?

530
00:31:03,174 --> 00:31:04,640
I'll pass on that.

531
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:06,207
All right, let's go.

532
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,141
- You have to-
- I hate sake.

533
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:10,607
You go first, when I say
ready,

534
00:31:10,741 --> 00:31:13,574
chug 'em down as much as you
can, okay?

535
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,107
- Okay.
- Ready?

536
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:20,407
[All] Chug, chug, chug, chug,

537
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,340
chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!

538
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:28,507
[Jin] Very good, excellent,
who wants to go next?

539
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,141
Birthday girl.

540
00:31:30,274 --> 00:31:32,440
[Jin] Let's go birthday girl.

541
00:31:32,574 --> 00:31:33,640
- I did it.
- Fine!

542
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:34,640
Okay?

543
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:36,708

544
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,174

00:31:41,307 --> 00:31:45,042
- Keep going!
- Chug, chug, chug, chug!

546
00:31:45,174 --> 00:31:47,675
[Jin] Great job, excellent.

547
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,141
I need to wash that down
[indistinct].

548
00:31:52,274 --> 00:31:54,074
You did great babe.

549
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:55,975
- Your turn Brian.
- Oh no,

550
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:58,241
that shit makes me vomit.

551
00:31:58,373 --> 00:31:59,875
Come on bro, don't be a pussy.

552
00:32:00,008 --> 00:32:01,741
- [indistinct].
- Just a little,

553
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,741
it's a Japanese tradition.

554
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:07,074
Fuck, all right, fine, let's
go.

555
00:32:08,307 --> 00:32:09,473
For Katie on her birthday.

556
00:32:09,607 --> 00:32:11,507
- Thank you.
- Ready?

557
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:16,741
[All] Chug, chug, chug, chug!

558
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:19,207
[Katie] What the fuck was
that?

559
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,775
That was horrible,
the girls were better.

560
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:25,107
Okay, I said I fucking hate
that shit.

561
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:27,141
- Pussy!
- All right,

562
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,741
your turn tough guy.

563
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:33,407
Nope, I hate that shit too.

564
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,741
Wait, hold on a second,
so I said I hate it,

565
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:41,373
yet I still did it, they both
did it,

566
00:32:41,507 --> 00:32:43,741
and now you're not gonna?

567
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:49,507
If you guys need anything at
all, just let me know, okay?

568
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:52,174
- Okay, thank you.
- Well, yeah dude,

569
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:57,473
I'm just smart enough
not to ask [indistinct].

570
00:32:57,908 --> 00:32:59,340
Can you believe this shit?

571
00:32:59,473 --> 00:33:02,240
- Relax babe.
- Nah, fuck this!

572
00:33:03,373 --> 00:33:04,708
[table banging]

573
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:08,240
Yo, chill the fuck
out, dude, you are drunk.

574
00:33:08,373 --> 00:33:10,373
No, seriously, fuck you.

575
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:12,008
How are you gonna to sit there,

576
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:14,307
make us chug that nasty ass
shit,

577
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,407
call me a pussy and now
you're not gonna do it?

578
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,841
Bro, calm the fuck down, do
not make a scene where I work!

579
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:24,675
[indistinct].

580
00:33:25,608 --> 00:33:30,440
You'll get what's coming to
ya, keep talking that shit.

581
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:35,340
Happy birthday, Katie,
now move, Meg we're going.

582
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:36,942
No, you know what?

583
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:39,473
Come to the back with me,
let's go we need to talk.

584
00:33:39,608 --> 00:33:41,107
- About what?
- About you ruin

585
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,407
my girl birthday dinner,
and being a drunk dick.

586
00:33:46,273 --> 00:33:49,340
Ben you can cut the
camera, let's go Brian!

587
00:33:49,473 --> 00:33:51,775
Settle down babe, we
are just having fun.

588
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:53,141
Shut up,

589
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:56,141
- don't tell me what to do!
- Now, Brian!

590
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:05,641
I can't believe he flipped
like that.

591
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:07,008
Where did he go?

592
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:09,908
I told you, babe, I got a ride
for him.

593
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:13,975
I was trying to calm him
down, but he was still raging.

594
00:34:14,107 --> 00:34:15,708
He does that a lot lately,

595
00:34:15,841 --> 00:34:17,875
it's all the steroids he's been
taking.

596
00:34:18,008 --> 00:34:22,240
- [indistinct].
- Absolutely.

597
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:25,875
Sometimes he even threatens me
at home.

598
00:34:26,008 --> 00:34:28,373
- He gets scary.
- I'm scared.

599
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,173
Nothing to be scared of,

600
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:35,608
I would have fucked him
up if he went any further.

601
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:54,641
I gotta go to the bathroom so
bad.

602
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,708
[Reo] Relax, Kate, you're
drunk as hell.

603
00:35:00,841 --> 00:35:05,541
Relax, you're the one
[indistinct].

604
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,373
[Brian screaming]

605
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:22,140
[Reo] Where are you Jin?

606
00:35:22,273 --> 00:35:24,641
[Jin] We got a room here.

607
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:29,373
[Brian] Let me out, please!

608
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,541
No, don't fucking do that.

609
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:41,775
He's very good, huh?

610
00:35:41,908 --> 00:35:44,340
Nice and fit, like the meat.

611
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,307
That is why I invited him,

612
00:35:47,441 --> 00:35:49,775
sometimes I know what I'm doing.

613
00:35:49,908 --> 00:35:52,508
You did a very good job Reo.

614
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,140
You okay?

615
00:35:56,273 --> 00:35:58,775
You guys have the good stuff,
huh?

616
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,841
[muffled groaning]

617
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:06,240
Sorry Brian, it's just
business.

618
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,841
They'll be here soon,

619
00:36:09,975 --> 00:36:11,775
we need to start getting him
prepared.

620
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:13,875
We gotta get the others as well.

621
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:15,408
They'll be eating in the
kitchen,

622
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,307
I have a table set up for them.

623
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,408
[muffled screaming]

624
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:22,675
I'll take care of that
when I get back upstairs.

625
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:23,675
Perfect.

626
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:39,140
All right, go ahead and go
upstairs,

627
00:36:39,273 --> 00:36:41,908
and get the table set up.

628
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:45,007
[indistinct]

629
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,307

[machine whirling]

631
00:37:01,307 --> 00:37:03,408
[Reo] Katie, wake up.

632
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,408
I am so drunk, but yay,
happy birthday to me.

633
00:37:35,974 --> 00:37:39,941
[Reo] She has had the
best day of her life.

634
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,808
- All thanks to you.
- That's right.

635
00:37:48,273 --> 00:37:51,508
Happy birthday, Katie, there
we go.

636
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:59,308
[Katie] Thank you,
[indistinct].

637

Now it's time to enjoy your
cake.

[Ben] Look at the camera
Katie, happy birthday.

646
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:51,807
I need to go, I'm not feeling
so well.

647
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:59,675
We aren't ready to leave just
yet,

648
00:40:00,807 --> 00:40:04,341
'cause there's some more wine to
drink.

I've had enough, I
cant even see straight.

Katie, are you okay?

651
00:40:23,907 --> 00:40:27,073
Reo I think maybe you
need to take her home.

652
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:30,106
She had like three bottles of
wine.

653
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:32,207
Come on don't be a party
pooper,

654

What is that?

[Meghan crying]
[door banging]

659
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:06,541
Drink much tonight,
you won't feel anything.

660
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:10,141

00:41:53,207 --> 00:41:54,308
Ooh my God!

[indistinct]

664
00:42:09,174 --> 00:42:12,074
[ominous music]

665
00:42:14,274 --> 00:42:16,207
Please somebody help!

666
00:43:01,774 --> 00:43:03,941
[Katie screaming]

667
00:43:04,074 --> 00:43:05,308
No, no, no!

668
00:43:21,441 --> 00:43:25,241
- She won't feel a thing.
- Good, better that way.

669
00:43:25,374 --> 00:43:29,274
That is why I wanted
you to get her drunk.

670
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,541
[Reo] I told them there's
a lot of money in this.

671
00:43:33,674 --> 00:43:38,042
There is, these guys pay
very good money for each bag.

672
00:43:38,174 --> 00:43:39,640
Tonight they're only paying for
two,

673
00:43:39,774 --> 00:43:44,574
so it's going to be this,
birthday girl and this guy.

674
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:47,074
Tell Ben how much they pay?

675
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,374
- 50,000.
- You can do the math, Ben.

676
00:43:52,874 --> 00:43:56,707
Most importantly though, this
video we're making tonight,

677
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,840
will be sold for tons of money
over in Asia, these are huge.

678
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:06,241
My cousin in Japan told me
video with real life killings

679
00:44:06,374 --> 00:44:09,474
are big in black market over
there.

680
00:44:11,341 --> 00:44:14,574
What about our faces being on
camera?

681
00:44:14,707 --> 00:44:19,274
We blur our faces out,
Reo, you think I'm stupid?

682
00:44:21,674 --> 00:44:24,740
[Reo] I didn't even think
about that?

683
00:44:24,874 --> 00:44:27,674
This is going to be it for me
though,

684
00:44:27,807 --> 00:44:31,942
I'm shutting down the
restaurant after this.

685
00:44:32,074 --> 00:44:34,474
And I'm going to take the money,

686
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:38,607
heading back to Japan and
start real businesses.

687
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:42,875
I never wanted to do
this, but the restaurant

688
00:44:43,008 --> 00:44:46,740
wasn't making the money
I expected to make.

689
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:52,174
[indistinct] my ass,
[indistinct].

690
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:55,074
These men that are coming
tonight,

691
00:44:55,207 --> 00:44:57,574
share a common friend with me,

692
00:44:57,707 --> 00:45:01,408
and this was proposed, I
couldn't say no.

693
00:45:08,074 --> 00:45:10,640
Plus I love the fucking money.

694
00:45:12,107 --> 00:45:17,308
After I get rid of these three,
I'm heading back to Japan.

695
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:23,408
I'm happy for you Jin,
I'm glad I could help you.

696
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,875
I'll take care of you
guys tonight as well.

697
00:45:26,008 --> 00:45:28,908
Come on, let's get everything's
ready for these guys,

698
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:30,674
they're on the way.

699
00:45:33,607 --> 00:45:36,141
That will keep her out
totally?

700
00:45:36,274 --> 00:45:37,707
Yeah, it will.

701
00:45:45,841 --> 00:45:48,707
Take that gag off her
mouth she's chocking!

702
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:52,241
- [Meghan puking]
- Shit!

703
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:55,674
Why are you doing this?

704
00:45:55,808 --> 00:45:59,274
- You are sick.
- Why are you doing this?

705
00:46:01,841 --> 00:46:06,774
Because you are worth a lot
of fucking money, that's why.

706
00:46:08,507 --> 00:46:12,740
[indistinct], help me, help
me!

707
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:16,507
[Jin] Take her down
basement and tie her up.

708
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,374
[Meghan crying]

709
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,574
Hurry up Reo, come on!

710
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,808
I'm trying.

711
00:46:43,241 --> 00:46:45,942
Oh shit!
[Reo groaning]

712
00:46:46,074 --> 00:46:48,107
[Jin] You all right?

713
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,740
Fuck, get up, Reo come on
go get her man, come on!

714
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:57,141
Come on, man!

715
00:47:04,308 --> 00:47:07,274
[Reo] Where the fuck are you
Meghan?

716
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,107
[indistinct]

717
00:47:14,942 --> 00:47:18,308
[Jin] She is here somewhere I
know.

718
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:22,141
[ominous music]

719
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,373
That bitch is in the dumpster!

720
00:47:28,507 --> 00:47:33,674
[indistinct]
[Meghan screaming]

721
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:46,440
[Meghan] No, no, help me!

722
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:07,708
Please, no!

723
00:48:14,174 --> 00:48:16,741
- Are you okay?
- My poor baby,

724
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:20,607
oh, this is horrifying.

725
00:48:20,741 --> 00:48:22,741
Why don't I just take the DVD
out?

726
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:25,141
We'll just call it a day.

727
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:29,775
No, I came here to watch this,

728
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:35,042
and goddammit I'm going
to see the whole thing.

729
00:48:35,174 --> 00:48:36,540
Are you sure?

730
00:48:37,741 --> 00:48:40,174
- It gets worse.
- I'm sure.

731
00:48:49,908 --> 00:48:50,775
Okay.

732
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:56,775
[Meghan] Somebody
help me, help, help me!

733
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:01,273
Oh nice, very, very nice.

734
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:05,741
[Meghan crying]

735
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:07,741
See this, you're next!

736
00:49:10,008 --> 00:49:12,574
Oh, by the way, this is Brian.

737
00:49:14,473 --> 00:49:16,440
Shut her the fuck up!

738
00:49:16,574 --> 00:49:21,741
[Meghan crying]
[ominous music]

739
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,608
I love my work.

740
00:51:28,775 --> 00:51:30,541
Jin said thank you.

741
00:51:31,474 --> 00:51:35,173
Tell Jin I said thanks, I love
my work.

742
00:51:59,808 --> 00:52:02,541
[ominous music]

743
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:11,307
[Jin] See Reo, when you
say sushi, you become sushi.

744
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:20,508
Make sure you record all of
this.

745
00:53:22,007 --> 00:53:26,240
Stuff like this is what
those people wanna see.

746
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:33,307
[Reo] Here they are
Ben, that is their meat.

747
00:53:34,675 --> 00:53:38,206
[Jin] And from what I
heard, that meat is delicious.

748
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:40,508
[Reo] I wouldn't know.

749
00:53:49,974 --> 00:53:52,341
Do you drink the blood too?

750
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:57,374
[Jin] Take the lid off that
bowl Reo.

751
00:53:59,441 --> 00:54:02,575
- Oh, fuck!
- Everything is prepared,

752
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:04,908
there is a stuff in that fridge

753
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,908
that they wanna save for later.

754
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:09,140
- Can I see?
- Go ahead.

755
00:54:13,308 --> 00:54:15,206
Holy fucking shit!

756
00:54:16,106 --> 00:54:17,508
Some craziest shit,

757
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:20,675
- isn't it?
- This is a fucking joke.

758
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:27,741
He's not okay with us filming
it?

759
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:30,441
We all have companies,

760
00:54:30,575 --> 00:54:33,441
behind all this filming stuff as
well.

761
00:54:33,575 --> 00:54:35,974
We are splitting the money.

762
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:40,374
If it wasn't for him
there is nothing to film.

763
00:54:40,508 --> 00:54:42,408
Perfect operation.

764
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:45,875
He wants to see the final
product before we sell it.

765
00:54:46,007 --> 00:54:49,441
We have to make sure
everyone is dulled out.

766
00:54:49,575 --> 00:54:53,206
Of course.
[loud knocking]

767
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:54,641
That's them.

768
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,608
[ominous music]

769
00:55:50,874 --> 00:55:53,541
[pan sizzling]

770
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:01,641
[men laughing]

771
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,041
Hey, everything is locked
down, right?

772
00:57:53,174 --> 00:57:55,608
- All secure.
- Excellent, thank you,

773
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,575
you did an amazing job preparing
this.

774
00:57:57,708 --> 00:57:59,608
I have been craving
some good meat all week.

775
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,308
Well, you're eating the
best, you're eating the best,

776
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:04,840
and I heard that girl was so
beautiful.

777
00:58:04,974 --> 00:58:09,508
- Yeah, what about the guy?
- He's a meat head [laughs].

778
00:58:09,641 --> 00:58:12,575
Guess what, the thicker, the
tastier,

779
00:58:12,707 --> 00:58:14,541
and the better it is for our
belly.

780
00:58:14,675 --> 00:58:15,974
[all laughing]

781
00:58:16,107 --> 00:58:21,141
Hey, I can't wait to eat
some real fingers, and toes!

782
00:58:21,274 --> 00:58:23,107
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:58:25,575 --> 00:58:28,474
That looks delicious, thank you.

784
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:32,174
Thank you, thank you.

785
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:35,408
Oh men, a toast to my
colleagues,

786
00:58:39,675 --> 00:58:42,575
to my friends, to a great feast.

787
00:58:48,707 --> 00:58:51,441
[ominous music]

788
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:06,674
[meat sizzling]

789
01:01:10,508 --> 01:01:13,607
- It's delicious.
- Sir, and the taste

790
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,074
is so awesome.

791
01:01:21,107 --> 01:01:23,774
Hey, he's gotta get a finger,

792
01:01:23,908 --> 01:01:25,174
he's gonna throw it in the air

793
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:27,374
and you gotta catch it in your
mouth.

794
01:01:27,508 --> 01:01:30,141
- All right, let's go.
- That's a good challenge.

795
01:01:30,274 --> 01:01:34,374
[Doug] Give me one of
those shuffling things.

796
01:01:36,141 --> 01:01:38,241
[Chef] Are you ready?

797
01:01:39,341 --> 01:01:42,174
[men groaning]

798
01:01:48,908 --> 01:01:53,474
- You gotta do it again.
- You gotta do it again.

799
01:01:53,607 --> 01:01:56,841
- Come on Doug.
- Hey, cheer, come on!

800
01:01:58,807 --> 01:02:01,875
No, I'm not gonna

801
01:02:02,008 --> 01:02:06,341
Yeah me, you watch a
pro, first time, come on.

802
01:02:09,008 --> 01:02:11,640
[all applauds]

803
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:23,408
Just put mine on a plate,
please, thank your sir.

804
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,640
- Thank you.
- And same for me.

805
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,774
No, come on!

806
01:02:34,975 --> 01:02:35,942
Boss we are

807
01:02:36,074 --> 01:02:37,308
- all not built like you.
- Well,

808
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,908
you know you gotta learn

809
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:40,707
- this stuff the right way.
- That's why he's the boss.

810
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:43,574
Here you go gentlemen, as
requested.

811
01:02:43,707 --> 01:02:47,274
Here's a picture of who you are
eating.

812
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,473
The lady was absolutely
beautiful.

813
01:02:52,607 --> 01:02:54,473
She was in a nice red dress,

814
01:02:54,607 --> 01:02:58,507
she had her high heels
on and make ups done.

815
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:02,174
Is not that a sin when a lady

816
01:03:03,341 --> 01:03:07,207
is sacrificed for our
dinner, on her birthday?

817
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:12,107
Like you give a shit!
[all laughing]

818
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,808
And this guy was real asshole
tonight,

819
01:03:17,942 --> 01:03:22,274
tried to starting a
fight in my restaurant.

820
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:24,473
- Enjoy yourselves.
- We will.

821
01:03:24,607 --> 01:03:26,241
Thank you for showing us the
pictures,

822
01:03:26,374 --> 01:03:29,374
I like to see what I'm eating.

823
01:03:29,507 --> 01:03:30,908
I bet that she had the best
time

824
01:03:31,042 --> 01:03:33,407
of her life before she was
killed.

825
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,775
Good for her, you know?

826
01:03:38,008 --> 01:03:42,473
Hey, Jin can I fire up
some meat for my friends?

827
01:03:43,707 --> 01:03:45,975
- [Jin] Yes, totally fine.
- Thank you.

828
01:03:46,107 --> 01:03:47,174
That's nice of you boss.

829
01:03:47,308 --> 01:03:51,207
[all clapping]
You go boss!

830
01:03:51,341 --> 01:03:53,908
[Jin] John's going to
do the final cooking.

831
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:55,674
[John] Thank you.

832
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:03,607
[meat sizzling]

833
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:25,074
[Phil] Hey boss, how
does that shit taste like?

834
01:04:27,107 --> 01:04:31,074
Like honey.
[Phil laughing]

835
01:04:33,407 --> 01:04:36,473
Hey Jin, do you have more
drinks?

836
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,841
[Jin] We do, which one?

837
01:04:39,574 --> 01:04:42,808
More blood and then bring the
piss.

838
01:04:56,074 --> 01:04:58,708
[indistinct]

839
01:05:03,908 --> 01:05:08,107
Hey, Jin, can you turn
the lights on for us?

840
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,875
Simply delicious.

841
01:05:23,008 --> 01:05:26,775
I was waiting for this the
whole month.

842
01:05:26,908 --> 01:05:29,641
[John belching]

843
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:34,540
Hey cameraman, are you getting
this?

844
01:05:35,841 --> 01:05:39,074
- Yes, sir.
- You're all charged up?

845
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,174
- Yes, sir.
- You wanna get this.

846
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,841
I wanna show you something,
give me something to drink.

847
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:49,074
- Red or yellow?
- Red.

848
01:05:49,207 --> 01:05:50,841
I'll take yellow.

849
01:05:59,174 --> 01:06:02,141
[all applauding]

850
01:06:04,207 --> 01:06:05,641
Oh, thank you.

851
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:18,407
- Nice boss, looking good.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

852
01:06:23,407 --> 01:06:27,107
- How's it taste?
- Oh, fucking beautiful.

853
01:06:28,575 --> 01:06:30,575
Give me that yellow, let's do
it.

854
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:33,808
- Okay.
- I hope it's fucking salty.

855
01:06:40,008 --> 01:06:42,775
[all applauding]

856
01:06:44,608 --> 01:06:48,273
So he probably [indistinct]
golden showers too.

857
01:06:48,407 --> 01:06:51,174
[Phil] That's why I like it.

858
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,775
Give me that red, I want all
that red.

859
01:06:58,908 --> 01:07:01,107
Give him the red chef.

860
01:07:03,473 --> 01:07:08,608
[All] Drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink drink!

861
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:11,541
[all applauding]

862
01:07:18,141 --> 01:07:21,240
[Phil] It's like an energy
drink.

863
01:07:35,074 --> 01:07:36,074
How are you feeling Doug?

864
01:07:36,206 --> 01:07:37,508
Great, good.

865
01:07:40,107 --> 01:07:41,407
No, thank you.

866
01:07:42,741 --> 01:07:45,140
What do you mean, you don't
like this?

867
01:07:45,273 --> 01:07:48,074
- It's your turn buddy.
- I can't get all messy,

868
01:07:48,206 --> 01:07:50,008
my wife will be waiting up for
me,

869
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,273
[indistinct] a change of
clothes.

870
01:07:52,407 --> 01:07:54,074
Oh, Jesus Christ!

871
01:07:55,008 --> 01:07:59,473
Unheard of man, don't you
know what this is about?

872
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,975
All right, it's time for
dessert yet?

873
01:08:04,107 --> 01:08:06,407
Well, you may call it dessert,

874
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:09,307
but I call it the main entree.

875
01:08:11,106 --> 01:08:15,340
- Hey, [indistinct], penis?
- I do.

876
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:22,042
Good, [indistinct], cut it
up, [indistinct] in pieces.

877
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:25,440
Hopefully it's at least four
inches.

878
01:08:26,206 --> 01:08:27,340
[Indistinct] steroids,

879
01:08:27,474 --> 01:08:31,708
that's pushing it.
[all laughing]

880
01:08:41,206 --> 01:08:45,441
Gentlemen, we're going
to read July's salesman.

881
01:08:51,008 --> 01:08:56,206
There are two testicles going
to the top two salesman.

882
01:08:56,407 --> 01:08:57,975
One of you is not.

883
01:08:58,808 --> 01:09:02,206
I guess I'm not getting a ball
tonight.

884
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,474
You know, you guys are
the top three salesmen

885
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:09,575
in my company, so don't feel
bad if you [indistinct].

886
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:14,541
Okay, so with a million
dollars in gross sales in July,

887
01:09:18,008 --> 01:09:21,841
Phil Maxwell!
[all applauding]

888
01:09:24,373 --> 01:09:25,808
That's a really good number.

889
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:30,373
Not good enough to get a
ball, but I'll get there.

890
01:09:30,508 --> 01:09:35,340
Okay, 1.5 million in sales,
my shield, Bobby Shields.

891
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:44,106
[all applauding]
Congratulations.

892
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,441
And, well, I should've known
this,

893
01:09:50,575 --> 01:09:54,474
because, you know, it's
been like 10 months running,

894
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:57,041
number one, Doug Patrick.

895
01:09:57,173 --> 01:09:59,942
[all applauding]

896
01:10:00,073 --> 01:10:02,508
- Thank you.
- Good job Doug,

897
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:07,106
- you are the dog.
- I am.

898
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:15,341
[indistinct], flour, salt and
pepper?

899
01:10:15,474 --> 01:10:18,173
- Mm-hmm, yes.
- Look at that?

900
01:10:23,073 --> 01:10:25,441
No, no, here you go, sir.

901
01:10:26,441 --> 01:10:30,273
Watch, it's slippery,
you gonna grab at it.

902
01:10:32,374 --> 01:10:34,808
Enjoy this guys, enjoy this.

903
01:10:39,408 --> 01:10:41,441
How does that taste?

904
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:47,741
Absolutely [indistinct].

905
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:49,140
Is it good?

906
01:10:52,974 --> 01:10:55,273
So crispy, you savor it.

907
01:11:00,608 --> 01:11:03,875
Keep your numbers up, and
next month [indistinct].

908
01:11:04,007 --> 01:11:07,240
I know I will, I will,
just look at these guys,

909
01:11:07,374 --> 01:11:09,240
I'm hungry already.

910
01:11:09,374 --> 01:11:12,675
Are you guys done with the
meat?

911
01:11:12,808 --> 01:11:16,173
Yeah, we're good, can you wrap
it up?

912
01:11:16,908 --> 01:11:19,908
What about those intestines
that are in the fridge?

913
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:22,007
Why weren't they served?

914
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:24,308
I must have forgotten.

915
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:27,474
Yeah, wrap them up too, all
right?

916
01:11:27,608 --> 01:11:30,474
And I gotta pay you, right?

917
01:11:30,608 --> 01:11:31,474
No less.

918
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:38,374
And now, for the
grand finale, the penis.

919
01:11:45,274 --> 01:11:48,575
Hey, boss, it doesn't make a
man gay

920
01:11:49,974 --> 01:11:52,608
when he eats another man penis?

921
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:55,875
No Phil, it doesn't make a guy
gay,

922
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:57,173
eating another mans dick.

923
01:11:57,308 --> 01:12:00,474
That's why they call me gay,
no?

924
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:03,907
And even if it does,
what's wrong with being gay?

925
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:06,508
Hey look, I'm not paying
you to be fucking in charge-

926
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:09,274
- [indistinct], I'm just joking
boss.

927
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:10,974
I don't wanna fucking hear it,

928
01:12:11,106 --> 01:12:13,408
I will not tolerate hate
language-

929
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:15,140
- [indistinct], again?

930
01:12:15,274 --> 01:12:16,641
That dick is so good.

931
01:12:16,775 --> 01:12:18,741
[Phil] I'm joking boss,
don't get mad, you know?

932
01:12:18,874 --> 01:12:21,274
After a decent size too.

933
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:28,140
Oh, look at that,
it's just moving around.

934
01:12:34,073 --> 01:12:37,073
- There he goes.
- Phil's getting

935
01:12:37,207 --> 01:12:38,675
- a little piece-
- Why just because

936
01:12:38,808 --> 01:12:40,874
I made only a million dollar
tonight?

937
01:12:41,007 --> 01:12:44,308
Yeah, [indistinct].

938
01:12:44,441 --> 01:12:46,041
Who gets the head?

939
01:12:46,808 --> 01:12:48,508
[Phil] You should get the head
boss.

940
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:50,441
No, I'm gonna give it to Bob.

941
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:53,608
Ill take it, I'll take the
head.

942
01:12:55,207 --> 01:12:57,708
There you go, top salesman.

943
01:13:00,608 --> 01:13:05,775
You guys are [indistinct],
God forbid we're fucking gay.

944
01:13:06,408 --> 01:13:09,207
[all laughing]

945
01:13:11,974 --> 01:13:14,675
All right, enjoy this gentlemen.

946
01:13:21,741 --> 01:13:24,641
- So juicy.
- That was delicious.

947
01:13:33,174 --> 01:13:35,541
[Phil] Good job dickhead.

948
01:13:58,041 --> 01:13:59,106
Juicy, huh?

949
01:13:59,874 --> 01:14:03,374
I wonder how many vaginas it
was in?

950
01:14:03,508 --> 01:14:06,608
You are a sick fucking fuck.

951
01:14:06,741 --> 01:14:10,774
Hey, Doug you really wanna
know how many STDs it had?

952
01:14:10,907 --> 01:14:15,007
- Now that you say it.
- All right guys, shut up.

953
01:14:15,141 --> 01:14:18,575
Stop talking, you guys ruined my
moment.

954
01:14:23,207 --> 01:14:26,207
[Phil] Oh my God Doug, really?

955
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:28,474
You're like a little kid.

956
01:14:28,608 --> 01:14:33,241
- You are fucked up man.
- Stop playing with your food.

957
01:14:34,675 --> 01:14:37,508
Expensive taste that you got
John.

958
01:14:37,641 --> 01:14:39,141
I kind of wish I didn't at
times,

959
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:44,408
but, if you ask these guys,
the craving is just too strong.

960
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:48,107
Thanks boss, thank you.

961
01:14:49,241 --> 01:14:54,575
Yeah, [indistinct], that's
like air, you have to live.

962
01:15:02,441 --> 01:15:06,074
Are you getting some good
footage there?

963
01:15:08,174 --> 01:15:10,508
Hope you're a better editor?

964
01:15:10,641 --> 01:15:12,308
[Reo] Ben is pretty good, sir.

965
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:14,207
He is an amateur filmmaker,

966
01:15:14,341 --> 01:15:16,675
that is why I brought him
tonight.

967
01:15:16,807 --> 01:15:19,608
Excellent, can't wait
to see the final product.

968
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:22,341
And Jin, you've got to take
care of these guys now, right?

969
01:15:22,474 --> 01:15:25,274
I already told them I am.

970
01:15:25,408 --> 01:15:27,508
Money is a very powerful tool,
isn't it?

971
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:31,774
It sure is, especially
if you don't have any.

972
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:33,707
Well, I got plenty.

973
01:15:34,608 --> 01:15:36,774
Go in the back and take out
30,000,

974
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:40,274
it's yours, you did a phenomenal
job.

975
01:15:43,408 --> 01:15:46,074
- Thank you, Jin.
- No, thank you.

976
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:50,840
She was very easy target and
her friends became casualties.

977
01:15:50,974 --> 01:15:52,541
[indistinct] all right?

978
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:55,508
- [door banging]
- Police!

979
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,308
Everybody up, get your fucking
hands up,

980
01:15:57,441 --> 01:15:59,441
- hands up, hands up!
- I thought you guys locked

981
01:15:59,575 --> 01:16:01,274
the fucking door, man!

982
01:16:02,107 --> 01:16:04,408
You gotta be kidding me!

983
01:16:06,241 --> 01:16:09,807
[Police] What the fuck is
going on here?

984
01:16:25,141 --> 01:16:26,374
Sick fucks!

985
01:16:34,607 --> 01:16:39,508
You're so right, what kind
of sick fucks do this shit?

986
01:16:40,707 --> 01:16:44,074
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

987
01:16:45,274 --> 01:16:48,707
[indistinct] fuck!

988
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,474
You know I forgot
[indistinct].

989
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:55,341
I can still believe in John.

990
01:16:55,474 --> 01:16:59,942
It's all right guys,
hands down, he is one of us.

991
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:01,408
Holy shit!

992
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:05,541
- I thought we were fucked.
- No, we are not fucked.

993
01:17:05,674 --> 01:17:10,508
The only only one fucked here
is this little bitch Reo.

994
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:20,207
Not bad, how's that Doug?

995
01:17:20,341 --> 01:17:22,341
Hey, good sir, how are you
doing?

996
01:17:22,474 --> 01:17:27,640
[indistinct] save me some?
[ominous music]

997
01:17:30,975 --> 01:17:32,740
[Jin] Hello, welcome to my
restaurant.

998
01:17:32,874 --> 01:17:36,374
- Hi, thank you.
- Are you dining alone?

999
01:17:36,508 --> 01:17:38,107
No, my boyfriend is in the
bathroom.

1000
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:39,740
[Jin] Oh, okay.

1001
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,374
Thank you.

1002
01:17:42,508 --> 01:17:44,042
[Jin] You don't mind if I
take a picture of you, do you?

1003
01:17:44,174 --> 01:17:45,441
I like to hang them in my
restaurant

1004
01:17:45,574 --> 01:17:48,374
- for very special guests.
- Sure.

1005
01:17:49,107 --> 01:17:51,207
[Jin] So, on three say, sushi.

1006
01:17:51,341 --> 01:17:53,508
- One, two, three.
- Sushi!

1007
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,674
Oh, wait here he comes,
you wanna wait for him?

1008
01:17:56,807 --> 01:17:59,540
[Jin] Sure, you want to
get in the picture too?

1009
01:17:59,674 --> 01:18:01,908
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay guys,

1010
01:18:02,042 --> 01:18:03,740
on three, say sushi.

1011
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:05,707
One, two, three,

1012
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,308
- Sushi!
- Sushi!

1013
01:18:39,707 --> 01:18:42,507
[girl screaming]

1014
01:18:46,107 --> 01:18:50,574
That's gotta drain like
that for 10, 15 minutes.

1015
01:18:53,674 --> 01:18:55,774
- Hello?
- Yeah, who is it?

1016
01:18:55,908 --> 01:18:59,942
Hi, I think I left my
phone in here earlier?

1017
01:19:00,707 --> 01:19:03,274
[Jin] [indistinct], I'm
sure the guys closed the door-

1018
01:19:03,408 --> 01:19:04,707
- We're freaking closed.

1019
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:06,574
- Yeah?
- Oh, my God!

1020
01:20:26,574 --> 01:20:31,274
[Jin] Hello guys, good to
see you, your dinner is served,

1021
01:20:31,407 --> 01:20:35,373
just how you like it
Jonathan, raw and fresh.

1022
01:20:36,308 --> 01:20:38,507
She was beautiful, enjoy.

1023
01:20:40,141 --> 01:20:41,440
I sure will.

1024
01:20:47,507 --> 01:20:50,141
Listen, I know it looks bad,

1025
01:20:54,674 --> 01:20:59,373
but one taste of this and
you will never be the same.

1026
01:21:03,141 --> 01:21:04,708
Okay, I'm ready.

1027
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,741
Welcome to the club.

1028
01:22:20,174 --> 01:22:24,675
- Yeah, [indistinct].
- I'll take it.

1029
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:30,373
You didn't think you can get
away with 30 grand, did you?

1030
01:22:30,507 --> 01:22:31,841
That's fucked up.

1031
01:22:31,975 --> 01:22:35,808
You didn't think I
could trust you, did you?

1032
01:22:36,641 --> 01:22:38,440
Are you guys ready for round
two?

1033
01:22:38,574 --> 01:22:41,407
Yes, boss, I'm fucking
starving!

1034
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:45,240
[John] All right, all right,
all right.

1035
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,507
- Hey babe?
- Hi.

1036
01:23:10,008 --> 01:23:12,074
[Brian] I hope you
guys are enjoying him?

1037
01:23:12,206 --> 01:23:14,307
Oh my God, it's so good.

1038
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,473
Delicious, I like it.

1039
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:20,507
Come on, I wanna get
one close up of this.

1040
01:23:31,107 --> 01:23:34,141
[blender revving]

1041
01:23:38,473 --> 01:23:42,440
- [indistinct]
- [All] Oh yeah.

1042
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,908
I haven't eaten meat in over a
year.

1043
01:23:52,042 --> 01:23:54,107
It's been two for me.

1044
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:57,273
I can't say it's been
ever that long for me.

1045
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:59,841
I don't know how you guys
do it, but I understand.

1046
01:23:59,975 --> 01:24:04,074
There's murder laws out
there, it's not easy.

1047
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:09,340
But with our new system, it's
going to be a lot easier.

1048
01:24:09,473 --> 01:24:11,841
Expensive, yes, but easier.

1049
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:17,240
Gentlemen, hey, sorry I'm
late,

1050
01:24:17,373 --> 01:24:19,140
but I could smell it all
the way down the block.

1051
01:24:19,273 --> 01:24:20,373
Don't worry about it.

1052
01:24:20,508 --> 01:24:23,107
- Hello gentlemen?
- Hey!

1053
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:24,508
Hi honey?

1054
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:26,407
How's my favorite daughter
doing?

1055
01:24:26,541 --> 01:24:29,708
- Great, thanks.
- Good, good to hear.

1056
01:24:29,841 --> 01:24:33,473
Hey guys, I brought
special pie for you guys.

1057
01:24:33,608 --> 01:24:36,641
- Ready for this?
- Okay, lets do it.

1058
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:41,708
It's perfect Jin,
[indistinct].

1059
01:24:41,841 --> 01:24:46,340
You know, I have the
best chefs in the world.

1060
01:24:46,474 --> 01:24:49,975
Skinned the face right off of
him.

1061
01:24:50,106 --> 01:24:51,508
Yeah, Jin, I sure am sorry

1062
01:24:51,641 --> 01:24:53,741
they shut that restaurant down,
man.

1063
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:55,373
No, don't be sorry.

1064
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:57,741
This is new [indistinct] thing
is gonna work even better.

1065
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:01,206
And this video is gonna
sell for tons of money too,

1066
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:03,541
it's a win-win. you know.

1067
01:25:03,675 --> 01:25:06,340
Oh, by the way, I have your
food coming down in a minute.

1068
01:25:06,474 --> 01:25:09,541
You know, I don't eat this
shit, it's all yours man.

1069
01:25:09,675 --> 01:25:10,675
Thank you.

1070
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:16,575
I wanna thank everyone
for coming this evening.

1071
01:25:20,273 --> 01:25:22,908
Go on Brian, go ahead.

1072
01:25:23,042 --> 01:25:24,875
It's just too much right now.

1073
01:25:25,008 --> 01:25:26,942
I wanna thank you guys
for coming, like I said,

1074
01:25:27,073 --> 01:25:29,841
and unfortunately my dad
is not here at the moment

1075
01:25:29,975 --> 01:25:33,307
because he's always runs
late, as you [indistinct],

1076
01:25:33,441 --> 01:25:35,541
but I want you guys to really
enjoy

1077
01:25:35,675 --> 01:25:38,675
this motherfucker, Reo,
immensely,

1078
01:25:38,808 --> 01:25:43,140
and indulge because he
was a real piece of shit.

1079
01:25:44,407 --> 01:25:48,273
He thought he was gonna get over
on me,

1080
01:25:48,408 --> 01:25:52,240
unfortunately it went
crashing down on him,

1081
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:55,942
right into that pie, actually.

1082
01:25:56,675 --> 01:26:01,441
I never liked him and I never
really cared for Meghan,

1083
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,273
she was just a piece of ass to
me.

1084
01:26:06,608 --> 01:26:10,508
But when I found out that he'd
fucked her,

1085
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:14,541
I knew where his fate was
[indistinct].

1086
01:26:14,675 --> 01:26:18,206
I'm so glad you introduced
me to your daughter, Jin.

1087
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,708
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1088
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:25,675
To my new family, my
new business partners

1089
01:26:25,808 --> 01:26:30,541
and our new little thing we
got going on here, cheers!

1090
01:26:32,608 --> 01:26:33,474
Salute!

1091
01:26:54,106 --> 01:26:56,608
Jin, yeah, what's up buddy?

1092
01:27:00,908 --> 01:27:03,575
Oh, yeah, you know, she's gone.

1093
01:27:05,675 --> 01:27:10,641
Gunshot to the head, I don't
know, I didn't see anything.

1094
01:27:13,675 --> 01:27:18,841
No, we've gotten rid of almost
everybody closely connected.

1095
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:21,307
Yeah, but hey, I'll tell you
what,

1096
01:27:21,441 --> 01:27:24,474
we've got some pristine new
footage

1097
01:27:24,608 --> 01:27:26,841
out of this film of ours.

1098
01:27:27,808 --> 01:27:30,808
I got two cameras going right
now.

1099
01:27:33,106 --> 01:27:35,741
Yeah, yes, so that's almost it.

1100
01:27:37,974 --> 01:27:40,341
Right, well, I'll bring her

1101
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:45,441
over to your place in about a
half hour.

1102
01:27:46,308 --> 01:27:49,106
No, I mean, I'm starving, yeah.

1103
01:27:51,608 --> 01:27:53,073
What do I think?

1104
01:27:57,741 --> 01:28:02,041
I think she'll do, man,
she's pretty tasty.

1105
01:28:02,173 --> 01:28:04,608
Yeah, no, I'll see you then.

1106
01:28:06,206 --> 01:28:08,575
All right, oh, Jin, I mean,

1107
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:13,508
make sure to blur our faces out,
right?

1108
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:18,274
All right, bye.

1109
01:28:46,374 --> 01:28:48,341
To protect and serve.

1110
01:28:52,575 --> 01:28:56,341
[gentle orchestral music]
