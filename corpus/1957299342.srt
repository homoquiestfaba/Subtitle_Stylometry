1
00:00:18,604 --> 00:00:21,883
Come on! Let's go! Hey, they're shootin' at us!
We gotta ride outta here!

2
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:29,408
Hyah! Come on! Move!

3
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:32,170
Chuy, you couldn't hit them
if they were standing still.

4
00:00:32,204 --> 00:00:34,034
Filthy miner.

5
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:39,970
Ha ha! Don't get up.

6
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:42,973
There's new boys blasting back
here. Let's go get Walt and Nate.

7
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,665
No. Let's go get his gold.

8
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:46,908
We can't go down there.
We'll be sitting ducks.

9
00:00:46,943 --> 00:00:49,532
Those boys will hunker down
and shoot us stone dead.

10
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:52,155
Now we ambush.
Now let's go.

11
00:01:26,465 --> 00:01:29,986
You boys finding any color
in these parts?

12
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,817
Little, I guess.

13
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:35,854
We ain't quite
really that sure.

14
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:40,824
I see a couple of nice pickers
on the front pan, though.

15
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,723
Is that a fact?

16
00:01:48,798 --> 00:01:50,248
Claim jumpers!

17
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:56,150
Dynamite!

18
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:13,167
Not much here, jefe.
Maybe half an ounce.

19
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:14,617
When are we gonna
split the color?

20
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:17,654
Later. Gather up
everything you can carry.

21
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,725
Walt, get down from there!

22
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:23,350
You want me
for something?

23
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:26,422
We don't do the digging.
We let them do the digging.

24
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:27,837
Just trying
to find more gold.

25
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:30,667
You ride with me,
you do as I say.

26
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:32,462
You two strip the bodies.

27
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:34,361
What for?
All the gold is in the box.

28
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:37,640
I'll do it. No. Let them
strip the bodies.

29
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,194
You get back
to camp now, boy.

30
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:43,024
I want it to look like
the desperate Mimbrenos did it.

31
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:31,434
Someone told me once

32
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,505
that death is not
the end of a life,

33
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,887
but a doorway.

34
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:38,545
It feels like the end.

35
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:41,133
I just turned 18
when the cholera took my mom

36
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:43,550
and baby sister Clara.

37
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:44,792
Ma was supposed
to get better,

38
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:48,417
but then she got
the cholera anyway.

39
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:51,489
Pa was hoping Parson Jenkins
could come to the funeral,

40
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:56,010
but he and the missus were
both down with the cholera, too.

41
00:05:56,045 --> 00:06:00,912
And Pa says we'd be burying
the Jenkins by next week.

42
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:04,950
I guess God don't cut no slack
for preachers, either.

43
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:23,417
I took to watching my brother
and two sisters as best I could.

44
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:26,144
The house sure is different
without Mama.

45
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,905
It seems empty
in many ways.

46
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,464
Sarah helps me with much
of the day-to-day stuff,

47
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,949
and for the most part
takes care of herself.

48
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:40,296
You can tell she wants
to be a grownup

49
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,849
and leave the kid stuff
behind,

50
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:46,406
but I keep telling her
to enjoy it while it lasts.

51
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,862
Katherine plays with Barker
or her dolls most of the time,

52
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:58,245
but she helps with
the chores if she can.

53
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:01,559
It's fun to watch
the two girls together

54
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:05,114
because they're
just so different.

55
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:09,325
And then there's Billy.
My, my.

56
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:13,260
Well, he likes rocks
and throwing rocks.

57
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:15,607
I don't know if it's just
a boy thing or what.

58
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:19,542
It's... It's real work
keeping him in line.

59
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:22,476
But he doesn't mind
getting dirty,

60
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:24,961
so I have him get
the water from the well

61
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:27,412
and gather wood for the fire,

62
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,277
and we get by and all.

63
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:34,764
But raising young'uns is
not a job for the weary.

64
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:46,880
We came to
the deserts of Arizona

65
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:51,678
because Pa heard of new gold
deposits that were being found.

66
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:54,612
So we hurried out
to the middle of nowhere.

67
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,099
All those crazy miners
would get up real early

68
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:00,756
and pan for gold.

69
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,068
They'd even have the women
out there in dresses

70
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:05,174
in the freezing snow melt
panning.

71
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,383
"Did you find any color?"

72
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:10,006
That's what they
call gold, "color."

73
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,008
Well, you're not gonna
find me out there

74
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:13,941
digging some random
holes in the desert.

75
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:17,842
I'd rather pluck chickens
and do laundry. I don't know.

76
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:20,223
Mama said I should
find me a man,

77
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:24,124
but I don't want some
dirty stinking miner.

78
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:30,199
Anyway, Pa,
he had the fever.

79
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:32,166
Gold fever.

80
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,837
Ma, I have some concerns,

81
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,839
but I don't want
to say anything

82
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:56,018
because I think people would
get upset at me for saying such.

83
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:59,366
I don't think the Lord
hears my prayers.

84
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,888
The Good Book says that the Lord is
a present help in the time of need,

85
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:09,238
but I don't see him
or hear him.

86
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:11,240
Not at all.

87
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:15,382
Just being honest.

88
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,832
I do miss you.

89
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:19,420
Mattie! Mattie!

90
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:21,250
Mattie!

91
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:22,734
Come help me with this pie!

92
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,324
I fear it'll burn if
we don't take it out soon.

93
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,153
Well, I gotta go
help Sarah.

94
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:31,467
I swear she's a worry wart
all the time, Ma.

95
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,262
I'll see you next Sunday.

96
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:34,332
Mattie!

97
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:38,957
I'm coming! I'm coming!

98
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:54,939
Oww! Oww!

99
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:56,803
Oww!

100
00:09:56,837 --> 00:09:58,632
Oww!

101
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:01,635
Pa! Pa!
Mattie strapped me, Pa!

102
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,533
She strapped me hard!

103
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:09,643
She gave you some pretty
good-sized welts there, boy.

104
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:10,851
What'd you do
to deserve that?

105
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:12,853
Nothing, Pa!
I didn't do nothing.

106
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:15,200
Mattie just hates me.
You ought to strap her, Pa.

107
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:17,340
She's the one who needs it.
Strap her hard.

108
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,860
You strapped him pretty good.
Did he have a need for it?

109
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:22,069
He left the henhouse
gates open.

110
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:25,590
We lost some of
our best layers. Well, that's not good, but...

111
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,905
That was after he flipped over your
concentrate bucket and used it for a drum.

112
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:34,564
And that was before he put the lizard down
my dress and down my undergarments, Pa.

113
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:37,809
And pulled Barker's tail
and pushed me down.

114
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:40,122
Is that right, son?

115
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:43,194
And you know, he hasn't done
his chores for the last two days.

116
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:44,920
And you know Ma's rule
about the chores.

117
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:48,268
I ain't never got
strapped, huh, Pa?

118
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,444
It appears to me
Billy has a point.

119
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,205
See? You'll get yours
now, Mattie.

120
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,896
I hope he gives you
some big old welts.

121
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:59,659
You know, Mattie, I shouldn't have
left you to do any of the correcting.

122
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,212
Hand me the strap.

123
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,836
No, Mattie, no! Don't let
him take me to the woodshed.

124
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:05,837
Please, Mattie!

125
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:07,459
And no more lizards!

126
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:10,877
And don't push me down!

127
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:13,017
Well, what do you think,
Mattie?

128
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:17,090
All right.
Get on after them hens.

129
00:11:17,124 --> 00:11:19,161
Come on, Barker,
help me find those chickens.

130
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,306
You weren't really gonna
strap him, were you?

131
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,825
Well, what do you think?

132
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:30,724
I think you're funny, Pa.

133
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,865
Oh, you do, do you?
Come here!

134
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:37,213
Ah, kids.

135
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:12,904
Old Parson Jenkins
should be proud of that, Jess.

136
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:16,321
Well, I reckon
when we get a new parson,

137
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:18,047
he'll make some
good use out of it, too.

138
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:22,949
Well, I'm sure he will, Jess.
I'm sure he will.

139
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:29,093
Billy!
Oh, I swear it, Billy,

140
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:32,648
you throw one more rock and that next
one's going straight at your head.

141
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:34,167
Now git!

142
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:57,155
Looks like you're doing a fine
job with them children, Mattie.

143
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,160
I think you're just a natural-born
to raise children, don't you?

144
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:13,896
I noticed your Pa is starting
to get some color back.

145
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:15,933
Yep.

146
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:18,349
Putting on some weight, too.

147
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:20,800
Uh-huh.

148
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:27,047
1-2-3, go!
Go, go, go!

149
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:28,946
Put on the bottom weight then.

150
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,086
Careful. Easy up now.

151
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,053
A little bit up
on that east end.

152
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:34,848
I got it.
I got it.

153
00:13:34,883 --> 00:13:36,608
Easy up, now. Are you okay, Jake?

154
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:38,265
Yeah.
My hand slipped.

155
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,267
You know better.

156
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:42,925
Sorry, Zeb.

157
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:59,839
Looks like it was a good idea
to invite Zeb and Jake today.

158
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,151
Yeah, it looks like.

159
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:08,675
How's that new claim
working, Zeb?

160
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,782
Things are looking up.

161
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:15,613
Just you and Jake up there
taking of everything?

162
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,788
Yeah, it's a lot of work,
all right.

163
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:22,033
Appears to me you might be
needing a wife and some young'uns

164
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:24,553
to help you
with all that work, Zeb.

165
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:28,074
You wouldn't mind Zeb
bringing home a wife sometime

166
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:29,592
to help you with all the
chores, would you, Jacob?

167
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:31,974
Nah, I guess not.

168
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,562
Jacob and I
will be all right.

169
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:35,840
Besides,
I ain't home much anyhow.

170
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,531
That's a fact.

171
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:40,017
Well, Jake, it's a big
country out there,

172
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:43,054
and a man's gotta take
a looksee once in a while.

173
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:54,859
Bobbi Jo,
you better settle down.

174
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,068
Oh, I haven't seen
a man like that.

175
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:04,869
Oh! Bobbi Jo!
Oh, Bobbi Jo!

176
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,802
Oh, you're heavy, Bobbi Jo.

177
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:42,527
Praise the man upstairs
before we eat.

178
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:47,463
Heavenly Father, we humbly
approach this table, Lord.

179
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:50,052
We ask for your blessing
on this meal, Lord.

180
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:53,331
We thank you for all your
grace and mercy in our life,

181
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:55,437
and we dedicate this church
to you, Father.

182
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:57,094
First in Christ's name
we pray. Amen.

183
00:15:57,128 --> 00:15:58,336
Amen!

184
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:01,788
Pretty good, huh? Good job.

185
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,479
Whoo!

186
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:04,998
Good day it was.

187
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:09,347
I think these beans
came out of Will's garden.

188
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:11,384
You want any green beans?

189
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:14,559
Hmm! Worked up
an appetite today, huh?

190
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:21,256
I noticed your pa has
picked his step up a bit.

191
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,087
Must be feeling a might
better these days. Yep.

192
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:29,471
Is that Zebediah Fulton sitting
over at the end of the table there?

193
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:30,782
Yup, it sure is.

194
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:32,957
Is he somebody special?

195
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,925
Could be, Sarah,
he could be.

196
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:42,242
Zebediah.

197
00:16:43,623 --> 00:16:49,525
♪♪

198
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,700
♪♪

199
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,595
Go get some cider, Jake.

200
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:27,011
Be staking me a claim.

201
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:29,945
Sure, Zeb.

202
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:10,848
I hear you like to dance.

203
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:14,127
Sometimes.
With someone I know.

204
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:17,096
Name's Zebediah.

205
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:22,411
Zebediah Fulton, but all
my friends call me Zeb.

206
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:25,932
And how many friends do
you have, Zebediah Fulton?

207
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:29,763
Well, Mattie Springer
has a little spunk in her.

208
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:31,662
That's fine by me.

209
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:35,735
Fine by you or not,
I am who I am, Mr. Fulton.

210
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:39,394
Well, you knew my name. I've been hearing it
all day.

211
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:40,843
Is that so?

212
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:42,638
It is.

213
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:46,987
Well?

214
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:49,300
Well, what?

215
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:51,544
Are you gonna
ask me to dance?

216
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:53,546
I thought I already did.

217
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,721
No. You said
I heard I liked to dance.

218
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:58,723
Ain't that the same thing?

219
00:18:58,758 --> 00:19:01,347
No, not to me.

220
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:04,867
Well?

221
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:05,903
Well, what?

222
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,905
Are you going to dance?

223
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,217
Well, that depends.

224
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:11,322
Depends on what?

225
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:15,154
On whether you're
asking or telling.

226
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,569
I see.

227
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:18,847
Well, I better ask you.

228
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:21,781
Then maybe I'll
give you an answer.

229
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:25,198
Would you like to dance,
Mattie Springer?

230
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:29,168
Why, yes, I would,
Zebediah Fulton.

231
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:35,139
It's about time.

232
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,249
You're welcome
to call me Zeb.

233
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:45,287
And you're welcome to call
me Mattie. All my friends do.

234
00:19:45,322 --> 00:19:47,324
And how many friends
do you have, Mattie?

235
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:50,361
Well, my mama always said

236
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:53,709
if I could count my best friends
with one hand, then I'm fine.

237
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:56,919
Well, this was just grand.

238
00:19:56,954 --> 00:19:59,370
Zeb and I courted
for a few months,

239
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:02,235
and finally he proposed.

240
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:13,626
Well, it was off to town to go
get supplies for the wedding.

241
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,731
I love going into town.

242
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:19,079
Just between you, me,
and the gatepost,

243
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:21,081
I like to see everybody.

244
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:22,945
People watch, you know?

245
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,706
And you always hear
the latest gossip

246
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,535
and news from all around.

247
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,470
I love watching the
stagecoaches come and go.

248
00:20:30,505 --> 00:20:32,196
What do you mean,
there's no gold in this?

249
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,991
I know
there's gold in this!

250
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,994
I only looked at it because
you wanted me to assay it,

251
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,239
and I need my five bucks
for assaying it. Five bucks?

252
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,379
Well, you know,
I got the sign out here.

253
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:45,071
I'm an assayer. You come
to me because I'm an expert.

254
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:53,079
Uncle Benjamin and Aunt Mary

255
00:20:53,113 --> 00:20:55,115
came to help do
some of the planning,

256
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,359
along with their daughters.

257
00:20:57,394 --> 00:21:00,811
Now, my cousin Ellen is the
sweetest girl you ever meet,

258
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,433
and she was
very well finished,

259
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:04,193
coming from
a rich family and all.

260
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:07,162
Uncle Benjamin
worked for the railroad.

261
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:11,546
Ellen, however, I don't think
she's ever drawn water from a well

262
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,789
or plucked a chicken
in her life.

263
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:16,827
But the one thing
she could do is shop.

264
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:20,451
And if it was expensive,
she'd find it.

265
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,707
Oh.

266
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:44,406
Hello there, young ladies.
How are you today?

267
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:48,376
Oh, we're fine.
Isn't this beautiful?

268
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,757
Hello, Mrs. Tuttle.

269
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:55,037
Hello, Mattie.
You know, it's very rare

270
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,661
that I would even have
a dress like this in the shop,

271
00:21:57,695 --> 00:21:59,766
but Brenda Lee's daughter
decided to elope,

272
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:02,942
and I was left with
this wonderful inventory.

273
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:06,048
Well, did you know that
Mattie just got engaged?

274
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,361
I did not know that.

275
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:10,605
Congratulations, Mattie.

276
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:12,503
Thank you.

277
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:16,127
Do you think she could
try it on, Mrs. Tuttle?

278
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:20,891
Well, it is quite expensive,

279
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:23,480
but I think it would
be all right.

280
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:27,587
Mattie, why don't you step behind
the screen, and I'll get the dress.

281
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:29,313
Okay.

282
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:38,495
So have you seen
Zeb's place yet?

283
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,220
No, but Pa has.

284
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:41,463
Well, what's it like?

285
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:43,465
Not sure.

286
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,985
Zeb and Jake's mama
died a few years ago,

287
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:48,643
so the house might be
a little rough.

288
00:22:48,677 --> 00:22:51,680
But I'm sure they're preparing
for a lady to come in.

289
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:53,613
Uh-huh.

290
00:22:57,617 --> 00:23:01,794
Oh, Mattie,
it's so beautiful,

291
00:23:01,828 --> 00:23:04,175
as if it was made
just for you.

292
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:09,698
So, any mention
of a honeymoon?

293
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:15,324
Well, Zeb did say something about
taking a trip down to the Colorado River

294
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,189
to a special little place
he knows.

295
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:19,674
You're so lucky.

296
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,090
I wish I could find
someone like Zeb.

297
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:23,678
I'll want to hear
all about it.

298
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:28,545
Well, I think you ladies
have found the perfect dress.

299
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:30,616
It doesn't even
need altering.

300
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,860
Oh, really, Mattie,
it looks beautiful on you.

301
00:23:46,355 --> 00:23:50,256
Pa, what do you think?

302
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,672
Oh, Mattie,
you look so beautiful.

303
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:54,674
Just like your mother.

304
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:58,126
Well, Pa,
it's awful costly.

305
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,543
I could pick out something else
or wear something from home.

306
00:24:01,578 --> 00:24:03,925
Oh, no, no, no,
absolutely not.

307
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,892
Not for your wedding.
How much is it?

308
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:11,553
It's... It's fifty dollars.

309
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:27,362
Uncle Jess?

310
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:35,612
Fifty dollars.

311
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:40,306
But Uncle Jess, isn't she the most
beautiful bride you ever did see?

312
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,756
Fifty dollars?

313
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,484
But Uncle Jess, you only buy
a wedding dress once and all.

314
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,728
Fifty dollars?

315
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:01,223
You know, ever since Zeb
proposed to Mattie,

316
00:25:01,258 --> 00:25:03,571
all she could do is talk
about her wedding dress.

317
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:06,263
Isn't that what girls
dream about?

318
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:10,060
I remember her mother
on our wedding day.

319
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:12,269
It's like it was yesterday.

320
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:18,724
I want Mattie to be happy,
but fifty dollars? That's...

321
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:21,554
That's just more
than I can do.

322
00:25:31,944 --> 00:25:33,946
Go on, take it.

323
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,466
Just let me have one dance with her
at the reception in that pretty dress.

324
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,239
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

325
00:25:51,273 --> 00:25:53,068
to witness Mattie and Zeb

326
00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:56,485
enter the wonderful life
of matrimony.

327
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:05,598
The best evening of my life.

328
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,807
All my family was there,

329
00:26:07,842 --> 00:26:10,016
and everyone was
so happy for us.

330
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,676
And now it's off
to my new home.

331
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,611
I felt like a queen
going to her new castle.

332
00:27:03,483 --> 00:27:04,761
This is our place.

333
00:27:04,795 --> 00:27:05,796
Oh.

334
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:07,315
Welcome home, sweetheart.

335
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:10,387
Mm, mm-hmm.

336
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,389
Mm-hmm.

337
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:19,120
We ain't had much cleaning since
Ma passed on about three years ago.

338
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:20,777
Zeb and I ain't
too good at that.

339
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:22,537
Hmm. Say that again.

340
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,437
Ain't nothing a little soap
can't cure, right, Mattie?

341
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:29,061
As soon as we get
this place up to snuff,

342
00:27:29,095 --> 00:27:31,477
you can get started
on some supper.

343
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:33,582
I'm starved.
How about you?

344
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:37,586
I'll go get you some firewood
and a couple chickens.

345
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:40,693
There's also some flour
and stuff out back.

346
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:42,212
And I'll get you
some cured bacon.

347
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:47,251
That'll be just fine, Jacob.
I'll get started in here.

348
00:27:54,603 --> 00:28:00,333
Jake, you wouldn't mind sleeping
outside tonight or in your mine,

349
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:03,612
considering this being our
wedding night and all, would you?

350
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:06,201
Sure, Zeb,
yeah, I understand.

351
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:11,448
All right, go ahead and leave
it open. It's a nice night.

352
00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:41,305
Married life is wonderful.

353
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,893
You learn a lot
about yourself

354
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:46,103
when you're so involved
with someone else.

355
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:48,416
Zebediah went on his
first prospecting trip

356
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,418
a few months
after our wedding.

357
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:53,076
I know miners have to go
where no one else has been

358
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,905
to get fresh claims.

359
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,045
And he would send me
telegraphs from time to time,

360
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,807
letting me know
how he was doing.

361
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:03,949
I have my friend Doris Mae
go and get 'em in town.

362
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:13,406
Sure I got a horse.
His name's Strawberry.

363
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:16,582
He's a good horse, too.
He's fast and strong. Well, that's nice.

364
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:19,585
It's such a lovely night
tonight. It sure is, ma'am.

365
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:25,625
Ma'am, don't let that cowboy
convince you as if he's got any money.

366
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,180
No.

367
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:30,838
Darling, where you going?
I'm still here.

368
00:29:30,872 --> 00:29:32,391
Why, you wretched snake!

369
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:34,531
I ain't taking this
from you. You better slow down, boy!

370
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,016
You know you still
owe me money.

371
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,162
Ah, too rich for my blood.

372
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:47,613
So where are
we headed next?

373
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:53,308
Ah, I've got all kinds of claims
sprinkled well north of the Grand Canyon.

374
00:29:53,343 --> 00:29:56,829
But not gold. Silver.

375
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,625
Silver?

376
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:02,007
Well, I hear silver
is wonderful.

377
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:05,493
I've even heard of prospecting your
way to riches within a year's time,

378
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:08,013
chasing those veins
that are just packed!

379
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:12,465
You from around here,
stranger? Up north?

380
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,502
Out west?

381
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:16,159
Utah has some hills that
no one has ever touched.

382
00:30:16,193 --> 00:30:18,195
Just waiting
for some dry washes.

383
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,681
Not so friendly, I guess.

384
00:30:24,477 --> 00:30:28,205
So once we head up to Nevada,
that silver will be everywhere.

385
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,175
We're gonna get rich quicker
than those gold boys down here.

386
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:34,902
All we need to do is head
up that Pass toward Tonophah,

387
00:30:34,936 --> 00:30:37,214
and the silver will be
waiting for you.

388
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,374
You listening in
on our business, mister?

389
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:01,480
I bet you
he's a claim jumper.

390
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:03,896
Now, now, boys,
ain't no call for violence.

391
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:07,624
A man can't but overhear things,
especially in a place like this.

392
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:11,041
Tell you what.

393
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:14,942
You go ahead and buy a dance
with them nice ladies.

394
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:17,565
I gotta be getting on home.

395
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:37,861
Jefe, I'm bored up to death.

396
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,967
When are we going out again?

397
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:43,453
I got Nate out scouting.
He should be back any day.

398
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:46,042
Scouting? Where?

399
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:47,733
Down by Vivian mining camp.

400
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:51,254
We've been down
those parts already.

401
00:31:51,288 --> 00:31:54,567
Besides, they have
a sheriff down there.

402
00:31:54,602 --> 00:31:59,710
Yeah, but they ain't likely to be
far from some Mimbrenos in that area.

403
00:31:59,745 --> 00:32:01,816
Mimbrenos? Yep.

404
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,613
They've been chasing some caballeros
down there by Kingman just recently.

405
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:09,375
And you want
to go to Vivian?

406
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,862
Chuy, your brain ain't got
but two speeds: slow and stop.

407
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:15,381
It don't matter
where the sheriffs are.

408
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,521
It don't matter
where the Mimbrenos are.

409
00:32:17,556 --> 00:32:21,560
We can blame them Indians
for every raid in that area.

410
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:25,564
So Vivian is
ripe for the taking.

411
00:32:26,668 --> 00:32:28,291
Just the way we like it.

412
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:29,602
Well, I'm gonna race you!

413
00:32:29,637 --> 00:32:31,466
Jefe!

414
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,866
Who goes there?

415
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:05,664
Good job, Barker.

416
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:37,213
I guess you heard Zeb
come in this afternoon.

417
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:38,731
I heard.

418
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,861
Mmm. Smells good.

419
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:08,485
Look who showed up.

420
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,797
Looks good, too.

421
00:35:14,595 --> 00:35:17,529
Mattie,
where'd you put my...

422
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,776
Any trouble?

423
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:25,813
No, no trouble. You?

424
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,368
None to speak of.

425
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:32,785
Ran into some Maricopa Apache
that weren't too friendly.

426
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,684
We came to an understanding.

427
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:37,065
Yeah, I bet.

428
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:43,279
Zeb, what...

429
00:35:43,313 --> 00:35:45,453
Aw, it ain't nothing.

430
00:35:45,488 --> 00:35:47,283
Trust me, they ain't
nearly as frightful

431
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:51,183
as those Mimbreno Apache I ran into
a few years back over in Texas Canyon.

432
00:35:51,218 --> 00:35:54,117
Now, they were
downright inhospitable.

433
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,845
Zeb, why on earth do you tempt
fate like that for no reason?

434
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,297
Can't help myself,
Mattie.

435
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:03,057
Just born to roam,
I guess.

436
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:07,337
But I say I can outrun any
Apache in the territory.

437
00:36:07,372 --> 00:36:09,443
But why take the chance?

438
00:36:09,477 --> 00:36:11,065
There's no sense in it.

439
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:14,586
You have a house
to take care of and me.

440
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:19,107
I came home, didn't I?

441
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:21,731
And it looks like you and
Jake done a real good job here.

442
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,563
That's not the point.

443
00:36:28,634 --> 00:36:30,602
Maybe I should leave y'all two
alone for a little while.

444
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:32,466
Maybe you should.

445
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:38,403
Well...

446
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,614
Well, what?

447
00:36:42,648 --> 00:36:45,203
Well, why are you
acting like this?

448
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:48,171
I figured you'd be
happy to see me.

449
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,655
Why should I?

450
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,244
Because you're my wife.

451
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:55,109
And you're my husband.

452
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:58,250
Although it might be a bit hard
for anybody to tell.

453
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:02,565
Now, what's that supposed
to mean, Mattie?

454
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,809
It means that I'm tired
of waking up a morning

455
00:37:05,844 --> 00:37:10,469
just to find you lit on another
one of your private adventures.

456
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:13,817
Just up and go
whenever you please,

457
00:37:13,852 --> 00:37:17,304
not caring about
what I think or I feel

458
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:19,444
and not knowing
when you're coming back

459
00:37:19,478 --> 00:37:21,446
or if you're
coming back at all! Now, Mattie...

460
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,932
Don't you "Now, Mattie" me,
Zebediah Fulton.

461
00:37:24,966 --> 00:37:28,246
We are a family, and family
don't treat each other this way.

462
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,317
I didn't never hear
Jake complain.

463
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:35,149
Well, you ain't married to Jake,
and I ain't either.

464
00:37:35,183 --> 00:37:39,187
But he's the one that gets the chores
done around here day in and day out.

465
00:37:39,222 --> 00:37:40,948
And where are you?

466
00:37:40,982 --> 00:37:42,984
What kind of husband are you? Now, hold your tongue, woman.

467
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:45,228
You got no call
to talk to me like that.

468
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,300
Pa would have slapped my ma clean
into tomorrow for raising her voice.

469
00:37:48,335 --> 00:37:50,958
Well, I ain't your ma,

470
00:37:50,992 --> 00:37:52,994
and I speak my tongue
as I see fit,

471
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:54,617
whether you like it or not.

472
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:56,964
That's enough, Mattie!

473
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:07,319
You are something else,
ain't you?

474
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:12,290
You surely are the
feistiest woman I ever known.

475
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:14,188
Just be careful
not to push me too far,

476
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:17,122
lest I forget
my gentleman manners.

477
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:23,266
And how far have you
pushed me, Zebediah?

478
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:28,064
I am your wife, but you have
yet to become my husband.

479
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:18,010
What's wrong, Zeb? She was a
little too much for you to handle?

480
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:20,323
Shut up, Jake.

481
00:39:47,246 --> 00:39:49,594
Well, finally
the church was built,

482
00:39:49,628 --> 00:39:52,286
and right at the same time
came the new parson,

483
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,839
Parson James.

484
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:56,566
He was a sweet man
and a great preacher,

485
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:59,258
but I was just as fond
of his wife Clara.

486
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:02,710
She was very smart
and ambitious.

487
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:05,679
She teaches me to speak
more proper English.

488
00:40:05,713 --> 00:40:09,130
And we hit it off
right away.

489
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:11,270
Where's Zebediah? I
haven't seen him in a while.

490
00:40:11,305 --> 00:40:15,654
Well, he's off up north
somewhere.

491
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:17,932
He heard there was some gold
in the Kaibab country, so...

492
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:20,797
I didn't realize
he ventured off so far.

493
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:22,937
Yeah, he goes
as far as he pleases

494
00:40:22,972 --> 00:40:24,870
and whenever
he's feeling like it.

495
00:40:24,905 --> 00:40:26,458
I see.

496
00:40:26,493 --> 00:40:29,530
Oh, no, don't get me wrong. He's
not a bad person or anything,

497
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:30,807
and I'm still his wife.

498
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:33,189
Some men just have
a more difficult time

499
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,294
when it comes to
settling down than others.

500
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:38,746
Sad to say,
some men never settle down,

501
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:42,474
and a woman's got a responsibility
to take care of herself.

502
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,131
Oh, what do you mean?

503
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:47,306
I've been keeping the house
by myself since Ma died. Yes.

504
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:49,550
You do, Mattie,
but you have your Pa around

505
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:52,070
as the man of the house
for protection.

506
00:40:52,104 --> 00:40:56,143
A woman has got to know how
to defend herself if necessary.

507
00:40:56,177 --> 00:41:01,079
Yeah, with all this violence that's
been happening around here and all.

508
00:41:01,113 --> 00:41:05,808
Mattie, let me teach you
something else besides English.

509
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:10,985
Oh, Lord forgive me.

510
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:16,197
Wha...

511
00:41:16,232 --> 00:41:19,200
Is that thing loaded?

512
00:41:19,235 --> 00:41:21,720
Is there any other kind?

513
00:41:21,755 --> 00:41:27,795
Listen, why don't you and Jacob
come on over for Sunday supper?

514
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,142
All right, we'd love to.

515
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:31,868
Let's go.

516
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:37,771
The Lord is my light
and my salvation.

517
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,569
Of whom shall I fear?

518
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:44,363
The Lord is the stronghold
of my life.

519
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:47,505
Of whom shall I be afraid?

520
00:41:48,851 --> 00:41:51,992
When evil men advance
against me to devour my flesh,

521
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:56,030
when my enemies and foes
attack me to devour my flesh,

522
00:41:57,273 --> 00:42:01,035
they shall stumble and fall.

523
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,383
Though an army besiege me,
my heart will not fear,

524
00:42:05,419 --> 00:42:07,317
though war
break out against me,

525
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:09,561
even then
will I be confident.

526
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:21,987
So nice of Jacob to take
time off on the Lord's day.

527
00:42:22,022 --> 00:42:25,128
I wish Zeb would sit in
once in a while.

528
00:42:25,163 --> 00:42:26,578
It'd do him some good.

529
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:28,062
Give him time, Mattie.

530
00:42:28,097 --> 00:42:30,133
All right, Mattie,

531
00:42:30,168 --> 00:42:31,549
hold it like this.

532
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:38,003
Aim right at the target...

533
00:42:38,038 --> 00:42:39,902
and shoot.

534
00:42:44,078 --> 00:42:46,840
Now, Mattie,
when you fire a gun,

535
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:49,774
you don't want
to pull the trigger.

536
00:42:49,808 --> 00:42:53,950
You want to squeeze
the entire gun.

537
00:42:58,506 --> 00:43:00,923
Well, praise the Lord.

538
00:43:00,957 --> 00:43:03,339
Why don't you keep that?

539
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:05,513
Oh, no, I couldn't.

540
00:43:05,548 --> 00:43:07,792
Honey, I got plenty of them.

541
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,672
Jacob, good morning.

542
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:28,329
How's it going? Good.

543
00:43:28,364 --> 00:43:31,056
Got some more for you. Let me take a look.

544
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:36,786
You heard about them
claim jumpers and thieves

545
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:39,789
that had been spotted
by the Sacramento wash?

546
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:41,239
Yeah, I heard.

547
00:43:41,273 --> 00:43:44,035
Getting mighty violent
out there.

548
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:45,312
Heard from your brother?

549
00:43:45,346 --> 00:43:47,417
No, not in weeks.

550
00:43:50,144 --> 00:43:52,319
Well, good to
see you, Jess. Swede.

551
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:54,045
Jess. Jacob.

552
00:43:55,702 --> 00:43:59,878
Billy, can you get those
concentrates out of the wagon, please?

553
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:03,123
Hear anything from Zeb?

554
00:44:03,157 --> 00:44:05,677
Not in weeks.

555
00:44:05,712 --> 00:44:07,921
Is that a fact?

556
00:44:07,955 --> 00:44:09,301
You heard about the Walkers?

557
00:44:09,336 --> 00:44:10,578
He heard.

558
00:44:20,588 --> 00:44:22,694
Jacob,
I've been hearing things.

559
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:24,765
What things?

560
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,009
You heard what happened
to the Walker women.

561
00:44:27,043 --> 00:44:28,700
Yeah, I heard.
Makes me sick.

562
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:32,393
Makes us all
sick and afraid.

563
00:44:32,428 --> 00:44:34,775
I still have
two girls with me,

564
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:39,642
and you have my Mattie
up with you and Zeb.

565
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,852
Just keep her safe, Jacob.

566
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:45,959
I will, Jess.
You have my word.

567
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:49,583
Hey, Jake.

568
00:44:49,617 --> 00:44:51,481
Yes, sir?

569
00:44:51,516 --> 00:44:55,589
I know... I know Mattie's
married to Zeb, but he ain't...

570
00:44:55,623 --> 00:44:57,625
Zeb has just been busy,
Jess, that's all.

571
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,765
Zeb's a good man.

572
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:02,078
I don't mean anything by it.
It's just...

573
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:06,393
Mattie's my daughter, and I don't
want her to get hurt, understand?

574
00:45:06,427 --> 00:45:08,291
I understand, Jess.

575
00:45:19,302 --> 00:45:20,510
I got all the concentrates, Pa.

576
00:45:20,545 --> 00:45:22,064
Here, let me
get that from you, son.

577
00:45:22,098 --> 00:45:24,204
Thank you very much.

578
00:45:24,238 --> 00:45:26,240
You hear about
those Mimbrenos? He heard.

579
00:45:26,275 --> 00:45:29,934
Ain't no Mimbreno gonna raid
our house, ain't that right, Pa?

580
00:45:29,968 --> 00:45:32,453
I hope not, Billy.
I hope not.

581
00:45:32,488 --> 00:45:34,697
Strangest thing,
though. What's that?

582
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,735
The Mimbreno killed all the
people and burned down the house.

583
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,840
And what's strange about that?
They've been doing that for years.

584
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:42,636
They didn't take
the animals. What?

585
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,811
The animals.
I heard the sheriff say

586
00:45:44,845 --> 00:45:50,540
that the chickens, cows,
pigs, all got left behind.

587
00:45:50,575 --> 00:45:53,336
Mighty strange
for the Mimbreno.

588
00:46:02,898 --> 00:46:08,179
How'd your ore do
at the assay office?

589
00:46:08,213 --> 00:46:11,976
Good. Good enough
to keep me digging.

590
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,288
Won't Zeb be surprised?

591
00:46:14,323 --> 00:46:16,187
I reckon.

592
00:46:16,221 --> 00:46:18,396
He's proud of you,
you know.

593
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,708
I know.

594
00:46:20,743 --> 00:46:24,333
You ever think
about tomorrow, Jake?

595
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:25,955
Well, tomorrow's Tuesday.

596
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:29,338
No, not tomorrow tomorrow.

597
00:46:29,372 --> 00:46:31,719
Tomorrow in the future.

598
00:46:31,754 --> 00:46:33,618
Do you ever think
about getting married?

599
00:46:33,652 --> 00:46:36,207
Having a family
of your own?

600
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:38,554
I've thought about it.

601
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:40,280
Yeah, well?

602
00:46:42,696 --> 00:46:44,180
And?

603
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:46,873
And I'm still
thinking about it.

604
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:48,875
Well, that's a good thing.

605
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:51,843
It's good to think
about those things.

606
00:46:53,224 --> 00:46:55,329
What about you and Zeb?

607
00:46:55,364 --> 00:46:57,987
What about us?

608
00:46:58,022 --> 00:47:01,819
Are you...
I mean, is there...

609
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:05,098
Are we gonna have babies?

610
00:47:05,132 --> 00:47:08,756
Yeah, I suppose. Whoa.

611
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:12,588
Someday when he's ready to
settle down and raise a family.

612
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:15,039
What if he never does?

613
00:47:16,523 --> 00:47:18,663
I'm sorry, Mattie.
I shouldn't have said nothing.

614
00:47:18,697 --> 00:47:20,285
Ain't none of
my business no ways.

615
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,253
No, it's not, Jake.

616
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:24,738
It's between
me and my husband.

617
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:29,329
Mattie!

618
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,057
Mattie!

619
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:36,370
Mattie!

620
00:47:37,406 --> 00:47:40,064
Mattie, Mattie...

621
00:47:40,098 --> 00:47:43,308
Oi! You shouldn't have
come home so soon. Jacob!

622
00:47:43,343 --> 00:47:44,862
Mattie, get down!

623
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,780
Blow the crate, Mattie!

624
00:48:35,774 --> 00:48:39,433
Are you the one causing all
the trouble in these parts?

625
00:48:39,468 --> 00:48:43,058
Are there more of you
out there?

626
00:48:45,232 --> 00:48:48,270
Speak up or you'll lose
that comfortable bench.

627
00:48:50,306 --> 00:48:51,963
Answer me,

628
00:48:51,998 --> 00:48:53,827
or you'll answer to God
right now.

629
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:56,416
It wasn't my fault.
I'm just a scout.

630
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:57,520
Scouting for who?

631
00:48:57,555 --> 00:48:59,246
Lockett.

632
00:48:59,281 --> 00:49:01,386
When he finds out
that I'm missing,

633
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:02,836
he's going to come
looking for you.

634
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:03,941
What's he want around here?

635
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:06,944
Gold. Same as everyone else,
minus the work.

636
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,980
You're gonna hang
for what you've done.

637
00:49:09,015 --> 00:49:10,016
You understand?

638
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,502
Not unless Lockett
gets ahold of you first,

639
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:15,814
or your women.

640
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:24,823
Sheriff, can we speed up the
system of justice in this town?

641
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:27,619
I think that can be
accommodated in this case.

642
00:49:27,654 --> 00:49:30,312
How about tomorrow...

643
00:49:30,346 --> 00:49:31,347
morning...

644
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:33,936
early.

645
00:50:01,757 --> 00:50:03,069
Damn mutt.

646
00:50:09,075 --> 00:50:10,076
Who goes there?

647
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,457
Ho, in the cabin!

648
00:50:12,492 --> 00:50:15,874
Don't shoot!
We're up from Prescott.

649
00:50:15,909 --> 00:50:17,531
Been on the run
from some Mimbrenos.

650
00:50:17,566 --> 00:50:19,085
What Mimbreno?

651
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,121
We didn't take time to ask!

652
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:24,262
We just need some food and some
feed for our horses, mister,

653
00:50:24,297 --> 00:50:26,402
and we'll be on our way.

654
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:34,203
We'll pay for the supplies!

655
00:50:36,654 --> 00:50:39,139
Billy, hold on to this
until I come back inside.

656
00:50:39,174 --> 00:50:40,692
Sarah, watch your sister.

657
00:50:40,727 --> 00:50:44,593
And nobody comes through that
door except for me, understand?

658
00:50:57,985 --> 00:50:58,986
Pa!

659
00:51:02,335 --> 00:51:04,302
No! No!

660
00:51:15,382 --> 00:51:16,383
Let's go.

661
00:51:16,418 --> 00:51:18,903
I'll catch them later.

662
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:21,492
We can't leave anyone alive.

663
00:51:21,526 --> 00:51:24,598
Suit yourself.

664
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:38,302
No sense in running, girl.

665
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,651
You ain't gonna get far.

666
00:51:58,253 --> 00:51:59,392
I got him.

667
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,636
Let's get out of here.

668
00:52:59,728 --> 00:53:01,695
Jess! Jess!

669
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:02,731
Jess!

670
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:06,424
Jess! Jess!

671
00:53:06,459 --> 00:53:10,359
No! No!

672
00:53:48,328 --> 00:53:51,124
I appreciate you...

673
00:53:51,158 --> 00:53:53,126
You know. I know.

674
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:02,584
All of them?

675
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:04,171
I found Jess
and little Katherine.

676
00:54:04,206 --> 00:54:06,450
No sign of Sarah and Billy.

677
00:54:07,692 --> 00:54:08,969
Indians?

678
00:54:09,004 --> 00:54:10,730
Possibly, but it
could've been Commancheros.

679
00:54:12,904 --> 00:54:13,940
Where's Zeb?

680
00:54:15,113 --> 00:54:17,081
I don't know.

681
00:54:17,115 --> 00:54:19,256
Probably far away
from here.

682
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,189
He'll come back
as soon as he hears.

683
00:54:24,537 --> 00:54:26,953
Can you find
Sarah and Billy?

684
00:54:26,987 --> 00:54:28,403
I'll do my best, Mattie.

685
00:54:28,437 --> 00:54:32,061
I can't bear the thought
of losing them, too.

686
00:54:32,096 --> 00:54:34,167
And with Zeb gone...

687
00:54:36,169 --> 00:54:38,413
I know it's wrong
to think certain things,

688
00:54:38,447 --> 00:54:43,141
but I can't help but wonder
what God's doing sometimes.

689
00:55:54,212 --> 00:55:56,732
You know,
I've been thinking Jake.

690
00:55:56,767 --> 00:55:59,494
About what?

691
00:55:59,528 --> 00:56:02,082
I'm not doing much good
around here these days.

692
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:05,431
You only been back
a month, Zeb.

693
00:56:05,465 --> 00:56:06,639
I know,

694
00:56:06,673 --> 00:56:10,505
but I heard they found
some silver up in Nevada.

695
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:14,267
They say a man
could get rich overnight.

696
00:56:14,301 --> 00:56:17,270
I figure it might be a good
time to grab us some new claims.

697
00:56:17,304 --> 00:56:20,653
We've got claims
right here, Zeb.

698
00:56:20,687 --> 00:56:22,413
And what about Mattie?

699
00:56:22,448 --> 00:56:25,036
Well, you're here.
You can take care of her.

700
00:56:25,071 --> 00:56:28,315
That ain't right, Zeb.

701
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,146
Look, Jake,
you know how I am.

702
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,942
I can't be tied down like this.
I just can't do it.

703
00:56:33,976 --> 00:56:37,048
She ain't even over her grief
yet. It's been hard on her, Zeb.

704
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:41,708
You think I don't know that?
I'll make it up to her.

705
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:46,886
I'll have her come on up to
Nevada once I get set up and all

706
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,336
and take her away
from all of this.

707
00:56:49,371 --> 00:56:52,167
When are you
gonna tell her?

708
00:56:54,272 --> 00:56:57,483
Well, I was thinking
you could do that for me.

709
00:56:57,517 --> 00:57:00,244
She's not herself right now.
She might not understand.

710
00:57:00,278 --> 00:57:02,384
Coming from you would be
a lot easier on her.

711
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,628
Look, don't do that
to her Zeb, okay?

712
00:57:04,662 --> 00:57:07,458
She has a right
to hear it from you. You, me, what's the difference?

713
00:57:07,493 --> 00:57:10,392
The difference is that you're
her husband, and I ain't.

714
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,326
I know, but coming from you
would be a lot easier,

715
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,639
you not being
attached to her and all.

716
00:57:15,673 --> 00:57:17,848
I can't do it, Zeb.

717
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:24,061
Just think about it, Jake.

718
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:26,408
You're my younger brother,
and I wouldn't ask

719
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,343
unless I thought
it was best for all of us.

720
00:57:30,377 --> 00:57:32,863
Best for all of us
or best for you, Zeb?

721
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:39,973
All I'm asking is
just think about it.

722
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,069
He's gone again, isn't he?

723
00:58:07,104 --> 00:58:09,416
Mattie, he was gonna
tell you himself, but...

724
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:12,730
No, he didn't.

725
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,534
The Lord seeks
the lowly and the meek.

726
00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:28,884
It is something about
the character of God.

727
00:58:28,919 --> 00:58:31,093
He is attracted to empty,

728
00:58:31,128 --> 00:58:34,511
while people are
attracted to full.

729
00:58:34,545 --> 00:58:37,755
The Lord wants the soul
that is poured out.

730
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:41,725
And sometimes to be poured
out, we must go through pain.

731
00:58:41,759 --> 00:58:44,969
Away with these saints who
say if you had great faith,

732
00:58:45,004 --> 00:58:47,420
you will not
go through anything bad.

733
00:58:47,454 --> 00:58:50,112
But my question to that is,

734
00:58:50,147 --> 00:58:54,151
if you didn't
go through anything,

735
00:58:54,185 --> 00:58:56,878
how would you know
you have great faith?

736
00:58:56,912 --> 00:59:02,021
It is the trial that
gives you your testimony.

737
00:59:02,055 --> 00:59:05,887
Do not be thankful that you
were able to avoid trouble.

738
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:10,926
Be thankful that you were able to
stand in the midst of the storm.

739
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:17,277
Therefore, whoever heareth
these sayings of mine

740
00:59:17,312 --> 00:59:19,383
and doeth them,

741
00:59:19,417 --> 00:59:22,144
I will liken him
as a wise man

742
00:59:22,179 --> 00:59:24,906
who built his house
up on a rock.

743
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:28,910
And the rains descended
and the floods came

744
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:32,085
and the winds blew
and beat upon that house,

745
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:37,056
and it did not fall because
it was founded upon a rock.

746
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:42,302
Notice that the scriptures
state that the storm will come

747
00:59:42,337 --> 00:59:44,719
whether you be
righteous or evil,

748
00:59:44,753 --> 00:59:49,378
for it is the trouble
that reveals the truth.

749
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:52,312
You are not going
to avoid all trouble.

750
00:59:52,347 --> 00:59:56,316
Instead, it is your ability
to stand on the rock

751
00:59:56,351 --> 01:00:00,320
that will reveal
where you built.

752
01:00:03,876 --> 01:00:05,843
The work of ministry,

753
01:00:05,878 --> 01:00:08,397
it never seems to end
in these parts.

754
01:00:08,432 --> 01:00:12,056
However, my wife Clara and I
felt called to soon minister

755
01:00:12,091 --> 01:00:14,472
to the nearby
Indian villages.

756
01:00:14,507 --> 01:00:16,129
One thing I know,

757
01:00:16,164 --> 01:00:18,407
whenever you're doing
the Lord's work,

758
01:00:18,442 --> 01:00:21,307
you never know
what you're gonna find.

759
01:01:58,473 --> 01:02:01,476
[no audible dialogue[

760
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:09,311
[no audible dialogue[

761
01:04:01,009 --> 01:04:02,873
They're exhausted.

762
01:04:02,908 --> 01:04:06,083
I guess I would be, too.

763
01:04:17,129 --> 01:04:20,339
I should probably
head on out to the mine.

764
01:04:20,373 --> 01:04:22,686
You could stay
in here, Jake.

765
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,550
Well, I'll be fine out there.

766
01:04:24,584 --> 01:04:27,346
It's okay.
You take the bed.

767
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:29,348
I don't feel like
sleeping anyway.

768
01:04:29,382 --> 01:04:32,213
It's your bed, Mattie.

769
01:05:18,638 --> 01:05:23,126
Well, after Billy and Sarah
were home, I felt a lot better.

770
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,887
Life was worth continuing.

771
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:55,365
You think I could learn
how to mine gold, Jacob?

772
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:58,506
Yeah, I reckon.

773
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,026
It takes a lot of patience
and a strong back.

774
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,167
Well, I'm real strong
and patient.

775
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:06,617
All right.
Grab that chisel over there.

776
01:06:08,033 --> 01:06:10,311
Gold tends to travel
in quartz, okay?

777
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:12,037
I found this vein
about a year ago,

778
01:06:12,071 --> 01:06:13,797
and I've been chasing it
ever since.

779
01:06:13,831 --> 01:06:17,283
Hey, Sarah, could you shuck
some more of this corn?

780
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:22,633
How do you want them cooked?

781
01:06:22,668 --> 01:06:25,947
Oh, I don't know,
how about boiled?

782
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,087
That's boring.

783
01:06:28,122 --> 01:06:31,332
Pa always liked it
roasted or creamed.

784
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:33,437
Yes, he did.

785
01:06:33,472 --> 01:06:34,576
Your choice.

786
01:06:35,957 --> 01:06:37,924
Um, roasted.

787
01:06:37,959 --> 01:06:40,651
So can you get rich
doing this kind of stuff?

788
01:06:40,686 --> 01:06:42,205
Oh, yeah. Here.

789
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:45,242
Chisel right down
that fracture, right here.

790
01:06:50,351 --> 01:06:52,146
All right.

791
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,044
How does Jacob
like his corn?

792
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,358
Oh, he'll have it
any way it's prepared,

793
01:06:57,392 --> 01:07:00,050
just as long as
there's plenty of it.

794
01:07:00,085 --> 01:07:02,328
What about Zeb?

795
01:07:03,571 --> 01:07:06,505
Well, let's see.

796
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:08,679
I guess I don't know
how he likes his corn

797
01:07:08,714 --> 01:07:11,234
because he'd never been around
when we had any of it.

798
01:07:11,268 --> 01:07:13,891
When is he coming back?

799
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:18,758
Whenever he feels like it,
I guess.

800
01:07:19,932 --> 01:07:22,486
You miss him?

801
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:25,593
Of course I miss him.

802
01:07:27,698 --> 01:07:29,321
Does he miss you?

803
01:07:29,355 --> 01:07:31,426
I guess so.

804
01:07:31,461 --> 01:07:33,601
Why all the questions?

805
01:07:33,635 --> 01:07:37,501
I'm telling you, if you're willing
to learn and work real hard,

806
01:07:37,536 --> 01:07:38,916
you can collect a fortune.

807
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:41,850
Gold is all around us.
We walk over it every day.

808
01:07:41,885 --> 01:07:46,752
People hurting and complaining
about things they don't have.

809
01:07:46,786 --> 01:07:49,099
They just don't see what's
available to them, I guess.

810
01:07:50,514 --> 01:07:52,033
He give you a baby yet?

811
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,932
No! No baby yet.

812
01:07:56,141 --> 01:07:57,314
Someday.

813
01:07:57,349 --> 01:07:58,764
Someday soon?

814
01:08:00,662 --> 01:08:03,665
Why don't you just
keep shucking that corn?

815
01:08:29,035 --> 01:08:32,108
Come back here,
you claim jumper!

816
01:08:34,282 --> 01:08:36,112
We're gonna get you!

817
01:09:56,571 --> 01:09:58,090
I got you now, boy!

818
01:10:31,572 --> 01:10:33,643
Where'd he go?

819
01:10:33,677 --> 01:10:35,472
Let's back up.

820
01:10:36,611 --> 01:10:38,095
Go! Hyah!

821
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:50,193
So what happens now,
Jacob?

822
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,404
What do you mean?

823
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:59,167
Me, Sarah, and Billy.

824
01:12:59,202 --> 01:13:02,999
Can we stay here a while
till I figure things out?

825
01:13:03,033 --> 01:13:06,209
What are you
talking about?

826
01:13:06,243 --> 01:13:08,384
Well, Zeb's gone.

827
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:12,560
The mine's yours now.
I just figured that...

828
01:13:12,595 --> 01:13:14,700
What?

829
01:13:14,735 --> 01:13:17,531
Well, that you'd
want us to go.

830
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:20,568
Go? Why in the world
would you think that?

831
01:13:23,226 --> 01:13:25,987
So you don't
want us to go?

832
01:13:26,022 --> 01:13:29,439
No, Mattie,
this is your home.

833
01:13:29,474 --> 01:13:32,097
You sure?

834
01:13:32,131 --> 01:13:34,479
Mattie, you stay
as long as you like.

835
01:13:34,513 --> 01:13:36,998
Sarah and Billy, too.

836
01:13:37,033 --> 01:13:39,104
Thank you, Jacob.

837
01:13:44,903 --> 01:13:47,284
And, Mattie?

838
01:13:47,319 --> 01:13:48,734
Yes?

839
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,083
Never mind.

840
01:14:08,133 --> 01:14:10,687
I'm so sorry, Zeb.

841
01:14:10,722 --> 01:14:13,897
I'm so sorry.

842
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:32,433
Hey! Breakfast is ready.
Come on, you two.

843
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,274
We got a lot of
cleaning to do today.

844
01:14:46,309 --> 01:14:47,621
I know.

845
01:14:47,655 --> 01:14:49,450
And you need to get those
concentrates cleaned.

846
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:50,451
I know.

847
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,591
What are you doing today,
Jacob?

848
01:14:52,626 --> 01:14:56,492
I reckon, I ought to head on
down to the assay office

849
01:14:56,526 --> 01:14:58,735
and check on some
ore ratios and prices.

850
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:01,531
Can I come with you? Not until you get those
concentrates cleaned.

851
01:15:01,566 --> 01:15:03,153
Mattie!

852
01:15:03,188 --> 01:15:06,640
I still need to fix
that leak on the roof.

853
01:15:06,674 --> 01:15:08,952
You think you can have those
concentrates done by the time I finish?

854
01:15:08,987 --> 01:15:10,920
You bet I can.

855
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:17,547
Hey, you won't be out
after dark will you?

856
01:15:17,582 --> 01:15:18,893
No, I don't think so.

857
01:15:18,928 --> 01:15:20,446
Okay.

858
01:15:25,175 --> 01:15:27,384
What's with you two?

859
01:15:27,419 --> 01:15:28,593
Nothin'.

860
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:33,839
Sarah says you two are gonna get
hitched and have a passel of babies.

861
01:15:36,117 --> 01:15:38,844
Uh, I-I better go.

862
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,743
Gonna go fix that roof.

863
01:15:53,134 --> 01:15:54,929
I oughta tan
your hide good.

864
01:15:54,964 --> 01:15:58,623
It was Sarah
who said it. I did no such thing.

865
01:15:58,657 --> 01:16:02,212
Well, you're not too old for a good
strap across your backside, either.

866
01:16:02,247 --> 01:16:04,111
You wouldn't.

867
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:23,371
Mattie, what's wrong?
I didn't mean anything.

868
01:16:23,406 --> 01:16:28,411
It's just that I barely got
to know Zeb, and now he's gone.

869
01:16:28,445 --> 01:16:30,689
I just don't know
what to do.

870
01:16:30,724 --> 01:16:33,934
Mattie,
can I ask you something?

871
01:16:33,968 --> 01:16:35,867
What?

872
01:16:35,901 --> 01:16:38,110
Will you tell me
the truth?

873
01:16:38,145 --> 01:16:39,318
About what?

874
01:16:39,353 --> 01:16:40,423
Jacob.

875
01:16:42,045 --> 01:16:43,840
What about Jacob?

876
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,531
I think he loves you,
Mattie.

877
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:49,984
No.

878
01:16:50,019 --> 01:16:52,228
He can't.
I married Zeb.

879
01:16:52,262 --> 01:16:56,197
He loves you just the same,
and I think you love him, too.

880
01:16:59,442 --> 01:17:01,996
I can't. He's...

881
01:17:02,031 --> 01:17:03,826
What's wrong with
loving someone,

882
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:06,207
especially when
they love you back?

883
01:17:39,413 --> 01:17:41,001
What is it, Mattie?

884
01:17:41,035 --> 01:17:42,968
Oh, it's probably nothing.

885
01:17:43,003 --> 01:17:45,315
It's probably
just an old coyote

886
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:47,559
wandering too close
to the cabin.

887
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:52,460
Now, just stay in bed
and be quiet.

888
01:17:56,361 --> 01:17:57,811
Where's Jacob?

889
01:17:57,845 --> 01:18:00,158
He went to the mine.
He hasn't come back yet.

890
01:18:00,192 --> 01:18:02,470
Maybe the Mimbreno
got him. Billy!

891
01:18:02,505 --> 01:18:04,058
That's enough!

892
01:18:04,093 --> 01:18:06,889
Now be quiet,
the two of you.

893
01:18:06,923 --> 01:18:09,546
Ho! In the cabin!

894
01:18:09,581 --> 01:18:12,791
Don't shoot now.
We're friendly.

895
01:18:12,826 --> 01:18:16,553
We've been on the run
from some Mimbrenos.

896
01:18:16,588 --> 01:18:19,695
We just need a few provisions,
and we'll be on our way.

897
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:20,834
Can you help us out?

898
01:18:20,868 --> 01:18:22,698
Mattie, don't do it.

899
01:18:22,732 --> 01:18:24,561
He's the one who killed
Pa and Katherine.

900
01:18:24,596 --> 01:18:27,772
No, we don't open the door
at night, mister. No offense.

901
01:18:27,806 --> 01:18:31,327
So just take what you need on
the porch and be on your way.

902
01:18:34,295 --> 01:18:37,505
I don't blame you
being cautious, ma'am,

903
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:40,301
not with your menfolk
being gone and all.

904
01:18:44,478 --> 01:18:46,445
Well, the men are
due back anytime now,

905
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,516
and you don't want to be
here when they come in.

906
01:18:48,551 --> 01:18:51,105
They don't take kindly
to strangers.

907
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:54,143
So I've got a gun,

908
01:18:54,177 --> 01:18:57,836
and I'll shoot the first man
who steps foot through that door.

909
01:19:19,685 --> 01:19:21,308
Are you okay?

910
01:19:23,828 --> 01:19:25,208
I was so...

911
01:19:27,348 --> 01:19:30,075
Mattie, I was so scared. I know.

912
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:31,076
Shh. It's okay.

913
01:19:31,111 --> 01:19:32,906
I thought
they got you.

914
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,805
No, no, they didn't get me. Good thing.

915
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,324
Yeah, good thing.

916
01:20:24,578 --> 01:20:27,892
Sarah said dinner's
gonna be late again.

917
01:20:27,926 --> 01:20:30,722
I guess that pie's taking
longer than she expected.

918
01:20:32,448 --> 01:20:35,727
That's all right. I still gotta
show Billy how this rocker box works.

919
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:39,662
You're gonna be a good dad
one day, Jake.

920
01:20:39,696 --> 01:20:41,698
Billy thinks
the world of you.

921
01:20:41,733 --> 01:20:43,700
He's a good boy.

922
01:20:43,735 --> 01:20:46,393
He's just a little
high strung.

923
01:20:46,427 --> 01:20:49,568
Zeb used to be
the same way when...

924
01:20:49,603 --> 01:20:52,295
Well, that was
a long time ago.

925
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:55,229
I loved him, Jake.

926
01:20:55,264 --> 01:20:56,506
I know you did.

927
01:20:56,541 --> 01:20:58,577
I guess you always will.

928
01:20:58,612 --> 01:21:03,720
I will, just how I love
Ma and Pa and Katherine,

929
01:21:03,755 --> 01:21:05,826
Baby Clara.

930
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:09,416
I'll always love them, even
though I can't see 'em anymore.

931
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:11,245
Yeah.

932
01:21:13,351 --> 01:21:16,561
I brought you down here 'cause
I wanted to show you something.

933
01:21:16,595 --> 01:21:19,357
I don't want to pretend
to know it all, but...

934
01:21:19,391 --> 01:21:21,428
this is what I've learned.

935
01:21:24,017 --> 01:21:27,365
God is the ultimate
prospector,

936
01:21:27,399 --> 01:21:30,299
and at times,
he applies pressure to us.

937
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:33,750
Tough stuff just like the
water here in this rocking.

938
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:39,722
All the heavy good stuff
stays in the box,

939
01:21:39,756 --> 01:21:44,382
and all the light, unusable
material washes off the top.

940
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:47,695
And finally,
after it's all said and done,

941
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:52,148
after all the pain, grief,
and the loss,

942
01:21:52,183 --> 01:21:57,740
after you've let go of all your
bad habits and everything unusable,

943
01:21:57,774 --> 01:22:00,674
the pressure stops,

944
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,676
the storm cease,

945
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:05,955
and you will be like
fine gold.

946
01:22:11,823 --> 01:22:14,136
You'll be in
a place of destiny,

947
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:18,312
the right place at the right
time with the right one.

948
01:22:20,866 --> 01:22:23,559
Are you the right one,
Jake?

949
01:22:25,837 --> 01:22:27,597
Mattie, I...

950
01:22:27,632 --> 01:22:32,050
Oh, God, forgive me,
but I do love you, Mattie.

951
01:22:32,085 --> 01:22:36,365
I've loved you since the first
moment I laid eyes on you.

952
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:37,745
Always have.

953
01:22:40,058 --> 01:22:41,232
Jacob...

954
01:23:01,114 --> 01:23:03,668
I told you so.

955
01:23:25,069 --> 01:23:27,623
Well, Ma, Pa,

956
01:23:27,657 --> 01:23:31,040
life has had some
interesting turns.

957
01:23:31,075 --> 01:23:32,731
I married Jacob.

958
01:23:32,766 --> 01:23:35,976
He's such a ham.

959
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,047
You know that mine
he was digging?

960
01:23:38,082 --> 01:23:39,117
Well, one day...

961
01:23:39,152 --> 01:23:40,256
Whoo hoo hoo!

962
01:23:44,502 --> 01:23:47,884
Whoo hoo hoo hoo!

963
01:23:47,919 --> 01:23:49,921
Yee hoo hoo!

964
01:23:49,955 --> 01:23:53,925
Aah! Mattie! Mattie!

965
01:23:53,959 --> 01:23:56,514
He brought a big dirty rock
into my clean house

966
01:23:56,548 --> 01:23:59,172
and set it on that table,
and my table broke,

967
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:02,520
so I gave him a smack.

968
01:24:02,554 --> 01:24:06,075
But then he told me
what it was worth.

969
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:10,148
I gave him a big ol' kiss.

970
01:24:12,771 --> 01:24:16,361
But most of all,
I wanted to tell you

971
01:24:16,396 --> 01:24:18,398
that the Lord took me
out of my home

972
01:24:18,432 --> 01:24:21,194
to discover who He is.

973
01:24:21,228 --> 01:24:24,093
I've discovered that the Lord
is a present help

974
01:24:24,128 --> 01:24:26,095
in the time of need,

975
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:30,134
and that he is able to get me
to where I'm supposed to be,

976
01:24:30,168 --> 01:24:32,722
even through tragedy.

977
01:24:32,757 --> 01:24:39,488
I'll always love you Ma, Pa,
Katherine, Baby Clara.
