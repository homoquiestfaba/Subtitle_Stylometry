221
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:27,483
<i>Ha-ha, no, no, no, no.
No such thing as coincidence.</i>

222
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,067
[Madison] Dad, I'm telling
you, there's something

223
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,858
provoking him
that we're not seeing here.

224
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,317
Why else would Godzilla
flash an intimidation display

225
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,900
if there wasn't
another Titan around?

226
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:42,983
That podcast is filling
your head with garbage.

227
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:45,817
- You should be in school.
- I am just trying to help.

228
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,067
I don't want you to help.
I want you to stay safe.

229
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,067
We needed a plan to keep peace
with these things,

230
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,317
and the best one we had
just went down in flames.

231
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,983
I don't have any more.

232
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,983
And the last thing that I need
is to be worrying about you.

233
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:59,317
Godzilla saved us. You were
there with Mom. You saw it.

234
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,692
How could you doubt him?

235
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:02,358
- There has to be a pattern.
- There doesn't.

236
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,400
- A reason why he was provoked.
- There isn't.

237
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:05,692
How do you know that?

238
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,650
Because creatures,
like people, can change.

239
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:09,150
And right now,
Godzilla's out there

240
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:11,275
and he's hurting people,
and we don't know why.

241
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:13,983
So cut your pop some slack,
would ya?

242
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,525
See you at home, Dad.

243
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:23,442

245
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:27,775

<i>And add them up
and your answer is</i>

253
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:43,692
<i>that Apex is at the heart
of the problem.</i>

- [faint beep]
- [door closes]

255
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,108
Can I help you?

256
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:05,567
If you want an appointment,

257
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,067

- What the f...

259
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:12,233
Guys like you and me,

260
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:14,317
we don't do normal hours,
do we?

261
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:18,567
I've been fixated
on Hollow Earth

262
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,067
for as long as you have.

263
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,150
Your theory that it's
the birthplace of all Titans

264
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,442
is fascinating.

265
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:26,483
Your book was very impressive.

266
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:29,442
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
about 30 unsold boxes

267
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:31,108
in my apartment
if you want some.

268
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:32,275
[chuckles]

269
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:34,233
Walt Simmons.

270
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:36,108
I know who you are, sir.
It's an honor.

271
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:39,775
No, the honor is mine.
As is the urgency.

272
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:43,150
Godzilla has never attacked us
unprovoked before.

273
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,150
These are dangerous times,
Dr. Lind.

274
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,608
Allow me to introduce

275
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:51,400
our Apex chief technology
officer, Mr. Ren Serizawa.

276
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,900
He has an interesting thing
to show you.

277
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:58,942
[beeps]

278
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:03,025
Magnetic imaging from
one of our new satellites.

279
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:05,650
You know what this is, right?

280
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,067
[Nathan] Hollow Earth.

281
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,442
[Walter] An ecosystem
as vast as any ocean,

282
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:12,025
right beneath our feet.

283
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,400
This energy signal
is enormous.

284
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:21,900
And almost identical
to readings from <i>Gojira.</i>

285
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:24,233
[Walter] As our sun
fuels the planet's surface,

286
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,608
this energy sustains
the Hollow Earth,

287
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:31,400
enabling life as powerful as
our aggressive Titan friend.

288
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:34,442
If we can harness
this life force,

289
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:38,108
we'll have a weapon that can
compete with Godzilla.

290
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:40,358
I need your help to find it.

291
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:42,733
[chuckling]

292
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:46,108
I don't know if I'm
the right guy for the job.

293
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,483
Did you read the reviews?

294
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:51,525
"A sci-fi quack
trading in fringe physics."

295
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:53,150
Look where they put my office.

296
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:56,567
I'm in the basement
right across from flute class.

297
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,358
Besides, I'm not
with Monarch anymore.

298
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:01,775
And Hollow Earth entry
is impossible.

299
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:03,817
We tried.

300
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,858
I'm sorry about your brother.

301
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,858
He was a true pioneer.

302
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:13,025
Thanks.

303
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,025
[sniffles, clears throat]

304
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:19,900
See, all of our forward scans

305
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:23,275
suggest a habitable
environment down there.

306
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:29,025
So, what really went wrong
on your brother's mission?

307
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:34,525
When they tried to enter,

308
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:37,233
they hit
a gravitational inversion.

309
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,608
A whole planet's worth
of gravity

310
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,817
reversed in a split second.

311
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,567
They were crushed
in an instant.

312
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,900
What if I told you
that we, at Apex,

313
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:54,067
have created
a phenomenal craft

314
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,775
which could sustain
such an inversion?

315
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:02,025
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicle.

316
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:03,817
HEAV.

317
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,942
We can make the journey

318
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:10,317
to Hollow Earth possible,
Dr. Lind.

319
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,942
But we need you
to lead the mission.

320
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:20,817
Help me.

321
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:24,775
Help everyone.

322
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:27,275
Finding this needle
in a haystack

323
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:29,608
is our best shot
against Godzilla.

324
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,483
Well, I, uh,
might have an idea.

325
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:35,442
But it's crazy.

326
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:39,150
I love crazy ideas.
They made me rich.

327
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,150
[Nathan] Are you guys familiar
with genetic memory?

328
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:46,025
It's a theory that all Titans
share a common impulse

329
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:48,150
to return
to their evolutionary source.

330
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:49,567
Like spawning salmon.

331
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,858
Exactly. Or a...
Or a homing pigeon.

332
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:56,150
So if this is the Titans' home

333
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:58,358
and this life force
sustains them...

334
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:00,275
A Titan
could show you the way.

335
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:03,942
[Nathan] Yeah.

336
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:06,067
With a little help
of an old colleague.

337
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,067
[grunts softly]

338
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,858
[Ilene] Ugh, where is it?

339
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:44,942
[receptionist] <i>Dr. Andrews, you have
a visitor waiting for you at security.</i>

340
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,817
[in sign language]

341
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:52,858
[sighs] Okay.

342
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:04,692
[chuckles softly]

343
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:07,525
[thunder rumbles]

344
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:09,692
[Ilene] A power source
in Hollow Earth?

345
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,983
This sounds nuts, Nathan,
even for you.

346
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,983
[Nathan] It's there! We just
need Kong to bring us to it!

347
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:17,567
[Ilene] The second you take
Kong out of containment,

348
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,108
Godzilla's gonna come for him.

on a global scale</i>

525
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:44,233
<i>and Apex is invincible.</i>

526
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:46,025
We've been listening
to this weirdo for hours.

527
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:47,942
- [Madison] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [tires screech]

528
00:30:48,025 --> 00:30:50,108
Whoa! Knock it off!

529
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:52,025
Wait, this is the part
I was telling you about.

530
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:54,067
[Bernie] <i>...need special UV to
even know you've been marked!</i>

531
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,733
<i>One or two gallons
won't cut it.</i>

532
00:30:55,817 --> 00:30:58,525
<i>I need my bleach in bulk!</i>

533
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:00,650
<i>Because spy dust
is real, people!</i>

534
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,358
<i>I mean, come on,
invisible to the naked eye...</i>

535
00:31:02,442 --> 00:31:04,067
- [turns off stereo]
- That's how we find him.

536
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,067
- The bleach.
- Bleach?

537
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,067
He consumes a ton of bleach.

538
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,608
He drinks bleach?

539
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,025
Showers with it.

540
00:31:12,108 --> 00:31:14,900
Oh! Yeah, I shower
with bleach. No, what?

541
00:31:14,983 --> 00:31:17,858
Prevention against
organic tracking technology.

542
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,358
See? Tradecraft.

543
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:23,025
Would've made more sense
if he just drank it.

544
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:30,567
[Madison] Come on,
just one more place.

545
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,150
Madison, this is getting old.

546
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:35,525
Hey, you sell bleach?

547
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:37,733
Is this another one of those
Internet challenge things?

548
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:39,525
When I sold those kids
those detergent pods,

549
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:41,233
I didn't know
they were gonna eat them.

550
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,567
I'm still dealing
with the lawsuits from that.

551
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,983
Look, we're looking for a guy

552
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:46,567
who works
for Apex Cybernetics.

553
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,483
Buys a lot of bleach.
Like every night.

554
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:50,942
He's probably paranoid,

555
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:53,233
high-strung,
doesn't like daylight.

556
00:31:53,317 --> 00:31:55,358
You know, has a lot of crumbs
in his beard,

557
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:56,567
if he has a beard.

558
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,192
Okay, look,
you kids want some candy?

559
00:31:58,275 --> 00:31:59,942
Because I can help you
with candy.

560
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:03,275
Look at me in the eye. Okay?
I need information.

561
00:32:03,358 --> 00:32:04,775
Yeah, we want lots of candy.

562
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:08,150
What are you doing?
You think...?

563
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:11,525
Oh, you mean Bernie.

564
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:13,525
Yeah, I know that guy.

565
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:15,150
He buys,
like, a ton of bleach.

566
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,650
I know where he is, too.

567
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:18,942
If you buy a live fish,
I'll give you his address.

568
00:32:19,525 --> 00:32:20,983
[banging on door]

569
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,650
[Madison] Bernie?

570
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,275
[Bernie] Mister...
[clears throat] Mis...

571
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:26,608
- [thud]
- [Bernie groans]

572
00:32:26,692 --> 00:32:28,025
[in deep voice]
Mister Bernie not home.

573
00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:29,400
Yep, that was
definitely Mister Bernie.

574
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:30,900
Yeah. Um...

575
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:35,275
Hi! Hi. Listen, we wanna talk
about Apex and Godzilla.

576
00:32:35,358 --> 00:32:37,400
[Bernie] No. No. No.

577
00:32:37,483 --> 00:32:41,275
I... I got your faces.
I contact authorities. Yes.

578
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:42,483
[Josh] For knocking on a door?

579
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:43,775
[Bernie chuckles] No. No.

580
00:32:43,858 --> 00:32:45,942
Bernie, you don't trust
the authorities.

581
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:47,942
My name is Madison Russell.

582
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:50,983
My father works for Monarch
and my mother was...

583
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:53,192
Emma Russell, right?

584
00:32:54,817 --> 00:32:57,900
<i>Before we go any farther,
I got one question.</i>

585
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:00,192
Tap or no tap?

586
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:01,817
No tap.

587
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,233
- Excuse me, what is "tap"?
- Water.

588
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,525
They put fluoride in it.
Learned it from the Nazis.

589
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:09,358
Theory is it makes you docile,
easy to manipulate.

590
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:11,067
Oh, I drink tap water.

591
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:13,442
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

592
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,025
But she does the thinking
for both of you,

593
00:33:15,108 --> 00:33:16,983
so it should be all right.

594
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:18,900
- Thanks.
- Okay.

595
00:33:18,983 --> 00:33:20,108
What you got?

596
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,442
I believe Godzilla's
most recent attacks

597
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:24,775
haven't just been random.

598
00:33:24,858 --> 00:33:26,775
I think he targeted
the Apex facility.

599
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:28,317
I'm of the same opinion.

600
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,733
But why? What is Apex up to
that's provoking him?

601
00:33:30,817 --> 00:33:33,358
For five years, I embedded
myself inside this company,

602
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:35,525
trying to figure out
what their game was.

603
00:33:35,608 --> 00:33:38,108
Then, last week...

604
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:39,317
I saw this.

605
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,692
A manifest of huge cargo
being sent from here

606
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:45,192
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong,

607
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:46,650
which makes no sense

608
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,567
because we are not equipped
for heavy shipping.

609
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,900
- Then what?
- And then boom!

610
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:51,692
Godzilla shows up.

611
00:33:51,775 --> 00:33:53,192
Caved in half the facility,

612
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:55,025
but I got a sneak peek
at some suspicious tech

613
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:56,692
which was hidden
in a secret bunker.

614
00:33:56,775 --> 00:33:58,733
I mean, some pretty
damn suspicious tech.

615
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:01,025
Yeah, but what is that?

616
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:06,358
That's, um...

617
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:10,150
That's Katzunari
single malt whiskey.

618
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:12,525
Yeah, but it's
in a gun holster.

619
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,608
It was a gift from my Sara.

620
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:15,775
You have a Sara?

621
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:17,400
She was my wife.

622
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:19,567
Um, she passed on.

623
00:34:21,942 --> 00:34:23,067
[Bernie sighs]

624
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,775
She was my rock.

625
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:27,192
My truth.

626
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:30,317
I'll tell you something,
the day that this goes empty,

627
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,358
that's the day
you know I've given up.

628
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:39,192
[Madison] Bernie.

629
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,067
I think we can
help each other.

630
00:34:44,942 --> 00:34:47,442
Okay, I guess
now that we're a team,

631
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:49,900
I feel like we should
come up with a plan.

632
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:51,275
We're breaking into Apex.

633
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:53,483
- [Josh] Wait, what?
- [Bernie] You heard her.

634
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:55,275
Tap water.

635
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:56,817
Shit.

636
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:04,067
[groans]

637
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:13,275
[grunts contentedly]

638
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:27,983
[Ilene] Hey.

639
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:33,358
[in sign language]

640
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:10,317
Thank you.

641
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:13,275
How is she?

642
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,358
Calm. So calm, it's scary.
[chuckles]

643
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:18,525
That was extraordinary.

644
00:36:18,608 --> 00:36:22,358
I have been signing
the alphabet. Basic commands.

645
00:36:22,442 --> 00:36:24,983
I thought that he showed
recognition, but he never...

646
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:27,983
Do you have any idea how long
they've been communicating?

647
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:29,358
No.

648
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:31,567
I knew that they had a bond.

649
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,108
He trusts her.

650
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:35,400
Without her, he'd be
tearing the ship apart.

651
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:40,192
You know, Jia's parents
were killed on the island.

652
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:42,400
When the storm
took over the island,

653
00:36:42,483 --> 00:36:44,233
it wiped out
the native people.

654
00:36:44,317 --> 00:36:45,692
But Kong saved her.

655
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:47,858
She had nowhere to go.

656
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:49,358
So I made a promise,

657
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:51,942
then and there,
to protect her.

658
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:56,192
And I think that in some way,
he did the same.

659
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,400
Do you think he would take
directions from her?

660
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,983
No.

661
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:06,733
If we have someone who can
keep the reins on Kong...

662
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:09,025
Yeah, no one can keep
the reins on Kong.

663
00:37:10,442 --> 00:37:12,108
And she's a child.

664
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,358
[distant, muffled pulsing]

665
00:37:33,858 --> 00:37:35,983
[muffled groaning]

666
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:43,442
[Nathan] I know
Jia is only a child.

667
00:37:43,525 --> 00:37:47,442
But she's the only one
he'll communicate with.

668
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:50,567
<i>And we need Kong
to find that power source.</i>

669
00:37:52,192 --> 00:37:54,275
The world needs him.

670
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,858
[alarm blaring]

671
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,567
[muffled moaning]

672
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:05,317
[indistinct shouting]

673
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:08,983
What's she saying?

674
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:10,192
Godzilla.

675
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:12,650
[roaring]

676
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:16,233
[urgent chatter]

677
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:19,733
- [Kong grunts]
- [metal clangs]

678
00:38:19,817 --> 00:38:21,150
Did we change course?

679
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,025
No. We're nowhere near
the areas you flagged.

680
00:38:23,108 --> 00:38:25,025
It looks like
he's coming for us anyway.

681
00:38:25,108 --> 00:38:26,317
[Ilene] He's not coming for us.

682
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,692
Him? Then dump him.
Dump the monkey!

683
00:38:28,775 --> 00:38:30,983
How about we throw you off
instead, huh?

684
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:32,900
[roars]

685
00:38:32,983 --> 00:38:34,150
We have to release him.

686
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:35,733
If we lose Kong,
the mission is over.

687
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:37,108
He's a sitting duck out there.

688
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:39,150
We have to let him
protect himself. And us.

689
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,067
[weapons firing]

690
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:43,067
[roars]

691
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:09,233

696

[roaring]

697

All of it.

733
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:57,275
Guns, engines.

734
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,317
- Shut it down. Right now.
- If we do that, we're dead.

735

No, we're playing dead.

736

How are we supposed
to get the rest of the way?

747

How's Kong with heights?

748
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:44,358
So, what's the plan?

749
00:47:44,442 --> 00:47:47,067
[Bernie] We find out
what's on Sublevel 33.

- [bottle clinks]
- [Josh] Ow.

we can trust this guy?

Yeah, why?

759
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,733
Well, mainly because he says
crazy shit all the time

760
00:48:15,817 --> 00:48:17,108

a bottle of whiskey

761

You believe me, right?

777

'Cause I know that
there was something here.
