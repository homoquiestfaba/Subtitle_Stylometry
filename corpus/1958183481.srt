1
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,623
- Boss.

2
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,773
- Was out in north end,
been looking for Tommy.

3
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,603
You seen him?

4
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,060
- Not today.

5
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,003
- Yesterday?

6
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,230
- I don't see him every day.

7
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,783
- I ain't seen him in three.

8
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,813
Can't carry him no more Sean.

9
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,370
- How do you mean?

10
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,730
- Shit son, don't make this
tougher than it needs to be.

11
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,703
- He'll show Boss.

12
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,593
- Ain't about that no more.

13
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,343
You're a good boy Sean,

14
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,091
but Tommy ain't worth shootin'.

15
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,170
- He'll be here tomorrow, he'll be here.

16
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,793

- He'll show Boss.

17
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,143

00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:39,383
- I ain't payin' no extra time.

20
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:40,216
- Yep.

21
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,745
You seen Tommy?

22
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:28,745

- Uh, come on in.

26
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:30,870
- Is Tommy around?

27
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,583
He said he was
staying at the ranch.

28
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,780
- Yeah no I thought maybe he'd
just stopped by to see Em.

29
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,507
- Well he uh, he usually
calls around 6:00.

30
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,260
- All right, will you
tell him I stopped by.

31
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,620
Everything okay?

32
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,840
- Yeah no, I won't take
up all of your time Mag.

33
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,760
- Come on, can't stay a bit?

34
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,340
- Yeah, you know what, I
should be gettin' on home.

35
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,823
Em would love to see you.

36
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,020
Come on, Em, your uncle's here.

61
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,573
He ain't in any trouble, Tommy?

126
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,920
- Yes sir, I guess I forgot.

127
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,870
You're a real boy scout, ain't you Sean?

131
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,710
- My own brother,

00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,930
a God damn.
- Everything's a fucking joke.

133
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,700
- Certifiable shit-kickin' stereotype.

134
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,350
Yee-haw mother fuckers.

135
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,600
- It's too late for this
shit Tommy, come on.

138
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:34,057
- Watch it, get outta here.

How much trouble you in anyway?

146
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,340
- Nothing I can't handle little brother.

147
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:31,571
Nighty night.

148
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:34,516
- Nighty night.

149
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:14,526

00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,339
Biscuits in the oven.

154
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,339
- All right.

155
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,613
You see Tommy?

156
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,373
- He left.

157
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,280
Walked on up the road, half naked.

158
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,680
Boy never did have no sense.

159
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,063
He in trouble again?

160
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,493
- He didn't wanna see ya.

161
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:50,573
- He's a shit.

162
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:53,580
- He's just stubborn.

163
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,796
- No, you're stubborn, he's a shit.

164
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,046
Just like your daddy was.

165
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,163
- Mike, come on man, this is
Eddie talking to you here.

166
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:04,871
All right, Rusty, can
you turn that shit down.

167
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:07,023
Mm-hmm, that's what I'm saying.

168
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,290
These things take time.

169
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,733
No, okay when?

170
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,533
Nuh-uh, I can't do that.

171
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:19,522
Well it's too soon.

172
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,610
I told you they got stopped.

173
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,863
Mike, Mike, Mike, I know
it's not your problem.

174
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:30,840
All right fine, I'm gonna take care of it,

175
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,333

176
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:35,726
Okay.

177
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,168
Call 'em in.

178
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:46,536
- Which ones?

179
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:47,820
- All of 'em.

180
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,420

181
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,420

182
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,654
Jesus, how long you

183
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,240
- Sean said you've been looking for me.

184
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,720
- I shoulda fired you a long time ago.

185
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,363
- Oh come on now Boss.

186
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,390
- Listen, I'd appreciate it
if you cleaned up your tools

187
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,963
before you left, but I
ain't paying you to pack.

188
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,453
- Wait Boss come on, hold up.

189
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,050
What am I supposed to tell Margaret?

190
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,593
And Emily, what do I tell her?

191
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,750
- You can tell that little
girl I'm truly sorry

192
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,503
she got stuck with you for a daddy Tommy.

193
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,250
- You are a sack of green shit Boss.

194
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,910
- Yep.

195
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,920
Don't make me call the sheriff Tommy.

196
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,324
- Hey, hey, come on now Boss.

197
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:01,018
Come on Boss, you know I need this.

198
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:02,580
Hey Boss!

199
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,413
Hey!

200
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:09,750
Boss, Boss God damnit, come on.

201
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,810
I'm sorry Boss.

202
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,580
Shit Boss, come on.

203
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,600
Boss, I'm sorry, Boss,
come on, I'm sorry, Boss.

204
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,773
Please Boss, I'm sorry.

205
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,443
- Tom.

206
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:55,160
That heifer's about to calf.

207
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,770
- She's early.

208
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,070
- Come on, grab the truck.

209
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:11,835
No, something's wrong.

210
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:15,580
Yeah, hold on, hold on.

211
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,546
You got it.

212
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:19,899
Shit, you don't die yet.

213
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:21,226
- We gotta get her out.

214
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:25,649
- All right, her third push, ready?

215
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:26,510
- Yep.

216
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:31,135
- Go.

217
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:36,784
One more, come on.

218
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,169
Come on girl.

219
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:39,169
Come on now.

220
00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:41,799
Go.

221
00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:47,567
One more time.

222
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,067
Yeah, all right push.

223
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:51,968
Clear the throat.

224
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:54,224
- All right.
- Here pup, hold on.

225
00:19:58,518 --> 00:19:59,601
- Oh come on.

226
00:20:01,295 --> 00:20:02,128
All right, here we go.

227
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:02,961
Not ready, keep going.

228
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,657
- God damnit.

229
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,013
She's gone.

230
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,560
- Oh Boss is gonna be pissed.

231
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,393
Shit.

232
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,610
Go and get the kid.

233
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:21,481
That can wait.

234
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,097
Go get the kid Tom.

235
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,519
- God damnit.

236
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,763
- Shit.

237
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,843
Oh no, no, no way.

238
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:43,480
- It's your turn Tom.

239
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,430
- Go on, you do it.

240
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,683
- Quit being lazy, come on.

241
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:08,190
Come on Tom, just get it started.

242
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,708
I wanna go home.

243
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,563
Tom.

244
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,629
Tommy.

245
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:33,436
Give it here.

246
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,480
How much trouble you in?

247
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,803
- Six large.

248
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,483
- Jesus Tommy.

249
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,363
Now, what do you wanna do,
you wanna go to the cops?

250
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,283
- Won't do no good.

251
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,850
I don't know what to do.

252
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,180
They're gonna kill me Sean.

253
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:48,057
Shh, there you go.

254
00:22:57,773 --> 00:22:59,561
All right, there you go.

255
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:01,061
Shh, there you go.

256
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,643
Who is it?

257
00:23:16,557 --> 00:23:17,390
Who?

258
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,943
- Guy's name's Eddie.

259
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,913
Eddie Obregon.

260
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,620
A mechanic or something, I don't know.

261
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,603
He's Army.

262
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,180
- Corpus?

263
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,013
- Yeah.

264
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,173
- Don said there's two guys at the bar.

265
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:40,260
Who's the,

266
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,333
who's the kid?

267
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,813
- Rusty,

268
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,080
something I don't,

269
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,793
I didn't ask for ID.

270
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,883
So now what?

271
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,903
- Go home.

272
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,813
I'll pick you up in the morning.

273
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,953
- Sean.

274
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,913
- Yeah?

275
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:21,253
- Lend me a couple bucks?

276
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:36,164
- All right Emily, let's go.

277
00:24:39,623 --> 00:24:40,706
Come on babe.

278
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:44,900
Come on baby.

279
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,870
- No.

280
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,040
- Please, it'll just be a few hours.

281
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,180
- You're two months behind on your rent.

282
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,180
- And how am I supposed to find
another job sittin' at home?

283
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,550
- Fine, but this is the last time.

284
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,383
- Thank you.

285
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,960
All right babe, Miss
Carol's gonna watch you

286
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,920

287
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,750
- When will you be back?

288
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,720
- Real soon, I promise.

289
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,400

290
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,800

00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
- Be a good girl Em.

292
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,400
I need to borrow your car.

293
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:50,928
- $62.82.

294
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,649
Can you take off the chips?

295
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,950
And I don't need all those apples.

296
00:26:06,517 --> 00:26:07,699
- $56.38.

297
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,063
- Margaret.

298
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,523
Daddy's home.

299
00:26:42,218 --> 00:26:43,885
- Mm, oh yes, daddy.

300
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,240
Hey, baby boy.

301
00:26:50,934 --> 00:26:52,990
- That washer's been acting up.

302
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,990
- I'll see about it.

303
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,769
Thank you.

304
00:26:56,769 --> 00:26:57,602
- Hey.

305
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:30,866
- Mike.

306
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,559
- You got my shit?

307
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,453
Eddie,

308
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,400

- Sure?

311
00:28:03,644 --> 00:28:05,302
Look, I like you a lot Eddie.

312
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:06,984
I really do, I really
think you're a good kid.

313
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:08,651
Mike, I...

314
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,720
- I'm not coming back over here Eddie.

315
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:22,460
I give you two days.

316
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,293
Two.

317
00:29:09,977 --> 00:29:12,144
- I know you ain't got it,

318
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:15,562
but I need it.

319
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,703
- When?

320
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,833
Tonight.

321
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,053
- I can't do it.

322
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,433
- Uh, that ain't gonna work,

323
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,105
and you know it.

324
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,453
- Okay, where do I bring it?

325
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
- I'll pick it up at your place.

326
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,200
How's that sound?

327
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:11,034
You okay?

328
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:11,867
- Yeah.

329
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,879
- Wanna talk about it?

330
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,393
- No.

331
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,033
He's not your problem.

332
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,433
- Yeah, I know.

333
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:33,217
Then why?

334
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,293
- He's family.

335
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,800
- We're your family.

336
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,693
- I know you are.

337
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,813
- Then?

338
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,360
Where are you going?

339
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,840
I'm just going to see about that washer.

340
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,673
- Sean.

341
00:30:56,673 --> 00:30:57,506
- No hey.

342
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,623
- Talk to me.

343
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,463
He's a screw up.

344
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,353
- I know he is.

345
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,086
Tommy's a hell of a lot better than dad.

346
00:31:15,086 --> 00:31:16,386
A lot better than mom was.

347
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:18,394
You know?

348
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,773
He took care of me baby.

349
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,670
You know, sometimes he was the only one.

350
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:36,923
And uh,

351
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,200
I don't know.

352
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,330
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Tommy.

353
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,633
Screw up or not, he's my brother.

354
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,320
I'm going.

355
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,553
See about that washer.

356
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,610
- You got something you wanna say to me?

357
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,013
- Nope.

358
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,723
Sean.

359
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,233
Your brother's here.

360
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,073
- Yeah, I heard.

361
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:29,353
Why you always gotta piss her off?

362
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:15,353
Who is this guy?

363
00:36:15,353 --> 00:36:16,563
- Give me a minute.

364
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,063
- Why?

365
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,863
Tom.

366
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:34,559
You know, I got held up.

367
00:36:35,603 --> 00:36:37,877
Where were you?

368
00:36:40,848 --> 00:36:44,181
Still got ya, let's
go and take a drive.

369
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:48,711
I'll stay here.

370
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,253
- Get in the fucking truck man, let's go.

371
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:58,168
Get back in the truck.

372
00:36:58,168 --> 00:36:59,237
Is there a problem?

373
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,630
- Get back in your truck.

374
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,003
- Tom.

375
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,200
- Oh you just stepped in it boy.

376
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,849
This ain't none of your business.

377
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,233
Get.

378
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,647
What you trying to uh,

379
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:42,670
you trying to bring a little muscle

380
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,870
with you this time, huh?

381
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,218
You trying to muscle
me around now boy, huh?

382
00:37:49,218 --> 00:37:50,818
That ain't gonna play, let's go.

383
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,540
You're just making
it hard on your...

384
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,373
Don't.

385
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,463
- You're making a mistake here boy.

386
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,810
- Tommy, you get that pistol.

387
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,890
You got something to
say to me or my brother

388
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,040
I reckon now's about
time to say it mister.

389
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,577
- Now don't say you weren't warned.

390
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,100
- I appreciate it.

391
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,010
Get outta here.

392
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,573
- You know where to find me.

393
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:12,960
- Boss.

394
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:19,012
- Sit.

395
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:21,754
- Thank you.

396
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:23,337
- What do you need?

397
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:29,854
Just say it son.

398
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,543
- I need a loan.

399
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,850
How much?

400
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,130
Six thousand.

401
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,093
- Damn Sean.

402
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,170
- I'll pay it back to you
Boss, you know I will.

403
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,150
- Boy I don't doubt that for a second.

404
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,653
I just don't have six
thousand laying around.

405
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,993
- Yeah.

406
00:40:03,993 --> 00:40:05,763
Shit Sean, I wish I could.

407
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,530
- And Mr. Reed?

408
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,783
- Mr. Reed what?

409
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,190
- He got that kinda money laying around?

410
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,500
- Damn boy use your head.

411
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,910
Reed likes you, and that'll mean something

412
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,290
after I'm not around, don't mess that up

413
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,490
by bringing him into it.

414
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,070
Into Tommy's shit.

415
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,870
- I never said anything about Tommy.

416
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,960
I don't know
what he done this time

417
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,653
but it ain't your business Sean.

418
00:40:40,968 --> 00:40:42,953
And it sure as hell ain't Mr. Reed's.

419
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,763
Yeah.

420
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,950
- You can't carry him Sean.

421
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,263
- He's family Boss.

422
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,533
- You think that means shit to him?

423
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,973
You think he'd be in here
doing the same for you?

424
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:15,051
- Boss.

425
00:41:24,425 --> 00:41:25,258
- What'd he say?

426
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:26,091
- He said no.

427
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,183
- Shit.

428
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,063
Reed?

429
00:41:30,063 --> 00:41:31,530
- No.

430
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,655
- So what are we supposed to do?

431
00:41:33,655 --> 00:41:34,753
I don't know.

432
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,810
Hey Eddie.

433
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,092
- Did you get it?

434
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,213
- I got a little problem.

435
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,843
- What do you mean we got a problem?

436
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,770
- I ran into old Tommy and

437
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,040
he's carrying some--

438
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,743
- No, I don't pay you to talk Rusty.

439
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,523
Just handle it.

440
00:42:29,277 --> 00:42:30,694
- What are you doing?

441
00:42:30,694 --> 00:42:32,143
- Just give me a sec.

442
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,763
The first 18 months

443
00:42:49,763 --> 00:42:52,700
of a cub's life are very important.

444
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,048
Many lessons must be learned.

445
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,293
- Go away.

446
00:43:05,293 --> 00:43:07,317
The female
siblings are solitary

447
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:10,196
Wes.

448
00:43:10,196 --> 00:43:11,320
The young males however,

449
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,579
remain together for life.

450
00:43:13,412 --> 00:43:14,363
Gonzo, hey.

451
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:22,563
- Sergeant?

452
00:43:22,563 --> 00:43:23,396
- Hey Gonzo.

453
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:26,104
- Damn, man.

454
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,567
Come in, come in.
- Thanks.

455
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:40,104
You want some water.

456
00:43:40,104 --> 00:43:41,204
No I can't stay.

457
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,787
- All right, I'll get you some.

458
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:53,640
- How are you doing Gonz?

459
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,590
- Still can't sleep.

460
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,130
Mortars keep going off in my head.

461
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,445
Oh get up from there man, it's filthy.

462
00:43:59,445 --> 00:44:01,362
Come on, sit down here.

463
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,733
How's the uh, how's the baby?

464
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:09,380
- He's good.

465
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,383
- Yeah, good.

466
00:44:11,787 --> 00:44:14,710
Good man, I'm happy as shit man.

467
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,593
- But listen Wes.

468
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,580
Who do you know down at the depot?

469
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,246
- Corpus?
- Yeah.

470
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:25,603
- Uh, couple grunts, why?

471
00:44:27,911 --> 00:44:29,850
- I need you to make a couple calls,

472
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,123
guy by the name of Obregon, Eddie.

473
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,833
- Anything.

474
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,713
Do I ask why?

475
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,573
- No.

476
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,550
- You in trouble Sarge?

477
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,400
- I might have done something stupid.

478
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:49,800
Pissed off a guy that works
for him, he's ex military.

479
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,633
- You need me?

480
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:52,873
- I need six grand.

481
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:55,257
- Fuck.

482
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,737
Sarge, I don't got much.

483
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,470
- No, no, no, no,

484
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:03,033
don't worry about that,
just make the calls, yeah?

485
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,140
- Yeah.

486
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,190
I'll take care of it.

487
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:10,063
Yeah.

488
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,690
- Oh listen, I'm sorry I can't stay.

489
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,013
- Oh yeah.

490
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,630
- Come out to the house sometime.

491
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:22,603
- I don't know Sarge.

492
00:45:22,603 --> 00:45:23,573
I'm pretty fucked up.
- No, no man.

493
00:45:23,573 --> 00:45:25,723
You can come out, you
can stay the weekend.

494
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,383
- Sure, sure.

495
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,313
All right Gonzo.

496
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,030
- Hold on one second.

497
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:52,301
There's no serial.

498
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,000
If you need the money,
we'll get the money.

499
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,833
- It's nothing--

500
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:01,313
- No Sarge, you need
money we'll get money.

501
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,640
- You come out to the house.

502
00:46:10,037 --> 00:46:10,870
- Sure.

503
00:46:12,694 --> 00:46:13,844
Hey take it easy Sarge.

504
00:46:26,637 --> 00:46:27,804
- What's that?

505
00:46:33,816 --> 00:46:35,066
- It's nothing.

506
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,137
- Did you ever think about leaving?

507
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,613
- I did leave.

508
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,573
- Yeah, that's right.

509
00:47:02,976 --> 00:47:04,726
Hey what was it like?

510
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:06,923
Over there?

511
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:13,583
- It sucked.

512
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:16,350
I'm gonna go call Claudia,

513
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,200
make sure she doesn't divorce my ass.

514
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,063
Pay the bill, yeah?

515
00:47:27,727 --> 00:47:28,560
- Oh, uh,

516
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,073
my brother's gonna pick
that up when he comes back.

517
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,093
What do I get for dessert?

518
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,233
- Claudia?

519
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,090
- Left a message.

520
00:48:02,343 --> 00:48:03,463
You okay for this?

521
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,123
- Yes sir.

522
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,533
- Step on up boys, lemme
get hands-on with ya.

523
00:48:21,373 --> 00:48:22,213
He's good.

524
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,970
About you Tommy huh, you
got an iron in your pocket?

525
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,670
- Get your fucking hands off me.

526
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:28,503
- Tommy.

527
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,900
Better have brought my
money you fucking cunt.

528
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,390
- Eddie baby, I told you we were gonna

529
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:37,370
get this all straightened out.

530
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,593
No fuck you
Tommy, where my money at?

531
00:48:47,894 --> 00:48:49,750
This the tough guy?

532
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:50,583
- There he is.

533
00:48:54,261 --> 00:48:55,261
- You serve?

534
00:48:57,508 --> 00:48:58,341
Iraq?

535
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:00,677
- Afghanistan.

536
00:49:08,018 --> 00:49:10,268
- You think that means
something around here?

537
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,670
- I just wanna make this right.

538
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:17,003
- Six thousand will make
it just right, hero.

539
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:21,373
- Ah well, we don't have six thousand.

540
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:28,740
- All right well.

541
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,073
That's gonna be a problem now isn't it?

542
00:49:34,366 --> 00:49:35,930
- I have two hundred right now.

543
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,470
Just a courtesy, get us started.

544
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:41,064
Tommy's gonna drive over
three hundred every other week

545
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:42,150
'til it's paid in full.

546
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,000
- How about this.

547
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,920
How about I take that two hundred,

548
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,870
and the fifty-eight hundred you owe me,

549
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,390
and I will consider letting you walk

550
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,640
the fuck out that door.

551
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,130
- You don't talk to my brother like that.

552
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:55,963
- Tom.

553
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,870
We're gonna get you your money.

554
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:02,130
- I got no doubt about that hero.

555
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:04,670
- You don't talk to my fucking
brother like that Eddie.

556
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:05,503
- Tommy.

557
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,600
Should I just kill you
now, get it over with?

558
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,270
- Listen.
- What'd you say?

559
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:12,040
- Talk to me, not to him.

560
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,320
I'm gonna bring you four hundred myself,

561
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,823
every Friday, every week.

562
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,890
- Is this a joke?

563
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:23,843
- I'm giggling.

564
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,450
- This is a joke
- I ain't joking.

565
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:29,283
- You're kidding me, right.

566
00:50:29,283 --> 00:50:31,530
You're dumb fucking brother
put you up to this.

567
00:50:36,303 --> 00:50:38,673
Well I'm done playing now hero.

568
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:43,410
Tell him he ain't walking
the fuck outta here

569
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:44,713
until I get paid.

570
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,300
What else you think was gonna happen?

571
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,943
Pay me my fucking money!

572
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:53,163
- Watch out.

573
00:50:53,163 --> 00:50:54,343
Tom, Tommy.

574
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,420
- Keep laughing Eddie.

575
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,570
- You're dead.
- Shut up.

576
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,156
- Listen, Tommy.
- Get back.

577
00:51:07,156 --> 00:51:08,756
- Put the gun down.
- Get back!

578
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:13,723
You're a mechanic Eddie.

579
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,424
What the fuck is it you
think you're gonna do to me?

580
00:51:18,424 --> 00:51:20,153
You're a joke.

581
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,423
You're a fucking joke!

582
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:26,713
Why do you think I took your
money in the first place?

583
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:33,793
Start the car Sean.

584
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,370
- Tom.
- Start the car!

585
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:39,150
- Don't you walk outta here Tommy.

586
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:40,650
- You'll get your money Eddie.

587
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,260
You'll get your money when I get it!

588
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,240
Until then, I see you, you come after me.

589
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,003
I smell your shitty cologne,

590
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,350
I'll kill ya Eddie.

591
00:51:54,455 --> 00:51:55,288
You hear me?

592
00:51:56,336 --> 00:51:57,436
I'll fucking kill you.

593
00:52:08,278 --> 00:52:09,445

00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:12,807

00:52:12,807 --> 00:52:14,533
- What the hell was that?

00:52:29,033 --> 00:52:31,616

598
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:34,196

00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,905
Let 'em go.

600
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,876
I know where he lives.

601
00:52:43,876 --> 00:52:45,877
- Of all the stupid shit you do.

602
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,613
I coulda handled that Tommy.

603
00:52:48,613 --> 00:52:50,700
What the hell are you laughing for?

604
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,533
Pull over.

605
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,410
Pull.
- Hey Jesus, quit it.

606
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:55,725
- Pull over!

607
00:53:01,048 --> 00:53:02,298
-What?

608
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,130
- Give me that fucking gun.

609
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,618
Tommy what, give me that gun.

610
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:09,026
- Hey.

611
00:53:09,026 --> 00:53:10,526
- Give me the gun.

612
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,523
Jesus Christ.

613
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,090
They know where you live?

614
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,980
Tommy, do they know where you live?

615
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:23,003
Jesus, get in the truck.

616
00:53:23,003 --> 00:53:24,330
Get in the truck.

617
00:53:27,253 --> 00:53:28,795
Get in the truck!

618
00:53:39,018 --> 00:53:39,893

Hey kid.

You wanna come and stay

622
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:46,130
- Where's mom?

623
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,180
- She's coming too darling.

624
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,080
- Where's your jacket, ah, here we go.

625
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,407
What's that doll's name again?

626
00:53:53,407 --> 00:53:55,048
- McKenzie.
- McKenzie.

627
00:53:55,048 --> 00:53:56,460
Do you think McKenzie will
wanna come with us too?

628
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,540
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

629
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,303
You grab ahold of her.

630
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:00,792
You come here.

631
00:54:00,792 --> 00:54:02,813
All right monkey girl, let's roll.

632
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,943
- Come on Tommy, just come with us.

633
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:11,603
Will you at least tell me
what the fuck's going on?

634
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:15,360
- She can ride with me.
- Mommy?

635
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,470
- Yeah baby, it's okay,
you go with Uncle Sean.

636
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:19,962
I'll be right behind you, okay?

637
00:54:19,962 --> 00:54:20,962
- All right.

638
00:54:23,703 --> 00:54:24,960
- You're a real piece of shit Tommy.

639
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,473
- Yeah, you made that clear.

640
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,383
- You be good for your uncle, okay buddy?

641
00:54:31,383 --> 00:54:32,633
- I will buddy.

642
00:54:32,633 --> 00:54:34,213
- What do I say to Boss?

643
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,500
- Tell him I'm gonna be late.

644
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:40,323
- Where am I supposed to say you went?

645
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,360
- Figure it out Tom.

646
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,689
- Daddy loves you buddy, you know?

647
00:54:49,689 --> 00:54:51,278
- I know buddy.

648
00:54:51,278 --> 00:54:52,111
- Okay.

649
00:55:04,777 --> 00:55:06,123
- Are you coming or not?

650
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,233
It's always about you Tommy.

651
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,832
- I'm sorry Mag, it ain't much.

652
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,350
- It's perfect.

653
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,183
- Tommy?

654
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,313
- Stayed.

655
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,720
- You need anything?

656
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,020
- We're okay.

657
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,230
Thanks Sean.

658
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:48,170
- I'm right in the other room.

659
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,003
- All right.

660
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:53,688
- [Claudia} What's going on?

661
00:55:53,688 --> 00:55:54,521
You woke up the baby.

662
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:57,720
- I'm sorry, nothing, Margaret
and Emily are on the couch.

663
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,553
Why?

664
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,603
- Let's just talk about it in the morning.

665
00:56:03,413 --> 00:56:04,463
Come to bed baby.

666
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:06,453
Good morning.

667
00:57:07,428 --> 00:57:08,428
Where's mom?

668
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,173
- Protesting.

669
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,413
Where's Tommy?

670
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:18,360
- He's the original asshole Claudia.

671
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,440
- No argument here.

672
00:57:22,854 --> 00:57:23,750
- Can we please talk about this

673
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,100
when his only daughter's
not in the other room.

674
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,710
- How much trouble is he in Sean?

675
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:35,470
- Well, it ain't good.

676
00:57:36,684 --> 00:57:38,920
It ain't as bad as all
that, but it ain't good.

677
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,043
Is he gonna be okay?

678
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:01,503
- Help you hun?

679
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,280
- Yes m'am, my name's Sean Donnelly.

680
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,730
I work for Mr. Reed down at the ranch.

681
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:09,900
I was hoping to have a word.

682
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,103
- Mr. Reed's not in yet.

683
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,773
- I'll wait.

684
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,133
- You ever play?

685
00:58:22,623 --> 00:58:23,910
- I'm sorry.

686
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,370
- On the computer?

687
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,203
- No m'am.

688
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:28,303
- Don't start.

689
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,380
- Whitney Madine, get
off that damn Solitaire.

690
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,250
- Sean Donnelly's here to see you.

691
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,083
- Who?

692
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:51,810
- He works at the ranch.

693
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:53,150
- Hello sir.

694
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,740
- Oh of course, Sean.

695
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,640
How are ya?

696
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,480
- All right.

697
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,760
- Everything okay at the ranch?

698
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,890
Did Boss send ya?

699
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,040
- No everything's fine.

700
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:02,183
- All right.

701
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,907
Well come on back.

702
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:06,240
- Thank you sir.

703
00:59:16,613 --> 00:59:18,313
- What can I do for you Sean?

704
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,880
- Sir I was talking to Boss.

705
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,713
- Uh-huh.

706
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:24,803
- And uh,

707
00:59:28,579 --> 00:59:30,127
this ain't easy for me to ask.

708
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,063
I'm in a bad way.

709
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:36,493
I could use a hand.

710
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,150
- Well I see that.

711
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:42,793
But specifically Sean, what
is it I can do for you?

712
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:46,323
- A loan.

713
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,663
- Uh-huh, and Boss sent you?

714
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,903
- No sir, I didn't mean to, nah.

715
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,990
He said it would be
better if I didn't ask.

716
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:07,270
- Well son, Boss about
had the right of it.

717
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,080
- I know sir, I understand, and I

718
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,113
hate asking, I can't even tell ya.

719
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:16,503
But like I said, I'm in a bad way.

720
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:20,463
- How much?

721
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,363
- Six thousand.

722
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:31,600
- Son, how much you make working for me?

723
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,433
- Enough.

724
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:38,220
- Boy, not nearly enough.

725
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,853
- Mr. Reed, I will pay you back.

726
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,577
- I'm sorry son.

727
01:00:49,421 --> 01:00:50,820
- Mr. Reed, if I could just,

728
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,020
if I could just get some time.

729
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:53,853
- I'm sorry son.

730
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:56,840
I really am.

731
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,510
- Mr. Reed, I would never do this

732
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:00,020
if I didn't feel like it was important.

733
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:03,370
- Sean, there just ain't
nothing I can do for ya.

734
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:04,203
You hear me son?

735
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:08,543
I mean God bless ya boy, but
I'm running a business here.

736
01:01:12,037 --> 01:01:13,630
- I understand.

737
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:14,610
Thank you for your time.

738
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:15,443
- Hey.

739
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:17,633
You gonna be okay?

740
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,080
- I'll be all right.

741
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,610
- Sean, God don't never give a man

742
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:26,913
more than he can handle.

743
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:28,813
You'll see.

744
01:01:30,634 --> 01:01:32,594
You're gonna be just fine.

745
01:01:32,594 --> 01:01:33,427
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

746
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:43,503
- John.

747
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:45,623
You seen Tommy?

748
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:47,950
- Sean.

749
01:01:49,102 --> 01:01:49,935
My office.

750
01:01:51,399 --> 01:01:53,649
- You seen him?
- My office.

751
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,273
Where you been?

752
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:09,800
- Boss, I--

753
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,243
- I ain't your boss Sean.

754
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:14,210
Boss means you been working,

755
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:16,143
and you ain't been doing none of that.

756
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:20,253
I had to hire a couple of
Mexicans out of a parking lot.

757
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:24,170
You know how many times
I've had to convince Reed

758
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:27,963
that hiring overpaid Irish
boys was good for business?

759
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:33,033
- Boss, I'm sorry, I
just couldn't let Tommy.

760
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:35,543
- Shit I know.

761
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,420
I knew it when you came
asking for that money.

762
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:46,193
Mr. Reed called.

763
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,693
Was you always this dumb?

764
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:57,490
- You want me to clear out my stuff?

765
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:58,483
- You quitting?

766
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,883
- You tell me.

767
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:09,453
- Give them Mexicans a
ride outta here after work,

768
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:13,073
and I can't be paying for no missed days.

769
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,660
- Hey Boss, where's Tommy?

770
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:20,573
- Fuck I know.

771
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:22,470
- Well he's here.

772
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,693
- The fuck he is.

773
01:03:27,374 --> 01:03:28,457
- God damnit.

774
01:04:56,341 --> 01:04:57,993
- Howdy.

775
01:04:57,993 --> 01:05:00,020
- Get in the house.

776
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:02,040
- Claudia, where's the baby?

777
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,162
- He's napping.

778
01:05:03,162 --> 01:05:04,711
- You want me to call the sheriff?

779
01:05:04,711 --> 01:05:07,878
- No ma, just get in the house please.

780
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:14,723
Ma, shut the door.

781
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,460
- I'm just here to talk some sense.

782
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,780
- You don't talk to my family.

783
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:23,711
- I was just sitting--
- You don't.

784
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,940
You don't talk to my
family, you understand me?

785
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:27,773
- I hear ya.

786
01:05:28,846 --> 01:05:32,163
But, Eddie ain't gonna
stop wanting his money.

787
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,010
- You'll get your money.

788
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:36,070
- Need it quicker than that.

789
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:37,920
- I don't, I don't know what to tell you.

790
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,520
We don't just have six grand
lying around the house.

791
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,020
- Then I'm gonna kill him.

792
01:05:48,117 --> 01:05:50,963
You're brother, and
there ain't no other way.

793
01:05:57,681 --> 01:05:59,780
- You know I can't let that happen.

794
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:00,893
- This doesn't need to be your problem,

795
01:06:00,893 --> 01:06:02,343
just think about your family.

796
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,812
You think about the smart play here,

797
01:06:05,812 --> 01:06:06,773
you just tell me where he is.

798
01:06:06,773 --> 01:06:07,960
- I don't know where he is.

799
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,030
He could be locked up for all I know.

800
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:11,330
- Nah, he ain't locked up.

801
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,630
We'd know if he was,
and that'd make it easy.

802
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:23,030
You tell me where he is, and we walk away.

803
01:06:24,924 --> 01:06:27,174
If I leave here without
Tommy, that's on you.

804
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,810
You hear me?

805
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:35,660
Think about this.

806
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,490
Think about what I'm gonna have
to do if you don't tell me.

807
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,393
Where's Tommy?

808
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,150
- Get the fuck off my lawn bud.

809
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:10,870
- Thanks for the lemonade.

810
01:07:29,863 --> 01:07:32,757
- Exactly what kinda
jackpot we into here son?

811
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,080
- It's kind of a long story.

812
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,560
- You expecting trouble?

813
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,553
Not really.

814
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,493
- Care to elaborate on that?

815
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,120
- Sorry to ask you to do this.

816
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,470
I have no one else to
call, I'll be right back.

817
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:12,963
- What?

818
01:08:14,029 --> 01:08:15,423
Is Tommy here?

819
01:08:15,423 --> 01:08:16,256
- No.

820
01:08:38,641 --> 01:08:40,249
- Sean.

821
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:41,182
Where's Tommy?

822
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:45,422
- I don't know man.

823
01:08:48,513 --> 01:08:49,523
- Fuck you John.

824
01:08:55,367 --> 01:08:56,707
- Well Sean.

825
01:08:56,707 --> 01:08:58,000
What the fuck?

826
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,013
- Get up.
- Hey.

827
01:08:59,013 --> 01:09:00,793
- Get up.
- Sean.

828
01:09:00,793 --> 01:09:01,841
What the fuck man?

829
01:09:01,841 --> 01:09:02,674
- Get out.

830
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:05,303
Get out.
- Where you going?

831
01:09:05,303 --> 01:09:06,615
What are you doing?

832
01:09:06,615 --> 01:09:07,448
Hey, what.

833
01:09:12,377 --> 01:09:14,971
Where were you?

834
01:09:14,971 --> 01:09:15,804
Where have you been?

835
01:09:15,804 --> 01:09:17,017
Why weren't you at work?
- Sean!

836
01:09:17,017 --> 01:09:17,850
Sean.

837
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,190
- Where have you been?

838
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:27,163
They came to my house Tom.

839
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,233
They came to my house, my fucking family.

840
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:38,333
I'm done Tommy.

841
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:40,983
- Sean.

842
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,083
- No, I'm done.

843
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,401
I'm sorry.

844
01:09:56,833 --> 01:09:57,666
- Hey.

845
01:09:58,639 --> 01:10:00,128
Hey.

846
01:10:17,809 --> 01:10:20,057
- Hey Tommy, what the fuck
was that all about man?

847
01:10:20,057 --> 01:10:22,150
- I need your car.

848
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:22,983
What?

849
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,988
- Please John, I need your fucking car.

850
01:10:26,988 --> 01:10:27,988
- All right.

851
01:10:32,621 --> 01:10:33,454
- Your gun?

852
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,620
Your piece, is it in there?

853
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,190
- Yeah.

854
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:40,163
Everything okay?

855
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,163
- Just gotta fix something.

856
01:10:44,163 --> 01:10:45,930
I just filled it up.

857
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,203
Bring it back that way.

858
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:57,760
- Where were you?

859
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:04,754
I asked you a question Sean.

860
01:11:13,785 --> 01:11:14,618
Okay.

861
01:11:27,764 --> 01:11:28,597
- Tommy?

862
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,453
- Don't fucking move.

863
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,440
The cash, give me
the cash, let's go.

864
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,453
- Son look, let's think about this man.

865
01:12:42,153 --> 01:12:42,986
Drop it!

866
01:12:44,732 --> 01:12:45,565
Drop it!

867
01:12:48,069 --> 01:12:50,982
Turn around!

868
01:12:50,982 --> 01:12:51,982
Turn around.

869
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:56,140
- I was just coming to
get myself a Slurpee,

870
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,593
it's fucking hot out here.

871
01:13:00,503 --> 01:13:02,033
I'm gonna have to call you back.

872
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:04,443
- Shit.

873
01:14:19,194 --> 01:14:20,944
- Hey, you hear that?

874
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:34,693
Someone out there?

875
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:40,860
Hey, who's out there?

876
01:14:44,754 --> 01:14:45,980
- You said to bring the money.

877
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,989
Shit, you scared
the fuck outta me.

878
01:18:35,727 --> 01:18:37,560
Here we are.

879
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:39,453
- Yeah.

880
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:43,620
- So how's Margaret?

881
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:48,863
Emily?

882
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,333
- She good.

883
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:56,843
- That's good.

884
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:02,000
You remember when daddy left?

885
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:05,048
- Not really.

886
01:19:05,048 --> 01:19:07,498
- Shit, you weren't much
older than Emily is now.

887
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:11,763
I remember this priest
came by the house to visit.

888
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:15,470
This was before mom
stopped going to church.

889
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,843
He just took me out
to the property line.

890
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:25,340
We just sat out there by the
fence like a couple a queers.

891
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:29,293
After a while he says,

892
01:19:31,777 --> 01:19:34,433
"Leaving couldn't have been
easy on your daddy Tommy.

893
01:19:35,757 --> 01:19:38,657
"He'll be thinking about
you boys all the time."

894
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:45,070
Shit, I just sat there thinking

895
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:47,320
what a bunch of crap
that sounded like to me.

896
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:53,270
And I told him it seems
just about the easiest thing

897
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:55,120
in the world is
to pick up and leave.

898
01:19:59,246 --> 01:20:03,090
In fact, I still can't
think of anything easier.

899
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,780
Then we sat there for
a while, and he says,

900
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:13,010
he says to me, "Tommy,
good people do bad things,

901
01:20:15,747 --> 01:20:17,747
"but that don't
make 'em any less good."

902
01:20:22,723 --> 01:20:24,806
Do you think that's true?

903
01:20:28,258 --> 01:20:29,091
Hey.

904
01:20:32,753 --> 01:20:34,586
You think that's true?

905
01:20:39,442 --> 01:20:40,692
- I don't know.

906
01:20:48,525 --> 01:20:49,775
- I hope it is.
