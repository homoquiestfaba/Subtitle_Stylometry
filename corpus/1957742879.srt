1
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:24,665
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:52,573 --> 00:00:53,973
(car engine roaring)

3
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,009
(metal clinking)

4
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:50,127
(pages fluttering)

5
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:27,243
(door creaking)

6
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:30,609
(Julian breathes heavily)

7
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,479
(indistinct)

8
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:56,952
(instrumental music)

9
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,787
- So what, you've
just been like cooped

10
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:19,998
up in your grandmother's
house for the last month

11
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,347
going through this stuff?

12
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,182
- (laughs) well, I
guess it seems that way,

13
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:25,008
but nah, I'm just trying
to make the place feel

14
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:27,775
like it's mine and cleaning up,

15
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,727
Old Head helped me
with repainting.

16
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:31,856
I even took down the old
photos and everything.

17
00:03:32,393 --> 00:03:33,202
- Really?

18
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:34,581
- Yeah, the only thing
I'm trying to keep

19
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:36,156
are her books and old records.

20
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:38,745
- (laughs) Of course, you
kept the books and records

21
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,667
it's too much.

22
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,635
- You should move
in here with me.

23
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:50,617
- What?

24
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:52,982
(dramatic music)

25
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:58,074
(instrumental music)

26
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,326
- (breathes heavily) So
the last time I saw you

27
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:22,122
was like a month ago,
and we watched that movie

28
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:25,212
where the guy's house
burns down at the end,

29
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:26,978
and then you cried a little bit

30
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:28,929
and didn't say much for
the rest of the night.

31
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:30,697
- Okay, wow. You crazy?

32
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:32,905
That's "The Sacrifice"
Tarkovsky is a genius.

33
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:34,329
- Okay, my point being-

34
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:35,661
- What?

35
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:37,612
- We haven't been in
communication lately.

36
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:39,826
And for all you know, I
could be seeing someone.

37
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:45,168
Okay, I'm not okay.

38
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:45,723
- Okay.

39
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:47,299
- But the point is I could be.

40
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,636
- Well, can you at least
consider it? Think about it.

41
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:58,654
Look at all this,
there's a lot of room.

42
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:37,983
- This was actually a
conversation I had the other day

43
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:40,196
was around like
family structures.

44
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:44,914
In the US families
are formed of nuclear.

45
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,292
It's very much like mom,
dad, kids, you know,

46
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:50,675
whereas at home you have
a much bigger community

47
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:54,433
and like your extended family
is a lot more incorporated

48
00:05:57,432 --> 00:05:59,316
into what you would see
as your nuclear family,

49
00:06:01,064 --> 00:06:02,464
you know, almost.

50
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:04,786
So I find that to
be quite different.

51
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,377
I've also like done a
lot of different jobs

52
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,968
one being in childcare,
so I see how families

53
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:14,974
sort of operate here, and
that's kind of strange to me

54
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,646
that you can like call in a
complete stranger and be like,

55
00:06:19,226 --> 00:06:20,777
'Here's my six month old.

56
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:22,124
Okay, there's milk in
the fridge. Toodles."

57
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,117
You know, (laughs)
and like at home,

58
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,965
you're just never
short of hands.

59
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:27,916
There's not a shortage
of someone that you know

60
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,129
very well to like help
you with your children

61
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,218
and your children's children
and so on and so forth.

62
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:45,545
- You don't get it?

63
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:47,121
- No, it's like bottom is up.

64
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:48,218
- Yeah.

65
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,793
- The fuck are you doing?

66
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:51,892
- This is how native
people eat it.

67
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,687
I don't need a fork,
a knife (indistinct).

68
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,930
- You're motherfucking from
West Philly, you're not native.

69
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,319
Cut that shit open, man.

70
00:06:57,343 --> 00:06:58,612
- No, I'm just fine.

71
00:06:58,636 --> 00:07:00,033
- Whatever, man.

72
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:01,703
Just tired of my mom,
she's tripping yo.

73
00:07:01,727 --> 00:07:03,989
She keep asking me if I'm
selling crack and shit, bro.

74
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:05,836
- Shit.

75
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,787
- I'm like, "Mom, like
who keeps selling crack?

76
00:07:08,615 --> 00:07:10,015
It's like 2019."

77
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,266
I don't know, man, she's crazy.

78
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,642
But like I keep trying
to tell her like,

79
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,468
"Look, it's painkillers,
that's the wave now."

80
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:17,568
- For real?

81
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:18,676
You know, the doctors
are pushing that shit.

82
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:20,490
And all the reason
why I go to jail,

83
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:21,952
is 'cause I ain't got a license.

84
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:23,944
I'm just gonna get
drunk or fucking.

85
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,465
Y'all, I'm gonna get at you.

86
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,416
I got deliver a package
for my man, all right?

87
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,556
- All right, cool.

88
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,132
Well, tell your mom I say hi.

89
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,760
- She's always asks about you.

90
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:37,524
- Bye, Rich.

91
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,948
- Gwen

92
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:41,077
(wind whooshing)

93
00:07:57,754 --> 00:07:59,766
- Our first step therefore,
must be to reeducate ourselves,

94
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,150
to regain a former
attitude of mind.

95
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,117
"In our traditional African
society, we were individuals

96
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:10,578
within a community , who
took care of our community

97
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,460
and our community
took care of us.

98
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,424
We neither needed nor wished
to exploit our fellow men."

99
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:21,600
- "And then rejecting the
capitalist attitude of mind,

100
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:25,484
which colonialism
brought into Africa,

101
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:28,031
we must reject also
the capitalist methods
which go with it.

102
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:32,999
One of these is individual
ownership of land.

103
00:08:34,036 --> 00:08:36,005
To us in Africa, land
was always recognized

104
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:40,306
as belonging to the community.

105
00:08:46,353 --> 00:08:48,238
Modern African
socialism can draw

106
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,617
from its traditional heritage,
the recognition of society

107
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:54,334
which produced us as
an extension of the
basic family unit,

108
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:58,675
but it can no longer
confine the idea

109
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:01,223
of the social family within
the limits of the tribe

110
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:04,688
nor indeed of the nation.

111
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:07,693
Modern African
socialism can draw

112
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:10,282
from its traditional heritage,
the recognition of society

113
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:13,705
as an extension of
the basic family unit,

114
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:16,043
but it can no longer confine
the idea of the social family

115
00:09:17,164 --> 00:09:19,342
within the limits of the tribe,
nor indeed of the nation."

116
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:27,149
- The foundation and the
objective of African socialism

117
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,920
is the extended family.

118
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:33,287
The true African socialists
does not look on one class

119
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,749
of man as his brethren and
another as his natural enemy.

120
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:40,426
Ujamaa then, a familyhood
describes our socialism.

121
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:46,187
It is opposed to capitalism,
which seeks to build

122
00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:48,984
a happy society on the basis
of exploitation of men by men.

123
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:55,539
We in Africa have no more
need of being converted

124
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:59,088
to socialism than we have
of being taught democracy.

125
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:04,014
Both are rooted in our past

126
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:06,353
and in the traditional
society, which produced us.'

127
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,092
- [Woman] I know many of
you are very enthusiastic

128
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:24,680
about the candidacy of
Congresswoman Chisholm.

129
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:28,438
And just to give her an
opportunity to address you

130
00:10:29,057 --> 00:10:30,036
for a short few minutes.

131
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,029
She's only to speak for
two minutes. No more.

132
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:35,869
- I want to tell you that,

133
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:38,595
(man laughing)

134
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:40,629
I have always been a
catalyst for change.

135
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,770
And you're going to have
the dooms day criers out

136
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,359
here saying that the woman
is crazy, she's nuts.

137
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:53,906
But they said I was
crazy from 20 years ago

138
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:56,578
when I first emerged
on the political scene.

139
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:58,999
So let them continue
to think I'm crazy.

140
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:04,176
My brain power has been
utilized by many persons

141
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:07,015
within politics for 15 years.

142
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,896
And a lot of you know
what I'm talking about.

143
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,818
You heard when it was
time for me to merge,

144
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,123
politically, they
didn't want to,

145
00:11:14,147 --> 00:11:16,368
because they couldn't control
me after they'd use my brains.

146
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:19,342
You women better wake
up if you wanna help

147
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,959
to change America around.

148
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:22,881
You go to work,
you better wake up.

149
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,887
And don't be afraid, have
confidence in yourself.

150
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:31,784
And the ability that
you have is ability

151
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:33,402
and talent given to you by God.

152
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:35,280
And don't let anybody use you.

153
00:11:35,774 --> 00:11:37,993
Don't let people continue to
use you and to manipulate you.

154
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,001
The only thing that you
have is your integrity

155
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:44,005
and principles and
the convictions

156
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:46,009
of what we are fighting
for in America.

157
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:48,515
I believe that it's
very important to
consider first of all,

158
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:52,272
that in a society in
which a certain segment

159
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,031
has the resources
at its command, that
the oppressive group

160
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:02,929
has to recognize that you
can take on that group

161
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:05,047
into society with rhetoric
or, you know, with rhetoric,

162
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:11,519
with matches or stories
or with bombs or whatever.

163
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,399
That what you've got to
do is to form coalitions

164
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:19,118
of people in the society
to move together,

165
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:25,631
to make that particular group
or that particular segment

166
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,136
turn about or perhaps
infiltrate that group

167
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:29,900
and turn it around.

168
00:12:29,924 --> 00:12:32,101
It has to be done to the
creative use of brain power

169
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:35,025
and through the consolidation
and solidification of people.

170
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,332
It cannot be done
in any other way

171
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,700
because you don't have the
resources at your command.

172
00:12:41,197 --> 00:12:42,467
If you want to
indulge in rhetoric

173
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:44,418
and you want to indulge
it using your energy

174
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:47,131
which can not give
you effective results.

175
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,231
That's another thing.

176
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:50,608
In other words, I call
that ego tripping.

177
00:12:50,632 --> 00:12:52,601
So you can't change the
system by ego tripping.

178
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,033
- [Reporter] Right.

179
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:56,327
- All right?
- right. Thank you very much.

180
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:57,751
- You're welcome.

181
00:12:58,314 --> 00:12:59,714
(car engine roaring)

182
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:18,501
(instrumental music)

183
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:37,242
- [Gwen] We're still unpacking
and sorting through some

184
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:39,319
of this content, but feel
free to help if you want.

185
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:42,575
It's for a good cause, and
trust me, you'll probably learn

186
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,832
a whole lot more here
than wasting your time

187
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:47,544
and money at school.

188
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,435
- [Stephanie] You know, it's
funny how you educated folks

189
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,470
are always telling the rest
of us not to go to school.

190
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,435
It's like, when I'm
at the cafe all day

191
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:57,648
those people who come in,
get their $7 cup of coffee,

192
00:13:59,477 --> 00:14:00,414
stay there for three hours.

193
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:02,240
Like they're definitely
educated people.

194
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:06,289
I don't know how do they
have the time or the money?

195
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:09,295
Just like, I swear
you educated peeves,

196
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,260
you're definitely
conspiring to keep the rest

197
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,305
of us out of the club.

198
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:15,235
- The club?

199
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:15,987
- [Stephanie] Yes.

200
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:17,562
- You mean temple or like a zoo?

201
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:19,035
There are way too
many students and half

202
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,237
of them are there to advance
their career choices.

203
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:23,381
It's pathetic actually.

204
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:24,754
I'm sure most of
the people working

205
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:26,706
in the cafe are
applying for jobs.

206
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,542
- Yeah, but they
still have money

207
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:31,131
for their skinny, big double
cup of a latte with a line,

208
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,104
that quite much it does, right?

209
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:35,347
And on top of that, they
pull off and they're like,

210
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:37,143
moms can be down Subaru.

211
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:39,355
Let's not even talk
about the rent. Girl.

212
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,404
So one time this woman
comes into the cafe

213
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:44,543
tries to hit on me.

214
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,746
I'm wearing this shirt, this
is Bard, which I think is tight

215
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:49,584
because I think it's
like a poet or some shit.

216
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:52,299
She comes in and she's
like, "Did you go to Bard?"

217
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,847
And I'm like, "How could I have
went to Bard? I am a Bard."

218
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,828
She just laughs, and she
wants to know my story,

219
00:15:01,852 --> 00:15:03,780
but I thought it was a
pretty good pickup line.

220
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:06,409
- [Gwen] Okay, I'm gonna
go out on a whim and say,

221
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:07,589
this woman was white.

222
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:09,750
- Yeah, but tell Julian
I'm getting night education

223
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:12,683
out in these streets, you know.

224
00:15:12,707 --> 00:15:14,425
It's the best place to learn.

225
00:15:15,212 --> 00:15:16,848
And we also went
out for a movie.

226
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,435
- Oh, okay. What are you go see?

227
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,648
- "Negro Doppelganger",
new film by LeBron Ride.

228
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,171
I don't know, my date
said it's supposed

229
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:28,424
to be like a genius
or something.

230
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:30,333
She loved it. I
thought it was okay.

231
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:33,171
Just like so funny how
hurt white people look

232
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:36,888
when they love a black movie

233
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:38,599
and you say you don't like it.

234
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:41,355
Oh man, we went
for a few drinks,

235
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:43,036
like went back to her place

236
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,237
and she kept calling herself
poor the whole night,

237
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:48,452
even though she ordered
like three Negronis like,

238
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:51,333
I don't even know what
the fuck a Negroni is.

239
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:53,139
- [Gwen] Wow.

240
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:55,425
- We went back to her place,
which is kind of in the hood.

241
00:15:57,088 --> 00:15:58,639
I thought I was gonna lose it.

242
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:01,144
She had this nice ass place
off Fifth Ave in Baltimore.

243
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,152
And get this, of
course she lives alone.

244
00:16:06,273 --> 00:16:07,417
- You're kidding.

245
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:08,993
- I wish, at first I'm like,

246
00:16:09,154 --> 00:16:11,039
let me just bust in and
then I'm out, right.

247
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:13,502
And I was just like,
fuck this shit. Fuck it.

248
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:16,467
Like, why should she get to
walk into my place of work,

249
00:16:18,631 --> 00:16:20,558
choose me and then I
have to go home with her?

250
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:22,739
I'm like,

251
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:23,366
- [Gwen] What?

252
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,118
- Maybe it's silly,

253
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:26,362
but I just felt really
empowered when I was like,

254
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:28,824
I'm tired, like I have to go.

255
00:16:30,738 --> 00:16:32,707
But anyways, long story
short, she was on that same

256
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:35,729
don't go to school shit.

257
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,093
But when it came time
to talk about the movie,

258
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:40,597
every other word
had five syllables

259
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,601
and was followed by a
hyphenated last name.

260
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:45,749
Like classic.

261
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:48,613
- [Gwen] I hear you.

262
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:54,208
(footsteps tapping)
(metal clanking)

263
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:02,641
(instrumental music)

264
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,000
(footsteps tapping)

265
00:18:10,145 --> 00:18:11,779
(instrumental music)

266
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:23,147
- Yeah.

267
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:24,805
(instrumental music)

268
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,981
- My first name is Old Head.

269
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:52,444
I'm called Old Head, but my
real name is Tyrone Preston.

270
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:55,910
And we are in the
House of Ubuntu.

271
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:00,877
And it's a house that
is focused and geared

272
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,805
towards the preservation and
self care of black people.

273
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:10,648
And I'm here to learn
and I'm here to enjoy,

274
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:15,907
and I'm here to look towards
the future, you know.

275
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:19,874
(instrumental music)

276
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,011
(indistinct chatters)
(instrumental music)

277
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:18,031
- Where did you learn that from?

278
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:28,636
- That poem mean togetherness,

279
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:32,394
like being a part of this house.

280
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,828
To me, that's togetherness.

281
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:37,989
That's being a part of
something bigger than yourself.

282
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,660
That's coexisting together
and working to achieve

283
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:48,175
a cause that we all
are fighting for.

284
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,647
Equality, justice for all,
love and love one another.

285
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:04,918
(smooth trumpet music)

286
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:00,153
- "The bushwazee tries to stifle

287
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:02,239
the explosive transformative
nature of art,

288
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,998
it's magical properties, except
as correlative to religion

289
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:10,048
or illusion or as
nifty advertising.

290
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:13,179
Art is a human expression of
endless birth and rebirth,

291
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:18,022
the big bang of
universal of becoming,

292
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:20,861
the being produced
manifest of ecstatic fire.

293
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:24,660
Space into speech, vision
as a science of motion."

294
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,256
- "The transformative power
of art as opposed to ain't,

295
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:35,305
life versus death,
creativity versus destruction

296
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:39,482
is the essence of the dialectic,

297
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:41,444
which confronts us
and informs our work.

298
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:44,323
So that now asked first of the
would be revolutionary artist

299
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,625
for whom, ie for
whom do you write?

300
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,925
Secondly, Mao asked,
"What do you celebrate?

301
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:56,781
And what do you attack?

302
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:58,811
From this we can tell
whose side you're on,

303
00:23:02,229 --> 00:23:03,863
the oppressed or
the oppressors."

304
00:23:10,286 --> 00:23:11,686
(dramatic music)

305
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:30,542
Revolutionary art is the
eternity of the world.

306
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:34,216
The endless breath,
the endless heartbeat.

307
00:23:35,837 --> 00:23:38,182
To deny it is to lie. And
truth is the final reality.

308
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:42,232
We are taught to deny the power

309
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:44,444
and force of art except
as elitist license."

310
00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:48,451
- "We do not believe
our poetry can function

311
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:51,000
as a force of
nature to transform

312
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:53,129
and cleanse and
destroy and resurrect."

00:25:13,031 --> 00:25:15,334
- Your article on Trains
and you're allover the news.

346
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,391
- Nice.

347
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:18,815
- You guys are crazy.

348
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:23,820
That's you?

349
00:25:23,844 --> 00:25:25,244
- Yeah.

350
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,249
- Yo, how comes every
time I have a conversation

351
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,670
with you somebody interrupts
with some knowledge

352
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,396
of self type shit?

353
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,388
And what the fuck
is Ubuntu anyway?

354
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,693
- Oh look, Gwen came up...

355
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:45,770
I mean, we came up with this
way of organizing ourselves.

356
00:25:46,848 --> 00:25:48,860
So we're running the house
like it's a collective now.

357
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,883
- Hmm, collective?

358
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,551
So I don't talk to
you for a month,

359
00:25:55,575 --> 00:25:57,710
and now you run into code
out of your grandma's crib?

360
00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:00,226
Yo, pussy got your
tripping Julian.

361
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:00,894
- No, no.

362
00:26:00,918 --> 00:26:02,189
- Pussy got you
straight tripping.

363
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:03,650
- No, it's not like
that. Calm down.

364
00:26:03,674 --> 00:26:04,234
Look, it's just-

365
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:06,238
- Yo chill, chill man,
I'm just messing with you.

366
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:08,189
You ain't got to
get on the fools.

367
00:26:09,143 --> 00:26:10,736
Look. No disrespect, you know,

368
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:13,127
but I wanted to
ask you something

369
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:14,744
before Miles Davis walked in.

370
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:17,500
You know, I hate to ask it bro,

371
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,756
but I need to
place to crash man.

372
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:22,760
- Oh, okay. So your
mom put you out again?

373
00:26:23,965 --> 00:26:25,944
- Man look, man,
I don't even know.

374
00:26:25,968 --> 00:26:27,813
This time I didn't
even do anything.

375
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:29,494
Like she's just
straight tripping.

376
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:30,955
Like she just wanna be
alone or something, yo.

377
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:33,156
- Okay, well, because we
were running as a collective,

378
00:26:35,488 --> 00:26:37,457
I'm gonna have to
talk to the group.

379
00:26:37,992 --> 00:26:40,045
We're operating through
the principle of consensus,

380
00:26:40,122 --> 00:26:42,425
so I'm gonna have to talk to
them and see what we can do.

381
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:45,431
- Consensus?

382
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:46,068
- Yeah.

383
00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:47,010
- What do you mean consensus?

384
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:49,188
Yo dude, like you stay
with my mom for like years,

385
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,818
like dude, I ain't never
really asked you for nothing

386
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:52,998
so much as this.

387
00:26:53,022 --> 00:26:53,833
- I get it, I get it.

388
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:55,910
But I have to put it on the
agenda for our next meeting

389
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:57,030
and then we have to discuss it.

390
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:58,301
Like that's just
the way it works.

391
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,637
- Agenda? What are
you talking about?

392
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:00,847
Do you know who
you're taking to, yo?

393
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,840
You're taking this
Ubuntu shit too far, man.

394
00:27:03,126 --> 00:27:04,939
Like I've never asked
you for nothing,

395
00:27:04,963 --> 00:27:05,691
like one time one favor.

396
00:27:05,715 --> 00:27:07,850
- Okay, chill, chill. Rich
look, I'll talk to Gwen.

397
00:27:09,138 --> 00:27:10,826
She's gonna be pissed at me-

398
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,578
- See, that's what...

399
00:27:11,602 --> 00:27:13,862
See, I knew it, I knew it.
She don't even like me.

400
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,376
- No, its not that.

401
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,295
- You don't even have to say it.

402
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:18,539
- Look, look, listen,
she's gonna be mad at me.

403
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:20,386
She's gonna think
I'm being a dictator.

404
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,672
Like there are all these terms
that she like throws at me.

405
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,093
And so, but it's
cool, it's cool.

406
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:27,890
I'll talk to Gwen,
I'll get Gwen on board

407
00:27:28,092 --> 00:27:29,978
and then we should be
able to get you in.

408
00:27:31,098 --> 00:27:32,901
And it's just gonna take
a little bit of time.

409
00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:35,448
Are you prepared to pay your
portion of the cost share?

410
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,671
- The what?

411
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:39,581
- The cost share, we
don't like the term rent

412
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,626
is too feudal or
industrial or whatever.

413
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:44,340
- Cost share, cosco, whatever
man, I got the rent, man.

414
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:46,648
Can I stay?

415
00:27:46,672 --> 00:27:47,983
- I'm gonna talk to Gwen.

416
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:49,236
- Can I stay, bro?

417
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,114
- All right, dude,
yeah, yeah. I got you.

418
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:52,940
- Thank you, you're
acting funny, man.

419
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:56,907
Pussy got your ass tripping, yo.

420
00:27:57,151 --> 00:27:58,128
- Come on, Rich.

421
00:27:58,152 --> 00:27:59,552
- Nah, bro.

422
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:01,833
- (laughs) You're funny.

423
00:28:06,962 --> 00:28:08,362
(gentle piano music)

424
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:15,736
(car engines roaring)

425
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,503
(smooth trumpet music)
- [Patricia] Hi, how are you?

426
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:07,266
- How are you?

427
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,800
- [Patricia] Good.

428
00:29:09,212 --> 00:29:11,055
- That man, first
Prime Minster of Ghana.

429
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,104
- [Julian] Okay, okay.
(smooth trumpet music)

430
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:20,714
- Hi, guys.

431
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:26,304
Welcome, guys.

432
00:29:26,328 --> 00:29:27,922
- [Old Head] Hello.

433
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:29,482
- Thanks for joining me.

434
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:30,312
- [Gwen] Yes.

435
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:32,389
- We'll be having a workshop,
a language workshop.

436
00:29:33,468 --> 00:29:34,905
What do you think about that?

437
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:36,032
- [Gwen] It's gonna be great.

438
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:37,326
- Better learn a
little bit about it.

439
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,750
- [Rich] (indistinct)

440
00:29:38,854 --> 00:29:39,414
- Right now?

441
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:41,324
- [Rich] Yeah. Now, what
were we gonna learn?

442
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,038
- Nuer. Some word from Nuer.

443
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,342
- Nuer?
- Yeah.

444
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,763
- There's a cologne called Nuer.

445
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:47,346
- Yeah?

446
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,172
- That's South
Sudanese language.

447
00:29:49,876 --> 00:29:52,137
From one of many, many
languages from South Sudan.

448
00:29:54,134 --> 00:29:55,534
So awesome.

449
00:29:55,805 --> 00:29:56,388
- [Gwen] Yeah.

450
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:57,534
- You guys ready to start?

451
00:29:57,558 --> 00:29:58,368
- [Students] Yeah.

452
00:29:58,392 --> 00:30:00,112
- Actually, just to have an idea

453
00:30:00,188 --> 00:30:02,074
of what the language
is compared to English,

454
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,380
how it's written.

455
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:06,249
- [Gwen] Wait?
(foreign language)

456
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:08,378
- (foreign language)
Yes, sit down.

457
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,144
- [Gwen] (foreign language)

458
00:30:11,168 --> 00:30:12,720
- [Patricia] Yes, you got it.

459
00:30:13,465 --> 00:30:14,484
- [Gwen] (foreign language)

460
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:16,352
- [Patricia] (foreign
language) Do it.

461
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:18,451
- [Gwen] (foreign language)

462
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:19,410
- [Patricia] Yeah.

463
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:20,412
- [Gwen] (foreign language)

464
00:30:20,436 --> 00:30:22,238
- [Patricia] (foreign
language). See it.

465
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:23,920
- [Gwen] What about this-

466
00:30:23,944 --> 00:30:24,880
- [Patricia] What's is then?

467
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:26,132
- [Rich] Is it
good? Is it alright?

468
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:27,344
- [Patricia] (foreign language)

469
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:28,304
- [Students] (foreign language)

470
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:29,097
- [Patricia] Yeah.

471
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:31,256
- [Gwen] What's called kind
of like, (foreign language)?

472
00:30:33,796 --> 00:30:35,390
- [Rich] (foreign language)

473
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,853
- [Patricia] (foreign language)

474
00:30:38,055 --> 00:30:39,649
- [Students] (foreign language)

475
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:42,028
- Like Charlie, charlie?

476
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:43,334
- [Patricia] No.

477
00:30:43,358 --> 00:30:44,460
- Like I would say-

478
00:30:44,484 --> 00:30:45,462
- [Patricia] (foreign language)

479
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:46,883
- [Man] (foreign language)

480
00:30:46,907 --> 00:30:48,468
- [Patricia] Yeah. See backward?

481
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:50,295
See the right way. See
backward, then out.

482
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,969
- (foreign language)

483
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:57,309
- [Patricia] (foreign language)

484
00:30:57,386 --> 00:30:59,396
So since we learn a little
bit of how the language

485
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,776
is written, and how you
can say a few words,

486
00:31:03,522 --> 00:31:05,367
we're gonna practice
this quote on the board.

487
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:09,667
- [Students] (foreign language)

488
00:31:26,736 --> 00:31:28,370
- [Patricia] (laughs) Oh, okay.

489
00:31:28,949 --> 00:31:29,676
- [Rich] We smart.

490
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,669
- Yes, you are, (laughs)
smart. The Collective.

491
00:31:36,171 --> 00:31:37,765
- [Students] (foreign language)

492
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,043
- [Julian] Okay.
There's progress.

493
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,422
- [Students] (foreign language)

494
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:30,928
- That's deep.

495
00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:37,508
Hmm. That's a deep one.

496
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:44,816
You gonna fall for that?

497
00:32:47,939 --> 00:32:49,450
(wind whirling)

498
00:33:04,306 --> 00:33:05,706
(dramatic music)

499
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:11,369
- [Narrator] Move does
not believe in technology.

500
00:33:11,737 --> 00:33:13,300
They use a wood-burning
stove for heat

501
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,460
and they have no electricity,
but they do have cars

502
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:17,725
and they have a telephone.

503
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:19,592
Why? all the answers
are in the guidelines.

504
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:22,098
Their Bible left by John Africa.

505
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,686
- This room that you are in
now has a great significance

506
00:33:26,642 --> 00:33:28,653
to us because this room, and
in fact at this very table

507
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:32,953
is where many early
Move members get

508
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,293
their first understanding
of life from John Africa.

509
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:40,301
We see John Africa then,
rather we saw John Africa

510
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:43,223
in the same way that
people saw Jesus Christ,

511
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:45,645
because of his carpentry,

512
00:33:45,846 --> 00:33:48,067
because of his simple way
of living and so forth.

513
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:50,654
Now we know that
John Africa is a man

514
00:33:52,235 --> 00:33:53,786
who can explain Jesus Christ.

515
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:56,386
- [Interviewer] How
old is John Africa?

516
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,670
- John Africa is one. One
level, one grade of life.

517
00:34:00,627 --> 00:34:02,596
Everything you see, the
sun, the air, the water

518
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:05,685
that you drink off, all of
that if John Africa, one force.

519
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:10,027
- [Man] Blue to show call.

(dogs barking)

522
00:34:15,573 --> 00:34:17,501
And now the second

(background noise

530
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:44,555
Gail Sims, Dennis Sims,
Frank Sims, Carlos Perez,

531
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:55,660
Michael Davis, Raymond roster,

Robert Mosses, Sue
Iron, Camille Hasting.

533
00:35:04,629 --> 00:35:06,806
- [Man] You really don't
give a damn, come on with it.

534
00:35:07,134 --> 00:35:09,062
(background noise
drowns out speaker)

535
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:11,274
307309 North
(indistinct) street.

536
00:35:13,272 --> 00:35:15,116
(background noise
drowns out the speaker)

537
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,875
- [Woman] Are you
serious right here?

538
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,597
- [Man] You see there
are cops right here, man.

539
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,310
Once we go to court
here's what I'm gonna say

540
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:24,885
to this so called nigga murder.

541
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:27,651
- [Woman] Is it gonna
stop him from killing us?

542
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:29,852
We've been going to court for
six years and Bristol is still

543
00:35:30,097 --> 00:35:32,400
talking about bringing his
bullshit out of the door.

544
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,487
Too afraid they gonna
stop choosing our home.

545
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:36,126
- [Man] What are
you talking about?

546
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,994
I'm talking about
murder in the same town.

547
00:35:38,906 --> 00:35:40,874
I'm talking about
cops (indistinct)

548
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:47,012
with machine guns
and all over gutter.

549
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:50,948
He can swear to
killing somebody.

550
00:35:50,972 --> 00:35:52,898
This man is talking
about killing somebody

551
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,903
over so-called civil
contempt of court.

552
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:57,366
Which wins death penalty
when the go to court.

553
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:01,667
(fists punching)

554
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,883
- [Narrator] Debbie Africa
wearing the dungarees

555
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,971
is four months pregnant, but
she can still participate

556
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,727
in the regular activity
that make up the bulk

557
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,533
of the Move members day.

558
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:14,442
When the time comes
for the baby to be born

559
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:16,374
it will come wherever
she happens to be,

560
00:36:16,398 --> 00:36:18,618
without a doctor in attendance,
certainly not in a hospital.

561
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:23,226
- [Man] 20 pounding.

562
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,759
(fists pounding)

563
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,436
(audience applauding)

564
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,520
- And I thank you for welcoming
us into the House of Ubuntu.

565
00:36:56,185 --> 00:36:58,197
My name is Debbie Africa. I'm
from the Move organization.

566
00:36:59,108 --> 00:37:01,118
Organization, first of all
was founded by John Africa,

567
00:37:02,991 --> 00:37:04,542
black man, long time ago.

568
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,968
I just came around in
the '70s, in early '70s.

569
00:37:09,671 --> 00:37:11,223
Our belief is about natural law.

570
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,238
It's actually just a belief

571
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:16,064
that is really
familiar to everybody

572
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,405
because everybody has to
breathe, everybody has to eat.

573
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:22,245
Everybody has to
endure and enjoy

574
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:25,667
and live by the natural
standards of all of life,

575
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:29,090
which is the air,
the water, the soil,

576
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:30,522
nobody can do without it.

577
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:32,484
Nobody can do it out.
It can't be disputed.

578
00:37:32,508 --> 00:37:34,728
John Africa just breaks down
the causes of people's problems

579
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:39,570
like where people's
problems are coming from.

580
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:41,992
And that's the thing that
actually really grabbed me,

581
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:44,120
because he talks about
a section on children

582
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:46,334
and watch children grow up
to be the way that they are,

583
00:37:47,328 --> 00:37:49,257
sometimes like
dysfunctional or insecure.

584
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,136
And he really
breaks it down to me

585
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,318
and make me really
understand it,

586
00:37:54,342 --> 00:37:56,145
because it just explains
how society just forces

587
00:37:59,812 --> 00:38:01,364
you kind of to love technology,

588
00:38:02,986 --> 00:38:04,871
to love things that
are feeling less

589
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:06,342
to love things that
are meaningless,

590
00:38:06,366 --> 00:38:08,503
to love things that, you know,
that don't have feelings.

591
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:11,426
You know, a car,
a chair, a floor,

592
00:38:12,378 --> 00:38:13,931
a shiny car, a shiny floor.

593
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:16,184
But meanwhile, hurt
child's feelings over that.

594
00:38:17,306 --> 00:38:19,190
John Africa also breaks
down every other aspect

595
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,196
and system too that has
people drawn to the system

596
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,122
to make them feel like they
want it and they need it.

597
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,710
And you know, he just goes
into all those details

598
00:38:29,455 --> 00:38:31,674
about you know, I mean from
the government to food,

599
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:38,187
to healthy eating, to healthy
living, to what you know,

600
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:40,232
what people need to do
as a group, as a family,

601
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:44,240
as a world system,
in order to fight

602
00:38:46,447 --> 00:38:48,375
the thing that had
been put on us.

603
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,383
Fight the diseases that have
been put on us by mankind.

604
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:56,892
And it sounds really
complicated and deep,

605
00:38:58,346 --> 00:38:59,898
but it's really not deep at all.

606
00:39:00,392 --> 00:39:01,704
It's very, very simple.

607
00:39:01,728 --> 00:39:02,956
Very, very, very simple.

608
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,908
Humans are no better
than animal life.

609
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,621
Animals are no better
than plant life.

610
00:39:07,907 --> 00:39:09,750
- [Interviewer]
Where is John Africa?

611
00:39:10,494 --> 00:39:12,296
- That's organization
business right now.

612
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:14,510
- [Interviewer] What do you
mean it's organization business?

613
00:39:14,837 --> 00:39:15,732
You're asking people to believe

614
00:39:15,756 --> 00:39:17,307
in the philosophy of this man.

615
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:19,562
Why can't he come forth
and speak it himself?

616
00:39:20,014 --> 00:39:22,234
- Teachings of John Africa
are inherent in his disciples.

617
00:39:24,064 --> 00:39:26,324
His works are shown in the
healthiness of our children,

618
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:29,749
the sturdiness of our building,
the way we live, all right?

619
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,006
What we're saying is that
for security reasons,

620
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,636
John Africa whereabouts
are organization business

621
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,194
and we will keep it that way.

622
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:40,103
We're not asking people
to idolize a figure,

623
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:42,984
a so-called leader as they
have done in the past,

624
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:45,362
what we are asking people
to do is take serious look

625
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:48,495
at their lifestyle as
John Africa has said,

626
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:51,374
see it for what it is, and
do away with it, all right?

627
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,380
That has nothing to do
with idolizing John Africa.

628
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:57,386
We the members of Move have a
great reference for the man,

629
00:39:57,882 --> 00:39:59,850
for the founder of
this organization.

630
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:01,896
That has nothing to do
with any mystical. Okay?

631
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,670
Any foolishness.

632
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,326
So this man isn't asking
people to buy him any catalyze,

633
00:40:09,488 --> 00:40:11,050
he ain't asking
people to worship him.

634
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:12,960
All he's asking people
to do is be right.

635
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:15,716
And for that, his
presence isn't required.

636
00:40:17,086 --> 00:40:18,930
- My name is Michael
Africa Senior.

637
00:40:20,092 --> 00:40:22,020
I'm a member of the
Move Organization.

638
00:40:23,183 --> 00:40:25,442
And I'm gonna talk a
little bit about how I met

639
00:40:26,564 --> 00:40:28,448
that amazing woman
that was just up here.

640
00:40:29,486 --> 00:40:31,080
She belonged to amazing family.

641
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,209
Her uncle was John
Africa, at the time,

642
00:40:34,455 --> 00:40:36,048
I just knew him as uncle Benny.

643
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:37,771
A lot of things were going

644
00:40:37,795 --> 00:40:39,680
on in the neighborhoods,
and the community.

645
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:42,322
You had the Black Panthers.

646
00:40:42,346 --> 00:40:44,314
You had the Black
Liberation Army.

647
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:46,653
We had other groups
and other social ills

648
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,421
that was happening
in the community.

649
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:52,414
I wasn't really that
aware of much of it,

650
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,174
nor did I really care to be.

651
00:40:57,334 --> 00:40:59,219
I was a Marine, so I
was going the other way.

652
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:05,700
But being around
an organization,

653
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:07,330
I started seeing
some of the things

654
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:09,281
that were happening
in the community.

655
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:12,370
And then after I met some
members of Move Organization,

656
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,548
I did become aware of
a lot of social ills.

657
00:41:19,586 --> 00:41:21,555
And becoming aware makes
you caring, makes you angry,

658
00:41:30,107 --> 00:41:31,993
and it compelled
me to get involved.

659
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:35,333
and get involved that did

660
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,432
- [Student] When was
there a true turning point

661
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:39,424
from like the life
you were living

662
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:41,387
into you really
subscribing to the sort

663
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,687
of like natural law
that John Africa...

664
00:41:47,642 --> 00:41:49,581
- All right, it seems like
when you hear the story,

665
00:41:49,605 --> 00:41:51,532
it sounds like I would
have taken a long time,

666
00:41:52,193 --> 00:41:53,297
but I really wasn't.

667
00:41:53,321 --> 00:41:55,248
I met Debbie when she
was 14. I was 14 also .

668
00:41:58,373 --> 00:41:59,773
16 I joined the Marines.

669
00:42:01,712 --> 00:42:03,640
By 18 we were fully involved
in Move organization.

670
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,568
And by 22, we were doing
100 years in prison.

671
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,835
- [Student] Wow.

672
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:14,411
It was relatively a short time.

673
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,627
We did 40 years. We
just got out of prison.

674
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:21,843
I've been out of prison
for seven months.

675
00:42:21,961 --> 00:42:23,596
Debbie been out for 11.

676
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:26,696
- [Rich] Okay, so what
did you go away for?

677
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,732
- A confrontation in 1978 with
600 cops that had converged

678
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:31,946
on our home and
they attacked us.

679
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,203
And so out of that
case, we were charged,

680
00:42:37,909 --> 00:42:39,795
all charged with a
third degree murder.

681
00:42:41,374 --> 00:42:43,344
We were all sentenced
to 30 to 100 years.

682
00:42:49,182 --> 00:42:51,443
And after we were eligible for
parole first, 10 years ago,

683
00:42:55,945 --> 00:42:58,123
and they kept on giving us
hits, one, two year hits.

684
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:02,883
Well, I got one
five-year hit one time.

685
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:06,222
And anyway, throughout
that whole journey,

686
00:43:13,022 --> 00:43:14,667
a lot of people supported us.

687
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:16,243
A lot of people fought for us.

688
00:43:18,198 --> 00:43:20,460
None more than my son here.
And they brought us home.

689
00:43:24,127 --> 00:43:25,803
My name is Michael Africa Jr.

690
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,807
I'm a member of the
Move Organization.

691
00:43:28,009 --> 00:43:29,811
I've been a Move
member for a long time.

692
00:43:30,264 --> 00:43:32,233
I was actually born
in the organization.

693
00:43:34,523 --> 00:43:36,001
My mother and my
father are two members

694
00:43:36,025 --> 00:43:37,827
of the organization
as you just saw.

695
00:43:38,531 --> 00:43:40,082
My mother had me shortly after

696
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,837
the August 8th,
1978 confrontation,

697
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:45,301
when the police stormed
our home and you know,

698
00:43:46,088 --> 00:43:48,349
they shot the water cannons and
the tear gas and all of the,

699
00:43:50,722 --> 00:43:52,857
you know, these tactics that
they use to attack people.

700
00:43:54,605 --> 00:43:56,782
And they did all of
those things to our house

701
00:43:57,902 --> 00:43:58,630
and they arrested them.

702
00:43:58,654 --> 00:44:00,873
And I was born about a month
later in a prison cell.

703
00:44:03,956 --> 00:44:05,967
When I was born, my
grandmother came to get me

704
00:44:10,093 --> 00:44:11,895
from the prison or from
the hospital after.

705
00:44:12,932 --> 00:44:14,776
And we went to Virginia
where John Africa

706
00:44:18,986 --> 00:44:20,913
had what was called
Seed of Wisdom Chapter.

707
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,210
And that chapter was set
up so that Move children

708
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:27,927
could get away from the
confrontational atmosphere

709
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,193
in the city of Philadelphia.

710
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:32,395
And while we were there we
were trying to live peacefully.

711
00:44:35,018 --> 00:44:36,988
While we were there, the same
kind of situation happened

712
00:44:38,483 --> 00:44:40,745
where the police came and
raided our house there.

713
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,043
They arrested the
adults that were there.

714
00:44:45,038 --> 00:44:46,883
They put the children
in an orphanage.

715
00:44:47,961 --> 00:44:49,846
And myself along with
14 other children

716
00:44:53,973 --> 00:44:56,026
were in that orphanage for
11 days where we were abused,

717
00:45:00,903 --> 00:45:02,872
our hair was combed and
ripped out of our scalp.

718
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,682
We were grieving because
of the loss of our family.

719
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,608
And we would not eat,
when we would not eat,

720
00:45:17,227 --> 00:45:19,113
we were forced fed and
so forth and so on.

721
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:23,288
And eventually the people,
the adults that were arrested

722
00:45:25,243 --> 00:45:27,338
came to the orphanage and
they got us out of there,

723
00:45:28,082 --> 00:45:29,926
and they took us
back to Philadelphia.

724
00:45:31,214 --> 00:45:33,057
And when I was a young
child, my grandmother

725
00:45:37,476 --> 00:45:38,269
who I was living with,

726
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,197
she decided to leave
the organization.

727
00:45:40,649 --> 00:45:42,744
When she left the organization,
she took me with her.

728
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,459
while I was gone, my
cousins and I and my sister,

729
00:45:50,586 --> 00:45:52,597
we made a pact that
when we got old enough

730
00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:55,102
we were going to
come back to Move.

731
00:45:55,303 --> 00:45:57,398
At the time I think I was
about five or six years old,

732
00:45:58,477 --> 00:46:00,613
but I was determined
because I always loved Move.

733
00:46:03,653 --> 00:46:05,299
I always loved the
teaching of John Africa.

734
00:46:05,323 --> 00:46:07,334
I always loved my family,
and the separation

735
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:10,716
was more than I was
willing to accept.

736
00:46:12,087 --> 00:46:13,487
So we made that decision

737
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:17,271
that we were gonna come back
to Move when we got old enough.

738
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:20,751
(water burbling)

739
00:46:32,377 --> 00:46:33,777
(bomb blasting)

740
00:46:51,248 --> 00:46:53,217
- [Steven] What was that
sound Harvey? Can you tell us?

741
00:46:53,712 --> 00:46:55,442
- [Harvey] I can't
tell you, Steven.

742
00:46:55,466 --> 00:46:56,401
- [Steven] Why not?

743
00:46:56,425 --> 00:46:58,364
{\an7}- It's heavy. And I don't
even know it was a gunshot.

744
00:46:58,388 --> 00:47:00,231
It almost sound
like an explosion.

745
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,454
- [Interviewer] Could
have been the lobbing

746
00:47:01,478 --> 00:47:02,915
of a tear gas canister.

747
00:47:02,939 --> 00:47:03,666
- I don't think so.

748
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,086
Tear gas doesn't make
that kind of sound,

749
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:06,662
that shook the whole block.

750
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:22,902
(dramatic music)

751
00:47:39,511 --> 00:47:41,606
- In 1985, they came out to
our home, attacked our home,

752
00:47:45,816 --> 00:47:47,869
and they dropped a
bomb on our house.

753
00:47:49,531 --> 00:47:51,083
That bomb ignited a fire,

754
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,339
within the fire was
61 homes in the area.

755
00:47:58,549 --> 00:48:00,770
But within the house where
the bomb was dropped on,

756
00:48:00,846 --> 00:48:03,024
where the fire was raising
was 13 Move members.

757
00:48:05,105 --> 00:48:07,324
Of the 13 move members, 11
of them perished in the fire.

758
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:12,375
The lone adult survivor,
who is Ramona Africa,

759
00:48:14,749 --> 00:48:16,383
she was arrested for that.

760
00:48:17,671 --> 00:48:18,691
And she was put in prison

761
00:48:18,715 --> 00:48:20,600
and she spent seven
years in prison.

762
00:48:21,345 --> 00:48:23,273
Birdie Africa, who was
the lone child survivor,

763
00:48:24,852 --> 00:48:26,738
he was taken away
from the organization,

764
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:30,245
and I never saw him
again in person.

765
00:48:32,617 --> 00:48:34,628
But Ramona who went to prison,
she was actually an inmate

766
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:39,221
at the same prison
that my mom was at,

767
00:48:39,966 --> 00:48:41,893
when Ramona was set to
be released from prison

768
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,398
after that seven year
prison term, my grandmother

769
00:48:45,937 --> 00:48:48,155
and my sisters, we talked about
asking my mom to ask Ramona

770
00:48:53,702 --> 00:48:55,629
if she would come
and pick us up.

771
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,967
And at this point
we were looking

772
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,471
for that opportunity
that we talked

773
00:49:00,673 --> 00:49:02,028
about to come back to Move.

774
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:04,272
And Ramona came out of
prison, the very next day

775
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:07,485
that she got out, she
actually did come and get me.

776
00:49:09,274 --> 00:49:10,826
She took me to Mo Africa,

777
00:49:12,697 --> 00:49:14,542
who is another member
of the organization.

778
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,724
She took me to his house.

779
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:18,018
And when I went to his house,

780
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:20,261
I began to remember the
things that I forgot about.

781
00:49:23,344 --> 00:49:25,229
I remembered the smell
of the Move houses

782
00:49:25,723 --> 00:49:27,525
and the children
and the seeing them.

783
00:49:28,479 --> 00:49:30,042
And you know, because
I was gone away

784
00:49:30,066 --> 00:49:31,419
from that for nine years.

785
00:49:31,443 --> 00:49:33,537
And as a child I couldn't
remember all of those things,

786
00:49:34,408 --> 00:49:36,543
so she took me there and I fell
in love with that nostalgia.

787
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:47,565
I couldn't believe
that I loved it so much

788
00:49:49,771 --> 00:49:51,573
and I couldn't tear
myself away from it.

789
00:49:53,779 --> 00:49:54,757
I wanted to be there again.

790
00:49:54,781 --> 00:49:56,583
I wanted to come
back the next day.

791
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:58,587
And from then on I was there,

792
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:01,093
and I started working on
the case for my parents

793
00:50:02,797 --> 00:50:04,599
and finding out what
was going on with them.

794
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,603
And I learned that they
had 100 years of prison

795
00:50:07,182 --> 00:50:08,911
and I started
working on that case.

796
00:50:08,935 --> 00:50:10,540
And it was very natural.

797
00:50:10,564 --> 00:50:12,408
The transition was
very natural, you know.

798
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:14,996
And speaking about
their case, you know,

799
00:50:16,701 --> 00:50:18,628
somebody said to me they
said you were born in prison,

800
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:21,770
and then you went
back to the prison

801
00:50:21,794 --> 00:50:23,357
to get your parents
out of prison.

802
00:50:23,381 --> 00:50:25,308
You know, and that's
what I've been doing.

803
00:50:26,178 --> 00:50:27,771
That time from 1992 up to 2018.

804
00:50:30,353 --> 00:50:31,947
We talk about natural law.

805
00:50:34,779 --> 00:50:36,663
We talked about diet,
eating healthy, right?

806
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:41,591
The essence of John
Africa's teaching

807
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:44,555
is self, take care of yourself.

808
00:50:48,723 --> 00:50:50,817
When you take care of yourself,
all of the things that we do

809
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,703
as revolutionaries is
really all in that.

810
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:02,382
If you think about self and
you take care of yourself,

811
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:05,274
you don't have to
think about trying

812
00:51:05,298 --> 00:51:07,225
to be an activist
for the environment.

813
00:51:07,427 --> 00:51:09,605
You don't have to try to
think about being an activist

814
00:51:10,183 --> 00:51:10,933
for political prisoners.

815
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:13,154
You don't have to think
about activism for animals.

816
00:51:13,189 --> 00:51:15,659
If you just think
about yourself, that
covers everything,

817
00:51:17,781 --> 00:51:19,667
because you're connected
to the environment.

818
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,132
And if you know that you
need the air to breathe,

819
00:51:23,835 --> 00:51:25,761
why would you allow the
system to create things

820
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:28,945
that pollute the air?

821
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:30,772
Why would you allow
a system that builds

822
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:34,488
atomic plants on the
river, when the river

823
00:51:35,817 --> 00:51:37,410
is where your water comes from?

824
00:51:47,883 --> 00:51:49,309
(blender whirring)

825
00:52:38,734 --> 00:52:40,134
(grater grinding)

826
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:48,219
(blender whirring)

827
00:53:59,062 --> 00:54:00,613
- [Man] WRTI maybe have one.

828
00:54:04,448 --> 00:54:06,081
Good judge who have no time.

829
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,171
They may not be integral,
it last a long time.

830
00:54:13,924 --> 00:54:15,324

831
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:41,445
♪ Lord we come to you
our hearts with urgency ♪

832
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:47,999

(upbeat instrumental music)

836
00:55:22,436 --> 00:55:24,406
- [Julian] Hey, Rich,
no shoes in the house.

837
00:55:25,067 --> 00:55:27,243
- Come on, Jules, man, I spend
the whole day with my shoes.

838
00:55:28,198 --> 00:55:28,925
You're killing me y'all.

839
00:55:28,949 --> 00:55:30,178
- [Old Head] No
shoes in the house.

840
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:31,429
- [Julian] Wait, we
went through this.

841
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,016
- No, man, I thought
this was supposed

842
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,061
to be like some type of anarchy

843
00:55:34,085 --> 00:55:35,856
where we policing
ourselves, man.

844
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,774
There's no point in (indistinct)

845
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:39,018
- We are policing ourselves,
last week we all agreed

846
00:55:39,971 --> 00:55:40,699
no shoes in the house.

847
00:55:40,723 --> 00:55:42,452
Look, I'm trying to keep up
with my grandmother's house.

848
00:55:42,476 --> 00:55:43,453
Can you please help me out here?

849
00:55:43,477 --> 00:55:45,364
- All right, man, all
right, just relax, man.

850
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,085
- Thank you.

851
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,420
- [Old Head] There's
no shoes in the house.

852
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:48,844
- Yo, I heard him. Damn.

853
00:55:49,658 --> 00:55:51,638
- And Janet, what was
wrong with you making all

854
00:55:51,662 --> 00:55:52,471
that noise last night?

855
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:54,632
Yo, you like this big making
a whole bunch of noise.

856
00:55:55,294 --> 00:55:57,096
Are you like wrestling
day up there?

857
00:55:57,131 --> 00:55:58,025
- [Janet] What do you mean?

858
00:55:58,049 --> 00:56:00,238
- You're messing up my
meditation, I can't focus.

859
00:56:00,262 --> 00:56:02,189
- [Janet] Since when
do you meditate, Rich?

860
00:56:02,515 --> 00:56:03,912
- [Rich] Since when
do you pay attention?

861
00:56:03,936 --> 00:56:05,905
I always meditate. I've
been on my new chapter.

862
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:08,467
- [Janet] Oh, okay.

863
00:56:08,527 --> 00:56:10,288
- [Stephanie] Hey, everybody.

864
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:12,333
- [Everybody] Hey, Stephanie.

865
00:56:13,246 --> 00:56:15,173
- [Julian] Well, could
you take your shoes off?

866
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:16,103
We said no shoes in the house.

867
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,521
- Julian, I've had
such a long day,

868
00:56:17,545 --> 00:56:19,347
like I don't wanna
do this with you.

869
00:56:19,718 --> 00:56:20,527
- Okay, you know what?

870
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:21,656
It seems like
everybody's tripping

871
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,524
about this no
shoes in the house.

872
00:56:23,557 --> 00:56:25,359
I thought about this,
and maybe it needs

873
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:26,539
to be a more affirming statement

874
00:56:26,563 --> 00:56:28,365
because we reached
consensus last week.

875
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:30,913
So maybe we should try,
We are, a shoeless house.

876
00:56:35,123 --> 00:56:36,101
Can we say that together?

877
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:38,053
- [Everybody] We're
a shoeless House.

878
00:56:38,587 --> 00:56:40,389
- We all agree to it,
so like let's do it.

879
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:42,019
- Okay, we got it, shoes off.

880
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:43,574
- Okay, yes, thank you.

881
00:56:43,598 --> 00:56:45,203
- I will hang this up.

882
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:46,121
- Okay, we're waiting for,

883
00:56:46,145 --> 00:56:48,281
- [Patricia] Hey, everybody.
- Oh, there she is.

884
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:50,494
- [Everybody] Hi, Patricia.

885
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:52,413
- Great, okay, now
everybody is here,

886
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,417
can we please get started?

887
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:56,392
- [Julian] Shoes.

888
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:57,143
Thank you so much.

889
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:59,136
- Okay great, shoes are
off, can we get started?

890
00:56:59,255 --> 00:57:00,806
- [Julian] Yeah, we're all here.

891
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:01,633
- Okay, great.

892
00:57:01,634 --> 00:57:03,520
So I called the
meeting into order.

893
00:57:04,683 --> 00:57:06,860
I just wanna go over
last week to the minutes.

894
00:57:07,645 --> 00:57:09,532
Item one, we
collectively have decided

895
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,453
and settled no shoes in
the house, so that's done.

896
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:16,713
Number two, we came to a
consensus about shared chores.

897
00:57:18,585 --> 00:57:20,469
So I came up with a
schedule. Everybody take one.

898
00:57:23,677 --> 00:57:25,408
We've got cooking,
cleaning, shopping.

899
00:57:25,432 --> 00:57:27,483
It's seven days a week, and
I've assigned everybody.

900
00:57:29,106 --> 00:57:31,337
- [Rich] No, no, wait, I see
you got me here on Sunday,

901
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:33,495
Yo, I can't work Sunday, man,
it's a Sabbath, you know that,

902
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:35,846
I can't do that.

903
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:36,764
- [Gwen] Okay look, we're just

904
00:57:36,788 --> 00:57:38,016
gonna have to bypass
that right now.

905
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,967
You can find someone
to work or trade with.

906
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:42,932
- Look, I'll cover it
for Rich on Sundays.

907
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:44,977
- Okay fine, good
for him if you want.

908
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:47,149
Okay. So as you can
see, we're doubled up.

909
00:57:47,518 --> 00:57:49,445
So I have like, you
know, Rich and Julian

910
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:53,579
or Patricia and
Gwen, for example.

911
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:55,624
So that means you're
going every other week.

912
00:57:58,039 --> 00:57:58,682
- Okay.

913
00:57:58,706 --> 00:58:00,549
- Yeah. So everybody's
okay with that?

914
00:58:00,669 --> 00:58:01,605
We are on the same page?

915
00:58:01,629 --> 00:58:02,357
- [Everybody] Yeah.

916
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:03,818
- Also, Stephanie
helped to design.

917
00:58:03,842 --> 00:58:04,735
- Okay. Well thank you.

918
00:58:04,759 --> 00:58:06,855
I know you worked really
hard on this and Stephanie

919
00:58:07,391 --> 00:58:08,536
so thank you all so much.

920
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,960
(everybody applauding)

921
00:58:11,273 --> 00:58:11,834
Thank you.

922
00:58:11,858 --> 00:58:14,077
Okay, so next, I know a
couple of a month ago or so,

923
00:58:15,156 --> 00:58:17,000
we talked about
having an RPR library.

924
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,765
At first it was gonna
be in the back room,

925
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:21,520
but Rich moved in
there, all right

926
00:58:21,544 --> 00:58:23,471
So we need to put the
library somewhere else.

927
00:58:24,633 --> 00:58:25,570
So where can we put it?

928
00:58:25,594 --> 00:58:27,603
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
What does RPR mean again?

929
00:58:28,683 --> 00:58:30,610
- The revolutionary
people's reading room.

930
00:58:30,812 --> 00:58:32,212
- [Gwen] Yep.

931
00:58:32,399 --> 00:58:33,251
- Okay.

932
00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:33,794
- Okay.

933
00:58:33,818 --> 00:58:35,954
- All right. So where do
we think we could put it?

934
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:37,624
Can't be in the back room now.

935
00:58:37,826 --> 00:58:39,628
- [Jamel] Why not
put it in here?

936
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:42,760
Just add a few more
bookshelves and chairs,

937
00:58:44,131 --> 00:58:45,318
make it really simple.

938
00:58:45,342 --> 00:58:46,445
- Sounds good.

939
00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:47,655
- Yeah, I mean, I'm not trying

940
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,117
to be a counter-revolutionary
anything,

941
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:51,026
but like having random
strangers in here,

942
00:58:51,938 --> 00:58:53,740
lounging around
reading, doing whatever.

943
00:58:53,858 --> 00:58:55,660
I don't know if we
wanna have much privacy.

944
00:58:57,699 --> 00:58:58,970
- I'm okay with it

945
00:58:58,994 --> 00:58:59,846
- [Janet] Yeah.

946
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:00,598
- It's fine.

947
00:59:00,622 --> 00:59:02,674
- Okay, so it sounds like
we've reached the consensus

948
00:59:03,879 --> 00:59:05,764
that we'll have the
RPR in the living room.

949
00:59:06,927 --> 00:59:07,862
- [Old Head] Yes.

950
00:59:07,886 --> 00:59:09,688
- Okay, so moving
on, we also talked

951
00:59:11,477 --> 00:59:13,696
about having a big event, a
consciousness raising event here

952
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,329
to kind of introduce
us to the community.

953
00:59:17,531 --> 00:59:19,458
Let's decide if we want
a speaker like a poet,

954
00:59:21,664 --> 00:59:22,892
a musician, like somebody.

955
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:24,646
And let's remember, I
just wanna point out,

956
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,899
we wanna integrate
and not alienate.

957
00:59:25,923 --> 00:59:28,142
So we wanna come. Old
Head, go ahead, go ahead.

958
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:30,688
- [Old Head] Okay, I
got a boy named Harold

959
00:59:30,932 --> 00:59:32,734
who runs the AACG
right down the street.

960
00:59:33,938 --> 00:59:35,532
- [Gwen] What is that?

961
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,201
The African-American Gun Club.

962
00:59:37,529 --> 00:59:38,882
Hold up, he is the president

963
00:59:38,906 --> 00:59:40,458
of the Philly town (indistinct).

964
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,671
Hold up, hold up. I say,
listen, listen listen.

965
00:59:43,207 --> 00:59:44,937
- [Julian] Hear
him out. Come on.

966
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:46,930
- We have him come
here, speak to us.

967
00:59:46,964 --> 00:59:49,100
Teach us about gun safety
and responsibility.

968
00:59:50,304 --> 00:59:50,948
- [Gwen] Okay.

969
00:59:50,972 --> 00:59:52,076
- Let's have him
come her speak to us.

970
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,122
- [Gwen] Look, I hear you,
I just kind of feel like

971
00:59:54,146 --> 00:59:56,324
we might want our starting
point to be a bit more peaceful

972
00:59:58,738 --> 00:59:59,298
for our first-

973
00:59:59,322 --> 01:00:00,885
- No, no, wait, I
don't know if you

974
01:00:00,909 --> 01:00:02,722
ain't been paying
attention to the news,

975
01:00:02,746 --> 01:00:04,017
but shit ain't safe out there.

976
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:04,976
This shit is for real yo.

977
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,396
- Look, I hear you. I got you.

978
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,306
I'm just saying
it's our first one.

979
01:00:09,008 --> 01:00:10,560
So if we're gonna bring people

980
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,615
in to what we're trying to do,

981
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:13,524
we should just do it
in a more peaceful way,

982
01:00:13,768 --> 01:00:14,496
just to begin with.

983
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,790
- We're getting
killed out there.

984
01:00:15,814 --> 01:00:17,824
- [Rich] Yeah, no lie Gwen,
for real, like more men

985
01:00:17,901 --> 01:00:19,338
are getting killed
with their hands up

986
01:00:19,362 --> 01:00:20,257
than their they arms out.

987
01:00:20,281 --> 01:00:22,459
- Martin Luther King Jr, walked
around with a gun, right?

988
01:00:23,705 --> 01:00:24,891
Then why don't we?

989
01:00:24,915 --> 01:00:26,885
Let's get Harold in here
and let's have him talk to-

990
01:00:29,299 --> 01:00:30,069
- [Gwen] Just not now.

991
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:32,437
- No, no, no, no, no, no. My
sister died on the streets.

992
01:00:36,062 --> 01:00:37,656
This ain't no joke.

993
01:00:38,066 --> 01:00:39,952
You saw what happened
to Move. Right?

994
01:00:42,074 --> 01:00:43,584
Y'all need to grow up.

995
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:45,630
(dramatic music)

996
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:16,494
- [Rich] Nah, nah, look,
look, I'm telling you,

997
01:01:16,518 --> 01:01:17,246
this ain't gonna work.

998
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,541
This is what we should
do, we should throw

999
01:01:18,565 --> 01:01:20,210
a community black party, we
should get like a whole lot

1000
01:01:20,234 --> 01:01:22,454
of kids involved, get a DJs,
some strippers and like-

1001
01:01:23,908 --> 01:01:25,308
(everybody booing)

1002
01:01:25,954 --> 01:01:27,756
- That's way too
ratchet and fluff, like-

1003
01:01:28,209 --> 01:01:30,094
- [Rich] Who do you
call ratchet and fluffy?

1004
01:01:31,172 --> 01:01:32,150
- She is not, she is just...

1005
01:01:32,174 --> 01:01:34,227
- Nah, yo, every time she
starts to bring up something

1006
01:01:34,471 --> 01:01:36,158
she's always on me
like it's about me.

1007
01:01:36,182 --> 01:01:37,985
- Have you guys not
seen it ratchet?

1008
01:01:39,188 --> 01:01:40,166
- Hey, yo, check your girl.

1009
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:42,076
(background noise
drowns out speaker)

1010
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:45,678
(trumpet blowing)

1011
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,963
- You know, that rap it's
just a bunch of noise anyway.

1012
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:52,096
- That's coming from the dude
who plays the trumpet all day?

1013
01:01:53,134 --> 01:01:53,861
I'm not hearing it.

1014
01:01:53,885 --> 01:01:55,698
- On that note though,
I do think that music

1015
01:01:55,722 --> 01:01:57,122
would be a good idea.

1016
01:01:57,768 --> 01:01:59,319
- [Patricia] I think Jamel here

1017
01:02:01,024 --> 01:02:02,210
and Old Head should
play something.

1018
01:02:02,234 --> 01:02:04,329
- [Julian] Okay. That's the
step in the right direction.

1019
01:02:06,242 --> 01:02:07,179
- [Janet] I have an idea.

1020
01:02:07,203 --> 01:02:08,097
- [Julian] Go ahead, Janet,

1021
01:02:08,121 --> 01:02:09,934
I know you've been
trying to get it.

1022
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:11,927
- Thank you, so I
was looking around

1023
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,487
at your grandmother's
book and I noticed

1024
01:02:15,511 --> 01:02:17,438
that she had a lot of
poetry by Sonia Sanchez.

1025
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,113
What if we invite her to
read some of her poems?

1026
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,287
- [Gwen] She is a
phenomenal poet.

1027
01:02:26,282 --> 01:02:28,084
- and she's based
here in Philadelphia.

1028
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,214
- [Julian] Yeah, you know what?
I think that's a great idea.

1029
01:02:42,523 --> 01:02:44,034
(upbeat music)

1030

for the great Harriet Tubman,

1033
01:03:56,212 --> 01:03:58,264
as some people called her
General Tubman in those days.

1034

"Picture a woman riding
thunder on the legs of slavery.

1035
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:09,036
Picture her kissing
our spine saying no

1036
01:04:10,324 --> 01:04:11,724
to the eyes of slavery.

Picture her right with
seasons of legs running.

01:04:38,546 --> 01:04:40,432
Picture her tasting the
secret corners of words.

Picture her saying you have
within you the strength,

01:04:47,022 --> 01:04:48,908
the patients and
the passion to reach

1046

change the world.

Imagine her words.

1048
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:57,466
Every great dream
begins with a dreamer.

1049

Imagine her saying I
freed a thousand slaves,

1050
01:05:02,929 --> 01:05:04,564
could have freed
a thousand more,

1051
01:05:04,682 --> 01:05:06,651
if they only knew
they were slaves.

1052
01:05:08,231 --> 01:05:09,292

for this freedom quilt.

1056
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:20,304
Picture her saying a live
runaway could do great harm

1057
01:05:24,514 --> 01:05:26,566
by going back, but a dead
runaway could tell no secrets.

1058

Picture the daylight bringing
her to woods full of baboons.

1059

her hands three times saying,

Picture her saying no to a
play called Uncle Tom's Cabin,

1064
01:05:54,907 --> 01:05:56,500
I am the real thing.

freedom refrains.

Two Belgian cops of looking
on rather suspiciously.

1087
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:19,495
- Friends, the white
man have invented

1088
01:08:21,074 --> 01:08:23,336
a lot of things and brought
them here to our country.

1089

Good things and bad things.

1090
01:08:28,004 --> 01:08:30,058
I won't stop to talk about
the bad things today,

1091
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,397
but take it from me, friends,
the good thing is beer.

1092
01:08:37,607 --> 01:08:39,826
My advice to you is to drink,
drink and drink some more.

1093
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,211
Come to think of it,
do they leave us free

1094
01:08:45,916 --> 01:08:47,316
to do anything else?

1095
01:08:47,795 --> 01:08:49,846
If we get together, we end in
jail. hold a meeting, jail.

1096
01:08:52,471 --> 01:08:54,774
write an article, jail. Try
to leave the country, Jail.

1097
01:08:58,984 --> 01:09:01,036
The more of the same, but
you don't have to take

1098
01:09:01,071 --> 01:09:02,998
my word for it,
use your own eyes.

1099
01:09:06,374 --> 01:09:08,718
Now I've been talking to you
now for about 15 minutes,

1100
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:12,892
and their cops don't
even interfere.

1101
01:09:13,262 --> 01:09:15,565
I've been doing the country
from Stanleyville to Katanga

1102
01:09:17,604 --> 01:09:19,489
and their cops haven't
even bothered me.

1103
01:09:21,153 --> 01:09:22,912
Why? Because I'm selling beer.

1104
01:09:24,576 --> 01:09:26,796
Yes, you could say that
here in Congo, a mug of beer

1105
01:09:31,006 --> 01:09:33,058
is the symbol of all rights
and liberties, but not so fast.

1106
01:09:37,978 --> 01:09:39,541
Same as there are
different races

1107
01:09:39,565 --> 01:09:41,450
in one of the same
country, that's right,

1108

Flemings and their Walloons,

1109

and everybody knows there's
nothing worse than the Flemish.

1110
01:09:49,793 --> 01:09:51,553
Ah, there are different
kinds of beer.

1111
01:09:53,008 --> 01:09:54,935
Different races and
families of beer.

1112
01:09:56,432 --> 01:09:57,983
And I have come here to tell you

1113
01:09:59,062 --> 01:10:00,613
about the best beer; polar beer.

1114
01:10:03,194 --> 01:10:04,996
Polar, the freshness
of the poles

1115
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,462
in the heat of the tropics.

1116
01:10:13,424 --> 01:10:15,643
- Sure, but I hear that
polar makes a man impotent,

1117
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:19,024
takes away his gigolo,
What do you say to that?

1118
01:10:19,603 --> 01:10:21,530
- [Old Head] That's
a myth crack citizen.

1119
01:10:21,941 --> 01:10:23,868
If I wanted to give
you a mean answer,

1120
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:25,799
I'll tell you to
lend me your wife

1121
01:10:25,823 --> 01:10:27,375

- (laughs) He's
got what it takes.

1125
01:10:35,258 --> 01:10:37,270
- [Old Head] But why not
ask those girls over there?

1126
01:10:37,472 --> 01:10:39,775
Those lovely little girls,
we'll put it up to them.

1127
01:10:40,812 --> 01:10:43,072
What about it, girls? You
with the beaming smiles.

1128
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,247
you with the smooth
snake bellies.

1129
01:10:47,617 --> 01:10:49,084
You tell us what's what?

1130
01:10:50,832 --> 01:10:52,232
- [Gwen] Girls singing.

1131
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:54,554
Women smooth as mirrors.
Bodies without guile.

1132
01:10:56,343 --> 01:10:58,312
Honey fritters hair,
a shimmering water.

1133
01:10:59,683 --> 01:11:01,610
Too ripe and flawless
papayas for breasts.

01:11:06,404 --> 01:11:08,040
(crowd applauding)

1136
01:11:10,872 --> 01:11:12,272
- Not too bad spiel.

1137
01:11:12,792 --> 01:11:14,678
He's got a tongue in
his head, I suppose so,

1138
01:11:18,888 --> 01:11:20,857
but it's gotten me
worried that beer mug

1139
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:22,663
of his is a grab bag.

1140
01:11:22,687 --> 01:11:24,949
You never know what he's
gonna pull out of it next.

1141
01:11:25,358 --> 01:11:27,579
I've got a good mind to ask
him a couple of questions.

1142
01:11:32,165 --> 01:11:34,092
Watch your step,
we can't interfere

1143
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:37,180
with the sale of polar beer.

1144
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,519
Don't you know who owns polar?

1145
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:42,411
- [Old Head] How should I?

1146
01:11:42,435 --> 01:11:44,446
All I know is, that
nigga is dangerous.

1147
01:11:47,402 --> 01:11:49,038
You're young, just listen to me.

1148
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:53,046
The minister is behind
polar. That's right.

1149
01:11:55,418 --> 01:11:57,680
The minister of the Congo
knocks you for a loop bay

1150
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:03,943
- From the top, assign

about indignation and panic.

1155

They have just heard through
indiscretion that ACLU members

1156
01:12:23,142 --> 01:12:25,276
request the Belgian
government has set the date

1157
01:12:25,478 --> 01:12:27,449
for Congolese independence
at June 30th, 1960.

1158
01:12:29,738 --> 01:12:31,623
- We're screwed, our
government are traitors

1159
01:12:33,078 --> 01:12:34,629
has given away our empire.

1160
01:12:35,124 --> 01:12:37,051
- They have set the date
for the independence.

1161
01:12:37,502 --> 01:12:39,598
- [Gwen] They've knuckled
under that baboon.

You've got to wed the
spirit of the times.

1164
01:12:46,605 --> 01:12:48,574
I don't say love her,
it's enough to wed her.

1165
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:54,920
There's nothing so frightening
about this independence.

1166
01:12:55,331 --> 01:12:57,258
Oh, so he's kind of
more chilled about it?

1167
01:12:57,585 --> 01:12:58,520
He's not as worried?

1168
01:12:58,544 --> 01:13:00,346
- [Gwen] Yeah, yeah.
You need to, yeah.

1169

1174
01:13:09,566 --> 01:13:11,297
- [Gwen] yeah,
just be more, yeah.

1175

1184
01:15:09,599 --> 01:15:11,526
Yo, coming, just give
me a second, please.

about a lot of like
historical events

1193
01:16:10,804 --> 01:16:12,731
that I wouldn't have
otherwise encountered.

1194
01:16:13,477 --> 01:16:15,737
For example, learning about
like the Move Organization.

1195
01:16:17,943 --> 01:16:19,996
And then I feel like it's
kind of like leads you

1196
01:16:20,491 --> 01:16:21,427
down this like cycle hole,

1197
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:22,721
'cause like you learn
about one thing,

1198
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,755
which then like pushes
you in another direction,

1199
01:16:25,959 --> 01:16:27,761
and it leads to a
lot of like, I guess,

1200
01:16:28,548 --> 01:16:30,099
personal kind of questioning,

1201
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:33,523
but then also just like
individual work as well.

1202
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:38,032
(smooth trumpet music)
(Rich breathes heavily)

1203
01:16:44,747 --> 01:16:45,725
(door knocking)

1204
01:16:45,749 --> 01:16:47,301
- Yo, man, hurry up, man.

1205
01:16:47,753 --> 01:16:49,805
Five minute limit, dude,
unless you wanna toilet. Damn.

1206
01:16:54,892 --> 01:16:56,292
(smooth trumpet music)

1207
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:57,373
(Rich sighs loudly)

1208
01:16:57,397 --> 01:16:59,617
I gotta shit man. Man, come
on, what are you doing?

1209
01:17:02,658 --> 01:17:04,058
(door knocking)

1210
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:08,843
- Yo, what are...

1211
01:17:09,045 --> 01:17:10,567
You got a trumpet in there?

1212
01:17:10,591 --> 01:17:12,027
You're playing the
trumpet in the bathroom?

1213
01:17:12,051 --> 01:17:13,531
What are you doing bro?

1214
01:17:13,555 --> 01:17:14,365
- I like the acoustics.

1215
01:17:14,389 --> 01:17:15,941
- [Rich] you like the ac...

1216
01:17:16,102 --> 01:17:18,029
- The bathroom is for
ass acoustics, bro.

1217
01:17:18,106 --> 01:17:19,740
Ass acoustics only.

1218
01:17:35,265 --> 01:17:37,192
- Your boy Rich is
really out of hand,

1219
01:17:38,396 --> 01:17:39,948
and you consistently enable him.

1220
01:17:41,109 --> 01:17:42,839
You just sit there
and defend him,

1221
01:17:42,863 --> 01:17:44,790
like he doesn't know
what he's saying.

1222
01:17:45,117 --> 01:17:46,095
- Oh, what am I supposed to do?

1223
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:47,921
Rich and I go way
back, you know this,

1224
01:17:48,123 --> 01:17:49,895
is not like I can just
like kick him out.

1225
01:17:49,919 --> 01:17:51,972
- I hear you, but you also
can't excuse his behavior.

1226
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:55,532
He comes in, he's
rude to people.

1227
01:17:55,556 --> 01:17:57,326
He tells people to
shut the fuck up

1228
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:59,152
and our meeting
includes Sonia Sanchez,

1229
01:18:01,149 --> 01:18:02,712
which is completely
unacceptable.

1230
01:18:02,736 --> 01:18:03,631
- [Julian] Agree. I agree.

1231
01:18:03,655 --> 01:18:05,875
- So you can't just sit
there and be like, Oh well.

1232
01:18:06,452 --> 01:18:08,337
- [Julian] I'm not,
look, people were coming

1233
01:18:08,582 --> 01:18:10,645
from different life experiences,
different lifestyles,

1234
01:18:10,669 --> 01:18:12,930
and we can't force people to
get where we need them to be.

1235
01:18:13,758 --> 01:18:15,028
We need to embrace
where they are-

1236
01:18:15,052 --> 01:18:16,938
- Yeah, and correct
them when they're wrong.

1237
01:18:17,307 --> 01:18:18,983
You can't keep babying him.

1238
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:21,291
- [Julian] I'm not babying him.

1239
01:18:21,315 --> 01:18:23,159
- You're the one
that wanted him here.

1240
01:18:24,028 --> 01:18:25,915
He bypassed the entire
interview process,

1241
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,723
and he's not even
making that much

1242
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:30,183
of a contribution to the house.

1243
01:18:30,207 --> 01:18:32,009
And I'm pretty sure
he's been stealing

1244
01:18:32,295 --> 01:18:34,264
from the non-community
section of the fridge.

1245
01:18:34,634 --> 01:18:36,519
The other day, Janet
had a whole jar

1246
01:18:37,347 --> 01:18:38,826
of Spirulina go missing.

1247
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:40,203
- [Julian] Well, how
do you know what's him?

1248
01:18:40,227 --> 01:18:41,205
You can't just accuse people.

1249
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:42,500
- because she asked
him and he said, no,

1250
01:18:42,524 --> 01:18:44,785
but she noticed he had a
green stain on his shirt.

1251
01:18:45,155 --> 01:18:47,039
What was he doing
with it, anyway?

1252
01:18:47,617 --> 01:18:49,545
You know what? It
doesn't even matter.

1253
01:18:50,165 --> 01:18:51,476
You need to hold him accountable

1254
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,470
and really assess
your own behavior.

1255
01:18:53,797 --> 01:18:55,975
- [Julian] Okay, I already
said I'm gonna hold

1256
01:18:56,009 --> 01:18:57,237
myself more accountable.

1257
01:18:57,261 --> 01:18:58,813
- Just take a minute.

1258
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:15,362
(Gwen sighs loudly)

1259
01:19:28,156 --> 01:19:30,126
- [Janet] I'm actually
really interested in music

1260
01:19:30,245 --> 01:19:32,255
and learning more about music
history and especially jazz.

1261
01:19:34,335 --> 01:19:36,388
And I don't know if you have
any advice on where to start.

1262
01:19:42,101 --> 01:19:43,986
- [Jamel] There's this
real amazing album

1263
01:19:45,691 --> 01:19:47,243
by Max Roach and Oscar Brown Jr.

1264
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:50,834
And Oscar Brown of
course, does his thing,

1265
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:54,685
really great lyrics.

1266
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:56,637
But really the whole
album is about freedom

1267
01:19:58,509 --> 01:20:00,436
and the music, you know
and how Abbey Lincoln

1268
01:20:03,895 --> 01:20:05,295
is singing his lyrics.

1269
01:20:07,527 --> 01:20:09,371
It's about like
feeling how she moans,

1270
01:20:13,121 --> 01:20:14,965
how the hysterical
nature of all the things

1271
01:20:17,421 --> 01:20:19,223
that happened with the
drums, the trumpet,

1272
01:20:21,054 --> 01:20:23,231
you know the rhythms, just
represents true freedom.

1273
01:20:29,654 --> 01:20:31,916
It's just when you're feeling
something so overwhelming,

1274
01:20:38,463 --> 01:20:39,863
at least for me.

1275
01:20:41,261 --> 01:20:43,189
So I guess I would start
there if I were you.

1276
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:52,457
- Thank you for
your recommendation.

1277
01:20:53,369 --> 01:20:55,295
All of that really
resonates with me.

1278
01:20:59,924 --> 01:21:01,475
That was actually beautiful.

1279
01:21:04,892 --> 01:21:06,443
- Yeah, it's great album.

1280
01:21:06,938 --> 01:21:08,865
I can talk about that
all the time, you know?

1281
01:21:09,067 --> 01:21:11,035
- Yeah, I'm definitely
going to listen to it,

1282
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:14,333
so I can really hold a
conversation with you about it.

1283
01:21:18,293 --> 01:21:20,179
- I mean, we got
into this together.

1284
01:21:21,549 --> 01:21:23,351
- Yeah. I really
like that. I'm down.

- welcome to House of Ubuntu.

1295
01:25:34,053 --> 01:25:35,241
Thank you so much
for being here.

1296
01:25:35,265 --> 01:25:37,035
This is the first
of what we hope

1297
01:25:37,059 --> 01:25:38,289
to be many community events.

1298
01:25:38,313 --> 01:25:40,574
I'm not gonna be too long,
I don't wanna say too much.

1299
01:25:41,067 --> 01:25:43,163
But I just wanna say a few
words before we get started.

1300
01:25:44,367 --> 01:25:46,586
First and foremost I just wanna
acknowledge my grandmother.

1301
01:25:50,796 --> 01:25:52,765
My late grandmother,
Elaine Johnson.

1302
01:25:53,009 --> 01:25:54,893
Oh, thank you.
(audience applauding)

1303
01:25:55,095 --> 01:25:57,149
This was her house and
this would not be possible

1304
01:25:57,935 --> 01:25:59,821
without her, and you
know, she's an ancestor.

1305
01:26:00,105 --> 01:26:01,908
So just wanna take a
moment to say thank you.

1306
01:26:04,281 --> 01:26:06,542
Second, there is a wonderful
woman who is here with us,

1307
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:10,718
my partner, Gwen,
and yes lets...

1308
01:26:12,255 --> 01:26:13,890
(audience applauding)

1309
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:18,441
Like with so many movements,

1310
01:26:18,977 --> 01:26:21,114
with so many thriving
communities, women
are the backbone.

1311
01:26:21,983 --> 01:26:23,994
And if it weren't for Gwen,
none of us would be here.

1312
01:26:24,948 --> 01:26:26,833
Her vision for this
space, it came from her.

1313
01:26:27,494 --> 01:26:29,463
So thank you so much,
Gwen, you're my heart.

1314
01:26:32,045 --> 01:26:33,445
(audience applauding)

1315
01:26:35,845 --> 01:26:37,782
And finally, lastly, I
just wanna acknowledge,

1316
01:26:37,806 --> 01:26:39,942
I know we expected Sonia
Sanchez to be here, Mama Sonia,

1317
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:43,366
but due to complications,
she can't be here,

1318
01:26:43,526 --> 01:26:45,453
but she sends us
a wonderful gift.

1319
01:26:45,489 --> 01:26:47,792
And so we are excited and
thrilled about this gift.

1320
01:26:48,244 --> 01:26:50,213
We have a poet who
is world renowned,

1321
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:52,467
who Philly, Philly,
Philly loves.

1322
01:26:52,753 --> 01:26:54,638
And we're so grateful
to have the wise,

1323
01:26:55,842 --> 01:26:58,019
the beautiful, the talented,
just awesome Ursula Rucker.

1324
01:27:02,229 --> 01:27:03,207
Let's welcome her.

1325
01:27:03,231 --> 01:27:04,461
(audience cheering)

1326
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,412
Thank you. Thank you.
(audience cheering)

1327
01:27:11,247 --> 01:27:12,143
- Thank you so much.

1328
01:27:12,167 --> 01:27:14,051
It is such a pleasure
and honor to be here

1329
01:27:15,173 --> 01:27:16,808
in the beautiful
House of Ubuntu.

1330
01:27:17,385 --> 01:27:19,313
And I know you were
expecting Mama Sonia.

1331
01:27:20,224 --> 01:27:22,067
So I hope that
you will allow me,

1332
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:25,073
to share a poem with
you in her stead.
