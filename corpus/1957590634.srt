1
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:30,367
I don't know how to love, but
learned how to hate.

2
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:35,532
If I can start all over, would
I do the same thing?

3
00:00:38,666 --> 00:02:28,000
(music playing)

4
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:47,766
(street ambience)

5
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:55,699
All I need from you is $500
dollars, $500 dollars that you
spend on your fucking shoes!

6
00:02:56,166 --> 00:03:10,799
(street ambience)

7
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:28,799
(music playing)

8
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,433
(music fades)

9
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:44,200
(street ambience)

10
00:03:44,200 --> 00:04:04,566
(music playing)

11
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,632
You want to sit here and talk
about a relationship but you
can't help me!

12
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:18,733
So how am I suppose to trust you
in a relationship If I can't
trust you outside a
relationship?

13
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,300
You're a hustler?

14
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,632
in my old school...

15
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:33,433
Oh really? So go to the corner
store, get us a sandwich
something to drink and a dutch
master

16
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,866
and tell him you'll pay him
back tomorrow.

17
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,666
Go! You're a hustler right?

18
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,933
That'll never work.

19
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,666
It will work, just do it!

20
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:55,699
So this is the I.D. that you're
going to use to get into the
club.

21
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,133
This barely looks like me
So what?

22
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:07,766
It's not a crime. What is he
going to do? "Mr. Officer, I
just got robbed by 16 yr old I
tried having sex with"

23
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:12,699
There's so many nasty perverted
old men out there The way you
explained it you made it seem
easy but it's so complicated!

24
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:16,999
No. It's really easy.
It's just that you're so ditzy
that you make it complicated.

25
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:23,367
This is how it's going to go
down. Take him to the bathroom,
start feeling him up, right?
Make him think he is about to

26
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:45,866
(indoor bar ambience)

27
00:05:45,866 --> 00:06:02,632
(music playing)

28
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:04,833
(music fades)

29
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:11,966
For real man, I saw you at that
bar, I knew you'd come up here
with me. What's good? Take that
jacket off, come here.

30
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:16,666
Take that off. Come here. What's
good? Take that off. Come on
man.

31
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,566
No. Where's the money?

32
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:24,133
What you nervous? I got the
money here. I’m not going to
bring you here with no money.

33
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,433
I got your money right here.
What's good? Relax. Relax,
relax.

34
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:30,400
Here's your money. Take your
money. You not going now where.

35
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,666
Alright? That's what's up. Come
here.

36
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,766
Yo! What the fuck is up with
you faggot!

37
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:39,666
What's wrong with you?

38
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:45,733
What's up? Chill.
What's wrong with you! Come
here...

39
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,899
(slips while running away)

40
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,200
(water running)

41
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,699
Smells clean.

42
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,799
(water running)

43
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,599
You're confused.

44
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,100
(water running)

45
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,966
You want to smell like a boy
but you wan't to look like a
girl.

46
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:22,233
(shower running)

47
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,999

48
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:28,100
Uh... Chinese food is fine!
(shouts from bathroom)

49
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,266
Alright. I'm going to step out
and get some food. (shower
running in background)

50
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:34,200
(shower running in background)

51
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:44,833
(television playing)

52
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:05,632
(music playing)

53
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:06,866
(doors shuts)
(music playing)

54
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:09,500
(music playing)

55
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,266
Hey, sugar plum.

56
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:18,033
(music playing)

57
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,400
(music fades)

58
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,532
Listen, I'm sorry I couldn't
call you I don't know the number
for the hotel room.

59
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:28,766

60
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:33,532

number.

61
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:35,666
I thought this was your friend?
It is my friend.

62
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:43,266
On top of that, you stole $100
of mine

63
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:45,000
(sound on bottle opening)

64
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,400
I have $100 of yours?

65
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,733
You're lucky I didn't take the
full $200 and disappear on your
ass and never come back.

66
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,367
Cause I could've easily done
that!

67
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:09,500
(street ambience)

68
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,599

Pick up the phone!

70
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:18,933
Yo, you think you're a hustler,
you’re not a hustler.

71
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,500
NYC will eat you * up!

72
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:25,632
You know where to find me.

73
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:30,566
(street ambience)

74
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:40,400

75
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,133

76
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:49,966
(park ambience)

77
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:51,966
(park ambience fades)

78
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:56,933
Look at me... Look at me in my
face and tell me that your gay.

79
00:09:56,933 --> 00:10:03,500
I said look at me! You're in the
streets acting all gay? (slaps
face)

80
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,200
I can't even look at you.

81
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:23,899
(park ambience)

82
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,433
(park ambience fades)

83
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:33,500
You think I'm going to let my
son. My son! Walk around the
streets in our neighborhood

84
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:40,433
Where everybody can see you
looking like a fag with tight
clothes on, your eyes painted
like a little bitch?

85
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:41,866
You think I'm?... I would kill
you first!

86
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:48,300
(park ambience)

87
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,799

88
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,699
Yo pa, you not a hustler, you
think you a hustler but you're
not a hustler.

89
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,632
Let me tell you something.
Everybody in NYC is a hustler.

90
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:03,866
Even the Grandma's in the
street make more money than you.

91
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:25,766
(street ambience)

92
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:30,133
You dropped your cigarette.
Thank you. You got an extra one
on you?

93
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:33,532
I only have the one that I have.
That's cool. Can I share it with
you?

94
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:34,833
Yeah. That's what's up man.

95
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,300

What you doing out here?

101
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,300
I'm waiting for a friend.
A friend? We all got friends

102
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:01,333
Friends are good. I'll be
your friend. Thank you.

103
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,833
You're pretty. Thank you.

So I've been told. Yeah?

105
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:12,433
Don't believe anything anybody
tells you. They're all full of
shit.

106
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,666
Hey look, it's a tiger. It's
good luck.

107
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,467
It's a gift.

108
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,467
Thank you.
Yeah. You're welcome.

109
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:27,467
You hungry?

110
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,532

111
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:34,400

00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:41,899
(nods head saying no)

115
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,400

00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:06,799
Yo,he's not answering the door.
He usually answers. I don't know
what's going on.

120
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,733
Give me your phone. I'm going
to call him.

121
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:17,200

122
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,433
Are you cold?

00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,666
I'm outside. you're supposed to
be home. Do me a favor give me a

124
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,333

125
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:37,400
(street ambience)

126
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,599

(street ambience)

128
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:48,233

129
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,999

130
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:54,200

00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,500
And I smile and I got no teeth.
No teeth. How fab are drugs

132
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,599

133
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:10,100
(music playing)

134
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,666

138
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,100
(music fades)

139
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,933
Yo!

140
00:14:51,933 --> 00:15:05,899
(street ambience)

141
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:09,100
Yo, I'm trying to get rid of
this bike. Oh word, where did
you get it from?

142
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,266
I stole it.
Word? So what you trying to get
out of it?

143
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:18,999
Whatever yo. What you got?
Uh... I don't know. Let's
see... $50?

144
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:22,467
You're bullshitting. Come on,
look at this. It weighs nothing!

145
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:26,467
Let me see that, hold on.
You're going to steal it from
me too son?

146
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,200
This weighs nothing. It's white
people's bike. Come on! Ok. $75?

147
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,333
Come on. It's worth $100 come
on.

148
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,666
$100?
Man $85 the most doggy!

149
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,866
It's a recession. It's not easy
to eat. I know, what you think
I'm trying to do man!

150
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:41,100
Whatever, give me whatever you
got then.

151
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,467
It's all good.
Forget it, whatever. I'll take
whatever you got!

152
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:50,166
I just need to eat man.
Whatever. Psss  Damn.

153
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,333
Give me that shit yo, come on.
Be safe.

154
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:58,433
I left that room with... $300
and above and left the room.
That's it?

155
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:04,033
That's it. I wasn't doing much.
And I left the room so grossed
out with myself

156
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:08,733
I'm not even joking but my pants
cost $80 and my underwear cost
$200 are you serious?

157
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:13,500
You hear Trannies sucking for
$60 or $20 and that's gross.

158
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,999
For crack! $5 even.
Yeah but that's the thing.

159
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:21,133
I see it now and It's so gross
I almost did it once and got
$300

160
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:25,833
If I'm going to sell myself, I
have to have a sexual
connection.

161
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:30,799
Not a sexual connection, a
sexual, mental connection If
you're mentally right in your
head

162
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,933
Bro, I will get the hardest
erection ever.

163
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:37,632
And I'm not big, I'm probably
below 5 inches but...

164
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:43,066
Most men are 6 inches actually
I'm below 5 inches

165
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:47,233
Have you seen 9 inches? Yes.
Do you have a ruler because I
have one in my book bag

166
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:50,400
I've seen 9 inches. Have you
ever seen 9 inches? No, it's
about this big.

167
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,833
No. 9 inches is actually
this big. This big,this big.

168
00:16:54,833 --> 00:17:02,400
Most guys have a 6 inch *,
and most guys will tell you that
they're * is 9 inches

169
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,266
Everyone wants to have a 9 inch
* because it looks like a
good number to say for a *

170
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:13,233
* the weed right. I was like,
I'm not trying to smoke a blunt
I'm trying to snort something.

171
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:18,200
When I was doing coke, ecstasy,
"K", I was smoking meth. I was
doing a lot of that

172
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,400
But what was your use for doing
it, for killing yourself? Mine
was to overdose.

173
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,433
There's no use for doing drugs
ever! There's no use. But my use
for drugs was for killing
myself.

174
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:34,933
I would overdose every day.
Then you need therapy. If need
therapy you can talk to me or a
doctor.

175
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:41,532
It's not therapy. Im so glad I'm
done with this But triple C's is
a drug that's Coricidin

176
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:50,599
Coricidin on the purple box. If
you take 8 or 16 pills you'd be
like... It's like "K",ecstasy
and acid all at once.

177
00:17:50,599 --> 00:18:02,133
It was so hard core...
You see that? That's a reminder
of how stupid I really am.

178
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:07,033
I got a track mark, I never
wanted to have one of these
things.

179
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:11,033
It's my laugh button and every
time my Father would get pissed
off or mad at me, I would go
Brrrp  and push it.

180
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:14,866
(street ambience)

181
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:19,467
You're telling me that you
don't have a place to stay?

182
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:25,367
You know what? We could be like
vampires and we'll just keep our
asses up all night and sleep all
day at my cousin's house

183
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:28,833
There's no parties that go
after 4am. There's after hours

184
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,999
After hours. We'll be fine.
It's not that long. It'll be
fun.

185
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:41,233
I'm nothing without you,
nothing with you

186
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:48,066
(street ambience)

187
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:49,566
This is uh...

188
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:59,733
I'm so high. He's my favorite
artist and I can't remember his
name right now. Egon Scheile.

189
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:07,500
He's my favorite. He would paint
heroine addicts, male
prostitutes in the 1910's And If
you look...

190
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,400
I'll show you.

191
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:15,400
Oh wow. You have balls.

192
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,500
He would paint heroine addict
prostitutes...Here's another
Egon Scheile. That's my *.

193
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:25,300
Oh wow. That's cool.

194
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,999
(street ambience)

195
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:30,500
(whistles)

196
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,632
Sexy, sexy!

197
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:40,433
I can't even see your face cause
my sunglasses are on but I see
your furry white man legs.

198
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,866
Looks like you crawled down
from the caucasus mountains, you
little devil.

199
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:50,899
Are you coming from the gym?
I know what you do in the gym!

200
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:58,300
So what,Let's go to the after
hours. Where they're sleeping in
the corner, you go in their
pockets and take their shit.

201
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:06,899
Take their virginity, pop their
cherry? No, take their money.
Forget their virginity, it’s not
going to buy you a cheeseburger.

202
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,300
I have to go to work.

203
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,566
Where is work?

204
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:15,666
Hell. You want to work?
I like hell.

205
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:42,000

(un-zippers jacket)

208
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:49,966
Not only did I get money but I
got this bag of shit.

209
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:58,500
So we could do like, this much
and sell the rest of it.

210
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,066
(opens bag)

211
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:06,666
(sniffs)

212
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:16,699
(room ambience)

213
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:19,500

(quiet outdoor ambience)

217
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:36,799
You want to jerk off?
(nods head no)

218
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,566
I do. I want to jerk off like
this.

219
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:39,799
(blows smoke)

220
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,766
Ekaj, wake up. Wake up
What the heck!

221
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:47,899
Wake up. My cousin's coming back
in an hour. I'm dressed Why
didn't you wake me up earlier?

222
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:51,632
Cause I wanted you to sleep.
I'll take you somewhere else.
Come on.

223
00:21:51,632 --> 00:21:54,166
I'll make you coffee. You
wan't coffee? (nods head)

224
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,166

229
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,866
(music fades)

230
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,833
Narration:
I just want to punch him in the
face and have sex with him.

231
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:52,566
Instead. I want the man to feel
like he's in charge. But what i
want to do, is let him think
he's in charge.

232
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:54,699
Let him think he has the power,
and the just take it from him.
So like after having sex, just
be like...

233
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:06,100
So after having sex, just be
like...This was probably a
really good day for you but
thanks for messing up mine. And

234
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,799
And just walk away.

235

Yeah, everything is going good.

239
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,033
Ah, just been really busy.

240
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:40,833
Narration:
I think I would give up my
career for him, and I don't
even have one.

241
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:44,100
(guy talking on phone)

242
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:50,599
Forget that whole ceremony.
We'll give each other rings I'll
change my last name, he'll
change his to something we make

243
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:54,766
Yeah.
No, we had a good time.

Ok.
Yeah, I can see you tonight.
Let's hang out.

245
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:07,500
You should leave them here.
That way you have something
nice to wear when we go out
next time.

(quiet room)

247
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:16,999

weekend. Ok?

248
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:22,333
(quiet room)

me to meet his friend?

(music playing low)

252
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:53,733
Is this another game?

(music playing low)

254
00:24:58,433 --> 00:25:05,733
Men are very insecure. I'll
always hate men. I even hate
myself because I have that man
mentality.

255
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:08,699

(person says no)

259
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,300
Screw you.

269
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:45,266
I just got out the hospital. I
got your messages. I don't know
why you're bugging out.

270
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:50,033
I'm headed home now. I don't

ok. Just give me a call back.

(slight outdoor ambience)

278
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:29,500
I was under the impression that
if your boyfriend acted psycho
It meant that he loved you so
much, that he loses his sanity.

279
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,233
(music playing)

280
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:35,666
I guess it's that crazy Puerto
Rican love.

281
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:38,666
Where the heck did you get this?
Where did you get this?

That's what I saw when I was
growing up.

287
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:55,400
When I told you he was on the
phone...

288
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,100
He kept listening and I kept
trying to run away. (puts bottle
on counter)

289
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,766
Bro, every time I'm in his house
I don't like talking on the
phone for a reason.

290
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:11,200
Yeah! What do you think I was
telling you? He tried to trap me
in his house and couldn't leave.

291
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,766
And every time I’d leave, he'd
play some sick game with me. I'm
not done with this, I know what
he's doing.

292
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:24,899

Oh, look. It's a hooker.

298
00:29:09,699 --> 00:29:11,566
Come the heck inside.

(street sound in back round)

320
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,999
You know what?

321
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:59,666
You should put make up on the
other eye, cause it matches.

322

00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:49,433
(grabs paint tube)

329
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:55,799
(room is quiet)

330
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,367
(grabs paint tube)

331
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,400
I need these two tubes of paint.

332
00:32:03,766 --> 00:32:08,866

333
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:12,233
(takes money)

334
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:15,467
I think it's going to close
soon.

335
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:19,833
(gets up from chair)

336
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:24,100
(street ambience)

337
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:59,699
(music playing)

338
00:32:59,699 --> 00:33:02,666
(music fades)

339
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,666
(making noises with his mouth)

340
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:10,133
Stop. Stop... Stop!

341
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:12,367
How do you like that bitch?
I don't stupid.

(makes sounds with his mouth)

343
00:33:15,266 --> 00:33:16,533
Your feet stinks.

344
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:21,400
Get down from there please,
you're going to fall. I wouldn't
fall.

345
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,367
You're going to fall over.
That's good.

346
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:26,666
You're sad!... Sad.

347
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,933
Cause your boyfriend is tired.
What does he look like?

348
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:35,266
How big is his *?
Does he have a big *?

349
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:37,632
That's the only excuse for
putting up with that shit is if
he has a big *!

350
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:49,300
(outdoor ambience)

351
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,333
(street ambience)

352
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,500
(walking up steps)

353
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,133
Hey.

354
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:57,766
(runs up steps)

355
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:59,400
How are you?

356
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,666
I'm good and you?
I'm great.

357
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:06,632
Come in.

358
00:34:06,632 --> 00:34:07,899
Check out my new piece.

359
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:16,200
This shit is heavy.

360
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,899
I can barely lift it.

361
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,533
Thanks for letting me stay
here by the way. No problem.

362
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:24,266
Oh, can I have one of your
bracelets?

363
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:25,433
It's just one.

364
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,367
Can I have it?

365
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:28,833
If you stay another day.

366
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:31,999
Nah...

367
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:33,533
(clicks lighter)

368
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:34,733
I'll burn it.

369
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:36,599
(blows out the flame)

370
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:38,933
What size are they?

371
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:41,632
These are cool.

372
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:45,133
Yeah. They're G-star
Whatever the * that is.

373
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:46,666
I can wear them high waisted.

374
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:52,033
So what else are you adding on
to these?

375
00:34:52,033 --> 00:34:54,632
Everything. And I think I'm
going to paint them white.

376
00:34:54,632 --> 00:34:57,200
They already are white.
Well, whiter.

377
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,533
I want them to be really white.

378
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:03,467
So you can never wash them then?
No, you can wash them.

379
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,866
And none of it will come off?
No.

380
00:35:05,866 --> 00:35:06,333
(street ambience)

381
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,566
So, who gave you your hair cut?

382
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:08,599
I did.

383
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,467
You did it yourself?

384
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:11,300
I love it.

385
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:15,100
It looks amazing.
need to get it fixed.

386
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,666
Thank you, everybody tells me
that but I think it looks like
shit.

387
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:19,233
It's a little too long though.
No it's not.

388
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:20,833
Yeah, from behind you look like
a girl.

389
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:28,866
I don't want them to think you
know...If we were going downtown
together... You don't want me
looking like a hipster?

390
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:34,333
No, I don't want a hipster
thinking you know... What, that
I'm a girl?

391
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,966
Yeah.
It always happens.

392
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:37,500
Really?
(nods head)

393
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,733
Like everyday for you?
Yeah.

394
00:35:39,733 --> 00:35:42,966
Must be really hard on you?
No. I'm used to it.

395
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:45,699
Such a pretty face, how do
you... Hehe. Thank you.

396
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:49,666
Do you smoke tea leaves?
I smoke the devil's lettuce.

397
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,599
Did you ever smoke a tea leaf?

398
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:57,666
If I'm getting your gist, I
think I have. I'm not sure.

399
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:58,866
PCP.

400
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,899
Angel dust.
No thank you. I'll pass.

401
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:05,500
Yeah?
(nods head)

402
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,966
Want to get some powders?

403
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,367
Um...Ok.
We can have a powder party?

404
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:13,699
A powder party?
I got $20

405
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,799
I have a couple dollars, so I
think we're good.

406
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:19,899
We can make some more
though, real quick. How?

407
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:20,766
Right over here.

408
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:44,467
(music playing)

409
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:46,066
(music lowers as back round)

410
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:48,899
Why would you do stupid shit
like that? Girls do stupid shit
like that.

411
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:54,999
You want to get smacked up like
a girl? That's how you do.

412
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:56,666
(Lighter light up)

413
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:57,899
You almost burned my freaking
eye out!

414
00:36:57,899 --> 00:37:00,233
Give me one.
No.

415
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:04,133
Why?
Cause when I want to give you
one.

416
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:08,033
Not when you tell me to give you
one. I don't work like that. And
I don't play like that.

417
00:37:08,033 --> 00:37:11,033
(music playing then cuts off)

418
00:37:11,033 --> 00:37:19,133
Wow. You got two painter
boyfriends. Not just one, two.
So if one doesn't work out, the
other will pay for all your

419
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:22,467
You should ask them both to
teach you how to paint so you
can make a career out of it.

420
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:24,333
It'll be funny.
You can paint pictures of me.

421
00:37:25,166 --> 00:38:13,666
(music playing)

422
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:19,799
So I was going to chill out with
you until like 2 or 3AM then go
up the block to my friends house
but...

423
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:21,866
I'm living outside right now
smoking a cigarette.

424
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:33,799
(music playing)

425
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:38,899
I just seen you walking, I
didn't see your mannerism. I
didn't see that All I saw was
your face and I did like this...

426
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:43,467
I wasn't even listening and I
was like... What, what  Oh!

427
00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:49,833
And then I heard the man voice.
Only one time I heard it. One
time. The man voice, and I
already knew.

428
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:54,066
You know what I mean? You know
it too come on man... I have a
girls body so I don't know.

429
00:38:54,066 --> 00:39:46,133
(music playing)

430
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,300

432
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:57,632
(walks up stairs)

433
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:03,566
(knocks on door)

434
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,632
Who is it?
(opens the door)

435
00:40:07,632 --> 00:40:10,066
You were supposed to be here
two hours ago. I'm real tired.

436
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:11,699
Who's that?

437
00:40:13,066 --> 00:40:16,599
His name is Ekaj.
Ask your boy Akiji if he's
hungry.

438
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,966
I'll cook something up if you
want something? Ya'll hungry?

439
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:21,233
I'm not hungry. You hungry?

440
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:24,033
Akiji, you hungry?
No, that's fine!

441
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:26,566
You look a little tired but
yeah...

442
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:27,733
Well, I guess no food then.
(throws spoon in sink)

443
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:28,833
Huh Akiji?

444
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,833
What, you’re going to tell me my
fortune?

445
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,933
You're tired and you're late.
That's you're fortune. (the guy
laughs)

446
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:38,566
My little kiki.

447
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:43,799
Leave him alone. No, that's
okay. If you're going to touch
somebody touch me!

448
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:46,833
Nah, that's okay. He's mine.
Do me a favor, chill the heck
out!

449
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:50,233
This little kiki is mine.
How much for him?

450
00:40:50,233 --> 00:40:53,033
$200?
You couldn't afford him.

451
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,467
What you doing over there my
little kiki? Why don't you come
close to me my little kuka?

452
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:59,699
Just what the doctor ordered.
Huh?

453
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:03,467
Go ahead, do a bump.
The doctor needs to give you
some Ambien and put your ass to
sleep!

454
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:07,599
Nah, he's just my type. This is
my type!

455
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,233

The shit is wack yo. It happens.
I can't console you if you're

00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:37,599
Look, everybody gets raped. I
got raped. My Mother probably
got raped by my Father and
that's why I'm sitting here.

498
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,266
I got raped twice, like an
idiot. My boyfriend got raped,
all my friends got raped, my
Trannie friends raped and

499
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:46,433
They got raped. It happens.
You know what? Only ugly people
don't get raped.

500
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:49,666
You're not ugly. Come on,
you're pretty.

501
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:52,333
Then why didn't I fight?

502
00:43:54,899 --> 00:44:02,799
I don't know why I didn't fight.
I just wanted it to be over when
it happened. Maybe it's the
same, you wanted to get it done

503
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:05,367
It happens, it's part of your
past. You want me to go and kill
him for you?

504
00:44:07,733 --> 00:44:14,033
You're to young to know what
lose is. It comes back. But
still, this isn't me or who I
was.

505
00:44:14,033 --> 00:44:18,533
If I was to show you my artwork,
you'd be like damn bitch If I
was to show you now, you'd say,
what are you doing?

506
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:23,899
What are you doing, what the
heck is this? I hear it, you
don't have to tell me about it.

507
00:44:23,899 --> 00:44:28,333
You need inspiration. You as an
artist, tattoos on your face.
That's inspiration.

508
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:32,333
Well then, it should inspire you
to finally do something with it
then. Exactly.

509
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:38,766
You don't like like someone who
is disenchanted, or somebody
who's lost.

510
00:44:38,766 --> 00:44:41,567
Because there's hope.
Then as long as you have hope
then it's all fine.

511
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:52,733
When you have no hope you become
a whore, then you're depressed.
But if you're crying, you're
upset and it means you're fine

512
00:44:56,033 --> 00:45:01,899
But if you keep hanging with
this one, and that one, getting
high He's going to kill all
emotion you have left in in you.

513
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:08,166
And you're not going to want to
do nothing, and one day you'll
say I used to draw and when I
ask you, you'll be like ugh.

514
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:16,533
And you're not going to care. if
you're crying about it, keep
crying. And you should be upset
and light a fire under your feet

515
00:45:16,533 --> 00:45:20,632
And if you're bored about it and
not moving forward, then stop!
And be a freaking whore.

516
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,899
My friend about 6 years ago...

517
00:45:26,799 --> 00:45:30,266
Told me to tattoo my face and I
said, Why?

518
00:45:32,866 --> 00:45:37,799
And he said... put yourself on
the corner where you can get a
job doing anything. I can't even
get a job flipping burgers!

519
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:39,500
But if you do that to yourself,
you didn't take what you wan't
to do seriously.

520
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:43,166
So I did it.
And it's the best thing I ever
did in my life.

521
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:54,000
(street ambience)

522
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,500
Pick up the next time I call
you! I got my check in the mail
I was going to get some puerto
rican food and wanted you to

523
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,632
I haven't seen you in a minute
yo. Peace.

524
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:05,799
(quiet room sound)

525
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:14,266
(street ambience)
(clicking lighter)

526
00:46:14,266 --> 00:46:16,400
Can I come over tonight?

527
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:20,400
Did you get my paint?

528
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:24,599
Is that all that you're worried
about, is freaking paint?

529
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:28,433
I asked you to do one simple
thing for me and get those
paints

530
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:35,266
He was playing games with me...
I was like, shut the * up!
But you didn't have to smack his
glasses off, that was crazy.

531
00:46:35,266 --> 00:46:36,599
You smacked his glasses off like
he was a nerd in high school!
Like shut the * up!

532
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:39,533
(street ambience)

533
00:46:39,533 --> 00:46:44,033
That was some high school shit.
You rocked his shit. He got so
mad that I was crying.

534
00:46:44,033 --> 00:46:47,533
He was like... I can't see!
Shut up. Bam (they all laugh)

535
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:49,999
He tried to slap box with you.

536
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:53,966
Whatever man, that's your boy.
That's your man. No,That's your
man dog!

537
00:46:53,966 --> 00:46:57,200
Man, I'm negative in my account
dogs. You have the over draft
fee!

538
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,433
It's not even an overdraft...
You're over *ed.

539
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,467
Yo, what's that right there?

540
00:47:04,899 --> 00:47:06,799

Yo, get the bag and the hoody
dogs.

542
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:18,733
Oh shit. That's not even a girl.
What's good, what's up?

543
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:21,133
Get out of here. What's up then
dog? We're robbing you right

544
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:22,367
Hold him!
(guy punches him in face)

545
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,066
(something falls on ground)

546
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,000
Grab him, grab him!

547
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,133

How about light tan... or a
champagne color and black

637
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:01,100
What are you going to do to your
apartment? What I'm going to do
to my apartment, is not have you
in it if you keep asking.

638
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:05,866
Be happy. Look you could be

639
00:54:05,866 --> 00:54:10,266

And How is stealing better than
escorting?
