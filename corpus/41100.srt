1
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:37,062
You're going to love this one.
Listen up, here we go.

2
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:30,621
Here you go, Pluto. What did you think?

3
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:33,314
l don't know what to think, Tony.
l mean....

4
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:35,154
You got a dress on....

5
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,122
This is not a dress, it's a kilt.
Scottish tradition. Very manly, a kilt.

6
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:41,358
lt's a manly dress.

7
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:43,697
No, a kilt.
That's how people know who l am.

8
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,206
People think of Anthony Frankowski,
they immediately think ''Scottish crooning.''

9
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:52,607
There lies your problem. That's not even
a thing. Did you make that up?

10
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:55,737
Yes, l made that up.
lt's a thing if l made it up.

11
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:57,849
-lt's horrible.
-lt's my hook!

12
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,507
You know what you need to do
if you're going to croon? Be ltalian.

13
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:03,881
Be Anthony Frantucci.

14
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:07,118
-You want me to change my name?
-Yeah, to something that swings.

15
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:09,990
-Anthony Frandicci.
-That doesn't swing.

16
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:11,153
Anthony...

17
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,153
...Francis.

18
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:14,992
-Tony Francis.
-You like that?

19
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,124
l'm Tony Francis.

20
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,692
That's a good name.
You're Tony Francis now.

21
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,704
Ladies and gentlemen, Tony Francis.

22
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:24,003
Absolutely. l like it.
Lose the dress, change the name.

23
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,701
-ls your bathroom back there?
-Through the doors.

24
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:30,009
Tony Francis.

25
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:37,888
Am l supposed to piss in the kitchen?

26
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:39,546
No, it's off to the right.

27
00:04:57,242 --> 00:05:02,202
Ladies and gentlemen, would you
please welcome Mr. Tony Francis!

28
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:07,050
''Oh, my God! lt's Tony Francis! ''

29
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:10,978
How is showbiz?

30
00:05:19,197 --> 00:05:20,095
Disgusting.

31
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:48,254
Take a walk, hotshot.

32
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:49,793
Pluto, help me!

33
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:51,918
Pluto?

34
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:54,858
-Pluto Nash?
-That's right!

35
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:57,593
-When did you get out of the joint?
-A week ago.

36
00:06:01,172 --> 00:06:02,639
Congratulations.

37
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:03,897
Thanks a lot.

38
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,442
l'm Gino.

39
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,341
This is my nephew, Larry.
Larry, say hello to Pluto Nash.

40
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:10,845
What's going on?

41
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:15,012
My brother was inside with you.
Angelo Sotobolo.

42
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:17,187
Angelo Cheesecake is your brother?

43
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:21,655
We used to play cards in his cell every
weekend. He'd have the shit catered.

44
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:25,286
-He thinks the world of you.
-lt's mutual.

45
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:27,297
Pluto is my best friend.

46
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,702
What are you guys doing?
What's going on, Gino?

47
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,031
We're cleaning out his digestive system.

48
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,102
Gino, l can't let you do that, man.

49
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:43,503
Pluto.

50
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:48,585
Your pal borrowed $2.5 million
from me four years ago...

51
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:51,645
-...to buy this joint.
-On an easy payment plan.

52
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,694
Here. l think that will get it off.

53
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:01,493
-How much does he owe you now?
-$2.5 million.

54
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,725
-He didn't pay anything back?
-No.

55
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:05,733
Any idiot can make money here.

56
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,796
This guy has to do
his cockamamie act each night.

57
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:10,799
lt's like a damn freak show.

58
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,537
l seen it. You see where this shit got you?

59
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:14,942
Gino, listen.

60
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:18,849
l'm not in the smuggling business anymore.
l'm opening my own club.

61
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:19,849
No kidding.

62
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,820
lt's always been a lifelong dream of mine
to have my own club.

63
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:24,911
Life--

64
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:28,958
Dinner and dancing and nice atmosphere.

65
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,625
Good place, hot music.

66
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:35,255
Once l get it going, l'll sit back,
light up a cigar and enjoy the party.

67
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:36,661
What could be better?

68
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:39,562
Nothing could be better.
We could be partners.

69
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:41,762
You know what?

70
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:47,076
What if l pay off his debt,
take over this place, and we call it square?

71
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:59,156
Let's have a drink and talk about it.

72
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:00,452
Out of these glasses?

73
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:04,289
-Are you crazy? Across the street.
-All right.

74
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:08,625
What will you do about my friend?

75
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,259
Anthony?

76
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:13,165
My gift to you.

77
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:15,098
You're a prince.

78
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:18,973
l'll go across the street and have
some beers and work out the logistics.

79
00:08:19,144 --> 00:08:22,636
Just sit here in your skirt
and l'll see you in a minute.

80
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,247
9:18 Lunar Grand Express...

81
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:34,620
...now ready for general boarding
on platform 22.

82
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:55,778
Welcome to the Moon.

83
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:59,815
While you're here, be sure and visit
the Lunar Grand Resort and Casino...

84
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:02,509
...only two hours away by hover shuttle.

85
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:07,748
Remember, Moon Beach is the only place
in the universe where gambling is legal.

86
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,828
The Lunar Grand.
The perfect family vacation.

87
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:43,087
lncoming!

88
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:44,517
Thanks, Pluto!

89
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:50,765
Pace yourselves. lt's only 10:00.
This ain't a bachelor party.

90
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:54,669
Yeah, it is.
Tommy here is getting divorced tomorrow.

91
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:57,037
-Really? Congratulations.
-Thank you.

92
00:09:57,108 --> 00:10:00,737
l tell you what. Drinks are on the house
for the rest of the night.

93
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:02,669
You're the best, Pluto!

94
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:05,610
Excuse me a second.

95
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:06,911
Thanks a lot, Pluto.

96
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:09,451
He's the best!

97
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:13,386
Crank it up. l'm not running a library
in here! Crank it up!

98
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:25,091
All right!

99
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:29,906
Keep it like that! Keep it pumping!

100
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,541
Hey, Miguel!

101
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:43,779
-Not bad for a Tuesday night.
-Not bad at all.

102
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:45,846
lt's like the whole city turned out.

103
00:10:47,592 --> 00:10:49,321
We've come a long way, baby.

104
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:51,257
Long way. All right, partner.

105
00:10:51,362 --> 00:10:54,229
-Look at that ass. l'll be right back.
-Oh, my goodness.

106
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,068
Sorry, l'll get that.

107
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,332
Sorry.

108
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:05,632
lt's all right, it's okay.

109
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:12,310
Could you help me?
l'm looking for the owner, Pluto Nash.

110
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:14,351
Why are you looking for that lowlife?

111
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:15,511
lt's personal.

112
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,615
He doesn't even know you.

113
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:19,486
-Yes, he does.
-No, l don't.

114
00:11:20,124 --> 00:11:21,284
You're him?

115
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:24,260
Last time l checked. How can l help you?

116
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:27,061
l just came all the way from Salt Lake City.

117
00:11:27,131 --> 00:11:28,120
Rough town.

118
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:32,494
l'm a good singer. l got this gig,
they gave me a one-way ticket up here.

119
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,902
But the guys who own the nightclub sold it.

120
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:39,966
l'm dead broke. l need a job.
l want to go home. Can you help me out?

121
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:41,477
Sorry, l can't help you.

122
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:45,346
l'm sure there's a bunch of clubs
that can use a good singer, but we got a DJ.

123
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,508
Take it easy.

124
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:50,914
l'm sure they could,
but my Moon card expired...

125
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:54,720
...and l was told you were the one person
in town who might overlook that.

126
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,987
Who told you something foolish like that?

127
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:59,425
You know my father, Nicholas Lake?

128
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:01,855
Never heard of him.

129
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:03,695
Nicky Sticks?

130
00:12:03,868 --> 00:12:05,495
That's your father?

131
00:12:06,204 --> 00:12:07,967
Unbelievable. That's something.

132
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:14,110
Normally l don't call in favors,
but my dad did save your life back in '76.

133
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:17,245
He didn't save my life, l saved his life.

134
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:19,576
And l lost a fine automobile in the process.

135
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:23,519
Unless you got a new Plymouth
with my name on it, l got nothing to say.

136
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:25,115
So, good night.

137
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:26,885
Thanks, Dad.

138
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:29,356
l should have known. l'm sorry.

139
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:39,267
Maybe l got something.

140
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,067
Really? Great! Shall we say
two shows a night, five nights a week?

141
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:45,632
Shall we say six nights a week
waiting tables?

142
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:49,076
You can save up your tips, make
enough money to get back home. Deal?

143
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:51,978
Deal.

144
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:17,400
-ls it like this every night?
-Only the slow ones.

145
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,375
Somebody is coming in.

146
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:21,876
Sorry, fellows, we're closed.

147
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:24,037
We're here to see Mr. Nash.

148
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:25,647
ls he expecting you?

149
00:13:31,222 --> 00:13:34,157
$10 million is more than a fair offer,
Mr. Nash.

150
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:37,792
l don't know. l own
the most successful club in Little America.

151
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:42,296
l own it outright.
l'm my own boss, and l have the hottest--

152
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:49,164
l got the best party in town.
Why would l want to sell this place?

153
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:51,134
$10 million?

154
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:54,172
Get your shit off my desk!

155
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:57,740
No, boys.

156
00:13:57,915 --> 00:14:01,578
Please meet my friend
and bodyguard, Bruno.

157
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:06,689
Gentlemen.

158
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:08,191
Bruno, the boys.

159
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:11,823
Looks like you're about due for a trade-in.

160
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,627
Hey, Bruno.

161
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:16,422
What are you, a '65?

162
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:19,501
Model '63 Deluxe.

163
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,595
'63? Talk about ancient.

164
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,739
Your sister didn't seem to mind.

165
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:25,173
Screw you, robot!

166
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:29,574
He can be fixed, you can't.

167
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:33,340
We don't mean to cause any problems.

168
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:35,213
He's reaching, you know?

169
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:36,853
Okay. No reaching.

170
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:39,516
Mr. Nash...

171
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,350
...this is non-negotiable.

172
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:48,332
Rex Crater is buying your club.

173
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:52,230
l was wondering when you all
was going to get to me.

174
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:54,968
$10 million.

175
00:14:58,142 --> 00:15:02,272
Tell Mr. Crater, thanks, but no, thanks.
l won't sell my club.

176
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:05,782
lf l have my way,
no one here will sell their place...

177
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,684
...because we like this town the way it is.
So, if you'd be so kind, get out.

178
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:19,257
Rex Crater does not like to be disappointed.

179
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:22,627
l'll just have to send Mr. Crater
a case of Scotch!

180
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:29,768
-Great first night, Dina.
-Thanks.

181
00:15:30,074 --> 00:15:34,170
Do me a favor. Run this up to Pluto.
l need to lock up the back.

182
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:37,338
Thank you very much.

183
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:42,445
Miguel?

184
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,854
This isn't some send-up-the-new-girl
kind of a thing, right?

185
00:15:47,024 --> 00:15:50,516
No. Relax. He wouldn't do that.
You're safe, go ahead.

186
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,094
Come on in.

187
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:02,272
Perfect timing.

188
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:06,876
Miguel asked me to bring it up.

189
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:08,542
Perfect.

190
00:16:08,913 --> 00:16:10,471
Should l make it for you?

191
00:16:10,548 --> 00:16:13,847
No, l mix my own martinis.
But thank you, anyway.

192
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:16,250
l got it down to a pretty good science.

193
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,394
Perfect.

194
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:34,096
l wanted to thank you again for the job.

195
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:37,897
-Don't even mention it.
-Well, l am mentioning it. Thank you.

196
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:41,444
You're very welcome.

197
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,237
Let me get this, okay?

198
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:48,179
-Hello?
-Hello, Nash.

199
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:51,517
Don't call me this time of night.
What's wrong with you?

200
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:55,322
You know Tony Francis?

201
00:16:55,493 --> 00:16:59,691
l knew him back when he was Anthony
Frankowski. We were like brothers.

202
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:03,962
We grew up together. Me and Anthony
Frankowski, who would later become--

203
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:07,397
l'll tell you a real funny story in a second.

204
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,203
Hello?

205
00:17:09,273 --> 00:17:12,299
Just wanted to give you one last chance
to change your mind.

206
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:16,278
Look, no now and no tomorrow.
No means no. Leave me alone.

207
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:18,137
Now, you look--

208
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:20,047
Clown.

209
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:22,111
Who was that?

210
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:24,711
One of Rex Crater's boys,
trying to buy me out.

211
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:27,147
Why is he so set on buying your club?

212
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:30,193
Because they're about to approve gambling
in this town.

213
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:33,321
lf Crater gets his way,
they'll turn the Moon into a big casino.

214
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:36,594
You can't sell your club till l make
enough money to get back home.

215
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:40,626
l'll let him know the next time he calls
that you got to get your money first.

216
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,448
-You all right? You okay?
-Yeah.

217
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:57,611
-What happened?
-l don't know!

218
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:01,988
Come on.

219
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:09,162
Bruno!

220
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:12,893
Bomb detonated. Evacuate.

221
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:15,037
Evacuate.

222
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:17,167
Bomb detonated.

223
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:18,430
Evacuate.

224
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:24,704
Bruno, look what they did to my place!

225
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,110
Pluto!

226
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:31,918
Damn!

227
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:35,117
Let's get them.

228
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:36,682
No. Stay here with her!

229
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:45,733
-Bruno, l think that's one of them.
-l'll intercept the call.

230
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,267
''Nash is alive. He took off after Jimmy,
who's headed for the Vac.

231
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:52,003
''Be ready for him.''

232
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:53,333
What's the Vac?

233
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:56,972
The Perfect Vacuum, at the corner
of Glenn Avenue and Fifth. Why?

234
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,811
Didn't you hear the phone call?

235
00:18:58,883 --> 00:19:01,716
l'm sorry, l cannot listen and hear
at the same time.

236
00:19:01,786 --> 00:19:04,346
You see, l'm a '63.
Only later models can do that!

237
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:07,186
-Pluto's in trouble. Come on.
-Trouble?

238
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:12,853
-ls that as fast as you go?
-l'm a '63! l'm at top speed!

239
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:29,944
Get out of the way!

240
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,519
Reset. Reset. Reset.

241
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:14,249
You try to shake me down,
then you blow up my club?

242
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:15,917
You blew up my wood barstools!

243
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:18,359
You know how hard it is
to get wood on the Moon?

244
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:23,260
Shit!

245
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:27,634
You want to play games?
You have to shoot around your boy!

246
00:20:27,705 --> 00:20:29,502
lt's easier to shoot through him.

247
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:31,471
Shit!

248
00:20:50,494 --> 00:20:52,826
-Pluto, it's a trap!
-Yeah, no kidding!

249
00:21:33,737 --> 00:21:35,466
Did you ever shoot a gun before?

250
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:50,414
Time to go, Bruno!

251
00:21:53,824 --> 00:21:55,121
All clear, boss!

252
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,355
Come on!

253
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,091
Bruno, heel!

254
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:08,365
-You are really something, you know that?
-Thank you.

255
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:12,005
You walked right into a trap
any idiot could see from a mile away.

256
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:14,306
l was walking right out
until you came along.

257
00:22:14,378 --> 00:22:15,606
-Really?
-Yes, really.

258
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,170
You put your neck on the line,
l appreciate that.

259
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:22,345
But in the future, not that there'll be
a future, if l need your help, l'll ask.

260
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:24,785
Don't worry about it,
l'm getting out of here.

261
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:29,483
l saved your life twice. Least you can do
is loan me enough money so l can go home.

262
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,562
l would, but they'll be looking for you
at every bus station and shuttle launch.

263
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:35,929
Me? They don't even know
what l look like.

264
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,163
Every club in this city
has a biometric camera system.

265
00:22:39,236 --> 00:22:42,296
They took hundreds of pictures of you.
They know what you look like.

266
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:44,998
Only way you're going home now
is in a box.

267
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,471
That's just great. Now what?

268
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,672
After you.

269
00:22:58,289 --> 00:22:59,278
Hey, Roy.

270
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:01,583
Pluto! What are you doing here?

271
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,196
My place is getting redecorated
and l need a place overnight.

272
00:23:06,363 --> 00:23:10,265
Sure! 3D. The code is 4-5-7.

273
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:11,494
Thanks, Roy.

274
00:23:26,984 --> 00:23:30,886
So, this is the Garden of Paradise.

275
00:23:32,156 --> 00:23:33,088
My, my.

276
00:23:33,157 --> 00:23:35,455
lf this is too glitzy for you...

277
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:38,584
...tomorrow we can get a room
at the Garden of Eden.

278
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:40,755
They got a bathroom on every floor.

279
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:43,460
l hate the Moon.

280
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:45,832
Know why Mooners can't stand Earthlings?

281
00:23:45,903 --> 00:23:49,532
You think everything back Earth is better
and can't stop talking about it.

282
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:52,507
l went back Earth once
and the air smelled funny.

283
00:23:52,776 --> 00:23:56,803
Sneezing all the time, rained every day,
bugs and shit everywhere.

284
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,348
You know the only thing l liked about it?

285
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,646
-You could see the Moon at night?
-Bingo.

286
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:10,817
-ls something wrong with your toaster?
-He's all right. He's just recharging.

287
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:12,923
Can he hear us?

288
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,763
Not while he's charging.

289
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:18,825
Shouldn't your bodyguard be able to keep
up with you on the way to a gunfight?

290
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:21,433
You might want to think
about trading him in.

291
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:24,598
l can't trade in Bruno.
We got a history together.

292
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:27,711
l got 20 years of rill-hopping experience
wired into him.

293
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:29,608
-Rill-hopping?
-Well, that's a....

294
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:34,017
Smuggling. That's what l went to jail for.

295
00:24:34,785 --> 00:24:39,017
He ain't the fastest thing in the world,
but he got me out of lots of tight squeezes.

296
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:40,681
A little smokier than usual.

297
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:42,953
-He's a fire hazard.
-He's all right.

298
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,322
Where are you going?

299
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:47,228
l got to go talk to an old friend,
see what l can find out.

300
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:48,764
What am l supposed to do?

301
00:24:48,832 --> 00:24:51,528
Make sure
Bruno don't burn the place down.

302
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:54,332
-You're leaving me alone with him?
-l left.

303
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:55,394
Pluto!

304
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,218
You're getting kind of old, Rowland.

305
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:16,849
You should be so lucky. Every lowlife
in town is looking to whack you.

306
00:25:16,927 --> 00:25:19,157
l'm a popular guy. What can l say?

307
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:20,853
You want to lose some money?

308
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:24,230
No, but you'll lose money.
We'll play some eight ball, regular stakes.

309
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:27,297
-l will kindly empty your wallet for you.
-You're on.

310
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:33,433
How is your mother?

311
00:25:33,677 --> 00:25:35,577
Still breaking hearts.

312
00:25:36,313 --> 00:25:37,610
Pizza time.

313
00:25:38,082 --> 00:25:39,674
She should have married me.

314
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,877
You should have went to the gym
and lost weight.

315
00:25:41,952 --> 00:25:45,820
l'd have lost the weight if she married me.
Otherwise, what's the point?

316
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:49,620
l really need your help.
l got to get to Rex Crater.

317
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:51,556
Forget it. Nobody gets to him.

318
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:55,120
-Who the hell is this guy?
-A myth, an enigma.

319
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,633
He lives in a penthouse
above the Lunar Grand Hotel.

320
00:26:00,003 --> 00:26:01,402
Never comes out.

321
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:03,201
You was a cop for 20 years.

322
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:05,468
You got to have some kind of idea
who he is.

323
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:07,407
Some people think he's a clone.

324
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,538
There was a clone doctor
named Runa Pedanken.

325
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:15,850
Made a big name for herself creating
a basketball team from one old guy.

326
00:26:16,153 --> 00:26:17,518
The Air Jordans.

327
00:26:19,056 --> 00:26:23,049
Right after cloning was outlawed
back Earth, Pedanken came up here.

328
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:26,262
She was the best in her field
until she got herself murdered.

329
00:26:26,463 --> 00:26:28,158
That was about eight years ago.

330
00:26:32,002 --> 00:26:34,334
l'm going to need to hack into police files.

331
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:37,233
You mean, you need me
to hack into police files.

332
00:26:37,608 --> 00:26:39,303
l thought you'd never ask.

333
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:46,880
Pedanken, Runa. lnitiate global search.

334
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:51,420
File deleted.

335
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:53,785
Sorry, that's all there is.

336
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:56,954
She wasn't doing this by herself.
Who worked with her?

337
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:59,291
She had an assistant.

338
00:26:59,596 --> 00:27:02,861
We questioned her for days
about the murder. Got nothing.

339
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,458
That's because you have no finesse.
Who is she and where do l find her?

340
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:07,663
Mona Zimmer.

341
00:27:10,807 --> 00:27:14,106
Runs a body alteration shop
on Microsoft and Sixth.

342
00:27:14,178 --> 00:27:15,543
That's what l love about you.

343
00:27:15,612 --> 00:27:18,672
l ask you a simple question,
four hours later, l get a simple answer.

344
00:27:38,202 --> 00:27:39,533
Boss?

345
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:43,038
Where did the boss go?

346
00:27:43,273 --> 00:27:46,936
l don't know. Out.
He said to wait for him here.

347
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:48,272
Out?

348
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:50,638
He never goes anywhere without me.

349
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:54,542
And l heard that toaster crack.

350
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:57,782
Bruno, give me that old badge you got.

351
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:01,991
-Who are we going to arrest?
-l need your help.

352
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:04,883
Sure.

353
00:28:05,963 --> 00:28:07,191
Where are we going?

354
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:10,427
lt's just got to be the two of us.
You go next time. Promise.

355
00:28:12,936 --> 00:28:14,961
That's gratitude for you.

356
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:32,454
We were hoping that for our anniversary
we could get a brand-new us.

357
00:28:33,123 --> 00:28:34,613
How romantic.

358
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,990
You're in luck!

359
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,086
l just happen to have a cancellation.

360
00:28:40,163 --> 00:28:41,289
Fantastic!

361
00:28:41,365 --> 00:28:45,301
Are you all original
or have you been previously improved?

362
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:47,729
All original.

363
00:28:48,005 --> 00:28:48,903
Really?

364
00:28:48,972 --> 00:28:51,065
Yes, from top to bottom.

365
00:28:51,141 --> 00:28:54,508
Okay, then.
Well, what exactly did you have in mind?

366
00:28:54,878 --> 00:28:59,042
We were thinking we could start
with some ass-resculpting for her...

367
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:01,516
...to get a little more bubblage--

368
00:29:02,052 --> 00:29:03,986
l happen to have a great ass!

369
00:29:04,054 --> 00:29:07,387
l'm not saying your ass isn't great.
We'd like something--

370
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:10,419
Could you do something
about his big mouth?

371
00:29:10,494 --> 00:29:13,361
Do you have any catalogues?
Maybe we could get some ideas.

372
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,866
Come this way,
l'll show you exactly what you want.

373
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:18,123
Thank you.

374
00:29:18,302 --> 00:29:20,964
Come on, honey.
Look at the asses on the wall.

375
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:22,562
Yeah. Don't push it.

376
00:29:33,317 --> 00:29:35,717
Let's start with some
of the basic body types.

377
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:39,085
Here's one l think you'll really like.
The Amazon.

378
00:29:40,257 --> 00:29:44,216
l don't like that. That makes me
look like a big dufus, doesn't it?

379
00:29:44,394 --> 00:29:47,727
-Where would we buy clothes?
-l don't want to be the big dufus.

380
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:49,763
Good point. Let me try again.

381
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:53,901
This one l'm particularly proud of.

382
00:29:54,204 --> 00:29:56,365
The Venice Beach.

383
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:03,613
Wait a minute.
l think you done found something there.

384
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,908
Look at that, honey.

385
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:07,276
Yeah, look at that. Look at me!

386
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:09,516
This is me?

387
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,809
lt could be.

388
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:13,685
Honey, l'm looking and l'm thinking...

389
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:17,887
...that you need to rethink the ass
enhancement. lt will work, it will help out.

390
00:30:18,428 --> 00:30:20,692
What you want is to have a.... You know?

391
00:30:21,698 --> 00:30:25,634
She also needs a little more of this, too,
up top. Can you fix this?

392
00:30:26,036 --> 00:30:29,665
lf you could spruce these up a little.
Just a little sprucier.

393
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,605
l know that she has ample now.

394
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:35,634
But l'm talking titties galore.
Let's have the titties really flowing.

395
00:30:39,449 --> 00:30:41,110
Yeah, like that.

396
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:43,943
Look at that.

397
00:30:45,455 --> 00:30:47,980
Why don't we step into my office
and discuss the terms?

398
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:50,891
Yes, let's go in and sign up! Look at that!

399
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:57,862
Before we get started, there's a few things
l'd like to talk over with you.

400
00:30:57,934 --> 00:31:00,198
First of all, will you be paying in cash...

401
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,569
...or would you like to take advantage
of our flexible financing plan?

402
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,937
All in cash, all at once.

403
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:08,705
-Excellent! Medical records?
-Right here.

404
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:10,303
And police permit?

405
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:14,447
Our police permits?

406
00:31:14,518 --> 00:31:19,615
l think you'll find
that our police permits are in order.

407
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:21,518
Police permits.

408
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:26,190
Sorry, no can do. Not without
a police permit. lt's Body Alteration 101 .

409
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:28,561
You could be fugitives, killers, anybody.

410
00:31:28,632 --> 00:31:32,762
No, we're just a couple trying
to put the spark back in our relationship.

411
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:35,702
The idea of revealing such personal details
to the police.

412
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:37,672
Please, Dr. Zimmer?

413
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:41,299
All right. Come back tonight, 8:00 sharp.

414
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:43,903
But it's another $10,000 upon completion.

415
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,141
All right. Then, doctor, you are busted.

416
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,042
Give me a break.
What are you guys, the Health Department?

417
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,283
You wish we were.
Listen, you got one chance.

418
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:56,915
You answer some questions for me.
And l want the truth.

419
00:31:57,127 --> 00:31:58,788
Okay, what do you want to know?

420
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:02,164
-When you worked for Runa Pedanken--
-l never heard of her.

421
00:32:02,232 --> 00:32:05,065
You want to play games?
Put the cuffs on her.

422
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:06,529
Come on, cuff her.

423
00:32:08,371 --> 00:32:09,804
No! Just hold on!

424
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:11,367
Hold the cuffs.

425
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:15,309
Tell me everything you know
and don't play games with me, Mona.

426
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:17,676
Talk to me. What do you know?
Right now.

427
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:20,816
All right, all right.

428
00:32:21,117 --> 00:32:24,575
Towards the end, Runa was dealing
with some pretty heavy characters...

429
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:28,784
...but she didn't tell me who.
And she didn't keep any records.

430
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:33,353
But one day l walked into her office
as she was showing one of the guys out...

431
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,591
...and he left his briefcase behind.

432
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:38,997
The initials WZW were embossed on it...

433
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:40,734
...in gold.

434
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:45,102
And it was made out
of genuine alligator skin. Are you with me?

435
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:46,540
Earth goods.

436
00:32:46,743 --> 00:32:48,802
That's all l know. l swear it.

437
00:32:50,347 --> 00:32:55,046
Just for the record, l have never had
one complaint about my ass.

438
00:32:55,218 --> 00:32:59,780
l was just playing. l said that for the lady.
lt was part of the scam.

439
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,987
Ma, what are you doing here?

440
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:07,927
Seeing that you're all right.

441
00:33:08,265 --> 00:33:10,233
Ma, this is Dina. Dina, my mother.

442
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,594
You're his mother?

443
00:33:11,768 --> 00:33:13,736
Why, you got a problem with that?

444
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:16,429
l'm surprised.
You could easily pass for his sister.

445
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,507
Thank you.

446
00:33:17,574 --> 00:33:20,202
Why are you gallivanting around?
You'll wind up dead.

447
00:33:20,277 --> 00:33:22,905
l got to take care of those guys
that blew up my club.

448
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:25,777
-You got to get your ass off the Moon!
-l don't think so.

449
00:33:25,949 --> 00:33:30,113
You think you're a hot-shit, ex-rill-hopping,
burned-down-club-owning guy...

450
00:33:30,186 --> 00:33:32,245
...but once in a while, listen to your mother.

451
00:33:32,322 --> 00:33:36,224
All right, l'll get off the Moon!
But can l get something to eat first?

452
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:37,823
God!

453
00:33:37,894 --> 00:33:39,759
Bruno, get some beer and sandwiches.

454
00:33:41,431 --> 00:33:44,400
And you ought to be a little nicer
to your robot.

455
00:33:44,668 --> 00:33:46,568
Be nicer to my robot?

456
00:33:52,108 --> 00:33:54,099
You been in here bitching to my moms?

457
00:34:01,918 --> 00:34:02,942
Gentlemen.

458
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:05,118
Suite with a hot tub?

459
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:09,284
Which room is Nash in?
Lie to me and l will blow your head off.

460
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:10,748
3D.

461
00:34:14,097 --> 00:34:16,292
You take the stairs.
You two, take the elevator.

462
00:34:16,366 --> 00:34:18,095
Let the robots take the stairs.

463
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:19,567
You stay here.

464
00:34:20,804 --> 00:34:23,864
Pluto, this is Roy. You got company.

465
00:34:25,308 --> 00:34:26,866
We got to move out of here.

466
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:36,450
Come on, this way!

467
00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:42,355
Bruno, check and see
if we can get out the window!

468
00:34:46,796 --> 00:34:49,390
Model DRL '84.

469
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:51,829
Very nice.

470
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:53,358
Bruno!

471
00:34:54,404 --> 00:34:55,871
Excuse me.

472
00:34:57,507 --> 00:34:59,202
Too high to jump!

473
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,944
Bruno, see what you can do
with these bolts.

474
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:10,846
Okay. Ready?

475
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:14,212
Go!

476
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:27,363
Freeze!

477
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:28,999
Raise your hands!

478
00:35:31,941 --> 00:35:34,171
Excuse me. Can l get through here?

479
00:35:34,544 --> 00:35:36,239
Go back to your room, lady.

480
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,354
-Nice shooting, Ma!
-Thanks, baby.

481
00:35:46,723 --> 00:35:48,088
l'll call you back.

482
00:35:48,258 --> 00:35:49,555
Stay here!

483
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:21,651
Bruno, enough!

484
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:24,283
Rowland, it's Pluto.

485
00:36:24,461 --> 00:36:26,622
l got to get to the Far Side.

486
00:36:26,796 --> 00:36:28,821
l need you to get me a spacesuit.

487
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:32,731
Make that two spacesuits.
One for a female about 5'7''.

488
00:36:32,902 --> 00:36:34,665
l'll tell you when l get there.

489
00:36:50,954 --> 00:36:53,479
-This is Dina.
-Nice to meet you.

490
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:54,712
Hi. Thanks.

491
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,452
l'm getting ready to leave town.

492
00:36:56,526 --> 00:36:58,721
How will you get to the Far Side?
Walk there?

493
00:36:58,795 --> 00:37:01,764
l got that covered.
l'm arranging for some transportation.

494
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:04,363
That's it.

495
00:37:07,303 --> 00:37:11,171
-Code generator serial number?
-8-7-4-3-5-0-8.

496
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:12,702
Check.

497
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,586
lt's not my business, but why don't we
just rent a car instead of stealing one?

498
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,317
Because you can't rent these.

499
00:37:29,392 --> 00:37:33,761
-What's so special about it?
-lt's a Chrysler DeSoto S-5000.

500
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,994
lt cruises on a 14-inch cushion of air,
hikes up to 64 inches in rough terrain.

501
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:41,400
lt's heat and meteor resistant,
with a torque compressor power thrust...

502
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:43,234
...and a kick-ass sound system.

503
00:37:44,007 --> 00:37:46,601
Trust me on this one.
Bruno, l need an ignition chip.

504
00:37:50,046 --> 00:37:51,570
This might do the trick.

505
00:37:53,116 --> 00:37:54,447
lt will work perfect.

506
00:37:54,517 --> 00:37:58,214
Got to love a place where your bodyguard
and car have interchangeable parts.

507
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,558
Smart-ass. After you.

508
00:38:16,606 --> 00:38:20,906
Good evening, Mr. Vandervoort.
James here. Aren't you early, sir?

509
00:38:22,512 --> 00:38:26,676
We're surprising Mrs. Vandervoort
with some jam and scones...

510
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:29,445
...and picking her up
at a spa on the Far Side.

511
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:31,644
You're not Mr. Vandervoort at all.

512
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:34,349
You're some hooligan
trying to steal his motorcar.

513
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:35,755
l won't have it!

514
00:38:35,825 --> 00:38:38,157
Shut up and drive. Head for the Far Side.

515
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:41,994
l'll give you to the count of three
before l alert the authorities. One.

516
00:38:42,065 --> 00:38:45,592
Sorry, James. You're too late.
l have disconnected your alarm relay.

517
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:53,338
So get moving, Jimmy boy,
or you'll have a speech impediment.

518
00:38:54,544 --> 00:38:56,307
Good God, l'm being stolen!

519
00:39:24,507 --> 00:39:26,065
Take over for a while, James.

520
00:39:26,242 --> 00:39:28,972
l will not be an accomplice in this.

521
00:39:29,045 --> 00:39:31,707
You're not an accomplice,
you're a hostage. Do it.

522
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:34,045
-l won't be intimidated.
-Do it!

523
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:35,106
All right.

524
00:39:35,518 --> 00:39:36,815
Thank you.

525
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:39,486
Nice work, James.

526
00:39:39,656 --> 00:39:42,250
Yeah, James. You little asshole.

527
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:43,583
l heard that.

528
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:46,962
-How are you holding up?
-Fine.

529
00:39:47,563 --> 00:39:50,327
Hey, listen,
l won't let anything happen to you.

530
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:52,295
l promise.

531
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,799
All right.

532
00:39:58,341 --> 00:40:00,536
How long does the night last up here?

533
00:40:00,977 --> 00:40:01,966
Two weeks.

534
00:40:02,345 --> 00:40:06,338
-That's so depressing.
-No, it's not. lt's nice. Look at this.

535
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:16,417
When l was a little boy,
l used to come out here with Rowland...

536
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:19,689
...look up and count the stars,
and dream about what was out there.

537
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:22,629
l never heard such drivel in my life!

538
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:25,898
What kind of refreshments
you got back here?

539
00:40:26,002 --> 00:40:29,062
Dreadfully sorry, sir.
We weren't expecting anyone.

540
00:40:29,272 --> 00:40:32,469
l know you got something.
You going to make me house it?

541
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:38,176
Champagne and caviar!

542
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:40,578
Don't touch those, they're for guests!

543
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,709
James, we are guests.

544
00:40:47,623 --> 00:40:50,183
He'll get her drunk
and have his way with her.

545
00:40:50,393 --> 00:40:51,951
You know something?

546
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:59,327
Bad luck, old boy!

547
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:29,363
We were ambushed?

548
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:31,393
-Ambushed?
-Yes, sir.

549
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:34,968
Really? Well, they're just not playing fair.

550
00:41:35,171 --> 00:41:40,165
Any other excuses? Problems at home,
cold coming on, work too stressful? What?

551
00:41:40,276 --> 00:41:41,937
-Nothing, sir.
-Good.

552
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:45,603
Because the next time l talk to Rex Crater,
l need to say Nash is dead.

553
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:48,275
-That's all he wants to hear.
-lt's as good as done.

554
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:49,817
Or else you are.

555
00:41:51,354 --> 00:41:52,548
Get out of here.

556
00:41:54,323 --> 00:41:56,052
We'll get right on it, sir.

557
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:13,902
Where are we?

558
00:42:14,077 --> 00:42:16,602
Safe. lt's an old prospecting dome.

559
00:42:16,846 --> 00:42:19,679
We found it years back.
Nobody knows about it but me and Bruno.

560
00:42:28,925 --> 00:42:31,120
What's the temperature out here?

561
00:42:31,494 --> 00:42:33,428
lt's about 200 below.

562
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:34,961
Balmy.

563
00:43:02,191 --> 00:43:04,625
Play's over. Get down here.

564
00:43:04,961 --> 00:43:06,121
Okay.

565
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:19,468
That was fun.

566
00:43:34,023 --> 00:43:37,925
Memories.
Had a lot of memories in here, Bruno.

567
00:43:38,861 --> 00:43:40,419
Look at all this junk.

568
00:43:40,663 --> 00:43:43,826
What do you mean ''junk''?
This is called inventory.

569
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:47,603
Show a little respect.
This is what's left of my life's work.

570
00:44:09,425 --> 00:44:11,450
Very interesting help you have around here.

571
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:13,995
That's an old program l forgot to delete.

572
00:44:14,263 --> 00:44:17,357
Left it on ''Oops! ''
l forgot that was in there.

573
00:44:28,444 --> 00:44:29,775
Miss me?

574
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:31,703
Guess not.

575
00:44:32,748 --> 00:44:37,549
She's an excellent piece
of multi-functional software.

576
00:44:39,889 --> 00:44:41,720
lnitiate search.

577
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:46,089
Convicted organized crime,
Earthling, initials WZW.

578
00:44:46,896 --> 00:44:47,885
WZW.

579
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,998
No WZW.

580
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:56,400
Nothing. Thank you.
Thanks for nothing. Worthless computer.

581
00:44:56,606 --> 00:44:57,732
How's it going?

582
00:44:57,807 --> 00:44:59,604
lt's not going at all.

583
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:01,742
Babette made lunch.

584
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:04,104
Thank you. Thank you so much.

585
00:45:05,548 --> 00:45:07,413
Can l help?

586
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,517
Computer's got no information
on our mystery man.

587
00:45:10,686 --> 00:45:13,917
l'm starting to think
that that Zimmer conned us.

588
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:18,359
Here's your problem.
Zimmer said WZW, not MZM.

589
00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:20,824
You're just looking at it upside--

590
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,688
Wait a minute.

591
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:28,629
You did it! Look at you! You're a genius!

592
00:45:29,005 --> 00:45:31,997
Look what you did.
She saw it upside down.

593
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:34,041
Watch this.

594
00:45:35,244 --> 00:45:40,113
lnitiate search. Convicted organized crime,
Earthling, initials MZM.

595
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:48,480
Okay. You see? Now we have something.

596
00:45:48,624 --> 00:45:50,751
Open file 10-1 7 MM.

597
00:45:52,395 --> 00:45:54,829
How do you feel about your acquittal,
Mr. Marucci?

598
00:45:54,897 --> 00:45:58,458
Makes me proud to live in this great
country where justice is still served.

599
00:45:58,534 --> 00:46:01,799
With gambling to be outlawed on Earth,
will the Giovanetto syndicate...

600
00:46:01,871 --> 00:46:05,363
...engender a consortium to perpetuate
a new gambling coalition on the Moon?

601
00:46:05,441 --> 00:46:08,239
Will the what do what to the what?
Speak English, sweetheart.

602
00:46:08,311 --> 00:46:11,371
Will you and the other major
organized crime figures on Earth--

603
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:15,481
Organized crime?
l don't know nobody in organized crime.

604
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:18,550
Listen, darling...

605
00:46:18,621 --> 00:46:21,590
...you want to ask me a question,
let's sit down somewhere.

606
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:24,490
We'll open a bottle of wine,
get to know each other better.

607
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,755
Get a new dress, a nice pair of shoes.

608
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:29,093
Be at my hotel around 7:00.

609
00:46:30,232 --> 00:46:32,860
What are you waiting for, a dance?

610
00:46:37,907 --> 00:46:39,932
l forgot the stairs were there.

611
00:46:43,412 --> 00:46:44,743
Back it up.

612
00:46:46,882 --> 00:46:49,510
Let me take it in a little closer here.

613
00:46:50,252 --> 00:46:52,152
And closer still.

614
00:46:52,822 --> 00:46:54,312
What do you see?

615
00:46:55,191 --> 00:46:57,887
So Mike Marucci is Rex Crater?

616
00:46:59,795 --> 00:47:01,023
One way to find out.

617
00:47:01,564 --> 00:47:04,089
That's pretty far-fetched, Pluto.

618
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,295
But l buy it.

619
00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:09,664
Marucci had the bucks, he had the balls.

620
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:12,264
He had the background
to build Moon Beach.

621
00:47:12,575 --> 00:47:15,942
Not to mention he wouldn't mind
whacking anybody who got in his way.

622
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:17,342
So l noticed.

623
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,211
Pluto, when you make an enemy,
you don't mess around.

624
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:23,450
Yeah, you know me.

625
00:47:23,786 --> 00:47:26,812
l'm gonna see an old buddy at the FBl,
l'll get back to you.

626
00:47:26,922 --> 00:47:27,911
Right.

627
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,726
Listen to that! That's Connecticut.
Listen how clear.

628
00:47:35,064 --> 00:47:36,053
What's this?

629
00:47:37,032 --> 00:47:41,628
No, don't do that! Stop!
That's a cryogenic Chihuahua!

630
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:43,997
lt's a real dog?

631
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:47,201
Yeah, it's very delicate.
You know it's illegal to bring pets here.

632
00:47:47,276 --> 00:47:50,905
But l got a friend back in Juárez
who knows how to freeze-dry these things.

633
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,504
Look at that. lt's a girl.

634
00:47:52,915 --> 00:47:56,510
Pop that little bitch in the particle wave
for two minutes on defrost...

635
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:58,743
...she'll be running around the room.

636
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:01,549
l used to get $5,000 a pop for these things.

637
00:48:02,525 --> 00:48:04,425
Where'd you do your singing back Earth?

638
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:07,562
Weddings, bar mitzvahs,
reincarnation rituals.

639
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,428
The usual gigs. l hit a rut...

640
00:48:10,499 --> 00:48:15,232
...so l sent my tape to a club l heard about
up here. Figured, what the hell?

641
00:48:15,771 --> 00:48:18,501
They sent me a one-way ticket.

642
00:48:18,574 --> 00:48:20,906
But when l got here,
the place had been sold.

643
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:26,374
l checked the water tanks.
We have enough to stay here for months.

644
00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:27,777
What about food?

645
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:28,839
Plenty.

646
00:48:28,918 --> 00:48:32,012
Let's have a dinner party.
Let's change the mood in this place.

647
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:33,786
All right.

648
00:48:35,691 --> 00:48:38,592
He seems a little.... Does he get angry?

649
00:48:38,661 --> 00:48:42,654
No. He has a happiness chip
l had installed. That's why he's always....

650
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,728
-Does he mind when you make fun of him?
-No, the happiness chip.

651
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:51,034
l wish l had a happiness chip
in my ass so l'd always be happy.

652
00:48:51,707 --> 00:48:55,473
Has one-sixth gravity been giving you
chronic back pain?

653
00:48:55,544 --> 00:49:00,641
We at the Lunar Lumbar Clinic specialize
in replacing the lumbar vertebrae...

654
00:49:00,716 --> 00:49:04,345
...with our patented
epoxy spinal substitute.

655
00:49:06,322 --> 00:49:09,155
You see,
once Dr. Pedanken was murdered...

656
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:12,191
...there's no link
to prove a Marucci clone ever existed!

657
00:49:12,261 --> 00:49:16,220
-Please, after we eat, okay?
-Now l got to buy you dinner, too?

658
00:49:19,902 --> 00:49:21,369
l'll tell you, Jack...

659
00:49:21,437 --> 00:49:24,998
...detective work was a lot easier
before they invented cloning.

660
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:27,767
At least you knew who your friends were.

661
00:49:40,956 --> 00:49:43,390
Who is that?
Nobody even has this number.

662
00:49:44,727 --> 00:49:46,786
-Ma!
-Pluto!

663
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:49,626
Get off this line.
What if somebody is tracing this call?

664
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:53,498
Pluto, Rowland is dead!
They found him murdered.

665
00:49:55,204 --> 00:49:58,640
How could they do this?
l can't believe this.

666
00:49:59,942 --> 00:50:03,708
Pluto, please get off the Moon!
They're going to kill you, too.

667
00:50:04,113 --> 00:50:05,307
Did you hear me?

668
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:08,179
l got some business
to take care of. l'll be back in touch.

669
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:09,748
Pluto.

670
00:50:10,052 --> 00:50:11,314
Bruno!

671
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,986
-Come on!
-Yes, boss!

672
00:50:14,256 --> 00:50:16,087
They killed Rowland!

673
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:21,389
You know why? We came too close
to the truth. lt's time to confront Marucci!

674
00:50:21,564 --> 00:50:24,124
-We better wear protection.
-You'll be safe here.

675
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:25,689
You're leaving me behind?

676
00:50:26,969 --> 00:50:30,427
-What is that?
-Recreational vehicle approaching.

677
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:46,646
Let's get it right this time, okay?

678
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:55,661
Registered to Lunar Grand Hotel.

679
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:58,996
-What the hell is that?
-l'd put on my spacesuit if l were you.

680
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:11,007
l count five of them.

681
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:15,244
Four with 43-K Magnums
and one Scorpion rocket launcher.

682
00:51:15,317 --> 00:51:18,309
-lnitiate countermeasures!
-There are no countermeasures.

683
00:51:18,454 --> 00:51:22,322
-Break out all the assault weapons!
-We sold them, remember?

684
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:25,560
Where's that big-ass street sweeper
with the supercharger?

685
00:51:25,628 --> 00:51:27,152
lt's at your mom's.

686
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:29,820
Great! What are we going to do?

687
00:51:30,532 --> 00:51:31,624
Bathroom!

688
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,529
-Bathroom?
-Yeah, come on!

689
00:51:33,702 --> 00:51:36,000
Babette, secure yourself!

690
00:51:44,913 --> 00:51:46,403
Bruno, hold us down!

691
00:52:29,658 --> 00:52:31,649
Johnson, stay with me.

692
00:52:31,827 --> 00:52:34,728
You three, go in and make sure we got him.

693
00:52:38,467 --> 00:52:39,798
Where are you going?

694
00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:00,053
Get back!

695
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,849
Come here!

696
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:08,724
-What are you doing?
-Saving your ass!

697
00:53:21,176 --> 00:53:22,165
Shit!

698
00:53:22,544 --> 00:53:23,977
Johnson, behind you!

699
00:53:39,294 --> 00:53:40,591
Goddamn it!

700
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:56,100
Stay with me!

701
00:54:13,796 --> 00:54:14,990
James, open up!

702
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:29,633
Bruno!

703
00:54:29,711 --> 00:54:31,338
Bruno!

704
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,840
Let's go!

705
00:54:57,573 --> 00:55:01,270
-How did they find us?
-Obviously you did something stupid.

706
00:55:22,664 --> 00:55:23,688
That's good.

707
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:26,463
Hold it.

708
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:28,131
Engage power thrust, now!

709
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:30,330
Why don't you just give yourself up?

710
00:55:34,076 --> 00:55:37,842
-Engage the power thrust right now!
-Power thrust engaged.

711
00:55:59,935 --> 00:56:01,732
We lost them. We're good to go now.

712
00:56:01,803 --> 00:56:04,966
Who's going to pay for the damage
to the vehicle...

713
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,338
...not to mention the caviar
and champagne?

714
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:08,637
l'll send you a check.

715
00:56:13,882 --> 00:56:14,780
Shit!

716
00:56:19,154 --> 00:56:21,213
-Ram them.
-What?

717
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:22,314
Ram them!

718
00:56:28,797 --> 00:56:30,025
Stay on them.

719
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:32,265
Okay!

720
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:47,178
Go, go, go!

721
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:00,986
Die, die, Pluto Nash.

722
00:57:03,498 --> 00:57:04,863
-l'm hit!
-Quiet!

723
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:06,000
l'm hit!

724
00:57:08,537 --> 00:57:10,402
Bruno, you see that rill right there?

725
00:57:11,173 --> 00:57:12,731
No rills, please!

726
00:57:13,108 --> 00:57:15,201
lt's a clear approach and a perfect lip!

727
00:57:15,277 --> 00:57:17,370
-What's a rill?
-That's a rill!

728
00:57:22,284 --> 00:57:23,751
Pluto.

729
00:57:25,053 --> 00:57:27,112
-Are you crazy?
-Hold on!

730
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,321
Say when, Bruno!

731
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:31,288
Three, two, one...

732
00:57:31,626 --> 00:57:32,490
...go!

733
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:41,970
Stop, stop!

734
00:58:14,102 --> 00:58:16,696
That's why they call us rill-hoppers.

735
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:18,863
l think l'm going to be sick.

736
00:58:20,776 --> 00:58:22,710
Evacuate! Evacuate!

737
00:58:22,844 --> 00:58:24,004
Put your helmet on!

738
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:25,307
-Why?
-Hurry, get it on!

739
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,506
Where are you going?

740
00:58:26,581 --> 00:58:28,879
-Overboard, brother.
-lt's been real, James.

741
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:32,386
Great, so l'll just sit here
and blow up, shall l?

742
00:58:38,026 --> 00:58:40,256
-Can we go home now?
-No!

743
00:58:40,495 --> 00:58:41,757
Get us to the other side.

744
00:58:50,305 --> 00:58:51,294
All right.

745
00:58:52,107 --> 00:58:57,044
Even if they bailed out before the explosion,
they still couldn't survive out here, right?

746
00:59:00,315 --> 00:59:01,111
Let's go.

747
00:59:01,716 --> 00:59:04,378
Excuse me, could you give me a lift?

748
00:59:04,553 --> 00:59:08,319
l have some information
about the people that you're looking for.

749
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:13,622
Come back here!
l can help you find them, you bastards!

750
00:59:15,897 --> 00:59:17,296
What do we do now?

751
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:18,861
We start walking.

752
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:21,231
We don't have any food or water.

753
00:59:21,503 --> 00:59:25,337
We'll run out of air long before
we need food and water. Trust me.

754
01:00:04,112 --> 01:00:07,548
-l can't breathe.
-Come on, Dina, hang in there.

755
01:00:11,753 --> 01:00:13,118
Hang in there.

756
01:00:17,626 --> 01:00:18,786
Dina.

757
01:00:19,494 --> 01:00:20,290
Dina.

758
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:33,474
Boss.

759
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:00,732
Boss...

760
01:01:01,937 --> 01:01:03,768
...battery...

761
01:01:04,839 --> 01:01:06,329
...low.

762
01:01:42,444 --> 01:01:43,934
Shit!

763
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:03,826
-Stay down or you'll pass out again.
-Okay.

764
01:02:05,133 --> 01:02:06,896
You on a nature walk or something?

765
01:02:06,968 --> 01:02:10,460
No, the thrusters on my vehicle blew out.

766
01:02:11,973 --> 01:02:13,804
What's going on? Where are we?

767
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:16,639
lt's okay. l just rescued you.
My name is Felix Laranga.

768
01:02:16,978 --> 01:02:19,344
Felix, l'm Pluto and that's Dina.

769
01:02:19,514 --> 01:02:20,503
Pluto?

770
01:02:20,815 --> 01:02:22,908
-Pluto Nash?
-Yeah.

771
01:02:23,618 --> 01:02:25,085
The Pluto Nash?

772
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:26,276
Yeah.

773
01:02:26,454 --> 01:02:28,615
Get out of here, l'm your number one fan!

774
01:02:28,923 --> 01:02:31,448
You're the reason
l got into the smuggling business.

775
01:02:31,526 --> 01:02:36,020
Honey, let me tell you something.
This man is the Tito Puente of rill-hopping.

776
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:38,691
Right here, this is the guy.

777
01:02:39,334 --> 01:02:43,430
Could you bring my robot inside?
He needs to be recharged.

778
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:50,571
Well, look, l had
a really bad robot experience once.

779
01:02:51,346 --> 01:02:55,043
l had this fine robot mamita
and l rented her out...

780
01:02:55,283 --> 01:02:58,810
...took her back to my place,
we started getting busy.

781
01:02:59,087 --> 01:03:03,524
All of a sudden, there's a malfunction,
and bam! She does a Terminator on me.

782
01:03:04,025 --> 01:03:07,620
Busted a couple of my ribs,
dislocated my shoulder.

783
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:09,524
l'm lucky l'm still alive.

784
01:03:09,864 --> 01:03:12,298
Don't worry about Bruno,
he's not going to hurt you.

785
01:03:12,934 --> 01:03:15,300
As long as you don't try
to get busy with him.

786
01:03:16,304 --> 01:03:20,502
Ordinarily, l'd say no.
But for Pluto Nash, l'll do anything.

787
01:03:20,842 --> 01:03:22,469
l appreciate it.

788
01:03:22,644 --> 01:03:25,511
You think you might be able
to give us a ride to Moon Beach?

789
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:28,874
Bro, l'll take you to Miami Beach
if that's where you got to go.

790
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:30,144
l'll be right back.

791
01:04:04,252 --> 01:04:06,049
Check it out.

792
01:04:06,287 --> 01:04:10,747
Lunar Grand Casino dice,
loaded and 100% undetectable.

793
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:14,385
You want a set, as a personal gift from me?

794
01:04:14,629 --> 01:04:17,427
Thanks, but l'm not really a big gambler.

795
01:04:17,565 --> 01:04:19,999
With those dice, you ain't gambling.

796
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:22,901
We're not going to gamble.
Thanks, but no, thanks.

797
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:27,367
lf you're not a gambler,
why are you going to Moon Beach?

798
01:04:27,442 --> 01:04:30,275
-l'm going to see an old friend of mine.
-Who's that?

799
01:04:30,445 --> 01:04:31,571
Rex Crater.

800
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:34,473
Rex Crater is a friend of yours?

801
01:04:34,716 --> 01:04:35,978
Yeah, sure.

802
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:39,518
Can you comp me a suite
with a sunken living room bathtub...

803
01:04:39,587 --> 01:04:42,385
...and a waterbed
with a mirror on the ceiling?

804
01:04:43,391 --> 01:04:44,619
Yeah, probably.

805
01:04:45,393 --> 01:04:46,553
Damn!

806
01:04:46,895 --> 01:04:49,557
Pluto Nash is down with Rex Crater.

807
01:05:05,914 --> 01:05:08,075
You know what, Felix?

808
01:05:10,485 --> 01:05:13,579
Take these Hillarys.
We appreciate your helping us out.

809
01:05:13,655 --> 01:05:15,885
No, you my man. You don't got to do that.

810
01:05:15,957 --> 01:05:18,517
Take this, you helped us out.
l appreciate it.

811
01:05:18,693 --> 01:05:20,661
l'm all right. l'll tell you what.

812
01:05:21,095 --> 01:05:23,563
-Would you sign my helmet for me?
-Get out of here.

813
01:05:23,631 --> 01:05:26,566
-Come on, give me an autograph.
-Are you serious?

814
01:05:26,634 --> 01:05:29,728
lt's not every day l get to hang out
with Pluto Nash.

815
01:05:30,872 --> 01:05:32,806
-Please.
-Okay, l'll sign it.

816
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:34,906
This is my first autograph.

817
01:05:35,176 --> 01:05:37,235
What do you want me to sign?

818
01:05:37,979 --> 01:05:39,469
''To Felix...

819
01:05:39,547 --> 01:05:44,507
...my buddy, who stuck with me through
thick and thin, who l'll never forget.''

820
01:05:46,721 --> 01:05:48,882
Bro, l just saved your life.

821
01:05:49,057 --> 01:05:53,221
''My buddy, who stuck with me
through thick and thin, and saved my ass.

822
01:05:53,595 --> 01:05:55,688
Peace and love, Pluto Nash.''

823
01:05:57,398 --> 01:06:00,162
What's all that stuff you got
on the rack back there?

824
01:06:00,235 --> 01:06:03,534
That's a new shipment of stuff
l just smuggled in from Puerto Rico.

825
01:06:03,705 --> 01:06:04,831
ls that right?

826
01:06:04,906 --> 01:06:08,103
Top of the line, designer labels.
Why, you need something?

827
01:06:08,176 --> 01:06:09,837
Yeah, we could use some clothes.

828
01:06:15,016 --> 01:06:18,349
Welcome to Moon Beach
and the Lunar Grand Hotel...

829
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,484
...where luck is always on your side.

830
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:27,692
Welcome to Moon Beach
and the Lunar Grand Hotel...

831
01:06:28,062 --> 01:06:30,826
...where luck is always on your side.

832
01:06:37,071 --> 01:06:39,938
Bruno, lay low for a minute.
Go get a magazine or something.

833
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:42,301
Meet us over by the elevators.

834
01:06:44,412 --> 01:06:49,179
Hey, good-looking, how about slipping up
to your room and playing with me awhile?

835
01:06:50,418 --> 01:06:52,784
Don't you want to do something
exciting tonight?

836
01:06:52,854 --> 01:06:53,878
No!

837
01:06:55,857 --> 01:06:58,257
Afraid you might get lucky?

838
01:07:07,936 --> 01:07:08,925
Hello.

839
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:10,960
Good evening. Checking in?

840
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,166
Actually, we're here to see Tony Francis.

841
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:15,141
The early show or the late show?

842
01:07:15,343 --> 01:07:19,302
We're old friends. We come to see him
in person. Where's his dressing room?

843
01:07:19,614 --> 01:07:21,138
l can't tell you that, sir.

844
01:07:21,316 --> 01:07:22,613
Really?

845
01:07:23,318 --> 01:07:26,685
Tell you what, just give us a room
and two tickets to the early show.

846
01:07:27,388 --> 01:07:30,448
All set. Just give me a thumb print
for the charges.

847
01:07:32,727 --> 01:07:34,422
l'll pay in cash.

848
01:07:36,264 --> 01:07:38,596
Cash is always easier.

849
01:07:40,635 --> 01:07:43,001
Mr. Francis' show is black tie.

850
01:07:43,471 --> 01:07:45,871
We have rentals available
from the concierge.

851
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,370
All prettied up for Tony? Absolutely.

852
01:07:51,379 --> 01:07:55,076
Peekaboo, l found you. Come on, big boy...

853
01:07:55,316 --> 01:07:58,285
...right here in the lobby! Oh, baby!

854
01:07:58,953 --> 01:08:00,614
You sick bastard!

855
01:08:00,888 --> 01:08:02,219
Security!

856
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,893
All set.

857
01:08:08,162 --> 01:08:09,493
Enjoy your stay.

858
01:08:10,098 --> 01:08:12,259
Crazy-ass Tony!

859
01:08:14,936 --> 01:08:16,563
All right. So far, so good.

860
01:08:16,871 --> 01:08:17,860
Come with us.

861
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:20,601
-What's the problem?
-ls he with you?

862
01:08:20,942 --> 01:08:23,740
Yes, he's my old friend from West Virginia.
What's going on?

863
01:08:24,579 --> 01:08:25,637
Nice try.

864
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:30,144
After you've paid for the damages
to this slot machine, we'll give Earl back.

865
01:08:30,218 --> 01:08:32,846
-Wait a second--
-Here's your claim check.

866
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,888
Pick your robot up when you leave.

867
01:08:35,123 --> 01:08:36,283
Let's go.

868
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,458
Sorry, boss.

869
01:08:39,694 --> 01:08:42,629
You're not a robot, you're an animal!

870
01:08:43,531 --> 01:08:44,998
Line it up!

871
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:51,597
Yo, baby, you love me?
'Cause l love me, too!

872
01:08:52,974 --> 01:08:54,407
Come here, baby!

873
01:08:54,742 --> 01:08:57,768
l want bottles of champagne
for those people over there....

874
01:09:04,152 --> 01:09:06,552
You ready? Blow!

875
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:12,418
Yo, Pluto! My man, Pluto Nash!

876
01:09:12,493 --> 01:09:14,085
Pluto Nash, come on!

877
01:09:15,463 --> 01:09:18,330
Come here, Pluto.
l want to show you how to win big time!

878
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:22,893
Pluto, where are you going? Come on!
They're giving away $1,000 chips!

879
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:24,562
Come here!

880
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:30,040
Mr. Belcher, Nash just walked in the lobby.

881
01:09:31,779 --> 01:09:33,644
Nash is alive.

882
01:09:34,849 --> 01:09:36,441
You idiots!

883
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,083
All day, all day!

884
01:09:41,155 --> 01:09:42,850
Watch this, honey!

885
01:09:44,492 --> 01:09:46,050
Want a sip of champagne?

886
01:09:49,163 --> 01:09:49,925
Let's go.

887
01:09:49,997 --> 01:09:53,797
Give me those back.
Get your hands off me or l'll have you fired.

888
01:09:53,868 --> 01:09:56,598
You know who l am? Felix Laranga!

889
01:09:57,071 --> 01:09:57,662
Who?

890
01:09:57,739 --> 01:09:59,832
You never heard of me
'cause you're stupid.

891
01:10:12,286 --> 01:10:16,723
Ladies and gentlemen,
the undisputed master of the universe...

892
01:10:17,258 --> 01:10:19,385
...Mr. Tony Francis!

893
01:10:48,656 --> 01:10:52,558
What an amazing act.
He's so different, so original.

894
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:53,849
Yeah.

895
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,666
What makes you so sure he'll help us out?

896
01:11:01,736 --> 01:11:04,569
He'll help us.
He couldn't sing a note if it weren't for me.

897
01:11:04,639 --> 01:11:06,664
You taught Tony Francis how to sing?

898
01:11:06,874 --> 01:11:10,332
No, l convinced a bookie
not to pour some acid down his throat.

899
01:11:28,095 --> 01:11:30,689
Pack your bags,
l'm taking you home with me!

900
01:11:31,399 --> 01:11:33,458
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

901
01:11:33,534 --> 01:11:36,401
Please welcome the master
of musical disaster...

902
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:39,132
...Ted Jefferies
and the Ted Jefferies Orchestra.

903
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:44,671
Hit it, maestro!

904
01:11:56,724 --> 01:11:59,284
There's a guy over there checking faces.

905
01:12:02,096 --> 01:12:03,461
Turn towards me.

906
01:12:15,509 --> 01:12:17,409
Okay, l think that worked.

907
01:12:21,282 --> 01:12:22,840
lt worked for me.

908
01:12:29,557 --> 01:12:33,493
You were so wonderful, Tony.
What a great show!

909
01:12:34,128 --> 01:12:36,494
lt was a magnificent evening, wasn't it?

910
01:12:36,864 --> 01:12:38,991
ls this the refund window?

911
01:12:40,635 --> 01:12:44,901
Pluto Nash! My goodness, it's marvelous
to see you! How have you been?

912
01:12:44,972 --> 01:12:46,837
l'll tell you about it. This is Dina.

913
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:49,570
-l loved your show.
-Tony loves you for loving his show.

914
01:12:49,644 --> 01:12:52,010
l want you to meet my wives,
Gina and Filomena.

915
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:54,843
A pleasure to meet you, Pluto and Dina.

916
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,711
My man, Anthony Frankowski!

917
01:12:58,953 --> 01:13:02,719
-lt's Francis, not Frankowski.
-Your wives don't know you're Polish?

918
01:13:02,823 --> 01:13:06,884
-Nobody knows. You'll blow my cover.
-All right, it's our little secret.

919
01:13:06,961 --> 01:13:08,588
You want to stay for dinner?

920
01:13:08,663 --> 01:13:13,600
We made osso buco and pork and gnocchi,
all Tony's mother's recipes.

921
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:15,429
No, thanks, we ate already.

922
01:13:17,238 --> 01:13:19,763
-You're a freak.
-You have no idea.

923
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:22,634
Can l talk to you in private?

924
01:13:22,877 --> 01:13:25,539
Absolutely.
Would you excuse us for a minute?

925
01:13:25,913 --> 01:13:26,743
Sure!

926
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:28,514
You married twins?

927
01:13:28,582 --> 01:13:31,881
They're not twins. l met the perfect woman
and l had her cloned.

928
01:13:32,153 --> 01:13:34,314
-Which one is which?
-Who cares?

929
01:13:35,356 --> 01:13:38,883
Me and your boss, Rex Crater,
we had a little misunderstanding.

930
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,689
What kind of misunderstanding?

931
01:13:40,761 --> 01:13:43,229
He tried to have me killed
and he blew up my club.

932
01:13:43,297 --> 01:13:45,356
-How do you know it was Crater?
-l know it.

933
01:13:45,433 --> 01:13:48,698
He offered to buy my club
and l wouldn't sell it, so they blew it up.

934
01:13:48,769 --> 01:13:49,497
Shit.

935
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:51,231
You got to help me get to Crater.

936
01:13:51,339 --> 01:13:55,173
-Babe, l'm fond of breathing, you dig?
-Just tell me how to get to him.

937
01:13:55,343 --> 01:13:58,574
l never even met him! He watches
my show from up in his penthouse.

938
01:13:58,646 --> 01:14:02,878
He sends down these messages:
''Your jokes suck. You walk like a peacock.''

939
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:05,441
You wouldn't be singing
if it wasn't for me, right?

940
01:14:06,654 --> 01:14:08,246
Come on, man.

941
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:13,192
l might know a way for you
to get up into his penthouse.

942
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:16,286
-After that you're on your own, Pluto.
-Thanks.

943
01:14:16,464 --> 01:14:19,831
Pick up Bruno and pay the damages
on that slot machine.

944
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:23,028
Rent a car and wait outside
the front entrance of the hotel.

945
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:24,865
l might have to make a fast getaway.

946
01:14:24,939 --> 01:14:28,272
-But what if you don't get away?
-l always get away.

947
01:14:28,776 --> 01:14:30,801
Come on, we'll go this way.

948
01:14:33,414 --> 01:14:36,474
Rex Crater's private penthouse elevator
is right next to mine.

949
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:40,486
There's a way for you
to get from my elevator into his.

950
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:43,654
How you doing?

951
01:14:43,724 --> 01:14:46,124
Trust me, you'll love this.

952
01:14:48,329 --> 01:14:51,765
All right, here we go.
l'll stop this so nobody bothers us.

953
01:15:07,815 --> 01:15:10,613
-l gotta get that later.
-Shit!

954
01:15:10,684 --> 01:15:13,448
That's Rex's elevator down there. See?

955
01:15:13,554 --> 01:15:16,114
lt only stops at the subbasement
and his penthouse.

956
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:18,351
My elevator only goes as low as this floor.

957
01:15:18,726 --> 01:15:20,990
How do l get from one elevator
to the other one?

958
01:15:21,062 --> 01:15:24,657
That's what Tony is here to help you with.
l'll tell you the whole thing.

959
01:15:24,732 --> 01:15:29,533
Back up as far as you can go,
get a good running start, jump out across.

960
01:15:30,938 --> 01:15:34,931
-Jump across to what?
-The ledge! See that ledge down there?

961
01:15:35,076 --> 01:15:38,443
Grab onto these wires
and swing down onto the ledge.

962
01:15:38,679 --> 01:15:41,477
-You want me to grab hot wires?
-How do you know they're hot?

963
01:15:41,549 --> 01:15:42,675
Look, the shit is hot!

964
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:46,911
Grab the ones that aren't hot.
Swing down, get down to the ledge.

965
01:15:46,987 --> 01:15:51,424
Then you wait an hour and a half
till they bring Rex's late supper up to him.

966
01:15:51,492 --> 01:15:54,893
When the elevator goes by,
before it passes you, you jump on top.

967
01:15:55,329 --> 01:15:58,958
Use this casino chip to unscrew
the trapdoor on top of the elevator.

968
01:15:59,033 --> 01:16:03,026
Jump down inside and take out
the two robot guards, pop-pop!

969
01:16:03,104 --> 01:16:06,870
Boom! You're alone in the elevator,
you got a meeting with Rex.

970
01:16:10,811 --> 01:16:12,438
What's plan B?

971
01:16:14,915 --> 01:16:16,507
This is Plan B.

972
01:16:17,585 --> 01:16:20,383
l'm here to accept Mr. Crater's offer.

973
01:16:20,454 --> 01:16:23,787
-ls that right?
-lt's all settled. $10 million.

974
01:16:25,993 --> 01:16:30,589
-We'll have to get back to you on that.
-l got to get ready for my next show.

975
01:16:31,565 --> 01:16:32,623
Get them out of here.

976
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:36,261
Sorry, your robot remains property
of this casino...

977
01:16:36,337 --> 01:16:39,272
...until the damages
to our slot machines are taken care of.

978
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,932
l'm here to pay you.

979
01:16:41,742 --> 01:16:43,733
Repairs hasn't sent down a bill yet.

980
01:16:44,845 --> 01:16:49,077
You would be a real peach
if you could get me that bill.

981
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:58,754
Harry, l got a Bruno '63 Deluxe.

982
01:16:58,826 --> 01:17:01,852
Wrecked a slot machine.
Owner wants to pick him up.

983
01:17:01,929 --> 01:17:02,987
How much they owe?

984
01:17:03,063 --> 01:17:05,759
l haven't even looked
at the damn thing yet.

985
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:07,630
Have him check with us tomorrow morning.

986
01:17:07,701 --> 01:17:09,168
What are they saying?

987
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:11,804
You'll be spending the night.

988
01:17:12,439 --> 01:17:14,236
lt's been fun.

989
01:17:21,882 --> 01:17:23,281
Excuse me.

990
01:17:27,388 --> 01:17:30,152
-l got to take a leak.
-Robots don't take leaks.

991
01:17:32,993 --> 01:17:34,654
You're absolutely right.

992
01:17:36,363 --> 01:17:37,352
Come on.

993
01:17:38,499 --> 01:17:40,330
We need to get a car.

994
01:17:43,037 --> 01:17:45,528
What are you in such a hurry for?

995
01:17:52,846 --> 01:17:55,178
You wanted to talk to Mr. Crater?

996
01:17:55,816 --> 01:17:56,805
Here you are.

997
01:18:03,123 --> 01:18:05,683
l finally get to meet the great Rex Crater?

998
01:18:05,993 --> 01:18:07,585
Or is it Mike Marucci?

999
01:18:07,928 --> 01:18:09,555
Yeah, Mike Marucci.

1000
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:12,190
Thought you were so damn smart,
l figured you out.

1001
01:18:12,533 --> 01:18:16,025
l should come over there
and put my foot in your fat grease-ball ass.

1002
01:18:27,248 --> 01:18:29,739
So you got it all figured out, huh?

1003
01:18:47,101 --> 01:18:49,763
lt is a pleasure to meet me.

1004
01:18:50,237 --> 01:18:52,228
l'm pretty feisty, huh?

1005
01:18:52,806 --> 01:18:54,740
What's this, a rented tuxedo?

1006
01:18:55,109 --> 01:18:57,475
You know, you're old enough
to own your own tuxedo.

1007
01:18:57,544 --> 01:19:00,377
Sit down! You know,
you should be honored.

1008
01:19:00,981 --> 01:19:04,473
Only person besides yourself
to ever come up here is Belcher over there.

1009
01:19:06,854 --> 01:19:08,219
What's going on here?

1010
01:19:08,289 --> 01:19:11,781
Remember when they cut your appendix
out eight years ago in prison?

1011
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:15,493
Gambling had just been outlawed on Earth,
so my old boss...

1012
01:19:15,562 --> 01:19:20,124
...Mike Marucci, commissioned
Dr. Runa Pedanken to create a clone...

1013
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,998
...of someone
who knew their way around the Moon.

1014
01:19:23,404 --> 01:19:24,336
For what?

1015
01:19:24,405 --> 01:19:28,637
He was starting a gambling operation
and needed someone to front for him.

1016
01:19:29,009 --> 01:19:31,239
Someone intelligent, that he could control.

1017
01:19:31,712 --> 01:19:32,770
A puppet.

1018
01:19:33,647 --> 01:19:38,744
That didn't jive with my career plan
so l sent Marucci and Pedanken into orbit.

1019
01:19:39,653 --> 01:19:43,145
Then, for sentimental reasons,
or because l'm a nice guy, l let you live.

1020
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:46,449
Until you got in my way.

1021
01:19:48,829 --> 01:19:51,024
Let's face it, why should l keep you around?

1022
01:19:51,098 --> 01:19:54,295
For what? l got your good looks,
your charm and your wit.

1023
01:19:54,702 --> 01:19:56,465
l even got your memories.

1024
01:19:56,904 --> 01:19:59,771
-You got my memories?
-Yeah.

1025
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,173
Never wondered how my people knew
to look for you in your hideout?

1026
01:20:03,243 --> 01:20:06,770
Or the Paradise Motel, which,
by the way, is a disgusting establishment.

1027
01:20:06,847 --> 01:20:09,645
l'm surprised you didn't break
into a rash after staying there.

1028
01:20:09,717 --> 01:20:12,379
Next time l'll remember
to find better accommodations.

1029
01:20:12,453 --> 01:20:14,444
Mr. Mogan and Mr. Kelp have arrived, sir.

1030
01:20:14,521 --> 01:20:16,648
Yes. By all means, send them in.

1031
01:20:17,191 --> 01:20:18,590
Mr. Mogan and Mr. Kelp.

1032
01:20:18,826 --> 01:20:21,260
l've been waiting for those two gentlemen.

1033
01:20:33,974 --> 01:20:35,339
-Boss?
-Quiet.

1034
01:20:35,409 --> 01:20:36,467
Hey, everybody!

1035
01:20:37,344 --> 01:20:38,743
Nash.

1036
01:20:39,146 --> 01:20:42,013
-What's Nash doing here?
-No, l'm Rex Crater.

1037
01:20:42,549 --> 01:20:43,982
No, you're Pluto Nash.

1038
01:20:44,051 --> 01:20:47,248
No, l beg to differ. l'm Rex Crater.

1039
01:20:47,554 --> 01:20:49,419
This is Pluto Nash.

1040
01:20:55,028 --> 01:20:56,120
Oh, my God.

1041
01:20:56,196 --> 01:20:58,357
lsn't it something? But enough about him.

1042
01:20:58,432 --> 01:21:02,664
Mr. Mogan, l want to personally thank you
for the outstanding job you've done.

1043
01:21:03,804 --> 01:21:05,169
Thank you, sir.

1044
01:21:05,639 --> 01:21:07,402
lt was a pleasure and an honor.

1045
01:21:07,508 --> 01:21:12,343
You see, when you have the experience
me and my men have, it's quite easy--

1046
01:21:16,116 --> 01:21:17,208
Oh, shit.

1047
01:21:17,551 --> 01:21:19,542
lncompetent jackasses.

1048
01:21:22,623 --> 01:21:24,090
Get them out of here.

1049
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:33,165
l'd love to let you hang around
so you can entertain me...

1050
01:21:33,233 --> 01:21:35,701
...but we might have a conflict of interest.

1051
01:21:35,769 --> 01:21:39,034
But there's something l want you to see
before l say bye-bye to you.

1052
01:21:55,355 --> 01:21:56,344
Look at that.

1053
01:21:56,990 --> 01:22:01,017
An excellent piece of real estate, but
you never took advantage of its potential.

1054
01:22:01,195 --> 01:22:02,321
This--

1055
01:22:05,032 --> 01:22:06,294
This is wrong.

1056
01:22:06,366 --> 01:22:09,460
That should say Rex's,
because this is Rex's.

1057
01:22:09,636 --> 01:22:13,128
Little America's most exclusive new casino!

1058
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,431
Tell me, what do you think?

1059
01:22:31,158 --> 01:22:34,355
Little America is not a gambling town
and Pluto's isn't a casino.

1060
01:22:34,428 --> 01:22:38,296
l think you're a clown and you should
take all this stupid casino shit out.

1061
01:22:38,365 --> 01:22:40,560
lf you get your dumb-ass name
off the front...

1062
01:22:40,634 --> 01:22:42,966
...maybe you'll be in business
for more than a week.

1063
01:22:44,905 --> 01:22:47,465
-Sorry, it's not wood, is it?
-Yes, and it's hand-carved!

1064
01:22:47,541 --> 01:22:48,769
Sorry! l'm sorry!

1065
01:22:48,842 --> 01:22:50,503
Pick that shit up!

1066
01:22:50,944 --> 01:22:51,911
Shit.

1067
01:23:15,335 --> 01:23:17,064
Hold it, right there, robot.

1068
01:23:26,446 --> 01:23:27,845
Which one's Pluto?

1069
01:23:28,015 --> 01:23:29,175
Which one's Rex?

1070
01:24:00,948 --> 01:24:02,142
Belcher!

1071
01:24:02,749 --> 01:24:04,944
-Shoot him, Belcher!
-Shoot him, Belcher!

1072
01:24:10,457 --> 01:24:11,446
Damn it!

1073
01:24:22,402 --> 01:24:24,370
What are you waiting for? Shoot him!

1074
01:24:24,438 --> 01:24:27,168
Don't aim at me, he's Nash! Shoot him!

1075
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,970
He's not me, l'm me! He's him!
Shoot him!

1076
01:24:30,043 --> 01:24:32,341
Boss, which one is you?

1077
01:24:32,412 --> 01:24:33,174
Pluto?

1078
01:24:33,246 --> 01:24:35,407
ldiots! He's the one in the rented tuxedo!

1079
01:24:35,482 --> 01:24:36,312
Rex!

1080
01:24:36,416 --> 01:24:37,405
Boss?

1081
01:24:38,018 --> 01:24:40,578
-lt's him!
-This piece of shit belongs to him!

1082
01:24:44,658 --> 01:24:45,682
Now shoot him!

1083
01:25:00,273 --> 01:25:03,606
-What's the matter with you guys?
-lt was hairy there for a minute.

1084
01:25:03,677 --> 01:25:04,871
Hairy for you?

1085
01:25:05,646 --> 01:25:07,546
Get the hell out of here! Get out!

1086
01:25:07,881 --> 01:25:09,542
Hairy, my ass.

1087
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:11,447
You sing, don't you?

1088
01:25:11,752 --> 01:25:14,118
You're a singer, right? l got a job for you.

1089
01:25:15,155 --> 01:25:16,816
Just kill me and get it over with.

1090
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:20,917
You're going to work, but not singing.
Waiting tables, six nights a week.

1091
01:25:20,994 --> 01:25:24,361
lf you're lucky and save your tips,
maybe you'll get back to Utah.

1092
01:25:30,003 --> 01:25:31,265
Pluto.

1093
01:25:32,072 --> 01:25:34,666
l didn't scare you, did l? You all right?

1094
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:38,299
Boss!

1095
01:25:39,346 --> 01:25:41,337
l was hoping it was you.

1096
01:25:43,884 --> 01:25:46,614
Never leave home
without an undershirt, right?

1097
01:25:47,421 --> 01:25:49,912
lsn't that what you always say?

1098
01:25:50,323 --> 01:25:53,451
Never leave home without an undershirt.
That's rule number one.

1099
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,018
l agree!

1100
01:26:18,685 --> 01:26:20,414
Craps, you lose!

1101
01:26:48,148 --> 01:26:50,981
For the grand reopening of Club Pluto...

1102
01:26:51,184 --> 01:26:54,347
...please welcome Miss Dina Lake!

1103
01:27:12,606 --> 01:27:13,937
Pluto!

1104
01:27:15,475 --> 01:27:17,340
Pluto, baby!

1105
01:27:17,644 --> 01:27:19,805
Fantastic club! Great joint, baby.

1106
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,508
Thanks a lot. Let me say
that the Mrs. Francis'...

1107
01:27:23,049 --> 01:27:25,984
-...are looking lovely tonight.
-Thank you, Pluto.

1108
01:27:26,052 --> 01:27:27,986
-Have a good time.
-All right, baby.

1109
01:27:28,288 --> 01:27:31,485
Did l tell you ladies how l got Pluto
started in the business?

1110
01:27:31,558 --> 01:27:33,025
Tell us, Tony.

1111
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:36,926
What about a ham sandwich without
the cheese? How much would that be?

1112
01:27:37,264 --> 01:27:38,231
Free!

1113
01:27:38,298 --> 01:27:42,098
Felix Laranga's money is no good here.
Knock yourself out, whatever you want.

1114
01:27:42,169 --> 01:27:43,363
Thanks, Pluto!

1115
01:27:43,436 --> 01:27:46,098
Pluto Nash, l love that man!

1116
01:27:46,206 --> 01:27:51,337
Honey, l tell you what: Eight steaks,
a crate of lobsters, shrimp cocktail...

1117
01:27:51,545 --> 01:27:54,639
...onion rings, fries, a doggy bag to go....

1118
01:28:06,193 --> 01:28:08,161
How is it going with you and Babette?

1119
01:28:08,228 --> 01:28:11,322
Me and Babette?
l don't think it's gonna happen.

1120
01:28:11,498 --> 01:28:15,229
l found out that l'm 1 10 volts
and she's a 220.

1121
01:28:15,302 --> 01:28:17,463
Go to the hardware store
and get an adapter.

1122
01:28:18,538 --> 01:28:21,666
No. That just ruins it for me.

1123
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:24,366
l guess it wasn't meant to be, huh?

1124
01:28:24,911 --> 01:28:27,379
Bruno, you see my new bodyguard
running around here?

1125
01:28:29,416 --> 01:28:33,216
-New bodyguard?
-l bought a '78, fully loaded, out the door.

1126
01:28:34,187 --> 01:28:36,178
Shall l begin disassembling myself.

1127
01:28:36,356 --> 01:28:39,484
lf you do that, how will you manage
my club in 500 pieces?

1128
01:28:39,793 --> 01:28:43,889
Manage? But no robot
has ever been in management.

1129
01:28:43,997 --> 01:28:45,225
You want the job or not?

1130
01:28:45,432 --> 01:28:47,195
Oh, boss!

1131
01:28:47,467 --> 01:28:49,230
Oh, thank you, boss!

1132
01:28:49,669 --> 01:28:51,933
You're the best boss on the whole Moon!

1133
01:28:53,673 --> 01:28:56,198
You almost broke my ribs.

1134
01:28:57,177 --> 01:29:00,374
Pull up a chair. Let's sit back
and celebrate and enjoy the party.

1135
01:29:00,714 --> 01:29:05,151
Sorry, no can do. We've got a pile of bills,
the payroll is tomorrow.

1136
01:29:05,285 --> 01:29:08,049
We need a new doorman
and we're low on shrimp.

1137
01:29:08,121 --> 01:29:09,952
l'm swamped!
