1
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,225
911. What is your emergency?

2
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:08,400
911. What is your
current location?

3
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,769
- Are you okay?
- Oh!

4
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,842
Turn around.

5
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,079
Turn around!

6
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,016
God! Sorry. I thought
you were dead.

7
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:26,385
No. I'm not dead!

8
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,887
I was sleeping.

9
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:32,758
Oh, God. Oh.

10
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,028
- You want me to call a paramedic?
- No!

11
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,131
Just... God!
Just back off!

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,235
Stop helping.

13
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,870
Butt out!

14
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,872
Creep!

15
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,474
Asshole!

16
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,496
Hi.

17
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,633
Hi. Hey. Sorry.

18
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:51,336
Um... where is this?

19
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,238
Excuse me?

20
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,509
I-I just... My car broke down
and my cell phone's dead,

21
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,912
so I just need to call...

22
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,383
What town is this?

23
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,618
New Smyrna Beach.

24
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,855
What?

25
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,816
Hey. Hey. What can I get ya?

26
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:13,719
Um, do you have a cell
phone charger I could use?

27
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,654
Everything okay?

28
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,557
Yeah, yeah. I just need
to use a phone.

29
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,828
Well, I don't bring my charger
to work, but you can use mine.

30
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,796
Thanks.

31
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,199
Actually, you know,
could I get a glass of water?

32
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,800
Yeah.

33
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,874
Do you have anything
for a headache?

34
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,276
Sorry.

35
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,964
Hello?
Hey, Dad?

36
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,632
Gracie.
Hey, it's me.

37
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,068
Oh, my God, Gracie. Where are you?
Are you okay?

38
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,171
Yes, I am fine. Why does
everybody keep asking me that?

39
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,939
- It's her
-  Where is she?

40
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,809
Listen, Dad, um, you're
not gonna believe this,

41
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,944
but the car got towed,

42
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:16,181
and I just need a few hundred
dollars to get it back.

43
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:19,518
- Gracie, where are you?
- Tell her to stay put.

44
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,753
I'm in Fort Lauderdale.

45
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,955
No, Gracie, you're not.
You're not.

46
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,124
I know where you are.
You're in New Smyrna Beach.

47
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:30,896
We arrived yesterday. So please, stop
lying and tell me where you are.

48
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,131
It's a coffee shop.
Where?

49
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,667
What's the place called?
Where is it?

50
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,203
I don't kn...
Then ask somebody.

51
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,272
Now!

52
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:44,343
- What's this place called?
- Nichols' Surf Café.

53
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,347
Um, Nichols' Surf Café.

54
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,816
Where?
Nichols'.

55
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,718
Okay. Got it.
I...

56
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,655
Stay where you are. Stay where you are.
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

57
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,824
Okay.
I mean it, Gracie.

58
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,293
I'll get the car.
Okay!

59
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,310
Dad.

60
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,161
What?

61
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,801
Sit.

62
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,882
You didn't even tell us
you were leaving town.

63
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,285
When... When...
When did you leave New York?

64
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,155
Can you even remember anything?

65
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:41,092
Dad, I just... forgot where
I parked the car, you know?

66
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,728
- You crashed the car, Gracie.
- I do not want to talk to you!

67
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,430
Enough!

68
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:51,803
We had two police officers
show up at the house...

69
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,339
in the middle of the night...

70
00:07:54,341 --> 00:08:00,679
to tell us that your car was
wrecked two miles from here...

71
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,348
and you were missing.

72
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,885
Can you even begin to imagine
what that feels like?

73
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,757
Why can't you just support me instead
of always kicking me when I'm down?

74
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,092
We have supported you.

75
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,261
Oh, not you.
I'm not talking to you.

76
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:19,064
I don't care if you don't
wanna talk to me.

77
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:22,167
Your father has spent thousands
of dollars on you, Gracie.

78
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,002
It's not your money!
Why do you care?

79
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,771
- You flunked out of college, you
wrecked cars... - She's still talking.

80
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,807
Why is she talking? Why is she here?
That's plural, Gracie.

81
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:32,244
It has nothing to do with me or
your father why you are a drunk.

82
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,982
Not me and not your father.
This is your mess.

83
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,417
And your mother's death
is just an excuse for you.

84
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,887
Do not talk about her. You
want to talk about betrayal?

85
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,923
- Do not talk about my mom.
- You are using her and her death...

86
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,858
to stop people
from holding you accountable.

87
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,127
You are an alcoholic, Gracie.

88
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:53,331
- You are just like your mother.
- Do not talk about her!

89
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,300
Tell her to shut up!

90
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:58,503
Come on. Come on.
I know. I know.

91
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,840
All right.

92
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:05,343
This is it, okay?
I just, um...

93
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:08,980
I just need, like,
a couple days,

94
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,049
like a couple hundred
dollars, that's it.

95
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,351
I cannot go through this
with you again.

96
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,987
- I can't do it. I can't...
- No. Listen to what I'm saying.

97
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,056
I just need, like...
I'm sorry, Gracie.

98
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,991
No, no, no, Daddy.
Please listen to me.

99
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,993
Please stop talking. Listen to me.
Listen to me.

100
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,763
I'll get help. I will.

101
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,932
I will. I'll get help.

102
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,800
I will!
I'll get help.

103
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:32,137
Just please... please
don't do this to me.

104
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,673
No. No. Daddy, please
don't do this...

105
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,775
No. Not right now.
Please, Daddy.

106
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,277
- Please, please, please.
- I can't!

107
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,884
I love you, Gracie,
but no more money,

108
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:49,354
no more cars,
no more car loans,

109
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:52,857
no more unfinished college
courses, no more bailouts.

110
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,560
No more. No more.

111
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:04,970
God, Mom would be
so... ashamed of you.

112
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,976
You ever think about her?

113
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,912
Can you look at her?

114
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,185
- No. No, no, no.
- What?

115
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:21,987
No. No.

116
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,635
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No!

117
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,106
Where is it?
Where is it?

118
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,633
They left about an hour ago.

119
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,102
I'll live.

120
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,573
- You mind if I sit down?
- I don't own the place.

121
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,685
I'm Sonia.

122
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,990
What's your name?

123
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:39,097
- Gracie.
- All right. Pleased to meet you, Gracie.

124
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,373
I haven't had a drink
in 11 years,

125
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,577
but I used to drink.

126
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,313
A lot.

127
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,519
I used to run from town
to town and guy to guy,

128
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:05,290
and I was always swearing that the next
one wasn't gonna be like the last.

129
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:09,461
And every new town, every
new start, every new guy...

130
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,399
They always went real bad
real fast.

131
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,237
Real fast.

132
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,907
No matter how many
promises I made...

133
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,809
even to myself...

134
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,314
it always ended up the same.

135
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,820
That sound familiar?

136
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:46,431
The question is, are you ready
to try something different?

137
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,096
Thanks.

138
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,557
Yeah, 1972. "Sweet
Caroline." It's a classic.

139
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,058
Hi.
Hey.

140
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,295
What are you having?
Um...

141
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,397
Whatever he's having.

142
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,234
You look like
you're enjoying yours.

143
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,538
Supposed to be
on vacation, right?

144
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:10,975
Um, you know,
can I, uh, open a tab?

145
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,577
I'm probably gonna have a few.

146
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,480
Sure, if you'd like to
put a card behind the bar.

147
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,449
Yeah, of course.

148
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,952
Where is...

149
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,157
Oh... man.

150
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,892
Sucks.

151
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:31,562
You know what? I think I, um,
forgot my wallet in the car.

152
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:35,433
So... just the one,
I guess.

153
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,236
Don't worry.
It's on me.

154
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,407
Thanks.

155
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,749
Well, hello!

156
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,952
Cheers.
Cheers.

157
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,787
I'm Gracie.

158
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,589
I'm Chris. Mmm.
Nice to meet you.

159
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,326
Mmm.

160
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,964
So you on vacation too?

161
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,867
Moved here when I retired
three years ago.

162
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,636
Retired?

163
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,604
What... What are you,
like, 40?

164
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,808
Come on.
You're good.

165
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,812
"Forty."

166
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,753
So what is there to do
in this town?

167
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,556
Depends on what
you're in the mood for.

168
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,259
Well, cheers to that.

169
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,462
Cheers to that.

170
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,605
I'll have another.

171
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,281
I... No! No, let go!

172
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,150
She wants you to feel her...
Come on.

173
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,651
Get your drunk girlfriend
out of here!

174
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,253
I'm just saying, that's a fake...
Hey!

175
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:05,089
Oi!

176
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:08,493
- Clean that up. - It's fake. It's
just nobody wants to acknowledge that!

177
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:11,963
- That's it. Get out. - She's not causing
a problem. She needs another beer.

178
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,098
I'm serious!
Get out, now!

179
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,733
You get out!

180
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,136
- Babe, come on. I'm gonna give
you a ride. - Don't touch me.

181
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,905
Aw, come on, babe.
Where's Chris?

182
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,307
- You get out!
- Bitch!

183
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,010
Asshole! Come on. Don't
worry about him.

184
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,713
What are the Popsicles called
with the red, white and the blue?

185
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,115
The rocket ones?

186
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:35,453
Leave him alone. You clean...
You clean that up!

187
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,889
Stay in there!
Come on!

188
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,892
People like telling me
what to do.

189
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:46,064
Hey! Yeah!
Clean that up!

190
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,767
So you said they're coming
home for the summer? Hey! Hey!

191
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,135
Yeah!

192
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,308
Come on, get on. Get on.

193
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,878
Oh, yeah!
Is that a dog?

194
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,514
Oh, my God. He's so cute.
Wait, no!

195
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,349
He jumped off.

196
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,186
- Elaine, can you hold that for me?
- Don't leave me!

197
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,121
I'll be right back.

198
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,059
He left me.

199
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:18,162
Oh.
Oh, look at that.

200
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:19,797
Feels like a comfy...

201
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,768
Oh, yeah.

202
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,146
So how we doin'?

203
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,719
Oh, no, don't...
Are you here for him?

204
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:45,823
No. 'Cause he's... he's
a really good dog.

205
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,593
He's a really good dog.
Where are you staying, miss?

206
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,263
Where are you staying at?
Hmm?

207
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,098
I'm staying with you.
You are?

208
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,503
You wanna come sit with me? 'Cause
it's really comf... It's really comfy.

209
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,171
Come sit with me.
I'm good.

210
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,772
Come sit with me and my dog.

211
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,041
- I'll stand here.
- Why?

212
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,977
Are you staying in town?

213
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,480
Yeah. We...

214
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,782
Didn't you...

215
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,485
With your friend?
Yes!

216
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,288
It's Chris's son...

217
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,724
Wait, I'll show you... Miss, miss,
could you stay down, please?

218
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,627
Hey! Get off! Get off of me!
Okay. Okay.

219
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,195
It's all right.

220
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,732
Just tryin' to
show you my friend.

221
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:31,169
Right. Miss, please, could you please...
Do not touch... me!

222
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,937
All right. Okay.
Okay! Okay!

223
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,806
No! That's how it's gonna be?

224
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,811
What are you doing?

225
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,283
Rape!

226
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:48,526
It's okay. She was kidding.
She didn't mean it.

227
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:56,427
This is Officer Parsons, requesting
10-16 at Flagler Tavern.

228
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,231
10-4.

229
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,940
You've reached James Turner.

230
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:11,409
Please leave your name
and number at the tone.

231
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,980
Dad?

232
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:19,383
I know you're mad at me, okay,
but I really need your help.

233
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,787
So can you please
pick up the phone?

234
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:26,023
Okay, Dad,
I'm in jail, and it's...

235
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,960
this stupid misunderstanding.

236
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,995
It's nothing. It's just
that they're telling me...

237
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,064
that I can't get to court
until Monday.

238
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,666
So I really need
your help, Daddy.

239
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,603
I really need you to get
me out of here because,

240
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:42,273
um, it's really scary
in here, Daddy.

241
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,377
I love you...

242
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,145
and, um,

243
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,150
I'm sorry.

244
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:58,923
And I'll be good. I will be
good if you just help me.

245
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:02,860
I just really need help. I just
really need you right now, Dad.

246
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:06,130
So can you please
just get me out of here?

247
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,133
Okay, I love you. Bye.

248
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,239
Shit.

249
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,480
Okay. Here's the deal.

250
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:25,549
The public prosecutor wanted to
send you to jail for six months.

251
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,118
What? Why?
But I...

252
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,854
Wait. I was just drunk!
What is this, Saudi Arabia?

253
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,956
No, no, no. Listen.
Stop, stop, stop. Listen.

254
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,526
I said he wanted you to go to jail
for six months. I got us a deal.

255
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,094
It's a plea bargain.

256
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,997
They're gonna drop the
assault charge on the cop...

257
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:43,334
if you plead guilty
to the public drunkenness.

258
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,539
Okay. Okay.
What do I have to do?

259
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:54,178
Well, you're gonna have to attend 90
meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous.

260
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,814
In 90 days.

261
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,184
Is that it?

262
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,820
Pretty much. Okay? Except...
Except... Yeah.

263
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,902
If you re offend, if you
fail to attend the

264
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:07,224
meetings, you're gonna
find yourself back here.

265
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:10,328
Yeah, yeah. And I know this prosecutor,
and he'll go to this judge,

266
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,630
and he'll want to try you
on that assault charge.

267
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:15,700
That would not be good. Okay? I'm good.
I'm good. I can do that.

268
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:18,469
So that's great.
Let's just... Let's do that.

269
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:22,139
You're gonna have to carry out the
sentence here, but there will be...

270
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:24,508
- Wait. Did you just say "here"?
- There are going to be...

271
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,078
- What do you mean, "here"?
- There are going to be drug testings.

272
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,080
Stop doing that for a second.
Did you just say "here"?

273
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:32,249
Like, this town?
New Smyrna Beach?

274
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,819
No, no, no. Anywhere
in Volusia County.

275
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,224
No. No, no, no, no, no. Mm-mmm.

276
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,993
I... I cannot stay here.

277
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,929
So...

278
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,797
I don't live here.
I live in New York.

279
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,334
Why can't I just do it
in New York? That's...

280
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:53,771
I don't... have any money.
I don't have any place to stay.

281
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:57,274
I don't have a job.
What kind of idiot are you?

282
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,643
That's not how it works.

283
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:02,012
That's not how it works.

284
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,215
All right? The prosecutor
pulled your file.

285
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:08,052
You've got a DUI, you've got three
misdemeanors. They all involve alcohol.

286
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,255
Now we're talking about
an assault on a police officer.

287
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:14,291
They're not gonna let you leave
unless they're comfortable.

288
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,596
All right. You know what?

289
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:22,400
That is fine. I will go back to
them, and I will tell them no.

290
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,736
Of course, the constitution will
guarantee that you get a fair trial...

291
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,239
by a jury of your peers.

292
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,708
Of course, I don't think you're
doing so great for bail money,

293
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,912
so they're probably going to remand
you until they set a trial date.

294
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,382
Okay.
I'll do it, okay?

295
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,087
This is bullshit.

296
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:47,324
No, Miss Turner.
It's consequences.

297
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,395
And that was the end
of that relationship.

298
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:36,433
Last I heard, he married the bitch
somewhere up in New Jersey.

299
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,203
But I pray for her every day.

300
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:44,041
I say, "God, please let her
get shot in a drive-by."

301
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:48,412
Just kidding.

302
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,915
Not really.

303
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:55,319
"Where there is hatred,
let me sow love,

304
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:59,390
where there is injury,
pardon."

305
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,625
That's a great prayer
if you don't know it.

306
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:05,429
Saint Francis
of, uh, somewhere.

307
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:09,099
Anyway, that's all
the wisdom I've got.

308
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:13,237
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Jessie.

309
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,199
Before we move on, I notice
that we have a new face.

310
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,879
Hi. Is this
your first meeting?

311
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,318
Yeah. Can somebody
sign my form?

312
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,086
Um, sure. Sure.

313
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,822
Just see me
at the end of the meeting.

314
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:35,059
- What was your name?
- Gracie.

315
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,794
Gracie.
Well, welcome, Gracie.

316
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:38,929
Hi, Gracie.

317
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,265
Okay. Who's next?

318
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,734
Well, I'll keep
the ball rollin'.

319
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:46,070
Uh, my name's Pat.
I'm an alcoholic.

320
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:49,440
Hi, Pat.
Hi, everybody.

321
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:52,109
Just to fill you in on
what's going on with me...

322
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,378
I had a really bad day
yesterday.

323
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,214
Um, you know, I've been out
of work for a long time.

324
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,083
I had two job interviews
yesterday.

325
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,818
And I was really excited
about it.

326
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,954
I really thought that I was gonna get
one of these jobs, and I didn't get it.

327
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:07,658
I really wanted to go drink for
the first time in a long time.

328
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,560
But I didn't do that.

329
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:12,896
That's one of the things I've learned in
here... that's just like what life is.

330
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:15,232
It's just one thing
after the other and...

331
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,835
Like I said, I'm really glad
to be here today.

332
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:19,837
Glad to see
all you guys here too.

333
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,473
Thanks, everybody.

334
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,209
Thanks, Pat.

335
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:29,113
Okay. Are there
any other announcements?

336
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:32,282
I do. I'm Rosemarie,
and I'm an alcoholic.

337
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,451
Hi, Rosemarie.

338
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:37,287
The annual Sober Dance
is this Saturday night.

339
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,490
Whoo!
Yeah!

340
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,693
And for anyone who hasn't been
to one of our Sober Dances,

341
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,995
they're always a lot of fun,

342
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,698
and chances are you won't
wake up somewhere...

343
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,967
or with someone you don't know.

344
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:53,170
That's all.

345
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,273
Okay, I asked Bill here
to hand out our chips.

346
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,675
Bill?

347
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,047
Well, my name is Bill,
and I'm an alcoholic.

348
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,115
Hi, Bill.

349
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:09,953
We give out chips here at our group
to recognize periods of sobriety.

350
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:13,924
The first one
is most important.

351
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:16,226
It's white.

352
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:19,997
If you're new,
this one's for you.

353
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,433
Any takers?

354
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:25,069
All right.
Now we've got three months.

355
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:27,237
Anybody here
celebrating three months?

356
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:30,441
All right, Reef!

357
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,610
Reef!
Reef!

358
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:36,013
My man!
Hey.

359
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,748
Mwah! Oh, yeah.

360
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,253
Phew.

361
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,889
Now we got six months.

362
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,559
Any takers for six months?

363
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,196
Now we're down to nine months.

364
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:55,065
Anyone here celebrating nine months?
You know what?

365
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,001
Um, actually,
I'll take a white chip.

366
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,871
Well done, Gracie!

367
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,906
Hey!

368
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,708
All right. Yay!

369
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,844
Here. Come on!

370
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,746
Good job!

371
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,783
Good, good, good.

372
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:14,318
- Gee.
- Good job!

373
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,153
Anybody... Anybody want
this nine-month chip?

374
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,655
Yes!
Yeah?

375
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,727
Oh, my God!
Thank you!

376
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,763
Ah.

377
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,164
There you go.
Oh.

378
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,767
Yeah, Jessie!

379
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:32,936
All right, finally,
anybody got a year,

380
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,806
or multiples of a year?

381
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:39,476
All right. Well, let's hear
it for the chips we hold!

382
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:42,613
Good job, guys.
Good job.

383
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,115
Hey.

384
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,088
There you go.
Thanks.

385
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,390
Why don't you, um, hang out?

386
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,058
Hi. Sorry.
I'm Pickles.

387
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,361
Gracie.
Hi. Sorry.

388
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,872
Hey.

389
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,641
Hey.

390
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:13,677
Look, I know you're not here 'cause you
wanna be, but I'm glad to see you.

391
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,312
Yeah.

392
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,418
Are you hungry?

393
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,328
What?

394
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,602
What do you want from me?
So I'm a loser. Next?

395
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,377
Do you need a job?

396
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,782
Yeah.

397
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,420
Do you have a place to stay?

398
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,959
All right.
Here's the deal.

399
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:06,697
I can offer you a couple of
shifts a week at the coffee shop,

400
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,633
and you can stay at my place
for a while if you want.

401
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:13,704
But you gotta stay sober, and
you gotta give me no trouble.

402
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,305
And...

403
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,442
that's it.

404
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,946
Why would you do that for me?

405
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:26,216
Because I probably know more
about you than you think.

406
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,686
Oh, man, when you
attacked that cop...

407
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:34,258
I was right across the street.

408
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,962
And that took me back to 1993,

409
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:42,799
when I was being cuffed
by a Wayne County sheriff,

410
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:47,137
who was trying to shove me
into the back of a cruiser.

411
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:51,208
Domestic abuse. I'd had a fight with my
boyfriend, and I stabbed him with a pencil.

412
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,277
Mmm.
Yeah, apparently.

413
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,812
Um... Yeah.

414
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:58,415
Anyway, that cop, he was
trying to shove me in there,

415
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,451
and I managed
to turn around somehow...

416
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:05,622
and kick him like a mule,
square in the nuts.

417
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,560
Wow, look. You do smile.

418
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,902
So what happened?

419
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:22,539
Well, I told everybody it's
'cause he grabbed my breasts.

420
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:25,943
But you wanna know the
real reason that I did it?

421
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,214
No idea.

422
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:34,017
I was drunk off my ass.

423
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,986
Couldn't remember a thing.

424
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,558
Grace.

425
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,996
Your family will
come around eventually.

426
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,702
You're just gonna have
to change a few things.

427
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:53,503
Like what?

428
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,874
Everything.

429
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,016
All right.

430
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,985
Here is your room.

431
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,222
And the shower is over there.

432
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,358
There are towels.

433
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,567
Come on in.
Don't be shy.

434
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:22,833
Hey, do you have anything else
besides what you're wearing?

435
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,435
Um, I might have
some stuff in my car,

436
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:28,805
but I don't know
where that is, so...

437
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,477
Right. Okay.

438
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:36,446
Uh, let's see what I can find.

439
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,582
Um...

440
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,919
Thank you.

441
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,956
You're welcome.

442
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,510
Gracie!

443
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,314
Hey! Uh...

444
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,916
Pickles?

445
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,522
I-I saw you last night
at the, uh... the meeting?

446
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:01,191
Oh. Right.
Yeah.

447
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,959
Hi.
Hi.

448
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,862
Hi. I'm Karleigh.

449
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:09,232
Hi. Hey, uh, can I
get you, like, a...

450
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,434
a "sodee"?

451
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,103
Um, no, no.
Sure?

452
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:15,805
Hey, do you... Why don't you...
Here. Come on.

453
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:18,141
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Jump up.

454
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,710
I'm good. Thanks.

455
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:26,149
Oh-ho-ho, man.
Oh, God, he ate it, man.

456
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,555
Didn't I see him picking up a
three-month chip last night?

457
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,156
Yes.
Is that him?

458
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,758
That's huge.

459
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:41,932
So, um, how long
have you... been sober?

460
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:45,835
About, like, uh...
like 45 minutes.

461
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,472
I-I don't really
have a problem.

462
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:53,310
I just... I go to meetings
'cause they have, uh, doughnuts.

463
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:54,978
Mmm.

464
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,581
- And I get to, like, look at all
the cute drunk girls. - Hey!

465
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:00,483
And, uh... No, no.
I'm just... I'm just kidding.

466
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:04,287
Uh... Like four years.

467
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,223
Yeah, clean and sober.

468
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:12,195
Do you want to, um,
like, hang out today?

469
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:15,665
I think we're gonna go see a
movie later, right? Yeah, sure.

470
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,669
I think he's coming too.

471
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,610
What's up, yo?
What up, man?

472
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,678
Totally got merked
on that last wave.

473
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,915
Yeah, you got, like,
totally shut down.

474
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,617
Yeah. Whoo.

475
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,820
What's up?

476
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,924
You surf?

477
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,629
You wanna try?

478
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,238
She's gonna come with us
to the movies later.

479
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,873
Sweet.

480
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,943
I won't have to worry about
her talking the whole time.

481
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,290
Please.

482
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:15,191
The ocean calls.

483
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,661
Later, Gracie.

484
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:27,070
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you know what time it is?

485
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,775
- Oh, my God.
- I get off at 6:30.

486
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:33,743
Come pick me up?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

487
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,679
Oh, Dolphin Inn?
Okay.

488
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:37,847
Do you know where it is?
No. But I'll find it.

489
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,383
It's a small town.
Can't be that hard.

490
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,897
Hi.

491
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:56,066
Hi.

492
00:38:57,682 --> 00:38:59,202
What? I made it.
Right?

493
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:01,371
It's always good
to be a little early.

494
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,549
So you're gonna have to teach me
how to use one of these.

495
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:16,052
All in good time. First you
gotta learn the mail room.

496
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:26,496
Now, you like a half caff
double latte, right?

497
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:28,031
Yes.
Okay, great.

498
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,481
Hey.

499
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:48,251
You and I are gonna cut out early.
Got a surprise for ya.

500
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,888
Don't worry.
You're gonna like it.

501
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,164
How long have you worked here?

502
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,133
Um, two months.

503
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,038
So... what's her story?

504
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,811
Oh, what's to tell?

505
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:17,947
Um, she was in a band
in Detroit.

506
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,949
Wannabe rock star and all that.

507
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:22,752
Uh, she drank a lot,

508
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,455
took pills, got pregnant.

509
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:29,225
Her life fell apart,
and her daughter OD'd at 19.

510
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:32,996
And I think that's probably
one of her T-shirts.

511
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,142
What's up?

512
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,811
Nothing.

513
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,080
Okay.

514
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,964
How did you like your massage?

515
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,700
- It's nice. It's...
- They're so great here.

516
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,936
- The best ever, right?
- Amen.

517
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:15,572
Oh, I wouldn't know.
That was my first one.

518
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,974
Where are you from, Gracie?

519
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,176
New York.
Wow!

520
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,911
Have you ever been
to a Broadway show?

521
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,013
I'm not actually from the city.

522
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,416
My dad works there,
but I don't go there very much.

523
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:28,751
- I'd love to see a Broadway show.
- What does he do?

524
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,120
I don't know.
He wears a suit.

525
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,524
Aw, that's okay, honey. More
importantly, what do you do?

526
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,233
Besides getting drunk
and crashing cars?

527
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,805
Oh! Sorry I'm late!

528
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:50,974
Oh! I completely forgot.

529
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,710
Menopause.

530
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,180
- Would you like something to drink?
- Oh, yes.

531
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,983
Vodka and orange.

532
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:05,088
Mmm, better not. I always
end up in the wrong bed.

533
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,324
So, how's the newcomer?

534
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,496
Have they told you
not to date boys...

535
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:16,299
- Jess!
- Or make any other big decisions yet?

536
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:19,936
- Just ignore her, Gracie.
- Okay, okay.

537
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:23,273
I think this girl needs
to have some real fun.

538
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,145
What do ya say, Gracie?

539
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:57,840
I met the love of my life
when I was 21 years old.

540
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:01,044
Met him in a bar, of course.

541
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:04,747
Oh, he was a great surfer.

542
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,818
I didn't really even
like him much...

543
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,421
in the beginning.

544
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:13,756
But as time went by,

545
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:16,960
he slowly took over my life.

546
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,596
First time he hit me,

547
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:23,099
we were at a drive-through
on our way to a party.

548
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,168
I ordered the wrong drink,

549
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,670
and he banged my head
off the car window.

550
00:43:27,672 --> 00:43:29,272
Oh, my God.

551
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:32,308
I threatened to leave him
if he ever touched me again,

552
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:36,179
as I did every time
it happened after that.

553
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,815
But I went back.

554
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:42,285
I went back again
and again and again.

555
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:45,355
- Why?
- Because I'm an addict.

556
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,459
I always go back.

557
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:54,831
When I finally got sober,
he just found another victim.

558
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,532
That sucks.

559
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:58,835
I'm sorry. That's
a really shitty story.

560
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:02,038
That's okay.
I got married to Tom.

561
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,273
He's a nice guy.

562
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,878
It hurts being like us, Gracie.

563
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,148
I never felt comfortable
in my own skin.

564
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,618
So I drank to be sexy.

565
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:19,355
I did cocaine to be thin.

566
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:22,225
I tortured myself
with plastic surgery...

567
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:26,429
to... to look young
and be beautiful.

568
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,233
And for what?

569
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:33,002
I manufactured a woman...

570
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,071
that I don't even like.

571
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,110
You know, I... I don't know the
first thing about being sober.

572
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,715
But I hope
you find your way out.

573
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,323
Gotta go.

574
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:58,594
- Do you want a ride?
- No, it's okay. I'll walk.

575
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,168
Good-bye, Gracie.

576
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,704
Bye.

577
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,334
Hey!

578
00:46:11,336 --> 00:46:13,336
- I thought you weren't gonna show.
- Yeah.

579
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:15,805
- Hi, Gracie!
- Hi.

580
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,374
What's up, girl?

581
00:46:19,263 --> 00:46:21,544
Yo. What time's
the movie?

582
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:23,279
7:30.
7:30?

583
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,782
You can just hang out here.

584
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:28,017
7:30?
I... I... I can't go.

585
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:29,552
Why not?

586
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:32,255
Um, I have to go to a meeting.

587
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:34,791
You... have to go?

588
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:37,393
Yeah, yeah. She got a court order.
She hit a cop.

589
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:39,028
- Yeah.
- I did not hit a cop.

590
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,531
- Aw!
- It was an accident.

591
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:44,200
Oh, yes.
An accident, for sure.

592
00:46:44,202 --> 00:46:46,536
Oh, my God. Is there anything
secret in this town?

593
00:46:46,538 --> 00:46:49,405
Uh... no.
No.

594
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:51,374
- Definitely not.
- All right.

595
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:55,044
- Well...
- Hey, I'll come with you.

596
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:56,946
Can always use
another meeting, you know.

597
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:59,448
Well, I thought we were... Can't
we go to, like, the 9:00?

598
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,685
Dude. Catch up with you later.
Yeah?

599
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:05,354
Totally.
Yeah?

600
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:07,256
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Cool.

601
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:09,125
- Bye.
- Bye.

602
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:10,660
I gotta go.
See ya.

603
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:18,134
Okay, everybody.
Let's start our meeting, huh?

604
00:47:18,776 --> 00:47:21,537
- Guys wanna start a meeting?
- Yeah.

605
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,539
Yeah? Yeah? Good.

606
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,141
All right.
Hello, everyone.

607
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:29,278
Welcome to "We Are Not a Glum Lot"
meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous.

608
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,248
My name is David,
and I am an alcoholic.

609
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,851
Hi, David.

610
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:37,486
Uh, can somebody read the blue card?
Who'd I give that to?

611
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:39,622
- Oh. That was me.
- Ah. Marijane. Excellent.

612
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:41,891
Hi, I'm Marijane,
and I'm an alcoholic.

613
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:43,559
Hi, Marijane.

614
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:45,962
"This is an open meeting
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

615
00:47:45,964 --> 00:47:49,165
We are glad you are all here,
especially newcomers.

616
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:53,035
In keeping with our singleness of
purpose and our third tradition,

617
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,938
which states that the only
requirement for AA membership...

618
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,074
is a desire to stop drinking,

619
00:47:58,076 --> 00:47:59,575
we ask that all
who participate..."

620
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:01,510
It reminded me
of when we were married.

621
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:03,976
He always reacted to
everything by screaming

622
00:48:04,002 --> 00:48:05,948
and yelling, and
it was just awful.

623
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,217
And I reacted by drinking.

624
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,820
- You holding out on me?
- A bottle of wine, rum, whatever it was.

625
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:14,123
Thank you, guys, for all
your help and your support.

626
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:18,361
You've been a wonder for me. Thank
you so much for everything.

627
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:21,497
Okay, uh, who's next?

628
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:30,339
I'm Rosemarie,
and I'm an alcoholic.

629
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:32,408
Hi, Rosemarie.

630
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,645
Um, I didn't have
a drink today,

631
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:40,316
so I'm
a rip-roaring success.

632
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:47,823
But, uh, I can't stay sober
unless I get sober.

633
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:51,661
Ninety-nine percent of my problems
go away when I don't drink.

634
00:48:51,663 --> 00:48:55,531
But abstinence is not sobriety.

635
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:03,372
No one ever forced
a drink down my throat.

636
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,376
I drank because, um,

637
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,758
I liked the effect
produced by alcohol.

638
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,984
Alcohol suppressed my growth.

639
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:16,585
It, um,

640
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:21,023
prevented me from having
adult relationships...

641
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:25,394
because it was easier
to get drunk than to grow.

642
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:27,563
I escaped my problems,
but at the same time...

643
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:30,866
I ignored my responsibilities.

644
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:35,571
I had to learn to grow up.

645
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,916
That's all.

646
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,019
Okay, who's next?

647
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,656
- Um...
- Gracie.

648
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:55,925
Yeah. Told you that
last night.

649
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:57,460
Sorry.
Remember?

650
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,330
Yeah, I'm Gracie, and I'm, um,

651
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,869
here, I guess...

652
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,573
Um...

653
00:50:10,575 --> 00:50:12,975
I mean, I was
court-ordered to be here,

654
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:16,979
so I guess I wouldn't choose
to be here if I had a choice.

655
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:18,914
But I don't. Um...

656
00:50:21,266 --> 00:50:23,586
No, you know why
I'm actually here?

657
00:50:23,588 --> 00:50:26,856
I'm actually here because my
dad turned his back on me.

658
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:29,792
He also abandoned my mom 15 years
ago and let her die alone,

659
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:32,278
so I guess I shouldn't
really be holding out

660
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:34,597
for any kind of big
daddy reconciliation.

661
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:36,880
I mean, people
are selfish, right?

662
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,603
You really wanna tell me
to "grow up"?

663
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:43,773
What, you don't like the way I am?
I don't care!

664
00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:46,642
This is a free country.
Right?

665
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:49,779
Why won't anybody just leave me
alone to do what I want to do?

666
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:52,003
I mean, this is my life!
If I want to get

667
00:50:52,029 --> 00:50:54,408
wasted, why is that
anybody else's business?

668
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:01,490
Oh, no.
My name is Jessie.

669
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,496
And... I need
to tell you the truth.

670
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,737
And you're not gonna
stop me, Marijane.

671
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:18,707
- Jessie, why don't you come in and sit
down with us? - I don't wanna sit down!

672
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:22,311
And I don't wanna
talk to you, Rosemarie!

673
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:25,081
And I don't wanna talk
to you, Saint Sonia!

674
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:29,585
I don't want you...

675
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:32,455
to tell me to accept it.

676
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,491
I don't want to be sober.

677
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:38,661
It hurts too much.
The pain is too great.

678
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:41,297
- We love you, Jessie.
- I don't want you to love me.

679
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:44,166
But we do.
We love you, baby.

680
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:46,569
You're all a bunch of phonies.

681
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:50,139
You are. You're all a bunch of...
a bunch of liars.

682
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:52,108
None of you are sober.

683
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,578
I hate this place.
I hate these rooms!

684
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,948
Jessie? Jessie, come on.

685
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:09,492
No, Jessie! Jessie, no!
I've gotta pee!

686
00:52:09,494 --> 00:52:11,527
I've got to pee!
I know.

687
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:14,830
We're not gonna do that here. We're
gonna go home. I'm gonna get you home.

688
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:17,967
Marijane, you're no fun.
I know, I know.

689
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:21,370
I'm a big ol' fuddy-duddy,
but that's the way it is.

690
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:22,805
Here we go.
Get her in.

691
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,474
Let's go party!

692
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,543
Let's go party!

693
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:29,478
We're gonna go party
at your house, baby.

694
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,947
Got a seat?
Hi.

695
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:34,850
Oh, Marijane! Oh, my God.
What happened?

696
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:38,154
Rosemarie's gonna drive you.
She got wasted.

697
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,158
But that's nobody else's
business, is it?

698
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:52,368
Party! Party!
Let's go party!

699
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,651
You wanna get out of here?

700
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,742
Come on.

701
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,481
God.

702
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,883
Crazy.

703
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,964
So you're all
just lying, right?

704
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:24,733
What?

705
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:28,070
Does anybody
actually like being sober?

706
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,274
I mean, I'm on day two,
and it sucks already.

707
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,146
- I mean, it gets better.
- Jessie didn't think so.

708
00:53:37,148 --> 00:53:41,517
Well, some people
just... never get it.

709
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:43,752
I don't get it.

710
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,888
I don't.

711
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,090
I mean,
why did you stop partying?

712
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:50,092
- Well, I mean, I...
- Don't bullshit me.

713
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:52,728
I want the truth.
Why'd you stop partying?

714
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,800
Well...

715
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:03,505
I lost a music scholarship
after my second DUI.

716
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:07,676
First they just kinda
counted it as a bad day.

717
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:12,581
Second one meant
that I had a bad habit.

718
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:18,821
So now, instead of cuttin'
waves between class in Malibu,

719
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,791
I'm cuttin' grass
between waves...

720
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:24,260
here.

721
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:46,849
You know, I hung out with her today
and she was actually really cool.

722
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:49,618
She's a chronic relapser.

723
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,186
She'll be back.

724
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:54,690
If she ever
gets over the shame.

725
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:56,292
Oh.
Yeah.

726
00:54:56,294 --> 00:54:58,127
I can't even...

727
00:54:58,129 --> 00:54:59,728
That was a little...

728
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,035
What brought you
to New Smyrna Beach?

729
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,043
Mommy?

730
00:55:14,045 --> 00:55:15,744
Oh, I see.

731
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:17,313
She's got secrets.

732
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:21,550
Get off of me!
I hate you so much!

733
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:23,452
- I hate you!
- Do not do this!

734
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:26,655
- Mommy
- Leave me alone!

735
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:31,060
I came here once
when I was a kid.

736
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,331
Before my mom died.

737
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,203
How'd she die?

738
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,972
How do you think?

739
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:53,148
You know what?

740
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:54,616
Wait right here.

741
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:57,086
Where are you going?

742
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,788
Don't move!

743
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:02,858
I got a surprise for you
back in the truck!

744
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,544
Seriously?

745
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,386
Does it look like I'm joking?
No.

746
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:28,584
Surf'll be good tomorrow.

747
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:31,253
Always is after a full moon.

748
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,323
Did you know...

749
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:39,995
that all the tides of the
earth come from the moon?

750
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:55,844
Right now, all of this...

751
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:57,479
the entire ocean...

752
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,817
is being lifted by the moon.

753
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,633
That's pretty amazing, huh?

754
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:17,766
So do you actually play?

755
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,903
Do I play?

756
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:40,789
Have a feeling it might be...
be in a different tune...

757
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:45,294
You don't have to
do this right now.

758
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:48,263
I do have another 88 days here,
so if you need to practice...

759
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:52,100
Don't throw me under the bus just yet.
Come on.

760
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:01,463
Hi.

761
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:05,901
I did your laundry.

762
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,473
Thanks.

763
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,320
Are you okay?

764
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:40,654
Are you upset about Jessie?

765
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:51,146
Do you have any idea what the chances
are for you actually getting sober?

766
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:53,749
Especially with
your mother's history?

767
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:57,285
That wasn't hard to pick up on
at the coffee house.

768
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,421
It was pretty clear
that whole thing was messed up.

769
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:02,024
- Yeah. - But right now you
need to be paying attention...

770
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:04,826
to the people in the rooms instead of
distracting yourself with some guy.

771
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:08,397
- Come on. We were just... - I don't know
if your mother ever tried to get help.

772
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:11,199
But there are worse things
than dying from this disease,

773
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:13,301
and you need to be respectful
of the people...

774
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:16,938
that are actually living with
the damage that it caused.

775
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,008
Chill out, okay?
I don't feel like a lecture.

776
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:23,512
Do you feel?

777
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:29,284
What would you feel like if I told you
there was a woman in there tonight...

778
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,321
who killed her husband
and her child...

779
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:35,991
when she crashed her car
when she was drunk,

780
01:01:35,993 --> 01:01:39,027
and she's spent the last 20
years trying to live with that?

781
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:41,730
- I don't even know what you're
talking about. - Yes, you do.

782
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:45,233
- No, I don't! - You do, because
you and Reef laughed in her face.

783
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:53,375
Rosemarie?

784
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:55,844
I shouldn't have told you.
That's not my story to tell.

785
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:58,346
But I cannot keep my mouth shut if
you're not gonna take this seriously.

786
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:00,515
And Reef,
he should know better.

787
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:06,221
Alcoholism is a disease,
and it is fueled by obsession.

788
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,356
- I'm not obsessive.
- Oh.

789
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,195
Did you see Jessie in there?

790
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,431
Yeah. I saw.
Wh...

791
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,671
I'm not like her.

792
01:02:22,673 --> 01:02:25,774
You are if you get into a relationship
before you really get sober.

793
01:02:25,776 --> 01:02:28,977
If he treats you good, you feel good.
If he treats you bad, you feel bad.

794
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:30,846
He becomes the center
of your world.

795
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:33,515
It's the same old story. I've
seen it time and time again.

796
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:36,218
Wow. I didn't know you were gonna
tell me who I could hang out with...

797
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:38,820
when you said
I could stay here.

798
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:40,388
It's good to know.

799
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,229
I'm going to bed.

800
01:02:47,231 --> 01:02:49,432
If that's okay with you.

801
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:35,043
- Whoa!
- Oh, sh...

802
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:36,578
I'm sorry.

803
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,214
What are you doing?

804
01:03:39,216 --> 01:03:41,883
Get your ass down here,
Gracie. Surf's up.

805
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,556
What time is it?

806
01:03:47,558 --> 01:03:49,257
Surfin' time!

807
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,320
Okay, I need five minutes.

808
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,231
- You got two minutes.
- Five!

809
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:58,333
Okay, you got three minutes.

810
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:09,771
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

811
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:25,253
Can you see that?
Oh, my God.

812
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,522
Whoa.

813
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:29,824
It's really bad.

814
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:32,360
- Oh, my God.
- Nice.

815
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:35,263
My legs are all wobbly.

816
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:40,435
Well, for being the most
graceful wipeout queen,

817
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,972
got this guy for you.

818
01:05:46,423 --> 01:05:48,143
Oh, my God.
You like it?

819
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:50,078
Yeah!

820
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,913
It's so beautiful.

821
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:55,583
You wanna come
to a party tonight?

822
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,954
Maybe.

823
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,324
Where is it?

824
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:05,060
Just sent you the address.

825
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:06,561
It's at my place.

826
01:06:06,563 --> 01:06:08,930
My parents are out of town.

827
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:11,466
It's just a few people.

828
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:15,670
- Who's coming?
- Just you and me.

829
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:20,909
Oh, it's that kind of party.

830
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:24,212
Well, it's on the beach.

831
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:26,848
Outdoor shower.
Skinny-dippin'.

832
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,483
Mm-hmm.

833
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,354
Come on. It'll be fun.

834
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:35,023
Maybe I'll come after.

835
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:37,659
"After"?
After what?

836
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:39,661
The Sober Dance.
Sober Dance.

837
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,696
I promised Sonia I would go.

838
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:44,366
Of course you're going
to the Sober Dance.

839
01:06:44,368 --> 01:06:47,469
Are you not going?
Sober Dance?

840
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:49,604
Not good for Reef.

841
01:06:49,606 --> 01:06:53,408
Oh, my God. You're gonna
make me go alone?

842
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,543
Mm-hmm.
God!

843
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:58,313
I thought you liked me. You
wanna hang out right now?

844
01:06:58,315 --> 01:07:01,516
We'll go to St. Augustine.
Right now.

845
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:06,588
I can't.
Yes, you...

846
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:09,057
I'm working.
"Working"?

847
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:11,426
You work at a coffee shop.

848
01:07:11,428 --> 01:07:13,928
It's not like
you're saving babies.

849
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:17,832
Come on.

850
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,268
I have to go.

851
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,103
No, you don't.
I do.

852
01:07:22,105 --> 01:07:23,938
Come on.
I do.

853
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,343
But I will see you later,
right?

854
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:30,345
At the Sober Dance?

855
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,989
Maybe.

856
01:07:40,991 --> 01:07:44,159
I'll see you later.
Yeah?

857
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:46,194
Run along.

858
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:48,430
Don't be late.

859
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:00,075
Hi.

860
01:08:01,284 --> 01:08:03,044
You're early.
Mm-hmm.

861
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:07,115
So, where do you want me to start?
Kitchen? Bathrooms? Sewers?

862
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:36,678
Oh! Uh...

863
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:48,890
Mmm.

864
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,192
Really good.

865
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,462
This is the best.

866
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,046
All right.

867
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:14,849
Okay.

868
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,520
You look really cute.
Mmm.

869
01:09:18,522 --> 01:09:20,488
I've always loved that dress.
Yeah?

870
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,624
Is it yours?

871
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,860
No.

872
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:39,841
It's not the prom.
Okay.

873
01:09:54,658 --> 01:09:57,425
Hi... Oh.
Hey. "Oh"?

874
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:03,464
Oh. Sorry. I-I just
thought you were, uh...

875
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:05,707
Yeah.
No, I know.

876
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,437
Where is he? Is he... Is he here?
Uh, I don't know.

877
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:11,973
But, um, I know he's coming.
Uh-huh.

878
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,178
Can I buy you a drink?

879
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,481
Like a...
drink drink?

880
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:23,017
Like a drink...

881
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:24,686
drink.

882
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:27,755
Yeah. Come on.

883
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,237
Did he stand you up?

884
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,774
No.

885
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,412
Does that change
when you get sober?

886
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:26,180
Uh, no, it does not.

887
01:11:26,182 --> 01:11:29,617
But at least
you make better choices.

888
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:34,455
Okay, sorry. I'll stop. But I would like to
help you avoid the same mistakes I made.

889
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,491
I'm trying. Okay?

890
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:39,560
Okay. Fine.
I will... back off.

891
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:49,671
I'm... I'm so sorry. You're gonna
have so much fun without me.

892
01:11:49,673 --> 01:11:51,234
I promise.
What?

893
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:55,128
When are you gonna be home?

894
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,647
- You okay?
- Yeah! I'm fine, yeah.

895
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,683
She just got, like,
called into work.

896
01:12:01,685 --> 01:12:05,019
I don't know, somebody
didn't, um, show up, so...

897
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:07,322
Oh.

898
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:10,992
You don't think it was my dancing or
anything that, like, drove her off?

899
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,694
No!
No?

900
01:12:12,696 --> 01:12:15,363
- No, your dancing is...
- No, it's not!

901
01:12:15,365 --> 01:12:17,799
Oh, no! Uh...

902
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:20,768
I don't know. It might've
been my whole ensemble.

903
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:24,806
No! No, I think you look
like P... like Pocahontas.

904
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,646
That's, like,
the worst compliment ever.

905
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:34,048
I'm so sorry.
It is. Uh...

906
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,583
Hmm.

907
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:38,052
Oh. Hold on.

908
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:39,654
What's up?

909
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:44,359
Seriously?

910
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:45,693
What's up?

911
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,129
Nothing. It's...

912
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:55,103
Hey, you wanna dance?

913
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,272
- Like now? Yeah!
- Yeah?

914
01:12:58,274 --> 01:12:59,941
Yeah.

915
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:24,665
Completely sober,
I'm much better.

916
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:26,334
You're good!

917
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,958
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm...

918
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,828
You know what? I'm gonna take off.
Oh, yeah, sure.

919
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:57,231
Do you want, um... Do you want a ride?
No, it's not far. I'll walk.

920
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:59,400
Oh, yeah. Sleep well. Thanks!

921
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:01,135
Good night, Pocahontas.

922
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:09,510
Grace.
Yeah?

923
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:10,878
Are you leaving?

924
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,781
Yeah, I just... I got tired,
so I'm just gonna go home.

925
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:15,550
Really.

926
01:14:15,552 --> 01:14:19,587
He didn't show, so you're gonna humiliate
yourself by trying to find him?

927
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:22,056
Please. Okay?
I can't do this now.

928
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:27,195
Honey, do not make this
about abandonment.

929
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:31,666
You've only known him
for, what, two days?

930
01:14:31,668 --> 01:14:33,568
Oh, my God!
I'm going to bed!

931
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:37,104
Do you know what it feels like
to be lied to?

932
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:39,211
I don't know. Do you
know what it feels like

933
01:14:39,237 --> 01:14:41,434
to be dressed in your
dead daughter's clothes?

934
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:49,023
I'm sorry.
That...

935
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:52,186
I didn't m...

936
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:57,758
I wouldn't say mean things if
people would just get off my case.

937
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,395
Right. Do you know what you're
really addicted to, Grace?

938
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,834
Your story.

939
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:12,206
But you're right.
It is none of my business.

940
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,043
I'm sorry.

941
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,510
Hey! I gotta go.

942
01:16:56,512 --> 01:16:58,813
Where you goin'? I
have to go to work!

943
01:16:58,815 --> 01:17:00,548
Work?
Come on.

944
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:03,851
- Come here. Come on. - I can't. I
don't have time to do it again.

945
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:07,254
You don't have to go to work.
Yes, I have to go to work.

946
01:17:07,256 --> 01:17:09,790
You work in a restaurant.
Come on.

947
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,759
It's not like
you're saving babies.

948
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:35,016
I'm gonna kill you! I will kill you!
Pickles, stop it!

949
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:37,118
- I will kill you!
- Pickles, stop! Stop!

950
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,420
- What are you trying to do?
- What the hell, bro?

951
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:41,989
Don't! Don't. Don't.
Don't! Don't! Stop!

952
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:46,060
- What the hell, man? - How could
you do this to me? Oh, my God, man.

953
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:57,104
Gracie!

954
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:59,907
Gracie, wait!
Gracie! Wait!

955
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:01,909
Wait!

956
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:03,711
Hey!

957
01:18:04,927 --> 01:18:06,847
I used to run around,
guy to guy.

958
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:10,751
Every new start. Every new town.
It always ended up the same.

959
01:18:10,753 --> 01:18:12,787
- That sound familiar?
- Gracie!

960
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:14,221
Gracie!
Where you going...

961
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:16,190
Asshole!
I'm sorry!

962
01:18:16,265 --> 01:18:18,225
Sorry.
I hate you!

963
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:19,960
I'm sorry!
I hate you!

964
01:18:19,962 --> 01:18:22,322
Gracie, calm down!
Calm down! No!

965
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,468
Gracie!

966
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:29,303
Gracie.

967
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,614
Grace?

968
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:43,751
- What's wrong?
- No. Stop.

969
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:47,054
I don't wanna hear it. I don't wanna
hear it. I don't wanna hear it.

970
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:48,789
What happened?

971
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:50,324
Like you care what happened!

972
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:52,827
What do you mean? Of course I care!
Where are you going?

973
01:18:52,829 --> 01:18:54,762
Somewhere!
Anywhere!

974
01:18:54,764 --> 01:18:58,299
If you run, you're just gonna take the
problem with you. You know that, don't you?

975
01:18:58,301 --> 01:19:01,769
So you're not gonna have to deal with it,
are you? That's not the point, Grace.

976
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:04,739
- You don't even want me here.
- What are you talking about?

977
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:07,775
- You know what? You just wanna run.
- Stop!

978
01:19:07,777 --> 01:19:10,244
You want the same action, you're
gonna get the same result.

979
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:12,780
Don't! Don't give me advice.
Okay?

980
01:19:12,782 --> 01:19:14,682
I was fine before I met you.

981
01:19:14,684 --> 01:19:17,051
Grace, calm down. I was!
I was fine!

982
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:19,353
You are not fine.
You need to calm down.

983
01:19:19,355 --> 01:19:22,056
Think about this. You've got a home here.
You have a job.

984
01:19:22,058 --> 01:19:23,958
Stop! What is wrong...
Why do you...

985
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,493
Stop!
Get out of my way!

986
01:19:25,495 --> 01:19:27,895
Is this about some guy
who doesn't even want you?

987
01:19:27,897 --> 01:19:30,164
No! Leave me alone!

988
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:31,799
Just leave me alone!

989
01:19:31,801 --> 01:19:33,300
Gracie!

990
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:54,388
Get away from me!
I hate you!

991
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:56,791
Get away!

992
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:07,768
Get off me!
Get off me!

993
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:11,305
You promised! Don't do this!
Get away from me!

994
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:14,275
- I hate you!
- No, you don't. Look what you're doing.

995
01:20:14,277 --> 01:20:16,644
You're scaring her.

996
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:18,179
Mommy?

997
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:20,681
No. No. No.
I won't leave you alone.

998
01:20:20,683 --> 01:20:23,050
No, I won't leave you alone!
I hate you!

999
01:20:27,223 --> 01:20:29,523
Get away from me!

1000
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:38,399
I hate you.

1001
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,353
Come on, Mommy.

1002
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:08,495
Why did you leave me, Mom?

1003
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:14,568
Why did you do it?

1004
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:25,312
Wasn't I worth being well for?

1005
01:21:29,685 --> 01:21:33,320
Why didn't you take care of me?

1006
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:41,228
Because she was ill, Gracie.

1007
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:45,833
And if I could change the
past for you, I would do it.

1008
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:50,571
I would.

1009
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:00,781
But we can't change the past.

1010
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:06,287
If I could, I would've
done it 11 years ago...

1011
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:08,956
when my daughter died
of that overdose.

1012
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:15,396
And every night since then
I go to sleep,

1013
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:18,465
and I imagine
how I could've stopped it.

1014
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,774
But I was too ill.

1015
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:33,213
I hate her.

1016
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:35,282
Oh, God, no.

1017
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:37,445
Don't say that, Gracie.

1018
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:42,623
How do I not hate her?

1019
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:49,997
She missed everything
I needed her for.

1020
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:55,736
She missed everything
that mattered.

1021
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:01,742
I needed her.

1022
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:07,715
I had no one...

1023
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,719
to talk to when I got lost.

1024
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:15,956
Yeah.

1025
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,660
I do.

1026
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:24,898
I hate her.

1027
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:46,086
I don't trust anybody.

1028
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:52,860
And it's because of her.

1029
01:23:57,599 --> 01:23:59,566
Grace.

1030
01:23:59,568 --> 01:24:01,668
Where are you gonna go?
Grace?

1031
01:24:14,015 --> 01:24:16,417
Sonia?

1032
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:19,753
Sonia!

1033
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:24,925
Gracie!
Where's Sonia?

1034
01:24:24,927 --> 01:24:26,427
Why?
What's going on?

1035
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:29,129
Sonia!
It's Jessie!

1036
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:30,798
Come on!

1037
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:35,369
Let's go!

1038
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:44,378
Wait!

1039
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:53,320
She crashed her car
up by 1-95.

1040
01:24:53,322 --> 01:24:56,290
They took her into surgery a
couple of hours ago. Was it bad?

1041
01:24:56,292 --> 01:25:00,094
Where's Tom? He went to get a
cup of coffee a while ago.

1042
01:25:00,096 --> 01:25:02,162
Oh, here he is.
Tom? Hey.

1043
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:11,371
She's been drunk
since yesterday.

1044
01:25:11,373 --> 01:25:15,642
They said she was doing 90 miles
an hour when she lost control.

1045
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:18,545
I'm sure the doctors
are gonna do every...

1046
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:26,453
- We did what we could.
- Oh, my God!

1047
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,789
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God.

1048
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:32,192
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

1049
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:41,935
I'm so sorry.

1050
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:44,538
I'm so sorry.

1051
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:54,581
[ Dispatcher, Indistinct ]

1052
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:18,065
Thank you.

1053
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:05,612
It is my great pleasure...

1054
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:08,982
to introduce
tonight's speaker, Gracie.

1055
01:28:17,293 --> 01:28:19,726
Whoo!

1056
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:25,032
Hi. I'm Gracie.
I'm an alcoholic.

1057
01:28:25,034 --> 01:28:27,334
Hi, Gracie!
Hi.

1058
01:28:27,336 --> 01:28:31,972
I think I know all of you and have gotten
to know all of you over the years.

1059
01:28:31,974 --> 01:28:36,009
I don't know why all of you,
especially my family,

1060
01:28:36,011 --> 01:28:39,279
put up with the person I was
when I landed here.

1061
01:28:39,281 --> 01:28:43,250
All I know for sure is that a
community of strangers loved me...

1062
01:28:43,252 --> 01:28:45,852
until I could love myself.

1063
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:48,588
This disease has claimed
so many lives,

1064
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:51,091
including my mom and...

1065
01:28:51,093 --> 01:28:52,893
our Jessie.

1066
01:28:52,895 --> 01:28:55,696
I-I am just so grateful
to all of you...

1067
01:28:55,698 --> 01:28:59,032
for guiding me
into this new way of life.
