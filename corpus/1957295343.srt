I mean, here we are.
We're together for one night and...

866
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,458
Dead people are trying to kill us.

867
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:30,333
[Josh] <i>None of this is random.</i>

868
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:33,375
It's Sarah Fier.

869
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:35,583
She's turning Shadysiders into killers.

870
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:37,583
Do you really believe that?

871
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:41,083
No one actually thinks
that this witch shit is real.

872
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:44,291
Yeah, it's something babysitters make up
to scare kids.

873
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:45,750
No, no. Just listen to me.

874
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:50,083
1666, Sarah Fier was hanged
for witchcraft, fact.

875
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:53,333
But ever since she was executed,
she's been possessing people,

876
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:55,958
turning them into killers,
to take revenge on the town.

877
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:59,000
- [Simon] It's like the nursery rhyme.
- [Josh] Yeah. Yeah.

878
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:03,083
[Simon] "Before the witch's final breath,
she found a way to cheat her death."

879
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,833
"By cutting off her cursed hand,

880
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,916
she kept her grip upon our land."

881
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:14,666
"She reaches from beyond the grave

882
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:18,875
to make good men her wicked slaves."

883
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:20,500
Yes, exactly.

884
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:24,166
Don't you see what's happening to us?
This is all proof.

885
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,750
Shadyside isn't just
some hotbed for psychos.

886
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:29,666
All these massacres are connected
to Sarah Fier.

887
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,250
The witch's curse is real!

888
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:34,541
Fine. Let's assume that the witch
has been possessing people

889
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,875
for some sort of messed-up vendetta.

890
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:40,416
This isn't the same as the mall massacre.
Something different is happening to us.

891
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,750
Something way worse.

892
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:46,125
OK, we have two of her killers after us
and both of them are dead.

893
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,333
Why is she so mad at us?

894
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:49,416
[Sam] I saw her.

895
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:53,166
Last night, I don't…

896
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,166
I don't know, you know.
I thought I hit my head…

897
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,291
It was…

898
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:01,875
It was her.

899
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:05,416
I saw the witch.

900
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,625
[ominous drumbeat]

901
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:08,625
[crickets chirping]

902
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:13,916
I can't believe you're wearing that.

903
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,208
Can't believe you're above it,

904
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:17,051
when we're in the middle
of the fucking woods

905
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,791
and dead maniacs are after us.

906
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:20,000
[sighs]

907
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:24,833
[high-pitched shrill]

908
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,666
OK, so I fell out of the car…

909
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:42,625
here.

910
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,500
I was crawling,

911
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,916
and my nose was bleeding.

912
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:50,958
And then…

913
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,000
- [metal clinking]
- I feel something.

914
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:00,833
[Kate] Chains?

915
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,666
Oh! Not just chains.

916
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,041
- [Kate] Holy shit.
- Oh my gosh.

917
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:13,291
- No way.
- Oh!

918
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:21,208
Fier. It's her.

919
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,500
It's her grave.

920
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,750
Oh no, no. No!

921
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:28,541
This is bad! This is really bad!

922
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:31,208
No wonder the witch is pissed at us.
I'd be pissed too.

923
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:32,541
Sam disturbed her grave.

924
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:36,791
[sighs] Now she's sending
her henchmen after us.

925
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:38,583
Henchmen?

926
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:43,000
As in every one of those sickos
on your wall is coming after us?

927
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,375
[twigs snapping]

928
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:45,958
Did you hear that?

929
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,333
[breathing heavily]

930
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:50,958
[Simon] Hold up. Hold up.

931
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:54,583
She's mad
because we disturbed her grave, right?

932
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,375
Yeah. So?

933
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:59,416
So, let's un-disturb it!

934
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,875
Just put the bones back, rebury them,
and put her to rest!

935
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:04,583
No, that's so stupid!

936
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:05,708
That's genius!

937
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,125
Yeah! In… in <i>Poltergeist!</i>

938
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:09,666
- [twigs snapping]
- [gasping]

939
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:13,125
Whatever.
Let's do it quickly so we can go.

940
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:14,625
[dramatic music playing]

941
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:24,166
[Simon] OK.

942
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,833
Deena, Deena!
Find something to wrap her bones!

943
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:40,333
[ominous music playing]

944
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:45,375
[gasps]

945
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,625
[woman] <i>You! It's you!</i>

946
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:49,291
[screaming] <i>It's you!</i>

947
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:51,000
[gasps]

948
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:52,791
Your nose…

949
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:58,333
[Josh] Guys?

950
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,375
I think there's someone in the woods!

951
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:05,666
[metal chains clinking]

952
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:13,041
[woman whispers] <i>It's you!</i>

953
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,000
<i>It's you!</i>

954
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,791
We need to hurry!

955
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,500
There, there.

956
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:20,916
We're sorry.

957
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:22,583
Did it work?

958
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:26,666
Did it work?

959
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,666
[breathing shakily]

960
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,208
[dramatic music playing]

961
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:37,291
[Josh grunts]

962
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:42,666
- [Simon] No!
- [woman screams] <i>It's you!</i>

963
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,041
- [screaming]
- [Deena] Go, run!

964
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:48,666
Run! Run!

965
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,000
Go! Come on, go!

966
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:52,458
Start the car! Go!

967
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:55,083
- [engine starts]
- [tires screech]

968
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:01,500
- That was the Camp Nightwing Killer!
- That was a bust!

969
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:04,625
Yeah, maybe because
it's not like the movies, OK?

970
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:07,125
It's not as easy as putting bones to rest!

971
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:10,916
- It should've worked. It always works!
- [Josh] Maybe it's her missing hand.

972
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,666
Who gives a shit? It doesn't matter.
Hey, how do I not die?

973
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,666
[Simon] We! How do <i>we </i>not die!

974
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:18,041
And I'm looking at you, witch nerd!

975
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:20,750
- I… I don't know!
- They're not coming for us!

976
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,541
- They're coming for me.
- What?

977
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:28,166
- I saw her again…
- [woman whispers] <i>It's you.</i>

978
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:31,666
The witch. She… I disturbed her grave.

979
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,833
- [woman whispers] <i>It's you.</i>
- She wants me.

980
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:39,541
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Nightwing ran right by me.

981
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:43,541
I jumped out his way, it was like
he didn't even see me. He went for her.

982
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:47,250
Guys, no! Ruby attacked Simon.

983
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:50,916
Skull Mask came after us at home.
And while you guys were babysitting!

984
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:53,375
[brakes screeching]

985
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:55,166
No, he didn't.

986
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,250
Skull Mask didn't care about us.

987
00:57:57,333 --> 00:58:00,250
He wanted this. Sam's blood.

988
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:02,541
- What the fu…
- Oh!

989
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:06,041
Yeah! From the crash
when Sam puked period!

990
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:07,666
It's <i>Jaws</i>, dude!

991
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,083
A shark smelling blood!

992
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:11,833
[panting] Kate's right!
When we found Skeletor,

993
00:58:11,916 --> 00:58:15,458
he was all sniffy and weird with my shirt
like a perv in a pantie shop!

994
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:17,625
Yeah, but he came to our house too!

995
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,500
[Kate] Deena…

996
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,958
[Simon] Sam bled on her bones,
now the witch wants more of her blood!

997
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:29,000
OK, so what do they do in <i>Jaws?</i>

998
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:31,666
They didn't go skinny-dipping
with the goddamn bait.

999
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,750
She's not bait!

1000
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:35,041
Yeah. She is.

1001
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:38,583
Seriously, if we're right
and they're after her…

1002
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:42,125
let's give these assholes what they want.

1003
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:46,125
[sirens wailing]

1004
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:56,875
[sighs]

1005
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,250
[menacing music playing]

1006
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:55,541
[Josh] Alright, we have to decontaminate.

1007
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:58,041
You can't have any of Sam's blood on you.

1008
00:59:58,125 --> 01:00:00,458
Well, not much I can do about that.

1009
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:05,958
Deena, you have to get clean too!
Not a single drop, OK?

1010
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:07,875
[Simon] Rub-a-dub-dub time!

1011
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:09,791
[Kate] Hey, wait.

1012
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:13,083
I don't want to go in by myself.

1013
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,625
[exhales slowly]

1014
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:26,125
[whispering] Up, up, down, down.
Left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

1015
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,791
Holy shit, your shoulder.

1016
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:37,541
It's fine.

1017
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:39,458
OK, well,

1018
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,125
fine or not, we s… still need to cover it.

1019
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:49,000
[soft music playing]

1020
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,541
[humming]

1021
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:32,041
[Kate] Do you really think
this is going to work?

1022
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I do.

1023
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:41,458
[Kate] Josh…

1024
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:43,708
Can you help me?

1025
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:51,958
[dramatic music playing]

1026
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:06,166
[Sam sighs]

1027
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,166
This is all my fault.

1028
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:10,791
I'm sorry.

1029
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:13,208
When I went to Sunnyvale,

1030
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:15,333
I ran away from you.

1031
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:19,583
Because you were, like…

1032
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:22,708
this reminder.

1033
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,250
I was scared of this.

1034
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:28,208
Of us.

1035
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,208
Of me.

1036
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,291
And, like, tonight's been the first time

1037
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:38,833
I've felt like myself in…

1038

01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:28,458
Yeah, she… she survived, but…

1214
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,458
but first she died.

1215

1216
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:35,263

in the woods."

01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:38,208

but local boy performed CPR."

What if this is it?

1219
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:44,500
What if that's how she survived?
Her heart stopped.

1220
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:46,583
She survived by dying.

1221
01:13:46,666 --> 01:13:49,666
What is it? The fucking rhyme.
The fucking rhyme!

1222
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,916
"She'll take your blood,
she'll take your head!"

1223
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,416
- "She'll follow you..."
- "Until you're dead."

1224
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,166
- [pounding continues]
- It's just like Kate said. OK?

1225
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,791
The witch wants you dead.

1226
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:01,583
So… we kill you.

1227
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:06,541
And then, just like this C. Berman bitch,
we bring you back to life.

1228
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:07,708

[ominous music playing]

1242
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:41,750
A few months ago, my brother Timothy
had an unfortunate experience

1243
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:45,375
in which he ingested too much
of a certain substance.

1244
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,250
He was dead for two minutes.

1245
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,333
But…

1246
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:52,125
we got him back!

1247
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:54,250
[Deena] Kate.

1248
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:56,875
It's time for your close-up.

1249
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:04,833
You need to take these in order.
Pile one takes the edge off.

1250
01:16:04,916 --> 01:16:07,958
You're gonna feel like
you're being fucked by a unicorn.

1251
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:12,666
Pile two is gonna bring
your core temp <i>way </i>down.

1252
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,958
You may feel slightly sick.

1253
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:19,458
You need to take a five-minute interval
between pile two and pile three.

1254
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:22,583
That's really important, OK?
Pile three brings you down and out,

1255
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:25,166
so take that "take five"
or it's all gonna go to shit!

1256
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,541
- How many do we have?
- Tons. Like a thousand.

1257
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:29,833
Wait. EpiPens?

1258
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:32,375
Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline.

1259
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:35,250
This is what brings her back.
This is Jesus!

1260
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:37,916
[sighs]

1261
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,375
[Deena] Sam's blood marks the spot.

1262
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,541
Remember half an hour ago,
when you wanted to murder me?

1263
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:56,458
You don't have to do this. You can leave.

1264
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:59,625
Remember when you decided
to sacrifice yourself for us?

1265
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:01,666
We're ending this together.

1266
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:05,791
Die well, my friend.

1267
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:09,375
We got back door patrol.

1268
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:12,625
[Kate] Hey!

1269
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,625
I'll run interference up here.

1270
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:30,541
[ominous drumbeat]

1271
01:17:31,416 --> 01:17:34,250
OK, I got stock room.
You take the emergency exit.

1272
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:37,500
Whoa! No, no, no!
Splitting up is not a good idea at all.

1273
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:41,041
But, dude, listen to me.
I know that this is all fucked,

1274
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:42,958
but… we gotta do this.

1275
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,250
Kate,

1276
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,791
she's a crusher.

1277
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:50,333
She doesn't have time for most people.

1278
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,500
I know.

1279
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:56,333
She's being nice
because we're probably gonna die.

1280
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:57,541
No! OK, well…

1281
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:00,750
maybe we're gonna die,

1282
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:03,291
but Kate is not nice.

1283
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:07,000
She sees something in you.

1284
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:12,958
- So?
- So, see that in yourself, dude.

1285
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:16,291
We would not be this far
if it weren't for you.

1286
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,250
Now we have to keep those psychos
away from Sam.

1287
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:22,333
So go…

1288
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:24,250
[slaps shoulder] …man up,

1289
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,166
and check that exit.

1290

[Sam] Deena.

1291
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:35,708
Deena.

1292
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:39,166
What if we fuck up and just kill me?

1293
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:42,750
What if you can't bring me back?
[sniffles]

1294
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:44,666
Listen to me.

1295
01:18:45,916 --> 01:18:47,083
When you left,

1296
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:48,333
I saw it all.

1297
01:18:48,416 --> 01:18:49,708
My whole future,

1298

1302
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:01,375
No way out.

1303
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:04,416
But tonight, even though we are in hell,

1304
01:19:05,416 --> 01:19:08,000
I feel like I have
another chance with you.

1305
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:10,583
And I'm not gonna lose you again.

1306
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:13,500
Because you, and we,

1307
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:15,083
are the way out.

1308
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:20,541
When this is all over,
I am gonna take you on a date.

the best night of our goddamn lives.
