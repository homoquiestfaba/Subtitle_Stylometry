I don't want you to make 
Mrs. Withers mad at me.

28
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,776
- It's only a matter 
of what's fair dear,

29
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,779
you have better grades than 
that little foreign student.

30
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,516
- He's not foreign mommy, 
Eduardo is Hispanic

31
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,017
and he's a good student too.

32
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,619
- Not as good as you are.

33
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,621
Do you mind?

34
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:35,922
- Yes ma'am.

35
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,357
- Thank you.

36
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,862
The award is for outstanding 
student of the year,

37
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,131
you have straight A's 
perfect attendance.

38
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,300
- But mommy-- 
- No buts about it, dear.

39
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,303
Is that little Mexican in the 
talented and gifted group?

40
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,804
No.

41
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,406
- It's just a student plaque,

42
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,808
I don't need another 
I got one last year.

43
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,944
- And the year before, 
and the year before that

44
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,380
and you deserve it 
again this year.

45
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,447
I think,

46
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,685
maybe this should be 
a private conference.

47
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,556
- Mommy, please, please 
don't embarrass me.

48
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,758
- I would never do that.

49
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,994
Who's your best friend?

50
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:16,829
(sighing)

51
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:17,964
- You are.

52
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:22,268
- Who loves you more than 
anything on God's green earth?

53
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,537
(soft music)

54
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:25,805
- You do mommy.

55
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:27,240
- That's right, 
now, you run along,

56
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,641
I'll meet you on the playground.

57
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:29,842
- Yes mommy.

58
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,312
- Jessica Anne!

59
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:33,580
- Yes mommy.

60
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,448
- Posture.

61
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,719
- (sighs) Yes mommy.

62
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,760
(door knocking)

63
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,529
- Good afternoon Mrs. Sterling.

64
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,801
I hope you don't mind if I 
continue with the decorating.

65
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,438
The Spring Festival means 
so much to the children.

66
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,575
- We did have an appointment 
for a conference.

67
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,046
- Mrs. Sterling, we 
had our conference

68
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,748
for the quarter just last week.

69
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:14,821
I would like to get these 
decorations up for the children.

70
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,826
So if you don't mind, 
we'll talk as I work.

71
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,661
- I don't mind.

72
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,565
You're presenting the plaque

73
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,767
at the PTA meeting 
tomorrow evening.

74
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,938
- That's right.

75
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,842
- You know that my daughter 
deserves this award.

76
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,712
- Your daughter is 
a wonderful student.

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,515
So is Eduardo Melendez

78
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,619
- Are his grades as 
good as Jessica Ann's?

79
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,391
- Actually, Mrs. Sterling, 
that's none of your business.

80
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,993
Neither is how I arrived

81
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,363
at who the year's 
outstanding student is.

82
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,598
- Really?

83
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,067
- Really.

84
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:06,539
Eduardo faces obstacles 
that your daughter does not.

85
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,443
And when someone 
like Eduardo excels,

86
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,413
it's important that he 
receive recognition.

87
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,616
- Because he's a Mexican?

88
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,920
You're punishing my daughter 
because she's white,

89
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:21,954
and comes from a good family.

90
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,592
(sighing)

91
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,496
- Well, now, I don't 
look at it that way.

92
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,799
When a person of 
color like Eduardo.

93
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,637
- You're not going 
to give this award

94
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,138
to Jessica Ann are you?

95
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,745
(tense music)

96
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,784
- It's been decided.

97
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,089
- There's no name on the plaque.

98
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,659
It's not too late for you 
to do the right thing.

99
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,895
- It is too late.

100
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,665
What are you teaching 
your daughter

101
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,668
with behavior like 
this as an example?

102
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,903
- Well, what are 
you teaching her?

103
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,506
By taking something 
that's rightfully hers

104
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,441
and giving it to somebody,

105
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,578
just because he's 
a person of color.

106
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,713
(sighing)

107
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,051
- I have nothing more to 
say to you Mrs Sterling!

108
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,587
Good afternoon.

109
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,792
(foreboding music)

110
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,431
(screaming)

111
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,969
(tense music)

112
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,066
- Is something the matter?

113
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,169
- Yes, there's been 
a terrible accident.

114
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,239
When I went to see Mrs. Withers,

115
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,009
she was lying on the floor.

116
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,610
She'd been up the ladder

117
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,479
decorating the room 
for you children.

118
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,115
- Oh mommy, oh no!

119
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:30,716
- She must have been a very

120
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,752
thoughtful teacher.

121
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:38,090
- Mommy, and you make 
it sound like she's--

122
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,560
- Dead, yes, she's dead dear.

123
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,595
I think she may have 
broken her neck.

124
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,231
(crying)

125
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,034
Well, I stopped by the office 
and asked the Secretary

126
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,669
to phone for an ambulance.

127
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,806
I think maybe we should wait 
until help comes, don't you?

128
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,007
- Yes mommy.

129
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,114
Why did they call for 
an ambulance I wonder?

130
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,618
Mrs. Withers was dead.

131
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,019
What good would the doctor do?

132
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,691
- People die dear, it's natural.

133
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,993
- What's so natural about 
falling off the ladder?

134
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,597
- Is that a smarty tone?

135
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:18,631
- No Mommy.

136
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,833
- Because I don't think Mrs. 
Withers would like you speaking

137
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,235
to your mother in a smarty tone.

138
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,669
- No mommy.

139
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:30,009
- Anyway, people fall 
off ladders all the time.

140
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,577
All the time.

141
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,814
More accidents happen at 
home, than anywhere else.

142
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:36,949
- Mommy,

143
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,051
Can we go now?

144
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,556
- No dear, I will have to 
speak to these gentlemen first.

145
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:49,228
(911 operator speaking)

146
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,966
(upbeat music)

147
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,856
- Mr. Spellman. 
- March.

148
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,357
What are you doing here?

149
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,293
This isn't a murder 
investigation.

150
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,662
- We'll get to that later 
where is our witness?

151
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,012
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
They asked mommy questions

152
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,716
for a long time, Lieutenant 
March seemed grouchy,

153
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:45,985
I don't think he 
wanted to be there.

154
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,854
- [Lieutenant March] Well 
why don't you answer me?

155
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,324
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

156
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,393
but Lieutenant March had a 
loud voice, and it got louder.

157
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,296
- So, you didn't speak 
to Mrs. Withers at all?

158
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,765
- How could I?

159
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,869
She was lying on the floor 
with her neck broken.

160
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,205
- But you had an appointment?

161
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,709
- Yes, a parent 
teacher conference.

162
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,244
- Were you on time 
for the conference?

163
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:13,879
- I'm never late lieutenant.

164
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,050
Is there anything else?

165
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,251
- No,

166
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,655
not right now anyway.

167
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,724
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

168
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,996
You have my address, my number.

169
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,965
- Oh yeah, I got your number.

170
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,434
- Let's go dear,

171
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,904
Your Aunt Beth is 
waiting dinner.

172
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,444
(melancholy music)

173
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:56,989
- So what's your story?

174
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,368
(upbeat music)

175
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,440
- [Jessica Ann 
Voiceover] Our house

176
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,042
on Rockwall road 
was really cool.

177
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,576
We lived here for two years

178
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,912
ever since mummy 
married Mr. Sterling.

179
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:30,156
Mr. Sterling was really old 60, 
the paper said when he died,

180
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:31,924
but mommy loved him a lot.

181
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:39,331
He had an insurance agency and 
was kind of rich or anyway,

182
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,101
we always kind of 
thought he was.

183
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,839
I heard mommy tell Aunt Beth,

184
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,209
that Mr. Sterling wasn't as 
rich as he pretended to be,

185
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,878
plus, a lot of his 
money and property

186
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,980
and stuff went to his kids,

187
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,249
or those other two 
witches he married.

188
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,752
Oh, only mommy 
didn't say witches.

189
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,091
Aunt Beth was really cool.

190
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,993
We've been seeing a lot of her 
since she divorced Uncle Bob

191
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,528
and moved to that apartment.

192
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,773
- Oh, you poor 
dear, you poor dear.

193
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:21,907
Did she see?

194
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,943
- No, I discovered the body,

195
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,611
Jessica Ann was 
on the playground.

196
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:26,545
- Oh, thank God.

197
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,380
Do either of you even 
feel like eating?

198
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:29,548
- Not really?

199
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:30,950
- Jessica Ann!

200
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:32,618
Your aunt came all 
the way over here

201
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,087
at the last minute to 
fix us some supper.

202
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,889
- Don't worry about that.

203
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,125
- Smells like spaghetti.

204
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,493
- That's what it is.

205
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,828
I made a big bowl of 
Italian salad too.

206
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,463
- Can I just go 
in my room please?

207
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,099
- No, no, a little 
unpleasantness

208
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,969
is not going to stand in 
the way of good nutrition.

209
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,071
- Please if she doesn't want--

210
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,974
- Now you march in 
there, young lady.

211
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,242
- Yes mommy.

212
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,078
- Your salad too.

213
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,346
- Yes mommy.

214
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,817
- Don't you ever contradict me

215
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,485
in front of my daughter again.

216
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,157
You know how impressionable 
young girls can be.

217
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,564
(tense music)

218
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,009
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
But I didn't eat much.

219
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:31,911
All I could think 
of was Mrs. Withers

220
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,916
and how nice she was, 
and how she was dead now.

221
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,617
(door knocking)

222
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,386
- Mind if I come in?

223
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,955
(soft music)

224
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,127
Don't feel bad about crying,

225
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,129
It's good to get it 
out of your system.

226
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,899
- Do you think Mrs. 
Withers had any children?

227
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,236
- Probably, maybe 
even grandchildren.

228
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,238
- Do you think I should 
write them a letter?

229
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:00,472
- Why dear?

230
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,443
- To tell them what a 
good teacher she was.

231
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,979
(soft music)

232
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,583
- I think that's 
a wonderful idea.

233
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,353
- I'll write it tonight, 
and add their names later,

234
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,424
Aunt Beth, do you remember,

235
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,293
when Mr. Sterling wanted 
me to call him daddy?

236
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,296
- Well sure honey, 
what about it?

237
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,733
I told him that I didn't 
wanna call him that,

238
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,070
and I'm afraid it might 
have hurt his feelings,

239
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,471
and now he's dead.

240
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,340
(crying)

241
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,708
- I'm sure he understood.

242
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,243
- I never explained it.

243
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,981
It's just that I still 
call my real Daddy, daddy.

244
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,284
I talk to him at night.

245
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,357
I was only six when he 
drowned in that accident.

246
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,094
But I still remember 
him real good.

247
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,295
- Sure you do.

248
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,332
- I was mad at mommy for 
marrying Mr. Sterling.

249
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:01,767
- That's only natural dear.

250
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,736
- But sometimes,

251
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,772
I don't think she misses 
either one of them.

252
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,408
Daddy or Mr. Sterling.

253
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,779
- You know, Jessie your mother,

254
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,649
she's kind of a special person.

255
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,951
- I know.

256
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,654
She's very smart and pretty.

257
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,756
- She has some 
wonderful qualities.

258
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,492
- She does everything for me.

259
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,494
- She does a lot for you,

260
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:33,332
but she doesn't always feel 
things like maybe she should.

261
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,436
- What do you mean?

262
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,538
- It's hard to explain.

263
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,206
She was pampered a lot.

264
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:42,608
There were four of us, you know,

265
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,177
but she was the 
first and favorite.

266
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,315
Your grandparents, rest their 
souls gave her everything.

267
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,549
And why not?

268
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,418
She was so pretty, so perfect.

269
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,021
- She always got 
her way didn't she?

270
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:57,456
- And how did you know that?

271
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,393
- 'Cause she still does.

272
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,531
- Jessie,

273
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,701
I always kind of looked after 
your mother, protected her.

274
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,303
- What do you mean Aunt Beth?

275
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,774
- It's just as you grow 
older, try to understand.

276
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,411
Try to forgive her 
if she seems well--

277
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,214
- Cold?

278
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,616
(soft music)

279
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:32,491
- Just remember in her way, 
she loves you very much.

280
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:33,659
- Yeah.

281
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,494
- Am I interrupting?

282
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,497
- No, not at all, 
just girl talk.

283
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,799
- Isn't that sweet?

284
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,103
But not as sweet 
as chocolate cake

285
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,305
Anybody interested?

286
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,406
- Is Mark here?

287
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,208
I thought I heard his car.

288
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,210
- Right downstairs.

289
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,714
- So, what do you think?

290
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,484
- Yeah.

291
00:16:59,151 --> 00:16:59,885
- Mark and chocolate cake,

292
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,720
that's a combo few 
girls could resist.

293
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,289
(soft music)

294
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,502
- There's my girl,

295
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,337
Well come on.

296
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,108
Are you okay angel?

297
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,276
- Sure.

298
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,846
- Your mom told me about 
today, it's awful rough.

299
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,415
- I'm fine Mark, really.

300
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,484
- Step into my office.

301
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,623
Angel.

302
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,260
If you need somebody 
to talk to--

303
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,495
- Mark, I'm fine, really?

304
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,368
- You know when I was 10 
my boy scout leader died,

305
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,870
he was killed in a car accident

306
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,376
and I didn't have a dad around, 
he and my mom were divorced.

307
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,346
That scout troop leader

308
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,649
kind of became a 
surrogate father to me,

309
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,084
you know what that means?

310
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,120
- Kind of took the 
place of your real dad?

311
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,054
- Right.

312
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,859
Anyway, when he 
died, I felt empty.

313
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,663
And then I started 
to feel afraid.

314
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,399
- Afraid? 
- Mm-hmm.

315
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,268
See, for the first time I 
started to think about dying,

316
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,405
and I had trouble sleeping.

317
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,607
And I had nightmares.

318
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,278
And for the first 
time, I realized that

319
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,648
nobody lives forever.

320
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,018
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
Mark was so sweet.

321
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,422
But I had known about 
people done for a long time.

322
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,025
- Anyway, if you ever have 
any trouble like that,

323
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,294
I just want you to 
know I'm here for you.

324
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,664
- Whose for dessert?

325
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,566
- I am. 
- I am.

326
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,604
Mommy met Mark at a 
country club dance.

327
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,274
He had his own business, some 
kind of mail order thing.

328
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,346
(soft music)

329
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,557
Mommy said he moved 
here to get away

330
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,326
from the urban life, 
where he used to live.

331
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,496
- Wow, kill me with kindness.

332
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,731
(laughing)

333
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:26,865
- I'll just have the ice cream.

334
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,236
- Oh, what is wrong with me?

335
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,738
You're allergic to chocolate.

336
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:38,377
How about some strawberry 
compote on that ice cream?

337
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,779
- Oh, that does sound good.

338
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,481
- There's a jar in the fridge.

339
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,985
- Those are pretty good pearls.

340
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:48,787
- Thank you honey.

341
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:50,989
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
Maybe it wasn't right

342
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,491
to assume how Mr. Sterling died,

343
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,960
but I hope mommy 
would marry Mark.

344
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,833
I didn't think it would be 
so hard calling him daddy.

345
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,907
- Oh here, let me 
have a crack at that.

346
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:13,879
- Here.

347
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,452
(cracking)

348
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,655
- What do you know?

349
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,857
Mommy's pretty 
strong for a girl.

350
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,960
- Now there's a sexist remark.

351
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,497
- I've seen her do that 
with ketchup bottles,

352
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,399
pickle jars lots of times.

353
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,737
- Remind me not to cross you.

354
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,305
- Don't cross me.

355
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,942
(tense music)

356
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,474
- What's a matter 
Little Miss perfect

357
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,142
get called to the 
principal's office?

358
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,411
- You mind your own business?

359
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,680
- There's some policemans 
waiting to talk to you.

360
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,081
- What?

361
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,717
- Maybe they wanna 
ask you what your mama

362
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,819
was doing in Mrs. 
Withers room yesterday.

363
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:29,621
- Everybody knows what 
my mother was doing

364
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,958
in Mrs. Withers room, 
she found the body.

365
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,194
- Maybe I seen your 
mama go in there

366
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,797
and stay for a good long while.

367
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,533
Maybe I heard them 
talking in there.

368
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,101
- You don't know anything.

369
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:44,970
- I see everything that 
goes on around this place,

370
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,005
nothing gets past 
these eagle eyes.

371
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,375
- You're a liar, and my 
minister says liars go to hell.

372
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,577
- Don't you go talking 
to me like that.

373
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,579
I'm like a teacher, 
you can't talk to me--

374
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,415
- Don't, get back to your work.

375
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,884
Jessica Ann move along.

376
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,919
- Yes, ma'am.

377
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,454
- Yes I'm.

378
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:10,028
(foreboding music)

379
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,534
- Jessica Ann, you remember me?

380
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:16,902
I'm Lieutenant March.

381
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,473
Now Mrs. Evans has given us 
permission to use her office.

382
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,142
Can we talk for a minute?

383
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,578
- Okay.

384
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,046
- Okay. 
- Thank you.

385
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:30,649
Come on.

386
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,522
Sit down here.

387
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,758
Jessica Ann,

388
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:44,629
Why did your mother wanna speak 
to Mrs. Withers yesterday?

389
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:45,931
- They had a conference.

390
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,700
- Oh, yes, the Parent 
Teacher Conference.

391
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:49,968
- Yes, sir.

392
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,170
- No, you don't have to 
call me sir Jessica Ann.

393
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,806
Candy?

394
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,476
- Mommy says not to take 
candy from strangers.

395
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,913
- Hmm, I don't want 
us to be strangers,

396
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,181
I want us to be friends.

397
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,586
- Friend or stranger, candy 
rots your teeth mommy says.

398
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:09,855
- Maybe,

399
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,958
Mommies don't always 
know best, hmm?

400
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:28,006
Jessica Ann, do you know 
how your teacher you died?

401
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,243
- Fell off a ladder?

402
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,211
- Oh yeah, she fell 
off a ladder, yes.

403
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,181
But Jessica Ann your teacher

404
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,051
died of a broken neck.

405
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,587
- Once she fell up the ladder.

406
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:44,689
- Now

407
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:49,027
we have a man called 
a medical examiner.

408
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,031
And he says that's not 
the way it happened.

409
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,966
Mm-mm.

410
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:59,104
He says it's very likely 
that a pair of hands did it.

411
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:09,781
Now, there was something 
missing from Mrs. Withers desk.

412
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,349
- Could I please go?

413
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,184
My stomach hurts.

414
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,854
- It was a plaque for the 
most outstanding student

415
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,991
of the year which I understand 
that you won last year.

416
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,660
- Yes sir.

417
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,128
- There's that sir again.

418
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,900
Now Mrs. Withers told 
a lot of her friends

419
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,169
that your mother 
called up complaining

420
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,138
that you didn't 
win it this year.

421
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:34,973
- She thought I deserved to win.

422
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,341
- I'm sure you did.

423
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:42,013
But the mother of the boy, 
who won the plaque, Eduardo,

424
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:43,815
Eduardo yes.

425
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,218
Mrs. Melendez,

426
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,021
I'm sure she'd love to have 
that plaque, and Eduardo.

427
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:58,964
Now if you found that 
plaque, would you tell me?

428
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,565
- Why would I find it?

429
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,133
- Well, I don't know, 
maybe your mother

430
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,036
took it off the desk when she 
was leaving the classroom.

431
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,571
- Who said she did?

432
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:07,572
- Nobody.

433
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,441
- And anyway, that 
wouldn't prove anything.

434
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,677
- Who said anything about 
proving anything Jessica Ann?

435
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:14,846
- I think if you have any 
more questions for me,

436
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,616
Lieutenant March, you should 
talk to my mother first.

437
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,885
- Jessica Ann.

438
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,558
- Try this one.

439
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,960
Jasper bought a newspaper 
for 10 cents more

440
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,063
than a fourth of $1, a 
card for five cents less

441
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,099
than half of $1, and a magazine.

442
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,268
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
If that policeman

443
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,802
has anything else to 
say, I didn't hear it.

444
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,306
I didn't hear anything any 
of my friends said either

445
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,342
or the substitute teacher.

446
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,244
I had a lot of thoughts too,

447
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,747
but I try not to 
listen to them either.

448
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,084
(cracking)

449
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,921
- How was school today dear?

450
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,355
- Okay.

451
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:58,957
- Anything special happen?

452
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,927
- I talked to that policeman.

453
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,630
- What police man?

454
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,199
Lieutenant March?

455
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,037
- He just has some questions.

456
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,673
- About what dear?

457
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,509
- Mrs. Withers, nothing special.

458
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,111
I just hope he doesn't 
talk to Miss Jones.

459
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,246
- Who?

460
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,081
- That awful janitor.

461
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,717
She was teasing me 
saying terrible things.

462
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:28,620
- Like what dear?

463
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,389
- That you were in 
Mrs. Withers room

464
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,225
a long time talking to her.

465
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,895
(tense music)

466
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,269
- She's just a stupid 
woman and a menial job.

467
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,104
Ignore her.

468
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,143
Oh!

469
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:53,812
How I hate this instant!

470
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,747
Ah!

471
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,950
We're out of everything 
in this house.

472
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,486
I think I may make 
a run to the store

473
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,388
and get some fresh ground.

474
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:04,723
- Can I come along?

475
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,125
- Why don't you just stay 
here and finish your homework?

476
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:08,259
And

477
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,795
maybe later we 
can watch a video.

478
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:11,830
- Great.

479
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,000
- I'll swing by Video 
factory and pick up.

480
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,403
How about Beauty 
and the Beast again?

481
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,006
- Excellent.

482
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,375
(soft music)

483
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,487
(foreboding music)

484
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,176
You were bothering 
my daughter today?

485
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,913
- I wasn't bother nobody.

486
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,415
You got permission to 
be in here after hours?

487
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,086
- I'm a taxpayer, I don't 
need your permission.

488
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,122
- Well, you just get 
along about your business.

489
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,258
- What were you saying 
to my daughter today?

490
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,561
- Well, you mean that 
I seen you in there

491
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:51,930
in Miss Withers room yesterday?

492
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,799
That I heard you two 
to talking in there?

493
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:56,501
- Is that what you 
told the police?

494
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,002
- I didn't tell 
the police nothing.

495
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,839
- I want you stay 
away from my daughter!

496
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,240
- And the police,

497
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,943
maybe I should go see them,

498
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,212
maybe I'd get a 
big old horse laugh

499
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,315
out of a fine lady like you

500
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,118
putting up with 
all that bullshit.

501
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,254
You'd make the papers and not 
the society page this time.

502
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,491
- I won't have you bothering her

503
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,426
or embarrassing me.

504
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,063
- Maybe you should 
make it worth my while.

505
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,036
(foreboding music)

506
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:37,342
I know you didn't do 
nothing, fine lady like you,

507
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,043
but maybe it'd be 
worth your while.

508
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,479
(tense music)

509
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,178
- God damn fuse!

510
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,785
Let me fix those 
little assholes again.

511
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,758
(both shouting frightened)

512
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,593
- Better go get 
those lights fixed.

513
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,735
- No shit Sherlock.

514
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,340
(tense music)

515
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,328
(coughing)

516
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,633
(tense music)

517
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,728
(tense music)

518
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,960
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] My 
mind is full of awful thoughts

519
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,762
did Mr. Sterling really 
die of a heart attack?

520
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,365
What really happened 
that afternoon

521
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,000
when mommy and 
daddy went boating?

522
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:17,768
- Jessica Ann!

523
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,039
Oh, I didn't mean to 
startle you, honey.

524
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,542
I'm sorry I took so long.

525
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,777
I ran into an old 
friend at the store.

526
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,914
Ready for

527
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,516
Chinese and a movie?

528
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:36,921
- Great.

529
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,928
- Class please, I have 
something very important

530
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,764
to say to you, let's 
all settle down now.

531
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:47,898
Class please!

532
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,868
Mrs. Evans has 
something to say to you.

533
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,341
- People.

534
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,910
I'm sorry to have 
to tell you that

535
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,714
there has been another 
tragedy here at McKinley.

536
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,617
Our janitor

537
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,655
Miss Jones died last night

538
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,757
in an unfortunate accident.

539
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,760
- See, I told her she got fried.

540
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,095
- [Substitute Teacher] Quiet!

541
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,832
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
It was my fault, wasn't it?

542
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,035
I had told mommy 
about Miss Jones,

543
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,404
and now Miss Jones is dead.

544
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,975
Mrs. Evans said that she 
was arranging for counselors

545
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,744
to help any of us 
who might be troubled

546
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:35,780
by what had happened 
at McKinley lately.

547
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:40,718
If I told the counselors that 
my mommy maybe killed my daddy

548
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,954
and Mr. Sterling 
for their money,

549
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:46,891
what advice would they have?

550
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,359
- Jessica Ann.

551
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,695
You have anything to tell me?

552
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:51,962
- No sir.

553
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,967
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
I might be wrong

554
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,504
and even if I wasn't, 
she was my mommy.

555
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:05,876
But then I thought about 
Daddy and Mr. Sterling.

556
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,480
And I thought of 
somebody else I cared for

557
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,449
who might be in danger.

558
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,784
(soft music)

559
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,201
- Well,

560
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,105
we shouldn't be any 
later than mid night.

561
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,842
- Stay out as long as you 
like, enjoy yourselves.

562
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:42,880
- You are so sweet to do 
this Beth, I owe you one.

563
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,082
- I stopped keeping 
track a long time ago.

564
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,618
- Good bye angel.

565
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,520
- Bye.

00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,902

567
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,472
- No, nothing.

568
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,675
- You do know, don't you?

569
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,612
That there's nothing you 
can't talk to me about.

570
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,480
Is it what happened 
at school last week?

571
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:17,715
Your teacher?

572
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:18,749
That janitor?

573
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,619
- Can we watch Seinfeld?

574
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,221
Mommy doesn't like 
comedies, but I do.

575
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,825
(upbeat music)

576
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:30,888
- Have you noticed anything 
odd about Jessica Ann lately?

577
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,857
- Not really!

578
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,359
- I have.

579
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,928
For the last week or so 
she's been avoiding me,

580
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,130
snubbing me even.

581
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:41,799
- Oh, I never noticed that.

582
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,570
- You don't think she's 
been kind of moody?

583
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:50,608
- Well, maybe she's jealous.

584

(both laughing)

585
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:52,910

684

685
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,131

make you mad at me.

686
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:55,866

you Jessica Ann?

689
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,642
You see, I haven't 
been completely honest

690
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,346
with you, Jessica Ann, in 
fact, I've lied to you.

691
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:10,480
- What?

692
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:14,685
- My real name is Mark, 
but it's not Mark Jeffries

693
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,287
I'm what they call 
an investigator.

694
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:18,889
I work for an insurance company.

695
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,660
That's the company 
that's looking into 
Mr. Sterling's death.

696
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,264
- But you and Mommy.

697
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,203
- That wasn't very nice, but 
it wasn't part of any plan.

698
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,173
It just sort of happened.

699
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,507
- Do you love her?

700
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:43,046
- Well, your mommy's very 
beautiful woman and charming.

701
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,414
- Do you love her?

702
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:48,585
- No.

703
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,622
Just again, what I 
did wasn't very nice,

704
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,092
but I had to get 
close to your mommy.

705
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:56,360
- You sure did.

706
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,529
- I had to get the 
truth, Jessica Ann,

707
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,166
I think your mommy 
is a murderer.

708
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,202
But with your help--

709
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:06,436
- My help!

710
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:10,407
- Actually your mommy is 
the one who needs the help.

711
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,211
See if she's doing these things 
and we both think she is,

712
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:19,683
then she's a sick person 
and she needs to be stopped,

713
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:21,551
and she needs to be helped.

714
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,553
- Helped.

715
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,457
- If you could just think back

716
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,360
and tell me some of 
the things you've seen,

717
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:31,828
then we might be able to.

718
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,565
- Close your eyes dear.

719
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,208
(gun shots)

720
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,512
(Jessica Ann screaming)

721
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:53,250
(crying)

722
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,090
Come on sweetie, 
come on sweetie.

723
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,427
(crying)

724
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:23,480
(soft music)

725
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,317
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
I couldn't remember

726
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:29,252
ever seeing mommy cry before.

727
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:31,855
She seemed to cry 
at daddy's funeral,

728
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:37,327
and Mr. Sterling, but I'm 
pretty sure she's faking,

729
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:39,362
not this time.

730
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,303
I hope she wasn't sad 
because she's thinking

731
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,205
of doing something 
bad to me too.

732
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,577
- We have to call 
the police now dear.

733
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:57,848
- Yes mommy.

734
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:03,620
- And when they come, we 
have to stick together.

735
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,593
Do you understand dear?

736
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:11,261
- I'm not sure.

737
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:17,167
- We have to tell them 
things that fit together.

738
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,603
Like a puzzle fits together.

739
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:23,607
Do you understand dear?

740
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:24,841
- Yes mommy.

741
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,913
(foreboding music)

742
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:33,950
- Mark did

743
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:39,389
bad things to mommy tonight.

744
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:43,660
Bedroom things

745
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,296
that I didn't want him to do.

746
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,600
You do understand?

747
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,304
- I think so.

748
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,409
- And when mommy heard 
Mark in your bedroom,

749
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,413
she was afraid he 
might be trying to do

750
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,482
those same bad things to you.

751
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,788
- But he didn't.

752
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,223
- That doesn't matter,

753
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:17,961
and you don't have 
to say he did either.

754
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,262
- I'm glad mommy.

755
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:20,697
- Because I don't 
want you to lie.

756
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,004
And all those 
things Mark told you

757
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,874
about being an investigator 
for an insurance company.

758
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,276
Forget them.

759
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,812
He never said those things.

760
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:36,880
- Oh,

761
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,248
okay mommy.

762
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:40,483
- Because if you tell,

763
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,555
it would get mommy 
in a lot of trouble,

764
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,927
and we don't want that, do we?

765
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,362
- No mommy.

766
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,836
- Who's your best friend?

767
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,639
- You are mommy.

768
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:14,451
- Who loves you more than 
anything on God's green earth?

769
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:16,686
- You do mommy.

770
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,757
- Good girl.

771
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,933
Here baby.

772
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,636
(upbeat music)

773
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,758
- Please help!

774
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,427
Please hurry, we 
need an ambulance!

775
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:58,428
(crying)

776
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,798
I was molested, my 
daughter, I shot him.

777
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,369
Yeah, I shot him, I shot him.

778
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,505
(crying)

779
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,142
(tense music)

780
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:16,413
(call operator talking)

781
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:23,119
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
There were a lot of people

782
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,021
in the house almost all night.

783
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,104
- [Ambulance Attendant] 
Thank you honey.

784
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,840
- [Ambulance Attendant] 
That's a nice little girl.

785
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:46,810
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
Mark looked like a ghost.

786
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:07,430
(scary music)

787
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,843
Lieutenant March said I 
couldn't use my bedroom tonight,

788
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:21,845
and maybe not for 
a while after that.

789
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:26,816
That was okay, I didn't 
wanna sleep in there anyway.

790
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:31,020
- You don't have to tell 
me if you don't want to.

791
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,757
- Nothing to tell, 
mommy thought Mark

792
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,994
was going to do something bad 
to me, so she protected me.

793
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:42,832
(soft music)

794
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,704
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
Lieutenant March

795
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,106
talked to mommy for a long time.

796
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,610
Most of the time, I couldn't 
hear what they were saying,

797
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:55,945
but sometimes it 
was easy to hear.

798
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:57,280
- Am I under arrest?

799
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,816
- No, you are not under arrest.

800
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,854
And yes, you should 
contact your lawyer.

801
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,598
- More coffee lieutenant?

802
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:16,766
- Yeah.

803
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,605
Your sister is quite a woman.

804
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,842
- You don't believe her, do you?

805
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,178
- [Lieutenant March] Do you?

806
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:30,814
- Of course I believe 
her she's my sister.

807
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:31,948
- Yeah.

808
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,118
And Jeffrey Dahmer 
was somebody's brother.

809
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:36,986
- That was uncalled for.

810
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,055
- [Lieutenant March] Is it?

811
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,792
I suppose it is, it's 
been a long night.

812
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,830
I'll talk to Jessica 
Ann in the morning.

813
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,566
- Thank you for 
that much anyway.

814
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:57,207
- [Lieutenant March] Maybe she 
should stay with you tonight.

815
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:58,808
- That isn't my decision.

816
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:02,212
- Maybe it should be.

817
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:06,516
Thanks for the coffee.

818
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,991
- You aren't really 
asleep are you?

819
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,059
- No.

820
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:21,931
- What you told me,

821
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,501
is that what really 
happened Jessica Ann?

822
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,770
- Mommy thought Mark was going 
to do something bad to me,

823
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:29,172
so she protected me.

824
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,307
- You love your 
mommy, don't you?

825
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,408
- Yeah.

826
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:33,943
- I love her too.

827
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,144
- I know.

828
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:36,813
- But you're afraid 
of her, aren't you?

829
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,316
- Sure, every kid's 
afraid of their parents.

830
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,786
- Beth!

831
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,055
Maybe you better go now.

832
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:48,958
- Maybe I should take 
Jessica Ann tonight.

833
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,896
- I think you've done more 
than enough already Beth.

834
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:54,731
- I can stay if you like.

835
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:56,366
- We appreciate your concern,

836
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,235
but we've been through a 
lot of tragedy together,

837
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,937
Jessica Ann and I,

838
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,873
and we will get through 
tonight, just fine.

839
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,075
Won't we dear?

840
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:07,577
- Yes mommy!

841
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:13,049
(soft music)

842
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,056
- You take the couch, 
I'll take the chair

843
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:21,991
it'll be just like camping out.

844
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,360
(soft music)

845
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,269
(foreboding music)

846
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,093
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
The next afternoon,

847
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,862
Lieutenant March and some 
other people questioned

848
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,832
both me and mommy, 
together and separate.

849
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:08,137
Sometimes mommy's 
lawyer, Mr. Ekhardt

850
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,040
wouldn't let mommy 
answer a question.

851
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:12,442
- So you didn't know

852
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:17,880
the man you shared your bed 
with was investigating you?

853
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,215
- Absolutely not.

854
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,284
- Hasn't that been 
established Lieutenant?

855
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:22,652
- I suppose so.

856
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:27,156
But we've also established 
that the men she slept with

857
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,093
had a bad habit of dying.

858
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:32,195
- That's inappropriate 
Lieutenant.

859
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,164
- Conveniently dying, that is.

860
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,433
- Lieutenant!

861
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,002
- How much money did you inherit

862
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,772
when your first husband 
died Mrs. Sterling?

863
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,975
- How much money did 
your wife inherit

864
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:47,877
when her parents died?

865
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:49,379
And where were you at the time?

866
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:56,119
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
I didn't lie, not exactly.

867
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,889
Nobody asked if I knew 
Mark was an investigator.

868
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,124
- Jessica Ann,

869
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,760
did Mark Patterson

870
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,162
or Jeffrey's as you knew him

871
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,364
did he ever make

872
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:11,367
an advance toward you

873
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,937
of a a sexual nature?

874
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,040
- You know, there really 
should be a representative

875
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:18,741
from Child Welfare if 
you're gonna keep on--

876
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:22,111
- I am trying to confirm 
your client's story, Okay.

877
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,381
Now I apologize for asking 
Jessica Ann but did he?

878
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:27,817
- No, but mommy thought so.

879
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:29,852
- Oh really?

880
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:30,753
Why?

881
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,056
- Because he was in my 
bedroom in his pajamas

882
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:34,424
in the middle of the night.

883
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:37,260
- I think that's quite enough.

884
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:39,328
Good afternoon.

885
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,013
- Do they have 
enough to hold me?

886
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:58,414
- Not yet.

887
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,283
- What do you mean not yet?

888
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:01,317
- I don't think this 
thing is gonna lit up,

889
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:03,252
from the looks of that 
lieutenant in there,

890
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:05,822
This is only the 
start as (mumbles)

891
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:07,190
- Well, thank you Neal,

892
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:08,357
I'm sure that with 
you in our corner,

893
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:09,959
everything will be just fine.

894
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,829
- I gotta give you this, 
you know what you're doing.

895
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:14,097
You take care of you.

896

(ominous music)

897
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:38,254
- We're going on vacation, dear.

898
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:39,455
- Where mommy?

899
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,226
- To a foreign land, 
it will be a surprise.

900
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,228
- But I have school.

901
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:47,964
- School will be 
out in a week or so,

902
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,233
with your grades 
it won't matter.

903
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,168
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
The plaque was gone.

904
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,071
Mommy was a lot of things, 
but she wasn't a fool.

905
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,074
And it's probably 
in the river by now.

906
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,076
But what about my friends

907
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:04,080
- You'll make 
wonderful new friends.

908
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:06,415
Here.

909
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:10,520
Pack this suitcase 
with your own things.

910
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,122
- What about my stuffed animals?

911
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,292
- Pick your favorite, and 
Beth will send the rest along

912
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:18,594
after we get where we're going.

913
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:20,029
- Okay Mommy.

914
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,597
- Jessica Ann.

915
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,065
- Yes mommy.

916
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,201
- Whose your best friend?

917
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:26,435
- You are.

918
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:27,937
- Who loves you 
more than anything--

919
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:29,172
- You do.

920
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,108
(soft music)

921
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:50,560
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] I 
knew it wasn't a vacation,

922
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,562
I knew we were moving.

923
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:54,897
What could I do about it?

924
01:03:57,433 --> 01:04:01,003
Every kid knows that when 
your parents decide to move,

925
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,507
the kid has no say in it, 
you just go where they go.

926
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:08,144
(soft music)

927
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:52,455
You have to go where 
I tell you Daddy.

928
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,965
(upbeat music)

929
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:07,470
We drove for a long 
time, a couple hours.

930
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,405
Mommy looked different,

931
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:10,706
was she frightened too?

932
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:15,177
(upbeat music)

933
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:31,160
- You about ready to 
stop for the night dear?

934
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,628
- Oh could we mommy?

935
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,897
Sleeping in the car 
makes my tummy hurt.

936
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:36,966
- We'll pull into the 
next vacancy we see.

937
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:43,005
(car engine roaring)

938
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,379
(upbeat music)

939
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,284
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] 
We were on the outskirt

940
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,688
of some town, with lots 
of factories and stuff.

941
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,325
(upbeat music)

942
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:32,021
(foreboding music)

943
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:40,763
This wasn't like 
the fancy hotels

944
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,699
we usually stayed 
in on vacation,

945
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:45,434
I thought it was a little scary.

946
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:52,241
(foreboding music)

947
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:57,446
All I wanted was 
a nice soft bed.

948
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,262
- Well, this isn't 
so bad, is it?

949
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,131
- No mommy.

950
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:18,401
- All right, get 
your jammies on.

951
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,518
(upbeat music)

952
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,229
How's my angel doing?

953
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:58,334
- That's what Mark 
used to call me.

954
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:03,873
- I miss him too.

955
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:09,778
- Do you mommy?

956
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:13,649
- I'm sorry,

957
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,352
the accident happened.

958
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:21,390
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] Did 
Mommy really believe that?

959
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,360
Could she make herself 
believe that lie?

960
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,595
Or did you just wanna 
know if I believed it?

961
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:29,598
Do you miss daddy?

962
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:33,836
- I miss daddy most of all.

963
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:40,643
You probably won't have

964
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:42,912
any trouble sleeping 
tonight, will you?

965
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:46,615
- No mommy, I'm really tired.

966
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:59,461
- Do you know how 
proud I am of you?

967
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:02,698
For being such a

968
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:04,733
good student.

969
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:07,002
Such a good girl.

970
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,486
Say your prayers dear.

(soft music)

973
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:35,898
Good night daddy.

(foreboding music)

976
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:20,609
- She is a sick person, 
and she has to be stopped,

977
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:22,978
and she has to be helped.

978

(foreboding music)

979
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:47,936

to make hard decisions.

(foreboding music)

981
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,742
If they take mommy away,

982
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:57,413
who would look after you?

983
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:01,550
- [Jessica Ann Voiceover] Mommy 
was telling me these things

984
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:03,886
only because she didn't 
think I could hear them.

- Jessica Ann, open the door.

- No!

994

a nightmare.

Now open the door.

go back to sleep now.

I need my good little navigator.

1002
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,834
Open the door.

Stay.

Stay.

(screaming in pain)

1018

(foreboding music)

1021
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:56,264
- Now do you see why I'd 
never let you have a dog?

1022
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:57,466
- Mommy don't!

1023
01:18:57,966 --> 01:18:59,201
Please don't.

1024
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:03,004
- This hurts me more 
than it hurts you, dear.

1025
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:04,239
- Yes mommy.

1026
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,343
(screaming)

1027
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:23,859
- Who loves you 
more than anything

1028
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:26,027
on God's green earth?

1029
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:27,462
- You do.

- Jessica Ann get 
away from your mother.

01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:02,531
I'm gonna do the world a favor.

Come on.

- Jess.

1038
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,495
Are you all right Jess?

1039
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:34,663
- Yeah.

1040
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:36,598
- You are one brave girl.

1041
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:40,202
- Aunt Beth, what 
are you doing here?

1042
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:41,536
- Lieutenant March

1043
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:43,471
was keeping your mother 
under surveillance,

1044
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,641
he asked me to come along 
in case you needed me.

1045
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:48,043
- I'm glad.

1046
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:50,078
- It's over Jessie, it's over.

1047
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:51,980
- She couldn't do it.

1048
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:53,648
- I know honey.

1049
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:57,085
- Mommy does love me.

1050
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:58,153
(crying)

1051
01:20:59,120 --> 01:20:59,788
Mommy had done a 
lot of bad things

1052
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:04,025
but she couldn't bring herself 
to kill her little girl.

1053
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:06,061
- Why didn't you do it?

1054
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:09,297
She was the only one who could 
really testify against you.

1055
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:10,665
Why did you hesitate?

1056
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:14,135
- For a moment there,

1057
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:17,405
in the moonlight,

1058
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:21,309
