1
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,381
Your call
could not be completed.

2
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,816
Do you wanna fucking die?

3
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:02,485
Oh my God, oh my God.

4
00:02:02,564 --> 00:02:04,232
Look, look, look, look, look, look.

5
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:05,075
Clean fingers.

6
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:06,901
Yeah, you're fucking disgusting, God.

7
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:08,778
It's just a little bit of
blood, don't cry about it.

8
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:11,075
Oh a little bit of
blood on day three, okay.

9
00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:12,949
I'm the one who should be hysterical.

10
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,792
Right.

11
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:15,576
I'm a good friend.

12
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:16,419
Are you?

13
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:17,495
Yeah.

14
00:02:17,496 --> 00:02:18,666
So I'm gonna dry your tears.

15
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,756
No, do not.

16
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,458
Stop!

17
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,710
That is so fucking gross!

18
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,087
Goddamn you!

19
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:28,130
Day three, complete.

20
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:31,101
God I am calling Kristy.

21
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:41,320
Wait, seriously?

22
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,692
You're calling Kristy.

23
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:44,939
You're gonna tattle on me.

24
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,940
To Kristy.

25
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:56,706
Your call has been forwarded

26
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:59,672
to an automated voice messaging system.

27
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,748
Kristy is not available.

28
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:06,753
She's not answering.

29
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:07,878
Oh my God.

30
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:12,675
That's 'cause Kristy doesn't care.

31
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:15,595
She didn't answer
your phone call either.

32
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:16,596
Well,

33
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,764
yeah.

34
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,688
Do you think she's okay?

35
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:26,689
Kristy?

36
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,289
Do not worry about Kristy.

37
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,215
Kristy's fine.

38
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:10,353
What?

39
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:30,498
Dude.

40
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,418
You suck at your job.

41
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,589
It doesn't exist.

42
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,638
This house doesn't exist.

43
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:52,945
Penis!

44
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
Goddammit!

45
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:05,034
When are you gonna get
your own mailman truck?

46
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:08,913
I don't know, not till
I'm full time I guess.

47
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,167
Wait, they don't trust you,

48
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:16,170
with a mail man truck?

49
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:18,295
Son of a bitch.

50
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:20,640
It literally does not exist on my phone.

51
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:21,924
Dude, I give up.

52
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:23,802
This is ridiculous.

53
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:24,928
Let me see.

54
00:07:35,397 --> 00:07:37,115
What are you doing?

55
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,654
Why?

56
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:46,156
The house doesn't exist.

57
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:48,376
The letter doesn't exist.

58
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:50,202
Food exists.

59
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,203
Let's go eat...

60
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,920
Oh shit dude.

61
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:01,138
1289.

62
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:03,049
It does exist.

63
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,354
Oh my gosh, that really hurt.

64
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:12,149
You know what Pete?

65
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,268
Thank you man.

66
00:08:18,023 --> 00:08:20,065
You actually helped me out with that one.

67
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:20,817
Let's go.

68
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,359
There's your stuff.

69
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Let's do it.

70
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,530
I gotta pee.

71
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,127
All right, well hurry up.

72
00:08:31,703 --> 00:08:34,371
You know I said I gotta pee?

73
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:35,212
Yes?

74
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:36,207
I lied.

75
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,207
Why?

76
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,476
Just pick me up on the way back!

77
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:47,640
What, dude!

78
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:49,395

79
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,973
What the hell man!

80
00:08:52,974 --> 00:08:55,601
Don't forget about me!

81
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:56,728

Kristy?

90
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,163
Is there a Kristy Jordan here?

91
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,613
Kristy?

92
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:47,266

00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,431
Is he dead?

120
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,819
Hi.

121
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,077
Where am I?

122
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,617
Why are there so many
creepy fucks out there today?

123
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:01,460
I don't know.

124
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,999
Do you live here?

125
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:05,580
Are you Kristy?

126
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:06,626
What do you know about Kristy?

127
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:07,420
What?

128
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,376
Kristy!

129
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:09,626
You're not Kristy?

130
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:10,467
Are you Kristy?

131
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:11,468
No.

132
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,381
Then who are you?

133
00:21:14,382 --> 00:21:15,725
Who are you?

134
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,634
I'm the mailman.

135
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:21,515
What are you doing all the way out here?

136
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:23,019
Delivering the mail?

137
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:24,476
Don't be an ass!

138
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:28,275
I don't like him.

139
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,022
I don't like him either.

140
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,240
What the fuck?

141
00:21:32,316 --> 00:21:35,276
Oh shit!

142
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:39,246

What the fuck!

146
00:21:41,703 --> 00:21:42,703
Did you see his face?

147
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:45,912
Oh wow.

148
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:48,420
I literally pissed my pants.

149
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:54,129
Holy shit!

00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:57,006
You fuckin' pissed yourself!

151
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:50,442
This is a
cellular telephone mailbox.

152
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:51,443
Fuck!

153
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:24,260
Fuck!

154
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:38,733
Oh shit.

155
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:40,276
That was not easy.

156
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:41,517
That's not as easy as it looks.

157
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:48,576
Well done.

158
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:51,296
Yeah, you should the three way.

159
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:53,420
There's a three way?

160
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:56,000
Wait, where the fuck is Kristy?

161
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,799
I don't know.

162
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,388
I'm gonna call her.

163
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:02,973
Oh shit, can I use your
phone real quick first please?

164
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,217
Why, are you trying to get away from us?

165
00:24:04,218 --> 00:24:06,516
No no no no, I just left my
friend on the side of the road

166
00:24:06,517 --> 00:24:08,054
like a freakin' idiot.

167
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,935
He's probably flipping
out wondering where I am.

168
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,062
Oh my God,

169
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:16,939
What?

170
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,565
Green jacket, beanie,
beard, little penis?

171
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:19,649
Yeah, you've seen him?

172
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:36,059
Hey, oh,

173
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:38,269

175
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:43,405
Stay right there, I'm
gonna get your friends.

176
00:25:43,406 --> 00:25:44,947
I'm gonna get help.

177
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,577
I'm so sorry.

00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:14,732
So you're like, like a real mailman?

179
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:17,350
Like a real live mailman?

180
00:26:17,351 --> 00:26:18,193
Yeah.

181
00:26:18,194 --> 00:26:21,109
That like takes my and
then puts it in the box,

182
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:22,939
and then drives away in the truck.

183
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,399
Yeah, basically.

184
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,650
That is so cool.

185
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:26,651
Thank you.

186
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,784
Someone drank way too much.

187
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:37,620
Oh no, it's shark week.

188
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:38,955
It's what?

189
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:40,248
Shark week.

190
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:42,926
That's cool.

191
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:44,210
Day four.

192
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:45,211
The revenge.

193
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:01,477
She has the ugliest
vomit face in the world.

194
00:27:01,478 --> 00:27:02,478
Yeah she really does.

195
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:03,401
I know, oh my God.

196
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:05,273
That's really disgusting.

197
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:11,113
Oh God.

198
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,196
Hey-

199
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:15,533
I'm wet.

200
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:26,627
Hey, Ashley, you're probably confused

201
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:29,380
that this isn't Kristy's voice
talking to you right now,

202
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:33,682
but the reason I'm calling
you with her phone is

203
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:35,263
I'm with her right now,

204
00:27:35,264 --> 00:27:38,639
and I don't know where we are exactly,

205
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,062
but yeah, Kristy,

206
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:44,609
she's alive but she's not moving.

207
00:27:46,023 --> 00:27:46,819
I don't know what happened,

208
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,035
but I'll let you know as soon as I can.

209
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:59,162
Just call me back, please.

210
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:05,376
Oh, and I'm Pete.

211
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:10,801
Also I think you're the girls who saw me

212
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:13,677
in the woods a few hours ago, so...

213
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,263
I hope you enjoyed the show.

214
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:20,641
Call me, just, call me.

215
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:23,518
Goddammit.

216
00:28:26,396 --> 00:28:27,522
Kristy holy...

217
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:31,859
Fuck!

218
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,860
Fuck, on...

219
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:38,032
Dammit!

220
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:40,368
Shit!

221
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,635
Fuck it.

222
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:58,601
We're gonna do it right here.

223
00:28:58,602 --> 00:28:59,391
Right here?

224
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,222
Yeah.

225
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,147
Okay.

226
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:03,099
Go get my sleeping bag.

227
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,818
It's there in...

228
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:05,733
Yeah, right.

229
00:29:05,734 --> 00:29:06,774
Yeah, yeah by the fire, yeah.

230
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:09,397
And then your beer, 'cause we need that.

231
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:10,565
Of course, okay.

232
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:11,607
Sleeping bag and beer.

233
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:12,450
Yes, then we're gonna

234
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,569
just fuck.
- Two things, okay.

235
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,412
Okay.

236
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:16,654
And you're gonna hurry.

237
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:17,495
'Cause we need those things.

238
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:18,329
Obviously, yeah.

239
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,163
So beer and sleeping bag.

240
00:29:19,164 --> 00:29:19,998
Yeah.

241
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:20,786
Okay.

242
00:29:20,787 --> 00:29:21,660
And then we're gonna fuck <i>so...</i>

243
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:23,537
Awesome, yep.

244
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,086
Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey!

245
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:33,007
That's mine.

246
00:29:33,008 --> 00:29:33,799
Oh.

247
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,639
Oh shit.

248
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,349
I'm sorry about that.

249
00:29:43,223 --> 00:29:44,223
Oh!

250
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:47,277
They're both mine.

251
00:29:49,563 --> 00:29:51,281
Could I borrow one?

252
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:01,951
Shut the fuck up!

253
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:05,161
James!

254
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:06,454
Hurry UP!

255
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:09,373
Okay look, I will owe you so much.

256
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,718
Just please, just one
of 'em, doesn't matter.

257
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:14,003
James!

258
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:14,798
Please,

259
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,761
I promise, I have to pee!

260
00:30:15,762 --> 00:30:16,757
I'll owe you.

261
00:30:16,757 --> 00:30:17,757
Please?

262
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:20,433
Okay yeah.

263
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:21,267
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

264
00:30:21,268 --> 00:30:22,137
Fine, whatever.

265
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,013
Fuck yes, okay, thank you.

266
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:24,313
Oh but, James.

267
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:27,725
What?

268
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,648
There's something you
should know about Lyndsey.

269
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:34,649
James!

270
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,736
She's a virgin.

271
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:40,578
No.

272
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:41,579
Virgin.

273
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,660
What?
Virgin.

274
00:30:47,454 --> 00:30:49,205
James!

275
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:50,206
Fuck.

276
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:54,128
Who the fuck is that?

277
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:00,925
That a girl?

278
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,521
Oh, is that a naked girl?

279
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,018
Oh shit, I don't have my phone.

280
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:08,437
Someone take a picture for me.

281
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:10,935
Oh.

282
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:13,813
Kristy called me.

283
00:31:13,814 --> 00:31:14,656
What'd she say?

284
00:31:14,657 --> 00:31:15,900
Did she leave a message?

285
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:18,027
I don't know I'm gonna find out.

286
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,454
What the hell is she doing?

287
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,660
Hey!

288
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:31,998
You can come join us if you want!

289
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:33,582
Right?

290
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:35,334
Do you need help?

291
00:31:35,335 --> 00:31:36,335
'Cause...

292
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:38,797
Lyndsey.

293
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,010
There's a canoe if you
think that, if you...

294
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:45,386
What the fuck is wrong with her?

295
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:46,980
Lyndsey.

296
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:48,352
What?

297
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:49,604
What'd she say?

298
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,023
Hey, Ashley,

299
00:31:53,103 --> 00:31:54,070
you're probably confused

300
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:56,531
that this isn't Kristy's voice
talking to you right now,

301
00:31:56,532 --> 00:32:00,526
but the reasons I'm calling
you with her phone is

302
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:01,619
I'm with her right now,

303
00:32:01,695 --> 00:32:04,280
and I don't know where we are exactly,

304
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:05,121
but...

305
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:06,116
I think that's Pete.

306
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:07,914
Yeah, Kristy,

307
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:11,622
she's alive but she's not moving.

308
00:32:12,873 --> 00:32:13,669
I don't know what happened,

309
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,417
but I'll let you know as soon as I can.

310
00:32:16,418 --> 00:32:18,512
Just call me back, please.

311
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,515
Oh, and I'm Pete.

312
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:23,466
Fuck.

313
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:27,187
Also I think
you're the girls who saw me

314
00:32:27,188 --> 00:32:29,972
in the woods a few hours ago, so...

315
00:32:29,973 --> 00:32:31,441
I hope you enjoyed the show.

316
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:35,612
Call me, just, call me.

317
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:39,398
Hope you enjoyed the...

318
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:40,651
Oh shit I'm sorry.

319
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:42,943
I'm sorry it's just that's fucking funny.

320
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:43,786
No, yeah, okay.

321
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:45,497
Let's find your friend.

322
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:46,739
Let's do that.

323
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,157
Knock that out.

324
00:32:48,158 --> 00:32:50,284
Then we can find Pete.

325
00:32:50,285 --> 00:32:52,161
Whose dick is not funny.

326
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:54,585
His dick is not funny at all.

327
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:55,664
'Cause it's a dick.

328
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,541
I think you should call
an ambulance or something.

329
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm already on it.

330
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,627
And AAA too.

331
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:42,628
On it.

332
00:33:43,713 --> 00:33:45,807
Look at you reading my mind.

333
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,597
Look at you suggesting not even remotely

334
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:50,261
obvious at all suggestions.

335
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,980
I'm good like that.

336
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,789
Yes, it's 1289 Timmy Creek Road.

337
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,950
Thank you.

338
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:17,541
They said they'll be 25 minutes.

339
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:18,882
So they'll be here in an hour.

340
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,040
If we're lucky.

341
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:22,173
Great.

342
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:24,295
I have two bottles

343
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:27,298
of whiskey in my glove compartment.

344
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:28,221
You serious?

345
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,176
Yeah, unless you wanted

346
00:34:29,177 --> 00:34:31,051
to go back over to Lyndsey?

347
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:32,516
Why would I wanna do that?

348
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:33,809
She's all the way over there.

349
00:34:51,907 --> 00:34:52,907
Ashley!

350
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:56,495
There's six weeks.

351
00:34:59,122 --> 00:35:01,749
James!

352
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,375
Yeah, why not?

353
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:04,962
What?

354
00:35:05,045 --> 00:35:06,797
Why not? She won't care.

355
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:42,122
No way.

356
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:47,804
There's something wrong with her.

357
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,340
She's standing right in front of us.

358
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:52,593
Completely nude.

359
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,096
There's nothing wrong about that.

360
00:35:57,097 --> 00:35:59,020
I'm serious.

361
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:02,649
Hey guys, I'm really
drunk right now, but,

362
00:36:05,105 --> 00:36:06,698
why is Kristy naked?

363
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:26,667
Get away from her!

364
00:36:26,668 --> 00:36:27,508
Ashley?

365
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:28,378
Yes?

366
00:36:28,379 --> 00:36:30,176
What are we gonna do?

367
00:36:30,177 --> 00:36:31,343
I don't know!

368
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,052
Get Lyndsey inside!

369
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:38,726
Break the lock if you have to!

370
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:40,807
What are you gonna do?

371
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,059
I'll be there in a minute just hurry up!

372
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,563
And don't let anything happen to Lyndsey!

373
00:36:47,564 --> 00:36:48,440
Please don't worry,

374
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:50,901
I'm not gonna fuck him anymore!

375
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:06,792
I wasn't going to fuck you.

376
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:07,883
Yeah you were.

377
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,630
I don't want your first
time to be in a sleeping bag.

378
00:37:09,631 --> 00:37:10,468
You kidding me?

379
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:11,469
What?

380
00:37:12,672 --> 00:37:15,424
Did she tell you I'm a virgin?

381
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:18,302
Did you tell him I'm a virgin!

382
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:20,638
Are you saying you're not a virgin?

383
00:37:28,063 --> 00:37:29,360
Wait, so you're not a virgin?

384
00:37:52,754 --> 00:37:54,755
What the fuck James?

385
00:37:54,756 --> 00:37:57,009
It's sturdier than it looks!

386
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:58,469
Break the glass!

387
00:38:01,388 --> 00:38:04,016
Yeah I was gonna do that next!

388
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:17,278
You're gonna stay right there.

389
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,614
Sit right there.

390
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,752
Break the glass.

391
00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:31,125
Break the glass.

392
00:38:31,126 --> 00:38:32,628
Piece of shit.

393
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:35,421
I'll break your fuckin' ass right now.

394
00:38:35,422 --> 00:38:36,422
Bitch.

395
00:38:41,678 --> 00:38:42,678
Fuck!

396
00:38:43,638 --> 00:38:44,638
Ow.

397
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,182
That seriously hurt!

398
00:38:47,183 --> 00:38:48,105
Seriously.

399
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:49,694
Seriously!

400
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:50,769
Seriously?

401
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:55,613
Looks like you could,
use a little bit of help.

402
00:38:55,614 --> 00:38:57,360
This glass is too thick.

403
00:38:57,444 --> 00:39:00,197
Look, I think we should stay here.

404
00:39:01,156 --> 00:39:04,199
I really think we should go inside.

405
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,784
You got this!

406
00:39:05,785 --> 00:39:06,785
I know.

407
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:19,339
Door please?

408
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,430
Oh my God!

409
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,976
How long have you been standing there?

410
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:32,069
Mister Kristy?

411
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:34,938
Ow, what the hell?

412
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:39,946
Oh, you're a fucking creepy ass old man!

413
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:42,404
Lyndsey!

414
00:39:42,405 --> 00:39:43,247
What?

415
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,406
He is.

416
00:39:44,407 --> 00:39:47,034
It's Kristy's grandpa.

417
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:48,535
No it's not.

418
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:50,120
What?

419
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:56,382
Who are you old geezer?

420
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:58,258
Do you think we could figure out

421
00:39:58,338 --> 00:40:01,012
this grandpa not grandpa
shit inside please?

422
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:02,216
Let's go.

423
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:03,434
Open the door!

424
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,807
Philip!

425
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,973
What the fuck!

426
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:10,974

427
00:40:15,522 --> 00:40:16,523

434
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:34,206
Okay.

435
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:39,419
Shit, okay.

436
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:47,177
Okay.

437
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:52,266
Ashley!

438
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:54,810
Lyndsey!

439
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,979
Lyndsey!

440
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:04,620
Lyndsey!

441
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,953
No! Lyndsey!

442
00:41:15,415 --> 00:41:16,415
This way!

443
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,926
Move your ass!

444
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:51,792
Barricade the fucking door.

445
00:41:51,868 --> 00:41:52,868
No!

446
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:55,579
Philip.

447
00:42:06,341 --> 00:42:07,763
What the fuck?

448
00:42:07,764 --> 00:42:10,103
What the fuck is he doing?

449
00:42:12,472 --> 00:42:13,894
Don't mind him.

450
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:21,777
She's not coming in here.

451
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:36,954
See.

452
00:42:42,752 --> 00:42:45,471
The fuck is going on here?

453
00:42:45,546 --> 00:42:47,014
Who are you?

454
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,090
And what

455
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
is that?

456
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:53,938
Excuse me children.

457
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:55,640
You son of a bitch!

458
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:02,104
I's afraid we have some
unfinished bidness here.

459
00:43:02,105 --> 00:43:04,439
It's gonna require your help.

460
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,857
I don't think so.

461
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:06,858
I do.

462
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:09,236
<i>Boy.</i>

463
00:43:09,237 --> 00:43:10,278
Children.

464
00:43:16,077 --> 00:43:18,000
Uh uh uh uh uh, not you.

465
00:43:19,038 --> 00:43:21,581
You stay right where you is.

466
00:43:21,582 --> 00:43:23,208
Unfortunately for the both of us

467
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:27,087
my family here gonna have
to require your presence

468
00:43:27,088 --> 00:43:29,131
just a little longer.

469
00:43:29,132 --> 00:43:32,926
Til we get this thing fixed up right.

470
00:43:32,927 --> 00:43:34,349
Who are you?

471
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:36,181
Now what do we have here?

472
00:43:36,264 --> 00:43:37,436
And who is she?

473
00:43:39,892 --> 00:43:41,986
Don't worry, I'll tell ya.

474
00:43:43,896 --> 00:43:44,896
I'm Francis.

475
00:43:48,109 --> 00:43:50,362
That's Philip, and Felicity.

476
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,406
And that there,

477
00:43:54,407 --> 00:43:57,377
that's my sweet little reborn bride.

478
00:44:13,009 --> 00:44:15,343
Why does she look like Kristy?

479
00:44:15,344 --> 00:44:16,812
What the fuck did you do to her?

480
00:44:16,813 --> 00:44:19,603
Don't make no sudden moves girl.

481
00:44:21,434 --> 00:44:23,107
We's all in this now.

482
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,739
Whether you like it or not.

483
00:44:31,277 --> 00:44:32,277
Daddy?

484
00:44:33,154 --> 00:44:35,906
Are they gonna die tonight?

485
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:38,205
Take the sample Felicity.

486
00:44:38,284 --> 00:44:42,380
You don't need to be concerning
yourself with this now.

487
00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:46,088
Hell no, no fucking samples.

488
00:44:46,089 --> 00:44:47,209
You're not touching me.

489
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,210
Or her.

490
00:44:50,129 --> 00:44:52,464
They already got you boy.

491
00:44:52,465 --> 00:44:53,465
What?

492
00:44:57,887 --> 00:44:59,013
What the fuck?

493
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:03,767
You mother fuckers.

494
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:06,686
No need for that tone boy.

495
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:10,237
Lest you want a bullet
tween your eyeballs.

496
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:18,198
Or maybe you want a bullet
tween your nether parts?

497
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:19,199
Ah fuck.

498
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:20,789
Fuck come on.

499
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:22,577
Okay, okay.

500
00:45:22,578 --> 00:45:25,288
That's what I thought.

501
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,131
Stop.

502
00:45:26,132 --> 00:45:28,917
Lord God Almighty, goddamn girl.

503
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:30,670
You're taking all day.

504
00:45:32,588 --> 00:45:34,682
Won't you just do like the

505
00:45:35,716 --> 00:45:36,716
real men do?

506
00:45:38,177 --> 00:45:39,770
Put it in and screw.

507
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:46,768
What are we gonna do?

508
00:45:46,769 --> 00:45:48,145
What are we gonna fucking do?

509
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:49,363
I don't know.

510
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:54,109
Daddy.

511
00:45:55,111 --> 00:45:58,115
They're not gonna die tonight, right?

512
00:46:00,575 --> 00:46:02,452
I told you, Felicity.

513
00:46:04,537 --> 00:46:08,081
You don't have to concern yourself

514
00:46:08,082 --> 00:46:10,301
with these things Felicity.

515
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:14,339
Are ya fucking deaf?

516
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,339
Huh?

517
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,341
Philip!

518
00:46:20,136 --> 00:46:21,136
Philip!

519
00:46:23,139 --> 00:46:24,139
Philip!

520
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,497
You don't have to do this.

521
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:47,204
Yes ya do.

522
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:13,360
What the fuck!

523
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:19,069
What the hell are you
people doing in there?

524
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,740
Want me to tell 'em?

525
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:25,414
Prepare the altar.

526
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:31,625
Didn't you say you was gonna tell 'em?

527
00:47:31,707 --> 00:47:32,707
I lied.

528
00:47:36,462 --> 00:47:38,590
Don't you do nothin' girl.

529
00:47:39,507 --> 00:47:41,635
You got what you needed from us.

530
00:47:41,636 --> 00:47:43,636
Just please let us go.

531
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:44,719
Felicity.

532
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,680
The blood.

533
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,523
Philip, take her to the altar.

534
00:47:54,897 --> 00:47:55,648
No, no, no.

535
00:47:55,731 --> 00:47:58,029
No no no, no no no!

536
00:47:58,109 --> 00:47:59,276
No!

537
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:03,407
Goddamn you insane family
of Satan worshiping cunts!

538
00:48:06,492 --> 00:48:08,711
Ah, James?

539
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:10,003
Burn in Hell!

540
00:48:21,007 --> 00:48:23,226
You stupid ignorant fool.

541
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:27,762
I got what I needed from you,

542
00:48:27,763 --> 00:48:31,484
and now, now I'm gon'
complete the summonin'.

543
00:48:33,227 --> 00:48:35,353
You hear that baby?

544
00:48:35,354 --> 00:48:38,064
You just hold on one more minute.

545
00:48:38,065 --> 00:48:40,817
Hold on one minute longer.

546
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:41,818
No!

547
00:48:44,572 --> 00:48:46,495
Oh goddammit Felicity!

548
00:48:48,284 --> 00:48:50,958
This ain't how you said
it was gonna be Daddy.

549
00:48:51,037 --> 00:48:53,079
That ain't Momma.

550
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,914
I know it ain't!

551
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:56,132
It's all wrong!

552
00:48:57,126 --> 00:48:59,127
This whole thing's all wrong.

553
00:49:04,258 --> 00:49:05,430
I know it is.

554
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,729
It all just went all wrong.

555
00:49:10,264 --> 00:49:11,766
But we gon' fix it.

556
00:49:13,726 --> 00:49:15,023
I'm gon' fix it.

557
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,700
My baby's finally coming back to me.

558
00:49:23,402 --> 00:49:24,402
Philip.

559
00:49:27,573 --> 00:49:28,573
Philip.

560
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:34,089
Won't you bring Momma
on in here with us son.

561
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:37,791
Go.

562
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:51,429
Felicity.

563
00:49:54,016 --> 00:49:57,691
You remember when I
said, I was gon' bring us

564
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,198
all back together again?

565
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:03,775
Yeah.

566
00:50:03,776 --> 00:50:05,369
You remember when I said that,

567
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:08,696
I said no matter what the cost?

568
00:50:08,697 --> 00:50:11,032
No matter what the cost,

569
00:50:11,033 --> 00:50:13,502
you remember when I said that?

570
00:50:15,037 --> 00:50:17,085
Now what'd you say to me?

571
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:20,750

572
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:21,751
thank you.

573
00:50:26,048 --> 00:50:28,972
Say it for me, one more time baby.

574
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:32,433
I wanna hear it one last time.

575
00:50:37,518 --> 00:50:39,310
Thank you Daddy.

576
00:50:39,311 --> 00:50:41,530
That's my sweet Felicity.

577
00:50:46,235 --> 00:50:48,158
No matter what the cost.

578
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,628
No matter what the cost.

579
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:10,677
I'm a real sumbitch Dad.

580
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:14,518
Don't you dare disrespect your...

581
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:34,662
Thank you Philip.

582
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:51,804
What do we do now?

583
00:52:12,321 --> 00:52:14,369
Y'all know how to read?

584
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:19,786
Yeah.

585
00:52:19,787 --> 00:52:20,629
You do?

586
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,294
Okay, all right now.

587
00:52:23,624 --> 00:52:24,624
Good.

588
00:52:25,459 --> 00:52:27,460
There you are.

589
00:52:27,461 --> 00:52:28,461

590
00:52:36,262 --> 00:52:37,354

591
00:52:42,518 --> 00:52:44,102
Philip?

592
00:52:44,103 --> 00:52:48,074
Grab that chalice and
freshen up this pentagram.

593
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:51,401
Oh and Philip?

594
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:53,404
Hand me one of them guns.

595
00:53:00,327 --> 00:53:01,327

596
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:12,255
Read!

597
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:15,221
What are we supposed to be looking for?

598
00:53:15,222 --> 00:53:23,068
Banishment, banishment,
banishment, banishment.

599
00:53:24,518 --> 00:53:26,566
Banishment, apparently.

600
00:53:33,152 --> 00:53:36,281
Felicity none of this is in English.

601
00:53:40,075 --> 00:53:43,625
Banishment,
banishment, banishment, banishment.

602
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:44,704
Felicity!

603
00:53:46,248 --> 00:53:48,467
None of this is in English.

604
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:00,803
The fuck?

605
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,813
Banishment, banishment, banishment.

606
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:25,583
Shit!

607
00:55:00,614 --> 00:55:01,614
Hey guys?

608
00:55:02,574 --> 00:55:04,542
Think I found something.

609
00:55:05,577 --> 00:55:07,295
Fuck yeah I found it!

610
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:15,179
By the unholy name, I banish thee.

611
00:55:16,255 --> 00:55:18,974
From the grasp of the roots that choke,

612
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,759
by the name of the she-goat of the womb,

613
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,387
and by the blood of the son
of the lamb of the flood,

614
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:25,514
Yes. yes, yes!

615
00:55:26,765 --> 00:55:27,765
All right.

616
00:55:33,939 --> 00:55:35,816
I think I might need a band-aid.

617
00:55:40,946 --> 00:55:42,323
Classic Philip.

618
00:55:59,798 --> 00:56:00,798
Are...

619
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:04,057
Either of you virgins?

620
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,095
What?

621
00:56:06,889 --> 00:56:07,889
No.

622
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:10,349
No, no.

623
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:11,941
No, I'm not.

624
00:56:11,942 --> 00:56:12,942
I'm not a virgin.

625
00:56:12,978 --> 00:56:14,145
Okay.

626
00:56:14,146 --> 00:56:15,146
Well shoot.

627
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,407
A ton of girls.

628
00:56:26,408 --> 00:56:27,784
Give you a list.

629
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:29,958
Give you a list right now.

630
00:57:02,444 --> 00:57:03,444
Ashley.

631
00:57:04,446 --> 00:57:07,416
You're a very special, special girl.

632
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:13,788
Three and three, come to thee.

633
00:57:13,789 --> 00:57:16,707
Drink and the end shall come to he.

634
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:19,131
But tonight, it comes to she.

635
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:24,382
I'll have to improvise a bit but,

636
00:57:24,383 --> 00:57:26,886
I reckon I can make this work.

637
00:57:27,886 --> 00:57:28,928
Philip?

638
00:57:28,929 --> 00:57:32,103
I've got some very special news for ya.

639
00:57:33,058 --> 00:57:34,058
Philip?

640
00:57:36,895 --> 00:57:37,895

641
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:40,940

00:57:54,162 --> 00:57:55,162

643
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,540

644
00:57:58,792 --> 00:57:59,792

645
00:58:07,134 --> 00:58:08,801
No no no no no, shit!

646
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:58,144
You was a real good son of a bitch.

647
00:58:59,227 --> 00:59:02,447
May he have mercy on your goddamn soul.

648
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:11,113
Okay, we're gon' have to move fast.

649
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:13,157
I mean real fast.

650
00:59:13,158 --> 00:59:15,660
I think with little bit Of luck,

651
00:59:15,661 --> 00:59:18,412
and if we follow these instructions,

652
00:59:18,413 --> 00:59:20,211
we can make it outta here.

653
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,290
Alive.

654
00:59:22,417 --> 00:59:24,293
You understand me?

655
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:25,341

00:59:26,672 --> 00:59:27,798
Oh shoot, no you don't.

657
00:59:27,881 --> 00:59:29,258
Exactly as I say.

658
00:59:30,217 --> 00:59:31,594
Exactly.

659
00:59:31,677 --> 00:59:34,271
Else we ain't gonna like the results.

660
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:43,562
Fuck.

661
00:59:44,356 --> 00:59:46,700

676
01:01:08,815 --> 01:01:09,982
What the fuck?

677
01:01:09,983 --> 01:01:11,197

01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:46,997
That's not normal.

706
01:02:48,707 --> 01:02:50,050
That's fucking unnatural.

707
01:02:57,048 --> 01:02:58,300
You done good.

Only one remains.

711
01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:23,701
Drop your pants.

712
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:26,959
What?

713
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,747

01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:37,597
Stop dickin' around, hurry up now!

716
01:03:37,598 --> 01:03:39,089
Just do what she says!

717
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:39,807
Okay!

718
01:03:39,925 --> 01:03:40,925
Fuck!

719
01:04:12,707 --> 01:04:13,749
Oh shit.

720
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,209
Six seconds!

721
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,210
I'm sorry.

722
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,588
Impressive.

723
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:20,966
Fuck I'm sorry.

724
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,097
It's okay, just

725
01:04:28,807 --> 01:04:32,983
thought my first time was gonna
be a little bit different.

726
01:04:39,317 --> 01:04:40,910
What do we do now?

727
01:05:05,385 --> 01:05:06,385
That's it.

728
01:05:08,096 --> 01:05:10,519
You gotta do exactly as I say.

729
01:05:13,685 --> 01:05:14,685
Yeah.

730
01:05:15,937 --> 01:05:17,939
All right, let's begin.

731
01:06:24,339 --> 01:06:25,591
What the hell?

732
01:06:36,351 --> 01:06:37,351
Fuck!

733
01:06:38,978 --> 01:06:40,821

01:06:40,897 --> 01:06:43,023
This better fucking work!

735
01:06:43,024 --> 01:06:45,025
The time is come!

736
01:06:45,026 --> 01:06:46,403
Dammit!

737
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,709
For my daughter, we bestow praise.

738
01:06:54,285 --> 01:06:55,327
Shit!

739
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,080

Fuck!

743
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:14,935
From a sister we bestow
everlasting damnation.

744
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:17,599
Wait.

745
01:07:36,035 --> 01:07:37,035
Come on.

746
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,580
Get it down.

747
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,634
Done good Ashley.

748
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:54,182
You done real good.

749
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:00,809
What?

750
01:08:02,479 --> 01:08:06,607
From the brother we
relinquish the unclaimed souls,

751
01:08:06,608 --> 01:08:08,861
the inferno whence she came.

752
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:13,030
Drink it!

753
01:08:14,407 --> 01:08:16,284
Just drink it dammit!

754
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,412
Just fucking do it!

755
01:09:03,248 --> 01:09:06,092
Swallow it!

756
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,044
Swallow it James.

757
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:10,045
Swallow it.

758
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:15,759
Baby I need you to swallow this right now.

759
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,221
Baby, baby, baby, I
need you to swallow it.

760
01:09:19,222 --> 01:09:23,272
All right, else this
banishment will come undone.

761
01:09:29,524 --> 01:09:30,899
Swallow it!

762
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,734
