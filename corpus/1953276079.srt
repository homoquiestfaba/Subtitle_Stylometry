00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,204
Once again, my lovely wife is very busy preparing the meal today.

3
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:55,804
My wife has never slacked on cooking.

4
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,347
It's a bit extravagant, isn't it?

5
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,257
Why do you ask?

6
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:10,560
If you love, this is what happens.
[Shotgun Love]

7
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,442
It's hot, it's hot. Eat slowly.

8
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,505
That's right.

9
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:27,714
Slowly, yeah.

10
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,612
Ah~

11
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,311
Is it good?

12
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:51,234
How was that? Yes, how would you like to have this pork on your table for dinner tonight?

13
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,372
We will leave now.

14
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,540
We sincerely thank those of you that have been with us.

15
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,274
Cut! Okay.

16
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
Good work.

17
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,473
Good work!

18
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,416
Good work, good work.

19
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,475
You all worked hard.

20
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,482
Yes, you worked hard.

21
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,355
PD Park, good work.

22
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,290
Today's sales have reached 94%! It's a  huge hit.

23
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,489
How can you eat someone else's meat so realistically well?

24
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,365
-You did well in casting them.
-Ah, yes, thank you.

25
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,794
Your shoe is untied. Look at me.

26
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,528
-Good work!
-Yes.

27
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:28,129
Give me two of them.

28
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,305
Ah, okay. Good work.

29
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,238
Good job.

30
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,539
Let's put your shoes on.

31
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,540
Wow...

32
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,319
She's more charming by the day.

33
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,513
I have to get married to that kind of a woman...

34
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,395
That's why you should chew slowly.

35
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,567
Ah, I can't see...

36
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,506
Hey! Pierce this.

37
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,405
-Me?
-Yeah.

38
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:20,806
Ah. Uh..

39
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:22,407
Ahh!!

40
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,293
Ah really.

41
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,229
Let me see. Ah...

42
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,463
I told you to pierce her hand, but you gave her a shot. A shot!

43
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,364
Do you already have ulnar nerve palsy? You're so young.

44
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,378
If you meet a man, avoid those with ulnar nerve palsy.

45
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,446
He'll have paralysis before he turns 40.

46
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,476
I don't have ulnar nerve palsy.

47
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:44,477
Ow it hurts..

48
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,511
I'm just shivering because it's cold.

49
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,422
What am I supposed to do if you call now, all of a sudden, and say you can't come?? Huh?

50
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,921
Ah hello... hello?

51
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,493
Hyung, I'm leaving first.

52
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,394
Okay. I have to do one more seasoned mackerel.

53
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,398
Ah, right. Hey, do this mackerel before you leave.

54
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,598
-The other guy said he couldn't come in...

55
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:10,599
-Ah, I can't do mackerel.

56
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,903
I'm allergic to mackerel and my skin reacts badly.

57
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,507
Ah, what do I do about this? PD Park is going to bitch...

58
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:20,308
Oh Hello!

59
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,762
She has a killer body, doesn't she?

60
00:05:25,863 --> 00:05:28,863
With that body, she ate meat before, and now she's going to do seasoned mackerel again.

61
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:30,564
It's really fascinating.

62
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,922
When does it start? The seasoned mackerel?
Does it start right now? I'll do the mackerel.

63
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,460
Didn't you say you were allergic to mackerel?

64
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,291
It's okay, I can endure it.

65
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,461
How do you endure an allergic reaction?

66
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,272
I can bear it!

67
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,271
I've held diarrhea in and turned it into constipation!

68
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,500
I can hold it in. It starts now, right? Where?

69
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,370
That's it! Hey, hey, hey...

70
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:52,282
-Yes, there is no deal like today's.
-Yes, that is true. Please do not be surprised.

71
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,252
If you purchase this while this show is airing,

72
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,322
We will give you an extra 10 packs.

73
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,958
Then, that means it's 40 packs. I don't know if you could eat all of this.

74
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:06,159
-It's packaged like this, so you can store them in your refrigerator.

75
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:06,727
-Yes.

76
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,326
These seasoned mackerel are really big and succulent, aren't they?

77
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:12,427
So big and succulent.

78
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,400
How plump are those? When mothers look at these,

79
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:22,242
They ask if the fish are Yankee Mackerel. These are Korean Mackerel.

80
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:23,543
Yankee Mackerel. You are so funny.

81
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,281
Yes, because they are so large and succulent.

82
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:27,482
-Please give us a call right away. -Yes.

83
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:29,983
Ah~

84
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:30,984
AHH!!!

85
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,355
What's with him? What's wrong with his face?

86
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,198
Change to camera number 2. Hurry!

87
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,336
Hey, Host! Host!

88
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:50,432
Yes, everyone! Our Ahn Dong Mackerel are so delicious

89
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,237
that our model has grown happy flowers on his face.

90
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:59,340
-Yes he has. That is how delicious these are.
-Yes, right, right, right..

91
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,052
That could happen if you get an endorphin rush.

92
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:06,053
-Please make an automatic order.
-Yes.

93
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:06,448
-Also
-Yes?

94
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,324
We'd like for you to call again for our second round.

95
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,489
-Please order~
-Yes. Please order now.

96
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,394
Those Ahjusshis always trying to keep the change when they come into the neighborhood.

97
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,503
Myung Boo~

98
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,472
Hey, what's wrong with your face? Do you have the measles?

99
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,374
Ah, don't ask me. Why are there so many annoying things happening today?

100
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,444
Why'd you call me?

101
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,416
Umm, Myung Boo...

102
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,451
Myung Boo~

103
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,259
I can't.

104
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,489
What can't you do?? You haven't even heard what I'm going to say.

105
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,397
You're asking me to lend you money again. Didn't you say you were going to pay me back as soon as you got paid?

106
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,397
If I don't pay you back this month, I'll cut my finger off.

107
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,500
Then, go cut it off first.

108
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,274
In the kitchen.

109
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:06,508
Ah Myung Boo, why are you acting like this? Myung Boo...

110
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,422
I'm begging you.

111
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,519
Myung Boo~

112
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,419
It's raining, the weather is accurate.

113
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,392
Go on.

114
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,258
Hey Sang Yeol,

115
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,431
Can you walk me to the bus stop?

116
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,310
Ah, it's only drizzling rain. You can run.

117
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,280
Jeez, I really can't understand you.

118
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,412
If I caught you, I would really...

119
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:46,357
Ah, why are you being so creepy?

120
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,454
Because you keep pushing me out from under the umbrella. You're only covering yourself.

121
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,356
When did I push you out? When did I only cover myself?

122
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:54,357
How can you say such things... Ah what is this smell??

123
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,392
Ahh! Really!

124
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,862
When was the last time you washed your hair?

125
00:08:59,305 --> 00:08:59,774
Tomorrow is the day I wash it.

126
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:02,475
I heard if I wash my hair too often, it will fall out.

127
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,943
Hey! You trying not to have your hair fall out will make other people's noses fall off!

128
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,844
Why don't you think of others?

129
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:09,881
You rich bastards are all like that.

130
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,519
Hey, why'd you turn around?

131
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,327
Myung Boo, you go ahead.

132
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,288
There's still a long way till the bus stop...

133
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,330
Take the taxi.

134
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,267
Why are you doing this?

135
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:33,868
Ah, it's cold.

136
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,342
I don't have any money.

137
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,406
Why don't you have any money?

138
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,317
I lent you everything I had.

139
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,513
Ah dude! How could you lend me everything?

140
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,423
What kind of a person doesn't have $30-40 in their wallet?

141
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,484
Ah dude, really...

142
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,299
I have to use this tomorrow, so be sure to pay me back tomorrow.

143
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,403
Hurry, go!

144
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,284
Ah, right! Right, right!

145
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,417
I was going to get bread on the way, I almost forgot.

146
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,262
I should get some.

147
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,396
Oh? Hello!

148
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,224
Ah, I almost passed you by.

149
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,269
Why are you standing here?

150
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,399
Ah, you're staying out of the rain.

151
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,242
Ah, why is it raining all of a sudden?

152
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,375
Where are you headed to?

153
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,478
To the bus stop.

154
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,446
Would you like me to walk you there?

155
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,236
Why are you doing this to me?

156
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,277
What are you doing right now?

157
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:56,778
Cover yourself with the umbrella.

158
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:57,947
Ah, that...

159
00:11:58,048 --> 00:12:00,048
When I share my umbrella...

160
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:02,249
I care more about the other person...

161
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,322
I saw you coming with your friend earlier and you only covered yourself.

162
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,485
Ah, that was because that friend cares more about me.

163
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,357
What are you doing tonight?

164
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,256
Aren't you hungry?

165
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,363
You didn't even have dinner.

166
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,334
Mm... I don't feel so good lately. I get indigestion whenever I eat.

167
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,238
It's just an eating disorder.

168
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,441
Because you always force yourself to eat.

169
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,275
Do you want a break from your work?

170
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,276
Are you going to take care of me?

171
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,482
You don't think I can?

172
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,402
Hello.

173
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,235
Miss So Yeon. Hi!

174
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,408
Eat this before you work.

175
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:32,209
Did someone bite your hand?
No, I...

176
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,511
Ah, you must have an upset stomach again. Um.. Uh...

177
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,358
Give her some good medicine!

178
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,253
Have a pleasant meal.

179
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,262
I'm sorry to keep making you do things.

180
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,456
Ah, it's nothing.

181
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,327
You are so kind.

182
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,329
Thank you.

183
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,307
Why?

184
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,468
You are really kind.

185
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,472
Are you like that to everyone?

186
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,474
When was I?

187
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,386
Since when were you so close with the president's daughter?

188
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,587
How am I close?

189
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:18,088
She's the president's daughter, so I just...

190
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,884
Ah, so if you're the president's daughter, you can touch another woman's man?

191
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,323
Okay. I was wrong.

192
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,427
Let's stop and eat something delicious. Huh?

193
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,432
I'm pregnant.

194
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,244
Oh, right now... here...

195
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,344
If you look here...

196
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,373
There is a problem here.

197
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,383
On both sides... it's a bit serious.

198
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,414
Is it cancer?

199
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,515
It isn't that...

200
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,393
If you undergo surgery this time...

201
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,526
In the future... You won't be able to have a child.

202
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,488
What?

203
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,267
Ah, this pregnancy is a miracle too.

204
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,343
Ah, let's do a test to find out the details.

205
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,273
How old are you?

206
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,402
I'm five years old.

207
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,443
Mm? What are you doing there?

208
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,445
Don't bother the ajhumma and come here. Come here.

209
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,451
Stay there.

210
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,284
It's okay.

211
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,326
How many weeks are you?

212
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,331
7 weeks.

213
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,393
Ah, then you must have heard the baby's heartbeat.

214
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,327
A heartbeat?

215
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,399
You can hear that already?

216
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:43,503
Of course.

217
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,243
I heard my kids' in their 6th week.

218
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,243
You have to listen to it. It's really fascinating.

219
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:54,375
I still cry when I think of the emotions then.

220
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,356
Why did you take that out? Huh?

221
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,354
Mommy told you to stay still! Do you want to die?

222
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,362
You really..

223
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,863
Ah, I'm so sorry.

224
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,899
The kids are so active.

225
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,158
I don't hear anything.

226
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:46,571
I haven't turned it on yet.

227
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,351
I can't do it.

228
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,324
Really, why do you keep saying that?

229
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,231
Am I like this for no reason?

230
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,403
Why are you like that really?

231
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,471
We're already done talking about it.

232
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,294
We've decided to do that.

233
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,465
Yeah.

234
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:23,466
But...

235
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,311
After hearing our baby's heartbeat...

236
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,507
I can't do it.

237
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,508
I won't do it.

238
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,343
Ah! So frustrating.

239
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,390
Ah, why are you so frustrating and stubborn?

240
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,856
Am I pregnant with a different person's child?

241
00:17:44,157 --> 00:17:45,157
How could you say that?

242
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,424
That's why. Why can't you understand what I'm saying?

243
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,325
I don't ever want a child.

244
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,233
You're being so stubborn.

245
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,237
Huh? Is that love?

246
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,375
If you keep going on like this, I have no other choice than to end this.

247
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,437
Alright. Let's end this.

248
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,218
I'm really scared this child in my stomach will be selfish like you.

249
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,389
I don't have any feelings left for that kind of child.

250
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,785
I'll do what you want.

251
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,269
Ah, you crazy fool.

252
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,476
-Why doesn't it turn off?
-Ah you bastard. You rotten man.

253
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:07,877
Quit playing with yourself, you rotten fool.

254
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,472
It'll explode. Ah gross!

255
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,305
It isn't anything like that.

256
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,418
Hey, then what's this naked woman?

257
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,316
She isn't naked!

258
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,353
It's lingerie!

259
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,425
I'm just monitoring a coworker.

260
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,286
Ah, you bastard. Lies spew out of your mouth whenever you open it.

261
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,594
Aigoo, answer the the phone you imbecile.

262
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:27,599
Who is it?

263
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,800
-It's a woman.
-I told you not to answer my phone! Why do you keep answering it?

264
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,463
Then don't leave your phone lying around, you idiot.

265
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,502
-Woman who? Aunt? This is Aunt's number..
-Is Aunt a woman?

266
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,278
Lift up your leg. Look at all of this hair! Move out of the way! Look at all the hair!

267
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:45,348
-Ah be quiet!
-Are you shedding? Why is there so much hair?

268
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,446
-The son or his father...
-Ah, get out!

269
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:53,315
Ah, why does it smell so sour in a human's home? It smells like sour dog food.

270
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,289
Rub with this you bastard!

271
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,020
I got it! Get out, get out. Hurry.

272
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:59,521
-Ah, so gross.
-Ah shit really!

273
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,461
Why does it smell so sour? So sour...
It smells like rotten dog food, you rotten fool.

274
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,237
I'm going to leave this house, really!

275
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,497
Get out! Please!

276
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,406
Hello?

277
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:12,407
Hello.

278
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,274
Who are you?

279
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,473
It's me, Shin So Yeon.

280
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,375
She heard everything! AHH!

281
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,921
Ah shit! She heard everything! Ah, so embarrassing!!

282
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,452
Your mother seems to be really angry that I called..

283
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:28,153
[Pirates Of The Caribbean]

284
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,392
Ah no...

285
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,290
I'm sorry.

286
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,791
Oh no, it's nothing.

287
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:40,404
Ah.. but... Why did you call me today?

288
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:46,367
It doesn't seem like you are interested in me...

289
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,303
Yes.

290
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,384
Still, you are pure.

291
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,411
P..p..p..pure?

292
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,383
How am I so pure?

293
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:04,421
She's saying you are incompetent.
Why can't you understand what she's saying?

294
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,464
Ah, you.. What are you doing?

295
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,463
Ah you're doing it again, again.

296
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:14,464
Excuse me...

297
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,468
Let me ask you one thing.

298
00:21:18,469 --> 00:21:19,469
Yes, go ahead and speak.

299
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,313
A certain man and a woman, in love, got a baby.

300
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,251
The woman wants to have the baby, but the man...

301
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,417
He loves the woman so much...
But he doesn't want a child.

302
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,519
Ah, that's a definite no.

303
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,362
That person is too selfish, in my opinion...

304
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,300
If a person you love,

305
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:47,329
gets pregnant and wants to have the child,
then you have to let her have it. That's real love.

306
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,474
Am I wrong?

307
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,077
Am I wrong?

308
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,514
Excuse me...

309
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,948
Ah, where is the women's washroom?

310
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,359
Oh, washroom.

311
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,394
That... If you go straight out of here,

312
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,459
There is a parking lot with cars parked. Just go behind there.

313
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,325
Choose any car...

314
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,331
Yes...

315
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,132
You can't do the number 2... That wouldn't be good..

316
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,273
Ahjusshi.

317
00:22:32,874 --> 00:22:36,274
You can't tell the difference between pure and incompetent?

318
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,253
Aigoo...

319
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:42,450
If a woman tells you you're pure,
it means 'hey you idiot, you couldn't take it even if I gave it to you.'

320
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,485
That's just what you think.

321
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,230
Aigoo.

322
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,231
Ah... Forget it... Just give me another bottle of soju.

323
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:53,199
Also, in this kind of situation,
you have to drink a strong drink, like a man.

324
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,238
That's what makes women fall for you. Ah...

325
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:56,902
A strong drink?

326
00:22:56,903 --> 00:23:00,403
That's right, for example.. Yea, this one is good, Ahn Dong Soju.

327
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,479
You have to drink something like this.

328
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,980
That's what makes women say, 'Ah, what do I do tonight?'

329
00:23:04,981 --> 00:23:05,981
Give me that.

330
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:14,448
Ah, hey there!
Go home. Quit being pure.

331
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,886
That is enough of being pure.

332
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,359
I can go when she comes.

333
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,332
That woman isn't coming back.

334
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,426
Have you seen a woman that pees for 2 hours?

335
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,972
Aigoo, aigoo...

336
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,573
She left?

337
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:33,268
Ah ahjusshi, you kept telling her to pee behind the truck,
that's why she left.

338
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,415
If she liked you, she would pee even at the front and come back.

339
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:42,385
You don't think of how much you lack, but have such a temper...

340
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,370
Wait... Stop! Stop! Stop!! Ahjusshi!

341
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,301
Ahjusshi, stop!!

342
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,461
Oh! Miss So Yeon...

343
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,401
You said you were going to the bathroom...

344
00:24:37,502 --> 00:24:38,502
But you are here.

345
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,508
Are you crying?

346
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:48,977
So Yeon... Why? The weather is so cold right now, and you're here by yourself...

347
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,447
The Han River winds are really strong...

348
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,325
Ah, it's really cold...

349
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,356
Is something wrong?

350
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,503
Will you...

351
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,305
hug me?

352
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,456
Why are you crying?

353
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:30,016
Would you like to get another drink?
I'll buy.

354
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:37,060
Ah, umm... I drank a lot...

355
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,530
But I have one condition.

356
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,499
Let's go somewhere with a washroom.

357
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,254
Hello?

358
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,786
Sir, it's time for you to check out.

359
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:02,487
Yes.

360
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,400
I don't remember a thing about last night...

361
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,498
Did I come into this room by myself?

362
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,342
You came with a woman.
Why? Is there a problem?

363
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,403
It's my privacy.

364
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,455
It hasn't been long since we met.. but already...

365
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,454
You did good. It's now absolute.

366
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,398
You bastard...

367
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,407
Hyung!

368
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,908
Oh, I'm a little busy.

369
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,480
Has So Yeon come yet?

370
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,515
She quit.

371
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:06,481
What did you say?

372
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,323
Yeah.

373
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,388
Hey, hey. There, that woman is your new wife starting today.

374
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,458
Doesn't she look like she could eat a lot of meat?

375
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,395
Her nickname is 'the hippo that drinks meat.'

376
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,503
Ah... Just because we slept together once, she quits her job...

377
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,538
I guess it would be uncomfortable to see each other.

378
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,880
What do you mean slept? With who?

379
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:35,381
Don't be surprised.

380
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:39,414
Hey, Miss Hippo! Why do you keep eating the props?!

381
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,561
You wouldn't believe me even if I told you.

382
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,334
[Ulnar Nerve Palsy]

383
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,373
Hello?

384
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:02,268
Yes, hello. Uh, it's me, Yoo Sang Yeol.
Pure man, Yoo Sang Yeol...

385
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,210
So?

386
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,511
Ah, why did you quit your job over that kind of thing?

387
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:09,478
What kind of thing?

388
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:15,517
Uh, last night... Why are you asking? I'm embarrassed...

389
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,385
What about last night?

390
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,390
You're doing this because we had sex last night.

391
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,395
What kind of crazy thing are you talking about right now?

392
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:29,302
Are you really going to deny it?

393
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,270
Che!

394
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:34,310
Hey you crazy pervert! HANG UP!

395
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,372
What kind of guy is this?

396
00:28:39,473 --> 00:28:40,173
Who is it?

397
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:41,307
You don't need to know.

398
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:47,512
Ulnar nerve palsy?

399
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,352
A Chinese person?

400
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,291
Mind your own business.

401
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,329
No.. she slept with me..

402
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,498
And now saying that she didn't doesn't make it so it hasn't happened.

403
00:29:06,499 --> 00:29:07,499
Ah, really...

404
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,475
My heart hurts really bad.

405
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,376
Why that woman did that to me...

406
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,513
You would know...

407
00:29:17,014 --> 00:29:19,014
How cold-hearted of a person I am...

408
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,487
After sleeping together, I can't do anything.

409
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,262
My heart's beating so hard.

410
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,289
Stop eating, you! Stop!

411
00:29:31,034 --> 00:29:32,603
Are you even listening to me?

412
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,430
I'm listening.

413
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,307
I'm ashamed of myself for bringing you along
and telling you these things.

414
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,973
Do you like the Bladder Moon Snail?

415
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:46,911
No, it's so gross I can't eat it.

416
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,588
Really? Ahjusshi, one more bladder moon snail please.

417
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:51,589
Okay, buddy~

418
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,319
I heard you have a tough love life.

419
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:03,394
I don't know about anything else, but if you have any questions regarding romance, ask me.

420
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,003
Ahjusshi, do you know anything about romance?

421
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,395
That's why.

422
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,367
You did it with her.

423
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,402
-But she's arguing that she didn't.

424
00:30:12,403 --> 00:30:13,403
Yes!

425
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,379
That's a simple matter.

426
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:16,514
A simple matter?

427
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:18,279
Of course.

428
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,380
That just means that

429
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,444
you weren't very good in bed.

430
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,990
It isn't anything like that.

431
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:27,891
I'm telling you I'm right.

432
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,418
Then, ask that woman if what I said is wrong.

433
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,354
How could I ask her such a thing? It's humiliating.

434
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:38,265
It's okay to ask. The audacity of a man to ask those things,

435
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:42,405
can be seen as charming to women.

436
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,333
Women? There isn't much to them, the more you know.

437
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:49,838
If you are bold and good in bed, you are great as a man.

438
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,407
Ah, that's what you think.

439
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,307
This is really frustrating!

440
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:55,410
Would you like to bet with me?

441
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:57,211
What should we bet?

442
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,880
How about my eye?

443
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,261
Hello?

444
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,263
Ah, I called the wrong number. I'm sorry.

445
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,264
Sang Yeol.

446
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,174
Yes.

447
00:31:15,575 --> 00:31:17,575
Why do you keep doing this?

448
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,336
-Please don't call.
-Ah, that...

449
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,280
I'm hanging up.

450
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,181
Ah, wait, wait.

451
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,474
What is it?

452
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:27,075
I'm sorry, but I...

453
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:31,377
Let me ask you one thing and I will hang up.
I won't call you again.

454
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,053
What is it?

455
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:37,589
Um,

456
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,390
was I not very good?

457
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,325
There's nothing you did wrong.

458
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:46,597
No, that's not it..

459
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:52,398
I'm asking if I did badly that night...

460
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:53,871
You don't have any fault.

461
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,277
Yes, I know, but...

462
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,548
That's not it...

463
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:00,249
What is it?

464
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,379
Was I bad at sex?

465
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,450
What?

466
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:12,221
-Oh my, this guy is really...
-Uh, no that's not it... Someone asked me to ask so I am asking...

467
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,390
Oh my, what a dirty person!

468
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,426
Hey! Wake up you crazy fool!

469
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:22,270
That's not it... I don't know how to ask those kinds of things... Hello?

470
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,236
Hello? Hello...

471
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,278
I'm screwed. Shit.

472
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,414
I'm going to pluck out his remaining eyeball.

473
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,222
Die!!

474
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,284
Hey, why does that idiot claim that you did it when you didn't?

475
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:47,260
I know. He was drunk, so I took him to the motel...

476
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,299
He took off his clothes as soon as he went in... and then slept.

477
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,634
Then, you must have seen his manhood.

478
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:57,935
Mm.

479
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,537
Is it big?

480
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:00,238
No.

481
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,310
It's small.

482
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,243
Shit. How small?

483
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,450
Quite very small.

484
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,220
How small is that?

485
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:11,513
Why do you ask that kind of thing?

486
00:33:11,514 --> 00:33:13,214
-Ah, hey.
-I don't know.

487
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,315
Hey!

488
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,489
Like this, but.. hold on..

489
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:20,190
It's smaller than that?

490
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:22,597
About this much?

491
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,463
Well, it's about that size.

492
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:29,232
Oh my god, that's a shrimp cracker. Is that a human's...?

493
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,500
Ah, life is so pitiful.

494
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,209
Just neatly reject him.

495
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,981
Of course I did.

496
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,447
What about the baby, did you do it?

497
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:46,948
No.

498
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,280
I'm going to have it.

499
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,363
You're going to raise it by yourself?

500
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,662
Why? Can't I?

501
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,334
You crazy bitch.

502
00:33:56,402 --> 00:34:00,061
Our country still thinks unwed mothers are criminals.

503
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,236
Do you want to live your life being treated like that?

504
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,340
Would you say that if it was the only child
you could have in your whole life?

505
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,937
Ah, it's so complicated.

506
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,474
Don't say that just because you don't have to deal with it.

507
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,486
I'm sorry for saying it, but...

508
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,412
I'm just thinking of you.

509
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:22,359
Also, do you want to live the same way your mother did?

510
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,422
She had a hard time raising you without a husband.

511
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,264
If she finds out that you are living the same life,

512
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,423
She'll cry tears of blood.

513
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,292
Ah, enough! My ear hurts.

514
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:36,967
You bitch. You don't understand what I'm saying.

515
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,468
Who is it?

516
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:42,369
Who is it?

517
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,480
Ulnar Nerve Palsy.

518
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,314
Wait a minute.

519
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,408
Hey. Didn't you say that idiot is arguing that you slept with him?

520
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,409
Mm.

521
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,347
Then say it's his. That would solve everything.

522
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,418
You crazy bitch.
You're telling me to live with a person that I don't love?

523
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,654
If you find that you can't live with him, just divorce him.

524
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,527
A divorcee is better than an unwed mother.

525
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,460
Are you crazy? I'm about to go crazy anyways.

526
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:09,304
Would I say this if I weren't as frustrated?

527
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,247
Really, why is he calling? Why?

528
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,246
Ah, so annoying. I'm so annoyed.

529
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,319
Hey. Leave it to me.

530
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,251
This kind of guy will continue if you are nice.

531
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,392
Hey. Hello!

532
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,429
You know why, right?

533
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,423
When a woman says she doesn't want to, but a man keeps bothering her.

534
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,424
Don't you know that's called stalking and sexual harassment?

535
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,359
You could go to jail for this.

536
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,430
If you make one more call to my So Yeon,

537
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,204
Then I will cut off your fingers one by one.

538
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,378
So you won't be able to touch your phone.

539
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,440
Ah, pull out his eyeball instead.

540
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,316
Ahjusshi, Ahjusshi! Please!

541
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,251
I'm sorry, but

542
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:02,290
I really had no idea that it was that bad to do that.

543
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,328
But, since it's turned out this way, I'm really sorry.

544
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,363
It's okay.

545
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,270
Is it the caller's fault? It's my fault for making you call.

546
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,464
Hey, that's a good line.

547
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,407
So, it's settled.

548
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:22,303
In the name of repenting and forgiving,

549
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:23,804
Shall we toast?

550
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,415
You guys have made up. Okay?

551
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:30,410
Hold it up. Shrimp crackers.

552
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,295
Hey. Let me ask you one thing.

553
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:44,393
You love her, right?

554
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,336
You're embarrassing me. Why do you ask that?

555
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:52,237
Ah, shit. You're a man and you can't be honest.

556
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,310
Hey. Backbone!

557
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:56,311
-What?
-Sit straight. Your backbone...

558
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,279
Do you think you are a hunched shrimp cracker?

559
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,383
What do you think you are doing, hunching like that

560
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,281
in front of me?

561
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,387
Honestly tell me. You love her, right?

562
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,422
Do you love her?

563
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,350
A little...

564
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,395
You bastard. What's a little?

565
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,431
That's why that is small too.

566
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,359
Hey. Why do you point out his weakness?

567
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,375
Do you really like me?

568
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,477
Yes, I told you everything awhile ago.

569
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:39,482
Since when?

570
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:45,452
The Fall Special... 6 piece beef gift set..

571
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,523
Since then...

572
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,265
What do you like about me?

573
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,340
So Yeon, you may not feel the same but...

574
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:04,046
Every time you wrapped meat and fed me...

575
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:08,047
'Ah, we really are a couple.'

576
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,514
I thought those things.

577
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,947
Ah, it isn't that I thought that...

578
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,894
I think I fell into the illusion.

579
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,060
So Yeon, me,

580
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:24,232
and our daughter... a family...

581
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:27,233
It felt so happy. Those kinds of thoughts...

582
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,239
Those illusions...

583
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,309
During those times,

584
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:38,311
I told myself I had nothing more to want in this world.

585
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:42,610
It made me think like that.

586
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,284
It's funny, isn't it?

587
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,319
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have said that...

588
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,826
I...

589
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,627
am pregnant.

590
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:11,128
Hey!

591
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,383
What do we do? You'll be so surprised when you hear this.

592
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,378
Hey, PD Park is here.

593
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,415
You've got quite the nerve to call him here.

594
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,259
I didn't call him.

595
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,494
You crazy bitch.

596
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:27,295
I've heard of switching kids but never heard of switching dads!

597
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,490
Be quiet. Someone will hear.

598
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,794
Hey, this was your idea.

599
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:37,074
Oh my... you are accusing an innocent person.

600
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,874
You're the one that did it.

601
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:41,275
Ah.

602
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,246
Hey, but you've got skills.

603
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,507
You made her pregnant in one go.

604
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,353
There is a really important thing for men.

605
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:53,321
You can't change it with money or power.

606
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,683
What's that?

607
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:57,784
Strength! Power, a strength that doesn't know how to tire.

608
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,464
You're joking.

609
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,590
You have a really small one.

610
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:04,091
Women like smaller ones.

611
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,333
Don't lie!

612
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,072
They like big ones you idiot.

613
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,331
When you scratch your ear,

614
00:40:10,332 --> 00:40:11,032
Does it feel better when you use your thumb?

615
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,501
Or does it feel better with your pinkie finger?

616
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:14,402
Pinkie.

617
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,303
See, you fool.

618
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,358
Can I have all of the groom's friends come out?

619
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,225
We don't have much time.

620
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,493
We're all here.

621
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,203
Whiskey please.
[*Note: Koreans say Whiskey when taking pictures.]

622
00:40:49,004 --> 00:40:50,004
It's mine. Give it to me.

623
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,490
They say kimchi stew is the best when you have morning sickness.

624
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,433
Ah, don't just sit there because you don't have an appetite.

625
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,293
Try to eat something.

626
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,365
Have some.

627
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:25,482
How is it?

628
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,542
I don't feel like eating.

629
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,253
Then watch me eat. People say that when they watch me eat,

630
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,286
it makes them want to eat too.

631
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,492
Here.

632
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,595
Did you brush your teeth before eating?

633
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,233
I will brush when I'm done eating. Oh hot!

634
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,464
You don't brush your teeth when you sleep either, right?

635
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,399
Don't you brush your teeth in the morning?

636
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,548
Do you have to make that much noise when you eat?

637
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,359
What noise is she talking about?

638
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,296
It's hot.

639
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,365
I'll be right back after stopping by the hospital, So Yeon.

640
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,429
Hello. You're peeling garlic.

641
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,409
Sit here for a bit.

642
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,010
I can't. I have to go.

643
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,377
Just peel 3 of these for me before you leave.

644
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,005
It's because my hands hurt.

645
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:31,106
I would like to do that too...

646
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,346
But I can't be late.

647
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,247
What are you doing?

648
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,244
I'm an actor.
[*Note: Actor in Korean = bae woo = to learn also :)]

649
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,447
What are you learning?

650
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,460
Ah, that is... I'm acting on T.V.

651
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,463
A talent?
[*Note: A talent in Korea is like a celebrity.]

652
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,493
A person with a face like yours can be a talent too?

653
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,075
His wife is like a flower growing on dog shit.

654
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:04,971
Wow, this really tastes the best of all the meat I've tried.
It just melts in your mouth.

655
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:09,143
Yes, we hope that you can experience this melting feeling as well.

656
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,289
We will leave the decision to you.

657
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,448
I am Shopping Host Hong Ga Young and Ha Wee Soo. Thank you.

658
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,485
And cut!

659
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,855
Good work. Good work.

660
00:43:21,256 --> 00:43:23,256
Good work. Good work.

661
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:26,298
Hey. Is this all you can do?

662
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,472
If you eat, frowning, do you think the viewers would want to eat it?

663
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:31,773
Ah, it's not that...

664
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:36,445
This woman kept wrapping the meat...

665
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,372
And kept shoving it into my mouth...

666
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:43,086
I'm not a meat grinder...

667
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:47,015
Ah, Yoo Sang Yeol is right about that.

668
00:43:47,016 --> 00:43:49,016
That woman shoved it in very roughly.

669
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,231
Are you his representative?

670
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,430
I apologize.

671
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,335
Didn't I tell you not to let the actors overlap?

672
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:02,495
He ate at another show, do you think he would be able to eat again?

673
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,398
You're a useless bastard.

674
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,250
Are you okay?

675
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,283
Do your job right!

676
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,320
-Did you work another job in the morning?
-Yea.

677
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:25,227
You told me to work hard before the baby was born.

678
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,491
Ow! My nose!

679
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:03,433
My nose..

680
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:08,094
Ah, see! You snore so much, of course your nose hurts.

681
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,274
I have something I want to eat.

682
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,478
Really?

683
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,506
Ah, that's great.

684
00:45:16,307 --> 00:45:17,307
What is it?

685
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,379
-Barbecued chicken.
-Barbecued chicken?

686
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:22,046
With lots of radish in vinegar.

687
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,281
Ahjusshi!

688
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,460
Oh, what brings you here at this hour?

689
00:45:31,761 --> 00:45:33,261
You're going to have a drink?

690
00:45:33,462 --> 00:45:36,462
No, do you have charcoal?

691
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:38,033
Charcoal?

692
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:39,896
I can't use that because it's too expensive.

693
00:45:39,997 --> 00:45:40,997
What do I do?

694
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,364
My wife wants barbecued chicken.

695
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,367
Can't I do it on the grill?

696
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,238
Ahjusshi, if you grill a chicken, would that be considered a bbq chicken?

697
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,981
Is that how it is?

698
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,308
Does it become a lightning chicken?

699
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:59,413
Lightning chicken?

700
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,434
It's so good.

701
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,437
-It tastes better than barbecue.

702
00:46:22,438 --> 00:46:23,438
-Isn't it?

703
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:27,010
This is totally different than barbeque.

704
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,442
A lighting strike has much higher wattage...

705
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,688
Oh, then is this grilled with lightening?

706
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,326
No, it isn't anything like that...

707
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:38,461
Why? Are you looking for something?

708
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,062
My radishes. Radishes in vinegar.

709
00:46:41,767 --> 00:46:46,159
Ah, we grilled that at the street stall...

710
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,500
Why? Why aren't you eating it?

711
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,276
I don't eat radish to eat chicken.

712
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:56,469
I eat chicken to eat radish.

713
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:01,376
Just eat this for today, it's raining a lot outside.

714
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,286
When a pregnant mother

715
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,218
says that she wants to eat something,
it isn't because she wants to eat it,

716
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,458
it's because the baby

717
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,285
needs the nutrition in that food.

718
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,521
Ah, well... okay. I'll go.

719
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,230
I'll go right now and buy some.

720
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:20,370
What kind of nutrition does radish have that you want it so bad...?

721
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,304
Oh, it moved! It's moving.

722
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,278
Wow, it's fascinating.

723
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,504
Doctor, when will our baby be born?

724
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,250
There're 15 weeks left.

725
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:37,387
Didn't I tell you?

726
00:47:37,422 --> 00:47:38,514
Oh I see.

727
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,881
It's kicking again, again! Wow.

728
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,387
Doctor,

729
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,522
is our baby a son or a daughter?

730
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:51,859
I can't tell you that.

731
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,629
Ah, why? I heard all of the other hospitals tell you things like that...

732
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,942
We go by the rules.

733
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:05,448
Oh! That looks like a weenie.

734
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,877
It's a boy! That long thing is a weenie, right?

735
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:09,983
It's the umbilical cord.

736
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,482
-How is your constipation?
-It's bad.

737
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,517
If you continue to be constipated, then you can take a laxative.

738
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:17,258
Okay.

739
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:22,162
Also, the baby is very good looking.

740
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,500
Thank you.

741
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:26,870
-Get up slowly, from your side.
-Yes.

742
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,507
"We go by the rules"

743
00:48:32,677 --> 00:48:34,069
Will you get much business like that?

744
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:39,173
The gynecologists are going bankrupt because people aren't wanting to have babies...

745
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,511
They couldn't let us know even that...

746
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,443
She says it's a boy.

747
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,342
Who did?

748
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,319
She says it's good looking.

749
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:50,453
Hyung, do you see this long thing here?

750
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,421
Do you know what this is?

751
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,457
-The umbilical cord.
-Oh. You know at first sight.

752
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,459
I was so happy because I thought this was a weenie.

753
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,496
Hey, how could that be possible?
They say the size of a weener depends on genes too.

754
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,274
Ah, that's true. He shouldn't take after me on that...

755
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,237
Have you given him a name?

756
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:11,473
Yes, Bok Ddang. The lucky 'bok' letter and
the thank you 'ddang' word. So Bok Ddang.
[*Note: "Ddangi" in Korean is like a cutie.]

757
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,283
-Thank you 'ddang'?
-Yea. Look at how high his nose is.

758
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,351
Hey! What are you doing?

759
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,249
Ah, you're here?

760
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,219
You're not getting ready for the show?

761
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:24,360
Director. Look at this. It's Sang Yeol's baby picture. Isn't it cute?

762
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:29,493
Do you have time for this right now?

763
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,368
Have you passed out all of the cue sheets?

764
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,396
Ah, those.. PD Jang said not to pass them out.

765
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,433
Are you PD Jang's assistant or mine?

766
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,872
Ah, I'm sorry.

767
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:47,482
That's why you are still an assistant after all this time.

768
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,459
Hyung, isn't PD Park younger than you?

769
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:58,454
Why does he speak so informally? He's very rude.

770
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,490
That kid is younger than you too.

771
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,499
Really? Are you serious? I'm shocked.

772
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,337
Hyung, let's speak to him comfortably from now on too.

773
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,438
Ah, what can you do if you want to live.

774
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:13,265
I can't do that even if I starve. He's younger than me..

775
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:16,244
If I catch him, I'll break his leg...

776
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,404
-Hey! Come in!
-Yes? Yes.

777
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,340
Hey, hey, hey, me, me, me...

778
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,414
I get more nervous by the day.

779
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:30,384
It seems like Sang Yeol knows something,

780
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,223
and is acting like he doesn't...

781
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,297
What are you going to do? You're so nervous.

782
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,265
Also, that means that Bok Ddang is coming out in 8 months.

783
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:42,302
Even the most innocent person knows that a baby is born after 10 months.

784
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,236
That's true.

785
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:47,410
Ah, why didn't I think of that?

786
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,274
It's driving me crazy.

787
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:55,250
Hey, just tell him that Bok Ddang is premature.

788
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:58,388
There are more babies that are born in eight months than you think.

789
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,347
Do you think he'd believe that?

790
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,460
No, if it's Sang Yeol, he'll believe it.

791
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:06,455
He's not a common idiot.

792
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:10,433
Who's an idiot? He's just innocent.

793
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,496
Crazy bitch.

794
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,201
Just because he is your husband.

795
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,341
Ah, that feels good.

796
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,244
You ate a lot for lunch and you're eating that again?

797
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,478
The baby has to grow, so the amount that I eat would of course increase.

798
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,414
This belly...

799
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,687
By chance, is it that it isn't a baby growing...

800
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,454
But your poop is piling up in there?

801
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,756
Ah, I'm eating. Really...

802
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,268
But...

803
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,465
Can't we take that picture down?

804
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,704
It makes me feel like that weird guy is going to pop out.

805
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,337
Really?

806
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,439
But, that is supposed to protect your love,

807
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,444
And it holds your water veins steady.

808
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,412
So, it's a good thing...

809
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,416
We can take it down.

810
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,228
But, I'm kind of sad.

811
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,326
Just leave it then.

812
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,329
No, it's not that...

813
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,457
This is your home, So Yeon.

814
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,361
There's no need to ask permission from me.

815
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:43,448
Ahh...

816
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:46,387
Yes, So Yeon.

817
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,395
-Sang Yeol...
-Yes?

818
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,467
It's about to come out...

819
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,429
-The baby is about to come out?
-No...

820
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:56,363
Oh, poop is about to come out?

821
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,303
Hold on just a minute.

822
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,254
Sang Yeol!

823
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,391
Yes, I'm coming out.

824
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,392
Hurry, please.

825
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,297
Ah, that smell.

826
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:34,432
Why, Why?

827
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:35,706
So Yeon, what's wrong?

828
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,519
Again?

829
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,521
Is this poop or an anaconda?

830
00:53:53,222 --> 00:53:53,922
Ah,

831
00:53:54,223 --> 00:53:55,123
I'm going to die of suffocation.

832
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,392
How is it?

833
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,436
So Yeon, will you open the door for a minute please?

834
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,371
Why?

835
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,234
I can't breathe.

836
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,398
Ah, I don't want to...

837
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:09,435
I won't open the door until the water has gone down.

838
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:11,371
I'm scared...

839
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:14,506
What are you afraid of? I'm the one who's going through your poo.

840
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:23,484
Oh, I think it worked.

841
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,294
I'm going to flush it.

842
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,488
That's right, that's right.

843
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,396
Uh... this shouldn't happen, right?

844
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,343
Open the door, So Yeon!

845
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:48,474
The anaconda just popped out.

846
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,481
-Oh no!!
-I won't open it.

847
00:54:58,328 --> 00:54:59,421
I won't ever open it.

848
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,556
Just one time.

849
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,427
Go to sleep. Please!

850
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:33,428
I'm tired.

851
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:42,536
Just sleep. I'm tired.

852
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,312
I told you to go to sleep.

853
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,251
I told you I'm tired.

854
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,304
What are you doing right now?

855
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,344
I'm asking you what you're doing right now!

856
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:31,252
Ah, So Yeon. Why aren't you sleeping?

857
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,321
You're not letting me sleep.

858
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:37,392
You keep doing this. How can I sleep?

859
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,391
We did it just once before marriage and haven't done it since.

860
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:47,503
The doctor said

861
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:50,832
to be careful. Don't you remember?

862
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,034
Go to sleep. Okay?

863
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,445
Let's sleep.

864
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:17,491
You have another worry?

865
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,237
If you are worried about something, tell me.

866
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:24,201
Ahjusshi, mind your own business.

867
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:26,407
Don't sit here and go. Quickly.

868
00:57:27,508 --> 00:57:28,508
Aigoo.

869
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,406
Something's really bothering you today...

870
00:57:32,952 --> 00:57:37,041
On a day that you feel down like this,

871
00:57:37,453 --> 00:57:38,579
there's nothing better.

872
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:42,414
Have a drink of soju and go to your wife.

873
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:43,492
That's the best thing.

874
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:48,486
I got it.

875
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,462
-Eat lots.
-Yes.

876
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,334
You scared me.

877
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,435
Why'd you call me all of the sudden?

878
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:02,411
You idiot. Really..

879
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,311
I don't have any money today, so don't think of borrowing any.

880
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,476
This outfit doesn't even have any pockets.

881
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:09,375
I bought this because of you.

882
00:58:09,376 --> 00:58:13,076
[Pirates of the Caribbean]

883
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,483
I haven't done it in so long, I think I'm going to explode.

884
00:58:20,527 --> 00:58:21,595
I'm not getting married.

885
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,296
Marriage is a crazy thing.

886
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,497
It isn't that you aren't getting married. You can't.

887
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:29,496
I'm leaving.

888
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:42,442
I thought you were leaving.

889
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,417
Pay back all of the money you borrowed from me right now.

890
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,386
Why are you so heavy?

891
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,234
Just a little more...

892
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:07,409
Hey, Sang Yeol!

893
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,511
Hey...

894
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,303
Try to get up.

895
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,408
Hurry, get up!

896
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:20,482
Wake up...

897
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:23,083
He's totally drunk.

898
00:59:24,884 --> 00:59:25,584
Hey!

899
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:28,489
This is revenge.

900
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,460
Wake up!

901
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:34,333
I told you to wake up.

902
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,334
Mmm...

903
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:45,235
So Yeon, what are you doing? It's too noisy.

904
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,343
Ah..

905
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:54,480
So Yeon, what are you doing? It's loud...

906
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,327
Where is this?

907
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:16,846
How long has it been since we got married
that you slept outside?

908
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:18,906
I was drunk and I had no idea...

909
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:22,416
Where did you sleep?

910
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,345
A motel..

911

917
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:41,232
-Myung Boo.
-With Myung Boo?

918
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:43,438
Nothing happened between us.

919
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,012
Okay. There wouldn't be anything between you and Myung Boo.

920
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:56,485
Do I wash?

921
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,316
Go wash up.

922
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:02,489
Ah that rascal.

923

925

Lately,

926
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:16,439
even if a man sits next to me in the bus,

927
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,800
I get scared.

928
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:23,404
No matter how drunk I was,
no matter how much I haven't had sex with a woman,

929
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,413
How would I do you?

930
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:26,506
How could I do a man?

931
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:36,219
And honestly.

932
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,295
How do I trust your words?

933
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,398
It's not like there is any evidence.

934
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,400
Evidence?

935
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:53,401
Here. You see the yellow, right?

936
01:01:54,202 --> 01:01:55,202
What is this?

937
01:01:55,877 --> 01:01:56,901
What do you think it is?

938
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:59,577
-Hmm?
-Shit, really...

939
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:04,282
Put it away, quickly. Put away the evidence.

940
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:07,221

959

Don't try to trap me.

What does that mean?
What do you mean by trap?

972
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,350
It's nothing.

to sleep with Myung Boo?

01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,299
Why do you say that?

1064
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,362
That Ahjusshi likes you, Sang Yeol.

1065
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:00,338
Okay.

1066
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,240
Then I'll see you later.

1067
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:15,414
Get in.

1068
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,485
Do you want all of the neighbors to know?

1069
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:30,369
Why are you doing this?

1070
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,408
You should know better.

1071
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:35,435
About what?

1072
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,245
It's my kid, isn't it?

1073
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:41,514
Are you crazy?

1074
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,476
How are you going to explain why
the child is born after only 8 months?

1075
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,051
Th..that's because he's premature.

1076
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:51,317
Your hospital told you he's premature?

1077
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:54,488
They could win the Nobel Prize.

1078
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:05,689
Where have you been?

1079
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:08,273
Why are you out here?

1080
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:11,306
You told me to come in early,

1081
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:12,914
but you weren't home and your phone was off.

1082
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:14,375
Oh! You bought something for Bok Ddang.

1083
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:18,350
Wow. It's so pretty, this gift wrap.

1084
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,355
-Were you out long?
-No, only about 2 hours.

1085
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:27,027
Why are you so foolish?

1086
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,331
I just went out because I wanted to.

1087
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,232
I thought I might get some fresh air.

1088
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:36,271
Your complexion doesn't look good.
Are you feeling alright?

1089
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:37,372
I'm just

1090
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,373
a bit dizzy.

1091
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,443
Oh! Isn't that pregnancy dizziness?

1092
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,506
I heard that pregnancy dizziness could be dangerous.

1093
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,375
It's not.

1094
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:49,282
Have you eaten?

1095
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:52,353
That's not the problem... Dizziness is dangerous...

1096
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:56,423
My friend, Byung Gook, his wife,
she ate this and was all better.

1097
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,419
-She was very energetic after it.
-Oh, it looks really good.

1098
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:01,428
Mixed? What? Hello.
-Hello.

1099
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:04,331
What's that?

1100
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,459
Ah, this isn't much.

1101
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,599
His wife is a bit sick.

1102
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,463
We heard that deer blood was really good for dizziness.
So Hyung got it for me..

1103
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:15,407
Hey. Who feeds a pregnant woman this kind of thing nowadays?

1104
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:19,246
Are you going to be responsible
if something happens to the baby?

1105
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:25,285
No. Don't ever feed this to her.

1106
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:28,513
Come see me after you're done.

1107
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:30,315
Don't do it!

1108
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:43,037
He's lunatic. Why is he going crazy? Is it his kid?

1109
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:18,339
Do you know why I called you?

1110
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:21,305
I'm sorry.

1111
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,502
I won't do it from now on.

1112
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,445
What won't you do?

1113
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:30,349
Eating, overlapping shows...

1114
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,415
You think I called you because of that?

1115
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,256
It isn't?

1116
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,451
Ah, I apologized for no reason.

1117
01:16:40,352 --> 01:16:41,352
I thought that was the reason..

1118
01:16:44,253 --> 01:16:45,253
Then what is the reason?

1119
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:49,304
This is good.

1120
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,469
Why did you call me here, PD?

1121
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,383
How ridiculous would I feel if I were in your position?

1122
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:05,477
But there's nothing you can do.

1123
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:07,486
I'm the father.

1124
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:14,719
If by chance it was your child,
how would the child be born in 8 months?

1125
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,231
Sang Yeol!

1126
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:31,005
What happened? I was worried.

1127
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:33,506
Since when have you worried about me?

1128
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:47,547
Why do you eat only that much?

1129
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:51,416
I don't have an appetite.

1130
01:18:58,433 --> 01:18:59,400
Sang Yeol.

1131
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,300
I have something to say.

1132
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:03,335
Ah, I have something to say too.

1133
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:07,406
-Umm...
-It's okay if I speak first, right?

1134
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:09,232
Go ahead.

1135
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,647
I have someone I love.

1136
01:19:14,048 --> 01:19:15,048
What?

1137
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,247
But it's a man.

1138
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:20,253
I'm in a relationship with Myung Boo.

1139
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:24,224
How can you tell such a weird joke?

1140
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,258
It isn't a joke.

1141
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:31,255
All this time, I wanted to live like others,

1142
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:32,263
so I used you, So Yeon.

1143
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,231
I want to quit now.

1144
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:39,429
Living like I love you, So Yeon, when I love someone else...

1145
01:19:40,241 --> 01:19:42,337
I just feel so bad. I can't do it anymore.

1146
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:47,203
Let's get a divorce.

1147
01:19:47,304 --> 01:19:48,304
Sang Yeol.

1148
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:49,475
I'm normally this kind of person.

1149
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:52,846
I use other people for my benefits.

1150
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,320
I don't even love you, So Yeon.

1151
01:19:57,825 --> 01:20:00,850
And on top of that, I couldn't become a good father.

1152
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:02,418
Why are you doing this to me?

1153
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:06,189
No matter what you say, So Yeon, I've made my decision.

1154
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,265
Don't look for me anymore.

1155
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,995
Find your road and live a happy life.

1156
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:28,345
Why is a talent like you so down?

1157
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,238
Here. Eat it.

1158
01:20:58,486 --> 01:20:59,475
It's sweet, right?

1159
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:04,449
Feel better.

1160
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,269
You haven't gotten a single call?

1161
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:56,070
Yeah.

1162
01:21:56,471 --> 01:21:58,971
Is it really over between you and Sang Yeol?

1163
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:01,440
Say something!

1164
01:22:02,018 --> 01:22:06,086
-Myung Sook.
-I want to mind my own business too.

1165
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:08,422
So?

1166
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:10,450
What are you going to do with PD Park?

1167
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:13,450
Does he want to get married and have the kid now?

1168
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:17,962
I need some time.

1169
01:22:18,263 --> 01:22:18,963
How much time do you need?

1170
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:21,261
You're having your baby the day after tomorrow.
How much time do you have?

1171
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:22,234
What are you going to do?

1172
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:27,468
After sending you off like that,

1173
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:29,335
it was really tough on me.

1174
01:22:33,349 --> 01:22:35,446
At the time, I was very confused.

1175
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,345
I was too afraid of becoming a father.

1176
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:43,357
So Yeon.

1177
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:46,382
Forgive me.

1178
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:49,355
For the sake of our baby,

1179
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:51,292
Let's start again.

1180
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:06,938
The person you've called is unavailable..

1181
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,246
They said this was really good for pregnancy dizziness.

1182
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,480
Don't misunderstand.

1183
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,367
But that,

1184
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:28,292
protects your love.

1185
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,233
It's a good thing.

1186
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,366
We can take it off.

1187
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:29,352
It's exactly the same as before, right?

1188
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:39,404
Stay here by yourself for the moment being.

1189
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:17,310
Isn't this Jang Myung Boo's home?

1190
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:24,348
What is that now?

1191
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:29,081
What brings you here so late?

1192
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:31,383
What's up with your outfit?

1193
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:34,317
Ah, so refreshing.

1194
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:40,294
Who's that?

1195
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,796
Oh, are you done with your shower?

1196
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:46,330
I'm asking who it is.

1197
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:49,239
Oh, a friend.

1198
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:50,340
A friend?

1199
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,505
What kind of friend?

1200
01:25:54,506 --> 01:25:57,106
We graduated together... from middle school.

1201
01:25:57,418 --> 01:25:59,318
He's married.

1202
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:05,450
-What is that?
-What?

1203
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:07,461
That?

1204
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:10,226
You're scary. So scary.

1205
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:23,501
This'll be yummy.

1206
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:27,243
Okay, it's all done.

1207
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:32,282
Here, one scoop.

1208
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:44,294
-What about me?
-Make it yourself.

1209
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:47,495
Honey, do you want some more?

1210
01:26:47,136 --> 01:26:49,403
-This is already a lot...
-Eat more.

1211
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:51,204
You should give some to Sang Yeol.

1212
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:54,238
It's better than throwing it away.

1213
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:04,476
Throwing it away is better.

1214
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:09,480
Ah, che..

1215
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:11,392
Hey, aren't you overdoing it?

1216
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:12,393
You.

1217
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:15,455
Who do you think you're yelling at?

1218
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:19,022
Why are you protecting him?

1219
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,266
There's something going on between you two, right?

1220
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:23,337
Why are you acting like this?

1221
01:27:24,339 --> 01:27:25,363
What a shame.

1222
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:28,367
If you take a look at him, he's a total player.

1223
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:32,243
Hey, the maintenance guy asked about you.

1224
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,345
What relationship are you in with the maintenance guy?

1225
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:37,911
Ah really... You're really using your looks to your advantage.

1226
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:43,253
You guys are really beautiful.

1227
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:53,332
If there's trouble with anything, they all come to me.

1228
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:55,366
That's how I grew so old.

1229
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:56,470
I took care of all of them...

1230
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:58,339
You should have stopped me.

1231
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:02,241
You knew everything. Hyung, you're really bad.

1232
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,336
I'm sorry.

1233
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:08,242
You should have told me ahead of time.

1234
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:10,476
Look at me now.

1235
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:13,453
You liked her so much.

1236
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,347
And they broke up.

1237
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:21,353
You're life is really ruined from meeting one woman.

1238
01:28:23,129 --> 01:28:25,198
Do you call that comforting?

1239
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:30,304
Anyways, there are too many great people surrounding me.

1240
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:34,332
It sounds like

1241
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:37,273
your wife is bothering you.

1242
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:38,470
Feel better.

1243
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:42,113
It's possible that your wife could look at other guys.

1244
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,409
And the same goes for you too.

1245
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,219
Are we gods? We aren't.

1246
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,478
We can make mistakes.

1247
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:52,257
Honestly, it's fine

1248
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,527
just as long as your wife doesn't
get pregnant with another man's baby.

1249
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,299
-Am I wrong?
-Die!!

1250
01:28:59,267 --> 01:28:59,494
Let go! Let go!!

1251
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:03,470
No, no.

1252
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:11,311
I'm at the cafeteria on the first floor.

1253
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,281
I'm in the middle of my show.

1254
01:29:14,283 --> 01:29:15,007
Why?

1255
01:29:15,608 --> 01:29:16,608
Is something wrong?

1256
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:18,052
I'll wait.

1257
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:20,282
Let's talk.

1258
01:29:22,889 --> 01:29:24,413
It's been awhile.

1259
01:29:25,692 --> 01:29:27,284
Oh, hello Director.

1260
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:31,428
Have you been well?

1261
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:33,296
Yes.

1262
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:34,565
When are you due?

1263
01:29:35,966 --> 01:29:36,966
Next month.

1264
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:38,496
Is that so?

1265
01:29:39,297 --> 01:29:40,297
Then you should be free.

1266
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:44,343
Come by if you have time.

1267
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:46,437
Don't feel too burdened.

1268
01:29:47,038 --> 01:29:48,038
Yes.

1269
01:29:48,339 --> 01:29:49,339
Yes. Take care.

1270
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:58,282
[Park Joon Ho & Han Kyung Ah]

1271
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:02,359
So Yeon.

1272
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:04,560
Listen to me.

1273
01:30:07,634 --> 01:30:09,329
So Yeon!

1274
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:10,430
I was going to tell you.

1275
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:16,042
It's just my outer shell that's getting married.

1276
01:30:17,443 --> 01:30:19,443
Get your hands off of me. It's disturbing.

1277
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:28,146
Where are you going to go?

1278
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,354
Are you going to go to that imbecile?

1279
01:30:30,355 --> 01:30:31,355
Hey.

1280
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:32,350
Do you think you can go to that bastard?

1281
01:30:32,851 --> 01:30:33,551
That's not important.

1282
01:30:33,552 --> 01:30:34,352
Why wouldn't it be important?

1283
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:39,930
Hey. You were going to use that idiot
because you thought it'd be hard to live on your own with a baby.

1284
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,529
You can't go to him.

1285
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:45,205
I told him.

1286
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:47,474
That your child is mine.

1287
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:50,276
That's why that retard

1288
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:52,903
left you and ran away. Do you know that?

1289
01:30:57,518 --> 01:30:59,349
You coward!

1290
01:31:00,254 --> 01:31:01,322
Who are you calling a retard?

1291
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:04,923
You can't even compare him to people like me or you, you garbage!

1292
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:16,463
Trash?

1293
01:31:17,564 --> 01:31:18,564
Then what does that make you?

1294
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:29,383
Ah...

1295
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:31,418
Dressing up like this,

1296
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:33,352
It really gives off a party atmosphere.

1297
01:31:34,353 --> 01:31:35,353
Honey.

1298
01:31:36,954 --> 01:31:37,954
How do I look?

1299
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:40,318
Does it look good on me?

1300
01:31:41,029 --> 01:31:41,961
Don't go around like this.

1301
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,228
Why?

1302
01:31:46,367 --> 01:31:47,425
It makes me nervous.

1303
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:49,793
Ah, you scared me.

1304
01:31:50,405 --> 01:31:51,107
You scared me.

1305
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:57,808
Why do you hit me? You're so cute. So cute.

1306
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:04,249
But why isn't this guy coming out? This is so annoying.

1307
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:05,550
I know.

1308
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:07,379
So annoying.

1309
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:10,180
Look at that.

1310
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:12,282
Look at how he is coming out slowly on purpose.

1311
01:32:12,428 --> 01:32:14,993
He wants to see me die of frustration.

1312
01:32:16,194 --> 01:32:18,094
He's a total gift set of hateful things.

1313
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:21,257
Ah.

1314
01:32:21,502 --> 01:32:23,566
What are you doing?

1315
01:32:23,572 --> 01:32:24,539
That man.

1316
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:26,340
I want to erase him from my life.

1317
01:32:37,017 --> 01:32:38,115
Ah, honey..

1318
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:41,185
I should have bought one size larger for my wig.

1319
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,288
-Why?
-It's tight. My head hurts.

1320
01:32:44,689 --> 01:32:45,689
It still looks good.

1322
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:50,689
Ahh.

1323
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:54,266
Alright, next time we'll take more time getting ready.

1324
01:32:54,603 --> 01:32:56,640
Of course, you bought it for me.

So Yeon is calling.

1328
01:33:01,442 --> 01:33:02,442
Don't answer.

1329
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:03,443
Don't answer it?

1330
01:33:05,714 --> 01:33:07,716
Ah really.

1331
01:33:11,285 --> 01:33:12,252
Sang Yeol! What do I do?

1332
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:13,511
Just leave it.

1333
01:33:14,388 --> 01:33:16,246
Hold on a minute. Wait.

1334
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:17,484
-Huh?
-That's a man, isn't it?

It's So Yeon.

You liar.

1337
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:22,318
Did you save the number under the name So Yeon?

1338
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:23,319
-Give it to me.
-Why?

1339
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:24,526
Let go!

1340
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:26,459
Hey. Who are you?

1341
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:29,426
-Ahh!
-If we don't answer you should hang up. Why do you keep calling?

1342
01:33:29,537 --> 01:33:31,505
Hello?

1343
01:33:31,505 --> 01:33:34,303
Are you a pervert? Who do you think you're moaning to?

1344
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:37,341
Hello?

1345
01:33:38,342 --> 01:33:39,342
The woman is moaning.

1346
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,548
Give it to me.

1347
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:44,449
Hello? So Yeon?

1348
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:49,481
-I think she's in pain.
-So Yeon! What's wrong?

1349
01:33:51,782 --> 01:33:53,782

Okay.

Yes, I got it.

1353
01:34:01,434 --> 01:34:02,434

-Is it that woman?
-So Yeon!

Hello? So Yeon, don't hang up.

1356
01:34:11,309 --> 01:34:13,909
Hello? Say something! So Yeon, say something.

1357
01:34:27,094 --> 01:34:28,083

-Do something. Please!

Just pull your car over to the side.

1371

Who are you to tell me whether or not to pull over?

1372

Wait, wait, wait...

1373

01:38:47,488 --> 01:38:49,319
What you see here is the neck meat.

1421
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:51,288
If you mean neck meat, it's here right?

1422
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:54,318
Yes, and on rainy days...

1423
01:38:59,433 --> 01:39:01,264
I want to eat some now.

1424
01:39:02,336 --> 01:39:03,303
Ah!!!

1425
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:08,375
You bastard!

1426
01:39:08,376 --> 01:39:09,376
You son of a bitch!

1427
01:39:12,346 --> 01:39:13,506
What is this?

1428
01:39:15,482 --> 01:39:17,245
Hey! Director!

1429
01:39:19,754 --> 01:39:20,812
Cut. Cut!

1430
01:39:20,889 --> 01:39:23,983
Camera 2. Show Host!

1431
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:26,984
You son of a bitch.

1432
01:39:31,067 --> 01:39:35,429
Ah, you viewers must be really

1433
01:39:35,502 --> 01:39:37,231
surprised right now.

1434
01:39:37,438 --> 01:39:38,370
Ah, because

1435
01:39:38,573 --> 01:39:40,067
we couldn't call the customer,

1436
01:39:40,775 --> 01:39:42,338
The consumer came here in person.

1437
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:45,274
Yes, orders cannot be connected here.

1438
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:46,438
Please call the ARS number.

1439
01:39:51,285 --> 01:39:52,309
What did you do to So Yeon?

1440
01:39:53,253 --> 01:39:54,277
You pile of garbage!

1441
01:39:55,322 --> 01:39:57,415
Let go.

1442
01:40:15,416 --> 01:40:16,416
The door is opening.
[Emergency Surgery room.]

1443
01:40:20,414 --> 01:40:21,381
Doctor.

1444
01:40:22,282 --> 01:40:23,271
How is she?

1445
01:40:24,318 --> 01:40:25,376
It's a girl.

1446
01:40:26,353 --> 01:40:27,285
A daughter?

1447
01:40:27,488 --> 01:40:29,353
Not a son, a daughter?.. No no..

1448
01:40:29,523 --> 01:40:31,491
How is the mother?

1449
01:40:38,265 --> 01:40:39,323
The mother,

1450
01:40:39,324 --> 01:40:40,324
lost a lot of blood.

1451
01:40:42,302 --> 01:40:45,328
We have to watch over her tonight to monitor her condition.

1452
01:40:47,307 --> 01:40:50,276
Right. You should see your daughter.

1453
01:40:50,477 --> 01:40:52,342
Your daughter takes after you.

1454
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:32,283
You're so pretty, my Bok Ddang.

1455
01:41:32,519 --> 01:41:34,214
Pretty.

1456
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:38,324
It's nice to be out, right?

1457
01:41:46,366 --> 01:41:47,492
I'm sorry.

1458
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:54,366
Daddy is sorry.

1459
01:41:55,442 --> 01:41:57,307
I was wrong.

1460
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:05,877
You look so pretty.

1461
01:42:30,511 --> 01:42:33,040
One year later.

1462
01:42:42,356 --> 01:42:45,257
Oh my, our little Sarang is putting pretty clothes on.

1463
01:42:48,262 --> 01:42:50,492
Sarang. Why are you so shy?

1464
01:42:51,398 --> 01:42:53,332
Auntie. I'm Auntie.

1465
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,265
Don't cry.

1466
01:42:58,405 --> 01:43:01,238
Oh my, it stopped in one go. How cute.

1467
01:43:01,475 --> 01:43:04,038
Auntie my ass.. You're an uncle.

1468
01:43:05,245 --> 01:43:06,439
A big uncle.

1469
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:10,415
This is certainly a sight.

1470
01:43:10,484 --> 01:43:11,508
There, there.

1471
01:43:11,509 --> 01:43:12,509
No, no, I won't hurt you.

1472
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:19,321
Are you a woman?

1473
01:43:20,327 --> 01:43:21,487
Not really a woman...

1474
01:43:21,562 --> 01:43:24,062
Your voice.. Is this a male or a female?

1475
01:43:25,299 --> 01:43:26,391
Omo! What are you doing?

1476
01:43:28,302 --> 01:43:29,462
Omo! I was invited here.

1477
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:34,340
See! Good things happen when you listen to me.

1478
01:43:39,246 --> 01:43:40,235
Ahjusshi.

1479
01:43:40,447 --> 01:43:42,438
Your eye patch is on the other side.

1480
01:43:43,383 --> 01:43:44,407
It's on the same side.

1481
01:43:45,385 --> 01:43:48,286
Ay.. last time it was on the right.

1482
01:43:48,488 --> 01:43:50,251
I'm telling you it's right.

1483
01:43:51,391 --> 01:43:52,358
No it isn't.

1484
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:54,318
It's on the right side.

1485
01:43:54,528 --> 01:43:58,059
Do you want to bet me? What do you want to bet?

1486
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:59,160
Yeah, how about our eyeballs?

1487
01:44:01,366 --> 01:44:02,434
There's no need to bet the eyeball...

1488
01:44:02,635 --> 01:44:03,635
Where are you going?

1489
01:44:04,438 --> 01:44:05,462
I...

1490
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:07,432
Even the doctors said there was no hope.

1491
01:44:07,433 --> 01:44:10,133
Why? Because the child was so weak in the womb.

1492
01:44:10,277 --> 01:44:12,472
Anyways, drink this deer blood!

1493
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:15,245
A grandma can have a baby too.

1494
01:44:17,051 --> 01:44:18,211
Today's highlight!

1495
01:44:18,212 --> 01:44:20,006
Grab the Silver Spoon!

1496
01:44:20,013 --> 01:44:23,713
I am really curious as to what our Sarang will grab.

1497
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:26,488
Ok. Shall we find out what our Sarang's dream is?

1498
01:44:27,494 --> 01:44:29,561
Here, Sarang.

1499
01:44:29,665 --> 01:44:30,859
Grab the one you want.

1500
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,631
Ah not that. She keeps wanting to take the mic.

1501
01:44:41,475 --> 01:44:44,273
It looks like our Sarang has something she wants to say to you.

1502
01:44:46,346 --> 01:44:47,313
Oh!

1503
01:44:48,448 --> 01:44:50,416
It looks like she is looking for her mother.

1504
01:44:51,318 --> 01:44:52,285
Where is her mother?

1505
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:55,420
You shouldn't do that..

1506
01:44:56,323 --> 01:44:57,290
Ah, I made a mistake..

1507
01:44:58,458 --> 01:44:59,482
I...

1508
01:45:10,237 --> 01:45:11,363
Honey! What's wrong?

1509
01:45:12,406 --> 01:45:14,271
Honey! Calm down. Calm down.

1510
01:45:14,508 --> 01:45:15,475
-Relax.
-Honey!

1511
01:45:16,343 --> 01:45:17,310
Honey! I feel like it's going to come out!

1512
01:45:18,245 --> 01:45:20,270
Okay, okay.

1513
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:21,412
Oh, oh, okay.

1514
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:23,373
It's today again?

1515
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:25,478
Hey, hey!

1516
01:45:27,354 --> 01:45:28,343
The car, car.. car!

1517
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:33,283
Honey, breathe. Breathe!

1518
01:45:35,362 --> 01:45:36,226
Breathe. In out.

1519
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:38,227
Quit torturing your wife you rotten fool.

1520
01:45:38,432 --> 01:45:41,463
What was the need to rush and get her pregnant again?

1521
01:45:41,468 --> 01:45:42,536
Be quiet. Please!

1522
01:45:42,637 --> 01:45:44,637
She should have a day of rest too, you rotten fool.

1523
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:46,406
It's not like that.

1524
01:45:46,407 --> 01:45:48,907
What's not like that? You rotten fool!

1525
01:45:49,309 --> 01:45:51,243
-You always watched such sexy and weird things..
-Be Quiet, Please!

1526
01:45:51,411 --> 01:45:53,275
You do the same thing even when you get married.

1527
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,805
Ahhh!

1528
01:45:56,083 --> 01:45:58,847
-My hair! My hair!
-Pull it all out! You rotten fool.

1529
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:00,351
Pull it all out!

1530
