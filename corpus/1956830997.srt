01:28:45,469 --> 01:28:48,491
(Trudie)
THERE MAY BE NO SUCH THING
AS A PERFECT JOB,

1902
01:28:48,527 --> 01:28:51,191
A PERFECT FAMILY,
OR A PERFECT LIFE.

1903
01:28:51,227 --> 01:28:53,600
BUT THERE IS SUCH A THING
AS A PERFECT MOMENT.

1904
01:28:53,636 --> 01:28:55,254
SO I TAKE BACK
WHAT I SAID.

1905
01:28:55,289 --> 01:28:59,606
DOING ONE CRAZY THING
PROBABLY DOES MAKE YOU CRAZY,

1906
01:28:59,642 --> 01:29:01,634
BUT IT CAN ALSO
MAKE YOU HAPPY.
