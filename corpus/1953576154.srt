1
00:00:01,657 --> 00:00:04,683
Who was the patron saint
of lost children?

2
00:00:04,827 --> 00:00:08,729
The sick, abandoned,
neglected, abused?

3
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:13,302
Their flesh thin as gauze,
too penetrable.

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:20,306
Always balling when l try to sleep.
Fist hugging the hem of my nightgown.

5
00:00:20,443 --> 00:00:25,847
Haunting my dreams. Forlorn ghosts
with questions dripping from their eyes.

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,283
l hope some angel's looking out for them.

7
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:39,619
- Think she's gonna found out?
- Nobody's going to find us here.

8
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:55,410
...to Zona. Yeah, Zona.

9
00:00:55,544 --> 00:01:00,504
Give me ten points. Yeah, l know.
l know l owe you from last week.

10
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,019
l know, l know... This guy's
got nothing to do with Serelli...

11
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,424
l can remember a time when every
city street would lead me back to you.

12
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:16,657
When the road signs guided me home
and l was never lost.

13
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,530
l don't know how it got scrambled,
but now the roads lead nowhere.

14
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,731
The streets are dead ends and
l'm running in the wrong direction.

15
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:29,641
Sometimes, Janie, l think l'm
getting close, but l'm still so far away.

16
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:40,279
This is a story about
what it's like to be lost,

17
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:43,984
just minutes away from your own home.

18
00:01:44,126 --> 00:01:48,563
l don't know if this story's over yet
but this is how it began.

19
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:05,876
Listen now, l want my money.

20
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:11,282
l don't wanna hurt you but l'm gonna
have to and if l hurt you, l'll hurt you bad.

21
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,014
You hear what l'm saying,
pretty boy?

22
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:20,287
Hey, Jon, it's me, man. What's going on?

23
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:25,128
l saw Leo. He seems pissed.
Wherever you are, stay there, all right?

24
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:31,932
Jon, l don't know where you are,
but you need to come home.

25
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:34,872
You need to come home.
She's really bad.

26
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:38,538
And l'm very worried
and l can't handle it myself.

27
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:41,809
l think you need to get home right away.

28
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,839
How long is it gonna take you
to get here? You're doing nothing.

29
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:08,409
Come over here. l haven't eaten yet.

30
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:11,980
l'll meet you in front of the building.
C'mon.

31
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:14,082
l wanna get out of here.

32
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:51,215
lsn't that the guy who owes Leo money?
What the hell is he doing here?

33
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:15,200
l've already said that's exactly my point.

34
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:19,578
C'mon, be careful.

35
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:24,379
- Stand over here.
- You know what? l can do this myself.

36
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,044
OK.

37
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,725
- No, l'm gonna do it myself...
- Janie!

38
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,794
Well, look who's decided
to grace us with his presence.

39
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:40,993
My goodness!

40
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:47,800
- Stop this.
- What? You run out of money?

41
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:52,942
- Or is it Leo?
- lt ain't Leo. l came home for you.

42
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,710
l came home for us. l'm here.

43
00:04:58,654 --> 00:05:01,020
l came for you. C'mon.

44
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:07,321
Well, look what l've got for you.
We have a phone bill, some insurance.

45
00:05:07,463 --> 00:05:10,489
- Stop it.
- l have the gas bill, the electric...

46
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:14,091
- Stop...
- We have the rent. All this just for us.

47
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:16,704
- Don't you touch me.
- Stop it.

48
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,036
Hey, stop it. Cut it out!

49
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:22,836
- Don't you touch me.
- Cut it out.

50
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,345
- Don't ever touch me.
- Go outside.

51
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:29,144
- You happy now?
- Go outside.

52
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:32,951
Go sleep it off.

53
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:36,224
Go outside.

54
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:42,887
- What?
- You are dead, dead, dead, dead.

55
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:47,602
And l'm dead.

56
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,639
Go wait outside.

57
00:05:51,507 --> 00:05:55,238
l'm sick of this. Every time
l come home it's the same thing.

58
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:57,913
She's nuts.

59
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:25,707
Where you been?

60
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:29,171
l can't do this any more.

61
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,711
Every time l come back it's the same...

62
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:36,443
Every time you come back?
You sound like you're doing her a favor.

63
00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:40,487
Hey. Look, babe,
l appreciate your helping her. l do.

64
00:06:40,623 --> 00:06:44,650
l know she's not well but...
You don't understand.

65
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:51,024
l do understand. l understand
that you don't have a pot to piss in.

66
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:57,266
l understand you go off and live your
life and leave her here. lt's not fair.

67
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,016
l know you love her. l love her.
But she hasn't healed.

68
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:18,124
lt doesn't help that she works at that
hospital. She brings it home every day.

69
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:23,426
Jon, you're her husband.

70
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:28,401
Yes, you are.

71
00:07:28,537 --> 00:07:31,665
Have you got it all figured out now?

72
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,235
You make me sick.

73
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:41,080
Why don't you have another drink?

74
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:46,050
Go on, get a couple of your happy pills.
Make the world go away.

75
00:07:56,665 --> 00:07:59,065
l'm very happy.

76
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:02,136
Can't you tell how happy l am?

77
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:04,637
Can't you tell
how happy l am?

78
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:32,326
So happy.

79
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:39,635
- So, when did you get back?
- A couple of hours ago.

80
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:43,233
- How long you staying?
- l don't know what l'm gonna do.

81
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,007
- l don't know what to do.
- About Leo?

82
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:49,446
No, worse. lt's Janie.

83
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:53,648
Oh, Christ. Still?

84
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:57,582
Oh, man. l'm sorry, man.

85
00:08:57,726 --> 00:09:03,096
Listen, if you need a place to crash,
l'm still at the Chelsea.

86
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:08,834
She's nuts, man. l...

87
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:14,505
l just can't be held responsible
for this any more.

88
00:09:14,643 --> 00:09:19,080
You don't have to.
We've been through this before.

89
00:09:19,214 --> 00:09:24,151
Lest l remind you. She gets a little
wacked out then the next day, she's fine.

90
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:27,778
lt's like nothing happened.
Forget about it.

91
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:31,825
The problem is l don't have
the energy for this any more.

92
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,157
Maybe if it was ten years ago,
it would be different.

93
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:37,697
She was stronger, l was stronger.

94
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,858
Do you still love her?

95
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:42,368
Yeah, l still love her.

96
00:09:42,504 --> 00:09:45,064
Are you still having sex with her?

97
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:50,737
You, my friend, need a little adventure.
You need another drink.

98
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,747
Jamie. Another round, my friend.

99
00:09:54,883 --> 00:10:00,685
l remember when l first met her. She had
these eyes that looked right through me.

100
00:10:00,823 --> 00:10:03,087
She knew me like a book.

101
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:06,126
And the sex... The sex was good.

102
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:10,459
''ln sickness and in health...
For better, for worse...''

103
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:13,898
The thing is,
they don't tell you about the sickness.

104
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:19,531
Yeah. Listen man, l love you but talking
to me about this is not gonna help.

105
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:22,405
This is how women work
their problems out.

106
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:27,311
l'm serious. This has been the same
thing since ancient prehistoric times.

107
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:31,783
The cave man and the cave woman
would have a big blow up.

108
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,552
The woman gets all emotional because
she needs to get it out, to yell, scream.

109
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:42,221
She gets together with the other
women in the tribe and they dance.

110
00:10:42,364 --> 00:10:44,059
She feels better.

111
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:48,898
But the man, Mr. Troglodyte,
and this is where you come in.

112
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:51,767
- You know where he goes?
- No, tell me.

113
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:56,173
- He goes into the cave.
- What are you saying?

114
00:10:56,311 --> 00:11:02,477
lnto the darkness. lnto his own
little cave, by himself, alone.

115
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:05,143
And he works his shit out.

116
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:09,115
Go with God speed.

117
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:54,529
Would you like a private dance?

118
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:25,515
Get out of your houses, children of God.
Get out and come to Jesus.

119
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:29,146
Judge not, lest ye be judged.

120
00:14:29,524 --> 00:14:36,088
And Jesus said a man ought to love
his wife as he loveth his own body.

121
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:40,361
And he that loveth his wife,
loveth himself.

122
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:43,733
And for that cause
a man shall leave his father,

123
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:45,999
and he shall leave his mother

124
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:52,080
and he shall be joined together
with his wife as one in flesh.

125
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:55,316
Those are the words of the Lord.

126
00:14:55,884 --> 00:14:58,785
Come out of your houses,
children of God.

127
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,289
Come out of your houses
and come to Jesus.

128
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:07,223
And Jesus said to his disciples,
he said,

129
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:12,322
a man ought to love his wife
as he loves his own body.

130
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:15,903
A man who loveth his wife,
loveth himself.

131
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:22,636
And for this cause, a man shall leave his
father and he shall leave his mother...

132
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:11,492
Can l get you to roll down that window?
You are a little ripe.

133
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:17,128
- Tough night.
- l guess so.

134
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:21,295
What? A dog pee on you?

135
00:16:21,436 --> 00:16:25,167
Stop drinking that wine, man.
lt'll rot your gut.

136
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:30,108
- lt dulls the pain sometimes.
- Oh. You in pain, man?

137
00:16:33,315 --> 00:16:37,149
lt means you're human.
Only dead people have no pain.

138
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,595
You awfully quiet. ln the morning,
you come out from behind some dubry.

139
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:52,700
Why did l pick you up?

140
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:57,596
Oh well, you're cute. You're
too young for me so don't get nervous.

141
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:01,835
You like the movies?

142
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:06,041
- Yeah.
- Saw a great movie last night.

143
00:17:06,181 --> 00:17:08,741
Had Muhammad Ali in it. You know him?

144
00:17:08,884 --> 00:17:11,512
- Yeah.
- Well, you look young.

145
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:14,850
When you're my age,
you have to ask those questions.

146
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,619
lt was really great.
When l was a kid, he was the greatest.

147
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,129
You know why he was great?
Because he knew how to get down.

148
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:26,860
They'd hit him and hit him.
He'd get right back up.

149
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:31,530
No question about it.
No question of surviving with him.

150
00:17:31,673 --> 00:17:35,905
That's what life is about. You get
knocked down, you gotta pop back up.

151
00:17:36,044 --> 00:17:40,538
You just gotta flow back. Like a river,
you gotta keep going forward.

152
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:46,143
You can't back up, unless you're
a salmon, then you swim upstream, but...

153
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:49,655
l don't think it's a human thing.
You really quiet.

154
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,385
Are you nervous? l'm a good driver.

155
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:55,325
Move!
Sorry, l don't mean to get like that.

156
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:59,490
People just upset me out here, cos
they can't drive. They're from Jersey.

157
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:02,000
You're not from Jersey, are you?

158
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:06,972
You married?

159
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:09,076
- Yeah.
- ls she cute?

160
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:12,409
- Yeah.
- You love her?

161
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:15,143
Yeah.

162
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:19,242
- Were you out all night?
- Yeah.

163
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:22,413
You want me to stop
and get some flowers for her?

164
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:23,524
No.

165
00:18:23,658 --> 00:18:26,957
You got to give her flowers.
You got to give her flowers.

166
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:30,030
You got to say, ''l'm sorry.
l made a mistake.''

167
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:32,793
Cos you know it was you,
or you'd be home.

168
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:35,960
lf it wasn't you, you wouldn't
have stayed out.

169
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:39,733
So, you've gotta be a bigger man.
You gotta keep getting up.

170
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:44,004
And even when she say's, ''Go away!''
cos white girls are dramatic,

171
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:47,046
you gotta come back
and stay with her.

172
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:52,983
- Gotta learn how to take a hit, huh?
- Gotta learn how to take a hit.

173
00:18:55,523 --> 00:18:59,391
- l'll get the hang of it. lt's just up here.
- Cool.

174
00:19:00,195 --> 00:19:04,256
Go see that movie with Muhammad.
lt'll teach you a lot about life.

175
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:20,771
He built a house around me.

176
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:23,782
Strong beams rooted in earth.

177
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:26,944
And smooth walls, rich with color.

178
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:31,024
And a canopy of sky.

179
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:33,252
Windows reveal a new view.

180
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:36,729
ln their reflection,

181
00:19:36,865 --> 00:19:41,598
my mouth smiles back,
its curves relaxed.

182
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:45,797
And the bed, soft as a welcoming hand.

183
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:50,769
l, who all my life,
had made my home in rented rooms,

184
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:55,076
the carpets crusted with
the leavings of prior occupants,

185
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:57,548
now have an address.

186
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:02,418
This house he built.
This street paved with our love.

187
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:26,505
l'm sorry.

188
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:35,848
Me too.

189
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:51,054
What's happened to us?

190
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,503
l'm just feeling a little lost, these days.

191
00:22:12,587 --> 00:22:15,055
l hate you sometimes.

192
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:19,388
l hate that you leave me.

193
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:23,096
l hate you when you come back.

194
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:26,629
And then sometimes...

195
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:30,497
...l don't even want you to come back.

196
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,676
lt's just me, babe.

197
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:40,804
You deserve better.

198
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:52,350
Yeah.

199
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:55,663
So do you.

200
00:22:57,031 --> 00:22:58,999
And so do you.

201
00:23:29,797 --> 00:23:32,163
Maybe l lost my touch.

202
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:50,216
What the hell happened to you?
lt's about time you got here. Get in back.

203
00:23:50,351 --> 00:23:54,720
- Hey Jon, Leo came by looking for you.
- Oh, yeah?

204
00:23:54,856 --> 00:24:00,226
Boy, l'd hate to see that
pretty face of yours get all messed up.

205
00:24:01,763 --> 00:24:04,425
A shocking discovery
this morning in Manhattan.

206
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:07,557
A baby, barely a week old,
found in a dumpster.

207
00:24:07,702 --> 00:24:12,469
Police heard the child while responding
to a call near the West Side Highway.

208
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:14,802
The baby is resting in the hospital.

209
00:24:14,942 --> 00:24:17,206
Police have no idea who the mother is

210
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:21,338
or how her baby ended up
abandoned in the trash.

211
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:27,448
Change the channel, Harry.
Put on the games.

212
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:31,251
- What a weird broad she is.
- Sick son of a bitch.

213
00:24:31,392 --> 00:24:36,091
- What kind of woman would do that?
- Somebody knows.

214
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,028
Somebody knows something.

215
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:41,294
They're gonna pay.

216
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:45,372
They think God closed his eyes
and the world got mean.

217
00:25:15,603 --> 00:25:18,834
l never imagined
she would be so perfect.

218
00:25:18,973 --> 00:25:21,806
That every day,
l would glimpse another miracle.

219
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:27,074
She makes me humble. The way her
eyes gleam like the moon in negative.

220
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:31,345
The way her body reaches out
to the world, eager to touch and smell

221
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:34,250
and taste every part of it.

222
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:39,918
She trusts completely as if the whole
world were as full of love as she is.

223
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:43,360
And l want so much
to make that true for her.

224
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:58,903
Topping our newscast an update on
the abandoned baby found in the trash.

225
00:25:59,046 --> 00:26:01,241
Police made the discovery this morning.

226
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:04,909
A newborn left in a dumpster
near the West Side Highway.

227
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:09,682
Doctors say the baby had slight bruises,
but is resting comfortably in the hospital.

228
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:12,952
Police don't know how long the baby
had been there,

229
00:26:13,094 --> 00:26:17,963
where the mother is, or how her child
wound up in the cold, alone.

230
00:29:46,707 --> 00:29:49,904
- What's happening to us?
- What the hell do you mean?

231
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:52,945
- We're lost.
- You're the one who's lost.

232
00:29:54,482 --> 00:29:57,383
Come back here.
l'm not finished with you yet.

233
00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:11,149
l gotta go to work.

234
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:15,788
Sit and talk to me, Janie.

235
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:20,325
Well, l gotta catch the bus. lf l don't...

236
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:24,693
- There's other buses or the train.
- No, l really can't.

237
00:32:27,735 --> 00:32:32,434
Maybe later or something but
they're expecting me, so l've gotta go.

238
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:43,541
When are you gonna quit that shit job?

239
00:32:44,585 --> 00:32:46,951
Look what it's doing to you.

240
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:53,055
l've gotta go.

241
00:32:57,665 --> 00:33:00,691
Just sit and talk to me, will you, please?

242
00:33:03,737 --> 00:33:05,705
l gotta go.

243
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:12,309
Fucking talk to me, will you?
Take the coat off and talk to me.

244
00:33:12,446 --> 00:33:15,074
This is not going to bring her back. OK?

245
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:18,947
Whatever you're doing to me
is not going to bring her back.

246
00:33:19,086 --> 00:33:21,054
You gotta talk to me.

247
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:31,093
- Come on.
- You weren't...

248
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:34,531
You weren't supposed to break the rules.
You promised me.

249
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:38,695
- You're breaking the rules. You're not...
- Stop it. Stop it.

250
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:42,006
Listen to me. Stop it.

251
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:49,475
l can't do this. l really need to go.
OK? l really need to go.

252
00:33:50,184 --> 00:33:52,379
You need to let me go now.

253
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,987
- Listen...
- Let me go, now!

254
00:33:55,122 --> 00:33:57,920
Let me go, now! Let me go!

255
00:34:16,877 --> 00:34:20,677
l want my coat. l want my coat.

256
00:34:21,415 --> 00:34:25,784
l want my coat. Just gimme my coat.

257
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:28,682
- Go.
- My coat on.

258
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,785
Put my coat on.

259
00:34:33,093 --> 00:34:35,391
Put my coat on and...

260
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,396
l'm gonna go. That's what l'm gonna do.

261
00:34:38,532 --> 00:34:42,093
l'm gonna put my coat and l'm gonna go.

262
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,076
Are you gonna be here
when l get back?

263
00:35:00,154 --> 00:35:04,591
l gotta go. l gotta go.
That's it, l gotta go.

264
00:35:11,532 --> 00:35:12,999
Winter now.

265
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:18,263
lts icy fingers reach beneath
the frame of one solid door,

266
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:23,707
beneath the blankets that shroud our
bed, into the ventricles of my heart.

267
00:35:23,844 --> 00:35:28,304
All color is frozen out.
My face, grey, the streets, grey.

268
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:33,148
The voices that creep through
the phone lines are grey.

269
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:37,087
No sap runs through me.
No current of life.

270
00:35:37,224 --> 00:35:40,091
Like Demeter, my daughter
has been stolen from me.

271
00:35:40,227 --> 00:35:44,357
Exiled to hell and l condemn
the world to perpetual winter.

272
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:48,267
At night l hear her in my dreams.

273
00:35:48,402 --> 00:35:50,336
She calls:

274
00:35:50,471 --> 00:35:52,029
''Mummy''.

275
00:35:52,172 --> 00:35:56,700
Her voice echoes through the dark and
l rise to go to her as l always have.

276
00:35:56,844 --> 00:36:00,905
My feet grey on
the ice-slick floors of the house.

277
00:36:02,716 --> 00:36:05,947
l run from room to room
but every one of them is empty.

278
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:08,452
The walls draped in frost.

279
00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:11,990
l hear her calling beyond the windows
but the door is stuck.

280
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:14,890
l can't get out. l'm trapped here,

281
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:17,827
without her on the other side.

282
00:36:18,632 --> 00:36:23,797
And there he is,
like a frigid god without compassion.

283
00:36:26,673 --> 00:36:29,642
- Daddy, Daddy.
- Come on, Caitlin.

284
00:36:29,777 --> 00:36:31,745
Come here, pumpkin.

285
00:36:50,197 --> 00:36:52,256
''Let go'', he tells me.

286
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:55,731
You've got to accept.

287
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:59,305
But it's not his womb
that's turned to glacier.

288
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,843
She never lived inside his body
as she did in mine.

289
00:37:03,977 --> 00:37:05,842
As she still does.

290
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:16,416
The heart will never beat
unless l breathe.

291
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:21,560
Baby cries until her mother holds her.

292
00:37:21,695 --> 00:37:24,858
The mother holds her
until the winter thaws.

293
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,597
Jane.

294
00:37:31,238 --> 00:37:32,796
Hey, Jane.

295
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:59,797
The dark birds in my head
flapping their wings...

296
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:02,231
...and every shadow in my brain...

297
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:06,066
...their cries raise the tiny hairs
along my spine...

298
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:09,835
...like debris shattering inside my skull
and set my teeth on edge...

299
00:38:09,977 --> 00:38:15,813
...they're dive-bombing,
locked together in mortal combat...

300
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:18,884
...these are the birds that spatter
the walls of my brain with blood...

301
00:38:21,188 --> 00:38:24,385
lt kills me to see the pain in your eyes.

302
00:38:24,525 --> 00:38:27,619
But it wasn't our fault, Janie.
We're not to blame.

303
00:38:28,629 --> 00:38:30,790
What can l do?

304
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:33,229
What can l say?

305
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,405
Pretty boy, you know who this is?

306
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:44,875
How come you never
came to see me with the money?

307
00:38:45,012 --> 00:38:46,639
You think l'm playing games?

308
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:52,309
l know where you are and l'm gonna use
your head for a baseball.

309
00:42:48,054 --> 00:42:49,817
She just...

310
00:42:51,091 --> 00:42:54,390
She just needed somebody
to take care of her.

311
00:43:01,501 --> 00:43:03,526
Oh, God!

312
00:43:04,471 --> 00:43:06,439
She's a baby.

313
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,703
l love you.

314
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:20,017
lt's OK, honey. lt's OK.

315
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:23,020
Yeah. lt's all gonna be OK now.

316
00:43:24,257 --> 00:43:26,748
lt's all going to be OK. Yeah.

317
00:43:27,594 --> 00:43:31,257
Don't cry. You don't have to cry.

318
00:43:31,665 --> 00:43:33,462
l'm sorry.

319
00:43:34,267 --> 00:43:35,529
Come.

320
00:43:36,937 --> 00:43:40,532
Come inside. Come inside.

321
00:43:54,054 --> 00:43:57,512
l realized l didn't care
about the consequences.

322
00:43:57,657 --> 00:44:02,492
l only cared about her,
cos you can't run forever.

323
00:44:02,629 --> 00:44:07,293
l can't tell where this road will lead.
lf it's the beginning or the end.

324
00:44:07,434 --> 00:44:09,994
All l know is l'm on my way to you.
