1
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,095
You want to put
some money on it?

2
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,031
I'm telling you,
my brother can run faster

3
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,033
than all you guys.

4
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:36,602
He's so little.

5
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:39,071
All right, five bucks.
Let's go.

6
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:41,173
Hey, drew, come over here!

7
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,411
Ready, set, go!

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,717
Yeah, drew.

9
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,786
Nice job, there you go.

10
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:56,688
All right, you guys
all need to pay up.

11
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,458
No, no, no.
He cheated.

12
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,776
Mom?

13
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,580
Mom?

14
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,816
What's wrong with dad?

15
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,651
Dad!

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,754
Dad!

17
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:55,180
Good work,
and then two more!

18
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,352
You said four and we're done.

19
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,753
I meant six.

20
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,522
Or did you want eight?

21
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,190
Complaining again, Jacobs?

22
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,159
It's the same thing
every day, asshole.

23
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,528
You want to go for 12?

24
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,196
Yeah, sure, I'll go for 12.

25
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,198
We may lose whitehall.

26
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,840
Oh, <i> I'm </i> the loser?

27
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,375
No, I think <i>you're </i> the loser,

28
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,810
not like your brother.

29
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,479
What'd you say?
Hey!

30
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,515
Enough!

31
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,250
The hell with this.
You run the laps yourself.

32
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:33,285
You're done here.

33
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,686
Let the loser go.

34
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:41,493
Hey. Hey, drew!
Drew!

35
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,529
Eric's just being an ass.

36
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:44,830
Come back.

37
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,665
Come on.

38
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,568
Lisa! Come on back.
We don't need him.

39
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,336
Come on!

40
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,238
I'm done with this.

41
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:26,505
Go on, tell me what I missed.

42
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,507
Same old thing.

43
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,275
Whitehall's strides
are too long,

44
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,277
he needs to get up on his toes,

45
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,479
and that girl runs on her heels.

46
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,750
So you let that
Jacobs kid go, huh?

47
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,339
What's up, man?
What's up, man?

48
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,456
Drew.

49
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,459
I'm gonna need you
to pick something up
from Eli tomorrow.

50
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,731
Why don't you
get in the car
and do it yourself?

51
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,267
You know why.

52
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:34,339
A parolee can't be
driving on these runs.

53
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,907
Watch out.

54
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,443
Mom's salary doesn't
cover the mortgage.

55
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,313
You're gonna have to
start pulling your
weight around here.

56
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:44,349
And I don't want
to see Eli right now.

57
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,589
You don't have
the money, do you?

58
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,727
Hmm. You know...

59
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,332
These are terrible.

60
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:06,004
Ugh. Mm-mm.
Can't do it.

61
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:09,641
Oh, God.
I can't eat it.

62
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,319
Hey, sweetie.

63
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,524
Why don't you go to bed?

64
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,714
It's time for you
to get moving.
Let's go.

65
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,583
You know that's impossible.

66
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:27,519
I've tried it...
Many times.

67
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,688
Come on, let's go, ballerina.

68
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,530
So Eli's got a bag
for you, all right?

69
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,799
What should I say
about the money?

70
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,901
Just tell him
I couldn't get
down there today.

71
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,020
Hey, don't be too long.

72
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,023
I got something else for you.

73
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,892
Hey, Chuck.
I'm here to see Eli.

74
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,513
Flash.

75
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,715
Want the shit?
What's up, man?

76
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,250
You're making
a habit out of this.

77
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,752
It's just part
of your workout
routine now.

78
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,856
He runs all
the way here from
rainier valley, Chuck.

79
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,691
You got some money for me?

80
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,192
I'm just making
a pick-up for Wes.

81
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,094
Wes.

82
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,863
That name sounds familiar to me.

83
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,865
I feel like I know the guy.

84
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,000
He never comes around here
anymore, though.

85
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,902
I think he must be
mad at us, Chuck.

86
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,037
It's not like that, man.

87
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,943
Not like that?
He's busy.

88
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,945
It's not what you think.
He asked me to make
the pick-up...

89
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,647
he's busy?! <i> I'm </i> busy!

90
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,890
I hope I'm wrong,
but I think we both know

91
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,692
why he's not coming around here.

92
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,528
You know what I
can't get used to?

93
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,530
People making decisions for me.

94
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:55,267
Your brother's deciding
who picks up what,
when and where?

95
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,636
I don't want to see
your goddamn face
here, drew.

96
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,037
I don't want to see your face.

97
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,939
Tell your brother that.

98
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,941
You understand me?
Yeah.

99
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,277
Go on. Chuck will
sort you out.

100
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,714
Be careful with that.

101
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,822
Hey, Jacobs!

102
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,324
You ran all the way
from the docks?

103
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,760
Same clip?

104
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,829
Yeah, so?

105
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:00,799
That's about
a five-minute mile.

106
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,070
That your school bag?

107
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,750
Eli doesn't want me
making runs anymore.

108
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,885
He says he wants to see you.

109
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:27,125
You know,
he should really
stick to gutting fish.

110
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,695
Don't worry about me, though.

111
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,330
I'm a big boy.

112
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,266
A big boy can run
his errands himself.

113
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,335
You keep running
your mouth like that,

114
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,871
see where it gets you.

115
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,266
You letting that
Jacobs kid go...

116
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,169
that was a bonehead move.

117
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,938
I learned all my moves
from you, Coleman.

118
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,746
Drew, Lisa...

119
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:24,449
Would you like to share
your findings with
the rest of the class?

120
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,751
It's a trick question.

121
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,421
It's x - 4, not 6
like you put in
the formula.

122
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,024
That's right.

123
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,359
My dude!

124
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,860
Shut up, peanut.

125
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,832
What was that?

126
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,068
That?
That was easy.

127
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,003
That was easy?
Oh, okay.

128
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,404
Wow.
Excuse me.

129
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,174
My head doesn't work like that.

130
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,342
Um, I gotta go to
track practice.

131
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,044
I'll walk you.

132
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,716
Men's relay
is really struggling.

133
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:01,152
They could use you
out there.
It's not gonna happen.

134
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,388
I'm done with the team.

135
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,791
Besides, coach wouldn't
let me back.

136
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,127
I don't... Get you.

137
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,862
You could get a scholarship.

138
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,798
Not if it means
running for a jerk.

139
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,201
What do you know about Coleman?

140
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,038
I know he lives on my street,

141
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,473
hassles coach Rickard,

142
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,074
which makes him
all right in my book.

143
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,976
He used to coach track.

144
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,845
I heard he was pretty legendary.

145
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,813
Yeah, so?

146
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,516
Well...
Well what?

147
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,885
Well, he's not coach Rickard.

148
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,321
Lisa, I'm done with track, okay?

149
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:40,925
Besides, I don't think
Coleman's much use
anymore anyways.

150
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,928
He had this kid...
he was a bit older
than me.

151
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,965
And then one day he was gone.

152
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,000
Car accident.

153
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,440
What are you gonna do, drew?
Just gonna give up?

154
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,942
<i>All right, varsity girls.</i>

155
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,245
<i>Down on the field, let's go.</i>

156
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,899
Wes?

157
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,503
Wes.

158
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,550
Come on, man.

159
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,854
What?
Come on.

160
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,355
Let's go.

161
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:42,914
<i>30 yards, 20, 10...</i>

162
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,216
<i>He did it!</i>
<i>He broke the record!</i>

163
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:49,153
<i>William Coleman has broken</i>
<i>the state high school record!</i>

164
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,328
Wes!

165
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,131
Look at this lawn, God damn it.

166
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,432
How many times I gotta tell you

167
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,234
to mow the lawn, son?!

168
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:07,038
This goddamn lawn needs mowing!

169
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,307
It's a jungle out here!

170
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,209
Where's your goddamn lawnmower?

171
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,678
I'll do it myself.

172
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Look, I know I owe you money,

173
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,683
and I will
get you the money.
Just chill out.

174
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:22,287
So this is where
the magic happens, huh?

175
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:26,457
This is where you
smash your bitches?

176
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,359
You know, I'm embarrassed.

177
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,295
I'm embarrassed.

178
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:33,531
You're embarrassing me.

179
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,033
Sit down.

180
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,237
Oh, what's up, drew?

181
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,272
That's the guy right there.

182
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,341
Big drew.

183
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,544
That's our boy.
That's the future.

184
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:47,679
He's a keeper.

185
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,384
Oh, hey, cool.
Baseball cards.

186
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,687
We should trade.
Chuck, do you
collect?

187
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,023
Flash, tell Chuck

188
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,060
about your brother's
ball-playing days.

189
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,462
This guy...

190
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,065
he could really play, seriously.

191
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:11,302
Talented.
The whole package.

192
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,005
Could never hit that
changeup, though,
could you?

193
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,406
Well, I'm not playing!

194
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,682
I want my money.

195
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,061
You think
a five-minute mile
is fast?

196
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,500
Well, if you run
ten of them, yeah.

197
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,474
But you can't run with a temper.

198
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,676
You gotta be in control.

199
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,611
Or you beat yourself.

200
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,814
Well, I never
get beat, so...
no?

201
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,549
You're not on the track team
anymore, are you?

202
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,117
I'd say you got beat.

203
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,488
But you are fast.

204
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,624
Fast enough to win state?

205
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,593
State fair, maybe.

206
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,197
Quit worrying about
who you're gonna beat.

207
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,199
Running's not about that.

208
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,670
Running's running.
That's it.

209
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,271
Is it?
Yeah.

210
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,440
Oh. Jeez, I'll have
to read your book.

211
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,779
Want to prove me wrong?

212
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,216
Ballard locks, 5 P.M.

213
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,751
Magnolia side.

214
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,840
Get in the water.

215
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,643
Get in the water.

216
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,812
What?

217
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,213
Get in the water.

218
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,449
Seriously?

219
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,518
Go on, get in the water.

220
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,853
Go on.

221
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,490
Why do I have to...
get in the water.

222
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,626
That's great.
Thank you.

223
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,327
Okay, that's good.

224
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,263
That's good, that's good.

225
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,166
Okay, see you those rocks
down there?

226
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,268
Run there and back
in 15 seconds.

227
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,803
That's it?

228
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,572
You do 100 of them.

229
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,643
Clock's running.

230
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:39,877
Go.

231
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,322
18. Doesn't count.

232
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,825
What do you mean,
it doesn't count?

233
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,527
Don't look at me. Go.

234
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,467
Ah.

235
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,243
That counts.

236
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,583
Yeah.

237
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,685
How many...
how many have I done?

238
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,854
How many?

239
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,490
54.

240
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,827
That's it.
I can't do it.

241
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,395
You done?
I'm done.

242
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,997
I can't do any more.

243
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,534
Where are you going?

244
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,270
I was right.

245
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,575
This stuff's impossible, man.

246
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,744
Hey!

247
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,719
come on, I need you
to come with me.

248
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:36,954
So get up, let's go.

249
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,559
Let's go.

250
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,006
This fool owes me
a lot of money.

251
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,742
So just keep your eyes peeled.

252
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,744
You see anything, let me know.

253
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,469
Where is the money? Huh?

254
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,937
In the sofa.

255
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,810
There we go.
That wasn't hard.

256
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,148
This what you're looking for?

257
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,017
Huh? This? Yeah,
I don't think so.

258
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,554
Clean that shit up.

259
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,091
Let's go. Let's go!

260
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,031
Look, if I didn't
need your help,
I wouldn't ask for it.

261
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,000
But it was worth it.
Look at that.

262
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:57,568
Mmm.

263
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,563
I finished it.

264
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,135
Even though I bonked.

265
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:40,244
You bonked?
Ha ha ha!

266
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:43,047
Do you have any idea
what bonking is?

267
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:46,183
You didn't bonk.
You got lazy.

268
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,785
When you bonk,

269
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:49,987
your muscles just
run out of gas.

270
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,123
You got nothin', nothin'...

271
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,892
But your heart.

272
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,596
Hmm.

273
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,665
But...

274
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,802
I've never seen anybody

275
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,837
do more than 50 of
those shuttle runs.

276
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,541
Why'd you leave?

277
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:11,543
Uh...

278
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,516
Tell someone
they can't do it,
and they won't.

279
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,052
Running's not just physical.

280
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,854
It's in your head.

281
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,233
Um...

282
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,272
What do you know about boats?

283
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,123
Which one's yours?

284
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,891
We're walking to it.

285
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,162
What's with the leg?

286
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,236
You know the water's
that way, right?

287
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,605
Aren't you chatty?

288
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,140
Sweet, huh?
Wow.

289
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,875
Yep. A couple
of repairs,

290
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:19,610
I think I'll take her to Alaska.

291
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:20,978
Think this boat's
gonna make it
to Alaska?

292
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,680
Get up there and wait for me.

293
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:25,349
Go on, don't touch anything.

294
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,818
I gotta see somebody
in the office.

295
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,920
You wait for me.

296
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,006
Thank you.

297
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,247
This guy makes me run in water,

298
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:34,785
and then he takes me
to his boat and
drops me off.

299
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,654
Sounds like he's
a senile old man.

300
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:40,057
Guess his glory days
are behind him.

301
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:42,893
Could still be
your best shot
at college, though.

302
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,428
Let's play some basketball, yo.

303
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,965
I think I'm done
with it anyways, man.

304
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:51,201
All right, let's go.

305
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,022
Are you quitting?

306
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,098
You don't much like
being told what to do,
do you?

307
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,733
You don't listen, either.

308
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:25,102
I heard. You told me
to wait, and I did.

309
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:28,839
I had to see if you
were worth my time.

310
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:31,141
Guess I got my answer.

311
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,847
You still can't even
tell me why.

312
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,819
Patience.

313
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,991
It takes a lot of it
to be a runner.

314
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,811
Are we going to the track?

315
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:09,079
Absolutely not.

316
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,916
I have my own special place.

317
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,395
What are you doing?

318
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:28,432
What the hell's it
look like I'm doing?

319
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,069
These are coaching shoes.

320
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:35,439
Coaching shoes. Right.

321
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,278
All right.

322
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,415
Run down to the big
white ship, turn left.

323
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,818
That's your first interval.
You get one minute's rest.

324
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,154
Then the next 1/4 mile.

325
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:51,955
Then you go all the way
around these docks.

326
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,991
All the way... come here.

327
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:56,260
Now, see the pole
with the sign on it?

328
00:29:56,262 --> 00:30:01,899
That's one square mile
to the inch right there.

329
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:05,068
All right?
All right.

330
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,970
You start at the cleat.

331
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,906
Okay?
All right.

332
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,314
Go.

333
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,032
What was my time?
Don't worry about it.

334
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:38,235
Was it under 50?
Not that fast.

335
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:41,171
Look, you got
one minute to rest.

336
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,908
Hey, slow down.

337
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,211
You look like you just
robbed a bank.

338
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:49,880
Focus on each quarter,
pace yourself.

339
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:52,216
Quarter of what?
Mile.

340
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:54,551
Who's running the mile?
You.

341
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,353
No, I run the 400.

342
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,156
Listen, you want a scholarship?

343
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:01,258
You want to go
to college?
Yeah.

344
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,027
Then you run the mile.
The mile's your race.

345
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,496
You run it fast enough,
you can go anywhere you want.

346
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:09,132
Can back on the line.
Focus on each quarter.

347
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,301
I just told you...
get back on the line.

348
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,177
Now.

349
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,274
Oh, that's it.

350
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:52,242
That's it.

351
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,611
You averaged 67.
That's not bad.

352
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,580
I'm dying. I'm dying.

353
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,148
You're not even close.

354
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,683
You gotta run these in 58.

355
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:02,119
All 10 in exactly 58.

356
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:05,188
Ohh, God, this hurts so bad.

357
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,957
Everything hurts!

358
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,994
That's what's holding you back.

359
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,698
The pain.

360
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,070
You gotta learn
to overcome it.
You gotta embrace it,

361
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,272
run through it.
Then you can let it go.

362
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,544
Run through it, right.
Run through it.
I'm dying!

363
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,313
God, you're aggravating
to be around sometimes.

364
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:31,581
Jesus!

365
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,298
Aah!

366
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,633
God!
Mom?

367
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:41,718
Drew.

368
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,459
He wouldn't
let us take him
to the hospital.

369
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:53,430
Yeah, well, it seems like
you have a pretty good
handle on it.

370
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:56,299
What should I do?

371
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:59,436
I don't know.
Call the cops.

372
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,687
Want to walk with me?

373
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,092
What happened to you, gimpy?

374
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:23,593
It's a long story.

375
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:26,596
What's that?

376
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:29,132
This is an early
acceptance letter

377
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:32,302
to Cal Berkeley's art program.

378
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,237
That's great.

379
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,339
Congratulations.
That's great.

380
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:37,641
Thank you.
It's awesome.

381
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,550
It's expensive.
And with my family...
they can't afford it.

382
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,385
If I don't get that scholarship,

383
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:50,821
this doesn't really matter.
It's...

384
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:52,789
Bittersweet.

385
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:55,692
Uh, but I can always
become a street artist

386
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:58,628
if it doesn't work out.
At least I'm not gimpy.

387
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,465
That's true, that's true.

388
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:04,167
Well, I think you're
very talented,

389
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,770
so I think you'll be fine.

390
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,675
Seriously, what happened?

391
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:13,844
What's with the leg?

392
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,216
I'm actually training again.

393
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:20,650
You're running?

394
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,752
Yeah.

395
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,355
I've been training with Coleman.

396
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,659
I'm impressed,
Mr. Jacobs.

397
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,396
In your hectic running schedule,

398
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:36,199
do you have time
for a birthday party?

399
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,801
Yeah.

400
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,903
At my house?
Yeah, of course.

401
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,607
It's, um...
it's Friday night.

402
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,575
Friday night.
Mm-hmm.

403
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:46,877
I'll be there.

404
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,778
Bye.

405
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,652
You're made
for the mile,
not the 400.

406
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,287
And the sooner you realize that,

407
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,822
the better off you're gonna be.

408
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,891
I'm running the 400.

409
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,804
Drew?

410
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,676
Found.

411
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,913
Ohh, boy.

412
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,750
Let me see the guitar.
Come on.

413
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,459
This is it?

414
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:39,329
That's it. Everything.

415
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:42,432
This is the last time,
man, I swear.

416
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,937
I'll sing you a little
running-away song.

417
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:48,672
Goes a little something
like this.

418
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,707
A-one, a-two,
a-one, two, three.

419
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,288
hey, lazy George,
you on break again?

420
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,358
Let me get one of those.

421
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,367
We good?

422
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:20,237
Yeah.

423
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,405
Hey, Calvin,
go help our boy out.

424
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,277
Hey, for this week.

425
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:29,446
Flash.

426
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:31,781
Good for this week.

427
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,553
You know, if I'm your brother,

428
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:39,723
I wouldn't send you around
to see a guy like me.

429
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:41,891
You wouldn't understand.

430
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:45,595
Try me. Try me.

431
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,964
Oh...

432
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,699
That's for you.
Look.

433
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,036
That's for you.

434
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:58,308
What'd you think?
This is over?

435
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,543
You were done?
You think that's it?

436
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,780
No, it's not like that.

437
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:07,050
You're in this now.
You, me and Wes...

438
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:08,952
we're in it together.

439
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,524
Would you like a cigarette?

440
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,393
Give him a cigarette.

441
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:18,662
Good for lung capacity.

442
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,990
He ain't here.
So you can just...

443
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:50,994
Turn around and
shuffle on home.

444
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,364
What a prince.

445
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,866
Wheeler-dealer, huh?

446
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:58,601
I know what's going on here.

447
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,537
I know who you are and
where you're headed.

448
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,008
Just don't take
your brother with you.

449
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,747
Ah, you're so pathetic.

450
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,549
What's that? Hmm?

451
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,827
We've got a deal, right?

452
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:27,063
Yeah, we've got a deal.

453
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,566
If I don't win,
next time I'll run
the mile,

454
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:31,735
not the 400.
Yep.

455
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:33,103
I'm not losing this one.

456
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,078
Training again.

457
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,514
Watch and learn.

458
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:48,651
All right, let's boogie, folks.

459
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,887
We've got a special guest
in the 400 today.

460
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,623
You all remember
Mr. Jacobs.

461
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,092
Runners, to your marks.

462
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,864
Set.

463
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:05,735
Go!

464
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,153
Come on.

465
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,693
Come on, whitehall.

466
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,200
There you go.

467
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,847
Took you long enough.

468
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,802
You can't beat whitehall
in the 400.

469
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,205
But if you train hard
and listen to me,

470
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:17,674
you'll be a great miler.

471
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,603
Hey, drew!
You made it, man.

472
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:48,872
Good to see you.
What's crackin'?

473
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:51,508
What's up?
Good?

474
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,610
You're being all antisocial.

475
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,245
Bad race, right?

476
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,015
Sorry, man.

477
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:03,186
Hey, chill out, man.
Chill out, man.

478
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,521
It's a party.

479
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:05,688
You need a drink.

480
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,923
Come on, man.
Yeah.

481
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:08,157
Come on, baby, let's go.

482
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,526
It's gonna be a good night.

483
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,261
Hey, Lisa.

484
00:42:11,263 --> 00:42:12,862
Can I borrow her for one second?

485
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,598
Hey, drew's here.
Let's go. Let's go.

486
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,903
Hey, can I talk to you
really quick, please?

487
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:21,971
Are you sure?
She's fine.

488
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,907
Hey, how are you doing?
I'm good.

489
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,675
You look really sexy tonight.

490
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:27,677
Hey, Eric, what the hell?

491
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,712
Get out of here, man.
Are you serious?

492
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,281
Get the hell out, man.

493
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:33,950
Get off him, man, come on.

494
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,288
Chill, man.

495
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:40,924
Drew.

496
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,141
Come back in.

497
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,146
He's gone. He had
way too much to drink...

498
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:05,615
don't make excuses for him.

499
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:06,983
He's got his hands all over you.

500
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:08,618
You're just gonna
let him do that?

501
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,255
Actually, I was about to...

502
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:16,159
Take down whitehall myself.

503
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:19,729
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

504
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:21,331
So you're tough now?

505
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:24,200
Am I tough <i> now?</i>
Oh, like nails.

506
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:26,035
Like...
okay.

507
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:29,772
About as dangerous as this eye.

508
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,941
How is it?

509
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,843
Um...
Bad.

510
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:36,179
Really?
It's pretty.

511
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:51,294
I should go.

512
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,262
I gotta train in the morning.

513
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,868
I'm gonna get back anyway.

514
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,203
Okay.

515
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,146
Good night.
Good night.

516
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,399
Coleman?

517
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:31,167
You home?

518
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:41,344
You forget practice?

519
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,912
Some kind of a test again?

520
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:04,367
It's a nice collection.

521
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:09,939
You listen to all these?

522
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,757
This your son?

523
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:29,892
What?

524
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:36,833
Were you as hard on him
as you are on me?

525
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:39,001
He must've hated you.

526
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:44,507
You have no right
to talk about my son.

527
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,344
That's my son.

528
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,074
What happened to your eye?

529
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:22,245
I fell.

530
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:24,981
You fell?
Yeah.

531
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:27,083
Oh.
Yeah.

532
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:41,564
You fell?
Yeah.

533
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:43,432
Hey...

534
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:45,935
I hope she was worth it.

535
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,364
You're still here, huh?

536
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,026
How fast to get
a scholarship
to u.C. Berkeley?

537
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:47,296
You don't have a chance.
You don't listen.

538
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:50,166
It took me this long
to get you to do the mile.

539
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:52,268
What if I run it in four?

540
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,075
I'll do whatever you say.

541
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,559
Don't cook anymore.

542
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,496
Ugh.

543
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,344
You got something.

544
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,383
You got...

545
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:42,485
you got something in here.

546
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:45,454
It's so deep in there.

547
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:49,025
And you gotta beat it.

548
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:52,028
You gotta face that fear.

549
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,330
You've got to.

550
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:57,300
Because if you don't,

551
00:48:57,302 --> 00:48:59,402
you're gonna be me.

552
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:04,307
And, buddy, you don't want that.

553
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,245
But if you do,

554
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:12,248
I don't care if you
never run another race
in your life,

555
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,617
because if you do
face that fear,

556
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,653
it'll change your life.

557
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,224
I promise you.

558
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:25,394
It's the hardest thing
you'll ever have to do.

559
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:28,130
But you gotta do it.
Oh, you gotta do it.

560
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,199
And then...

561
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:32,601
You'll be able to push
right through the pain.

562
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:36,005
You'll go right
through the door.

563
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:38,474
And when you're
about ready to pass out

564
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,443
and your legs can't move
and your lungs can't breathe

565
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:42,411
and your eyes can't see,

566
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:44,413
you'll know that it's
just the beginning.

567
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:50,586
And it's so beautiful.

568
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,521
It's beautiful.

569
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:01,030
That's all I've been
trying to teach you.

570
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:02,698
Okay?

571
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,400
Okay.

572
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,404
Okay.

573
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:10,039
Okay.

574
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,047
When do you want to start?

575
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,766
You're gonna carry
that tire underwater.

576
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:42,304
That side to this side,
20 times.

577
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,752
That's a start.

578
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,821
Next time, you do it in one go.

579
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:57,146
All right.
63, not bad.

580
00:51:57,148 --> 00:52:00,549
Not bad? That's
four seconds faster
than when I started.

581
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,738
That was impressive.

582
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,642
I hate to break it to you,

583
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:01,810
but I don't think
this boat will
make it to Alaska.

584
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:04,246
Oh, you don't?
Why don't you just...

585
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:07,416
Shut up and keep working?
How about that?

586
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:09,318
Why am I doing all the work?

587
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,288
Well... Uh...

588
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:15,858
Wax on, wax off.

589
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,839
That's really good.

590
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:35,444
Remind me again
why I couldn't
have the steak.

591
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:37,580
You're not building
muscle today.

592
00:53:37,582 --> 00:53:39,715
So... Here,
I'll give you that.

593
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:42,218
Oh, thank you.
I don't eat it.

594
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,786
I think I'm done.

595
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:45,621
Can I get you guys
anything else?

596
00:53:45,623 --> 00:53:48,357
A little more of this
lovely pasta, darling.

597
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:52,394
Keep eating. Mmm.

598
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,867
So...

599
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,737
How's it going with you
and that girl?

600
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,407
We're just friends.

601
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,511
What?

602
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:11,347
Eh...

603
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:12,514
What?

604
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:14,650
Oh, grow a pair.

605
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:21,357
Why don't <i> you</i> grow a pair?

606
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,574
Come out. Come on.

607
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:51,854
It's so early.
I know.

608
00:54:51,856 --> 00:54:54,323
You up for a run?

609
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,427
That's actually pretty fast.

610
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,462
Oh, is it?

611
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,527
I didn't know that you played.

612
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:33,796
I can play a song.
Would you like
to hear a song?

613
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:35,597
I would love to hear a song.

614
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,733
It's, um, not about you.

615
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,960
<i>And it's Charles St. James</i>

616
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:14,730
<i>leading the pack on lap 3.</i>

617
00:57:14,732 --> 00:57:17,599
He already has the state record.

618
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:20,903
His coach thinks he'll
break four minutes
this year.

619
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:22,838
Am I gonna have to race him?

620
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,140
You're gonna have to
beat him at regionals.

621
00:57:25,142 --> 00:57:27,643
Only the winner goes to state.

622
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:29,978
<i>St. James</i>
<i>now increasing his lead</i>

623
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,147
<i>as they come around</i>
<i>for the final lap.</i>

624
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:34,483
My, oh, my.

625
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:37,686
You know, I really
appreciate you coming over.

626
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:41,223
I know you've been spending
a lot of time with drew, and...

627
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:48,597
why are you doing this?

628
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:51,867
Well...

629
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,839
Because he's fast.

630
00:57:56,841 --> 00:57:58,707
He's fast?

631
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:00,108
Oh, he's fast, yeah.

632
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,148
He's a really good kid.

633
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:12,688
Um, I used to be a photographer.

634
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,923
And this little boy

635
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:17,159
used to sit for me for hours.

636
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:18,660
No.
Oh, yeah.

637
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,562
He was a great subject.
Really?

638
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:25,133
But he would get so angry.
Oh, my God.

639
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:26,935
So surprising.

640
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:28,270
I was six years old.

641
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:30,005
You were wonderful.

642
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,874
I got some beautiful images.

643
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:34,710
Did you do these?
Yeah.

644
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:36,879
What is that bottom one?

645
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:38,514
That's me.

646
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:39,982
That cute boy.
Fucking miserable.

647
00:58:39,984 --> 00:58:42,251
Oh, I loved photographing...

648
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:45,921
Hey.

649
00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:48,257
Hi, mom.
Hey.

650
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:52,127
What's he
doing here? Hmm?

651
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:54,530
What's he doing here?

652
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,766
Wes.

653
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,235
What's he doing here?

654
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:01,970
Hmm?

655
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,009
No, sit your ass down, old man.

656
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:08,243
Punk.

657
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:09,711
What are you doing?

658
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,847
No, no, no.

659
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,028
So what's for dessert?

660
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:33,268
James, I am so sorry.

661
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,304
I don't know what to do.

662
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,946
Look, I'm sorry, too.
I...

663
00:59:43,948 --> 00:59:47,583
I don't want drew to
end up like his brother.

664
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:52,287
But if he keeps running
and he stays focused,

665
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:55,190
he can get away from all that.

666
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,929
Eli's money.

667
01:00:33,931 --> 01:00:36,965
I need you to run it
to him tonight.

668
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:41,370
You go yourself.
I got a meet tomorrow.

669
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:44,406
Good luck.

670
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:46,742
You're still gonna
run it to him.

671
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:50,345
Right now. Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

672
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:01,156
This isn't all of it, right?

673
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,723
You're short.
Looks like about half.

674
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,874
If you were me,

675
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:55,077
tell me what I'm
supposed to do here.

676
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:57,245
What would you do?

677
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,717
Hmm? What?

678
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:10,125
You leave. But this
is not over for you.

679
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:12,961
It's not over for your brother.

680
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,313
<i>The winner of today's race</i>

681
01:02:31,315 --> 01:02:34,816
<i>will go on to compete</i>
<i>at the state championships.</i>

682
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:41,056
Stay with him...
Whatever it takes.

683
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:44,059
You give it everything.

684
01:02:44,061 --> 01:02:47,028
Now's the time, son.

685
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:49,064
Leave everything on the track.

686
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:02,110
Runners, take your marks.

687
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,956
<i>And into a smooth start</i>
<i>is Charles St. James,</i>

688
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,992
<i>as he goes out in front.</i>

689
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:23,999
Keep up!

690
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:26,334
<i>And newcomer drew Jacobs</i>

691
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:29,337
<i>is staying right on</i>
<i>St. James' tail.</i>

692
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,553
Come on, drew. Come on.

693
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,535
Atta-boy.

694
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:19,988
Come on.

695
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,393
Keep up. Go!

696
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:44,312
<i>And it's St. James.</i>
<i>Another great time.</i>

697
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:53,088
<i>Charles St. James is going</i>
<i>to the state championship.</i>

698
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,417
Coleman.

699
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:26,221
You quit.
You pulled up. You quit.

700
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:27,956
Quit? That was
the race of my life.

701
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:31,293
Well, you quit.
You gave up, I saw you.

702
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:34,129
Look, I don't know
if could've beaten
the guy or not.

703
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:36,364
That's not what
I asked you to do.

704
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:40,101
What I asked you to do
is give it everything
that you had.

705
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:43,939
Someday you're gonna
look back on this time,

706
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:45,941
and you're gonna hate yourself.

707
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:48,209
Because you didn't push harder,

708
01:05:48,211 --> 01:05:51,146
you didn't try harder,
you didn't take this
incredible opportunity

709
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:53,014
that's been given to you.

710
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:59,120
But now you got nothin'.

711
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,222
And you've given me
no reason to continue.

712
01:06:01,224 --> 01:06:04,125
There's no state
championship. I'm done.

713
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:09,464
You're done with me?

714
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,102
I don't know why I ever
listened to you, man.

715
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:18,440
Why don't you take
a look at yourself?

716
01:06:18,442 --> 01:06:20,508
You got nothin'.

717
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:23,244
You got no family.

718
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:25,213
So why don't you just go back

719
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:27,482
to that piece-of-shit
rat hole of yours

720
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,384
and drink yourself to death?

721
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,612
How could you send me to Eli's?

722
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:03,251
How could you
send me there, Wes?

723
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,390
He's gonna come after us.

724
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:10,225
You know that, right?

725
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:13,428
I told you not to
worry about Eli.

726
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:15,030
He likes to make threats and...

727
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:17,365
and cut you open.

728
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:20,135
He is nothing special, drew.

729
01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:23,304
When are you gonna stop
lying to yourself?

730
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:26,541
Lying to myself?
You're one to talk,

731
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:28,276
because that old man
over there...

732
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:30,478
he is not our father, drew.

733
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:39,154
I lost the race.
Thanks for asking.

734
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:28,436
Are you upset about the race?

735
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,873
I'm fine.

736
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,809
I know you're fine.

737
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:37,779
I just need to be
alone right now, okay?

738
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:43,585
I get having bad days.

739
01:08:43,587 --> 01:08:46,221
But if it's about
something else, you can...

740
01:08:46,223 --> 01:08:48,256
you can talk to me about it.

741
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:52,293
Talk to you?
Hey, what do you
want me to say?

742
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:56,397
You don't understand
the first thing about
what I go through,

743
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,467
so just go back to
your little doodles
and your perfect life.

744
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,336
I don't need to be fixed, okay?

745
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:03,204
I'm not some pity project.

746
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:09,878
I didn't think
that you were one.

747
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,626
Drew, get up.
We gotta go.

748
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:00,962
Drew, we gotta go.

749
01:10:00,964 --> 01:10:03,198
I'm not going anywhere, Wes.

750
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:07,435
Drew...
Don't piss me off,

751
01:10:07,437 --> 01:10:08,903
not today.

752
01:10:08,905 --> 01:10:10,572
What are you gonna do?

753
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:13,975
Get your ass up!

754
01:10:13,977 --> 01:10:16,444
Do you want me out of
this house, is that it?

755
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:19,614
You gotta let go
of this pathetic
little dream of yours!

756
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:22,217
Wes!
Get off of me!

757
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:25,453
Stop it!

758
01:10:28,525 --> 01:10:30,858
What was I supposed
to do when dad died?

759
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,794
What was I supposed to do?

760
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:34,796
Let's this family
fall apart? No.

761
01:10:34,798 --> 01:10:37,999
I'm the one who took
care of everybody!

762
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:52,280
<i>You got something in here.</i>

763
01:10:52,282 --> 01:10:54,649
<i>It's so deep in there.</i>

764
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:57,719
<i>And you gotta beat it.</i>

765
01:10:57,721 --> 01:11:00,955
<i>You gotta face that fear.</i>
<i>You've got to.</i>

766
01:11:00,957 --> 01:11:06,694
<i>It's the hardest thing</i>
<i>you'll ever have to do.</i>

767
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:09,931
<i>If you do,</i>
<i>it'll change your life.</i>

768
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:15,503
<i>You'll be able to push</i>
<i>right through the pain.</i>

769
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:17,872
<i>Open that door.</i>

770
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:22,744
<i>And when your legs can't move</i>
<i>and your lungs can't breathe</i>

771
01:11:22,746 --> 01:11:25,480
<i>and your eyes can't see,</i>

772
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:28,549
<i>you'll know that it's</i>
<i>just the beginning.</i>

773
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:18,059
I did it.

774
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,128
I did it.

775
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:22,697
I ran...

776
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:25,733
And I ran, and I ran.

777
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:31,873
And I faced it.

778
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,146
And then I just
broke right through.

779
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:44,919
And it was so beautiful.

780
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:50,191
You were right.

781
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:52,193
Wow.

782
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:54,162
Good for you.

783
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:00,435
You did it on your own.

784
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,473
And that's just the beginning.

785
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:10,945
Ohh.

786
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:16,017
Will you do this for me?

787
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:20,154
You still want to break
four minutes?

788
01:14:20,156 --> 01:14:22,523
Hey...

789
01:14:22,525 --> 01:14:24,792
You don't need me.

790
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:27,695
I'm asking for your help.

791
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:31,999
You bet.

792
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:36,137
You bet.

793
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:45,980
No more riding in cars
for you, son.

794
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:29,257
Coleman said you could
use a running partner.

795
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:30,958
Did he?

796
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,061
He's gonna need
all the help
he can get.

797
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:36,597
Look, about the other day...

798
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:39,734
you can make it up to me later.

799
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:42,904
Want some water?

800
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:45,172
Oh. Oh.

801
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:47,575
Jeez, I'm so sorry.
I keep...

802
01:15:47,577 --> 01:15:49,577
I'm just missing.
I'm missing.

803
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:03,057
Wes!

804
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:04,792
Wesley!

805
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:09,764
Wes!

806
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:21,309
<i>911. What is</i>
<i>your emergency?</i>

807
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:24,779
I think I made a mistake
treating you like family, Wes.

808
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:29,750
Stay inside.

809
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:30,985
Wes.

810
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:35,156
What the hell
are you doing here?

811
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:38,092
What do you think
I'm doing here, huh?

812
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,226
Huh?

813
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:43,164
Oh, a slugger.

814
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:46,067
Huh? Big hitter,
here he is.

815
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,905
That's more like it, big hitter.

816
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,208
Not in my house, man.

817
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:56,377
Who pays the bills
on this house?

818
01:16:56,379 --> 01:16:59,180
Huh? Everything you got
is 'cause of me.

819
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,020
Hey, flash, who pays
the bills on this house?

820
01:17:06,022 --> 01:17:07,355
Get back inside.

821
01:17:07,357 --> 01:17:08,956
How about I pop him in the leg?

822
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:12,093
Get back inside!
Go back in the house!

823
01:17:12,095 --> 01:17:13,828
Coleman!
Coleman!

824
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:17,064
Coleman!

825
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,667
Coleman!

826
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:22,103
Eli!

827
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:32,747
Coleman. Coleman!
Coleman!

828
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:35,249
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Look at me.

829
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:37,151
Wes, go get help, please!

830
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:40,187
Oh, God,
you're hit.
Oh, you're hit.

831
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:43,290
Coleman, hold on.
Where's my glasses?

832
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:46,160
Wes, please,
we need help, please!

833
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:49,797
Please! Hold on,
Coleman! Look at me!
Hold on!

834
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:51,932
Where's my glasses?
Look at me.

835
01:17:51,934 --> 01:17:54,335
Please.

836
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:57,071
Please. Look at me!

837
01:17:57,073 --> 01:18:00,107
Wes! Ohh!

838
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:11,052
Help!

839
01:18:11,054 --> 01:18:13,354
Please!

840
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:16,757
No! No!

841
01:18:16,759 --> 01:18:18,259
Please!

842
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:19,960
Please!

843
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:08,202
Hey.

844
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:20,014
Do you know what I'm best at?

845
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,456
Nothin'.

846
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,328
Not a damn thing.

847
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:39,400
I don't want you
to come back here.

848
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:47,007
Do not waste what you got.

849
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,654
Are you all right?

850
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:10,190
Yeah, I'm fine.

851
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:25,706
Thank you for coming today.

852
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:31,011
You didn't have
to miss the meet.

853
01:22:31,013 --> 01:22:34,381
I wouldn't be anywhere else.

854
01:22:34,383 --> 01:22:37,351
I wish you could've
gone, though.

855
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:39,620
I still think you could've
beaten St. James.

856
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:44,091
It's not about the meet.

857
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:48,062
It's not about winning.

858
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:52,299
It's not about
St. James.

859
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:03,110
There's something I gotta do.

860
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:17,591
<i> Welcome</i>
<i>to the Washington state</i>
<i>high school</i>

861
01:23:17,593 --> 01:23:20,761
<i>track and field championship.</i>

862
01:23:20,763 --> 01:23:26,200
<i>Today's the big day for all</i>
<i>the best high school runners</i>
<i>in the state.</i>

863
01:23:26,202 --> 01:23:28,335
<i>All eyes are on</i>
<i>Charles St. James</i>

864
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:31,638
<i>and whether he can break</i>
<i>the four-minute mile</i>

865
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,775
<i>and possibly beat</i>
<i>the state high school record</i>

866
01:23:34,777 --> 01:23:39,079
<i>held by the late all-star</i>
<i>miler William Coleman.</i>

867
01:23:57,098 --> 01:24:00,167
I'm a poor substitute
for Coleman.

868
01:24:00,169 --> 01:24:02,436
But since he can't be here...

869
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:08,042
this counts as much
as the state meet to me.

870
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:23,690
How did you know?

871
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:29,563
I knew you'd do this for him.

872
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:37,671
Take this.

873
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:52,486
Okay.

874
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:32,826
Three, two, one... Go.

875
01:25:47,575 --> 01:25:52,646
<i>St. James is once again</i>
<i>taking the lead early.</i>

876
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:30,918
<i>And as we move into lap 2,</i>

877
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:34,421
<i>St. James still staying</i>
<i>within record time.</i>

878
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:05,752
<i>Last lap.</i>
<i>St. James is still first.</i>

879
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:37,451
<i>He's giving it all he can!</i>
<i>He wants this record!</i>

880
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:52,466
<i>St. James at 4:02!</i>

881
01:27:52,468 --> 01:27:55,335
<i>The record is still</i>
<i>up for grabs!</i>

882
01:28:02,011 --> 01:28:04,044
3:57.

883
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:29,536
<i>Welcome to the n.C.A.A.</i>

884
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:33,707
<i>Collegiate track and field</i>
<i>championship.</i>

885
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:39,646
<i>In Lane 1, we have</i>
<i>Mike spade from Denver.</i>

886
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:45,752
<i>In Lane 2, Charles St. James</i>
<i>from u.C.L.A.</i>

887
01:28:45,754 --> 01:28:51,758
<i>In Lane 3, drew Jacobs</i>
<i>from u.C. Berkeley.</i>

888
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,897
<i>In Lane 4,</i>
<i>Bob Jones, u.S.C.</i>
