AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT
YOU DO IT WITH NO LIP.

342
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:50,222
OR AS BUCKY--
AS YOU SO ELOQUENTLY SAID,

343
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,224
&quot;DON'T FUCK AROUND.&quot;
RIGHT?

344
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:56,695
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,
I WOULD LIKE YOU ALL TO
EMPTY YOUR POCKETS.

345
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:01,866
OH.

346
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:03,601
( gunshots )

347
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:10,875
OH GOD, THAT MUST HAVE
COME OFF AS REALLY CRASS.

348
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:13,277
UH, SIR?
COME HERE.

349
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,879
COME ON.
COME ON, COME ON.

350
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:17,682
OKAY, I-- I SHOULD EXPLAIN.

351
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:20,385
ALL RIGHT?
I GOT THIS LIST.

352
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:22,553
IT'S MY FIRST ROBBERY.
I BROUGHT ALONG A RUNNING ORDER

353
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:24,623
OF HOW THINGS SHOULD BE DONE
CORRECTLY, CHRONOLOGICALLY.

354
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,325
AND THIS LIST WAS MADE
BY THE BEST--

355
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:28,827
MR. LAVEL JOHNSON.

356
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,562
WHO THE FUCK IS
LAVEL JOHNSON?

357
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:33,965
HAVE SOME, UH, RESPECT FOR
THE DEAD, BUCKY.

358
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:35,967
SEE, FIRST I DID
#1, THE INTRODUCTION.

359
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,736
I SAID MY NAME AND
A FEW THINGS ABOUT ME.

360
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,772
AND THEN I DID #3--
THE INTENTION AND THE REQUEST.

361
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:43,441
YOU KNOW, I SAID
WHAT I WAS DOING AND WHAT
I WANTED YOU TO DO.

362
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:45,710
BUT YOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE,
RIGHT?  IS I SKIPPED OVER #2.

363
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:47,879
RIGHT?  THE SERIOUSNESS FACTOR,
WHICH INVOLVED WASTING A CLERK.

364
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:49,881
I MEAN, YOU DO THAT,
NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND IS
GOING TO GIVE YOU ANY SHIT.

365
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:52,417
&quot;AND IF YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE
NOT IN THEIR RIGHT MIND,

366
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,452
THAT'S CALLED DUMB LUCK.
YOU JUST GOT TO SAY A PRAYER

367
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:57,421
AND RIDE THAT STORM OUT&quot;--
LAVEL JOHNSON, 2004.

368
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:00,492
YEAH?

369
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,960
WHAT'S #4?

370
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:04,663
AH.

371
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,399
OH.
( laughs )

372
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,601
WE REALLY SHOULD JUST
PRESS ON.

373
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,616
SOME OF THE TITLES
ARE FUNNY.

374
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:26,418
JUST TAKE WHAT YOU WANT
AND GET OUT ALREADY.

375
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,086
HOW LONG IS THIS
GONNA FUCKING TAKE?

376
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:30,522
DON'T MISTAKE THE FACT
THAT I DID NOT KILL
THE STORE OWNER

377
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,824
FOR A SIGN THAT ANYBODY
IS IN CHARGE BESIDES ME.

378
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:35,327
DO YOU HAVE ANY OF
TRACI LORDS'S EARLY WORK?

379
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,462
- YOU LIKE TRACI LORDS?
- YOU TOO?

380
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:39,764
- YEAH.
- NO I DON'T.

381
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:42,834
IT IS ILLEGAL TO CARRY THEM.
SHE WAS 14 WHEN SHE MADE THEM,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

382
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:45,070
EXCUSE ME?
QUESTION.

383
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,539
YOU'RE ROBBING
A PORNO STORE?

384
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:48,939
WHAT OF IT?

385
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:51,676
WHY WOULD ANYONE
DO SUCH A THING?

386
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:52,644
( laughs )

387
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:55,612
MY OWN BUSINESS,
MY OWN REASONS.
THAT'S WHY.

388
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:57,882
WELL, YOU MIND IF I
THINK ON IT AWHILE?

389
00:21:57,915 --> 00:22:01,353
I'M AMAZINGLY RESOURCEFUL
WHEN IT COMES TO
THINGS LIKE THIS.

390
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:05,890
SURE, GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT.

391
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:09,527
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

392
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,830
- MR. JACK.
- SWEET STEPHEN.

393
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:15,767
I WAS TALKING TO MR. JACK,
SO YOU CAN SHUT YOUR CAKE.

394
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,403
- SHUT YOUR CAKE.
-<i> ( laughing )</i>

395
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,740
I LIKE THE ACCENT,
MR. JACK.

396
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,942
- LIVERPOOL.
- SORT OF.

397
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,844
- HE'S NOT FROM ENGLAND.
- CAKE!

398
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,812
NICE NAME YOU'VE GOT,
PHILLY.

399
00:22:28,846 --> 00:22:30,148
SHORT FOR PHILLIP?

400
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:31,983
- NOPE.
-PHILADELPHIA?

401
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:33,752
MINNESOTA BY WAY
OF MISSISSIPPI.

402
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,887
BIG CREAM-CHEESE FAN THEN?

403
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,023
HATE THE STUFF.

404
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,927
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU DON'T SEEM THE TYPE

405
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,662
TO FREQUENT SLEAZY
VIDEO STORES.

406
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:47,665
I'M GETTING IN TOUCH
WITH MY MANLY SIDE.

407
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:48,933
OH.

408
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:50,534
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

409
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:53,504
I'M MAKING ENDS MEET.

410
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,041
OR MAKING THE ENDS
JUSTIFY THE MEANS.

411
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:00,145
- WHAT?
-<i> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.</i>

412
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,047
YOU ROB A PORNO STORE;
YOU CARRY A LIST--

413
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,149
A LIST WRITTEN
BY A DEAD MAN.

414
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:08,853
<i> YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
 KILL THAT GUY, YOU KNOW?</i>

415
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:11,856
A FEW WELL-PLACED THREATS,
WE'D HAVE BEEN IN YOUR HANDS.

416
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:13,957
BUT YOU NEED TO
FOLLOW A LIST.

417
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:17,128
<i> DO YOU EVEN HAVE
 A GETAWAY PLAN?</i>

418
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:19,964
DILLINGER YOU'RE NOT,
MY FRIEND.

419
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:23,668
AND I'M SURE YOU'RE
AWARE OF THE MULTIPLE
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS?

420
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,808
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE I SHOULD START MAKING
MY OWN DECISIONS.

421
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,876
DECISIONS ON MY OWN.

422
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:34,679
I MEAN, I CAN JUST SEE
THOSE HEADLINES:

423
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:37,649
&quot;PORN STORE ROBBERY
BECOMES BLOODBATH.

424
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:38,917
NO SUSPECTS.&quot;

425
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,986
- NO, IT'S NOT IN YOUR NATURE.
- HE'S RIGHT.

426
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:44,856
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
&quot;MY ROBBERY WITH ANDRE&quot;?

427
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:46,690
JESUS CHRIST.

428
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:48,827
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I KILLED THIS GUY.

429
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,628
I HATE TO KEEP HARPING ON THIS,
BUT THE ONLY REASON

430
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,530
YOU KILLED THAT GUY WAS
BECAUSE OF THAT LIST.

431
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:53,865
FACE IT, MAN,
YOU'RE NO KILLER.

432
00:23:53,898 --> 00:23:55,966
IN ORDER TO KILL SOMEONE--
TO REALLY KILL SOMEONE,

433
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,802
- YOU'VE GOT TO WANT IT.
- Stephen: YEAH.

434
00:23:57,835 --> 00:24:01,139
HMM?  IF I KILL--
IF I KILLED BUCKY--

435
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:03,908
IF I-- IF I PUT
THIS GUN UP HIS ASS,
PULLED THE TRIGGER

436
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,710
TILL HIS COLON
SAID &quot;NO MáS&quot;...

437
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:10,581
COULD THE TWO OF YOU ADMIT
THAT I COULD BE A KILLER?

438
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:14,918
I THINK YOU COULD DO
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

439
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:17,889
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO
DO ANYTHING YOU DON'T WANT.

440
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:22,894
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT.

441
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:25,964
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT.

442
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,899

YOU'RE RIGHT.
I CAN'T KILL THIS MAN.

449

I DON'T-- I DON'T LIKE
LOSING IT LIKE THIS

00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,026
IN FRONT OF YOU PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW?

458
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,995
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO
BE THE ROCK,

459
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:33,698
THE ONE THAT TAKES IT
ON THE CHIN,

460
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:36,167
THE STRONG ONE,
THE ONE THAT PRESSES THROUGH;

461
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,737
SOME TOUGH GUY TO BE
THE FATHER,

462

464
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,210
SO IF I-- IF I LOSE IT
EVERY NOW AND THEN,

465
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:49,914

A LIVE TV SHOW, OKAY?

ROBBING THE SKIN TO WIN?

OH, I ALMOST FORGOT,

487
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:06,391
I GOT BUCKY'S STATEMENT
RIGHT BEFORE I TOOK YOURS.

HE SAID-- AND I'M PARAPHRASING
SO NOT TO OFFEND YOU TWO--

00:27:22,106 --> 00:27:24,042
LIKE A TALKING THING.

495
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,309
- LIKE WE...
- ...TALK OVER EACH OTHER?

496
00:27:25,342 --> 00:27:27,679
- NEVER.
- EVER.

497
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,848
YOU MADE A REAL MESS
OF OLD PHILLY BACK THERE.

498
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:33,051
LET ME GUESS:
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT, DID HE?

499
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,186
NO.  NO HE DIDN'T.

00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:38,956
I ALMOST SHIT IN MY PANTS
WHEN YOU SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD.

501
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:41,359
MIND YOU, WE WOULDN'T HAVE
HAD IT ANY OTHER WAY.

502
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:43,227
YOU TWO ARE
FUCKING STRANGE.

503
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,962
WELL, WE'RE FREE TO GO THEN?

504
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:47,298
NO.

YEAH, YOU CAN GO.

506
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,003
AH, YOU!

507
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:57,108
THERE'S SOMEPLACE
I GOTTA BE RIGHT NOW--
DISTURBANCE COMPLAINT.

508
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:59,077
I WANT TO THANK YOU,
TOMMY THE COP.

509
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:03,781
OF COURSE, ALL YOU REALLY DID
WAS WALK INTO A SITUATION

510
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:05,249
YOU HAD NO CONTROL OVER,

511
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:07,485
PULL OUT YOUR GUN,
FIRE IT

512
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:09,988
LIKE SAM PECKINPAH
JUST CRIED &quot;ACTION.&quot;

513
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,026
I GUESS THAT'S RIGHT.

514
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,964
<i> ♪ SOME HIT JACKPOT,

520
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:33,044
SO HEY, DO YOU KNOW
WHY PHILLY ROBBED
THE PORNO STORE OR NOT?

521
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:34,479
THE ANSWER IS YES.

522
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,181
AND IF YOU GAVE IT
SOME THOUGHT, YOU'D KNOW TOO.

523
00:28:37,214 --> 00:28:39,350
I DON'T LIKE THINKING.
YOU JUST TELL ME.

524
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:43,421
THE ANSWER IS ELEMENTARY,
MY DEAR STEPHEN--
EVIL BEGETS EVIL.

525
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:45,790
WELL, WHAT THE FUCK IS
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

526
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:50,495
IT MEANS THAT THERE IS
A LOGICAL AND NATURAL FORCE
IN THE WORLD.

527
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,463
IT PRESERVES
THINGS SPHERICALLY.

528
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:54,966
EVERYTHING THAT GOES AROUND
COMES AROUND.

529
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,301
WHAT GOES UP
MUST COME DOWN.

530
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:59,303
- YOU WITH ME?
- I'M WITH YOU SO FAR.

531
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:02,073
GOOD WORK AND HARD EFFORT
WILL UNDOUBTEDLY REAP REWARD.

532
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:04,442
DO SOMETHING GOOD; SOMETHING
GOOD WILL COME FROM IT.

533
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:06,276
- RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

534
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,446
WELL, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE--

535
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:11,149
DO SOMETHING WICKED;
SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES.

536
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,284
EQUATE THIS TO
THE FUCKING PORNO STORE.

537
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:15,787
WELL, CONTRARY TO
POPULAR BELIEF,

538
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,855
THE SELLING OF SEX IN
ANY FORM IS WRONG.

539
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:20,925
I'M NOT SAYING I AGREE WITH IT,
BUT CHECK YOUR BIBLE.

540
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:22,293
THEY'RE NOT GOING FOR IT.

541
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:24,295
IS MASTURBATION EVIL?

542
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:26,931
ACCORDING TO MY MOTHER, YES.
THANK GOD SHE'S DEAD.

543
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:29,066
<i> ♪ SOME HIT JACKPOT,
 SOME GET LUCKY ♪</i>

544
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:31,034
<i> ♪ SOME THEY RUN,
 THEY DON'T WANNA BE
 FUCKED WITH... ♪</i>

545
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:33,004
( screaming )

546
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,039
<i> ♪ SOME THEY RUN,

547
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:37,073

548
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:38,976

<i> ♪ SOME HIT JACKPOT,

552
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:48,285
SO THE VERY EXISTENCE
OF THE PORNO STORE WAS
CONCEIVED IN EVIL?

553
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,887
WICKEDNESS, YES.

554
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,589
AND BUCKY HAD SOMETHING
COMING TO HIM

555
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:53,858
BECAUSE HE SATISFIED MY DESIRE
TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE FUCKING.

556
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:54,959
VOYEURISM, CORRECT.

557
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:57,295
GENTLEMEN.

558
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,064
THOUGH IF PHILLY WAS SENT IN
TO EVEN THINGS OUT--

559
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:01,165
AN EYE FOR AN EYE--

560
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:03,467
WHY WOULD HE GET HIS HEAD
BLOWN OFF BY TOMMY THE COP?

561
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,070
THERE ARE VARIOUS LEVELS
OF EVIL.

562
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:08,372
SELLING PORNO IN A CRAPPY
LOS ANGELES HELLHOLE

563
00:30:08,405 --> 00:30:10,541
IS NOT AS EVIL AS ROBBING
THAT SAME PLACE

564
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:12,577
AND SHOOTING
AN INNOCENT CLERK.

565
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,178
THERE'S AN IMBALANCE THERE
AND THE FORCES OF NATURE

566
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:17,081
DON'T ALLOW FOR
THAT KIND OF THING.

567
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:20,318
SO BECAUSE THE EVIL
COMMITTED BY PHILLY

568
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,353
FAR OUTWEIGHED THE EVIL
COMMITTED BY BUCKY,

569
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:24,055
AN ARBITRATOR
HAD TO BE BROUGHT IN.

570
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,255
- AN INTERLOPER.
- TOMMY THE COP.

571
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:27,024
- PRECISELY.
- AND EVIL BEGETS EVIL.

572
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:28,560
BY GEORGE,
I THINK YOU'VE GOT IT.

573
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,232
<i> ( knocking )</i>

574
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,334
MISS SINCLAIR?

575
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:40,303
MISS SINCLAIR,
PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR.

576
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:43,107
MISS SINCLAIR?

577
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,009
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU GOT HERE.

578
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,944
I CALLED OVER
AN HOUR AGO.

579
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:48,946
MA'AM, I'VE ALREADY
KILLED ONE PERSON TODAY.

580
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:50,414
DON'T MAKE ME KILL ANOTHER.

581
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:53,050
( laughs )

582
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,853
( mimics laughter )

583
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,022
<i> SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?</i>

584
00:30:58,055 --> 00:31:00,491
WELL, I GOT THREE
PHONE CALLS-- THREE--

585
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:02,493
AT 3:00 A.M.,

586
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:05,029
<i>ALL NOISE COMPLAINTS.</i>

587
00:31:05,062 --> 00:31:07,998
THEY ALL SAID THEY
HEARD SCREAMS COMING FROM
THIS APARTMENT--

588
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,234
BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS.

589
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:12,503
AND YOU WENT
TO CHECK IT OUT?

590
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:15,072
NAH, WENT BACK TO BED
AND WENT TO SLEEP.

591
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:17,174
I FIGURED IT WAS NOTHING
THAT COULDN'T WAIT.

592
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:19,310
OF COURSE.

593
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:22,079
SO AFTER I HAD MY BREAKFAST
AND WENT FOR A WALK,

594
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,082
I CAME TO INVESTIGATE.
AND I KNOCKED AND KNOCKED
AND KNOCKED.

595
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:26,384
NO ANSWER.

596
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:29,486
AND HOW DOES SHE
SIGN HER CHECKS?

597
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,656
- WHAT?
- WHAT'S HER FULL NAME?

598
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:34,091
STEPHANIE SINCLAIR.

599
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:37,528
-<i> LIVES ALONE?</i>
- FAR AS I KNOW.

600
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:39,530
REPORTS OF SCREAMS, HMM?

601
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:42,133
- MM-HMM.
- HMM.

602
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,601
THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED?

603
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:47,705
WELL, MA'AM,
I HOPE SO.

604
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:50,275
( both laugh )

605
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:54,712
- BARETTA!
- WHAT THE FUCK?
  WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?

606
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:56,613
- YOU STEPHANIE SINCLAIR?
- WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?

607
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:03,087
SHE'S NOT STEPHANIE SINCLAIR.

608
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,322
- AW, FUCK IT.
- YOU'RE NOT STEPHANIE SINCLAIR.

609
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,658
GEE, IF I'M NOT
STEPHANIE SINCLAIR,

610
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:09,460
AND YOU'RE NOT
STEPHANIE SINCLAIR

611
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:11,529
AND THIS IS STEPHANIE
SINCLAIR'S APARTMENT,

612
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,131
THEN WHAT THE FUCK
ARE WE ALL DOING HERE?

613
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:18,569
WHAT MADE YOU SO SURE HE
WOULDN'T TURN OUR LIGHTS OUT?

614
00:32:18,602 --> 00:32:22,306
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF
IN THE PORNO STORE--
WASN'T IN HIS NATURE.

615
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:25,176
REALLY, STEPHEN, YOU DON'T
GIVE YOURSELF ENOUGH CREDIT.

616
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,611
COULD HAVE BEEN WRONG,
YOU KNOW?

617
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:29,747
IF THAT COP HAD COME IN
TWO SECONDS LATER...

618
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,115
( fires )

619
00:32:31,148 --> 00:32:33,484
IT WAS FATE THEN.

620
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:36,520
FATE'S WHAT PEOPLE
BELIEVE IN WHEN IT'S
THE LAST CHOICE THEY'VE GOT.

621
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:38,756
OH MY, I DISAGREE.

622
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:41,125
I THINK FATE HAD
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

623
00:32:41,158 --> 00:32:43,627
IT WAS FATE THAT WE WERE
IN THE STORE TO BEGIN WITH.

624
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,063
IT WAS FATE THAT THERE WAS
A CLERK BEHIND THE COUNTER

625
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:48,065
AND IT WAS HIS FATE
TO DIE TODAY.

626
00:32:48,098 --> 00:32:50,467
I BELIEVE IN FATE AS MUCH
AS I BELIEVE IN LOVE.

627
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,003
I KNOW YOU DO.

628
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,105
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

629
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,206
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

630
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,743
WELL, I TELL YOU THIS:
I GO BY TWO THINGS--

631
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,078
- INTUITION AND ASSUMPTION.
-<i> ( siren wails )</i>

632
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:03,280
INTUITION TELLS ME WHAT
TO THINK AND HOW TO ACT.

633
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:05,082
AND ASSUMPTION
RULES OUT THE REST.

634
00:33:05,115 --> 00:33:08,119
AND YOU'D RISK YOUR LIFE
BASED ON THAT LINE OF SHIT?

635
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:12,256
IF WE STOP ASSUMING,
WE'LL LOSE SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

636
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:15,693
AN ASSUMPTION IS A LEAP
OF FAITH TO BELIEVE

637
00:33:15,726 --> 00:33:19,096
THAT SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT
TO BELIEVE IS ACTUALLY TRUE.

638
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:22,065
IF WE STOP MAKING ASSUMPTIONS,

639
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:25,168
WE MIGHT JUST LOSE OUR FAITH.

640
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:29,473
I WAS SCARED.

641
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:31,676
AND THAT'S OKAY.

642
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,212
- HEY!
- HEY, FUCKER.

643
00:33:35,245 --> 00:33:36,746
DON'T TOUCH
THE FUCKING DICE.

644
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,482
HEY, FUCK,
IT'S MY DICE, MAN.

645
00:33:38,515 --> 00:33:40,818
DON'T-- WELL, DON'T TOUCH--
DON'T FUCKIN' TOUCH--

646
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:43,254
- WHAT IF--
- Man:<i> FUCKER!</i>

647
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:46,824
--WHAT IF MY INTUITION
TELLS ME

648
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:50,061
THAT WE'RE BOTH
GONNA DIE SOON?

649
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:53,697
SWEET STEPHEN,
EVERYTHING DIES.

650
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,167
THE WORLD IS A CIRCLE

651
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,336
AND EVERYTHING DIES.

652
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,087
( grunting )

653
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:27,565
SO HOW'D YOU GET A KEY
TO THIS APARTMENT?

654
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,800
I WORK AT THE SAME RESTAURANT
AS STEPHANIE--

655
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:32,203
THE BEEHIVE ON MELROSE.

656
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:33,536
SHE LETS ME CRASH
SOMETIMES.

657
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,773
- HOW'S THE JOB?
- IT'S OKAY.

658
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:39,210
SO THEY MAKE US
WAITRESSES WEAR THESE
BLACK AND YELLOW OUTFITS

659
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,878
LIKE WE'RE FUCKING
BUMBLEBEES OR SOMETHING.

660
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:42,646
- HA.
- IT'S REAL SHORT

661
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,583
AND SOME DRUNK ASSHOLE
IS ALWAYS TRYING TO PULL
ON MY STINGER.

662
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,252
EXCEPT FOR THAT,
THE JOB IS COOL.

663
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:50,754
WELL, HAVING A COOL JOB
IS IMPORTANT.

664
00:34:50,786 --> 00:34:53,156
OBVIOUSLY YOU THINK YOU
HAVE A PRETTY COOL JOB.

665
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,759
I'M A COP.

666
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:58,429
I KNOW--
BARETTA.

667
00:34:58,462 --> 00:35:01,099
SO FINISH YOUR STORY.

668
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:05,436
I GOT INTO A FIGHT
WITH MY BOYFRIEND TYLER
THIS MORNING.

669
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:08,772
<i> HE CAN BE A REAL HAIRY FUCK
 WHEN HE WANTS TO BE.</i>

670
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:11,241
TYLER SAID HE WANTED TO
SEE MORE OF MY FRIENDS,

671
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,912
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS GREAT.
DIDN'T KNOW HE MEANT NAKED.

672
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:16,714
PRICK.

673
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,816
HE SLAPS ME AROUND TOO.

674
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,753
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT I'D CRASH
HERE ON THE COUCH.

675
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:25,189
STEPHANIE WASN'T HOME
SO I TOOK THE BED.

676
00:35:27,457 --> 00:35:30,327
ANY SIGN OF TROUBLE
WHEN YOU GOT HERE?

677
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,729
STRUGGLE?

678
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,831
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

679
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,741
IF I WAS TO PAY YOU
OR SOMETHING,

680
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,310
COULD YOU GIVE TYLER
A SPECIAL VISIT

681
00:35:46,343 --> 00:35:48,846
WITH YOUR NIGHTSTICK?

682
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:53,784
OR COULD I GET IN TROUBLE
FOR EVEN ASKING YOU?

683
00:35:53,817 --> 00:35:56,487
HE LIKES TO
BEAT ON YOU, HUH?

684
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,656
I DON'T KNOW IF
HE LIKES IT OR NOT,

685
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,491
BUT HE DOES IT.

686
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,863
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--
HERE.

687
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:10,735
WE'LL FIGURE OUT A CONVENIENT
TIME FOR ME TO MEET YOUR FELLA.

688
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:23,181
SO THERE A PICTURE
OF STEPHANIE SINCLAIR
AROUND HERE ANYWHERE?

689
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,954
MEET STEPHANIE SINCLAIR.

690
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:37,962
THANKS, NORMA.

691
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,631
- THINK SHE'S OKAY?
-<i> I'M SURE SHE'LL TURN UP.</i>

692
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:43,601
IF SHE DOESN'T,
YOU GIVE ME A CALL.

693
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,703
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL
EVEN IF SHE DOES.

694
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:57,381
YOU KNOW WHOSE THIS IS?

695
00:36:57,414 --> 00:36:59,951
I'VE NEVER
SEEN IT BEFORE.

696
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:04,889
HA.

697
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,528
<i> ( applause )</i>

698
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:13,998
JUST HELP ME OUT HERE
A LITTLE BIT, OKAY, KENNY BUDDY?

699
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,268
'CAUSE I'M-- I'M TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND

700
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,703
WHAT MADE YOU TAKE THAT
LONG WALK DOWN THAT HALLWAY.

701
00:37:20,737 --> 00:37:22,006
Crowd:<i>
 DENNIS!  DENNIS!</i>

702
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,275
AND I JUST--

703
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,977
I'M JUST--

704
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,946
I'M JUST NOT GETTING IT!

705
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:31,948
-<i> ( crowd cheers )</i>
- I'M SORRY.

706
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:34,618
<i>I'M HAVING--
HAVING A HARD TIME HERE</i>

707
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:39,323
<i>BECAUSE I JUST KEEP
SEEING THOSE--</i>

708
00:37:40,657 --> 00:37:42,626
<i>THOSE TWO LOVELY PEOPLE,</i>

709
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:45,596
THOSE...

710
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:47,865
TWO HUMAN BEINGS.

711
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,603
Both:
THANKS!

712
00:37:52,636 --> 00:37:55,406
YOU DON'T LIKE BUTTER ON
YOUR POPCORN, DO YOU, HONEY?

713
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,940
- Man:<i> I HATE IT.</i>
- Woman:<i> OH GOOD!</i>

714
00:37:56,973 --> 00:37:59,076
- HI, SARAH.
- MY NAME IS JILL.

715
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:01,679
HELLO, SARAH.
I'D LIKE ONE TICKET.

716
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,914
ONE TICKET WILL MAKE ME
A HAPPY MAN.

717
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:05,449
<i> MY NAME IS JILL.</i>

718
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:07,518
WHAT THE HELL?
I'LL TAKE ONE TOO, SARAH.

719
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,819
SARAH, I CAN'T TELL YOU
THE LAST TIME I'VE BEEN
TO THE PICTURES.

720
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:11,488
Stephen:<i>
 LAST WEEK?</i>

721
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:13,724
NO, THAT WAS A SPECIAL PICTURE.
SPECIAL PICTURES DON'T COUNT.

722
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:15,659
- OH.
- DO THEY, SARAH?

723
00:38:15,692 --> 00:38:17,661
<i> JILL.</i>

724
00:38:17,694 --> 00:38:19,897
SEE YOU AT THE CINEMA,
SARAH.

725
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:25,403
<i> ( suspenseful music
 playing )</i>

726
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,805
<i> ( man shouting )</i>

727
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,909
<i> No no!
 Please don't!</i>

728
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:36,347
<i> ( screaming continues )</i>

729
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,850
HELLO, BARNEY.

730
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:41,984
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M DANDY, SIR.

731
00:38:42,018 --> 00:38:43,420
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

732
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:45,856
WHAT A LOVELY DISPOSITION
YOU HAVE.

733
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:47,858
ARE YOU WITH SOME
SORT OF PROGRAM?

734
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:50,961
I DON'T THINK
I FOLLOW YOU, SIR.

735
00:38:50,994 --> 00:38:53,530
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL ME SIR.
I MAY SOUND ENGLISH,

736
00:38:53,563 --> 00:38:56,767
BUT I'M NOT ROYALTY.

737
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,936
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

738
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,872
SO TELL ME-- ARE YOU WITH
ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS?

739
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:05,142
YOU KNOW, WHERE THEY
DRIVE AROUND, PICK UP
THE OLD CHAPS, FIND 'EM A JOB,

740
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:07,645
MAKE THEIR USELESS LIVES
FEEL PURPOSEFUL?

741
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:12,750
ACTUALLY I OWN
THIS THEATER.

742
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:15,886
SLAP MY FACE.
YOU OWN THIS PLACE?

743
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:17,988
- YES I DO.
- HA HA.

744
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:19,857
RAN INTO SOME
HARD TIMES LATELY,

745
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,692
BUT NOW I JUST DO
THE CONCESSIONS.

746
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:25,562
AND YET YOU MAINTAIN SUCH
A PLEASANT ATTITUDE.

747
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:26,930
KUDOS TO YOU, BARNEY.

748
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:29,032
WELL, I DIDN'T GET AS
FAR AS I DID IN THIS LIFE

749
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:30,768
BY BEING AN ASSHOLE.

750
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,003
HA HA!
I LIKE THAT.

751
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:34,805
I LIKE THAT A LOT.

752
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:37,808
RIGHT, WELL, I'LL HAVE
A LARGE TUB OF POPCORN AND--

753
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:41,612
DO YOU USE BUTTER OR
THAT CHEAP GREASY SHIT?

754
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,013
THE CHEAP GREASY SHIT.

755
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:45,149
AH, GOOD.  I'LL HAVE
A LARGE TUB OF POPCORN,

756
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:49,685
SOME CHEAP GREASY SHIT
AND A LARGE ICY-COLD COLA.

757
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,588
OKAY, COMING RIGHT UP.

758
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:55,993

<i> Go ahead and run.

 I'm glad, I'm glad.</i>

764

765
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:12,509
THERE YOU ARE, SIR.

766
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:13,877
RIGHT, THERE WE ARE.

767
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,879
THAT'S FOR THE POPCORN
AND THE COLA.

768
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:18,015
AND THIS

769
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:22,019
IS A LITTLE SOMETHING
EXTRA FOR YOU.

770
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,188
( laughs )
THANK YOU, SIR.

771
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,858

<i> Aha.</i>

774

-<i> Does that hurt?</i>

775
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,170
-<i> Yeah!</i>
-<i> Good.  You haven't felt
 anything yet.</i>

776
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:42,906
( muffled )<i>
 It's this tooth over here.</i>

777
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:45,107
Dentist:<i>
 Seymour, who's the dentist
 here, you or me?</i>

778
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:46,944
<i> I'll find that tooth.</i>

779
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:50,714
- IS THIS THE GREASY SHIT?
- ABSOLUTELY.

780
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:52,216
NAPKIN?

781
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:55,986
OH.  SORRY.

782
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:58,555
Is this
Dr. Farb's office?

783
00:40:58,588 --> 00:41:00,023
I DIDN'T KNOW JACK NICHOLSON
WAS IN THIS.

784
00:41:00,056 --> 00:41:04,061
MM-HMM.  IT WAS ONE OF
HIS FIRST MOVIES.

785
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,029
HOW RUDE.

786
00:41:06,062 --> 00:41:08,966
MMM.  DID YOU KNOW HE
AD-LIBBED

787
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,901
THE &quot;HERE'S JOHNNY&quot;
LINE IN &quot;THE SHINING&quot;?

788
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:13,070
Woman:<i>
 I DON'T REMEMBER THAT--</i>

789
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,872
THEY ARE SO FUCKING LOUD.

790
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,541
SOME PEOPLE HAVE NO MANNERS
WHATSOEVER.

791
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:19,209
Man:<i>
 HE CHOPS UP THE DOOR
 WITH HIS AXE,</i>

792
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:21,044
<i> STICKS HIS MUG IN
 AND GOES...</i>

793
00:41:21,077 --> 00:41:24,081
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
-<i> ...&quot;HERE'S JOHNNY!&quot;</i>

794
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,650
Woman:<i>
 OH, THAT WAS GOOD.</i>

795
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:30,888
DID YOU KNOW HE'S
SUCH A LAKERS FAN

796
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:34,223
THE PRODUCERS HAVE TO
SCHEDULE HIS SHOOTING DAYS

797
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:37,161
AROUND THE LAKERS' SCHEDULE?

798
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:42,533
DID YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO
WATCH THIS FINE MOVIE

799
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,069
AROUND YOUR FUCKING
CONVERSATION?

800
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,540
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

801
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:53,676
HOME VIDEO FIRST CAME OUT
IN THE LATE '70S, RIGHT?

802
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,612
<i> IT CHANGED THE MOVIE
 INDUSTRY FOREVER.</i>

803
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:57,948
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING
IN YOUR HOUSE

804
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:00,284
WATCHING A MOVIE?
WHOA.

805
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,185
<i> WELL, YOU COULD
 PUT IT ON PAUSE.</i>

806
00:42:02,218 --> 00:42:04,687
YOU COULD TAKE A PISS,
FUCK THE WIFE, MAKE A SANDWICH--

807
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,189
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO,
YEAH.

808
00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:08,825
- WHO ARE YOU?
- SHH.

809
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:12,696
( laughs )
HOME VIDEO AND EVENTUALLY DVD

810
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:14,865
ALSO TAUGHT US SOMETHING ELSE:

811
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:17,835
A NEW FORM OF RUDENESS.

812
00:42:19,636 --> 00:42:22,906
NOW IF WE CAN WATCH MOVIES
IN OUR OWN HOME,

813
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:26,009
THERE'S NOBODY TO OFFEND
BUT THE PEOPLE IN THAT HOME.

814
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:28,845
<i> RIGHT?  SO NOW WE'VE
 GOT PEOPLE</i>

815
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:32,082
<i> WATCHING MOVIES,
 TALKING ALL THE WAY THROUGH
 IN THEIR FUCKING HOMES,</i>

816
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:36,218
RECONDITIONED TO THINK
IT'S OKAY TO DO IT IN PUBLIC,

817
00:42:36,252 --> 00:42:39,656
WHICH BOTHERS
PEOPLE LIKE ME

818
00:42:39,689 --> 00:42:42,024
WHO COULDN'T GIVE A FUCK
WHAT YOUR FUCKING OPINION

819
00:42:42,058 --> 00:42:45,329
OF THE MOVIE WAS OR
HOW GOOD THE BLAH BLAH BLAH
WAS LAST WEEK.

820
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:50,067
LOOK, MAN,
IF WE DISTURBED YOU...

821
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,303
I HAVE A GUN
IN MY WAISTBAND.

822
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:54,971
<i> RIGHT NOW.
 YEAH, I DO.</i>

823
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:58,709
AND IF YOU TWO DON'T
SHUT THE FUCK UP,

824
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,678
I'M GONNA STICK IT
UP BOTH YOUR ASSES

825
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:03,946
AND I'M GONNA
PULL THE TRIGGER

826
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,951
UNTIL YOUR COLONS
SAY &quot;NO MáS.&quot;

827
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,026
ENJOY THE SHOW.

828
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:25,069
( laughs )

829
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:29,807
MY MOUTH'S DRY.

830
00:43:34,077 --> 00:43:35,946
Most people don't like
to go to the dentist

831
00:43:35,979 --> 00:43:38,915
but I rather
enjoy it myself, don't you?

832
00:43:38,948 --> 00:43:40,917
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO THEM?

833
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,886
OH, I SAID THAT WE WERE
TRYING TO ENJOY THE MOVIE

834
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,057
AND IF THEY COULD KEEP IT
DOWN TO LIKE A DULL ROAR,

835
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,959
<i> WE'D APPRECIATE IT.</i>

836
00:43:48,992 --> 00:43:51,028
<i> I'd almost rather go

837
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,831
YOU THREATENED THEM,
DIDN'T YOU?

838
00:43:54,931 --> 00:43:57,200
NO.

839
00:43:57,233 --> 00:44:01,038
I DON'T KNOW.
I--

840
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,973
<i> Oh goody goody,
 here it comes.</i>

841
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:04,741
I DON'T THINK SO.

842
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:08,145
I TOLD THEM TO
ENJOY THE MOVIE.

843
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:11,114
IS THAT THREATENING?
I--

844
00:44:11,147 --> 00:44:13,784
I CAN'T TELL ANYMORE.

845
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,786
Dentist:<i>
 Well, I made a lot of holes</i>

846
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,955
<i> and now I've got to
 fill it up with this here

849
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:32,062
SO I'VE BEEN WORKING IN
THIS PLACE FOR LESS THAN A WEEK.

850
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:33,964
YOU KNOW, I'M STANDING
BY THE WATER COOLER

851
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:38,033
AND I'M TRYING TO GET
THIS HOT LITTLE TELEMARKETER
TO NOTICE ME.

852
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:41,438
I'M STARING AND I'M STARING.
I'VE BEEN HAVING A THING
FOR HER FOR A WHILE.

853
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:44,207
AND FINALLY, BINGO,
SHE STARES AT ME.

854
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,142
<i> OKAY?</i>

855
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,044
<i> I GIVE HER A LOOK.</i>

856
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:49,946
<i> YOU KNOW?
 THE LOOK.</i>

857
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:51,948
-<i> THE LOOK?</i>
-<i> THE LOOK.</i>

858
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:58,355
-<i> HOW ARE YOU?</i>
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

859
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:01,091
I LIKE YOUR SHOES.

860
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:02,993
WELL, THANK YOU.

861
00:46:06,496 --> 00:46:07,965
GOTTA GO.

862
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:15,839
THAT'S MY FIANCéE.

863
00:46:15,872 --> 00:46:17,140
SO FUCKIN' WHAT?

864
00:46:17,173 --> 00:46:18,975
( grunts )

865
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,129
BUT THAT WASN'T THE WEIRDEST
DREAM I EVER HAD.

866
00:46:40,163 --> 00:46:42,266
- NO?
- NO.

867
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,984
- OH.
- TWO BEERS.

868
00:47:02,018 --> 00:47:04,988
THANK YOU, LOVELY
LADY DRINK BEARER.

869
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:08,391
- SO HOW ABOUT YOU?
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

870
00:47:08,424 --> 00:47:11,862
- HOW'S YOUR BEER?
- PRETTY FUCKING PERFECT.

871
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:22,606
THIS WHOLE PLACE IS
A FUCKING PLASTIC FACTORY--

872
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,108
THE WHOLE CITY IS.

873
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:27,878
AND YOUR ACCENT, ABOUT
THE FAKEST THING IN HERE.

874
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,980
YOU WERE SAYING?

875
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,915
WHAT WAS I SAYING?

876
00:47:31,948 --> 00:47:35,151
THAT THE OFFICE MASSACRE
WASN'T THE WORST DREAM
YOU EVER HAD.

877
00:47:35,184 --> 00:47:38,154
GIVES ME THE HEEBIES
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

878
00:47:38,187 --> 00:47:40,257
I ONLY HAD THE DAMN
THING ONCE, SO...

879
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,259
MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED
WHEN I WAS FOUR

880
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,060
AND I SAW MY DAD AT
THE WEEKENDS, RIGHT?

881
00:47:44,093 --> 00:47:46,596
BUT MY DAD DOESN'T
WANT TO BOTHER WITH SOME
FUCKING DUMB KID.

882
00:47:46,629 --> 00:47:48,632
YOU KNOW?  HE'S A SINGLE DUDE
IN A LOOSE MOOD.

883
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,101
SO HE DROPPED ME OFF AT
MY GRANDMA'S APARTMENT.

884
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,370
<i> NOW MY GRANDMA--</i>

885
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,971
STEPHEN?
BREAKFAST IS READY.

886
00:47:56,005 --> 00:48:00,577
--SHE WAS A QUEEN.
YOU KNOW, A REAL NICE LADY.

887
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,013
AND I WAS A REAL FUCKING
TV HOUND AT THE TIME.

888
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,982
SO I'D ALWAYS FALL ASLEEP
IN FRONT OF THE TUBE.

889
00:48:18,194 --> 00:48:21,096
Grandma:<i>
 Stephen?  Wake up.</i>

890
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,933
<i> Stephen?</i>

891
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,968
Breakfast is ready.

892
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:29,606
<i> ( birds chirping )</i>

893
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:55,132
Eat your fucking

894
00:48:57,133 --> 00:48:59,002
Now!

895
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:17,087
EAT YOUR FUCKING BREAKFAST.

896
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:22,025
SHE WAS A REAL QUEEN.

897
00:49:24,093 --> 00:49:27,998
<i> AND THE THING IS
 NOW I THINK ABOUT IT
 ALL THE TIME.</i>

898
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,000
WHY DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT
SO MUCH?

899
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:34,004
WELL, MY GRANDMA WAS
THE GREATEST LADY I EVER KNEW.

900
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,473
AND SHE WAS THE FIRST PERSON
TO CALL ME SWEET.

901
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:40,076
AW, THAT'S...

902
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:42,578
WELL?

903
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,316
WHY WOULD I HAVE THAT DREAM?

904
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:50,220
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT A MIND-READER.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

905
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:53,056
MAYBE ONE OF THOSE LITTLE
PEARLS OF FUCKING WISDOM

906
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,025
YOU'VE BEEN SPITTING
OUT ALL DAY.

907
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:58,161
<i>ALL RIGHT.
GIVE ME A SECOND.</i>

908
00:49:58,194 --> 00:50:01,531
I DON'T BELIEVE IN DREAMS.

909
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:04,801
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN DREAMS?

910
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:08,337
WHAT KIND OF SHIT IS THAT?
THAT-- THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

911
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:09,572
( laughs )

912
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:12,342
WELL, I WISH MY LIFE WERE MORE
LIKE A BURT REYNOLDS MOVIE.

913
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:14,811
YOU WANT TO BE OLD
AND BALD?

914
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:16,613
NO, I DON'T WISH
I WAS BURT REYNOLDS.

915
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,048
I WISH MY LIFE WERE MORE
LIKE HIS MOVIES.

916
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:21,217
YOU KNOW, LOTS OF
HIGH-PITCHED LAUGHS,
FAST CARS, BAR-ROOM BRAWLS,

917
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,752
FUCKING COWBOY BOOTS.

918
00:50:22,785 --> 00:50:25,788
( imitating laugh )
HA HA HA HA!

919
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,757
JUST FUN.  THE GUYS WERE GUYS,
THE GALS WERE GALS,

920
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:29,492
<i> AND NOTHING
 REALLY MATTERED.</i>

921
00:50:29,525 --> 00:50:32,095
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR DREAM,
I GUESS.

922
00:50:32,128 --> 00:50:33,730
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
BELIEVE IN DREAMS.

923
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:37,299
NO, I SAID YOU COULD
HAVE YOUR DREAM... I GUESS.

924
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,569
AH.

925
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:42,639
Mr. Jack:<i>
 UH-OH.</i>

926
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:45,675
I'VE SEEN THAT LOOK BEFORE.

927
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:48,678
- YOU COULD PICK ONE OUT,
  YOU KNOW?
- IT'S NOT MY BAG.

928
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:52,682
<i> ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
 IS WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR</i>

929
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:55,285
<i> AND BE ABLE TO SAY IT
 WITHOUT SOUNDING LIKE
 YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT.</i>

930
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,854
BELIEVE ME, YOU'RE
A TERRIFIC BULLSHITTER.

931
00:50:57,887 --> 00:51:00,490
- HEY.
- HEY.

932
00:51:00,523 --> 00:51:03,326
BUY ME A DRINK.

933
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,462
- BUY YOU A DRINK?
- YEAH.

934
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,765
- WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?
- JESSICA.  WHO THE FUCK
  ARE YOU?

935
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:13,403
PAUL SPINOZI.
EVERYONE CALLS ME SPO.

936
00:51:13,436 --> 00:51:15,772
I LOVE TO EAT ITALIAN.

- YOU DO?
- YEAH.

938
00:51:18,574 --> 00:51:20,143
YUMMY.

939
00:51:20,176 --> 00:51:23,580
WOW.  WELL, MAYBE--

940
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:27,116
MAYBE YOU WANT TO LEAVE AND
GET A BITE TO EAT THEN?  HUH?

941
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,551
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD START.

942
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:30,453
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

943
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:33,156
HAVE FUN.

944
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:37,127
- WHAT?
- HAVE FUN LEAVING.

945
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,596
NOW GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME.

946
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:43,299

TO ME.

950
00:51:50,573 --> 00:51:53,308
<i>I COULD NEVER DO THAT,
THE WAY YOU JUST SPOKE
TO THAT GIRL.</i>

951
00:51:53,342 --> 00:51:55,712
I'M JUST NOT
THAT SORT OF CHAP.

952
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,382
CAN I GET YOU GUYS
ANYTHING ELSE?

953
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,689

00:52:28,277 --> 00:52:31,781
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TODAY WAS A GREAT DAY.

956
00:52:31,814 --> 00:52:33,516
IT WAS A DAY.

957

<i>THE PERFECT MIX

00:52:39,822 --> 00:52:42,592
SEX, VIOLENCE

960
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,961
AND PLAIN OLD AMERICAN FUN.

961
00:52:44,994 --> 00:52:48,364

<i>SOME DAYS GO BY</i>

963
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:53,836
<i>AND YOU DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT BEING ALIVE.</i>

964
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:55,905
IT'S A SHAME,
DAYS LIKE THAT.

965
00:52:55,938 --> 00:52:58,508

OTHER DAYS...

966
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:04,814
WHEN EVERYTHING
IS JUST PERFECT.

967
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:08,851
- TODAY WAS ONE OF THOSE DAYS.
- YEAH.

968
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:12,789
I REMEMBER THE EXACT MOMENT

969
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,591
I REALIZED I EXISTED.

970
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:15,991

<i> WHEN I WAS SIX,</i>

973

I NEVER THOUGHT OF
MYSELF AS BEING ALIVE.

974
00:53:23,866 --> 00:53:26,869
LIFE WAS LIKE A MOVIE--

975
00:53:26,902 --> 00:53:29,872
<i> SOMETHING I WAS WATCHING</i>

976
00:53:29,905 --> 00:53:31,874
<i> OUTSIDE OF MYSELF,

00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:40,583
THE REALIZATION THAT...

979
00:53:40,616 --> 00:53:42,685
THIS WAS IT.

980
00:53:42,718 --> 00:53:45,321
I WAS IN
THE THICK OF THINGS.

981
00:53:45,354 --> 00:53:47,790
I WAS ALIVE.

<i> I WROTE A WILL THAT WEEKEND--

THAT I WAS ALIVE

985
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:03,873

OF DEATH.

01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,646
- LEAVE THE LAD ALONE.
- Man: WHAT?

1167
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:46,015
OH, WHO WAS IT
SAID THAT?

1168
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,383
I DID.

1169
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:51,020
HUH.  I'M-- I'M TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND

1170
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:55,057
HOW YOU WOULD--
I MEAN, HOW YOU COULD,

1171
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:57,559
AFTER, UH--

1172
01:04:57,592 --> 01:05:00,162
ARE YOU GOING
TO CRY AGAIN?

1173
01:05:00,195 --> 01:05:02,031
Woman:<i>
 DID YOU HEAR HIM?</i>

1174
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,565
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SIR?

1175
01:05:03,598 --> 01:05:06,035
- MR. JACK.
- I'M MR. DENNIS.

1176
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,670
- PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
- MY PLEASURE.

1177
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:12,074
I'VE NEVER SHAKEN HANDS WITH
A MAN THAT CONDONES MURDER

1178
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:13,509
AND PITIES MURDERERS.

1179
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:15,344
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT'S ME?

1180
01:05:15,377 --> 01:05:18,013
I AM AMAZINGLY
RESOURCEFUL.

1181
01:05:18,046 --> 01:05:20,982
OY.  HA!

1182
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:24,186
ALL I'M SAYING IS THE LAD
SEEMS TO BE A BIT OUT OF SORTS

1183
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:26,388
ALL ALONE ON THE STAGE
THERE BY HIMSELF.

1184
01:05:26,421 --> 01:05:28,490
WELL, PERHAPS
YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN HIM?

1185
01:05:28,523 --> 01:05:30,459
- Woman:<i> YEAH!</i>
- PERHAPS I WOULD.

1186
01:05:30,492 --> 01:05:32,995
-<i> ( cheering )</i>
- CAN I BRING SOMEONE?

1187
01:05:33,028 --> 01:05:35,596
BE MY GUEST.
I'D LOVE TO GET YOUR
THOUGHTS ON THIS SUBJECT.

1188
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,066
- AUDIENCE?
- All: YEAH!

1189
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,336
COME ON.
ALL RIGHT.

1190
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:43,672
TELL 'EM.
THAT'S RIGHT.

1191
01:05:43,705 --> 01:05:46,075
( chanting )
DENNIS, DENNIS, DENNIS...

1192
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,679
COME ON, WELCOME.  WELCOME.
THERE YOU GO.

1193
01:05:52,647 --> 01:05:55,750
Dennis:
Okay, here we are talking
to our spontaneous guests

1194
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:57,753
straight out of
the studio audience.

1195
01:05:57,786 --> 01:06:01,323
Their names are Mr. Jack
and Sweet Stephen.

1196
01:06:01,356 --> 01:06:03,225
And they subscribe to
the belief

1197
01:06:03,258 --> 01:06:05,327
that people
like Kenny Edwards,

1198
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,997
<i> a convicted murderer,</i>

1199
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:11,100
<i> ought to be left alone.</i>

1200
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,002
All:
BOO!

1201
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:15,671
NOW MR. JACK, WHY WOULD YOU
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

1202
01:06:15,704 --> 01:06:18,340
WELL, A CRIME IS A CRIME--

1203
01:06:18,373 --> 01:06:20,676
WHICH IS TO SAY?

1204
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:24,078
MURDERING YOUR PARENTS
IS WRONG, CUT AND DRY
AND SIMPLE AS PIE.

1205
01:06:24,112 --> 01:06:26,248
BUT THERE ARE LOTS
OF DIFFERENT CRIMES.

1206
01:06:26,281 --> 01:06:29,785
MURDER IS A CRIME.

1207
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:32,121
BUT ISN'T EXPLOITING THAT
MURDER FOR PERSONAL GAIN,

1208
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:35,124
MAYBE SOME HIGHER RATINGS--
ISN'T THAT A CRIME TOO?

1209
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,559
WELL SEE, I WOULD
HARDLY COMPARE RUNNING
A TELEVISION SHOW TO--

1210
01:06:37,592 --> 01:06:40,095
YOU SEE, I LOOK AT YOU
AND I LOOK AT THIS LAD

1211
01:06:40,128 --> 01:06:42,398
AND I CAN'T
TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

1212
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:45,567
( audience jeering )

1213
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,569
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM.
LET'S REVIEW WHAT WE
KNOW ABOUT YOU.

1214
01:06:48,603 --> 01:06:52,508
YOU MAKE YOUR LIVING OFF
OTHER PEOPLE'S MISERY.

1215
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:55,277
DOLLARS IN YOUR POCKET--
THAT'S ALL HE MEANS TO YOU.

1216
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:58,080
THESE FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE--
CHUMP CHANGE.

1217
01:06:58,113 --> 01:07:00,348
<i> ( all jeering )</i>

1218
01:07:00,382 --> 01:07:02,518
WHAT THE FUCK
MAKES YOU SO MORAL?

1219
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:04,720
NOW MR. JACK, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO ASK YOU TO WATCH
YOUR LANGUAGE.

1220
01:07:04,753 --> 01:07:06,488
ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE LIVE.

1221
01:07:06,521 --> 01:07:08,791
AND RIGHT NEXT TO
MR. JACK IS A MAN

1222
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:11,226
WHO CALLS HIMSELF
SWEET STEPHEN.

1223
01:07:11,259 --> 01:07:13,696
NOW DO YOU SHARE
YOUR FRIEND'S POINT OF VIEW?

1224
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,437
WELL...

1225
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,571
THAT WOMAN THERE--

1226
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:26,809
SHE USED THE WORD &quot;EVIL&quot;
TO DESCRIBE HIM,

1227
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:30,345
<i> LIKE IT WAS
 A LIFESTYLE CHOICE.</i>

1228
01:07:30,378 --> 01:07:34,149
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CHOOSE
LIKE AN ICE-CREAM FLAVOR.

1229
01:07:34,182 --> 01:07:35,783
IT'S--

1230
01:07:35,817 --> 01:07:39,388
IT'S A WARM AND SAFE,
INVITING FEELING.

1231
01:07:41,656 --> 01:07:44,860
AND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ACTING BAD

1232
01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:47,763
AND BEING BAD.

1233
01:07:47,796 --> 01:07:50,299
ACTING BAD IS A MOMENT;

1234
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:53,268
BEING BAD IS AN ADDICTION.

1235
01:07:53,301 --> 01:07:55,737
I SHOULD KNOW.

1236
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:58,807
SO ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU--

1237
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,811
YOU ENJOY BEING BAD?
ARE YOU ADDICTED?

1238
01:08:02,844 --> 01:08:04,813
BEING BAD IS FUN.

1239
01:08:04,846 --> 01:08:07,149
- BEING BAD IS FUN?
- YEAH.

1240
01:08:07,182 --> 01:08:12,120
IS THAT YOUR MESSAGE
TO THE YOUTH OF AMERICA?

1241
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:15,224
- SWEET STEPHEN?
- YEAH?

1242
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:16,792
ARE YOU EVIL?

1243
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,496
ISN'T EVERYBODY?

1244
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:31,773
I HAVE A QUESTION.

1245
01:08:31,805 --> 01:08:35,576
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IT'S TOMMY THE COP!

1246
01:08:35,609 --> 01:08:37,513
Dennis:<i>
 OKAY, MIKE HIM.
 SOMEBODY GET A MIKE ON HIM.</i>

1247
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:40,182
( all chattering )

1248
01:08:40,215 --> 01:08:42,518
ALL RIGHT.
YOUR QUESTION, SIR?

1249
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:46,622
I JUST WANTED TO ASK IF EITHER
MR. JACK OR SWEET STEPHEN HERE

1250
01:08:46,654 --> 01:08:49,825
CONSIDER STABBING A WOMAN
AND DISMEMBERING HER CORPSE

1251
01:08:49,858 --> 01:08:52,661
-<i> AN ACT OF EVIL?</i>
- WHAT?

1252
01:08:52,694 --> 01:08:54,396
AND WHO ARE YOU, SIR?

1253
01:08:54,429 --> 01:08:56,665
I'M THE ARRESTING OFFICER.

1254
01:08:56,698 --> 01:08:58,800
I'M THE HERO TO
BE NAMED LATER.

1255
01:08:58,832 --> 01:09:02,803
( cheering )

1256
01:09:02,837 --> 01:09:06,441
WELL, I'D LIKE TO ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION, TOMMY.

1257
01:09:06,474 --> 01:09:09,811
BUT WHAT'S THE POINT
IN EXPLAINING SOMETHING
YOU'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND?

1258
01:09:09,844 --> 01:09:12,781
RIGHT, WRONG;
GOOD, EVIL;

1259
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:14,816
GOD, SATAN.
PLEASED TO MEET YOU, TOMMY.

1260
01:09:14,849 --> 01:09:16,852
WANNA GUESS MY NAME?

1261
01:09:16,885 --> 01:09:19,221
<i> ( audience screaming )</i>

1262
01:09:19,254 --> 01:09:21,323
( gunshots )

1263
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:47,950
WE SHOULD TALK, YOU AND I.

1264
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:50,719
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT?

1265
01:09:50,752 --> 01:09:53,255
THESE STANDOFFS ARE
INTERESTING, AREN'T THEY?

1266
01:09:53,287 --> 01:09:55,757
HOW NEITHER OF US
HAS AN ADVANTAGE?

1267
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:58,860
WELL, THAT'S NOT
EXACTLY TRUE, IS IT?

1268
01:09:58,893 --> 01:10:00,395
( laughs )

1269
01:10:00,428 --> 01:10:02,297
I'VE GOT A HUGE ADVANTAGE.

1270
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:04,733
I'VE GOT A GUN ON YOU.
YOU KNOW I'M A GREAT SHOT.

1271
01:10:04,766 --> 01:10:06,835
WHAT DO YOU HAVE?
YOU HAVE A KNIFE

1272
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:09,972
AGAINST THE THROAT OF
A TABLOID TELEVISION JOURNALIST

1273
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:13,408
WHO'S BEEN SLAMMING
THE L.A.P.D. FOR THE PAST
FIVE YEARS

1274
01:10:13,441 --> 01:10:16,845
<i> FOR BRIBERY, KICKBACKS
 AND BRUTALITY.</i>

1275
01:10:16,878 --> 01:10:18,847
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THAT
YELLOW BASTARD?

1276
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,749
HOW DID THIS BECOME
ABOUT ME?

1277
01:10:20,782 --> 01:10:22,484
WILL YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP
ONCE AND FOR ALL?

1278
01:10:22,517 --> 01:10:24,853
WHY DON'T YOU PUT THE KNIFE
DOWN, MR. JACK, HUH?

1279
01:10:24,886 --> 01:10:27,556
OR BETTER YET, MAKE A MOVE
FOR RIVERS'S JUGULAR.

1280
01:10:27,589 --> 01:10:30,926
EITHER WAY, I WIN.

1281
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:33,894
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO YOU, ISN'T IT?

1282
01:10:33,928 --> 01:10:36,498
PLAYING THE ROLE
OF THE POLICEMAN.

1283
01:10:36,531 --> 01:10:38,734
BUT YOU AND I
AREN'T THAT DIFFERENT.

1284
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:40,434
WE GET THE SAME URGES.

1285
01:10:40,468 --> 01:10:42,738
LOOK, HE'S
A TRIGGER-HAPPY COP

1286
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:45,641
AND YOU'RE NOTHING BUT
A PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL PSYCHOPATH

1287
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:48,944
WHOSE REALITIES MEAN NOTHING
TO ANYONE BUT YOURSELF

1288
01:10:48,977 --> 01:10:50,579
AND YOUR DEAD SIDEKICK.

1289
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:52,447
JUST BECAUSE A MAN
IS FUCKING CRAZY

1290
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,915
DOESN'T MAKE HIS OPINION
LESS FUCKING VALID.

1291
01:10:54,949 --> 01:10:57,486
YOU'RE NOTHING.

1292
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:02,558

I WAS STARTING TO THINK
THE GOVERNOR CALLED.

1310
01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:06,882
TO SAY WHAT REALLY?

1311
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:09,684
&quot;I'LL BE BACK&quot;?

1312
01:13:09,717 --> 01:13:11,987
SILLY STEPHEN.

1313
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,156
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

1314
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:15,991
GOOD.

1315
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:17,659
GOOD.

1316
01:13:17,692 --> 01:13:20,529
I'VE BEEN GOOD.

1317
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,831
I'VE BEEN SLEEPING.

1318
01:13:22,864 --> 01:13:24,699
- SLEEPING?
- YEAH.

1319
01:13:24,732 --> 01:13:26,602
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

1320
01:13:29,904 --> 01:13:32,040
HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING LONG?

1321
01:13:32,073 --> 01:13:34,843
LONG ENOUGH.

1322
01:13:34,876 --> 01:13:37,712
LET'S DO THIS THEN.

1323
01:13:37,745 --> 01:13:39,915
YOU'RE READY, RIGHT?

1324
01:13:41,616 --> 01:13:43,485
COME ON.

1325
01:13:57,866 --> 01:14:00,502
THIS IS WHERE WE PART,
STEPHEN.

1326
01:14:00,535 --> 01:14:02,704
WHAT-- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1327
01:14:02,737 --> 01:14:04,005
BACK.

1328
01:14:04,038 --> 01:14:05,840
- BACK WHERE?
- TO THE MIDDLE.

1329
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:09,010
TO THE-- I-- I THOUGHT
WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE.

1330
01:14:09,043 --> 01:14:11,213
WE'RE SOMEPLACE ELSE.

1331
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:14,216
THE MIDDLE
IS WHERE WE WERE.

1332
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:15,884
IT'S WHERE I'M NEEDED.

1333
01:14:19,587 --> 01:14:21,556
WHAT FOR?

1334
01:14:21,589 --> 01:14:23,859
BALANCE, STEPHEN.

1335
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:26,995
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT BALANCE.

1336
01:14:27,028 --> 01:14:28,997
I'M JEALOUS.

1337
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:31,666
OH.

1338
01:14:31,699 --> 01:14:33,936
DON'T BE.

1339
01:14:36,704 --> 01:14:39,474
COME ON.

1340
01:14:53,254 --> 01:14:55,757
I'M REALLY GONNA
MISS YOU, STEPHEN--

1341
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:58,627
OUR LITTLE CHATS.

1342
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,997
YOU WERE MORE CURIOUS
THAN THE OTHERS.
I LIKE THAT.

1343
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,704
GO ON.

1344
01:15:11,873 --> 01:15:14,809
I-- I DON'T KNOW
WHICH ONE TO PUSH.

1345
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:21,016
FREE WILL,
CHOICES, PATHS.

1346
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:23,885
SOME CHOOSE ONE;
SOME CHOOSE THE OTHER.

1347
01:15:23,918 --> 01:15:27,923
YOU CHOSE YOUR PATH LONG
BEFORE I MET YOU,

1348
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:32,027
SO IT DOESN'T
MUCH MATTER WHICH YOU CHOOSE.

1349
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,096
EITHER WAY, YOU'LL END UP
WHERE YOU BELONG.

1350
01:15:35,129 --> 01:15:38,333
<i>IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER,</i>

1351
01:15:38,366 --> 01:15:40,168
BLAME FATE.

1352
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:44,906
WHAT'S SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN HAPPENS.

1353
01:15:44,939 --> 01:15:48,644
AND EVERYONE DOES WHAT
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

1354
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:05,126
HEY...

1355
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:08,996
YOU'RE NOT FROM ENGLAND,
YOU KNOW?

1356
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:13,034
( no accent )
NO.  I'M NOT.
