Issues that were once black
and white are now gray.

And perhaps the greatest blow
to this state's political right

14
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,565
Is the outlying of
capital punishment.

00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,337

by a scorpion sting.

breaks my neck, snaps my spine.

on two red hot pokers.

paralyzed, couldn't move.

out of clay, used my face.

in, finished shoeing the horse.

on a window.

seeing this one girl.

She's a slut.

186
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,760
You must accentuate
the negative.

187
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,029
It's more positive.

00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,898
Now, I'd like to try some
word association with you.

It's very simple.

190
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,268
I say a word, and then
you say the first word

191
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:31,204
That comes to your mind.

192
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:37,444

your subconscious desires.

your fear of women,

00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,357
BUSINESSMAN 1: Hi.

365
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:52,825
Um, how about a cognac?

366
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,494
BUSINESSMAN 2:
Anything on draft.

367
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,196
BUSINESSMAN 1: Here, let's put
it on the company credit card.

368
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,064
BUSINESSMAN 2: Let's not.

369
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,866
There's no money in the bank.

370
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,067
You worry too much.

371
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:01,868
Yeah, well.

372
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,370
If Parker pays us tomorrow...

373
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,440
BUSINESSMAN 1:
Jesus look at that.

374
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,876
BUSINESSMAN 2: Out
of your league, pal.

375
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,378
Don't take it too hard.

376
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:12,178
Thank you.

377
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,514
Thanks.

378
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:16,383
I think she likes me.

379
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,751
I think you're dreaming.

380
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:22,355
In fact, you only read about
women like that in your dreams.

381
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:23,356
You know what I'm saying?

382
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,269
Cheers.

383
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,210
BUSINESSMAN 1: Uh-oh.

384
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,244
That's it.

385
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,346
That's it.
Don't even-

386
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:46,979
- That's it.
- Stop.

387
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,680
- That's it.
- No.

388
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,481
That's it.

389
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,149
Bad time.

390
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,284
Here, let me get that.

391
00:20:56,523 --> 00:21:01,060
That's, uh, a great brand.

392
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,195
You're very attractive.

393
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,231
Thank you.

394
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:10,102
What was that I saw you slip
into your pocket a moment ago?

395
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,004
Nothing.

396
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,473
Yeah, right.

397
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,708
So where's your wife?

398
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:16,509
BUSINESSMAN 1: Wife?

399
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,978
Who... who can afford a wife?

400
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:27,454
I hope that you are
the discrete type.

401
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:28,421
Oh, yes.

402
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:31,458
I'm... I'm very discrete.

403
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,129
You have wonderful hands.

404
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:37,930
Thank you.

405
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,900
And you have wonderful...

406
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,211
Hey.

407
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,147
You want to try
to keep it decent?

408
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,684
Do you want another drink?

409
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:01,187
No, no.

410
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,689
Come with me.

411
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,657
BUSINESSMAN 1: Where to?

412
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:05,658
My place.

413
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,002
You're so beautiful.

414
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:50,970
Don't stop.

415
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,345
Freeze!

416
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:34,313
What the hell?
What's this?

417
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,114
Guns!

418
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,483
Get out of my house.

419
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,316
This is a private home.

420
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,117
What are you doing?

421
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,385
Do you know these people?

422
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:40,553
No!

423
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,889
I said freeze, mister.

424
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:43,823
Marijuana, sir.

425
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,157
Hey, wait a minute.

426
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,358
A .38 revolver, sir.

427
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:47,193
Hey, wait.

428
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,127
Now I have a permit for that.

429
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,361
You guys got a warrant?

430
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:50,830
OFFICER 1: Read 'em
and weep, mister.

431
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,631
Hey, wait now.

432
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:52,599
I'm not a criminal.

433
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:53,766
What are you looking for?

434
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:54,567
No condoms, sir.

435
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,367
That's it.

436
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:56,235
No condoms.

437
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:57,069
Just as I suspected.

438
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:00,673
Condoms?

439
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,274
You're looking for condoms?

440
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,576
What do you think
I'm looking for?

441
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:04,376
Drugs?

442
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:05,411
Guns?

443
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,947
BUSINESSMAN 1: Well,
who are you guys?

444
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,081
We're PRICs, mister.

445
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,151
BUSINESSMAN 1: No kidding.

446
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:15,788
Prophylactic Regulatory
Intercept Commandos.

447
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,089
BUSINESSMAN 1: This
is a joke, right?

448
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,925
OFFICER 2: Mister, there's
one thing I don't kid about.

449
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,092
I'm talking serious.

450
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,961
You bet your goddamn
sweet guarantee you.

451
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:23,496
You find this funny?

452
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:25,598
You think there's something
funny about spreading

453
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,433
Sexual diseases?

454
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:29,235
Well, I don't think so.

455
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,604
That is why it is now
a crime to partake

456
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,607
In unprotected sexual activity.

457
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:35,975
You're crazy!

458
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,778
How... how will you ever
enforce a law like that?

459
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,880
OFFICER 2: What you got
in your bloomers, mister?

460
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,149
What do you think?

461
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,685
I think it's a
concealed weapon.

462
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:46,853
Confiscate it, Sergeant.

463
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,054
Hey, wait a minute.

464
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,022
Ow.

465
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:51,858
SERGEANT: How long have
you known this man?

466
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:52,759
Uh...

467
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,060
OFFICER 2: Five years?

468
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,427
Why?

469
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,664
SERGEANT: You'll be found guilty
unless you've been sexually

470
00:24:57,764 --> 00:25:00,600
Active with him only in
a monogamous relationship

471
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,968
For five years.

472
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:10,242
Well, a... actually,
we just met.

473
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,111
He seduced me.

474
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,512
That's harassment.

475
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:18,484
Offering helpful promptings to
a witness is perfectly legal.

476
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:21,253
What the hell is that?

477
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,488
Blood testing machine.

478
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,156
This machine will
determine your blood volume

479
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,559
Relative to your gamma globulin
fraction of immune serum

480
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,928
In your blood, indicating
any foul inactive diseases

481
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:29,996
Inside you.

482
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:30,963
Ow.

483
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,999
I don't have any
infectious diseases.

484
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,000
DOCTOR: Oh, oh, oh, oh.

485
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,602
Are we so sure now?

486
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,136
Is that why you're
so ready to dip

487
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:39,138
Your missile without the
protective silo sleeve?

488
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,507
You're so familiar with your
blood at a microscopic level

489
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:43,109
That you're ready
to sink your bayonet

490
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,345
Free of any vulcanized sheet
of temporary lamination?

491
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,147
I don't think so.

492
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:53,185
Do you have any idea how
much I hate you, mister?

493
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,588
I don't know what
you had planned.

494
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:59,892
You were going to take her
to a movie, weren't you?

495
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:00,960
Yeah.

496
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,428
And maybe you'd take
her to a restaurant,

497
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:03,596
Have a little
something nice to eat.

498
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:04,396
Weren't you going
to do that, boy?

499
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,264
Weren't you?
Weren't you?

500
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,132
Weren't you?
Weren't you?

501
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:06,899
- Yes.
- Don't you eyeball me.

502
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:07,967
Look at me.

503
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,036
Don't you eyeball me!

504
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,004
And then you were
going to take her home,

505
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,340
Whisper sweet gentle nothings
into her ear, get her real

506
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,507
And feel comfortable with you.

507
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:16,809
Weren't you, boy?

508
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,444
Then maybe you'd take her
home, sit by the fireplace,

509
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,112
Have a little glass of wine.

510
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:21,814
You probably drink that
white wine, don't you, boy?

511
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,283
You probably drink that white
Chablis kind of blanc wine

512
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,052
'Cause you're a faggot
ass penis smoking,

513
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:30,389
Dick smoking, butt slamming...
Boy, I know your kind.

514
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,992
And then just when you had
her really trusting you,

515
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,194
Just when you were thinking
every day you're apart

516
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:38,665
Is just agony and every
day together is just bliss,

517
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,366
That's when you'd get her.

518
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,168
You'd tell her things
you didn't even mean.

519
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,102
Wouldn't you, boy?

520
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,070
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you?

521
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:44,871
Yes.

522
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:45,705
Don't lie to me.

523
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:46,706
Yes.

524
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:47,840
You really would?

525
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,208
You're disgusting, more
than I thought you were.

526
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:52,444
And then you'd take off those
little silky under things

527
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,813
She wears, and
you'd lick and kiss

528
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:56,949
Every supple rosy kind
of cheek kind of fat kind

529
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,017
Of part of her body.

530
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,218
Wouldn't you, boy?

531
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:00,419
And you'd like it
too, wouldn't you?

532
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,220
Yeah.

533
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,723
You make me sick.

534
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:06,258
And then when you
least expected it,

535
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,928
You'd look at her right
in the eye, leaning over.

536
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:09,796
You'd nibble on her lip.

537
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:12,231
And then blam-o.

538
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,165
Yeah.

539
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:14,300
In fact, that was the idea.

540
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,306
You know I'd kill every last
one of you if I had the chance.

541
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:22,074
Give me a terrorist
bombing any day.

542
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:25,477
It's much more honest.

543
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,312
OK.

544
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:27,113
Finished, gentlemen.

545
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:28,547
So what now?

546
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,350
The test results will
take six months to process.

547
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,452
So I... I guess I'm free to go.

548
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,321
Take the evidence, corporal.

549
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:36,522
Ow!

550
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,758
You'll be required to
wait for said test results

551
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:41,593
At the expense of the
state at a duly appointed

552
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,595
Place of incarceration.

553
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:45,631
You're putting me in prison?

554
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:47,533
Where they have an
adequate supply of condoms.

555
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:50,937
Ow!

556
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:51,738
Don't pull on that.

557
00:27:56,442 --> 00:28:00,079
Young lady, are you all right?

558
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:00,880
Yes.

559
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,381
I think so.

560
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:03,182
SERGEANT: Good.

561
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:07,686
Test her, doctor.

562
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:08,855
What?

563
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:09,688
No!

564
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:10,957
No, please.

565
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:11,891
Please, no.

566
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:12,691
No.

567
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:18,264
Well, good work, sergeant.

568
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,574
We're living in an era
of sexual confusion.

569
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:31,944
Gone are the days
of promiscuity.

570
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,746
At the slightest
hint of behavior

571
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:37,049
Preparatory to fornication,
PRICs will move in.

572
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,118
If the offending couple
are found not wearing

573
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,187
Any form of
contraception, we will

574
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:45,491
Confiscate the weapons used,
in this case, penis and vagina.

575
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:48,861
So remember, always
wear a condom.

576
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:51,330
I'm wearing one now.

577
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,666
Remember, it's not
only a good idea.

578
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:55,467
It's the law.

579
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:07,246
You know something, sergeant?

580
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,480
I always liked you.

581
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,051
Got a condom?

00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:16,722
[Music playing]

583
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,368
Hello, I'm Dan Tip.

584
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:31,370
And I'm Maria Gonzalez Smith.

585
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,605
Welcome to the "World
at War," the show

586
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,975
That brings you man's
deadly territoriality

587
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:38,544
Live into your living room.

588
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:39,745
That's right, Dan.

589
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:42,849
Democrat or Communist,
rebel or army, today, man

590
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,217
Will carve his own fate,
as the stakes are ultimate,

591
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:48,287
And the outcome is
yours to decide.

592
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,089
For our up close
and personal feature

593
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:53,559
Tonight, let's go to Charlie
Pinebowl and the Khyber Pass,

594
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,594
Where the ruthless
heroin trade has turned

595
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:58,264
This long and treacherous
mountain passageway

596
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,099
Into a deadly no man's land.

597
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:02,034
Charlie.

598
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,369
Thanks, Dan.

599
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,304
I'm standing here in the most
violent spot in the world.

600
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,707
Hi.

601
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,608
My name's Verne.

602
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:10,910
This here's my brother Nason.

603
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,916
We'd like to talk about our...

604
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:18,217
Thanks, Roger.

605
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,886
We're here in the gardens
of the palace of Versailles

606
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:25,324
Just outside of Paris,
where it's 5:53.

607
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:26,458
Hi.

608
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:27,559
My name's Verne.

609
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,828
This here is my brother Cleotus.

610
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:33,399
Oh, we have been in the tractor
business for quite some time

611
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:34,533
Now.

612
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:38,204
We have many tractors
for you to choose from.

613
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:41,941
Well, we have yellow
tractors and all kinds

614
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,210
Of other yellow tractors.

615
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,614
And we have one or two red
ones, like this one here.

616
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:52,885
So come on down to Verne's
and Cleotus's tractor bonanza

617
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:53,685
Sell out.

618
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,655
And remember our slogan.

619
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:57,957
Hi, I am a tractor.

620
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:03,862
It's 12:51.

621
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,305
Some of Ted Smith's
personalities

622
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,975
Are beginning to meld.

623
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:19,045
His recovery rate
is much too rapid.

624
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:24,583
This poor, tortured man may
soon find peace with himself.

625
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:27,886
I can't let that happen.

626
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:29,755
[Buzz]

627
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,325
Yes, Mrs. Palnor.

628
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:40,066
Uh, Roger Ted Smith is
here to see your, Doctor.

629
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,368
Roger Ted Smith.

630
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:43,169
Send him in.

631
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,308
Roger Ted Smith.

632
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,077
Oh, yes.

633
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:52,311
The army vet.

634
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:13,765
How you doing, Doc?

635
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,816
Hello, Roger Ted Smith.

636
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,691
It's quiet.

637
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,492
Real quiet.

638
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:44,930
I like that.

639
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:46,765
Yes.

640
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,435
I know, Roger, that
sudden loud noises

641
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,470
May cause you extreme trauma.

642
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,882
I'm terribly sorry, Roger.

643
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,684
I didn't mean to frighten you.

644
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:06,685
I wasn't scared.

645
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:11,057
I was, uh, just
developing some film.

646
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:11,990
Mind if I smoke?

647
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,325
DOCTOR: Certainly not.

648
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:48,760
Go right ahead Why
don't you sit down?

649
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,995
I like to stand.

650
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:52,198
Then stand.

651
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:53,632
Why can't I sit?

652
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,735
Do whatever you like.

653
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:57,703
I'll stand.

654
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,949
It's a little bright in here.

655
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,451
Don't you think, Doc?

656
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,987
Oh, I don't know.

657
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,490
Do you think it's
too bright in here?

658
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,492
No.

659
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:23,229
Why do you ask?

660
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:27,266
You seem a little
jumpy today, Doc.

661
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,701
Well, shall we begin?

662
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,672
So how have you been since
the last time we talked?

663
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:38,644
Well, I'm nervous,
tense, hair loss,

664
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,347
Diarrhea, premature aging.

665
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:43,182
Good, you're improving.

666
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:45,016
Anything else?

667
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:49,188
Well, I, uh... I went to
the movies the other day.

668
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:52,391
DOCTOR: What did you see?

669
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:56,728
"Platoon."

670
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,297
"Platoon."

671
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:01,400
A movie designed to make you
relive your most terrible

672
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,303
Nightmares and anxieties.

673
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,070
Good choice.

674
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,842
What did you think?

675
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,646
Well, it brought back a
lot of memories for me,

676
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:17,149
What I was doing in the '60s.

677
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:26,892
See, I played a lot of
army when I was a kid.

678
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:30,996
Some of us came back
a little messed up.

679
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:33,031
You're doing fine, Roger.

680
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,800
Can I get you
something to drink?

681
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,468
Maybe another cigarette?

682
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:37,269
TED: No, thanks.

683
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:38,270
Don't smoke.

684
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,206
Gave it up years ago.

685
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,241
Yes.

686
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:43,041
Please continue.

687
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,115
Yeah.

688
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:53,185
I was there back in '72.

689
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,490
Billy's backyard.

690
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,092
That must have been very
difficult for you, Roger.

691
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,828
How do you feel about it now?

692
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:06,097
TED: Well, I'm OK now.

693
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:10,236
Sometimes I still
have nightmares.

694
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,137
Nightmares?

695
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:14,039
Yeah.

696
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:19,711
Sometimes I can still hear the
sounds of Billy's backyard,

697
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,948
Still hear it like it
happened only yesterday.

698
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:26,385
The sounds of Billy's backyard.

699
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:29,655
Bang, bang.
You're dead.

700
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:30,722
Am not.
Am too.

701
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:31,690
Am not.
Am too.

702
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,558
Am not.
Am too.

703
00:36:32,658 --> 00:36:33,359
Am not.

704
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:34,560
Am too.

705
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,463
Oh.

706
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:38,897
Look, I'm sorry.

707
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:40,999
This is not going to work.

708
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,934
I got too much on my mind.

709
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,304
I'm sorry.

710
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:46,104
That's OK.

711
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,340
Don't worry about it.

712
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,345
This has never,
ever happened before.

713
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,447
It happened just
a few minutes ago.

714
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,749
Well, it's never happened
twice in one night, OK?

715
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:58,550
Jesus.

716
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:02,721
Honey, just relax.

00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:03,555
TED: I don't know.

00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:04,523
You've been working too hard.

719
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:06,458
You're just tense.

720
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,459
Just relax.

721
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,260
OK.

722
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,194
OK.

723
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:09,995
I'm concentrating.

Mm-hmm?

Mm-hmm?

00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,341
Did you put the dog out?

729
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:23,509
I'm sorry.
OK.

730
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:24,242
I'm sorry.
All right.

731
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:25,043
I drifted.

732
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:25,977
It was a drift thing.

733
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,245
The dog, and I drift.

734
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:28,146
Go ahead.

735
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:28,947
Relax.

736
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:31,517
I'm very calm.

737
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:32,318
OK.

738
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:39,825
I think I, uh...
This is, uh... yeah.

739
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:45,997
Wait, wait.

740
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:46,965
There's just a hair.

741
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:47,766
I got a hair.

742
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:48,667
I'm OK.
All right.

743
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,935
Start again.
Here we go.

744
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:51,002
Here we go.
Wait, wait.

745
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:51,803
OK.

746
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,038
OK, now.

747
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,005
I'm thinking.

748
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,240
Just relax.

749
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:57,008
I'm totally relaxed.

750
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,879
I don't have a
care in the world.

751
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:03,515
I'm fine.

752
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,316
Wait a minute.

753
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,784
I think I feel something.

754
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,319
I think I feel something.

755
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,957
Do you feel something?

756
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:14,426
I think I feel something.

757
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,562
I think I feel something too.

758
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:17,363
Really?

759
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:18,163
Mm-hmm.

760
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,898
What?

761
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,232
Disappointment.

762
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,634
Oh, forget it.

763
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,002
Just forget it, all right?

764
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:29,240
Do you have this
problem in your own home?

765
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:31,377
Men, tired of the constant
embarrassment of not being

766
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:33,545
Able to rise to the occasion?

767
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,646
No lead in your pencil?

768
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,047
No starch in your collar?

769
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,383
Is your dick soft?

770
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:38,283
Well, worry no longer.

771
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:39,618
Your troubles are over.

772
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:43,622

00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:48,360
Like one of these?

775
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,661
Please Press-On Penis.

00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,330
They come in 15 decorator
colors, always hard as nails

777
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:55,401
And guaranteed not to
break, crack, or melt.

778
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,068
And there's no problem
with attachment.

779
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,738
Simply locate the specified
area and place a few drops

780
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,673
Of our specially
formulated adhesive,

781
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,976
An adhesive so strong
it suspended this 200

That's right.

787
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:27,499
When nature lies down on
the job, just say please.

788
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,001
Now a new active lay.

789
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:45,784
It's 1:23.

790
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,794
My name's Verne, and this
here is my brother Tuba.

791
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,563
We have a tractor
selling business

792
00:39:57,663 --> 00:40:02,167
That we'd like to tell you
about and show you at this time.

793
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:04,803
Over here, we have many
tractors for you to look

794
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,105
At, like this one for instance.

795
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,607
It is a good tractor.

796
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:11,743
It only has one mile on it.

797
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,879
Over here are some
other tractors.

798
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,380
For instance, this one.

799
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:16,682
Can we get a close up?

800
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:18,116
Thank you.

801
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,585
It is a good tractor.

802
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:20,852
Come on down.

803
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,821
Over here is one more.

804
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:23,655
There it is.

805
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,956
Told you.

806
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,526
Ladies and gentlemen, thank
you for all your support.

807
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:28,860
I love you very much.

808
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,598
And don't forget our motto.

809
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:35,634
One final lesson.

810
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:39,605
This is trimethylglucamide
diacetate.

811
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:48,079
This is 12 molar
hydrochloric oxide

812
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:52,283
Butyl methylide in
trimethylglucamide diacetate.

813
00:40:58,223 --> 00:40:58,924
Any questions?

814
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:09,568
ANNOUNCER: It's time
now for "I'm Sorry."

815
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:12,971
And here's your
host, Bill Chabinzly.

816
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:15,674
Hello and welcome
again to "I'm Sorry,"

817
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:19,010
The show where you have to
beat the show to win the game.

818
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,547
Our current champion
is Eleanor Ponstabule,

819
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:24,115
Winner of 18 consecutive games.

820
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,250
Hello, Eleanor.

821
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,552
Cut the crap, Bill.

822
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,720
I'm getting a little
tired of this.

823
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,188
Tired of winning?

824
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:31,056
What a contender.

825
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,058
You've got to love her.

826
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:36,995
And with her is our new
contender Annette Donahue.

827
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:39,631
Hello, Annette.

828
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,567
Hello.

829
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,468
BILL: Would you like to tell
us something about yourself?

830
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:47,438
No.

831
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:51,743
OK.

832
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,344
Let's get on with the game.

833
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,714
As you know, I'll be setting
you up with various obstacles

834
00:41:55,814 --> 00:42:00,518
That you'll have to overcome in
order to win cash and prizes.

835
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:01,853
[Buzzer]

836
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,088
Yes, Eleanor?

837
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,522
That's not really true.

838
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:05,824
Is it, Bill?

839
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:07,158
BILL: Sure it is.

840
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:11,162
I've overcome every one of
your stupid obstacles every step

841
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,063
Of the way.

842
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:13,364
BILL: Yes, you have.

843
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,933
I've told secrets
about my husband

844
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,768
That's ruined his career.

845
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:20,471
I paraded around naked
for millions to watch.

846
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:23,174
I let you piss on me.

847
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,811
That's right.

848
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:28,379
And Boris, what do
we have for Eleanor

849
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,650
For being such a good sport?

850
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,951
ANNOUNCER: For being
such a good sport,

851
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:36,121
Eleanor has won
absolutely nothing.

852
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,555
Aw.

853
00:42:37,656 --> 00:42:38,489
I'm sorry.

854
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,630
This isn't funny anymore.

855
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,598
BILL: We're just having
a little fun, Eleanor.

856
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:50,235
You can bet that today's
game is for real.

857
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:51,737
Whoever answers
this next question

858
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:53,972
Will get a chance at
our first obstacle

859
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:57,609
And today's grand prize.

860
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:58,910
Yes.

861
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,346
I want some cash now, damn it.

862
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:04,082
Clothes, washer,
dryer, anything.

863
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:06,051
I've earned it.

864
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:08,553
Answer the question
right, Eleanor,

865
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:10,421
And you might really
win something this time.

866
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,494
2 plus 2 equals...

867
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:25,536
[Buzzer]

868
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:27,472
Yes, Eleanor?

869
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:30,075
4.

870
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,844
That's absolutely right.

871
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,813
[Applause]

872
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:43,922
That's scary.

873
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:46,091
How do you select
people for this show?

874
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:48,326
By brain damage?

875
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:49,294
OK, Eleanor.

876
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:51,562
Your obstacle is
really quite simple.

877
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:53,799
Let's see some cash first.

878
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:54,866
Sure.

879
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,335
Boris, what is
Eleanor going to win?

880
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:00,772
ANNOUNCER: She's going to win
this incredible grand prize.

881
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,741
$1 million in gold.

882
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:08,479
Bullshit.

883
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:09,280
Really.

884
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,682
On the level, Eleanor.

885
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:12,718
Prove it.

886
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:16,654
What if I were to hand
you $20,000 in cash

887
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:17,655
As a down payment?

888
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:18,523
Yeah.

889
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:19,925
Now you're talking.

890
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:24,129
This is the first thing
you've actually given me.

891
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:25,196
All right.

892
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:26,898
Your task is quite
simple, really.

893
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:31,069
But today, because
the prize is so big,

894
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,204
We're really going to test you.

895
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:35,106
Our archers are set up on
the other side of the stage.

896
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:35,907
What?

897
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,256
You'll have 30 seconds to run
across their target course,

898
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:53,524
Retreat a tiny sewing needle
from the center of any

899
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:58,196
Of three bullseyes, and return
to me before the buzzer sounds.

900
00:44:58,296 --> 00:44:59,097
Whoa.

901
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,499
What are the
archers going to do?

902
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,770
They'll be blindfolded and
shooting at their targets.

903
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,071
Fuck you.

904
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:08,539
You were the track star
in high school, Eleanor.

905
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,707
Fuck you again.

906
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:12,377
You'll have 15 seconds.

907
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:13,311
Well...

908
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:17,048
And there's plenty
more of this.

909
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:20,218
I don't know.

910
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:21,519
All right, Annette.
Step down.

911
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:22,320
Wait, wait.

912
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,055
All right.

913
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:25,857
15 seconds.

914
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:27,058
That's right, Eleanor.

915
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:29,027
Boris, start the clock.

916
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:30,495
Eleanor, go!

917
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:47,678
Oh, too bad.

918
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:48,679
She was so close.

919
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:03,728
Oh, you bastard.

920
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:04,896
She's done it.

921
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:06,264
She got the needle.

922
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:07,833
Let's see what
you've won, Eleanor.

923
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:09,300
Boris?

924
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,105
ANNOUNCER: For winning today,
Eleanor has won nothing!

925
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:16,774
Oh, I'm sorry.

926
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,410
No, I'm sorry.

927
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,345
That's.

928
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:25,250
Right $20,000 in
counterfeit bills.

929
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,085
What?

930
00:46:27,185 --> 00:46:28,987
I'm sorry.

931
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:30,788
I'll kill you.

932
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:35,827
Oh, somebody get me some help.

933
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,762
Well, that's our
show for today.

934
00:46:37,863 --> 00:46:40,565
Tune in tomorrow when
Annette Donahue becomes

935
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:42,467
Our first place contestant.

936
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:46,037
And Annette, your first
obstacle will be to fuck

937
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,673
The Olympic wrestling team.

938
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:51,109
Looking forward
to lots of prizes?

939
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:52,944
Yes.

940
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,612
I bet you are.

941
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:55,413
Goodbye for now.

942
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,455
DOCTOR (NARRATING): I am
encouraged by my last session

943
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,224
With Ted Smith.

944
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:10,128
Each personality is a
book deal in its own.

945
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:12,830
The officers of the American
Psychiatric Association

946
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:16,567
Arrive in 21 minutes
to access my findings.

947
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:20,071
Once they see him, I will be
recognized as the greatest

948
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,639
Psychiatrist of all time.

949
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:47,265
[Buzz]

950
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:49,334
Yes, Ms. Palnor.

951
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:51,102
MS. PALNOR (ON PHONE): Ted
Smith is here for his five

952
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,170
O'clock appointment.

953
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,504
Oh, yes.

954
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:58,977
Tony Ted Smith, the
fourth and final one.

955
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:00,111
Ask him to wait a minute.

956
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:09,320
TED: Doc, how's it hanging, huh?

957
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,255
Hello, Tony.

958
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:11,322
How are you?

959
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:12,657
Hey, forget about it.

960
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:15,660
You know what I'm saying?

961
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,195
So what are we going
to do today, Doc?

962
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:18,029
Huh?

963
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:20,165
Color in some coloring books?

964
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:21,199
No, Tony.

965
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:24,035
Today we're going
to do something new.

966
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:26,204
These are ink blots.

967
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:28,473
I'm going to show you
these abstract shapes,

968
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:32,710
And I want you to tell me
of what they remind you.

969
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:37,582
Doc, you got entirely too
much free time on your hands.

970
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:38,416
You know what I'm saying?

971
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:43,254
What do you see in this?

972
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:44,789
That looks like a dick.

973
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:46,724
Good.

974
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:48,426
And this one?

975
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:57,635
That looks like a little dick,
like the other one, but little.

976
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,971
I see.

977
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:01,939
And this one?

978
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,341
You know who that looks like?

979
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,077
That looks like my friend Larry
Rubble, who sat in front of me

980
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:06,877
In the third grade.

981
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,179
Un-fucking-believable.

982
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,115
Just like him.

983
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:11,149
What a dick.

984
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:17,955
Tony, I think we should
concentrate on the things

985
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:20,825
That particularly bother you.

986
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:25,596
That way, I can really
get under your skin.

987
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:29,367
I mean, in a helpful
way, of course.

988
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:30,401
You know, Doc?

989
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:31,936
You know what bugs
the shit out of me?

990
00:49:32,037 --> 00:49:34,605
I hate monsters.

991
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,641
They're such dicks.

992
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:38,576
I don't like the way they look.

993
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:40,178
I don't like the way they smell.

994
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:41,446
And I don't like
the way they dress.

995
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:42,780
You know what I'm
talking about, Doc?

996
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,714
The other night, right?

997
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,915
Check this out.
Follow me on this.

998
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:45,983
This is brilliant.

999
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:47,252
The other night, I'm
having a nightmare.

1000
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,420
I must have been sleeping
because that's usually what

1001
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,488
I'm doing having a nightmare.

1002
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:51,822
I don't know if you knew that.

1003
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:54,059
Write that down 'cause you
may, you know, use that later.

1004
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:55,193
So I'm laying there, right?

1005
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,495
And I'm dreaming about
these friends of mine.

1006
00:49:57,595 --> 00:49:58,329
It's spring break.

1007
00:49:58,429 --> 00:49:59,897
We're getting ready to go out.

1008
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,732
They want to do the crazy shit.

1009
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,667
I'm serious.

1010
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:04,902
I'm saying, yo,
what am I, stupid?

1011
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,337
What am I, crazy?

1012
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:07,672
What am I, an asshole?

1013
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:09,006
What am I, retarded?

1014
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:10,108
What am I, a moron?

1015
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:11,976
What am I, a nutcase?

1016
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:14,645
What am I, a shrimp bag?

1017
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:15,980
I know.

1018
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:18,816
Let's go to Daytona Beach.

1019
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,185
Like, totally boring.

1020
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:23,888
Like, everyone goes to Daytona
for spring break, you know?

1021
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:28,226
Like, let's do something,
like, totally different.

1022
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:29,860
Ah, I got it.

1023
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,129
Let's go to Vegas.

1024
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:34,232
WARREN: I hear the women
in Las Vegas are beautiful.

1025
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:37,668
What difference could that
possibly make to you, Warren?

1026
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,637
Thanks, Spike.

1027
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:42,307
Why are you always
putting me down?

1028
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:43,441
Cause it's easy.

1029
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:44,675
You're an asshole.

1030
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,745
Well, Bobby and I have
come up with an idea

1031
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:49,547
That's simply grand.

1032
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:51,882
There's this neat house
over in the Everglades.

1033
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,419
The people that lived there
moved a long time ago.

1034
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:57,722
We can probably rent
it for the whole week.

1035
00:50:57,822 --> 00:51:00,725
Sounds swell, doesn't it?

1036
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:05,263
You just used the word
swell in a sentence.

1037
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:08,032
And the price is
quite affordable.

1038
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:08,866
Why is it so cheap?

1039
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:11,336
Is it a dump?

1040
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:15,773
Well, as Bobby said,
it is in the Everglades.

1041
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:18,376
That sounds, like,
totally different.

1042
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:21,078
And, well, it is
kind of secluded.

1043
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:22,847
We'll be all alone.

1044
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:27,152
And, well, 12 kids got
killed there just last week.

1045
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:28,219
Lets go.

1046
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,121
Party!

1047
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:31,189
BOBBY: It's agreed then.

1048
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:31,989
Yo, yo.

1049
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:32,857
Wait a second.

1050
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:33,624
Wait a second.

1051
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:34,959
What are you guys, crazy?

1052
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:36,294
What are you, stupid?

1053
00:51:36,394 --> 00:51:37,728
What are you, morons?

1054
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,497
We're college kids.

1055
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,432
We're supposed to be
going to Fort Lauderdale,

1056
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:43,734
Drinking beer, getting sick,
vomiting on each other,

1057
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,035
Laugh at each other's underwear.

1058
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:46,371
You know, that kind of... but no.

1059
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:48,773
You guys want to go to
this deserted swamp area

1060
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:51,942
Where there's no phone or people
for just hundreds of miles.

1061
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,313
And well, 12 kids got
killed there last week.

1062
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:57,415
What are you, a moron?

1063
00:51:57,515 --> 00:51:58,983
Oh, Tony.

1064
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:01,452
You're such a stick in the mud.

1065
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:02,487
Yeah, come on, Tone.

1066
00:52:02,587 --> 00:52:04,489
It'll be swell.

1067
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:05,723
There's that word again.

1068
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:07,825
Oh, why don't you come?

1069
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,995
I'll make it worth your while.

1070
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:13,964
Spike, I wear a condom
just talking to you.

1071
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:17,202
BOBBY: All right.

1072
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:18,636
Let's vote on it.

1073
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,004
All those in favor, say aye.

1074
00:52:20,104 --> 00:52:21,539
Aye.

1075
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,308
All opposed, nay.

1076
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:24,609
What am I, a fucking horse?

1077
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:25,410
It's decided.

1078
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:26,211
We leave tomorrow.

1079
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:33,584
Somehow, I get the feeling I've
seen this whole thing before.

1080
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,557
[Music playing]

1081
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:20,631
Well, this is it.

1082
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:22,267
Jesus Christ.

1083
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:24,369
Like, I totally got to go pee.

1084
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:25,770
Oh, isn't it adorable?

1085
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,174
Like, you guys.

1086
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:31,576
I can't believe this.

1087
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:33,278
The door is totally wide open.

1088
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:35,946
Like, come on.

1089
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,284
You know, Spike, I'm glad we're
going to have this time to get

1090
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:41,252
To know each other better.

1091
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:43,921
The truth is, I never
really had the nerve to tell

1092
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:45,290
You how I feel about you.

1093
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:47,492
And well, I wrote
this poem for you.

1094
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:48,959
And I hope you like it.

1095
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:49,760
Oh, shit.

1096
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,696
I want you to have it.

1097
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:54,031
It sort of says
everything that... that...

1098
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:55,099
That I never could.

1099
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:55,900
And I just wanted...

1100
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,701
Thanks, Warren.

1101
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:00,905
I know I've seen
this someplace before.

1102
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:03,874
"13 Fridays,"
"Thanksgiving, Part Two."

1103
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:08,379
Where have I seen...
Hey, did you see that?

1104
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:10,348
That was a point of view shot.

1105
00:54:10,448 --> 00:54:12,450
Whenever they do a
point of view shot,

1106
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,052
That means there's a
monster or something

1107
00:54:15,152 --> 00:54:16,554
Looking out the window at us.

1108
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:17,522
A point of view.

1109
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:20,057
Now what are you going to say?

1110
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:21,926
Tony, what the heck
are you talking about?

1111
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:24,028
I'm just saying, I see one
more point of view shot,

1112
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:25,830
I ain't going in the house.

1113
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,832
[Thunder]

1114
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,834
[Humming]

1115
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:31,836
Whoa.

1116
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:38,008
[Humming]

1117
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:38,809
.

1118
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:01,766
Whoa.

1119
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:08,773
Radical.

1120
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:19,950
[Humming]

1121
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:28,759
Hey, let me the
get that, lamb pie.

1122
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:29,960
Aw.

1123
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,429
Why don't you join the
others in the house?

1124
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:32,430
I'll get the rest of this.

1125
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,732
Oh, pork chop.

1126
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:35,566
Isn't he sweet?

1127
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,367
What are you, crazy?

1128
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:43,674
Looks like rain.

1129
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:46,076
Of course it's going
to rain, you nimrod.

1130
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,512
It's going to thunder
and lightning.

1131
00:55:47,612 --> 00:55:48,879
The window's going to howl.

1132
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:51,616
We're going to have monsters,
more point of view shots,

1133
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:53,618
Bada-bing, bada-bong,
with kibbles and bits.

1134
00:55:53,718 --> 00:55:55,553
It's going to rain.

1135
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:56,521
BOBBY: Hey, come on, Tone.

1136
00:55:56,621 --> 00:55:57,655
You've been watching
too many movies.

1137
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:02,493
All right.

1138
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:03,828
Going in the house.

1139
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:06,063
Please don't cut to
a point of view shot.

1140
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:07,565
I'm begging you.

1141
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:10,167
Don't cut to a
point of view shot.

1142
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:10,968
Damn.

1143
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,115
How come I got nine cards?

1144
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:30,588
You guys are talking too much.

1145
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:32,056
Are you cheating or what?

1146
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:48,439
Wait, is it my turn?

1147
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:49,440
- It's my turn.
- OK.

1148
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,541
Gag me.

1149
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:55,913
I can't believe how
totally boring this is.

1150
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:57,381
I'm going out of my mind.

1151
00:56:57,482 --> 00:56:59,116
Where's all the action?

1152
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:00,284
Aw, guys.

1153
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:01,085
Come on.

1154
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:02,687
It's not so bad.

1155
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:05,422
Look, later we can
toast marshmallows.

1156
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:09,560
And we can sing songs
around the fire.

1157
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,761
I can't believe this.

1158
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:11,896
Spring break.

1159
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:13,964
I'm stuck in a haunted
mansion with some bitch

1160
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:15,466
Who wants to break
into a rousing

1161
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:16,967
Chorus of kumbaya, my lord.

1162
00:57:19,737 --> 00:57:21,906
Like, where's Spike?

1163
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:24,475
She found out she had to do
a nude love scene with Warren.

1164
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:26,777
So she cut out.

1165
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:29,146
God, do you think
that she'll be OK?

1166
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:30,014
What are you, kidding me?

1167
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:30,815
It's raining out.

1168
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:31,716
The wind is howling.

1169
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:33,183
I got trees moving.

1170
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,585
Just point of view shots.

1171
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:37,354
The music has been totally weird
since we walked in this place.

1172
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,288
Yeesh.

1173
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:39,490
She's dead.

1174
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,659
She probably won't even
get a screen credit.

1175
00:57:41,759 --> 00:57:44,061
Bummer, we're all out of beer.

1176
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:48,866
Well, since I'm the only
one here without somebody,

1177
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:53,203
I might as well be the one
that goes down and gets it.

1178
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,171
Hey, Warren.
Come on.

1179
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:54,972
Cheer up.

1180
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:55,940
We're talking about Spike.

1181
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,307
You can do better than her.

1182
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,108
You think so?

1183
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,209
Heck, yeah.

1184
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,410
Thanks, Bobby.

1185
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:03,180
I needed to hear that.

1186
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,481
Come here, you.
Huh?

1187
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:05,482
Come here.

1188
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:06,784
What's the matter, huh?

1189
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:07,818
Don't worry about it.

1190
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:08,919
Don't worry about
nothing, all right?

1191
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:10,320
Look at it this way.

1192
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:14,458
Now that Spike's dead, she'll
probably be a lot nicer to you.

1193
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:15,526
Huh?

1194
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:17,327
Now get out of here,
you little fucking...

1195
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,003
Hey, Warren, it's down
there next to that funny

1196
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:29,106
Looking star thing
painted on the floor.

1197
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:31,475
I bet some Jewish people
must have lived here.

1198
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:43,754
Wait.

1199
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,723
Boy, this stuff looks dangerous.

1200
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,561
How'd that happen?

1201
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,940
Oh, shit.

1202
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,374
I cut my hand.

1203
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,511
This looks serious.

1204
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:09,614
Bring some bandages!

1205
00:59:09,714 --> 00:59:14,719
(SINGING) B-I-N-G-O. G-O.
And Bingo was his name-o.

1206
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:19,590
There was a farmer who had a
dog, and Bingo was his name-o.

1207
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,025
G-O.

1208
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:24,361
A guy could bleed
to death down here.

1209
00:59:24,461 --> 00:59:28,265
(SINGING) O. O. And
Bingo was his name-o.

1210
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:29,066
Hey.

1211
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:39,109
This could get infected, and
then I'd really be in trouble.

1212
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,811
Can't you hear me up there?

1213
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:04,201
Golly, all this excitement's
made me kind of sleepy.

1214
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,035
Yeah, me too.

1215
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:06,771
I guess it's time to turn in.

1216
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,480
Good night, Karen.

1217
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,382
Good night, Julie.

1218
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:19,183
Good night, Rick.

1219
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:20,184
Good night, Bobby.

1220
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:21,151
Good night, Rick.

1221
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:22,086
Good night, Julie.

1222
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:23,287
Good night, Karen.

1223
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:24,288
Good night, Bobby.

1224
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:25,089
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1225
01:00:25,189 --> 01:00:27,725
Shut up, will you?

1226
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:28,859
Good night.

1227
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:29,827
Sweet dreams.

1228
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:31,261
Yeah, fuck the both of you.

1229
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:39,970
Hey, uh, Karen, want to come up
to my room and see my etchings?

1230
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,306
Totally awesome, yeah.

1231
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:44,474
I'll be up in a few minutes, OK?

1232
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:45,710
Great.

1233
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,144
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey.

1234
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:47,812
Come here, you.
What's the matter?

1235
01:00:47,912 --> 01:00:48,478
What are you, crazy?

1236
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:49,646
What are you, stupid?

1237
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:50,715
What are you, a moron?

1238
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,782
What are you, nuts?

1239
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:53,083
What are you, retarded?

1240
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:54,919
You can't have sex.

1241
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:55,720
Hey, don't worry.

1242
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,121
I brought protection.

1243
01:00:57,221 --> 01:01:00,324
No, you moron chipmunk breath.

1244
01:01:00,424 --> 01:01:03,560
If you have sex, you're
guaranteed to die.

1245
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,396
Absolutely, you'll bite it.

1246
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,732
Whoa.

1247
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:10,400
I didn't think Karen
would be that good.

1248
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,936
That's not what...

1249
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:16,473
We're all gonna die.

1250
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:17,875
I know it.

1251
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:20,344
I just wish I could remember
where I've seen this before.

1252
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:26,683
Like, what's an etching?

1253
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:39,196
OK.

1254
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:42,867
So far, everything
is hunky-dory.

1255
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:47,404
As long as nobody does nothing
stupid like have sex or go

1256
01:01:47,504 --> 01:01:51,909
Looking for somebody in the dark
alone, we should be all right.

1257
01:01:58,448 --> 01:01:59,549
Excuse me.

1258
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:00,785
Where did you go?

1259
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:01,585
No, no, no.

1260
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:02,787
Where did you go?

1261
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:03,587
I was over there.

1262
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:04,855
I came here to stop.

1263
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:05,890
You cut away.

1264
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,357
Who'd you cut away to, huh?

1265
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:08,192
A monster?

1266
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:09,726
Did you cut away to a monster?

1267
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:10,961
Yes, you did.

1268
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:14,131
Don't ever cut away to a
monster when I'm in a scene.

1269
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,165
That scares me.

1270
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:16,233
You stay with me.

1271
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:17,868
I'm going to the bathroom.

1272
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:18,668
You stay with me.

1273
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:20,304
This way, I know I'm safe.

1274
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:21,705
All right?
You come with me.

1275
01:02:21,806 --> 01:02:22,539
Hi, Tony.

1276
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:23,640
Whoa!

1277
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,442
Oh, Julie, you scared
the piss out of me.

1278
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:26,710
There's piss all over.

1279
01:02:26,811 --> 01:02:29,980
I thought you were a big
monster with a bloody machete.

1280
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,249
Nope.

1281
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:33,583
I'll... I'll just be a minute.

1282
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:36,086
I just have to wash
my face, comb my hair,

1283
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:38,455
Brush and floss my teeth,
shave my arms and legs,

1284
01:02:38,555 --> 01:02:43,160
Moisturize, do my nails, tweeze
my brows, and, um... oh, yeah.

1285
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,128
Weigh myself.

1286
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:45,129
Tonight?

1287
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:46,296
Well, yes, silly.

1288
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:52,970
What was that?

1289
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:53,770
Huh?

1290
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:54,805
Oh, don't worry about it.

1291
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:56,040
It's probably just
Warren or something.

1292
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:56,907
We got the camera with us.

1293
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:58,275
It's OK.

1294
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:01,478
Listen, uh, I'm crazy about
you, you know what I'm saying?

1295
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:02,679
I'm nuts.

1296
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,481
And it's making me nuts
that I'm crazy about you.

1297
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:05,449
You know what I mean?

1298
01:03:05,549 --> 01:03:07,584
Tony, you know
that Bobby and I are

1299
01:03:07,684 --> 01:03:10,354
Going to be married as soon as
daddy finds him the right job.

1300
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:11,321
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1301
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:12,389
I know that.

1302
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:13,858
I'm just saying, you
know, like, after we

1303
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:20,397
Get out of here, maybe, uh, you
and I could, uh, get together.

1304
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:23,300
We are together now, silly.

1305
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,835
I'll let you know
when I'm finished.

1306
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:27,671
But that's not...

1307
01:03:41,718 --> 01:03:42,887
Like, where's Warren, you know?

1308
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:44,855
He's been gone for, like, ever.

1309
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:45,822
Totally.

1310
01:03:45,923 --> 01:03:48,358
Don't worry about Warren.

1311
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:49,994
He probably went to get
himself something to eat.

1312
01:03:50,094 --> 01:03:51,495
You know how much he likes food.

1313
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:08,778
[Snoring]

1314
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:21,225
Like, Warren was
really feeling low.

1315
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:24,094
You don't think he'd do
anything, like, stupid, do you?

1316
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,496
Uh-uh.

1317
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,598
What are you doing?

1318
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,800
It's called... it's
called foreplay.

1319
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:31,601
Oh, OK.

1320
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:38,308
What's the matter?

1321
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:40,410
Like, my straps keep
falling down, you know?

1322
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,485
Where are you going?

1323
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:51,088
I'm going to have
to go regroup.

1324
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:54,291
I mean, freshen up.

1325
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,493
Hold those thoughts.

1326
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:59,096
Oh, and, like, bring some
puzzle cards back with you, OK?

1327
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:16,880
And for her and my
protection, should be enough.

1328
01:05:16,981 --> 01:05:17,681
Ow!

1329
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:27,757
Karen, girl, like it or
not, I am yours tonight.

1330
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:28,892
Like, totally.

1331
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:45,742
Hey, come on, Julie.

1332
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:49,146
You in there or what?

1333
01:05:49,246 --> 01:05:50,847
Julie?

1334
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,351
Oh, no.

1335
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,353
Julie?

1336
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,855
Julie?

1337
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,324
Julie?

1338
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:03,327
Julie, please answer me, Julie.

1339
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:04,828
This is how it always starts.

1340
01:06:04,928 --> 01:06:05,829
I come looking for you.

1341
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:07,064
I say, Julie, Julie.

1342
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:07,864
You don't answer.

1343
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,399
The music gets very strange.

1344
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:12,869
The camera angles get weird.

1345
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,838
See?

1346
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:17,807
Julie, please don't be
dead behind in the bathtub.

1347
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,776
Please don't be dead.

1348
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:20,677
Oh, god.

1349
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:21,645
Please.

1350
01:06:21,745 --> 01:06:24,548
Oh, thank god.

1351
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:25,549
Whew.

1352
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:26,983
You can straighten
the camera angle.

1353
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:28,352
She's not dead.

1354
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:30,487
Thanks.

1355
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:32,122
That would be terrible
if she was dead.

1356
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:34,124
I would hate to see
that, all chopped

1357
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:35,325
Up in pieces in the bath tub.

1358
01:06:35,425 --> 01:06:37,394
You know, cause I
ain't fucked her yet.

1359
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,129
Let me just have a bowl.

1360
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:45,569
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1361
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:47,003
Oh.

1362
01:06:47,104 --> 01:06:49,439
I knew this would happen.

1363
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:53,310
Christ on a crutch.

1364
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,079
He's dead.

1365
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:56,946
No shit, Dick Tracy.

1366
01:06:57,047 --> 01:06:59,649
Somebody chopped his
fucking head off.

1367
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:01,051
Hey, Tone, Tone.
Calm down.

1368
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:01,885
You don't know for sure.

1369
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:03,320
You're jumping to conclusions.

1370
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,422
We don't know if
somebody murdered him.

1371
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:06,523
Who knows?

1372
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:10,994
Maybe, um... maybe it
was just an accident.

1373
01:07:11,095 --> 01:07:13,297
An accident?

1374
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:15,732
What are you, fucking retarded?

1375
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:19,369
Like he was throwing up in the
toilet, and the lid came down,

1376
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:20,437
Cut his head off.

1377
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:21,838
What are you, a moron?

1378
01:07:21,938 --> 01:07:23,273
What are you, a shrimp basket?

1379
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:24,441
What are you, an air head?

1380
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,842
What are you, a ratchet wrench?

1381
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:26,776
What are you, a hubcap?

1382
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,112
Tony, Tony.

1383
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:30,480
Hey, listen, man, you are
under a lot of pressure here.

1384
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:32,816
Shut up.

1385
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:34,651
Maybe we should
warn the others.

1386
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:35,685
Fuck the others.

1387
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,354
I'm out of here, pal.

1388
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:38,288
I'm leaving.

1389
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:39,456
Hey, Tone, you
can't just leave.

1390
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:40,257
Yeah, watch me.

1391
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:44,994
Oh, now, did you see that?

1392
01:07:45,095 --> 01:07:45,829
See what?

1393
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:46,830
Over there.

1394
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:47,964
What?

1395
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,666
Well, show him.

1396
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:50,434
Oh, come on.

1397
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:51,868
That is not fair.

1398
01:07:51,968 --> 01:07:53,503
Hey, I don't see anything.

1399
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:54,304
Yeah?

1400
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:55,939
You are an asshole.

1401
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:56,973
And so are you.

1402
01:08:11,655 --> 01:08:13,123
Rick?

1403
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:13,923
Rick?

1404
01:08:17,161 --> 01:08:17,861
Rick?

1405
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:25,302
Rick?

1406
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:30,740
Rick?

1407
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:48,558
Rick?

1408
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:59,135
I just don't... don't
even believe this.

1409
01:08:59,236 --> 01:09:01,838
We have just got
to think rationally.

1410
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:03,006
No, we don't.

1411
01:09:03,106 --> 01:09:04,174
We have to panic.

1412
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:06,443
We have to get hysterical.

1413
01:09:06,543 --> 01:09:08,512
We have to freak out.

1414
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:10,514
Well, call the police.

1415
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:12,449
I don't even have
to check, man.

1416
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:14,751
I know that the phone wires
have been cut already.

1417
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:16,119
Haven't you ever
seen this before?

1418
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,053
What are you, a moron?

1419
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:17,987
What are you, stupid?

1420
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:19,389
What are you, crazy?

1421
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:20,490
What are you, nuts?

1422
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:24,561
What we gotta do is
get out of the house.

1423
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,196
Like, what's going on?

1424
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:27,564
There's so much noise.

1425
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,234
I totally can't sleep.

1426
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:33,370
Like, where's Rick?

1427
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,805
Listen to me, both of you.

1428
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:37,607
Rick is dead.

1429
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:38,408
Yeah.

1430
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,476
Oh, god.

1431
01:09:39,576 --> 01:09:41,478
And we don't even
know how it happened.

1432
01:09:41,578 --> 01:09:43,213
Yes, we do.

1433
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:47,317
There's a maniac running around
the house, chopping people up

1434
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:50,254
And drop kicking them
into toilet bowls.

1435
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:53,056
"Nightmare With an Elm,"
"Chainsaw Monster."

1436
01:09:53,156 --> 01:09:55,325
Don't you people
go to the movies?

1437
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:57,894
Oh, Bobby, I'm so frightened.

1438
01:09:57,994 --> 01:09:58,928
Oh, don't worry, honey.

1439
01:09:59,028 --> 01:09:59,929
I'm here.

1440
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,298
Oh.

1441
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:04,568
You know, I really hope I die
next because the both of you

1442
01:10:04,668 --> 01:10:06,135
Are making me nauseous.

1443
01:10:06,236 --> 01:10:07,837
I'm getting out of here.

1444
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:10,807
Move over, bimbo head.

1445
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:14,978
Like, Warren's been missing
for quite some time now.

1446
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:18,615
Maybe I should go
check on him alone

1447
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:21,951
In the deep, dark
basement alone.

1448
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,688
Like, you guys wait here.

1449
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:27,724
Maybe I should go with you.

1450
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:29,058
Like, why?

1451
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,360
What could possibly happen?

1452
01:10:59,556 --> 01:11:01,691
Gee.

1453
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:02,492
Warren!

1454
01:11:18,342 --> 01:11:19,042
Warren?

1455
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:29,819
Warren, are you,
like, down here?

1456
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:31,788
Warren, like, if this
is some kind of joke,

1457
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:34,924
Like, it's not funny.

1458
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:35,725
Warren?

1459
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:43,733
Warren?

1460
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,336
Is, like, that you behind the
slightly open door with light

1461
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:48,538
Shining through and blood
all over the doorknob?

1462
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:49,539
I think so.

1463
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,248
Warren, like, if you're
trying to scare me, like,

1464
01:11:59,349 --> 01:12:01,184
It's totally not going to work.

1465
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:06,890
Totally disgusting.

1466
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,324
Grody.

1467
01:12:08,425 --> 01:12:10,159
Warren?

1468
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:11,528
Everything's going to be OK.

1469
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:12,462
We're going to get married.

1470
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:13,430
We're going to have kids.

1471
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:14,498
They're going to play football.

1472
01:12:14,598 --> 01:12:15,965
Where's Karen?

1473
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:19,636
She's down in the basement
looking for Warren.

1474
01:12:19,736 --> 01:12:22,772
You let Karen go down
in the basement alone?

1475
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:23,607
Why?

1476
01:12:23,707 --> 01:12:24,841
You think she needs our help?

1477
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:25,642
Forget it.

1478
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:27,276
She's already dead.

1479
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:28,678
[Screaming]

1480
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:30,013
Sounds like she got
it in the throat.

1481
01:12:30,113 --> 01:12:31,280
Oh, who's doing this?

1482
01:12:31,381 --> 01:12:33,950
Bobby, what's going on?

1483
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,053
Thank god the electricity
hasn't gone off.

1484
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:39,222
Don't say that!

1485
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:40,624
Oh, what are you, stupid?

1486
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:41,858
What are you, crazy?

1487
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:43,560
What are you, nuts?

1488
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:48,231
Don't anybody mention the
doors being nailed shut.

1489
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:49,899
[Hammers banging]

1490
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:50,700
That's it.

1491
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,735
We're all dead.

1492
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:52,936
I'll probably go next.

1493
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:53,970
Then you, Bobby.

1494
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,805
Julie, it'll just be
you and the monster.

1495
01:12:55,905 --> 01:12:57,373
You'll run around the
house for a while.

1496
01:12:57,474 --> 01:13:01,110
You'll trip, sprain your
ankle, rub it till February.

1497
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,446
Then you'll probably lean over.

1498
01:13:02,546 --> 01:13:04,380
He'll pop you in the eye
with a knitting needle.

1499
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:05,582
The cops will show up.

1500
01:13:05,682 --> 01:13:06,983
You'll spend the rest of
your life in the crazy bin

1501
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:09,419
With a severe case
of looney tunes.

1502
01:13:09,519 --> 01:13:12,456
But it's just one
guy against all us.

1503
01:13:12,556 --> 01:13:13,690
We can beat this guy.

1504
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:14,624
Yeah.

1505
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,193
Assuming the dead
don't reanimate.

1506
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:18,695
[Screaming]

1507
01:13:21,264 --> 01:13:21,965
Sorry.

1508
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,114
Did you see that?

1509
01:13:38,214 --> 01:13:39,449
They just cut away.

1510
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:41,518
We only have a few minutes left.

1511
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:43,620
Well, I'm not going
to give up this easy.

1512
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,854
I'm taking charge.

1513
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:47,524
Oh, Bobby, what
are you going to do?

1514
01:13:47,624 --> 01:13:49,559
Yeah, Rambo, what now?

1515
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:52,629
Tone, you take Julie.

1516
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:53,630
Go to our bedroom.

1517
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:54,864
I'll go to the kitchen.

1518
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:57,033
I'll get some weapons,
knives, anything I can find.

1519
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:58,301
Wait, wait wait.

1520
01:13:58,401 --> 01:14:01,938
You want me to take your
girlfriend up to your bedroom

1521
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:05,609
When you go through the
kitchen to get knives?

1522
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:07,110
Good plan.

1523
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:08,411
Wait for me there.

1524
01:14:08,512 --> 01:14:10,413
Don't let anybody in
and lock the door.

1525
01:14:10,514 --> 01:14:13,316
Oh, Bobby, please be careful.

1526
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:14,317
Oh, come on, honey.

1527
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:16,052
I'll be all right.

1528
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:18,021
Now go.

1529
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:20,356
Oh.

1530
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,692
Do you think he'll be OK?

1531
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:27,030
Well, nope.

1532
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:27,831
Huh?

1533
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:54,423
[Snoring]

1534
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:57,393
This is simply awful.

1535
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:58,194
This is terrible.

1536
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:04,634
I hope Bobby's OK.

1537
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:11,040
We're sup... oh, we're
supposed to be married.

1538
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,743
What am I going
to tell my father?

1539
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:15,144
Look.

1540
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:17,346
What am I going to do?

1541
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:22,385
If you were to think...
Maybe I'm nuts, all right?

1542
01:15:22,485 --> 01:15:23,787
Maybe I'm crazy.

1543
01:15:23,887 --> 01:15:26,022
But Bobby knew what
he was doing when he

1544
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:27,156
Stayed down there, all right?

1545
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,457
He's an asshole.

1546
01:15:28,558 --> 01:15:29,559
He's a shrimp boat.

1547
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:30,760
He's a retard.

1548
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:31,928
He's a moron.

1549
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,096
He's a biscuit head.

1550
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:34,764
You know what I'm saying?

1551
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,766
No.

1552
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:38,935
Look, the man knows
what he's doing.

1553
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,336
He's a grown man.
Let him do it.

1554
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:41,237
All right?

1555
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:43,272
No, you don't understand.

1556
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,708
What?

1557
01:15:44,808 --> 01:15:49,245
Well, Bobby and I never, well...

1558
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:50,046
What?

1559
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:51,114
You know.

1560
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:52,215
What?

1561
01:15:52,315 --> 01:15:54,718
Well, you know.

1562
01:15:54,818 --> 01:15:56,886
Things that are yellow.

1563
01:15:56,986 --> 01:15:58,087
No.

1564
01:15:58,187 --> 01:16:00,423
Things that begin
with the letter L.

1565
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:01,224
No.

1566
01:16:01,324 --> 01:16:02,391
We... we didn't...

1567
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,994
Things that don't have
hair on their armpits.

1568
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:06,129
No, Tony.

1569
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:06,930
Things with sweaty...

1570
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:08,397
Oh.

1571
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:11,367
I don't want to die a virgin.

1572
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:13,369
[Sobbing]

1573
01:16:15,471 --> 01:16:17,073
Let me get this straight.

1574
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:19,575
Bobby bites it down
there in the basement.

1575
01:16:19,676 --> 01:16:22,278
Then it's just me and you left?

1576
01:16:22,378 --> 01:16:23,079
Yes.

1577
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:29,819
I'll be right back.

1578
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:31,788
Oh.

1579
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:33,790
[Sobbing]

1580
01:16:58,181 --> 01:17:01,751
He's behind the couch.

1581
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:03,019
Behind the couch.

1582
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:12,929
Oh, don't act like
you wouldn't do it.

1583
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:13,730
All right?

1584
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:26,710
[Screaming]

1585
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:42,826
What am I, crazy?

1586
01:17:48,732 --> 01:17:49,432
Is he...

1587
01:17:49,532 --> 01:17:51,067
Oh, yes, he's very...

1588
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,635
Oh.

1589
01:17:52,736 --> 01:17:53,803
There were too many of them.

1590
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:55,404
They overpowered me.

1591
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:58,207
I took out three of
them all by myself.

1592
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:00,543
You know, Bobby... he
wasn't very strong.

1593
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:01,945
But I did the best I could.

1594
01:18:02,045 --> 01:18:04,347
I did it for you, Julie.

1595
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:05,648
How many are there?

1596
01:18:05,749 --> 01:18:09,052
Oh, everybody's dead, just
like I said it would happen.

1597
01:18:09,152 --> 01:18:10,586
They're all walking
around with a zombie look.

1598
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,722
They're killing stuff
that ain't even alive.

1599
01:18:12,822 --> 01:18:14,824
It's un-fucking-believable.

1600
01:18:14,924 --> 01:18:17,761
Hey, look, it's just me and you.

1601
01:18:17,861 --> 01:18:21,931
We're the only ones left
with a few precious moments.

1602
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,067
Oh, no.

1603
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:27,636
Uh, listen, before Bobby
died, he said one thing.

1604
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:28,604
What?

1605
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:29,438
What did he say?

1606
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,640
He said, Tony, do me a favor.

1607
01:18:31,741 --> 01:18:33,209
What am I, nuts?

1608
01:18:33,309 --> 01:18:34,343
He said that?

1609
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:35,378
No.

1610
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:38,381
He said, Tony, you
gotta do one thing.

1611
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:44,653
Before I die, make
Julie a woman for me.

1612
01:18:44,754 --> 01:18:46,155
He said that?

1613
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:47,123
Yes, he did.

1614
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:16,185
Make sure you get a close up
of this because she's got a set

1615
01:19:16,285 --> 01:19:33,369
Of tits like you... Oh, god.

1616
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:34,203
Oh.

1617
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:35,004
Oh.

1618
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:37,974
You sure you're a virgin?

1619
01:19:38,074 --> 01:19:39,308
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait.

1620
01:19:39,408 --> 01:19:40,109
Whoa.

1621
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:42,445
What am I doing?

1622
01:19:42,545 --> 01:19:45,915
If I have sex, I'm gonna die.

1623
01:19:46,015 --> 01:19:48,484
If anybody has sex in these
movies, they always die.

1624

It's a Hollywood law.

1625
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:52,255
Tony, life is not a movie.

1626
01:19:52,355 --> 01:19:53,456
You think so?

1627
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:54,824
Yes.

1628
01:19:54,924 --> 01:19:55,758
Fuck it.

1629
01:19:55,859 --> 01:19:56,792
Oh, wait a sec.
Wait a sec.

You're in my light.

1632
01:19:58,527 --> 01:19:59,228

Are you getting this?

1635
01:20:19,015 --> 01:20:20,249
This is un-fucking-believable.

1636
01:20:20,349 --> 01:20:21,417
Here, zoom in over
here one time.

1637
01:20:21,517 --> 01:20:22,218
And no pubic shots.

1638
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,119
She's a good girl.

1639
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:32,395
Yeah.

I'm doing this for you, Bobby.

Hey, I'm sure he
really appreciates it.

1646
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:56,685
Could you move to the
left just a little bit?

1647

Hey, could you guys
keep it down out there?

Hey, come on, fellas.

1650
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:14,971
Just give me five seconds.

1651
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:26,582
Oh, come... I wouldn't
do this to you.

1652
01:21:26,682 --> 01:21:29,352
Oh, man.

1653
01:21:29,452 --> 01:21:30,286
Bobby.

1654
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,788
Oh.

1655
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:36,259
Oh, shit.

No.

1658
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:39,195
No, Bobby, no.

1659
01:21:39,295 --> 01:21:40,163
I didn't like it.

1660
01:21:40,263 --> 01:21:41,130
I didn't like it.

1661

Forget it.

1665

I'm already dead, you asshole.

1666
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:56,279
There's no one left to kill.

Got any twos?

Go fish.

1669
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:06,655
I knew this would happen.

1670
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:11,527
What are you, stupid?

1671
01:22:11,627 --> 01:22:12,996
What are you, crazy?

What are you, a moron?

What are you, retarded?

1674
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:16,832
Gee.

1675
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:19,002
So what do you think, Doc, huh?

1676
01:22:19,102 --> 01:22:21,237
Am I crazy or what?

1677
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:25,274
Well, I think you're on the
road to a speedy recovery.

1678
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:26,575
You think so, Doc?

1679
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:27,843
Well, sure.

1680
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,679
I mean, it will take
years yet, of course.

1681
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:34,950
You know, Doc, no one's
ever believed in me before.

1682
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:38,354
DOCTOR: Tony, what
happened to your accent?

1683
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:39,688
Tony?

1684
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,390
Why are you calling me Tony?

1685
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:44,927
My name is Ted Smith.

1686
01:22:45,028 --> 01:22:47,130
Yeah.

I'm Ted Smith.

1688
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:52,635
No, it can't be.

1689
01:22:52,735 --> 01:22:55,571
Doc, I... I feel
like a new person.

1690
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:57,273
You've... you've changed me.

1691
01:22:57,373 --> 01:22:59,842
I... how can I ever thank you?

1692
01:22:59,942 --> 01:23:02,145
You can't be cured.

I'll send them right in.

No, wait.

1699
01:23:15,158 --> 01:23:16,925
You don't know what you've done.
Maybe not.

1700
01:23:17,026 --> 01:23:18,127
But I know what
you've done for me.

1701
01:23:18,227 --> 01:23:20,296
You've freed me from
my mental prison.

1702
01:23:20,396 --> 01:23:21,630
I'm forever grateful.

1703

No, don't you remember?

1704
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,534
You were traumatized
when you were three.

1705
01:23:25,634 --> 01:23:26,335
Boo!

What do you see?

1709
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,315
I see the man
that saved my life.

1710
01:23:39,415 --> 01:23:41,317
How could I ever repay you?

1711
01:23:41,417 --> 01:23:43,086
You're not listening.

1713
01:23:44,987 --> 01:23:49,525
(SINGING) I'm going to kill you.

1714
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:50,793
What does that look like?

1715
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:52,095
It looks like an ink blot.

1716

It's a dick.

He'll rip you to pieces.

1724
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,149
He's got a gun.

1725
01:24:13,249 --> 01:24:14,617
Just like in the
movie, "Platoon."

1726
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:15,418

01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:36,339
Just friends.
