<i>Hard or soft?</i>

3
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:33,295
Tough.

<i>It's probably sad</i>
<i>7, possibly as much as 8.</i>

8
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:45,704
You want to measure it by now?

9
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:47,305

About six and a half...

That's good.
Not bad.

16
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:04,451
<i>Hey, did Emily</i>

Yes.

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,932
Um, yes.

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,067
How would you do that?

26
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,668
What would you say?

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,935
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

28
00:01:28,937 --> 00:01:31,871
Like, if she was here now,

29
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:34,106

00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:37,642
-Is More goals?
<i>No, not yet.</i>

33
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:46,048

00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:27,760
<i>Yes. I'm still working on it.</i>

181
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:27,760
<i>Hello?</i>

182
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:30,195
<i>Yes, this is good.</i>

183
00:12:38,536 --> 00:12:40,103
<i>-Džoooone!</i>
<i>What is.</i>

184
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:41,270
Hi, Happy birthday.

185
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:42,504
Thank you.

186
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:45,773
Where's Em?

187
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:48,708
I do not know, it probably comes with his brother.

188
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:53,311
Someone wrote a new song.

189
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:54,745
Yes, I'll play tomorrow in the church

190
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:56,780
I thought
and you can hear it later.

191
00:12:56,782 --> 00:12:58,348
I can not wait.

192
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,149
Shut up, man.

193
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,317
Hi, Logan.

194
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:03,418
<i>Hi.</i>

195
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:10,089
Do you want to sing backing vocals
tomorrow?

196
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:11,156
Yes.

197
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:12,490
Please.

198
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:14,758
Is there anyone at home?

199
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,192
<i>Hey, there they are.</i>

200
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:17,359
Hello folks!
-Hello!

201
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:20,228
- I did not know you were coming home.
- The younger brother of the full 17

202
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,362
This is a great thing.

203
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:22,429
Absolutely, how's school?

204
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:23,396
-Rasturam.
- I bet.

205
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:26,732
- Would you met at Columbia
Christian, are not you? - <i> Sure.</i>

206
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:28,567
Miss us in the younger age group, autumn.

207
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:29,534
Thank you.

208
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:32,103
Okay, let's do this.

209
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:33,204
You already have some children here,

210
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:35,272
Good, good, good.

211
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,539
How are you?

212
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,774
Oh, you know.

213
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,775
I'm pregnant.

214
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:42,711
Oh, my God!

215
00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:44,446
I'm pregnant !!

216
00:13:52,787 --> 00:13:54,587
Uh oh, here I am.

217
00:13:55,522 --> 00:13:57,456
<i>I should not bring me presents.</i>

218
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,124
These are for another celebration.

219
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:01,426
Happy birthday.
We have to go in five minutes.

220
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:04,529
Get in.

221
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:05,396
Kristin did not know how to swim.

222
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:06,063
Perhaps, though.

223
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:06,730
You do not swim ?!

224
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:08,364
I do not see the point.

225
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:10,132
Hey, Henry, look who I found.

226
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:11,833
Hi, folks.

227
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:13,534
Let's go in!

228
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:16,803
Okay, let's go.
-Yes.

229
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:18,437
Hide your diversity, ladies.

230
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:20,639
-The Best. Fuck. Celebration. Behavior.
-Oh my God.

231
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:22,674
Hey, what are you doing here?

232
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:24,108
At the celebration itself.

233
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,542
I did not know you were acquainted.

234
00:14:25,544 --> 00:14:26,809
Yes, we go to church together.

235
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:28,310
How do you two know each other?

236
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:30,111
We are together in a group, you idiot.

237
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:31,445
Oh, yes, exactly.

238
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:32,779
You know Logan, right?

239
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:34,647
Yes, you were in the choir at
<i>Gays and Dolls </i>, is not it?

240
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:35,781
Yes.

241
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:38,316
Come on, Logan.
-Yes.

242
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:40,551
Well, what did you bring me?

243
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:41,518
Journal.

244
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,119
Wait, what do you mean?

245
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:45,454
Why should I brought journal?

246
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,430
What's up? <i>

248
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:00,133
Hi, folks.

249

<i>Are you going to take a bath?</i>

250
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,886
I do not know. Probably not.

251
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:26,155
Girl, you gotta
satisfy physical needs.

252
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:27,756
No matter what you tell me?

253
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:29,858
I'm the one who seduced
seven freshmen or twelve,

254
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,593
Whatever, and you look wonderful,

255
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:32,794
Where your esteemed freshman?

256
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:38,666
O, who is this boy?

257
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:40,601
When?

258
00:15:40,603 --> 00:15:42,636
What do you mean who?

259
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:43,637
The guy in the red.

260
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:46,873
Gabe, this is Henry's best friend.
On the twelfth.

261
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,241
Is not he older than him?

262
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:49,875
<i>Yeah, but he's</i>

263
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,877
Two years younger than us.

264
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,346
Yet her.

265
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:56,715
How is the Bible school?

266
00:15:56,717 --> 00:16:00,685
It's not a Bible school,
to a Christian college.

267
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:02,253
Are you seeing someone?

268
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:05,889
Yes.

269
00:16:05,891 --> 00:16:07,924
Why do you say?

270
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,593
I'm not interested.
<i>That's not true.</i>

271
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,396
What's wrong?

272
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:15,597
Due to Arona?

273
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:17,697
Swap topic.

274
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,500
Why are you wearing that ring?

275
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:23,467
Cheyenne.

276
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:24,634
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:30,472
Well... Gabe.

278
00:16:30,474 --> 00:16:33,575
We'll go for a coffee tomorrow in the church.

279
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:38,179
Perhaps, I have to work until 8:30,
, I think maybe 9

280
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:39,713
'll Let you know.

281
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,648
Yes.

282
00:16:49,222 --> 00:16:50,922
Hello.
-Hello.

283
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:52,390
Hey, how's it going?

284
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:56,894
... It's going well.
Yes, I'm fine.

285
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,362
- So, how's your party?
- OK OK.

286
00:16:59,364 --> 00:17:02,932
I listened to your podcast this morning,
beautiful.

287
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:05,367
Oh, thank you.

288
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,502
The group <i> Wall </i>?

289
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:10,304
Yes, they were great.
-Yes.

290
00:17:10,306 --> 00:17:12,239
I heard you talk about them in your podcast,

291
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:14,975
So I looked at them and are really good.

292
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:16,276
<i>Yes.</i>

293
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:18,978
I think I could do without swearing,

294
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,347
I think they're really good.

295
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,415
Yes, totally.

296
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:30,254
Do you want to chorus for
<i>Hi, baby! </i>?

297
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:31,521
I do not know.

298
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:34,524
My mom wants to
focus on learning.

299
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,392
I think I've never met your family
.

300
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:38,993
I saw your dad
when I was driving.

301
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:40,661
That's your dad, right?

302
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:42,862
Stepfather, yes.

303
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:49,501
-I Am so excited for you.
-Thank you.

304
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,336
That was a surprise.

305
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:52,236
That's fine.

306
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,570
And it was so.

307
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:59,009
Hey, guys, do not be

320
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:25,595

-Food Looks really nice, Bob.
Hello, Grace.

322
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:30,032
Are children having a good time there?

323
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:34,702
Oh, here's Kate, this is about Henry,

324
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:36,003
It's nothing, just socks and wallet.

325
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:39,139

Love, kindness and friendship.

Yes, but I think something božansko-

353
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:55,560
Oh, divine?
-Yes.

00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:16,043
Nice.

362
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:17,944
<i>Think about it.</i>

363
00:20:18,178 --> 00:20:20,479
<i>We'll talk later.</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

364
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,080
<i>divine </i>: a musical.

365
00:20:23,082 --> 00:20:26,716
We will seriously burn in hell.

366
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:27,817
Do you think that we burn?

367
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:29,451
What?
You heard me.

368
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:30,618
Oh, I do not know.

369
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,152
What? Will.

370
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:55,139
- <i> Hey, can we play music?</i>
<i>- Sure.</i>

371
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:55,139
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

372
00:20:55,141 --> 00:21:00,643
<i>Yes. Sorry about that.</i>
-What station you want, Silver Spirit?

373
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:03,112
No, please.

374
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:05,247
We can not let anything vulgar, I'm sorry.

375
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:08,950
Let's just listen to what they want, they will exceed
over it.

376
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:10,251
I have a mix here.

377
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:11,585
<i>How do you call it?</i>

378
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:13,486
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

379
00:21:14,654 --> 00:21:16,655
-Zabavljaš Be?
-Yes.

380
00:21:16,657 --> 00:21:17,956
Is it the pectoral muscles?

381
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,223
Yes, finally.

382
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:21,692
-Are You doing pushups?
I work what I can.

383
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,660
Okay, let's go.

384
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:24,994
Ljuljaj.

385
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,012
I'm going to jump in here
if not behave decently,

386
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:50,815
<i>what do you think about this?</i>

387
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,685
I do not know why you girls
nose so small bathing suit. Yes.

388
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,754
It looks like naked.

389
00:21:57,756 --> 00:21:59,122
I mean I have a bikini, but-

390
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:00,523
You have a bikini?

391
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:02,591
Yes, but-
<i>-For the name of the world, Candice.</i>

392
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:03,925
It is quite modest.

393
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:05,559
I hear you're pregnant,

394
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:07,594
<i>that's great.</i>

395
00:22:07,596 --> 00:22:09,195
Thank you.

396
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,197
I thought
to get there.

397
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,831
No, you will not do.

398
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,936
<i>Candice, honey,</i>

399
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:24,673
If you're familiar with the major problems

400
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:28,543
Sex trafficking that is going on?

401
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:30,044
<i>not</i>

402
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:32,880
Well, I'll throw this on the grill,

403
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:34,648
Unless you...

404
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,750
Are you okay?

405
00:22:37,752 --> 00:22:39,051
Yes.

406
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:41,653
Are you okay?

407
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:43,655
Yes, I'm fine.

408
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:45,590
Just a lot of thought.

409
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:47,158
Yes.

410
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,327
It's nice to have a family again in the house, though.

411
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,329
Yes, that's right.

412
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,099
<i>Hey.</i>

413
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,870
You look wonderful.

414
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,110
Thank you.

415
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:16,280
Can I do something to help?

416
00:23:16,282 --> 00:23:18,181
- <i> No. not just enjoy it.</i>
Are you sure?

417
00:23:18,183 --> 00:23:21,050
If you'd like to slice the cheese
there, it would Bilobil®

418
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:22,785
No, no, it should be
teramo to do so.

419
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:24,753
She asked if she could...
With pleasure.

420
00:23:24,755 --> 00:23:26,855
Believe it or not, Bob,
some people prefer to be at your service.

421
00:23:26,857 --> 00:23:28,656
You do not know anything about it, right?

422
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:31,792
Ha!

423
00:23:31,794 --> 00:23:32,959
Good.

424
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:41,233
Hello, Caitlin.

425
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:44,803
Welcome.
Thank you so much for inviting us.

426
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:47,272
I hate to intrude on
Henry's birthday party.

427
00:23:47,274 --> 00:23:49,707
Oh, do not be crazy. Hey, Ricky, how are you?
- I'm fine thanks.

428
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:53,043
I hope it's okay that I'm here.
- Of course it is.

429
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:54,844
Who is this lovely lady
and handsome man?

430
00:23:54,846 --> 00:23:56,178
<i>Oh, Bob.</i>

431
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:01,081
How you doing, buddy?

432
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,283
I'm fine, Pastor, thank you.

433
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:04,817
I do not know whether it is permissible

434
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:05,884
But I brought some wine.

435
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:07,352
Pst. We will not tell anyone.

436
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:09,721
Well, I'm not sure
we serve it

437
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:12,857
- Thank you passed.
Maybe I can smuggle it.

438
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:14,992
- Okay, sure.
- There are 4 bottles.

439
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:16,760
Really 4. In one box?

440
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:18,661
Unbelievable. Come in.

441
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,806
Hi, Mom.
Hello girls, how are you?

442
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:39,776
I bathe. - She's thirsty.
- <i> Oh, just because you do not want to bathe</i>

443
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,378
<i>does not mean that I'm pretty.</i>

444
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:10,938
Hi, Ricky, how are you?

445
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:13,840
I'm fine.

446
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:22,313
<i>Is it true that the
tried to kill himself?</i>

447
00:25:22,315 --> 00:25:24,948
<i>Not sure what happened.</i>

448
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,580
Hello.

449
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:01,181
I'm Cheyenne.

450
00:26:02,283 --> 00:26:03,983
Let the celebration begin, right?

451
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:06,852
Roz, my dear, just wonderful.
-Hello Darling.

452
00:26:06,854 --> 00:26:08,520
I'm glad to see you.

453
00:26:08,522 --> 00:26:09,888
Oh, hi honey.

454
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:12,056
Oh, Grace, sit down.

455
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:15,826
Rozi, you look wonderful, soap
It's good to see you.

456
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:17,160
Guess who's pregnant?

457
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:22,363
Oh, the glory of God, that's wonderful!

458
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:24,298
Oh, we'll have something to look forward to.

459
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,400
<i>You know, I do not.</i>
<i>- We will rejoice.</i>

460
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:15,412
Oh!

461
00:27:18,215 --> 00:27:19,882
<i>Yeah you're right, Logan?</i>
<i>You okay?</i>

462
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:21,550
Yes, I'm fine.

463
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:23,618
I'm sorry, Logan.

464
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,086
It's okay.

465
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:28,555
Did he hit his head?

466
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:43,168
Oh, I put the "medicine"
under the sink,

467
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,269
You know.

468
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:47,105
Thank you, dear.

469
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:52,576
Oh, HB has always enjoyed

470
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:54,945
Spending time with young people.

471
00:27:54,947 --> 00:27:56,546
Course.

472
00:27:57,414 --> 00:28:01,383
Young people who like gentlemen,
he would certainly appreciate it.

473
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:03,284
Yes, ma'am.

474
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:09,388
I miss him, Bob.

475
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,089
Really.

476
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,225
I know.

477
00:28:14,227 --> 00:28:15,960
I menu.

478
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,362
<i>I'm sorry to interrupt.</i>
I want to serve itself.

479
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,163
Yes, that's best.

480
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:23,331
You know, HB and is much appreciated.

481
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,199
He appreciated your help.

482
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,968
He was a wonderful man.

483
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:33,072
I had some spices here

484
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:35,107
I do not know where I put them?

485
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:37,008
Cute girl.

486
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:39,943
Oh, I frowned.

487
00:28:40,277 --> 00:28:42,177
Where is my Riki?

488
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,411
Oh, there he is.

489
00:28:46,181 --> 00:28:47,648
How is he, Rosie?

490
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:52,051
Oh, you know,
has good days and bad days.

491
00:28:53,253 --> 00:28:55,621
Thank God for these children, though.

492
00:28:55,623 --> 00:28:59,091
He just celebrated its
days of this youthful activities.

493
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:06,664
Hello. -Hello.
How's your head. He seemed very...

494
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:08,165
Pretty bad.

495
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:09,466
Good.

496
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:19,975
Hello, autumn.
Hello, Grace.

497
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:23,311
I'm sorry, I must have missed this earlier.
- It's fine.

498
00:29:23,313 --> 00:29:25,980
I did not mean to interrupt
reading.

499
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:28,448
Oh, no, it's just a stupid magazine.

500
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:32,751
Kupaćeš be?

501
00:29:32,753 --> 00:29:35,487
I do not know.

502
00:29:35,489 --> 00:29:37,322
I'm thinking about it.

503
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:39,257
Yes, I do.

504
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:40,458
You should.

505
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,259
It's a nice day for it.

506
00:29:42,261 --> 00:29:43,760
Mama hates swimming.

507
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:46,295
I'm not much of a swimmer, really.

508
00:29:46,297 --> 00:29:48,397
<i>No, I think</i>
<i>she hates swimming.</i>

509
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,698
<i>Sam thought of him.</i>

510
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,166
Why?

511
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:52,734
I do not know.

512
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:55,502
All these bodies think it bothered her.

513
00:30:01,074 --> 00:30:04,376
It is obvious that Lucy and Stefan
doing what. Severe.

514
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:05,343
No idea.

515
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:09,380
Yes, but when it works gently...
These are just ogovranja in the hallways, but...

516
00:30:09,382 --> 00:30:11,348
Whatever.

517
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,716
Have you heard of Kevin and Jamal?

518
00:30:12,718 --> 00:30:13,750
What about them?

519
00:30:13,752 --> 00:30:14,617
Kevin Reynolds?
-Yes.

520
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:18,220
Apparently they had sex
on a trip with a group.

521
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:19,588
Stop, they're gay?

522
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,689
Yes.

523
00:30:20,691 --> 00:30:23,191
Tyler Collins came out of the hall

524
00:30:23,193 --> 00:30:26,460
I saw them in the hotel room to
doing what.

525
00:30:26,462 --> 00:30:27,627
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

526
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:28,628
<i>Yes.</i>

527
00:30:31,132 --> 00:30:32,431
Strange.

528
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:34,799
Strange?

529
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:36,167
I'm gay.

530
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:40,403
Wait, what?

531
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,138
Seriously?

532
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,472
How do you know?

533
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,274
I do not know these things!

534
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:49,076
Wait, you have a problem with that?

535
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:50,677
<i>Of course not.</i>

536
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:52,745
Wait, what does that mean?

537
00:30:58,818 --> 00:31:00,618
<i>Logan, are you okay?</i>

538
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,219
Yes.

539
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:06,389
New meat, you idiot.

540
00:31:12,528 --> 00:31:14,662
Hey, how's your head?

541
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,231
It's not so bad.

542
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:18,398
I'm fine.

543
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,299
Please stop asking.

544
00:31:20,301 --> 00:31:22,334
Sorry, mate.

545
00:31:22,336 --> 00:31:24,736
Hey, do you
Wednesday to apply for jobs,

546
00:31:24,738 --> 00:31:26,070
Sure your family know about this?

547
00:31:26,072 --> 00:31:27,071
Yes, I know.

548
00:31:27,073 --> 00:31:28,172
Are you going to go this year?

549
00:31:28,174 --> 00:31:29,339
I do not know.

550
00:31:29,341 --> 00:31:30,573
We'd like to come with us.

551
00:31:30,575 --> 00:31:32,374
It will be better than last year.

552
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:33,608
Who goes there?

553
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,643
Almost everyone here, I think.

554
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:38,712
Gabe goes,
Emily is going, going, John,

555
00:31:38,714 --> 00:31:40,814
<i>trying to convince</i>
<i>Cup to go.</i>

556
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,649
Nice.

557
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,618
Also interested to know whether you're interested

558
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,686
To go to Sunday school sometimes.

559
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:49,721
<i>We hope to start</i>
<i>the whole youth group,</i>

560
00:31:49,723 --> 00:31:51,089
<i>we all do.</i>

561
00:31:51,091 --> 00:31:52,390
Oh, I do not know.

562
00:31:52,392 --> 00:31:53,858
You can choose any topic.

563
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,826
In addition to homosexuality,
I took it.

564
00:31:55,828 --> 00:31:57,494
And I have vanity.

565
00:31:57,496 --> 00:31:59,128
Yes, you do.

566
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:49,503
So how do you like Columbia Christianity?

567
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:53,173
I still try to find out
, but I like it. - Yes.

568
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:57,410
My cousin was there and he loves it.

569
00:32:57,412 --> 00:32:58,744
You teach physics and biology, is not it?

570
00:32:58,746 --> 00:32:59,911
Yes.

571
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,446
So, how exactly does it work?

572
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:05,682
- What do you mean?
- <i> Biology at the Christian school.</i>

573
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:08,351
Do teach evolution... or...?

574
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:12,389
Well... Can you teach biology without evolution
.

575
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,724
Yes, you can teach math without numbers.

576
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,460
Yes, it's called logic.

577
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,361
My cousin took it.

578
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:24,265
So how exactly this
teach that life begins?

579
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:27,867
I think you they're--

580
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:31,670
Bypass around things?

581
00:33:31,672 --> 00:33:34,472
Yes, it's a little strange, but

582
00:33:34,474 --> 00:33:38,342
Yes to focus on...
No, this is not surprising.

583
00:33:38,344 --> 00:33:40,911
This school is wonderful, do not listen to them.

584
00:33:40,913 --> 00:33:44,781
I think I am capable of
to think for themselves, you know?

585
00:33:44,783 --> 00:33:46,315
Yes, well.

586
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:47,482
Do it.

587
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,317
Hi, folks.

588
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:49,984
<i>Yes, join us.</i>

589
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,852
Yes.
Hello, Riki.

590
00:33:51,854 --> 00:33:56,289
Hi, Happy birthday.
I could talk to you, you were in the pool.

591
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,056
Oh, thank you.

592
00:33:57,058 --> 00:33:59,825
Hello Cup.
<i>Rikster, how are you?</i>

593
00:33:59,827 --> 00:34:01,927
Are you ready for a camping
in a few weeks?

594
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:04,462
<i>Yeah, we</i>
<i>talking about this.</i>

595
00:34:04,464 --> 00:34:05,463
We are trying to convince the Cup to go.

596
00:34:05,465 --> 00:34:06,464
Yes, you should go.

597
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:07,665
<i>It'll be great.</i>

598
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:11,568
<i>Totally.</i>
I do not know, I'm not the type of camp.

599
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,036
You go, Riki?

600
00:34:13,038 --> 00:34:15,071
If you Kate goes with me.

601
00:34:15,073 --> 00:34:16,872
Yes we're still trying to come up

602
00:34:16,874 --> 00:34:18,573
Situation with another person.

603
00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:20,374
<i>Usually we</i>
<i>a lot of fun, though.</i>

604
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:26,413
It's mine.

605
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:27,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

606
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:31,750
<i>And all these women</i>

607
00:34:32,052 --> 00:34:33,818
Practically kidnapped

608
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,319
Streets

609
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:37,821
Girls kidnapped from their beds -

610
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:41,057
And then sold to be sex slaves

611
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:44,460
And it is happening right here in America.

612
00:34:44,462 --> 00:34:46,995
<i>There is a wonderful organization</i>

613
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:48,730
Called <i> In his hands</i>

614
00:34:48,732 --> 00:34:50,431
So I think

615
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:52,533
To Kraljevo town needs to be attached

616
00:34:52,535 --> 00:34:54,768
<i>I know Larry wants</i>
<i>to talk to Bob about that</i>

617
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:59,372
<i>because I think it's a crisis.</i>

618
00:34:59,374 --> 00:35:04,877
A few people talk about the global crisis.

619
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:06,612
Who would have said.

620
00:35:06,614 --> 00:35:08,981
And then there's the porn.

621
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:12,617
I saw a show the other night

622
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:15,419
The entertainment industry for adults

623
00:35:15,421 --> 00:35:21,891
But these girls and boys are
18, 19, 20 years

624
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:25,494
Are not much older than the children there,

625
00:35:26,062 --> 00:35:29,731
And they get up every morning
i go to work,

626
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:33,135
And have sex with older men,

627
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:35,736
<i>every day</i>
<i>daily</i>

628
00:35:35,738 --> 00:35:40,139
<i>on najponižajuci,</i>
<i>terrible, unimaginable way...</i>

629
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:43,942
No ketchup. - I'll get it, honey.
- <i> No, I'll do it.</i>

630
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:44,943
Are you sure?

631
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:46,644
Yes.

632
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,482
I do not know, sometimes

633
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:59,455
I look at our sexual
US state

634
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,557
I know that God is coming.

635
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,094
<i>I do not know anything</i>
<i>o tom, Boni.</i>

636
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:10,598
I think that for some of these woman

637
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,100
<i>the more economic need</i>
<i>than sex.</i>

638
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:15,935
I have not followed.

639
00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:18,070
I think for some social problem

640
00:36:18,072 --> 00:36:20,472
Have to see where it arises and

641
00:36:20,474 --> 00:36:27,544
<i>it seems to me that these women</i>
<i>end up in prostitution,</i>

642
00:36:27,546 --> 00:36:29,946
For something else,

643
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:32,682
Be they economic difficulties

644
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:35,918
Or lack of opportunities for education.

645
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,121
Or inadequate sex education.

646
00:36:41,691 --> 00:36:44,025
Do not be a democrat with us.

647
00:36:47,996 --> 00:36:50,464
Barbara is printed
those programs for tomorrow?

648
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:52,466
Yes, I saw them at the office

649
00:36:52,468 --> 00:36:53,800
When I was there before.

650
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:55,168
Good.

651
00:36:57,437 --> 00:36:59,171
When an event opens tomorrow, yeah?

652
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:02,174
If you do not mind.
No, not at all.

653
00:37:06,078 --> 00:37:07,945
I look forward to

654
00:37:07,947 --> 00:37:12,014
First Korinćanskoj series this fall.

655
00:37:12,016 --> 00:37:13,749
You get sick from the Old Testament?

656
00:37:13,751 --> 00:37:15,717
No, he did not say that.

657
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,585
I can not wait the New Testament.

658
00:37:17,587 --> 00:37:19,720
I heard this.

659
00:37:19,722 --> 00:37:21,121
Oh no,
they're doing a great job.

660
00:37:21,123 --> 00:37:23,123
I love this series.
Well, thanks.

661
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:25,959
I always feel that I could better prepare
, but-

662
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:30,563
No, you're doing great, as always.

663
00:37:30,565 --> 00:37:32,698
Do you know who would be proud of you?

664
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,699
Mr. HB.

665
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:38,001
Well, thank you.

666
00:37:39,703 --> 00:37:43,772
I know it's been difficult
lose such a mentor.

667
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:46,074
Yes. Thank you.

668
00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:47,608
You do not have to talk about this.

669
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,042
No no no, it's okay.

670
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:53,479
Taj cancer, it's a terrible thing,
I'll tell you about that.

671
00:37:55,215 --> 00:37:56,515
Yes.

672
00:37:57,717 --> 00:37:59,117
And he was a young man.

673
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,486
I think relatively.

674
00:38:01,753 --> 00:38:03,653
-Looking,

675
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:04,987
Good health.

676
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:07,155
He could not see that coming.

677
00:38:07,157 --> 00:38:09,090
-I Do not know.
No, you never know.

678
00:38:14,595 --> 00:38:20,699
Okay, here we are.
I ought to change the channel.

679
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:21,933
Hey, Coop.

680
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:26,703
I'm trying to change the channel, this is dirty.

681
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:29,572
I think the receiver.
Think the battery.

682
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:34,243
Here it is. We managed.

683
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,714
You need to get rid of these movie channels.
I do not know why they still have.

684
00:38:41,183 --> 00:38:44,084
You know, I do not know how to
she works, but

685
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:48,087
Ket every day
looking better.

686
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:49,855
I would not have thought it possible

687
00:38:49,857 --> 00:38:51,723
Because it certainly will not happen
Boni.

688
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:55,693
Not yet, anyway.
-Yes good.

689
00:38:55,695 --> 00:38:58,127
Thank you.
She's a wonderful person, of course.

690
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,697
Excellent.

691
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:09,636
I do not know where the basket smeće-

692
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,638
Under the sink.

693
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,805
Oh.

694
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:16,308
Hey Bob!

695
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,810
-Please.
What's under the sink?

696
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:24,647
Oh, no no no, it's...
Rozi brought to.

697
00:39:24,649 --> 00:39:26,615
She does not know that we do not drink.

698
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:28,016
Oh, well.

699
00:39:29,818 --> 00:39:31,118
Why would you?

700
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,220
Oh, you know, such an opportunity.

701
00:39:33,222 --> 00:39:34,787
Ah.

702
00:39:37,557 --> 00:39:39,724
You know, Jesus drank.

703
00:39:52,168 --> 00:39:54,135
Well, I guess I can not.

704
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:55,569
I already began to feel it.

705
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:58,938
Oh, I'll take and I can see how it is.

706
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:05,109
Oh, shit,
need to present the cake.

707
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,912
Do you think it's okay to
take it with me out?

708
00:40:08,914 --> 00:40:12,282
I think I will if it's uncomfortable.

709
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,017
No no no, it's fine, of course.

710
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:15,785
Good.
Nice.

711
00:41:18,313 --> 00:41:19,646
Do you like him?

712
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:23,015
Yes.

713
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,933
This is perfect.

714
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:45,401
Thank you very much.

715
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,941
You are officially hipster.

716
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,043
And now this.

717
00:41:59,982 --> 00:42:01,482
Wait, this is-

718
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:04,084
The first movie we watched together.

719
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:05,552
Thank you very much.

720
00:42:07,388 --> 00:42:08,521
You're the best.

722
00:42:09,524 --> 00:42:11,123
This is a book.

727
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:27,569
You're the best.

728
00:42:29,071 --> 00:42:30,271
<i>Oh, that's me.</i>

729
00:42:30,273 --> 00:42:31,404
Oh, wonderful.

730
00:42:34,307 --> 00:42:37,042
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

731
00:42:37,044 --> 00:42:38,810
<i>This is really nice.</i>

732
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:41,312
My mother had found a

733
00:42:41,314 --> 00:42:44,315
It's beautiful, thank you, great.

734

00:42:46,384 --> 00:42:48,284
<i>Oh, come on, embraced him.</i>

00:42:53,355 --> 00:42:55,254
You're welcome.
-Thank you.

739
00:42:58,891 --> 00:43:00,258
<i>Uh, well, what's next?</i>

740
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,492
<i>Can you open my.</i>

741
00:43:01,494 --> 00:43:05,596
- <i> You'll love.</i>
- <i> No, you know what, I'll leave that for later.</i>

742
00:43:22,244 --> 00:43:23,444
What is going on back here?

743
00:43:23,446 --> 00:43:27,614
Oh, we have a little medicine.

744
00:44:07,452 --> 00:44:09,152
Oh!

745
00:44:09,154 --> 00:44:11,287
I'm sorry... Aaron.
-Gđo Gamble.

746
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:13,555
God, you surprise me.
-Sorry.

747
00:44:13,557 --> 00:44:15,256
The door was open,
I do not mind.

748
00:44:15,258 --> 00:44:17,291
No, do not bother.

749
00:44:17,293 --> 00:44:20,393
Autumn is back, it will be...
surprised when he sees you.

750
00:44:21,628 --> 00:44:23,161
Back to the pool!

751
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,362
Do you want to turn on music?

752
00:44:25,364 --> 00:44:27,530
Yes, you can put the mix B, please?

753
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:29,665
<i>Sure.</i>
<i>Yeah you're right, Dad?</i>

754
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,434
Larry, what's in the cup?

755
00:44:48,648 --> 00:44:50,582
Oh, hello, Aron.

756
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:01,292
What are you doing here?
-What do you mean?

757
00:45:01,294 --> 00:45:03,527
You are not invited.
You're not Henry else

758
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:05,395
You are not my friend, what are you doing here?

759
00:45:05,397 --> 00:45:07,230
I just came to say hello.

760
00:45:07,232 --> 00:45:09,232
Since we are not friends?

761
00:45:17,174 --> 00:45:18,640
Autumn, autumn
what hell are you doing?

762
00:45:18,642 --> 00:45:19,707
Get away from me!
-OK OK!

763
00:45:19,709 --> 00:45:20,607
Help!
Okay, go!

764
00:45:20,609 --> 00:45:23,076
What is it?
You're gonna hit me!

765
00:45:23,078 --> 00:45:25,511
Stop getting in my house!

766
00:45:25,513 --> 00:45:27,145
I'm in your house?

767
00:45:27,147 --> 00:45:28,546
Good.

768
00:45:28,548 --> 00:45:33,083
Can we look at
our actions.

769
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:34,150
Just as I remember. Because I...

770
00:45:34,152 --> 00:45:36,719
Before you went to school
I am sure that everything was fine

771
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:38,153
That everything was fine.

772
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:40,989
And then we say that we will not be together
, we're just friends.

773
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,726
But... I mean,
do you do not remember that?

774
00:45:44,728 --> 00:45:47,328
You sent me sms.
We had lunch together.

775
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,462
You sent me sms three weeks ago.

776
00:45:48,464 --> 00:45:49,629
You'll be home.

777
00:45:49,631 --> 00:45:52,098
I thought so.

778
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,999
Well, what were you thinking?

779
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,033
What is wrong with you?

780
00:45:55,035 --> 00:45:57,468
-Men's Nothing wrong with you, Aaron!
Ouch! Jesus!

781
00:46:00,238 --> 00:46:02,239
What's this?
I do not understand.

782
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:04,007
Think, Aron.

783
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:08,142
You took something from me.

784
00:46:10,712 --> 00:46:12,646
What, seriously?
It is because of this?

785
00:46:14,348 --> 00:46:18,750
You... you made me feel...

786
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:22,286
What did I do?

787
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:30,293
I thought was nice.
It was not nice, it was...

788
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:31,661
What? What is it?!

789
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:37,199
It's... it's... it was
nice... it was terrible...

790
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:40,335
The way you printed

791
00:46:41,603 --> 00:46:43,170
What kind of way, the autumn?

792
00:46:43,172 --> 00:46:45,338
We both do,
it was our decision.

793
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,772
Am I wrong?

794
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:48,006
Do not uzajedno decide?

795
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:49,107
Stop!
Stop, please.

796
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:50,241
Please, stop!

797
00:46:50,243 --> 00:46:52,343
Hey, come ovamo-
Get away from me!

798
00:46:52,345 --> 00:46:55,446
I want to get back to
brother's birthday party.

799
00:46:55,448 --> 00:46:57,281
Stop talking to me.

800
00:46:57,283 --> 00:46:58,715
What are we doing?

801
00:46:58,717 --> 00:47:00,316
I have no idea!

802
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:03,284
HOW HAS MODELLING ?!

803
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,253
What ?!

804
00:48:23,092 --> 00:48:23,825
Hello.

805
00:48:23,827 --> 00:48:26,093
Hello.

806
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:10,702
Do you like this?

807
00:49:10,704 --> 00:49:12,403
Yes.

808
00:49:16,407 --> 00:49:18,574
Henri,

809
00:49:18,576 --> 00:49:21,710
I just wanted you to know that...

810
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:28,416
I'm totally willing to
... fun with you.

811
00:49:28,418 --> 00:49:31,752
If you're serious.

812
00:49:31,754 --> 00:49:34,921
You look really liked

813
00:49:34,923 --> 00:49:38,190
Since we were partners in prayer.

814
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,496
Can I...
to come back to you?

815
00:50:18,828 --> 00:50:20,728
Honey,

816
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,529
Where you been?

817
00:50:22,531 --> 00:50:24,597
I ran down the street for no reason,

818
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:28,634
He chased me and now I'm back.

819
00:50:33,272 --> 00:50:34,472
Hey.

820
00:50:36,274 --> 00:50:38,942
It's okay...

821
00:50:38,944 --> 00:50:40,510
... Hey.

822
00:50:43,814 --> 00:50:45,614
You want some wine?

823
00:50:52,587 --> 00:50:53,853
Hi, Bob.

824
00:50:54,821 --> 00:50:55,687
Hi, Ricky.

825
00:50:55,689 --> 00:50:56,988
How are you?

826
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:00,658
I'm fine, I'm fine.

827
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,993
Hey, Kate told me that you're not sure

828
00:51:02,995 --> 00:51:05,362
The situation
companion in the camp.

829
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:14,302
So I did not know whether...
I mean, if something...

830
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:17,506
You know, you should sit down next week

831
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:19,707
I talk about this
what might be best.

832
00:51:22,945 --> 00:51:24,077
OK?

833
00:51:24,745 --> 00:51:25,945
OK.

834
00:51:33,087 --> 00:51:35,620
I think we're all excited and Ricky.

835
00:51:35,622 --> 00:51:37,788
What does it mean?

836
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,090
I'm not sure it's good for him

837
00:51:40,092 --> 00:51:41,691
To go with a companion in the camp.

838
00:51:41,693 --> 00:51:43,926
Oh, why, for what inidenta?

839
00:51:43,928 --> 00:51:46,828
To be sure, I'm not sure
it was suicide

840
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,597
I think the guy liked pills.

841
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,699
I do not know.

842
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:54,535
A was the incident in
camp last summer.

843
00:51:54,537 --> 00:51:56,136
What happened in
camp last summer?

844
00:51:57,371 --> 00:51:58,537
I thought you-

845
00:51:58,539 --> 00:52:00,138
What are we talking about here?

846
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,807
I think maybe now is not the time.

847
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:06,643
No no no no, come on.
What happened?

848
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:09,846
I think that was the situation in the showers.

849
00:52:09,848 --> 00:52:12,114
What situation?

850
00:52:12,116 --> 00:52:16,751
Well, according to a couple of our boys, Ricky...

851
00:52:16,753 --> 00:52:18,519
On the shower with several boys

852
00:52:18,521 --> 00:52:19,620
A
they thought that he looks...

853
00:52:19,622 --> 00:52:20,787
He might have been challenged.

854
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:25,157
Oh my God.
Yes, but...

855
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,727
Man,

856
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,629
Certainly a lot of stories.

857
00:53:05,628 --> 00:53:08,529
<i>The plane flying</i>
<i>and I was sick .-</i>

858
00:53:08,531 --> 00:53:13,100
<i>Well, when you're in a plane</i>
<i>six and a half hours.</i>

859
00:53:13,102 --> 00:53:16,202
Oh, my God, I cry.

860
00:53:17,604 --> 00:53:18,737
Why?

861
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:21,473
I do not know... Mom...?

862
00:53:21,475 --> 00:53:25,677
I'm... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

863
00:53:32,951 --> 00:53:37,220
You know, the problem with growing up

864
00:53:37,222 --> 00:53:40,156
<i>This is what has...</i>

865
00:53:40,158 --> 00:53:43,792
Never grow up.

866
00:53:43,794 --> 00:53:49,063
You think you're an adult, your body
peaked,

867
00:53:49,065 --> 00:53:54,801
But you still... grow up.

868
00:53:55,235 --> 00:53:57,102
<i>You really never ready.</i>

869
00:53:58,804 --> 00:54:00,771
<i>You never actually... you're on your way.</i>

870
00:54:01,973 --> 00:54:04,741
Why is this a problem?

871
00:54:04,743 --> 00:54:07,009
Because you have kids.

872
00:54:13,582 --> 00:54:18,752
In the fall, I want you to... izvinim-

873
00:54:18,754 --> 00:54:22,688
No, Mom.
No, I will not. I will.

874
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:24,189
<i>Look at me.</i>

875
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:30,561
I want to apologize

876
00:54:30,563 --> 00:54:32,796
If I ever made
to be ashamed of their bodies.

877
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:34,230
What? What do you mean?

878
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:37,666
You did not.
No, no, I did.

879
00:54:39,635 --> 00:54:41,135
I'm sorry.

880
00:54:49,644 --> 00:54:51,111
Tell me that's fine.

881
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,917
It's okay.

882
00:55:07,994 --> 00:55:11,662
Listen, autumn
I want to be honest with you.

883
00:55:13,765 --> 00:55:17,100
<i>Something happened to me</i>
<i>in the recent past.</i>

884
00:55:17,102 --> 00:55:20,136
<i>Or, some time ago.</i>

885
00:55:20,138 --> 00:55:22,538
In fact, it was the series...

886
00:55:27,543 --> 00:55:30,177
Something happened to me and...

887
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:33,879
I'm not sure what will happen to me.

888
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,116
-Bob?
<i>One second!</i>

889
00:55:41,686 --> 00:55:42,852
Riki said.

890
00:55:42,854 --> 00:55:44,887
Can I talk to you for a minute?

891
00:55:44,889 --> 00:55:47,155
<i>Yes, I'm coming right away,</i>

892
00:55:47,157 --> 00:55:49,056
<i>Just to porbinem</i>
<i>for something I forgot.</i>

893
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:03,068
I need you to tell me
the next time you do it.

894
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:05,336
That's fine
No, that's not right.

895
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:07,104
They're a bunch of jerks.

896
00:56:07,106 --> 00:56:10,040
- Yes, I do.
- I know.

897
00:56:10,042 --> 00:56:14,144
Can not you go through
B wing to the library?

898
00:56:14,146 --> 00:56:16,212
Maybe you should try it.

899
00:56:16,214 --> 00:56:18,714
Yes, I think maybe.

900
00:56:18,716 --> 00:56:20,849
After all, it's the end of the school year.

901
00:56:20,851 --> 00:56:22,049
I think you can.

902
00:56:24,352 --> 00:56:25,685
Hey.

903
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,187
It will be better.

904
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:34,858
Well, no, seriously!
He will.

905
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:38,094
I really think it will be better for us.

906
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:46,834
Hey Grace, have you seen Ricky?
He was looking for me?

907
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:48,168
No, sorry.

908
00:56:51,905 --> 00:56:54,673
<i>Do you remember when you</i>

909
00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:57,809
Do you remember when I went
i was with Mr. Matthew

910
00:56:57,811 --> 00:57:00,144
When Rosie had some obligations?

911
00:57:00,146 --> 00:57:02,246
Riki was still working in the best shopping,

912
00:57:02,248 --> 00:57:04,948
And she needed help.

913
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:08,117
Yes, I think I remember.

914
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:11,954
<i>That was before the</i>
<i>He went to the hospital</i>

915
00:57:11,956 --> 00:57:14,056
<i>on the last cycle</i>
<i>treatment</i>

916
00:57:14,058 --> 00:57:15,791
<i>before you went to school.</i>

917
00:57:15,793 --> 00:57:17,759
Oh, well, yes.

918
00:57:17,761 --> 00:57:24,365
He was very ill,
but not so sick

919
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:29,636
You can not enjoy...
in the time he had left.

920
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:32,237
Yes.

921
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:36,373
<i>At that time, your father</i>

922
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:38,842
<i>spend more time with him</i>
<i>than I do.</i>

923
00:57:38,844 --> 00:57:45,681
But the road with him...
we are very well socialized.

924
00:57:45,683 --> 00:57:50,651
<i>He was... a real pleasure.</i>

925
00:57:53,421 --> 00:57:58,724
However, at one point, a couple of weeks,

926
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:02,194
<i>-Mr Matthew -</i>
<i>Can you call him BB.</i>

927
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,333
No, I can not.

928
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:19,040
<i>One day he looked at me</i>
<i>grinning and said,</i>

929
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:25,312
"God, you you could be a movie star."

930
00:58:29,016 --> 00:58:31,917
You know, he was a very handsome man

931
00:58:31,919 --> 00:58:34,085
<i>even at the end.</i>

932
00:58:34,087 --> 00:58:35,419
He was.

933
00:58:35,421 --> 00:58:37,788
I think I'm flattered,

934
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:41,458
You know, I was careless.

935
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:45,227
Then, he continued to speak,
"God, it's true...".

936
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:53,199
And in that moment he began to
looking at me...

937
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:59,171
He started looking at me as if I
worth of attention.

938
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:05,709
<i>The first nothing happened.</i>

939
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:10,947
<i>But then you eat.</i>

940
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:15,217
<i>A couple of times.</i>

941
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:18,220
Wait.

942
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:19,421
Do you think...?

943
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:25,027
Oh, sorry.
No, it's okay.

944
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:28,430
<i>No, it's not right,</i>
<i>I did not.</i>

945
00:59:45,313 --> 00:59:47,213
Does Dad know?

946
00:59:48,582 --> 00:59:50,348
Yes.

947
00:59:52,417 --> 00:59:54,317
How did that go?

948
00:59:56,586 --> 00:59:58,053
It's not good.

949
00:59:59,889 --> 01:00:02,223
But he's good, I think.

950
01:00:03,592 --> 01:00:05,192
I think.

951
01:00:05,194 --> 01:00:07,227
I do not know, autumn.

952
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:10,897
What about Rosie?

953
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:12,531
She does not know.
I will never know.

954
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:19,103
That's probably for the best.
-Yes.

955
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:28,110
Do you still love daddy?

956
01:01:17,157 --> 01:01:19,691
<i>I do not think he's gay,</i>
<i>I mean, he's just confused.</i>

957
01:01:19,693 --> 01:01:22,527
Delio's bed with him in the camp
last year, nothing happened.

958
01:01:22,529 --> 01:01:26,330
Well, you've shared a bed with Logan
and nothing happened

959
01:01:26,332 --> 01:01:27,931
But it does not change anything.

960
01:01:27,933 --> 01:01:30,133
Comrade, Logan is not gay.

961
01:01:31,302 --> 01:01:32,301
-Kuper.
What?

962
01:01:32,303 --> 01:01:37,272
I'm not saying that's a bad thing,
I'm just saying that this is obvious.

963
01:01:37,274 --> 01:01:39,974
It's not a good thing,
it is safe.

964
01:01:39,976 --> 01:01:42,009
So, what do you think?

965
01:01:42,011 --> 01:01:44,311
Well,

966
01:01:44,313 --> 01:01:47,147
I think that Christ teaches us to love everyone,

967
01:01:47,149 --> 01:01:50,216
Whether zavisinici,
criminals or gays.

968
01:01:50,218 --> 01:01:51,217
Hate the sin, love the sinner.

969
01:01:51,219 --> 01:01:52,518
Well, yes.

970
01:01:54,087 --> 01:01:55,220
That surprises me.

971
01:01:55,222 --> 01:01:57,121
Why?

972
01:01:57,123 --> 01:01:59,223
I do not know.
I think I...

973
01:01:59,225 --> 01:02:01,425
I think that's all people
immediately realized.

974
01:02:04,695 --> 01:02:07,129
You think because I'm married?

975
01:02:08,698 --> 01:02:11,132
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>It's not at all the same.</i>

976
01:02:11,134 --> 01:02:13,134
People do not choose your race

977
01:02:13,136 --> 01:02:16,003
The way you choose to be gay.

978
01:02:18,706 --> 01:02:19,639
Hello.
-Hi Dad.

979
01:02:19,641 --> 01:02:21,240
Where have you been?

980
01:02:21,242 --> 01:02:22,608
Oh, we're just talking.

981
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:24,176
Have you seen Ricky?

982
01:02:24,178 --> 01:02:25,577
Yes.

983
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:28,046
You could be a little
with your brother, you know!

984
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:30,214
<i>I</i>
<i>I'll be back!</i>

985
01:02:31,182 --> 01:02:33,216
It will be right back.

986
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:36,719
How are you?
-Okay.

987
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:39,188
You?
-I'm fine.

988
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:07,277
<i>After</i>

989
01:03:07,279 --> 01:03:12,281
If you... yeah, I do not know...

990
01:03:12,283 --> 01:03:17,085
If you want to go back, anyway,

991
01:03:17,087 --> 01:03:20,688
Promise not to run away and scream.

992
01:04:42,266 --> 01:04:43,366
Can you save me?

993
01:04:43,368 --> 01:04:44,767
I can save you.

994
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:47,870
If you choked you, I would like,
I believe, I believe the...

995
01:04:47,872 --> 01:04:50,272
Me, I
need resuscitation.

996
01:04:51,807 --> 01:04:53,374
Thank you.
-You're welcome.

997
01:04:53,376 --> 01:04:56,310
You're a great savior.
I did, always. It does not matter what.

998
01:04:57,512 --> 01:04:59,346
Hey, Kate, can we talk for a moment
?

999
01:05:00,614 --> 01:05:02,581
Well, I'll try to survive without you.

1000
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:04,382
Okay, thanks a lot, try to...

1001
01:05:06,418 --> 01:05:07,885
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
forgive me, gentlemen,

1002
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:09,886
Forgive me, Lord,
forgive me, gentlemen...

1003
01:05:12,389 --> 01:05:13,689
Stop.

1004
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:20,127
I think that this is a much
things happening, you know,

1005
01:05:20,129 --> 01:05:21,394
Bad influence

1006
01:05:21,396 --> 01:05:24,196
Sexual confusion.

1007
01:05:27,266 --> 01:05:31,435
Well, comrade, the best we can
is to follow Christ's example.

1008
01:05:31,437 --> 01:05:33,303
That's it.

1009
01:05:33,305 --> 01:05:36,439
I do not know, it seems to me
this is very urgent.

1010
01:05:36,441 --> 01:05:38,774
It seems to me as if...

1011
01:05:38,776 --> 01:05:41,543
It seems to me that we are losing a whole generation.

1012
01:06:29,884 --> 01:06:33,253
Oh, well, that's what I'm talking about!

1013
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:34,554
What were you doing, honey?

1014
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:36,355
Watching TV.

1015
01:06:36,357 --> 01:06:38,457
I do not know why.

1016
01:06:38,459 --> 01:06:39,691
This is a beautiful night.

1017
01:06:39,693 --> 01:06:42,759
Do you want to leave her alone!
<i>Do whatever you want, Grace!</i>

1018
01:06:44,461 --> 01:06:46,328
<i>Thank you, Dad.</i>

1019
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:47,429
What is it?

1020
01:06:49,231 --> 01:06:50,698
Well, I'm a little!

1021
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,266
Well, I'm going to bring you, Miss Rosie.

1022
01:06:56,203 --> 01:06:58,737
Do you all drink alcohol?

1023
01:07:00,473 --> 01:07:02,507
Where is Aron went?

1024
01:07:02,509 --> 01:07:04,208
I do not know.

1025
01:07:06,945 --> 01:07:09,212
Do you know that I love you?

1026
01:07:11,348 --> 01:07:12,581
Of course I do.

1027
01:07:20,455 --> 01:07:22,556
Oh, thank you, dear.

1028
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,893
Do you want some?

1029
01:07:31,363 --> 01:07:32,696
No, thank you.

1030
01:08:09,562 --> 01:08:11,563
Kathleen

1031
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:15,466
I'm not sure for some of these
Henrijevih comrades.

1032
01:08:15,468 --> 01:08:16,967
What?

1033
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:18,668
For those there.

1034
01:08:19,336 --> 01:08:21,437
Oh, Heather, and Kristina?

1035
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,539
<i>They are very good</i>
<i>Henry's girlfriend.</i>

1036
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:24,840
<i>They are beautiful girls.</i>

1037
01:08:26,943 --> 01:08:31,479
A Logan that he is safe
poor, right?

1038
01:08:33,415 --> 01:08:36,784
You know what, I think it's time
to change the channel, Bob?

1039
01:08:36,786 --> 01:08:38,819
Let's move on to the next level?

1040
01:08:38,821 --> 01:08:40,554
I'm not sure what that means, but-

1041
01:08:40,556 --> 01:08:41,922
In fact, I'll do it.

1042
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:43,890
Hen!

1043
01:08:43,892 --> 01:08:44,557
What ?!

1044
01:08:44,559 --> 01:08:45,925
Our Miks?

1045
01:08:45,927 --> 01:08:47,359
Do it!

1046
01:09:13,086 --> 01:09:14,618
Does anybody want to take a swim?

1047
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,685
I will.

1048
01:09:15,687 --> 01:09:17,586
<i>Grace...</i>

1049
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:18,954
Come on, Grace, move!

1050
01:09:18,956 --> 01:09:20,455
Yes.

1051
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:21,589
<i>autumn</i>

1052
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:22,656
<i>What?</i>

1053
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:23,524
Swimming?

1054
01:09:40,806 --> 01:09:42,173
Happy birthday, honey.

1055
01:09:42,175 --> 01:09:43,574
Thank you.

1056
01:11:01,848 --> 01:11:02,581
Hello.

1057
01:11:03,349 --> 01:11:04,082
Hello.

1058
01:11:04,084 --> 01:11:05,950
Heather. Christina.

1059
01:11:05,952 --> 01:11:06,984
Keep shark.

1060
01:11:06,986 --> 01:11:08,852
Bring the shark here.

1061
01:11:17,927 --> 01:11:19,260
Welcome back to the pool.

1062
01:11:19,262 --> 01:11:20,861
It's nice to be back.

1063
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:28,734
Well... hello everyone, hello...

1064
01:11:28,736 --> 01:11:31,536
Before we adjourn tonight

1065
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:33,838
I'll ask Bob if it's okay that I somehow

1066
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,806
<i>blessed</i>
<i>i get into this house</i>

Amin.

1070
01:11:42,778 --> 01:11:43,844
I love you, buddy.

1071
01:11:54,088 --> 01:11:55,755
<i>Mama.</i>

1072
01:11:56,723 --> 01:11:58,256
Lord, I want to thank you

1073
01:11:58,258 --> 01:12:01,225
For this beautiful young man
that Henry has become.

1074
01:12:01,227 --> 01:12:06,296
<i>Thank you gave him life,</i>
<i>and allowed us to enjoy the time with him.</i>

1075
01:12:06,298 --> 01:12:08,231
<i>As he enters</i>
<i>his late teenage years,</i>

1076
01:12:08,233 --> 01:12:09,966

But I will go to see if my Amy

1168

But you he needs you.
No, you need it more.

1173

Hey, I listen to music when
go to sleep,

1175
01:20:33,484 --> 01:20:35,183
If it's wrong?

1176

Yes, that's nice.

1177
01:20:36,785 --> 01:20:39,319
Well... What do you want to hear?

1178
01:20:39,321 --> 01:20:40,787
It's not important.

1179
01:20:40,789 --> 01:20:42,655
You have good taste, you dial.

1180
01:20:42,657 --> 01:20:44,189

I want to apologize for...

1183
01:21:13,547 --> 01:21:15,747
I have not talked to you in school.

1184
01:21:17,883 --> 01:21:19,416

That's fine.

1188

Do you want to love?

1189
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:53,243
What do you think?

1190
01:21:55,145 --> 01:21:57,145
I think... this.

1191
01:21:58,814 --> 01:22:00,815
Perhaps this is good.

1192
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:10,356
Good.

1193
01:22:11,524 --> 01:22:13,224
