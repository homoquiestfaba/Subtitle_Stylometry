- You're welcome.

Look, P, you know the whole
"playbook for the house" thing?

1044

No more buttonooks in the kitchen.

1045
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,848
Right. No more buttonooks.

1046
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:33,616
You see, the quarterback
is supposed to know the playbook

1047
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,281
better than anybody.

All right.

1052
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:51,134
Listen, sometimes a quarterback
has got to think on his feet

1053
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,801
and call an audible, okay? And...

1054
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,244

and all of a sudden
you've got to call an audible

1059

to change the play,
and you go around and you score!

Sometimes things
get thrown at you unexpectedly.

1065
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,964
Then you got to call an audible.

1066
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,031
You got to learn on the go.

1067
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:29,636

- Okay.
