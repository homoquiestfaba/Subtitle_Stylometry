[Sighs]

25
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:53,477
Oh, man! Ooh!

26
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:56,393
You know, we
really should find
someone for Amy.

27
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:59,091
I don't know why she
has such a hard time
meeting guys.

28
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:01,093
You'd think that
wouldn't be a problem.

29
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:03,139
You worry about
her too much.

30
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,706
Well, she's
all alone here.

31
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:06,925
Her ex-husband really
did a number on her,
let me tell you.

32
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:07,883
Yeah?

33
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:09,145
Oh, god. Peter
was a real mess--

34
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,975
affairs and all sorts
of prescription drugs...

35
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:13,802
Oh, god.

36
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,020
He was
a divinity student.

37
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:17,762
Though now, I think
he works for perot.

38
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,634
Uh, I think i'm
gonna get going.

39
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:22,854
Already? Are you su--
you don't want another
drink or..?

40
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:24,595
No. I have to get
some sleep tonight.

41
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,858
I just got a look at
the bags under my eyes

42
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:28,208
in your bathroom mirror
and...

43
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:30,122
Oh, the light
in there is
just terrible.

44
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,125
What you need is
a big bay window
with natural light.

45
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:35,780
Sure. I'll request
that in my next Grant
application, I think.

46
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:38,043
After I finish begging
for food and shelter,

47
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,045
I'll just petition
the English department

48
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:43,135
for 40 grand in
construction funds.
No big deal.

49
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,267
[Telephone ringing]

50
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,487
So, Danny says you're
not seeing anyone.

51
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,707
He does?
Well, I know
my social life

52
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,796
is Danny's
pet project, but--

53
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,058
it's bleak,
that's true,

54
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,625
but not completely
unfamiliar.

55
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,366
Well, I don't really
know you that well,

56
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,675
but there are some men
around campus who
aren't that bad--

57
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:02,329
professors,
grad students...

58
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:04,069
No. I, uh...
I mean,
you're right.

59
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:05,767
There are men.
I see them around.

60
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,986
But they just all
turn out to be jerks

61
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,380
or in love with
somebody else
or something.

62
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:13,296
Ok. That was Alan.
Another reading
Sunday night.

63
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,167
Oh, god.
He's such an
awful writer.

64
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:17,996
You can't
expect US to sit
through that--

65
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,781
he really is terrible,

66
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:22,087
and I just sound like
an idiot trying to find
something nice to say,

67
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:25,090
searching for
something--anything--

68
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,092
that sounds
remotely sincere.

69
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:31,009
I just ramble...
Uncharacteristically.

70
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:33,316
Thanks.good night.Bye.

71
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,056
Bye.

72
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,449
Oh, Alan's awful.

73
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:38,147
"Perhaps part of the problem
was how he saw himself."

74
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,237
Oh, he's so
into himself,
it's disgusting.

75
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,543
It's all
about him.

76
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,109
Shh. It's
almost over.

77
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:46,547
"His rogue good looks,
so apparent to all
those around him,

78
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,637
"had only in recent years
become visible to Philip.

79
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,510
"And now, watching himself
in action--

80
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:57,819
"his athleticism,
his understated sexuality,

81
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:01,692
"and what he liked
to call his graceful
self-possession--

82
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:05,087
"brought him
the same pleasures
as would Mozart,

83
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,916
a good book,
or a heavy rain."

84
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,048
Did he just say
"heavy rain"?

85
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:14,183
Yes. Or "heavy cream."
I'm not sure.

86
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,579
Wh-what I meant
to say was--yeah?

87
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:20,668
That your stuff
has a real quality,
you know?

88
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:25,063
Like, some people might
call it self-involved
or narcissistic,

89
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:26,804
but why is that
a bad thing?

90
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:29,807
I, for one, think
that it is very daring

91
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:33,289
to be consumed with
yourself like that.

92
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,377
And that quote's
available

93
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:37,162
for the book flap,
if you're interested.

94
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:38,903
Hey, Danny.
How you doin'?I'm great.

95
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:41,471
Thanks
for coming.Hey, you bet.

96
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:44,082
Hi. Very nice,
Alan.

97
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:47,042
So, Danny, when
are your exams?

98
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:48,696
2 weeks.
Amy and I,

99
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:52,787
we both have 2 weeks
to learn 400 years of
English literature.

100
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,876
Ah, well, this
isn't college,
my friend.

101
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:57,313
This is graduate
school. You have to
keep up all along.

102
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,097
Oh, ok. Thanks for
the tip, coach.

103
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:02,492
I feel much better now.
The pressure's completely
lifted. Thank you.

104
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,059
I'm really glad
you came tonight.

105
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:05,539
I don't know if
Danny told you,

106
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:07,279
but I'm teaching
a seminar this term.

107
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:09,847
Hersey taught it,
and penn Warren
before him,

108
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:11,414
but if you're
around, if you
have time,

109
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,983
I'd really like
you to come talk
to the class.

110
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,071
Come on,
you're joking.

111
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:18,552
I mean, that's
ridiculous.

112
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,205
You've never even
read my stuff.

113
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:23,992
No, that's true, but
from what Danny says,
I'm sure it's great.

114
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:25,254
It's wonderful.
It is.

115
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:27,038
And you always
seem in such pain
when I read.

116
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:29,389
I figure your stuff
must be terrific.

117
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:30,738
Yeah, well,
I don't know.

118
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:33,262
I don't think I have
any great pearls
to pass on.

119
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:35,917
Think about it, ok?
I'll get your number
from Danny.

120
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,659
Just consider it.
That's all
I'm asking.

121
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:40,008
Hi.hey, sweetie.

122
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:42,793
Hey, Molly,
you remember these
people, don't you?

123
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,055
Sure. Hi.
Hey, Molly.

124
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,406
I saw you
out there.

125
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,626
Danny, I think
I'm gonna go home.

126
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,367
Um, excuse me
for a second.

127
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,023
Thanks for coming.
Hey...

128
00:06:55,458 --> 00:07:00,115
Why couldn't I have
just said, "very nice"?

129
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:02,509
You ok?
Is everything
all right?

130
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:05,033
No. I'm getting
my period,
my head hurts.

131
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:09,907
I just want to take
a 3-pound midol and
get in the bath.

132
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:13,433
You know
I don't do well
at these things.

133
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,043
Don't let me
spoil it for you.

134
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:18,481
Well, I'm just
gonna hang out for
a little while longer,

135
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:21,092
and then I'll stop by
afterwards, ok?

136
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:23,791
Ok...see you later.

137
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,140
Bye.

138
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,934
Oh, my sister...
Let me tell you,

139
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:39,067
she's not much
for learning,
you know?

140
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,243
She hardly made it
through high school.

141
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:43,898
She reads Garfield
calendars.

142
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:45,290
Not even the books.

143
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:49,294
Her idea of heavy
reading is a month
with 31 days.

144
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:52,428
I think i'm
a little drunk
from that wine.

145
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,169
I mean, she's happy.
She's completely...

146
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:57,128
I mean, I envy--
I envy her, really.

147
00:07:57,172 --> 00:08:00,392
I would gladly
trade 30 I.Q. Points

148
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:04,571
for the ability
to enjoy
rollerblading.

149
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:05,963
I'm flush,
I'm flush.

150
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:10,881
God, I can't
remember the last
time I was drunk.

151
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,535
You gonna make it?

152
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,756
Yeah.
You ok?

153
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,192
Yeah.

154
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:20,891
You are not still
worried about the
exams, are you?

155
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,284
Yeah.
Of course.

156
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:26,114
That is so silly.
You know as much
as I do.

157
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:29,160
I don't know,
I don't know,
I don't know.

158
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:30,771
Maybe I'm not
graduate material.

159
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,903
I reread Hamlet
the other day.

160
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:35,340
The only question
I could come up
with was

161
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:39,562
did the prince of Denmark
masturbate as much as I do?

162
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:43,784
It's not exactly
thesis material.

163
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:46,874
Before I forget.

164
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,963
This is for me?
Really?

165
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:50,965
What's the, uh..?Just open it.

166
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:54,098
Ok. An unexplained gift.

167
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:58,973
Am I ill? Do you
know something about
me that, uh...

168
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:04,805
My god...

169
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:08,460
Goodbye, Columbus.
A first edition.

170
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:10,941
Amy, this is, uh...
This is expensive.

171
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:12,247
No, it's not,
really.

172
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,988
I mean, it's
a first edition,

173
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,772
but it's only
a second printing.

174
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:16,947
It's kind of
nicked up.

175
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,080
I saw you
looking at it
the other day,

176
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:23,475
and I knew, of course,
you wouldn't buy it
for yourself, so...

177
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,868
Hey, do you
wanna come over?

178
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:27,262
I got a bottle of
wine just sitting
there waiting,

179
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:31,222
and a terrific
buzz on. I'd hate
to lose it at 9:00.

180
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,963
Uh...god,
actually, I can't.

181
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:36,924
Oh, we could just--
we don't have to drink,
if you don't want to.

182
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:39,796
No, no. I told Zoey
I'd stop by afterwards.

183
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,493
You know,
she's expecting me.

184
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:42,756
Right. Yeah, well...

185
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,628
I probably
shouldn't drink
anyway, you know.

186
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:49,023
I mean, maybe
I'm not that drunk,
actually.

187
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:49,893
I don't know.

188
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,591
Anyway.

189
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:55,290
Well, look, I'll see you
this weekend, right?

190
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,858
Yeah...that's fine.

191
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:58,902
Ok.ok.

192
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:01,601
Good night.Good night.

193
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:05,909
Oh, um...

194
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:07,171
Thanks for the book.

195
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:10,784
No. Sometimes,
those things depress me,

196
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:14,526
but tonight went...
Very well, I think.

197
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,920
Yes.i think it went
very well.

198
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:18,922
It did.
It went great.

199
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,271
Some of
your students,

200
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:23,057
they're younger
than me, and they
know so much.

201
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,147
They mentioned
writers I'd never
even heard of.

202
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,062
I think they
were writers.

203
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:29,367
See, I don't
even know.

204
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,761
Look at this.
We forgot to pay
the water bill.

205
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:32,936
You're a creative
person, Alan.

206
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,895
What do I do?
I take some
night classes

207
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:37,637
when i'm
not bartending.
What's that?

208
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,074
Hey, you understand art.

209
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:41,205
Oh, right.

210
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,207
No. I'm serious.
Not a lot of people do.

211
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:47,690
And you appreciate
good writing, like mine.
That's what's important.

212
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:48,996
Don't laugh.

213
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,172
There are
so many women
around here

214
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:54,436
you probably
have so much more
in common with.

215
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:55,829
Oh, that's right,
I forgot.

216
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:58,701
Those
fantastically interesting
grad school girls.

217
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:02,618
Please, miss peabody,
deconstruct Milton
for me one more time.

218
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,360
I'm not completely
asleep yet.

219
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,451
You shouldn't worry.

220
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:10,452
Yeah, yeah.

221
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:11,540
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,368
I know.

223
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,244
Hey, you know
that song

224
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:23,117
at the beginning
of the Mary Tyler
Moore...

225
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,814
You know,
it goes like...

226
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,076
"She can take
a nothing date,

227
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,991
and suddenly,
make it all seem
worthwhile"?

228
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:31,952
How does she make
a nothing date
worthwhile?

229
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:34,737
Does that mean,
at the end of
the night,

230
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:35,956
she just blows
the guy?

231
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:38,959
"I know this was
a crappy date,
but...

232
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:41,265
This should make it
worthwhile."

233
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,963
"Nothing day."

234
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:44,138
What?

235
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:46,923
"Nothing day."
Not "nothing date."

236
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:47,881
No guy.

237
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:49,926
Oh.

238
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,493
Well, that
explains it.

239
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:54,844
Hey, Tim, can I
ask you a question?

240
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,237
Yeah.

241
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,196
What is this?

242
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,722
Shit. God, I wish
you hadn't found
that.

243
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:07,378
Well, captain Nemo,
do you want to...
Explain this?

244
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:10,904
Well...there's
this girl--woman--

245
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:13,907
who lives in
the apartment
across the way.

246
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,474
She likes to
walk around a lot
in lingerie.

247
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:19,521
Sometimes naked
even. Anyway,
that's it.

248
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:23,917
Right. So,
where does the naval
technology come in?

249
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,877
So she won't look out
the window and see me
and get scared.

250
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:32,316
Great. So instead, she'll
be scared she's gonna get
hit by a torpedo.

251
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,145
Look, it's not like
I'm videotaping her
or anything.

252
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:39,628
Yes, yes, we all
commend you for
that, but, uh...

253
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:41,935
A little restraint, huh?

254
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,937
Ok, Tim?

255
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,854
Are you really sure
you want me there?

256
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:53,033
Well, it's your class,
but...Ok.

257
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:55,339
Right. And what time?

258
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:59,082
8:00 to 10:00. Ok.

259
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:03,913
Yeah, ok...
And good-bye.

260
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:16,970
Hey, uh, I been
looking at your
crossword puzzle here.

261
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:20,712
Um...i think you made
a mistake on 6 down.

262
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:27,197
I could be wrong,
but I don't think "slim"
is a biblical name.

263
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,199
You got
a little sun today.

264
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:31,636
Yeah. Another
productive day
of studying.

265
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,551
Anyway, I shouldn't be
too late tonight.

266
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:36,772
Alan just wants me
to sit in and get
a feel for it

267
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,166
if I'm going to give
the lecture next month.

268
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,777
Then I'll come back
and sleep here, ok?

269
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,213
And, um,
you know what?

270
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:46,129
That story I've
been working on is
going really well.

271
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:50,351
It's really turning out
well, I think.

272
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,440
What?

273
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,659
You look pretty.

274
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,052
No.

275
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:58,489
Yes, you do.

276
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,491
You really do.

277
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:01,971
Thank you.

278
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:04,887
Thank you.

279
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:08,412
I'm just reminded
of that old adage:

280
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:10,893
"Those who
can't do, teach."

281
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:13,765
But you're
a terrific teacher...

282
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:14,897
I have to admit.

283
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:17,073
And you're a writer
and a teacher.

284
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:19,859
You seem to be having
your share of success.

285
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,992
Well, you, too.
That fellowship
is great.

286
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,124
I'm envious.

287
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,647
Please, don't start
sounding like Danny.

288
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,127
What, I sound
like Danny?

289
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,608
No. He's always
trying to convince me
of my own worth.

290
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:32,915
I know what I have
going for me.

291
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,962
I know what I have
and what I don't have,

292
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:39,008
and I'm perfectly fine
with it.

293
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:42,185
And you and Danny,
boy, you guys
seem very...

294
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:44,927
Yeah, he's wonderful.

295
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:45,972
He's a great guy.

296
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,843
When I came here
for the fellowship,

297
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,931
I didn't know a soul.

298
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:51,194
It could've been
a really lonely--

299
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:52,674
terrible, lonely year,

300
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:57,505
and it's been--
it's been wonderful.

301
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:59,420
It's funny,
you know...

302
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:01,074
The, uh, people
we're with.

303
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:03,772
I just think that
you always have
this perfect type,

304
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:07,776
I mean, in your head,
and then everyone goes
off and gets married,

305
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:11,823
and how many times
have you heard them
come back and say,

306
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:14,000
"he's not who I
expected I'd be with,"

307
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:17,917
or, "she's not at all
who I'd have seen
myself with."

308
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,963
And then when they say
that, what do I say?

309
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,573
I say, "well,
congratulations.

310
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:24,967
"You're very lucky
to have found someone

311
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:28,101
so completely wrong
for you."

312
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:31,713
I mean, I didn't
mean--i wasn't--

313
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,106
oh, no.

314
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:38,850
I just think
someone like you...

315
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:40,765
Deserves...

316
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:44,334
Well, you know.

317
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:48,904
Maybe.

318
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,307
It's 11:30.

319
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,308
Is it?

320
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,744
Yeah.

321
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:05,747
Maybe we
should, um...

322
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:11,100
Get back to our
respective lives
about now.

323
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:11,971
Yup.

324
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,016
Well, there must
be someone--

325
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,280
someone healthy
and sane.

326
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:20,501
Gee, let's not make
our standards too
impossible, ok?

327
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:24,722
I just don't know
why you can't meet
a nice fella.

328
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,289
I'll tell you why.

329
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,857
Because there are
a bunch of losers
and weirdos out there.

330
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,990
Actually,
I kind of like
the losers.

331
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,296
It's the weirdos that
are more of a problem.

332
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,344
I have a friend
who only dates guys
she doesn't like.

333
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,085
She said she used to
date guys she liked,

334
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:43,350
but she gets so nervous
alternately trying to
make a good impression

335
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:45,178
and worrying what
they thought about her

336
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:47,919
that she would just
become this nervous wreck
and scare everyone off.

337
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,704
But now, dating guys
she doesn't like,

338
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:53,577
she feels relaxed,
in control, and great
about herself.

339
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:55,101
Isn't that weird?

340
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:58,800
It's weird. Um...
It's not interesting,
but it's weird.

341
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:03,892
Hey, wait a--
I forgot. Oh,
this is perfect.

342
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,198
My friend Tim.

343
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:08,766
I mean,
the two of you guys.
What do you think?

344
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,074
I don't know. Tim?
He seems so odd to me

345
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:15,077
with the satellite dish
with the 500 channels.

346
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,079
I mean, he's always
watching TV.

347
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,342
True, true,
but a couple
of years ago,

348
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:20,735
before he
dropped out,

349
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,477
he was a real
big deal in the
physics department.

350
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,914
I mean, really,
he's a very
bright guy.

351
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,960
I know. I thought
you said he was
seeing someone.

352
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:30,484
Seeing someone.
Um...

353
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:31,746
Technically, yes,

354
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,748
but not in the
traditional sense,
believe me.

355
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,447
Look, the four of US
will go out--me and
Zoey, you and Tim.

356
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:41,538
I'll probably just
end up talking to you
the whole night.

357
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:42,844
I think you guys
might--

358
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:45,151
Zoey, don't you
think they'd like
each other?

359
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:46,978
I didn't know
she was there.

360
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,589
Yup. See? She
agrees with me.

361
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:54,029
So, let's just do it
and not think about
it so much, ok?

362
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,987
Ok...all right.

363
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:59,904
Ok. Anyway, I'll
talk to you later,
all right?

364
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,515
Hey, Danny?
Yeah?

365
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:06,955
Uh, do you think
it's possible there's
a third sex out there

366
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:09,349
that's really good
at relationships?

367
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:13,135
Yeah, I met him.
He cuts my hair.

368
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:16,051
All right.
Good night.

369
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,750
Ok, good night. Bye.

370
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,976
Amy and Tim.

371
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,110
Hmm...

372
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,505
Maybe
it'll work out
with them.

373
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,127
[Ringing]

374
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:51,260
Hello?

375
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:54,002
I'm running out of
reasons to call you.

376
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:55,438
Hello?

377
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:57,484
It's Alan.

378
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:58,615
I know.

379
00:18:58,659 --> 00:18:59,834
I thought about
calling to ask

380
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:01,357
what you're gonna talk
to my class about,

381
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:02,880
but I didn't want
to be pushy.

382
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,273
Oh, no.
You're not being.

383
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:07,058
I--i don't know
what it'll be yet.

384
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,583
No, I know. Um...

385
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,585
Look, can I see you?

386
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:12,412
Now?

387
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:16,155
Yeah. You doing
anything?

388
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,068
No.

389
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:19,984
Do you wanna
meet me somewhere?

390
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:20,942
Ok.

391
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:22,465
Do you know where
my office is?

392
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:25,729
It's the first floor
of the English building--
room 106.

393
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:28,515
Give me
half an hour.

394
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:29,733
Alan?

395
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:32,127
Yeah, ok. Um...

396
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:37,132
So, you're gonna, uh...
We're gonna see
each other?

397
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,570
Yeah. Good-bye.

398
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:41,919
Bye.

399
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,968
Hi. You found it.

400
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,317
Hello.

401
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:55,977
Well, this, uh...
This is um...

402
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,066
I have all this
extra energy.

403
00:19:58,109 --> 00:19:59,937
What is the word
for that?

404
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,157
Um...i feel, uh...
What is that?

405
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,116
Punchy. Do I seem
that way to you?

406
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,422
A little.

407
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:08,032
They say weather
has something to do
with that.

408
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:12,733
It's cooling off.
The change in the seasons.

409
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:15,431
That couch is really good
for napping on.

410
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:18,260
It doesn't look it,
but it's very...

411
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,697
Molly thinks, uh...

412
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:24,527
Molly. God.
No, that's, uh...
No. That's not good.

413
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:29,532
Well...molly, you know?
Um...I don't know.

414
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:33,057
I wonder what we have
in common sometimes.

415
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,103
Is that for my sake?

416
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:36,452
What?

417
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:38,672
Because to be
honest, Alan,
I really don't care.

418
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:43,024
All that,
that's entirely
your business.

419
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:46,027
You know Danny
and I are friends.

420
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,118
Hmm. Again,
your business.

421
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:54,992
Look, we both know
why you called me,
and why I'm here.

422
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:58,126
And I'm not trying
to make this hard
on you,

423
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:03,523
but I refuse to
coax you or talk
you through it.

424
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:06,003
I came here
to see you.

425
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:10,051
I'm glad you came.
I wanted you to come.

426
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,836
Yeah? Well, I don't
get that from you.

427
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,056
You seem nervous
and guilty.

428
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:18,102
And if you're
trying to set
the proper mood,

429
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:22,629
there are probably
some better emotions
to choose.

430
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:25,371
Yes, um...

431
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:30,201
You're right.

432
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:33,335
Hey, um...
I guess I just...

433
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:38,775
I like to think
I'm a little suaver
than I actually am.

434
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:41,256
You'll, uh...

435
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,520
You'll permit me
that, ok?

436
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:50,483
God...i just think
you're beautiful,
you know?

437
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:54,922
I think you're
wonderful, honestly.

438
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:19,729
Danny,
listen to this...

439
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:23,907
Danny?

440
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:27,520
Hey.

441
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:53,110
I took out
a personal ad
once.

442
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:54,677
I'm not ashamed
of it.

443
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:56,026
You never
told me this.

444
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,028
Yeah. It was
after my divorce,

445
00:22:58,072 --> 00:22:59,900
and I wasn't
meeting anyone,

446
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:01,945
and so I took out
the ad.

447
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:03,251
What'd it say?

448
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:03,947
The ad?

449
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:06,036
It started with, uh...

450
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,039
"Come march
in my parade."

451
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,432
"Come march
in my parade."

452
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:13,217
Now, I know it wasn't
the most clever,

453
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:17,221
but the guy at the paper
liked it, and so,
you know, I...

454
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,615
Anyway, then it
went on from there.

455
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:21,922
"Come march
in my parade."

456
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:23,227
Did anyone
answer it?

457
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:25,534
Yeah,
a couple of guys.

458
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:28,885
And 3
high school
bands.

459
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:30,626
Hey!

460
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,672
Hey. Hi.

461
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,282
Alan, look.

462
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:37,372
Hey, Danny, hi--
oh! Everyone.

463
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,721
Hi.hello.

464
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:41,768
Oh, this is
my brother Rick
and his wife candy.

465
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:43,813
You wanna join US?
We can pull up
a table.

466
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,772
Oh, we're just
on our way out.

467
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:47,034
We ate back
over there.

468
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:50,254
They're heading
back up to the
lake tonight.

469
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:52,474
What part of
the lake are
you going to?

470
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:53,823
Do you know
the area?

471
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,085
Actually, no.

472
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:57,348
I just always
hear people ask
that question,

473
00:23:57,392 --> 00:24:00,700
so your answer
won't matter anyway.

474
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:01,962
We should
get going.

475
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,921
They wanna
head back before
it gets too late.

476
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:06,096
Nice seeing
you guys.

477
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,490
Have a good night.Bye.Nice to meet you.

478
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,449
Good to
meet you.
Bye.

479
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:14,235
Very domestic looking.

480
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:17,368
I know.
I wonder if he stops
screwing freshmen

481
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:19,893
when her family
comes into town.

482
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:22,417
Can I get you all
anything else?

483
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,811
Uh, yeah. You
want another one?

484
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:27,509
Oh, sure. I can
sleep in late.

485
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:28,379
Zoey?

486
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:30,512
Tim: Uh, I'll
have another.

487
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:31,861
Zoey?

488
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:36,300
Uh, no. Nothing.

489
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,955
Tim really
liked her.

490
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:42,089
He said he
thought Amy was
a dynamite lady.

491
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:43,438
"Dynamite lady."
Jesus.

492
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,745
The guy's been
watching too many
Sinatra movies.

493
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:48,748
Wasn't that bizarre?
Do you think that
was really bizarre

494
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:51,098
that we all ended up in
the same place tonight?

495
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:53,143
Did Amy happen
to say anything
to you about Tim

496
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:55,015
when you guys
were in the bathroom
together?

497
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:59,106
It's a Saturday night.
We're all in the same place.
We happen to see them.

498
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:00,716
You think she'd
say something.

499
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,980
She didn't happen
to say anything about
Tim? Nothing at all?

500
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:06,983
She's hardly going
to confide in me.
She's your friend.

501
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:08,376
I just think
it's so weird.

502
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:11,553
How many dozens
of restaurants are
there to eat at?

503
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:12,989
Jesus, in walks
Alan and Molly

504
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:15,601
and their cousins
from wherever the
fuck knows where.

505
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:17,864
Why is everyone
so insular in
this place?

506
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:19,909
We all have to eat
at the same restaurant,

507
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,824
same time,
on a Saturday night.

508
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:23,565
That's so
claustrophobic.

509
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:26,437
Maybe there's a problem,
trying to set two people
up in that place.

510
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:30,790
Jesus,
if my landlord hasn't
fixed the thermostat...

511
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:34,489
Oh, no, of course not.
It's horrible.

512
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,970
It's still like
there's a harbor in here.

513
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,624
Uh...look,
I'm still kinda hungry.

514
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:41,888
Do you mind? I know
you have a can of ravioli
here someplace.

515
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:43,411
I've been seeing it
around for months.

516
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:45,718
Huh! You'd think
there would be a
restaurant in this town

517
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:49,417
where people could eat
without the whole world
filing past.

518
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,376
Aha!

519
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,464
You ok?

520
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:54,553
Yes.

521
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:55,423
No.

522
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:56,990
No. It's been
an awful week,

523
00:25:57,033 --> 00:26:00,384
and I don't really
understand why you'd
want to be around me

524
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:01,647
when I'm like this.

525
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,999
Well, i--
I find mood swings
very endearing.

526
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:10,830
Danny,
maybe we need to
reevaluate things.

527
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:12,005
"Reevaluate"?

528
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:14,529
As in, uh...

529
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,706
"Don't eat my ravioli"

530
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,968
or...

531
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:22,015
"Reevaluate" as Stalin
might've used the word?

532
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:23,146
God...

533
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,193
I can't feel
so responsible
for someone.

534
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:27,934
I'm not capable
of it.

535
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,326
I can barely
make myself happy

536
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,677
dragging myself
out of bed and
through the day.

537
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,897
I can't feel
this responsible
for someone else.

538
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:37,291
Look, I appreciate
the attempt

539
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,902
to make yourself
look less attractive,

540
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:40,642
but--

541
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:43,602
it's not an attempt.

542
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:48,694
It's just...

543
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,391
Something's
not right, Danny.

544
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:53,002
You must know that.

545
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,830
Zoey...

546
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:59,618
What are you
trying to say?

547
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:06,015
Yeah...

548
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:09,845
That's what I thought.

549
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,067
Excuse me, uh...

550
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,158
Can I have
another, please?

551
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:21,814
Don't I know you
from someplace?

552
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:23,032
You look
very familiar.

553
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:26,079
Yeah. I served you
your first 4 drinks also.

554
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:27,384
Oh, that's right.

555
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,473
It's an awful line,
isn't it?

556
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:30,605
Yeah, I know.

557
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,694
You know, friends
of mine get divorced,

558
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:34,478
their predatory skills
come right back

559
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:37,917
to when they were 22.
Me, uh...

560
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,441
Actually,
I'm not divorced.

561
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:42,791
Hmm. You know,
when you're over 40
and you're single,

562
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:44,967
women want to hear
that you've been
divorced once

563
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:47,796
so they don't think
you've been living
with your mother

564
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,016
the whole time,
which is, uh...

565
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:51,800
Certainly not the case.

566
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:55,369
So, what, are you
dropping your daughter
off or something?

567
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:56,849
My daughter. Oh, no,

568
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,938
but that's very sweet
of you, thank you.

569
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:01,941
No, I'm teaching
a course this semester.

570
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:04,726
Writing for television.

571
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,815
No kidding.

572
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,643
No kidding.

573
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,993
You know, Alan--

574
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:11,690
Alan?

575
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,126
My boyfriend.Oh.

576
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:14,997
He hates television
like he's above it
or something,

577
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,434
but I really like it.
I mean, I always have.

578
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:18,522
Do you write?

579
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:20,611
What do you mean,
television writing?

580
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:22,875
Well, let's
not keep saying
television writing.

581
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:26,879
Let's say
the long form for
the small screen.

582
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:30,534
The long form
for the small screen.

583
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:34,016
Well,
that's interesting.

584
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,062
Man: Here we go!

585
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:39,021
Man, panting:
Hold--hold it a second.

586
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:46,463
What kind of university
teaches a course
in TV writing?

587
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:49,162
Huh? What's next,
they got a symposium
on...Welding?

588
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:51,512
Come on. I thought
you'd be happy
for me.

589
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:52,556
I feel like crap.

590
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,123
Well, maybe if
you get some sleep

591
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,995
instead of staying
at your office till
god knows when, hmm?

592
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:58,998
And Bruce, you know,
he hasn't just
written for TV.

593
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,129
Bruce? Ha ha!

594
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:01,827
He writes plays and
all sorts of stuff.

595
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,741
Bruce! Bruce!

596
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,003
And I told him
all about you.

597
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:06,832
Oh, I'm sure Bruce is
real interested in me.

598
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:07,789
He was.

599
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:08,834
Yes, Bruce was
fascinated with me

600
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:10,749
and my writing process,

601
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,402
your tits...

602
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:15,014
Don't tell me
you're jealous.

603
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:15,841
Jealous?

604
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:18,234
Good! I like that.

605
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:36,557
If only I felt
like this after
the stairmaster.

606
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:41,867
My god,
you are so hot.

607
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:46,436
You know, sometimes
I sit at my office,

608
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,177
and I think
about your body.

609
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:49,613
For hours.

610
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:50,701
I get no work done.

611
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,225
I have a stack of
midterms on my desk

612
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:54,270
that should've been
graded weeks ago.

613
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:57,708
It's...it's crazy.

614
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:01,930
You know, I am
gonna leave her.

615
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:02,757
Uh-huh.

616
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,106
I am. It's
just a question

617
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,804
of finding
the right time,

618
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:06,979
you know, finding...

619
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:08,937
That...time, and...

620
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,852
Timing.

621
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:13,202
This is very much
about timing.

622
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:14,551
Ha ha!

623
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:16,162
If you're going
to treat me like
the other woman,

624
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:18,120
at least treat me like
an intelligent woman.

625
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:19,861
I mean, "timing"?

626
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:21,297
I know, I know.

627
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:23,212
At least, tell me
you stay together
for tax reasons.

628
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:24,648
Now, that'll be good.

629
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:26,041
I know. I'm a prick,
but I'm not gonna
stay with her

630
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:28,000
and
drive her crazy like
I've been doing.

631
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:30,959
Look, I may be
a bastard for all
the obvious reasons,

632
00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:33,875
but if you look
at me, I mean,
really examine

633
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,790
how I struggle
with these things,

634
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,924
then I think
I'm a pretty
considerate guy.

635
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:43,319
But if I don't leave
her right away,
that's ok, too.

636
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:44,190
Right?

637
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:46,714
Ok. You got
the assignments.

638
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:48,977
See you next Thursday.

639
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,987
No. Because
you got to stick...

640
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,336
Everything is, uh...

641
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,948
Stick to the facts,
all right?

642
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:13,872
[Running steps]

643
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,612
Molly?

644
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:16,613
Hi.

645
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:17,832
Hi.

646
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,312
So, was it everything
you hoped it would be?

647
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:21,009
Oh, it was amazing.

648
00:31:21,053 --> 00:31:22,402
Yeah?

649
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,317
Yeah. I had no idea
so much goes
into every script,

650
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,841
scenes
and acts and...

651
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,930
I don't know,
I guess I just
used to think

652
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:30,932
actors
just made it up
as they went along.

653
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:32,499
Yeah, well, so do they.

654
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,849
Well, let me cleverly
turn the conversation
around on me.

655
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,634
I mean, how was I?
Was i--was I boring?

656
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,375
Did I talk too much?

657
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,682
Was I too handsome and
distinguished standing
in front of the class?

658
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:43,945
It was--it was
great, really.

659
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:44,772
Yeah?

660
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:45,904
Yeah. I mean,
so exciting.

661
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:47,993
I can't wait and try
and write something.

662
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,908
Yeah? You have an idea?

663
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,039
No...

664
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,258
Well,
you know, I mean,
I think I do.

665
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:55,957
I get one
and then, phfft!

666
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,177
I'm not really
a writer, you know.

667
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,874
Why not?

668
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,310
I think you could be.

669
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:03,617
I mean,
you seem like a person
who has a lot to say.

670
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,750
Maybe nobody
to say it to.

671
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:09,101
You know, I really
wouldn't say that.

672
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:10,841
I mean, no,
I'd have to say

673
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:13,583
that you're wrong
about that.

674
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:15,890
What, you have
nothing to say?

675
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,979
Ha ha! No.

676
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:21,156
I mean, I've someone
to say it to.

677
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,244
And he listens?

678
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:24,725
Yeah, he listens.

679
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:59,803
I quit.

680
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,790
Ahh...i want to
make love to you.

681
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,096
Do you hear me?

682
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,184
I want to make
love to you.

683
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:35,883
You're so proper.
You can say "fuck."

684
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:36,840
Ok.

685
00:33:36,884 --> 00:33:39,017
Fuck, I want
to make love to you.

686
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,757
Ha ha!

687
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:42,542
I mean, was there
someone else?

688
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:43,891
Was she seeing
someone, or...

689
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:45,240
Danny: Well,
she didn't say.

690
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:47,938
I mean,
I don't think so,
but...

691
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:50,028
God,
maybe I should've
seen it coming.

692
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:51,768
She's been
so moody lately.

693
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:53,031
How long's she been
moody for?

694
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,859
Well,
we've been together
for about a year,

695
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,513
so...

696
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:58,906
10 months.

697
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:00,473
I don't know,
I don't know.
Maybe--maybe--

698
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:02,910
maybe I'm just drawn
to unstable women.

699
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:04,259
You know,
I was watching

700
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:07,001
splendor
in the grass
the other day.

701
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,133
Gotta admit,

702
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:09,917
I found Natalie wood
much more attractive

703
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,006
after she was
institutionalized.

704
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,355
I mean, those--

705
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:15,140
those cute little
smocks they put
her in just...

706
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:16,793
Danny, I think
it's just a bad idea

707
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:20,014
to give someone
that much importance
that you give to Zoey.

708
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,711
Yeah, I know.

709
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:23,235
I mean, people don't
want to know that they
can hurt other people

710
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:24,497
because,
inevitably, they will.

711
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,020
We are not a kind species,
you know. We just...

712
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,196
Every chance we get,
we weed out
a few more of US.

713
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,416
In prehistoric times,
it was the guy
with the devil,

714
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:33,332
and then, you know,
it was people with
the black lung or scurvy

715
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:36,857
and now it's men who
love the wrong women.
I mean,

716
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,380
in a couple of years,

717
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:40,165
all thinking people
will be gone.

718
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,209
The only people left

719
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:44,169
are gonna be
baseball players' wives.

720
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:45,387
Hmm.

721
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:46,562
Yeah, thanks.

722
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:48,521
I mean,
I didn't come at it
quite so...

723
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:51,001
Anthropologically,
but, uh...

724
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:54,918
I just know I
don't feel so good.

725
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:56,529
Hey...

726
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:58,008
Hey, how's this?

727
00:34:58,052 --> 00:34:59,358
Why don't we
skip dinner--

728
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,360
I haven't put
the chicken in yet--

729
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:03,710
and let's get stoned?

730
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:07,975
Uh...no, I
don't think so, no.

731
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:09,455
Come on,
it'll be great!

732
00:35:09,498 --> 00:35:11,805
No, I've got this pot
from when Peter
and I split up.

733
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:12,936
You have pot?

734
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,981
Really, you
have got pot?

735
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:16,201
Yes. I've had it
for, like, 3 years.

736
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:17,811
Hold on, I'll get it.

737
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:18,812
You got pot.

738
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:20,466
Yeah, I never touch it.

739
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:22,772
When Peter gave it
to me, he was trying
to quit for...Anyway...

740
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:25,993
Hey, by the way,
your friend Tim
called me.

741
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:27,908
Yeah, yeah.
He really likes you.

742
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:29,039
I mean, he really--

743
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,694
he left a message
on the machine.

744
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:33,914
You know, I never
called him back,
but I...

745
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:37,352
I feel bad about this.
He seems so sweet,
you know, but I'm just--

746
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,833
I'm really not
interested.

747
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:43,010
God, I can't remember
the last time I smoked.

748
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:45,012
Holy shit!

749
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:47,014
I know. I mean,
there's a lot,
you know.

750
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:48,407
Peter was
a really big--

751
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,017
Christ,
look at this!

752
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,887
Oh, my god!

753
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:52,498
What was he
trying to do,

754
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,761
corner the market
and drive up
the price

755
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:56,023
like
the hunt brothers
or what?

756
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:58,068
Ridiculous. I mean,
I never use it, you know,

757
00:35:58,112 --> 00:36:00,245
and i--there's
enough here, right?

758
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:01,550
Enough? Um...

759
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,857
You're
in cheech and Chong
territory here, ok?

760
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,728
You probably
shouldn't keep
all this

761
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:06,773
in your apartment.

762
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,166
How much
did your ex-husband
smoke?

763
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:09,428
Oh, a lot, a lot.
I mean,

764
00:36:09,471 --> 00:36:12,692
and this was on top
of all the seconal.

765
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:14,128
Well, um, ok.

766
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,435
Uh, boy. Uh...

767
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:17,827
Ha. If you
wanna smoke this,

768
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:19,220
do you have
any rolling paper--

769
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:21,396
well, this is
a large amount.
Um...

770
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,877
Maybe
a flour tortilla?

771
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,835
There's a pipe
in the bag.

772
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,881
A pipe in the bag.

773
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:29,970
Jesus. Um...

774
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:30,797
All right.

775
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,928
All right,
all right, good.

776
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:33,278
Can you please
lock the door?
And, uh...

777
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:35,149
Please, draw
the shades, too.

778
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,412
Make sure,
because we do have
quite a bit here,

779
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:41,373
and I'm fairly sure
that if we're caught
with this...

780
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:44,941
We can get
the death penalty.

781
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:48,989
[Folk music playing]

782
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:50,817
Mmm...

783
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:55,778
Hi.

784
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:57,563
You just wake up?

785
00:36:57,606 --> 00:37:01,175
Yeah, I guess. Was
I asleep for long?

786
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,220
Uh...i don't know.

787
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,831
I dozed off
a little, too.

788
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:05,919
Getting old,
you know.

789
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:07,790
I mean, we smoke
a milligram of pot,

790
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,358
and we act like
glaucoma patients.

791
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:13,013
[Laughs]

792
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:15,015
Well, I feel...

793
00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:16,277
Very relaxed.

794
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,888
[Laughs]

795
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:21,151
Mmm...

796
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:22,501
Are you ok?

797
00:37:22,544 --> 00:37:23,850
Yeah.

798
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:26,722
You know,
I lose my stipend
since I dropped out.

799
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:28,550
I'd forgotten
about that.

800
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:30,813
I have to earn
some money.

801
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:36,297
You know, if I want
to keep living indoors.

802
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:39,082
This song
always makes me
a little sad.

803
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:40,997
Mm.

804
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,304
It's nice.

805
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:45,306
You know,
it's funny.

806
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,613
I mean,
when you're a kid
and you like a boy--

807
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:49,832
I was just thinking
about this--

808
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:50,877
you don't
actually tell him,

809
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,879
because that's not
the way it's done,

810
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,141
but you, you know,

811
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:57,275
tease him
or call him names
or something

812
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:58,841
then pretty soon
he gets it,

813
00:37:58,885 --> 00:37:59,973
and if a boy
likes you back,

814
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:03,193
then he'd punch you
or pull your hair--

815
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:04,499
I forget
the exact trend--

816
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:07,720
but the point is
that as ridiculous
as it seemed

817
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:10,113
and as primitive
as it was,

818
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:12,202
it got the job done.

819
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:15,815
He knew
you liked him, and
you knew the same.

820
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:17,817
The sad thing is--
I'm 28 now--

821
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,255
when it comes
to telling a man how
I feel about him,

822
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,433
I was
more articulate
when I was 9.

823
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:29,089
I'm sorry. Oh!

824
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:30,960
Me with my theories.

825
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:32,266
Every twinge
of emotion

826
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,792
has to be
transcribed and
categorized like...

827
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,843
I love you, Danny.

828
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,279
I do.

829
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,717
And I have just
been holding it in
for way too long.

830
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:50,153
I'm just...You know,

831
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,460
impulsiveness
goes against all my
natural instincts,

832
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:56,508
and saying this
is just this
terrific...Release,

833
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:57,987
this rush of...

834
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:59,467
Will you please
say something,

835
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:00,860
because if I keep
going on, I'm gonna
cross that line

836
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:02,514
between
endearingly neurotic

837
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:06,344
and just
plain annoying.

838
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:08,389
Amy...

839
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:10,348
I...

840
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,482
I'm--I'm flattered.

841
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:16,179
I, uh...

842
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:17,616
Oh, Jesus!

843
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,922
No, really, I am.

844
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:21,881
I...

845
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:23,796
Amy, i--

846
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,799
now, just
don't insult me.

847
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:29,454
Ok, I'm a mess.
I'm a mess.

848
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:31,978
I mean, look,
look at me,
my life is--

849
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:32,761
I'm in no--

850
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:34,023
god, I feel
ridiculous!

851
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:35,677
I'm in no condition...

852
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:37,984
I'm--oh, boy...

853
00:39:38,027 --> 00:39:39,333
Teach me to act on--

854
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:44,077
I mean, to actually
act on something
I'm feeling.

855
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,774
Oh, god...

856
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:49,125
Excuse me,
I'm gonna have
to throw up now.

857
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:11,757
Molly: Alan?

858
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,759
Alan?

859
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:17,893
Alan?

860
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:21,984
♪ Alan

861
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:26,119
Alan! Ha ha!

862
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:27,120
Hi!

863
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:28,904
Hi.

864
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:30,471
So,
what did you think?

865
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:32,778
Did I write it well?

866
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,782
Yeah. You know,
it's, um, hard to--

867
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:39,393
it's a start.
It's 2 pages.

868
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,743
Come on.
Tell me, really.

869
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:43,397
It's hard to say.
It's 2 pages.

870
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,704
It's...missing
the middle and end

871
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:48,881
and most
of the beginning.
What?

872
00:40:48,924 --> 00:40:50,839
Wouldn't it be
easier just to say

873
00:40:50,883 --> 00:40:53,059
you don't like it?

874
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:55,496
Honey, it's 2 pages!
What do you think,

875
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,890
you're gonna sit down
the first time
and write Moby dick?

876
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:59,935
Oh, no, it's not a novel.
It's for television.

877
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:02,721
Oh, ok, the
television equivalent
of Moby dick.

878
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:05,288
What is that,
the jeffersons?

879
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:06,420
You're so funny, Alan.

880
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,943
Honey,
what do you think
I do all day?

881
00:41:07,987 --> 00:41:11,294
Do you think I write
2 pages and pat
myself on the back?

882
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:12,557
I mean, it, uh...

883
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,949
No, I'm sorry,
you know?

884
00:41:13,993 --> 00:41:16,038
You're right.
Jesus, what was
I thinking? This...

885
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:18,867
You know, I think
you should retire
on these 2 pages.

886
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:21,914
Really, because
I must've been
out of my mind,

887
00:41:21,957 --> 00:41:22,828
'cause I think...

888
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:24,438
You have reached
insights here

889
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,962

eluded the great...

"I like being a kid.

891
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:30,444
No one expects
anything of me."

892
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,534
Oh, boy, that
just...Really...

893
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:36,189
What do you
want me to say?
It's 2 pages!

894
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:36,972
I--aah!

895
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:39,192
Fuck! God damn it!

896
00:41:39,235 --> 00:41:40,062
You ok?

897
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:41,281
Fucking lamp!

898
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:42,717
You want me to
get you some ice?

899
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,937
I'm fine! It's just
like this fucking--

900
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,982
like knitting needles
and it's just like

901
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:48,810
you stub your toe
on everything, right?

902
00:41:48,854 --> 00:41:50,595
It's like
a full household of--

903
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:54,033
a household minefield
of household disasters.

904
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:55,730
[Sighs]

905
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:57,123
I should walk around
on stilts in this place.
Really, it's like--

906
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,168
it's a fucking pigsty,
see? Look at it.

907
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:01,693
Leave it there.
It's my shirt.
Don't pick it up.

908
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:03,129
Well, it's just
a few things.

909
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:04,696
Yeah, it's my mess.
Don't pick it up.
They're mine.

910
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:06,915
You don't have to
pick it up. You don't
have to clean up.

911
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,221
I'm putting them
in the hamper, ok?

912
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:11,790
Well, don't put them
in the fucking hamper!

913
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:16,621
[To himself]
Jesus Christ,
listen to me.

914
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:21,713
No, don't listen
to me. I...

915
00:42:21,756 --> 00:42:23,497
Why do you put up
with me? Jesus Christ,

916
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,107
I lecture you
on your writing
like, I mean,

917
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,850
what do I know?
I can't con anyone
into publishing my stuff.

918
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:30,722
I come home late,
I don't call you...

919
00:42:30,765 --> 00:42:33,376
This place
is a fucking pigsty,
and it's my fault!

920
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,770
It's my mess,
and you clean it up.

921
00:42:35,814 --> 00:42:36,858
It's not that bad.

922
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:38,251
I mean, everything
is my fucking fault.

923
00:42:38,294 --> 00:42:40,296
Why don't you
get angry at me?

924
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,167
Really?

925
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,429
Why don't you
just tell me,

926
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:44,083
"Alan,
you are a real prick,
you know that?"

927
00:42:44,126 --> 00:42:46,999
Because you're not!
You...

928
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,783
Why would I
say that?

929
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:51,003
I am a prick.
You know that.

930
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:54,049
Well, you should
stop saying that.

931
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,228
You know,
sometimes I wonder
what it would take

932
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:01,622
for you to get angry
at me. Really.

933
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:02,971
What it would take
for you to say,

934
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:05,626
"Alan, you are
a real prick!"

935
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,236
I mean, if there
is such a thing,

936
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,936
if there is such an act
that could be perpetrated.

937
00:43:15,288 --> 00:43:16,768
Alan, do me a favor

938
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:20,380
and tell me what it
is you've done.

939
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:22,251
Done? No,
i--i haven't--

940
00:43:22,295 --> 00:43:24,253
tell me!

941
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,955
Ok.

942
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:32,871
Ok,

943
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,873
I met someone.

944
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:37,527
You know, someone else.

945
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:40,530
I don't want you
to think it's you.
It's not...

946
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:44,273
You know, some
shortcoming in you.

947
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:49,148
Goddamn toe...

948
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:51,324
Why do you want
to marry me?

949
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:53,456
Why do you think
I'd be any better
at marriage

950
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,721
than I am
in anything else
in my life?

951
00:43:56,764 --> 00:43:58,766
I...oh,
Jesus Christ...

952
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,508
I--i feel nothing
but full of these...

953
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:03,205
Horrible clichés
right now.

954
00:44:03,249 --> 00:44:05,730
And what a crime
to be unoriginal,

955
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:07,427
right, Alan?

956
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:09,951
Look, I don't
want you to worry.

957
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:11,779
I'll move out.
I want you to keep
the house.

958
00:44:11,823 --> 00:44:13,302
We're paid up
to the end
of the month,

959
00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:15,478
and I'll...
I'll get out,

960
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:17,742
and I'll steer clear.

961
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:21,223
I'll have a place
by morning.

962
00:44:21,267 --> 00:44:25,445
I'll have a great
fucking place.

963
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:56,868
Sorry, i--i just didn't know
where else to go.

964
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:59,740
You'd think if
you live in a place
for 2 years,

965
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:02,830
you'd have options,
friends or something.

966
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:06,225
No, look, i'm
glad you came here.

967
00:45:07,835 --> 00:45:10,316
I guess he was
just bored with me.

968
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:11,665
Bored? Oh, no.

969
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,537
I mean, Alan
was the one with
all the experience.

970
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:17,758
He was it for me. He
was my experience.

971
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:19,107
Mm.

972
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:20,761
I guess people
aren't too impressed

973
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:22,023
when all you know
is them.

974
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:24,547
Well,
how could he not see
what you're about?

975
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:26,854
I mean...

976
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:28,813
You mind me sitting here?

977
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:31,554
It's your place.

978
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:34,775
Look,

979
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:37,778
Molly, I see someone
who's smart

980
00:45:37,822 --> 00:45:39,345
and intuitive

981
00:45:39,388 --> 00:45:41,913
and has a wonderful heart
and all sorts
of other qualities

982
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:43,915
which you probably
don't even recognize

983
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:46,265
because you've
been seeing yourself

984
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:48,484
through him for years.

985
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:49,747
So, instead,
you're saying

986
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,966
I should see myself
through you.

987
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,664
No.

988
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,928
Look,

989
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:58,756
maybe Alan
isn't the one.

990
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:01,367
I mean, I know
that destiny is a...

991
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,326
Popular concept
with people your age,

992
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,588
but trust me.

993
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:08,678
There's lots of people
out there for everybody.

994
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:10,028
Well,
if that's true,

995
00:46:10,071 --> 00:46:11,507
how come
you're alone?

996
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:14,206
Well, i'm
not talking about me.
I'm talking about you.

997
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:15,076
Ha ha!

998
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,425
I figure...

999
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:18,950
In a few years,
after I've given up
completely,

1000
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:20,212
I'll just, um...

1001
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:22,431
Have a bride
shipped from Korea.

1002
00:46:22,475 --> 00:46:23,693
Right.
Yeah.

1003
00:46:23,737 --> 00:46:25,086
Well, you'll know when
you get the invitation,

1004
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,219
'cause it'll say,
"Dr. Samuel foreman
invites you

1008
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,012
That's funny.
I can't tell

1009
00:46:38,056 --> 00:46:40,798
if you're
really smart or
really screwed up.

1010
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:43,626
Well, I used to be
really screwed up,

1011
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:44,889
but when you hit 40,

1012
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:47,805
they reclassify it all
as wisdom.

1013
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:50,242
That's--

1014
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:52,548
you're gonna be ok.

1015
00:47:03,995 --> 00:47:06,345
Oh, my god!
Do you know--
what time is it?

1016
00:47:06,388 --> 00:47:08,216
Oh! You know what,
I have this
appointment

1017
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,653
I'm supposed
to be at,
but I'm so stupid.

1018
00:47:10,697 --> 00:47:12,873
I'm supposed to meet
this person. I'm...

1019
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:14,614
Just totally forgot.
I'm sorry.

1020
00:47:14,657 --> 00:47:17,095
Thank you
for the water, ok?

1021
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:18,966
Thanks.

1022
00:47:22,535 --> 00:47:24,624
[Door shuts]

1023
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:55,742
Uh...
Kung pao chicken?

1024
00:47:55,785 --> 00:47:57,787
You said kung pao beef.

1025
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:01,922
Oh, all right,
all right, ok. Uh...

1026
00:48:01,966 --> 00:48:04,490
But...
Won ton soup, right?

1027
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:06,884
Egg drop.

00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:09,451

colossus review.

1207
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:08,773
Please,
very prestigious.

1208
00:57:08,816 --> 00:57:11,558
With a circulation
of what, 12?

1209
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:12,733
That's a well-respected
journal.

1210
00:57:12,777 --> 00:57:15,170
Yes, another
great literary
contribution

1211
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:17,346
from the sioux
nation.

1212
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:19,218
You know what seems
strange to me?

1213
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:20,828
You went out with Danny
for over a year.

1214
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:22,830
And by your own admission,
you gave him nothing.

1215
00:57:22,874 --> 00:57:24,876
You treated him like
shit half the time.That's not true.

1216
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:26,878
And now suddenly
he's the greatest guy

1217
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:28,227
to whom you've done
a horrible wrong.

1218
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,664
And you look at him--
don't think this escapes me.

1219
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:32,492
You look at him
almost reverentially.

1220
00:57:32,536 --> 00:57:33,450
You know nothing
about Danny.

1221
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:34,538
I know how
you looked at him.

1222
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:35,713
What is all this?
How I looked at him?

1223
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:37,149
I am with you now.
We're together.

1224
00:57:37,192 --> 00:57:38,455
Do you ever look
at me that way?

1225
00:57:38,498 --> 00:57:40,413
Do you ever extend me
the compassion,

1226
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,895
the support that
you're suddenly
summoning up for Danny?

1227
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:46,811
I see what this is
about: Insecurity.

1228
00:57:46,854 --> 00:57:48,465
Fuck goddamn insecurity.

1229
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:50,728
To you that, what,
is the dirtiest word
in the English language.

1230
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:52,077
What is it that
you want from me,
Alan?

1231
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,601
What is
the unconditional
support that you want?

1232
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:56,037
You want to hear
you're a great writer?

1233
00:57:56,081 --> 00:57:57,082
You're a great writer.

1234
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:58,736
You want to hear
you're a great lay?

1235
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:00,128
'Cause you're
a great fucking lay.

1236
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:02,174
What has been
the request I've
so unjustly denied?

1237
00:58:02,217 --> 00:58:03,828
Oh, yeah, I would like
to hear all of that.

1238
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:05,177
I'd like to be with
someone who thinks

1239
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,613
I'm the greatest thing
that ever happened to them.

1240
00:58:06,657 --> 00:58:08,310
That without me,
they didn't know
if they could go on.

1241
00:58:08,354 --> 00:58:11,226
Well, as soon as you
pry your mother away
from her second husband,

1242
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:15,404
I think you'll have
just what you nee.

1243
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,889
I'm going to take a bath.

1244
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:24,762
Why don't you eat something?

1245
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:31,551
It would've been
nice to have had
you there tonight.

1246
00:58:45,913 --> 00:58:47,349
[Whispering]
Jesus.

1247
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:48,655
Well,
it's nice to know

1248
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:51,571
they've instituted
a neighborhood watch
program.

1249
00:58:51,615 --> 00:58:53,791
I feel much safer.

1250
00:58:54,705 --> 00:58:55,923
Yeah, well,

1251
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:58,883
ideally you wouldn't
have found me like
this.

1252
00:58:58,926 --> 00:59:02,539
I'd rather not
be remembered
as a sociopath

1253
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:04,758
or a narcoleptic.

1254
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:11,243
So, uh, you're
in love with Alan.

1255
00:59:11,286 --> 00:59:14,289
How's that for
a segue, huh?

1256
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,769
I'm not in love
with Alan.

1257
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:18,598
God, do I seem
so unable to bring
meaning into my life,

1258
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:23,516
that I have to fall back
on what a man will provide?

1259
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,083
Jesus, listen to me.

1260
00:59:25,126 --> 00:59:27,302
Am I really this hard?

1261
00:59:27,346 --> 00:59:31,176
Is everyone else
just too damn earnest?

1262
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,180
It's funny.

1263
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:38,270
Alan leaves
his girlfriend
for you.

1264
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:40,838
And he's probably
slowly going insane

1265
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:44,711
trying to make you
love him the way
Molly did.

1266
00:59:44,755 --> 00:59:48,106
It's a nice story
like othello

1267
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:50,978
and the Saul wachler
case.

1268
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,201
[Car door opens and closes]

1269
01:00:02,207 --> 01:00:03,295
I almost forgot.

1270
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:05,689
I've been carrying
this around for weeks.

1271
01:00:05,732 --> 01:00:07,255
I think it's yours.

1272
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:09,344
Oh, yeah.

1273
01:00:11,738 --> 01:00:14,306
Gee, um, thank you.

1274
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:18,179
Thanks a lot.

1275
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:23,184
Molly?

1276
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:24,708
Hi.

1277
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:26,492
I haven't
seen you
in class.

1278
01:00:26,535 --> 01:00:27,493
Oh, gosh,

1279
01:00:27,536 --> 01:00:30,278
you know, I've just
been very busy

1280
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:31,845
with many things.
It's--

1281
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:33,499
didn't you get
my messages?

1282
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:35,806
I did. Yes, I did.

1283
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:37,111
You know what?

1284
01:00:37,155 --> 01:00:39,070
I apologize if you think
I've been avoiding you.

1285
01:00:39,113 --> 01:00:42,682
I've just been
really very busy
with many things and--

1286
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,075
I just wanted
to make sure

1287
01:00:44,118 --> 01:00:46,555
you had somewhere
to go on Friday.

1288
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:47,644
Friday?

1289
01:00:47,687 --> 01:00:49,428
Yeah, didn't you say
your lease was up

1290
01:00:49,471 --> 01:00:50,472
on the 30th?

1291
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:51,386
No, uh-uh.

1292
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:54,128
My lease runs through...

1293
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:57,088
Oh, shit.

1294
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:59,525
You don't have
to worry about that.

1295
01:00:59,568 --> 01:01:02,267
I have many people
I can stay with.

1296
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:03,660
Actually I've got
2 apartments

1297
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:05,096
I'm supposed to see
this afternoon.

1298
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:07,272
I thought maybe
you could stay with me

1299
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:08,403
until you get settled.

1300
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:11,102
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1301
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:13,017
Well, just till
you get settled.

1302
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,062
I mean, uh, you get
your own place,

1303
01:01:15,106 --> 01:01:16,194
pfft, you're out.

1304
01:01:16,237 --> 01:01:18,500
That's really--
it's very nice
of you.

1305
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:19,284
But i-I've--

1306
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:21,242
I've got to go
to this--

1307
01:01:21,286 --> 01:01:24,724
you're very busy
with many things.

1308
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:27,118
Look, um...

1309
01:01:28,206 --> 01:01:30,730
I mean, honestly,
what is it?

1310
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:34,081
If you just want
to sleep with me,

1311
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:35,300
I don't really think

1312
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:36,780
I'm worth
all the effort.

1313
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:38,259
And if
it's not that,

1314
01:01:38,303 --> 01:01:39,739
what is it
you can't resist,

1315
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,219
my sparkling
personality?

1316
01:01:41,262 --> 01:01:45,266
Actually, it's your
high self-esteem.

1317
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:46,833
No, it's--

1318
01:01:46,877 --> 01:01:48,052
it's not
an illicit offer.

1319
01:01:48,095 --> 01:01:50,619
I just--you could
have the couch.

1320
01:01:50,663 --> 01:01:53,231
You know, I'm no fun
at all these days.

1321
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:56,800
I mean, all I do
all day long is
think about Alan.

1322
01:01:56,843 --> 01:01:59,280
I'd be staying at
your place with you.

1323
01:01:59,324 --> 01:02:01,108
Mm-hmm.

1324
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,243
Is that what you want?

1325
01:02:28,353 --> 01:02:30,137
Danny.

1326
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:39,146
So, I guess
we're the big losers.

1327
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:39,973
No.

1328
01:02:40,017 --> 01:02:41,627
What else is
there to say?

1329
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:42,889
We're the big losers.

1330
01:02:42,933 --> 01:02:45,196
I think losers says
enough really.

1331
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:49,504
I don't think
we need to modify
it with big.

1332
01:02:49,548 --> 01:02:51,115
You know, this might
sound stupid,

1333
01:02:51,158 --> 01:02:55,162
but I used to think
that Amy was your
girlfriend, not Zoey.

1334
01:02:55,206 --> 01:02:56,163
Yeah?

1335
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:57,948
Yeah. I never
knew you that well.

1336
01:02:57,991 --> 01:03:00,820
And you and Amy always
seemed to be having
such a good time together.

1337
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:04,215
Then Alan said,
"no, his girlfriend's
the other one."

1338
01:03:04,258 --> 01:03:06,043
I guess I've had
friendships like that.

1339
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:08,088
Where people thought
we were sleeping together

1340
01:03:08,132 --> 01:03:09,176
and we weren't.

1341
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,439
Yeah, I've had
friendships
like that.

1342
01:03:11,483 --> 01:03:14,747
I've had
relationships
like that.

1343
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:20,274
We all want the ones
who are wrong for US,

1344
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:21,014
don't we?

1345
01:03:21,058 --> 01:03:22,146
I mean the good ones,

1346
01:03:22,189 --> 01:03:24,626
never even give
them a chance.

1347
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:25,845
Ok, come on,

1348
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:27,716
let's talk about
something else,
all right?

1349
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,241
We are 2 relatively
bright people

1350
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:32,373
with a fair amount
of things in common.

1351
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:35,072
Surely we can find
something else
to talk about

1352
01:03:35,115 --> 01:03:37,814
than our failing
relationships.
Am I right?

1353
01:03:37,857 --> 01:03:38,640
Yes.

1354
01:03:38,684 --> 01:03:39,641
You're right.Am I right?

1355
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:41,034
All right,
so let's not
even dwell

1356
01:03:41,078 --> 01:03:43,210
on how I never gave
Amy a chance, ok?

1357
01:03:43,254 --> 01:03:44,168
Oh, no, but
I didn't say that.

1358
01:03:44,211 --> 01:03:45,386
Yeah, you said,
"Amy was the one

1359
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:46,823
"that I never gave
a chance--"

1360
01:03:46,866 --> 01:03:50,087
no, I said
that we never give
the good ones a chance,

1361
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:51,740
not Amy.

1362
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,091
Oh.

1363
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:59,357
You're thinking about her
though, aren't you?

1364
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,707
Yeah, you are.

1365
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,101
[Laughs]

1366
01:05:33,364 --> 01:05:37,063
I think you're still
a little afraid of me.

1367
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:39,631
No, no, no, no,
mm-mmm.

1368
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:40,719
No, no, no?

1369
01:05:40,762 --> 01:05:41,546
Afraid?

1370
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:43,591
Nah, I wouldn't
say that.

1371
01:05:43,635 --> 01:05:44,505
No?

1372
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:46,290
Oh, I don't know.

1373
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:47,726
Ok, maybe still
a little.

1374
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:49,336
Well, anything's
an improvement over
that first time

1375
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:52,905
in my apartment
with that mad dash
for the door.

1376
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,211
Oh, god!

1377
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:56,039
Remember that pucker?

1378
01:05:56,082 --> 01:05:57,083
Come on.

1379
01:05:57,127 --> 01:05:58,998
And the shock that
that kind of stuff

1380
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,434
can still happen to me.

1381
01:06:00,478 --> 01:06:02,393
That drama, I mean.

1382
01:06:02,436 --> 01:06:06,527
I thought those days
were over for me.

1383
01:06:08,094 --> 01:06:08,834
Maybe not.

1384
01:06:08,877 --> 01:06:10,270
Maybe they never end.

1385
01:06:10,314 --> 01:06:14,274
Maybe somewhere in Florida
there's an 80-year-old woman

1386
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:15,841
running out of
my father's apartment.

1387
01:06:15,884 --> 01:06:19,540
Course she probably
doesn't move as quickly
as you do.

1388
01:06:19,584 --> 01:06:21,107
Yeah.

1389
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:26,460
So, you don't mind
me staying with you
this long?

1390
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:27,853
Yeah, I kind of do.

1391
01:06:27,896 --> 01:06:29,898
I have this thing
about, um,

1392
01:06:29,942 --> 01:06:35,165
sharing my bed with
a beautiful, young,
sweet woman.

1393
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:37,515
Seems kind of
wrong somehow.

1394
01:06:37,558 --> 01:06:40,257
Mmm, unnatural.

1395
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,388
Unnatural.

1396
01:06:41,432 --> 01:06:45,131
Well, that's what
I like best about it.

1397
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:55,968
I don't know what's
taking Tim so long.

1398
01:07:04,194 --> 01:07:06,109
I meant to call.

1399
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,720
I know it's no excuse.

1400
01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:11,070
But I've been
thinking about you.

1401
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:13,464
Daniel, it's fine.

1402
01:07:13,507 --> 01:07:15,205
Daniel?

1403
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:16,510
What's that?

1404
01:07:16,554 --> 01:07:20,297
You, uh, just
called me Daniel.

1405
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,082
You never call me Daniel.

1406
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:25,215
Danny.

1407
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:27,434
Daniel, Danny, ok?

1408
01:07:27,478 --> 01:07:30,089
You know,
I get the feeling
that you think

1409
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:33,310
that I'm waiting
for you to apologize
for something.

1410
01:07:33,353 --> 01:07:36,095
And it's not
the case.

1411
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:38,054
There's nothing to--

1412
01:07:38,097 --> 01:07:39,098
things are good
in my life.

1413
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:43,972
My research and Tim
and there's--

1414
01:07:44,016 --> 01:07:44,799
what?

1415
01:07:44,843 --> 01:07:47,106
Does that
disappoint you?

1416
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:48,368
That my life is--

1417
01:07:48,412 --> 01:07:50,153
that I'm not
angry at you?

1418
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:52,329
Are you disappointed
with that?

1419
01:07:52,372 --> 01:07:54,113
Yeah.

1420
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:56,115
Yeah, you are.

1421
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:57,334
No.

1422
01:07:57,377 --> 01:07:58,248
Uh, no.

1423
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:00,511
I meant no.

1424
01:08:00,554 --> 01:08:01,816
Look, all right,

1425
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,515
I might as well
just say it.

1426
01:08:04,558 --> 01:08:09,128
Um, and I wish I had
known this months ago.

1427
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:10,521
But...

1428
01:08:10,564 --> 01:08:14,960
I think we should
give it a shot with US.

1429
01:08:15,003 --> 01:08:18,529
Give it a shot
with US.

1430
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:20,531
Yeah.

1431
01:08:20,574 --> 01:08:22,315
Give it--
is that the--

1432
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:23,664
give it a shot
with US?

1433
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,797
Is that something
they say from
the school yard?

1434
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,104
I mean, I don't hear
from you for months.

1435
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:28,930
And then suddenly--

1436
01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:30,149
I know, I know,
I blew it.

1437
01:08:30,193 --> 01:08:31,455
Are you so used
to getting
what you want,

1438
01:08:31,498 --> 01:08:33,283
that you think
that the feelings
of others

1439
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:34,371
can be disregarded?

1440
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,155
I handled it badly.
Tim is my friend.

1441
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:38,592
And I admit it confuses
the situation.

1442
01:08:38,636 --> 01:08:41,813
But I am trying
to tell you,

1443
01:08:41,856 --> 01:08:43,728

Do you--

1447
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:55,522
do you still feel
the same way about me

1448
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:58,743
that you did or...

1449
01:09:00,397 --> 01:09:03,269
Hey, can you--

1450
01:09:03,313 --> 01:09:06,011
can you look at me?

1451
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:11,451
I mean,
I'm asking you if--

1452
01:09:11,495 --> 01:09:13,061
if you still feel--

1453
01:09:13,105 --> 01:09:14,324
my life's going well.

1454
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:17,457

Ah, a jerk.

1547
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:51,584

1548
01:12:51,628 --> 01:12:54,935
I think a girl like you
would like a jerk.

1549
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:56,502
No, I don't like jerks.

No, I think you do
like jerks.

1551
01:12:58,722 --> 01:13:03,814
Because jerks make you
feel things, right?

1552
01:13:03,857 --> 01:13:06,077
Jerks make you want.

01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,558
And in the bedroom, right?

1554
01:13:08,601 --> 01:13:11,212
I mean, no comparison.

1555
01:13:11,256 --> 01:13:14,868
Did you ever
fuck a nice boy?

1556
01:13:14,912 --> 01:13:16,479
Come on, this is a game.

1557
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:19,046
Did you ever
fuck a nice boy?

1558
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,091
Maybe.

1559
01:13:20,134 --> 01:13:21,222
Ah, well, you see,
that's exactly it.

1560
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:22,920
You fuck a nice boy.

1561
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:25,749
You get fucked by a jerk.

1562
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:28,186
You lay back
with a nice boy.

1563
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:33,191
You think,
"this guy's going to
love me when I'm 40."

1564
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:34,366
And 20 minutes later,

1565
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:38,196
you're coming
station wagons

1566
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,024
and p.T.A. Meetings

1567
01:13:40,067 --> 01:13:41,068
and I.R.A. Accounts.

1568
01:13:41,112 --> 01:13:43,462
Which is like
not coming at all.

1569
01:13:43,506 --> 01:13:46,073
But with a jerk...

1570
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:50,687
You're not sure what
you're allowed to have.

1571
01:13:51,296 --> 01:13:54,212
You want him to see it
differently.

1572
01:13:54,255 --> 01:13:57,345
You know, not like
you see yourself.

1573
01:13:57,389 --> 01:14:01,262
Not like how you know
you are: Weak and ordinary.

1574
01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:05,615
But strong, capable.

1575
01:14:05,658 --> 01:14:08,139
So, you hold it in.

1576
01:14:08,182 --> 01:14:12,273
And it's got to force
its way out.

1577
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,233
And when it does--

1578
01:14:15,276 --> 01:14:20,978
and when it does
force its way out,

1579
01:14:21,021 --> 01:14:23,067
it feels...

1580
01:14:25,286 --> 01:14:28,159
How does it feel?

1581
01:14:28,551 --> 01:14:30,248
How does it feel?

1582
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:31,075
Good.

1583
01:14:31,118 --> 01:14:33,599
No, no, no,
it feels...

1584
01:14:33,643 --> 01:14:34,731
Very good.

1585
01:14:34,774 --> 01:14:36,341
Very good because
you're getting fucked.

1586
01:14:36,384 --> 01:14:38,648
And all your
worldly concerns,

1587
01:14:38,691 --> 01:14:42,086
all your ideals are
reduced to this moment,

1588
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:43,391
to this feeling,

1589
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:47,178
to this power that could
swallow up all the boys

1590
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:48,135
in math club.

1591
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:51,051
And you say to your god,
you say,

1592
01:14:51,095 --> 01:14:53,053
"thank you, god.

1593
01:14:53,097 --> 01:14:55,969
"Thank you for
giving me a pussy.

1594
01:14:56,013 --> 01:15:00,017
"Thank you for filling
this hole between my legs.

1595
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:04,195
"Thank you for letting me
feel this.

1596
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:06,023
"Thank you.

1597
01:15:06,066 --> 01:15:08,155
"Thank you.

1598
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:10,244
Thank you."

1599
01:15:10,288 --> 01:15:11,202
[Whispering]
God.

1600
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:12,812
You want to
do something?

1601
01:15:12,856 --> 01:15:14,074
Do I want to
do something?

1602
01:15:14,118 --> 01:15:16,120
Of course I want
to do something.

1603
01:15:16,163 --> 01:15:18,514
We could
go someplace.

1604
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:19,950
Well, we could.

1605
01:15:19,993 --> 01:15:22,169
But what about Jackson?

1606
01:15:22,213 --> 01:15:23,301
Who?

1607
01:15:23,344 --> 01:15:26,086
Hmm, we don't want
to hurt him like that.

1608
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:29,046
Uh, we see other
people and stuff.

1609
01:15:29,089 --> 01:15:30,047
Ah.

1610
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:31,309
Well, you see,

1611
01:15:31,352 --> 01:15:35,226
my girlfriend and I,
we don't see other people

1612
01:15:35,269 --> 01:15:36,488
or stuff.

1613
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:37,837
That's a shame.

1614
01:15:37,881 --> 01:15:40,536
I know it's very inconvenient
at times like this.

1615
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:41,928
Oh, she left.

1616
01:15:41,972 --> 01:15:44,061
She's not here
anymore.

1617
01:15:44,931 --> 01:15:46,672
What?

1618
01:15:49,936 --> 01:15:51,372
Fuck.

1619
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:53,113
Why the fuck didn't
you say something?

1620
01:15:53,157 --> 01:15:54,593
I didn't know.
Was I supposed to?

1621
01:15:54,637 --> 01:15:56,029
Fuck! Goddamn!
She wouldn't say a word

1622
01:15:56,073 --> 01:15:58,771
if I fucked you
right here. Fuck!

1623
01:16:05,517 --> 01:16:07,127
Where did she go?

1624
01:16:07,171 --> 01:16:08,259
Can we help you?

1625
01:16:08,302 --> 01:16:09,739
Yeah, where
did she go?

1626
01:16:09,782 --> 01:16:11,871
The girl you were
talking to.

1627
01:16:11,915 --> 01:16:12,611
Brad?

1628
01:16:12,655 --> 01:16:13,743
What girl,
just before?

1629
01:16:13,786 --> 01:16:14,700
Yeah, where'd she go?

1630
01:16:14,744 --> 01:16:16,006
I don't know.
She left, I think.

1631
01:16:16,049 --> 01:16:17,398
She left?

1632
01:16:17,442 --> 01:16:19,052
She left?!

1633
01:16:19,096 --> 01:16:20,663
Fuck!

1634
01:16:23,535 --> 01:16:25,058
Are you leaving?

1635
01:16:25,102 --> 01:16:27,278
Which way
the fuck--fuck!

1636
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:30,063
Jesus fucking
Christ.

1637
01:16:30,977 --> 01:16:32,936
What the fuck
are you doing?

1638
01:16:32,979 --> 01:16:33,806
Let go of me.

1639
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:34,938
Where are you going?

1640
01:16:34,981 --> 01:16:36,461
You just walk out
like that, just leave?

1641
01:16:36,504 --> 01:16:37,593
Let go of my arm.

1642
01:16:37,636 --> 01:16:39,116
What the fuck is this?
You just walk out?

1643
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:40,247
Yes, I walk out.

1644
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:42,075
But you arrived someplace
with someone,

1645
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:44,121
not just someone,
and you leave them there.

1646
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:45,122
You just leave them
like that.

1647
01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:47,037
Hey, don't walk
away from me.

1648
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,038
I'm talking to you.

1649
01:16:48,081 --> 01:16:48,952
I'm fucking talking.

1650
01:16:48,995 --> 01:16:49,996
Will you fucking
listen to me?

1651
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,650
Let go of me.I'm talking to you!

1652
01:16:51,694 --> 01:16:53,173
Fucking hitting me now?
Is that it?

1653
01:16:53,217 --> 01:16:54,653
All of a sudden
you're getting angry?

1654
01:16:54,697 --> 01:16:56,524
You're showing emotion
all of a sudden?

1655
01:16:56,568 --> 01:16:58,004
Oh, I made you
feel something.

1656
01:16:58,048 --> 01:16:59,179
Isn't that
fucking amazing?

1657
01:16:59,223 --> 01:17:01,617
You're so fucked up,
incredibly fucked up!

1658
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,183
You're the one who
fucking walks out

1659
01:17:03,227 --> 01:17:04,794
and doesn't tell someone
they're leaving.
That's fucked up.

1660
01:17:04,837 --> 01:17:06,317
You want to talk
about fucked up?

1661
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,188
You were going to let me
fuck that girl.

1662
01:17:08,232 --> 01:17:09,059
What girl?

1663
01:17:09,102 --> 01:17:10,190
Inside, the one
I was talk--

1664
01:17:10,234 --> 01:17:12,018
what girl? You saw me
talking to her.

1665
01:17:12,062 --> 01:17:13,019
And you walked away.

1666
01:17:13,063 --> 01:17:14,107
You were going to
let me fuck her.

1667
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:15,108
You weren't going
to fuck her.

1668
01:17:15,152 --> 01:17:16,849
I could've.
She wanted me to.

1669
01:17:16,893 --> 01:17:18,721
She wanted me.
And you walked away.

1670
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:19,896
You weren't going
to touch her.

1671
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:21,245
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1672
01:17:21,288 --> 01:17:22,681
She wanted me.
She loved wanting me.

1673
01:17:22,725 --> 01:17:24,944
And she was fucking wet
when I walked away.

1674
01:17:24,988 --> 01:17:26,554
You weren't going to do
anything with her.

1675
01:17:26,598 --> 01:17:32,691
You'd have been bored
with her before
you got her dress off.

1676
01:17:36,303 --> 01:17:39,698
Look what you fucking
did to my life.

1677
01:17:39,742 --> 01:17:42,701
I mean this isn't me.

1678
01:17:42,745 --> 01:17:44,050
This isn't me here.

1679
01:17:44,094 --> 01:17:46,662
This is your creation.

1680
01:17:47,706 --> 01:17:51,101
I used to be somebody else.

1681
01:17:53,581 --> 01:17:57,063
I'm a fucking
drunk now, too.

1682
01:18:10,076 --> 01:18:14,428
You shouldn't have
left without me.

1683
01:18:25,222 --> 01:18:29,182
Tim: So, who can
we fix Danny up with?

1684
01:18:29,226 --> 01:18:30,444
Amy?

1685
01:18:30,488 --> 01:18:31,750
Hmm?

1686
01:18:31,794 --> 01:18:33,273
What friends of yours
can we fix Danny up with?

1687
01:18:33,317 --> 01:18:34,231
Tim, it's
unnecessary.

1688
01:18:34,274 --> 01:18:37,321
No, we want to return
the favor.

1689
01:18:37,364 --> 01:18:39,279
Amy?

1690
01:18:39,323 --> 01:18:40,759
I--i don't know.

1691
01:18:40,803 --> 01:18:43,457
Well, you see
the problem is

1692
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:44,502
you're too picky.

1693
01:18:44,545 --> 01:18:46,983
You know, and all
the women you like

1694
01:18:47,026 --> 01:18:48,941
are with much cooler
guys than you.

1695
01:18:48,985 --> 01:18:50,073
Thank you,
thank you.

1696
01:18:50,116 --> 01:18:51,422
No, no, it's true.

1697
01:18:51,465 --> 01:18:53,424
Since you started selling
magazines for a living,

1698
01:18:53,467 --> 01:18:55,339
you've got to lower
your standards.

1699
01:18:55,382 --> 01:18:58,429
You know, those beautiful,
mysterious writer types

1700
01:18:58,472 --> 01:18:59,952
you like so much,

1701
01:18:59,996 --> 01:19:02,607
well, they're just not
big on guys who sell swank.

1702
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,522
That's where
you're wrong.

1703
01:19:04,565 --> 01:19:05,566
No, no, no.

1704
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:06,959
You've got to broaden
your horizons.

1705
01:19:07,003 --> 01:19:10,136
Maybe start
considering the aged,

1706
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:12,443
crippled, maybe men.

1707
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:14,097
No, no,
think about it: Guys.

1708
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:15,402
There's an upside,
you see.

1709
01:19:15,446 --> 01:19:17,753
Because if it doesn't
work out with a woman,

1710
01:19:17,796 --> 01:19:19,319
it's depressing,
tragic even.

1711
01:19:19,363 --> 01:19:21,974
But if it doesn't
work out with a guy,

1712
01:19:22,018 --> 01:19:24,585
you know, big deal,
it's just Jim.

1713
01:19:24,629 --> 01:19:25,761
Jim doesn't like me.

1714
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:27,327
There's no one
to set him up with.

1715
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:28,546
So, it's just stupid.

1716
01:19:28,589 --> 01:19:29,808
We must know
somebody--

1717
01:19:29,852 --> 01:19:31,070
no, if you actually
knew somebody,
then fine.

1718
01:19:31,114 --> 01:19:32,680
But otherwise it's just
chatter, it's nothing.

1719
01:19:32,724 --> 01:19:35,596
Tim: What are you getting
so upset about?

1720
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,469
♪ Don't ask me
about love...♪

1721
01:19:38,512 --> 01:19:41,124
Hey, come on, Timmy,
people are dancing.

1722
01:19:41,167 --> 01:19:42,125
Let's dance.

1723
01:19:42,168 --> 01:19:43,822
No, you know
I don't like to dance.

1724
01:19:43,866 --> 01:19:45,215
Come on,
it'll be great.

1725
01:19:45,258 --> 01:19:46,172
Just one.

1726
01:19:46,216 --> 01:19:47,173

to see you.

1913
01:28:10,241 --> 01:28:12,591
