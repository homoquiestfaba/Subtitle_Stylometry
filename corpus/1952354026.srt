"And the sea gave up the dead
who were in it;

00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:33,969
and death and hell delivered
those who were in them;

00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,297
and they were judged every man
in accordance with their deeds. "

LOCATION: IRAQ

00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,381
This all sucks.

8
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:01,180
Can not wait to go back
to Arizona, my,

9
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,219
which is cool.
Jesus, but what the heck?

10
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:06,797
What was that?

11
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:07,804
It came from inside?

12
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:09,601
Can not see, and you,
can you see anything?

13
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:13,814
Let me check your windows.
What ...?!

14
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:18,157
What is he doing?

15
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:22,633
Something is not right, man.
I'm not like this.

16
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:27,338
SUBSTANCE CONTAGIOUS

17
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,747
Stop the vehicle!

18
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,953
Captain Hall?
Captain Hall!

19
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:40,166
Calm down, sir.

20
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:43,962
What's he got?

21
00:02:44,218 --> 00:02:47,302
We must leave here now.

22
00:02:48,263 --> 00:02:50,137
What we have here, Stanf?

23
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:51,965
Some kind of medicine.

24
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:55,426
I told them that my research was not
completed. You do not do a thing like this ...

25
00:02:55,432 --> 00:02:56,792
and hopes to have good results.

26
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:01,772
Is marked "Biohazard."
We have a security breach.

27
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:07,104
I'll just say once Captain Hall,
turn off the vehicle and exit.

28
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:09,856
Shit!

29
00:04:13,677 --> 00:04:18,220
E V I L U T I O N

30
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:30,599
Home sweet home.

00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:40,691
RENT-SE.
TALK with the landlord.

32
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:51,085
Darren Tyler. Welcome
to Nekropoliten. This way.

33
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:03,307
How old is this building?

34
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:08,701
Nobody really knows. Documents
originals have been lost for many years.

35
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:13,640
Some say this building
just appeared one day ...

36
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:16,377
at some time near the
World War II.

37
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:18,105
Someone had to build it.

38
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:20,321
You think?

39
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:42,206
Oh, just one floor to sink.

40th
00:05:46,354 --> 00:05:51,853
Beware of the bodies.
I'm not kidding.

41
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,963
Yes I am.

42
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,314
Good night, Madeline.

43
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:02,394
Sorry.
Sorry.

44
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:05,645
Let me introduce you to Darren Tyler.
A new tenant.

45
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:06,572
I'm Maddie.

46
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,055
Nice to meet you.

47
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,631
And by the way, the machine
Washing is spoiled another see.

48
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,698
As the elevator.

49
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,996
What a novelty.
Welcome to the neighborhood, Mr. Tyler.

50
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,966
Good woman.
Having problems with men.

51
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:25,026
If you do not mind me asking,
what to do in life, Mr. Tyler?

52
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,626
I'ma science teacher.
The school of "Layden.

53
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,760
This explains the need
of affordable housing.

54
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,727
Children ... What can you do?

55
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:46,361
That does not make them evil?

56
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:50,071
You're funny.
You'll adjust you right here.

57
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:52,199
We are near the laundry?

58
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:55,488
Actually, no. Ah, thou
referes to the smell? It is chlorine.

59
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:58,237
This part of the building was built
within a pool.

60
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:03,249
Obviously left chemicals
back. As the wall of your apartment.

61
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:04,867
Fantastic.

62
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:10,337
The smell is stronger on some days than
in others. You will get used.

63
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:26,816
Sorry for that. I know it is
hard to believe but ...

64
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:30,404
we are having some problems
with electricity.

65
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,449
Probably not what
you're accustomed to.

66
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:37,533
No, it's bigger than I thought.

67
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:45,918
Then it will just be you? Neither Mrs. Tyler,
do not mind if I ask?

68
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,910
No, just me. I think it's
my fate to live alone.

69
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,165
As the poem
old sailor.

70
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:53,420
What did you say?

71
00:07:54,093 --> 00:08:00,411
You know the poem about a sailor,
kills an albatross a bird of prophecy.

72
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:03,176
And it is cursed and forced to
use the bird around the neck,

73
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:05,511
as a reminder of what he did.

74
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,408
"There will come a day when Mal
look in the eyes ...

75
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:10,014
young and old.

76
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,685
Instead of a cross, the albatross that
is hanging on my chest. "

77
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:15,895
I do not understand.

78
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,991
Everyone on the ship die except him.
It is his curse.

79
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:27,645
Being the master of the "ship of death".
It must be awful to live with such a burden.

80th
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:31,947
Hiding from humanity because
a mistake in the past.

81
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:34,576
I'll have to read this poem
one day.

82
00:08:35,294 --> 00:08:37,937
Well, I'm not going to do
lose more time.

83
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:40,644
The rent is charged on the first
day of the month. Cash.

84
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,932
Closing the doors at sunset
to keep out unwanted ...

85
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,998
So, are you sure you do not
forget to use the keys.

86
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,261
And our other problems?

87
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:54,014
You have one lock.
I suggest that the uses.

88
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:57,478
Good to have you with us, Mr. Tyler.

89
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:31,091
Lamps replaced.
LOCK YOUR DOOR!

90
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:50,554
Do you want to kiss or something
similar. What's that?

91
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:52,155
Stop it, I do not
like to share.

92
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,023
Do not you like to share?

93
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:55,310
They all share something!

94
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:58,478
It's the first thing you learn in the garden
childhood. Share the toys.

95
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,216
Can lower a bit?

96
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,556
Hey, whitey, what you think
are you doing playing on my radio?

97
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,302
Sorry, man, but it's late
too much and was trying to sleep.

98
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:24,870
Really? This is a beautiful story,
but why not increase the radio?

99
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:35,491
What a beautiful girl.
Now get out of here.

100
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:46,754
Let not this the
prevents them from dancing.

101
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,866
Delivery to Darren Tyler!

102
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:23,196
Wait! Shit!
Coming!

103
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,670
Hey, wait, I'm here!

104
00:11:31,672 --> 00:11:33,547
As if he had any day.

105
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,341
Thanks for waiting.

106
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:37,003
Have a nice day.

107th
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:42,346
Who was that
commissioned the honky naked?

108
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:46,348
Yes .. Hello!
We know each other last night ...

109
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:48,643
Who are you talking about,
vanilla pudding?

110
00:11:48,897 --> 00:11:51,388
Hey, man. He is calm.

111
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:53,918
Just swallow.
We had this block.

112
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:56,623
And since we do not like you, bitch.

113
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:57,926
Sorry.

114
00:11:57,927 --> 00:11:59,889
Just so you remember, man.

115
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,079
This is the "Random", it is
one killer in the street.

116
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,310
Call me "Killer Bee" because
my heart is wrapped in poison.

117
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:12,828
And that crazy shit there
is the "Mark Asia."

118
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:18,273
He shat in the body of an enemy in
his funeral. Just because it is crazy.

119
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:21,675
He kills you and then kills again
just so we can watch.

120
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,924
Understand:
Matador, Poisonous, Crazy.

121
00:12:25,223 --> 00:12:31,177
Hey, what's going on? Curtis, Steve, Ben?
They are bothering you?

122
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:32,937
Stay out, sister.

123
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:35,762
Wow, talk about bad for a
type who cried ...

124
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:37,849
watch a movie with me
last week.

125
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:40,081
Why do you have to do that, man?

126
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:43,734
You can not decide the
color of your pants?

127
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:45,480
It's true ...

128
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:46,490
Let's get outta here.

129
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:49,735
- Bitch!
- Hey, hey, hey!

130
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,364
Sorry.

131
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,740
Thanks, Maddie.

132
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:57,164
Anything ...

133
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,878
Darren.

134
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:00,547
Darren, ok.

135
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:04,087
Thank you.

136
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:08,050
Smell of cleanliness.

137
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:09,170
What?

138
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,303
The chlorine.

139
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:16,061
I've got used to it.
Well, thanks for the help.

140
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:19,357
I can not believe someone
going to live down here.

141
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:21,891
This place really chills me.

142
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,693
Not so bad.

143
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:32,779
Transmits some vibration ... of the past.
Many bad things happened here.

144
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:35,955
You will be the committee
welcome.

145
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:41,258
Look, sorry. Obviously you and
mice have been working here ...

146
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:44,385
then why not follow me
a dinner tonight.

147
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:47,548
E. ..
whether you want you can wear pants.

148
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:50,995
- You are very kind but ...
- Ok See you at 6:00.

149
00:14:38,056 --> 00:14:39,550
Coming!
Wait a minute!

150
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:40,839
Oh, shit!

151
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:43,427
Hello

152
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:44,351
Hello

153
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:47,851
Dressed to impress.
Seem desperate ...

154
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:49,021
Yes.

155
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,270
You came empty handed?

156
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:53,225
Hmm .. excuse.

157
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:55,610
I'm kidding.

Good morning, sir!
Sgt Kollins, at your service.

161
00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:17,670
At ease, sergeant.

162

What are you doing here still?
We have to evacuate the area immediately.

168
00:16:53,725 --> 00:17:00,319
Ah, now I understand. You are here to document
our failure. This is your job, son?

169
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:05,642
Of course it is. And you liked
our "army of the dead"?

170

What? All you dreamed?
Son of a bitch.

Let me tell you this.
They are learning, adapting.

172
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:35,620
Can never be controlled. Are
recreate themselves, from bottom to top.

173
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:39,159
Soon they will be like us or
we will become like them.

174
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,332
Anyway, this is the next
step in the evolution of the human race.

175
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,735
Not the end, son.
Not even close.

176
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:58,736
This is a good beginning
for all humanity.

177
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,954
Can not be held. They live.
Are you listening? Live!

178
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:21,557
It's no suicide bomber who
was communicated to the media, do you?

179
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,889
All history has
both sides, Gabriel.

180
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,342
Always two sides, sir.

181
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,145
This scientist ...
a crazy motherfucker.

182
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:37,459
This nigga could well have started
hell on earth. Take a look.

183
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:38,189
Yes, sir.

184
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:57,071
- The report says that everything was destroyed.
- It was what we thought.

185
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:59,756
Until we receive the report,
identifying what is left.

186
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:03,345
Were all arrested, except
Captain Darren Hall.

187
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:05,846
Tyler would be the assistant?

188
00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:07,892
Exactly.

189
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:10,842
Any clues?

190
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:14,805
Last page. Recently took
money from an electronic box.

191
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:18,218
I do not understand. By simply
do not hold this kind?

192
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:23,782
We do not know the purpose of it.
And do not scare him now.

193
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:25,993
The result could be catastrophic.

194
00:19:26,244 --> 00:19:27,524
He's just a man.

195
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:33,832
Not the man who worries me.
It is what it has.

196
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:37,751
Gabriel?

197
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:39,078
Yes, sir?

198
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:43,846
I need a man with skills
Special to complete this mission.

199
00:19:45,596 --> 00:19:47,553
Cirurgicalmente accurate
if you will.

200
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:49,289
Are you saying what I
I think you're saying?

201
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:52,018
This is serious business,
thou understand?

202
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:56,564
I understand.
Never disappoint you, sir.

203
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:03,651
Good man. Has already received orders.
Will leave tomorrow morning. I suggest you start reading.

204
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:06,272
- I'll be in touch.
- Yes, sir!

205
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:10,400
Sgt.

206
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:12,240
Yes, Colonel?

207
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:17,117
Fast and strong.
Nothing can bazaar.

208
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:20,583
So do we
work, is not you?

209
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,070
You're probably asking yourself what a
nice girl like me doing in a place like this.

210
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:33,045
Actually, he was asking me how
you handle those wacky gangsters.

211
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:39,034
Who? Those types of before? They
arm themselves in strong, but ... are not.

212
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:43,607
Cook for them and they protect me.
My mother always said:

213
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:47,476
"The way to win the heart of a
man is through the stomach. "

214
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:51,362
Why are you in such a place?

215
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:53,775
Am I hide.

216
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:54,907
Of what?

217
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:58,831
Of life. I got tired of the vicious circle.
After my divorce ...

218th
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:03,576
I decided see what was "out there"
and did not like what I found.

219
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,631
And here I am ... to expect the
prince charming to call me.

220
00:21:08,924 --> 00:21:11,082
They still meet at home?

221
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:13,834
All my friends say:
"Madi, forget television,

222
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:17,609
and dating back ... but for some
reason, my TV ...

223
00:21:17,614 --> 00:21:20,006
seems to be much more reliable.

224
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,822
A toast to that.

225
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:27,687
Then science teacher ...
What made you choose this path?

226
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:34,072
When I was 15, was
late back to school

227
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:38,473
And storm fell.
He was crossing a field ...

228
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:45,208
And that lightning came, it was amazing.
I was struck with such power and beauty.

229
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:50,344
From that moment I knew
should there be a God watching over us.

230
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:58,626
So when was that
lost his faith in God?

231
00:21:57,928 --> 00:22:01,049
And who was it who said
that I lost faith?

232
00:22:06,228 --> 00:22:10,271
When my mother died.
She was well e. ..

233
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:13,151
suddenly died.

234
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:17,070
My father said it was a heart attack,
but I looked at his autopsy ...

235
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,271
and found that it was a suicide ...

236
00:22:21,534 --> 00:22:23,393
And then you came to
medical university?

237
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:27,557
Actually, I was fortunate to work
with research for the Army.

238
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,286
Was in the army?

239
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:33,585
What a fascinating life had
in such a short time.

240
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:36,235
Oh, come on, we almost
the same age.

241
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:39,905
But my greatest achievement
is to program the television.

242
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:41,457
And that's something.

243
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:43,496
Program it herself.

244
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:47,306
I'm kidding.
It was a joke.

245
00:22:47,892 --> 00:22:56,363
- Very funny ...
- It even has sad eyes.

246
00:22:57,234 --> 00:23:03,860
You know, I have an apartment to clean up.
I really gotta go.

247
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:06,235
Okay.

248
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,531
Thank you.
I had fun.

249
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:19,671
Hey, maybe we can mix our
clothes in the laundry one day.

250
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:23,421
If the smell of chlorine does not get you.

251
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:27,257
This was very good, Madeleine.

252
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:59,832
Bitches love men in uniform.
I'll get some real pussy.

253rd
00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:02,982
That's right, man. And here
will render us good money.

254
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,122
Hey, man. Perhaps it is better not to sell.
We need this.

255
00:24:07,342 --> 00:24:10,329
No, man. Do not want to be caught
with no gun stolen.

256
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:12,670
We have to sell that shit fast.

257
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:19,509
Okay, guys, it was very funny.
Give me back.

258
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,511
Return what?

259
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:23,351
The uniform he is wearing and the weapon.

260
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:24,936
We find that here.

261
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:26,651
Yes, in my apartment.

262
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,405
And then? There used to be our
place before you come and take.

263
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:32,772
You not staying in the building?

264th
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:34,325
That means nothing.

265
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,870
I do not mind the uniforms, just give me
the weapon before anyone gets hurt.

266
00:24:37,871 --> 00:24:40,388
I told you not
We have no weapons.

267
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:44,325
Why don
of our front, soldier?

268
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:48,038
I'm not leaving without the gun.

269
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:52,340
So, I guess you are not going to leave.

270
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:57,801
How about, man? We have a problem?
You ripped off his uniform or not?

271
00:24:58,056 --> 00:24:59,254
A gun also.

272
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:04,557
Really? He stole your gun?
Really? Stole or not?

273
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:10,876
I do not know what he is talking about, random.
The guy is crazy in the head or something.

274
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,225
Ok ok.

275
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:14,111
Give me the damn gun!

276
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:19,224
Hey, better cool it, whitey. This is the
wrong thing to do here. Understand?

277
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:22,114
Mess with my staff is
mess with my family.

278
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:25,407
And you will not want to mess with my
family, ok? I kill you, man.

279
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,166
Did you hear?

280
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:29,042
Hey, Entrages him the uniform!

281
00:25:29,252 --> 00:25:30,118
Sorry, man.

282
00:25:30,378 --> 00:25:36,297
Stop playing.
And you stand there with a bad guy.

283
00:25:36,676 --> 00:25:38,882
Here's your fantasy, soldier.

284
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:42,963
Toma and leaves.
Fast.

285
00:25:43,981 --> 00:25:46,512
That's right.

286
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,054
People like that are
ruining the neighborhood.

287
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:54,810
Hey, man, enough!
What's your problem, man?

288
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,978
What you took?
That's what I'm talking about, man.

289
00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:02,442
My soldiers,
my soldiers.

290
00:26:03,701 --> 00:26:05,908
Those idiots are
causing problems?

291
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:08,285
They just broke into my apartment
and stole some things.

292
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:11,291
You can not invade this place.
You must let him open again.

293
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,429
Must be aware of this, Mr. Tyler.

294
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:16,536
It seems to be an intelligent man.

295
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:20,577
Why not put your brain to work this
from time to time and remember to lock the door?

296
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:24,795
It is good sometimes encourages it.
That's your uniform?

297
00:26:25,096 --> 00:26:29,215
No, it's a friend of mine. He died in Iraq.
I keep it as souvenir.

298
00:26:30,518 --> 00:26:33,094
You served in Iraq?

299
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:38,399
There were many souls who have managed
back there. She was lucky.

300
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,921
I think so.
Good night.

301
00:27:10,931 --> 00:27:11,549
Sold?

302
00:27:13,183 --> 00:27:15,580
That's right.

303
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:25,757
I'll say this. Why
girls do not divide it among themselves?

304
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,153
That's right, girl.

305
00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:39,336
What is the Random, man?

306
00:27:39,706 --> 00:27:44,753
Caught it.
We use two weapons.

307
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:46,493
I have no gun, man!

308
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:50,882
As if giving a gun to
a crazy shit like you ...

309
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:55,843
Who needs guns
when you have it here?

310
00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:25,073
- Hey, man, you got some change?
- Sorry, no.

311
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,000
No matter.
I'll get something to eat.

312
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,918
What these bags have?
Apples?

313
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:36,083
They make me ill.

314
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:38,225
Is someone after you?

315
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:42,278
Me too.
I worked at Area 51.

316
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:48,174
It's all true. Very strange things.
Maybe some broccoli.

317
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:55,446
Fruit pies. And a bunch of support
athletic male. I'll eat this here.

318
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:58,126
It's always good to accommodate tomatoes
when trying to sleep.

319
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:03,266
Good And you can go,
the type is all gone.

320
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:24,508
Nobody loves you, does it?

321
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:27,272
No, but it is not news
signal that all is well.

322
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:30,315
Hmm .. is over my
Stock of cliches.

323
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:32,388
Yes, mine too ...

324
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,770
Shit, Curtis! You're bleeding!
Darren, help me!

325
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:37,013
Can I help?

326
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,000
Yes Take me to the shit
my room, my!

327
00:29:41,002 --> 00:29:42,178
You need not go
to room

328
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:43,390
precise point, I can
give them in my apartment.

329
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,575
Let me help you.

330
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:45,598
Get away from me, shit!

331
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:48,745
- Fuck off, fuck!
- It's okay, do I resolve this.

332
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:51,035
What do you want?
You are some kind of crazy?

333
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:53,577
I am a doctor, come on
I can heal.

334
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:57,243
Get off of me ...

335
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:04,625
I assume that they are not
good news, Sgt.

336
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,659
The liquidator says that he
is not to live there.

337
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,640
Probably trying to protect him.
But are you sure he's there, right?

338
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,339
No, he's here. The number of
weapon that police officers brought ...

339
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:16,138
coincides with what
was used in Iraq.

340
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,170
This is taking too long, Collins.

341
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,622
So I find it to
situation will be resolved.

342
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,107
Do we need another event
terrorist fix this?

343
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,898
Not required.

344
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,115
Ok But I want it resolved
tonight. Understand?

345
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,398
Yes, sir.

346
00:30:29,618 --> 00:30:30,536
Tonight.

347
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,906
Yes, sir.

348
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:42,789
Soldier!
Get this bush here!

349
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:13,653
Hey, Doc. I noticed that has many
junk in the apartment.

350
00:31:13,743 --> 00:31:16,697
This is really happening?
Crack are you doing? Stone?

351
00:31:16,996 --> 00:31:18,656
Research.

352
00:31:19,081 --> 00:31:25,066
Search? Ok You know, I am
the branch of pharmacy of street ...

353
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:28,455
why do not you let me help
with distribution ...

354
00:31:28,674 --> 00:31:30,982
At the end of the day is it
that counts, right?

355
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:33,549
You have many scars.

356
00:31:34,096 --> 00:31:39,928
Yes Let's say people do not always
agree with me when I'm right.

357
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:52,880
It's your shirt? I'll have to use that shit up there?
Well, I think that should serve as yet.

358
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:57,555
Not my brand
unique, but realize it.

359
00:31:57,701 --> 00:31:59,741
Sorry.

360
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:09,459
You are very good, man.
Okay.

361
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:15,204
Random, I need to ask a question.
Why this gangster life?

362
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:20,004
We all want to fit in, okay?

363
00:32:20,264 --> 00:32:22,221
There can be a form of fraternal?

364
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:27,013
Let me explain something, man.

365
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,657
Everything revolves because of money.
If you had money ...

366
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,033
you would not be in this place, do you?

367
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:46,951
So, all major
achievements of humanity ...

368
00:32:46,952 --> 00:32:48,957
can be summarized as
who has more money?

369
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:54,663
That's right. The money was before
and we will continue to exist after us.

370
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,644
I'll tell you one thing, Doctor.
The money keeps the world turning.

371
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,043
Money is the true
meaning of life.

372
00:33:04,264 --> 00:33:05,509
This is not true.

373
00:33:05,765 --> 00:33:09,258
Let me decide what is
true or not.

374
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:17,416
But I'll tell you this, the
I consider this the points ...

375
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:23,067
forget our past.
That's right.

376
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:31,487
I like you, doctor.
Beats here. Bate, my.

377
00:33:32,523 --> 00:33:38,245
Not mine, it hits harder!
You are a man or a bitch?

378
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,394
That, girl.

379
00:33:47,408 --> 00:33:50,390
Around here some days for
to take a look at these points.

380
00:33:57,314 --> 00:34:02,713
No, Random. The meaning of life
is the answer to death.

381
00:34:35,224 --> 00:34:39,637
If I could explain the
difference between friendship and grief.

382
00:34:57,412 --> 00:34:59,488
This will hurt a bit.

383
00:35:17,264 --> 00:35:20,467
That's right, buddy.

384
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:47,698
If only you could speak ...

385
00:38:39,162 --> 00:38:44,405
I am! I am! Easy!

386
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:51,497
Random! Your body is
to adapt, right? Relax!

387
00:38:54,677 --> 00:39:01,279
I'm with you, okay? Relax!
Lie down. Rests.

388
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:05,218
I'm with you, Random.
Lie down.

389
00:39:08,732 --> 00:39:10,765
I'm with you.

390
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:17,401
Come on, Random! Stay with me!

391
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,069
Come, relax.
Relaxes. Relax.

392
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:30,824
Anyway. Stay with me, man.
Ok? Stay with me.

393
00:39:31,462 --> 00:39:37,001
Stay with me, stay with me.
Come on. Come on.

394
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:52,433
As a man, ok?
As a man.

395
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:57,064
Rest.
I'll get water, okay?

396
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,789
Hello, Darren.

397
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:22,480
Hey, I was thinking it could be due ...
a bit ... a bottle of water.

398
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:26,916
Sorry, was doing a cleaning.
But usually do it naked.

399
00:40:27,264 --> 00:40:28,094
Huh?

400
00:40:28,974 --> 00:40:31,928
I'm kidding.
Go in, go to fetch water.

401
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:47,905
No one has anything
interesting in this neighborhood?

402
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:53,662
That's what I mean.

403
00:41:03,048 --> 00:41:09,251
Do not touch the blue. Hold still!
Or you'll drown in there peeing.

404
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:18,721
You, my beautiful.
Ah, yes.

405
00:41:30,272 --> 00:41:34,179
That thing you down?
Must be good!

406
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:37,367
Let's party!

407
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:42,620
Skip and his
gangster shit.

408
00:41:52,386 --> 00:41:54,298
You are in a hurry?

409
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:58,225
More or less ... but I think
I have a minute.

410
00:42:00,595 --> 00:42:02,727
Something is bothering you?

411th
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,207
You heard those shots earlier?

412
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:09,271
In this neighborhood scares me
if I did not listen.

413
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:12,134
Something happened?

414
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,276
This is a .... long history.

415
00:42:18,243 --> 00:42:20,913
I have more wine.

416
00:43:11,293 --> 00:43:16,418
Ah, yes.

417
00:43:31,771 --> 00:43:33,977
Come on.

418
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:33,709
Who would want a digital clock from the 80s?
Nor has either a calculator, my.

419
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:37,796
And it was there, man?
You got your money?

420
00:45:38,891 --> 00:45:41,132
Here is my part of the weapon.

421
00:45:41,435 --> 00:45:46,773
The Random got that money.
I need 300 bucks from you.

422
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,978
How do I get this
amount of money, man?

423
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:53,898
I know. With gay porn.

424
00:45:59,035 --> 00:46:03,706
No, man. I'm a mess.
Where is random anyway?

425
00:46:03,914 --> 00:46:07,283
Is probably a few "Chicas"
hot babes out there, right?

426
00:46:07,543 --> 00:46:10,716
Is probably in the basement with
those cunty now.

427
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:12,581
- "Cunty?
- Yes!

428
00:46:12,798 --> 00:46:14,640
You're weird, man.

429
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:20,198
You know what really is?
When that soldier moved ...

430
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,216
there lost
our hiding place, you know?

431
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:28,301
Where should we take the
Our whores now?

432
00:46:28,813 --> 00:46:32,810
We have to have a conversation
very serious with the soldier.

433
00:46:33,275 --> 00:46:36,229
He has to go!

434
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:38,772
I agree, man!

435
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:45,029
What did you say? He is making me
put the hat. What did I say?

436
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,403
Oh, no, they made you
put the hat now.

437
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,992
A game with a ball.

438
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:37,115
Hey aberration!
Get the fuck out!

439
00:47:59,648 --> 00:48:03,396
Soldier!
Come out to play!

440
00:48:04,027 --> 00:48:05,402
Stop it!

441
00:48:05,695 --> 00:48:08,151
Soldier, we need to talk.

442
00:48:08,657 --> 00:48:12,025
- The Random is the largest travel.
- That's what I'm talking about.

443
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:16,075
And then, Random?

444
00:48:16,497 --> 00:48:21,918
I knew it. He manufactures stone.
He better get us.

445
00:48:22,336 --> 00:48:24,245
This is crazy.

446
00:48:25,288 --> 00:48:29,874
Using it to test on animals.
It's sickening.

447
00:48:31,094 --> 00:48:34,843
Look at Random.
What's wrong with him?

448
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,924
Have you been smoking the shit home
the soldier? He did this to you?

449
00:48:39,185 --> 00:48:45,177
He looks all fucked up. Hey, man, you okay?
You still have most of this shit?

450
00:48:45,691 --> 00:48:47,898
Stop it, man.
Let's get him here.

451
00:48:49,362 --> 00:48:54,356
Come on, Random. Arise.
It is not right.

452
00:48:55,034 --> 00:48:58,568
Oh, shit.

453
00:48:59,663 --> 00:49:00,991
Gotcha, Random.

454
00:49:01,248 --> 00:49:03,121
But what the heck the
soldier did to him?

455
00:49:11,007 --> 00:49:14,260
- And even in front of the television.
- Sorry, television.

456
00:49:15,803 --> 00:49:20,120
Really did not want to go but
I have something I need to do.

457
00:49:20,307 --> 00:49:22,031
You need company?

458
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,404
It's okay. Just someone
I need to see.

459
00:49:25,938 --> 00:49:27,645
Is everything okay?

460
00:49:29,816 --> 00:49:36,631
Remember those shots before?
Random was the ... he was hit ...

461
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:39,325
I had to give him points.
What are you doing?

462
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:40,814
I need to see it, okay?

463
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,706
Him .. resting, had a bit
fever but has improved. He's fine.

464
00:49:44,747 --> 00:49:46,538
He needs to go
a hospital, Daren.

465
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:48,079
Maddie!

466
00:49:53,213 --> 00:49:54,965
Where's Curtis?

467
00:49:55,132 --> 00:49:58,625
He must have improved and gone.
I told you, everything is fine.

468
00:49:59,052 --> 00:50:00,760
Maddie, please, can explain.

469
00:50:01,012 --> 00:50:05,517
Ridden it here. So what are you
to get extra money?

470
00:50:05,518 --> 00:50:07,100
A sell drugs to kids?

471
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:09,010
Do not be ridiculous!
This is for my classes!

472
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,536
This is very prepared for the kids
sixth grade. Tell me the truth!

473
00:50:12,648 --> 00:50:16,270
This is not a meth lab.
This is all for scientific research!

474
00:50:16,443 --> 00:50:20,029
've Seen many bad things in this neighborhood,
but always did a blind eye.

475th
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:22,240
If you're doing anything
for our kids ... I swear

476
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:24,363
You are exaggerating too much!

477
00:50:24,868 --> 00:50:27,110
You have not seen anything.

478
00:50:28,163 --> 00:50:30,286
That was not necessary.

479
00:50:31,374 --> 00:50:33,830
Keep your camera, Darren.

480
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:04,356
Damn! Where is it?
Where is it?

481
00:51:25,217 --> 00:51:28,526
Mr. Tyler, an interesting choice.

482
00:51:29,147 --> 00:51:32,469
Use the name of his mentor,
Captain Hall?

483
00:51:33,266 --> 00:51:38,194
Of his mentor dead. Sure, you thought
would be long to find out, right?

484
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,723
Ok, so you found me.

485
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,810
Can I join?

486
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:41,930
I have an alternative?

487
00:51:42,149 --> 00:51:48,426
No, you have no alternative.
It seems we are having a party, huh?

488
00:51:48,427 --> 00:51:52,054
Stop with the psychological drama.
Take what she came for.

489
00:51:52,325 --> 00:51:54,432
Oh, we have a conversation.

490
00:52:16,598 --> 00:52:20,612
Oh, Maddie, sorry. That's crap
elevator is out of service again.

491
00:52:20,613 --> 00:52:23,639
I have more bad news.
The washing machine is also.

492
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,898
What a novelty.
Honey, you okay?

493
00:52:28,776 --> 00:52:31,350
Men. What else?

494
00:52:31,946 --> 00:52:36,193
Men? Who needs them? They go to
zoo toss peanuts to their parents.

495
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,324
Did you know that it is
better without them, dear?

496
00:52:38,786 --> 00:52:44,076
Maybe you're right Mrs. Harris.
But I have to go. Good day.

497
00:52:44,374 --> 00:52:47,554
Okay, honey. If you know where you need
find me. Here at the end of the corridor.

498
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:48,291
Okay.

499
00:52:58,805 --> 00:53:02,138
Damn kids and their
horror movies! Jesus!

500
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:17,357
Mr. Stencil?
It's okay in there?

501
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,753
Oh, that sucks.

502
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:44,675
You puxaste much the pipe,
Random huh?

503
00:53:45,557 --> 00:53:49,139
Are you still there, man?
Can you hear me?

504
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:51,103
Look if you are with the gun.

505
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:55,098
This is totally fucked up, man.

506
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,855
Hey, you saw that?
He tried to bite me!

507
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,524
What has given you?

508
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:03,790
Hey, I just calm down!

509
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,993
If you do that again I will have to
bursting with thy head, man!

510
00:54:05,994 --> 00:54:08,433
No matter the past
we had together.

511
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,369
What did fumaste, man?

512
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,499
Grab that phone cord, man!

513
00:54:12,964 --> 00:54:15,993
This is crazy!

514
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,708
Give me that.
The other side.

515
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:27,959
- Stop, Random.
- Roll Fast!

516
00:54:31,448 --> 00:54:39,312
What is this shit he smoked?
You are all crazy! We'll get you more, man!

517
00:54:39,691 --> 00:54:43,060
Shut up, Random!
I'm trying to think!

518
00:54:43,528 --> 00:54:45,022
That's right, man.

519
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:47,238
We're fine.
Are not we?

520
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:53,615
I see that you were doing
homework.

521
00:55:04,173 --> 00:55:06,082
Why do not you sit?

522
00:55:08,969 --> 00:55:11,854
I suppose you are asking what
what happened after you left.

523
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:14,120
Actually, no.
I saw the explosion.

524
00:55:14,933 --> 00:55:18,086
411 people lost
their lives that day.

525
00:55:19,729 --> 00:55:21,852
Thou shouldst be the 412.

526
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:25,817
Is not there.

527
00:55:27,528 --> 00:55:29,728
For what appears nothing could
survive in this refrigerator.

528
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,906
She is on vacation.

529
00:55:30,989 --> 00:55:35,201
What? Very funny.

530
00:55:38,163 --> 00:55:40,446
Since I will die anyway
I know why ...

531
00:55:40,498 --> 00:55:42,789
still has one so
interested in this project?

532
00:55:43,001 --> 00:55:45,207
We know that the way of life
can not be controlled.

533
00:55:45,461 --> 00:55:47,999
Someone seems to believe that you
found out something else.

534
00:55:48,256 --> 00:55:51,956
I believe that Tyler left you a specimen
thus thou mightest continue the work.

535
00:55:52,176 --> 00:55:55,172
I'll tell you what we found,
a form of extraterrestrial life ...

536
00:55:55,173 --> 00:55:56,648
who simply want to learn.

537
00:55:56,722 --> 00:55:58,845
Took account of the mind and body
American citizens ...

538
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:02,053
and used them as a
weapon against us.

539
00:56:02,269 --> 00:56:04,938
I do not care if they come from
Middle East or the Moon!

540
00:56:05,147 --> 00:56:08,190
Terrorism is terrorism.
Must be arrested, quickly and cleanly.

541
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,687
Why is the government asked Tyler to turn them
weapons instead of just destroying them, huh?

542
00:56:11,688 --> 00:56:13,255
Now who's the terrorist?

543
00:56:13,256 --> 00:56:14,358
You threaten our
way of life!

544
00:56:14,614 --> 00:56:16,191
Only defends himself!

545
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:19,527
Are you aware that if
this specimen is spread ...

546
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:26,672
will possess victim after victim, until
all humanity is destroyed?

547
00:56:26,673 --> 00:56:29,537
Not if we win back their trust.
Can not understand this?

548
00:56:29,795 --> 00:56:33,045
Can understand this: You say where
or is gonna blow your mind!

549
00:56:33,298 --> 00:56:37,344
We search, brick by brick
until we find. Choose.

550
00:56:37,345 --> 00:56:38,561
Anyway I will be
a dead man.

551st
00:56:38,178 --> 00:56:41,976
Consider me as Gabriel
front doors of Paradise.

552
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,425
You can choose Heaven
or hell.

553
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:49,519
Soldier moves on to something
Random. He is sick.

554
00:56:49,855 --> 00:56:52,150
Oh, that smell ...
Shit!

555
00:56:52,151 --> 00:56:54,182
What's happening?
You're the police or what?

556
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,092
No, man, it's not the police.
Look at him, is the Army.

557
00:56:58,093 --> 00:56:59,338
Cold as ice ...

558
00:56:59,448 --> 00:57:00,397
Where is he now?

559
00:57:00,657 --> 00:57:02,274
In our room upstairs.

560
00:57:03,243 --> 00:57:06,110
Do not tell a military where it is
our apartment. You're an idiot?

561
00:57:06,115 --> 00:57:07,200
Sorry, man.

562
00:57:07,539 --> 00:57:13,048
Hey, hey, hey! I think we should go there
over to see your friend ...

563
00:57:13,049 --> 00:57:14,418
No, my ...

564
00:57:14,504 --> 00:57:17,457
We ourselves take care of
our comrades.

565
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:18,109
This plumb!

566
00:57:18,427 --> 00:57:20,008
We can help you!

567
00:57:20,384 --> 00:57:23,027
Or prefer to stay and we
shoot each other?

568
00:57:23,028 --> 00:57:25,911
Which one?

569
00:57:28,433 --> 00:57:32,383
Ok need not be
so angry with us.

570
00:57:32,896 --> 00:57:36,670
Yeah, man. By that point the gun?
Just come talk! What the fuck!

571
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:37,390
Come on.

572
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,358
Move!

573
00:58:26,696 --> 00:58:30,172
My God, Curtis!
You scared me!

574
00:58:30,927 --> 00:58:32,069
Are you okay?

575
00:58:31,826 --> 00:58:37,534
You are under the effect of what? Curtis,
why are you doing this to yourself?

576
00:58:47,174 --> 00:58:49,250
What are you doing?

577
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:22,696
Nicky, what happens?

578
00:59:22,999 --> 00:59:25,953
I do not know. My God, what is
your problem?

579
00:59:30,002 --> 00:59:31,196
They can come!

580
00:59:36,387 --> 00:59:38,426
No! Get off me!

581
00:59:42,351 --> 00:59:46,135
Help me! Oh, my God!

582
00:59:50,192 --> 00:59:52,018
My God ...

583
01:00:08,751 --> 01:00:10,328
In God's name ...

584
01:00:31,647 --> 01:00:33,147
He was here.
Was tied.

585
01:00:33,274 --> 01:00:36,607
Shit, man! Everything went wrong
and now he is on the loose!

586
01:00:36,819 --> 01:00:37,934
What was happening to him?

587
01:00:38,154 --> 01:00:39,980
He was high, my!
It was crazy!

588
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:41,982
There was a release of
some black substance?

589
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:44,979
He is talking about that black goo.

590
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:47,811
Yes, he was drooling
a nasty black shit.

591
01:00:47,954 --> 01:00:49,579
How do you know this, man?

592
01:00:49,755 --> 01:00:53,621
We must get rid of these two.
Find that person and take care of it.

593
01:00:54,127 --> 01:00:56,416
Nobody will get rid of anyone.
Let's you.

594
01:00:56,671 --> 01:00:58,046
This is becoming annoying.

595
01:00:58,256 --> 01:01:00,213
We can be helpful.

596
01:01:00,466 --> 01:01:02,506
Why can not it go welts,
before they hurt someone?

597
01:01:02,718 --> 01:01:04,249
Hey, man. Why do not we
for the upstairs?

598
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:06,804
I bet he went to the house
Maddie's. A hot babe ...

599
01:01:07,306 --> 01:01:08,421
Or!

600
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,652
What do you, Darren? Are you selling
crack from door to door now?

601
01:01:19,985 --> 01:01:21,609
Good night.

602
01:01:21,945 --> 01:01:25,360
Who is that? Your bodyguard?
Impressive.

603
01:01:25,657 --> 01:01:27,732
You know, I'm so busy, I ...

604
01:01:28,076 --> 01:01:29,373
What happened to your hand?

605
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,151
I cut myself trying to get the knife
stuck in my back.

606
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,329
As I said, I'm busy.

607
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:38,810
Not to call him, Princess.
We are looking for Random. Him ..

608
01:01:38,811 --> 01:01:40,279
You are not you feeling well.

609
01:01:40,462 --> 01:01:45,257
I met him in the corridor,
an hour ago. One goes something?

610
01:01:45,258 --> 01:01:49,536
I'ma doctor, and he may be suffering
of a fatal and contagious.

611
01:01:49,637 --> 01:01:51,027
Contagious and fatal disease?

612
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:51,511
Yes.

613
01:01:51,931 --> 01:01:53,176
This is the new slang
streets to Drugs?

614
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:54,512
We have to find it.

615
01:01:54,726 --> 01:01:55,840
Can not make it.

616th
01:01:56,102 --> 01:02:00,763
One more question. Hast release
some kind of substance than ...

617
01:02:00,769 --> 01:02:01,189
something like a ...

618
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:03,396
It was dark.
I do not know, okay?

619
01:02:03,651 --> 01:02:04,765
Sucks that he struck disgust ...

620
01:02:05,736 --> 01:02:08,690
She slammed the door in my face ...
I'll show you ...

621
01:02:09,623 --> 01:02:10,605
Take it easy, boy.

622
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:12,667
She is lying.

623
01:02:13,827 --> 01:02:17,011
Do you have any idea where
your friend may have gone?

624
01:02:17,247 --> 01:02:20,582
It was madness, it was there that he was.
He tried to bite me.

625
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:23,371
Perhaps the terrace.
We sometimes went there to enjoy.

626
01:02:23,628 --> 01:02:24,742
Come on.

627
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:30,379
Your hand knows the popcorn
tail, man.

628
01:02:30,593 --> 01:02:32,949
And as you know the Rays
like the tail of popcorn?

629
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,593
I'm just saying, man!

630
01:02:35,097 --> 01:02:36,721
Come on, you two!

631
01:03:01,455 --> 01:03:03,115
Hey, Random!

632
01:03:05,334 --> 01:03:08,619
Shit, man, he is not here.
Maybe he was somewhere else.

633rd
01:03:08,879 --> 01:03:11,543
He was very polished for
have gone anywhere else.

634
01:03:11,548 --> 01:03:13,790
The reason it is so screwed
is what I want to know.

635
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,183
Done something
with it, soldier?

636
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:18,846
Yes, you did something with it,
sick son of a bitch?

637
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,707
Random contracted a virus
highly contagious.

638
01:03:21,724 --> 01:03:24,180
I do not know how he contracted,
but he came to help me lose.

639
01:03:24,393 --> 01:03:30,209
Wait a bit. The Random is sick and
was behind the soldier? Something is not right.

640
01:03:30,232 --> 01:03:32,225
Give me your weapon now!

641
01:03:32,526 --> 01:03:34,518
You talk seriously, man.
Again?

642
01:03:34,903 --> 01:03:39,612
This is wrong.

643
01:03:40,898 --> 01:03:44,026
What are you doing?
Wait!

644
01:03:44,027 --> 01:03:47,664
Do not shoot! He is trying to communicate!
That was what I was saying! Trying to understand!

645
01:03:47,665 --> 01:03:51,876
Random! Random!

646
01:03:53,421 --> 01:03:57,086
Viste, Collins? It is a non-hostile environment
we are able to communicate with him ....

647
01:04:00,427 --> 01:04:01,376
What the hell, man!

648
01:04:02,429 --> 01:04:06,427
That's right, my,
now you ass out!

649
01:04:07,809 --> 01:04:09,268
The son of a bitch shot me!

650
01:04:10,249 --> 01:04:13,064
You have no more bullets, you idiot.

651
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:22,646
Come on! Had to do it!
I had no alternative!

652
01:04:22,648 --> 01:04:24,399
- He was the only one?
- Yes.

653
01:04:24,617 --> 01:04:26,717
What do you mean "The only ', man?
What have you done with the Random?

654
01:04:26,869 --> 01:04:28,995
I told you I was sick!

655
01:04:29,206 --> 01:04:32,572
The disease spread rapidly,
there was nothing they could do!

656
01:04:32,724 --> 01:04:33,957
No chance, man!
Seriously!

657
01:04:34,133 --> 01:04:36,246
He looked like those
things from the movies ...

658
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,333
Those who eat people, man!

659
01:04:38,334 --> 01:04:39,995
- As a zombie!
- It's zombie!

660
01:04:40,215 --> 01:04:41,590
He was not a zombie!

661
01:04:41,883 --> 01:04:44,089
He was infected by a disease.

662
01:04:44,344 --> 01:04:47,470
Whatever, man! We need a
ambulance to his body.

663
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:48,972
We do not need an ambulance.

664
01:04:48,973 --> 01:04:51,131
We have much bigger problems.

665
01:04:51,308 --> 01:04:55,486
Of course we have bigger problems!
Put a bullet in my leg, you idiot!

666
01:04:55,604 --> 01:04:57,229
I need an ambulance!
What the fuck, man!

667
01:04:57,439 --> 01:05:01,543
The shot was grazed. Just a few points.
Can I make it down there.

668
01:05:01,921 --> 01:05:03,942
- Ok
- Fast.

669
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:06,360
After that me and you have a
transaction to complete.

670
01:05:06,615 --> 01:05:08,825
You will not be giving orders.
Me end up with you ...

671
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:10,091
Of course I will!

672
01:05:10,269 --> 01:05:13,940
And if you want to get out of this mess I suggest
you to do exactly what I say!

673
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,291
Mimimimimi ...
Fuck you, man!

674
01:05:18,501 --> 01:05:19,995
I got you, man.

675
01:05:20,377 --> 01:05:21,872
I hate this guy!

676
01:05:25,591 --> 01:05:29,802
And then?
You work for the CDC?

677
01:05:31,304 --> 01:05:35,059
We had a problem with insects once
this place was full of people from the CDC.

678
01:05:35,392 --> 01:05:36,590
- Do not move!
- Listen!

679
01:05:37,185 --> 01:05:40,636
You heard me, folks?
Insects!

680
01:05:40,897 --> 01:05:42,681
- You want to stop and listen?!
- What?

681
01:05:43,816 --> 01:05:45,061
I do not hear anything.

682
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:47,686
That's the problem.
Can not hear well.

683
01:05:47,688 --> 01:05:50,881
Nor talk, nor fights, nor cries.

684
01:05:50,882 --> 01:05:53,366
How is this place
dead.

685
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:56,159
Get out there! Get out now!

686
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:58,818
Jeff is the man!

687
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,084
Jeff is cool, man.
One of the friends of Random.

688
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,133
What is it, man?

689
01:06:17,984 --> 01:06:19,054
Let him in!

690
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:20,871
What, mine?
Are you crazy fuck?

691
01:06:20,872 --> 01:06:24,740
I'll count to three!
One, two, THREE!

692
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:47,367
What the hell, man!

693
01:06:47,564 --> 01:06:48,580
What was that?

694th
01:06:48,836 --> 01:06:52,481
Actually it was for you. If that one of
"The doctor and the monster" at us.

695
01:06:52,548 --> 01:06:55,490
It turns out that a mixture of chlorine and
Ammonia can finish them off.

696
01:06:55,717 --> 01:07:00,924
You hear that, folks?
Where is Mark? Where are you, man?

697
01:07:02,474 --> 01:07:05,664
Who knows how many people
your friend has infected.

698
01:07:05,935 --> 01:07:07,243
Hey, we have a missing man.

699
01:07:07,395 --> 01:07:09,126
What?
Why you did not keep an eye on him?

700
01:07:09,146 --> 01:07:10,771
Do not bother me, man.

701
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:13,598
Probably got scared
and returned to the apartment.

702
01:07:14,109 --> 01:07:17,110
Great!
Hey, where are you going?

703
01:07:20,282 --> 01:07:23,162
Hey, that does not look good.
We need go to the streets.

704
01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:25,657
We came back from Asia Mark,
let's go with Mark Asia.

705
01:07:26,037 --> 01:07:28,770
Do not have time for this shit.

706
01:07:29,787 --> 01:07:33,625
I suggest you go open the door ...
Open it NOW!

707
01:07:33,961 --> 01:07:35,035
I'm trying, man!

708
01:07:35,296 --> 01:07:37,834
Get out, Hall!
This place is taken!

709
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:41,127
I go to the basement!
Chlorine has down there! And much!

710
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:44,168
When you want!

711
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:49,094
Want to trade places?

712
01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:51,598
No! Shut up, man!
You are making me nervous!

713
01:08:14,437 --> 01:08:15,789
Shit!
Where the hell is the Asia?!

714
01:08:16,043 --> 01:08:16,834
Forget it.

715
01:08:16,835 --> 01:08:18,277
No, man, we must look for it!

716
01:08:19,046 --> 01:08:20,745
Are you sure
you wish to go back?

717
01:08:21,214 --> 01:08:24,298
I do not care, man!
He would not let me back!

718
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:27,633
It's him!

719
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:28,593
Is not it.

720
01:08:28,846 --> 01:08:29,763
It hit him!

721
01:08:29,764 --> 01:08:31,933
- He is infected.
- You do not know, man!

722
01:08:31,935 --> 01:08:38,550
Just think, he's out there with them, okay?
And they're not attacking. Why?

723
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:51,408
What do we do?

724
01:08:52,952 --> 01:08:54,233
You have a gun?

725
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:57,038
SINDICER

726
01:09:06,841 --> 01:09:09,082
Good evening, Mr. Tyler.
How can I help you?

727
01:09:09,301 --> 01:09:12,074
There has been an accident. A worker
City asked me to warn you ...

728
01:09:12,179 --> 01:09:14,930
a biochemical agent that malignant
was released in the building ...

729
01:09:14,932 --> 01:09:17,138
and that no one should exit
until it is contained.

730
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:19,426
Wow, biochemical agent malignant?

731
01:09:19,644 --> 01:09:21,767
Doubt that one of the city
can pronounce it.

732
01:09:22,022 --> 01:09:25,141
Why not contact me?
Why go for you?

733
01:09:25,358 --> 01:09:27,558
You are to participate
some prank?

734
01:09:27,652 --> 01:09:31,053
The truth is that a way of life
extraterrestrial was dropped in your building.

735
01:09:31,054 --> 01:09:34,274
It kills the host and has
body, reviving.

736
01:09:34,492 --> 01:09:36,284
Like in that movie
"Kindred Souls"?

737
01:09:36,285 --> 01:09:39,287
Ok, we'll try next. We
to be sure that no one ...

738
01:09:39,288 --> 01:09:42,265
exit the building by destroying
all those infected.

739
01:09:42,332 --> 01:09:46,197
I told you, dude. No one enters or
leaves this building without the keys.

740
01:09:46,211 --> 01:09:48,784
Now the dead can
handle keys, Mr. Tyler?

741
01:09:49,005 --> 01:09:51,330
This is a serious thing.

742
01:09:51,674 --> 01:09:57,632
Ok I'll join the fun. If this
form of extraterrestrial life is very ...

743
01:09:57,633 --> 01:09:59,342
smart to bring back the dead ...

744
01:09:59,599 --> 01:10:03,132
You do not think she'll find a
way out of here no matter how?

745
01:10:03,133 --> 01:10:05,862
Unless ...

746
01:10:06,979 --> 01:10:09,653
that you find a way to
kill all at once.

747
01:10:09,654 --> 01:10:12,062
Please you gotta help me.

748
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:15,652
The more you look
to darkness, Mr. Tyler,

749
01:10:15,864 --> 01:10:18,781
more likely to
something to see you back.

750
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:48,560
That's it?
No gun?

751
01:10:48,686 --> 01:10:51,177
Knives are for combat,
weapons to sell.

752
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,389
That will not work.

753
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:57,896
What's happening?
What are these? They are zombies, right?

754
01:10:58,529 --> 01:11:01,102
Technically this can they
by an extraterrestrial intelligence.

755
01:11:01,365 --> 01:11:03,322
But they are
eat people, right?

756
01:11:03,575 --> 01:11:06,362
That's right! They are eating people!
Did you find out!

757
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:09,111
So let's burn this
crap, man!

758
01:11:09,373 --> 01:11:11,579
Most is not worth anything anyway.

759
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,173
Yes! They hate this thing!

760
01:11:13,251 --> 01:11:16,223
Let's take it to the basement.
Do you have any thing to put it in?

761
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,753
Look at the garbage.

762
01:11:20,008 --> 01:11:25,257
Begins to fill these things. One by one.
You have some effervescent tablet?

763
01:11:25,262 --> 01:11:26,956
In the bathroom.

764
01:11:33,687 --> 01:11:35,098
I still do not understand
What are you doing.

765
01:11:35,355 --> 01:11:36,814
Just do what you have.

766
01:11:37,774 --> 01:11:39,933
Whatever you are doing,
do it faster.

767
01:11:40,152 --> 01:11:42,025
This will work, he believes.

768
01:11:44,948 --> 01:11:46,228
They're right there, man.

769
01:11:46,449 --> 01:11:52,455
Ok! Puts his hand on the neck
and begins to shake like that.

770
01:11:52,538 --> 01:11:54,569
It's like a fire extinguisher.

771
01:11:54,571 --> 01:11:56,260
That's right.
Come on!

772
01:11:59,704 --> 01:12:00,206
Ready?

773
01:12:03,465 --> 01:12:04,378
Mark, turn you
into zombie, man!

774
01:12:13,808 --> 01:12:15,884
I'm in trouble, man.

775
01:12:34,161 --> 01:12:36,322
Give me the knife.
Give me the knife!

776
01:12:36,323 --> 01:12:37,361
Why, man?
Let's go!

777
01:12:37,372 --> 01:12:39,411
Give me the knife.
This will delay them.

778th
01:12:40,708 --> 01:12:41,876
How long, man?

779
01:12:41,918 --> 01:12:43,495
Enough time.

780
01:12:58,642 --> 01:12:59,721
Hall, opens the door!

781
01:12:59,977 --> 01:13:02,468
Open the door, man!
Come on! Hurry!

782
01:13:02,469 --> 01:13:03,601
- Do not have much time.
- What happened?

783
01:13:03,647 --> 01:13:04,763
The entire building was destroyed, my!

784
01:13:04,764 --> 01:13:06,521
They caught the Asia Mark!

785
01:13:06,775 --> 01:13:08,317
Come on, get it.

786
01:13:08,526 --> 01:13:10,020
Not going to get it, man!

787
01:13:10,236 --> 01:13:12,273
No! Wait! The liquidator told me
that part was built ...

788
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,573
over an old swimming pool.

789
01:13:13,656 --> 01:13:15,447
We can use the chlorine
have here, behind this wall!

790
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:26,532
This place has central ventilation?

791
01:13:26,794 --> 01:13:27,956
Yes, when it works.

792
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:31,924
That's good. We have to get to
exhaust system, roof ...

793
01:13:31,925 --> 01:13:36,471
and pour this mixture of ammonia and chlorine
ourselves and stop with all infected.

794
01:13:36,553 --> 01:13:38,095
And not infected?

795
01:13:38,429 --> 01:13:41,051
Collateral damage.
This place is gone.

796
01:13:41,474 --> 01:13:44,724
A better question: How do we get
the roof with these things everywhere?

797
01:13:44,894 --> 01:13:46,602
Help me with this table.

798
01:14:03,085 --> 01:14:06,478
Earlier when he said that syringe
was the case for me to give one of ...

799
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:09,007
"The doctor and the Beast" the
did you mean by that?

800
01:14:11,544 --> 01:14:13,916
In one experiment
there was a change.

801
01:14:14,589 --> 01:14:17,376
The alien could form
successfully merge with the human.

802
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:18,754
So he was able to communicate?

803
01:14:19,009 --> 01:14:20,918
Yes, but regressed in a few hours.

804
01:14:21,136 --> 01:14:23,758
I know!
These things want to learn.

805
01:14:23,972 --> 01:14:25,632
And in the end had to be destroyed.

806
01:14:25,891 --> 01:14:28,927
Typical.
Welcome to the world of white!

807
01:14:29,186 --> 01:14:30,728
I give blood by
my brothers extraterrestrials!

808
01:14:30,979 --> 01:14:31,844
Shut up.

809
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,771
Why?
He could not be stopped?

810
01:14:33,982 --> 01:14:37,481
It became clear that it was a
threat to anyone.

811
01:14:37,694 --> 01:14:41,940
Hatred for the human race was
beyond perverse.

812
01:14:42,156 --> 01:14:45,624
Authorities feared that thou
wert possessed, or even worse ...

813
01:14:45,803 --> 01:14:47,809
loosened so that
in the population.

814
01:14:48,037 --> 01:14:49,830
Time of change.

815
01:14:51,915 --> 01:14:54,204
Sorry, they had reason.

816
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,956
We got company.

817
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:23,225
And now, Frankenstein?

818
01:15:23,487 --> 01:15:25,230
Let's find something
to put it inside.

819
01:15:26,656 --> 01:15:27,771
Hey, soldier.

820
01:15:32,162 --> 01:15:35,910
You gotta be kidding ...
This can result.

821
01:15:36,124 --> 01:15:39,539
Let's start filling these things
that we can get to the roof.

822
01:16:25,962 --> 01:16:29,960
Here they come. Stick around.
Not aspire.

823
01:16:34,637 --> 01:16:36,795
Come on! Move!

824
01:16:37,348 --> 01:16:39,506
Come on, man!
Move!

825
01:16:42,144 --> 01:16:46,011
Come on, man!
Put the mask.

826
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:56,777
He's dead!

827
01:17:13,715 --> 01:17:15,838
Continues to rise!

828
01:17:18,571 --> 01:17:19,638
Where are you going?

829
01:17:18,678 --> 01:17:21,549
I have to see Maddie.
It may still be alive.

830
01:17:21,765 --> 01:17:22,464
Do not be silly.

831
01:17:22,724 --> 01:17:23,755
I have to be sure.

832
01:17:24,017 --> 01:17:27,849
Hell, Hall! This is no time!
We have to get to the roof!

833
01:17:31,357 --> 01:17:32,816
We do not have time for this!

834
01:17:36,654 --> 01:17:37,938
- My God, Hall!
- Maddie!

835
01:17:39,015 --> 01:17:40,020
Are you listening?

836
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:43,781
Maddie, please, not you. You're the last
person I wanted to hurt you.

837
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:46,117
Mr. Romance?
We have work to finish!

838
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:49,181
Maddie, sorry.
Are you okay?

839
01:17:49,182 --> 01:17:51,497
- Come quickly!
- She goes with us!

840
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:52,892
You know that!

841
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:58,161
But I will not wait
whether it be late!

842
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:07,553
You are boring!

843
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:24,237
This place is full of them.

844
01:18:25,783 --> 01:18:27,194
Let's continue.

845
01:18:38,337 --> 01:18:42,037
Continues. I think they
have not seen us. That's right.

846
01:18:42,257 --> 01:18:45,424
That's good. Continue.
It's okay.

847
01:18:48,346 --> 01:18:50,884
Shit. I catch.
Go!

848
01:18:56,854 --> 01:18:58,479
Just a few more steps.

849
01:19:13,579 --> 01:19:16,618
Take that, grandpa!

850
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,252
Hall! One managed to escape!

851
01:20:19,724 --> 01:20:20,720
Are you okay?

852
01:20:55,591 --> 01:20:58,342
Begin to put there.
I'll turn on the fan.

853
01:22:36,644 --> 01:22:39,515
I remember you.

854
01:22:41,107 --> 01:22:44,558
She was infected.
Do not stop, I treat it.

855
01:22:46,153 --> 01:22:50,317
Maddie! Maddie!
