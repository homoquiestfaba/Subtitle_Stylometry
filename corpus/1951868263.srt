1
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,423
Coming!

2
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,962
Who is it?

3
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,107
Hello?

4
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,559
Who is it?

5
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,198
Stop fuckin' around!

6
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,099
Whoever's screwing around
out there better quit it

7
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,202
or I'll come and kick
the shit out of you!

8
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,779
Asshole.

9
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,989
Who the fuck keeps
knocking on the door?

10
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,510
Who's there?

11
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,870
Hey, guys, wait up.

12
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,913
Come on, Curt! Ha ha!
Not waiting today.

13
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,005
People to do,
things to see.

14
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,787
You guys see the play
that Shawn made this weekend?

15
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,187
- No.
- Oh my God, amazing.

16
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,055
I wish you would stop
playing though. Terrible.

17
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,391
He is not terrible.

18
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,293
- Speaking of sucking...
- Thanks.

19
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,430
Hey, Uggi,

20
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,800
tell your dad after all
our parents reelect him,

21
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,066
he better hook us up
with some easy summer jobs.

22
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,266
Yeah, sure thing.

23
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,969
Yeah, me and Nicole
can be lifeguards at the pool.

24
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,036
We could just hang out
all day in the sun,

25
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,081
driving all
the old men crazy.

26
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,743
Pool? Uh... you're gonna
be working in the library.

27
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,781
The library?

28
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,256
Okay then.
We'll have all the bookworms

29
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,089
beating off
in the corner.

30
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,788
- Get out...
- That's disgusting.

31
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:36,161
Hey, Nik, what was your grandfather
doing outside school before?

32
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,726
My mom told him to stay
away from the house.

33
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,067
Why?

34
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,300
I mean, you've just never
talked about him before.

35
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,343
He was a city cop
his whole life.

36
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,469
He even missed
my father's funeral

37
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,480
because of some case
that he was working on.

38
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,277
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

39
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,649
And now after all these years
he wants to get to know me.

40
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,244
He seems
like a cool guy.

41
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,118
Then you get
to know him, Tom.

42
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,125
Hey, did you guys hear about that
girl that got robbed in Jeffersonville?

43
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,457
- She went to grammar school here.
- Who cares?

44
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,961
Did you know her?

45
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,123
No, she was a little
younger than us.

46
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,690
Her dad's a general
contractor though.

47
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:13,296
He owns, uh, that big
boarding company, SIPCO.

48
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,307
Yeah, I know him.
Our dads were friends.

49
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,899
They used to play
football here.

50
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,911
Yeah, well, I heard
her house was broken into

51
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,503
and she was...

52
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,014
What?

53
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,573
Well, my dad won't tell me,

54
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,677
but I know she's... dead.

55
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,815
Uh, there's a reason
why your dad won't tell.

56
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,381
You're a burnout!

57
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,586
Look who's talking, bitch!

58
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,392
Oh, God, Cindy,
that's disgusting.

59
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,524
Will you two get a room?

60
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,992
Can I help you?

61
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,866
Can I give youse
a ride home?

62
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,929
- No.
- Come on, Nicole.

63
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,702
Can't Grandpa
do anything for you?

64
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,504
I don't need
a grandfather now.

65
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,545
I just wanna talk.
Please.

66
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,102
Just stop harassing me,
all right?

67
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,274
Just... just leave me alone.
Just leave me alone.

68
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,510
Please. Nicole, please.

69
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,873
The beginning
to another great season...

70
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,612
for the Glass County Lions!

71
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,357
Like before
in the years past...

72
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,725
like when
I was on the team...

73
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,764
we're gonna bring
home that trophy!

74
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,105
And when we do
bring home that trophy...

75
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,804
...best party ever!

76
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,540
Thank you and good night!

77
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,466
Okay, why are you talking
with your mouthpiece in?

78
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,196
Why do you have a mouthpiece
in, anyway? It's a pep rally.

79
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,238
I'm trying to get
ready for the season.

80
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,830
Why? You're not gonna
need it on the bench.

81
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,399
- Whoa! Ooh!
- Oh, snap.

82
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,342
Yo, why don't you
bench these?

83
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,904
- At least I made the team.
- 'Cause he fits into the small uniform.

84
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,311
Hey, Uggi, maybe you
should take a picture.

85
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,877
I mean, I hear
they last longer.

86
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,923
- Oh, good idea.
- Get out of here!

87
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,514
Leave him alone, Billy.

88
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,618
"Leave him alone, Billy."

89
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,390
Mickey Masturbator
over here.

90
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,728
I hear he freakin' whacks off
every night to the thoughts of my girl.

91
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,825
What the hell are you
talking about?

92
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,060
What?

93
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,731
Seems as though you have
a staring problem yourself.

94
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,733
- Don't worry, Uggi, you have me.
- Aww.

95
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,143
All right, down, Uggi.
Down! Down!

96
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,942
Hey, but your old man
really did get us

97
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,609
- fired up tonight, man.
- Yeah, the way Uggi looks,

98
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,119
so did your girlfriend.

99
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,424
Yeehaw! Whoo!

100
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,244
Oh! Shit! No!

101
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,915
Knock knock.

102
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,849
Who's there?

103
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,725
Oh my God! No!

104
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,047
Good evening, Billie.

105
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,418
Now what brings you
all the way out here tonight?

106
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,582
Miss being around you, Deputy.

107
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,058
My God.

108
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,626
Didn't think anything like
this made it out of the city.

109
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,297
What do you have?

110
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,533
Jerome Peters.

111
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,372
His mother says there
was a knock at the door.

112
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,912
She opened it,

113
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,776
she saw nobody.
She opened it some more.

114
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,816
She saw her son
hanging on the door.

115
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,373
So far we have no clues,

116
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,114
no motive,
no witnesses... nothing.

117
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,214
- Where's the mother now?
- She's in the den with the husband.

118
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,986
Get him down
as soon as you can.

119
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,705
Hey. Hey!

120
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,644
Turn up the TV.

121
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:34,343
...in Glass County,
a gruesome murder took place.

122
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,854
Glass County Sheriff's office

123
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,254
believe that
the Jerome Peters murder

124
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,589
was the direct result
of a high-school prank

125
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,389
gone very very wrong...

126
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,953
Gee, who... who would do
a prank like that?

127
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,589
That was no prank.

128
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,224
- Hey, they said...
- Who's "they"?

129
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,166
Who said?
Your police?

130
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,172
They wouldn't know a murderer
if he handed them their business card.

131
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,578
Well, here's mine. And it looks
like you've had enough for one night.

132
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,977
Wow, Detective Billie Vega.

133
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,084
High voice for a guy.

134
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,053
She ain't built like
any guy I know, Mick.

135
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,060
Yeah,
well, I seen better.

136
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,897
Hank, have you
seen Cutter?

137
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,561
Uh, Billie,
no, not yet.

138
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,299
Thanks.

139
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,013
That was no prank.

140
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,458
Eat it...
eat it right up.

141
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,697
- Hey, where you been, man?
- Yeah, we just ordered.

142
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,792
I stopped by
Coach Sully's office.

143
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,340
He said Jerome was
killed with ice picks.

144
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,706
All right, guys, here we go.
Cheeseburger, yours.

145
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,745
Sweet, nice.

146
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,738
Got a side salad order

147
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,079
and you guys are splitting
the B.L.T. How about you?

148
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,016
- Can I get you something?
- No, thanks.

149
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,851
He said he was literally
stuck to the door.

150
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,421
Ice picks?
What's up with that?

151
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,989
I heard they were
actually after his brother

152
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,933
and mistakenly
killed Jerome.

153
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,437
No way.

154
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,235
Jerome's brother's
older and much bigger.

155
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,072
Dude, my little
brother's bigger.

156
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,702
Billy, what's wrong
with you?

157
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,508
Your friend gets
killed by a lunatic

158
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,515
and all you can do
is sit here and make fun?

159
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,413
Uggi, what's...
what's your father think?

160
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,250
I don't know.
I haven't seen him.

161
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,483
He's been down
at Town Hall all night.

162
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,823
I heard him on the news,
though, saying it was a prank.

163
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,420
A prank?
Come on.

164
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,556
It was a black thing.

165
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,625
You know how they are.

166
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,262
You're really screwed up.

167
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,796
No, the person who
did this is screwed up.

168
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,344
Look!

169
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,845
At what?

170
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,814
- Did you see him?
- See who?

171
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,909
There was a guy just standing
out there staring at me.

172
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,181
Was he cute?

173
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,553
No, he was this...
this big scary-looking guy.

174
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,184
And he... he was
just looking at me.

175
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,160
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

176
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,890
A big scary-looking guy!

177
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,932
- Boo-hoo-hoo, everyone!
- Cut it out, Billy!

178
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,364
He was just standing there.

179
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,365
Dude, come on,
quarters down.

180
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,103
Seriously, could you
spit more food out at me?

181
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,856
So, Uggi, have you heard
from Jules tonight?

182
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,361
Yeah, she said she had
to back to her father's shop

183
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,954
and give him a hand
with some stuff.

184
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,760
With what, a motor job?

185
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,131
Billy,

186
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,105
Nik was really freaked out
over that guy.

187
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,768
Oh my gosh!
What guy?

188
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:21,370
There was no one around.
Wait... did you see anyone?

189
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,280
She looked like she'd
seen a ghost, a big one.

190
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,184
Okay, well, let's go inside
and I'll show you a big one.

191
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,719
Billy, is that all
you ever think about?

192
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,281
Oh, come on.
And you don't?

193
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,294
No, not right now.

194
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,509
Hey, Billy.

195
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,112
l... um...

196
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,186
hey, hi... Toni.

197
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,721
Hi, T-Toni.

198
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,574
You know...

199
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,171
my sister's hot, but...

200
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,573
she's... just not
hot like this.

201
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,051
I...

202
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:14,183
would fucking tear...
you... up.

203
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,862
But then...

204
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,831
I don't think you'd
be able to function,

205
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,628
no less play football.

206
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,379
Hey, Cin, I'm gonna go spend
the weekend at Brad's house.

207
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,679
Billy, baby...

208
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,116
wipe your drool.

209
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,161
Billy, what are you doing?

210
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,672
Come upstairs!

211
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,207
Yeah.

212
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,708
Hike! Go! Go!

213
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,884
What? I thought
you could run faster.

214
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,651
You know, I'm better off
just throwing to the pothead.

215
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,973
What, were you scared,
you little bitch?

216
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,016
What?

217
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,259
What, Nik?
Nik... hey... hey...

218
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,824
what... what happened?

219
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,735
- It was him.
- Who, Nik?

220
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,865
- It was that guy.
- What...

221
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,308
what guy, Nik?
There's nobody around here.

222
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,607
It was the guy standing
in the window.

223
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,012
He's... he's following me.

224
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,141
There's no one here, Nik.

225
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,616
He was... he was so big.

226
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,020
- And his face was...
- Hey hey.

227
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,149
Okay, what did
he look like?

228
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,952
Burned.

229
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,520
Come on, Nicole.
I think it was just your imagination.

230
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,533
It was real!
I walked right into him!

231
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,099
It was real!
Guys, I'm not crazy!

232
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,868
It was real.

233
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,810
All right, come on.
Let's get you home.

234
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,775
Oh-ho-ho.

235
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,111
Oh, that is beautiful...

236
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,343
if I do say so myself.

237
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,957
Troy! What's wrong
with the lights?

238
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,093
Troy, do you hear me?

239
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,226
Who's at the door?!

240
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,901
Troy, do you hear me?

241
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,170
Well... who is it?

242
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,801
- Mrs. Olen?
- Yes?

243
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:24,273
Mrs. Olen, I'm Detective Vega.
I think you know Sheriff Cutter.

244
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,436
- Mrs. Olen.
- Hello.

245
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,969
Knock knock.
Who's there?

246
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,448
Knock knock. Who's there?

247
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,785
Knock knock.
Who's there?

248
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,122
Knock knock. Who's there?

249
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,686
Knock knock.
Who's there?

250
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,664
Knock knock...

251
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,068
Is your son Troy home?

252
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,629
Is... is he in some
kind of trouble?

253
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,039
We just need to ask him
a few questions, Mrs. Olen.

254
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:07,213
Is there something wrong
with your lights, Mrs. Olen?

255
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,549
Must be some kind
of a power surge or something.

256
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,613
Uh, please,
just wait right here.

257
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:16,252
- I'll... I'll go get Troy.
- Thank you.

258
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,281
Troy...

259
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,449
what have you done?

260
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,618
Nothing, Ma. Nothing.

261
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,620
Look at this place.

262
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,528
This place hasn't
changed in over 20 years.

263
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,089
You've been here?

264
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,863
Once or twice
when we were kids.

265
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,800
Jeez.

266
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,705
They're taking awhile.

267
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,300
Let's go take a look.

268
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,344
Nothin', Ma.
I did nothing.

269
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,247
Well, then why is
there a detective

270
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,980
and... and that
Cutter boy in my house

271
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,022
wantin' to talk to you?

272
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,250
I don't know.
I don't know, Ma.

273
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,316
Well...

274
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,191
Mrs. Olen,
is everything okay?

275
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,925
Yes.

276
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,489
Why shouldn't it be?

277
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,401
- Hello, Troy.
- Hello.

278
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,939
Troy, some of the kids
we spoke to

279
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,975
said they saw you looking at them
when they left the pep rally.

280
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,908
Please, Ma,
don't let them take me.

281
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,177
- Please.
- Why would we want to take you, Troy?

282
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,150
Did you do something
wrong?

283
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,084
Please don't
hurt my boy.

284
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,781
Please!

285
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,158
I didn't do anything.

286
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,285
No, not me,
I didn't do anything.

287
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,329
Then who, Troy?
Who did something?

288
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,330
Tell us, Troy.

289
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,856
I didn't do nothin'!
I didn't do anything.

290
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,301
Leave him alone!
He didn't do nothing!

291
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,565
He knows more
than he's telling us.

292
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,133
I don't know.
I mean, even in high school,

293
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,701
I just thought
he was a weirdo.

294
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,509
Cutter, that's what
they said about Ted Bundy.

295
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,822
What did I tell you
about being a bad boy, Tommy?

296
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,426
You don't listen, do you?

297
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,692
Well, we've got special
plans for you, Tommy.

298
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:13,233
Aw, you might as well
say bye-bye, Tommy.

299
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,170
Bye-bye.

300
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,466
Silly boy.

301
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,409
There you go.

302
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,327
Oh, Nicole.

303
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,895
So beautiful.

304
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,665
You look pretty today.

305
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,770
But you didn't tell me
you missed me yet.

306
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,310
Why don't you ever
tell me you miss me?

307
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,973
I miss you. I do.
Honestly, I do.

308
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,693
How you doing?

309
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,462
Well, I'm sweepin'.

310
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,373
God, it is hot
in here.

311
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,099
Who won the football game?

312
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,340
Dad, you know by now, I don't
go to those games to watch.

313
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,348
I just go to... hang out.

314
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,209
- Do you need some help?
- Nah.

315
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,555
Dad!

316
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,056
What?!

317
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,886
Julie!

318
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,893
What's the matter?

319
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,433
Julie!

320
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,298
What's the matter?

321
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,839
Nothing, Dad.
Nothing.

322
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,036
Nothing, I'm... I'm fine.

323
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,047
Okay.

324
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,448
I want to go
test drive this baby.

325
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,679
Yeah, all right, Dad.

326
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,846
I'll pick up some dinner on the way
back.

327
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,220
- Chicken?
- Okay.

328
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,088
Make sure
it's extra crispy,

329
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,923
not like last time.

330
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,298
Oh, God.

331
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,893
Julie! No!

332
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,966
Please, no.
Please!

333
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,672
No! No no!
Julie, no!

334
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,237
No no no no!

335
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,409
No! Julie! No!

336
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,475
God, no!
No! No!

337
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,418
Please! No!
No, please!

338
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,615
No! No!

339
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,522
Please! Don't leave me.

340
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,255
- Please.
- Who's there?

341
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,762
No!

342
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:28,884
# The shadows arise,
consuming freedom to them #

343
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:36,257
# 1,000 years vast will end
retrieving our prize #

344
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:46,932
# Out from the forest,
I'll be your picture #

345
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,702
# A lonely town
and bad ass #

346
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,835
# Under control,
sicken and wither... #

347
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,504
Kids, I promise...

348
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,172
it'll only be
for a little while.

349
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,580
Just try to be home
by dark if you can.

350
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,380
Walk in groups, please.

351
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,352
All right?
Pay attention to surroundings.

352
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,752
Hey, Frank.
Good seeing you.

353
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,790
Don't forget to vote,
all right?

354
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,291
Thanks a lot.

355
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,190
Take care.

356
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,229
Try to be home
by dark if you can.

357
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,429
- See you around, man.
- No doubt.

358
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,564
- Look at this shit.
- What?

359
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,631
They want us
off the street by dark.

360
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,973
Or walking
with a large group.

361
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,775
Yeah, right.

362
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,079
- Oh... ah!
- And one.

363
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,641
I didn't touch... whatever.

364
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,619
A football team
is a large group.

365
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,655
It is.

366
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,280
Curt! When you're
done getting dressed

367
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,222
I need to see you
in my office.

368
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,260
Okay, Coach!

369
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:46,559
Hey, why don't you meet me in Coach
Sully's office when you're ready?

370
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,724
All right, cool.
It'll take a minute though.

371
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,324
Yeah, I know.

372
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:51,925
Yeah, right.

373
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,417
Come on, Curt.

374
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,190
Stop fuckin' around!

375
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,065
Your son Shawn looks
real good in practice.

376
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,110
He's really gonna
light them up this year.

377
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,045
Yeah. I keep telling him
he's gotta stay focused,

378
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,945
keep working.

379
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,506
Game's getting
faster all the time.

380
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,381
It sure is,
I'll tell you.

381
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,318
Can't keep up
with it myself.

382
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,451
What the...

383
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,491
Knock knock.

384
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,639
"Knock knock"?

385
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,039
What the hell kinda prank
are they playing on me today?

386
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,679
Knock knock.

387
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,305
Who's there?

388
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,145
Knock knock.

389
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,776
Who's there?

390
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,913
Knock knock. Who's there?

391
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,390
Knock knock.
Who's there?

392
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,895
Knock knock.
Who's there?

393
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,160
Knock knock. Who's there?

394
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:38,669
Knock knock.
Who's there?

395
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,872
No-oh-oh!

396
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,774
No! No! No! No!

397
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:50,780
- No!
- Holy shit.

398
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,339
No!

399
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,079
Knock knock.
Who's there?

400
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,130
- Where you taking me, man?
- Shut up!

401
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,826
I didn't do anything.

402
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,732
Where... where you taking me?

403
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,430
Please, where are
you taking me?

404
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,097
- Come on! Quiet!
- What is this?

405
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,408
Come on, Troy, tell me:
Why did you kill Shawn Rae Jr?

406
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,688
Look at me, Troy!
Was it jealousy?

407
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,419
I didn't kill anybody,
not me. No, not me.

408
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:37,154
Didn't I tell you
to look at me?

409
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,718
Do you think this is funny?

410
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,957
I'll smack that fucking
smile right off your face.

411
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,523
Why did you kill
Shawn Rae, Troy?

412
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,159
I didn't kill anybody.

413
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,899
Oh! She has a little
tiger in her, huh?

414
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,565
I love that
in a woman.

415
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,632
We got our killer?
We charging him?

416
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,405
What do you
think, Mike?

417
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,343
This guy's
not your killer.

418
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,904
What do you mean
he's not our killer?

419
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,711
Dean, please.

420
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,411
Why do you
think that?

421
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,784
Charlie, look at him.
He's small, weak.

422
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,517
Besides, this guy's
left-handed.

423
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:11,460
The coroner says your
guy's gotta be 6'2", 6'3".

424
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,555
Most of all, Charlie,
your killer's right-handed.

425
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,361
The coroner?

426
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,698
He stops for a cocktail
at The Abbey once in a while.

427
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,967
Innocent people
are being killed.

428
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,440
There are pictures
of kids in this book.

429
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,069
Start fucking talking, Troy.

430
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:31,046
The ice pick incisions
in the Jerome kid

431
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,049
all came from
the right side.

432
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:34,607
Julie Papas,

433
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:37,051
she was smacked around
on the left side of her face.

434
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,612
And, Charlie, I'm telling you,
I'll bet you anything,

435
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,590
something on Shawn Rae

436
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,786
is gonna lead you
to a right-handed killer.

437
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,053
You are good.

438
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,962
What can I tell ya?

439
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,864
I think you're
both fuckin' crazy.

440
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,199
We need a killer
and we need him now.

441
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,239
So Vega's smacking around
an innocent guy?

442
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,037
I didn't say
he's innocent,

443
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,737
but he's not
your killer.

444
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,802
Let her get her
frustrations out anyway.

445
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,178
Maybe it's that time
of month or something.

446
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:08,218
Besides, it might soften
this prick up a little bit.

447
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,776
Well, you better
get out of here

448
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,015
before she sees you
and softens you up a little.

449
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,080
Hey, you know
I might like that too.

450
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,618
Hey, Charlie,
where's this guy's mother?

451
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,459
Out in the waiting area.

452
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,158
Do me a favor...
hold 'em here.

453
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,224
I want to do
a little snooping around.

454
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,429
We searched the house
and his room.

455
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,267
And that's why I'm going.

456
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,340
You think
he knows something?

457
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,276
Oh, he knows.
He knows a lot.

458
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,370
Believe me.

459
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:15,672
Hey, Mike, you've seen
a lot of shit in your day,

460
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,570
being on the job.

461
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,337
What do you think of that Shawn kid
being killed like that?

462
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,538
And then in his
father's place too.

463
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,172
What do you mean
"too," Hank?

464
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,739
That Julie Papas...

465
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:30,309
she was killed in her
father's shop too. Right?

466
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,048
You know, you're right.

467
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,215
What do you know
about this Rico Volpe?

468
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,781
Father or son?

469
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,919
- Both.
- Hey, now you're going back.

470
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,494
Father...
local funeral director.

471
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,590
Nice dresser and all.
Good customer too.

472
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,499
His place burnt down,
almost killed his son.

473
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,631
What happened?

474
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:54,007
The son, Rico Jr...

475
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,842
loner, had no friends.

476
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,905
Mother left,

477
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,042
father falls behind
on the mortgage.

478
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,348
They say he
torched the place...

479
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,888
...to collect
the insurance money...

480
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,253
with his son in it!

481
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,189
- Shit.
- Nice guy, huh?

482
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,852
- Real nice guy.
- Uh-oh.

483
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,760
Find anything, Mick?

484
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,765
I don't know what
you're talking about.

485
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,801
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

486
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,098
Maybe they didn't use warrants
in New York,

487
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,967
but here we do things
by the book.

488
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,530
Like tonight, when you
smacked around that mamaluke?

489
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,166
Is that by the book?

490
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:30,307
Stay out of my way
or I'll fuckin' smack you around.

491
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,982
I might like that.

492
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,593
Billy, I'll be down
in just a minute!

493
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,495
Don't go anywhere.

494
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:21,449
Billy, quit trying to scare me.

495
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,598
You're so predictable.
Quit fucking around, asshole.

496
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,907
Billy?

497
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,012
Billy, are you out there?

498
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:14,889
Excuse me.

499
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,058
Could you help me
a minute, please?

500
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:19,728
Hold on one second,
I'll be happy to help you.

501
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,535
I'm sorry to bother you.

502
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,774
I left my glasses home... again.

503
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,340
I was hoping you could
help me read this article.

504
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:36,318
It's kind of important.

505
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,877
Don't even think about it.
That's what I'm here for.

506
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:40,947
Thank you.

507
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,719
Excuse me.

508
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,091
That's... quite all right.

509
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,959
Okay, what do
we have here?

510
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,598
Okay.

511
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,191
"Yesterday, in Glass County
Superior Court,

512
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,760
Rico Volpe Sr.
was found guilty

513
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:56,465
of attempted murder
and arson

514
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,065
after deliberately starting
a fire in his funeral home

515
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:01,406
to recoup insurance money.

516
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,378
Mr. Volpe maintained
his innocence,

517
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,109
stating that he left his son
and his son's friend in their home

518
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:07,878
when he left
to go on an errand.

519
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,545
Firemen found Rico Jr.
locked in a casket,

520
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,282
still alive,
but badly burned.

521
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,654
No other body was found.

522
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,216
Sources say defense attorneys
had tried to argue

523
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:20,320
that Rico Jr. was responsible
for starting the fire,

524
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,989
but Volpe
refused to reveal

525
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,556
the identity
of the alleged accomplice.

526
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:27,126
Rico Volpe Sr. was sentenced
to life in prison."

527
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,765
He didn't do it. He could
never do anything like that.

528
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,833
How would you know that?

529
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,347
I know him.
He had a thing for me...

530
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,972
if you know
what I mean.

531
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:40,676
I don't blame him.

532
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,241
Thank you.

533
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,651
I know one thing,
I know he adored his kids.

534
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,712
Kids?

535
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,781
Oh, he has
a daughter named Rachel.

536
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,885
She runs a bar called Dylan's
on the outskirt of Wayne.

537
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,987
What is she,
the barmaid?

538
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,294
She's the bouncer.
If you've had one too many,

539
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,596
you find yourself
staring at the sidewalk

540
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,159
when you wake up.

541
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,432
She's a real tough one.

542
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,703
Why don't we have a drink?

543
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,439
I'd love to, sugar.

544
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,141
But like I told you,
she's a real tough one.

545
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:14,706
And she don't
like me very much.

546
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,309
Maybe next time?

547
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,015
Maybe.

548
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,282
- What can I get ya?
- Let me get a Scotch,

549
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,443
tall glass,
a lot of ice, please.

550
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,588
You got some body.
You work out?

551
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:55,181
No.

552
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,089
You look like you do.

553
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,185
Yeah, well,
I get my workout

554
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,594
throwing annoying guys like you
out on their asses.

555
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:10,138
What happened
to your wrist?

556
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,370
Well, some guy annoyed me,

557
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,343
so I knocked him
the fuck out...

558
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:18,980
with one shot.

559
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,142
- Nice. Very nice.
- That's $5.50.

560
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,842
Keep the change.

561
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,621
You are Rachel Volpe, right?

562
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,824
- Who the fuck are you?
- My name's Mike Soato.

563
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:37,196
Yo, hold up.
What are you doing?

564
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:38,757
How many times
do I have to tell you

565
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,826
they go in
the walk-in box.

566
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,203
So what are you, a cop?

567
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,575
Used to be.
No more.

568
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,204
So then,
what do you want here?

569
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:54,341
I'd like to find out a little more
about your brother Rico.

570
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,978
Why? You like being nosy?

571
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,352
What, that's a cop
thing, right?

572
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:02,256
No. I think what
happened to him that day

573
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,384
has a lot to do
with what's going on now.

574
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,723
What, those kid murders?

575
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,288
Well, fuck them.

576
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,197
What does it have
to do with my brother?

577
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,168
I was hoping
you could tell me.

578
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,261
How about I knock
your fuckin' lights out?

579
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,464
Jesus Christ.
What is it with me and women?

580
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,374
All youse wanna do
is hit me.

581
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,743
I wonder why. Listen.

582
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:27,648
They put my father away for life
and they committed my brother.

583
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,378
End of story.

584
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,421
What about your mother?

585
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:33,285
Don't know, don't care.

586
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,655
Bitch is dead to me.

587
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,785
Like I said:
end of story.

588
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,630
How's your brother Rico?

589
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,792
Hello.

590
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:48,427
Marcus, look.
You're the mayor.

591
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,803
If you want to continue
to be the fuckin' mayor,

592
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,637
you gotta find out
what's happening.

593
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,734
Our kid's are dying here!

594
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,138
Look, I just
walked in the house.

595
00:51:58,215 --> 00:51:59,910
Dean, I'll talk
to you tomorrow.

596
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,415
Cindy!

597
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,553
Cindy!

598
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,161
Knock knock.

599
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,357
Who's there?

600
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,727
Cindy!

601
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,965
God, no! Cindy!

602
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,631
God!

603
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:30,846
Cindy! Oh my God!
Cindy! No!

604
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,246
Cindy!

605
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,089
Knock Knock.
Who's there?

606
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,284
Knock knock. Who's there?

607
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:46,261
No!

608
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,560
Knock knock.
Who's there?

609
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,431
Knock knock. Who's there?

610
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:56,097
Knock knock.
Who's there?

611
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,903
Knock knock. Who's there?

612
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:02,206
Knock knock.
Who's there?

613
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,372
Knock knock.

614
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,608
Who's there?

615
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,116
Okay, Vega,
what do you got?

616
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,218
I don't know anymore.
This guy is just killing at random.

617
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,456
He has no motive.

618
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,157
Try starting
with revenge.

619
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,132
- What did you say?
- Captain, may I?

620
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,135
Yeah, what do you got?

621
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,865
The killer's getting some kind
of work-related revenge.

622
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,668
What?

623
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,230
Julie Papas...

624
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,903
she was killed
at her father's workshop.

625
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:36,468
Shawn Rae,

626
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,537
and today,
this kid Billy...

627
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,083
also killed in the father's
workshop.

628
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,618
What about
Cindy and Jerome?

629
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,449
They were both
killed in their homes.

630
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,580
Cindy was butchered
like a deer.

631
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:49,216
So? What does that have
to do with anything?

632
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,419
Cindy's dad owns
Drake's Meat.

633
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,022
Jerome's father
is an iceman.

634
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,066
What do we do?

635
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,432
We can tell
their friends.

636
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,300
That would take
too much of our manpower

637
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,930
that we don't have.

638
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,601
You could try to see what
the fathers have in common.

639
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,769
What do you think?

640
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:10,938
Find out who's next.

641
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,675
Nobody knows that.

642
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,081
He does.

643
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,286
Who are you?

644
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,526
Knock knock.
Who's there?

645
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,626
Knock knock. Who's there?

646
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,330
What do you want?!

647
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,931
Knock knock.

648
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:41,239
Knock knock.

649
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,637
Knock knock.

650
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,914
Knock knock.

651
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,017
- Knock knock.
- What have I done to you?

652
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:56,286
- Who's there?
- Why are you doing this to me?!

653
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,659
Why are you
doing this to me?!

654
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,703
Why-why... why are you
doing this to me?!

655
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,239
Oh my God! No!

656
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,858
# I look forward... #

657
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,790
What are you
gonna do with that?

658
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,563
It ain't safe
out there, Mick.

659
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:24,032
So me and Suzie here

660
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,972
are gonna have
to put a stop to it.

661
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,237
You're not gonna stop
anything with that.

662
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,440
Then how do we?

663
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:34,244
We?

664
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,809
We can start
by having a drink together.

665
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,186
- What can I get you, Billie?
- Jack, straight up, please.

666
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,357
What's the matter?

667
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:50,729
You look like
a martini girl to me.

668
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,631
Martinis are
for next time.

669
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,871
Here's to the next time.

670
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,936
Get me another one
and her one.

671
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,678
Are you okay, Cindy?

672
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:11,617
You hurt Cindy, Rick.

673
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,850
You hurt Cindy.

674
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,518
I promise he won't do it
to you again, Cindy.

675
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,559
Because if you do...

676
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,109
You look so beautiful.

677
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,407
You know I love you,
don't you?

678
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,711
Is it true you once dressed
as a woman to make a bust?

679
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:47,321
- Yeah. Scary, huh?
- It's hilarious.

680
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,221
You think that's funny,
you should've seen the time

681
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:51,283
they made me go
undercover in a gay bar.

682
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,431
You've seen a lot
of shit in your day.

683
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,161
How about you?

684
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:01,066
Biggest things
I ever had before this

685
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,538
were shoplifters, bootleggers
and some domestic violence cases.

686
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:06,472
Usually the same people too.

687
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:11,507
How come they
named you Billie?

688
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,845
Father wanted a boy,
I guess.

689
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,780
Is that why you got
that chip on your shoulder?

690
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:21,346
My father wasn't
nice to me growing up.

691
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:24,882
I never told anybody this,
but he should've had a boy.

692
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:28,123
Is that why you
joined the force?

693
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:31,257
I was homecoming queen,
Miss Teen-everything.

694
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,995
My father was livid.

695
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,934
At least you have
the equipment for it.

696
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:36,869
Thanks.

697
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,875
Listen, I'm really sorry about
the way I've been treating you.

698
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:43,208
Listen to me, Billie.
Listen to me.

699
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:46,771
Don't let this job take
your life like it took mine.

700
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:49,340
I gave my entire life
to this job.

701
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,717
Even when my wife
was dying of cancer,

702
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:53,688
I didn't even
have time for her.

703
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,246
And after she died,

704
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,486
I sent my only son up here
to live with his aunt.

705
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,993
Why?

706
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,360
Because I didn't
have the time to raise him.

707
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,831
And then just when I thought
I'd get to know him...

708
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,960
he goes and dies
in a car crash on me.

709
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,698
Now I'm trying to get
to know my granddaughter...

710
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,865
his daughter Nikki.

711
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,432
And she don't want
nothing to do with me.

712
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,068
And you know what, Billie?

713
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:18,409
I don't even blame her.

714
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:20,142
I'm really sorry.

715
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:21,877
Give her a little
more time.

716
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,441
Time?

717
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:24,952
Oh, and another thing...

718
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,080
- There's more?
- Oh, there's more.

719
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:30,819
Don't ever ever tell
your commanding officer

720
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,191
you don't know.
Even when you don't know...

721
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:35,526
you know.

722
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,896
I guess I have
a lot to learn.

723
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,128
Hey, I got time.

724
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:51,275
Knock knock. Who's there?

725
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,544
Knock knock.
Who's there?

726
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:57,916
Knock knock. Who's there?

727
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,420
Knock knock.

728
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,988
Who's there?

729
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:30,509
Oh God, no!

730
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,595
Pick up, Mike.

731
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:08,917
- Hello.
- Mike, it's Vega.

732
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,482
There's been another murder.

733
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:15,019
Meet me at the skateboard park on
Morris Boulevard near the highway.

734
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:16,531
Get here as soon
as you can.

735
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:19,591
I'll be there
in a little while. Bye.

736
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,470
So what's up?

737
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:32,707
I told you they were
bad for your health.

738
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:34,249
So are you?

739
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:36,410
Look, Mike, you said
I have a lot to learn, right?

740
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,386
- That's right.
- Well, school's in.

741
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:40,012
It's bad.

742
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,613
Come on.

743
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,856
What do you got?

744
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,026
His name was
Rick Cohen, 16.

745
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,802
Decapitated...
every limb cut off.

746
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,136
- Oh my God.
- I've never seen anything like this,

747
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:06,374
not even
in the movies.

748
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,748
This kid's out of the circle
of the other murder victims.

749
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:11,844
He goes
to a private school.

750
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:13,411
No connection.

751
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:14,979
What does
his father do?

752
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,150
He's a doctor.

753
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:19,217
What do you think?

754
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,126
It's definitely
the same killer.

755
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:23,256
The patterns all match.

756
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:24,799
The coroner was right.

757
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:26,767
This guy's extremely
fuckin' strong.

758
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:29,134
And like I said,
he's right-handed.

759
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:31,963
You see how
the right side limbs...

760
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,872
the cuts are much cleaner?

761
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:36,776
If the killer was holding up the
body with his left hand,

762
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,872
to cut the right side limbs
wouldn't be a problem.

763
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,850
Otherwise, he'd have to
reach over his outstretched arm,

764
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,752
making it very difficult
to cut the left side.

765
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,017
And remember, he's still
holding the kid up...

766
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:52,291
by his hair.

767
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:58,125
What happened to him?

768
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,226
He said Rick was doing
his thing in the ring

769
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:02,134
when he saw a shadow
come up behind him.

770
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,264
He turned,
next thing he knows,

771
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,001
he's being brought to
by the E.M.T.

772
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,566
Why not kill 'em both?

773
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:11,169
He didn't want both.

774
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:14,273
- Cutter, what's up?
- I just got back from Clark's Gym.

775
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,342
Tommy Clark's body was thrown
through the front window.

776
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,647
Every bone in his body
looked broken.

777
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:22,987
His face was
barely recognizable.

778
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:25,254
What kind of doctor was
this Cohen kid's father?

779
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:28,020
Plastic surgeon.

780
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,892
This Cohen kid's father,

781
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:35,870
he wasn't even
on the football team.

782
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:39,203
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but what do these
killings have to do with football?

783
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:41,140
Well, I mean,
all the other fathers,

784
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,542
they... they played football.

785
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,104
Did you know that?

786
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:47,672
No.

787
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,218
l... I played
high-school ball with them.

788
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:53,549
- Yes.
- Come on, Billie. Come on.

789
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,113
I realize it's bad.

790
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:57,421
The Clark boy too. Uh-huh.

791
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,396
Where are we going?

792
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,462
First we go by the Tommy
Clark crime scene.

793
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:13,838
Then after school, we're gonna
go see your friend Troy.

794
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,571
Think we could
get him to talk?

795
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:17,806
If not, you're gonna
need a whole lot more

796
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,609
of this yellow tape.

797
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,950
Hey, what do you
make of the mayor

798
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,886
knowing all the fathers
of the victims played football?

799
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,547
Coincidence?

800
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:29,853
I don't believe
in coincidence.

801
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,416
How do we play Troy?

802
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,189
You're the beauty
pageant winner.

803
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,093
We're gonna use
these good looks

804
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:36,927
for the sake of the job.

805
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,370
Leave the jacket
in the car.

806
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,879
Come here.
Come over here.

807
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,320
Act nice.
Be a little bit more seductive.

808
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,181
Come on.

809
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:20,398
There he is.

810
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:35,653
Hey!

811
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,420
Please! Please don't...
don't hit me!

812
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,428
Calm down, Troy.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

813
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,794
- Please don't.
- Troy, listen.

814
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:45,698
We just need help with a little
something. Ain't that right, Billie?

815
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,395
That's right.

816
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,801
Will you do that
for me, Troy?

817
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:52,363
Please?

818
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,636
Good. What can you tell
me about your friend?

819
01:06:57,713 --> 01:07:00,113
You know, Troy,
the one you're always talking to.

820
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,547
Oh, I don't know.

821
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,448
I don't know what
you're talking about.

822
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,111
Come on, Troy.

823
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,677
Please tell Billie.

824
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,849
Tell Billie all
about him and I promise

825
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:11,222
no one's gonna hurt you.

826
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:14,660
Knock knock. Who's there?

827
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:17,494
Knock knock.
Who's there?

828
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:20,194
Knock knock. Who's there?

829
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:24,103
Knock knock. Who's there?

830
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:27,267
Knock knock.
Who's there?

831
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,208
Knock knock. Who's there?

832
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:32,111
- Stop that! Get off!
- Who's there?

833
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:35,275
- Please stop it! Stop!
- Knock knock. Who's there?

834
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:37,478
You had your turn!
Listen to me,

835
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,885
you fuckin' idiot!
You ain't as dumb as you look!

836
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:41,582
Please!
Go away!

837
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:43,557
Stop that!
Don't do that!

838
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:45,321
- Go away!
- Knock, knock.

839
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,021
- Mike!
- Mike what? You had your turn!

840
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:49,564
Listen to me,
you fuckin' idiot.

841
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:52,032
I know you ain't as dumb
as you look. Please what?!

842
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:53,363
Knock knock. Who's there?

843
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,503
Where's Rico Volpe?
Tell me about Rico Volpe!

844
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,839
Tell me about Rico Volpe!
Tell me about him.

845
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,846
The guy you've been
talking to... where is he?

846
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,178
Look at it! This is the guy
you've been talking to.

847
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,841
Don't look at her,
look at me!

848
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,785
What happened...

849
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:14,288
Tell me about the fire.
How did the fire start?

850
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:17,189
I'm talking to you!
Listen to me, you fucking idiot.

851
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,749
What happened to Rico?

852
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,523
You were with him.
You were with him, Troy.

853
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,121
- Knock knock. Who's there?
- What happened to Rico Volpe?

854
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,100
Knock knock. Who's there?
Knock knock. Who's there?

855
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:28,329
You were the friend that was
with him. Ain't that right?

856
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:29,462
Knock knock. Who's there?

857
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,665
Did you start the fire?
Did you start the fire?

858
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,766
Knock knock.
Who's there?

859
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,589
Listen to me, Troy.
Please listen to me.

860
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,322
There are innocent
children being slaughtered.

861
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,159
They are just kids.

862
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:58,700
Kids. You understand?

863
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:01,167
- Kids!
- So were we!

864
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,865
We were just kids too.

865
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:06,237
What happened, Troy?
Please tell us.

866
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,440
We were just playing army
in our foxhole.

867
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:12,003
You and Rico
were playing army?

868
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:14,242
Then what happened, Troy?

869
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:16,648
Rico and I would always
play together after school.

870
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,687
He's my best friend.

871
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:21,951
That's good. Real good.

872
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:26,017
After school, me and Rico would help
his father clean up the funeral home.

873
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:27,858
And then you know,
Mr. Volpe,

874
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,761
he would let us play
in the basement.

875
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,322
That's where
our foxhole was.

876
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:34,868
Ha ha!
I'm killing all your guys!

877
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:37,531
- What do you think of that?
- Not all my guys.

878
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,403
What about my sniper?

879
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:43,377
We had so much fun.

880
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,614
- That's good.
- Then what happened, Troy?

881
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,116
Did you two by accident
start the fire?

882
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,813
No. No.
We didn't start the fire.

883
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:55,681
- They did!
- Who, Troy?

884
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:58,488
Who are they?

885
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:01,687
My bazooka guy's
getting all your people.

886
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,100
Here comes my sergeant.

887
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:19,303
Me and Rico were
playing in the basement

888
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,372
when we heard
them upstairs.

889
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:24,817
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

890
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:32,086
Rico!

891
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:34,288
- Shh! Quiet.
- You think it's burglars?

892
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,661
I don't know.

893
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,694
Hey!

894
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:42,566
- What's going on, Rico?
- What are you guys doing?

895
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,538
What's going on? Hey...

896
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,404
What are you guys doing here?
We're closed...

897
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:47,499
Lookie what we got here.

898
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,168
Where's your
retard friend, huh?

899
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,440
Hey, what are you guys
doing here? We're closed.

900
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:54,539
Oh, you are? Hey, guys,
he says they're closed!

901
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:56,346
Go home.

902
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:59,251
Hey you, get off
my father's stuff.

903
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:00,788
Get him.
Get him guys! Come on!

904
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:03,322
Get him down.
Hold him down!

905
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,451
- I got his legs.
- What are you guys doing?

906
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:07,392
Hold him down!
You'll see what we're doing.

907
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:09,055
No!

908
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:11,258
What are
you doing to me?

909
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,665
- No!
- Oh, you'll see what we're gonna do.

910
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:17,035
- No!
- Come on.

911
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,664
What are you guys doing?!

912
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:22,142
Hold still!

913
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:23,940
Come on, guys!
Hurry up!

914
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,972
Come on, damn it!
Open to the casket! Get it open.

915
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:31,910
What are you guys
doing to me?! No!

916
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,286
- Shut up! Shut up!
- No!

917
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:37,689
Stop! What are
you guys doing?!

918
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,853
- Quiet!
- Come on, shut him up.

919
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:43,561
Let me out!

920
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,898
Knock knock.

921
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,407
Who's there?

922
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:54,965
It's Rico!

923
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:59,603
Knock knock.
Who's there?

924
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:02,014
It's Rico!

925
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,915
Knock knock.

926
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,454
Who's there?

927
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:08,353
It's Rico!

928
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,456
Knock knock.

929
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:12,960
Who's there?

930
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:15,690
It's Rico!

931
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,233
Shh!

932
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:20,768
Knock knock.

933
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,929
Who's there?

934
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,769
It's Rico!

935
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,502
Knock knock!

936
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,635
All right, hey,
it's enough. Just let him out.

937
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,475
Dean, we're just
having a little fun.

938
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,914
Knock knock.

939
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,416
Who's there?

940
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,715
- It's Rico!
- I said cut it out!

941
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:40,846
Who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

942
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:43,483
I don't know we even hang out
with this little sissy punk.

943
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:46,187
Come on!
Knock knock. Who's there?

944
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:49,355
Knock knock.
Who's there?

945
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:52,923
Knock knock. Who's there?
Knock knock. Who's there?

946
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:55,936
Knock knock.
Who's there?

947
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:57,699
Knock knock.
Who's there?

948
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:00,139
- Fire!
- Put it out!

949
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,699
Get it open!
Get it open!

950
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:03,301
- I can't! It's stuck!
- Come on!

951
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,370
- Get him out!
- What did you do?!

952
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:06,971
- He's gonna fucking die.
- Rico.

953
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,846
Are you kidding me?
Guys, come on!

954
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:11,181
No, we're all
gonna die, man!

955
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:14,984
Oh, Rico, I'm sorry.

956
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:25,126
Rico!

957
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,862
Rico! Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

958
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:29,335
I'll get you out, Rico!

959
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,805
Rico! Rico!

960
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,842
Rico, I'm gonna
get you out, Rico!

961
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,643
Rico! Rico!

962
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,614
- Rico!
- No!

963
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,549
They left him
there to die!

964
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:47,550
I wanted to help...

965
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:49,215
but I couldn't.

966
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:51,759
I couldn't
open the casket.

967
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,125
I let my
best friend burn.

968
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:55,754
Troy, oh my...

969
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:58,129
Troy, if you could've,
you would've.

970
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,690
You can help him now.

971
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,292
Tell me who
did this to him.

972
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:02,997
Tell me.
Please, Troy.

973
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,504
Please, Troy, tell us.

974
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:06,370
I'll make sure
no one hurts you.

975
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:32,089
Come on, Troy.
What do you want to show us?

976
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,481
Shawn Rae,
Tony Papas,

977
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:29,956
Billy Smith,
Jerome Peters...

978
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,652
They were the ones
that did it, Troy?

979
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:34,728
The football players.

980
01:15:34,796 --> 01:15:36,286
Football here
is so important

981
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,526
they'd even cover up
attempted murder?

982
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,830
I'm sure they didn't
intend to start that fire.

983
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:43,394
They were probably just bullies
out having some fun.

984
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:46,066
That casket door jammed
and they panicked.

985
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:51,070
The Cohen kid...
he had to be the ballboy.

986
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:53,080
That's how
he fits in.

987
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:55,844
He had a car.

988
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:59,483
They were friends with him
because he had a car.

989
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,648
Some things never
fuckin' change.

990
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:08,653
The last one
is Fred Hunter.

991
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,823
His kid's
gotta be next.

992
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,594
His was first.

993
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:14,465
Holly Hunter was
killed a few weeks ago

994
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:16,561
in Jefferson County.

995
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:18,833
Is that it, Troy?
Is that all of them?

996
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:27,371
That's all the circles, Troy.
Who else was there?

997
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,147
It's okay.

998
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,765
Michael Reynolds?

999
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,092
Billie, that's my son.
When he came up here,

1000
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:50,661
he moved in with his aunt.
He took her last name to fit in.

1001
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:52,036
Knock knock. Who's there?

1002
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,166
Your son was the one that locked
Rico in the coffin.

1003
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:56,301
My granddaughter Nikki.

1004
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:58,573
That son of a bitch saved her
for last! Let's go!

1005
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:01,013
Knock knock.
Who's there?

1006
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,950
Please don't hurt him!
Please don't hurt him again!

1007
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:06,715
He's my friend!

1008
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,610
#... you borrowed from me
just expired #

1009
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:34,842
# You never loved me #

1010
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:37,180
# Like I love you #

1011
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,220
# Many many times #

1012
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,517
# I tried to walk away #

1013
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:44,320
- # Can't no one love you... #

1014
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:46,293
# Like I love you #

1015
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:49,455
# You pick me up to break
me down and kiss the... #

1016
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:01,268
This is Detective
Billie Vega.

1017
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:04,210
I need all available units to meet me
at... Mike, what's the address?

1018
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:05,906
- There's no answer.
- Mike?

1019
01:18:07,382 --> 01:18:10,044
- 926 Willow.
- 926 Willow Street.

1020
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:11,710
Possible 10-13 in progress.

1021
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:14,449
Okay, so Rico gets
out of the institution,

1022
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,081
comes back for revenge.

1023
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:18,319
Instead of taking it out
on the guys that did it to him,

1024
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:19,951
he kills their kids.

1025
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,519
In a way that relates
to their father's job.

1026
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:24,588
Just like they did to him.

1027
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,964
What'd your son do
before the accident?

1028
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:30,334
Nothing. He killed himself
soon after he got married.

1029
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:32,805
- You said it was an accident.
- I always thought it was...

1030
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,535
until now.

1031
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:36,770
We'll find Rico
and stop him.

1032
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:38,335
We will?

1033
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:41,041
His sister said he died
two weeks ago in the institution.

1034
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:42,845
- Sister?
- Don't ask.

1035
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:09,172
Knock knock.

1036
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:33,628
Why... why are you
doing this to me?

1037
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:38,069
Why are you
doing this? Help!

1038
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,013
Nicole!

1039
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:58,491
Nicole!

1040
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,222
- Mrs. Reynolds!
- Ruth!

1041
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:03,389
- Mrs. Reynolds!
- Nicole!

1042
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:05,399
Nikki!

1043
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,136
Nicole! Ruth!

1044
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,707
Nicole!

1045
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:15,265
Ruth!

1046
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:19,006
Nicole!

1047
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,515
Help!

1048
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,254
Why are you
doing this to me?

1049
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:29,119
Why are you doing this?!

1050
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:31,921
- Who's there?
- Please!

1051
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:33,620
Please!

1052
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:38,423
Why are you doing this?

1053
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:40,934
Why?

1054
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:43,266
Why are you doing this?

1055
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,363
Wait! Wait!

1056
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:11,656
Who's there?

1057
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:14,224
It's Rico! Knock knock.

1058
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:15,860
Who's there?

1059
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:17,734
It's Rico!
Knock knock.

1060
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,364
Who's there?

1061
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,170
It's Rico!

1062
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:32,177
Shit.

1063
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:34,119
I'll go around back.

1064
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:00,132
Shit!

1065
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,641
Ruth.

1066
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,439
Ruth!

1067
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:15,349
Shit.
Nicole!

1068
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,516
Nicole!

1069
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:35,075
I'm sorry, Nicole.

1070
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:37,908
I should've figured
this out sooner.

1071
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:41,073
- I could've protected you from it.
- You saved my life, Grandpa.

1072
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:46,645
Who... who is he?

1073
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:48,746
Supposedly, a dead man.

1074
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:51,688
Grandpa!

1075
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,285
No!

1076
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:04,864
- Grandpa, please.
- I'm so sorry, Nicole.

1077
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:06,998
I wasn't there
for you or your father.

1078
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:09,976
No no no. You were here
when I needed you the most.

1079
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,912
Grandpa, please. Grandpa, please,
I need you now.

1080
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:19,644
Somebody!
Somebody, help!

1081
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:23,951
Grandpa!
Grandpa, please!

1082
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:28,229
- Who did this, Billie?
- He did.

1083
01:24:28,296 --> 01:24:30,594
- Who?
- Rico, I shot him.

1084
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:32,462
He was right there
and now he's gone.

1085
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:36,604
# Knock knock #

1086
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:39,504
# Knock knock #

1087
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:41,371
# Who's there? #

1088
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:43,240
# Knock knock #

1089
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:44,938
# Who's there? #

1090
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:47,072
- Who's there?
- Me.

1091
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:54,315
Knock knock.

1092
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:55,981
Who's there?

1093
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:40,701
# You never change #

1094
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,031
# Yeah #

1095
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:52,504
# Oh here we go again #

1096
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:54,775
# For the thousandth time #

1097
01:25:54,849 --> 01:25:59,548
# I shouldn't have to teach you
how to treat me right #

1098
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:01,714
# All I do is give #

1099
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:04,189
# I can't take no more #

1100
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:07,422
# All the time you borrowed
from me just expired #

1101
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:10,123
# You never loved me #

1102
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:12,291
# Like I love you #

1103
01:26:12,367 --> 01:26:14,267
# Many many times #

1104
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:16,565
# I tried to walk away #

1105
01:26:16,638 --> 01:26:19,038
# Can't no one love you #

1106
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:21,166
# Like I love you #

1107
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:23,472
# You pick me up
to break me down #

1108
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:26,036
# And kiss the tears you make #

1109
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:29,106
# Sometimes I feel
I am the only one #

1110
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,845
# That cannot see through #

1111
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:32,546
# The lies,
the stories #

1112
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:35,589
# And the shady things
you always do #

1113
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:39,491
# Just when you trick me into
thinking that you'll change your ways #

1114
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:41,859
- # Never change #
- # You just mess up again #

1115
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:44,125
# And bring me back
to all my pain #

1116
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,633
# So much pain #

1117
01:27:03,117 --> 01:27:05,017
# Baby baby #

1118
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:07,748
# You could save me #

1119
01:27:07,822 --> 01:27:10,313
# Please say that you
love me tell me you need me #

1120
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,222
# Why can't you say
how you feel? #

1121
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:13,920
# It hurts so bad #

1122
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:17,158
# My heart is breaking #

1123
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,961
# How many tears
should I cry? #

1124
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:21,433
# 'Cause I'm dying inside,
you're killing me #

1125
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:23,663
# You never loved me #

1126
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,797
# Like I love you #

1127
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:27,773
