1
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,431
I respectfully disagree.

2
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,573
Two plus two equals four
because we agreed upon it.

3
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,308
Which doesn't make it true.
It is a concept.

4
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,714
Two plus two equaling four
is a primal equation.

5
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,321
Man didn't create it.
We discovered it.

6
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,949
Like it or not,
there are natural patterns...

7
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,423
...and things will always happen
a certain way.

8
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,628
Oh, be careful with always.

9
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,926
Oh, when I say always, I figure
it's a given 99 percent of the time.

10
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,662
Oh, so you are agreeing
that there are exceptions to your rules.

11
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,068
Of course,
but the virtue of the exception...

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,730
...is that it proves the rule.

13
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,803
Let's be thankful
that the greatest artists...

14
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,913
...to ever live would not agree.

15
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,418
They're confined to four rules.

16
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,985
You don't paint past here...

17
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,952
...here, here or here.

18
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:35,493
You know, I'd be so bold to say
that there can be no art without rules.

19
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,363
Are you gonna put that out
before they put you out?

20
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,664
It's against the law.

21
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,865
- Is it bothering you?
- I hate smoke.

22
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,739
Good enough.

23
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,750
What are you drinking?

24
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,148
Well, I was drinking red wine.

25
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,312
- You like red?
- I do.

26
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,856
I'll make you something red.

27
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,325
What do you do?

28
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,405
I work in the man--

29
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,905
I work in the brand-management
business.

30
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,469
And what would you do
if you didn't do that?

31
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,672
That's a good question.

32
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,012
I don't think the bartender
likes the fact you're doing his job.

33
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:39,084
Let's see what he says,
if he will act on his unhappiness.

34
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,500
Did anyone ever tell you Michael
is an unusual name for a woman?

35
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,538
Oh, that's a long story.

36
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,006
Let's start with a shorter one.

37
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,907
Okay.

38
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,374
What do you do?

39
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,279
What I want.

40
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,590
Julian.

41
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,629
- Hi, handsome.
- Hey.

42
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,893
Sorry I'm late. Not a good impression
for our first official date.

43
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,469
That's fine. Brenda, this is Michael.

44
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,662
Michael, Brenda.

45
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,137
- My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

46
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,072
Oh, no, please.

47
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,613
I wouldn't be a gentleman if you had
to pay for your own Shirley Temples.

48
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,774
Thank you. That's very nice of you.

49
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,044
Thank you.

50
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,417
- It was very nice meeting you, Brenda.
- Oh, take care.

51
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,354
God, she's gorgeous. Where
do you two know each other from?

52
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,462
I don't. We just met.

53
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,789
Well, traffic was a mess.

54
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,299
They're saying that the freeways
are going to be totally gridlocked.

55
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,266
- Who's they?
- What?

56
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,429
You said they. Who's they?

57
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,006
They reported it on the news.

58
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,040
I wouldn't believe
everything they say...

59
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,201
...especially
if you don't know who they is.

60
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,404
- Even the news?
- Especially the news.

61
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,980
- Oh, come on.
- Shall we?

62
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,810
Sure.
What do you wanna do tonight?

63
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,714
I don't know, we'll figure something.

64
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,354
- Well, I have a few ideas.
- Yeah?

65
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:17,921
And one of them is...

66
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,255
...how about we do
whatever you want me to.

67
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,359
Oh, my God. Julian.

68
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,764
Don't stop. Just like--

69
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,995
Don't stop.

70
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,433
Don't stop. Don't stop.

71
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,630
Don't you stop--

72
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,641
Oh, my God. Julian?

73
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:47,945
Julian, are you okay?

74
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,679
Me...

75
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,681
Oh, my God. My God.

76
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,488
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I just...

77
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,097
- Just, just...
- Okay, okay.

78
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,191
Fuck.

79
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,661
Oh, fuck.

80
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,604
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

81
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,669
What can I do for you?

82
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,708
You should probably go.

83
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,816
I think a lot of people
have been getting the flu.

84
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,149
I hope you don't get really sick.

85
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,700
- Honey, are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

86
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:37,893
Yeah, I'm fine.

87
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,868
If you need anything,
will you call me?

88
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,063
Thanks.

89
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,333
- Call me if you need anything--
- Okay, I will.

90
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,875
I'll come right back, okay?

91
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:47,636
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,305
No, no, no. It's okay.

93
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,348
I hope you feel better.

94
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,910
Get better.

95
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,758
<i>Hey, it's Lynn Wright.</i>

96
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,529
<i>I'm not here right now,</i>
<i>but I'll get back to you.</i>

97
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,247
- Did E.J. tell you what this is about?
- No idea.

98
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,445
No, me neither.

99
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,487
It's Praylis.

100
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,182
- Bullshit.
- No, it is.

101
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,953
Stand up. You're about to see
what real dicks look like.

102
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,756
- Oh, my God.
- What's with your hand?

103
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:45,955
Nothing.

104
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,759
- Praylis is here.
- They know, Greg.

105
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,267
That's Mr. Praylis to you, Greg.
Here you go.

106
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,696
- Larry, tie, tie, tie.
- Good luck.

107
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,834
All right, here we go.

108
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,739
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
Larry Green, our firm's top counsel.

109
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,009
Morning.

110
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,244
- Julian Wright, our chief strategist.
- Hello.

111
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,513
Mr. Praylis, you know.

112
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,055
And his representatives
from the Praylis Group...

113
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,318
...Mr. Clark and Mr. Franklin.

114
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,089
Did I get all those names right?

115
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,124
You'd think
I'd be better at that by now.

116
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,359
Okay.

117
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,566
- May I?
- Please.

118
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:31,332
The Praylis Group is looking
to consolidate its creative premium...

119
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:35,577
...by absorbing a boutique company
like ourselves into the fold...

120
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,582
...to manage all of their brands.

121
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,853
Now, where we need
the most assistance...

122
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,082
...is with our older brand identity.

123
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,251
Which has been misaligned
in trying to target a different market.

124
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,896
We've lost resonance
in our established market...

125
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:55,090
...along with brand-equity
in those products in the last year.

126
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,862
- You're referring to your detergents?
- Exactly.

127
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:02,133
Which are all iconic products
in the American marketplace.

128
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,373
You built those brands
on the strength of American ideals.

129
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,638
On quality and dependability.

130
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,508
Consumers still value those ideals.

131
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,741
How they represent,
experience the product...

132
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,886
...must be more contemporary
and relatable.

133
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,613
Sell the contemporary culture
you already represent.

134
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,949
America has a new face...

135
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,888
...but no specific culture
in which to experience it.

136
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,793
Americans buy ideas that represent
who they want to be, not the product.

137
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:35,273
I'm only considering two companies
to bring into the Praylis fold.

138
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,342
This one,
and the Innovative Identity Group.

139
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,742
In three weeks, both companies
will come together in the same room.

140
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,973
Pitch against one another
their strategies...

141
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,675
...on how to reposition and rebuild
our older brands...

142
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,582
...as well as how to maintain
our newer brands.

143
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,723
The company
with most appealing strategy...

144
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,859
...will be absorbed
by the Praylis Group...

145
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,018
...and given an account of $5 billion
over the next five years...

146
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,788
...to oversee all marketing.

147
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,226
You have till the end of the day...

148
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,698
...to let us know
if you accept this proposition.

149
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,534
Okay. We'll speak soon.

150
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,977
You're aware I'd like to prepare
a preliminary deal before presentation.

151
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,342
Of course.
We'll wait to hear from you.

152
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,006
- Good day.
- Pleasure to meet you.

153
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,779
- Good to meet you.
- Good to see you.

154
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,394
Oh, my God.

155
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,498
All right, I'm sure we have 5 billion
things to talk about. Call me later.

156
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,571
Never told me
you were thinking of selling.

157
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,800
Well, they offered me
$35 million to buy me out.

158
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,376
And you, as the head
of his Creative Department...

159
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:50,811
...are gonna be running
a $5 billion account.

160
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:52,207
Excuse me?

161
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,790
I'm retiring, Julian.

162
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,652
You're gonna be running Creative
at Praylis.

163
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,491
They've already agreed
to give you a 20 percent partnership...

164
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,327
...as soon as you deliver.

165
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,062
And I, of course, will have
a nice little share of that as well.

166
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,900
Oh, my God.

167
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,934
Well, I wasn't expecting this.

168
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,042
You just weren't expecting it
quite so soon.

169
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,407
I don't know how to thank you.

170
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,275
Yes, you do. Win.

171
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,111
Sit down.

172
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,120
Look, I know you know this...

173
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:37,228
...but the Praylis Group
is an extension of their consumer.

174
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,886
They're a family business.

175
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,592
And they're run
on American family values.

176
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:47,865
So if we do this, we will be expected
to adopt those same values.

177
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,564
Of course.

178
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,609
You'd have to postpone your divorce
until we settle this deal.

179
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,441
Can you do that?

180
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,105
I could.

181
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,817
Any chance at a reconciliation?

182
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,445
Nope.

183
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,223
Nope. All right.

184
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,950
I didn't think so.

185
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,118
All right, we'll just have to...

186
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,493
We'll go very carefully with this.

187
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:20,063
So congratulations and yippee...

188
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,003
...and balloons and blow jobs
and confetti and shit.

189
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,837
But what does this mean
for the rest of us, huh? Come on.

190
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,876
Blow job, please.

191
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,641
Look, guys, the reason I brought you
all here tonight...

192
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,479
...is I wanna assure you
that no matter where I go...

193
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,645
...you're all coming with me,
whether you like it or not.

194
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,484
Nice.

195
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,250
Well, I'm gonna be honest.

196
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:46,023
I am not crazy
about the possibility of Praylis...

197
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,224
...and their soap
being our only client.

198
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,426
- That's boring to me.
- Oh, Cheryl.

199
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,868
The opportunities are endless
with this setup.

200
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,371
- Right? Thank you very much, Larry.
- Yeah.

201
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:01,036
Oh, and, hey, I have got
an ex-girlfriend from college...

202
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,011
...that's working
at Innovative Identity Group.

203
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,584
- You know, we can just--
- Greg.

204
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,276
- Just kind of--
- Greg.

205
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,580
No.

206
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,724
- So let's say this actually happens.
- Which it will.

207
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,951
- Will there be promotions?
- Of course.

208
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,358
But, Cheryl, I'm sorry.

209
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,159
You get a big raise,
but you're stuck with me.

210
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,365
Can't make it without you.

211
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,997
That's really cute.

212
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,866
- Nice. Thank you.
- Look at that.

213
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,166
Strangely enough,
that's exactly how I want it.

214
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,774
- Call me crazy.
- Yeah, crazy.

215
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:35,004
Well, here's to good times
we've had.

216
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,580
- Yes.
- And great times to come.

217
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,842
- Yeah. Cheers.
- Thank you.

218
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,315
You can't toast with water, dude.
It's bad luck.

219
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,787
- I'm on the clock, Larry.
- I am too.

220
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,951
Unless anyone else has got anything
to add, it is Friday night after all.

221
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,494
I'll see you all Monday.

222
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,894
Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna see
if I can catch anyone at Serenade.

223
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,127
- It's Bobby's birthday. You coming?
- Nope, I'm gonna do some work.

224
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,430
Come on. Come with us.

225
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,072
You've got to celebrate.

226
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,867
I'll be celebrating in my own way.

227
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,509
Julian, let me talk to you.

228
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,871
Yeah.

229
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,471
What happened with Brenda?

230
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,344
Is everything okay?

231
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,444
- What do you mean what happened?
- She called Tracey.

232
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,648
My wife, being who she is,
was chatty about it.

233
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,816
I know Lynn
just sent the paperwork through.

234
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,928
So I just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

235
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,259
I'm fine, Larry. I'm fine.
It's been a year.

236
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,599
You're right. I know.

237
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,498
Of course it has. Life goes on.

238
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,639
Well, look, congratulations.

239
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,139
Get some sleep, you look like shit.
See you Monday.

240
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,944
- I will. Okay.
- Okay.

241
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,515
Ma, it's me.

242
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,348
Ma.

243
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,702
Ma?

244
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,903
Fuck.

245
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,684
Ma?

246
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,523
Ma.

247
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,030
Oh, my heavens.

248
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:43,366
What? Julian, my heavens,
what are you doing?

249
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,037
I was calling you.
You didn't answer me.

250
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,509
Well, I couldn't hear you.

251
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,208
I was listening to the Lord's message
on this little box you gave me.

252
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,148
Well, perhaps you shouldn't
listen to it so loud.

253
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,246
I guess.

254
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,284
You look tired, honey.

255
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,323
You working a lot?

256
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,492
I got a lot of things happening.

257
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,391
That's really great.

258
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,092
So let me show you
what I called you about.

259
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,736
- Okay.
- Come on.

260
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,895
What, you couldn't tell me
on the phone?

261
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,906
I didn't wanna tell you.
I just wanna show you.

262
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,373
Can you believe you slept in here?

263
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,246
Time flies.

264
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,785
I look at you now
and I wonder how you even fit in here.

265
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,659
I remember
you were the sweetest little boy.

266
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,723
I remember you used to love to run
around the neighborhood naked...

267
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,889
...and I couldn't catch you.

268
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,762
You really scared me.

269
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,904
Really scared me.

270
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,732
<i>Mom.</i>

271
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,267
Mom.

272
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,548
Hey, Mom.

273
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,989
<i>Mommy?</i>

274
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,083
<i>Mom.</i>

275
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,490
<i>Oh, my God, Mom.</i>

276
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,761
Anyway, I didn't realize
how many things you left here.

277
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,065
It's almost as if you never did leave.

278
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,369
There are probably some items
you would like to take with you.

279
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,341
Where are my things?

280
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,577
Oh, you weren't listening,
were you?

281
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,846
I told you, Mr. Frank
put everything up in the attic.

282
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,080
Yeah.

283
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,817
You know,
I just want my living room back.

284
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,928
I thought we could turn this
into a playroom for your nephews...

285
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,327
...and paint it colors bright and happy,
you know.

286
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,834
- Well, you know what I think.
- What's that?

287
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,664
I think Rita and the boys
should just move in here, Ma.

288
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,898
- Rita and the boys are here enough.
- Okay.

289
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,110
But I'll call Mr. Frank.

290
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,809
Well, no, this is really your job.

291
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,851
Ma, weren't you listening?
I don't have time to do this.

292
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,080
I think you have to make some time,
son.

293
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,747
Mr. Frank will be much faster.

294
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,626
When did family become such
an inconvenience for you, Julian?

295
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,565
Throwing your money around...

296
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,797
...you think that makes you a man
and keeps a family?

297
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:33,344
I would have thought that losing
your wife would have taught you that.

298
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,173
Well, I guess not.

299
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,847
You keep your money.

300
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,184
I expect you to start painting this room
as soon as possible.

301
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,483
- I'll be in the kitchen.
- Okay.

302
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,456
Preparing dinner.

303
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,059
- What's that?
- It's...

304
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,661
It's nothing.

305
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,004
And stay for dinner, if you want.

306
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,874
Okay.

307
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,508
- Stay down, stay--
- Everything okay, Karami?

308
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,645
Oh, good morning, Mr. Wright.

309
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,804
Saturday morning, sir.
Don't you ever rest?

310
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,813
You crack me up, man.

311
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:46,010
Yeah, listen, Greg. Can you e-mail me
those Praylis projections again?

312
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,907
Yeah, I wanna go over them.

313
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,275
I don't know.
Just something isn't right.

314
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,781
No.

315
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,976
No, I did read that. Yeah.

316
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,657
I'm gonna call you back.

317
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,884
Don't do it, Victor. Don't do it.

318
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh, honey, please, get your own.

319
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,699
This is my bottle.

320
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,349
Can I help you with?

321
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,144
- Julian.
- Oh, my God.

322
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,477
What are you doing here?

323
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,147
I left my cape and teeth at home,
but I wanted to see a movie.

324
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,323
What? You introduce me?

325
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:15,990
Oh, my--

326
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,934
Okay. Julian, this is everybody.

327
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,436
Everybody, this is Julian.

328
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:22,971
- Hi, everybody.
- How are you?

329
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,608
Hi.

330
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,971
- Can I sit?
- You wanna stay?

331
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,578
Love to.

332
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,146
She's Thalia.

333
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,709
Nice to meet you.

334
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,377
Yeah, hi. Nice to meet you.

335
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,685
What are we watching?

336
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,060
This is my favorite, <i>Frankenstein</i>.

337
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,857
- <i>Frankenstein</i>.
- Yes.

338
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,131
Would you care for a glass of wine?

339
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,773
I'd love one. Thank you.

340
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,539
Oh, spare.

341
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,055
- Did you like it?
- I did.

342
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,962
I've always loved this movie.

343
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,134
It is hilarious.

344
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,739
So this is your idea of a good night?

345
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,410
You Americans, I mean,
your obsession with goodness.

346
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,806
What?

347
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:39,780
Goodness is only a requirement
for acceptance, not greatness.

348
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,879
How so?

349
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,917
So take Dr. Frankenstein.

350
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:51,194
He creates a monster that he rejects,
because the monster mirrors himself.

351
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,457
Therefore, the monster
becomes angry and disruptive...

352
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:58,501
...until the doctor looks at the monster
and finally sees himself.

353
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,968
Only then is his greatness restored.

354
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,939
I better watch that film again.

355
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,615
We must always be
who we really are...

356
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:18,950
...even in the chaos,
for that is where we create.

357
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,489
Michelle.

358
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,387
- He's talking to you?
- I'll be right back.

359
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,396
- You okay?
- Yeah.

360
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,899
I thought we were done with him.

361
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,509
Hey.

362
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,310
Get your hands off her.

363
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,209
Julian. It's okay.
I just need to talk to him.

364
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,545
Hey.

365
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,182
Jesus Christ.

366
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,849
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Don't hit people.

367
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:58,928
- Holy shit.
- Good Lord.

368
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,155
He's out cold.

369
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,324
But we're okay. Thank you.

370
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,833
Everyone can go now.

371
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,130
- All right, guys, let's move him.
- No, don't touch him.

372
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,370
He's probably got a concussion.

373
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,909
Just someone call 911,
and get some ice.

374
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,376
- Ice?
- Yes.

375
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,676
Okay, let's go get some fucking ice,
all right?

376
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,284
- Ice. Okay, sure.
- We'll be back.

377
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,689
This is fucking ridiculous.

378
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:49,110
Just drive slowly. No, it's fine.

379
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,122
Were you a Boy Scout?

380
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,092
That's very funny.

381
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,560
So who is Frenchie?

382
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,363
Joseph.

383
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,298
Well, I got that part.
But who is he to you?

384
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,871
A friend.

385
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,468
A friend you're dating or?

386
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,767
No.

387
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,140
Someone you used to date?

388
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:26,208
- Something like that.
- Something like that.

389
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,085
You hit him pretty hard.

390
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,983
I did.

391
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:35,617
I feel like I'm supposed to feel bad.

392
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,889
But I don't.

393
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,335
Where do you live?

394
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,403
Where is your house?

395
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,741
- Where's my house?
- Yeah.

396
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,750
Okay.

397
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,123
Okay, just--

398
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,159
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

399
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,491
I wrap it for now,
but you might need stitch too.

400
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,600
Yeah, it's...

401
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,261
Okay.

402
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,335
Can you hold here? Yeah.

403
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,302
Okay.

404
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,203
Perfect.

405
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:32,882
Okay.

406
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,575
Let me see.

407
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,148
- You want a drink?
- No.

408
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,552
I don't drink alcohol.

409
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,555
Your book collection's impressive.

410
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,026
Have you read all of them?

411
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,926
Most of them.

412
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,199
You looking for anything
in particular?

413
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,373
Did you decorate it yourself?

414
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,968
Interesting.

415
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,584
Oh, no, that's far enough.

416
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,346
What's in there?

417
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,219
All right, give me the key.

418
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,221
Why?

419
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,829
What's in there? What is it?

420
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,794
A dark room.

421
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,433
- Oh, you take pictures.
- I do.

422
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,796
Important ones, I guess.

423
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,195
- Open it.
- No.

424
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,807
- Why?
- Because.

425
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,071
Because what?

426
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,077
Where is your camera?

427
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,408
Why?

428
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,813
You are going to take
pictures of me.

429
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,413
No, I'm not.

430
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,020
Yes, you will.

431
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,598
Get your camera.

432
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,081
I want to know
what kind of pictures you take.

433
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,941
See how you see me.

434
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,771
You ever wonder
what is happening...

435
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,971
...at each one of those shiny
streetlights in the distance?

436
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:49,752
Who, at that moment,
is standing by that twinkling glow?

437
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:55,355
And does their life
mirror your life in any way?

438
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,294
Or...

439
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,061
...are we really alone?

440
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,187
What happened?

441
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,829
What do you see?

442
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:08,357
My mother was a concert pianist
before she got pregnant with me.

443
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,631
A proper married woman
shouldn't have any other focus...

444
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:17,264
...besides the desires
of her newborn and loving husband.

445
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:25,439
So her piano-playing went from
having her on the brink of stardom...

446
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,443
...to becoming a pastime
in our living room.

447
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:38,327
I have wonderful memories
sitting on her lap while she played.

448
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:44,734
Those are the only moments
I remember feeling close to her.

449
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,403
As the years went on...

450
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:53,971
...I heard less and less
of the piano...

451
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:58,775
...and more and more
of her drunken tirades.

452
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:08,787
For my 13th birthday,
my father gave me piano lessons...

453
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,953
...because I was determined
to learn to play like my mother.

454
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,890
The day I came home
from my first piano lessons...

455
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,394
...my mother was drunk.

456
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,334
As soon as I walked in the door...

457
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,913
...she slapped me to the floor.

458
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:39,083
I went to the bathroom,
shut the door and picked up a razor.

459
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,025
That was my first cut.

460
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:49,225
But the last one
was seven years ago.

461
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,863
You don't need to hide from me.

462
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,870
- I better go.
- No, stay.

463
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,669
- No.
- Stay, stay.

464
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,004
Please.

465
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,338
I can't.

466
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,291
- What do most Americans wanna be?
- Would you try--?

467
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,395
Spit it out. What do they wanna be?

468
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,861
- They wanna be rich.
- Rich. Great.

469
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,628
Yeah. What else?

470
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,632
And young, you know--

471
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,737
Young. Of course.

472
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,169
- Strong.
- Strong. Great, yep.

473
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,310
They wanna be respected.
I mean, I wanna be respected.

474
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,071
And successful.
They wanna be successful.

475
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,373
- Jules.
- Yes?

476
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,572
Can I have a word?

477
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:14,411
Larry, I am getting you those numbers.
As soon as Julian--

478
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,246
Reviews them.
Keep going, here, Greg.

479
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,615
- Well, I--
- Do it.

480
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,552
It's great.

481
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:21,582
Yes?

482
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,455
Were you in a graveyard
watching a movie recently?

483
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,653
- Yes.
- Yes.

484
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,627
Did you hit someone
in the graveyard?

485
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,630
- I did.
- Yeah.

486
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,495
Can you make it go away?

487
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,103
I found out that Joseph Marcell,
you know, the guy that you hit?

488
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,436
He's trying to become
an American citizen.

489
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,944
- Fantastic.
- So I called him and warned him...

490
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,278
...that pressing charges
could complicate his application.

491
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,419
Seventy-five hundred dollars
will make it go away.

492
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,023
- Send him a check.
- Yeah, I will.

493
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:59,795
Six years of school,
15 years of corporate and criminal.

494
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,797
We're nearly there, Julian.

495
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,434
You're gonna be rich. It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

496
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,004
- You're an idiot.
- This is fun.

497
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,041
Sis.

498
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,778
- Hey.
- Hey.

499
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,046
You need some help?

500
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,448
What's going on?

501
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,354
Nothing.

502
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,496
- Rita, what happened?
- Nothing.

503
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,961
I'm just gonna stay with Mom
for a couple days.

504
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,157
Where is he?

505
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,568
Julian, I just need a little space.

506
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,204
That's it.

507
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,862
How are you? Are you good?

508
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,667
Fine.

509
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,837
You look good.

510
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,740
What are you doing
with all that paint?

511
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,216
What do you think I'm doing
with that paint?

512
00:35:56,387 --> 00:36:00,016
Mom. She asked me
to paint the goddamn room.

513
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,288
- Hello?
- <i>Can you come see me?</i>

514
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,658
- I'm working.
- <i>You work too much.</i>

515
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,628
<i>Meet me.</i>

516
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,535
Well, where are you?

517
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,478
Park your car.

518
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,775
What are you doing?

519
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,545
You got to take pictures of me.

520
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,211
So now it's my turn.

521
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,823
Park.

522
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,119
How about you get in my car
and I take us wherever you wanna go?

523
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,821
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright.
That doesn't work.

524
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,056
But, Michael, I can't--

525
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,030
Mr. Wright, shut up.

526
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,896
And get in the car.

527
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,140
Welcome, Mr. Wright.

528
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,917
Thank you. Thanks.

529
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,036
- Michael.
- What?

530
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,469
Put the camera away.

531
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,101
Put the camera away.

532
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,339
Okay.

533
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,480
You look beautiful.

534
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,244
So do you.

535
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,053
I think you mean "handsome."

536
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,781
No.

537
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,927
Beautiful would be the way
to describe it.

538
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,495
So, what's this about?

539
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,831
It's about you.

540
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,728
But you have to trust me.

541
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,890
No, that's tight enough.

542
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,391
It won't hurt.

543
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,893
I promise it. It will be fun.

544
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,469
May I please have your hands?

545
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,160
No. No.

546
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,930
- Okay, okay.
- Hands are off-limits.

547
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,973
Just--
Can I just stay like this?

548
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:13,636
And promise not to touch.

549
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,479
You can't touch.

550
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,205
Really?

551
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:19,940
You can't touch.

552
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,813
- Okay.
- Okay.

553
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,788
- Michael?
- Thalia.

554
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,927
What the fuck?

555
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,420
Oh, shit.

556
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,162
Turn the fu--

557
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,199
- Michael, turn the fucking camera off.
- It's Thalia.

558
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,859
I can see who it is, thank you.
Turn the camera off.

559
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:51,736
- Okay. It's okay.
- Stop the fucking car, okay?

560
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:55,072
- You had your joke. That's enough.
- Wait, just for fun.

561
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,838
Yeah, funny.

562
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,083
- Thank you very much.
- Julian, come on.

563
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,881
Oh, my gosh.

564
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,681
Julian. Julian.

565
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:12,592
Hey, wait a minute.

566
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,765
Wait a minute.

567
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,729
I never, l--

568
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,099
I didn't know
you could be so offended.

569
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,570
Where are you going?

570
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:24,934
I don't fucking know.

571
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,174
Julian, come on.

572
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,811
Is--

573
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,248
I thought it would be fun.

574
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,748
Michael, go home.

575
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,745
Okay, but at least
let me take you back to your car.

576
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:43,056
I'm not gonna leave you here,
in the middle of nowhere, okay?

577
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,158
Okay, let's go.

578
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,103
- <i>Michael, turn the fucking camera off.</i>
- <i>It's Thalia.</i>

579
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,764
<i>I can see who it is, thank you.</i>
<i>Turn the camera off.</i>

580
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:03,277
- <i>Okay. It's okay.</i>
- <i>Stop the fucking car, okay?</i>

581
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,779
<i>You had your joke. That's enough.</i>

582
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,781
- <i>Okay, stop the car.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

583
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,950
<i>What's wrong?</i>

584
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:13,817
Enough, okay?

585
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,323
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- <i>Yeah, funny.</i>

586
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,154
Enough.

587
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,588
Okay?

588
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,428
You wanna play games? Is that it?

589
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:31,764
You think you wanna play games,
huh?

590
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:30,499
Does that feel good?

591
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,694
Fuck.

592
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,940
Who is she?

593
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,408
Who? Who is who?

594
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,484
The one you love.

595
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,057
There's no one that I love.

596
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:07,653
There is always someone.

597
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:11,262
Did she have the combination?

598
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:16,029
No, she didn't.

599
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,774
That's too bad.

600
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,706
Is that what you're after?

601
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:28,140
How can this really matter
without it?

602
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:21,502
So did you and Larry
have a successful morning...

603
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,664
...pondering the contractual points
of your new future?

604
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,070
We did.

605
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,177
Michael Reed left that for you.

606
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,438
Nice box.

607
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,083
How's Michael Reed's box?

608
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:35,616
Who is she?

609
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,949
Hi.

610
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,487
- Yeah.
- You...

611
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,719
You better call
Adrienne's florist for me.

612
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,418
Oh, yeah, I'd better. Okay.

613
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,028
Wow, look at you.

614
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,793
- What?
- I've just never seen you like this.

615
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,997
- What?
- Nice.

616
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,162
All right,
the Praylis' dinner's tonight.

617
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,968
- Are you taking Larry?
- No, I'm gonna take a friend.

618
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:01,736
- Oh, a friend.
- Yes, get the florist on the line.

619
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:04,437
If the friend has a name,
I need to know to RSVP.

620
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,344
- Winters will be there, okay?
- Great.

621
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,381
- Thank you.
- Just a heads up.

622
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,951
You're welcome, my darling.

623
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,517
"Your camera is old."

624
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:11,847
Hi.

625
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,374
May I help you?

626
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,384
Yeah, I'm looking for Michael Reed.
Does she work here?

627
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,545
Sometimes.

628
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:21,849
Is she here today?

629
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,788
No. Probably tomorrow.

630
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,355
She's at the L.A. City Museum
for a showing.

631
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,499
Can I give her a message?

632
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,997
Nope.

633
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,636
I'm going to have to leave something
for her.

634
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,234
Will you help me set it up?

635
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,558
Okay. Thank you for coming.

636
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,514
Everything's beautiful.

637
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,712
- Thank you.
- They're waiting. Come on.

638
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:30,115
Boyd, we really need to go.

639
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,062
Gotta go.

640
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:51,406
- Julian.
- Hi.

641
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,481
Oh, my goodness.

642
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,949
What are you doing here?
How do you know?

643
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:59,145
I went by the gallery.

644
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,627
That's great.

645
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:09,727
Who was that? Who was that?

646
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:11,895
What?

647
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,569
That guy you just kissed.

648
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,138
- Excuse me?
- Michael, who is he?

649
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,575
Okay.

650
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,146
- Okay, we need to talk, but--
- Let's talk.

651
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:26,976
- This is not the place, so...
- Sure.

652
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,447
I wanna talk here.

653
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,950
- I can't. I can't.
- Right now.

654
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:32,917
Michael, who was he?

655
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,553
- Tell me who he is.
- Julian, please.

656
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,888
- Well, just tell me who he is.
- Come on.

657
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,400
- I don't know why you're here.
- Michael, who is he?

658
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,937
- I can't talk to you now, okay?
- Where are we going?

659
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,597
- I'm working.
- Tell me who he is.

660
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,799
Let's talk tomorrow.

661
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,375
- Just tell me.
- Tomorrow.

662
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:55,943
Just tell me now, who is he?

663
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,410
- No.
- Just tell me who he is.

664
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,048
- I'm working.
- Tell me who he is.

665
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:01,912
- I need you to trust me.
- I trust you. Tell me who he is.

666
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,746
My husband.

667
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,879
I'm married.

668
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,087
I'm-- Oh, Julian, I'm sorry.

669
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,388
I just needed time
to find a way to tell you.

670
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,398
But it's not what you think, okay?
It's--

671
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:22,402
He knows everything.
He knows about you.

672
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,802
He knows about us.

673
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:28,342
- He knows what you mean to me.
- What the fuck does that mean?

674
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,642
What does that mean?

675
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,146
- Julian, please.
- What I mean to you.

676
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,648
- Don't do this.
- Oh, shit, Michael.

677
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,310
I know this is not easy.

678
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,718
- Stay the fuck away from me, okay?
- But--

679
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,017
Julian.

680
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:46,187
Julian. Julian, please.

681
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,565
Julian, I'm sorry, just...

682
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:52,065
- Stay the fuck away from me.
- Let's talk now, okay?

683
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,135
Don't go like that.

684
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:19,728
Yes, Mom.

685
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,727
<i>I need you to get over here now.</i>

686
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:24,799
<i>Tony might come</i>
<i>and the kids are scared shitless.</i>

687
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,931
- Ma, hang up--
- <i>Don't know what to do.</i>

688
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,106
Hang up, Ma. I'm calling the police.
I'm on the way, okay?

689
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,943
- Go get the kids!
- Tony!

690
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,743
- Don't get out.
- No!

691
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,417
You get in the truck
and nobody gets hurt, all right?

692
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,919
This is my goddamn family.
You stay away, all right?

693
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:49,922
Asshole.

694
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,726
Go, go, go.

695
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,886
Julian, stop it. You're gonna kill him.

696
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:55,898
Fucking hero again, huh?

697
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,065
Julian.

698
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,336
Don't move. Stay right there.

699
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,302
Julian, you're gonna kill him.
Stop it.

700
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,840
Kill him! Kill him!

701
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,740
- Julian! Julian!
- Kill him!

702
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,211
- Get back inside.
- No, Rita.

703
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:14,742
Kill him!

704
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,652
Kill him!

705
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,419
- Kill him!
- I fucking told you.

706
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:33,293
Mr. Wright,
it's time for your phone call.

707
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,932
I'm not ready.

708
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,769
- Excuse me?
- I said, I'm not ready.

709
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,378
Suit yourself.

710
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,972
Meet me in the office in 30 minutes.

711
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:08,191
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

712
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,596
Come here.

713
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:17,996
Come on.

714
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,577
Sit down.

715
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,825
You know when I said
I'd buy you a house?

716
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,902
Then I said
I'd buy you a Barbie house.

717
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,566
- Do you remember?
- We were kids, Julian.

718
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,171
I know, but it's time.

719
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:58,911
It's time I bought you a house.

720
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:03,243
- Really?
- I'm serious. Okay?

721
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,389
Yes?

722
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,116
Come on.

723
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,664
You haven't been charged
with anything...

724
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:19,699
...because Tony's still in a coma.

725
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:26,034
No investigation can take place
until he wakes up.

726
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:31,203
So is there a chance
he's gonna spend any jail time?

727
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:35,610
Look, with Tony's priors and
his history of violence towards Rita--

728
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,720
I mean, he very well could
have charges brought up against him.

729
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:41,118
So it's possible
this could all go away.

730
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,385
Possibly, yeah. Yeah.

731
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,221
No victim, no case.

732
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:47,659
But as of now, we're in limbo.

733
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:50,723
And Praylis?

734
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:56,065
We told him last night at the party
that you had a family emergency.

735
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,967
But obviously they're gonna find out.
They're gonna find out.

736
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,408
We should tell them
before somebody else does.

737
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,343
I mean, tell them the truth,
you know.

738
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:08,951
Tell them you were defending
your family and you were, right?

739
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:17,686
There is one part of this that is
gonna be tricky and that's the brick.

740
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:22,923
My understanding is that Tony
didn't even have a weapon...

741
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,760
...so the question is gonna be...

742
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:27,232
...did you really need to use
that much force?

743
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:33,933
I'm confident that if he lives,
you'll avoid jail time.

744
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,509
But if he dies...

745
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:39,207
...it's a completely different story.

746
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:41,943
Hey.

747
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:47,187
I need to know
that you're gonna pull it together.

748
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,349
And make this deal happen
for chrissake.

749
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,757
You don't ever bring
your personal affairs...

750
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,794
...into your business life, Julian.

751
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,556
Ellison.

752
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,059
- Okay, it won't happen again.
- Good.

753
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,532
Get focused.

754
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,641
Morning.

755
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,512
- Morning, Cheryl.
- Hey.

756
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,242
You okay?

757
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:07,629
One second.

758
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,503
Hey, Rita's on Line 1.

759
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,271
- Hey.
- <i>Hey, I found a house.</i>

760
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,413
- Oh, what, already?
- <i>Yes. It's beautiful.</i>

761
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,604
- You did?
- <i>Yes.</i>

762
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,045
- Got a picture?
- <i>No, I need you to come see it.</i>

763
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:22,241
No, e-mail it.

764
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:24,784
<i>Julian, I can't e-mail.</i>
<i>What are you saying?</i>

765
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,451
Rita, hold on.

766
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,486
Yes, Julian?

767
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,629
Cheryl, have Security
remove her immediately.

768
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:36,491
She's the woman who--

769
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:39,635
- Cheryl, just do it.
- Yep, yep.

770
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,739
Yeah, I need two guys immediately,
front desk.

771
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:46,875
Yeah. Bye.

772
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,012
Rita, I'm sorry. You were--

773
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:56,481
We were-- Where were we?

774
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,711
- <i>The house?</i>
- Yes?

775
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,788
- <i>Yes, Julian, it's expensive.</i>
- No, don't worry about the money.

776
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,857
Everything's negotiable.
Leave that to me.

777
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,687
<i>I need you to see it. You have to--</i>

778
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:07,329
- No, the main thing is that you love it.
- <i>Well, I do--</i>

779
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,863
Look, I gotta go.
I gotta get back to work.

780
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,866
- I love you, okay?
- <i>I love you. All right.</i>

781
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:59,138
You need to come up for air.
You've been stuck in here all day.

782
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,351
Have you eaten?

783
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:06,749
Okay, I'm gonna get you
some food...

784
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:10,086
...and if I have to spoon-feed you,
I will.

785
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:25,132
- Anything you wanna talk about?
- Cheryl, please, I need to finish this.

786
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,407
Don't do that.

787
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:36,215
As much as you've been there
for me...

788
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:38,649
...it's not fair for you
to treat me like that...

789
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:40,482
...because I want to help you.

790
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,691
Okay?

791
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,151
Don't worry about locking up.
I'll do it.

792
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,763
Cheryl?

793
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,030
I'm sorry.

794
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,710
Thank you for the flowers.

795
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:18,125
What happened to you?

796
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,258
Julian, I know what you think,
but it's not what it seems.

797
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:25,298
My husband and I
have an understanding.

798
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:29,403
I understand if that's something
you can't handle.

799
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,972
But I am not a liar.

800
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,904
And I am not an adulterer, okay?

801
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:35,771
Fantastic.

802
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:38,575
You should meet him.

803
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:41,443
You are un-fucking believable,
you know that?

804
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,381
We don't have
conventional agreements.

805
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:46,487
Oh, so that makes it right?

806
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,517
Right? Right?

807
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:53,290
What is right? What is right, Julian?

808
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:56,993
People live right every day
and they still aren't happy.

809
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,994
We get to decide what is right for us.

810
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,693
Lf...

811
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:06,865
If you make my life better
and I make your life better...

812
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,301
...what is wrong about that?

813
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:13,271
What else are relationships
supposed to be?

814
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:18,315
If you don't like this, fine.

815
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:21,790
But don't base it
in all those arbitrary standards...

816
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:27,225
...we are forced to believe
are contracts of some kind.

817
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,561
Julian, look at me.

818
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:38,368
I can love you as hard as you want.

819
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:43,712
It just won't be in the form
people say it should be.

820
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:54,522
You deserve to have me.

821
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,387
And anything else you want.

822
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:04,192
I need you.

823
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:50,706
No, I'll stay here.

824
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,177
Yeah.

825
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:54,547
When are you coming home?

826
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:59,780
No, I haven't forgotten.

827
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,988
I love you too.

828
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,393
I'll see you Sunday, okay?

829
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:53,640
You want to?

830
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,505
No.

831
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,084
Let's get a Christmas tree today.

832
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:09,247
I hate Christmas.

833
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:15,387
I promise,
this Christmas will be different.

834
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,510
Okay.

835
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,449
Enough.

836
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,718
Let's get dressed.

837
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:00,092
Oh, my God.

838
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:03,893
Keep them closed.

839
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,432
Not yet.

840
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:15,167
Almost...

841
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:18,802
And now.

842
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,352
When did you do this?

843
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:28,490
A king never asks how or why.

844
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:31,455
He just sits and enjoys.

845
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,492
So please.

846
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:42,895
It's amazing.

847
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,036
There you go.

848
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:56,876
What?

849
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,251
Open.

850
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:03,991
Your eyes are so beautiful.

851
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:07,788
They draw me in.

852
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:11,256
But they won't let me see you.

853
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,467
And I want to see all of you.

854
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:25,870
When is your birthday?

855
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:29,183
September 19.

856
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,648
Virgo.

857
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:37,725
Okay.

858
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,260
Do you like what you do, Julian?

859
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:44,592
Does it make you happy?

860
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,530
My job? It's work.

861
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:49,432
It pays the bills. I'm good at it.

862
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,072
I do what's required.

863
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:55,642
Who determines what's required?

864
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:58,711
What do you love?

865
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:02,213
What is your passion?

866
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,251
I love being with you.

867
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:10,491
What's your passion?

868
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:17,826
Having you say
you love being with me.

869
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,704
Do you like kids, Michael?

870
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:28,066
Yeah, I do very much.

871
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:30,404
Do you wanna have children?

872
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,243
I probably won't have any.

873
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:35,576
Why not?

874
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:40,154
I think I am a better mom to adults.

875
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:48,293
My nephews are having
a birthday party...

876
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:50,364
...at my mother's tomorrow.

877
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,193
Would you like to come?

878
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:57,430
- Yeah.
- You do?

879
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:58,971
Yeah, I'd like that.

880
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:01,299
Kiss me.

881
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:29,895
Interesting how it's our job...

882
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:33,166
...to make people believe in things
that aren't necessarily true.

883
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:36,607
It's why I stopped doing criminal law
and started corporate law.

884
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:40,408
I didn't wanna protect the guilty
and convict the innocent anymore.

885
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,413
Okay, Larry. What are you saying?

886
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:46,520
I got a phone call from a Steven Carter
from Innovative Identity Group...

887
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:49,088
...asking me about you
and a Michael Reed.

888
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,692
- It's none of your business.
- Julian? Yes, Larry?

889
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,919
Stop seeing her.
Why? Because she's married.

890
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,087
I don't know,
Mr. Praylis doesn't like that?

891
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,028
Larry, it's none of your business.

892
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,667
Are you trying to sabotage this?

893
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:02,360
Because you are doing
a fucking wonderful job.

894
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:04,369
Great job.

895
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:08,267
Are you forgetting who put you here in
your big house with your lovely wife?

896
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,843
- You wanna jog memories?
- Yeah.

897
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,206
Remember who you called...

898
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:14,042
...when you found your wife
and her boyfriend in your bed?

899
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:15,774
- You called me, me.
- You--

900
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:17,179
Do you remember that?

901
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:21,186
You haven't gotten over that.
Now you wanna drag us into this shit?

902
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:28,721
- Dude, look--
- You and this whole company...

903
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:31,161
...have been riding on my back
for five years.

904
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,960
You got a short fucking memory.

905
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:36,470
- Julian.
- Don't fucking tell me what to do.

906
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:40,005
I hate to break it to you, Julian,
but this isn't a one-man fucking show.

907
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:41,506
Okay? This isn't your show.

908
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:43,406
You have a team of people
out there...

909
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:46,605
...that need you to think
outside your fucking dick.

910
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:49,444
- You'd better go.
- No, I'm not gonna go.

911
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:51,308
Tomorrow morning at 10:00...

912
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,650
...we have the fucking biggest meeting
of our lives.

913
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:58,992
I'm gonna pick you up.

914
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:02,558
And you better be fucking focused.

915
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:05,824
Larry...

916
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:15,174
Hey, Uncle Jay.

917
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:18,438
Hey, we heard there's a birthday party
on here today.

918
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:19,911
- Is that right?
- Yes.

919
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:22,380
- Is it? Well, who's birthday is it?
- Ours.

920
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,041
Oh, it's your birthday.

921
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:25,914
- Is it really?
- Yes.

922
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:27,487
Are those gifts for us?

923
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:29,920
Are those gifts for you?
I don't see anybody else.

924
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:32,117
- Is there some? No?
- Can we open them?

925
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:34,888
Right after you've said hello
to my friend Michael.

926
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:36,963
Michael, this is Daniel.

927
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:38,599
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

928
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,359
- And Derrick.
- Nice to meet you.

929
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,265
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

930
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:43,904
Yeah?

931
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:45,130
What?

932
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:46,899
Are you Uncle Jay's girlfriend?

933
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,678
What?

934
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,904
I guess you could say that.

935
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,673
But enough about me.

936
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:55,976
Open your gifts.

937
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:57,642
There you go.

938
01:15:57,819 --> 01:15:59,446
All right, give me a kiss, come on.

939
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:01,054
Happy birthday.

940
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,691
I like your new girlfriend, Uncle Jay.

941
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,587
They're a handful.

942
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:11,890
Rita, this is my friend Michael.

943
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,591
Michael, this is my sister, Rita.

944
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:15,168
- Hi.
- Very pleased to meet you.

945
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,396
Nice to meet you.

946
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,871
I will help you set it up.

947
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:22,010
I can't believe they're 10.

948
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:24,139
What'd you get them?

949
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:25,644
We got them a video game.

950
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,042
- Julian.
- What?

951
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:29,683
- I don't like video games.
- Come on.

952
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:31,113
Look at them.

953
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,945
This is awesome.
Look at that game.

954
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:35,783
Look at that.

955
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:40,592
You good?

956
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,356
I am, yeah.

957
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:44,931
He spoke to me today.

958
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,700
- And?
- And...

959
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:50,931
I think everything's gonna be okay.

960
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,700
- I don't think he'll press charges.
- Good, good.

961
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,570
It's looking good.

962
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:59,475
And he's gonna be in the hospital
for a while.

963
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:03,584
Doctor said he's gonna need some
taking care of when he comes home.

964
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:04,980
So...

965
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:07,144
Sorry, he's what?

966
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:13,460
Julian, don't look at me like that,
please. I just--

967
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,153
So what?

968
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:17,725
- I just--
- It's up to the father...

969
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:20,834
...to work things out, not us.
- There's nothing to work out.

970
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:23,164
- That's not your decision.
- And it's yours?

971
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:26,899
Okay. Listen, I will buy you
that house tomorrow.

972
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:28,804
- Julian--
- Tomorrow.

973
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,604
She took an oath, Julian.

974
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:33,179
Tony is her husband,
she has responsibility to him.

975
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:34,975
Mom, can you please just?

976
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,517
And what about his responsibility
to her? To those kids?

977
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,678
Look at those boys. Look at them.

978
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:42,016
This is not fair on them.

979
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,919
Children are resilient.

980
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:46,253
They're closer to God
than any of us.

981
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:49,295
I wouldn't consider simply surviving
as optimum parenting.

982
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:51,455
- Julian, please.
- No. No.

983
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:53,567
I see. I'm the reason
that Lynn left you.

984
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:56,568
I'm the reason that your life
has failed like it has.

985
01:17:56,738 --> 01:18:00,265
Who is responsible for the good things
that have happened to you, Julian?

986
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:02,535
I am, okay?

987
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:04,469
I am.

988
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:07,442
I'm going to pray for you.

989
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:09,277
I'm going to pray to God...

990
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,783
...that he doesn't knock you off
your high horse.

991
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,183
Yeah, you do that, okay?
You do that.

992
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,449
But this, this is not happening.

993
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:19,116
- This is not happening, okay?
- But, Julian, just...

994
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:21,285
This is not happening.

995
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:27,357
Rita?

996
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,094
Rita, did I say something wrong?

997
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:31,400
No, Ma, you didn't.

998
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,788
Can we talk?

999
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:51,017
I'm a big girl.

1000
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:53,821
- I'm not gonna break.
- Look, it's complicated, okay?

1001
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:56,926
What?

1002
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:58,794
Talk to me.

1003
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,272
Hey, Mom.

1004
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,183
<i>Oh, my God. Mom.</i>

1005
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,289
There are blessings in pain, Julian.

1006
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:27,019
You just need the strength
to open those locked doors.

1007
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:30,631
See what it is, know it and move on.

1008
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,133
Otherwise...

1009
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:38,364
...it will steal
what makes us beautiful...

1010
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:41,866
...and feed our monster.

1011
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,750
- I have to go.
- Yeah, I know.

1012
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:02,414
<i>Hello?</i>

1013
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:06,157
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I need to see you.

1014
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:08,655
Julian?

1015
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:11,355
Yeah, I need to see you right now,
Michael.

1016
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,194
Are you okay?

1017
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,499
- Yeah, I just--
- Julian.

1018
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:19,867
Yeah, Michael,
you don't understand.

1019
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,839
I need to see you right, right now.

1020
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:24,444
But I can't right now.

1021
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:26,410
I'm having dinner.

1022
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:28,105
Yeah?

1023
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:30,478
Yeah, with him?

1024
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:32,779
Yes, Boyd.

1025
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:35,155
Well, tell him you gotta go.

1026
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,821
It's important, Michael.

1027
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:39,722
<i>I can't.</i>

1028
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,988
This is a planned evening.

1029
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:45,064
If you want tomorrow, I can see you,
but not today.

1030
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:48,692
<i>Jul--</i>

1031
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:55,800
Help me.

1032
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:52,817
<i>This is Julian Wright.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

1033
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,137
Are you okay?

1034
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:22,872
Julian, have you seen my shoes?

1035
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,753
You should have called.

1036
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:28,083
I did.

1037
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:30,390
But you never answer.

1038
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:40,366
Hi, we've met before.

1039
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:49,469
Give me a call when you're finished,
okay?

1040
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,544
- I will.
- Okay.

1041
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:54,542
- Nice to see you again...
- Michael.

1042
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:55,876
Michael.

1043
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:10,925
We should talk.

1044
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:14,196
What's to talk about?

1045
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:16,997
Now, I thought we were being
free and open.

1046
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,662
Listen to me.

1047
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,104
I will not be kept.

1048
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:22,573
By anybody.

1049
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:24,775
Well, not by me you won't.

1050
01:26:27,282 --> 01:26:28,510
Something keeps you.

1051
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:44,792
- Open it.
- No!

1052
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:46,797
Hey, what the fuck, Michael?

1053
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:49,596
What the fuck is this, Michael?
What are you doing?

1054
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:50,795
I know, I know.

1055
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:54,908
What bullshit and what lies did you
tell your husband just to be here?

1056
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:58,208
This is so fucking stupid.

1057
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:01,644
I mean, thinking that anything with you
could possibly work out.

1058
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:06,084
I'm sick of your fucking bullshit too,
Michael, your stupid little games.

1059
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:09,155
Making me think you know
more than I do when the fact is...

1060
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:11,724
...you're more fucked up
than I'll ever be.

1061
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:17,157
You are so arrogant.

1062
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:18,458
And small.

1063
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:21,797
But you'll never make me
small enough...

1064
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:25,462
...to fit inside
your little automated world...

1065
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,609
...with your little
programmed beliefs.

1066
01:27:28,776 --> 01:27:31,802
Well, when did being decent
become so diminishing?

1067
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:34,107
You tell me
one successful relationship...

1068
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:40,619
...you have ever had with anybody
to be able to justify what is decent.

1069
01:27:40,788 --> 01:27:45,589
My husband and I have the decency
to allow each other the lives we need.

1070
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,728
No, but did you ever stop
for one second...

1071
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:49,954
...and think what I might need?

1072
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:52,122
- I thought you were a big boy.
- Oh, I am.

1073
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:55,269
- I thought you could be mature.
- Oh, you want me to be mature?

1074
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,165
How about you give us
a separate hole?

1075
01:27:57,338 --> 01:27:59,670
How about I fuck your ass
and he fucks your pussy?

1076
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:03,174
Maybe you'll even learn
to like us both at the same time.

1077
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:16,984
Michael, are you okay?

1078
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:29,967
Michael.

1079
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,741
Oh, shit.

1080
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:43,484
Fuck, Michael.

1081
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:47,721
Oh, Jesus Christ, Michael.

1082
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:51,290
Oh, fuck. Leave it there.
Leave it there, okay?

1083
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:53,450
Oh, shit.

1084
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:55,152
Michael.

1085
01:28:57,532 --> 01:28:59,693
Shit. Baby, look.

1086
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:02,233
Come in. Hey, come on.

1087
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:04,303
It's okay.
Somebody's gonna help you soon.

1088
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:08,340
- Jesus Christ, what's going on?
- Larry, call 911. Call 911.

1089
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:13,771
Yeah...

<i>Available physician's assistant</i>

1096
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:55,011
You will never see Michael again.

1097
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:01,651
And if you so much as try...

1098
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:06,456
...I will kill you.

Hey.

1105
01:34:32,566 --> 01:34:34,466
I'm sorry, Michael.

1106
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:53,679
Three, one, four, one, six.

<i>And lies.</i>

1116
01:36:20,407 --> 01:36:23,103
<i>And it all starts with my mother.</i>

1117
01:36:54,775 --> 01:36:56,504
Say something.

1118
01:36:59,346 --> 01:37:00,779
Please.

1119
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,494
I came home from school, Mom.

1120
01:37:16,096 --> 01:37:18,257
And I found you in...

1121
01:37:18,799 --> 01:37:19,925
<i>Mom.</i>

1122
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:23,400
Hey, Mom?

01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:31,509
Mommy?

1124
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,237
Mom.

1125
01:37:33,414 --> 01:37:35,439
Mom. Oh, my God, Mom.

1126
01:37:35,616 --> 01:37:37,641
Mom, get up.

1127
01:37:37,818 --> 01:37:39,410
Mommy, wake up.

<i>Mom, get up.</i>

1129
01:37:48,295 --> 01:37:49,990
Our father...

1130
01:37:51,765 --> 01:37:54,563
What did I do
that made you wanna kill yourself?

1131
01:37:58,372 --> 01:37:59,896
Look at me.

1132
01:38:00,074 --> 01:38:01,473
Ma, just look at me.

1133
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:06,537
- Who art in heaven.
- Okay.

1134
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:07,942
Hallowed be thy name.

1135
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:10,374
And then what does it say?

1136
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:11,575
Thy kingdom come.

1137
01:38:11,752 --> 01:38:14,778
"Ten-year-old boy
saves mother from gas leak.

1138

- Julian Wright, a hero.
- Thy will be done.

1139
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:21,559
- Pulled his mother...
- Amen.

1140
01:38:22,296 --> 01:38:23,729
...from a..."

1141
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:28,893
Before the police came, you told me
to yank the cord and to lie, so I did.

1142
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:30,434
I did, Ma, I lied.

1143
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:35,940
I lied to the police, to all my friends.

1144
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:37,967
And why did I do it, Ma?

1145
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:40,204
Because you asked me to.

1146
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:43,748
I did it because you asked me to,
and I didn't want it to happen again.

1147
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:46,113
- You shouldn't blame me.
- I shouldn't blame you?

1148
01:38:46,287 --> 01:38:47,379
Who should I blame? God?

1149
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:48,578
Is God gonna save us?

1150
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:49,916
God, what? God is love.

1151
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,614
- God's good.
- God's gonna save us.

1152
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:53,919
What fucking God
is gonna save us from that?

1153
01:38:54,094 --> 01:38:56,494
- Oh, my God.
- What God?

1154
01:38:56,664 --> 01:38:58,495
- Yeah, hit me, hit me.
- Stop, stop.

1155
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:01,635
God don't love you and I.

1156
01:39:03,737 --> 01:39:06,433
Do you have any idea
how hard it was to raise you two?

1157
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:08,040
No, I don't.

1158
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:10,438
And then you go off
and you get this degree.

1159
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:13,136
- You think you're better than me.
- It's not about that.

1160
01:39:13,314 --> 01:39:16,112
- But you know what? You're nothing.
- It's not about that.

1161
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:17,511
You're nothing.

1162
01:39:17,985 --> 01:39:19,748
I know I'm not.

1163
01:39:20,554 --> 01:39:22,818
Why? Why did you pull me out?

1164
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:24,617
Why did you pull me out?

1165
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:26,760
Why did you pull me
out of the oven?

1166
01:39:26,927 --> 01:39:30,886
- Why didn't you leave me there?
- Because I need you, Ma. I need you.

1167
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:36,360
Come on.

1168
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:42,205
Come on, hold me, please, Ma.
Just hold me.

1169
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:43,968
Please.

1170
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:46,310
Please.

1171
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:49,677
Hold me, Ma, hold me.

1172
01:39:51,185 --> 01:39:53,449
Oh, God.

<i>I have never believed</i>
<i>I deserved to be loved.</i>

1174

what I asked you to do?

1182

You did?
