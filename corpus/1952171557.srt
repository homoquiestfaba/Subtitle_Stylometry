1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,410
It just happened.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,380
I was putting a piece of bloody glass
into an evidence bag... it was still wet...

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,190
and it just broke and cut me.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,860
I had no idea at the time that
emery gable was hiv-positive.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,250
Stella, why didn't you tell me?

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,640
I thought I could handle it on my own.

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,670
I'm scared, mac.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,120
I know there are a lot of people
living with aids, and I just...

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,220
I don't think I have the strength to do that.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,800
I don't think I'm brave enough
to wait for a cure.

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,780
What is it you say to me?

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,190
"Panda eh-hees tharos."

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,930
You always have the strength...
you always have the guts.

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,030
Mesa...

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,570
inside.

16
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,820
If you need to leave work,
say take some time...

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,760
no.

18
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,950
I took a blood test.

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,410
It came back negative.

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,210
I'm still in that window.

21
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,240
I won't know for sure if I'm
hiv-positive for ten weeks.

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,520
Right now the only thing that's
keeping me sane is work.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,880
I'm here for you.

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,420
I know.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,700
All right?

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,530
mac just went in.

27
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,870
What's the deal?

28
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,050
Gunshot vic.

29
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,580
Male, approximately 30 years old.

30
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,120
Probably the guy who rents the place.

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,260
Neighbors think his name is noah hubler.

32
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,080
What do you mean they think?

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,610
They say he moved in a year ago, alone.

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,090
Hasn't been too social.

35
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,140
In fact, they say he's a pretty strange fellow.

36
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,120
Who called it in?

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,690
Mr.Macaluso.

38
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,260
Lives across the street.

39
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,380
He asked if we'd mention his plumbing supply 
business if reporters asked who found the body.

40
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,500
Everybody's got an angle.

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,070
Are you kidding me?

42
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,650
What the hell?

43
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,440
Most are passages from various bibles.

44
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,600
The koran-- the rest are a collection of quotes.

45
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,080
This one's from nostradamus.

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,240
It's pretty weird.

47
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,090
Wait.

48
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,770
I guess we can rule out robbery.

49
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,600
Save your film.

50
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,460
There's something else I think you should see.

51
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,060
Over herE.

52
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,080
I don't believe it.

53
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,960
Is this what I think it is?

54
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,360
Yup.

55
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,470
Well, if this is noah's house...

56
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,510
than this must be noah's ark.

61
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,810
There could be another body in there.

62
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,160
Looks like our boy had some 
serious end of the world issues.

63
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,900
I have no idea who would want to hurt noah.

64
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,330
H-he was a good man.

65
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,050
You didn't hear or see anything?

66
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,160
No, sir, we were on the ark the entire time.

67
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,600
How long have you been in there?

68
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Five days now.

69
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,560
Five days?

70
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,650
In there?

71
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,820
Why?

72
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,250
The flood is coming.

73
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,730
We had to prepare for the voyage.

74
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,630
You do know it hasn't rained 
in over four weeks, right?

75
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,840
Noah said it was divine retribution.

76
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,540
That god was going to bring forth his 
wrath once more to punish us for our sins.

77
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,210
He promised to take us to 
the mountains of ararat.

78
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,040
Where the ark came to rest 
following the great flood.

79
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,310
He spoke at the bible study 
convention last year.

80
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,560
He said he was building an ark, and those 
that wanted to be a part of the new world 
were welcome as passengers.

81
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,570
What's the catch?

82
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,290
Salvation was guaranteed to those who 
donated to the building of the ark.

83
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,210
How much did you donate?

84
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,940
For each couple, it was the same.

85
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,940
"YOU CAN SURVIVE THE END OF DAYS"

86
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,700
Looks like our man was quite popular.

87
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,630
Got 28 messages here.

88
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,950
I know you're there.

89
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,710
Call me back.

90
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,190
I don't know what you think you're doing, 
but I suggest you pick up.

91
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,180
We need to talk.

92
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,720
Ugh, don't make me come over there.

93
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,720
you've got to be kidding me.

94
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,220
Okay, let's just say it now to get it over with.

95
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,550
Smoking kills.

96
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,920
Yeah, but who killed him?

97
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,450
No idea and no id.

98
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,720
Any witnesses?

99
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:41,650
First on the scene says that a passerby up there 
describes what she saw as a giant cigarette 
on fire running for its life.

100
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,610
She dialed 911.

101
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,690
By the time we found him down here, he was dead.

102
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,070
Okay, so...

103
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:54,230
he fell, which could explain his two broken legs, 
and maybe that's what stopped the fire from spreading.

104
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,670
He was stubbed out.

105
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,970
Now, if this cat landed on his feet, 
and the fire didn't kill him......

106
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,270
then why isn't he breathing?

107
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,610
Take a look at this.

108
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,690
A one man antismoking campaign?

109
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,590
You got something?

110
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,620
Melted plastic.

111
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,120
Looks like our vic gave us directions 
to the primary crime scene.

112
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,510
Corporate headquarters for the national 
spirit tobacco company, one of the 
largest tobacco companies in the country.

113
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,830
You know what I'm thinking?

114
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,010
Smoking equals death.

115
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,100
Cigarettes are death sticks!

116
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,940
Maybe somebody in the company didn't 
like what our vic had to say.

117
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,530
Hey, stel.

118
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,310
You ever seen a green cigarette before?

119
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,780
Can't say that I have.

120
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,660
well, noah was taking these people 
for a ride, but it wasn't on the ark.

121
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,370
His flock all tested negative for gsr and 
they've asked if they can get back 
on the good ship loony tunes before sunday

122
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,240
'cause that's when the world's ending.

123
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,370
I told them they can reboard once 
the crime scene's cleared,

124
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,960
but what i really want to do is throw 
them all in the shower, and then a rubber room.

125
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,210
They're not crazy.

126
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,470
Maybe their personal belief is so 
strong it overrides their better judgment.

127
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,880
After all, faith...

128
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,920
is the foundation of religion.

129
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,620
Right.

130
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,870
But who really believes some guy in rockaway 
beach can predict how and when 
the world's going to end?

131
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,650
Apparently eight people do.

132
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,180
What matters is our killer might 
have believed it, too.

133
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,380
It would take 5,000 $20 bills 
to equal $100,000.

134
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,200
That's the exact amount each 
couple paid to get on the ark.

135
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,460
Well, maybe our killer couldn't 
get a ticket to ride.

136
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,100
Heard you got something for me.

137
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,820
Yeah, weitlaner retractor.

138
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,620
Is there any reason why I'd want 
one of your tools?

139
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,270
It's not mine.

140
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,030
I found it inside your vic.

141
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,420
Based on the healing characteristics of 
the surgical scars, I'd say it'd been 
in there at least a year.

142
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,420
You okay?

143
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,140
Yeah, I just threw down a meatball hero.

144
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,440
Got a little indigestion.

145
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,490
So I'm thinking whoever the hack was who did 
his shoddy gastric bypass, must have 
left it behind during surgery.

146
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,790
You send blood to tox?

147
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,920
On its way.

148
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,840
Uh, put him over there.

149
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,870
Besides your guy having more facial hair 
than all three members of zz top combined,

150
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,440
and a tattoo that makes no sense, 
I think we're good.

151
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,630
"Seven, ten."

152
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,450
Numeric code.

153
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,920
Could be something gang-related.

154
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,300
It's from the bible.

155
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,540
Book of genesiS.

156
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:03,190
"God said to noah, 'I am going to put an end 
to all people, "for the earth is filled 
with violence because of them.

157
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,090
' "And after seven days, the waters 
of the flood appeared on the earth."

158
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:08,890
Right.

159
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,960
Ou

160
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,850
The way the bodies have been stacking up here lately, 
I'd say your vic might have been on to something.

161
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,750
The signs are everywhere.

162
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:39,050
Like birth pangs experienced by expectant mothers, 
these tragic events are god's way of warning us

163
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,550
that we must prepare for the end of days.

164
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:43,990
Consider...

165
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:49,600
matthew 24:11, "and many false prophets 
will arise, and will mislead many."

166
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,480
Matthew 24:6, "and you will be hearing 
of wars and rumors of wars."

167
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:03,000
Matthew 24:7, "for nation will rise against nation, 
"kingdom against kingdom, and in various 
places there will be famine."

168
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,010
My friends...

169
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:10,960
I have accepted these signs as god's punishment 
for our sins, but he is not without mercy.

170
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:21,130
That is why I have been given the task of building a 
vessel that will allow many of god's creatures 
to survive what will be known as our rebirth.

171
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,250
If you have yet to see the signs, you will.

172
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,450
Have faith in god.

173
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,050
Now is the time.

174
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,650
The door is closing.

175
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,150
The clock is ticking.

176
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,620
sid?

177
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:39,600
Sid!

178
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,170
sid!

179
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,440
Sid!

180
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,690
Oh, sid.

181
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,510
Help!

182
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,210
I need some help in here!

183
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,880
Somebody help!

184
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,430
Hey!

185
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,990
He's in anaphylactic shock.

186
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,820
There's an epipen in that medical kit.

187
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,560
Hurry up!

188
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,670
sid.

189
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,660
Sid, look at me.

190
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,570
It's okay.

191
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,510
Look at me, look at me.

192
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,530
It's okay.

193
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,530
Epinephrine's going to wear 
off in about 15 minutes.

194
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,580
Call 911.

195
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:32,950
it's okay.

196
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,420
It's okay.

197
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,270
You're going to be okay, sid.

198
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,610
All right?I'll call your family.

199
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,690
Please, don't worry.

200
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,820
he ate something he was allergic 
to and went into anaphylactic shock.

201
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,950
I had to administer cpr, mac.

202
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,840
I mean, I called for help 
and there was nobody.

203
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,210
Nobody around and there was no time 
for a mouth piece or a ventilator.

204
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,190
I just...

205
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,700
stella, open mouth contact is considered 
very low risk for contracting hiv.

206
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,970
I know.

207
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,160
You did the right thinG.

208
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,900
If you hadn't acted, sid would be 
dead right now.

209
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,580
RighT.

210
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,330
I know you're there.

211
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,170
Call me back.

212
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,660
I don't know what you think 
you're doing, but I suggest you pick up.

213
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,270
we need to talk.

214
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,030
Don't make me come over there.

215
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,560
He said his name was bill walters.

216
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,460
We met in a bar in the financial district.

217
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:45,890
He said he developed a new skin moisturizer, 
and if I invested $10,000 into his multilevel 
marketing plan for the product,

218
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,050
my commissions would turn that 
$10,000 into $100,000...

219
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,420
but that never happened.

220
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,650
Did it?

221
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
I lost everything.

222
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,940
Ms.Demartino, pyramid scams are 
illegal in the state of new york.

223
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,430
Oh, god.

224
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,670
Look...

225
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,620
I've had a run of bad luck lately.

226
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,870
I needed the money.

227
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,920
I thought he was for real.

228
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,700
And when you found out he wasn't, 
you tried to get him on the phone, 
but he wouldn't call you back.

229
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,950
So what happened then?

230
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,110
Nothing.

231
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,740
No, not nothing.

232
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,180
You went to see him.

233
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,770
You said so in your last message.

234
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,700
"Don't make me come over there."

235
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,760
You want me to play it for you again?

236
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,880
I was desperate.

237
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,830
I didn't know what else to say, 
but I didn't follow through.

238
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:31,600
Well, then explain to me how your calls 
to the guy who stole from you ended 
two hours before he got killed?

239
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,970
It was late.

240
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,160
I went to sleep.

241
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,560
And I would have started calling him again 
this morning, if you hadn't told me he was dead.

242
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:47,690
According to sid's notes, gross examination of 
the lungs revealed cod was poisoning 
due to inhalation of dioxin fumes

243
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,610
when the latex cigarette suit was burned.

244
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:55,030
Also says here our vic was in the early 
stages of emphysema due to long-term 
exposure to tobacco smoke.

245
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,420
So he was a smoker?

246
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,360
Yeah.

247
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,630
At least two packs a day according to this report.

248
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,730
I don't get it.

249
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,040
What's a heavy smoker doing 
protesting a tobacco company?

250
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,350
Maybe he blames them for his emphysema.

251
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,010
Then why continue smoking?

252
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,700
I ran background on noah hubler.

253
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,410
The only records that exist are paperwork 
filed in the name of a non-profit organization

254
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,950
and some applications for 
wild animal licenses.

255
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,330
Prints give us anything?

256
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,270
Volumes.

257
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,690
Turns out our prophet's real 
name was patrick dent.

258
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,500
He had a long list of iases and 
an even longer rap sheet.

259
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:40,450
Guy's done it all: Vulture fraud in D.C., 
Pyramid schemes in new york, home renovation 
cons in miami, dot, dot, dot.

260
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,470
So...

261
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,870
makes for a long list of 
people who'd want him dead.

262
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,530
He ever serve any jail time?

263
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,480
Nothing serious, but he came close.

264
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,510
An se

265
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,040
Oh, I know.

266
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,850
Doesn't even look like the same guy.

267
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,660
He was collared for bilking senior citizens 
in a promissory note scam, 
but he was never sentenced.

268
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,270
Why not?

269
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,440
He disappeared.

270
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,070
Our man of a thousand faces was wanted 
for more serious crimes in new york.

271
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,890
So when word came down, the new 
orleans da agreed to an extradition.

272
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,700
Here's where it gets really interesting.

273
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:18,100
A day earlier than expected, an nypd 
detective shows up in new orleans with id, 
badge, gun, all the necessary paperwork.

274
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,110
So new orleans hands him over in the airport 
to what turns out to be a bogus detective.

275
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,110
Next day, when the real guy 
shows up, everyone's in the wind.

276
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,400
It was a con.

277
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:34,160
One that required someone the vic trusted 
to set it all in motion and pose as 
a detective escorting him back to new york.

278
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,530
Where he had his stomach stapled 
to change his appearance.

279
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,080
Smart guy.

280
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,820
Yeah, not smart enough to avoid a bullet.

281
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,660
so the soil on our vic's shoes turned out 
to be from the flower bed on the side of the house.

282
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,510
That eliminates one set of shoe prints.

283
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,630
What about the second?

284
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,800
They're industrial work boots.

285
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,990
Which could explain this cable tie I found.

286
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,250
The brand and color tells me it 
belongs to advantage power company.

287
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,020
And the trace from the flecks of 
the teeth belong to a tulip tree.

288
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,650
It's also known as queens giant.

289
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,060
Found in alley pond park in douglaston.

290
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,880
All right, so how did trace 
from douglaston end up in far rockaway?

291
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,920
Maybe our vic was getting work done?

292
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,140
No, no.

293
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,630
Power line technicians have assigned routes, 
so whoever owned these boots paid 
a special visit to our vic.

294
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,770
Let's find out why.

295
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,820
Melodee costanza?

296
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,580
Yeah.

297
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,680
How you doing?

298
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,210
detective messer.

299
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,770
New york crime lab.

300
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,360
Like to talk to you for a second.

301
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,610
Do me a favor, huh?

302
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,180
Tell me what you, uh, know about 
that guy right there?

303
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:24,780
He's dead?

304
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah, he's dead.

305
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,940
You sure about that?

306
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,110
Very sure.

307
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,690
you just made my whole day.

308
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,520
No.

309
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,480
My year.

310
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,540
Oh, well, I'm-I'm glad to help.

311
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,580
Why don't you explain to me your 
relationship with patrick dent?

312
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,860
You mean ricky white.

313
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,310
That's what he told me his name was.

314
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:46,060
A little over a year ago, I invested in 
what ended up being a ponzi scheme he a

315
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,190
Tell me about his partner.

316
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,990
Melissa clarke.

317
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,670
Those two took my entire life savings.

318
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,050
Yeah, well, my pop said, 
you can't cheat an honest person.

319
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,290
Yeah, well, I'm not going 
to get rich doing this.

320
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,570
Took me the better part 
of a year to find him.

321
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,850
You find him last night?

322
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,420
His lights were on, and his truck 
was in the driveway, so I knew he was home.

323
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,820
I figured he was just trying to duck me.

324
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,370
So that gave you the right to trespass?

325
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,990
My girlfriend left me when 
she found out we were broke.

326
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,790
I just wanted my money back.

327
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,210
What are you doing here?

328
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,570
I want the money you owe me.

329
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,130
I want it.

330
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,010
Where is it?

331
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,580
He told me he spent every dime building his ark.

332
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,510
That god told him the world 
was coming to an end on sunday.

333
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,910
You know, at first I thought this was another 
scam, but you could see it in his eyes.

334
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,070
He was serious.

335
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,280
He said he felt badly about what he did, and 
that I could get on with the other freaks for free.

336
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,220
I just wanted my money.

337
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,130
Right.

338
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,600
Which was spent on gopher wood and glue.

339
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,560
How pissed did that make you?

340
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,120
Obviously not as pissed off as your killer.

341
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,100
God bless him.

342
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,460
Any luck id'ing our john doe?

343
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,350
Not yet.

344
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,850
Had detective angell talk to security 
over at national spirit tobacco.

345
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,460
They said our guy was a nuisance, 
but not disruptive enough to call the police.

346
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,380
You get anything off his costume?

347
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,280
No.

348
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:14,040
The shiny residue on the burnt portion 
of the cigarette turned out to be hairspray.

349
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,320
One of the ingredients is butane.

350
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,050
So they used it as the accelerant?

351
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,080
But who carries around hairspray?

352
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,020
Some women do.

353
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,110
I was right.

354
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,140
It was a lugie.

355
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,280
What's he talking about?

356
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,840
Adam found a mucus stain 
just below the face mesh.

357
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:35,460
Dna came back to an unknown male donor, 
and gcms detected traces 
of tobacco and citric acid.

358
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,320
Fruit?

359
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,910
By itself, it doesn't look like much,
but this transfer turned out to be 
the same tobacco blend and charcoal.

360
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,380
Specifically, insta-light coals.

361
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,590
Tobacco, fruit and charcoal.

362
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,020
Hookah bar?

363
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,260
Already looked into it, and I found a place 
on 45th and 6th that uses what we found.

364
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,220
That's two blocks away from our crime scene.

365
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,790
They keep a list of customers?

366
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,350
Our

367
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,460
He's an employee.

368
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,340
How do you know that?

369
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,970
I talked to the owner of the hookah bar, 
and she told me that the customers 
don't handle the charcoals,

370
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:10,450
that the employees do, and it turns out 
that three of the employees 
weren't working at tod,

371
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,310
and one of the employees is a male.

372
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,690
no, I'd never seen him before.

373
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,500
Really?

374
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,350
Well, maybe this'll jog your memory.

375
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,400
Oh, yeah.

376
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,530
That's the douche bag in the cigarette suit.

377
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,260
Seems like you two were close.

378
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,840
You got a really great job here, damon.

379
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,080
Great location, hip clientele.

380
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,700
Being the manager, 
I'm sure you make a good buck.

381
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,550
Yeah, I do all right.

382
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,920
Uh, so someone protesting outside, telling 
your customers that smoking is bad for them

383
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,950
it would probably hurt 
your bottom line, right?

384
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,340
Maybe.

385
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,310
But I didn't touch the guy.

386
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,190
Really?

387
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,310
I have evidence that you spit on him.

388
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,420
I was on my way home from work.

389
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,320
You're going to die, man.

390
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,480
You're going to die.

391
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,240
These things'll kill you.

392
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,570
Give me back my cigarettes.

393
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,530
No way.

394
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,970
I just saved your life, man.

395
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,040
I saved your life.

396
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Screw you.

397
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,780
end of story.

398
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,410
And you never went back?

399
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,860
I stopped to buy another pack of cigs.

400
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,230
Then I went home.

401
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,300
Hawkes, what are we playing, 
who gets cancer first here?

402
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,840
Dna on our evidence came back to our vic.

403
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,410
I'm trying to identify a brand, 
maybe trace the purchase.

404
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:49,620
We also may be able to determine if burn 
produced the color change 
in the paper, turning it green.

405
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,550
good, good.

406
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,370
Let's make sure everybody gets hazard pay.

407
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,340
Stella?

408
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,570
What's up?

409
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,880
Besides the smoke detectors 
going off every five minutes?

410
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,950
Right.

411
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,240
I spoke to sid's wife.

412
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,440
He's fine.

413
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,170
Hospital's holding him overnight for observation.

414
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,880
Maybe I'm worried about nothing.

415
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,200
If the world is going to end on sunday, 
then, what difference does it make, right?

416
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,230
Well, my evidence is making a compelling case.

417
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,350
Oh, yeah?

418
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:35,280
Almost every dollar my vic took from his 
passengers is accounted for here with 
receipts for supplies to build the ark.

419
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,950
So what does he stand to gain from the scam?

420
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,010
That's just it.

421
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,980
I don't think he was in it for the money.

422
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,680
Everything about this guy says 
he was on the up-and-up.

423
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,180
He believed in what he was doing.

424
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,090
So, if he was a conduit to god, 
then why didn't god save him?

425
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,400
Well, the fact is, the ark 
was finished, his work was done.

426
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,790
Technically, he wasn't needed.

427
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,430
But that's not a theory 
I'm ready to subscribe to.

428
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,330
Maybe he was delusional.

429
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,280
This town is full of people 
who are hearing voices from god.

430
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,520
There's no evidence to indicate 
a psychological disorder.

431
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,240
You're always looking for 
the scientific explanation, mac.

432
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,230
Maybe, this case, there isn't one.

433
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,630
You remember that heaven's gate cult?

434
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,290
Seemed pretty normal, right?

435
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,460
Their leader convinced 39 people 
that it was the end of the world.

436
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,930
Yeah, and the nightly news convinces millions.

437
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,270
True.

438
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,830
Here's the anomaly.

439
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:30,860
Guys like marshall herff applewhite and jim jones... 
they convinced their followers to commit mass suicide.

440
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,510
My guy was trying to save lives.

441
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,400
Maybe it was his redemption.

442
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,740
For all the years he had been 
conning those people.

443
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,450
Ah, this goes deeper.

444
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,470
A man spends a year building an ark.

445
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,790
Recruiting people, animals.

446
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,330
That takes conviction.

447
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,010
Did you check the weather report?

448
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,190
There's no rain in the forecast for sunday.

449
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,280
In fact, it's the warmest month 
on record for this time of year.

450
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,020
testing determined our green 
cigarette is not on the market.

451
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,380
Is it a bidi or a homemade job?

452
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,540
Too sophisticated.

453
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,610
The tobacco is a glycerin blend with 
the usual 600 chemical additives,

454
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:23,660
including ammonia to aid delivery of the nicotine, 
and chocolate to mask the bitter taste.

455
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:30,520
It's got a carbon tip I've never seen before,
and the wrap is made from recycled 
paper manufactured in kentucky,

456
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,780
all special order for a company 
based here in the big city.

457
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,700
You're just teasing me with 
this big buildup, aren't you?

458
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,740
Take a look.

459
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,740
"National spirit tobacco company."

460
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,960
The same place our vic was protesting.

461
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,110
They're called...

462
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,210
spirit green.

463
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,490
Mother nature's brand?

464
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:02,150
That is the best hook since the competition 
subliminally inserted a naked man into 
their artwork to get the female smokers.

465
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,800
92% less tobacco than the regular cigarettes.

466
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,560
The paper is biodegradable.

467
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:14,210
Low odor, and low impact means that the 
tobacco is heated instead of burned,

468
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:19,180
so the smoker gets the sensation of smoking 
without the harmful burn effect on 

469
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:24,070
Imagine, it'll take ten spirit greens to do the 
same damage as one menthol cigarette.

470
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,790
What I'm imagining is how your customers who make 
the switch deal with their nicotine addiction.

471
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,900
Excuse me?

472
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,000
Well, if you have less nicotine in each 
cigarette, they're going to crave more 
in order to satisfy their addiction.

473
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,620
The poor bastard who smokes a pack a 
day is going to need to smoke ten packs a day.

474
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,020
And at five dollars a pack, your 
company's making a whole lot of money.

475
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,820
Are we done?

476
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,450
No.

477
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,630
I have one more question.

478
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,340
If spirit green is a protope, then 
how did our vic's dna get on that cigarette?

479
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,610
I have no idea.

480
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:55,680
It's possible that someone from the research and 
development team snuck one out and gave it to a friend.

481
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,420
Why don't i send you over the 
list of names of the r&d team?

482
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,450
You do that.

483
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,830
National spirit tobacco companY.

484
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,510
Please hold.

485
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,770
I want to see my husband.

486
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,010
I know that he's here.

487
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:09,990
I want to see him.

488
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,020
Hey, hey, hey!

489
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,110
What's going on?

490
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,420
They won't let me see my husband.

491
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,960
His name is jason williams, and no 
one's telling me what happened to him.

492
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,870
Let her go.

493
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,440
is that your husband?

494
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,790
Yes.

495
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,540
What the hell is going on?

496
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,010
Jason williams worked for your company.

497
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:36,320
What was he doing outside of the building, 
protesting the product that he sells?

498
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,410
Jason was in marketing.

499
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:42,090
He came up with anti-smoking guy as a way 
of unveiling the new spirit green cigarettes.

500
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,940
The plan was to build some awareness, and then 
introduce the product as a way 
of answering the health issue.

501
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,400
To make your company look like 
it cared about the little guy.

502
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,370
YeS.

503
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,420
It was a brilliant campaign.

504
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,250
Obviously very confidential.

505
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,540
Not many people know about it.

506
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,160
Why did you lie to me?

507
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,070
Detective, a dead employee in a cigarette 
suit is not exactly investor-friendly.

508
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,740
This man had a family.

509
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,570
You were going to have security kick 
his wife out of the building.

510
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,140
I was going to tell her.

511
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,390
I was just trying to buy the company a little 
bit of time until we figured out how to spin it.

512
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,960
Get this man out of my face.

513
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,000
What do you got?

514
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,810
Our crime scene cash turned out 
to be counterfeit.

515
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,690
Yeah?

516
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,500
Got three prints.

517
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,730
I ran 'em through afis.

518
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,290
Only one got tagged; jim "iceberg" easman.

519
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,700
That's the easy part.

520
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,360
He's in otisville, halfway through 
a dime for counterfeiting.

521
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,110
If easman's in prison, who else 
had access to his product?

522
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:45,420
So my old man says, "jimmy, 
what's mine is mine."

523
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,640
"You got nothing coming, so you got 
to go out and make your own money."

524
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,800
So that's exactly what I did.

525
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,670
Jimbo, why don't you spare us 
the stroll down memory lane?

526
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,850
What?

527
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,850
You double-parked or something?

528
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,860
You asked a question, I'm answering.

529
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,270
Come on.

530
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,570
You're playing games.

531
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,110
Okay.

532
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,450
Say if I help you, how you 
going to do right by me?

533
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,240
You got a parole hearing in two months.

534
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,380
And a call from us to the board will do a 
lot more than that hat you traded 
for two packs of smokes.

535
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:14,980
Kufi.

536
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,550
It's not a hat, it's a kufi.

537
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,180
Worn as a sign of respect 
to the prophet mohammed.

538
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,100
I know.

539
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,580
What you don't know, is that wearing 
it doesn't mean you're rehabilitated.

540
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:29,080
And this money that turned out to be 
counterfeit with your prints connects 
you to the murder of patrick dent.

541
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,220
You may have been in jail, but 
that doesn't mean you're not an accessory.

542
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,950
Maybe you know him as noah hubler.

543
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,350
I had nothing to do with father time's demise.

544
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,190
I never even seen that white boy before.

545
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,790
Jim, we find a dead man laying in a bed 
of your cash, your prints are everywhere.

546
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,010
How you going to explain that 
to the parole board?

547
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,010
yeah, it's mine.

548
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,110
Belongs to one of my last print runs.

549
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,420
How much did you print?

550
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,460
I stopped production at 500k.

551
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,970
Didn't like the way the shadow 
fell under jackson's chin.

552
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,140
What'd you do with the money?

553
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,850
Hid in one of my go whips.

554
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,000
'99 suburban.

555
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,690
The plan was to drive across 
country, wash the green.

556
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,900
Only, before I could go, the treasury department 
came down on me for passing counterfeit checks.

557
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,040
Imagine that.

558
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,620
There's nothing in your arrest record 
that says that money was vouchered.

559
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,070
That's because the badges didn't 
know anything about it.

560
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,990
It was still in the ride, and 
I wasn't about to make 'em rich.

561
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,270
What happened to the vehicle?

562
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:30,730
Everything I had was seized, 
then sold at government auctions.

563
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,440
So whoever bought that car found your money.

564
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,390
Took a look inside the gym bag 
we picked up at the crime scene,

565
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,160
and I found traces of the same hairspray 
that doc found on the cigarette suit.

566
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,850
So the gym bag could belong to our killer.

567
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,720
found identical trace on the cover.

568
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,890
There's no name or address.

569
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,250
Now, these bar codes and numbers 
can give us something.

570
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,900
I can have detective angell cross-reference 
it with the gym membership, possibly get a name.

571
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,480
Yeah, that's my bag, 
but it was stolen two nights ago.

572
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,780
I was coming home from work 
when this guy attacked me.

573
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,000
Do you remember what he looked like?

574
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,290
No, it was dark.

575
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,200
All I remember is black hair, long black coat.

576
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,010
I grabbed his hair, he bit me, 
grabbed my gym bag and took off.

577
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,210
I filed a police report.

578
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,180
Ms.Pescow, do you mind if 
I see where he bit you?

579
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,990
Okay, ms.Pescow, we're going to need to take 
a photograph of that bite mark, all right?

580
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,920
And I'm going to need the clothes 
you were wearing the night of the attack.

581
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,950
Okay.

582
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,220
Heidi pescow worked at pretzel barn on 45th.

583
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:12,170
So we have one victim found dead in a cigarette 
suit and another attacked while wearing 
a bavarian beer maid outfit.

584
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,370
You remember last summer when those 
guys from chicago beat up mr.Met?

585
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,070
Yeah, when the cubs lost that 
doubleheader at shea.

586
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,650
Right.

587
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,130
I'm thinking we're looking at a mascot basher.

588
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,990
You guys want to see something scary?

589
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:28,390
Ran the bite mark that doc photographed 
through the ir filter.

590
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,260
Right?

591
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,270
Got two sharp points next to the incisors.

592
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,560
Makes you think your girl was attacked
by a dog or something.

593
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,110
Or a vampire.

594
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,370
Heidi pescow said that her attacker 
was wearing a long black coat.

595
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,490
He's right.

596
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,050
We just found our killer.

597
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:56,430
I'm telling you, pal, the fabric your suit's 
made out of provides no ventilation.

598
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:00,130
Worse than that, what if an emergency 
worker or paramedic or something like 
that had to get you in a hurry

599
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,790
'cause you're having a heart attack?

600
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,880
Just come to the meeting.

601
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,550
Find out what your rights are.

602
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:08,990
Hey, count.

603
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,050
Littering's a crime in this city.

604
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,380
So is murder.

605
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,960
He was trying to unionize all 
the costumed greeters in the city.

606
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,700
But jason williams and heidi 
pescow weren't interested.

607
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,430
So he beat her up and 
he set jason on fire?

608
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,470
Yeah.

609
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,360
He thought it might......

610
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,050
change jason's mind.

611
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,240
Give him a little taste of what might 
happen if he wasn't protected by a union.

612
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,560
Look, I'm not interested!

613
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,160
Hey, hey, hey.

614
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,920
We're talking about something very serious here!

615
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,700
Mascot bashing, harassment.

616
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,510
We could force your company to hire 
security to protect your butt.

617
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,040
Will you leave me alone?!

618
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,820
That suit shouldn't be flammable.

619
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,020
People who do this job should be protected.

620
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,370
From people like you.

621
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:52,020
I just wanted him to get the idea, 
show him how vulnerable he was.

622
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,220
I didn't think he'd burn.

623
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,970
Well, he's ashes now, vince.

624
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,460
Mac...

625
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,310
mac, what do you got?

626
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,560
Tox report.

627
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,340
Turns out, our victim had bacterial 
endocarditis, a serious blood infection,

628
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,260
more than likely a result of 
the surgical tool left in his body.

629
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,240
You see, it was all in his head.

630
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,690
I'm thinking the infection got worse over 
time and caused our vic to become delusional.

631
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,560
That's the reason mr.Doomsday thought 
the world was coming to an end.

632
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,640
Spent his last few days at frankie's 
hardware buying two-by-fours.

633
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,690
Yo, yo!

634
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:41,140
I got some interesting info on our vic's 
disappearing act from the big easy.

635
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,490
Spoke to an officer buckley, who's the new orleans 
cop was in charge of the prisoner handoff.

636
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:51,390
According to buckley, the bogus detective was a 
white female, 30 to 35 years old, blonde hair,

637
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,690
and she identified herself as detective moulton.

638
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,100
Also carried the same caliber weapon we believe 
is responsible for the hole in our vic's chest.

639
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,250
This could be a our shooter.

640
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,030
And if she is, I think we have her.

641
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:05,040
Turn out, both the vic and his partner made 
phone calls from the seat-back phone on the flight

642
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,570
from new orleans back to new york.

643
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:11,290
When the partner didn't pay her credit card 
bill, the bank put a very aggressive 
collection  agency on the case.

644
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,520
Tell me you got a name.

645
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,780
And a warrant.

646
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,720
You're good, ms.Demartino.

647
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,790
Unlike your partner, you've never 
been caught for a crime.

648
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,970
But this time, you made a mistake.

649
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,610
I doubt it.

650
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,750
You're right.

651
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,990
If this was ten years ago, making that 
bullet disappear from the crime scene 
would have guaranteed you got away with murder,

652
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:37,380
but have this new science, it's called 
"lead memory," that will prove to a jury 
you killed your ex-partner.

653
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:43,650
My lab matched the lead isotopes from the 
gunshot residue left on our victim

654
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,910
to lead isotopes in the barrel of the gun 
we found while searching your home.

655
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,830
Ms.Demartino, you're an expert at lying.

656
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,810
Look at me.

657
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,310
Do I look like I'm lying?

658
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,980
Why'd you killim?

659
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,590
He stabbed me in the back.

660
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,560
When we first got to new york, patrick 
had all these plans for us.

661
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,210
Then a couple of 

662
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,570
Kept talking about the world 
coming to an end.

663
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,130
At first, I thought he was kidding, 
but he wasn't.

664
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,920
And you didn't like losing 
your partner?

665
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,490
I was fine parting ways.

666
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,080
I wanted the money he owed 
me from our last score.

667
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,770
said he spent it building his ark, 
but that he was going to get 
his hands on some more cash.

668
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,840
Two weeks later, I get a call.

669
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,360
That's it.

670
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:50,960
That's everything I owe you.

671
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,580
Are you sure you want out?

672
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,350
Yes.

673
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,310
Now, please leave.

674
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:00,090
Couple of days later, I tried to spend one 
of those bills, and it's flagged as counterfeit.

675
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,410
I came this close to getting pinched.

676
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,150
You thought patrick was trying 
to pull a fast one.

677
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,860
I didn't know.

678
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,960
I swear.

679
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,930
One of my passengers gave me the money.

680
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,740
You liar.

681
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,290
But patrick wasn't lying.

682
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,760
Somebody really did give him that money.

683
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,880
This time, he was the victim of a scam.

684
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,380
Hey, sid.

685
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:50,980
Hey.

686
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,610
Didn't think you'd be back on the job so soon.

687
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,370
Well...

688
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,570
I can't help myself.

689
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,390
I'll take it one body at a time, I guess.

690
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,710
it's all a little embarrassing.

691
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,710
I should have checked that sandwich better.

692
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,530
I'm sorry I scared you.

693
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,920
Um, sid, there's something you should know.

694
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:12,850
I...

695
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,410
I'm-I'm waiting for a window period to lapse.

696
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,140
I cut myself at the emery gable crime scene.

697
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,000
That victim was hiv-positive.

698
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,000
You administered cpr, stella.

699
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,800
I can't get the virus from saliva.

700
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,910
I know that.

701
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,480
Do.

702
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,530
And, um...

703
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:42,900
you know, it's just that, um, I remembered 
that that morning when I brushed my teeth, 
my gums bled a little.

704
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,220
So, I, um...

705
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,850
just, I know that it's less than 0.

706
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:48,600
1% risk, but still, there is a risk.

707
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,350
and you have a wife and two girls.

708
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,500
and I just, I wanted you to know.

709
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,800
And, I mean, it's all really unknown.

710
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,570
Except for the part where I'm alive 
because you saved my life.

711
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,410
Okay?

712
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,190
So thank you.

713
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,030
My wife and I had no idea 
the money was counterfeit.

714
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:28,330
Mr.Strauss, you find $500,000 stuffed 
into the door panels and seats of a truck 
you purchased at a government auction.

715
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,600
You mean to tell me that 
didn't raise a red flag?

716
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,260
Then what did you think?

717
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,810
It was a sign from god.

718
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,140
excuse me.

719
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,600
Today is sunday, right?

720
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,860
Yeah, that's right.
