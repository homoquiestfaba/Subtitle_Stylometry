[guitar playing]

2
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,361
(SINGING) Get
comfortable now, people,

3
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:32,700
and a story I will tell
about a group of women

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,569
who were rowdier than hell.

5
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:41,509
Out there in the rugged west
where men are dumb as dirt,

6
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:46,214
trying just to stay alive
and keep from getting hurt.

7
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:49,049
Rowdy girls.

8
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:54,122
Sit tight and watch the
story of the rowdy girls.

9
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,262
While preparations were
making for his departure,

10
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:04,498
the Roman ladies take a step,
which was a perfect novelty

11
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,600
in the Republic.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,338
About 20 years before when
Hannibal was ravaging Italy

13
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:13,641
and when the treasury was
very low, a tribune of people

14
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:17,978
named Opius had got a law
passed that no woman should

15
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,514
wear above half an ounce
of gold in ornaments,

16
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:24,952
or wear purple, or
ride in a chariot,

17
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,488
either at Rome or
within a mile of it,

18
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:32,360
unless she went to assist
at public sacrifice.

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,961
The ladies had
conformed themselves

20
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,497
to this law in a time
of general distress,

21
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,065
but they thought it
intolerable to the

22
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,801
under the restraint of
it now when the Republic

23
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,670
abounded with riches.

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,239
And they made a great
stir to get it repealed.

25
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,441
The consulship of
the austere Cato

26
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,110
seemed a very improper time
for moving this affair,

27
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,882
but their passion for
finery would brook no delay.

28
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:59,720
They prevailed with Valerius and
Fendanias, two of the tribunes,

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,623
to present their request
to the comeechia.

30
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,893
And contrary to custom,
ran thither themselves.

31
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,162
Neither the orders
of their husbands,

32
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:11,732
nor the rules of decency,
nor public authority

33
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,767
could keep them at home.

34
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:17,638
But there is no mischief of
which that sex is not capable

35
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:21,442
if you allow them to hold
amongst themselves assemblies,

36
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,845
private parties, and gossipings.

37
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:28,249
[guitar playing]

38
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,022
(SINGING) This yarn
spins back to 1886,

39
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:40,928
where we meet a desperate
woman tired of turning tricks.

40
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:46,434
She'd do most anything to make
a break from that bordello

41
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:51,171
and head out west to find
herself a decent fellow.

42
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:57,578
Velvet was raised
inside a house where

43
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,480
the beds creaked till dawn.

44
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,483
But her mama gave
her hope and pride

45
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,385
that kept her spirit strong.

46
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,791
Rowdy girls.

47
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:15,663
The rough and tumble
story of the rowdy girls.

48
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:45,859
[knock on door]

49
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,261
VELVET: Go away.

50
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,529
I'm sending another one up.

51
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,898
VELVET: No, you're not.

52
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,699
Velvet.

53
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,103
Now you know you
can't keep doing this.

54
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,343
You know you're Monsieur
Walkins' favorite.

55
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:05,045
Well, tell Mr. Walkins
that I'm under the curse.

56
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,680
Now move on.

57
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,248
I can't just go
down there and--

58
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,317
I said move on!

59
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:17,625
[guitar playing]

60
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,028
(SINGING) Now the meanest
girl around could put you 6

61
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:25,265
feet underground
or any other man

62
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,536
or woman who provokes her will.

63
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:34,007
When Billy Poke led the gang,
they all were doomed to hang.

64
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:39,380
But Mick was meaner still,
and she always shot to kill.

65
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,514
Rowdy girl.

66
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,950
Rowdy girls.

67
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,420
Oh, Mick, you know
what that does to me.

68
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,389
Yeah, Billy, I do.

69
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,762
[barking]

70
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:55,729
Oh yeah.

71
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,731
I am the Brahma bull.

72
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,811
[howling]

73
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:06,840
Oh, come on, Mick.

74
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,108
You know I hate
when you do that.

75
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,510
Come on, Billy.

76
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,680
You know you need the practice
to be a famous outlaw and all.

77
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,481
Reflexes.

78
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,452
See?

79
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,392
Take it.

80
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:28,575
[barking]

81
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,977
Why don't you come
on over here, Billy.

82
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,813
See what a real
woman tastes like.

83
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,902
Come on.

84
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:15,703
Yes.

85
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:26,714
Oh yeah.

86
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:27,715
Oh yeah.

87
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,999
[screaming]

88
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,570
[glass shattering]

89
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,982
You're one hell
of a woman, Mick.

90
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:38,852
You could say that again.

91
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,193
Don't forget.

92
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,897
I'm Billy Poke.

93
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,231
You certainly did.

94
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,604
[grumble]

95
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,474
[guitar playing]

96
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:08,315
(SINGING) Sarah was arranged
to wed a Texan Calahan.

97
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:13,954
But her heart was crying out
for the San Francisco Bay.

98
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:20,027
So she begged her beau, Rory,
to take her there by hand

99
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:24,632
and left a tear-stained
note for dear old dad.

100
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:27,200
SARAH (VOICEOVER): Dear
Father, I am sorry to leave

101
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,736
without saying goodbye.

102
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:32,806
I cannot marry Mr. Calahan
as you have arranged.

103
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:36,343
My intention is to
go to San Francisco.

104
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:40,480
I know you don't approve of
Rory, but he is a good man.

105
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,417
I know he will take care of me.

106
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,954
Your dearest daughter, Sarah.

107
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,479
Tell me about San
Francisco again.

108
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,447
Do the ladies really
stay out all night there?

109
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,688
Don't worry, Sarah.

110
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:21,989
You know I'll send for you.

111
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:26,059
Well, if you love me,
you'll take me with you now.

112
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,594
If you don't, I'll have
to marry some old goat

113
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:28,862
I don't even know.

114
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,163
No, I can't.

115
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,398
I got business to attend to.

116
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,465
Now you know that.

117
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,209
I didn't want to
go with you anyway.

118
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,643
I'll get to San
Francisco by myself.

119
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,326
[knock on door]

120
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:05,766
Hey.

121
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,267
Come on.

122
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,401
Hey.

123
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,771
It went just like you
said it was gonna go.

124
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,340
Hand me the keys.

125
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,809
I didn't lose them.

126
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:16,810
OK.

127
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,811
Did anybody see you?

128
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:18,946
Hell no.

129
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:20,180
And it was a hell of a
lot easier than storming

130
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,648
in there in broad daylight.
-Let me see the money.

131
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:22,615
It's all there.

132
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,655
We're rich.

133
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,957
You done good, Cole.

134
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,798
Oh, I'm telling you, honey.

135
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,833
It was so easy.

136
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,003
I slipped the keys in, and
the safe opened right up

137
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,038
just like you said it would.

138
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,606
No guards, no nothing.

139
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,549
Velvet, I love you.

140
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,717
Take off your clothes.

141
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,057
Honey.

142
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,726
You almost as smart as me.

143
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,930
Now you know how excited
bank robbing gets me.

144
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,468
I want to teach
you something new.

145
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:20,373
All right now.

146
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,842
You catch your breath.

147
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,277
Tell me everything
that happened, OK?

148
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:28,982
I went inside.

149
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,183
Mm-hmm.

150
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,052
There was nobody there.

151
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:32,853
Yeah?

152
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,088
Shut the door.

153
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,225
Place was all dark.

154
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,192
Keep talking, honey.

155
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,799
I crawled on my
belly to the back.

156
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,836
I put the two keys in the safe.

157
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:49,702
That's a little tight.

158
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,503
VELVET: Sorry.

159
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:57,210
Safe opened right up.

160
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,182
There was the money,
just sitting there,

161
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,417
waiting for me to take it.

162
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:09,589
Are you sure you
closed the safe?

163
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,757
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:11,758
I locked it.

165
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:14,027
And nobody saw
you on the street?

166
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:14,962
No.

167
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,496
Are you sure?

168
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,797
Yeah.

169
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,999
I done told you.

170
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,103
Tell me you're my girl.

171
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:32,779
Tell me.

172
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,318
I ain't your girl, Cole.

173
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,752
I ain't nobody's girl.

174
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,854
I told you that.

175
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,556
[muffled shouting]

176
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,259
You know why I ain't
your girl, Cole?

177
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,230
'Cause you're stupid.

178
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,635
Maybe someday, I'll
be somebody's girl.

179
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,237
I don't know who.

180
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,772
Sure ain't gonna be you.

181
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,375
Had so many men, I
can't remember them all.

182
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:07,147
But I gotta tell you,
out of all of them,

183
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,616
damn, you're the worst.

184
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:10,984
[muffled shouting]

185
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:14,121
Now settle down, Cole.

186
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,589
I'm taking all my
money, do you hear me?

187
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:09,509
I love you, Velvet.

188
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,248
Damn, Cole.

189
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,184
Now see, this is what
I'm talking about.

190
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:19,486
That's so stupid.

191
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,922
How many times do I have
to tell you to think ahead?

192
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,724
But I love you, Velvet.

193
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:29,129
And you hurt me real bad.

194
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,097
No.

195
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,564
I don't have time for this.

196
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:43,543
Now Sweetwater is a friendly
and fairly quiet old town.

197
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,212
Though some of the
husbands around here

198
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:48,481
wish that Joe Pepper would
tame that friendliness down.

199
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,717
The Pepper Brothers,
Joe and Sam,

200
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,752
well, they're Sweetwater law.

201
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,855
But Sam's doing all the
work while Joe fools around

202
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,824
back there behind the stalls.

203
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,759
That's just boredom
talking though.

204
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,262
Someday, he'll learn
to fight against hate.

205
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,564
Hopefully, for Sam's sake,
it doesn't happen too late.

206
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,114
MRS. WHEELER: Oh yeah.

207
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,882
Mrs. Wheeler.

208
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:23,882
Joe.

209
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,053
Sam.

210
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,220
No, no, no.

211
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,655
No, Sam, this isn't
what it looks like.

212
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,889
Uh-uh.

213
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,858
Look, I-- I was just helping
Mrs. Wheeler find her--

214
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,294
SAM: Don't explain to
me, little brother.

215
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,596
Tell Mr. Wheeler when he gets
here in about five minutes.

216
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,597
Five minutes?

217
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,099
Oh my god.

218
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,537
Joe.

219
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,008
Sam.

220
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,014
I swear, Joe, you're
gonna get one of us

221
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,016
killed if you don't learn
how to keep them britches up.

222
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,260
You've seen enough.

223
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,061
Damn it, Billy.

224
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,929
You almost poked my eye out.

225
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:10,797
Mick, am I right?

226
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:13,032
It's the perfect
spot to take it.

227
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,702
Mick, we're wasting our time
with this Sweetwater stage.

228
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,837
It's too far out for payroll.

229
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,339
Exactly.

230
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,973
You know they're
switching stages.

231
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,343
Yeah, but not this one.

232
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:26,813
We do what I say.

233
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:27,813
Huh?

234
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,817
(SARCASTICALLY) Good plan.

235
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,485
You poking fun at me?

236
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,487
I wouldn't do that.

237
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,322
You're Billy Poke.

238
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,028
The boys will be
here in the morning.

239
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:45,365
Maybe I should do some
scouting or fix that wheel.

240
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,343
Never be another
woman like you.

241
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,277
I know.

242
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,328
Ugh, I'm bored.

243
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,864
Well, Romeo, in
my opinion, that's

244
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,432
a good thing for you to be.

245
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,269
You got no call to
to start in on me.

246
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,604
You see that it stays that way.

247
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,340
See, I ain't covering
for you no more.

248
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,242
Next time for you,
it's wedding bells.

249
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:38,084
Rangers haven't
caught Billy Poke yet?

250
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,486
Nope.

251
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:44,123
Reward's gone up to
$1,000, dead or alive.

252
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,593
Damn, what did he do this time?

253
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,095
He robbed a stage in Abilene.

254
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:54,100
Killed everyone, even the women.

255
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,503
Abilene.

256
00:18:56,503 --> 00:19:00,072
We aren't too far from Abilene.

257
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,074
Hey, isn't Jack
Calahan's new bride

258
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,711
coming in on the next stage?

259
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,579
You reckon I ride out
there in the morning

260
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,614
and give them an escort?

261
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,787
Sweetwater stage has no
payroll, and I don't want you

262
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,022
anywhere near Jake's new bride.

263
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,594
I hear she's a real
lady this time.

264
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,246
The Sweetwater stage is
right over there, Sister.

265
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,870
Where are you headed?

266
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,671
San Francisco.

267
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,072
Sarah.

268
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:09,075
Don't lie to the good sister.

269
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,778
Amanda, I suggest
you mind your place.

270
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:25,925
CHESTER: Ho!

271
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,967
The team needs a rest.

272
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,069
I'll step on down, help you out.

273
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,487
All right, step on down.

274
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,890
We'll be spending
the night here.

275
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,559
Don't wander off too far.

276
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,094
Watch out for rattles.

277
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,764
There's more than one
kind of snake around here.

278
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,701
I got it.

279
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,038
Right this way, Sister.

280
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:46,373
I feel like I know you
already, Mr. Beaudine.

281
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:47,173
Henry.

282
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:50,142
Call me Henry.

283
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,844
Henry.

284
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:56,783
You see, what I really want
is to go to San Francisco.

285
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,872
Well now, Henry seems to
be a decent enough feller,

286
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,708
trying to make a break.

287
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,910
But there's something hidden
behind those pinstripes,

288
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,245
and that's a greedy old snake.

289
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:29,916
Velvet, she's got a lot to lose
with her money bag in sight.

290
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,620
And Henry tells Sarah, snatch
that bag this very night.

291
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:18,517
Henry.

292
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,701
Henry.

293
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,635
Where are you?

294
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,303
I've got the bag.

295
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,772
Henry?

296
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:26,573
Oh.

297
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:18,024
I knew that whore was
hiding something, huh?

298
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,425
She's a nun.

299
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:22,829
Oh yeah, that's like saying I'm
really gonna take you with me.

300
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:23,763
Where's the horse?

301
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:24,897
You said--

302
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:25,698
Oh.

303
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:26,966
You are not going.

304
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:32,104
Neither are you, cowboy.

305
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,940
Let her go.

306
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,908
Get off her.

307
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,443
Now turn around.

308
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:38,210
Back up.

309
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,683
That's my money.

310
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:46,986
Give it here.

311
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:47,946
Come on.

312
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,558
It's my money.

313
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,060
Oh, whoa, hey.

314
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,262
Oh, I can't believe
you're so stupid.

315
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:57,063
Stupid.

316
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:08,608
He's dead.

317
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,408
Oh my god.

318
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:10,877
I-- I killed him.

319
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:18,685
Are you just gonna stand
there or are you gonna help me?

320
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,287
Sister, I can't.

321
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:22,221
Fine.

322
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,455
Then you'll go to
jail for trying

323
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,858
to steal the church's money.

324
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:26,659
Get over here.

325
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:36,936
Come on, push.

326
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:39,005
SARAH: I am pushing.

327
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:39,806
Push harder.

328
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,877
Come on, missy.

329
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:48,180
Get your hands dirty.

330
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,049
Why'd you take my money?

331
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,385
Well, I needed it to
go to San Francisco.

332
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,554
What'd you need him for?

333
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,691
I couldn't go alone.

334
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,661
You didn't get very far
with the bag, did you?

335
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:02,862
Couldn't go without it.

336
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:05,598
And besides, I thought it
was the church's money.

337
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:06,565
I am the church.

338
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,839
Where's my mama's watch?

339
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,640
I don't know.

340
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,258
Ow!

341
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,713
Did you let him take my watch?

342
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:21,981
No.

343
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:24,817
Nuns aren't supposed
to hit people.

344
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:25,752
This one does.

345
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:53,779
Joe.

346
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:55,982
Joe.

347
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:56,732
Hm?

348
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,151
Changed my mind.

349
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:02,554
You're riding out with me this
afternoon to meet the stage.

350
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,754
All right.

351
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,626
I'll be back in about an hour.

352
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,196
Get up and get something to eat.

353
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,197
JOE: Yeah, yeah.

354
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,406
Did you hear what happened?

355
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:23,375
Did you know the Lord
doesn't appreciate those

356
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,377
who partake in idle gossip?

357
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:29,816
This is hardly
idle gossip, Sister.

358
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:33,619
Mr. Beaudine ran off last night
and took one of our horses

359
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,688
with him.

360
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:38,257
I knew that man had no
character from the moment

361
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,192
I laid eyes on him.

362
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:42,962
You should pay more attention
to my guidance, Sarah.

363
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:58,644
Damn.

364
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,787
Mrs. Wheeler.

365
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:11,390
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

366
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,325
Nuh-uh-uh.

367
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:16,495
Mr. Wheeler will
be here any minute.

368
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,031
I am Mr. Wheeler.

369
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,267
Come on, little Susie.

370
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,568
Daddy wants some sugar.

371
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:28,808
Well, my, Mr. Wheeler, you
sure do look young today.

372
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:29,608
Woo!

373
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,053
You are so strong.

374
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:41,921
So sweet.

375
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,028
I don't believe you're
Mr. Wheeler at all.

376
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:49,829
You don't?

377
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:50,997
No.

378
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:53,699
You are an imposter, and
I'm gonna punish you.

379
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,301
Oh, I'm a bad boy.

380
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:58,304
Yeah, you're a bad boy.

381
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:01,673
I just love our
afternoons together.

382
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,442
[bell]

383
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:04,777
Oh my god.

384
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:05,912
Oh my god.
I gotta go.

385
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:06,478
What?
What?

386
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,279
Mrs. Wheeler.

387
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,080
Oh my god.

388
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,215
Sam's gonna kill me.

389
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:13,452
Damn his brother.

390
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:05,304
Sam, sorry I'm-- Sam?

391
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,105
Damn.

392
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:17,850
Hey, Chester.

393
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,420
Sam.

394
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:30,930
Morning, Chester.

395
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,265
Morning, Sheriff.

396
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:34,166
That's a nice looking egg.

397
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:34,967
Yep.

398
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,811
Morning, ladies.

399
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:49,315
Which one of you
is Sarah Foster?

400
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:50,565
I am.

401
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,419
Nice to meet you, miss.

402
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:57,924
I'm here to escort you to town.

403
00:30:57,924 --> 00:31:00,426
Did Mr. Calahan send you?

404
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:01,227
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:06,032
Here we go.

406
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:14,006
Easy picking, guys.

407
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:16,175
Just a bunch of women.

408
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:17,376
Hey.

409
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,177
Give me that.

410
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,526
It's our lucky day.

411
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:37,396
Let's go get them.

412
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,665
We ain't taking no women.

413
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:40,745
JD, Liam.

414
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,503
I think we need some new whores.

415
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:48,674
Hey, Billy.

416
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,676
Don't let this carrona
kill everybody this time.

417
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,191
There's a rider up ahead.

418
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:05,992
Ho!

419
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:11,897
OK, OK, OK.

420
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:17,703
Help me.

421
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:18,504
She's been hurt.

422
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:36,655
Stay where you are, and I
promise you won't get hurt.

423
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,625
[gunshots]

424
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,261
Oh my god, they
shot the driver.

425
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:43,062
Oh my god.

426
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:43,862
Be quiet.

427
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:44,696
Damn it, Mick.

428
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,966
I told you not to do that again.

429
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,801
I promised him.

430
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,137
You promised him?

431
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,475
Somebody's gotta have
some balls around here.

432
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,616
Just do whatever they sayand keep your mouth shut.

433
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,785
I told you this route
wouldn't pay off.

434
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,420
It's not even a stage.

435
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,555
It's a damn wagon.

436
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,027
You need me to do
what you can't.

437
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,768
Come on out of there.

438
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:25,337
Put your hands where
I can see them.

439
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,874
JD, get out there and check and
see if there's a strong box.

440
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,476
Come on.

441
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:31,677
Come on.

442
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:32,478
Liam.

443
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:56,935
Yeah, beau.

444
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,137
Looks like we got
a little something

445
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,005
extra for our trouble.

446
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,374
You keep your hands off
her, you filthy beast.

447
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,009
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

448
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,011
Behave yourself, you
won't get hurt, all right?

449
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:13,485
[gunshot]

450
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,988
[screaming]

451
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,106
Liam.

452
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:42,314
Damn.

453
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:45,784
There must be $20,000 in here.

454
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,186
Hello, Sister.

455
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:47,986
What'd you do?

456
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:48,787
Rob a bank?

457
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:52,958
Shut up.

458
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,397
I wasn't gonna kill her, Billy.

459
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:00,732
We were just fooling around.

460
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:04,170
You know how much
you mean to me.

461
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:04,970
I told you.

462
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,976
Never be another woman like you.

463
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,777
I know.

464
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,353
MINSTREL (SINGING):
Mick is getting more

465
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,923
than she ever bargained for.

466
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:30,229
Billy Poke has his eye
on sweet and sassy Sarah.

467
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:35,767
All the rowdy girls-- one, two,
three-- now they're together.

468
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:40,639
Sarah rides a horse
up front, but the nun

469
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,976
is being dragged on a tether.

470
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,754
Make them stop.

471
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,389
Whoa.

472
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:58,190
Don't worry.

473
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,326
They ain't gonna hurt her.

474
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:03,262
Virgin like her is worth
too much, even if she

475
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,464
is a little long in the tooth.

476
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:08,534
She ain't gonna be worth
much if they keep doing that.

477
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:09,568
Please, let her ride.

478
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,241
Liam.

479
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:16,608
Cut that out and put
her up on a horse.

480
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,917
Where are we headed to?

481
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:26,718
You like tequila?

482
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:02,588
Sam.

483
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:40,426
Put this on, you little tramp.

484
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,160
Tell me you want only me.

485
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,634
Tell me.

486
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,435
You want only me.

487
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:26,705
Smart ass.

488
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,209
Should've killed him.

489
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:44,082
He says he's gonna
keep me for himself.

490
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:44,832
Ha.

491
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:49,755
What is your rich rancher
gonna say about that?

492
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:52,858
He also says a virgin like
you is worth a lot of money

493
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:54,826
in the whorehouses
down here, even

494
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,462
if you are long in the tooth.

495
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:01,567
Oh, he did, did he?

496
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,669
Did he say what happens to
smart ass virgins like you

497
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:06,705
when he's finished with them?

498
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:09,608
I know why you became a nun.

499
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:12,010
I could tell him.

500
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,645
Well, go ahead then.

501
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,547
Tell him what you
think you know.

502
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:20,418
Look.

503
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,252
I need your help.

504
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:24,790
Sorry.

505
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,192
Can't do it.

506
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:29,928
I helped you.

507
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,998
Well, the Lord helps those
who help themselves, darling.

508
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,737
I don't care if
you help me or not.

509
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:40,305
I'm going to get
to San Francisco.

510
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:48,580
[whistle]

511
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:50,248
Mount up.

512
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,220
Wanna make camp before tonight.

513
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:20,178
Almost home, Mick.

514
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,180
Give me that
beautiful moon, Billy.

515
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:14,633
You better quit staring at him.

516
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:15,567
I hate him.

517
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:22,107
Look, it doesn't
have to be him.

518
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:24,075
You better choose.

519
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:27,679
Or he's gonna choose you.

520
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,048
How can you say that?

521
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,684
What do you think they're gonna
do after they finish drinking?

522
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:33,484
Go to sleep?

523
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,295
What about you?

524
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,665
You don't know
anything about men.

525
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:35,380
No!

526
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,682
Let me go.

527
00:43:36,682 --> 00:43:38,149
Let me go.

528
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:39,284
Help me.

529
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,085
No.

530
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:41,086
No!

531
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,520
Leave me alone!

532
00:43:49,895 --> 00:43:50,862
Take that, stupid whore.

533
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,775
He's not man enough for me.

534
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:08,213
None of you are.

535
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:13,719
Hold her on the ground.

536
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:21,827
SARAH: Get your hands off of me.

537
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:24,763
Leave me alone.

538
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:25,843
Get away.

539
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:28,516
No!

540
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:30,468
No!

541
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:31,302
No!

542
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,739
Why does she have to be a nun?

543
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:35,941
SARAH: No!

544
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:36,742
No!

545
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:40,712
Hold her legs.

546
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:41,713
Look at me.

547
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,552
I can handle you.

548
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:48,353
Do it, Billy.

549
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,221
Don't listen to her.

550
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:53,658
I can see you.

551
00:44:53,658 --> 00:44:55,026
Do it, Billy.

552
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,995
You're not like her.

553
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:08,306
I'll deal with her, man.

554
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,817
You can have her.

555
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:19,885
No!

556
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:21,352
You're not like them.

557
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,353
Get her, JD.

558
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,689
You're not like them.

559
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:25,439
No!

560
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:28,159
You're not like them.

561
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,828
You're not like them!

562
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:39,670
Damn.

563
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:47,645
Well, help me up.

564
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:48,479
Come on, let's go.

565
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:49,280
Wait.

566
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,115
Wait.

567
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:51,316
We can't just leave her there.

568
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:53,184
Look, I'll come back for here.

569
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:54,519
You know what, young man?

570
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:56,021
I'm sure someday, you're gonna
make a very good sheriff,

571
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:59,357
but today, I'm not leaving
here without my-- my sister.

572
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:01,326
Look, we can talk about
my youth and vitality

573
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:02,427
at a later date.

574
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:06,731
But right now-- I don't
have time for this.

575
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:13,571
You're so pretty.

576
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:20,011
You won't let them
touch me again?

577
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:20,812
No.

578
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:32,824
I like you, Billy.

579
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:36,661
I like you too.

580
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,768
I wanna go to San Francisco.

581
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,299
[moaning]

582
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:06,744
[giggling]

583
00:49:08,846 --> 00:49:10,248
SARAH: That was nice.

584
00:49:16,321 --> 00:49:17,722
Get back here.

585
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:23,228
It isn't always
like this, is it?

586
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,705
Billy, you're so strong.

587
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:54,159
What's that?

588
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:55,660
Billy, what's--
what's happening?

589
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:21,486
You know what?

590
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:25,556
That was a dirty
trick you pulled.

591
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:28,526
You sure are
different for a nun.

592
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,395
I mean, not that I've had
any dealings with a sister

593
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:33,098
of the cloth, mind you.

594
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:34,865
Well, I haven't had any
dealings with a sheriff

595
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,601
who doesn't shave yet.

596
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:39,770
Hey, smooth as a baby's bottom.

597
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,340
Oh, and might I add that it's
this fresh young face right

598
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,876
here that saved a woman
of your advanced years

599
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,813
last night, Sister?

600
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:52,250
What are you doing
out here alone anyway?

601
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:57,088
'Cause the sheriff that
was killed was my brother.

602
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:01,025
Oh.

603
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:09,066
Well, what if Billy
and his men follow us?

604
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,235
It's just you and me, Sister.

605
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:16,641
I guess it could be worse.

606
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:17,842
So where's the nearest town?

607
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:21,146
I need to get some fresh
clothes and a fresh horse.

608
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:24,915
Then I'm gonna get
my-- my sister,

609
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,684
and get out of this
god forsaken land.

610
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:30,555
Which one of them
killed my brother?

611
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:37,228
The one with the keys.

612
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,795
Well?

613
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:13,464
You gonna leave or what?

614
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,033
No, ma'am.

615
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:19,837
Sister or not, you're
one fine looking woman.

616
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:21,539
You wouldn't be
safe in here alone.

617
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:32,016
Don't worry, Sister.

618
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:33,884
I'm a gentleman
through and through.

619
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:34,985
You could rest
your mind at ease.

620
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:35,786
I won't look.

621
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:15,460
This is the only inhabited town
between here and Sweetwater.

622
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:21,866
We sit tight, Billy's bound
to show up with your sister.

623
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:24,369
VELVET: Yeah, then what?

624
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,436
I come up with a plan.

625
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:53,331
I can see you, Mr. Pepper.

626
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:13,217
[speaking spanish]

627
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:28,399
She's all yours.

628
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:39,043
Sister, wake up.

629
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:39,883
Sister.

630
00:54:41,746 --> 00:54:42,747
We didn't have to wait too long.

631
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,485
Billy and his men just rode in.

632
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,219
Get that funny little
man from the bath

633
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,055
house over here pronto.

634
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:52,189
Pedro.

635
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:54,892
My lady here wants a bath.

636
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:57,595
Anything she wants,
I aim to give.

637
00:55:01,566 --> 00:55:04,602
Your sister's with him.

638
00:55:04,602 --> 00:55:07,505
It's kind of strange though.

639
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:09,440
She was riding
right next to Billy,

640
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,011
and Billy's woman was
riding behind him, tied up.

641
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:15,380
I'll be damned.

642
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:21,386
I want some whiskey.

643
00:55:21,386 --> 00:55:24,822
It's too quiet in here.

644
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:25,623
You.

645
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:29,827
Que pasa?

646
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,196
BILLY: Something wrong
with your fingers?

647
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:35,666
[playing guitar]

648
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:49,947
I love this place.

649
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:58,756
What the hell is she doing?

650
00:55:58,756 --> 00:56:00,691
Playing with fire as usual.

651
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,129
[bark]

652
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,200
Cincuenta.

653
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,201
I'm gonna go check it out.

654
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,503
You stay here.

655
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:13,303
I'll be right back.

656
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,039
Hey.

657
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,040
Peachfuzz, be careful.

658
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:27,985
[speaking spanish]

659
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:28,986
Mm-mm.

660
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:30,488
[speaking spanish]

661
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,828
You've been a
naughty girl, Sarah.

662
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:13,698
How did you get here?

663
00:57:13,698 --> 00:57:15,432
We looked for you everywhere.

664
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,367
Yeah, I'll bet you did.

665
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,169
I know your mama's colored.

666
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:24,274
Where's my watch?

667
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,643
Billy has it.

668
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:29,346
He's helping me get
to San Francisco.

669
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:31,782
You know, I know you're
just a silly little girl,

670
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,551
but you're playing
dangerous games.

671
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:35,419
Now I wish I had
the time to teach

672
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:38,789
you the virtues of fending
for yourself, but I don't.

673
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,025
Well, I'm keeping the money.

674
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:42,226
No, you're not.

675
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:54,204
You mind if I sit in?

676
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,247
Ain't you a little young?

677
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,354
I just turned 50 today.

678
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:28,706
Billy.

679
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:30,340
I think I see some
whiskers here.

680
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:45,322
Get the hell outta here, JD.

681
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:48,525
Look, I told you not to
tear this place up anymore.

682
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,095
Liam, get him outta here.

683
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:02,072
What'd you say your
name was again?

684
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:02,873
Joe.

685
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:07,411
Joe Pepper.

686
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:12,416
What's your bet,
Mr. Joe Pepper?

687
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:56,794
MINSTREL (SINGING): Now
Velvet's gonna take a chance.

688
00:59:56,794 --> 01:00:00,297
She's ready to take flight.

689
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:07,705
While back inside, Joe and
Billy gamble into the night.

690
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:14,111
Soon, sweet Sarah will awake,
her money lost and gone.

691
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:14,912
I can't believe it.

692
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:16,280
Sister?Sister?

693
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,382
MINSTREL (SINGING): Now the
stage is set for the final act.

694
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:21,051
The curtains rise at dawn.

695
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:25,856
Call.

696
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,328
Straight.

697
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:37,134
Kings full.

698
01:00:45,209 --> 01:00:46,110
[glass breaking]

699
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,878
[speaking spanish]

700
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,696
I like you, Joe Pepper.

701
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:06,663
Hey, Jose.

702
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,798
JOSE: Si, senor.

703
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:10,600
Get one of your ladies
for my friend Joe here.

704
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,703
JOSE: Maria.

705
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:14,338
I think I'm gonna
quit while I'm ahead.

706
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:50,540
How the hell did
we get out here?

707
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:57,647
My head hurts.

708
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:00,084
I'm good.

709
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:01,618
I think that nun
whipped our asses.

710
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:14,999
You wanna tell me where
she is, Joe Pepper?

711
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:16,700
I thought she was here.

712
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,667
Well, she ain't.

713
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:21,438
Empty your pockets.

714
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:25,976
Fixing to rob me, Joe?

715
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:26,743
Your pockets.

716
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,479
Empty them.

717
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,315
Pepper.

718
01:02:31,315 --> 01:02:32,917
That the name of the
sheriff over in Sweetwater?

719
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:38,755
Bet you're hunting for
some keys, huh, Joe?

720
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:39,790
Were you the one?

721
01:02:42,827 --> 01:02:44,077
Nope.

722
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:46,797
Not like them, Joe Pepper.

723
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:55,172
I still gotta take you in.

724
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:27,905
Where's the girl and the money?

725
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:29,706
The senorita took one of
the horses from the barn.

726
01:03:29,706 --> 01:03:31,541
She rode out over
an hour ago alone.

727
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,510
We'll find her easy.

728
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:34,511
Let's go.

729
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:53,530
Yeah, there it is.
Come on.

730
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:54,431
I'm thirsty too.

731
01:04:40,344 --> 01:04:41,578
Hello, princess.

732
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,452
Howdy, Sister.

733
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:25,956
Shouldn't have
run off like that.

734
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:28,058
Leaving your sister behind.

735
01:05:28,058 --> 01:05:30,427
And now I find you freshening up
out here in the broad daylight.

736
01:05:33,197 --> 01:05:34,764
She ain't my sister.

737
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:35,899
Yeah.

738
01:05:35,899 --> 01:05:41,171
Well, you see, I figured
that one out on my own.

739
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:42,572
Wow.

740
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:46,010
You're a pretty smart boy.

741
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:47,311
You never answered my question.

742
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:53,050
You came all the
way out here to get

743
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,385
the answer to a question?

744
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:57,287
Yes, ma'am.

745
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:59,623
As soon as I get it,
I'm gonna make sure

746
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:05,895
that you and your money get back
to Sweetwater and the church.

747
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:18,208
It was the woman.

748
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:20,077
Isn't it always the woman?

749
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:29,219
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

750
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:30,020
Whoa.

751
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:34,491
Let's go.

752
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:12,529
You all right, ma'am?

753
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:18,335
My name's-- my name's Viola.

754
01:07:18,335 --> 01:07:19,903
Just call me Viola.

755
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,159
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

756
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:43,059
Shh.

757
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:43,860
Comancheros.

758
01:07:46,263 --> 01:07:50,200
They been running horses
up the canyon all day.

759
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,103
Well, what aconvenient spot for it.

760
01:07:53,103 --> 01:07:54,138
Now, now, Viola.

761
01:07:54,138 --> 01:07:57,874
Don't get your habit
all in a twist.

762
01:07:57,874 --> 01:07:59,843
How did you know my name?

763
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:03,480
You told me right
before you passed out.

764
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,282
Is that why you became a nun?

765
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:07,317
You little bastard.

766
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:08,252
No.

767
01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:11,355
I knew my daddy,
right and simple.

768
01:08:11,355 --> 01:08:12,189
How about you, Viola?

769
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,496
I didn't have to help you.

770
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:28,872
Oh my god, Sister.

771
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:29,673
I am sorry.

772
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:30,874
I mean-- I mean, Viola.

773
01:08:43,387 --> 01:08:44,721
Find them?

774
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:47,657
Yeah, they're about
a mile up the creek.

775
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:49,058
They have the girl with them?

776
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:49,859
Yep.

777
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,067
Oh, she don't look
too good though.

778
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:58,868
Oh.

779
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:02,752
Who are you?

780
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:08,525
Does it matter?

781
01:12:08,525 --> 01:12:09,393
No.

782
01:12:09,393 --> 01:12:10,794
I don't reckon it does.

783
01:12:15,632 --> 01:12:18,334
What kind of name is Viola?

784
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:21,170
Well, my mama said
it was the name

785
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,006
of a tall, beautiful flower.

786
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,878
I guess you're not a nun.

787
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:30,747
I guess you're not a boy.

788
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:32,215
I guess not.

789
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:40,056
You like me already, don't you?

790
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:40,990
You've got some nerve.

791
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,830
Hell, you might even love me.

792
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:16,493
You know what I'm
gonna do to you?

793
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:18,895
Comancheros.

794
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,764
Know what those are?

795
01:13:20,764 --> 01:13:21,565
Savages.

796
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:30,874
They're gonna like a sweet
piece of meat like you.

797
01:13:30,874 --> 01:13:34,811
Too bad you ain't
a virgin no more.

798
01:13:34,811 --> 01:13:37,447
They might've been nicer to you.

799
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:42,351
But seeing as you're
damaged goods and all.

800
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:44,654
They might just want
to mark you first.

801
01:13:47,591 --> 01:13:50,660
[speaking spanish]

802
01:13:54,063 --> 01:13:57,867
I might stick around long
enough to hear you scream.

803
01:13:57,867 --> 01:14:03,873
Then I'm gonna get that
son of a bitch Billy.

804
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:05,675
Comprende?

805
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:06,476
Comprende?

806
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,200
[thud]

807
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,351
Why didn't you kill them?

808
01:16:02,926 --> 01:16:06,195
I'm not like them, remember?

809
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:09,933
Besides, this whole area's
crawling with Comancheros.

810
01:16:09,933 --> 01:16:11,868
So be quiet.

811
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:17,674
There you go.

812
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:19,442
Get your money and
head to San Francisco.

813
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:52,809
They can't have my money, Joe.

814
01:16:56,713 --> 01:16:59,182
Why is it so important to you?

815
01:16:59,182 --> 01:17:02,952
It's the only thing standing
between me and what I was.

816
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:06,255
No, Viola, it's not.

817
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:07,123
Not anymore.

818
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:16,132
They'll be waiting for
us across the river.

819
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:16,933
You ready?

820
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:26,275
[gunshots]

821
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:32,315
Sound like it came
from Silverton.

822
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:35,218
It's an abandoned mining
town just over those hills.

823
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:36,419
I'm riding ahead.

824
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:38,221
No matter what
happens, you stay put.

825
01:17:38,221 --> 01:17:42,558
Excuse me, Mr. It's
Just You and Me, Sister.

826
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:44,160
I got some unfinished
business to take care of.

827
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,295
Well, I got some unfinished
business of my own.

828
01:17:46,295 --> 01:17:47,096
Fine.

829
01:17:47,096 --> 01:17:48,264
Have it your way.
-Fine.

830
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:49,065
I will.

831
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,846
[footsteps]

832
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:38,614
Well, if it ain't Joe.

833
01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:40,216
You're not so
tough now, are you?

834
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,922
You're just a kid.

835
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:47,423
That's right.

836
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:50,626
The kid that knocked
you on your ass.

837
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:53,562
I don't have any
liquor in me now.

838
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:54,764
Let's see how tough
you really are.

839
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:02,205
Where's the money?

840
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:03,239
I'll tell you what, tough guy.

841
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:07,176
If you're a faster
draw than me, then I'll

842
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:11,247
tell you where the money is.

843
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,916
Do you want to play
with the kid or what?

844
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:19,622
Don't think I'm
stupid, 'cause I'm not.

845
01:19:19,622 --> 01:19:21,858
Now you tell me
where the money is.

846
01:19:21,858 --> 01:19:22,658
Now.

847
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:29,899
It's right behind you.

848
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:31,367
Trying to trick me.

849
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,472
You know, I think I'll
just shoot you now.

850
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:38,374
[gunshot]

851
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:45,148
I told you you needed me.

852
01:19:45,148 --> 01:19:46,115
[gunshots]

853
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,550
Who the hell is shooting at us?

854
01:19:50,854 --> 01:19:54,157
Hold it right there.

855
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:56,659
Hello, Sister.

856
01:19:56,659 --> 01:19:58,995
Where's my money?

857
01:19:58,995 --> 01:20:00,596
Come on, Sarah.

858
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,431
You don't want to do this.

859
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:05,334
You know I do.

860
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,470
You're gonna get hurt then.

861
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:10,439
I'm going to win.

862
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:12,008
You can't.

863
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:13,376
Why?

864
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:15,979
Because you always do?

865
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:17,346
Well, not this time.

866
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:22,986
Put your gun down, ma'am.

867
01:20:26,856 --> 01:20:28,491
You ain't winning
today, Sister.

868
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:31,194
Hand over the money.

869
01:20:31,194 --> 01:20:32,394
What keeps not too daily

870
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:47,725
Mick.

871
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:52,949
Now how about that money?

872
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:55,018
Who is he?

873
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:56,652
Joe.

874
01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:59,622
Joe Pepper.

875
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:01,157
I know you.

876
01:21:01,157 --> 01:21:03,092
You're that deputy
from Sweetwater.

877
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:05,962
The one everybody talks about.

878
01:21:05,962 --> 01:21:07,997
I remember that story.

879
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:09,232
You almost got
your brother killed

880
01:21:09,232 --> 01:21:11,634
'cause your pants were down.

881
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:13,369
Hell, you ain't
nothing but a boy.

882
01:21:18,274 --> 01:21:21,210
Your brother was beautiful
when I killed him.

883
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,679
[gunshots]

884
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:33,756
You chicken shit!

885
01:21:45,368 --> 01:21:48,504
You can't do it.

886
01:21:48,504 --> 01:21:50,106
That's why you needed me, Billy.

887
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:55,078
[gunshots]

888
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:06,956
Billy, get the money.

889
01:22:29,145 --> 01:22:30,846
Well, Sarah.

890
01:22:30,846 --> 01:22:33,016
Looks like it's time for you
to start fending for yourself.

891
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,088
You got a choice to make.

892
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:44,493
What's it gonna be?

893
01:22:50,933 --> 01:22:53,802
[guitar playing]

894
01:22:57,306 --> 01:23:00,509
(SINGING) And now the sun
is setting on the story

895
01:23:00,509 --> 01:23:04,913
of the rowdy girls, with
lives as tough or tougher

896
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:08,184
than in the man's world.

897
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:13,789
And in this land of freedom,
still great dangers lurk.

898
01:23:13,789 --> 01:23:16,625
But if you stand tall and
you're quick on the draw,

899
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,761
a woman can still make it work.

900
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:24,500
And you'll ride out west for
freedom like the rowdy girls.

901
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,702
Well, Viola, where to now?

902
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:28,804
Would you quit calling me that?

903
01:23:28,804 --> 01:23:31,540
San Francisco it is.

904
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:34,443
And who says you're going?

905
01:23:34,443 --> 01:23:36,912
I heard San Francisco
is so full of sinners

906
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:41,250
that a man of my extreme
youthful exuberance

907
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:45,154
and a woman of your
advanced age and expertise

908
01:23:45,154 --> 01:23:46,689
can live together in sin.

909
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:53,028
And it will be viewed as
a wholesome occurrence.

910
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:53,829
Hey, Sister.

911
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:54,897
Wait.

912
01:23:54,897 --> 01:23:56,099
Hell, Viola and Joe
are the next pillars

913
01:23:56,099 --> 01:23:59,034
of San Francisco society.

01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:03,272
I thought you had a
stagecoach to catch.

915
01:24:03,272 --> 01:24:05,241
I have something for you.

916
01:24:05,241 --> 01:24:08,277
Your mama's watch.

917
01:24:08,277 --> 01:24:09,912
I knew you would.

918
01:24:09,912 --> 01:24:10,713
Thank you.

919
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,588
Where's the rest of my money?

920
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:21,490
What money?

921
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:23,058
See you in San Francisco.

922
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:37,973
I know you like me.

923
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:45,948
Not a chance.

924
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:56,125
Well, you coming or what?

925
01:25:03,065 --> 01:25:07,136
MINSTREL (SINGING): And so ends
the story of the rowdy girls.

926
01:25:07,136 --> 01:25:07,936
