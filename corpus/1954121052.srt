1
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,438
Foxtrot 57 1 now entering third level.

2
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,036
- We've got one on the ground.
- OK.

3
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,356
You get her out, we'll take this guy.

4
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,274
One, two, three, lift!

5
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,953
Got it!

6
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,598
Steve, have you got it?

7
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,509
Yes.

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,316
Steve, you're dropping it!

9
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,709
l can't breathe!

10
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,150
l can't breathe!
l can't breathe! l can't breathe!

11
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,589
Hang on, Steve.

12
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,955
Hang on, l'm coming.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,718
Take your mask off, Steve.

14
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,398
Take your mask off.

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,078
Just forget what it's for, Steve.

16
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,917
Come on!

17
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,709
You're dead! Yourteam's compromised.

18
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,833
Leave your casualties
and get your officers to the surface.

19
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,117
We need to speed things up.

20
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,317
Why is it taking so long?

21
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,272
The decontamination unit
was in the wrong place.

22
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,395
The suits are hard to work in. lt's taking longer
than anticipated to recoverthe casualties.

23
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,352
- How many casualties are you using?
- 60.

24
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,109
60? How many people work in these offices?

25
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,676
- Two orthree thousand.
- So it's not exactly realistic, then?

26
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,713
- lt's manageable, Minister.
- The press are waiting, Minister.

27
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,557
Thank you.

28
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,391
- l need some help here.
- We've got you, mate.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,797
You'll be OK, mate.

30
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,072
That's it. Relax.

31
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,797
You'll be OK.

32
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,638
Let's get showered and out of these suits.

33
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,756
Turn around.

34
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,711
OK, good man.

35
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,069
Jenny, let's have a look at you.

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,239
Oh, shit.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,912
- You're dead, too.
- What?

38
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,918
You've got a tear. Your suit's ripped.

39
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,516
Get out, Jenny.

40
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,553
These drills must send a positive message.

41
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,674
1,600 gas-tight suits, 7,000 modesty packs,
ten mobile mass decontamination units.

42
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,917
The Home Secretary
wants us to reassure the public.

43
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,678
Understood.

44
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,032
lt's always worth reminding Londoners
how resilient they are.

45
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,071
l'll put that in the report, will l?

46
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,032
- OK?
- This was supposed to be easy.

47
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,878
- l've got Steve on the way to A&E.
- Why?

48
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,310
Hyperventilation. We're meant
to wearthe suits for 20 minutes.

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,797
lt was 16 minutes before we got
into the car park, and Jen got a tear.

50
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,469
That's what this drill is for,
to iron out these problems.

51
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,509
Biscuits?

52
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,917
Minister, how do you respond
to accusations of scaremongering?

53
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,239
We live in difficult times
and must be prepared for every eventuality.

54
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,033
These drills will reassure the British people

55
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,516
that we are doing all we can
to protect them against terrorism,

56
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,393
and that London is as prepared
as it can be.

57
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,272
This is part of the government's commitment
to be honest about threats,

58
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,154
and to put as much information
in the public domain as we can.

59
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,437
An emergency services drill was held today
to test new anti-terrorism measures.

60
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,268
The new Minister for London,
Nicola Painswick, reassured Londoners

61
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,915
that the drill was not linked
to any specific threat.

62
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,633
West Yorkshire police confirmed
that three men were arrested yesterday

63
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,071
outside the US Air Force monitoring station
at Menwith Hill.

64
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,510
The men are being held
under the Anti-Terrorism Act.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,117
Scotland Yard
declined to comment on whether...

66
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,352
lt's been a busy morning.
Two lrish nationals held at Dover.

67
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,119
A gun found in their car.
Officers are on their way.

68
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,597
US lntelligence have passed on six names
they want under surveillance.

69
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,679
The men arrested at Menwith Hill
have been confirmed as North African.

70
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,950
- Sir.
- Thank you.

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,313
The local police found notebooks
and video footage of the perimeter security.

72
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,999
We flagged up two addresses in London.

73
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,600
- What do we know?
- They could be GSPC.

74
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,952
Waiting for French and Algerian lntelligence
to get back. MOD want it low-key.

75
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,716
Fine. You're dealing with that one.

76
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,638
- lncident room is being set up.
- Good.

77
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,997
Excuse me.

78
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,319
- Excuse me. l'm looking for DS Drummer.
- Just overthere.

79
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,952
Thanks.

80
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,029
- DS Drummer? DC Habibullah.
- Great. l can give you five minutes.

81
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,275
Get up to speed on the briefing notes.

82
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,678
We assume the suspects are using false lDs.
They're North African, possibly Algerian.

83
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,429
They weren't acting alone,
so our job is to uncover cell members.

84
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,391
This is your desk here.

85
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,718
This is propaganda material, videos, letters,
recovered from a B&B in Leeds,

86
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,513
and the suspects' addresses in London.

87
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,314
Go through all that lot.
Most of it's in Arabic.

88
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,557
- What languages have you got?
- Urdu, Punjabi, Arabic.

89
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,434
Great. Normally,
l get stuck with a civilian translator.

90
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,359
l'll need you in interviews.
Help me understand what makes them tick.

91
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,679
- How would l know? l'm from Luton, Sarge.
- You're better qualified than l am, Detective.

92
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,077
- Mike, can l have a word?
- Yes. DC Habibullah, this is Dl Brook.

93
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,759
- Sir.
- Glad you're on board.

94
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,597
Get yourself settled.

95
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,751
l'm in A&E.

96
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,269
No, l'm fine. lt's Steve.

97
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,191
Can you pop down?

98
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,077
Hi.

99
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,598
Hello.

100
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,437
Thank you.

101
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,317
- How is he?
- He'll live.

102
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,271
The drill went well, then?

103
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,514
l'm finished in half an hour.
We could go home together.

104
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,357
Yeah.

105
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,597
Well, l'd better make sure
Steve gets back all right.

106
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,717
You know, if that had been for real,

107
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,955
two of my crew would be dead.

108
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,593
Deputy Assistant Commissioner lves,

109
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,953
you have stated that we must now expect
terrorists to use crude CBRN weapons

110
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,719
that could cause mass devastation to this city.

111
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,115
Could you explain what that means?

112
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,232
We're talking about such things
as a dirty bomb...

113
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,876
..which is low-grade radioactive material,
blown up by a conventional bomb.

114
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,358
Low-tech methods for contaminating
large numbers of people with deadly agents.

115
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,435
Thank you.

116
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,153
Minister, in a public statement,

117
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,478
you said, ''The government is committed
to being honest about threats,

118
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,671
''and putting information in the public domain.''

119
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,676
Yes, that is correct.

120
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,510
l have here a report from the Commons
Science and Technology Committee.

121
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,553
lt accuses the government
of being embedded in a culture of secrecy.

122
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,195
This seems to be
a direct contradiction to your statement.

123
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,438
The government rejects the criticism
that it is less open than it need be.

124
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,994
We have an active
public information campaign.

125
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,076
We've sent a booklet to every house...

126
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:44,070
Are you confident the information is adequate
to prepare the public for a terrorist attack?

127
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,314
Of course.

128
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,718
Obviously, there are times when disclosure
would not be in the public interest.

129
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,990
l'm sorry, but now l'm confused.

130
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,239
You're open and transparent,
except when it suits the government not to be.

131
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,400
Obviously, there has to be a balance
between truth and reassurance.

132
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,956
Are you saying it's acceptable
to lie to the public to reassure them?

133
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,470
What the public can be told,
and the need for secrecy...

134
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,080
Very interesting, but this report states,

135
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,398
''Lack of openness has resulted
in the public being ill-informed

136
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,719
''and insufficiently prepared for a chemical,
biological, or radiological attack.''

137
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,752
Deputy Assistant Commissioner,
as Head of the Anti-Terrorist Branch,

138
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,475
do you feel adequate measures
are in place to protect the public?

139
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,035
lmprovements have been made
across all emergency services,

140
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,719
but l'd warn against complacency.

141
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,035
A great deal of work needs to be done.

142
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,757
Thank you very much.

143
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,751
John.

144
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,399
That was public record.

145
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,639
And l'm not going on public record
to say we're fully prepared when we're not.

146
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,436
We've allocated ?330,000,000
on homeland security.

147
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,677
That's a huge commitment when the public
wants hospital beds.

148
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,517
What else do you expect us to do?

149
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,190
ln the States, they're spending 15 times
more per head. They don't think it's enough.

150
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,198
So all the work we're doing counts for nothing?

151
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,073
Don't confuse activity with achievement.

152
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,832
Out of 30,000 officers, the Met have 1,500
with protective suits and two days' training.

153
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,758
We'd struggle with a conventional attack.

154
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,712
- lf a CBRN weapon went off...
- lf it went off.

155
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,877
l've seen al-Qaeda's plans
forthese weapons.

156
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,638
We knew 90% of what the lRA
were up to and they got through.

157
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,319
With this lot, we're lucky if we know 20%.

158
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,271
lt's naive to hope it won't happen.

159
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,993
- How are you?
- Fine.

160
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,352
- OK, this is stamped, marked from lstanbul.
- Right.

161
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,117
- You all right?
- Something l ate.

162
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,958
Yeah? You want to leave that goulash alone.

163
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,198
Cheers. Got the other one?
The little one. That's it.

164
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,759
Cheers.

165
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,232
Come in, Mr Rashid.
You know, this is a very popular area.

166
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,755
There's a post office close by.

167
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,554
Also, the tubes are five minutes away.

168
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,557
Buses, and there's a market on Saturday.

169
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,632
Show me the cellar.

170
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,070
- We'll need all this cleared.
- lt'll cost you.

171
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,236
How much?

172
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,077
70 quid.

173
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,197
We have accommodation forthe bride's family.

174
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,599
This isn't the lRA.

175
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,712
With this lot, we don't know
who or where they are.

176
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,877
We have no inside informants
and they don't give warnings.

177
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,396
First thing to understand about lslamist
terrorist groups, there's no single cell.

178
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,829
Don't write it down, remember it.

179
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,156
The logistics cell. These boys
will be embedded in the target country.

180
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,273
They're likely to be British nationals,
so they'll stay low-key.

181
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,916
They won't associate with known extremists.
They may not even attend mosque.

182
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,109
Found the house.

183
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,709
They raise cash through petty crime
like credit card fraud.

184
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,719
They provide passports, safe houses,
equipment, et cetera.

185
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,673
They gather all the elements
that make an operation possible.

186
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,669
The three North Africans at Menwith Hill
recently entered the country underfalse lDs.

187
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,748
- So they won't be part of logistics cells.
- Correct, they're checking out the base.

188
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,480
The sole purpose of a reconnaissance cell

189
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,717
is to gather intelligence on intended targets.

190
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,074
They're closer to the planning of an attack,

191
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,839
and far more likely to be foreign nationals.

192
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,993
Neither the logistics nor the reconnaissance
cell would be your suicide bombers.

193
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,917
The attack cell.

194
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,554
These boys will be battle-hardened veterans.

195
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,797
Jihad nutters who fought
in Chechnya, Bosnia, Kashmir.

196
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,558
Nutters, Sarge?

197
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,636
Fanatics. However you want to describe them.

198
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,958
Almost certain to be foreign nationals,
brought in at the last stages.

199
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,958
And as we know, in any attack,

200
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,958
there's likely to be more than one attack cell.

201
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,190
Our problem is, none of this lot
will know who the other cells are,

202
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,232
or have detailed knowledge
about the overall operation.

203
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,838
But...

204
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,757
they all have links...

205
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,111
to one man.

206
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,390
The agent isn't the mastermind.

207
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,752
That person will be thousands of miles away
in Pakistan or Afghanistan.

208
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,952
The agent is the manager.

209
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,709
He puts the cells together
and executes the plan.

210
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,673
He'll be white-collar, well-travelled, educated,

211
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,678
and have lived in the West for several years.

212
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,474
He'll have multiple identities
and impeccable cover.

213
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,999
He could be a doctor, a lawyer,
a university professor.

214
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,190
The point is, he'll be invisible,

215
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,198
and skilled at hiding his tracks.

216
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,877
So far, all we have are three suspects,
a possible reconnaissance cell.

217
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,876
lf we're to get the rest of them,

218
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,879
we chase every person they've ever been
in contact with, here or abroad.

219
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,399
Follow every papertrail.

220
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,671
Anything that strikes you, however small,
let me know.

221
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,837
You don't listen to me.

222
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,509
- We need fags.
- Yeah.

223
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,028
Could l get 20 JPS, please?

224
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,519
And a Sim card for my mobile
and a pay-as-you-go top-up card, please.

225
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,351
What?

226
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,598
Oh, piss off!

227
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,755
Let's go.

228
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,116
How are you settling in?

229
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,152
l'm still trying to find my way around, but fine.

230
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,634
You had a grilling at the Select Committee.

231
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,831
The Chair got hung up
on the issue of public information.

232
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,110
- May l?
- Of course.

233
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,558
lt's easy to present it in black-and-white
if you're not making the decisions.

234
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,195
Maybe we're not doing enough
to train and prepare the public.

235
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,199
lf a CBRN attack happens,
we could end up with mass panic.

236
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,151
l've been in Whitehall 25 years.

237
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,351
There have been 80 terrorist attacks
on the mainland.

238
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,075
Why assume the public
will run around like headless chickens?

239
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,156
We're talking suicide bombers.

240
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,998
No warnings,
biological weapons, dirty bombs.

241
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,350
lf you start issuing gas masks
to everyone using the tubes,

242
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,152
you risk causing panic.

243
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,478
Al-Qaeda want us scared. lf you fuel
public anxiety, you play into their hands.

244
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,909
- l understand.
- Think of the implications.

245
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,270
Business withdrawing,
the tourist industry hit.

246
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,551
Local authorities
are using Madrid to demand extra funds.

247
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,478
We don't want kneejerk reactions
from the public.

248
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,034
Don't you take the CBRN threat seriously?

249
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,833
l'm saying it's a difficult balance.

250
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,668
Overreaction can be as dangerous
as underreaction.

251
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,999
As Minister of London, it's your responsibility
to reassure the public and business.

252
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,989
Everything is being done to make London
as prepared as it possibly can be.

253
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,716
lt's an issue that's easy to get
worked up about from the back benches.

254
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,638
Neverthat simple when you're minister.

255
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,754
This is the last one, anyway.
We've already checked it.

256
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,237
Sorry.

257
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,920
Mogul Prince Takeaway.

258
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,951
Speaking.

259
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,639
Yeah.

260
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,469
Will you be there after midnight?

261
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,559
Bye.

262
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,635
The train now arriving at platform 4
is the 17..50, Paris, Gare du Nord.

263
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,156
Please ensure you
do not leave your baggage unattended...

264
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,910
- Why am l getting calls from Customs?
- What?

265
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,311
They want to know why one of my officers
is inquiring about D&L Shipping.

266
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,352
lt's a name l came across
in the suspects' notebooks.

267
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,756
- l ran it through NClS database.
- l told you to let me know.

268
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,836
Sorry, you're right.

269
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,838
Did Customs tell you what their interest is?

270
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,509
They believe Turkish mafia
are using D&L as a smuggling drop.

271
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,790
Shit, it would be Customs.

272
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,549
Any chance they'll let us look
at their phone records and manifests?

273
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,469
- They're not gonna rush to share information.
- lt's only paperwork.

274
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,839
You must know someone
that owes you a favour.

275
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,838
l'll talk to Brook. l've run out of favours.

276
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,514
Have you everything you need?

277
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,073
For now.

278
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,112
We need a large lead sheet to make a hatch.

279
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,836
Just a precaution.

280
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,112
Come upstairs,
l'll introduce you properly to your brothers.

281
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,239
- Got any plans tonight?
- Why, have we heard from Customs?

282
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,316
You must be joking.

283
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,510
Come on, you can leave that.

284
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,559
That's yours.

285
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,355
Check he hasn't spiked it.

286
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,035
So, Sameena,

287
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,548
if they're not nutters, what's it all about?

288
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,752
- You're being serious?
- We can talk about football, if you like.

289
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,110
Do you mean blowing themselves up,
fundamentalism, what?

290
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,711
lf yourfamily's killed in front of you
in Chechnya, it might cross your mind.

291
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,196
But why would a third-generation Bradford kid
join al-Qaeda?

292
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,198
lt doesn't matter
if you're from Bradford or Saudi.

293
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,391
lf you're a Muslim,
you're a part of a widerfamily.

294
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,514
What happens in Chechnya,
Kashmir or Palestine is happening to you.

295
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,348
lt's a long way from that
to strapping explosives to yourself.

296
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,153
Yeah, but what these boys see
makes them angry.

297
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,509
Extremist groups exploit that anger.

298
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,997
They recruit men all overthe world,
get them into camps and focus that anger.

299
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,314
lt's brainwashing.

300
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,078
They hand them a Kalashnikov,

301
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,635
convince them it's their holy duty
to die in the defence of lslam.

302
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,118
When they ask forfive martyrs,
hundreds step forward.

303
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,230
How do you feel about that?

304
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,037
Pissed off.

305
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,874
These fanatics are just a tiny minority,
and people think we're all like that.

306
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,558
l take my faith seriously.

307
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,799
l care about the world, but you don't see me
strapping explosives to myself, do you?

308
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,868
- So that's why you joined the police?
- No, l wasn't clever enough to be a doctor.

309
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,508
Sameena?

310
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,588
Phone records and manifests from D&L
Shipping, courtesy of ourfriends at Customs.

311
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,631
Good hunting.

312
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,910
- Sameena, see you in the morning.
- Yeah.

313
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,118
Even before the terrible events in Madrid,

314
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,711
London's emergency services were
being prepared for a majorterrorist attack.

315
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,359
Under our New Dimensions initiative,

316
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,076
London Fire Brigade have been equipped
with extended-life breathing apparatus.

317
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,795
They have over 1,600 gas-tight suits

318
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,833
and new radiation dosimeters in all engines.

319
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,998
Senior officers are receiving
state-of-the-art training in Texas.

320
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:59,195
There are ten mobile mass decontamination
units established right across the capital.

321
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,394
The success of the recent drill

322
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,116
is a clear demonstration of how capable
London's emergency services are

323
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,038
in dealing with incidents
of major contamination.

324
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,798
Who's been telling herthis?

325
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,400
Of course, we can't afford to be complacent.

326
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,758
But London is now better prepared
than it has ever been.

327
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,791
Thank you very much.

328
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,034
Minister, this is Commander Paul Hardwick.

329
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,755
He's one of our gold commanders
in charge of GT control room.

330
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,110
- Commander.
- Pleased to meet you, Minister.

331
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,152
Minister, were you at the same drill l was?

332
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,873
- Sorry, you are...
- Murray Corrigan.

333
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,911
Watch Commander, London Fire Service.

334
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,269
That drill was a farce, wasn't it?

335
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,117
Have you ever worn a GT suit?

336
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,472
You can't work in them.
They're unwieldy. You boil.

337
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,671
What you're asking us to do
with this equipment is unreal.

338
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,915
We've had a lot of problems with our kit.

339
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,713
Clive Phelps, London Ambulance Service.

340
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,558
Half our suits were defective.
We sent them back.

341
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,875
The decon showers blew the heads off.

342
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,639
l appreciate your concerns.
That's why we drill.

343
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,433
That wasn't a drill, it was a PR stunt.

344
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,199
Controlled conditions, cadets as casualties.

345
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,152
- We're constantly reviewing our plans.
- Your plans.

346
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,318
l have never been consulted,
never been invited to any strategy meetings.

347
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,920
l haven't even seen your new procedures.

348
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,114
You'll appreciate we have to limit access
to plans in the interests of national security.

349
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,799
What a fucking great excuse
for incompetence!

350
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,670
- l'm sorry, Minister.
- l understand. Change can be unsettling.

351
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,599
With respect, my officers trained as firemen.

352
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,313
Now they're the frontline in your war on terror.

353
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,919
They're putting their lives at risk
and none of us know if your plans work.

354
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,552
Excuse me.

355
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,559
- We have the barrels.
- Around the back.

356
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,518
- What did he say?
- Take it round the back.

357
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,912
l used to really look forward to going to work.

358
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,916
They're perfectly happy to spend
billions on lraq, Ml5, a sexy new British FBl.

359
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,157
You'd think they could spend
a bit more on us.

360
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,319
The rumour is that the first officers in
are expendable.

361
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,352
Maybe that's why
they don't want to waste their money.

362
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,790
lf you really believe that,
perhaps you should get out.

363
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,958
Whatever you decide to do, l'll support you.

364
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,870
- What happened?
- Well, what have you heard?

365
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,232
Murray Corrigan, report
to the Station Commander's office now.

366
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,271
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,515
l'm expecting a call any minute
demanding l put you on charges.

368
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,632
l'll be a watch commander down, right?

369
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,752
We've already lost two senior officers
this year.

370
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,150
Bollocks. l'm resigning anyway.

371
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,910
Mobilise, mobilise. Foxtrot 57 1, Foxtrot 572.

372
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,159
Road traffic accident at thejunction
of Commercial Road and Cannon Street.

373
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,077
Three calls to a Leeds address,
nothing logged, local are looking into it.

374
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,315
Seven calls to a Kentish Town address.

375
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,830
Flagged, NCS already investigating,
we're talking to them.

376
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,112
One call to an address in Neasden,
the Mogul Prince Takeaway, logged.

377
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,915
A Muslim neighbour called the anti-terrorist
hotline about two men living above the shop.

378
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,712
lt might be something.

379
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,479
ln her statement,
she describes them as fanatics.

380
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,988
- Do we know who they are?
- We're checking.

381
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,555
l could send an officer over
to talk to her, get more details.

382
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,797
You go. She'll find it easy talking to you.

383
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,117
Thanks.

384
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,749
- Did you get the number?
- No.

385
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,873
You said that they were moving barrels.

386
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,028
Anything else makes you suspicious?

387
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,592
You described them as fanatics
to the hotline.

388
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,958
- l don't trust them.
- Something in the way they behave?

389
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,397
What did they say?

390
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,073
You understand?

391
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,231
We're rare.

392
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,911
But they are proud.

393
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,876
Rashid Dhar and lmran Nazir.

394
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,037
Both registered at 66A Craven Lane.

395
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,197
Both claiming benefits, both British nationals.

396
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,473
Neither has a record, nor has been associated
with extremist groups, as far as we know.

397
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,389
Check with provincial forces, see
if there is anything else. Any travel detail?

398
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,877
Both have multiple entry visas
for Pakistan and Saudi.

399
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,195
That doesn't necessarily mean anything.

400
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,633
Family trips, pilgrimage to Mecca. Half my
relatives would be suspects based on that.

401
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,117
You're the one asking for surveillance.
There's other leads we could be chasing.

402
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,151
Yes or no?

403
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,028
My instinct is that
the woman is right about them.

404
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,036
Fine.

405
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,917
He's got the wheel in his ribs,

406
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,952
and l'm saying,
''There's no other way to get you out.''

407
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,434
- Was he all right?
- He'll be fine.

408
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,119
Anyway, there he is, trapped in his car.

409
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,913
His phone's ringing. He starts looking for it.

410
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,349
He answers it and it's his girlfriend.

411
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,996
She's in a restaurant waiting for him.
They're supposed to be having lunch.

412
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:47,956
And he says, ''Love, l'm trapped in the car
and l've got firemen chopping me out of it.''

413
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,356
She doesn't believe him,
goes off on one, so he hands it to me.

414
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,631
She's furious.
l've never heard anything like it.

415
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,549
- What, with him for being late?
- No, for crashing the car. lt's her car.

416
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,556
- Did she calm down?
- Eventually.

417
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,717
Anyway, l saved him. l saved his relationship.

418
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,479
- l killed the car.
- My hero!

419
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,676
So you're not resigning, then?

420
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,312
Well, what else would l do?

421
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,477
Decorate the kitchen, fix the guttering.

422
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,750
Look, l'm sorry l was so down.

423
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,914
lt's OK, l understand.
l work forthe National Health.

424
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,838
- Hi.
- Welcome, my pleasure.

425
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,077
l hope you're well
and l hope yourfamily is well.

426
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,069
l'm sorry, l don't understand.

427
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,153
- l want you gone by Monday.
- Why Monday?

428
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,076
You've done your job well.

429
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,513
Unknown leaving.
Repeat, unknown leaving.

430
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,120
Stay with original target.

431
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,315
This is where he wipes his cup.

432
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,794
l'd say this stranger is his superior.

433
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,149
You saw the way he behaved
when Dhar stood.

434
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,634
- We got any DNA?
- Forensics has the cup.

435
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,069
What are the chances
of an lD from the photo?

436
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,033
lt's with Five and Six. lt could take
up to 48 hours before you hear back.

437
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,399
What do we know?

438
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,910
We found a reference for D&L
in one of the North African's notebooks.

439
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,316
A phone call was logged from D&L
to Mogul Prince Takeaway.

440
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,191
Dhar and Nazir both work there.

441
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,118
An eyewitness saw them
unloading barrels at night.

442
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,199
Customs believe D&L is used
by a lot of foreign outfits.

443
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,516
Are we just looking at
petty crooks smuggling lDs?

444
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,270
They're devout and disciplined. We've
identified extremist literature on their shelves.

445
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,199
They covertheirtracks.
This suggests that they've been trained.

446
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,233
- Have we found the North African logistic cell?
- No, l don't think so.

447
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,629
Why not?

448
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,070
These boys are Pakistani.
They operate through different networks.

449
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:58,194
So we could've stumbled upon a logistics cell
for a completely separate operation?

450
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,152
- Yes, sir.
- Shit.

451
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,078
We'll have a better idea
when we know who he is.

452
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,550
lf the lion was to come suddenly and go, ''Grrr'',

453
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,751
do you think the camel orthe lion
would be more stronger?

454
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,991
There is deepening concern
about the rising violence in lraq.

455
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,919
Faced with continued unrest
and a hostage crisis...

456
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,398
..some of the militant Shiite forces.

457
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,598
These canisters all contain
radioactive material in powderform.

458
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,395
These smaller ones contain alpha sources.
This you can handle safely.

459
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,035
lt's only dangerous if you get it on your skin
or you inhale it.

460
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,748
Breathe it in.

461
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,475
You must wearthese masks
when you work with it.

462
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,196
These larger ones contain gamma radiation.
This is much more dangerous.

463
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,631
ln this concentration, as soon as that lid
is open, you've got 60 seconds.

464
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,911
Afterthat,
it's going to make you very, very sick.

465
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,476
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

466
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,272
The operation shouldn't take
more than four minutes.

467
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,915
- Sorry to drag you in.
- How long is this going to take?

468
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,192
There's a chance that radioactive material
has been smuggled in.

469
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,629
A body was found in Bulgaria last Tuesday.

470
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,750
He's been identified as Usman Selcuk,

471
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,917
a Turkish shipping agent
and a suspected smuggler.

472
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,713
He'd had a fatal dose of gamma radiation.

473
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,959
At least 50 different shipments left this man's
depot in Sofia one week priorto his death.

474
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,912
Destined for 17 countries, the UK among them.

475
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,552
Why are we worried?

476
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,751
lt may be a logistics cell
with links to the Turkish cartel.

477
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,349
His body was discovered five days ago.
Why are we hearing this now?

478
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,153
Five didn't considerthe intel a priority.

479
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,509
- Oh, God.
- All right, thank you.

480
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,070
Get me Dl Lane and DS Drummer.

481
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,515
Did you put the lids back on?

482
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,915
- The lids. Are they on?
- No.

483
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,435
Close the hatch!

484
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:52,512
Five have identified the man who met with
Rashid Dhar as Ahmed lbraham Abassi.

485
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,633
A Jordanian management consultant
studying at London University,

486
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,955
living in the UKwith his wife and child.

487
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,398
He's also lived in Cairo, Hamburg and Paris.

488
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,230
Now, his credentials seem legitimate but
we know he accepted passports from Dhar,

489
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,430
and that he wiped his fingerprints.

490
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,069
Do we know where he is?

491
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,079
A previous address. We're trying to get
a current one from the college.

492
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,554
We do have another problem.

493
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,116
Surveillance on Dhar and Nazir say
they're packing, possibly destroying evidence.

494
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,196
Shall we pick them up?

495
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,674
l'd preferto keep watching.

496
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,508
l'm confident they're not an attack cell.
Let's see where they take us.

497
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,028
How serious is the radiation threat?

498
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,959
We've no evidence
that radioactive material's been smuggled in.

499
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,117
Has anything come up
on radiation detectors in ports?

500
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,199
No, but there's been no intel.
They check ten-20% of the cargo.

501
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,708
Even if the Turk
was smuggling a gamma source,

502
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,035
there's no link to him and Nazir and Dhar.

503
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,640
lt could've gone to any number of clients.

504
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,593
643 incidents
of radiation trafficking in the last six years.

505
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,312
They're the ones we know about.

506
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,751
And we've no intel suggesting
a dirty bomb threat to the UK.

507
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,557
You've gone back to Five and Six?

508
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,192
Are they certain about that?

509
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,360
We're trawling all intelligence noise
just in case they missed something.

510
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,595
l'm not happy that Dhar and Nazir are packing.
Turn theirflat over.

511
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,473
And D&L Shipping.
l'll square it with Customs later.

512
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,399
Take CBRN teams and pick up Abassi,
before tomorrow if possible.

513
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,399
lf we spook him and lose him,
that's the risk l'll have to take.

514
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,473
Armed police!

515
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,510
He's got a gun! Police! Get down!

516
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,838
- Look at the light!
- Stay on your back!

517
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,599
- Look at the light!
- Stay lying down.

518
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,073
Give us your name!

519
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,750
lmran Nazir, l'm arresting you
underthe Terrorism Act.

520
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,157
Rashid Dhar, l'm arresting you
on suspicion of terrorist...

521
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,589
Hold on. l want a chat first.

522
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,750
Bag these separately, OK?

523
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,919
No sign of those barrels anywhere.

524
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,952
That's funny,
cos we know you picked them up.

525
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,637
What was in the barrels, Rashid?
Where are they now?

526
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,310
We know you only started packing yesterday.
Why the hurry?

527
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,669
What did Abassi tell you to do?

528
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,395
What the fuck was that?

529
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,356
Mobilise, mobilise. Foxtrot 57 1, Foxtrot 572.
Major incident.

530
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,756
Large explosion,

531
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,872
That's pump engine
and pump ladder to investigate.

532
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,835
Foxtrot 57 1 responding.

533
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,315
We've lost all our people.

534
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,838
- What just happened, Paul?
- A large explosion, Liverpool Street.

535
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,916
lt could be gas, plane down or a bomb.

536
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,315
Still trying to contact City Police.

537
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,432
Got a visual,
north end of Bishopsgate, on two.

538
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,556
..probable incendiary device.

00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,990
Repeat, ground zero is Liverpool...

540
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,758
Shit!

541
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,394
Has anyone checked for contamination?

542
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,640
Foxtrot 57 1 to Control.

543
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,798
Mobile to incident.

546
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,154
Stop the engine, Ralph.

547
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,673
Keep moving, keep moving.

548
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,314
This way, this way.

549
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,031

553
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,349
Holding position, over.

554
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,836
Foxtrot 57 1 from Control, recalled. Recalled.

555
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:52,478
Foxtrot 57 1 to Control,
we have suspected mass casualties.

556
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,874
We have serious fire hazards.

557
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,959
We need all services at site ASAP.
We have a major incident.

558
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,956
Repeat, major incident.

559
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,036
Control to Foxtrot 57 1,
pull out of site. Radioactive.

560
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,878
Repeat, all units recalled immediately.

561
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,275
Repeat.. recall. RVfollowing.

562
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,918
Foxtrot 57 1, status two received.

563
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,155
Back up!

564
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,315
Keep moving, everyone. Follow the engine.

565
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,158
We're being recalled.
We've got to get out of here.

566
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,558
Fire Control report several units approaching
the site are recording high levels of radiation.

567
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,637
Reports are from entry routes
surrounding incident.

568
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,912
North Bishopsgate, London Wall, Houndsditch,
corner of Threadneedle and Bishopsgate.

569
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,839
Get that helicopter back. Get the bomb squad,
find out what we're dealing with.

570
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,952
lf it's radiation in this bomb, how bad is it?

571
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,434
l need dirty bomb plans on all terminals.

572
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,948
l need safe sites for a marshalling area.

573
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,833
No more emergency vehicles
are to enterthe site.

574
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,713
Personnel already committed
are contaminated.

575
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,355
They must withdraw and stay put
till we know where to set up decon.

576
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,992
..definitely contaminated.

577
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,793
We got high levels of radiation on site.

578
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,791
Any officers reach ground zero?

579
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,638
Tom, get me fire, ambulance, military liaison.

580
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,468
lnform Number 10. See how long
it'll take government liaison to get here.

581
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,229
- They want to know where to withdraw to.
- Tell them, 400...

582
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,239
No, 500 metres
and tell them to stay put until further notice.

583
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,396
All units, withdraw to 500 metres.

584
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,159
We need potential target locations cordoned.

585
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,079
lf it's suicide bombers,
we have to expect secondary devices.

586
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:37,114
Sergeant, any way l can look at CCTVfootage
of Liverpool Street before the incident?

587
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,310
Hang on. We can't play that back here.

588
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,830
l can patch you through
to the surveillance suite at Woods Street.

589
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,871
- Jo.
- l'm onto it.

590
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,115
lt's line one, Bomb lncident Room.

591
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,751
Sir, ambulance want to know
what to do with casualties.

592
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,837
Take them to hospital,
they take contamination with them.

593
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,919
lf it's life or death, it's the ambulance call
but they must liaise with A&Es.

594
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,474
What about casualties at ground zero?

595
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,796
- We'll deal with that later.
- Yeah, go ahead.

596
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,035
Move along, please, move along.

597
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,279
Move away from the area!
Move away from the area!

598
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,551
- What's going on?
- Move back, please, just get back.

599
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,149
- Where to?
- Just get back now. Please, move away.

600
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,909
That way, sir, that way.

601
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,797
Keep moving, please.

602
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,591
Please, keep moving.

603
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,275
All fire ground personnel
returning from incident

604
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,914
must go through decontamination
before entering marshalling area.

605
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,755
Yeah? All right. Thanks, Dave.

606
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,228
- Name.
- Murray Corrigan.

607
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,919
- Corrigan. Rank?
- Watch Commander.

608
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,235
- Dosimeter reading?
- 43.

609
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,510
- 43, you're clean.
- OK?

610
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,311
- Any of you guys got a mobile that works?
- No.

611
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,396
No?

612
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,957
Keep moving, keep moving.
Move! Move it along.

613
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,310
God, are you all right? Let me help.

614
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,113
- No way.
- You have to leave your car.

615
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,157
No, the other way. Keep moving.

616
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,273
No one here has been able to confirm
that the bomb is radioactive.

617
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,711
But it's obvious here that there is fear
of some form of contamination.

618
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:45,834
Behind me, police are moving people
back from the area as quickly as they can.

619
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,474
We don't know if this is merely a precaution,

620
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,035
or whether the blast was, in fact,
some kind of dirty bomb.

621
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,479
ls this you, you bastard?

622
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,433
We've not been able to get closer
than 400 yards to the site of the blast.

623
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,632
What's even more alarming is that
emergency vehicles are being held back.

624
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,591
- Hold the line. Sir?
- Yes?

625
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,677
Liverpool Street are holding trains
outside the station.

626
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,871
- They want to know where to disembark.
- Tell them to hold.

627
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,275
No one can leave the area
without decontamination.

628
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,596
Tom, what's the weekday population
of the Square Mile?

629
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,437
Over 300,000.

630
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,315
But if you include the surrounding
residential areas, closerto a million.

631
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,430
Get back to me on that as soon as you can.

632
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,072
You're sure?

633
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,838
This lady needs a hospital.

634
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,950
- To the front.
- Can you help?

635
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,039
- You can't stay here. Move back.
- l've got seriously injured people.

636
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,072
The instructions are,
leave casualties you can't move.

637
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:50,592
Tell them that. We're not going anywhere
till we get some medical assistance.

638
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,551
Prat.

639
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,478
Come on. Come on, keep moving.

640
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,554
l've got an image outside Liverpool Street.

641
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,589
Sir?

642
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,393
Tell me what you see.

643
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,795
lt's a white Transit van.

644
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,876
Two people in the cab.

645
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,756
Can't see the registration.

646
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,952
Whoa! Shit!

647
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,479
What?

648
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,637
They were in the van when it went up, sir.

649
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,389
- Checking to see if l can get the number...
- White van. Suicide bomber.

650
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,195
Check for other suspect vehicles. Under
no circumstances must an officer approach.

651
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,719
Sir.

652
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,910
OK, officers on the streets...

653
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,717
l need a patch to surveillance units covering
Canary Wharf, lsle of Dogs, Tower Bridge.

654
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,990
- Repeat, Canary Wharf...
- ..parked white vans...

655
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,110
Confirmed, two people in the van.

656
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,755
Number plate
X-ray 334, X-ray Bravo Romeo.

657
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,713
..Parliament Square, Oxford Street,
central London, Westminster Bridge.

658
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,548
- X-ray 334, X-ray Bravo Romeo. Confirm.
- Correct.

659
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,718
Put this plate through the ring of steel camera.
lt'll give us the driver's face.

660
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,318
l've got something else.

661
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,271
They swapped drivers.

662
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,151
There were three people in the van.

663
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:21,069
- They switched drivers inside the ring of steel.
- Original drivergot out in Bishopsgate.

664
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,238
We know this man.

665
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,113
l'm sending you a photo.
Ahmed lbraham Abassi.

666
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,755
- l'll need an all-ports, he'll be using false lD.
- Get on to DS Drummer.

667
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,157
You can go if you want.

668
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,152
Where is Abassi?

669
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,952
What's he planning?

670
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,273
What's the next target?

671
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:04,673
Sarge, fire and ambulance need to know
where to send mass decon units.

672
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:09,111
We've got to establish hot and cold zones first.
Just give me a moment.

673
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:14,439
How can we do this? We're getting wildly
different readings from all overthe place.

674
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,233
Alan, what does it say in the procedure?

675
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,718
Fragmentation.

676
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,196
lt's vital to make
fragmentation distance assessment,

677
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,913
to allow for microclimate differentiation.

678
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,236
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Where's the Science Officer?

679
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,919
- Struggling to get in.
- Get him on the radio.

680
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,554
Get the Met Office.
Which way's the wind blowing?

681
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,718
Sir, Fire are getting reports
of casualties still trapped at ground zero.

682
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,834
lndia 99 to Control. We now have
secondary fires in surrounding buildings.

683
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,836
Maintaining safe distance. Over.

684
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:52,113
All units must await further instructions.
No vehicles...

685
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,038
So what's the plan?
Why are we just standing here?

686
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,229
We're on hold.

687
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:59,670
We've got suits and breathing apparatus,
we should be in there.

688
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,792
We still don't know what we're dealing with.

689
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,512
We're losing the golden hour.

690
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,154
There are people alive
and we've abandoned them.

691
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,395
We don't do that.

692
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,630
We can't give you an estimate
on the casualties.

693
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,716
We have no officers on the ground.

694
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,716
We'll give confirmation as soon as...

695
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,115
l can't reach Liz.

696
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,278
All the networks are down, mate.
l'm sure she'll be fine.

697
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:29,316
Let me stress right now that for someone
who was not caught in the blast,

698
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,716
who was away
from the site of the blast itself,

699
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:37,880
such a person is at very little risk to health,
certainly in the immediate...

700
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,278
Sir, Science Officer says they're getting
both alpha and gamma radiation readings.

701
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,392
No one should be deployed
without CBRN protection.

702
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,634
Understood.

703
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,797
People should cover their faces
with whatever they can.

704
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,593
They should cover any cuts and abrasions.

705
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:59,431
Sir, St Luke's and Mile End hospitals are
being overwhelmed by self-presenters.

706
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,277
The crowd is contaminated.

707
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,312
Hospitals requesting police to hold them back.

708
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,112
Tell them they'll have to wait.

709
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,675
- Can we spare the men?
- The inner cordon's a kilometre diameter.

710
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,188
So the outer cordon will need 1,000 officers.

711
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,630
- How many have you got with suits?
- 500. Mostly TSG.

712
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,559
Military liaison say they can mobilise
200 troops within the hour.

713
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,036
That's a last resort.
No soldiers on a civilian cordon.

714
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,868
The most important thing
for anyone inside the hot zone

715
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:31,755
is to be decontaminated before trying
to go home to their families.

716
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:36,112
Otherwise they risk taking
a radioactive contamination back to...

717
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,631
Contaminated people are getting out.
Suits or not, we have to contain this.

718
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,990
Listen up.
l want manned barriers at 2,000 metres.

719
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,318
Filter everyone in that area
into decon cordons. Try to hold those lines.

720
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,557
No one to cross
until mass decon is set up. Understood?

721
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,158
Sir.

722
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:57,159
They're afraid they might have been
contaminated and they want help.

723
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,794
l'll be far more useful down there.

724
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,116
They need to see a government face
on the front line.

725
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:07,073
Staff here are insisting
they can only treat serious casualties.

726
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:11,511
They're refusing entry to the
many minor injuries caused by flying glass.

727
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:15,439
- Someone has to reassure them.
- There's a lack of clear information.

728
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,870
- The press are already at the cordons.
- ..is fuelling anger.

729
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,275
- Thank you, Jonathan.
- Great.

730
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,912
We're receiving reports

731
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,999
confirming that all emergency vehicles
have been withdrawn

732
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,838
from what they're calling ground zero.

733
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,596
Confirm, van at Telecom Tower
has two people in cab.

734
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,791
Numberplate for Canary Wharf van
not registered.

735
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,875
Dead end, sir.

736
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,718
Reports of a third suspect van
parked with driver.

737
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,789
Between Abbey Orchard Street
and St Peter's Street.

738
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:49,435
- Between Abbey Orchard Street...
- Back of the DTl, Westminster.

739
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,471
Back of the DTl, Westminster.

740
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,871
Coming on screen now.

741
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,592
OK, can you tilt down?

742
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,599
Further.

743
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,476
Can you zoom in further?

744
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,794
- ls that the best we can get?
- Another camera?

745
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,400
Mr lves, we need you to make a statement.

746
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:18,239
- Another angle?
- That's the best they've got, sir.

747
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,870
l want SO19 in place,
with riflemen where possible.

748
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,071
Keep watching them,
but no one is to approach those vans.

749
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:31,193
lf they are bombers, the slightest thing
spooks them and they'll detonate.

750
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,673
Sir.

751
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,353
- What else have they got planned?
- Ma'am.

752
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,834
How many devices are there?

753
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,509
- How many devices are there?
- Sarge, tenancy agreement.

754
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,394
46 Churchill Avenue, Willesden Green,
three months paid in advance.

755
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,351
What's there, Rashid?

756
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,871
Take Phillips and whoever's still here
from SO19.

757
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,709
Come with me.

758
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,832
..live to Scotland Yard,
where we're expecting a statement

759
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,475
from the Deputy Assistant Commissioner
John lves...

760
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,954
Phillips, come with me, and you.

761
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:15,589
A large bomb hidden in a van was detonated
at 8am outside Liverpool Street station.

762
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:22,153
The bomb might have dispersed
small amounts of radioactive contamination,

763
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,829
which is why
every necessary precaution is being taken.

764
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:30,719
ln the meantime, we need the public
to stay calm and stay put.

765
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,798
lf you're already in your home,
stay in your home.

766
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,956
lf you're in your office, remain there.

767
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,793
All Londoners not in the vicinity
of the incident

768
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:44,230
should go in, stay in, and tune in.

769
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,589
There is no significant risk,

770
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,918
but it is vital that you are decontaminated
before you go home.

771
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,714
Mass decontamination units
are being set up.

772
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:58,912
No, they said we should stay inside.
lt was on the radio.

773
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,509
Everybody, stay behind the line!

774
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,669
Sir, mass decon units
have been dispatched to the cordons

775
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,679
at London Wall, Commercial Road,
London Bridge, Old Street.

776
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,154
Priority routes are filtering everyone
in the zone to these points.

777
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,510
Tom, how long are we going
to have to hold people there?

778
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,314
We've got ten mass decon units in London,
more en route.

779
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:38,433
Assuming fire and water
can get them running in half an hour,

780
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,948
they're supposed to do 200 people an hour.

781
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,070
How many people are we talking about?

782
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,999
100,000, 200,000. l don't know
how many people are still in there.

783
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,749
- Ten, twelve hours minimum.
- We'd better organise food and drink.

784
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,509
You can't. They mustn't put their hands
neartheir mouths.

785
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,437
No smoking, eating, drinking.

786
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,711
- They could ingest radiation.
- Has anyone told them?

787
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,398
- Haven't you?
- Sir.

788
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:06,833
We've got a major problem. Fires are
burning out of control at ground zero.

789
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,271
We've no idea how bad the situation is,
so officers must wear GTsuits.

790
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:15,711
Suits don't protect against gamma.
That's what the dosimeters are for.

791
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,912
We expect concentrated pockets
of gamma radiation close to the blast site.

792
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:24,397
- Officers must check meters every minute.
- What's the maximum dose?

793
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,477
Female officers can't risk exposure at all.

794
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,310
We can ask male officers
to take up to 100 millisieverts.

795
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,148
- Anything above that is at their own risk.
- How do we get men in on that timescale?

796
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,749
We could use engines that are already
contaminated to drive relays.

797
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,554
lt's gonna be hard getting close.
There's rubble everywhere.

798
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,558
They'll be lucky to last 20 minutes
in those suits.

799
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,350
They'll need to know the ground.

800
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,789
Your men have had half the maximum dose.

801
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,594
- So their reliefs better get in fast.
- How many men do we have now?

802
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,155
A couple of hundred we can ask to suit up.
Traffic is gridlocked.

803
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,715
The majority of the force
is struggling to get here.

804
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,469
lf you want it, you're first in.

805
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,270
You'd bettertalk to your crew.

806
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,238
Everybody get down!

807
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,750
Armed police! Armed police!

808
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,392
Armed police!

809
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,751
Man down!

810
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:36,670
Everyone should stay calm.
There is no significant risk to your health.

811
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:41,236
But it is vital that you are decontaminated
before you go home.

812
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,115
Pregnant women, children, any casualties,
should be brought to the front.

813
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:50,995
lt is in your best interests
to refrain from eating, drinking, smoking,

814
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,989
or placing your hands in your mouth
prior to decontamination.

815
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:10,193
- Minister, l'm your liaison officer.
- Bring me up to speed.

816
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:14,358
We estimate a crowd
of several thousand people behind the cordon,

817
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,789
in need of immediate decontamination.

818
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,718
We are setting up a decontamination unit.

819
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,673
lt'll be a couple of minutes
before we're ready to get the unit open,

820
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:26,188
and on its way to bring people through ASAP.

821
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:32,113
Confirmed. The house secured.
We have one casualty, one suspect dead.

822
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:36,199
Roger, understood. Ambulance en route,
medical team en route.

823
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,599
This man is hot. The whole house is hot!

824
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,269
We've got to get out. Clearthe house!

825
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,394
We've got to get out now. Clearthe house!

826
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,149
Clearthe house!

827
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,870
Murray, when your dosimeter gets to 100,
you come out. Do you understand?

828
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,998
Suiting up, preparing to go in, 12.

829
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,353
Corrigan.

830
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,159
Portley.

831
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,953
Ashwood.

832
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,152
McGee.

833
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,713
First unit en route to ground zero.

834
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,197
We need a decontamination team here
before anyone can check forensics.

835
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,434
Give me the radio.

836
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,198
Sir, this is DC Habibullah.

837
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,869
l'm looking at a rental agreement
for a white Transit van.

838
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:11,869
Registration:
Oscar Uniform 5-3 Sierra Foxtrot Foxtrot.

839
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,196
Yeah? No, that's not the van that detonated.

840
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:19,119
Sir, they've recovered documents
for a rented van.

841
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,869
White Ford Transit,
registration Oscar Uniform...

842
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:23,989
Oscar Uniform...

843
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:28,158
5-3 Sierra Foxtrot Foxtrot.

844
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,758
Not the Canary Wharf van.

845
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:35,352
Does anyone have a visual on suspect
vehicles at Westminster and Telecom Tower?

846
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,869
- Van one on the move.
- That's our van.

847
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,071
- Go, gol
- No clean shot, target obscured.

848
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,509
Take it.

849
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,394
Do not approach vehicle.

850
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:23,238
Our target's down.

851
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,075
Confirm target down, no movement.
Repeat, no movement.

852
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,431
Please wait patiently.

853
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:36,313
Mass decontamination has begun.

854
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,477
Everybody will go through
as soon as possible.

855
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,559
That's it. Wait yourturn.
Don't cross the line.

856
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,151
Please wait patiently.
Mass decontamination has begun.

857
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,034
Everybody will go through
as soon as is possible.

858
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,753
Your patience is appreciated.

859
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,109
Put a mask on, go outside.

860
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,718
Right, you're done. Step out. Next.

861
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,719
Step forward, please.

862
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,111
Close your eyes.

863
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,470
Turn around. Turn around.

864
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,193
Foxtrot 57 1, this is entry controller.
What's your status? Over.

865
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:14,148
We have severe casualties, civilians trapped.

866
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,956
We need heavy lifting gear.

867
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,228
Understood.

868
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:21,670
More units are en route.
What's your dosimeter reading?

869
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,711
Hang on.

870
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,079
250.

871
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,509
Repeat, 250.

872
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:35,439
You're over your limit.
You need to get yourcrew out now.

873
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:38,278
Negative, we can't pull out now.

874
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,549
We need more men.

875
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,717
Surely we need a decon unit here?

876
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,876
All units are committed, Minister.

877
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,514
- Can't we get more?
- We have more en route.

878
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,835
We're not sure when they'll get here.

879
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:08,110
Everyone in vehicles, please.
That's it. Everyone in the vehicles.

880
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,672
- Where do you want me?
- Where's the Prime Minister?

881
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,234
l'll take every question that you have.

882
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,511
We're getting some really high
radiation readings.

883
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,198
- How high?
- Very high.

884
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:24,994
Radiation has spread
east by north-east with the prevailing winds.

885
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,838
Alert Mile End hospitals
and all units in the area.

886
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:32,476
Be advised, radiation is spreading.
Do not let people leave hospital buildings.

887
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:37,514
Sarge, London Wall cordon reports
radiation readings of 50 millisieverts.

888
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:41,348
- They want to relocate mass decon.
- No, negative, hold position.

889
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,960
- On my coms, please.
- Transfer.

890
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,150
Extra manpower is on its way to assist.

891
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,112
Do not dismantle your decon
until you have backup.

892
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,878
You must hold that cordon line.

893
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:56,074
lf the perpetrators of this evil
think they can demoralise and intimidate us,

894
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,838
they are wrong.

895
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:01,429
Londoners have coped
with terrorist attacks many times before.

896
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:06,554
We are doing everything we can
to protect and inform people.

897
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:11,276
Sorry. l need to ask you to move.
Decon is being relocated. We need to move.

898
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:32,436
There will be a short delay while the mass
decontamination facility is resited.

899
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:37,554
Please stay calm. We will resume
decontamination as soon as possible.

900
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,989
Yourcooperation is essential.

901
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:47,833
There will be a short delay while
the mass decontamination unit is resited.

902
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,552
Please stay calm.

903
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:55,073
Minister, the radiation levels are rising,
you must leave.

904
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,917
Please, Minister.

905
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,675
Please remain calm.

906
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:14,589
Please stay calm.
lt's in your own interests to cooperate.

907
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,792
Decontamination will resume
as soon as possible.

908
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,751
Please remain calm.

909
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:41,077
Attention, all fire ground personnel.

910
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,874
High levels of radiation are suspected.

911
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:49,277
lmmediate withdrawal.
l repeat, immediate withdrawal.

912
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,311
Get us out of this!

913
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,391
Murray, this is Harper.

914
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:07,633
- Steve, check your air supply.
- OK.

915
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,111
Check your gauge.

916
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:19,193
- Foxtrot 57 1 to entry controller.
- All right, love. We'll get you out.

917
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,117
We're running out of air.

918
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,471
We've got to contain this.

919
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,151
We need more men.

920
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,151
Where are my reliefs?

921
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,036
Murray, this is Harper.

922
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,798
There's a delay.

923
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:43,197
Most of the area is having to relocate.
We're pulling back.

924
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,834
Will advise on new location.

925
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,314
You have to get out of there now.

926
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,471
Murray, are you receiving?

927
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,111
Murray, do you copy?

928
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,511
Situation understood.

929
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,555
Get out, Steve! Get out!

930
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,591
l've got it!

931
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,871
Are you ready forthis?

932
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,356
Ahmed lbraham Abassi,

933
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:50,949
also known as Nabil Kassem,
also known as Abu Hazan.

934
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,518
Born Hanif Abbash,

935
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:56,870
Amman, Jordan, June 17th, 197 1.

936
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:17,471
Pakistani lSl are holding your wife.

937
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,274
Your son Abdullah, as far as we know,
is in an orphanage.

938
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,680
Your son has no family to claim him.

939
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,914
Do you care what happens to him?

940
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,550
He's four years old.

941
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,751
You decided his fate.

942
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,916
You killed those people, not Allah.

943
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:59,356
Slaughtering innocent men, women and
children is not defending the brotherhood.

944
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,197
lt is a crime against lslam.

945
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,998
What happens now? The West retaliates.

946
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,190
Thousands more Muslims will die.

947
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,430
We expect your retaliation.

948
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,233
lt is what unites us and divides you.

949
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,428
Can you tell me where the lCU unit is?

950
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:44,358
Down there.
Follow the corridor, on your left.

951
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:19,035
Your husband has made good progress.

952
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,436
You need to understand
there will be long-term effects.

953
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,234
Murray should be able to come home
in the next couple of weeks.

954
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,714
We'll make regular appointments

955
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,558
but you should be alert
for any signs of melanoma,

956
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,309
tumours, skin lesions,
any unusual changes to the skin.

957
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,916
l'm afraid there may be problems
if you want to have children.

958
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,793
We have consultants here that you can talk to.

959
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,149
They'll explain the risks involved.

960
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,391
Do you understand?

961
01:26:54,320 --> 01:27:00,236
The death toll as a direct result
of the bombing is confirmed at 375.

962
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:04,831
Medical experts warn that there could be
thousands of long-term cancer deaths

963
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,519
as a result of exposure to radiation.

964
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:10,028
The Atomic Energy Agency has announced

965
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,038
that three and a half square miles
of central and eastern London

966
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:16,072
may have to remain sealed off for 30 years.

967
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:20,830
Thousands of businesses
in the zone have been forced to close.

968
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,998
Millions of pensions, savings
and trust funds may never recover.

969
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,474
As London house prices plummet,

970
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,069
analysts warn the cost of the bombing
is impossible to calculate.

971
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,192
ln the hunt for the ringleaders
of the bomb attack,

972
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:37,550
British police have received
unprecedented cooperation

973
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,558
from all international intelligence services.

974
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,716
Later in the programme...

975
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,593
The Prime Minister
vowed the government will not rest

976
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:50,668
until all the terrorists who threaten
the civilised world are brought tojustice.
