- That means he doesn't know.

177
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:17,694
Well, we be in warm waters.

178
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,696
We be in Bora Bora, Pops.

179
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,031
I know where we are. Where do we dock?

180
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,908
That's what I'm asking.
Where do we dock?

181
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,952
We can't say for sure, lad,

182
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,999
but I've heard stories
of sailors selling penguins to zoos.

183
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,876
- Zoos?
- Zoos? I'm not going to no zoo.

184
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,338
No, no. I'm going to the helmsman.
I'll go to the first mate.

185
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:40,883
I'll go all the way to the captain
of this oversized dinghy.

186
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,221
I'll make him turn this tug around
if I have to.

187
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:48,349
But I can't go to a zoo.

188
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:52,645
I've got to get back to Antarctica.

189
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,481
Who's with me?
Who's for busting out of here?

190
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,067
Come on, you jellyfish.

191
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,236
How about you, seal bait? You?

192
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:05,408
Sorry, Mr. Rockhopper, but free food
at the zoo sounds awful good to me.

193
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:08,036
ROCKO: Bunch of birdbrains and
seal bait. Get me out of here!

194
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,246
Get me somebody!

195
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,835
WOMAN 1: Marina, Hubie is gone.

196
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,254
Face it. Forget him.

197
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,423
WOMAN 2: Why don't you
just marry Drake?

198
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,258
MARINA: No, Priscilla.

199
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,719
I believe Hubie
is still out there somewhere,

200
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:29,849
and he'll come home to me in time
for the full moon mating ceremony.

201
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,935
- You're saying you want to marry him?
- I do.

202
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:39,859
How could you possibly choose a wimp
like Hubie over a hunk like Drake?

203
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:44,447
Hubie's a sweetheart.
He's generous and kind,

204
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,950
and he's always thoughtful
of others, and...

205
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,708
Good morning, ladies.

206
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,919
(ALL SIGHING)

207
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,797
DRAKE: Marina, my pet.

208
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,842
I want you to be my mate.

209
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:09,722
Drake. Drake. I love Hubie.

210
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:15,645
Hubie?
I deeply sympathize, Marina,

211
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:21,734
but since he is nowhere to be found,
I offer my own hand.

212
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:25,071
- My answer is still no.
- Think about it.

213
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,073
Give me your answer later.

214
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,826
But remember. You must choose a mate

215
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,829
before the full moon mating ceremony

216
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:36,499
or be banished.

217
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,336
Gosh. That's the law.

218
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:54,434
I got just 10 days to get back home
before the full moon ceremony.

219
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,520
Sir! Sir! Take me with you.

220
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,188
- ROCKO: You talking to me?
- Yes, sir, I am.

221
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:03,025
- Don't call me "sir." Call me Rocko.
- Rocko. Right. Yes.

222
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,946
- Well, Rocko, it's about my girl.
- Wait, wait, wait.

223
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,698
You want me to spring you
out of this joint

224
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,867
so you can go home
to Miss Wonderful, right?

225
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,620
Yes. Yes. You're right. You see,
there's another guy who's after my girl.

226
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,122
- Forget it.
- But a moment ago,

227
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,332
you asked
"Who's for busting out of here?"

228
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,876
- Well, I am.
- You're too dumb.

229
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,544
- Take me, please.
- Why should I?

230
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:26,132
Well, because if the humans see me
tripping all over myself,

231
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,510
that'll divert their attention to me,
giving you more time to escape.

232
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,679
Like I really need a diversion.

233
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:35,016

I'll bring the house down.

- Hubie.

Well, Hubie. All right. You're on.

240
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,080
Yeah, go for it, Hubie.

you're gonna break out of that cage.

You need a dream.

00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,973
No! No! I don't accept nothing!

341
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,976
But, Rocko, that's the way things are.

342
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:39,189
I want to fly. I'm gonna fly,
and no one's gonna stop me. I'm flying.

343
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,858

Nobody laughs at Rocko the Rockhopper.

347
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,501
That's funny.

348
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,546
You see, I expected you to tell me
something big, really stupendous.

349
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:06,675
You know, like hopping up the slopes
of Mt. Everest or something, you know.

350
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:11,180
But flying? Oh, for heaven's sakes.
That's so easy.

351
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:12,514
Says who?

352
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,934
- Waldo, that's who.
- Waldo?

353
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,144
- Yeah. He's...
- Who's Waldo?

354
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:21,023
Waldo is a short little penguin
back in my rookery.

355
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,360
- Yeah? Really?
- Yes, really. And listen,

356
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,945
he claims to have gotten
the hang of flying.

357
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,696
And his wings
are a lot stubbier than yours.

358
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,531
Hey, hey, hey. These aren't stubs.

359
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:34,453
Oh, but... There I go being
a big blabbermouth again.

360
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,121
Wait. Wait. Come back here.

361
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,249
Thank you for helping me escape, Rocko.
I've got to go, though.

362
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,876
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

363
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:44,630
I must be back before the next
full moon. Marina needs me. Goodbye.

364
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,299
Wait, wait. You're lost.
That way's north.

365
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,719
Oh. I just...
I just remembered something.

366
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:56,100
I think Waldo said
the secret to flying was wind speed.

367
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,227
- Well, anyway.
- Wind speed.

368
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,229
- Off I go.
- You know, that's right.

369
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,356
That's exactly what I think.
That's what I've been working on.

370
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:03,899
That's my theory. Wind speed, see?

371
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,901
You know, that's amazing,
that there's...

372
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,820
Someone else knows about that.

373
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:09,655
Well, come here.
What else did Waldo say?

374
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,491
Can we swim as we talk?
Marina's waiting.

375
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:16,078
Yeah, sure. Why not?
I got a couple of days, anyway.

376
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,288
- Which way is south?
- That way.

377
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,084
- I want to meet this Waldo character.
- Waldo?

378
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,044
You get me and Waldo together,

379
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:27,297
and I'll get you to the Antarctic
by the next full moon.

380
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,758
Oh, I like the sound of that.

381
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,265
DRAKE: Well,
there's only eight days left

382

before the full moon mating ceremony,

383
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:44,440
and Marina still won't agree
to be my mate.

384
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,528
Although, my faithful servants,

385
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:54,825
we have seen
that Hubie is a leopard seal meal.

386
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:01,040
It's a pleasant thought

387
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:07,129
that that stupid little
penguin nerd will never return.

if you don't make it on time?

Oh, that's too horrible
to even think about.

394
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,459
Well, think about it.
Who would Marina marry?

395
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,169
- Drake!
- Drake?

396
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,338
- Why, is he any good with the ladies?
- Yeah.

397
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:53,675
Well, Captain, full speed ahead.
Here we go.

398
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:21,120
We only have five days left, Rocko.
We're running out of time.

399
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,873
Look. We can't swim in this storm,
unless you want to die.

400
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,750
Maybe Drake will leave Marina alone.

401
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,169
Yeah, well, maybe Drake
has already married Marina.

402
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,714
No. No. I know my girl. She'll wait.

403
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:38,053
And if she accepts this pebble,
we'll be married.

404
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,681
If she accepts the pebble?

405
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:45,227
You mean, you're not sure
if she's gonna accept the pebble?

407

You mean, you're going
through all this trouble

408

- and you're not even sure?
- She'll accept it.

409
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,443
Oh, come on.

410
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,072
It's beautiful. It's...

411
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:02,077
- It's perfect.
- Yes, it is perfect, isn't it, Rocko?

412
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,788
- There, that ledge.
- Rocko?

413
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:09,501

ancient "aviarial" airstrip.

are you?
