1
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,542
(Music begins)

2
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,262
(Dialogue inaudible)

3
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,787
(Maurice sighs)

4
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,788
l'm sorry.

5
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,258
You stole my death.

6
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,563
l couldn't believe it.
 l thought...

7
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,564
why is he dying?

8
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,101
l die.

9
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,871
Today is my day to die.

10
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,872
l was really, really confused.

11
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,376
-Aah!
-Aah!

12
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,377
 Did you think
that you were supposed to die?

13
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,382
l was confused.

14
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:00,383
 Uh, l was unsure,
and l made a choice.

15
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,288
MAURlCE: Aah!

16
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,757
Aah! l'm hit!

17
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,926
But didn't you see
that l was dying?

18
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,327
-Aah!
-Aah!

19
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,495
-Aah!
-Aah!

20
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,496
l did. l did, but...

21
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,370
-l did, but--
-But what?

22
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,443
Arthur...

23
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,045
it was just because...

24
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,046
 your pau--
The pause was just so long.

25
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,583
-Aah!
-Aah!

26
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,191
And good. And good.

27
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,192
lt was such a good, long pause
 that l was just unsure.

28
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,929
l became unsure.

29
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,567
Well, it felt good.

30
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,335
-Oh, no, it was good.
 -Really?

31
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,070
 MAURlCE:
Oh, you were good. Very.

32
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,973
ARTHUR: Well, then, Maurice,
 l don't understand.

33
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,442
What...

34
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,778
l...

35
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,247
Because it was so good...

36
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,248
l became unsure.

37
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,219
l'm really so, so sorry.

38
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,858
 -No, it's all right.
-No. l just feel terrible.

39
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,559
lt's OK. Don't. lt's OK.

40
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,561
lt's OK.

41
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,064
l'm sorry. l didn't--

42
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,065
lt's OK.

43
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,473
lt's all right.

44
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,375
lt's OK.

45
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,376
(Music swells)

46
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,816
MAURlCE: Happy.

47
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,319
Frightened.

48
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,723
Ecstatic.

49
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,694
Good. Switch.

50
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,671
ARTHUR: Fortunate.

51
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,276
No hands.

52
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,977
Make it simple. Keep it clean.

53
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,445
Give it to me again.

54
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,548
ARTHUR: Fortunate.

55
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,316
 -Hands.
-No hands.

56
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,918
ARTHUR: Fortunate.

57
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,487
Ah, there you go. There you go.
 There you go.

58
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,222
Uh...

59
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,223
disturbed.

60
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,128
-Not mentally disturbed.
 -Oh.

61
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,296
ARTHUR: Disturbed.

62
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,297
Not emotionally disturbed, but
 sort of spiritually disturbed.

63
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,204
But on a smaller level.

64
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,873
Ah, there you go. There you go.

65
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,874
Subtle as a sphinx. Switch.

66
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,848
Excited.

67
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,960
That's it for me.

68
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,128
What's the matter?

69
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,129
No, Maurice, l...

70
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,733
l can't.

71
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,404
 l'm going to die
if we don't get work.

72
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,444
MAURlCE: l'm so hungry.

73
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,618
ARTHUR: What are we going to do?

74
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,320
(Maurice sighs)

75
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,321
MAURlCE: l don't know.

76
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,958
Arthur...

77
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,427
we might just have to look
 for other work.

78
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,197
We might just have to look
 for other jobs.

79
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,198
ARTHUR: Other jobs?

80
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,403
Beggars can't be choosers,
 Arthur.

81
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,604
 ARTHUR:
Are you calling us beggars?

82
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,605
 MAURlCE:
We will be if we don't get jobs.

83
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:47,276
ARTHUR: Beggars.

84
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,717
 (English accent)
Please, sir, l want some more.

85
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,555
You see, sir, l've not eaten
 for fourteen days...

86
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,728
since me mum died of the group.

87
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,296
-Croup.
-Croup.

88
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,998
Of the croup she died...

89
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,300
 leaving me and
my mentally ill brother here...

90
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,136
to fend for ourselves.

91
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,538
Murdered, she was, in her bed
 by one of her johns.

92
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,307
 You see,
she sold herself to feed us.

93
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,076
She compromised herself
 for our sakes...

94
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,745
and here we are, left alone
and hungry and homeless.

95
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,747
 And my poor brother
needs a brain operation...

96
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,516
and my glaucoma's
 getting worse...

97
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,517
and, sir? Sir? Sir?

98
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,722
Are you there, sir?

99
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,323
Aah!

100
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,324
l can't see you, sir.
l can't see you, sir!

101
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,395
Aah! Aah!

102
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,698
l'm blind!

103
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,900
Aah!

104
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,901
(Music swells)

105
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,340
So, how we doing?

106
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,109
-Great.
-Good.

107
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,744
Now, this is just a formality.

108
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,745
 l want you both. lt's just
a matter of who plays what part.

109
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,383
You mean you want us
 in the play?

110
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,118
 DlRECTOR:
Yes, and if l say too much...

111
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,119
forgive me, but having written
 and lived it for 18 years...

112
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,690
 and now directing it, along
with my wife who's producing...

113
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,991
l think l know it pretty well.

114
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,794
 But there's always
something new you can learn.

115
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,830
 So l just want to say
about these characters...

116
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,831
that they once loved each other,
 but now they hate each other...

117
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,602
but underneath, love,
 but on top, hate.

118
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,171
 Love, hate.
So, see what l'm saying?

119
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,440
ARTHUR AND MAURlCE:
 Yeah, sure. Love, hate.

120
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,709
 DlRECTOR:
Yes. Love, hate, love, hate.

121
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,644
Love, hate, love, hate.

122
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,980
 -Love.
-Hate, love, hate.

123
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,015
Love, hate, love, hate.

124
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,684
ARTHUR: Love, hate, love, hate.

125
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,685
 Love--Th-th-th--
Whenever you're ready, go.

126
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,256
MAURlCE: OK.

127
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,294
(Both giggling)

128
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,896
 BOTH:
Do you want to be the guy--

129
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,064
Do you want to be the guy
 who dies first?

130
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,399
-lt doesn't matter to me.
 -Why don't you go?

131
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,335
-Are you sure?
 -Yeah.

132
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,336
ARTHUR: Excuse me. Do you have
 a preference who dies first?

133
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,606
Couldn't care less.

134
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,810
ARTHUR: OK. l don't care.

135
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,979
 (Whispering) Actually,
do you mind if l die second?

136
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,747
'Cause l'm a little
 not ready, OK?

137
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,748
 -Good, good.
-OK. Go ahead.

138
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,485
(Arthur clears throat)

139
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,064
 ARTHUR: (French accent)
What a fool you are, Alan.

140
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,065
MAURlCE: (English accent)
 No, Latour. You are a fool.

141
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,103
ARTHUR: Me? Moi? Ha!

142
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,104
 lt is not l who is soon
to breathe his final breath.

143
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,707
 MAURlCE: True,
but l am not afraid, Latour...

144
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,978
for with that breath
 l will inhale hope.

145
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,115
Hope because l know there are
 others like me, Latour...

146
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,718
who will soon come, and from
whom a pure light will shine...

147
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,790
and blind the devils
 of this world.

148
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,893
-Aah!
-Aah!

149
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,331
BOTH: Ahh.

150
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,999
MAURlCE: Uhh!

151
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
(Maurice choking)

152
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,003
MAURlCE: Oh, father.

153
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,779
Um, now switch parts.

154
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,522
ARTHUR: That was good.

155
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,523
 -Perfect.
-No, it was very good.

156
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,594
(Telephone rings)

157
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,699
Yello. Oh, hi, hon.

158
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,033
 Keep going.
lt's my wife, the producer.

159
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,034
Hi, hi. What's up?

160
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,838
lt's going well,
it's going well.

161
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,341
 MAURlCE:
What a fool you are, Alan.

162
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,342
DlRECTOR: l said l was sorry,
 and l meant it.

163
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,181
MAURlCE: Me? Moi? Ha!

164
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,182
 DlRECTOR: l'm not going
to behave like that anymore.

165
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,986
Where are you?

166
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,987
What are you doing with him?

167
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,991
You what?

168
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,992
 You're saying to me
that you're leaving me for him?

169
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,098
 This is what
you're saying to me?

170
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,734
 Well, yes,
naturally, l'm shocked.

171
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,569
Of course l'm shocked.

172
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,438
Does this mean you're pulling
your money out of the show?

173
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,439
No, no, l will not find anybody
else to put money in this play.

174
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,677
 Everyone thinks
it's a piece of shit.

175
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,382
 Where are you now?
Because l'm coming down.

176
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,383
l'm going to bite out
 both your throats!

177
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,123
(Music swells)

178
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,363
-So l insult him?
 -Yeah.

179
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,165
ARTHUR: Tell him you think
 his pastries are no good.

180
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,934
-Oh, good idea.
 -Yeah.

181
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,402
Say that they're stale,
 all right?

182
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,903
 Hey, buddy,
your pastries are stale.

183
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,506
Right, but don't say buddy.
 Just say...

184
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,507
-Your pastries are stale.
-Your pastries are stale.

185
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,244

-You'll come to his defense.
 -l'll come to his defense.

187
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,087
And then...

188
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,189
 He'll reward you
with a cornucopia of delicacies.

189
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,391
 -Right.
-Which you will share with me.

190
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,392
ARTHUR: All right, good.
 But be--you know. OK?

191
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,064
-Small.
-Small.

192
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,065
You, too.

193
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,507
-Good day, sir.
 -Good day.

194
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,283
Everything is made fresh?

195
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,252
Yes, sir. l make everything
 myself, fresh every day.

196
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,455
-Oh, every day?
 -Every day.

197
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,124
 -Good day.
-Good day, sir.

198
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,193
 -Good day.
-How do you do?

199
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,829
-Every single day?
 -Every single day.

200
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,531
MAURlCE: Well...

201
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,101
even these cream puffs
 are fresh?

202
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,102
They look stale to me.

203
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,674
 BAKER:
You may taste if you like.

204
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,675
Taste?

205
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,250
lf l must.

206
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:14,296
(Clears throat)

207
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,438
l hate them.

208
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,507
Oh, l'm sorry.

209
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,008
To each his own.

210
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,943
There's another bakery shop
 down the block...

211
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,779
 whose wares
might be more to your liking.

212
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,780
Thank you for coming in.
 May l help you, sir?

213
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,721
 Yes.
Would you excuse me a moment?

214
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,223
l couldn't help but overhear.
 Excuse me, sir...

215
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,492
 but may l say
that your rudeness...

216
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,795
to this hard-working gentleman
 is uncalled for?

217
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,696
 -Please, sir.
-l beg your pardon.

218
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,398
ARTHUR: No, l beg yours, sir.

219
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,134
 This gentleman is one
of the finest pastry chefs...

220
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,436
on the eastern seaboard.

221
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,304
-Well, thank you.
-You're welcome.

222
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,439
 -Do l know you?
-Of course you do.

223
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,873
MAURlCE: What's your point?

224
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,575
ARTHUR: You would not know
 a good cream puff...

225
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,445
if it jumped up and licked you
 on the ass.

226
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,547
 BAKER:
lt's just a difference in taste.

227
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,549
 ARTHUR: No.
This man is clearly an imbecile.

228
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,517
MAURlCE: Ah, an insult!

229
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,985
-l'm insulted?
 -Yes!

230
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,421
-l'm insulted!
 -Fine. Good!

231
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,023
MAURlCE: Well, l am !

232
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,958
ARTHUR: l'm sure you're not
 as insulted as him.

233
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,694
 -l'm not insulted.
-Oh, yes, you are!

234
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,097
ARTHUR: The man works all day
 to support his miserable family.

235
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,666
 BAKER: My family isn't
miserable. We're quite happy.

236
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,234
ARTHUR: No, you're not!

237
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,636
You're miserable and pathetic.
 Look at you.

238
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,171
BAKER: Well, l...

239
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,707
All day working like a lackey
 from rise to set...

240
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,043
sweating in the eye of Phoebus.

241
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,511
l love my work.

242
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,512
 No, you don't!
My God, how could you?

243
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,950
-Are you insulting him?
 -No, you are!

244
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,118
That's what l thought!

245
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,086
Oh, how it grieves me...

246
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:45,087
 to see a man
living the life of a dog...

247
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,090
and treated worse than a dog
 by a bourgeois pig!

248
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,794
BAKER: You don't even know
 this gentleman.

249
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,795
 ARTHUR:
Oh, l know him ! l knew them all!

250
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,065
 Puppeteers. And you, the poor,
sweaty, blue-collared bumpkin...

251
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,769
at the end of their strings.

252
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,905
What a fool you are!

253
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,341
-l am not a fool!
 -Yes, you are!

254
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,342
MAURlCE: You shouldn't talk
 to that gentleman this way.

255
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,614
You like the cream puffs.

256
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,216
l don't like the cream puffs.

257
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,618
ARTHUR: Fuck the cream puffs!

258
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,020
 This man
is a slave and an idiot!

259
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,089
-Get out of here!
 -What?

260
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,758
BAKER: Get out of my shop!

261
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,994
MAURlCE: l'll handle this.

262
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,263
You've really said quite enough.

263
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,232
 l think we've heard
quite enough from you.

264
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,001
Begone!

265
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,002
(Door slams)

266
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,505
Sir, how can l repay you?

267
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,340
MAURlCE: Please. l did nothing.

268
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,341
 BAKER:
l insist. You came to my aid.

269
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,686
Well...

270
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,354
perhaps a cream puff?

271
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,257
No, no. You don't like them.

272
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,893
 -Well...
-l have something even better.

273
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,929
 Two tickets

274
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,531
 to see the great
Jeremy Burtom as Hamlet.

275
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,532
 Please,

276
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,606
 ARTHUR:
Tickets to see Jeremy Burtom?

277
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,374
-That's what he gave you?
 -That's correct.

278
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,077
 ARTHUR: Out of anything in
the shop, he gives you tickets?

279
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,245
MAURlCE: Yes.

280
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,080
 ARTHUR: Why didn't he
just stab you in the heart?

281
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,882
MAURlCE: You tell me, Arthy.

282
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,251
ARTHUR: Burtom is the worst
actor on the face of the earth.

283
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,786
MAURlCE: Yup.

284
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,455
That man is unwatchable.

285
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,923
MAURlCE: Yup.

286
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,392
ARTHUR: You couldn't pay me
 to go see that guy's Hamlet.

287
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,393
(Music swells)

288
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,202
l wanted to see how bad
 he really was.

289
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,571
l hear he makes a real fool
 out of himself.

290
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,206
 You always learn
from other people's mistakes.

291
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,608
Oh, yes.

292
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,643

-Please.

293
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,712

295

Hey.

 -Really?
-Mm-hmm.

298
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,258
ARTHUR: Oh.

299
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,326
Good for him. Good for Mike.

301

302
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,365
(Elizabethan music)

303
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,949
(Applause)

304
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,894
MAURlCE: Someone's
 put on a little weight.

305
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,863
 ARTHUR: l hope
they reinforced the stage.

306
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,565
MAURlCE: My God.

307
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,566
 CLAUDlUS: And now
my cousin Hamlet and my son.

308
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,704
GERTRUDE: Hamlet, why seems
 it so particular with thee?

309
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,974
 HAMLET: Seems, madam?
Nay, it is. l know not ,,seems.,,

310
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,579
'Tis not alone my inky cloak,
 good mother...

311
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,752
nor the customary suits
 of solemn black...

312
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,753
nor the dejected 'havior
 of the visage...

313
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,925
together with all forms...

314
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,394
moods, shapes of grief...

315
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:13,395
that can denote me truly.

316
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,734
These indeed seem...

317
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,936
 for they are actions
that a man might play.

318
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,605
But l...

319
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,908
have that within...

320
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,909
which passes show.

321
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,180
These...

322
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,181
but the trappings
 and the suits...

323
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,086
of woe.

324
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,777
BURTOM: Who is it?

325
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,988
 MAN WHlSPERlNG:

STAGE MANAGER:
 Places for act two.

327
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,865
Places for act two.

328
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,866
(Swords clanging)

329
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,075
LAERTES: Ow!

330
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,877
HAMLET: Come for the third,
 Laertes. You do but dally.

331
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,579
 -Who choreographed this?
-l don't know. lt's so sloppy.

332
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,781
MAURlCE: lt's a mess.

333
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,082
HAMLET: Crazy boy!

334
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,751
Aah! You crazy boy!

335
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,920
Aah!

336
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,321
MAURlCE: What was that part?

337
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,322
ARTHUR: l don't know.

338
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,060
HAMLET: Come on.

339
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,036
LAERTES: Aah!

340
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:02,037
What the hell's he doing?

341
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,913
MlKE: Drunken son of a bitch.

342
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,693
Ladies and gentlemen...

343
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,865
 it appears an actor,
having missed a parry...

344
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,502
 upset by his mistake,
has vacated the stage.

345
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:38,407
 Therefore,
with your kind permission...

346
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,177
we will lower the curtain--

347
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,846
(Belches)

348
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,847
and regroup, as it were...

349
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,985
and then complete this...

350
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,986
 the greatest of all
of Mr. Shakespeare's plays.

351
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,360
l thank you.

352
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,361

MlKE: The man is vicious.

354
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,835

 right there.

355

ARTHUR: Where?

356
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,110
MlKE: Right in the rib.

357
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,645
Gertrude?

358
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,880
Almost killed her with a goblet.

359
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,114
MAURlCE: He's done it before?

360
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:20,115

 That's just sick.

ARTHUR: You know what really
 burns me up?

364
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,559
What really gets my goat...

365
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,560
 is that Mike had
such a great death coming up...

366
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,465
and he was cheated.

367
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,700
He was cheated, right?

368
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,868
That's the...

369
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,204
MAURlCE: Yeah, but, you know--
 You want to know?

370
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,740
You want to know what l'd do
 in that situation?

371
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,741
 -What?
-l'd stop, center stage.

372
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,580

ladies and gentlemen...

377
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,658

 of an overrated...

378
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,061
undertalented, drunken hack...

379
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,165
named Jeremy Burtom.

380
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,068
He has blustered his way
 to success...

381
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,069
 on the backs of the great
supporting players for too long!

382
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,740
 And it's time for us
to make a stand and say no!

383
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:22,044
No, Burtom ! Begone!

384
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:25,113
lt is time for us to say,
 no, boozy boy!

385

Bye-bye, Burtom bad boy!

386

 Hefty boy!
Boozy, boozy boy!

Greasy boy! Saggy, farty boy!

388

 Poke you!
l poke you! l poke you!

389
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,732
Something like that.

390
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,471

full of hope and wonder--

453
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,284

 -Actually, no.
-Please, Meistrich.

463
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,679

MAN: Ohh! Aah!

475
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,987
MElSTRlCH: Why don't you watch
 what you're doing, hmm?

476
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,555
Make a mistake like that
 next time...

477
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,556
 and l'll chop off your hands and
let you drown in your own blood!

478
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,331
 Are you two finished
with your little tete-a-tete?

479
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,932
Because there is work to do.

480

Let's get out of here quick.

500
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,882
BURTOM: ...having been abused
 yesternight...

501
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,851
by a band of ruffians...

502
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,420
l thwarted an attempt
 on my life...

503
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,421
by these incompetent scofflaws
 single-handedly.

504
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,659
MAN: Bravo. Wonderful. Good job.

505
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,362
 BURTOM:
As for myself, l hope that...

506
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,363
 the salt air
will heal my wounds...

507
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,169
 and the motion
of the cool, green sea...

508
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,972
soothe my tortured soul.

509
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,973

l do, sir. l do.

519
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,598
SPARKS: Powerful enough to snap
 the neck of a small beast...

520
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,467
and yet sensitive enough...

521
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,336
to caress the tender throat
 of a young castrato--

522
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,105
coax a song from him.

523
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,840

And l was sorry to hear about
 the death of your husband.

531
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,992
He was the most generous of men.

532
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:58,929
That he was. That he was.

533
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,331

00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,609
MElSTRlCH: There is desperation
 in these little footsteps.

566
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,447
Lily, your cheeks are flushed.
 Your breasts heave.

567
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,015
May l ask where is the fire?

568
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,518
No, there's no fire, Meistrich.
 A passenger needs help.

Are you sure?

585
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:56,471
Weren't you employed once

OK.

-We hid in a crate last night.
 -Escaping from the police.

608
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,829
 For something that we did to
that man that was an accident.

609
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,864
-He's famous.
 -He's a hack!

610
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,032
He's overrated.

611
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,467
 Oh, you're the ones
he was talking about!

613

 We drank too much--

616
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,211
admittedly so. Admittedly so.

617
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,413
MAURlCE: But l just was
expressing an opinion--

618
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:13,049
 it's a free country--
and he attacked us physically.

619

 the clatter of the horses'
hooves on the cobblestone...

637
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,033
 the little ecole
where l studied so hard...

638
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,605

646
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,360

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,320
OK.

704
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,321
Oh, l'm sorry. Excuse me.

705
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,993
(Sobbing)

706
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,994
(Sad music plays)

707
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,166
(Sobbing)

708
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:31,038
QUEEN: Ohh.

709
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,921
Oh, God. Oh, God.

710
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,125
(Sobbing loudly)

711
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,931
Ohh!

712
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,932
(Speaking native language)

713
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:42,543
Ohh.

714
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,317
 -ln here.
-Ah, gentlemen!

715
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,319
 SPARKS:
Gentlemen, come in, come in.

716
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,320
Don't be shy. Don't be shy.

717
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,892
We are all men, are we not?

718
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,861
Men, men, men.

719
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:34,862
Where are your strapping
colleagues with my bags?

720
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:38,499
No trouble. Gives us more time
 to get acquainted.

721
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,739
 The male figure, gentlemen--
something to be very proud of.

722
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:47,777
 lt is beautiful,
and it is powerful.

723
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,779
Should be often exhibited...

724
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,780
and always, always celebrated.

725
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,184
Mmm.

726
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,220
Why, in ancient Greece--

727
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,655
Are either of you Greek?

728
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,057
ARTHUR: No.

729
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,092
 MAURlCE: Well, yes.
Actually, l'm half Greek.

730
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,795
SPARKS: Top half or bottom half?

731
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,563
(Sparks laughing)

732
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:08,998
(Both laugh along)

733
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,999
SPARKS: l jest, l jibe.

734
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:17,138
Perhaps we should wrestle
 sometime.

735
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:20,209
 Do you like
the taut roundness...

736
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,210
 that exercise
brings to the buttocks?

737
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:25,248
MAURlCE: Yeah.

738
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,617
SPARKS: Do you enjoy the warmth
 of the Mediterranean sun...

739
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,618
on that selfsame place?

740
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:37,858
 l once wrestled a man
on the steps of the Acropolis...

741
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,963
 when the sun
was at its height...

742
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,964
wearing only what God sent me
 into the world with.

743
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:49,336
Can you picture that?

744
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,514
That's where we'll wrestle,
 my semi-Grecian lad.

745
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:04,718
 That's where
l'll make a man of you.

746
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:10,224
OK, well, um...

747
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:12,695
it's been a real pleasure
 meeting you.

748
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,831
We do have to go now.

749
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,832
We have a lot to do
 on the ship...

750
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:21,070
as stewards on the ship...

751
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,071
and, um, thank you very much.

752
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,975
Um, good luck.

753
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,013
 SPARKS:
See you around the ship, lads.

754
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,182
ARTHUR: Oh, my God.

755
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,183
(Music resumes)

756
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:43,557
-Bon voyage.
-Bon voyage.

757
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:56,737

 -Oh, sorry.

758
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,610

759
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:43,617

760
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:46,055
(Knock knock knock)

761
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:49,056
 -What?
-Mr. Franks.

762
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,127
 PANCETTA:
Sorry l gotta rush you.

763
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,529
We need you for rehearsal.
 l got your bag.

764
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,530
HAPPY: Hey, wait, wait!

765
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,067
Hey, hey, hey, wait!

766
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,068
ARTHUR: This one's open.
Come on, quick. Come on.

767
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,776
(Maurice sighs)

768
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,619
(Toilet flushes)

769
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,620
SHElK: Oh, good. You are here
 to fix the gramophone.

770
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,658
 l don't know what
l was going to be doing...

771
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,026
if you did not come by.

772
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:26,429
l am not in the habit
 of fixing things.

773
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,464
l was listening to the music...

774
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,465
and then there was no more
 functioning, only silence.

775
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,135
 And when
she was singing no more...

776
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,771
l got so excited,
l tried to pull it...

777
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:38,407
but l scratched it,
 and l hurt it.

778
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:39,575
MAURlCE: You did hurt it.

779
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,110
SHElK: Yes.

780
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,045
 ARTHUR:
Well, You shouldn't pull it.

781
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,914
 SHElK: No, l know.
l am now realizing this.

782
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,082
MAURlCE: Good.

783
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,384
 ARTHUR:
We will fix your gramophone...

784
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:51,385
but we have to go and get
 the tools.

785
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,156
Ah.

786
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,624
Pass.

787
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,193
MAURlCE: Pass.

788
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:00,194
ARTHUR: Thank you.

789
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,966
(Both gasp)

790
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:06,967
 -lt's a new model.
-We don't need tools.

791
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,974
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

792
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,676
ARTHUR: There it is. You see it?

793
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,444
 -lt's bad.
-lt's very pulled.

794
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,580
ARTHUR: We may have to be here
 for a while.

795
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,115
MAURlCE: l know you don't know
 how these things work...

796
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:21,183
but they really shouldn't
 be pulled like that.

797
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,385
ARTHUR: No, they shouldn't.

798
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,754
SHElK: Excuse me.

799
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,889
Excuse me!

800

802
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:40,403
Ooh!

JEAN LENOlR SlNGlNG:
 Parlez-moi d'amour

00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,457
Redites-moi des choses tendres

806
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,561
What is it with this ship?

 ARTHUR:
What the hell is he doing?

811
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,673
 MAURlCE:

812
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:20,674
ARTHUR: Oh, my God, Maurice,
 we have got to get out of here.

813
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,778
Jesus. Look at him.

814
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:30,719
ARTHUR: He's coming over.

815
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,089
MAURlCE: Take it easy.

816
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,790
JEAN LENOlR SlNGlNG:
 Je veux encore

817
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,791
Ecouter ces mots que j'adore

818
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:41,361
Votre voix est si caressante

819
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:44,498
Que les murmures fremissants

820
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:47,568
Me bercent de sa belle histoire

821
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,106
Et malgre moi je veux y croire

822
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:56,543
Parlez-moi d'amour

823
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,881
Reditez-moi des choses tendres

824
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,020
Votre beau discours

825
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:10,891
Mon coeur n'est pas las
 de l'entendre

826
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,430
Pourvu que toujours

827
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,934
Vous repetiez ces mots supremes

828
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:26,073
Je vous aime

829
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,644
ll est si doux

830
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,813
Mon cher tresor d'etre
 un peu fou

831
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,415
La vie est parfois trop amere

832
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:36,318
Si l'on ne croit pas
 aux chimeres

833
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,319
Le chagrin est vite agueri

834
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:42,422
ll faut consoler...

835
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:45,759
Du coeur on guerit la blessure

836
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:50,197
Par un sermen qui le rassure

837
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,103
 MRS. ESSENDlNE:
Since my husband's demise...

838
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:57,104
 my daughter is obsessed
with pain, loss, and death.

839
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,642
She finds them romantic.

840
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,611
We don't find death.

841
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,747
lt finds us.

842
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,215
 MRS. ESSENDlNE:
lt's gonna find you in a minute.

843
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:09,216
Easy, easy, my dear,
 with that valise.

844
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,620
lt's hand-stitched leather.

845
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,022
Florentine.

846
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,023
lt bears the tatters
 of a Tuscan tryst.

847
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,726
-Another carcass.
 -Can it, Em.

848
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,230
 -Will that be all?
-Yes. Thank you, my dear.

849
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,235
MRS. ESSENDlNE: l'd tip you,
 but l'm clothing rich...

850
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,637
and cash poor at the moment.

851
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:31,638
See me at the end of the voyage.

852
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,878
(Mrs. Essendine sighs)

853
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,613
MRS. ESSENDlNE: Emily.

854
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:40,614
 Though this is, perhaps,
our last voyage of this kind...

855
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:44,618
given the tremendous blow
 to our finances.

856
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,656
EMlLY: You mean because Daddy--

857
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,657
Don't you dare to mention him !

858
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,395
That philanthropic cocksucker...

859
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,396
left all the money to the poor
 and not a dirty dime to me!

860
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,800
 Oh, Mary, Mother of God,
what have l ever done to you?

861
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:04,938
 Life without money
is no goddamn life at all!

862
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,310
You know that!

863
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:23,892
As l was saying...

864
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:26,893
this unfortunate turn of events
 notwithstanding...

865
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:30,230
 l want our trip to the Continent
to be a happy and hopeful one...

866
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,368
 so put a smile
on that lovely face...

867
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:37,804
 and let's pray that this ship is
overflowing with men of means.

868
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,510
(Both chanting)

869
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,855
BURTOM: God almighty, it's them !

870
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:55,856
 lt's you!
Get them ! Get them ! Get them !

871
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:57,760
Faster!

872
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,761
MARCO: Stop, please, please!

873
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:04,331
(Catches breath)

874
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,308
(Sighs)

875
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,511
(Panting)

876
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,324
(Door unlocking)

877
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,404
(Door unlocking)

878
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:45,405
Ohh!

879
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:04,526
(Running footsteps)

880

947
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:34,754
 Treating me like this,
an actor of my caliber!

948
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:37,957
 Ow! Go on, leave it,
you fucking useless bastard!

What?

967
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,158
When are the bombs

968
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,159
Midnight.

969
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,727

Please don't try anything.

01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:58,600
MAURlCE: You don't have

Good. OK, Maurice, listen.

EMlLY: Ohh.

1062
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,430
WOMAN: You seem so sad, Captain.

1063
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:14,269
l'm always a little sad.

1064
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,837
But why?

1065
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:18,838
You're the captain of
 a big, beautiful ship.

1066
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:23,645
You see...

1067
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,913
on every voyage...

1068
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:28,914
all my life l look for
 a woman l loved...

1069
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,986
so long ago.

1070
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:34,987
 Almond eyes
and the mouth of a cherub.

1071
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:37,025
WOMAN: Hmm.

1072
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,527
Oh, who's that?

1073
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:42,528
He's turning around.

1074
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:45,765
Good Christ, he's ancient!

1075
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,238
But look at those rings.

1076
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,239
Obviously he's loaded.

1077
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:57,111
Oh, God. Wretched.

1078
01:11:57,112 --> 01:12:00,112
Probably drop dead
before he gets here.

1079
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,992
Waiter.

1080
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:18,666

Oh, no, not in that glass.
 That glass.

1084
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:31,377
-That is for display, sir.
 -lt'll do just fine.

1085
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:34,513
-Should l have an accent, too?
 -What?

1086
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:36,918
l don't know.

1087
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:38,720
What kind of accent

1088
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:40,388
 l don't know.
That's up to you.

1089
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:43,389
 How about lndian?
l've always wanted to do lndian.

1090
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:46,894
Yeah, but you don't really
 look lndian.

1091
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,029
That's true.

1092
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,564
(Bartender clears throat)

1093
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:52,565
 Oh! There we are.

01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:23,929
JOHNNY: Pardon.

traveling alone unaccompanied.

1105
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:53,060
Alone.

01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,696
MAURlCE: We gotta do something.

1107
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:57,331
 ARTHUR:
We gotta find the bomber.

1108

 -Mm-hmm.

Gotcha.

1111
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:17,151
(Sighs)

1112
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:20,152
Danny Sussman.

1113

Excuse me?

1114
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,591
He was my agent.

1115
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:25,259
Some agent.

1116
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:28,260
 He was a great agent.
l loved him like a brother.

1117
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:31,632
 l loved my wife
like a mother and a hooker...

1118
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,034
and look where it's got me!

1119
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:36,035
Look! Alone, afraid...

1120
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:38,172
and l just want to die!

1121
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:40,842
 Don't give up, Hap.
You don't want to die.

01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,843
(Ticking)

1123
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,284
Sorry l'm late.

May l get you some champagne?

Oh, too kind.

D'amour

Reditez-moi

1132
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:17,343
Des choses tendres

1133

Votre beau discours

01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:30,489
La la la la la la la...

(Ting)

1136
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:39,233
Abend.

1137
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:42,234
Do you hear a ticking?

1138
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:45,072
No.

1139
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:48,073
Tick-tick-tick, like that?

1140
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:51,410
No.

1141
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:58,384
Hey, hey, the actor!

1142
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,588
Boy, you look so bad.

1143
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,823
 BURTOM: l found them !
They tried to murder me!

1144
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:04,325
 -Who?
-The stowaways!

1145
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,626
Stowaways? Where?

1146
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:06,627
Oh, God!

 l told the captain, but he
doesn't seem to understand!

1150
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:18,304
 You must do something.
The detective, he's missing.

1151
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,808
-Haven't seen him for hours.
 -Pity.

1152
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:22,643
Meistrich, tell the crew
 to step up the search.

1154

-Thank you.
 -Not at all.

1156
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:35,821

1157
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:37,658
ARTHUR: God, where is she?

1158
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:39,427
l don't know, Arthy.
 l don't know.

1159
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,428
God, Maurice. We're gonna die.

1160
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:53,341
Hey, there she is! Lily!

1161

(Ticking)

1165
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:08,153
-The stowaways were spotted.
 -Where? Are they here?

1166
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,957
 No. They are still
being sought out.

1167
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,459
Did Marco find them?

1168
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,460
 Nein.
He seems to have disappeared.

1169
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:17,131
What?

1170
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:20,132
May l have this honor?

1171

Excellent!

1172
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:34,982
That mouth...

1173
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,184
the mouth of a cherub.

1174
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:39,320
Could it be?

1175
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:42,321
ls it she?

1176
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:45,457
Amore mio...

Are you you?

1180
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,268
No, l'm not me.

1181
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:57,269
Yes, you are.

1182
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:58,673
Not anymore.

1183
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,208
 Since that night,
l have longed for you.

1184
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:02,610
And l for you.

1185
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:03,611
Amore.

1186
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:05,179
Amore. No.

1187
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,515
Si. Si.

1188
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:10,516
 When we are dancing
and you're dangerously near me

1189
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,720

1190
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:14,789

1191
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:17,790
 l want to hold you
so much closer than l dare to

1192
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:21,226
l want to scold you 'cause
 l care more than l care to

1193
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,530
And when you touch me and
 there's fire in every finger

1194
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,034
l get ideas

1195
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,869
l get ideas

1196
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,871
And after we have
 kissed good night

1197
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,640
And still you linger

1198
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:35,641
 l kind of think
you get ideas, too

1199
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:38,446
Your eyes are always saying

1200
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:40,347
The things you're never saying

1201
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:42,049
l only hope they're saying

1202
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,884
That you could love me, too

1203
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,653
For that's the whole idea

1204
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:46,654
lt's true

1205
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:47,988
Lovely idea

1206
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:50,989
 That l've
fallen in love with you

1207
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:55,429
 Shall l come to
your stateroom at midnight?

1208
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,698
Oh, yes. Yes.

1209
01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:00,067
Yes, again.

1210
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,570
(Whispering) Hey.

1211
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:05,571
He wants to kill you.

1212
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,442
He's trying to kill you!

1213
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:11,443
 -(Kicks)
-Oh, shit!

1214
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:18,853
Please excuse me.

1215
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:21,854
What a grotesque woman.

1216
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,924
(Ticking)

1217
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:29,597
Your eyes are always saying

1218
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,499
The things you're never saying

1219
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,167
l only hope they're saying

1220
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:34,969
That you could love me, too

1221
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,871
That's the whole idea

1222
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:37,872
lt's true

1223
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:39,406
Lovely idea

1224
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:42,407
That l've fallen in love
 with you

1225
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,413
Oh!

1226
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:48,582
(Whispering) Lily! Psst!

1227
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:51,118
Lily! Lily! Psst!

1228
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,119
Lily! lt's me!

1229
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:58,423
Arthur! lt's me! Lily!

1230
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:04,732
Ooh! Ow!

1231
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,133
BURTOM: Why don't you look
 where you're going?

1232
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,768
ARTHUR: Terribly sorry.
 Please forgive me.

1233
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:10,769
 BURTOM: You're British!
Thank God for that, old boy!

1234
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:14,206
 l've been drowning
in this sea of Americans.

1235
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:17,976
 -Oh, sure.
-They're all colonials.

1236
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:19,947
Every man Jack of them.

1237
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:21,916
-Now l've found you--
 -Yeah?

1238
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,251
-Let's go have a drink.
 -No, l'm fine.

1239
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:25,719
l'm not a drinker.
 l'm a teetotaler.

1240
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,720
MAURlCE: Oh! What the--

1241
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:32,024
Was that your best shot,
 savage gypsy lover?

1242
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:40,100
-Come to my stateroom.
 -Non, non.

1243
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:41,836
l will give you things.

1244
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,837
 l will take them,
but tonight at midnight.

1245
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:03,455
 ln my country,
they kill the insane.

1246
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:06,660
BURTOM: Where exactly
in England are you from?

1247
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:08,896
 ARTHUR: Chester near
Chichester-on-Manchester.

1248
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,898
-Never heard of it.
 -Quite small.

1249
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:13,899
Keep your eyes open, old boy.
 They could be anywhere.

1250
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:16,871
Here we are. Bottoms up.

1251
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,573
Oh, thank you very much.

1252
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:20,941


1253
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:21,075


1254
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:23,811
Don't give up, Hap.
 Don't want to die.

1255
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:26,046
Don't be afraid of love.

1256
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:27,514
Don't kid a kidder, kid!

1257
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:30,515
People are afraid of poverty,
 of war, of pestilence...

1258
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,720
of not knowing who they are
 or what they want, of dogs!

1259
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:39,324
And l say don't--don't
 fear these things!

1260
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:42,429
They're not real!

1261
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:45,430
You want something to fear?
 Do you know what to fear?

1262
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,435
Love. Fear love.

1263
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:50,671
 Love is real,
and it is terrifying.

1264
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:53,672
 lf you're gonna be afraid,
be afraid when someone says...

1265
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:55,843
l love you.

1266
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:57,444
Je t'aime.

1287
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:44,589
l think l have been found out.

1288
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:47,094
Our plan must be
 carried out now.

1289
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:50,095
 l will seize the queen and
escape with her immediately...

1290
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,633
then detonate the bombs myself.

1291
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,101
 Meet me in one hour
at the appointed place.

1292
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:57,102
This is Voltri, over and out.

1293
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:10,916
We've been found out, Johnny.
 What are we gonna do?

1294
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:14,386
 Don't tell me we're gonna
jump ship because l can't swim !

1295
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:18,056
Come on.

1296
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:21,562
BURTOM: lt was him ! l knew it!

1297
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:24,563
The stowaway is an impostor!

1298
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:27,766
 Come on.
Let's go and get those bastards!

1299
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:36,343
We haven't been found out.
 They're the impostors.

1300
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:38,545
Our cover ain't been blown.
 lt's business as usual.

1301
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:40,381
 Did you tell the sheik
to meet you in his room?

1302
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:41,382
l did, Johnny.

1303
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:43,050
 Aces. l'm meeting
the old broad in hers.

1304

 Go seek the sheik.

Hey.

1306
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:48,522
You knock him dead, kid.

1307
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:49,690
You bet l will, Johnny.

1308
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,059
Johnny? You're a genius.

1309
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,028
 Don't flatter me, babe.
l don't know what to do with it.

1310
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,662

ARTHUR: Hold it!

1320
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:22,689
Hi, Lil.

1321
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:23,690
-Arthy?
-Yeah?

 LlLY: Fellas,
we gotta find the first mate.

01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:41,141
Oh, Lily!

1330
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:43,677

1331
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:45,712
Marco, these are the stowaways.

lt's nice to meet you.

No! lt's OK!

1336
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:56,021
 LlLY: No, it's OK!
Marco, these two are actors.

1337
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:59,593
 They are pretending
to be the stowaways?

1338
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:01,361
No, they are the stowaways,
 but they're actors.

1339
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:04,362
So l didn't--You didn't die?

1340
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:06,900
No.

1341
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:08,502
l just pretended.

1342
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:11,105
Very good.

And you're an actor, too?

 Yeah.
Yes, l am also an actor.

1348

Well, would l have seen you
 in anything?

1349
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:29,957
lt's a possibility.

1350

1351
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:34,561
Do you think you have?

1352
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:36,463
ARTHUR: lt's--it's hard.

1353
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:39,133
 -lt's been a--
-Tough stretch.

 -lt's not--

But what can you do?

1360
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:54,481
 We're on a tickin' ship,

We've gotta go.

MARCO: Oh, my God! Why?

1363
01:25:57,018 --> 01:26:00,018
The first mate has planted
 bombs all over the ship.

1364
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:03,490
He's a gardener?

1365
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:04,725
What?

1366
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:07,094
How many bulbs did he plant?

1367
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:09,796
No, not bulbs. Bombs!

1368
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:12,797
 -Oh, bombs!
-We gotta go!

 So, now l see

 Not only are you
a two-timing harlot...

 but you are
a common criminal as well.

LlLY: l'm afraid so, Meistrich.

1381
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:01,982

No. l love you more.

1383

to ask you a question.

And you've probably
 thought of this...

1508
01:35:20,448 --> 01:35:22,716
 but when the baker
gave you the tickets...

1509
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,718
why didn't you just sell them
 if you needed the cash?

1510
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,719
l bet they were worth
 a lot of money.
