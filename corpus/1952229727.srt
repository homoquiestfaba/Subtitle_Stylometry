00:00:35,800 ---> 00:00:37,839
I need to speak with him.

2
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:44,349
- Do you remember me?
- Can I help you?

3
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:47,930
I have purchased tickets
in September.

00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:52,769

6
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:56,563
I was with my daughter.

7
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,691
She was abducted in the basement

8
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:03,443
She was 6 years old at the time.

9
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:08,662
It is red,

10
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:13,453

00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:16,456
a purple parka and ...

12
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:19,088
she has a backpack dark blue.

13
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,752
The parka has a hood.

14
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:24,139
No, I have not seen.

15
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:27,723
Sorry, it sells hundreds
tickets per day.

16
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:32,388
I thought
it could return.

17
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:37,602
Or someone
could see it.

18
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:39,107
Sorry.

19
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:51,029
Excuse me, sir.

20
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,161

21
00:01:53,336 --> 00:01:55,957
This is my daughter.

22
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:58,413

23
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,133
I'm looking for my daughter.

24
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:03,302
This is his photo.
She was abducted in September.

25
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:07,390

26
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:11,353
- With a hood.
- Sorry, I have not seen.

27
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,262
Sorry.

28
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:16,190

29
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:18,352
Please,

30
00:02:18,528 --> 00:02:20,983
You can help me,

31
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:24,071
I need your help ...

32
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:42,794
She wanted candy.

33
00:02:51,936 --> 00:02:53,431
He was abducted here.

34
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:57,597
Under my nose.

35
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:03,606
How long it lasted?

36
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:06,153
Not long.

37
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:08,201
How long we talked?

38
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,567
10 minutes.

39
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:12,530
10 minutes, impossible.

40
00:03:12,707 --> 00:03:14,746
Think!
How long?

41
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:17,700
"We are at the station,
we will board the bus. "

42
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,289
40 seconds.

43
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,712
"Yes, I bring to 6am."

44
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:23,960
"I know, I know."

45
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,258
"No, I bring not late."

46
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:29,548
A minute and a half
Perhaps both.

47
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:31,966
"Yes, I will
do homework. "

48
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:36,769
There was talk of his duties.
3 and a half minutes.

49
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,439
4 minutes.

50
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,694
"You want to talk to him?
Wait. "

51
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,571
4 minutes.

52
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:48,282
4 minutes, that's all.

53
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:51,618
4 minutes
look around you.

54
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:54,449
There must be something.

55
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,035
Where they went?

56
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,869
 16.30 for Carlstadt ...</ i>

57
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:00,120
It would have followed anyone.

58
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:05,258
Where they went?

59
00:04:18,273 --> 00:04:20,182
They took the bus there.

60
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:24,359
Not another.

61
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:27,145
Go ahead.

62
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,001
No access without tickets.

63
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:46,250
No access.

64
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,171
No time.

65
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:50,171
Too late.

66
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:56,767
Boarded the bus.

67
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:01,513
Go ahead.

68
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:10,482

69
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:02,282
His parka!

70
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:05,703
It was purple?

71
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:09,584
Descends.

72
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:11,380
Stop the bus!

73
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:13,884
I must get off!

74
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:17,349
You can stop?

75
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:19,344
- Sit down.
- Stop!

76
00:06:56,473 --> 00:06:58,466

00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:02,470
Where are you?

78
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:12,771
Where are you?

79
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,119

80
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:03,240
It's you.

81
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,618
It's your fault.

82
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,081

101
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:09,005
Stretch yourself.

102
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,602
It will pass.

00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:29,947
Stretch yourself.
You have to sleep.

00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:56,902

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,845

114
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:17,056
It takes 8 years.

115
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:36,033

00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,366
Did his father.

117
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:49,497

00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:13,436

Again.

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,534
Another.

131
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,992
I hear no music!

132
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,630
You put stronger?

133
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,514
I will not!

134
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:38,527

If it pleases you not,

138
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,919
Stronger!

139
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,117
Get out of here!

140
00:21:55,373 --> 00:21:56,369
What do you want?

141
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,000
Of coke.

142
00:21:58,793 --> 00:21:59,623
How?

143
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,034
Two.

144
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,042
I can see you.

145
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:46,537
I see you all.

146
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,907
4:26.

147
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:25,957
It is a sign.

148
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:32,251
The 4:30 to Carlstadt.
He removed at 4.30.

149
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:35,385
It is here. Nearby.

150
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:49,236
4:28.

151
00:24:19,142 --> 00:24:20,766
Wait.

152
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,606
 Tell me why.

153
00:24:34,992 --> 00:24:37,908
The stars shine.

154
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:43,197
Why  ivy wraps.

155
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:49,168
Tell me why the sky is blue.

156
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:54,674
And I will tell you why I love you.

157
00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:02,183
Because God 
made the stars shine.

158
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:07,846
Because God 
has entangled ivy.

159
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:13,863
Because God 
the sky was so blue.

160
00:25:16,741 --> 00:25:19,612
 Because God made you.

161
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:23,367
 That's why I love you.

162
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:30,707
What time is it?

163
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:33,208
Another minute.

164
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,007
It is here.

165
00:25:45,062 --> 00:25:46,176
I can feel it.

166
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:50,931
It comes.

167
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:54,569
Look at the door.

168
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,363
Look at the door.

169
00:25:57,532 --> 00:25:58,813
Monitors the door.

170
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:08,626
It is not him.

171
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:10,287
It's too early.

172
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:13,035
It's too early, wait.

173
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:15,424
It will come.

174
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,636
It is here.

175
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,805
I know.

176
00:26:36,237 --> 00:26:37,436
Think about it.

177
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,829
4:30 to Carlstadt,
Gate 8.

178
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:53,078
Why not pass the door?

179
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:55,164
Why?

180
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:13,814
II knows that you watch.

181
00:27:16,152 --> 00:27:19,356
My God, he knows who you are.

182
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:22,778
There you saw.

183
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:32,079
You look there.

184
00:27:32,836 --> 00:27:36,003
Where is he?
II you look.

185
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,921
Move!

186
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:53,263
Wait, you have to follow up.
Reverses the situation.

187
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,100
It does not suit you.

188
00:27:55,275 --> 00:27:56,686
You must catch it.

189
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:02,776
It is here. Nearby.

190
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:28,969
He knows that you know.

191
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,892
Wait.

192
00:28:34,064 --> 00:28:35,440

00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:37,398
He leaves.

194
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,436
Quickly, you gotta go.

Nobody looks at you.

207
00:30:38,564 --> 00:30:39,844
Breathe.

353
00:49:44,836 --> 00:49:46,664

The girl disappeared 
with his family.

Her father said she was smart,
it has saved.

368
00:54:38,296 --> 00:54:41,214
Do not talk to strangers.
He distracted.

369
00:54:41,383 --> 00:54:45,167
It is not the type to leave,
it should not have.

370

383
00:55:55,457 --> 00:55:57,285
Ca va. Enter.

384
00:56:04,466 --> 00:56:05,213
Sit down.

385
00:56:05,384 --> 00:56:08,718
No, I Kira left alone
she sleeps.

386
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:12,683
I have a service you ask.

387
00:56:13,267 --> 00:56:15,805
You can search
Kira to school tomorrow?

388
00:56:15,978 --> 00:56:18,682
You deal with it?
From 4 to 7.

389
00:56:18,856 --> 00:56:22,853
I have things to settle,
I go to 7am at the latest.

390
00:56:23,778 --> 00:56:25,320
Ok.

391
00:56:26,613 --> 00:56:29,283
If it is a problem,
I understand.

392
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:32,035
It's not a problem.

393
00:56:32,203 --> 00:56:33,531
With pleasure.

394
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:39,955
The school is in Hudson Street,
at the corner of High Point Avenue.

395
00:56:40,127 --> 00:56:43,662
Takes 88
until the 23rd street

396
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,548
Here you take 85.

397
00:56:45,717 --> 00:56:47,424
The driver will tell you where.

398
00:56:47,593 --> 00:56:50,962
The stop is 3 blocks from school.
Kira knows.

399
00:56:52,264 --> 00:56:53,509
A 4 hours?

400
00:56:53,682 --> 00:56:54,963
Yes. Is that clear?

401
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:56,056
Perfect.

402
00:56:56,936 --> 00:56:59,308
If there is an emergency
or else,

403
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,971
leave a message at the reception,

404
00:57:02,149 --> 00:57:03,692
I call often.

405
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:12,234
The key to our room.

406
00:57:13,703 --> 00:57:15,529
I do not know
how to thank you.

407
00:57:16,497 --> 00:57:19,830
Fun well,
we have a good time.

408
00:57:21,252 --> 00:57:23,161
I must go.

409
00:57:23,337 --> 00:57:25,710
You want to stay a little?

410
00:57:28,342 --> 00:57:29,801
I can not.

411
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:31,886
I gotta go.

412
00:57:35,474 --> 00:57:36,637
Good night.

413
00:58:16,348 --> 00:58:17,724
Sorry to be late.

414
00:58:18,226 --> 00:58:19,221
Ca va?

415
00:58:21,271 --> 00:58:22,599
Are you ready?

416
00:58:24,648 --> 00:58:27,519
Your mom told you
I came for you?

417
00:58:30,321 --> 00:58:31,400
What?

418
00:58:31,572 --> 00:58:32,651
Nothing.

419
00:58:48,339 --> 00:58:49,667
Put it inside.

420
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:09,394
It was good school?

421
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,730
I was going.

422
00:59:13,573 --> 00:59:16,739
Your mom told me that he not t'y
long overdue.

423
00:59:18,995 --> 00:59:20,323
You like?

424
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,160
Ca va.

425
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:25,575
You've made friends?

426
00:59:27,087 --> 00:59:30,253
My girlfriend
a daughter, Alyssa.

427
00:59:30,631 --> 00:59:32,624
It was nice,
at the beginning.

428
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,837
But now
it is a bit nasty.

429
00:59:36,012 --> 00:59:38,337
So I really love.

430
00:59:38,973 --> 00:59:40,349
What happened?

431
00:59:41,517 --> 00:59:45,467
She said that I was stupid,
and after that it was to laugh.

432
00:59:45,647 --> 00:59:48,433
But she continued,
then it is for real.

433
00:59:48,608 --> 00:59:51,395
Do you think when she says
that you're stupid?

434
00:59:51,902 --> 00:59:53,066
Sometimes.

435
00:59:53,238 --> 00:59:54,648
Do not.

436
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:57,814
You are very intelligent,
it shows.

437
00:59:58,201 --> 01:00:01,617
Does not listen to the wicked people
who say ill of you.

438
01:00:02,122 --> 01:00:03,865
Ignore them.

439
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:06,208
You can do this?

440
01:00:08,086 --> 01:00:09,544
I will try.

441
01:00:13,174 --> 01:00:15,381
These people are not your friends.

442
01:00:38,491 --> 01:00:41,576
You gonna be the new boyfriend
Mom?

443
01:00:45,582 --> 01:00:46,910

444
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:48,323

I do not know.

446
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:55,999
You miss your father?

447
01:00:56,926 --> 01:00:58,301
I think.

448
01:00:58,928 --> 01:01:01,134
You talked about him as when,
the last time?

449
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:04,724
I do not know.
It's been a long time.

450
01:01:05,268 --> 01:01:06,975
I have a mirror?

451
01:01:07,145 --> 01:01:08,722
When finished t'auras.

452
01:01:08,897 --> 01:01:10,272
I finished.

453
01:01:12,275 --> 01:01:14,516
Eat your meals.

454
01:01:15,946 --> 01:01:18,862
An ice cream after T'auras.
Okay?

455
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,194

456
01:01:22,368 --> 01:01:23,399
Ok.

457
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:42,087

459
01:01:47,977 --> 01:01:49,352

I for two minutes, OK?

461
01:03:00,049 --> 01:03:02,291
How many seconds
in a minute?

462
01:03:02,552 --> 01:03:03,797
Sixty.

463
01:03:06,514 --> 01:03:08,507
How many minutes
in an hour?

464
01:03:08,683 --> 01:03:10,059
Sixty.

465
01:03:16,149 --> 01:03:19,352
So how many minutes
in an hour Fifteen?

466
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:21,733
Do 60 minutes in an hour.

467
01:03:21,904 --> 01:03:24,656
60 minutes in an hour, then ...

468
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:26,271

469
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:44,510

471
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:49,965

475
01:03:58,942 --> 01:04:00,140
Very good.

476
01:04:01,152 --> 01:04:02,481
Write it.

477
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:12,948
Washing yourself.

478
01:04:13,122 --> 01:04:14,403
Ok.

479
01:04:22,507 --> 01:04:25,259
It's veins.
You see?

480
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:27,426
It veins of water.

481
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,301
Look at that one,
it is big.

482
01:04:31,808 --> 01:04:35,556
Mets post-shampoo.
Give your hand.

483
01:04:45,697 --> 01:04:47,488
Put in well behind.

484
01:04:53,496 --> 01:04:54,777
I have had enough?

485
01:04:54,956 --> 01:04:56,119
I think.

486
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:07,927
A message for you.

487
01:05:15,768 --> 01:05:18,438
- She called when?
- Y has a half-hour.

488
01:05:18,605 --> 01:05:21,974
- She left no number?
- Just what I wrote.

489
01:05:32,493 --> 01:05:33,905
What is there?

490
01:05:34,955 --> 01:05:36,497
A message from your mom.

491
01:05:38,792 --> 01:05:41,199
It may not return
before tomorrow.

492
01:05:41,377 --> 01:05:42,541
Why?

493
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:44,748
She said no.

494
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,414
It says it needs
longer.

495
01:06:08,071 --> 01:06:11,155
- My mom will come back?
- Sure.

496
01:06:13,243 --> 01:06:14,867
How do you know?

497
01:06:15,703 --> 01:06:17,744
Because she loves you.

498
01:06:18,665 --> 01:06:21,951
You love
and you want to be with her?

499
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:26,420
It feels
the same for you.

500
01:06:30,302 --> 01:06:31,677
Do not worry.

501
01:06:33,304 --> 01:06:35,428
It's time to sleep.

502
01:06:35,932 --> 01:06:36,963
To bed.

503
01:06:37,267 --> 01:06:38,677
Now?

504
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:42,061
You have brushed your teeth?

505
01:06:52,616 --> 01:06:54,240
Are you well?

506
01:06:57,162 --> 01:06:58,442
What is there?

507
01:06:58,788 --> 01:07:02,371
I miss my dad.
Why he left?

508
01:07:02,542 --> 01:07:06,125
I do not know.
Sometimes things are complicated.

509
01:07:11,676 --> 01:07:14,631
It will get better.
Try to sleep.

510
01:07:14,805 --> 01:07:17,093
- I can not.
- Yes.

511
01:07:20,435 --> 01:07:21,894
Close your eyes.

512
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:26,814
Try to sleep.

513
01:07:28,443 --> 01:07:30,898
I stay next to you.

514
01:07:40,164 --> 01:07:43,164
Sleep.
Close your eyes.

515
01:07:57,848 --> 01:08:01,631
Close your eyes.
Turn around on the side.

516
01:08:01,809 --> 01:08:03,803
Try to sleep.

517
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,482
Good night.

518
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,572
Are you happy?

519
01:08:58,074 --> 01:08:59,355
Me too.

520
01:08:59,952 --> 01:09:02,359
It's been a long time
I have not skated.

521
01:09:07,459 --> 01:09:08,870
You scared?

522
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:10,419
A little.

523
01:09:12,089 --> 01:09:14,247
Keep me,
agree?

524
01:09:28,605 --> 01:09:30,100
Well you have fun?

525
01:09:30,274 --> 01:09:31,472
A lot.

526
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:34,561
You're talented.

527
01:09:44,037 --> 01:09:45,235
I failed.

528
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,418
You have already done?

529
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,664
You can see,
Worry as already done.

530
01:09:58,844 --> 01:10:01,335
You're too talented.
This is the 1st time?

531
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,397
You want to try alone?

532
01:10:19,031 --> 01:10:20,441
You patinas alone.

533
01:10:20,615 --> 01:10:21,861
I get there!

534
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:23,777
It's good!

535
01:10:36,507 --> 01:10:37,787
Lance.

536
01:10:38,592 --> 01:10:40,170
A little harder.

537
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,383
10, is good.

538
01:10:51,438 --> 01:10:54,143
It's like bowling,
remember.

539
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:55,596
Make the move.

540
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,875
Continue to play.

541
01:11:32,438 --> 01:11:33,552
What?

542
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:44,611
You look at what?
Do not look at me!

543
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:48,574
Not look at me!

544
01:12:15,273 --> 01:12:16,683
Stop. 

544
01:12:15,273 --> 01:12:16,683
Stop.

545
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,071
Ca va?

546
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:31,369
I feel unwell.

547
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:34,660
This is gonna go.

548
01:12:39,713 --> 01:12:40,993
I'm sorry.

549
01:13:04,155 --> 01:13:05,981
This is gonna go?

550
01:13:12,038 --> 01:13:13,318
I think.

551
01:13:13,747 --> 01:13:15,289
Ca ira.

552
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,528
Give your arm, my flea.

553
01:14:12,472 --> 01:14:14,015
Stretch yourself.

554
01:14:39,792 --> 01:14:42,413
Sorry
I have not been able to return yesterday evening.

555
01:14:46,257 --> 01:14:47,371
Where were you?

556
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:49,459
She sleeps long?

557
01:14:49,635 --> 01:14:50,750
A good time.

558
01:14:50,928 --> 01:14:52,886
It went well?

559
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:55,798
Everything is fine.

560
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:08,235
Mom, you're back.

561
01:15:08,529 --> 01:15:10,107
Go back to sleep.

562
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:13,980
Where were you?

563
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,485
I went to see
Kira's father.

564
01:15:16,662 --> 01:15:19,236
You want some water?
I serve.

565
01:15:24,754 --> 01:15:27,161
Did not do the dishes.

566
01:15:37,808 --> 01:15:39,800
I'm tired.

567
01:15:41,229 --> 01:15:42,853
What's happening?

568
01:15:43,314 --> 01:15:45,887
It moves.
Eric has found an apartment.

569
01:15:46,067 --> 01:15:47,347
When you leave?

570
01:15:47,526 --> 01:15:51,654
Once I have my pay.
Sunday. Monday at the latest.

571
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:57,528
I will reimburse you what I can.
J'enverrai the rest later.

572
01:16:01,707 --> 01:16:04,115
Thank you to be occupied
Kira.

573
01:16:06,754 --> 01:16:08,462
We are still here?

574
01:16:54,928 --> 01:16:57,548
I see
before your departure.

575
01:16:57,721 --> 01:17:00,343
Spend tomorrow after school.

576
01:18:01,452 --> 01:18:03,907
My name is William Keane.

577
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:06,404
Keane.

578
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,585
K-e-a-n-e.

579
01:18:13,423 --> 01:18:16,127
I was born
Feb 6 1970

580
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:20,927
to the hospital in Yonkers,
County in New York.

581
01:18:24,308 --> 01:18:27,144
My father
Henry called Keane.

582
01:18:29,063 --> 01:18:32,230
The maiden name
my mother is Mary Conlan.

583
01:18:33,401 --> 01:18:34,894
She died.

584
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:38,485
I have a brother,

585
01:18:38,656 --> 01:18:41,408
a half-brother, Robert Keane.

586
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:50,495
I married Ann Etkin
August 16 1996.

587
01:18:51,085 --> 01:18:53,576
It was divorced 2 years later

588
01:18:53,755 --> 01:18:56,874
August 17 1998.

589
01:19:03,222 --> 01:19:05,464
We had a child.

590
01:19:06,559 --> 01:19:07,804
A daughter.

591
01:19:24,661 --> 01:19:26,700
You do from here.

592
01:19:26,871 --> 01:19:29,196
It's nothing good here.

593
01:19:47,183 --> 01:19:48,974
Kira, come here.

594
01:19:56,067 --> 01:19:57,940
What are you doing here?

595
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:01,894
I come for you.
You go to Albany.

596
01:20:02,072 --> 01:20:04,315
- Right now?
- Yes, right away.

597
01:20:04,492 --> 01:20:06,069
It is true?
Where's Mommy?

598
01:20:06,243 --> 01:20:09,161
She went to work
seek its payroll.

599
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:12,082
She will join us
at the station.

600
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:15,574
We'll take a taxi.

601
01:20:16,754 --> 01:20:18,912
I t'emmène.
Where are your business?

602
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:21,332
There, I will seek.

603
01:20:21,509 --> 01:20:23,667
I found you at the entrance.

604
01:20:23,844 --> 01:20:24,876
You hear me?

605
01:20:42,614 --> 01:20:44,072
Keep the change.

606
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:55,620
Put it.

607
01:20:59,506 --> 01:21:01,712
Give me your hand.

608
01:21:01,883 --> 01:21:04,800
You stay with me well.
It is understood?

609
01:21:22,362 --> 01:21:23,737
The teller ...

610
01:21:25,824 --> 01:21:27,781
Are you happy?

611
01:21:36,542 --> 01:21:38,202
Rest next to me.

612
01:21:39,629 --> 01:21:44,090
It takes a bus to Clifton,
then another to Albany.

613
01:21:44,676 --> 01:21:47,131
There is no direct bus.

614
01:21:56,688 --> 01:21:58,727
An adult
and a child for Clifton.

615
01:21:58,898 --> 01:22:01,520
- One way or round trip?
- Go easy.

616
01:22:03,361 --> 01:22:04,689
$ 5 20.

617
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:07,358
At $ 20.

618
01:22:08,783 --> 01:22:10,361
As taken a worry for Mom?

619
01:22:10,535 --> 01:22:13,369
- It has already hers.
- She bought when?

620
01:22:13,538 --> 01:22:17,999
Kira, I manage it. Not worry,
your mom will have his ticket.

621
01:22:19,252 --> 01:22:21,375
$ 14.80 currency.

622
01:22:26,509 --> 01:22:27,968
The bus leaves at 4:45?

623
01:22:28,136 --> 01:22:30,128
16.45, is 21.

624
01:22:31,139 --> 01:22:33,381
It takes all our tickets,

625
01:22:33,558 --> 01:22:36,049
if it arrived
before us.

626
01:22:36,228 --> 01:22:38,635
So
they do not fare too.

627
01:22:41,774 --> 01:22:43,932
I forgot not your mom.

628
01:22:52,326 --> 01:22:55,328
It was a little time.
You want to make a turn?

629
01:22:55,496 --> 01:22:57,869
To watch shops?

630
01:22:58,041 --> 01:22:59,286
It is true?

631
01:23:09,343 --> 01:23:11,835
I like this one,
you see?

632
01:23:12,388 --> 01:23:13,254
Which?

633
01:23:13,431 --> 01:23:16,681
The brown eyes.
And the Dalmatian.

634
01:23:16,851 --> 01:23:18,594
They are cute.

635
01:24:16,411 --> 01:24:17,905
We gotta go.

636
01:24:18,246 --> 01:24:20,820
We gotta go, come on.

637
01:24:23,376 --> 01:24:24,835
Therein lies.

638
01:24:31,384 --> 01:24:33,626
You're a nice girl,
you know?

639
01:24:33,804 --> 01:24:35,048
You think?

640
01:24:41,936 --> 01:24:43,728
Wait.

641
01:24:44,105 --> 01:24:45,932
Mom is there?

642
01:24:56,284 --> 01:24:57,909
I see it.

643
01:25:11,507 --> 01:25:13,963
You want a bar of chocolate?

644
01:25:14,135 --> 01:25:16,044
Here, take two.

645
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,217
Two?

646
01:25:17,431 --> 01:25:20,217
I call your mother
to see if it is a party.

647
01:25:20,391 --> 01:25:23,143
Come back here when you have finished.

648
01:25:25,188 --> 01:25:26,980
Here door 21.

649
01:25:27,149 --> 01:25:28,477
I know.

650
01:26:43,099 --> 01:26:45,342
Forgive me, Sophie.

651
01:26:49,231 --> 01:26:51,306
Forgive me.

652
01:27:23,766 --> 01:27:25,259
Ca va?

653
01:27:27,685 --> 01:27:29,394
Come here.

654
01:27:34,651 --> 01:27:36,524
Mom arrives?

655
01:27:39,364 --> 01:27:41,523
No, it is not yet a party.

656
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:43,988
The 16.45 for Clifton.

657
01:27:44,619 --> 01:27:46,612
Prepare your tickets.

658
01:28:01,052 --> 01:28:02,843
Come, we'll sit down.

659
01:28:21,532 --> 01:28:24,615
We will return and join
your mom in a restaurant.

660
01:28:24,785 --> 01:28:25,983
Really?

661
01:28:32,417 --> 01:28:34,410
Why are you crying?

662
01:28:35,921 --> 01:28:37,201
Cry.

663
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:49,308
Everything is fine.

664
01:28:49,559 --> 01:28:50,935
I love you.

665
01:28:57,484 --> 01:28:59,275
