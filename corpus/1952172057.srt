1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,610
Windsail Key.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,150
Your one chance to purchase the only
publicly available atoll in the U.S.

3
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:17,747
In essence, you'll be king,

4
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,826
or queen, of your own island.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,801
This is but one of eight secluded coves

6
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:26,439
affording you privacy within privacy.

7
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:30,693
Half of them are warmed by
your own personal hot springs.

8
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:33,159
Completely rebuilt and upgraded,

9
00:00:33,215 --> 00:00:34,483
Windsail Manor

10
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,619
is wired for senses
you don't even have yet.

11
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:38,724
Come on, Julia,

12
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:41,766
when have you ever known us to buy
anything without seeing it first?

13
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:44,881
Oh, I really thought my
wall would seal the deal.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,830
Tomorrow, at 8:00 promptly, our
catamaran will leave from the marina.

15
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,483
You will deservedly

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,568
be the first people to set foot
on Windsail Key since its rebirth.

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,850
I'm happy to answer any
questions about the prospectus,

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,687
or the mojitos.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,277
Enjoy.

20
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,878
I see you want it...

21
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,886
Just one second, please.

22
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,830
Hello?

23
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,253
Is anybody there?

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,243
Horatio.

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,460
This is Bill Winston.

26
00:02:46,548 --> 00:02:49,074
Billionaire philanthropist,
world traveler.

27
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,438
And now murder victim.

28
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,129
You are, ma'am?

29
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:57,966
Pamela Osborne.

30
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,144
I can't believe this.

31
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,568
She lives here, called it in.

32
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,926
I take care of everything for
the Winstons when they're in town.

33
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,933
I heard a noise and found him like this.

34
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,502
What was the event today?

35
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,410
Bunch of billionaires
jockeying to buy an island.

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,960
How well did you know these people?

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,368
Only person I recognized was his lawyer.

38
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:22,220
Mrs. Winston sells
high-end real estate,

39
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,928
so buyers fly in from around the world.

40
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,592
But trust me, this isn't
a group of killers.

41
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:31,648
Well, someone was the
exception to the rule.

42
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,836
Where is Mrs. Winston?

43
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,691
I'm over here, John.

44
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,630
But that's not your name anymore, is it?

45
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,824
It's Horatio Caine.

46
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,687
I like it.

47
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,427
You know what, you can go now.

48
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:07,506
Thank you very much.

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,230
You know her, Horatio?

50
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,297
Mrs. Winston, Frank...

51
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,664
is Kyle's mother.

52
00:04:26,061 --> 00:05:06,477
Team CSI
http://experts.heberg-forum.net

53
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,871
You've known about Kyle?

54
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,790
- For how long?
- Long enough, Julia.

55
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,191
Long enough.

56
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,252
I left him with my mom,

57
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,172
always planning to get him back.

58
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,652
I wasn't equipped to raise him,

59
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:44,305
and I didn't want to burden you.

60
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:48,368
Where is he now?

61
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,726
He's in jail.

62
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,118
Can I see him?

63
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,345
When the time is right,

64
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,525
we'll take care of this first, okay?

65
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,446
I want you to tell me what happened.

66
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,029
We got married in Cairo two months ago.

67
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,379
Just came from our house in Europe.

68
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,275
In a way, Bill and I...

69
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:19,894
just started to know each other.

70
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,764
I'm going to need
background on your guests.

71
00:06:22,898 --> 00:06:23,753
Of course.

72
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,953
Hey, did you hear that, uh,

73
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:47,545
Alexx got in a little fender bender
on the causeway today?

74
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:49,280
No. Is she okay?

75
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:51,050
Yeah, thank goodness.

76
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,330
I feel like today is so weird.

77
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,890
Did you hear what else happened?

78
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,485
Julia Winston,

79
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:58,057
the victim's wife, is Kyle's mother.

80
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,296
Kyle, as in Horatio's son?

81
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,340
Yeah, and Horatio had to tell
her that Kyle was in jail.

82
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,970
So that poor woman got bad news

83
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:06,905
about her husband and
her son on the same day?

84
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,020
I know.

85
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,815
I feel like we should try
and get her some good news.

86
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:13,354
All right...

87
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:17,458
C.O.D. is a
single gunshot to the chest.

88
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,278
The defect appears
to be front to back, so

89
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:22,416
he would have been facing our killer.

90
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,860
Yeah, no blood.

91
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,850
It's not through and through, so
the bullet would still be in him.

92
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,560
Well, that's good news, because
if it's not too beat up,

93
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,500
at least you'll have something
to go on.

94
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,490
Got some blood here
that's been disturbed,

95
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,905
which means somebody took
something from our crime scene.

96
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,687
And it looks like he dropped a pen.

97
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,676
Well,

98
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:55,441
give a man something to sign with,

99
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:56,944
means he probably
had something to sign.

100
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,820
So they took some papers.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,577
It's engraved-- it says,
"Larry Hopkins."

102
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:08,132
Practices law.

103
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,420
Who better to break it ?

104
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,794
I'm going to go and pay him a visit.

105
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,061
Mr. Hopkins,

106
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,719
Pamela Osborne,
the house manager,

107
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,564
told us that you were at the
house earlier today, is that true ?

108
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,381
It is.

109
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,031
I'm Bill Winston's attorney.

110
00:08:29,097 --> 00:08:30,476
I brought him some papers to sign.

111
00:08:30,923 --> 00:08:33,946
Yeah, I have a photograph here
of a void on Mr. Winston's

112
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:36,895
desk implying that some
papers had been removed.

113
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,440
You know anything about that ?

114
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,060
Bill insisted on
signing everything alone.

115
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,694
He said it gave him clarity.

116
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,743
So I was standing
outside waiting for him.

117
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,318
Just one second, please.

118
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,248
Then I heard the gunshot,
ran right in.

119
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,766
Bill ? Bill !

120
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,463
Never saw anyone go in or out.

121
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,268
And then what happened ?

122
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,319
I collected his papers and left.

123
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,374
You never called the police ?

124
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,759
No, I chose to get his affairs
in order.

125
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,292
Bill was a private man, and
it's my job to protect him.

126
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,830
Seems to me, Mr. Hopkins, that
you're protecting yourself.

127
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:25,250
You left the scene of a crime.

128
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:26,920
You can think what
you like, miss Duquesne.

129
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,326
Then I think I'd like
my evidence, please.

130
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,804
Well, even though
my client is dead,

131
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,320
he still has privilege. So...

132
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,830
you're going to
need a warrant for that.

133
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,893
Suit yourself, Mr. Hopkins.

134
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:39,868
I'll get one.

135
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,064
Until then,

136
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,341
don't go anywhere.

137
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm posting uniforms here
and at your residence.

138
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,805
Your life's on hold.

139
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,482
As assistant state attorney,

140
00:09:57,548 --> 00:10:01,250
I'll be prosecuting Kyle Harmon today,
Kathleen, in your kidnapping case.

141
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,544
Okay.

142
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,124
After Sergeant Tripp's testimony,

143
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:09,115
you're going to close
the deal for us, okay ?

144
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,050
Okay.

145
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,198
Listen.

146
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,594
Show your emotions,

147
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:15,190
but be strong.

148
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,518
I'm not strong, miss Nevins. I am...

149
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,220
going through a divorce I can't afford,
on top of the bills that I can't pay.

150
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,897
I understand that, but...

151
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:26,598
that doesn't mean that
justice shouldn't be served.

152
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,430
Kyle Harmon forced you from your home,

153
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,630
took you to a secret location
where he abandoned you.

154
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,031
I know what I did was wrong.

155
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,591
I'm really scared to go to trial.

156
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,468
Well, don't be.

157
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,330
Now, listen to me.

158
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,208
The victim, Kathleen Newberry,

159
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:56,109
is going to keep the focus on you,
you understand ?

160
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,183
Yes.

161
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,995
I'm going to ask you if this is
the young man who kidnapped you.

162
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,812
Can I just point to him ?

163
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,094
Absolutely.

164
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,929
I think about it every day.

165
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,927
Even though Rick Bates
put that gun to my head,

166
00:11:13,984 --> 00:11:16,059
I know what I did was wrong.

167
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,504
Can I also tell the jury about
how my husband was behind all this ?

168
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,050
Your husband's already gone from
corrections officer to inmate.

169
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:27,585
So now you need to focus on
making sure Kyle joins him.

170
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,255
Okay.

171
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:34,820
What if they find me guilty ?

172
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,480
Hang on a second. Let's
not get ahead of ourselves.

173
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,975
We're not there yet.

174
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,392
Are you all right ?

175
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,160
I'm fine.

176
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,166
What do you mean ?

177
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,326
About the trial, you just...

178
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,621
- You seem really, really upset.
- No, I just want to...

179
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,863
I just want to make sure
you're prepared, that's all.

180
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,120
Excuse me ?

181
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,485
So, I want you to get dressed.

182
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,940
Dad ?

183
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:14,248
Are you going to be there ?

184
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,816
Of course I will.

185
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,079
Now get dressed.

186
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:36,169
All it needs is your signature.

187
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,992
Wanted to make sure everything was
on the books before

188
00:12:39,095 --> 00:12:40,175
Kyle's trial.

189
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,943
I appreciate that, Frank.

190
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,654
Who is this woman ?

191
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,078
She's Kyle's mother.

192
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:04,087
That's not what I'm asking.

193
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,802
Who is she ?

194
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,750
John Walden is a cover
name I used 16 years ago.

195
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:20,996
I did some special task
force work in Pensacola.

196
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,843
That's when I met Julia.

197
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,090
Was it serious ?

198
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,482
It was for me.

199
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,407
Custody's a big step, Horatio.

200
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,269
Yes, it is.

201
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,711
Alexx, I got your message.

202
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,739
How are we doing ?

203
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:51,190
Recovered the bullet between T7 and T8.

204
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,812
It's mangled, distorted.

205
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,730
Projectile entered through the sternum,

206
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:01,908
passed through his aorta, up
to the thoracic vertebrae.

207
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,994
That would mean that his lawyer
could've walked in and shot him.

208
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,310
But not face-to-face,
like we thought.

209
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,617
As I was going through
his clothes, Eric,

210
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:15,847
it hit me.

211
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,730
There's no blood on it.

212
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,980
And no defects.

213
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:25,292
Based on the wound pattern

214
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:27,499
there should be something on the tie.

215
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:29,810
There was a pen on the ground, right ?

216
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,171
Papers missing.

217
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,673
He was getting ready to
sign something which means...

218
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,741
he was leaning over.

219
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,660
Okay, no way the killer
was lying on the floor.

220
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,140
Bill would have seen him.

221
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,510
Killer wasn't on the floor.

222
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,091
The killer was under it.

223
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:51,693
But there are no basements in Miami.

224
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:55,133
Alexx, money can buy you
a basement, if you want.

225
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,112
This is the very first wine
cellar I've seen inMiami.

226
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,387
They had to have dug it right
out of the coastal ridge.

227
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:33,377
This had to have cost a fortune.

228
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,792
It cost him his life.

229
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,156
I've positioned a bendy
where Bill Winston stood.

230
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,704
With the laser, let's see what we get.

231
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,977
This is the A.C. vent.

232
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,212
Winston must have liked
it real cold at his desk.

233
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,779
And the shooter stood right here.

234
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,301
Now confirm that with the laser.

235
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,035
Bingo.

236
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,595
There it is.

237
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,600
Thanks.

238
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,360
What's that right there ?
Do you see it ?

239
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,339
It's blood and hairs.

240
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,410
Maybe we got lucky. Maybe our
shooter was clumsy and hit his head.

241
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,626
Yeah, let's hope so.

242
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:34,405
Hey,

243
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,705
I need the results of that hairs.

244
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,532
I collect it, I run
it, and you're anxious ?

245
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,579
Yeah.

246
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,543
No. I'm not done yet.

247
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,320
Hey, did you hear that
Kyle's case is up today ?

248
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,659
Yeah, that's right.

249
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,211
Horatio's headed
over to the courtroom this afternoon.

250
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:53,413
That poor kid.

251
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:55,496
He's been used by everybody
his whole life

252
00:16:55,524 --> 00:16:57,534
and now he might spend
the rest of it in jail.

253
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,790
Well, I think if he gets acquitted,
Horatio's going to get custody.

254
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,940
Yeah, but even that might change now
that the mother's back in the picture.

255
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,682
I trust Kyle to make the right decision.

256
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,743
Yeah, me too.

257
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,066
I expect nothing less from H.

258
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,040
Oh, here we go.
We got a CODIS hit.

259
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,410
Rob Mason.

260
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:17,750
He's in here for white-collar crimes.

261
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,007
Looks like Rob just made
it to the big leagues.

262
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,588
So, how did you guys figure
out I was in the cellar ?

263
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,551
Because you left your hairs behind.

264
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,134
You guys...

265
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:34,636
are good.

266
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,770
I racked my head on that ceiling.

267
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,074
See.

268
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,200
Serves me right, I guess.

269
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,000
Why were you in the basement ?

270
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,407
Do you like fine wine ?

271
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,118
This place is like
the Tiffany's of wine.

272
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,420
Bill always talked about
his 1905 Rothschild Bordeaux.

273
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,563
So you had a taste ?

274
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,053
I wish I had the guts.

275
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,895
Just wanted to say I'd seen it.

276
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:14,826
Why open the vent ?

277
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,925
Okay.

278
00:18:20,185 --> 00:18:21,538
You got me.

279
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,475
So I wasn't there for something vintage.

280
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,524
Bill's always in that room.

281
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,347
I was hoping to get a hot tip.

282
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,503
Insider trading ?

283
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,189
You don't bank billions

284
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:38,217
playing by the rules, lieutenant.

285
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,804
Besides, he never said a word.

286
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,696
So you shot him.

287
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,186
Why don't you slow down there.

288
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,824
Okay, I've never fired a gun
in my life.

289
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,749
There's an easy way to prove that.

290
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,038
Now I'm no scientist,

291
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,835
but if I were guilty,

292
00:19:16,304 --> 00:19:18,314
that should have
changed color, right ?

293
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,521
Right.

294
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:21,938
Right.

295
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,125
Guess I'm out of here.

296
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,393
Excuse me.

297
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,925
Don't go far.

298
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,580
Time to find out if
you're guilty, Mr. Hopkins.

299
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,493
That's a search warrant for the papers
you took from Bill Winston's office.

300
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,876
Okay, well, I have some
clients coming in shortly,

301
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:52,415
but I will take a look at this...

302
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,385
do it now or I tear your office apart.

303
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,836
Do it now.

304
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,651
These are annulment papers, H.

305
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,060
Bill was going to dissolve
his marriage to Julia

306
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:23,460
based on the grounds that
Julia had committed fraud.

307
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,298
That's right.

308
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:27,710
Just after they got married, Bill
asked me to look into her.

309
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,098
So you stumbled onto her past.

310
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,218
She claimed to have
made millions in google,

311
00:20:34,594 --> 00:20:36,791
but she didn't have a dime.

312
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,241
And we uncovered at least five different
identities that she used in the past.

313
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,180
What tipped him off ?

314
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,510
The windsail key deal.

315
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,961
She cut their honeymoon
short to close it.

316
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:52,010
He figured anyone that concerned
with the payday must really need it.

317
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,480
So, she was using him.

318
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,570
In his world, everyone uses everyone.

319
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,700
But the playing field's
gotta start level.

320
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,300
Why go through with
windsail key auction at all ?

321
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,040
He was going to publicly
out her in front of everyone,

322
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,906
so she couldn't dupe anyone in private.

323
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,860
And she would be penniless.

324
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,473
There appears to...

325
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:12,323
be a lipstick smudge on those.
You don'T...

326
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:13,084
no.

327
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,070
Must be Julia's then.

328
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,410
That means she knows that he
was going to end their marriage.

329
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,779
And that is called motive.

330
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,270
Uniforms went to the
house, and Julia's not there.

331
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,275
What about her cell phone ?

332
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:30,305
It's turned off.

333
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,680
Turned off.

334
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:34,442
Okay. I've got an idea.
Thank you, Mr. Wolfe.

335
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,953
Yes, this is lieutenant Caine.
Kyle Harmon please.

336
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,523
Lieutenant, he's got a visi tor.

337
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,847
Okay, what is the name
of the visitor ?

338
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,800
Julia Winston.

339
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,905
Julia Winston.
Keep her there.

340
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,984
I always knew you'd come back.

341
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,646
I whispered that promise in your ear

342
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:02,646
the last time I saw you.

343
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,752
Really ?

344
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,994
I'll never leave you again.

345
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,875
I can't believe no one
taught you how to do this.

346
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,829
Yeah.

347
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,167
Well, I've never really worn a tie.

348
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,236
Brings out the blue in your eyes.

349
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,251
I'll teach you how to
do it when you get out.

350
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:27,163
That's if I ever get out.

351
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,901
I don't want to hear that.

352
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,154
Everything is going to be fine.

353
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,516
You didn't hurt anybody, did you ?

354
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:36,243
No, but I...

355
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:39,618
and I'm sure that woman
understands that you made a mistake.

356
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,329
We all make mistakes, don't we ?

357
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,037
Yeah, I guess.

358
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,040
Look at that.

359
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,706
So handsome.

360
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,794
Like your father.

361
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,738
Could I have a word, Julia?

362
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,420
Of course.

363
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,910
Outside, please.

364
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,180
Don't forget my promise.

365
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,006
Okay.

366
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,635
What are you doing?

367
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,567
I'm visiting our son.

368
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,661
You failed to mention his trial today.

369
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,582
I wanted to support him.

370
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:41,749
And you failed to mention you've used
five aliases over the last 15 years.

371
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,349
When I met you, you were
undercover for a living.

372
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,707
But I'm a police officer.

373
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,062
You found out about the
annulment, didn't you?

374
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:59,374
I stopped by the lawyer's last night
to go over the deal for the island sale.

375
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,047
Saw it on the table.

376
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,660
I'm going to go get some coffee.

377
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,245
- Would you like some ?
- Please.

378
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,946
And it was at that moment
that you realized

379
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:31,256
that you were about
to lose everything.

380
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,600
what are you implying ?

381
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,830
You called, Horatio ?

382
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,500
Check her car, please, Frank.

383
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,393
You bet.

384
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,827
You really think i killed
my husband ?

385
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,723
I guess we're going
to find out, aren't we ?

386
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,796
Horatio ?

387
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,068
I have no idea how that got there.

388
00:25:09,238 --> 00:25:10,825
Hook her up, please.

389
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,274
Yup.

390
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,980
You're wasting your time.

391
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,181
Why is that ?

392
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,735
Because you still love me.

393
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,835
I heard Horatio may have
found the murder weapon.

394
00:26:10,872 --> 00:26:12,970
Yeah, in Julia Winston's Mercedes.

395
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,880
How diabolical.

396
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,740
You know, if her husband
had signed the annulment,

397
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,260
she wouldn't have anything, and
now, she's a wealthy widow.

398
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,550
Hang on, Calleigh, okay ?

399
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,270
Let's just see what
the evidence tells us.

400
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,187
Okay.

401
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,991
Now, I got some pressure
distortion, there, but,

402
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:29,423
think I've got
enough to make a comparison.

403
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:32,050
I know that Julia is a savvy con artist,

404
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:35,020
but I'm thinking, she's
probably a rookie killer.

405
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,730
You're so sure of yourself that
I am going to let you confirm it.

406
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,188
My pleasure.

407
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,180
Ten-card's right there.

408
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:56,512
Okay, this print that you
gave me is not Julia's.

409
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,876
I said it. Told you she was framed.

410
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,310
Want to widen the search, run
it through afis, see what we get.

411
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,305
I got something.

412
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,410
Rob Mason.

413
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,030
The guy in the basement.

414
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,850
Thanks.

415
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,248
I'll bring him in.

416
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,503
Positive for gunshot residue.

417
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,020
That's got to be wrong.

418
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,610
Stand up, please.

419
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,743
Turn out your pants pockets inside out.

420
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,339
That's positive twice, Mr. Mason.

421
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,760
I was tested earlier, it was
negative. How could that happen ?

422
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,820
You put your hand back in your
pocket after you fired the weapon.

423
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:28,267
Then you scrubbed your
hands before you came in.

424
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,084
now that everything's out
on the table,

425
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:39,314
why'd you do it ?

426
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,440
Things were starting to come apart.

427
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,720
What was coming apart ?

428
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,090
I spent years bribing and embezzling
my way into the inner circle,

429
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,734
and I'm finally rubbing
elbows with billionaires,

430
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,139
and the help goes and screws it up.

431
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,747
Tim Gilbert.

432
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,162
Sorry. You must have me
confused with someone else.

433
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,298
Come on, Tim.

434
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:10,556
We worked at Ellicot house
cleaners, remember ?

435
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,300
That was a long time ago.

436
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,569
Yeah.

437
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,676
What are you doing here ?

438
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,471
What does that have to do
with your killing Bill Winston ?

439
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,942
Julia came to me with a deal.

440
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,944
She would not out me

441
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,249
as a fraud

442
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,728
if I did her a favor.

443
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,120
You want me to kill your husband ?

444
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,084
The gun will be here, Bill
will be upstairs.

445
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,010
I don't know. I can'T... i
can't do this. I'm not a killer.

446
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,880
Now, calm down.

447
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:50,399
He'll never even see you.

448
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,805
One

449
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:52,660
clean

450
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:53,618
shot.

451
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,870
Then leave the gun, and
I'll take care of it.

452
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,972
When you're done,
get back to the party.

453
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,240
What makes you think
I would kill someone ?

454
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,714
You lied your way in here so
you could be one of the big boys.

455
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,628
so be one.

456
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,813
she left me no choice.

457
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,405
Why don't you tell me what you
did with the gun after that ?

458
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,640
I left it there for Julia.

459
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,310
She said she'd take care of it.

460
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,890
By hiding it in her own car ?

461
00:30:20,212 --> 00:30:21,470
I don't think so.

462
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:24,840
I'm telling you, Julia's the
one behind this entire thing.

463
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,267
You may be telling the truth, Mr. Mason,

464
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,408
but we have no physical evidence
tying Julia to the crime, so

465
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:35,255
unfortunately for you,

466
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,030
she's played you perfectly.

467
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,245
The young man surrendered
without resistance

468
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,983
and has complied with all
that's been asked of him since.

469
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,372
But he did take her to
a secondary location.

470
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,511
That's correct.

471
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:00,854
and to reconfirm, that is the
man who abducted Kathleen Newberry.

472
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,232
Yes, it is.

473
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,370
These questions have
been asked and answered.

474
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,671
If there's nothing else,
let's move on.

475
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,460
Thank you, Sergeant Tripp.
That's all.

476
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,530
Witness is excused.

477
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,615
Thank you, judge.

478
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,210
Miss Nevins, your next witness ?

479
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,017
The victim in this
case, Kathleen Newberry.

480
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,990
She's scheduled for 11:30.

481
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,329
Let's proceed.

482
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,010
Your honor, as her testimony
promises to be long,

483
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:43,360
the state requests we break
for lunch before calling her in.

484
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,130
Court will resume in 90 minutes.

485
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,102
The defendant is remanded into custody.

486
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,736
so, Kathleen Newberry's a no-show, huh ?

487
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,630
Yeah. No one can find her,
which helps Kyle, of course.

488
00:31:58,689 --> 00:32:00,560
I'll send my team up there right now.

489
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,878
Thank you, Horatio.

490
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,164
Did I hear her say her
witness is missing ?

491
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:14,746
You did.
Where's Kathleen, Julia ?

492
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,260
Why are you asking me that ?

493
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,887
I'm asking you because
you petitioned for custody

494
00:32:18,943 --> 00:32:21,939
this morning hours
before this proceeding.

495
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,930
Of course I did.

496
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,480
I'd do anything for him now.

497
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,692
And that's my point.

498
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,710
Looks like Mrs. Newberry
was having a rough go of it.

499
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,580
There's a foreclosure here.

500
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,519
Some past due bills.

501
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,390
<i>Kathleen, this is assistant
state attorney Nevins.</i>

502
00:33:02,498 --> 00:33:04,230
But you know what?
There's no sign of forced entry.

503
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,963
There's no blood anywhere,
there's no signs of a struggle.

504
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,648
What about the voice mail ?

505
00:33:12,128 --> 00:33:13,095
Yeah.

506
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:14,335
There are, uh...

507
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,400
there are over a dozen of them.

508
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,913
Most of them are from asa Nevins.

509
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,292
Looks like she packed in a hurry.

510
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,700
Hey, come check this out.

511
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,548
She left one bag behind ?

512
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,328
It's a currency band.

513
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,860
$10, 000.

514
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,799
Yeah, she could've fit a
hundred of those in here.

515
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,315
So it looks like Kathleen
Newberry just became a millionaire.

516
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,454
Something oily on the bottom of the bag.

517
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,570
Hopefully trace can tell us something.

518
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,506
Like where all that cash came from.

519
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,046
My guess, it's from someone who
benefited from her disappearance.

520
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,450
I'm sorry, Mrs. Winston
isn't available right now.

521
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:45,490
She's had a very difficult day.

522
00:34:45,592 --> 00:34:48,440
Well, actually, I came to talk to
you because you run the house.

523
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,200
In exchange for living
here when they're gone.

524
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:52,829
I do everything when they're in town.

525
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:55,674
Well, we found a bag today
at Kathleen Newberry's house,

526
00:34:55,712 --> 00:34:58,750
and it had traces of acrylic
polymer and butyl carbitol.

527
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,926
What are those ?

528
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:03,490
They're cleaning solvents for marble
floors, which Kathleen doesn't have.

529
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,494
But you do, in every room.

530
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,440
We're not the only home in Miami
who has them, Miss Boa Vista.

531
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,910
No, but you're the only one with
motive for Kathleen to disappear.

532
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,680
Mrs. Winston's been in court all day.

533
00:35:13,718 --> 00:35:15,587
She couldn't have had
anything to do with it.

534
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:16,900
Well, see again, that's why
I wanted to talk to you

535
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,468
because since your boss
just inherited millions,

536
00:35:19,524 --> 00:35:21,931
I think she sent you
to pay off Kathleen.

537
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,140
Not that I did, but what would
be wrong with such kindness ?

538
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:29,176
Giving a woman who's fallen on hard
times a chance at a fresh start.

539
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,230
Someone did her a great service.

540
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,310
"Someone" ?

541
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,342
I think you're behind it.

542
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,671
The best charity is anonymous.

543
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,942
That might be true, but I
doubt that it was charitable.

544
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,854
Do you have a body ?

545
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,085
Are you saying there is one ?

546
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,928
If I have done anything, then
I helped a woman in need.

547
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,007
If you want to talk about this more,
I'll be in court looking after my son.

548
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,829
Criminal court, Department B
is now called to order.

549
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,219
All rise.

550
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,704
Okay, Counsel.

551
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,459
Your next witness.

552
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,608
Your honor, permission
to approach the bench.

553
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,220
Sidebar.

554
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,520
I have been informed by assistant
state attorney Nevins that

555
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,783
the prosecution's key
witness is unavailable.

556
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,206
Then the state is not able to proceed.

557
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,450
I therefore have no choice but to
dismiss this matter without prejudice.

558
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,426
So I'm free ?

559
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,112
You are, Mr. Harmon.

560
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,340
Upon discharge from the
Miami-Dade department of detention,

561
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,790
you are released to your parents,

562
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,766
both of whom have filed
separate petitions for custody.

563
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,975
So I have to choose ?

564
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,468
Yes, son, you do.

565
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,980
Court adjourned.

566
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:00,121
I'm no lawyer, but if
Kathleen Newberry doesn't show up,

567
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:02,074
Kyle can't be retried, right ?

568
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:04,212
That's correct, but

569
00:38:04,513 --> 00:38:06,607
I'm going to find her, Julia.

570
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:10,923
And when I do, we're going to have to
start this whole process over again.

571
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,020
Why would you want to put
your own son back in jail ?

572
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,946
I'm, uh...

573
00:38:15,528 --> 00:38:17,565
not actually
talking about my son.

574
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,636
Hey.

575
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,180
Do you have a twenty on Tripp ?

576
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:30,420
I can't seem to get ahold of him.

577
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,177
No, but Manchester and missing
persons got a court order

578
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:35,468
to access the department
of transportation records.

579
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,405
Turns out Kathleen has
a sunpass in her car.

580
00:38:59,116 --> 00:39:01,830
So there are records at every
toll plaza of her sailing through.

581
00:39:01,902 --> 00:39:02,800
She's in a hurry, too.

582
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,939
She's hit a lot of them.

583
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:05,341
She's north of Boca Raton,

584
00:39:05,379 --> 00:39:07,538
which means she's headed
way outside our jurisdiction.

585
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,400
So what if Julia's telling the truth
and Kathleen did take the money and run ?

586
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,740
Maybe, but I've got a bad feeling.

587
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,606
Man, it feels so good to be out.

588
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,672
Let's keep it that way, okay ?

589
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,975
Son...

590
00:39:33,065 --> 00:39:35,609
I can't tell you not to do this.

591
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,330
My whole life, I've been
moving from place to place.

592
00:39:42,432 --> 00:39:44,479
Okay, with nothing,
not even a photograph.

593
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:45,843
All I have is what I can remember.

594
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:47,220
Kyle, that's not true.

595
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,530
You have your freedom now.

596
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,505
I suggest you take care of it.

597
00:39:56,736 --> 00:39:58,201
You loved her once, right ?

598
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,557
I just need that chance to try.

599
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,818
I understand.

600
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,624
You stay in touch, though.

601
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,342
I will.

602
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,474
You take care of him.

603
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,252
I'm his mother.

604
00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:48,982
