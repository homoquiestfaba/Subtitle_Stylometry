1
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,611
<i>During the long, dark period
of the Great Wars,</i>

2
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:23,449
<i>an elite class of soldier
rose from battle.</i>

3
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:26,518
<i>Their unbreakable code
was simple...</i>

4
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,088
<i>Possess a noble heart
of courage,</i>

5
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,859
<i>right conduct,</i>
<i>and absolute devotion</i>
<i>to one's master.</i>

6
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:36,261
<i>From out of those years
of bloodshed,</i>

7
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,098
<i>an empire would emerge.</i>

8
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,201
<i>Its power would assimilate
persons of every color,</i>

9
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:44,736
<i>creed, and faith.</i>

10
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,772
<i>This uncontested rule</i>

11
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:50,476
<i>eroded the traditions
of the great knights,</i>

12
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,579
<i>but not for all.</i>

13
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,830
Lay down your swords,
you may walk free.

14
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,281
I'm the official envoy
of the Emperor.

15
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:39,518
-I carry a message
for Lord Bartok.
-I welcome you to the castle.

16
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,320
I will take the message.

17
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,555
The message is for you master.

18
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,992
Anyone who wishes
to speak with my master

19
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,594
must first speak with me.

20
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:51,396
Do you believe that the words
of the Emperor

21
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,533
are fit for a mere retainer?

22
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,272
I have no doubt
that your arrogance

23
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:01,707
is effective in other houses.

24
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,742
Therefore, it is a mistake
I am willing to forgive.

25
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,980
What is your name,
foot soldier? Mm?

26
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,515
I'm certain that the Emperor
himself would want to know

27
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,851
who has been so charitable
toward his envoy.

28
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,353
An introduction
would have been

29
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:17,322
the right place
for you to start.

30
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,692
I am Commander Raiden
of the Seventh Rank.

31
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:33,538
Your name
is well known to me.

32
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,276
Forgive my presumption.

33
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,332
My Lord.

34
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,382
This comes directly
from the capital?

35
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:21,720
Sealed before my eyes
by the Emperor himself.

36
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,756
Very well.

37
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,471
I am ordered
to the capital

38
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,907
to meet
with Minister Gezza Mott

39
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:46,978
to review new protocols
and duties.

40
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,648
This is a farce!

41
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,352
The new protocol
is the bribe expected of me
at that meeting,

42
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,953
and for no other reason

43
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,055
than to remain
in his good favor.

44
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:01,460
This minister's influence
has grown considerably
since your last term.

45
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,795
He is favored to succeed
as First Council.

46
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,531
I will not tolerate
this kind of bribery,

47
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,853
either in my own pocket
or in my capital.

48
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,474
- What are your thoughts?
- I follow you, My Lord.

49
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,413
Since when do you speak
anything but truth?

50
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,550
Say what you think.

51
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:29,020
Well, if it's truly
the injustice of corruption
which upsets you,

52
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,456
then perhaps you might
have been so passionately moved

53
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,493
to act before you arrived
in your own court.

54
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,762
What exactly do you mean
by that?

55
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,431
I mean that it would be
prudent to examine

56
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,533
if this is simply
a matter of pride.

57
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,902
It's not a matter of pride,
it's a question of dignity.

58
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,539
- So you will refuse the duty.
- I refuse the extortion!

59
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,908
My Lord, corruption within
the capital is nothing new.

60
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,911
How is this different
from any other absurd new tax?

61
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,715
When a man like that
can demand a bribe
out in the open,

62
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,583
with no fear of recourse,

63
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,487
we're headed
for a dangerous time.

64
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,125
What?

65
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:11,530
You think
I hold on to an idealism
that no longer exists?

66
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:14,566
Perhaps.

67
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,742
- Sir?
- I'm fine.

68
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:27,112
- Let me call the physician.
- He's examined me.

69
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:30,982
When? What did he say?

70
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,521
You will not speak of this
to them.

71
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,861
Ah, my beautiful ones return.

72
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,533
And how did your studies
go today?

73
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,035
Lilly's music instructor
has said

74
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,904
that she's
the most advanced student.

75
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,841
- Of course she is.
- I think he's exaggerating.

76
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,109
And I think he's
an astute judge of talent.

77
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:01,980
Either that or he's prepared
to request a raise in his wages.

78
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,116
Now, will you play something
for me?

79
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,655
Good.

80
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,093
Not all confrontations
will be one-on-one

81
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,061
as now practice sessions.

82
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,631
I was not aware
we were practicing
such a scenario.

83
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,699
There are never warnings
in battle.

84
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,801
Not all adversaries
will adhere

85
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,070
to the warrior's code
as we do.

86
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,040
You must always be on alert.

87
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,611
We must begin preparations
to leave immediately.

88
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:10,315
We've been summoned
to the capital.

89
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:14,019
Lieutenant, will I be
joining the convoy?

90
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,087
That is
the Commander's decision.

91
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,189
With all respect, sir,
I believe I'm ready.

92
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,192
If the Commander made
decisions based on what others
believed about themselves,

93
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,762
half these men
would have my position.

94
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,898
Gather the men
to prepare for our journey!

95
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,689
You startled me.

96
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,224
How long have you
been standing there?

97
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,093
Hours.

98
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:59,130
Your humor is not on par
with your stealth.

99
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,767
It is an unfair advantage
to use your skills
upon your wife.

100
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:07,672
Trust me, it is you
who has the advantage over me.

101
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,307
And what might that be?

102
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,688
I heard the official messengers
had arrived.

103
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,191
I take it they didn't
carry good news.

104
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,259
Why do you say that?

105
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:31,096
You may be able
to hide your presence from me,

106
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,897
but not your thoughts.

107
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,869
We are summoned
to the capital.

108
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:41,339
I thought you were not expected
until the turn of the season.

109
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:45,210
-It is a request
from our new minister.
-For what purpose?

110
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,946
Nothing worth disturbing
our evening for.

111
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,181
You mean you do not wish
to discuss it.

112
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,218
No, I mean I will soon
be apart from you

113
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,254
and I can think
of many better things

114
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,190
to occupy our time with.

115
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,660
Hmm.

116
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:05,163
It's difficult to argue
with that logic.

117
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,761
Come with me.

118
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,936
My great-grandfather,
a ferocious warrior.

119
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,705
Not well-liked,

120
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,207
but he was responsible
for expanding our lands

121
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,143
into the province
it is today.

122
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,879
My father...
He alone was responsible

123
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,482
for protecting these lands
during the Great War.

124
00:11:57,484 --> 00:12:01,386
You would've taken pleasure
in knowing him.

125
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,460
My son.

126
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,364
I have no heir.

127
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:18,036
I will be the tenth
and last generation
buried here.

128
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:21,005
30 years ago this month,

129
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,875
and against all counsel,

130
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:28,246
it was idealism that led me
to invite you into my home.

131
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,216
A young man
with an empty soul,

132
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,017
muddied by drink,

133
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:37,355
and as dark as the graves
of those who crossed his path.

134
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,795
But it was idealism
that saw through all of that

135
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,865
to the man I see before me.

136
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:50,335
Now you give me better advice
than I give myself.

137
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,877
When I have departed
this world,

138
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,913
these lands
will be in your care.

139
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:06,017
-My Lord.
-My name will be yours
to uphold.

140
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,020
But your sword is
to be passed to an heir.
I am merely your retainer.

141
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,923
You are the heir
to my spirit.

142
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:15,160
Our bond has been earned,

143
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,561
not inherited.

144
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,864
- No, sir...
- Take the sword.

145
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,898
- You be safe.
- Of course.

146
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,014
Be well, my love.

147
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,321
- You ready, Commander?
- Yes, My Lord.

148
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:19,524
We have the gift
for Minister Gezza Mott?

149
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,393
Yes,
it's all taken care of.

150
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,933
Shhh.

151
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,211
- Gabriel.
- Commander.

152
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,280
Thank you
for this great honor.

153
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,382
I knew your mother
and father well.

154
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,504
If they were still among us,
they would be very proud.

155
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,590
- So it begins again.
- So it does.

156
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,709
Sit down. Sit down.

157
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,184
Sir,
may I ask you a question?

158
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,321
Of course.

159
00:15:56,323 --> 00:16:00,558
You've known the Commander
a long time, yes?

160
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,427
Since I was your age.

161
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,000
Is it true he was not born
into the military class?

162
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,570
He comes from peasant stock.

163
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:17,342
Orphaned as a young boy,
entire family died of the fever.

164
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,279
Is that when Lord Bartok
took him in?

165
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:25,583
No. Much later,
when he was a young man.

166
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,621
- Why do you ask?
- Stories circulate about him.

167
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,625
They say he was cruel
and murderous

168
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:38,663
<i>without conscience or honor.</i>

169
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,065
For many years,
he was given to the drink.

170
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,267
The dark fog made him violent.

171
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,508
Does knowing this
change your respect for him?

172
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,580
One is to be admired
for rebuilding thyself,

173
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:58,116
not judged.

174
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,589
Now get some rest.
Long journey ahead tomorrow.

175
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:34,118
Welcome, Lord Bartok.

176
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,737
- Your journey went well?
- Quite.

177
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,439
It can be long.

178
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,674
It seemed short.

179
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,245
I see you've come
bearing a gift.

180
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,681
It's customary
for an official visit.

181
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,775
- A robe.
- A fine robe.

182
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,745
You may also keep the box.

183
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,288
Did your retainer
attend to the gift?

184
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,492
No, I chose it personally.

185
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:51,462
Very well.
We'll begin early tomorrow.

186
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,197
There is obviously much to do.

187
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:56,200
I look forward to your review
of the new protocols.

188
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,202
Yes, and in addition to that,
we'll get the chance

189
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,844
to discuss the challenges
which face the future
of the Bartok lands.

190
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,819
I don't think
he liked the color.

191
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,521
If I'd known
what you'd intended,

192
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,723
I would've insisted
you bring something more.

193
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,691
More?
I gave him the box too.

194
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,426
This is not a matter
of amusement.

195
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,629
He has taken this
as a personal insult.

196
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,498
-Tomorrow I will bring
a more suitable gift.
-You will not.

197
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,433
And in my presence,
you will refer

198
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,937
to the Minister's demand
as it really is... a bribe.

199
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,705
Adopting the language
of the pretense

200
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,275
only serves to ease
participation in it.

201
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:41,279
My Lord, I think that
perhaps now is not the time
to take such a hard stand.

202
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,681
And if I ease my approach now,
at what crossing

203
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,217
would you recommend
I stand my ground?

204
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:49,287
When they've
taken half my land?
When it comes to a point

205
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,390
where I have to
exercise my own tyranny
over those beneath me

206
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,792
to support the bribes
of those above?

207
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:58,596
Who does he think he is?

208
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:02,633
Perhaps he did not understand
what is expected of him.

209
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,570
He understands perfectly.

210
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:10,308
Does he arrive here
planning to make a name
for himself at my expense?

211
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,877
Or is he so filled up
with pride

212
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,613
that he has no room
for humility?

213
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,727
Here, dog,
a silk for your filth!

214
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,257
Where are we expected?

215
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,892
There is something
I wish to show you.

216
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,040
Such a fine sword.

217
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,377
May I?

218
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:36,394
This is a nobleman's blade.
Where did you come by it?

219
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,829
It was a gift...

220
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,600
from my master.

221
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,612
I have never heard
of such generosity

222
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:57,415
from lord to retainer.

223
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,927
It seems you have won.

224
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:21,105
It is my favorite room here
because it exemplifies

225
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:24,108
the great virtues
of generosity and humility...

226
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,943
Qualities necessary
to operate smoothly

227
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:27,645
within the workings
of the capital.

228
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:29,814
A quality
all the other noblemen

229
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:32,416
whom I have received
seem to grasp.

230
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:36,087
Are you beginning to understand
the points of our talk?

231
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:38,489
Yes.

232
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,524
Very impressive.

233
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,728
You really intend giving
all this away?

234
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,133
I'm reaching the end
of my patience with you.

235
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:53,504
We can play this game
as long as you like,

236
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:55,906
but you'll receive
no bribe from me.

237
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:58,509
Is that what this is to you?
A game?

238
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,077
How do you think the Emperor
would respond

239
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,946
to his command
being thought of as a game?

240
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,882
Since you're only threat
seems to be running
to the Emperor

241
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,951
like a pouting child,
you should ask him

242
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:08,919
- as soon as possible.
- I need not ask.

243
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,755
You were ordered
to this review by the Emperor,

244
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,089
and yet you reject his word.

245
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,824
I reject any attempt by you

246
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,560
to exert some delusional power
over me.

247
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:20,464
It is you who live
under illusion, not me.

248
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,439
I offer you no threat
but a promise.

249
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:31,809
I will not only take
your property and standing,

250
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:35,646
but I will turn everything
connected to the Bartok name
into dust.

251
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:39,917
And when I'm done,
it will be as if neither you

252
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,820
nor any generation before
had ever existed.

253
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:47,158
You should be careful
not to overstep.

254
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:59,069
Something wrong?

255
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,448
I have known many like you,

256
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,050
men who,
once their hairs bleed grey

257
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,885
and their spines cut them
like daggers,

258
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,727
come to revise
their own history.

259
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,857
Truth is that
your innermost fear

260
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,593
is in fact
your most striking attribute.

261
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:24,695
You are irrelevant.

262
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:27,031
You have neither cast a shadow
nor left any footprints

263
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:29,166
upon the great legacy
of the Bartok clan.

264
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,936
Your only achievement
was being born into nobility...

265
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:37,508
and you somehow failed
to reproduce even that.

266
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,251
Guards! Guards!

267
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,822
You draw your blade
on a minister of the Emperor?

268
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,208
Minister,
your father-in-law approaches.

269
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,977
What happened?

270
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:15,579
All I've been told
is that you were attacked.

271
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,781
I cannot say too much
at this time.

272
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,584
But we are about to witness
the wrath of the Emperor.

273
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:14,638
You have been summoned

274
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,609
before our most glorious
and wise Emperor.

275
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:22,046
The prisoner who stands
before you is Lord Bartok.

276
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,148
He has committed
the crime

277
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,652
of attacking a loyal minister
of the Emperor.

278
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:31,655
The prisoner will now
be permitted to address
his peers

279
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,191
before our master
passes judgment.

280
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:48,205
What has just been said of me
is true.

281
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:51,308
I offer no argument

282
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,045
nor dispute
the simple facts.

283
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,781
But they hardly begin to cover

284
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,684
the scope of my true crimes.

285
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:05,723
Honor requires
more than admission,

286
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:10,928
so I offer a full confession
and the whole truth.

287
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,732
For far too long,
I failed to recognize

288
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:17,635
my own hypocrisy.

289
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:21,372
I ignored
my own cowardice,

290
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:24,041
conveniently hiding
behind a position

291
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,777
of political compromise.

292
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,213
And for what?

293
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:34,218
To retain the meager wealth
and rank that men desire.

294
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,756
So I come before you
a condemned man

295
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:41,325
for having finally stood up

296
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,027
to injustice.

297
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:46,930
My shame and regret

298
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:49,133
is that I failed to do so

299
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:51,902
before it arrived
in my own court.

300
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:58,108
We supply the armies,

301
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,012
we build the roads,

302
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,215
we employ the nation.

303
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:08,919
Still, we remain silent
while our coffers are emptied

304
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:12,890
and our freedoms eroded.

305
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,792
There will be times

306
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:17,895
where we are powerless
to injustice,

307
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:20,397
but there must never
be a time

308
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,467
when we fail to protest.

309
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,777
This man, Gezza Mott,

310
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:38,716
is a cancer, growing.

311
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:42,352
And the only proper thing
to do is to cut it out.

312
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:48,158
You all know what I speak of.

313
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,496
Each one of you
has been subjected

314
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:54,498
to his extortion.

315
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,436
But my words are not in judgment
of my fellow noblemen,

316
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:03,107
they are a warning.

317
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:07,111
I urge you to consider
what you are doing,

318
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:10,047
for we are helping this man

319
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:13,517
to forge the very chains
that bind us.

320
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,155
Which brings me
to the confession

321
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,257
of my true crime,

322
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,327
so that I may redeem
my honor.

323
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,233
My crime

324
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:33,303
is only that I failed
to kill Gezza Mott

325
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:37,141
when I had the chance.

326
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,892
We have enjoyed
hundreds of years of peace

327
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:57,494
under my family's rule.

328
00:29:57,496 --> 00:30:00,330
We brought order

329
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:02,366
where there was chaos,

330
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:06,136
peace where there was nothing
but war and bloodshed.

331
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:10,440
My subjects accept their roles,
content in the knowledge

332
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:13,177
they serve the greater good.

333
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:17,848
If you think your words
will move your fellow noblemen
to dissent,

334
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,551
then you're sorely misled.

335
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:23,287
Are you prepared
to receive my judgment

336
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,022
and regain your honor?

337
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,158
I am prepared
to receive your judgment,

338
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,361
but my honor is intact.

339
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:34,431
You dare to contradict
the word of the Emperor?

340
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:43,073
All those in your house
shall be evicted
from your lands.

341
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:46,176
The Bartok clan is no more.

342
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:51,315
And your delusions of self
require more extreme measures.

343
00:30:56,588 --> 00:31:03,193
Your crime and defiance
to the ordinances
of the capital

344
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,630
shall be repaid with
nothing less than your head.

345
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:09,967
-You cannot do this!
-How dare you address
the Emperor directly!

346
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:14,171
My Lord, a judgment of this kind
is unprecedented for a nobleman.

347
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:17,608
This display of arrogance
cannot go unanswered.

348
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,346
What do you suggest?

349
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:44,368
Your Commander
is fiercely loyal to you,
Lord Bartok.

350
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,404
And so it is fitting

351
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,940
that you should meet your end

352
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,341
by his sword.

353
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,315
Should you refuse the order,

354
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:02,286
all of Lord Bartok's
blood relations shall be
executed as well.

355
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:04,621
- Minister!
- First Council,

356
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,190
the word of the Emperor
has been spoken.

357
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,297
Commander!

358
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,246
Let him pass.

359
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:59,209
- You will do this.
- No.

360
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:02,579
-I'm already dead.
-I will take death
at your side

361
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,648
rather than participate
in this spectacle.

362
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:09,219
I know you will,
but how will that serve us?

363
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:17,127
My Lord...

364
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:21,498
- I cannot do this.
- It's already done.

365
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,735
Think only of what follows.

366
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:29,439
The spirit of our clan
will endure through you.

367
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,640
Commander Raiden!

368
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:38,382
The Emperor's word
is not a request that
requires your decision.

369
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,725
Remember this, Raiden,

370
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:54,097
the wounds of honor
are self-inflicted.

371
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:04,174
- Draw your sword.
- My Lord, please.

372
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:08,412
Commander, draw your sword.

373
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:18,255
Your devotion to the code
is absolute, is it not?

374
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,795
-Yes, My Lord.
-Then, as your lord
and master,

375
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:29,066
I order you
to complete this duty.

376
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,679
From this moment on,

377
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:18,348
be no more grieved
about what you have done.

378
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:30,814
This will quiet
any whispers of dissent
for quite some time.

379
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,455
We must deal
with Commander Raiden
with a quick and firm hand.

380
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:40,991
Do you offer this
for our master's benefit
or your own?

381
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:43,927
Did you see
how he stood before you?
He's a rabid dog, that one.

382
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:47,697
We control the warriors
through their absolute loyalty
to their masters.

383
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:50,033
How do you think two million
of them would react

384
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:52,002
if we eliminated
one of their own

385
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:54,804
for exemplifying
the virtue of loyalty?

386
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,707
What if he should
seek vengeance?

387
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:01,745
He is not to be touched.

388
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:04,614
There are already
too many disavowed

389
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,850
looking for a reason to act.

390
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:11,688
If you come upon real proof
that he intends to move
against you,

391
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:16,693
then I will order his death.
But not until then.

392
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:21,698
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Master. Until then.

393
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,935
Shall I see to the eviction
and the subsequent dispensing
of the Bartok lands?

394
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,038
The lands should be
divided equally

395
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,640
so as not to favor
one nobleman over another.

396
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,043
Of course.
But I will not
bother our master

397
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:35,011
with the details
at this time.

398
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:37,380
I will
attend to it myself.

399
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,949
I'm certain you will.

400
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,893
You must keep aware
of the Minister, My Lord.

401
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:54,464
I know you do not approve
of Gezza Mott,

402
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:58,702
but his ambition and greed
serve my interests well.

403
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:01,037
Yes, My Lord.

404
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,418
Hannah.

405
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:19,923
Father.

406
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:52,789
Auguste! I hear your crops
were plentiful this season.

407
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,993
Yes, they were.

408
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,729
So the lands I took
and gave over to you
proved sufficient

409
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,898
in replacing the dying ones
you had when we first met?

410
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,401
They have.

411
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:06,636
Perfect.

412
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,107
Now tell me,
you knew Lord Bartok.

413
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,076
What do you know
of his retainer?

414
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:16,413
I did not know Bartok
that well,

415
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:18,748
though we had
a few dealings.

416
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,652
As to this Raiden,
I only know of him
through rumor.

417
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:25,422
Tales of his violent past.

418
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:27,524
You spent time with him.
What is your assessment?

419
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:31,161
I would be shocked
if he were to let this go.

420
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:34,964
I ask that you send me
a thousand of your men

421
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,033
to increase my security
until this is over with.

422
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,701
- A thousand?
- Yes.

423
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,503
That is more than half
my retainer.

424
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,906
All of whom you have
because of me.

425
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:49,045
Would you prefer to return
to the impoverished state
you were in

426
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:52,182
before I graciously
took your daughter as my wife?

427
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,625
No, Minister.

428
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,064
You will oversee
the eviction.

429
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,200
After that,
and for as long as it takes,

430
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:12,769
I want eyes upon Raiden
every minute of the day.

431
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:16,139
When he decides to strike,
we will be ready.

432
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,562
Sir!

433
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:49,165
Are we going
to let this happen?

434
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:53,269
- We won't leave without a fight!
- Yeah!

435
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:56,940
Everyone must pack
their things and leave.

436
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:59,976
Palace guard
is already on its way.

437
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:03,179
We're simply to be thrown
out into the street
with nothing?

438
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,315
How are we supposed
to support ourselves?

439
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:08,184
Commander,
are we to understand

440
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:10,687
that you would
have us do nothing?

441
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:13,823
Our master is dead.

442
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:16,759
I'm no longer your commander.

443
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,299
From now on,
you owe allegiance
to no one but yourselves.

444
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:29,739
Gentlemen,

445
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,712
you are disavowed.

446
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,093
Don't touch her!

447
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,431
These people
are losing their home.

448
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:32,068
You will treat them
with respect.

449
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,242
Where are you going?

450
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:29,318
- I'll have a drink here!
- Round for my friends.

451
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,050
That's all of it?

452
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:36,519
Well, it's barely enough
to meet our expenses.

453
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,121
Tonight we'll treat ourselves
to a good meal in the city.

454
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:40,923
It will do you good.

455
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:44,227
All right.
Well, I'll be on my way.

456
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:46,863
The roads into the market
will already be busy.

457
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,651
Did you see?

458
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:13,456
Your father gave me
my own brand.

459
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:15,324
That's wonderful.

460
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:17,593
He's never taken
to an apprentice so quickly.

461
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:20,363
And I hope soon
to stop saying "apprentice"

462
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:22,064
and start saying son.

463
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:25,334
Now add your mark.
We have to be going.

464
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,937
Once they have done
installing the panels,

465
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,205
we will continue
with the floors.

466
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:04,674
Yes, sir.

467
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:22,291
Cannot find a dagger
like this anywhere
in the land.

468
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:28,731
- Token of my deep respect.
- Support such as yours

469
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:31,033
is how our nation
grows in strength.

470
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:34,103
You can be certain your request
for tax relief will be heard.

471
00:49:34,105 --> 00:49:36,138
Thank you, Minister.

472
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:41,010
- Are you almost done?
- Yes.

473
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:43,112
Perhaps my body
would have the strength

474
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:46,248
to rid itself of this memento
if I had a physician
of real skill.

475
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,651
I have followed
the proper treatment.

476
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,687
Something seems to prevent
the wound from closing.

477
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:54,089
Is that what you offer
as an explanation?

478
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:56,692
"Something"?

479
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:01,297
Get out!

480
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,070
Why did you send
a servant away?

481
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:12,108
You do not allow
for interruptions
when in conference.

482
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,276
Did you consider
that the servant is required

483
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:17,480
to taste everything
she brings me for the threat
of poisoning?

484
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,783
No?

485
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:23,719
Or perhaps you were fully aware
and you feigned ignorance.

486
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:25,755
- Of course not.
- And I'm expected

487
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:27,797
to take your word
simply because you're my wife?

488
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:34,797
The tea's getting cold.

489
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,341
It appears the tea
is not poisoned.

490
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,776
How is the gate coming along?

491
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:32,588
This iron gate is capable
of holding back
an entire army.

492
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,523
Perhaps,
once it is installed,

493
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:36,292
we could release
some of the extra guards

494
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:38,494
on loan
from your father-in-law.
Providing for them

495
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:41,430
has brought us outside
the parameters of our budget.

496
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,833
The cost
will not be an issue.

497
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,704
The cost of the pavilion
now stands at five times

498
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:50,639
the approved estimate.
Without the gold leaf...

499
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:54,410
As stimulating as your accounts
of my accounting are,

500
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:56,645
I need a word in private
with my commander.

501
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:05,488
- What news have you for me?
- More of the same.

502
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:08,624
- And his men?
- Scattered about.

503
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,227
Finding employment
where they can.

504
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:14,597
-Has he had any contact
with them?
-No.

505
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:17,199
And yet he still remains
in the capital.

506
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:22,204
We have eyes upon him
every moment of the day
and night.

507
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:26,208
He's patient.
But his act doesn't fool me.

508
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,577
Nor should it you.

509
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:31,147
Prod him.

510
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:34,216
Find out what he's hiding.

511
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:41,323
Please follow me.
Look who is here.

512
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,429
- Lieutenant.
- Please sit, everyone.

513
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:49,665
- Bring us some more to drink.
- Gabriel.

514
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:53,903
So, what do you say
about my establishment?

515
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:58,307
-Certainly
it is a good fit for you.
-A perfect fit.

516
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,543
And you, how are you
keeping yourselves?

517
00:53:00,545 --> 00:53:03,379
I'm managing the fishing boats
of a wealthy merchant.

518
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:05,548
Gabriel is working
for them also.

519
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,184
That would explain
your distinctive fragrance.

520
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:10,519
And the reason my wife
allows me to remain here alone.

521
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:11,854
No other woman will touch me.

522
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:14,857
Perhaps without compensation.

523
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:20,262
- Half price for you.
- No, thank you.

524
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,332
I will accept that offer.

525
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:25,201
Once you begin paying
for your drinks,

526
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:29,271
I will consider extending
my discounts to others.

527
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:32,808
Gentlemen,
to your prosperity.

528
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,211
-That way you will
further increase mine.
-Hear, hear.

529
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:36,812
Cheers.

530
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:42,318
- And you, Jim?
- I work when I can.

531
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,919
Maybe there's some work
at the harbor.

532
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:45,721
- Should I inquire?
- No.

533
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:48,357
Such...
Such a labor's not for me.

534
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,559
Between your poverty
and his smell,

535
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,721
I must be sitting with
the two loneliest men
in the capital.

536
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:57,046
Indeed, we're
the two loneliest men.

537
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,010
He spends
most of his days here now.

538
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,585
Though you told me
he had fallen back
to his old ways,

539
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:19,989
I find it hard to believe.

540
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:24,627
He appears to be better
than usual tonight.

541
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:28,297
-I must be going.
-Please, do not leave
on account of him.

542
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:31,033
It sickens me to be
in his presence.

543
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:34,303
Lieutenant. Lieutenant!

544
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,675
Where you going?

545
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,446
Come and have a drink
with me.

546
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,717
I'm no longer your lieutenant.

547
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,581
Raiden, wake up.

548
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,992
Here, drink this.

549
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,671
Let us get you home.

550
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:46,375
I'm fine.

551
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:50,546
-Let me help.
You can barely walk.
-I don't need your help.

552
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:52,614
I'm fine.

553
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:03,659
You will not find anyone
better than me

554
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:05,794
to teach your son
how to wield a sword.

555
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:07,730
I gave you my offer.

556
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:10,632
And I don't see anyone else
here bidding on your talents.

557
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,904
So do you accept my offer?

558
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:17,806
'Cause I have no more time
to waste.

559
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:21,777
Yeah, good luck with your son.
He's gonna need it.

560
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:24,613
And then I saw him coming
out of Gezza Mott's front gates.

561
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:28,050
How? He would have
never been allowed
within the Minister's walls.

562
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,519
He's working
as a metal worker's apprentice

563
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:32,454
and has an entirely
new identity.

564
00:56:32,456 --> 00:56:34,089
I questioned others
in the square about him.

565
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:36,458
He must've been
in desperate need of work.

566
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,827
I'm certain that
the Minister would pay
handsomely to know

567
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:42,464
that one of Bartok's men
has created a false identity

568
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:45,901
in order to work
right under his nose.

569
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:52,508
Shall we?

570
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:55,577
The first thing I'll do
with my newfound fortune

571
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:58,113
is obtain lodging closer
to drinking establishments.

572
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:03,185
- I like the sound of that.
- And then I'll earn my...

573
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,805
You're late.

574
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:28,577
Jim saw you leaving
Gezza Mott's today.

575
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:30,646
He was gonna bring
that information to Gezza Mott

576
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:32,181
with hopes of a reward.

577
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,597
I was left
with no other choice.

578
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:42,458
- It is my fault.
- Not your fault.

579
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,527
Jim was willing to sacrifice
your life for his own rewards.

580
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:50,132
That's it, we cannot
have any more mistakes.

581
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,800
Do you have the credentials?

582
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:59,074
Gezza Mott's compound
is now the most fortified
complex in the nation.

583
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:02,010
Gaining entry is not only
going to be difficult,

584
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:05,781
it is probably impossible.

585
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:09,017
The only point
of direct access is here,
at the main gates.

586
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,857
<i>The drawbridge is raised
at sundown,</i>

587
00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:17,693
<i>when the day workers
must exit.</i>

588
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:21,063
It<i> must be operated</i>
<i>at both sides at the same time</i>
<i>in order to cross.</i>

589
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,006
We have to
take control of it

590
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:35,110
from the outside, here,
and the inside, here.

591
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:37,946
<i>Past the main gates,
soldiers' barracks.</i>

592
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:40,816
250 soldiers sleep here
every night,

593
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:42,851
<i>fully armed
and ready to fight.</i>

594
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,920
<i>We won't be able to
fend them off if we wake them.</i>

595
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:46,688
Once past
the soldiers' barracks,

596
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,590
<i>we must enter
the garden maze.</i>

597
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:51,660
<i>It's the only way to traverse
the compound unseen.</i>

598
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:54,796
Not only do I have to
prune every tree,

599
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:56,765
but since the Minister's
chambers are set so high,

600
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:58,767
I have ensure the gardens
look good from above.

601
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,969
<i>That brings us to the pavilion.</i>

602
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:04,540
<i>It is the only point
of cover before the castle.</i>

603
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:08,010
If we are able to survive
the torrent of arrows
raining down upon us,

604
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:11,213
we'll finally reach
the iron gates of the residence.

605
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:16,151
Absolutely impossible
to open from the outside.

606
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:21,557
- Sir, I must be going.
- Yes, of course.

607
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:24,726
- Where you going?
- To see his girl.

608
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:26,862
Why are we spending time
on this

609
00:59:26,864 --> 00:59:29,865
when we could be hearing
the young one's tales
of innocence lost?

610
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:32,834
Leave the boy be.
Mind yourself.

611
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:40,309
Here are the forged
documents necessary
for working inside the compound.

612
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:00,996
I must do some repairs
to the roof of your watchtower.

613
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:04,199
The previous carpenter
did not do very good work.

614
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:07,336
With the wages they pay us,
who could blame him?

615
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,372
I sold three baskets today.

616
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,045
Something wrong?

617
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,850
I'm tired of eating nothing
but rice.

618
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:58,120
If I was not
the only one working,

619
01:00:58,122 --> 01:01:00,756
perhaps we could afford
something else.

620
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:18,040
Why are you still doing this?

621
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:20,075
There's no shame
in feeling grief,
but destroying yourself

622
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:23,245
-will not bring
Lord Bartok back.
-Spare me your insight.

623
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,884
That is all we have left.

624
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:31,086
Why not stay in with me?
Just one night!

625
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:33,255
And watch you
weave more baskets?

626
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:35,457
Please, Raiden!

627
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:37,993
Please.

628
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:41,063
I cannot do this
for much longer.

629
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:41,583
Where is it?

630
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,561
- Where is it?
- What?

631
01:03:52,563 --> 01:03:54,563
Your sword.

632
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:59,167
Oh.

633
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,609
Here it is.

634
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:20,956
I'm leaving.

635
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:23,325
I agree.

636
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:26,862
This is not
the type of establishment
for a respectable woman.

637
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:29,998
I'm leaving you.

638
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,100
I have struggled
with the hope that
you'd come back to me,

639
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:34,369
return to being the man
I married.

640
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:38,573
But that you'd sell your sword
only proves you never will.

641
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,416
If you have something
to say to me to make me
think otherwise,

642
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:51,353
now is the time.

643
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:20,315
Sir, the Minister
has been summoned.

644
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:35,497
His wisdom and loyalty
will forever be remembered.

645
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,176
Come with me.

646
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:54,582
Before his passing,
First Council recommended

647
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:58,119
I pay attention to
your dealings with the noblemen.

648
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:01,957
He believed your methods
are exceeding political

649
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:04,125
and moral propriety.

650
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,194
There is a balance
to be maintained

651
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:08,463
between dominance
and patronage.

652
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:11,299
Your initial gesture
as First Council

653
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:16,037
will be a new tax relief
for both the citizens
and the noblemen.

654
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:22,277
It is the great honor
of my life to serve you
in this capacity.

655
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:25,580
Your appointment
also brings to an end

656
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:29,050
any and all bribes demanded
of the noblemen.

657
01:06:29,052 --> 01:06:31,119
In your capacity
as Minister,

658
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:33,521
there was sufficient distance
between us

659
01:06:33,523 --> 01:06:35,523
that I could allow you
such freedom.

660
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:39,060
But no more.
It is not needed.

661
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:41,563
And this obsession
of yours with Raiden

662
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:44,332
will cease immediately.

663
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:48,003
You surround yourself
with more security than I.

664
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:49,604
It's an embarrassment to you.

665
01:06:49,606 --> 01:06:53,108
He has already
destroyed himself.

666
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:57,412
Accept that you've emerged
the stronger with some dignity.

667
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,750
Yes, Master.

668
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:07,589
I thank you
for your guidance and wisdom.

669
01:07:07,591 --> 01:07:11,426
Does he not understand
that I'm under siege?

670
01:07:11,428 --> 01:07:15,030
My Lord, I believe Raiden
is no longer a threat to you.

671
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:18,633
- Why?
- He has sold his sword.

672
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:21,369
And?

673
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:24,172
A warrior disposing
of his sword

674
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:26,775
can only be interpreted
in one way.

675
01:07:26,777 --> 01:07:30,345
He has abandoned all attachment
to his former self.

676
01:07:30,347 --> 01:07:32,414
You think to pacify me
with this?

677
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:35,116
Who cares
about a piece of metal?

678
01:07:35,118 --> 01:07:38,286
Do you think you can
obscure your failure
to expose him

679
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:42,590
by using this juvenile
warrior's code as justification?

680
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:45,493
Leave me.

681
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:48,496
I will decide
what need be done.

682
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:12,120
Show yourself.
Show yourself!

683
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:14,556
Show yourself!

684
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,136
My husband requests you.

685
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:40,615
These unfolding paths
have been quite interesting,

686
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:42,250
when you consider them.

687
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:50,158
As I ascend to the apex
of my ambitions,

688
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,260
he sinks further
into the abyss.

689
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:56,731
In recognizing that symmetry,
if you were him,

690
01:08:56,733 --> 01:09:01,436
could you allow
such a personal disgrace
and affront to go unanswered?

691
01:09:01,438 --> 01:09:04,839
No.
So I've come to realize

692
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:09,444
that we're dealing
with someone of such
profound internal damage

693
01:09:09,446 --> 01:09:13,148
that he has simply
not been pushed far enough.

694
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:24,292
Find me Lord Bartok's family.

695
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:32,834
Do you take issue
with anything asked of you?

696
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:36,371
Not at all.

697
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:38,940
And for this price,

698
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:41,876
there's not much
I would take issue with.

699
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:25,987
Commander.

700
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:34,762
I have a surprise
for you tonight.

701
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:37,999
A new selection.

702
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:51,579
And listen,
no negotiating on this one.

703
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:54,482
She's still a virgin.

704
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:09,897
Raiden.

705
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,275
Raiden.

706
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:29,984
You have come for me.

707
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,700
What is wrong?

708
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:52,573
You have come to take me,

709
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:55,576
have you not?

710
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:04,752
Raiden.

711
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:10,024
Please! Please!

712
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:14,662
Please! No! No!

713
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:18,700
Raiden! Raiden!

714
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:24,539
Raiden!

715
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:27,408
Raiden, help me!

716
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:31,646
No!

717
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:33,414
No!

718
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:35,850
Don't leave me.

719
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:11,419
It is over.

720
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:22,497
<i>There is nothing left to do.</i>

721
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:24,832
Are you sure?

722
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:26,968
Perhaps he simply
didn't care for the girl.

723
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:29,904
Are you listening to me?

724
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:34,809
His master's daughter
was presented to him as a whore,

725
01:13:34,811 --> 01:13:37,712
and he did nothing.

726
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:41,149
<i>He cares for nothing.</i>

727
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:46,487
<i>Not honor, not his family,
not himself,</i>

728
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:48,489
and certainly not you.

729
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,768
At last,

730
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:04,972
I'm free of this.

731
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:13,047
Well done! Well done!

732
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:32,800
I've marked where the urns
are buried.

733
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:32,059
You did well.

734
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,986
We have planned,

735
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:02,223
we have sacrificed,

736
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:06,027
we have waited
for the right moment.

737
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:07,862
And now...

738
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:14,869
it is time.

739
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:03,050
Auguste, welcome.

740
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:07,355
I see you come bearing
quite the gift.

741
01:17:07,357 --> 01:17:10,157
I wanted to give you
something special

742
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,894
to recognize
your well-earned appointment

743
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:17,031
and to thank you
for returning my men.

744
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:34,048
Of all the gifts
I have received,

745
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:37,084
this is my favorite.

746
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:42,289
I'll have a short visit
with my daughter

747
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:44,725
before my journey home
with my guards.

748
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:48,195
Yes, yes,
that will be fine.

749
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:16,090
Honor is something
that all men are born with.

750
01:18:16,092 --> 01:18:19,293
It cannot be taken from you,

751
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:23,831
nor can it be granted.

752
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:26,834
It must only not be lost.

753
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:34,275
<i>We now stand at the door
of our final great act.</i>

754
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:38,879
<i>Tonight, our enemy
will bear witness</i>

755
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:42,416
<i>to the unbreakable code
of the Seventh Rank.</i>

756
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:51,792
We will reclaim
what they tried to take.

757
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:58,299
We will restore the name
of our master...

758
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:06,474
- the voice of our people...

759
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:09,744
and the spirit
of our nation.

760
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:47,748
Guard! Guard!

761
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:59,726
Hold them
as long as you can.

762
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:54,481
- It is him!
- Stay in your chambers.

763
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:57,718
Why did I ever trust you?
I told you, you imbecile!

764
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,920
Remain in your chambers!

765
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:03,223
Open the flaps!
Ready the archers!

766
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:25,946
Lord Bartok was my oldest
and dearest friend.

767
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:29,783
I knew you would not allow
this disgrace

768
01:26:29,785 --> 01:26:32,553
- to go unavenged.
- My master told me that

769
01:26:32,555 --> 01:26:34,721
should I be left
without anyone to trust,

770
01:26:34,723 --> 01:26:37,257
that I could always trust you.

771
01:26:37,259 --> 01:26:40,594
I offer my help
in any manner you need.

772
01:26:40,596 --> 01:26:44,598
But with a condition...

773
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:48,368
<i>You ensure
my daughter's freedom</i>

774
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:50,337
<i>from that man.</i>

775
01:26:50,339 --> 01:26:52,773
- I give you my word.
- Tell me what you need.

776
01:27:13,328 --> 01:27:15,495
Find somewhere safe to hide.

777
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:19,833
Wait.

778
01:27:19,835 --> 01:27:22,236
Thank you.

779
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,546
Let's go!

780
01:31:04,826 --> 01:31:07,227
Did I do well?

781
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:11,031
You fought well.

782
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:14,935
You fought well.

783
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:00,847
We have come for Gezza Mott.

784
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:04,518
I can no more back down
than you.

785
01:37:52,466 --> 01:37:55,368
You think you're a hero?

786
01:37:59,306 --> 01:38:04,244
You will be remembered only
as a traitor and a disgrace.

787
01:38:06,146 --> 01:38:08,982
Only time will tell
how we are remembered.

788
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:15,388
Something you...

789
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:17,190
no longer have.

790
01:38:51,225 --> 01:38:54,460
Who is it? We're closed.

791
01:39:52,453 --> 01:39:55,555
Your father's honor
has been reclaimed.

792
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:06,265
The Bartok name
will never be forgotten.

793
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:15,208
Thank you.

794
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:29,255
To wage an attack
on the First Council,

795
01:40:29,257 --> 01:40:32,792
the flagrant disregard
of my power...

796
01:40:32,794 --> 01:40:36,629
It will not go unanswered.
The only question is,

797
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:39,565
how severe the punishment,

798
01:40:39,567 --> 01:40:43,336
how many generations
of each should I wipe out.

799
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:54,213
The only reason
you are all here

800
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:57,350
is because I am without
a First Council.

801
01:40:57,352 --> 01:40:59,552
Now will someone
speak their mind?

802
01:40:59,554 --> 01:41:04,123
My Lord, it would be prudent
to recognize

803
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:07,527
that to the people,
these men are heroes.

804
01:41:07,529 --> 01:41:10,263
- Heroes?
<i>- To the people,</i>

805
01:41:10,265 --> 01:41:14,734
<i>these men stand for the virtues
that made our nation great.</i>

806
01:41:16,437 --> 01:41:20,473
<i>Virtues once exemplified
by all warriors.</i>

807
01:41:20,475 --> 01:41:25,211
<i>Now hardly to be found
in any.</i>

808
01:41:25,213 --> 01:41:29,549
<i>If your punishment
is seen to be unjust...</i>

809
01:41:31,351 --> 01:41:34,087
<i>you chance
turning these warriors</i>

810
01:41:34,089 --> 01:41:38,091
<i>into martyrs
for a cause against you.</i>

811
01:41:38,093 --> 01:41:41,527
However, if we treat them
with the respect

812
01:41:41,529 --> 01:41:44,297
befitting
an honorable warrior,

813
01:41:44,299 --> 01:41:47,100
we align these heroes
with us.

814
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:59,145
I cannot allow
such transgression
to go unpunished.

815
01:42:00,681 --> 01:42:02,448
Everyone must be reminded

816
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:06,219
that no one can stand
against the Emperor.

817
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:08,287
My Emperor...

818
01:42:10,724 --> 01:42:14,527
may I offer a solution?

819
01:42:14,529 --> 01:42:16,362
<i>I have one more request.</i>

820
01:42:16,364 --> 01:42:19,899
If we are to succeed,
the Emperor's first instinct

821
01:42:19,901 --> 01:42:22,502
will be to take
the heads of each of my men
and their families.

822
01:42:22,504 --> 01:42:25,838
-You are correct.
-But, as with all
his decisions,

823
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,540
he will first seek advice.

824
01:42:27,542 --> 01:42:29,675
Without a First Council
at his side,

825
01:42:29,677 --> 01:42:35,615
-he will be open
to the voices of others.
-You mean to say mine.

826
01:42:35,617 --> 01:42:37,850
<i>My men accept that death
will be waiting for them</i>

827
01:42:37,852 --> 01:42:41,387
<i>upon completion of our task.</i>

828
01:42:41,389 --> 01:42:43,823
<i>They are warriors
of the Seventh Rank.</i>

829
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:49,362
<i>They will not ask
for a reprieve.</i>

830
01:42:49,364 --> 01:42:51,764
But I ask it for them.

831
01:42:51,766 --> 01:42:53,933
And not yourself?

832
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:59,472
<i>These warriors
are nameless to most.</i>

833
01:42:59,474 --> 01:43:01,841
<i>But one stands apart.</i>

834
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:08,814
One is known to all.

835
01:43:27,801 --> 01:43:28,834
Commander.

836
01:43:33,473 --> 01:43:37,543
-What is this?
-You are to assume command
at the castle.

837
01:43:37,545 --> 01:43:39,312
No.

838
01:43:40,314 --> 01:43:41,594
Commander.

839
01:43:44,618 --> 01:43:46,886
Commander,
you cannot do this.

840
01:43:46,888 --> 01:43:51,724
We stand with you.
I stand with you.

841
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:54,727
Lieutenant, your devotion
to the code is absolute,
is it not?

842
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:58,497
Yes.

843
01:43:58,499 --> 01:44:01,234
Then as your commander,

844
01:44:01,236 --> 01:44:03,769
I order you

845
01:44:03,771 --> 01:44:06,472
to take control
of the Bartok clan.

846
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:46,579
<i>It is with benevolent wisdom
and esteem</i>

847
01:44:46,581 --> 01:44:50,549
that the Emperor proclaims
these noble warriors

848
01:44:50,551 --> 01:44:52,818
as heroes of the people.

849
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:56,355
<i>They are a shining example
and a reminder</i>

850
01:44:56,357 --> 01:44:59,759
<i>of those values
that bind us</i>

851
01:44:59,761 --> 01:45:02,461
<i>as one great nation.</i>

852
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:06,432
However, no matter
what the circumstance,

853
01:45:06,434 --> 01:45:09,669
<i>an attack on a member
of the Emperor's council</i>

854
01:45:09,671 --> 01:45:14,440
is by law
considered an attack
on the Emperor himself

855
01:45:14,442 --> 01:45:16,575
<i>and our great nation.</i>

856
01:46:24,444 --> 01:46:25,878
I'm sorry.

857
01:46:27,414 --> 01:46:31,751
I am so sorry for all
you've had to endure.

858
01:46:31,753 --> 01:46:35,755
Acting the part
was not difficult.

859
01:46:35,757 --> 01:46:38,624
Wondering if
I was truly losing you

860
01:46:38,626 --> 01:46:41,660
was unbearable.
