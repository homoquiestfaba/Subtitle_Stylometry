1
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,694
Have you ever been outside?

2
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:40,035
I mean not temporarily.

3
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,974
I mean born outside,

4
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,170
never been inside,

5
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,443
never been petted, not even once.

6
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,109
Yes?

7
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,745
Then you know about the darkness

8
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:58,019
that is not appropriate to talk about.

9
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:02,188
I had a bloody paw
when they found me

10
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:07,791
and carried me in a towel
to the cageatorium.

11
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:11,600
It was not cool there,

12
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:16,905
but they said, "We'll come back
for you, Paw Paw."

13
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:21,778
"Paw Paw"--
That's what they called me,

14
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,147
and they called each other
Sophie and Jason.

15
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,676
Can you get me some water?

16
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:58,411
I'm not getting up.
I'm just shifting my position.

17
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,957
If we had a crane,

18
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:10,451
then we could get water
without getting up.

19
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,124
We could just...

20
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,066
How would you turn the faucet on?

21
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,003
Just with my mind.

22
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,098
It's such a shame that the only thing
you can do with your mind

23
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,101
is something that you could
just do with your hand.

24
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:30,742
Well, at least I have that,
you know?

25
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:34,742
You can't really do anything
special with your mind?

26
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:38,018
Well, except stop time.

27
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:41,754
Oh, really?
I wasn't aware of that.

28
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,126
Can I see an example?

29
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,927
Turn the faucet on.

30
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,364
I don't want to waste water.

31
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,732
You really want me to stop time?

32
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:50,736
Yeah.

33
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,737
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,262
Yeah? All right.

35
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,899
1...

36
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,337
2...

37
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,371
3.

38
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,604
You're so bad at this.

39
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,607
Really?

40
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,506
I thought I was doing good.

41
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,573
Hello, and thank you
for calling Horizicom.

42
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,742
My name is Jason.

43
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,842
Can I have your service lD number?

44
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,819
What operating system are you...

45
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,658
And hop, hop, hop.

46
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,122
Keep on hopping.

47
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:33,234
And up, up,
and run under!

48
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,111
Look how dark it is.

49
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,376
I know.

50
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,414
Sign out.

51
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,114
My video got over 10,000 hits.

52
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,818
Did you see it yet?

53
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,559
No, l--no.

54
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,155
That's okay.

55
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,530
It wouldn't really
be your thing anyways.

56
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,761
And what operating system
are you running?

57
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,565
Okay, great.

58
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,169
Uh, can you go to mail?

59
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,545
And then click on
"Preferences."

60
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,244
Now read to me what it says there.

61
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,847
There you go.

62
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,188
Is there anything else
I can help you with today?

63
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,250
Thank you for calling Horizicom.

64
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,762
Have a nice day.

65
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,662
How was class?

66
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,291
It was canceled

67
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,269
on account of me
being overqualified.

68
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,270
Really?

69
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,169
Yes.

70
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,039
It was very satisfying actually.

71
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,044
The president was there.

72
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,045
Obama?

73
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,740
Exactly.

74
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,010
And he declared me,

75
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:54,679
on behalf of all the principalities,

76
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,484
free to dance

77
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,887
or do whatever I want.

78
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,859
Like if you just want to be
on Facebook all the time, he's--

79
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,423
he's cool with that?

80
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,398
Well, he knows that
I've been gearing up

81
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,198
to do something really incredible

82
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,638
for the last 1 5 years.

83
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,837
Did he say anything
about your little friend?

84
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,105
No.

85
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,840
He doesn't know about Shirty.

86
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,849
Shirty is private,

87
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,977
not that I'm embarrassed
or anything.

88
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,422
Yeah. I think that place is definitely
gonna put him to sleep.

89
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,392
So then we're totally doing
the right thing?

90
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,224
I think we are. Yeah.

91
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,957
I think we're ready.

92
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,662
Ready for...

93
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,734
Hey, well, you know I think we are.

94
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,676
Anyways, it's just for six months.

95
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,840
Yeah. At the most.

96
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,440
- At the most, six months.
- And then we can

97
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,716
do whatever we want
for the rest of our lives.

98
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,623
Is this even big enough?

99
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,187
Yeah.

100
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,626
Hi. We're here for an adoption.

101
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,637
Okay.

102
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:19,968
The doctor's running behind,

103
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,633
so it'll be a few minutes.

104
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,005
All right, thanks.

105
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,776
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

106
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:27,780
Okay.

107
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:28,803
Thanks.

108
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,878
Do you want to buy that?

109
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,322
My dad drew it.

110
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,886
I live with him because my mom's
a free spirit.

111
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,722
Does it look like me?

112
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,400
Uh, yeah, it does.

113
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,835
I wrote my mom's and dad's
phone numbers on the back

114
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,339
so if someone buys it
and they decide they don't want it,

115
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,136
they can give it back to us.

116
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,270
That's a good idea.

117
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,844
I know,

118
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,714
but no one wanted it.

119
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,378
So many of the other ones
got bought,

120
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,081
but ours is still here.

121
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,316
Well, maybe it's just
no one's cup of tea.

122
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,192
It's my cup of tea.

123
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,754
Oh, you don't have to do that.

124
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,425
No, I want it.

125
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,094
Um, guess I pay for it up front.

126
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,832
Well, take your time.
There's no pressure.

127
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,966
Come on.

128
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,533
He's doing much better
since you brought him in,

129
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,272
but he does have renal failure.

130
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,711
That's what this is for.

131
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,510
When you pull the needle out,

132
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,949
you might see a drop or two of blood.
That's normal.

133
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,683
He gets the sub-cu once a day,

134
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,384
and rotate the pill sequence
on alternating days,

135
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,516
so Monday, Monday,

136
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,526
Thursday,

137
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,221
Friday, Friday, and so on.

138
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,630
Right.

139
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,724
Oh, no.
We can't release him

140
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,064
until this comes off.

141
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,400
He has about a month to go.

142
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,065
You can pick him up on the 26th,

143
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,665
but please don't be late.

144
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,903
We're overcrowded,
and we euthanize.

145
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,434
Take a moment with him.

146
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,845
Okay. Hey.

147
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,282
Hey, we are gonna bring you home

148
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:16,311
and adore you and take care of you
for the rest of your life.

149
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,982
No matter what you do.

150
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,321
Yeah.

151
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,985
Because he could be wild.

152
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,393
You know, we don't
really know for sure.

153
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:27,957
Well, I don't think they would have
taken him if he was wild.

154
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,828
Uh, the woman
that was here before

155
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,535
said that he only had
five or six months left,

156
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,907
so is that including the--

157
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,174
Well, of course, if you take
really good care of him

158
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:44,171
and he bonds with you, he could
easily hang on for years,

159
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,275
but probably no more than five.

160
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,888
They came back,

161
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,484
and they petted me,

162
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:58,429
and I accidentally
made the sound

163
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:03,492
that means I am
cat which is belonging to you.

164
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,636
And upon making the sound,

165
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,168
I felt it to be true.

166
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:18,274
It was a warm type of feeling

167
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:23,345
that would have been unwise
to have outside at night,

168
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,620
but it suddenly seemed

169
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:33,326
that I would not be outside
at night ever again.

170
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,129
It could just be six months.

171
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,600
That's if we do a bad job.

172
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,900
We're not gonna do a bad job.

173
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,735
Well, I have to be able to go
to New York. My parents--

174
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,798
No, one of us always
has to be here now.

175
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,503
So I always have to be home?

176
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,377
What if I don't want to be doing
tech support for five more years?

177
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:52,510
We'll be 40 in 5 years.

178
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,178
Oh. 40 is basically 50,

179
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,485
and then after 50,
the rest is just...

180
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,787
Ioose change.

181
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,884
Loose change?

182
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:06,159
Like not quite enough to get
anything you really want.

183
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,223
Oh, God.

184
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:13,170
So for all practical purposes,
in a month,

185
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,332
that's it for us.

186
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,237
God, I always thought
I'd be smarter.

187
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,081
I also thought
eventually we'd be rich.

188
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,916
I always want
to follow the news,

189
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,151
you know, but then
I'm so far behind,

190
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,217
and now it's just like,
what's the point?

191
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,230
I actually thought I'd end up
being a world leader.

192
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,562
Oh, yeah, that's not gonna happen.

193
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,329
It's too late for us.

194
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,069
At least we have a month.

195
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,345
You know, that's actually a long time
when you think about it.

196
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,874
Like, we thought
we'd have him home today,

197
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,752
but instead we have
a whole month to...

198
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,422
- To what?
- I don't know, but,

199
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,155
I mean, if this is our last month ever,
shouldn't we...

200
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,288
Yeah.

201
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,398
Yeah, right.

202
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,401
I mean, if we were
dying in a month,

203
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,268
we would definitely reprioritize.

204
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,272
Right.

205
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,637
What? It's work.

206
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,740
That was so easy.
Was that easy for you?

207
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,765
Not really.

208
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,368
Yeah, but now
you're free to do your--

209
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,400
I know. I can't wait.

210
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,004
Do you know what
you're gonna do?

211
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,344
No, but that's what's great.

212
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,714
I'm gonna let it choose me.

213
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:09,619
I just have to be alert
and listen for it.

214
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,622
But what if it doesn't--

215
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,317
Shh! I'm listening.

216
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,054
Hey, do you have a moment
to help stop global warming?

217
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,085
No, thank you.

218
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,107
This looks kind of fantastic on me.

219
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,477
You're not environmental.

220
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,845
Yes, I am.

221
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:37,940
Oh, really?

222
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:42,147
So you're, like, into nature
and going outside?

223
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,713
Well, I'm glad the outside's there.

224
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,090
I wouldn't want
there to only be inside.

225
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,790
I mean, besides, it doesn't matter,
you know, what I do.

226
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,766
The point is to be alert
and to notice everything.

227
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,997
I'm gonna pay special attention
if somebody gives me something

228
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,595
or says something to me,

229
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,539
especially if they do it with their hand
on a doorknob.

230
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:03,769
On a--

231
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:04,776
Also coincidences,

232
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,506
um, or, like, mistakes.

233
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,413
Doubles of anything,
flares and glares,

234
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,111
just flashes of light of any kind.

235
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,245
It could come from anywhere.

236
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,917
And what will it be, do you think?

237
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:21,859
I don't know.
Probably something profound.

238
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:26,490
Well, hopefully not so profound
that you forget about me.

239
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,729
I don't see
how that could happen,

240
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:33,568
unless I had some kind
of head injury or...

241
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,906
What if you did get a head injury,
you know, or I did,

242
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:42,812
and we couldn't even
recognize each other?

243
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,146
We could come up with a signal.

244
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,152
No, because if I have amnesia,

245
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,314
then, you know, I would just be, like,

246
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,154
"Who are you?" you know,
and, "What is this signal?

247
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,626
Why are you signaling me?"

248
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,529
it would have to be something
that just cuts through everything.

249
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:08,132
It seems we've stood and talked
Iike this before.

250
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,572
This is the signal?

251
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,042
- We Iooked at each other...
- Yeah.

252
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,308
...in the same way then,

253
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:26,681
but I can't remember where or when.

254
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,117
Hi. Uh, I'm with--

255
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,627
Uh, my--my name
is Jason, and l--

256
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,897
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see your sign.

257
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,268
I think I'm--
I'm a solicitor.

258
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,602
You are?

259
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,471
I mean, I haven't, uh--

260
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,875
You would be my first solicitation.

261
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,380
Or not.

262
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,439
Yeah, we try to stick to that.

263
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,471
Oh, yeah.

264
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,920
Yes?

265
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:46,055
Hi. My name is Jason,
and I'm with Tree by Tree.

266
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,363
Do you have a moment to help
reduce global warming?

267
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:55,505
Um, we're helping to fulfill
the mayor's vision

268
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,135
to plant a million trees
in Los Angeles,

269
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:01,078
and for a small donation,

270
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:06,517
we'll give you a healthy young tree.

271
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:07,951
Thank you.

272
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,988
Do you mind throwing this out?

273
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,051
Sure.

274
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,828
Hi.

275
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,065
What's wrong?

276
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,868
Okay, so the lnternet's

277
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,602
gonna be turned off
in the next hour,

278
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,371
so the second
you get in the door,

279
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,674
you'll want to look up anything
you need to look up.

280
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,738
I'm saving time here
by telling you en route.

281
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,373
Wait. Why is it being shut off?

282
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,508
I had to do it.

283
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,485
It's just for the next 30 days, okay?

284
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,681
Are you noticing these posters?

285
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,986
I'm the only one doing that,
that many.

286
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:19,991
But I need it.

287
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,322
Well, but not really, you know,

288
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,123
'cause we can just go to a cafe.

289
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,096
That's what I'm gonna do
to upload my dances.

290
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,927
Is it still on?

291
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,490
So at any second?
It could just go off at any second?

292
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,661
By 6:00, they said.

293
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,432
We should be looking up useful things,

294
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,201
you know, like flu warnings.

295
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,174
Well, what are you looking up?

296
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,733
I don't know, MapQuest.

297
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,745
- MapQuest? To where?
- I don't know.

298
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:41,905
See, this isn't even safe.

299
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,745
I mean, what if there's an accident
and we have to find something?

300
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:45,750
I thought of that. I thought,

301
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,615
"What if there's something
we really need to know?"

302
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:51,851
and then I thought, well,
we could just ask someone, or...

303
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,556
we could not know.

304
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,824
Christmas falls on a Tuesday this year.

305
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,920
- Don't look that up!
- Well, I don't know.

306
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,794
Look up things that are only online.

307
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,093
Okay, okay.

308
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,883
How long is 30 days?

309
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,554
It was turning out to be
a little bit longer

310
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:34,828
than, say, for example,
the day after tomorrow.

311
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,767
Outside, there was no time, no hours,

312
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,172
just alive or not alive

313
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,005
or bird.

314
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:52,073
Now there was
this new thing, waiting,

315
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:56,819
waiting for them to come get me,

316
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:00,791
waiting for my real life to begin.

317
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,692
I learned to count the seconds.

318
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:11,431
Now, now, now...

319
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,299
Hi, person.

320
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,865
Hi.

321
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,390
Okay. Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.

322
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,395
This is it.

323
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,945
Fuck!

324
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,072
I'm sorry.

325
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,946
I sort of signed up on a whim.

326
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:34,884
Could one of the other people
just cover my area?

327
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,615
What other people?

328
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,919
The other volunteers
going door to door.

329
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,254
There is nobody else.

330
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,624
You're our guy
for face-to-face education.

331
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,528
For all of Los Angeles?

332
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:49,523
We're about to witness
a massive shift in consciousness.

333
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,968
I mean, who knows?
You could be the guy

334
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,265
to bring us over the threshold,

335
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,136
the hundredth monkey.

336
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,606
I'm so jealous, man.

337
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,871
You get to walk
across this entire city

338
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,572
house by house,
all the way to the ocean.

339
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:46,913
You seemed really happy
to have the place to yourself.

340
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,816
How would you know
if I was happy?

341
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:56,483
Your footsteps and your movements
sounded happy.

342
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,120
Well, I wasn't.

343
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,755
I was wondering where you were.

344
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,164
I was actually starting
to get a little worried.

345
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,827
Well, don't be angry at me.

346
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,565
I wasn't trying to hide.

347
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,129
I couldn't make a sound.

348
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,971
I tried to,
and I couldn't make a sound.

349
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,684
You had a good day.

350
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,493
Oh, wow.

351
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,554
You really did have a good day.

352
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:37,000
You're out there having
fulfilling experiences.

353
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,463
What are you reading?

354
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,771
"Hair dryer, $3.00 or best offer."

355
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,910
That woman really
has her shit together.

356
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,011
You can tell she's
just totally "carpe diem."

357
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,282
She's a lonely spinster.

358
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,683
No, that is one tough cookie.

359
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,489
You should get out.

360
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,861
Maybe call Tammy or Sasha.

361
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,729
What would I say to them?

362
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,927
Just hi.

363
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,060
"30 days, 30 dances."

364
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,073
I e-mailed everyone.
They're all waiting for it.

365
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,074
No one cares.

366
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,166
I know.

367
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,242
I'm sure it's not
as bad as you think.

368
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,376
I mean, you still have 28 left.

369
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,262
Hi.

370
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,059
Ah, it's you.

371
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:42,700
I'll turn the water off.

372
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,725
We can go into the house.

373
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:48,773
It's a heavy-duty one,

374
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,331
but I'm getting rid of it,

375
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,366
because in fact
I got a couple others

376
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,345
that are more heavy-duty.
They're professional models.

377
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,439
But it's been
reconditioned and that,

378
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:01,248
and it's worth 1 0 times
what I'm charging you for it.

379
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,119
As far as the wire
with the tape on it,

380
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,816
it had a little cut in the wire,

381
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,621
but I put this piece of tape on there
as a safety measure.

382
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,957
This is the on and off switch,

383
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,293
but you leave it off
until you make up your mind

384
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,992
whether you want heat
or you just want air,

385
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,264
but none of it will work unless you push--
turn it to the on position.

386
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,429
Right, the on.

387
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,200
But these always are
the best on the market.

388
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,331
$3.00.

389
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,604
Portable hair dryer.

390
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,009
I do all kinds of electrical work

391
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,512
around the house and that
and repairing that.

392
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:31,140
That's why I never
have to buy anything.

393
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:34,640
I've re-fixed this VCRr and the stereo
and all that stuff.

394
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,388
As long as you can get it working,
why not get it free?

395
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,914
Oh, there's one more thing,
if you're interested.

396
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,051
It's okay. I think I'm good.

397
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,755
You can always call back
when you're ready.

398
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,843
If you don't start
on the count of three,

399
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,284
that's it. It's over.

400
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,413
You don't talk to me.

401
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,981
You don't know me.

402
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:50,961
You don't ever look
at me again, okay?

403
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,020
You understand?

404
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,725
Yeah.

405
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,636
Here we go. 1...

406
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,538
2...

407
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,108
3.

408
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,629
Hello.

409
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,877
Hi.

410
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:17,211
Um, my name is Sophie.

411
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,239
I bought your--

412
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,617
My boyfriend bought
this drawing that you made

413
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,451
at the animal shelter. I--

414
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,320
Are you calling to return it?

415
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,689
No. No, no.

416
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,591
We like it a lot.

417
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,858
Okay.

418
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,262
So you're calling because...

419
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:39,236
Oh, are you busy?

420
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,568
Well, no, I'm--
I'm working, but l--

421
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,836
Where do you work?

422
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,140
I own a chain of companies
that makes signs and banners

423
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,612
for trade shows
and corporate events.

424
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,080
Oh.

425
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,754
So...

426
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:58,915
it's overcast.

427
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:04,684
I can see a little bit of sun
about to poke out.

428
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:05,696
Yeah.

429
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,357
No, from where I am,

430
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,128
I can see, like, some flat clouds,

431
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,136
and then there's a puffier one,

432
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,606
and the sun is about to come
around the puffy one.

433
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,234
You must be facing
the same direction as me.

434
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,540
I'm facing east.

435
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,206
Oh, yeah, me, too.
I'm facing east, too.

436
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,944
So we're both in Los Angeles,
and we're both facing east.

437
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:26,973
Maybe we're neighbors.

438
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,715
Where do you live?

439
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:32,780
I'm sorry.

440
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,951
You don't have to tell me
where you live.

441
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,290
No, that's all right.

442
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,555
How 'bout this?

443
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,893
How 'bout I'll just
open the window and yell,

444
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,263
and you just see
if you can hear me?

445
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,065
But won't I just hear it
through the phone?

446
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,763
Right.

447
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:54,574
Okay, so let's hang up,
and I'll yell, and if--

448
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:58,139
You call me back, and you tell me
if you can hear me.

449
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,241
If I hear it, I'll just yell back.

450
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,585
That's great.

451
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:04,849
Okay.

452
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,823
Bye.

453
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,356
Hi!

454
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,920
Hey!

455
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,239
Uh, I got this for you.

456
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,142
Ahh, what are you doing?

457
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,984
What was that?

458
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,684
It was a release.

459
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,598
You seem--

460
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,260
Was it a good day?

461
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,700
Yeah.

462
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,603
You--did you
have a good day?

463
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,130
Um, yeah.

464
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,769
You sold a tree?

465
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,108
Yeah.

466
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,509
Oh, let me do that.

467
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,539
It's okay.

468
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,766
Hello.

469
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,028
Hi.

470
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,160
Hi.

471
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,172
I wasn't able to yell
at that exact time.

472
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,605
There was a delay.

473
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,073
Yeah, I didn't hear anything,

474
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,838
but I didn't know if it was
because you didn't--

475
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:33,866
Yeah.

476
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,941
That was a funny conversation.

477
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,040
Yeah.

478
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,619
So what do you do
for a living, Sophie?

479
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,353
I'm a dance teacher

480
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,759
for little kids.

481
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,990
Ah, a dancer.

482
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,658
No, just a teacher.

483
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:00,634
Oh, don't forget your--

484
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:01,797
and your...

485
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,304
I'm not leaving. I--

486
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,108
Am I in a hurry?

487
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,637
What? No.

488
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,682
No, stay, stay, stay.

489
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:28,290
Maybe I should order a tree.
How much are they?

490
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,992
Uh, $1 0.

491
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,699
Do I get a discount for three?

492
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,276
Never mind.

493
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:46,106
Okay, what is
your home address?

494
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:49,449
Right. You know what?

495
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:52,115
I'm gonna do this later, so...

496
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,282
Okay.

497
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,757
Bye.

498
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,267
Hello.

499
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,971
Hi.

500
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,036
I'm sorry to bother you again,

501
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,379
but I wanted to ask,
do you own a factory or...

502
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,410
It's more like a warehouse.

503
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,081
Right now,
I'm in my office at home.

504
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,990
Okay, so if a person needed a sign,

505
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,459
they could get it from you?

506
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,294
These are cards
that I make for my wife

507
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,164
at all the nine different holidays,
like our anniversary

508
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,794
and Fourth of July and Easter
and all them.

509
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,964
And I make her a nice poem
about our everyday life.

510
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,735
Then I make 15 limericks up,

511
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,641
and they're all different.
I never made 'em the same.

512
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:50,374
I've probably got between 500
and 600 of them and that,

513
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,678
so there's quite a few of 'em.

514
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:58,012
"Mrs. Claus, she pranced around
in red sheer lace,

515
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:01,513
"and every move she made
was really in good grace,

516
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,393
"so Santa got sexually aroused
really, really strong,

517
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,660
"and he ended up with
a really nice big dong,

518
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,100
so she removed her nice teddy
and sat on his face."

519
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,263
Wow.

520
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,934
H-how long have
you guys been together?

521
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,944
Well, we've been together since 1 948.

522
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:24,277
That's 62 years, but we've only
been married 60 years.

523
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,681
Do you have a lady friend?

524
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,982
Uh, yeah. We've only been together,
like, four years.

525
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,388
Oh. It can be very hard
in the beginning.

526
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,858
Maybe one of you does
something terrible,

527
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,589
and that might be
the hardest to get used to.

528
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,427
We didn't have those kind of problems
in the beginning.

529
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:46,095
Well, the thing is you're just in the middle
of the beginning right now.

530
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,468
Okay.

531
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,116
Come in.

532
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,750
My office is right back here.

533
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,384
We'll get you all set up.

534
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,361
Can I take your coat?

535
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:15,456
It's, um, kind of part of my outfit.

536
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,924
Okay.

537
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,011
Who is that?

538
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,477
It's a friend.

539
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,544
She has a cold. She's supposed
to be taking a nap.

540
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,613
Can I see her?

541
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,458
Voilà.

542
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,827
Hi.

543
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,422
Hi.

544
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,264
So this is a basic
indoor/outdoor banner.

545
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,734
And of course you can
have any font you want.

546
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,074
You can even bring in your own font,
and we'll use that.

547
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,909
What'd you want it to say?

548
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,943
Yeah, I'm not sure yet.

549
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,450
Okay.

550
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,615
Well, do you have any idea how big
a banner you might want?

551
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,820
Um, not yet.

552
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,965
Okay.

553
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,661
Why don't you start
by filling that out?

554
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:35,403
Dear persons,
I am writing this to you,

555
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,074
a letter with no pencil,

556
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:43,109
so I hope that you are able to read it.

557
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,885
By day, I know I am yours,

558
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:52,385
but when night comes, I am alone

559
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,728
and always have been

560
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:58,997
and always will be wild,

561
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:02,335
so it is only the sun

562
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,638
that returns the wonderful feeling

563
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,009
of being pet again.

564
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,344
Please come soon.

565
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,907
Nights are getting longer.

566
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,852
Yours, Paw Paw.

567
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:25,219
21 days till Paw Paw.

568
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:30,424
So you've done,
what, nine dances?

569
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,503
I wish I was just
one notch prettier.

570
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,407
I'm right on the edge, you know,

571
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:44,904
where it's up to each person
to decide for themselves.

572
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:48,248
I have to make my case
with each new person.

573
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,424
Is that Tammy or Sasha?

574
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,621
Let's not get it.

575
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,322
Let's just not get it.

576
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,232
Hello.

577
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,548
I think we should play the song.

578
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,619
You know, the signal.

579
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,985
Really?

580
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,067
Where's the charger cord?

581
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,038
I don't know.

582
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,700
Uh, I think it's in my car.

583
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,836
Well, do you want to go get it?

584
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,709
Not really.

585
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:53,808
But, you know,
if you do, you should.

586
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,689
Never mind. It's not--

587
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,258
Hold on.

588
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:44,448
Well, I should probably go.

589
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,546
Well, wait a minute,

590
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,784
I have something
I want to give you,

591
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,417
so I'll be right back.

592
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,054
For your cat.

593
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,202
Hi!

594
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:04,661
What's this?

595
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,102
You don't like my chain?

596
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,970
Ah, it's a little sleazy.

597
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:13,602
Good. Then you're receiving
the message.

598
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,134
What's--

599
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,146
It means...

600
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,807
It means I'm ready to fuck.

601
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,550
Oh.

602
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:26,113
Is that, like, a secret message?

603
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,214
Does everyone know that?

604
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:28,224
No.

605
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,816
Some women look at a chain,

606
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,260
and they just see
a guy wearing a chain.

607
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:36,494
Yeah? I think of myself
as one of those women.

608
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:41,260
Can't believe I'm not
one of those women.

609
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,172
Cat's out of the bag.

610
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,609
Are you hungry?

611
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,348
You want a tangerine?

612
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,525
I also have some lemonade.

613
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,905
Something happened today.

614
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,147
To you?

615
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,809
To me, yeah.

616
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:36,687
We have some time,

617
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,821
more than a month.

618
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:43,424
This is really just the beginning.

619
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:47,563
I mean, we have, like,
50 more years together,

620
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:50,630
and it's just gonna get better.

621
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:55,168
This is actually the worst time
we're in right now.

622
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:59,846
It is?

623
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,544
I guess so.

624
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:06,618
You know, we'll do
some terrible things, but--

625
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:16,391
And you know all this...

626
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:19,368
just by being alert?

627
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,633
And noticing everything, yeah.

628
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,367
Why is this here?

629
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:59,534
I don't know.

630
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,134
Me either.

631
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,582
Maybe we don't know everything.

632
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:18,720
I was cleaning the kitchen,

633
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:23,165
and I felt like you were watching me
wipe the counter,

634
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,194
but like--like as if it was fascinating,
you know?

635
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:32,504
Like when a celebrity walks their dog

636
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,635
or buys groceries or something like that.

637
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,305
That's how I felt all day.

638
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,145
And that's good?

639
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,751
Maybe we can work out
an arrangement,

640
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,053
because I'd like to watch you.

641
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,857
Yeah, I think that would
be very boring for you,

642
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:53,294
especially when I sleep.

643
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,797
No, it wouldn't.

644
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:58,824
It would make me very happy
to watch you all the time.

645
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,161
You'd like that?

646
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,167
Well...

647
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:10,306
I mean, if it was really all the time,

648
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:15,307
then I wouldn't have to do anything ever.

649
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,484
I wouldn't have to try.

650
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,993
I had you totally wrong.

651
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:25,688
I thought you were more...

652
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:26,696
What?

653
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,061
I don't know.

654
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,123
Independent.

655
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,765
Yeah.

656
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,795
Well...

657
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,798
I mean, now that this has happened,
what are my options?

658
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:44,212
Well, traditionally

659
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:48,115
people either tell the truth,
or they lie.

660
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,949
Oh, yeah, I could never...

661
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,013
do that.

662
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:56,924
Jason and I are really close.

663
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,929
I could never do
either of those things.

664
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,952
Hey, your heart, it's racing.

665
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:29,959
I have to tell you something.

666
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,119
What?

667
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,090
I have to tell you something.

668
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,759
What?

669
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,664
Okay.

670
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,974
One thing...

671
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,341
is--

672
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,248
One thing is that I'm wild.

673
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,519
O-okay.

674
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,355
No.

675
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,384
It's not okay.

676
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,898
When I tell you, l--

677
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:18,640
Don't blame him,
because it's me.

678
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,041
Him, who?

679
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,246
Marshall.

680
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:27,107
Who?

681
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,982
But we don't know him.

682
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,195
You look so weird.

683
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,002
If you could see your face, you'd laugh.

684
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,209
I'll leave in the morning.

685
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,276
Hold on.
Just hold on for a sec.

686
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,345
Okay. All right.

687
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:10,519
I don't know what's going on
right now, but, um,

688
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,461
okay, if you're gonna say
something really bad,

689
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,294
could you just wait a moment?

690
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,427
I just need a moment, okay?

691
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:22,529
Just give me one moment
before you say what you're saying.

692
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,506
I just want you to kno--

693
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,234
That's enough.
You're free.

694
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:56,569
Go. Hang out with Gabi.

695
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,918
Act naturally.

696
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,257
Wave.

697
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,058
What am I doing?

698
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:32,203
You're trying to get to China?

699
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,209
What?

700
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:34,767
You're like--
You know, when you--

701
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:36,472
I think that might be racist.

702
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:37,946
Don't move.

703
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,311
Is it a bee?

704
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:46,550
The way you look in the light
is perfect.

705
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,986
I like these sheets.

706
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,215
They're 1,000 thread count.

707
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,558
What happens now?

708
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,533
Now we have sex,

709
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,302
and you eat ice cream.

710
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:39,434
You watch TV, and I watch you.

711
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,877
Wait. Is there really ice cream?

712
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:25,650
So, here we are.

713
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:32,558
What's your plan
for the long run?

714
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:38,933
I think I can just switch back again
when this one gets tired.

715
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:42,870
But you can't just keep
switching hands forever.

716
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,857
What are you doing?

717
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,929
Sorry.

718
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,492
I forgot something.

719
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,060
What?

720
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:16,732
It's nothing.

721
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:36,320
Everything would be perfect there,

722
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,657
Iike a dream,

723
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:44,190
but not a dream,
because I would never wake up,

724
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:51,231
and soon I would not even be able
to remember my old life.

725
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:02,907
Do you think if I moved my hand,
it would be morning by now?

726
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:05,580
- Morning?
- lt'd be Friday.

727
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,817
What?

728
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:10,291
It's been 3:1 4 for days now.

729
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,453
But if I moved my hand,

730
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,986
we'd just start from here, right? Um...

731
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,461
I move my hand, and she sits up,

732
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:20,799
and we just finish talking.

733
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:23,135
No, it'd be Friday.

734
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,432
Then she's gone!

735
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,205
I move my hand, and she's gone!

736
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,303
But she--she's fucking!

737
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,507
I move my hand,
she's fucking him.

738
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,077
But maybe not.

739
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,644
It could be okay.

740
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:41,987
You don't know
what will happen at 3:15.

741
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:45,688
Yes, I do. I know exactly
what will happen at 3:15.

742
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:52,624
At 3:15, we aren't going
to get back in bed together,

743
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:55,968
and she isn't gonna wrap
her legs around my legs,

744
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,870
and we aren't gonna fall asleep.

745
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:00,068
And then in the morning,

746
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,703
she isn't gonna say, "Hi, person,"

747
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:05,373
and then we aren't
gonna have another day,

748
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:08,384
just an ordinary, boring day.

749
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,716
And then we aren't gonna have kids,

750
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:13,722
and then we aren't
gonna grow old together.

751
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:16,725
And we aren't gonna
look back on our lives,

752
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:20,217
because we aren't even
gonna know each other.

753
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,697
That is what is gonna happen at 3:1 5.

754
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,396
You don't know for sure, though.

755
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,698
It could work out in the end.

756
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,227
Yeah, or not.

757
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:30,239
Or not.

758
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:32,639
Well, I couldn't bear it.

759
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,404
But you could.

760
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,512
Mom says you're picking me up.

761
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:43,778
You got your backpack?

762
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,549
It's in the car.

763
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,585
I usually get home by 5:30 or 6:00.

764
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:53,493
- Open, please!
- Oh.

765
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,862
When do you get home?

766
00:58:55,899 --> 00:59:00,802
Um, around the same time,
5:30 or 6:00,

767
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,135
maybe 4:00.

768
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,172
Bye.

769
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:06,931
Bye.

770
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:02,262
I can tell you right now

771
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:04,732
they won't be needing anyone
for at least six months.

772
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,668
Really?
I--I can do Frisky Feet.

773
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,365
Frisky Feet is covered.

774
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,032
They have a new girl now.

775
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,133
She was in Circus de Soleil.

776
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:15,644
She can walk on her thumbs.

777
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,612
- Oh.
- Yeah.

778
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:20,474
Okay.

779
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:23,314
There is one opening.

780
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:32,989
Tammy.

781
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,327
Hey. And Sasha.

782
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:38,630
Wow.

783
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:39,862
You're pregnant.

784
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:41,802
We both are.

785
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:45,865
But h-how did it happen so quickly?

786
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:48,206
Well it's been a while
since we've seen you.

787
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:49,871
Yeah, I know.

788
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,039
I keep meaning to--

789
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:54,413
It's only been
a few weeks, though.

790
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,077
How does it feel?

791
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:03,183
It's a drag, but it's also amazing.

792
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:04,921
That's exactly it.

793
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:09,062
I--I thought you were--

794
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,692
Barry and Carrie,
this is Sophie.

795
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:12,996
Hi.

796
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,867
- Hi.
- Hi.

797
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,701
So you're still working here?

798
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,435
Yeah. Um...

799
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:23,206
but I work up here now, yeah,

800
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,714
which is kind of a drag.

801
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:28,273
It's a drag, but it's amazing?

802
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:29,875
Not really.

803
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:35,321
Wh-where are your mothers?

804
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,918
Oh, well, they passed away
a few years ago.

805
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,554
I--I guess you kind of
lost touch with them.

806
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:42,621
Anyway, we're here to enroll

807
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:44,758
our daughter Jayleen
in pre-ballet.

808
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,701
Okay.

809
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,666
If you could just fill out

810
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,675
the top part of this form.

811
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,698
Sure.

812
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,245
You're so tired,

813
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:05,084
and your arm is so heavy.

814
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,783
Just put it down.

815
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:31,176
If it's gonna work out,

816
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:33,273
could you just give me
a little indication,

817
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:34,305
Iike some sort of signal?

818
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:36,181
I don't know anything.

819
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,847
I'm just a rock in the sky.

820
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:29,000
O-okay.

821
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:31,700
Let's go.

822
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,641
Start it up.

823
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:34,938
Me?

824
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,343
I was waiting for you to do it.

825
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:49,518
Wait. So this is it?
It's just this from now on?

826
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,390
I guess so.

827
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:53,622
Well, what about--

828
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,028
What about--

829
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,632
Did this day already happen?

830
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,144
That day would be today,

831
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,043
but it's almost over.

832
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:42,737
I can't believe you can't do this.

833
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:46,043
You do the seasons,
day and night, the tides!

834
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:52,648
I know, but the ocean's so big,
and I'm so far away.

835
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,424
I could use a little help.

836
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,889
Beautiful day, isn't it?

837
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,258
Yeah.

838
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,354
A beautiful day

839
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:37,093
A beautiful girl

840
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,533
Come into my arms

841
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,399
Come into my life

842
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,405
You light up my days

843
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,907
You heat up my nights

844
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,911
You make my world

845
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:54,281
More than all right

846
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:57,619
Wow.

847
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,585
All original lyrics.

848
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:03,549
I didn't know you sang.

849
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:06,288
You bring out that side in me.

850
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,627
I don't know.

851
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,962
Do you believe in soul mates?

852
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:58,606
Stop!

853
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,377
Okay, kiddo.

854
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,079
Flashlight or no flashlight?

855
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,554
No flashlight.

856
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,557
Sweet dreams.

857
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,028
What? She can't sleep in there.

858
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:15,030
Yes, I can.

859
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,224
She can get out.

860
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:19,063
But it's cold.

861
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,126
What about when you have to pee?

862
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,695
I'll pee in here, like a soldier.

863
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:24,865
She's okay.

864
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,235
Okay, just come in
when you get sick of it.

865
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:33,044
Please, go.

866
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:03,831
Is it too hot?

867
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:13,412
Can I have the drawing back?

868
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:16,742
Of me.

869
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:19,913
It's--

870
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,355
It's where I used to live.

871
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:24,416
Oh.

872
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:26,257
That guy has it.

873
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,730
I'm his cup of tea.

874
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,498
He said that?

875
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:23,485
In the moment before it happened,

876
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:27,325
I kept thinking, "But I'm theirs.

877
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:29,557
I belong to them."

878
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:32,899
And then it happened.

879
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:34,596
I died.

880
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,126
Really.

881
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:42,402
But even dead, I stayed in my cage,

882
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:46,141
because I just couldn't believe it.

883
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:49,639
I wasn't done waiting for them.

884
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:52,950
Just let me wait forever,

885
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:57,049
knowing they will one day come.

886
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:58,889
But that was our cat.

887
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:00,690
He was already ours.

888
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:03,698
I'm sorry.
We even waited an extra day.

889
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:06,064
I just told your husband all this.

890
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:58,719
Yeah?

891
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:01,245
Hi. My name's Jason,
and I'm with Tree by Tree.

892
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:03,121
Do you have a moment
to help reduce--

893
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:04,819
Yeah, I'm not interested.

894
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:09,287
That's all right.

895
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:13,791
I mean, it's probably too late
for all this anyway.

896
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:15,200
What?

897
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,831
Well, you know how--

898
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,841
how like in the cartoons,

899
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:22,844
when the building gets hit
with the wrecking ball,

900
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:24,937
right before the building falls down,

901
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:29,747
there's always like this moment
where it's perfectly still,

902
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,253
right before it collapses?

903
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:34,778
We're in that moment.

904
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:40,762
The wrecking ball
has already hit all of this,

905
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:44,960
and this is just the moment
before it all falls down.

906
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:48,162
Is that the official word?

907
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:51,969
No, that's just my gut feeling.

908
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:54,833
So why are you going around, then?

909
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:07,350
I thought this was great, all this...

910
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:13,056
uh, the air and the grass, yeah,

911
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:16,064
but it was just the people
and the houses

912
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:19,727
and the cars and the TV
and the music.

913
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:23,067
I mean, I just--
I love this place.

914
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:27,302
I'm sorry. What are you...

915
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:29,139
We're selling trees.

916
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:30,769
That's okay.

917
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:32,040
No--no, thanks.

918
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:09,640
Where does he live?

919
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,244
Tarzana.

920
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:17,816
Where is that again?

921
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:20,117
It's in the Valley.

922
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:26,291
All my stuff's in my car, though.

923
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:29,019
Okay.

924
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:38,968
Everything must look
so familiar to you, hmm?

925
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:45,503
You must feel like you're coming back
to the place that you left.

926
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:47,071
That must be nice.

927
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:54,011
But it's gone, by the way.

928
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:58,725
This is a totally new land now.

929
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,154
Okay.

930
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:03,528
Okay what?

931
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:04,862
You can't agree to anything,

932
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,663
because I haven't proposed anything.

933
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:09,397
My whole point is that there
is nothing here

934
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:10,529
for you to come back to,

935
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:12,005
if that's what you're doing.

936
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,498
There's just--
there's nothing.

937
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,308
Okay, I know.

938
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:20,871
I'm saying okay to nothing.

939
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:53,536
I went back for him.

940
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:56,567
I know. I did, too.

941
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:58,670
We were too late.

942
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,622
Just one night...

943
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:15,059
and then in the morning, you go.

944
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:32,106
After a long time,

945
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:35,605
a long, long time,

946
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,312
I give up.

947
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:41,686
Not waiting anymore.

948
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:44,351
As it turns out,

949
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:48,624
Iiving is just the beginning,

950
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:54,101
and so the beginning is over.

951
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:57,627
I'm cat of nobody.

952
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:00,505
I'm not even cat.

953
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:03,067
I'm not even l.

954
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:07,343
It's warm. It's light.

955
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:14,151
It goes on and on
and on and on...

956
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:54,991
It seems we stood and talked

957
01:23:55,030 --> 01:24:00,559
Iike this before.

958
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:03,469
We Iooked at each other

959
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:06,599
in the same way then,

960
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:12,069
but I can't remember where

961
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:18,018
or when.

962
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:24,119
The clothes you're wearing

963
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:29,825
are the clothes you wore.

964
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:34,632
The smile you are smiling

965
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:37,365
you were smiling then,

966
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:42,274
but I can't remember where

967
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:47,543
or when.

968
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:54,849
Some things that happened

969
01:24:54,889 --> 01:25:01,818
for the first time

970
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:07,267
seem to be happening

971
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:12,433
again.

972
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:19,311
And so it seems

973
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:25,308
that we've met before

974
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:31,155
and Iaughed before

975
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:37,222
and Ioved before.

976
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:41,725
But who knows

977
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:44,704
where

978
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:50,769
or when?
