Wake up. Wake up.

00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,700
Okay, don't worry about it,
I'm gonna get you out in a jiffy.

Got you! Okay, body you're free.

00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,700
Now escape, go! Just go, cry freedom.

- You almost gave me a heart attack!
- Lenny, what are you doing?

12
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,300

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,500
Hey, mom said it's not okay to hit me!

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,400
Mom's not here.

16
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,000
Don't. Don't!

17
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,000
What do you mean?
It's a theme song.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,100
Are they gone? Are they gone?

19
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,300
You're sure?

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,700

95
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,200

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,600

Whale for a wash and the price,

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,400
Oh my gosh.

101
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,800
Oh, may I suggest a monic peel?

102
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,500
Removes lines and self damage.

103
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,300
- Good.

104
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,700
Oh my gosh! Hi Oscar!

Hey, thanks for covering for me.

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,500
Yo, I'm sorry dog, Angie

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,300

108
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,800
- Thanks, dog.

109
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,600
Come on Ange, dance with me, mama!

- Let me see it!

111
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,500
- Come on, Ange!
- Oscar! You're gonna get me fired!

112
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,900
Please. You? Fired?

113
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,200
No, that can't happen, cause then I would have

114
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,900
absolutely no reason to come to work.

115
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,200
- You don't mean that.
- Of course I do. You're like my best friend.

116
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,600
Let me see, tell me what
you think about this,

117
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,500
this is like the best idea ever, allright?

118
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,700
This is a short thing guarantee
cash extravaganza.

119
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,200
- Bottled water.
- Oh, no.

120
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,400
All I need, is another advance
of my paycheck from deposite,

121
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,200
and Ange, I am out of this place!

122
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,500
Oscar, it's relegating mister Sykes face,

123
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,600
with another one you-get-rich-quick-skims.

124
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,000
Go to something you're actually good at.

125
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,300
Your job! Which is some of
a miracle you still have!

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,100
Almost forgot.

127
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,400
- I brought you some breakfast.
- You didn't.

128
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,500
- Shelly creams?
- Your favourite!

129
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,100
Oh, by the way, you're still on hold.

130
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,600
Oh my gosh! Thank you for holding!

131
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,300
Busy busy busy! Go!

132
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,200
How can I help you?

133
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,000
No, I'm sorrry, mister Sykes
is at the meeting right now.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,300
He won't be'll back till later.

135
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,200
How are my little babies this morning?

136
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,500
You missed me? You're doing good?

137
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,600
You see, Sykes. It's a fish eat fish world.

138
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,900
You eat the take, or you get taken.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,400
True words have never been spoken.

140
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,700
Is that it? That all? We're done?

141
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,200
Now you and me, we've worked
together a long, long, long time.

142
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,700
- Please, Don Lino, it's hardly been like worked!
- Let me finish.

143
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,400
- And you know...
- And I love that about you!

144
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,700
Let me finish! That I'd lived my life for my sons.

145
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,100
- Raising them and protecting them,
- You're the best! He's the best, right?!

146
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,300
- Teaching them.
- Am I right or am I wrong?

147
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,500
- Ha? Am I right?
- Sykes, it's all been to pre...

148
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,400
- Right?
- To prepared.

149
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,500
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

150
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,500
For the day they run the reef.

151
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,300
Well, today is that day.

152
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,600
Luca!

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,100
Hey boss! Big butts!

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,200
Allright, to make long story short, from now on,

155
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,300
you work for Franki and Lenny, capish?

156
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,900
Lenny? Franki I understand, but Lenny?

157
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,900
- You can't be serious.
- That's serious.

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It takes not only muscle to run things,

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,700
now Lenny, he's got the brains,
that's something special.

160
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,300
- Oh yeah, he's special.
- What's that supossed to mean?

161
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,300
- Nothing, nothing, I'm just saying.
- I bring you in here, look you in the eye

162
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,400
tell you what's what and what?
- What?

163
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
- What what?
- What what nothing!

164
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,200
- You said what first!
- I did say what first, I asked you what.

165
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,300
No, you said it then what, and I said what?

166
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,600
No, I said what what! Like what what!

167
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,000
- You said what first.
- Now you make a fun of me?!

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
No, no, no, you misunderstood,
you misunderstood.

169
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,500
Sorry, we're late, pap.
Lenny had an accident.

170
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,300
- He was born!
- He, he, he. You're comic genious!

171
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,300
Look, all I'm saying is
that kid ain't exactly no killer!

172
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
My Lenny is a killer, you hear me?

173
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,500
A cold blooded killer! Look at him!

174
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah?

175
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,700
That's it! That's it! You are out!

176
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,400
What?

177
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,900
- What do you mean I'm out?
- You're fired!

178
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,500
And on top of that, you're gonna
have to start paying me!

179
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,000
- For what?
- So not have us to that

180
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,800
little whale wash of yours!

181
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,000
WHALE.

182
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,200
Welcome to Oscar's crib.

183
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,800
Sixty foot slide covered tomb.

184
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,700
There's swimming casualties and plankton

185
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,800
across the deep, when you feel a little...

186
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,600
old school.

187
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,200
Oh stop your moaning, Oscar!

188
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,800
That could be a lot worse, you know?

189
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Yeah, that's true. I can have
this job and look like you!

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,500
Who's behind me? Who's behind me!
Babe, give me some!

191
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,200
Indigestion.

192
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,000
She's gonna blow!

193
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,300
Wait! Headphone guy's still in there!

194
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,100
I get you! Hang on!

195
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,900
- Still think it could be worse?
- Yeah! I can look like you!

196
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,600
You're funny. We'll see
how you laugh at this!

197
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,500
Soap in the eye! Soap in the eye!

198
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
It's all right. It's all right. Look,

199
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,300
I'm gonna get you some cool pies,
we'll get you free hot wax

200
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,600
and all that, you like that?

201
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,800
- Allright, go at it, big baby.
- Thanks, Oscar.

202
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,900
All right.

203
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,600
- Ernie look, who's burning!
- Just the fish we were looking for!

204
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,500
- Yeah.
- The boss wants to see you right now!

205
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,800
- Right now!
- Ernie! Bernie!

206
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,300
My jelly fish brothers, voodoo!

207
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,500
Hey what's up, men?
Ah men, good to see you!

208
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,900
Fellows, I'm gonna ahead,

209
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,700
over there with Don Worby.

210
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
That's not the way
you sing that song, man!

211
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,700
Hey Sykes! My brother from another mother!

212
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,200
What's the day is it, baby?

213
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,000
What's going down?

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,200
Hey baby, this is all gravy today, allright

215
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,900
snap you fin, right on it. Snap it!

216
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,400
- You are not snapping it!
- Oscar!

217
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Hey, don't sweat it, Sykes,
a lot of other fish can do it.

218
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,800
Oscar, would you just sit down, okay?

219
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,200
- Thank you!
- Look, I've been gone off for my markets.

220
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Your owe to me is five grand! Five gees, okay?

221
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,700
- Five gees? Man, it's not five gees!
- See if this refreshes your memory!

222
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,100
Wow! That's crazy! Look at that!

223
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,500
You wrote everything down
so you wouldn't forget!

224
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,100
Wow! This is a perfect example why you're

225
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,800
in management and I'm not. You go boy.

226
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Look, I have to start paying
Don Lino for protection,

227
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,700
so everything you owe me, you owe him!
- How did you figured that?

228
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,600
It's simple. The food chain.

229
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,000
You see, on top there's Don Lino. There's me.

230
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,700
- And there's regular fish.
- And there's me!

231
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,700
No, there's plankton, there's single celominas.

232
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,400
- Then there's me.
- I'm getting to that, there's coral.

233
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,000
There's rocks. There's whale poo.

234
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,200
And then there's you!

235
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,500
- There's my stuff.
- So after he's squeezing me,

236
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,400
he's squeezing you!
- What?

237
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,500
Wow! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

238
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,500
- Easy boss, find your happy place.
- Happy place!

239
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,200
There's is no happy place with him around!

240
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,600
Okay, okay, okay. Please,
please just give some time,

241
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,700
that's all I'm asking!
I'm begging you, Sykes, please!

242
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,200
- Please!
- All right.

243
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Cause I like you. I'm gonna give you
twenty-four hours to pay out.

244
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
All of it?

245
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,300
- How will I do that?
- That's your problem.

246
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,300
Bring my five thousand clams

247
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
tomorrow, or else...
- Or else what?

248
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,200
The boys will explain you.

249
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,900
Unpleasant!

250
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,800
Five thousand clams?!

251
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,000
You borrowed five thousand
clams from mister Sykes?

252
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,000
Oscar, why do you get yourself
into these situations?

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,400
I don't know, Ange,
it's just hard, allright?

254
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,500
Because I'm a little fish
in a big pot. A really big pot.

255
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,000
The ocean.

256
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,900
I'm nobody.

257
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,100
- I want some of that!
- Missis Sanches?

258
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,700
Uh, no. That.

259
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,400
The top of the reef. Where
the somebodies live.

260
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,700
I wanna be rich and famous like them!

261
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:47,200
- But I'm stuck down here.
- Well, what's wrong with down here?

262
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
I'll tell you what's wrong with down here.

263
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,600
Remember my dad? He worked
at the washes the whole life.

264
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,400
He was the number one tongue scrubber.

265
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,000
Every year for twenty-five years.

266
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,700
To me working at the wash

267
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,200
was the coolest job in the ocean.

268
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,900
But then I've learned something
I would never forget.

269
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,100
Ha, ha! Oscar dad's the tongue scruber!

270
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,300
Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!

271
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,200
My dad was the greatest.

272
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But nobody loves nobody.

273
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,100
- I wanna be a somebody!
- Oscar, you don't have

274
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,900
to live at the top of the reef
to be a somebody.

275
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What's the difference, if I don't pay
mister Sykes' beg by tomorrow.

276
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
I'm dead anyway.

277
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
Wait here.

278
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,900
What's this?

279
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,200
- A pink pearl?
- Hm.

280
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,600
- Where did you get that?
- My grandmother gave it to me.

281
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,900
She said it started from a tiny grand of sand,

282
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,000
but then after a while,

283
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,800
it grew in something beautiful.

284
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,000
- Dreams can begin small too.
- No, I couldn't.

285
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Take it! It'll get you the money
you need for mister Sykes.

286
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,400
What's new on the stand? I'd been
on all over this a thousand times,

287
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,600
I don't wanna to say it again.

288
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,100
You know, you've really given
me actually, you know that?

289
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,800
I don't know how else
to say this to you, Lenny.

290
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
You see something, you kill it
and you eat it. Period.

291
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,800
Thanks. That's what sharks do!

292
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,200
That's a fine tradition.
What's the matter with you?

293
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Your brother Franki here, he's a killer.

294
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
- Right, pap.
- He's beautiful,

295
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,400
he does what he's supposed
to do! Wipe your face.

296
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,900
But you...

297
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,200
I'm hearing things...

298
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,700
You gotta understand,
when you look week,

299
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,800
it make me look week.
- I know, pap.

300
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,200
- I'm sorry.
- Lenny, Lenny, look at me.

301
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,500
Look at me!

302
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,200
This ain't nobody's business,
this is for you! It's for both of you!

303
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And you're acting like
you don't even want it!

304
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,900
I need to know that you can handle that.

305
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,600
Right here in front of me now, eat this.

306
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,700
Yeah, oh Jee! Thanks pap.

307
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,600
Here's the thing. I'm on a diet,

308
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,800
and I've read an article about these
shrimps, they are not good for you,

309
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,200
you know how many calories are in one shrimp?

310
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,300
- A lot!
- It's true! It's true,

311
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
and the other thing is,

312
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,700
my sister had a baby and I took her baby,

313
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,800
cause she past away, and then the baby lost it's legs,

314
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,300
and it's all I wasn't suppose I gonna stop,

315
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,500
but I still take care of him with my wife.

316
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,600
It's crawling and it's fearly
happy, it's difficult, cause

317
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,100
I've been working on a
second shift at the factory,

318
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,000
there put food on the table, all the love

319
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and I see that little guy's tears,
it's the worst in the world.

320
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,500
Front story.

321
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,500
I'm not asking you anymore, I'm telling you,

322
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,800
eat it!
- No! Have mercy!

323
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,300
- Pap, please!
- Eat!

324
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,500
- Don't eat!
- What are you...

325
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,900
- Son, eat...
- No!

326
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,200
the shrimp!
- Please!

327
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,900
- No, please, no!
- Lenny! Eat! Eat, eat, eat!

328
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,000
- Eat, eat, eat, eat!
- Put the shrimp down!

329
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,300
All right, go now. No one's
looking. Get out of here!

330
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,700
- You're free. Go on, go, go!
- Thank you. You're good person.

331
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,700
Come on, fellows!

332
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,400
- Papa, why can't I handle the reef?
- No! No! We're gonna do this as a family.

333
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Franki, I want you to take Lenny
out, and show him the rules.

334
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,400
- Oh come on, pap.
- Son you're gonna learn how to be a shark!

335
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,200
Will you like it or not.

336
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,100
- That kid better show up, or he's dead meat!
- Yes, at a word, boss.

337
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,400
Get a whole load of the money,
give it to mister Sykes.

338
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,700
Come on, hurry up, hurry up!

339
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,100
- This is our chance, you don't wanna miss it!
- Are you sure about this?

340
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
A friend of friend of mine tipped me off!

341
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,700
- Race is rigged. We can't lose!
- Well what's the horses name?

342
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,700
Lucky day.

343
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,600
LUCKY DAY
SEABISCUIT

344
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,700
- We're gonna be rich. Rich!
- Top of the reef, here I come!

345
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,000
No, wait! What am I doing?

346
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,800
Remember what Angie said,
remember what Angie said.

347
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,600
What did Angie say?

348
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,600
Dreams can begin small,
you just have to bet it all!

349
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,100
Bet it all!

350
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,500
Five thousand on Lucky day to win!

351
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,800
That's two hundred a one!

352
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:33,900
- That would pay a million clams!
- Than I guess it makes me, Oscar la millionaire.

353
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,600
Lucky day! Lucky day! Lucky day!

354
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,700
Nice bet.

355
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,000
You have a name?

356
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,300
You wanna tell me what it is?

357
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,200
Well mine's Lola.

358
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,500
Come on man! Get it handled yourself!

359
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,900
So...

360
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,100
Lola, my name's O...

361
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,900
My name is Oscar, sweety.

362
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,300
- Missis Sanches!
- I hate when it hops,

363
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,000
smooth dog, don't work with me!

364
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,200
- No, my bad. Hey! So...
- Oscar!

365
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,300
I was starting to think
you skipped on on me.

366
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,700
Sykes! Hey! I see you...

367
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,400
already to your way to the cashier stand.

368
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,300
- What are doing?
- You mind bring us back some drinks?

369
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,000
- Why are you touching me?
- That'll be great man, thanks.

370
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,300
Oh I know, I'll bring back

371
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,000
some of little winner thing!
- You mean the one with the toothpicks?

372
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,700
- What are doing? Don't listen to him!
- Come on Lola, let me escort you to...

373
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,200
my box.
- Your box?

374
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,100
His box? You can't even afford
the gum to the seats!

375
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,600
He just laid five grand on Lucky day,
I think he can afford

376
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,000
anything he wants!

377
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,100
Five grand? My five grand?

378
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,200
- No, it was another five grand.
- You had the money to pay me back

379
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,800
and you bet it anyway?
- Hold on.

380
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,000
- Give me that!
- Sykes!

381
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,200
- Clearly I've made a mistake.
- No! No, wait! Lola!

382
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,400
Look, deep down, I'm really superficial.

383
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,200
And don't get me wrong, you're cute, but

384
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,100
you are a nobody.

385
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,400
Oscar, you're cute, but you are a nobody.

386
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,800
Wait Lola! Come back! I'm not a nobody!

387
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,700
I'm a winner!

388
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,200
You are unbelievable, you're
in trouble up to your gilles,

389
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,800
and still, you're asking for more?

390
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,000
Now go on, get in here!
Oscar, you better pray

391
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
that this horse of yours comes through.

392
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,000
You bet my five thousand!

393
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,000
Hey! Hey! Hey! Out of my seat!
You, out of my seat!

394
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,100
Unbelievable! Unbelievable!

395
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,100
- Sit tight and watch the race.
- With your good eye!

396
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
Horses are ready on the post.

397
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,200
Race is going special by
Seabiscuit and some of other!

398
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,900
The long shoulder Lucky day appears
of having trouble of getting

399
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,200
out of the gates.
- What?

400
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,900
Only a sucker could have bet on him!

401
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,300
No, no, no, don't sweat it man,
he does this all the time,

402
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,700
he just blam.
- Oh, what's this?

403
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,600
Lucky day has crossed his way through the gates!

404
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,900
And he's off for running!

405
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,400
That was straight away
Seabiscuit forcing on Lucky day!

406
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,500
Fast! Go fast!

407
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,100
Coming round the fall tone the Seabiscuit riding,

408
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,300
and Lucky day well behind the pack.

409
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,400
And in comes Lucky day!
Coming up from behind!

410
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,600
He's passing other tales! Now or never!

411
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
Sykes, you see? Who's your fish now?

412
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,700
Around the final turn here comes Lucky day!

413
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,300
Lucky day is now calling the Fishfingers!

414
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,600
He gets ahead.

415
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,200
Wait, I'm getting tired, just beg him up!

416
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,500
Look how Lucky day goes!

417
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,900
Absolutely amazing!

418
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,500
This is Lucky day's big day!

419
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,000
That's Lucky day!

420
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,500
What happened!
Lucky day is down!

421
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,100
No!!!

422
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,200
And here comes Fishfingers
followed by Seabiscuit yellow tail.

423
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,700
Fishfingers wins!

424
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,400
- What is it?
- Wait, wait, wait I just wanted to hold you!

425
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,400
Get out of my way, let me see!

426
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,000
Poor sad day for Lucky day!

427
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,300
And that's why they call him the low shot.

428
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,000
Yo, that was crazy, right?

429
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
Who knew? I mean everything's set,

430
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,200
there's a luck, we're good to go, we're in the money,

431
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,300
and he trips underwater. Who in a hell

432
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,200
trips underwater? And by the way...

433
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,200
That's it! That's it, I've had it.

434
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,400
Ernie, Bernie, I want you to find
the deepest, darkest hole in the ocean,

435
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,900
and when you do, dig deeper,
and put him in it!

436
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,300
Sorry kid, it's nothing personal. It's just business.

437
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,700
Don't worry about a day,

438
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,800
cause every little thing is gonna be all right!

439
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
- This is how you sing it, Oscar.
- Yeah.

440
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,000
Sykes, you like your money.
I set ticket easy on you.

441
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,200
- But Sykes is not here!
- True.

442
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,800
- Ernie, let me ask you a question.
- Yeah man, go on.

443
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,700
Why is it that millacscan sting on a people?

444
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,600
But they have no affect on you.

445
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,800
Ernie, I didn't mean it Ernie!
I didn't mean it man!

446
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,000
Ernie! You made a joke!

447
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,100
- Good one man! Respect!
- Respect.

448
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,600
Load fire!

449
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,100
- Franki, you know I can't do this!
- Lenny, if you wanna make pap happy,

450
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,500
you gotta kill something!
- Or I could find a very old sick fish

451
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,900
and just wait!
- Oh.

452
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,000
This getting around, you think
of the day in the restaurant,

453
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
you know how fish pop!

454
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,300
Bit of bit, bit of bob,
this that the other, then

455
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,700
how you're doing? Boom!
Get a body here. Dead

456
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,000
Okay, seriously I can't
understand why this is so

457
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,000
you have to be more specific.
- More specific? You want specific?

458
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,600
- Be a shark, for once in your life!
- Oh, what am I gonna do?

459
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,700
Lenny, forget about it, okay?
We do a couple of practice,

460
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,200
but a bim, but a bom,
pap's happy, you're a shark,

461
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,900
life goes on! Capish?
- Okay.

462
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,100
- Okay, capish.
- Wait, wait, wait. Bingo.

463
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,400
Right there, there you see? TV dinner.

464
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,500
- Don't get lousy on this.
- All right. Come on. I am the tiger.

465
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,900
Franki, I can do this!
What if I can't do this?

466
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,400
- Then don't bother coming home.
- Good point! All right.

467
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,100
Hit him in the tale again.

468
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,900
- I like his funny face, man.
- Funny face, yeah.

469
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,200
- Ernie!
- No!

470
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,900
Guys! Guys! Don't leave me alone!
Come on, there could be a shark out here!

471
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,900
Oh no, wait!

472
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,500
I'm sorry, no, no, no. I'm not gonna...

473
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,600
- Lenny!
- What?

474
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,800
Like this!

475
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,000
Oh my god! Just get off me!
Wait a minute!

476
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,400
Do me a favor, don't chew me,
I'm not for that.

477
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,100
- I'm not gonna eat you.
- Don't do the whole hit trip thing with me!

478
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,100
Listen to me, don't move until I tell you!

479
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,700
That's it, Lenny, here you go, body!

480
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,900
That's it, dig straight, baby. Dig it!

481
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,500
Look, I'm just pretending,
so you can get away.

482
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,700
When I turn around, you take off!

483
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,900
Tastes like chicken! Mhh.

484
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,100
- Oh no. No.
- What did I tell you!

485
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,900
I'm sorry, I didn't get it,
you want me to go now?

486
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,200
- What are you doing, just come home!
- That's it, I've had it up to here!

487
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,400
- Oh no!
- Hurry, swim!

488
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,500
- No, Franki wait!
- No, get your boy! Get your boy!

489
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,700
Franki!

490
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,500
Lenny,

491
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,800
- Lenny, is that you?
- I'm here, Franki.

492
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,200
- Come closer.
- Yes, what is it?

493
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,200
- I'm so cold.
- That's just because we're cold blooded.

494
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,600
Moron!

495
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,300
Franki, no!

496
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,800
No!!!

497
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
This is all my fault! I'm so sorry, Franki!

498
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,400
Oh my, how am I gonna
explain this to pap?

499
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Oh no!

500
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,700
Watch it! Back off! I'm crazy! I will do it!

501
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,900
- Wow!
- Wow!

502
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,100
Oh, what a...

503
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,400
Don't hurt us, we're sorry!
It was all Ernie idea!

504
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,300
Oscar! Did you kill that shark?

505
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,100
All right, yeah! Yeah!

506
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,900
Exactly how it looked, that's how it is.

507
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,900
What happened!

508
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,200
- Oh, you want to know what happened?
- Yeah, you're standing on top of shark!

509
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,100
- Go on man!
- Well I'll tell you what happened!

510
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,300
Big old shark, seventy-five hundred feet long,

511
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,000
so he's swimming at me, right?

512
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,300
- With teeth like razors!
- Razors!

513
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,600
And it was all like, you want come at me like that,

514
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,900
you want come to all like that?

515
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,000
Dude, do the muscle thing, the muscle thing!

516
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,300
Oh right, right. So I told that dude,
I said do you see this guy?

517
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,700
And I pointed like this,
well he's got a brother.

518
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,800
And he lives right over here!

519
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,500
And I think it's time for a little
family reunion!

520
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,100
- You see man, I told you!
- Excuse me.

521
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,100
- We were right there, right there!
- Pardon me. Move it!

522
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,300
Sorry, sorry! She seems so nice on TV.

523
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,900
Oscar, Katie Current. As a first fish in history,

524
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,800
that ever take on a shark and win, tell me,

525
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,900
does this mean you're now
the protector of the reef?

526
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,700
- New sheriff in town, the big cahuna?
- Katie, I'm a keeper of reef,

527
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
- I can call you Katie, right?
- Of course!

528
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Any shark
tries to mess around
in Oscar town,

529
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,500
is going down!

530
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,800
Yeah, just poetic, I mean poetic!

531
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,300
Oscar! Oscar.

532
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Okay, get out of here, barracuda,

533
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
any further questions will be filled by me!

534
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,800
- And you are?
- I'm his manager, Sykes. With an Y.

535
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,100
And I'm his financial advisor!

536
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,400
You wanna see my puppets?

537
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,300
Hello!

538
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,800
Could you excuse for a moment, please?

539
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,500
- My manager?
- Kid, you're a superstar!

540
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,600
We're gonna make a fortune!
Just let me handle it.

541
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,500
- What about the five gees?
- Forget the five gees.

542
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,600
- From now on we're partners!
- So what exactly are we talking about here?

543
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,400
- I'm thinking about 90/10 split.
- Well, that's actualy pretty generous.

544
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,900
You're the 10, I take my 90 off the top.

545
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,200
- I don't think so!
- Talk to me.

546
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,600
- You get 50!
- 70.

547
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,400
- 20!
- 75.

548
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,700
Dude! You're going the wrong way!

549
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,700
- Fifty-fifty!
- Fifty-fifty!

550
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,900
- You're happy?
- No, you're happy?

551
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,400
- No! Deal!
- Deal!

552
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,300
My manager and I are now
prepared to take your questions.

553
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,400
Oscar, are you going to continue
working here at the wash?

554
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,300
Please, I bearly work here now!

555
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,400
- Keep in up, kid. You're slaying them!
- No, he's slaying sharks!

556
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,100
Hey, that's good,
that's good, I like that!

557
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,300
Oscar, the Sharkslayer!

558
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,100
- Wow!
- A Sharkslayer!

559
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,800
You heard it here first, from now on,

560
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,000
any shark tries to bother this reef,

561
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
it's had its funeral.

562
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
I could fly high...

563
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,100
- Franki, we'll miss you.
- To Franki!

564
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,900
It's a terrible thing, Don Lino.
Everybody loved Franki.

565
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,600
May whoever did this, die at thousand depths.

566
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,000
May his stinking maggy coffered corpse rot

567
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,600
in a fire depth of hell!

568
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,800
Thank you for your kind
thoughts, Giuseppe.

569
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,900
Oh and may Lenny be
found safe and sound too.

570
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,600
- Hope he's okay.
- Oh Lenny.

571
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,300
- Don't worry, boss.
- I said some things to him...

572
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,500
- We' gotta find him.
- We're searching everywhere.

573
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,300
Forget about it, he'll turn up.

574
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,500
What's wrong with that kid?
Why does he gotta be so different?

575
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,900
Franki, god rest his soul,
he was perfect. Perfect!

576
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,400
Oh, Luca, who could have done this?

577
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:05,500
Don Lino, at this most difficult time,
please accept my deepest condolences.

578
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,900
Thank you, Don Brizzi,

579
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,000
for honouring my son with your song.

580
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,000
I got some news, about
the guy who took out Franki.

581
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,900
Hey, let's talk over here.

00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,600

00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,600
Calls himself the Sharkslayer.

584
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,800
- I'm here, over here.
- The Sharkslayer!

585
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,100
- Where do I find him?
- He's from the south side reef,

586
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,800
that's all we could dig up.
- Thank you, thank you.

587
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,900
- Any request?
- Luca.

588
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,900
- How about that Titanic song?
- No, no!

589
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,800
Get Sykes, he knows that
reef better than anybody.

590
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
I wanna find this guy, I wanna
know everything about him,

591
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,900
I wanna know where he lives,
I wanna know where he sleeps,

592
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,600

593
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Here he is! The Sharkslayer!

603
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,700
Come on, you didn't have to get me anything.

604
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,800
- What did you get me?
- Well, what does every bachelor need!

605
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,500
A lover lamp! How did you
know I love lover lamps?

606
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,900
You know what, I'm gonna put it

607
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,200
Hey, come Ange, I wanna show

00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:46,400
- Top of reef! It's amazing!

All I'm trying to say, is that...

613
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,500
- I'm proud of you, Oscar.
- Yeah, it was nothing, really.

614
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,900
You know what? Wait

615
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,600

621
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,900
- I'd never could have done it without you.
- Oh, sure you could.

622
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,900
Well, probably not.

623
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,900

624
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,200

00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,600
- Oh that's okay!
- Bam!

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,100
There's a Sharkslayer around here!

654
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,300
Oh yeah, Lenny! Lenny!

655
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,500
- That was close.
- Super close.

656
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,400
Don't panic.

657
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,700
- Quiet, we're safe.
- No, not you again!

658
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,000
- Yeah, what was that?
- What is with you, man!

659
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,100
- Shh, he could be anywhere.
- Who?

660
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,600
Shh, the Sharkslayer.

661
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,300
- There's no Sharkslayer around here.
- Yes, there is!

662
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,100
- No, there is not, trust me on this one.
- Get a hold of yourself, man!

663
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,800
- This is no time to act crazy!
- You're the one acting crazy! Crazy!

664
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,000
You're right. You're right, I'm sorry.

665
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,800

667
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,000
No, that's not all that.

668
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
- Just relax.
- It's my fault!

669
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,200
- Not really, but still!
- Okay calm. You just need a little time.

670
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,400
- Man look, things are work out.
- You think?

671
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,700
Yeah! So...

672
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,700
Look, I'll take off, and you
should just go home, okay?

673
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,200
- Okay.
- Hey, good luck, dog.

674
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,700
- Wait!
- What, man?

675
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,200
- I didn't catch your name.
- Oscar.

676
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,300
- I'm Lenny. Hi!
- Hi.

677
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,300
- Where do you live?
- Lenny? Where I come from,

678
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,100
fish don't like to get
grabbed by sharks, okay?

679
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,600
- Sorry.
- Go home!

680
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,600
There is no home for me anymore.
Don't you understand that?

681
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,200
- You're too big to be grabbing me like this.
- Take me home with you.

682
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,300
- Shh! What?
- You won't even notice I'm in!

683
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,500
I'm like the invisible shark!

684
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,600
- Are you crazy?
- Please, I'm begging you,

685
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,400
don't leave me alone!
- Shh!

686
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,000
Yo! Put you fins on the wall,
where I could see them!

687
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,000
- Got ya!
- Hey, yo! Shorty!

688
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,200
- Oscar!
- What ya doing here?

689
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
- Check out my mad bum!
- Check it out.

690
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,700
Bum! There is!

691
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,100
- Do you like it?
- You kids got some skills!

692
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,100
What did I tell you? You can
shooting be doing this!

693
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,200
And besides, it's not safe
to be here at night.

694
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,000
It is now, dude bro,
you're the Sharkslayer!

695
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,400
- Sharkslayer?
- Sometimes I'd be coughing like that.

696
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,100
Look, I just need you off of these streets.

697
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,400
- Come on!
- Get your butts home!

698
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,700
Cause I know your moms,
and I'm just tell them you are doing bad.

699
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,700
- Hey let's go make mister Sykes puff up!
- Yeah! Bye Oscar!

700
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,000
- Lenny! Did you see what just hapened there?
- I know. They think you're the Sharkslayer!

701
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,300
As if!

702
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,100
- I appreciate your funky tone, actually.
- No, wait up! Hey! I'm sorry.

703
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,100
Seriously, I don't want you mad at me.

704
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,400
And I certainly don't want you to 'slay me'!

705
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,600
You're having a good time, right?

706
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,000
Are you enjoying yourself?

707
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,000
Well, for your information,

708
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,900
I am the Sharkslayer!

709
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,000
Oscar the Sharkslayer,
that's what they're saying!

710
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,500
- Wait, you mean you?
- Yeah.

711
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,800
When the anchor...

712
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,400
- Oh, you're a liar!
- Hey, I didn't lie, all right?

713
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,300
Allright, I lied!

714
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,400
But that was a little lie! Come on,
no one's was gonna be hurt anyway!

715
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,700
What am I doing? I'm not
gonna explain myself to you.

716
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,900
- You know what? You're on your own!
- No problem!

717
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,300
And if god forbids, someone should, I don't know.

718
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,600
Find out the truth about the
Sharkslayer on my way back...

719
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,800
- You wouldn't!
- I would.

720
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,100
Come here!

721
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,100
Of course you can cup on me!

722
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,400
But you know, I mean, you're a shark, right?

723
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,300
And I'm a Sharkslayer,
so we can't be seen together.

724
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:55,000
- You dig dug?
- Dig dug, dug dig. Dig dug, yeah!

725
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,500
- Yo, diggy dug!
- Just come on!

726
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,000
Okay Lenny, follow my every
move and don't make a sound.

727
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:09,300
You got it. Wow, echo. Echo!

728
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,100
Now, coming for the
south side sharks, I'm fifty.

729
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,400
Oh, it's not okay to hit!

730
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,400
- Get your bum in there!
- You think anybody heard that?

731
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,600
- Who is that? Ha? Who's that?
- Yo-hoo! Crazy Joe!

732
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,900
I thought I heard something!
Did you get that shark?

733
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:15,800
- You have no idea, Joe!
- That's great! Well, gotta go, my show's on!

734
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,100
All right. We're safe. For now.

735
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,900
Hey a bed! Oh! Yeah,
that's good. That's heaven.

736
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,100
Snuggely buggley waggely!

737
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,200
- I love you man!
- Wow, hold on!

738
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,900
- You're my new best friend!
- Stop it! Okay, you wanna be friends?

739
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,700
Fine, but we gotta lay down some rules.

740
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,900
Rule number one, no snuggely buggely,

741
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,700
whatever that just was!
- You got it. Anything else?

742
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,100
Allright, rule number two!
And this is the most important rule.

743
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,100
Any event, that possibly,
you know, you're hungry...

744
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,100
Don't worry, I'm not gonna eat anyone.

745
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,200
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm different from the other sharks.

746
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,500
Let's put it that way,
leave it at that. Good night!

747
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,100
- Define different.
- You'll laugh.

748
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,700
- I'm not gonna laugh!
- Well that's just what you said,

749
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,500
and then what happens later? You laugh.

750
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,300
Lenny, I give you my word.

751
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,800
Okay, I will tell you, I'm...

752
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,400
I'm a vegetarian.

753
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,800
Hm, hold on.

754
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,900
So that's it?

755
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,300
- What do you mean that's it?
- I'm just...

756
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,800
You're first fish I've ever told!

757
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,600
I'm so tired of keeping that all a secret!

758
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,300
- And my dad,
- Wow, hey!

759
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,900
he'll never accept me for who I am.

760
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,400
- What's wrong with me?
- Nothing is wrong with you, man.

761
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:56,800
- I think all sharks should be like you.
- God, that sweet to say.

762
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,800
And stop blaming yourself for what happened.

763
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,700
- Really?
- If you wanna blame anybody,

764
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,800
blame me. Cause if I hadn't been out there,

765
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,800
in the first place, nothing of this would happen!

766
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,500
Yeah, if pop knew that,
he'd ice you for sure.

767
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,200
Ice? Was that a godfather or something?

768
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,500
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, 'yeah'?

769
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,400
Yeah, he is.

770
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,700
Hey, are you all right?

771
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:26,700
GAME OVER

772
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,600
- Ha, man, I told you!
- I'm doing this!

773
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,500
Left circle double left square right
to the down square square.

774
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,800
Another square! Respect.
- Respect.

775
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,300
Oh yeah? Well I got some news for you!

776
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,600
The Sharkslayer made me
his manager, so I'm now...

777
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,900
what I like to call untouchable!
Did you hear me?

778
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,800
- Sykes!
- Okay.

779
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,700
Hey Oscar!

780
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,700
- Sykes!
- Hey hey hey, there he is,

781
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,600
my brother, my player, the Sharkslayer!
- Yeah whatever, Sykes listen.

782
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,700
And another thing, from now on you're gonna
have to start paying me for protection!

783
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,700
Sykes, the deal is off, the shark
I killed was Don Lino's son!

784
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,500
- I know! Any grade?
- Not if he finds out!

785
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,400
What do you mean find out? I've got
him on the phone right now!

786
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,400
That's right, Lino. I've got the
Sharkslayer right here in front of me!

787
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,500
- And he's gonna slay you and all of your sharks!
- Sykes, shut up! Shut up!

788
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,300
Hey that's good. That's good, I like that.

789
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,700
Shut up, Lino! Shut up!

790
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,600
- What? Oh, kid, he wants to talk to you.
- I know, I'm not here! I'm not here!

791
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,400
Yeah, he's right here.

792
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,700
- Hello.
- Shut up? Shut up?

793
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,400
You don't tell me shut up,
I tell you shut up!

794
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,300
- What? Hello?
- Yeah, how you're doing?

795
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,900
Let me have a pie with everything on it.
Anchovies, meet balls, mushrooms...

796
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,000
- Luca!
- Oh, hi boss!

797
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,600
- What are you doing working in a pizza joint?
- Get off the phone!

798
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,500
But I'm hungry!

799
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,100
My guys are coming for you, Sharkslayer!

800
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,900
They are going to tear you fin from fin!

801
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,000
Come on, now who's your puff daddy?

802
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,800
Who takes care of you?

803
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,100
Come on you two, we've got work to do.

804
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,700
- I was winning!
- Sykes, Sykes, hold, look!

805
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,900
- You got it all wrong!
- I've been writing songs about you kid!

806
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,500
- All the shark bites..
- Sykes.

807
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,900
With his teeth dear.

808
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,500
- And then Oscar,
- Sykes!

809
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,600
- Kicked his butt!
- Sykes, Sykes, man!

810
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,400
- Come on!
- Maybe I can help?

811
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,500
Hey! Lola! What are you doing here?

812
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,000
You pop it up sometimes in places!

813
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Oh you said to wait, so...

814
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:25,300
- I've been waiting.
- Look, I don't have a lot of time

815
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,200
for a whole hand clappy making the life's go on

816
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,200
music playing and the guitar thing, you know.

817
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,300
- What are you afraid of?
- Afraid? That's funny.

818
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,200
I'm not afraid of nothing, it's just...

819
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:41,400
- Oh baby, you're so tense.
- Yeah, you know. I've really been stressed lately,

820
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,800
like protecting the reef,
you know, I do that for myself.

821
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,300
- It's just too crazy.
- It's just too much.

822
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,600
Yeah, you know, just one
thing on top of the other.

823
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,100
Actually I was thinking about retiring.

824
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,700
- You don't wanna do that.
- I don't?

825
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,200
You have worked your way to the top.

826
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,500
You don't wanna go back
to the bottom, do you?

827
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:10,600
- No. No, no way!
- You just show them who's boss.

828
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,100
And the sharks will leave you alone.

829
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,200
Yeah, you're right!
Lenny!

830
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:29,400
- Pss! Lenny! Where are you?
- Hello, Oscar.

831
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:34,200
Angie! Hey! What are you doing here?

832
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,000
What Oscar, did you forget something?

833
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:40,100
Oh maybe, you forgot your shark!

834
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,100
Hi.

835
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,500
Shark! Swim Angie! I'll cover you! Quick!

836
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:53,100
- Before it's too late! Go home without me!
- Oh stop it! Your friend shark here told me everything.

837
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,900
- Lenny, why would you do that?
- I don't know, I like her!

838
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,800
Thank you, I like you too.

839
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,700
What were you thinking bringing him in here?

840
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,200
- No, I just, I'm still working at the cakes.
- Cakes? You lie!

841
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,000
- Everybody thinks you're slayer of the sharks!
- Who am I gonna tell that they are wrong?

842
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,900
- How could you lie to me, Oscar? Me?
- Don't take it personally. Come on, I lied to everybody!

843
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,500
All right. Look, I'm sorry. I totally betrayed you,

844
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,300
but listen I got just one...

845
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,100
little problem I gotta take care of.
- Of what's that?

846
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:30,100
- Sharks are coming to get me!
- And they should!

847
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,800
I mean, what did you expect?
You just take credit for killing the shark

848
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,700
and everything will be fine and
dandy for the rest of your life?

849
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,800
Yeah!

850
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,800
But don't you worry about it.
Me and Lenny got it,

851
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,400
we go fix it!
- Wow, wow, wow.

852
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:50,000
- What's with the 'we', I don't wanna 'we' part of this.
- Hey, too late now, vagie boy, they'll be looking for you too.

853
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,700
- Point taken. What's the plan?
- Allright, just what we will do.

854
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:58,500
Oscar! Here's the plan! You tell
the truth. And you go home!

855
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,900
Allright, look. This we're gonna do, right?

856
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,100
We will paint you up all bloody. Just mess, right?

857
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,600
And you go swim out and meet
the sharks before they get here.

858
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,600
And you will say stop!

859
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,800
Don't go no further! This Sharkslayer's crazy man!

860
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,800
He beat me senceless!
He's stone cold killer, man!

861
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,500
And then you can tell them I'm huge!

862
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,000
You know, tell them that I'm handsome.

863
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:31,900
- You're going way too far, Oscar!
- Acually he hasn't gone far enough.

864
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,700
Exactly!
What?

865
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,400
You need slay a shark,
and I need to dissappear.

866
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,300
This is what we're gonna do.

867
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,800
This is Katie Current, reporting live.

868
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,500
We've got uncontrolled reports of...

869
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,700
Shark!!!

870
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,500
Look, it's the Sharkslayer!

871
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,700
Holy microbe! Did we get that?

872
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,600
Hey, Ange! Oscar's on the TV!

873
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,900
Show me that. Allright,
do what you do best.

874
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,800
Do you hear them, Lenny?
They are going crazy, man!

875
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,000
- They love us!
- They love you, they hate me!

876
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,500
- What?
- Let's switch sides,

877
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,000
maybe I can be the Fishslayer!

878
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,200
- They'll never see it coming!
- Come on, man!

879
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,100
You saw this, you'll never
have to go home again!

880
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,700
You can start a new life!

881
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,600
- Now give me a growl!
- Okay.

882
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,200
- Like that?
- That was pretty good.

883
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,300
Let's go!

884
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,600
Is that what you're offering?
Do you understand how huge

885
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,700
my client is? Turn on your TV right now!

886
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,700
Lenny, hold on! Lenny, Lenny!

887
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,800
Turn off your TV! Turn off your TV!

888
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,500
- Don't swallow!
- Oscar?

889
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,500
No, it's Pinnoccio. Of course it's me!
Why did you do that?

890
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,100
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. Sorry, is when you step

891
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,700
on somebody's fin at the movie theater.

892
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,800
It is sorry. Sorry, is what you say,

893
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,300
Hey, where's the baby, dude?

894
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,900
And it turns out to burst is just fat!

895
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,500
This is as far away from sorry,
as you could possibly get!

896
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:49,500
- But Oscar! I think I'm gonna puke.
- No, no, no! Lenny, just open up.

897
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,600
Nice and easy.

898
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,500
- Are you not entertained?
- Go Oscar, man!

899
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,700
- You can't handle its rule!
- Go get them!

900
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,100
You had me at hello!

901
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,800
Turn your TV back on! What are you doing,

902
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,000
turning your TV off? Turn it on!

903
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,200
This reef is huge. How we're supposed
to find the Sharkslayer?

904
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,000
This is it, Lenny. Big finish!
Just like we practised.

905
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,200
- The flying fish?
- The flying fish!

906
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Little more help here, body boy!

907
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,700
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

908
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,600
Curse you, Sharkslayer!

909
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,900
Yeah, and you tell Don Lino,

910
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,500
that I don't never ever ever ever never!
Want to see another shark

911
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,300
on this reef again!
- Ever!

912
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,800
Remember this name,

913
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,600
Oscar the Sharkslayer!

914
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,100
Aha! You see? You see? Ha?

915
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,700
Look at Oscar! Oscar!

916
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,500
Hey, Lol...

917
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,600
It seems that Sharkslayer not only
countered a few sharks today,

918
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:24,500
but maybe a few hearts?
Has the reef's most eligible

919
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,800
bachelor have been snapped up?

920
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,300
I'm Katie Current. You're live watching
the Sharkslayer making out.

921
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,800
Hey Angie, can you hand me the blue one?

922
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,500
Thank you.

923
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,200
Who steps in the room?

924
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,600
- Yeah!
- Oscar and Lenny!

925
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,700
What a dream baby! Give me that!
Give me some fin!

926
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,600
- High fin!
- Give me some fin!

927
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,400
- Low fin!
- Did you see me? I was like...

928
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
- That was great!
- When you punched me, the crowd was...

929
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,900
Yeah, the ate it up! Hey Angie, Angie

930
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,600
you ain't know how Lenny had me in him, did you?

931
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,100
- It was like an Oscar explosion!
- How good was I?

932
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,400
- Oh you was the ball!
- Thank you, thank you.

933
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,100
Hey, hey, hey! Casanova!

934
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,500
I saw your big finish on the news.
Nice smooch, lover boy.

935
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,800
It was just private, just private.

936
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:21,700
- Private! The entire reef saw you do it.
- Hey, somebody's got a bad move.

937
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,000
Come on, Ange. Let me see the smile!

938
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,600
- Show me the smile, baby!
- Knock it off!

939
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,600
- What is gotten in you?
- Me? I want, I swear! Sometimes I wanna

940
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,300
take your big dumb dummy head and just...

941
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,400
- Ange, Ange, what is the problem?
- Problem? There's no problem, I'm not having problem!

942
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,600
Maybe it's probably because
you're the one with a problem!

943
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,300
- Hey you guys?
- What have you got against Lola?

944
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,700
Not my lips, that's for sure!

945
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,200
- Okay, what's going on?
- I'm gonna stay out of this.

946
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,600
Look, why would you even
care about Lola anyway?

947
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,800
- I don't!
- You don't?

948
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,800
- No!
- No what?

949
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,100
- I don't know!
- You guys, you wanna get?

950
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,100
- No
- No!

951
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,300
Just tell me, Oscar, cause I'm curious.

952
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,700
Why do you think she's interested?
Do you think for one minute

953
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,100
that she would even be with you,
if you want to reach a fame of Sharkslayer?

954
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,200
- Come on guys, please don't fight.
- Are you that light?

955
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,000
- At least she treats me like I'm somebody!
- Yeah, but will she love you if you were nobody?

956
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,700
- Nobody loved me when I was nobody!
- I did!

957
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,600
Before the money, and before the fame,

958
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,900
before the lie! To me you were a somebody, Oscar.

959
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Now you're nothing! But a fake. A shame.

960
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:37,100
- You're joker.
- Here I come!

961
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,800
Sebastian, the way you'll washing dolphin!

962
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,100
- Angie.
- No, forget it! Just go!

963
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,400
Cause I'm tired of hearing that everything
you had in your life wasn't good enough.

964
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,400
Including me.

965
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,700
- Angie?
- Oh honey, I'm sorry.

966
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,500
Go back and do it again.

967
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:24,400
Hey, come on. It'll be okay.

968
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,500
You can't have the lose!
You got shark breath!

969
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,500
'O' mints

970
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,300
'Coca cola'
'Get real'

971
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,100
What are you kids doing?
How many times I got to tell you?

972
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,800
This is past your bed time! Go on, all right.

973
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,400
Hey, hey, hey! What are you kids are...

974
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,200
Well, it looks pretty good!
You guys should do this for a living!

975
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,500
Preparation 'O'!

976
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,600
It slays hemorroids like Oscar slays sharks!

977
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,900
Hey Oscar!

978
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,200
Angie was right. I am a joker.

979
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:23,300
Hey, Sharkslayer. Why are you in here?

980
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,500
- All your friens are inside!
- Not all my friends.

981
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,200
You may not little bottom feeder
from the whale wash.

982
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,200
Forget about her. She's a nobody.

983
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,400
I'm the nobody.

984
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,300
Oh let me guess. She told you that she loves you,

985
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,600
is that it?

986
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,500
It's not like you feel the same way about her.

987
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,800
You know what? I don't think
this is gonna work out.

988
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,900
What? Are you dumping me?

989
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,100
Let me explain something to you.

990
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,300
We get party like at your birthday.

991
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,000
Ha! Young love!

992
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,100
CHOCOLATES

993
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,200
FLOWERS

994
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,600
- Hey Oscar!
- Hey, I can't talk, I gotta find Angie!

995
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,300
I need to tell her... I love her!

996
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,900
Where you're going, Oscar?

997
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:49,300
- Hi, whale wash.
- Give me the phone!

998
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:53,200
- We'll you got a whale to wash and the price...
- Give me back the phone! And the price is...

999
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:58,000
very very low. Consider no good washers!
- Good one, Ernie.

1000
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,200
How many times do I have to tell you? It's gosh!

1001
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,900
You get a whale of a wash,
and the price - oh my gosh!

1002
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,900
- All right, we get it man.
- Whale wash,

1003
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,800
rhymes with gush!
- Give me that!

1004
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,300
Get out of here, both of you.
Won't you use some place else, will you?

1005
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,300
- Sykes? Where's Angie?
- You tell me!

1006
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,500
Whale wash, you got a whale of a wash... No?

1007
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,600
- It's for you.
- Ha?

1008
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,600
- Hello?
- Is this the Sharkslayer?

1009
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,400
- Yeah, who is this?
- It's Luca the octop... I mean,

1010
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,400
forget about it. Now you follow
these instructions, okay?

1011
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,100
Fall cabinet, top drawer,
there's a package. Get it.

1012
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,300
That's right, tough guy,
we got your girl.

1013
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,700
That is gonna be a sit-down. In one hour.

1014
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,100
- Who is it?
- Shh!

1015
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:43,000
Be there if you don't want
to see her sleeping with the fishes.

1016
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,600
The bad ones.

1017
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,500
Now nod your head if you understand.

1018
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,900
Now tell me if you nodded your head.

1019
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,000
I nodded.

1020
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,300
They got Angie. And they want a sit-down.

1021
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,000
I never meant for anybody to get hurt,

1022
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,500
especially not Angie. This is all my fault.

1023
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,800
That's a classic move. I've
seen it a thousand times.

1024
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:12,000
They take the thing you love the most,
and then they use it against you!

1025
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,700
Look, we gotta go to that sit-down,
and we gotta save her.

1026
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,000
Wow, wow, wow. Look,
I wanna save Angie too,

1027
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,600
but I can't just sit there and say,

1028
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,600
- Hi pap, I'm a dolphin!
- Lenny?

1029
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,400
And my friend Sharkslayer, he is a fake!

1030
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,500
- Fake?
- Come on!

1031
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,900
We're gonna need
a better plan than that.

1032
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,300
This is a joke, right? This is a joke?

1033
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,600
Because you know, I told Lino,

1034
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,800
Shut up, Lino! Shut up!

1035
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,100
Tell me you didn't make it a low kid.

1036
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,300
Tell me that's not Lenny. Tell
me you're a real Sharkslayer.

1037
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,500
- Please!
- I'm sorry, Sykes.

1038
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:44,900
I'm not.

1039
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,000
But the sharks don't know that.

1040
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,000
Would you stop screwing around? This will
never work. We're dead, we're dead!

1041
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,600
Sh! Thank you, Sykes. Thank you!

1042
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,300
My man Sykes has just begged me

1043
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,300
not to murder you all up here, right?

1044
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,500
Now I might listen to him.
But then I cannot might not.

1045
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,400
And that depends on the individual behaviour

1046
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:39,300
of all the individuals in here. Individuals.

1047
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,500
Hey, is that right?

1048
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:46,000
- Look, he's got dolphine muscle.
- My uncle Will got wacked by one of those.

1049
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,300
All right. Which one of you sorry
deans caled this meeting?

1050
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,400
That would be me.

1051
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:57,900
So, this the Sharkslayer? I've been
looking forward to meet you.

1052
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,900
I feel like we're practically family!
You know that's funny, ain't it?

1053
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:06,100
I brought my kids into the
world. Full love and care.

1054
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,200
And you took them out.
You know who I am?

1055
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,300
Do you know who I am?

1056
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:17,300
I'm the Don! The boss of the Great White sharks!

1057
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,100
Hey boss, I saved your seat.

1058
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,900
I've been running this reef
since before you was born!

1059
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,600
And If you thought that guy like me,

1060
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,400
can't get to a guy like you, guess what?

1061
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,800
You thought wrong!

1062
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,600
Man, you're the one who's wrong.
I barely know that girl.

1063
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,700
- What her name was?
- Oh yeah?

1064
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,000
Well I say he's bluffing.

1065
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,800
- If I wasn't marry.
- How you're doing, pretty lady?

1066
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:55,900
- Lola! We meet again!
- You know, Sharkslayer,

1067
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,500
there's only one thing
I like better than money...

1068
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,300
Revenge!

1069
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:06,000
- Oh, I'm in love!
- Your shark slaying days are over!

1070
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,000
and there ain't nothing you can do about it.

1071
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,200
Ha? What's so funny?

1072
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,700
You got nothing! Nothing!

1073
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,800
Sebastian, take a roll!

1074
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,200
Can't touch this!

1075
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,300
Can't touch this!

1076
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,900
Stop! Oscar time!
Okay!

1077
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,600
New rules! Nobody!

1078
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,800
I repeat, nobody makes
a move without my okay.

1079
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,100
I am the pattern marker now baby!

1080
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,100
From now on everything flows through me!

1081
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,100
What did he do? What did he do? I can't see it!

1082
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:03,100
You don't lose a two, you don't
grow one back without my okay.

1083
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,900
- Okay?
- Okay.

1084
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,600
If you sneeze, you don't white
dead boogie without my okay.

1085
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,800
- Okay?
- Okay.

1086
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,500
All right. And you don't say okay, without my okay.

1087
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,600
Okay?

1088
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,500
Okay! Thank you all for coming,
good meeting, we gotta go.

1089
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,400
And one more thing. What is with
all your living in a low boo?

1090
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,300
- Oscar!
- That was supposed to be my

1091
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,000
get yourselves a real high-down!
- Oscar.

1092
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,900
And take the good look, Lino. It's over!

1093
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,700
- Your old school!
- Oscar!

1094
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:34,500
What?

1095
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,700
Excuse me.

1096
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:51,100
- Ange, are you okay?
- No! I am not okay!

1097
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:54,000
- He ate me!
- I had to take it.

1098
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,800
- The taste was killing me!
- Lenny?

1099
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,400
Is that you?

1100
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,600
You're alive?
I thought I lost you!

1101
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,600
What are you wearing, ha?

1102
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,700
What is that?

1103
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,600
Hey boss, it's Lenny!

1104
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,300
He was wearing the disguise,
so we wouldn't recognize him.

1105
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,200
But now he's not wearing a disguise,

1106
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,500
so we do recognize him!

1107
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,600
- Hi pap.
- Are you kidding me?

1108
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,900
Are you kidding me?
Are you out of your mind?

1109
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,900
Do you have any idea how this looks?

1110
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,900
This is the best sit-down,
I've ever been to!

1111
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,200
What are you doing with disguise?
You took out your own flash and blood!

1112
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,300
- Franki!
- Look pap, just listen!

1113
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,600
It's not that, you never take
side against the family, ever!

1114
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,200
Hey Don Lino! Sir, listen!
It's not his fault!

1115
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:01,400
- This is between you and me.
- What did I ever do to you!

1116
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:05,100
You took Franki away, and you've
turned Lenny into a dolphin!

1117
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,300
I'm gonna get you!

1118
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:11,800
- Oscar! Look out!
- Oscar! Swim! Swim for your life!

1119
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,700
You're gonna regret the day
you became the Sharkslayer!

1120
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:28,200
- Look who's talking in the pot hole!
- Ha?

1121
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:33,200
You're still hungry big guy!
Well say hello to my little friends!

1122
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,400
- Try again.
- Whale wash.

1123
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,700
You get a whale of a wash
and a price. Oh my gosh!

1124
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,800
All right, you got it right!

1125
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,400
- You got it right.
- Move! Everybody everyway!

1126
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,700
Come on, Lino. It's time
to clean up your act.

1127
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,700
Pap, leave him alone!

1128
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,900
All right Lino! Game's over!

1129
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,100
Lenny? What are you doing in there?

1130
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,900
- Sorry.
- Where's Lino?

1131
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,000
- He's right behind me, isn't he?
- You're mine now!

1132
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,400
- Let's finish the Sharkslayer.
- Oh we're about to!

1133
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,900
Thank you for coming to whale wash.

1134
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:36,900
Okay! Somebody needs to get me
out of the bubble. Today!

1135
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,500
- Angie?
- The Sharkslayer has done it again!

1136
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,400
- Hey!
- This time...

1137
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,200
- Wait!
- glorying two sharks into his

1138
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,600
death trap of high gene.
- No!

1139
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,200
Oscar, you're the somebody,
everybody wants to be!

1140
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:52,200
The top of the food chain!
Tell our cameras, how it feels to be you.

1141
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,500
- Angie?
- Oscar, get me out of here, quick!

1142
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,500
I need to get straight so I get
as far away as I supposed to.

1143
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,300
- Look what you did to him!
- No, it's all a big misunderstanding!

1144
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,400
Sharkslayer, over here! One word
about you, Sharkslayer.

1145
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,100
- Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer!
- Stop!

1146
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,500
I am not a real Sharkslayer!

1147
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,600
- I lied.
- What?

1148
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,500
And I'm not a real financial advisor!

1149
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:32,900
Okay, it was an anchor that killed Franki.

1150
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,300
I didn't have anything to do
with it and neither did Lenny.

1151
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:39,000
If that was true, why did you ran away?

1152
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,700
I think you always wanted me to be like Franki.

1153
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,900
I'll never be the shark you want me to be.

1154
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,000
What is your problem?

1155
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,600
So, your son likes calp? So?

1156
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,200
His best friends are fishes. So?

1157
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,900
He likes to dress like a dolphin, so what?!

1158
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,600
Everybody loves him just the way he is.

1159
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,000
Why can't you?

1160
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,100
Don't make the same mistake that I did.

1161
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:11,300
I didn't know what I have. Till I lost her.

1162
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,800
Will you get me out of this?
So I can hug my kid.

1163
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,100
- And tell him I'm sorry.
- Pap!

1164
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,200
Give me a hue.

1165
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:37,900
I love you son, no matter
what you eat, or how you dress.

1166
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,300
- Oscar?
- Angie?

1167
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:49,500
Angie...

1168
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,100
I wish I knew now
what I knew then. I mean...

1169
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,500
I wish you knew,
what I knew. I mean...

1170
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,000
- Before this.
- You're blowing it, man!

1171
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Mind your business, all right?

1172
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,900
I'm just emotional,
and there's pressure!

1173
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,300
What I'm saying, I just...

1174
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,100
I didn't mean the top of the reef.

1175
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:12,100
Everything I wanted was right there in front of me.

1176
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,800
The whole time.

1177
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,200
What about being a somebody?

1178
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,600
I'm nobody without you.

1179
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,300
You're not helping.

1180
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,500
Oh, come here! You big dumb dummy head!

1181
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,000
I've never told you till this, but

1182
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,200
you're the best henchmen
and guides I ever had.

1183
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,700
Come on, group hug!

1184
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,000
- Ah! Hey!
- Sorry man, sorry.

1185
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,200
Come such, straight again
man, don't be afraid.

1186
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,800
Oh forget, the moment's gone.

1187
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,300
So Lino, Don, we're cool, right?

1188
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:02,300
I mean like the reef is safe,
you know walk the streets,

1189
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,400
you know without... you know?

1190
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,700
Yeah, we're cool.

1191
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,200
Oscar, excuse me, Oscar?

1192
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,500
You've lost everything
you've lied so hard to achieve.

1193
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,300
Tell me, what's next for you?

1194
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,500
Come on! Everyone's waiting!

1195
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,700
- Mister manager!
- Hey, I just gotta put

1196
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,500
the finishing touch on my new desk.

1197
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,400
I love you, pap.

1198
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,000
- Yo, dog!
- Sykes!

1199
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
All right partner,
let's see what you can do.

1200
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:38,500
Sykes and Oscar's whale wash
is now opened for business!

1201
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:45,000
Yo E, B, let's get this party boomed!

1202
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,600
The other wheels of steel!

Yo Christina! Missy!
How about we have a low?

1204
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,800
Oscar leashes furnal!

1205
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,500
What's up with your bow? Let it go!

1206
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,300

01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,800

No, no snap it, snap it,

1213
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,300
- I'm snapping, I'm snapping!
