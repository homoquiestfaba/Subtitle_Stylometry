2
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,550
Waking up begins with saying
''am'' and ''now''.

3
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,950
Jennifer, I'm not gonna tell you again.

4
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,680
For the past eight months waking
up has actually hurt.

5
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,840
The cold realization that
I'm still here slowly sets in.

6
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,950
I was never teribly fond of waking up.

7
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,350
I was never one to jump out of bed and
greet the day with a smile like Jim was.

8
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,720
I used to want to punch him sometimes
in the morning he was so happy.

9
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,400
I always used to tell him that only fools
greet the day with a smile...

10
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,280
...that only fools possibly
escape the simple truth.

11
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,110
That now isn't simply now.

12
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,240
It's a cold reminder.
One day later than yesterday.

13
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,760
One year later than last year.

14
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,990
And that sooner or later it will come.

15
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,320
He used to laugh at me and then
give me kiss on the cheek.

16
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,950
It takes time in the morning
for me to become George.

17
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,270
The time to adjust to what is expected
of George and how he is to behave.

18
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,760
By the time I have dressed and
put the final layer of polish...

19
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,040
...on the now slightly stiff
but quite perfect George...

20
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,400
...I know fully what part
I'm supposed to play

21
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,750
Looking in the mirror staring back at me
isn't so much as a face...

22
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,960
...as the expression of a predicament.

23
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,110
Just get through the goddamn day.

24
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,750
A bit melodramatic, I guess.

25
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,160
But then again...

26
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,160
...my heart has been broken.

27
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,470
I feel as if I am sinking, drowning...

28
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,800
...can't breathe.

29
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,920
Aren't you going to say something?
Are you kidding? It's spectacular.

30
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,280
What are you doing?

31
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,750
Just stop it.
Stop it.

32
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,960
I don't think that you're quite
ready for life in a glass house.

33
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,720
Drapes, old man.

34
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,920
You're the one who is always saying
that we are invisible.

35
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,350
That's not exactly what I meant.

36
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,240
For the first time in my life
I can't see my future.

37
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,040
Every day goes by in a haze.

38
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,990
But today I have decided
will be different.

39
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,270
Finally. You know it's been
raining here all day.

40
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,920
I've been trapped in this house
waiting for you to call.

41
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,470
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.
I'm calling for Mr. George Falconer.

42
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,440
I'm sorry, I was expecting someone else.
Yes sir, you have indeed called the...

43
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,430
...correct number. How may I help you?
- This is Harold Ackerley.

44
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,110
I'm Jim's cousin.

45
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,400
Of course.
Yes, good evening Mr. Ackerley.

46
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,760
I'm afraid I'm calling with
some bad news.

47
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,200
There has been a car accident.

48
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,449
An accident?

49
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:05,419
There has been a lot of snow here
lately and the roads have been icy.

50
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,040
On his way into town,
Jim lost control of his car.

51
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,160
It was instantaneous apparently.

52
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,790
It happened late yesterday, but his
parents didn’t want to call you.

53
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,830
I see.

54
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,070
In fact, they don't that
I'm calling you now.

55
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,550
But I thought that you should know.

56
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,190
Thank you.

57
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,480
I know this must be quite a shock.
It was for all of us.

58
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,950
Yes, indeed.

59
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,390
- Will there be a service?
- The day after tomorrow.

60
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,400
Well, I suppose I should
get off the phone...

61
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,400
...and book a plane flight.

62
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,360
The service is just for family.

63
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,760
For family, of course.

64
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,680
Well, thank you for calling.

65
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,840
- Mr. Ackerley?
- Yes?

66
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,680
- May I ask what happened to the dogs?
- Dogs?

67
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,960
There was a dog with him but he died.
Was there another one?

68
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,920
Yes, there was a small female.

69
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,830
I don't know, I'm sorry.

70
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,520
I haven't heard anyone
mentioning another dog.

71
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,760
- Well, thank you for calling Mr. Ackerley.
- Goodbye, Mr. Falconer.

72
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,750
Hello, Charley.

73
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,590
How did you know it was me?

74
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,400
Charlotte, nobody else calls me
before eight in the morning.

75
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,240
I didn't call too early, did I?
You sound grumpy.

76
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,830
No, I have a headache.

77
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,040
Listen, I was going to call you actually.
Is too late to change my mind about tonight.

78
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,710
No, of course not.
I haven't seen you all week.

79
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,510
- I'm dying for a dose of you.
- I know, I'm sorry.

80
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,200
So great, I'll see you tonight.

81
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,030
I have to run.
I'm late for the work.

82
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,310
I'll call you later from school.

83
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,310
Alright, I see you then.

84
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,790
- Bye, kiddo.
- Bye, old man.

85
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,400
Good morning, Mr. George.

86
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,360
Sir, you don't look so good today.

87
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:49,540
Good morning, Alva.
No, I didn't sleep very well.

88
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,359
You forgot to take the bread
out of the freezer this morning.

89
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:53,752
It stays fresh that way.

90
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,160
It was a little too fresh this morning.

91
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,829
There are some papers
laid out on my desk...

92
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,930
...which need to stay there.
Please don't move them.

93
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,600
- I'm afraid my pen leaked all over the bed.
- It's okay, sir.

94
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,430
- Alva?
- Yes, sir?

95
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,120
Thank you, you're a wonderful.

96
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:18,898
<i>This government, as promised,
has maintained the closest surveillance...</i>

97
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,986
<i>...of the Soviet military buildup
on the Island of Cuba.</i>

98
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:26,828
<i>Within the past week unmistakable evidence...</i>

99
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:29,159
<i>...has established the fact...</i>

100
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,448
- Professor Falconer?
- Yes?

101
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:39,784
There was a student here this
morning asking for your address.

102
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:40,950
My address?

103
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,160
- Did you give it to him?
- Yes, sir.

104
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,440
I did.

105
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,110
I hope that's okay.

106
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,880
I realize that I probably shouldn't
have but he was very nice.

107
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,320
Before I knew it he...

108
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,150
Your hair looks great up like that.
I really fits suits you.

109
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,270
You always look so beautiful...

110
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,510
...really fresh...

111
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,040
You have such a lovely smile.

112
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,190
- Arpège?
- Sir?

113
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,670
Really beautiful.

114
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:30,912
<i>...that a series of offensive missile sites...</i>

115
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,600
- Good morning, Don.
- Good morning, George.

116
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,030
Good morning, George.

117
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,550
Good morning, Grant.

118
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,800
You look awful.
What have you been doing?

119
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,470
Look around you, Grant.

120
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,550
Most of these students aspire to
nothing more than corporate job...

121
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,030
...and a desire to raise coke-drinking,
TV-watching children...

122
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,350
...who as soon as they can
speak start chanting TV jingles...

123
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,430
...and smashing things with hammers.
- You're really scaring me today, George.

124
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,441
Don't tell me. You have
easy time with these students.

125
00:19:14,476 --> 00:19:17,160
I found them staring at me
in a kind of bovine stupor...

126
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,750
...as if I were lecturing in
a foreign language.

127
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,200
Remind me why we shouldn't
all just be annihilated.

128
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,719
You seem to think this is all a joke.

129
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:25,427
We're living in a world where
nuclear war is a real threat.

130
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:27,401
I don't understand how
that doesn't concern you.

131
00:19:27,436 --> 00:19:29,110
You're serious, aren't you?

132
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,030
Yes, I'm serious.

133
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,270
George did you even read the article
I gave you on bomb shelters?

134
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,101
Our is almost done. We had 3
contractors work on it...

135
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:36,696
...so none of them know what we've got.

136
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,640
I'm having the outside of it landscaped
so no one will that it's there.

137
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,550
Really?

138
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:45,646
If word gets out that
you've got a better shelter...

139
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:47,790
...then everyone will try to get in
when something happens.

140
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,160
So?

141
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,230
There will be no time for sentiment
when the Russians fire a missile at us.

142
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:55,331
If it's going to be a world with
no time for sentiment Grant...

143
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:56,949
...the it's not a world
that I want to live in.

144
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,520
After Many a Summer Dies the Swan.

145
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,803
I think you've all...

146
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:54,081
...read the Huxley novel I assigned
more than three weeks ago?

147
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,350
How does the title relate to our story?

148
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,310
- Yes, Mr. Mong.
- It doesn't.

149
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,110
It's about a rich guy who's too
afraid that he's too old for this girl...

150
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,000
...and thinks that a young guy...

151
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,670
Russ.

152
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,040
Russ?

153
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,950
Yes, Mr. Hirsch.

154
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,430
Sir, on page 79, Mr. Propter says that...

155
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,120
...the stupidest text in the Bible is
“they hated me without a cause.”

156
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,861
Does that mean the Nazis were
right to hate the Jews?

157
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:23,040
- Is Huxley an anti-Semite?
- No.

158
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,720
No, Mr. Huxley is not an anti-Semite.

159
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,684
Of course, the Nazis were
wrong to hate the Jews.

160
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,722
But their hating the Jews
was not without a cause.

161
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,190
It's just that the cause wasn't real.

162
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,110
The cause was imagined.

163
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,800
The cause was fear.

164
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,920
Let's leave the Jews out o
this just for a moment.

165
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,310
Let's think of another minority.
One that...

166
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,520
One that can go unnoticed if it needs to.

167
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,350
There are all sorts of minorities,
blondes for example...

168
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,560
...or people with freckles.

169
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,670
But a minority is only
thought of as one...

170
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,960
...when it constitutes some kind of
threat to the majority.

171
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,400
A real threat or an imagined one.

172
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,710
And therein lies the fear.

173
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,640
If the minority is somehow invisible...

174
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,350
...and the fear is much greater.

175
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,257
That fear is why the
minority is persecuted.

176
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:34,749
So, you see there always is a cause.

177
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:35,888
The cause is fear.

178
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,040
Minorities are just people.

179
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,800
People like us.

180
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,870
I can see that I've lost you a bit.

181
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,950
So tell you what? We're gonna
forget about Mr. Huxley today...

182
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,600
...and we're gonna talk about fear.

183
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,720
Fear, after all, is our real enemy.

184
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,800
Fear is taking over our world.

185
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,590
Fear is being used as a tool of
manipulation in our society.

186
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,120
It's how politicians peddle policy.

187
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,870
It's how Madison Avenue sells us
things that we don't need.

188
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,470
Think about it.

189
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,240
Fear of being attacked.

190
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,800
Fear of that there are communists
lurking around every corner.

191
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,947
Fear of that some little
Caribbean country...

192
00:24:23,982 --> 00:24:26,392
...that doesn't believe in our way
of life poses a threat to us.

193
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,575
Fear that black culture
may take over the world.

194
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,600
Fear of Elvis Presley's hips.

195
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,830
Actually, maybe that one is a real fear.

196
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,000
Fear that our bad breath
might ruin our friendships.

197
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,040
Fear of growing old and being alone.

198
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,200
The of that we're useless and that
no one cares what we have to say.

199
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,190
Have a good weekend.

200
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,030
Sir! May I talk to you for a minute?

201
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,760
Why don't you always
talk to us like that?

202
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,590
I don't think it went over very well.

203
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,830
Man, fear of things gets
to me all the time.

204
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,750
But you can't talk about it with
anyone or you just sound like a fool.

205
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,520
- You can't even talk about it with Lois?
- I don't think she's afraid of anything.

206
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,510
Everyone's afraid of something, Kenny.

207
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,320
What are you afraid of, sir?

208
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,040
Cars.

209
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,502
How can you live in Los Angeles
and be afraid of cars?

210
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:34,667
Maybe you can't.

211
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:39,190
Sometimes my fear of things
can almost paralyze me.

212
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,350
It's like I get really panic stricken and
I feel like I might explode or something.

213
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,790
- May I ask you a personal question, sir?
- If you like.

214
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,680
Do you ever get high?

215
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,270
- How old do I look to you?
- Have you ever taken any drugs?

216
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,990
Of course, Kenny.

217
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,670
Like what?

218
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,750
I don't feel I should be discussing this
with you on campus Mr. Potter.

219
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,960
It's the only way I get by sometimes.

220
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,350
- Have you ever tried mescaline?
- Not my drug of choice.

221
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,230
I shaved off one of my eyebrows once
on mescaline. Not a good look for me.

222
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,960
- Sir?
- I looked in the mirror.

223
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,710
Big mistake if you're high on mescaline.

224
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,360
I decided that my eyebrows
were taking over my face.

225
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,687
Before I knew it, I had shaved one off.

226
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:23,371
I wore a band-aid over my eye for about
six weeks while my brow grew back.

227
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:24,230
Very embarrassing.

228
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,360
- You didn't take it again after that?
- Kenny, have you been listening to me?

229
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,670
I shaved off my eyebrow.

230
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,670
I wanted an experience Mr. Potter,
not a career on stage.

231
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,350
If you ever want to get high sir,
I usually have some dope.

232
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,430
You're really mad aren't you?

233
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,583
I'm sorry, sir. I guess you don't feel
very comfortable talking like this.

234
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:53,031
What makes you say that?

235
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,430
Lois thinks you're kind of cagey.
Like this morning...

236
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,350
...when you were listening to all that
crap we were talking about Huxley.

237
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,480
Well, not all of you.

238
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,520
I didn't notice you open
your mouth once.

239
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,240
I was watching you.

240
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,840
You let us ramble on and on
and then you straighten us out.

241
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,120
But you never really tell us
everything you know about something.

242
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,270
Well, maybe that's true up to a point.

243
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,320
It's not that I want to be cagey.

244
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,350
It's just that I can't really discuss
things completely openly...

245
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,670
...at school.

246
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,800
Someone would misunderstand.

247
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,470
I tried that today.
It didn't really work out.

248
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,950
What was it you wanted to get, sir?

249
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,270
Nothing. I was on my way
to the dean's office.

250
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,920
You mean you walked all the way
down here just to talk to me?

251
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,830
- Why not?
- Well...

252
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,910
I think you deserve
something for that, sir.

253
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,990
Here sir, take your pick.

254
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,880
- It's on me.
- Thank you.

255
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,960
I thought you'd probably pick blue.

256
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,880
- Why blue?
- Isn't blue supposed to be spiritual?

257
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,600
What makes you think I'm spiritual?

258
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,350
And you? Red?

259
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,790
- What is red stand for?
- A lot of things.

260
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,790
Rage, lust.

261
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,360
No kidding?

262
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,240
Well sir, I...

263
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,750
I guess I see you around.

264
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,870
Hello?

265
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,630
What are you up to, kiddo?

266
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,320
Just trying to finish up a book.
How's your day going?

267
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,520
Fine.

268
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,160
I was just leaving school and wanted to
know if you needed anything for tonight.

269
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,360
Thanks, you're sweet.

270
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,560
But I think I'm all set.

271
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,990
Be a darling and...

272
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,030
...pick up gin for me, Tangueray.
I love the color of the bottle.

273
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,550
You love what's in it.
What time do you want me?

274
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,030
7 would be great if that's ok with you.

275
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,790
Perfect. I'll see you then.

276
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,790
I'll see you then.
Bye, Geo.

277
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,000
Bye, kiddo.

278
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,590
Beautiful.

279
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,760
- Yes, Mr. Potter?
- Are you going somewhere, sir?

280
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,670
That is usually why people
get into their cars.

281
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,875
No, I mean are you going on
vacation or something?

282
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,110
- What?
- I saw you cleaning out your office.

283
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,910
What exactly is it that you want, Kenny?

284
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,030
I was just hoping that perhaps we could get
together for a drink or something sometime.

285
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,430
Why is that?

286
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,080
I don't know, sir.

287
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,760
Because I think you might like it.
And...

288
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,070
...because you seem as though
you could use a friend.

289
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,600
- Oh really?
- Yes, sir. You do.

290
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,960
They may be right.

291
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,960
It will have to be another time.
I'm late.

292
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,720
But thank you for the invitation.

293
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,080
And thank you for the talk earlier.

294
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,470
And stay away from the mescaline.

295
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,040
Hello, Mr. Falconer.

296
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,400
- Hello. How are you today?
- I'm fine, sir.

297
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,920
- Do you need to get into your box?
- Yes, I do.

298
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,280
Follow me.

299
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,760
Here you are, sir.

300
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,840
If you could please sign here...

301
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

302
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,870
So explain your friend Charlotte to me.

303
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,040
What would you like to know?

304
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,560
I don't know.
You seem very intimate I guess.

305
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,640
Like you were once
together or something.

306
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,840
- You haven't slept with her, have you?
- Yes.

307
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,590
And?

308
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,990
A few times when we were young.

309
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:07,931
I wouldn't say that it
meant nothing to me...

310
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:10,521
...but it certainly meant
a great deal more to Charley.

311
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,670
It was a long time ago in London.

312
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,390
I love Charley.

313
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,360
- And We were very close friends
but that's all. - Well, I'm confused.

314
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,600
If you sleep with women
then why are you with me?

315
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,670
Because I fall in love with men.

316
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,750
Because I fell in love with you.

317
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,160
Anyway, doesn't everyone sleep with
women when they're young?

318
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,680
- I haven't.
- You're joking.

319
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,910
No, I'm not.

320
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,783
It was just never anything
that interested me.

321
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:40,631
Well, you're awfully
modern aren't you?

322
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,600
You know, I think that was the first
thing that I noticed about you...

323
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,880
...was how sure of yourself you were.

324
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,190
How can you be so sure about
everything at your age?

325
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,080
You think I'm sure of myself?

326
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,120
Of course, you are.

327
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,950
I'm finished now.
Thank you.

328
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,230
Yes, Mr. Falconer?

329
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,040
Is there something else we
can help you with today?

330
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,430
I can't find my check book
and I need some cash.

331
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,750
Not my day I'm afraid.
Excuse me a minute.

332
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,680
Mommy says bushy eyebrows are pedestrian,
but I think yours are pretty.

333
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,880
I think yours are pretty too.

334
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,870
Why do you look so sad?
Would you like to meet Charlton Heston?

335
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,800
Ben Hur.

336
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,390
He's our scorpion.

337
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,470
Every night we throw in something
new to him and watch him kill it.

338
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,710
Daddy says it's like the colosseum. So my
brother Tom put on all the columns in here.

339
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,440
He wants to be a set designer.

340
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,096
He hasn't eaten the spider yet...

341
00:37:59,131 --> 00:38:01,855
...cause he's still full from
the moth we gave him last night.

342
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,590
Daddy says he wants to throw
you in to the colosseum.

343
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,800
No kidding?
Why?

344
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,710
He says you're light in your loafers...

345
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,760
...but you aren't even wearing loafers.

346
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,880
I think my brother Tom is
light in his loafers too...

347
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,270
...but he wears Keds.

348
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,160
He made me do a hair conditioning
treatment on my hair with eggs.

349
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,640
Does it look shiny?

350
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,000
Sweetheart, what are you doing
bothering Mr. Falconer?

351
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,640
She's not bothering me at all Susan.
How are you?

352
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,080
I'm glad to see you George.

353
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,735
George, we're having a few people
over tonight for drinks...

354
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,521
...and would love to have you
join us if you could.

355
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,280
- Thank you. That's very kind of you but I
have plans. - Another time then.

356
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,830
Jennifer, let's let Mr. Falconer get
back to his banking.

357
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,150
Goodbye, George.

358
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,040
Bye, Susan.
Bye, Jennifer.

359
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,920
- May I help you, sir? - I'd like to buy
some bullets for this gun, please.

360
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,680
Yes, sir.
This is a really old gun, sir.

361
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,990
We have a two for one sale on
handguns at the moment.

362
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,150
- Perhaps one for the little lady?
- No thank you. Just the bullets, please.

363
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,760
- Here you go. Anything else?
- No, thank you.

364
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,800
That would be $2.29, sir.

365
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,960
Thank you.

366
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,120
I'm sorry. I hope she
didn't growl at you.

367
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,320
She goes a little crazy sometimes when
I have to leave her in the car.

368
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,150
She's perfect.
What's her name?

369
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,990
India.

370
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,590
Let's go there.

371
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,390
You little baby.

372
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,040
I used to have smooth fox terriers.
You don't see them very often.

373
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,750
The very smell of buttered toast.

374
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,350
She's still a puppy isn't she?

375
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,790
Well.

376
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,000
- Have a nice evening.
- You too.

377
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,400
Good night, India.

378
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,390
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, It's ok.

379
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,680
- It's my fault. I'll get you another pack.
- It's ok. Don't worry.

380
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,640
No, no I insist.

381
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,800
Thank you.

382
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,550
I'm sorry about the broken glass.

383
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,000
- Here you go.
- Thanks man.

384
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,120
You want one?

385
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,790
No, thanks.

386
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,560
Actually, yes.
Why not?

387
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,350
Thank you.

388
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,440
- Carlos.
- What did you say?

389
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,910
Carlos. You asked me my name.

390
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,880
Are you okay?

391
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,630
Yeah.

392
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,960
Yeah, I'm sorry.

393
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:26,614
You're really something.

394
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:29,199
You have an incredible face.

395
00:42:29,497 --> 00:42:32,010
Enjoy that. It's a great gift.

396
00:42:32,057 --> 00:42:33,439
Your Spanish is perfect.

397
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,840
Thank you.

398
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,390
I should have used it more.

399
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,874
Well...

400
00:42:42,114 --> 00:42:43,900
It's not too late.

401
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,150
What are you doing?

402
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,390
Aren't we going somewhere?

403
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,200
No. But, thanks.

404
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:25,645
You know, it's the smog that
makes it that color.

405
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,760
I've never seen a sky like this before.

406
00:43:29,152 --> 00:43:32,741
Sometimes awful things have
their own kind of beauty.

407
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,950
Could I have another cigarette?

408
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,550
Sure.

409
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,360
- Are sure that you don't want to go
for a drive? - I'm sure.

410
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,550
- Where are you from?
- Madrid.

411
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,240
Madrid?
How did you get here?

412
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,070
It's a long story.

413
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,120
I met a guy from LA at the
hotel where I worked...

414
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,560
...who told me I could live with him
and that he could get me an agent.

415
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,200
But he never realized that
I have a Spanish accent.

416
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,950
I like your accent.
You speak very well.

417
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:40,000
- How did you learn English? - My mom had
an American boyfriend when I was little.

418
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,150
Is your mother in Madrid?

419
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,600
Yes, she is.
She cuts hair.

420
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,880
She cut my hair before I left.
Do you like it?

421
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,840
- I thought it made me look like James Dean.
- You are better than James Dean.

422
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,320
Really?

423
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,910
Thanks.

424
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,670
No one has ever picked me up
and not wanted something.

425
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,350
I think you picked me up.

426
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,040
This is kind of a serious day for me.

427
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,320
Come on. What could be
so serious for a guy like you?

428
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,550
I'm just trying to get over
an old love I guess.

429
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,440
My mother says that
lovers are like buses.

430
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,160
You just have to wait a little while
and another one comes along.

431
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,230
I have to go.

432
00:45:34,551 --> 00:45:35,725
You're a nice guy.

433
00:45:36,044 --> 00:45:37,629
I hope you find...

434
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,499
...someone like you.

435
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,270
Thanks.

436
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,670
I'm going away.

437
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,800
It's your turn to change it.

438
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,400
Yeah, I'm not changing it.
It's your turn.

439
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,790
Besides, you never like
what I put on anyway.

440
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,680
I'll give you five dollars if you
change it. I'm too old to get up.

441
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,670
You're only old when it's
convenient for you to be old.

442
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,400
What are you reading anyway?

443
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,790
Oh God. Not that depressing crap again.

444
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,440
It's for my class.

445
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,960
What highbrow work of fiction
might you be reading?

446
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,640
Don't be so smug.

447
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,680
Man, what a life he has.

448
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,720
- Don't you just envy him?
- Why?

449
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,760
Because he can sniff
anyone's arse he wants?

450
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,910
Nice.

451
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,790
No, because he just does what he wants.
Like yesterday...

452
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,760
...I was standing in the front yard
and Susan came over to talk.

453
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,200
And that little brat of hers
Christopher came...

454
00:47:28,235 --> 00:47:30,311
...running over waving that
damned gun of his around.

455
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,360
And our little dog walked
right up, hiked his leg...

456
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,880
...and peed all over Christopher's
new tennis shoes.

457
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,480
All over Christopher actually.

458
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,950
And of course, I had
to act like I was upset

459
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,950
It was so perfectly executed
you should have seen it.

460
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,710
After all the times those kids
have tortured that poor dog.

461
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,120
I mean, you should take a
lesson from him. They don't...

462
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,760
They don't stay up all night worrying.

463
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,390
They figured out how to get the two
of us to do exactly what they want.

464
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,037
They are basically very sophisticated
little parasites when you think about it.

465
00:48:02,072 --> 00:48:05,720
Well, the dumbest creatures are the
happiest. Just look at your mother.

466
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,640
He's really just living the moment.

467
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,280
It's like now.

468
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,880
What could be better than
being tucked up here with you?

469
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,960
If I died right now it would be OK.

470
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,880
Well, it wouldn't be OK with me so why don't
you shut up and go change the record.

471
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,800
Good answer.

472
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:36,966
You know what? I was thinking
about taking them up...

473
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:39,841
...to Denver with me next week
if it's okay with you.

474
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,390
It's my mom.
She loves them.

475
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,760
Probably that recognition
of a similar mind.

476
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,000
You stay there, old man.

477
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,150
No, I did not forget the gin.
I'll see you in ten minutes.

478
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,360
Christopher, would you
like it if I killed you?

479
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:16,490
I don't know.

480
00:53:16,525 --> 00:53:19,000
If you keep this up
we're going to find out.

481
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,040
So, why don't you go home
and stop shooting people?

482
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,440
I'm so happy to see you.

483
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,030
Come on in.

484
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,400
It smells wonderful.
I'm very hungry. Where is Lois?

485
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,040
I gave her the night off.
I'm cooking myself.

486
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,190
- You are?
- Yes, I'm trying something new.

487
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,000
- Charley darling, ''you cooking' is new.
- Don't be smart.

488
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,800
I'm in a good mood tonight.
I'm going to be fun.

489
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,440
I've already made two
New Year's resolutions.

490
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,739
Resolution one: No more talk
that of awful ex-husbands...

491
00:54:21,774 --> 00:54:23,601
..and children who don't give a damn.

492
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,910
- And the other one?
- One what?

493
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,640
Resolution.

494
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,400
Resolution two: More smoking and more
drinking and screw it all! So come on...

495
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,880
...mix me up a drink.

496
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,870
I'll have a gin and tonic, please.

497
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,000
- And watch out baby!
- Coming up.

498
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:45,680
- It was sweet of you to come tonight.
- Sweet had nothing to do with it.

499
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,560
- I needed to see you.
- Come off it.

500
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,790
Whenever you do something sweet
you're too ashamed to admit it.

501
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,840
Here is to our early
New Year's resolutions.

502
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,710
Cheers.

503
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,990
What are your resolutions by the way?

504
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,270
To let go of the past completely,
entirely, and forever.

505
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,960
Light me up, will you?

506
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,470
Darling, you don’t look well.

507
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,225
Do you remember that little
heart attack you had last year?

508
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,481
- It wasn’t a heart attack.
- Well whatever it was darling...

509
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,310
...you don’t look so hot.

510
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,550
I’m fine.
I never felt better.

511
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,430
- I'm a little tired. I haven't
been sleeping... - Geo, it's normal.

512
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,350
You were with Jim for 16 years.

513
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,040
I think about Richard every day.

514
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,790
It’s hard being alone.

515
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,160
At least you have a job and a life.

516
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,710
Let’s have a bit of dinner shall we?

517
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:58,030
Because I’ve worked so very hard.

518
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,400
- What are you talking about? - Seriously,
there no such thing as old anymore.

519
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,320
The other day one of my students
has called me a senior citizen.

520
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,230
I wouldn't mind if old didn't exist...

521
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:11,191
...but I'm not sure senior is
what I'm aiming for either.

522
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,720
It's all becoming so bland.
It's not why I came to America.

523
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,000
It's like a complete breakdown
of culture and manners.

524
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,680
The young ones have no manners.

525
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,670
The other day at the car wash
a young man looked me up and down...

526
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,040
...and actually asked me if I
was a natural blonde.

527
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,030
- What did you say?
- I looked him straight in the eye...

528
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,670
...and said: ''Let's just say
if I stood on my head...

529
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,400
...I would be a natural
brunette with lovely breath.”

530
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,440
- You didn't!
- I did!

531
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,950
And the amusing thing was
that it went right over his head!

532
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,430
You know, you had a mouth on you
even back in London.

533
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,040
Do you remember that old lesbian
who threw her drink over your head...

534
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,720
...because you asked her if
she was hung like a donut.

535
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,200
Geo.

536
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,670
We could always go back to London.
The two of us.

537
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,200
- No, thanks.
- You know you miss it.

538
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,190
I miss it sometimes.

539
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,510
Maybe if Jim had lived.

540
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,400
He loved being in England. He asked us
to stay the last time we were there.

541
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,870
Do you really think you
would have moved?

542
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,520
I don't know. It's silly to even talk
about it. It was only a fantasy.

543
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,190
What's this?

544
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,320
It's my mother's wedding ring.

545
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,390
I found it a drawer
when I was cleaning out.

546
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,720
Charley my dear, you and I are
both in need of another drink.

547
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,680
Wait!
Wait, wait!

548
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,750
I love this!

549
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,120
- You're insane!
- Come on, old man!

550
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,110
Don't move.

551
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,870
Thank you.

552
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,200
- Very smooth cigarette move.
- I've always wanted to do that.

553
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,030
You don't even smoke.

554
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,560
Well, not for the last
sixteen years. Jim hated it.

555
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,270
What's to stop me now?
It's not as if he's gonna to kill me.

556
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,840
This is so nice, lying here with you.

557
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,457
Don't you ever miss this?

558
01:01:32,418 --> 01:01:34,567
What we could have been to each other?

559
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,840
Having a real relationship and kids?

560
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,200
- I had Jim.
- I know, but I mean a real relationship.

561
01:01:46,098 --> 01:01:50,040
Geo, let's be honest, what you and Jim
had together was wonderful but...

562
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:54,000
...wasn't it really just a
substitute for something else?

563
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,840
Is that really what you think
after all of these years?

564
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,150
You think Jim was just some
kind of substitute for real love?

565
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,190
Jim was not a substitute for anything.

566
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,680
Do you understand?

567
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,768
There is no substitute for Jim...

568
01:02:17,803 --> 01:02:19,590
...anywhere!

569
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,366
And by the way, what is so real
about your relationship with Richard?

570
01:02:22,401 --> 01:02:25,230
He left you after nine years!

571
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,296
Jim and I were together
for sixteen years!

572
01:02:28,331 --> 01:02:30,550
And if he hadn't died we
would still be together!

573
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,120
What the hell is not real about that?

574
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,640
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

575
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,240
I know how much the two
of you loved each other.

576
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,710
I suppose I'm just jealous that
you and I never had that kind of love.

577
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,760
Actually, I've never had that
kind of love with anybody.

578
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,760
I don't think Richard ever loved me...

579
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:53,262
...except for the way I looked.

580
01:02:54,202 --> 01:02:55,140
And Clay...

581
01:02:55,175 --> 01:02:57,304
I don't know. You raise
a child and love it...

582
01:02:57,339 --> 01:02:59,308
...and then when they are
old enough they just leave.

583
01:03:00,214 --> 01:03:01,974
Charley, there is nothing
wrong with your life.

584
01:03:02,085 --> 01:03:04,888
You just like feeling sorry for yourself.
It's one of your great pleasures.

585
01:03:04,923 --> 01:03:06,910
And it's not one of yours?

586
01:03:07,028 --> 01:03:08,895
You're as pathetic as I am.

587
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:11,768
Feeling sorry for myself is definitely
not one of my great pleasures.

588
01:03:11,803 --> 01:03:14,884
Well, it's not one of mine either. I don't
like feeling sorry for myself one bit.

589
01:03:14,919 --> 01:03:16,630
I tried to hold onto
Richard for so long...

590
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,760
...even when it was obvious to
everyone but me that it was over.

591
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,238
And now Clay is grown up.

592
01:03:20,273 --> 01:03:22,680
I mean, what am I doing here Geo?
Tell me, what?

593
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,990
You have plenty of friends.
You'll be fine.

594
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,638
Yes, I have friends.
But none of them need me.

595
01:03:27,673 --> 01:03:31,130
And yes I have you and if you weren't such a
goddamn poof we could have all been happy!

596
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,830
I only have you now
because you lost Jim.

597
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,960
Soon I'll lose you to someone else.
It's not as easy for a woman.

598
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,796
I've done everything the way
I was supposed to and...

599
01:03:44,831 --> 01:03:46,960
...all I have to keep me
company is a bottle of gin.

600
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,073
Maybe you should try
donuts with your gin.

601
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,200
Screw you.

602
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,430
Charlotte, you are dramatic.

603
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,810
I swear you really almost had me.

604
01:03:58,845 --> 01:04:02,641
A tiny tear was beginning to
form in the corner of my eye.

605
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,280
Now stop it.

606
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,240
You are still
breathtakingly beautiful.

607
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,382
When you can be bothered
to get up and out of bed...

608
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:13,361
...and you stop whimpering about
everything for five minutes.

609
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,870
Go to London.
Change your life.

610
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,320
If you're not happy being a woman
then stop acting like one.

611
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,800

You have all the answers.

612
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,400
No, I don't have any to mention.

613
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,230
If you're so smart why don't you
have something new in your life?

614
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,500
Take that position at Stanford.

615
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:31,400
You complain about that little school
but you could go anywhere you want.

616
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:33,790
I think what I've done
has been worthwhile.

617
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,030
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

618
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,190
I shouldn't have said that.

619
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,590
As much as I dread it, I think
I will go back to London.

620
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,510
Why do you dread it?

621
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,990
When I lived in London last I was
young. I was fresh, I was everything.

622
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,790
Coming to America was such a dream,
it was the icing on the cake.

623
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,160
Going home is defeat.

624
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,760
None of it really worked
out the way I'd planned.

625
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,720
Most things don't work out
the way people plan.

626
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,600
You're just living in the past. You need
to start thinking about your future.

627
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,640
Living in the past is my future.

628
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:11,240
It doesn't have to be yours.
You're a man.

629
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,670
And you're a bore tonight.

630
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,870
Can't we just feel sorry for
ourselves a little bit longer?

631
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,659
Let's have another drink.

632
01:05:20,694 --> 01:05:23,641
- I don't think so. I have to go. Come on.
Walk me out. - Please, please!

633
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,117
- Come on, I have to!
- No, this was such fun! No.

634
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,550
When will I see you again?

635
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,830
- Aren't you going to England?
- I'll never do that!

636
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,800
It's far too much effort.

637
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:49,470
Besides, I don't think Jim would want me
to leave you here in LA all alone.

638
01:05:50,096 --> 01:05:53,455
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.
I've got all the answers. Remember?

639
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,080
What are you doing this weekend?

640
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,840
I think I might just be very quiet.

641
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,960
You never really did take me
seriously, did you George?

642
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,030
I tried to Charley. Remember?
A long time ago.

643
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,600
It didn't really work out, did it?

644
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,150
No, Charley.

645
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,400
Sleep tight.

646
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,760
Patrick, a beer and a
packet of Lucky Strike, please.

647
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:52,962
Excuse me.

648
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,680
It's too hot in there.

649
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,160
Yes, it is.

650
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,800
- Would you like a cigarette?
- No thanks, I don't smoke.

651
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,120
- This place is really crowded.
- Well, it is Saturday night.

652
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,694
It's usually as bad as this.

653
01:08:21,729 --> 01:08:25,640
People normally just stop by and pick
someone up and then head on down the beach.

654
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,630
Yeah. It's pretty wild out there.

655
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,390
I'm surprised the cops
don't break it up.

656
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,920
- Is it always like that?
- Since the war ended.

657
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,357
It's pretty great actually.
It's kind of pagan.

658
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,840
- I'm Jim.
- I'm George.

659
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,953
Pleased to meet you Jim.

660
01:08:40,988 --> 01:08:44,071
I'm sorry, I'm supposed to meet some
friends but I can't find them.

661
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:48,600
I just needed to get out of the house
but the lure of a cold beer got to me.

662
01:08:49,247 --> 01:08:50,422
Do you live hereby?

663
01:08:50,457 --> 01:08:51,990
Canyon.

664
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,150
- For how long?
- Since 38.

665
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,310
- Where are you from?
- Colorado.

666
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,862
I really like it here.
It's close to beach.

667
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,830
I think I might stay after
I'm discharged.

668
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,430
I don't know, maybe
I'm a bit of a pagan.

669
01:09:12,768 --> 01:09:14,496
- After you.
- No.

670
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,190
Sorry.

671
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,680
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

672
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,310
Do you buy me a drink?

673
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,830
I think I'm taken.

674
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,070
Too bad, too bad.

675
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,880
Do you want another beer?

676
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:46,040
Patrick, a bottle of scotch and
a pack of Lucky Strikes to go, please?

677
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,070
Patrick, cancel that.

678
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,070
Well, hello Mr. Potter.

679
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,120
Hello, sir.

680
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,950
- What are we drinking?
- Scotch.

681
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:17,910
Okay.

682
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,550
I come here all the time. I live just
around the corner, but then you knew that.

683
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,360
On Camphor Tree Lane.

684
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,160
You're still carrying that around.

685
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,560
One must always appreciate
life's little gifts.

686
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,560
So, what are you doing here?

687
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,253
- Just out for a ride on my bike.
- Is that all?

688
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,430
I don't know.

689
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,110
Were you looking for me?

690
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,870
Maybe. I don't know.

691
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,310
I feel like my head's
stopped up with stuff.

692
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,539
What kind of stuff?

693
01:12:01,574 --> 01:12:03,926
Like, the stuff you were talking
about today in class.

694
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:05,671
That is definitely not important.

695
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,150
No, it is important.
Your class is great.

696
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:12,600
But somehow we always seem
to get stuck talking about the past.

697
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,240
The past just doesn't matter to me.

698
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,000
- The present?
- I can't wait for the present to be over.

699
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,990
It's a total drag.

700
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,920
Well, tonight is the exception.

701
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,150
What?

702
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,120
Tonight, yes!
The present, no!

703
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,160
Let's drink to tonight.

704
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,360
Tonight.

705
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,207
So if the past doesn't matter and
the present is a total drag.

706
01:12:37,242 --> 01:12:39,071
What about the future?

707
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:42,680
What future?
Cuba might just blow us up.

708
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,324
Death is the future.

709
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:46,174
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be depressing.

710
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,385
It's not depressing.
It's not depressing, it's true.

711
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:51,386
It may not be your immediate future
but it's what we all share.

712
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,470
Death is the future.

713
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,550
You're right, I guess.

714
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,536
If one is not enjoying one's present
there isn't a great deal to...

715
01:12:58,571 --> 01:13:00,518
...suggest that the future
should be any better.

716
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:02,936
Yeah, I've thought that before.

717
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,790
But the thing is you just never know.

718
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,870
Look at tonight.

719
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,480
Actually...

720
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,950
...I feel really alone most of the time.

721
01:13:17,497 --> 01:13:19,110
- You do?
- Yeah.

722
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,656
I've always felt this way.

723
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:24,990
I mean we're born alone, we die alone.

724
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:29,440
And while we're here we are absolutely,
completely sealed in our own bodies.

725
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,070
Really weird.

726
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,680
Kinda freaks me out to think about it.

727
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,470
We can only experience the outside world
through our own slanted perception of it.

728
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,190
Who knows what you're really like?

729
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:48,480
- I just see what I think you're like.
- I'm exactly what I appear to be.

730
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,400
If you look closely.

731
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,310
You know the only thing that has made
the whole thing worthwhile...

732
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,800
...has been those...

733
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:09,630
...few times that I've been able to really,
truly connect with another human being.

734
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,670
I had a hunch about you, sir.

735
01:14:15,047 --> 01:14:16,590
- You did?
- Yes, sir.

736
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,040
I had a hunch you might
be a real romantic.

737
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,990
You know, everyone
keeps telling you that...

738
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,759
...when you're older, that you'll
have all this experience.

739
01:14:30,794 --> 01:14:32,464
Like it's some great thing.

740
01:14:32,499 --> 01:14:33,914
That's a load of shit.

741
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:36,622
I think I've actually just
gotten sillier and sillier.

742
01:14:36,657 --> 01:14:38,800
- Really?
- Absolutely.

743
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,550
So, all your experience is useless.

744
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,750
No, I wouldn't say that.

745
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,563
As our friend Mr. Huxley says:
Experience is not what happens to a man.

746
01:14:48,598 --> 01:14:51,327
It is what a man does
with what happens to him.

747
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,880
- Let's go swimming.
- Okay.

748
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,960
- What?
- It was a test.

749
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,680
I thought you were
bluffing about being silly so...

750
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,470
...I said to myself I'll suggest doing
something completely outrageous.

751
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,760
And if he resists, if he even hesitates
then I know he's full of shit.

752
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,550
Well, I wasn't.
Were you?

753
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,160
Hell, no!

754
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,400
Come on sir.
I'll help you down.

755
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,680
Let's go.

756
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,680
Come on, sir.

757
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,670
Sir?

758
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,840
Sir?

759
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,790
That's enough for now, sir.

760
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,000
- I'm fine.
- I'm cold. Come on.

761
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,590
Can we go back to your place, sir?

762
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,120
Of course.
Where else?

763
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,320
- Where else.
- Are you out of your mind?

764
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,190
- What's the matter?
- You can't get home like that!

765
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,080
We're invisible, don't you know that?

766
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,518
You know sir, they ought not
to let you out on your own.

767
01:17:47,758 --> 01:17:49,590
You're liable to get into real trouble.

768
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,030
I excel at it.

769
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,080
Your forehead is bleeding.

770
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,520
The bathroom is just down the hall
if you would like to take a shower.

771
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,880
Aren't you taking a shower too, sir?

772
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,190
I'm fine. I'm English.
We like to be cold and wet.

773
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,650
First, I think that we need
to take care of that cut, sir.

774
01:18:28,685 --> 01:18:30,137
Do you have any band-aids?

775
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,058
- Going camping, sir?
- I'm fine, really.

776
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,160
Stay there.
I'll be right back.

777
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,070
Sit up.

778
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,320
Tilt your head back.

779
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,612
Well sir, I'm afraid this
time you don't have...

780
01:19:53,647 --> 01:19:56,337
...the excuse of mescaline
to explain your band-aid.

781
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,600
I think we should get you
out of those wet clothes.

782
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,470
Yes, sir.

783
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,750
- You're not too cold?
- I'm great.

784
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,590
- Would you like a drink?
- A beer, sir. If you have one.

785
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,430
I'm afraid that's all we have.

786
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,110
Two beers coming up.

787
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,480
- You live here all by yourself, sir?
- I do now.

788
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,390
I used to share this place with
a friend. He was an architect.

789
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:07,212
Man, guys my age dream about the
kind of setup you've got here.

790
01:22:07,247 --> 01:22:09,920
I mean, what more can you want?

791
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,390
You get to be left alone and
come and go as you please.

792
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,751
Is that's your idea of the perfect life?

793
01:22:16,786 --> 01:22:18,753
What's the matter, sir?
Don't you believe me?

794
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,304
If you're so keen on the
idea living by yourself...

795
01:22:21,339 --> 01:22:23,126
...where does Lois fit into this plan?

796
01:22:23,248 --> 01:22:26,296
Lois? What's she got to
do with anything?

797
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,874
I got the impression that you
and she were together.

798
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,200
Not really.
She is kind of cool and...

799
01:22:35,889 --> 01:22:37,720
...we're good friends but...

800
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,510
I think what you really want to
ask me is if we sleep together.

801
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,150
- And do you?
- We did. Once.

802
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:50,360
- Why only once?
- I didn't say only once, I said once.

803
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,230
Come on, the last thing I want to
talk about right now is Lois.

804
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,750
What time is it?

805
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,280
My watch seems to have stopped.

806
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,470
Do you want me to go?

807
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,870
You must be kidding.
Go, get us another beer.

808
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,200
Is that an order, sir?

809
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,061
You're damn right it is.

810
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,040
Pathetic.

811
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,200
Did you say something, sir?

812
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,870
Why are you here?

813
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:47,270
Why did you get to the office and
ask secretary for my address?

814
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:52,936
I just wanted to see you
someplace other than school.

815
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,710
Why?

816
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:02,508
Sometimes I think I'm crazy cause I see
things so differently than everyone else.

817
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,430
I feel like I can talk to you.

818
01:24:06,798 --> 01:24:09,720
To be honest sir, I was also
worried about you today.

819
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,910
Me?

820
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,670
What's to be worried about?

821
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,880
I'm fine.

822
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,070
I'm...

823
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,720
I'm fine.

824
01:27:10,864 --> 01:27:15,217
<i>A few times in my life I've had
moments of absolute clarity.</i>

825
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,968
<i>When for a few brief seconds...</i>

826
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,976
<i>...the silence drowns out the noise...</i>

827
01:27:23,011 --> 01:27:26,256
<i>...and I can feel rather than think.</i>

828
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,150
<i>And things seem so sharp...</i>

829
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,070
<i>And the world seems so fresh...</i>

830
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,760
<i>...as though it had all
just come into existence.</i>

831
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,068
<i>I can never make these moments last.</i>

832
01:27:59,106 --> 01:28:00,420
<i>I cling to them...</i>

833
01:28:00,455 --> 01:28:02,540
<i>...but like everything they fade.</i>

834
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,670
<i>I've lived my live on these moments.</i>

835
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,800
<i>They pull me back to the present...</i>

836
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:16,563
<i>...and I realize that everything is
exactly the way it was meant to be.</i>

837
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,036
<i>And just like that it came.</i>

838
01:30:40,784 --> 01:30:44,380
