<i>'cause this is about
to be a good one.</i>

00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:30,188
<i>Down here in New Orleans,
you know we know how to party.</i>

5
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,724
<i>And around here,
we like to say,</i>

6
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:33,593
"Laissez les
bons temps rouler."

7
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:38,363
<i>The wait is over.</i>

8
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,366
<i>A sold-out Superdome
is the stage.</i>

9
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:46,405
<i>After a year of partially
filled or empty stadiums,</i>

10
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:49,042

absolutely electric.</i>

13
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:55,280
<i>and it is the matchup
of our dreams.</i>

14
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:57,115
<i>We have the 13-1 Cougars</i>

15
00:00:57,249 --> 00:00:59,484
<i>going against
the undefeated Wolves,</i>

16
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:02,555

legends are made.</i>

17
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:05,490
[Nick Wright] <i>Wolves quarterback,
the Heisman Trophy winner LeMarcus James.</i>

18
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,560
<i>Possibly
the best quarterback</i>

19
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:10,262
<i>to come into the NFL
since Patrick Mahomes.</i>

20
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:12,732
[reporter] <i>And you know who
agrees with me on that? Miami.</i>

21
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,267
<i>'Cause they're poised to
take him number one overall,</i>

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,270
<i>and I'm hearing for about
$35 million guaranteed.</i>

23
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:20,073
<i>Meanwhile,
for the Cougars,</i>

24
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,841
<i>you have running back
Cecil Burgess,</i>

25

26

27
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:28,848
<i>200 to 400 yards

28

34
00:01:44,262 --> 00:01:46,966
<i>one of the best coaches

35

37

[Wright] <i>You have

38
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,144

- The poppin'?
- [bones popping]

48
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:07,080
Was an elbow-to-helmet with
Michigan State's Will backer.

49
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,381
I-right, simple, 68 blast.

[LeMarcus] Lead.

53
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:19,992
Hmm?

54
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:22,260
It was 1-41 lead.

55
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,832
Hmm, pretty sure...

56
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:29,334
If you were on the second level,
then you were lead blocking.

57
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:32,572
Michigan State ran a Chicago
53 with a robber in the box.

58
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,576
I mean, no way you got to
the Will back on the blast.

59
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,211
Hmm?

60
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,946
Could've been lead.

61
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,885
[LeMarcus sighs]

62
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:56,328
"The path

"Blessed is he who,

Hmm?

69
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:16,649
"For he is

00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,747
You stupid, man.

79
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:51,083
That was an Oscar-winning
performance.

80
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:52,618
Shit.

Yeah. On the iPad too.

86
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:11,137
We can still call
this whole thing off.

87
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,471
Chalk it up
as a research project.

88
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:17,043
Get some grad credits
out of it.

89
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:19,312
Hell, I think we'd be
halfway to our master's.

94
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:43,836
God, give us the wisdom to
see the path we must take,

95
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,005
and give us the courage
to brave it.

96
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,808
Make of us a light.

97
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,645
- Amen.
- Amen.

98
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:57,917
You're getting better
with that.

We're live.

102
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,710
We'd best
get a move-on then.

103
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:28,014
Coach's gonna become a heat-seeking
missile looking for you.

104
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:29,916
Yeah.

105
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,619

- Stop right there, Lukie.

- [keyboard clacks]
- Right there.

110
00:06:45,398 --> 00:06:47,967
This is what I'm talking about.
Simple stretch sweep to 34.

111
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,969
Lukie, zoom on 34.

112
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:54,573
There. Right ankle dominant cut
around the left corner.

113
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,409
The best running back
in the country

114
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,312
is turning the corner
on an inside ankle lead.

115
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:02,014
Why? 34's left ankle
ain't right.

116
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:03,916
It hasn't been
since week ten.

117
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,886
Okay, real quick.
Cecil scores on this play, right?

118
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:09,588
Yeah. Eighty-yard sprint,
where he outruns a free safety.

119
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:11,924
Yeah, against Vanderbilt,
I could outrun a free safety.

120
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:15,227
So here's what we do.
If we move Cornelius to the middle,

121
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:16,662
we pinch in the OLBs,

122
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:18,898
we got our safeties thinking
run support first.

123
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:20,866
Cornelius will
eat his lunch,

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,235
and we will shut 34 down
for the night.

125
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,537
I got you.

126
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,973
Boys. Booster club dinner.
Five minutes.

127
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:29,474
- Yeah, yeah, they can wait.
- No, they cannot wait.

128
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:31,410
They're the team owners.
You're the guest of honor.

129
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,379
Luke can babysit the film,
right, baby?

130
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:35,314
Tell you what. You can
come back here tonight.

131
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:37,917
You guys can touch and watch
film all night long. How's that?

132

Seventy-two hours till
the national goddamn title game,

133
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:43,089

in this dog-and-pony show.

134
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:45,224
Heavy is the head that wears
the crown, my Lord.

135
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:47,126
All right, look, I gotta
go get dressed, man,

136
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,462
get ready for this dog-and-pony
show, as you call it.

137
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,664
Seriously, you're not going
to back me up here at all?

138
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:53,632
No, I'm not.
I just do your defense.

139
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,469
That's your own offense.
That's your life offense.

140
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,503
- [laughs]
- Defense right here.

141
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:00,306
I made these short and
sweet, like you like it.

142
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,174
I suggest you do the same
with your jokes.

143
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:04,877
- My jokes are hilarious, and people love them.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

144
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:09,514
Stop.
Personal phone.

145
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:12,218
Give me the personal phone.
Luke gets the business phone.

146
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:14,053
Give him
the business phone.

147
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:15,988
Anything comes in,
you know where to find me.

148
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:18,391
You need to relax.
Let's enjoy the mountaintop.

149
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:21,394
I'll enjoy the mountaintop when we are
at the mountaintop. We're not there yet.

150
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:23,429
Let's go. Can we go?

151
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:24,897
Yes. Okay.

152
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:26,665
Lukie, set all staff
for 7:00 a.m.

153
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:29,335
Bed check on time.
On time.

154
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,736
Will do.

- What up, Scotty?
- Yo, what up, Orlando?

159
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:47,420
- Is Walton in there too?
- Yeah, he in the bathroom.

160
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:48,721
Let's get some rest.

161
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:50,289
- Talk to you later, man.
- For sure.

162

- [laughing, chattering]
- [bottles clink]

163
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:55,494
- Hey, Coach, check them back there for me.
- Sure.

That's bed check.

Yo, Scotty.

171
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:41,974
I'm already asleep, man.

172
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:44,043
Yeah. Sunday's snoring
like an ox.

173
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:46,278
Can you hear him?
[imitates snoring]

174
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:49,115
He broke his nose
so many times,

175
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:51,083
once he gets on his
back, I'm screwed.

176
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:54,286
Yeah. 8:00 a.m. sprints
in the bubble.

177
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,654
Got it.

178
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:58,290
- He buy it?
- Hell, yeah.

179
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:06,600
Thank God Snickers sponsored this
game and not some insurance company.

180
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:09,268
You hungry?

181
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,604
No.

182
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,608
[sighs]

183
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:26,952
- [laughter]
- [Coach Lazor] I'm telling you,

184
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:29,755
I know they don't have boosters
this good looking in the Big 12.

185
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:32,725
- [all laughing]
- I know the Cougars don't look this good.

186
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:36,362
We have built this program
into a juggernaut.

187
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:39,231
Two consecutive
conference championships,

188
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:41,200
two consecutive
play-off berths,

189
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,035
- and now...
- [audience applauding]

190
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:45,437
...for the first time
in program history,

191
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:50,142
we are headed to our first
national title game.

192
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:52,111
[cheering]

193
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:56,815
All of you in this room,

194
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,785
you have supported,
pushed and prodded,

195
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,388
and sometimes much,
much worse.

196
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:04,823
- [laughing]
- But I appreciate it.

197
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,059
That's how you grow.

198
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:10,597
And I appreciate the opportunity
to have presided over this,

199
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:14,534
to help young men
become champions

200
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:16,802
on and off
the football field.

201
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:18,270
Go, Pack!

202
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:20,406
[cheering]

203
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,510
- [music playing on speakers]
- [indistinct chattering]

204
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:32,918
You're seriously pressing
your bet again?

205
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:35,187
Half a million dollars?

206
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:37,591
Come on, Roger, you know me.
It's for the title.

207
00:11:37,723 --> 00:11:40,192
Go big or go home,
and I ain't fucking leaving.

208
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:43,395
Well, the apple sure didn't
fall far from the tree with you.

209
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,565
God bless
your daddy's soul.

210
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:49,034
- Old Fred used to like to bet the house in Vegas.
- [chuckles]

211
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:51,203
- He just liked the free drinks.
- Well, hear, hear.

212
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:53,607
Question is,
how in the glorious hell

213
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:55,374
are we gonna stop
Cecil Burgess?

214
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,209
Fastest I seen
since Herschel.

215
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:58,645
It's me,

216
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:00,446
I'm flooding the gaps,

217
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,514
bringing Mack
from the strong side

218
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:05,084
and feeding Cornelius
raw meat till kickoff.

219
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:07,453
Or we break in his room and Tonya
Harding that son of a bitch.

220
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:09,955
Now, aren't you sweet?
[chuckles]

221
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,957
Well, as long as we got
LeMarcus back there

222
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:14,260
firing bullets, we'll be fine...
better than fine.

223
00:12:14,393 --> 00:12:16,895
Coach, we was just talking
about LeMarcus.

224
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,197
LeMarcus who?

225
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,733
- [laughter]
- But I'll tell you what,

226
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,101
he was pretty raw
when we found him,

227
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:26,205
and obviously, he's developed into
something really, really special.

228
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:29,643
You think you can convince him he
ain't ready to jump for another year?

229
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:32,011
I'm just gonna support
whatever is best for LeMarcus.

230
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:33,879
- [Rodger] Amen.
- [Taylor] Coach, I got a kid in Little Rock.

231
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:35,948
Hell of an arm. Got to show
you some videos of him.

232
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:38,752
- [Coach Lazor] Love to see it.
- You remember the bad old days

233
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,819
when we were scraping
the bottom of the barrel,

234
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:44,456
begging JUCO transfers
with cases of Budweiser

235
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:46,091
and jobs
with the dealership?

236
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,127
[Coach Lazor]
Yeah, all too well.

237
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,329
- [Taylor] And all that changed once you got LeMarcus.
- [Rodger] Bullshit.

238
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:52,364
All that changed
when we got Coach here.

239
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:54,300
- Hey, Coach. Kevin McDonald.
- Hi, Kevin.

240
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:55,834
Director of Communication
for the CFP.

241
00:12:55,968 --> 00:12:57,570
Good to meet you,
and thanks for everything.

242
00:12:57,704 --> 00:13:01,040
Sure. Uh, we may have
a situation.

243
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:04,343
LeMarcus just tweeted this
earlier tonight.

244
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:08,447
It says he's boycotting
the game.

245
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:11,116
Reporters are
already swarming.

246
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,819
We're trying to keep them
off the players' floor.

247
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:16,623
Can probably do that
till morning,

248
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:18,692
but this can get
out of hand fast.

249
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:20,459
It won't.
Give me 20 minutes.

250
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,501
Guys, I'll see you right back.
[chuckles]

251
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,914
Hey.

252
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:44,684
Hi.

253
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:48,420
A poet at a football game.

254
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:51,890
Philosopher
at a football game.

255
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:54,159
- [both chuckle]
- Anyway...

256
00:13:57,229 --> 00:13:58,964
You look fantastic.

257
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,736
[chuckles]

258
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:05,839
- Scotty, we sure this is the room?
- Yeah, Coach.

259
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:08,207
Okay, and they were here
at bed check?

260
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,710
- Yeah, they're marked off.
- What the fuck does that mean, "They're marked off"?

261
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:13,245
- Did somebody see 'em?
- No. But I spoke to LJ on the phone.

262
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:15,314
What the fuck?
You ain't seen nobody...

263
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:17,383
You don't do bed check
on the goddamn telephone.

264
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,451
You check the goddamn bed.
For Christ's sake.

265
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:22,254
Goddamn it!
Bailey's got my phone.

266
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:24,523
- Your work one.
- Yes. Thank you.

267
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:26,626
Jesus Christ, man.
We're in New Orleans.

268
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,495
Walking distance to the
Quarter with LeMarcus James.

269
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:33,298
You might want to actually check
that he's in bed at bed check.

270
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:35,568
When's the last time did y'all see him?
Come on, now.

271
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:37,737
- Huh?
- When he got off the bus.

272
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:40,540
Hey, LeMarcus, it's Coach. Just hit
me back here on the work cell, okay?

273
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:42,374
If you're out and about,
no problem.

274
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,410
Just, uh, checking in, okay?

275
00:14:44,544 --> 00:14:46,311
We'll see you
for a.m. sprints, man.

276
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:48,447
- Goddamn it.
- There's the guy with the key, Coach.

277
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:49,982
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:50,115 --> 00:14:51,450
All right.

279
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:53,853
[sighs]

280
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:55,521
LeMarcus. Emmett.

281
00:14:57,624 --> 00:14:59,592
Goddamn it.

282
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:01,628
What the...

283
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:05,464
Well, I guess we just knock on
every goddamn door at the hotel.

284
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:07,700
We got to find him.
Let's go. Go, go, go.

285
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,602
Wake everybody up
if you have to.

286
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:11,036
Shit.

287
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,840
[indistinct conversations]

288
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:25,384
[Coach Dunn] Come on, Cornelius,
open up the door. Hey.

289
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:27,953
- Fuck. Hold on.
- [bottle clinks]

290
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,790
What do you want, Coach?

291
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,460
What the fuck
is that smell?

292
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:36,796
That's Payton's ass
after Popeyes.

293
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:41,166
- There something you need?
- Look, have you seen LeMarcus?

294
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,168
Why the fuck
would I know where he's at?

295
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:45,437
- What's going on?
- It's nothing for you to worry about.

296
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,439
Just be ready for sprints
in the morning.

297
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:49,508
Nasty-ass kids.

298
00:16:06,992 --> 00:16:08,393
[LeMarcus] Yo, Orlando.

299
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,998
How drunk are you, man?

300
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:15,969
I haven't drank
in four months.

301
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,202
Where's your phone?

302
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:19,939
In the room, like you asked.

303
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:22,040
But what the fuck
is this, LJ?

304
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:24,844
It's exactly what I said.

305
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:26,779
I ain't playing
until they pay us.

306
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:28,514
What? You broke again?

307
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:31,083
- You hurt?
- I'm done.

308
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:34,186
They're here making billions
while the rest of us make scraps.

309
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:38,156
Me and you, we could sell our names.
What about everybody else, huh?

310
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:41,093
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

311
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:43,161
Hold up, hold up.

312
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:47,199
So you gonna sit
the national title game

313
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:49,468
so some punt-coverage
Wayne Burnett gets...

314
00:16:49,602 --> 00:16:52,137
- A real piece, yeah.
- [chuckles]

315
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,874
Shit.

316
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,711
LJ, you need
to think about this, bruh.

317
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:00,547
You and crazy-
Bible-Belt-Sunday

318
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,381
gonna get laughed
out the building.

319
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:04,717
And if you're lucky, what?
You gonna post on Twitter,

320
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:08,186
and the whole fucking machine gonna
go, "Okay, okay. We give up.

321
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,558
LeMarcus doesn't want to play.
Let's just make him happy."

322
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:14,928
- I ain't who you think I am.
- [scoffs]

323
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,932
So you weren't the one
who gave us all 'Rona

324
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:22,200
after fucking half the
campus during quarantine?

325
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,136
You ain't tested with your
own piss in three years.

326
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:27,707
All your cash going up in smoke
or to that shit in your ears.

327
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,742
So you standing on stage
for one protest

328
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:32,177
for Instagram and pussy

329
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:34,379
don't make you Malcolm X,
brother.

330
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:37,249
Ain't nobody marching
in the streets

331
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:39,251
for the number one pick.

332
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,554
[sighs]

333
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:47,060
Look, man,
you're a great quarterback...

334
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,728
and I'm gonna keep it 100
with you:

335
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,295
one of the best
I've ever seen.

336
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:51,965
But this shit?

337
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,500
Uh-uh.

338
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,671
You gonna embarrass
yourself, bruh.

339
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:04,476
Look, man, you ain't
gotta come with me.

340
00:18:04,611 --> 00:18:07,446
All I'm asking is that
you don't come out against me.

341
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:10,482
[sighs]

342
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,486
All right.

343
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:16,521
I'll watch this show
as long as you want,

344
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:18,758
but I ain't gettin'
a hundred yards from it.

345
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:30,536
Good luck.

346
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:41,146
[country music playing
on speaker]

347
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,281
[heavy breathing]

348
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:59,699
Mmm, I cannot believe
that you are here,

349
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:01,166
you little sneak.

350
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:02,669
[chuckles]

351
00:19:02,802 --> 00:19:04,971
You know
you love surprises.

352
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:07,006
I do. I do.

353
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,641
I just...

354
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:11,209
I just wish you had a seat
next to me at the game.

355
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:13,412
That's not exactly
the reason I came.

356
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:15,915
[laughs]
Fine by me.

357
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:18,718
[sighs]

358
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:23,321
I'm gonna take the job.

359
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:26,324
Get a break
from the university.

360
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:29,696
Rome?

361
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:34,167
Hard to turn down
a year teaching abroad.

362
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,935
Yeah.

363
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:39,172
Yeah, I get that.
I totally get that.

364
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:46,244
I just had one little,
tiny little question, Mr. Poet.

365
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:51,249
Or is it "philosopher"?

366
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:54,419
What about us?

367
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:57,757
We're a hotel-room
romance.

368
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,424
Well, now you're just
being a dick.

369
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,894
- You know what I'm saying.
- Fuck you.

370
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:03,462
Come visit.

371
00:20:03,596 --> 00:20:05,932
"Come visit." <i>Grazie.</i>

372
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:08,768
[chuckles]

373
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,507
I don't know.

374
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,045
Maybe I want more.

375
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:38,263
[coughs]

376
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,700
[sniffles]

377
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:43,636
You all right?

378
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:45,938
Fucking nerves, man.

379
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,741
Just breathe through it.

380
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,345
You got this.
You're fresh as ever.

381
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:07,359
<i>Habibi,</i> this is a long way
to Frenchmen Street.

382
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:09,662
Yeah, we like taking in
the sights, Ned.

383
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:11,764
[Ned] Okay. Your money.

384
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:13,900
[coughing]

385
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:43,029
We're sure
walking the talk now.

386
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:44,864
What, you want out?

387
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:46,799
Shit, I'm going
back to the farm.

388
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:49,202
You're the one who's got
everything to lose.

389
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:51,204
[sighs]

390
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:53,172
Glad we huddled
up on that.

391
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:58,343
Keep her running, Ned.
We may have to dine and dash.

392
00:22:00,947 --> 00:22:02,114
[grunts]

393
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:04,917
LeMarcus, Cathy Levy.
Nice to meet you.

394
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:07,485
- Yeah, nice to meet you. This is Em.
- Are you okay?

395
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,723
Peachy, yeah. Just, uh, ankle gets
a little stiff if I sit too long.

396
00:22:10,857 --> 00:22:12,325
Thanks for agreeing
to do this.

397
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,527
Are you kidding?
Thanks for calling.

398
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,362
[indistinct chattering]

399
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:21,567
Whenever you're ready,
go ahead and take a seat for me.

400
00:22:22,702 --> 00:22:23,870
Holy shit.

401
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:27,673
Damn, you look good
ten stories high.

402
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:30,243
Just had to put that
in the background, huh?

403
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:34,881
Here goes nothing.

404
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:36,381
Go get 'em.

405
00:22:40,853 --> 00:22:42,454
Wait, wait.

406
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,426
- [sighs]
- [Cathy] You ready?

407
00:22:49,362 --> 00:22:50,997
We're recording.

408
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:02,775

414
00:23:13,686 --> 00:23:16,255
in order to demand that
the NCAA and its affiliates

415
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:19,892
end their practice of unpaid labor
for the majority of their workforce,

416
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:24,730
a practice which results in $18.9
billion a year in total revenue

417

for a system which,
in turn,

418

only spends $3.6 billion

Where does the other 15-plus
billion dollars go, you ask?

420
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,909
Well, I'll tell you:

421
00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:39,245
to an extremely lucrative
oligarchy.

422

<i>You see, all of this money</i>

437
00:24:24,991 --> 00:24:28,194
<i>is predicated on one
underlying principle:</i>

438
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:30,997
<i>free labor.</i>

439
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,132
<i>It is un-American,
it is exploitative,</i>

440
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:35,968
<i>and it speaks to the darkest
spots in the national soul.</i>

441
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:39,805
<i>Now, it is not enough for some of us to
be able to use our name and likeness,</i>

443

<i>"One,</i>

- Shit.
- <i>"And number three,</i>

453

456
00:25:13,906 --> 00:25:17,777
In this, the NCAA
will recognize players

as employees
and not student athletes.

458
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:24,216
Thank you.

00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:52,912
All right.
Good morning, Coach.

467
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:56,682
Thanks for coming over so quick.
This is Wes Martin from the Big 12.

468
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:58,984
He's gonna be our enemy for
the next 48 hours. [chuckles]

469
00:25:59,118 --> 00:26:01,487
- Kevin McDonald from the CFP.
- We met yesterday.

470
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,157
And Mike Titus, Senior VP,
Championships, D-I football.

471
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:06,725
James, we've actually met.

472
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:09,061
Yeah, at the Outback Bowl
two seasons ago.

473
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:12,098
- That's right. You have come a long way.
- Looks like you have too.

474
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,934
[chuckles] Yes, indeed.
Please have a seat.

475
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:16,836
Real, uh...

476
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:19,805
- Real mess we got here.
- [Coach Lazor] Well, not really.

477
00:26:19,939 --> 00:26:22,274
I just need to get with LeMarcus
and talk things through.

478
00:26:22,408 --> 00:26:24,810
These kids don't fully
understand what they're doing.

479
00:26:24,944 --> 00:26:27,246
A coach and his quarterback.
No closer bond.

480
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,649
You were a quarterback yourself
back in the day, am I right?

481
00:26:30,783 --> 00:26:32,952
Coaches are just players
who can't play anymore.

482
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,454
You still don't know
where he is?

483
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:37,591
- What?
- [Kevin] Where LeMarcus is.

484
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:40,226
We're broadcasting this game
in 160 countries.

485
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,828
They're all tuning in to watch
him go against Cecil Burgess.

486
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:45,631
I love these marketing guys.
You know that LeMarcus and Cecil

487
00:26:45,764 --> 00:26:48,467
both play offense,
so they won't be facing off.

488
00:26:48,602 --> 00:26:51,470
- I know how the game works, Coach.
- Look, LeMarcus is around.

489
00:26:51,605 --> 00:26:53,239
He's probably
in the hotel somewhere.

490
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:55,474
I just haven't had a chance
to get with him yet.

491
00:26:57,877 --> 00:27:01,413
Coach, I think it's best if
the NCAA took the reins here.

492
00:27:01,548 --> 00:27:03,949
We're more of an impartial jury.
We just want a great game.

493
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,886
- Well, I think that's what all of us want, right?
- Yes, it is.

494
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,756
That's why we were hoping you could
shed some light on this young man.

495
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,025
LeMarcus.
What's his character?

496
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:14,927
He's a good kid.

497
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,030
He's just, uh...
Like a lot of kids his age,

498
00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:20,966
maybe he's a little too fond
of the spotlight and its perks.

499
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,869
Hell, if I was the best QB in the
country, I think I'd be bouncin' 'em

500
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:26,472
out of my apartment
three at a time, huh?

501
00:27:26,606 --> 00:27:29,441
[Coach Lazor] LeMarcus
is not a troublemaker, okay?

502
00:27:29,576 --> 00:27:33,512
I want to be very clear on this.
LeMarcus is a good person.

503
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:37,816
He's just a kid
with too much power

504
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,519
who, I don't know,
had a bad tweet.

505
00:27:40,654 --> 00:27:43,122
- And interview.
- [person clears throat] Okay.

506
00:27:43,255 --> 00:27:45,559
Well, you know,
Coach is gonna right this ship.

507
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:47,526
- He just needs a little more time, right?
- [Coach Lazor] Yep.

508
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:50,930
- [Kevin] You think somebody got to him?
- "Somebody"?

509
00:27:51,063 --> 00:27:53,866
Like an organized labor rep,
an ACLU lawyer?

510
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:55,535
Maybe the Russians.

511
00:27:57,336 --> 00:28:00,039
- That's a fucking joke, guys.
- Huh. Come on, guys.

512
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:03,209
Look, LeMarcus, from sixth,
seventh grade on,

513
00:28:03,342 --> 00:28:05,110
they're big men on campus.

514
00:28:05,244 --> 00:28:07,947
He and Emmett,
they still think this is playtime here.

515
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,015
They don't understand
the world stage.

516
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:12,184
They don't understand
the implications here.

517
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:13,852
They just asked
to collectively bargain.

518
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:16,222
They want to destroy the
student-athlete designation.

519
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:18,891
Not the demands of some kids
spitting in the wind.

520
00:28:19,024 --> 00:28:20,426
You telling me I don't
know my own players?

521
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,094
I'm saying
you might be in denial

522
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:23,796
about what is actually
happening right now.

523
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:25,632
Come on, Wes.
That's over the line.

524
00:28:25,764 --> 00:28:27,701
- [Wes] Is it?
- Yes, it is.

525
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:30,604
Coach, what they're asking for is
bigger than football or one game.

526
00:28:30,736 --> 00:28:32,171
- Understood.
- It's our entire amateur athletics program

527
00:28:32,304 --> 00:28:33,839
in the country.

528
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:37,776
That's 24 sports for
young men and women, gone.

529
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,312
Hundreds of thousands
of students,

530
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:41,747
student athletes,

531
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,450
being denied
a college experience.

532
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:47,753
[Kevin] We're 40-somethin'
hours to kickoff here, guys.

533
00:28:47,886 --> 00:28:49,689
We need to make sure
everybody's suiting up.

534
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:51,824
There hasn't been a single
defection from our side.

535
00:28:51,957 --> 00:28:53,826
- It's theirs that's falling apart.
- [cell phone chimes]

536
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:55,928
Hey. Nothing's
falling apart.

537
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:58,030
Okay? Everybody relax
a little bit.

538
00:28:58,163 --> 00:29:00,799
- [Wes] Three wide receivers just tweeted, "We're in."
- [men sighing]

539
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:04,303
With a hashtag that's going
viral: "Fix the system."

540
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:07,973
Your other two stars,
Bishop and Cornelius, could be next.

541
00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:10,644
Orlando Bishop
is my one and only captain.

542
00:29:10,776 --> 00:29:13,445
He is team first.
He's not going anywhere.

543
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,716
And Cornelius, frankly,
can't stand LeMarcus.

544
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:19,251
He wouldn't follow him into
the Garden of Eden. He'll play.

545
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:23,489
One linebacker ain't plugging this hole.
You're taking on water fast.

546
00:29:23,623 --> 00:29:25,958
Hey! He got blindsided just
like the rest of us, all right?

547
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:28,360
There's no reason
to keep attacking him.

548
00:29:28,494 --> 00:29:30,262
Here's an idea.

549
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:33,499
Lean on the sophomores and freshmen
who have something to lose.

550
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:36,268
They won't want to risk
the eligibility over this.

551
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:38,937
You'd love that,
wouldn't you, Wes?

552
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,641
We all know I can't field
a competitive team

553
00:29:41,775 --> 00:29:44,510
with a bunch of 18-year-olds
that haven't played

554
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:47,146
a meaningful snap
since high school.

555
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,082
Fuck that. I'd rather not
field a team at all.

556
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:53,787
I'm afraid
that's not an option.

557
00:29:57,856 --> 00:30:00,859
We wouldn't need any options if
I could get with my quarterback

558
00:30:00,993 --> 00:30:04,029
instead of sitting around
this circle jerk.

559
00:30:06,231 --> 00:30:08,233
[clears throat]
Thanks for coming, Coach.

560
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:09,669
You bet.

561
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:13,238
- Thanks for coming down.
- Don't lecture my guy.

562
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:16,342
Thought you had your conference under
control, Everly. We got nothin'.

563
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:19,211
- [Everly] We got time.
- [Wes] Time is the one thing we don't have.

564
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:21,715
[Everly] We got a little bit.
We'll be fine.

565
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:30,389
All right.
The Death Star awaits.

566
00:30:30,522 --> 00:30:32,524
The Cougars are staying
on the 17th floor.

567
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:34,159
There's a stairway
around the back.

568
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:35,961
Let's go get this done
and get out of here.

569
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:38,030
Keep it running, Ned.
We'll be back in 20.

570
00:30:38,163 --> 00:30:40,199
- [hip-hop music playing]
- [person] Eat, nigga, eat!

571
00:30:40,332 --> 00:30:42,368
- [knock on door]
- I'm nice. I'm nice.

572
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:46,004
- Watch this bucket right here. Bucket!
- [pounding on door]

573
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:47,172
Hold on.

574
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,007
Hey, don't fuckin' cheat.

575
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,178
Hello, Roc.
Emmett Sunday, esquire.

576
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:56,048
You may know me
from such hits

577
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:57,916
as <i>Last Stand</i>
<i>at the Texas Stadium,</i>

578
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,853
- <i>Destruction at the Peach Bowl...</i>
- That's not funny.

579
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,321
- I'm number 82.
- Yeah, the tight end. What the fuck do you want?

580
00:31:02,454 --> 00:31:04,557
The one and only.
Mind if I come in for a sec? Thanks.

581
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:06,492
Hold on. You just gonna
walk in my room like that?

582
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:08,528
Cecil, what's going on, man?
Emmett Sunday. How you doing?

583
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:11,296
- Just gonna turn on...
- Why you turning on my light like that?

584
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,400
- I'm just gonna turn off this TV.
- Yo, white boy. [sighs]

585
00:31:14,534 --> 00:31:17,871
Chill out and let me know why the fuck
you in my room before I fight you.

586
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:20,172
Cecil, you mind if I show
you something for a second?

587
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:22,207
- It may help make my case.
- All right, man, go ahead.

588
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:24,276
He's been replying
real quick. Hold on.

589
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,579
- Yeah, there you go.
- Hold on.

590
00:31:26,713 --> 00:31:28,615
Nah, nah, nah.
This way first.

591
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,252
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I ain't fucking with you.

592
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:35,454
- Yo, this is LeBron, nigga. Look.
- That's LeBron.

593
00:31:35,588 --> 00:31:37,423
- LeBron DM'd these fucks.
- That's the king.

594
00:31:37,557 --> 00:31:39,458
Oh, shit! He just said
"What's up?" to you.

595
00:31:39,592 --> 00:31:41,059
Yeah, 'cause
he knows you're here.

596
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:43,262
How the fuck you get
LeBron to DM you?

597
00:31:43,395 --> 00:31:45,130
We're buddies, man.
And I was thinking,

598
00:31:45,264 --> 00:31:47,232
Clutch just started a new
football division to rep,

599
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:50,703
and I was thinking, hell, maybe I
just put in a good word for you two.

600
00:31:50,837 --> 00:31:54,406
Fly over to LA, the land of big
lips, fake tits, and sunshine.

601
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:56,308
- I love fake titties.
- I know. Me too.

602
00:31:56,442 --> 00:31:58,745
And you sit down with LeBron and
Maverick and have a conversation.

603
00:31:58,878 --> 00:32:02,481
Grab lunch with LeBron in LA? You know I
love tacos, nigga. Hold on. How we do that?

604
00:32:02,615 --> 00:32:04,884
It's a little weird.
I need your phones.

605
00:32:05,017 --> 00:32:06,920
- My phone?
- I just need your phone.

606
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:11,591
Fuck it.
Hey, it's LeBron. Here.

607
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:13,793
- Come on, give him your phone.
- Come on, Cecil.

608
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:16,328
I ain't gonna do anything
weird with it. Come on.

609
00:32:16,462 --> 00:32:17,996
You can keep my phone
as collateral.

610
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,667
Collateral and shit.
I'ma pocket this bitch.

611
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,835
Don't move.

612
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:24,436
Yeah. Yeah.

613
00:32:24,571 --> 00:32:26,806
- Bruh, LeBron. LeBron, though.
- [Emmett whistles]

614
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,541
What's happening, fellas?

615
00:32:29,508 --> 00:32:32,177
- Surprise, surprise.
- Shit.

616
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:35,481
- Not LeBron.
- So, what's up? I know y'all seen it.

617
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:37,817
- Yeah, we seen it.
- [LeMarcus] What y'all think?

618
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:39,853
Hoping y'all gonna join us.

619
00:32:40,986 --> 00:32:42,589
And skip out
on the title game?

620
00:32:42,722 --> 00:32:43,989
Man, you out
your fucking mind.

621
00:32:44,122 --> 00:32:46,058
- [Roc] For real.
- [LeMarcus] Yeah, probably.

622
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:48,293
It's gonna take a little crazy
to get it done though, ain't it?

623
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:51,196
Yeah, but he's Kiper's
number one back.

624
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,131
Going eighth to Baltimore
at the latest.

625
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:55,334
He ain't risking that
fucking with y'all.

626
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:57,436
Hmm. Buffalo should
take him at three.

627
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,405
- They're going tackle.
- Maybe Miami gets smart and takes you at one.

628
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,743
- Then where you gonna go?
- Me? Shit. CFL after this, probably.

629
00:33:03,877 --> 00:33:05,477
- [snorts]
- [LeMarcus chuckles]

630
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:07,379
Yeah, Saskatchewan
or some shit like that.

631
00:33:07,513 --> 00:33:10,282
- [Roc] Saskatchewan?
- Listen.

632
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:13,318
They're still gonna find a way to
play this game without me and Emmett.

633
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,154
We gonna need you.

634
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,490
The Haitian Hammer,
running wild on all those TV promos.

635
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,426
Come watch him put up 500 yards in a
single game. Hell, I'd go to see it.

636
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:23,161
Yeah, maybe then he goes
number one.

637
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:25,397
But if he sits, they gonna
Kaepernick him like you.

638
00:33:25,532 --> 00:33:28,066
- Hmm.
- Come on, bruh. You might fall out the first round.

639
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,502
Do y'all even know what the
rookie minimum is down there?

640
00:33:30,637 --> 00:33:34,007
Probably not, but they taking backs
in the third or fourth round nowadays.

641
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,575
Four years and done,
we're back in the hood.

642
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:38,477
That is why we gotta stick
together on this, fellas.

643
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:40,512
Think about it.

644
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:42,180
If we all sit,
what are they gonna do?

645
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:45,417
Hmm? It's called
collective action.

646
00:33:45,552 --> 00:33:47,687
Fuck you learn
a big word like that?

647
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:50,188
Intro to Organized Labor.

648
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:53,392
[scoffs] A class?
He talking 'bout a class.

649
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:56,930
[chuckles] Only class you probably took
was Intro to Organized Dick-sucking.

650
00:33:57,062 --> 00:33:59,566
- Flap your gums 'cause you're scared.
- Scared of what? You?

651
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:01,534
Scared you're gonna be teaching
high-school PE next year.

652
00:34:01,668 --> 00:34:02,969
I know this is my last game,
same as you.

653
00:34:03,101 --> 00:34:05,038
Fuck you.
I'm playing in the League.

654
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,607
[LeMarcus] Hey, look, we ain't
come here for all that, all right?

655
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,043
Look, me and E are serious
about this.

656
00:34:11,578 --> 00:34:14,212
We just came here
to let y'all know.

657
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:16,916
Sleep on it. Pray on it.

658
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,451
- Look, I appreciate y'all.
- Yeah. All right, yeah.

659
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:21,486
All right.

660
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:24,757
- No hard feelings.
- Yeah, no hard feelings.

661
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:26,926
Collective action.

662
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,730
Man, I hope we get to play those guys.
Go ahead, Ned.

663
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:33,566
If we don't get Cecil on board,
we're gonna need the whole squad,

664
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,068
or we ain't
playing shit.

665
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,436
We get the younger guys,
Orlando will come too.

666
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,707
Hey, get
Bob Reynolds a note.

667
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,076
Tell him we'll give him
the exclusive.

668
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,611
Copy that.

669
00:34:49,749 --> 00:34:52,085
Wonder how many of these

00:43:16,556 --> 00:43:17,957
Shut up and get inside.

839
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,292
Easy, big fella.
We come in peace.

840
00:43:22,562 --> 00:43:23,963
How the hell
did you find us?

841
00:43:24,096 --> 00:43:26,232
- A happy accident.
- What do you want?

842
00:43:26,365 --> 00:43:27,833
[Rodgers] Just to talk,
that's it.

843
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:29,768
One minute,
and then we're gone.

844
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:33,072
Hey, you look like hell.
You okay?

845
00:43:33,205 --> 00:43:34,807
We're owed.

846
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:38,277
You are owed?

847
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,614
Yes. We're owed.

848
00:43:40,746 --> 00:43:44,551
Taylor. What I think my associate
is trying to communicate here

849
00:43:44,683 --> 00:43:46,018
is that we're hurtin'.

850
00:43:46,152 --> 00:43:49,188
We feel like
we're invested here,

851
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:51,891
especially after all
we've been through together.

852
00:43:52,024 --> 00:43:54,693
Because you loaned me a car?

853
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:56,630
And helped refinance
your mother's mortgage

854
00:43:56,762 --> 00:43:58,998
when she fell behind,
and also with your brother.

855
00:43:59,131 --> 00:44:02,768
- Should we talk about the message...
- Don't... say another word.

856
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:06,839
And don't do this.

857
00:44:06,972 --> 00:44:08,841
You don't give a shit
about us.

858
00:44:08,974 --> 00:44:12,344
- All you give a shit about is your damn game.
- Now, now, now, Taylor.

859
00:44:14,813 --> 00:44:17,349
LeMarcus, what...
what's going on here?

860
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:19,218
Me and you are buddies.

861
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:21,220
You love playing football.

862
00:44:21,353 --> 00:44:23,389
Hell, I love watching you
play football.

863
00:44:23,522 --> 00:44:26,692
An entire college campus,
40,000 kids,

864
00:44:26,825 --> 00:44:28,961
thinks that you're
Jesus Christ incarnate.

865
00:44:29,094 --> 00:44:32,198
What's going on?
You need money?

866
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:35,234
Just tell me
where to send the check.

867
00:44:36,769 --> 00:44:38,538
What the fuck
don't you get?

868
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:43,909
You ever read <i>The Jungle?</i>

869
00:44:44,043 --> 00:44:46,111
What has that got to do
with anything, LeMarcus?

870
00:44:46,245 --> 00:44:47,846
The American Dream.

871
00:44:49,415 --> 00:44:51,750
This guy Jurgis
from Lithuania,

872
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:54,119
he worked at the meat-packing
plant in Chicago.

873
00:44:54,253 --> 00:44:56,155
Now, Jurgis was young,

874
00:44:56,288 --> 00:44:58,190
he was bigger, stronger
than the rest of 'em.

875
00:44:58,324 --> 00:45:00,226
So they put him
to work in the kill beds.

876
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:02,861
He worked so hard,
he couldn't bend his fingers.

877
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:06,098
He couldn't flex his knees,
broke his ankle.

878
00:45:06,232 --> 00:45:08,702
After all those years,
he just kept on working,

879
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:11,036
and he loved it.

880
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,907
See, that didn't mean shit to the guys
who owned the plant though, did it?

881
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,510
'Cause they weren't about to
take care of no broke immigrant.

882
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:23,115
LeMarcus... [sighs]
You ain't that guy.

883
00:45:23,249 --> 00:45:25,951
You're about to be
the number one pick

884
00:45:26,085 --> 00:45:28,287
in the first round
of the NFL draft,

885
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,857
- and Miami is gonna pay you $35 million...
- Yeah, I know.

886
00:45:31,991 --> 00:45:33,727
That's a whole lot of meat.

887
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:36,895
What about the guys who
ain't going into the League?

888
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:39,765
The guys who busted their head in
the dirt for the last four years,

889
00:45:39,898 --> 00:45:42,301
only to wind up mangled and broke?
What about them, huh?

890
00:45:42,434 --> 00:45:45,639
- So this whole thing's about you?
- It's about everyone, man.

891
00:45:45,771 --> 00:45:47,973
What the fuck do you think
you're gonna do?

892
00:45:48,107 --> 00:45:50,577
You can't square off
with the entire system.

893
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:53,445
You two cannot unionize college
sports, and that's a fact.

894
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,815
- It ain't two.
- What?

895
00:45:56,949 --> 00:45:59,251
It ain't just two of us
no more,

896
00:45:59,385 --> 00:46:00,786
and that's a fact.

897
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:05,592
[sighs]

898
00:46:11,263 --> 00:46:13,600
[person] <i>We have to
dismantle the structure</i>

899
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:15,301
<i>and do something
that's more equitable,</i>

900
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:17,002
<i>that's fairer
for these athletes.</i>

901
00:46:17,136 --> 00:46:18,837
<i>I've got teammates
that I played</i>

902
00:46:18,971 --> 00:46:20,939
<i>collegiate ball with
at Ohio State</i>

903
00:46:21,073 --> 00:46:22,776
<i>that suffered some
career-ending injuries,</i>

904
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:25,010
<i>some life-altering
injuries,</i>

905
00:46:25,144 --> 00:46:27,346
<i>that struggle
and still struggle today</i>

906
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:30,149
<i>without any support
from the university.</i>

907
00:46:30,282 --> 00:46:31,817
<i>It's very frustrating.</i>

908
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,687
<i>So I'm proud
to stand behind</i>

909
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:35,821
<i>LeMarcus James
and what he's doing.</i>

910
00:46:35,954 --> 00:46:38,591
<i>Wilson, what do you think of the
situation with LeMarcus James?</i>

911
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:41,026
<i>Listen, Greeny,
I'm really impressed by LeMarcus James.</i>

912
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,329
<i>This guy's given up
possibly $35 million,</i>

913
00:46:43,462 --> 00:46:45,197
<i>maybe the first pick
overall.</i>

914
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:47,466
<i>The reality is,
he's got so much to lose</i>

915
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,301
<i>but really so much to gain.</i>

916
00:46:49,435 --> 00:46:51,738
<i>And I think that you and I
both know, Greeny,</i>

917
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:54,139
<i>that this whole system's broke,
and we got to fix it.</i>

918
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:56,308
<i>It's got to get fixed
immediately.</i>

919
00:46:56,442 --> 00:46:59,011
[Greenberg] <i>There you have it.
Directly from one of the great quarterbacks</i>

920
00:46:59,144 --> 00:47:01,447
<i>in the history of the NFL,
Russell Wilson.</i>

921
00:47:01,581 --> 00:47:04,416
<i>He won the Walter Payton Man
of the Year award in 2020.</i>

922
00:47:04,551 --> 00:47:06,786
- <i>Russell, thank you.</i>
- <i>Always a pleasure, Greeny. I'll see you soon.</i>

923
00:47:06,919 --> 00:47:10,155
[Greenberg] <i>In the meantime,
we've got other news to talk about...</i>

924
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:13,225
I understand.

925
00:47:15,994 --> 00:47:18,063
Yeah, we all know
what's at stake here.

926
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:21,900
I will get
him into this game.

927
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:24,403
You have
my personal guarantee.

928
00:47:24,537 --> 00:47:25,871
Of course.

929
00:47:26,004 --> 00:47:27,873
Well, thank you...
Yeah, he hung up on me.

930
00:47:28,006 --> 00:47:30,909
[sighs, panting]

931
00:47:31,043 --> 00:47:33,379
You're up early.
What, do you sleep in that power suit?

932
00:47:33,512 --> 00:47:35,381
I might as well
at this point, right?

933
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:38,517
Pressure
from the overlords?

934
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:41,320
I'd say my very early
retirement is being discussed

935
00:47:41,453 --> 00:47:43,690
unless I change the optics,
and quick.

936
00:47:43,823 --> 00:47:46,258
And if I go,
so goes your retainer.

937
00:47:46,392 --> 00:47:49,061
[laughs] We can't let
that happen, now, can we?

938
00:47:51,029 --> 00:47:52,532
We offer talks.

939
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,033
We hear their demands.

940
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:57,771
- We promise a committee to explore.
- No.

941
00:48:01,775 --> 00:48:04,076
They've got 40 players now.

942
00:48:04,209 --> 00:48:07,212
- [Mike] I heard.
- They think they can win this.

943
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:10,282
If we offer talks, then they will
never leave the table empty-handed.

944
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:12,552
- They're kids.
- Exactly.

945
00:48:12,685 --> 00:48:15,622
They haven't lost enough to believe
that that's the most likely outcome.

946
00:48:15,755 --> 00:48:19,592
They don't understand
that life is about losing.

947
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,428
I pay you for options.
What are they?

948
00:48:22,562 --> 00:48:24,396
Well, I can only see two.

949
00:48:24,531 --> 00:48:26,465
You either give them
what they want...

950
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:28,400
Second option?

951
00:48:28,535 --> 00:48:30,904
We savage them.

952
00:48:33,706 --> 00:48:37,075
You find everything...
every grain, every person.

953
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:41,614
You turn LeMarcus James into a
monster that no one could follow.

954
00:48:43,282 --> 00:48:45,451
LeMarcus decided
to do this.

955
00:48:45,585 --> 00:48:47,986
He waded into your waters.

956
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,355
We have to react.

957
00:48:52,725 --> 00:48:56,028
Unfortunately, I don't have
the luxury to react, Ms. Poe.

958
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:00,533
But you do.

959
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:10,476
[LeMarcus coughing]

960
00:49:11,945 --> 00:49:13,445
It's started.

961
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:16,114
What?

962
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:18,083
They got their hounds loose.

963
00:49:20,486 --> 00:49:21,888
[LeMarcus sighs]

964
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,356
And you know
they're gonna dig up more.

965
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:26,124
[crowd cheering]

966
00:49:26,258 --> 00:49:28,828
[chanting]
<i>LJ! LJ! LJ! LJ! LJ!</i>

967
00:49:28,962 --> 00:49:30,663
[whooping, cheering]

968
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,835
[Emmett] We're gonna
have to move again.

969
00:49:37,737 --> 00:49:38,872
No more running.

970
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,307
Let 'em come.

971
00:49:44,176 --> 00:49:46,613
Luke?
Yes, every player.

972
00:49:46,746 --> 00:49:48,313
I don't care. Luke!

973
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:51,483
On the goddamn roof, for all I care.
Thirty minutes.

974
00:49:51,618 --> 00:49:54,253
Bailey,
have you seen Luke?

975
00:49:54,386 --> 00:49:56,355
I got nine players

976
00:49:56,488 --> 00:49:59,525
and the cabal
of fucking idiocy around me.

977
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:02,261
I sent him to the store
for McConnell's ice cream.

978
00:50:02,394 --> 00:50:04,531
Baby, you can't
be doing that now.

979
00:50:04,664 --> 00:50:07,099
This is fucking serious!
LeMarcus...

980
00:50:07,232 --> 00:50:09,002
Goddamn it!
You know what hurts the most?

981
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,638
He never came to me
with any of this,

982
00:50:11,771 --> 00:50:13,973
after everything
we've been through together.

983
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:22,715
Are you...

984
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:26,218
Jesus fucking Christ.
Are you fucking kidding me?

985
00:50:27,052 --> 00:50:28,353
Now?

986
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:30,623
I got a full-on rebellion
in my locker room,

987
00:50:30,757 --> 00:50:33,860
I got the head of the NCAA
and both conferences up my ass

988
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:36,963
at the national fucking
title game...

989
00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:40,165
- Now? You're gonna...
- Coach, we talked about this.

990
00:50:40,299 --> 00:50:44,202
How can I say this again
in a way that you can get it?

991
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:46,539
I need to find myself again.

992
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:49,207
I need some me time.
Not you time. Me time.

993
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:51,578
Goddamn, you
fuckin' selfish...

994
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:54,881
Wow! Finish it.
Finish it.

995
00:50:55,014 --> 00:50:57,249
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

996
00:50:57,382 --> 00:50:58,651
- I'm sorry.
- [scoffs]

997
00:50:58,785 --> 00:51:00,285
I know the sacrifices
you've made for me.

998
00:51:00,419 --> 00:51:03,422
Of course I do.
But please...

999
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:15,568
Okay, which place do you
want me to stay away from?

1000
00:51:15,702 --> 00:51:17,704
Where are you going?
The beach house?

1001
00:51:19,072 --> 00:51:20,439
I'm going to Rome.

1002
00:51:20,573 --> 00:51:21,941
Rome?

1003
00:51:23,676 --> 00:51:25,712
Okay, I can stay away
from Rome.

1004
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,488
You're not going
to Rome alone, are you?

1005
00:51:37,255 --> 00:51:38,256
Question:

1006
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,425
If I hadn't stayed here

1007
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,394
to explain to you
that I was leaving,

1008
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:44,229
would you have noticed
I'd gone?

1009
00:51:44,363 --> 00:51:46,164
- I know. I get it. I get it.
- All I wanna know...

1010
00:51:46,298 --> 00:51:49,267
Look.
It's this fucking job.

1011
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:50,803
Oh, God.

1012
00:51:50,937 --> 00:51:54,107
I swear to God,
I will make it up to you.

1013
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,308
Okay? Please.

1014
00:51:56,441 --> 00:51:58,945
I swear to God,
I'm gonna make this up to you.

1015
00:51:59,078 --> 00:52:00,212
- It's just...
- James...

1016
00:52:00,345 --> 00:52:02,715
We just got
to get past this game.

1017
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:03,850
Please.

1018
00:52:03,983 --> 00:52:05,317
James...

1019
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:08,220
Baby, I need you here
with me now, please.

1020
00:52:23,836 --> 00:52:25,470
[mutters]

1021
00:52:34,547 --> 00:52:38,051
Oh, um... You want Coach.
He's in the back.

1022
00:52:38,183 --> 00:52:39,886
Can you... please?

1023
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:42,088
- Yeah, sure, sure. Sure.
- Thank you. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1024
00:52:43,056 --> 00:52:44,857
Good to meet you.

1025
00:52:48,928 --> 00:52:50,362
Coach?

1026
00:52:54,266 --> 00:52:55,702
Coach Lazor?

1027
00:53:03,176 --> 00:53:05,178
Morning, Coach.
Uh, Katherine Poe.

1028
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:06,511
We met earlier?

1029
00:53:06,646 --> 00:53:08,548
Is now okay, sir?

1030
00:53:08,681 --> 00:53:10,482
It's kind of urgent.

1031
00:53:10,616 --> 00:53:11,918
[sighs]

1032
00:53:16,956 --> 00:53:18,725
[clears throat]

1033
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,095
Everything all right?

1034
00:53:23,062 --> 00:53:25,765
Well, if there's
anything I can do...

1035
00:53:25,898 --> 00:53:28,835
Just...
What do you want?

1036
00:53:28,968 --> 00:53:31,303
You have a rebellion
on your hands, sir.

1037
00:53:31,436 --> 00:53:33,740
[stammering]
What exactly do you do?

1038
00:53:33,873 --> 00:53:36,408
- You're with the NCAA?
- I'm not. I'm outside counsel.

1039
00:53:36,542 --> 00:53:38,310
- And your name again?
- Katherine.

1040
00:53:38,443 --> 00:53:41,214
Katherine, would you mind just
fucking off back to your C-suite?

1041
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,791
This is a private physical
LeMarcus had.

1042
00:53:52,992 --> 00:53:57,262
It's from July
for an insurance policy.

1043
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:01,033
How did you get that?

1044
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:05,238
It's a firm specializing
in medical data acquisition.

1045
00:54:06,606 --> 00:54:11,611
And this is an MRI
of LeMarcus' left knee,

1046
00:54:11,744 --> 00:54:14,814
which, unfortunately,
has no cartilage.

1047
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:19,652
He's been hiding it
for five months.

1048
00:54:22,521 --> 00:54:24,891
His body
is a ticking time bomb.

1049
00:54:25,024 --> 00:54:27,927
It's only a matter of time before
that knee gives out on him.

1050
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,730
He is never going to be
the number one pick,

1051
00:54:30,863 --> 00:54:33,298
not after the combine
and a physical.

1052
00:54:33,431 --> 00:54:35,201
He'll be lucky
if he got to go day two,

1053
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,003
and he's known that
for some time.

1054
00:54:37,136 --> 00:54:39,839
I have seen nothing to indicate
he's got a bad knee.

1055
00:54:39,972 --> 00:54:43,609
He's 21. He could eat gunpowder
and then go run a marathon.

1056
00:54:43,743 --> 00:54:45,510
Now, look.

1057
00:54:46,746 --> 00:54:49,447
It's best
if this comes from you.

1058
00:54:50,917 --> 00:54:53,986
How disappointed you were to
learn that he's been hiding this.

1059
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,356
Maybe, in retrospect,
you did notice the limp during practice.

1060
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:00,626
What exactly are you saying?

1061
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,830
Five months ago, LeMarcus figured out he
is not going to be the number one pick,

1062
00:55:03,963 --> 00:55:06,833
and he is trying to cash in
now before the teller...

1063
00:55:06,966 --> 00:55:09,068
- That is bullshit.
- Yes, sir. Before the teller window closes.

1064
00:55:09,202 --> 00:55:11,704
- LeMarcus would never...
- This is a shakedown, sir!

1065
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:13,973
Pure and simple.

1066
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:16,175
He is trying
to recoup his losses,

1067
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:18,144
and he is going
to take everything

1068
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:21,314
that you and your players
have worked for.

1069
00:55:23,381 --> 00:55:25,985
Let me ask you, sir,
how does a D-III quarterback

1070
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:29,322
with a noodle for an arm who
runs a five-flat 40 time,

1071
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:31,791
how does a guy like that
become the head coach

1072
00:55:31,924 --> 00:55:33,860
of not one but two
D-I powerhouses?

1073
00:55:33,993 --> 00:55:36,494
Because that guy
is a winner.

1074
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:38,931
And this is your time

1075
00:55:39,065 --> 00:55:41,100
to finally capture
that national title.

1076
00:55:41,234 --> 00:55:45,271
Do not let LeMarcus
rob you of your legacy.

1077
00:55:47,206 --> 00:55:51,177
Now, we will leak this
to the smaller sites.

1078
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,880
You will do a presser
for the networks,

1079
00:55:54,013 --> 00:55:56,682
and the aggregators
will take it from there.

1080
00:55:59,952 --> 00:56:01,519
I, um...

1081
00:56:01,654 --> 00:56:03,689
I have some remarks.

1082
00:56:03,823 --> 00:56:05,523
- If you want to take a look at...
- No, thank you.

1083
00:56:05,658 --> 00:56:08,861
I don't need
your fucking remarks.

1084
00:56:10,428 --> 00:56:12,365
This is my football team.

1085
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:16,468
- They will play for me.
- Coach...

1086
00:56:17,703 --> 00:56:18,804
wake up,

1087
00:56:19,872 --> 00:56:22,275
before you don't
even have a team.

1088
00:56:42,962 --> 00:56:44,664
[inhales deeply]

1089
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,571
[exhales sharply]

1090
00:56:55,741 --> 00:56:57,610
I know right now...

1091
00:56:59,879 --> 00:57:02,548
you think life is always
gonna be like this.

1092
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:07,386
You're at the center
of everything.

1093
00:57:09,922 --> 00:57:11,257
Alive.

1094
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,594
And greatness

1095
00:57:16,762 --> 00:57:18,531
is right there,

1096
00:57:18,664 --> 00:57:20,199
within reach.

1097
00:57:25,538 --> 00:57:27,106
But that's not true.

1098
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:33,612
This may very well be
your only fleeting moment

1099
00:57:33,746 --> 00:57:36,282
at the top
of the mountain.

1100
00:57:38,017 --> 00:57:40,219
Look at me.
I'm 60 years old.

1101
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,189
I look like I'm 80.

1102
00:57:44,357 --> 00:57:46,459
I feel like I'm a hundred.

1103
00:57:50,196 --> 00:57:52,131
I got a wife that hates me.

1104
00:57:55,634 --> 00:57:57,703
Well, she just left,
actually.

1105
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:03,609
I got a cock that doesn't
work without a fucking pill.

1106
00:58:08,114 --> 00:58:09,448
My best buddy,

1107
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,653
since we were little knuckleheads
playing Pee Wee football...

1108
00:58:16,155 --> 00:58:19,058
My best friend, Clint,
just died of blood cancer.

1109
00:58:21,127 --> 00:58:22,661
Just like that.

1110
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:27,333
Forty years ago, I was you.

1111
00:58:28,534 --> 00:58:30,136
I was you, men.

1112
00:58:31,137 --> 00:58:33,039
Magnificent.

1113
00:58:33,172 --> 00:58:36,609
Quarterback of my little
college in North Dakota.

1114
00:58:37,843 --> 00:58:41,680
I had dreams, and I had
the energy to chase 'em.

1115
00:58:43,382 --> 00:58:45,684
- And now...
- [snaps fingers]

1116
00:58:49,188 --> 00:58:51,223
...I got one thing left,

1117
00:58:51,357 --> 00:58:54,293
one thing in my life

1118
00:58:55,928 --> 00:58:57,930
that means a damn
to me:

1119
00:59:09,909 --> 00:59:11,243
You men.

1120
00:59:13,612 --> 00:59:14,814
This room.

1121
00:59:19,718 --> 00:59:21,387
This is all I got...

1122
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:27,093
and that's okay.

1123
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:31,597
Believe me,
this is all I need.

1124
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,203
Now, some of you are
looking at me like, "Well...

1125
00:59:37,336 --> 00:59:39,305
bullshit, Coach.

1126
00:59:39,438 --> 00:59:40,574
Come on, now.

1127
00:59:41,407 --> 00:59:42,408
You got money.

1128
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:45,077
You're fucking rich."

1129
00:59:45,211 --> 00:59:48,848
Yeah, I got money I...
I couldn't even conceive of

1130
00:59:48,981 --> 00:59:51,283
when I was you men.

1131
00:59:52,751 --> 00:59:54,920
Believe me
when I tell you this...

1132
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:57,256
Money...

1133
00:59:58,824 --> 01:00:00,226
is shit.

1134
01:00:01,794 --> 01:00:04,063
Money is a numbers game

1135
01:00:04,196 --> 01:00:06,832
played by people
in $5,000 suits

1136
01:00:06,966 --> 01:00:09,802
in New York City offices
for their own benefit.

1137
01:00:09,935 --> 01:00:12,004
There is no glory

1138
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:14,440
in money,

1139
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:18,644
no life-altering challenge
in money.

1140
01:00:18,777 --> 01:00:21,780
There is no confrontation
with your deepest fears

1141
01:00:21,914 --> 01:00:26,285
and therefore your greatness,
in fucking money.

1142
01:00:27,987 --> 01:00:29,288
Oh, my God.

1143
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:31,790
What I wouldn't give
to be you men

1144
01:00:33,092 --> 01:00:34,460
right now.

1145
01:00:36,128 --> 01:00:38,364
One day away
from glorious battle

1146
01:00:38,497 --> 01:00:40,634
alongside
your band of brothers

1147
01:00:40,766 --> 01:00:44,604
in front of a hundred million
people all over the world.

1148
01:00:44,737 --> 01:00:46,305
Glory.

1149
01:00:48,307 --> 01:00:51,911
The greatest glory
you are ever gonna feel.

1150
01:00:53,512 --> 01:00:56,515
Do you want
to give that up?

1151
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:00,052
For those of you who were
thinking about boycotting,

1152
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,155
you've made your point.

1153
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:05,124
They are gonna have to change.

1154
01:01:06,158 --> 01:01:07,726
'Cause they heard you.

1155
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,496
They are scared
shitless.

1156
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:13,533
It's beautiful.
It's fucking hilarious.

1157
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:16,468
Change is coming.
Meaningful change.

1158
01:01:16,603 --> 01:01:18,572
Trust me on that.

1159
01:01:19,905 --> 01:01:22,174
Every one of you has worked

1160
01:01:22,308 --> 01:01:26,212
your whole fucking life
for this moment.

1161
01:01:27,379 --> 01:01:31,217
Don't rob yourselves
of your destiny.

1162
01:01:32,184 --> 01:01:34,019
Glory is at hand.

1163
01:01:36,188 --> 01:01:37,657
Glory

1164
01:01:38,724 --> 01:01:40,594
is yours.

1165
01:01:40,726 --> 01:01:43,862
Glory is ours!

1166
01:01:46,131 --> 01:01:47,567
Glory!

1167
01:01:49,835 --> 01:01:51,070
Take it.

1168
01:02:15,562 --> 01:02:18,964
I heard
it was a great speech.

1169
01:02:19,098 --> 01:02:23,135
Now, let's prove to them that LeMarcus
is only doing this for his own benefit,

1170
01:02:23,269 --> 01:02:24,903
so you have enough players

1171
01:02:25,037 --> 01:02:28,107
not only to play this thing,
but to win.

1172
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:32,679
Do you need a minute,
Coach?

1173
01:02:32,811 --> 01:02:35,582
You need to
collect yourself? Okay.

1174
01:02:36,782 --> 01:02:38,551
Let's get it over with.

1175
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:41,387
Right.

1176
01:02:43,389 --> 01:02:46,225
[indistinct TV chatter]

1177
01:02:46,358 --> 01:02:48,294
One miner's breakfast.

1178
01:02:49,128 --> 01:02:50,929
Breakfast of champions.

1179
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:52,666
[coughs]

1180
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:56,969
[newscaster] <i>Now, I understand
we have some late-breaking news.</i>

1181
01:02:57,102 --> 01:02:59,438
<i>Yes, we're going
to a live press conference</i>

1182
01:02:59,572 --> 01:03:01,440
<i>with Wolves head coach
James Lazor.</i>

1183
01:03:01,574 --> 01:03:04,510
[reporter 1] <i>Coach Lazor,
when did you first notice,</i>

1184
01:03:04,644 --> 01:03:06,445
<i>LeMarcus James' knee?</i>

1185
01:03:07,413 --> 01:03:09,081
[sighs]

1186
01:03:10,449 --> 01:03:12,351
Well, I had noticed
a slight limp,

1187
01:03:12,484 --> 01:03:14,853
uh, after week three,

1188
01:03:14,987 --> 01:03:18,157
but I just chalked it up to, you
know, the usual bumps and bruises.

1189
01:03:19,759 --> 01:03:21,460
So, I was, um...

1190
01:03:22,961 --> 01:03:24,963
I was disappointed
when I found out

1191
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:27,866
<i>that he'd been concealing
something more serious.</i>

1192
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,637
- I can't believe Coach is doing this.
- [reporter 2] <i>Do you think</i>

1193
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:32,905
<i>he concealed his injury
to protect his draft status?</i>

1194
01:03:33,038 --> 01:03:35,742
<i>I don't know. He's gonna have
to pass a very thorough physical</i>

1195
01:03:35,874 --> 01:03:37,309
<i>before the draft, so...</i>

1196
01:03:38,578 --> 01:03:41,380
They found that MRI quick.
Their man's good.

1197
01:03:41,513 --> 01:03:43,949
[reporter 3] <i>Do you feel he was
manipulating his teammates</i>

1198
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:46,018
<i>to cash in
on the national title game?</i>

1199
01:03:46,151 --> 01:03:48,320
<i>I guess you'd have
to ask his teammates that.</i>

1200
01:03:48,454 --> 01:03:51,523
Coach, do you feel
that this is a further example

1201
01:03:51,658 --> 01:03:53,892
of a form of modern-day
slave trade?

1202
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:02,569
I-I'm sorry. I guess I don't
understand that question.

1203
01:04:02,702 --> 01:04:06,038
The physical. Like inspecting a
slave's teeth to determine the price.

1204
01:04:06,171 --> 01:04:07,841
Only now, it's his knees.

1205
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:16,048
Well, if you call getting
a free top-tier education

1206
01:04:16,181 --> 01:04:20,519
and four years of first-class
accommodations and nutrition,

1207
01:04:20,653 --> 01:04:23,489
<i>not to mention
a sizable living stipend,</i>

1208
01:04:23,623 --> 01:04:26,693
<i>and then toss in a once-
in-a-lifetime opportunity</i>

1209
01:04:26,826 --> 01:04:28,628
<i>to play
in a national title game,</i>

1210
01:04:28,762 --> 01:04:31,063
if we're calling that
the slave trade,

1211
01:04:31,196 --> 01:04:33,265
then I'd love
to be a slave.

1212
01:04:33,399 --> 01:04:35,100
[reporters murmuring]

1213
01:04:35,234 --> 01:04:36,536
Um...

1214
01:04:36,669 --> 01:04:38,237
That's...
That's the last question.

1215
01:04:40,172 --> 01:04:41,940
Well, that
already went viral.

1216
01:04:42,074 --> 01:04:43,375
[scoffs]

1217
01:04:43,509 --> 01:04:45,377
[reporters clamoring]

1218
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:49,415
Call Greeny.

1219
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,852
Tell him
we're going live.

1220
01:04:52,985 --> 01:04:54,788
Splash it
all over Twitter too.

1221
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:58,257
<i>I am joined now
by LeMarcus James,</i>

1222
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:00,292
<i>who won this year's
Heisman Trophy</i>

1223
01:05:00,426 --> 01:05:04,096
<i>and has now rocked the entire
world of sports and well beyond</i>

1224
01:05:04,229 --> 01:05:06,633
<i>with his boycott
of the national title game,</i>

1225
01:05:06,766 --> 01:05:08,967
<i>which is scheduled for
tomorrow in New Orleans.</i>

1226
01:05:09,101 --> 01:05:11,704
<i>LeMarcus, I'm gonna jump right into
the question everyone is asking.</i>

1227
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:15,407
<i>Are you boycotting this game
and demanding compensation</i>

1228
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:17,811
<i>because of an unfortunate
medical condition</i>

1229
01:05:17,943 --> 01:05:20,613
<i>that could jeopardize
your status in the draft?</i>

1230
01:05:20,747 --> 01:05:22,114
Good morning, Greeny.

1231
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:24,751
The answer is no.
Unequivocally, no.

1232
01:05:25,785 --> 01:05:27,654
I have no cartilage
in my left knee.

1233
01:05:27,787 --> 01:05:30,790
It'll degenerate over time.
Maybe eight years, maybe 20.

1234
01:05:30,924 --> 01:05:32,759
But name me an NFL team
that wouldn't take

1235
01:05:32,892 --> 01:05:34,794
eight to 20 years
of elite quarterback play.

1236
01:05:34,928 --> 01:05:37,530
<i>You see, the reality is,
this isn't about me.</i>

1237
01:05:37,664 --> 01:05:39,331
<i>This is about
our current system.</i>

1238
01:05:39,465 --> 01:05:41,967
<i>It's about my fellow
D-I athletes and teammates</i>

1239
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,502
<i>who have fallen victim to,</i>

1240
01:05:43,636 --> 01:05:45,772
<i>quite frankly,
a plantation mentality.</i>

1241
01:05:45,905 --> 01:05:47,841
[Greenberg] <i>I wanna talk
about that mentality.</i>

1242
01:05:47,973 --> 01:05:49,909
That's fucking rich.

1243
01:05:50,042 --> 01:05:52,277
<i>'Cause clearly, that is at the
center of this entire conversation.</i>

1244
01:05:52,411 --> 01:05:54,012
<i>Your coach, just today,</i>

1245
01:05:54,146 --> 01:05:56,749
<i>said this is a system
he'd love to be a part of</i>

1246
01:05:56,883 --> 01:05:59,819
<i>and even invoked
the tragic word "slavery."</i>

1247
01:05:59,953 --> 01:06:02,187
<i>I have to ask you,
do you feel</i>

1248
01:06:02,321 --> 01:06:05,692
<i>this is a slave trade
of a different kind?</i>

1249
01:06:05,825 --> 01:06:10,162
- [LeMarcus] <i>Can I give you another comparison, Greeny?</i>
- <i>Yeah, of course.</i>

1250
01:06:10,295 --> 01:06:13,666
This is the home of my best friend
and teammate, Emmett Sunday.

1251
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,301
Emmett's father is a farmer
outside Lincoln, Nebraska,

1252
01:06:16,435 --> 01:06:18,270
and his mother
is a teacher's assistant.

1253
01:06:18,403 --> 01:06:20,172
They've saved up
a little bit for retirement,

1254
01:06:20,305 --> 01:06:22,307
but mostly, they just live
month to month.

1255
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:25,845
One swollen appendix,
one turned ankle from insolvency.

1256
01:06:25,979 --> 01:06:28,380
Now, their son, Emmett Sunday,
has been a four-year starter

1257
01:06:28,514 --> 01:06:30,683
for one of the best college
programs in the country.

1258
01:06:30,817 --> 01:06:32,451
<i>Tomorrow,
he'll play in a game</i>

1259
01:06:32,585 --> 01:06:34,687
<i>that'll gross over
a half a billion dollars.</i>

1260
01:06:34,821 --> 01:06:36,723
<i>Half a billion dollars
for a single game.</i>

1261
01:06:36,856 --> 01:06:38,257
<i>And Emmett
won't see a dime.</i>

1262
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:39,859
<i>His football days
will be over.</i>

1263
01:06:39,993 --> 01:06:42,427
<i>Zero compensation,
zero medical insurance</i>

1264
01:06:42,562 --> 01:06:45,130
<i>for the injuries he's sustained,
some of them permanent.</i>

1265
01:06:45,264 --> 01:06:46,833
And now, this...

1266
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,003
is the Palm Beach
vacation home

1267
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:52,237
<i>for my coach,
James Lazor.</i>

1268
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,642
<i>This is
his Chicago penthouse.</i>

1269
01:06:57,844 --> 01:07:00,045
<i>This is his
six-bedroom Craftsman,</i>

1270
01:07:00,178 --> 01:07:01,714
<i>where he stays
during the season.</i>

1271
01:07:01,848 --> 01:07:03,248
<i>His work home.</i>

1272
01:07:03,382 --> 01:07:05,585
<i>Now, Coach has profited
off a system</i>

1273
01:07:05,718 --> 01:07:07,887
<i>that is entirely based
on free labor.</i>

1274
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:10,455
<i>We're not playing in any games
until those who actually play...</i>

1275
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:13,458
<i>And not just the superstars.
All athletes, down to the special teams...</i>

1276
01:07:13,593 --> 01:07:16,596
- Jesus.
- <i>...are considered and compensated.</i>

1277
01:07:16,729 --> 01:07:18,531
- [Orlando sighs]
- <i>Now.</i>

1278
01:07:18,665 --> 01:07:20,667
This crazy motherfucker.
[chuckles]

1279
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,235
<i>There you have it,
directly from LeMarcus James.</i>

1280
01:07:23,368 --> 01:07:25,738
- <i>LeMarcus, thank you very much.</i>
- All right, LeMarcus.

1281
01:07:25,872 --> 01:07:28,407
[Greenberg] <i>I appreciate the time.
We'll take a short break,</i>

1282
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:30,677
<i>and be back with more
in just a moment.</i>

1283
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:33,111
What the calamitous fuck?

1284
01:07:33,245 --> 01:07:35,648
We've been goddamn
outflanked by two kids,

1285
01:07:35,782 --> 01:07:37,449
like we're
in <i>Scooby</i> fucking Doo.

1286
01:07:37,584 --> 01:07:39,652
Oh, you know what
the dipshit sidekick did

1287
01:07:39,786 --> 01:07:42,087
when LeMarcus
was grandstanding on TV?

1288
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,488
- [Katherine] Sunday.
- Huh?

1289
01:07:43,623 --> 01:07:45,324
His name is
Emmett Sunday.

1290
01:07:45,457 --> 01:07:47,092
Oh, thank God
we got that all cleared up.

1291
01:07:47,225 --> 01:07:51,531
Emmett fucking-us-sideways
Sunday leaks my Nike contract.

1292
01:07:51,664 --> 01:07:53,733
Now every New York City
zig-zag's

1293
01:07:53,866 --> 01:07:56,101
asking me where
$30 million a year goes.

1294
01:07:56,234 --> 01:07:57,570
[Katherine]
Where does it go?

1295
01:07:57,704 --> 01:07:59,271
How the hell do I know?

1296
01:07:59,404 --> 01:08:01,373
You're the head
of the conference.

1297
01:08:01,506 --> 01:08:02,709
Excuse me?

1298
01:08:02,842 --> 01:08:04,744
You're the head
of your conference.

1299
01:08:04,877 --> 01:08:07,780
You should be able to answer a layup
like where your sneaker money goes.

1300
01:08:08,948 --> 01:08:10,683
Okay.

1301
01:08:10,817 --> 01:08:11,985
Band fields.

1302
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:13,686
- Softball stadiums.
- [cell phone chimes]

1303
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:16,956
Turquoise-green Bermuda fucking sod.
Where else?

1304
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:19,224
Orlando Bishop
just tweeted this.

1305
01:08:19,358 --> 01:08:20,827
- He's out.
- [Everly] That's cute.

1306
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,929
We got four players
threatening to walk now too.

1307
01:08:23,062 --> 01:08:24,463
How are these two
even doing this?

1308
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:26,099
I still think
Coach Lazor's the one

1309
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:27,834
to talk LeMarcus
off this ledge.

1310
01:08:27,967 --> 01:08:30,003
He walks him back,
they'll all follow.

1311
01:08:30,135 --> 01:08:31,904
Where's your coach now?

1312
01:08:32,038 --> 01:08:34,373
He's, uh,
taking a minute.

1313
01:08:34,506 --> 01:08:35,842
[Katherine]
He's tanking.

1314
01:08:35,975 --> 01:08:37,777
- He's fine.
- [Mike] What does he need?

1315
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:39,779
- A divorce lawyer.
- [Everly chuckles]

1316
01:08:39,912 --> 01:08:42,280
[Everly] He's fine, I said.
Lazor or no Lazor,

1317
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:43,950
we're putting two teams
on the field tomorrow,

1318
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:46,085
even if we gotta dress
the damn cheerleaders.

1319
01:08:46,218 --> 01:08:48,320
Who's second in line
if Lazor can't go?

1320
01:08:48,453 --> 01:08:52,391
I guess, uh, Ronnie Dunn,
defensive coordinator.

1321
01:08:52,524 --> 01:08:54,459
- You trust him?
- Yeah. Company man.

1322
01:08:54,594 --> 01:08:56,461
Been at the university
since a player himself,

1323
01:08:56,596 --> 01:08:58,363
so, yeah, he'll take
marching orders.

1324
01:08:58,497 --> 01:09:00,800
- You sure?
- This a fucking inquisition?

1325
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:04,403
I don't trust anyone with a
vested pension and Medicare.

1326
01:09:05,605 --> 01:09:07,305
Oh, God. You know what?

1327
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,508
Fuck you very much.

1328
01:09:09,642 --> 01:09:12,945
All right? I need this shit
like I need a third tit.

1329
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:15,380
I will march
my entire conference

1330
01:09:15,514 --> 01:09:17,016
right out that door,

1331
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:21,554
put together my own
play-offs without any of you.

1332
01:09:21,688 --> 01:09:23,156
How do you like me?

1333
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:25,357
You'd be in breach
of 16 different contracts,

1334
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:29,162
squander a $100-million payday
for tomorrow alone.

1335
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:32,532
Not to mention what I imagine
would be a full audit

1336
01:09:32,665 --> 01:09:35,802
of SEC expenses
under your tenure.

1337
01:09:35,935 --> 01:09:38,838
You know, to make sure that those
band fields, softball stadiums

1338
01:09:38,971 --> 01:09:42,709
and turquoise-green Bermuda
sod weren't really just

1339
01:09:42,842 --> 01:09:46,211
high-paid escorts
in New York City

1340
01:09:46,344 --> 01:09:49,448
at the Bemelman Bar
of the Carlyle.

1341
01:09:53,619 --> 01:09:56,521
Bouncing 'em out of your
apartment three at a time, right?

1342
01:10:04,664 --> 01:10:06,231
Fuck you.

1343
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:07,900
[scoffs]

1344
01:10:09,301 --> 01:10:10,536
Hoo!

1345
01:10:15,675 --> 01:10:17,877
[person] <i>We're still
24 hours away</i>

1346
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,213
<i>from the Snickers
National Title game.</i>

1347
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:22,280
- <i>Only the biggest game...</i>
- [person 2] <i>Man, these guys</i>

1348
01:10:22,414 --> 01:10:23,950
<i>are already getting
free education.</i>

1349
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:26,284
<i>Money is just
gonna ruin it.</i>

1350
01:10:26,418 --> 01:10:28,187
<i>They aren't ready for all that money.
I wasn't when I was 18.</i>

1351
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,522
[person 3] <i>I don't know
if this man is a racist,</i>

1352
01:10:30,656 --> 01:10:32,792
<i>but what I do know
is that he made a fortune</i>

1353
01:10:32,925 --> 01:10:36,195
<i>mostly off the backs
of young Black men.</i>

1354
01:10:37,329 --> 01:10:38,931
[Bailey] <i>Question.</i>

1355
01:10:39,065 --> 01:10:41,433
<i>If I hadn't stayed here
to explain to you</i>

1356
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:45,004
<i>that I was leaving,
would you have noticed I'd gone?</i>

1357
01:10:46,806 --> 01:10:48,975
[panting]

1358
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,594
[indistinct chattering]

1359
01:11:08,728 --> 01:11:10,663
[person]
Coach! Coach Lazor!

1360
01:11:10,797 --> 01:11:13,331
- [person 2] Oh, my God. Look, it's Coach Lazor.
- [people clamoring]

1361
01:11:13,465 --> 01:11:15,333
- [person 3] Hey, Coach, can we get a picture?
- Sorry, buddy.

1362
01:11:15,467 --> 01:11:18,271
It's just really not a good time, okay?
Sorry, sorry...

1363
01:11:18,403 --> 01:11:21,107
- [clamoring continues]
- Okay, not now!

1364
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,509
Hey, give him some space.
Give him some space.

1365
01:11:24,644 --> 01:11:26,112
No pictures! No pictures!

1366
01:11:26,245 --> 01:11:27,580
Have a good game, Coach!

1367
01:11:44,997 --> 01:11:47,567
[Everly] <i>Now, I know for a fact
that LeMarcus and the guys,</i>

1368
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,367
<i>they respect
the hell out of you,</i>

1369
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:54,807
and you would be the first
African-American head coach

1370
01:11:54,941 --> 01:11:59,712
to lead a team onto the field
for a national title game.

1371
01:12:00,546 --> 01:12:02,148
Hell,

1372
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:04,516
hopefully win the thing, huh?

1373
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:06,886
Let's make history together.

1374
01:12:24,136 --> 01:12:26,504
<i>The NCAA may have started
with this...</i>

1375
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:28,741
- [Emmett groans]
- <i>...imaginary pie-in-the-sky idea</i>

1376
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:31,310
<i>that it was about amateurism,
and at one point it was.</i>

1377
01:12:31,443 --> 01:12:34,847
<i>But then there was a turn,
and it became about money.</i>

1378
01:12:34,981 --> 01:12:37,817
- [knocking]
- <i>Plain and simple. I thought this was America.</i>

1379
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:39,719
- [coughing]
- Yeah?

1380
01:12:39,852 --> 01:12:41,587
It's Coach Dunn.

1381
01:12:43,289 --> 01:12:45,091
[Emmett] You all
by your lonesome?

1382
01:12:45,224 --> 01:12:47,693
- [groans]
- [Coach Dunn] It's just me.

1383
01:12:47,827 --> 01:12:49,562
[door unlocks]

1384
01:12:50,563 --> 01:12:51,597
Coach?

1385
01:12:51,731 --> 01:12:54,399
You two are really hard
to find.

1386
01:12:54,533 --> 01:12:57,370
It's easier to find Bigfoot
than to find you two.

1387
01:12:58,371 --> 01:13:00,072
Look, relax.
I won't tell Lazor.

1388
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,875
[chuckles softly]
You know something?

1389
01:13:03,009 --> 01:13:05,410
I gotta give credit
to you two, actually.

1390
01:13:05,544 --> 01:13:08,080
I'm really surprised
you was able to pull this off.

1391
01:13:10,116 --> 01:13:11,817
But you got trouble.

1392
01:13:13,052 --> 01:13:15,121
Yep, they still gonna
play the game.

1393
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:19,125
With 19 freshmen?

1394
01:13:20,026 --> 01:13:21,560
Cornelius?

1395
01:13:21,694 --> 01:13:23,396
They don't care who plays
as long as it's on TV.

1396
01:13:23,528 --> 01:13:25,598
[Emmett scoffs]

1397
01:13:25,731 --> 01:13:27,600
The shit bowl.

1398
01:13:27,733 --> 01:13:29,735
[Coach Dunn] They shitting
their pants right now.

1399
01:13:29,869 --> 01:13:31,904
They got so desperate,
they approached me

1400
01:13:32,038 --> 01:13:33,973
and said
If Lazor doesn't show up,

1401
01:13:34,106 --> 01:13:36,042
I can bring the team
out to the field.

1402
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:39,111
So, Coach is sitting?

1403
01:13:39,245 --> 01:13:41,113
[sighs] I don't know, man.
It's really hard to tell right now,

1404
01:13:41,247 --> 01:13:42,949
but it looks like it.

1405
01:13:43,082 --> 01:13:44,050
Damn.

1406
01:13:44,183 --> 01:13:46,352
So, what you gonna do?

1407
01:13:46,518 --> 01:13:49,021
The first Black head coach
in a national title game?

1408
01:13:49,155 --> 01:13:50,856
It's a big deal.

1409
01:13:52,124 --> 01:13:55,361
I ain't no fucking pawn.
Hell, no, I'm not doing it.

1410
01:13:55,493 --> 01:13:57,462
I'm one of best defensive
coaches in this country.

1411
01:13:57,596 --> 01:13:58,965
I don't need
no fucking handouts.

1412
01:13:59,098 --> 01:14:00,498
Amen, Coach.

1413
01:14:00,633 --> 01:14:02,101
We feel the same way.

1414
01:14:02,234 --> 01:14:04,370
Even if this whole thing
goes up in a ball of flames,

1415
01:14:04,502 --> 01:14:06,272
we're not stepping
on that field.

1416
01:14:08,774 --> 01:14:11,610
Look, y'all. Have I ever told
you the Hannibal Lawson story?

1417
01:14:11,744 --> 01:14:13,879
- Who?
- Hannibal Lawson.

1418
01:14:14,013 --> 01:14:17,083
So, Han Lawson, to me, was one
of the best defensive tackles

1419
01:14:17,216 --> 01:14:18,951
in Louisiana
high school history.

1420
01:14:19,085 --> 01:14:20,853
He went on to LSU.

1421
01:14:20,987 --> 01:14:22,955
You know, a bright future.

1422
01:14:24,056 --> 01:14:25,791
He got his knee shredded
in practice.

1423
01:14:25,925 --> 01:14:28,627
And the result of that,
they took his scholarship away.

1424
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:32,798
But Hannibal did
something interesting.

1425
01:14:32,932 --> 01:14:35,835
He hired a lawyer in a cheap suit
with some night-school degree,

1426
01:14:35,968 --> 01:14:38,704
and he sued the NCAA
for workmen's comp.

1427
01:14:38,838 --> 01:14:40,706
- Smart, right?
- Yeah.

1428
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,142
Went all the way to
the Louisiana Supreme Court.

1429
01:14:43,275 --> 01:14:44,944
[Emmett] What happened?

1430
01:14:45,077 --> 01:14:46,846
Student-athlete.

1431
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:49,315
[Coach Dunn] Yeah, they said he
was nothing but a student-athlete.

1432
01:14:49,448 --> 01:14:51,484
They didn't consider him an employee,
even though they were selling

1433
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:53,285
hundreds and thousands
of tickets

1434
01:14:53,419 --> 01:14:55,921
every fucking Saturday,
making millions of dollars!

1435
01:14:56,055 --> 01:14:59,558
You're breaking your body every
fucking practice and every game.

1436
01:14:59,692 --> 01:15:02,328
And whenever they decide to take the
scholarship away from you, they can,

1437
01:15:02,461 --> 01:15:03,996
whenever the fuck
they feel like it.

1438
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:06,932
That's a crazy,
sick system.

1439
01:15:07,066 --> 01:15:10,236
And maybe you two will change it.
I don't know.

1440
01:15:10,369 --> 01:15:14,006
But I want y'all to understand something.
There's a lot of Han Lawsons out here.

1441
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:16,675
Survival of the fittest.

1442
01:15:18,377 --> 01:15:20,146
America.

1443
01:15:21,614 --> 01:15:23,582
This little pigskin football
right here

1444
01:15:23,716 --> 01:15:25,084
holds a lot of weight to it.

1445
01:15:25,217 --> 01:15:27,019
It's more than a game.

1446
01:15:27,153 --> 01:15:28,921
It's a fucking business.

1447
01:15:33,459 --> 01:15:34,827
Hey, Coach.

1448
01:15:35,861 --> 01:15:37,596
Thank you.

1449
01:15:38,564 --> 01:15:40,032
Good luck, fellas.

1450
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:43,235
[coughs]

1451
01:15:46,372 --> 01:15:48,574
- [sighs]
- [door closes]

1452
01:15:48,707 --> 01:15:50,544
We're gonna need Cecil
on board.

1453
01:15:50,676 --> 01:15:54,213
We both don't play,
the advertisers will start pulling out.

1454
01:15:55,549 --> 01:15:56,949
It's the only way.

1455
01:15:57,950 --> 01:16:00,086
[blues rock music playing]

1456
01:16:00,219 --> 01:16:02,388
[Rodgers] Take a little more
of the edge off.

1457
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:06,425
Gotta let it out.

1458
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,428
If you don't, it just stays inside
you, it becomes poison.

1459
01:16:09,563 --> 01:16:11,263
[Taylor sighs]

1460
01:16:11,397 --> 01:16:14,100
- Okay, what's the plan?
- Damn it.

1461
01:16:14,233 --> 01:16:16,168
I can't even focus
on that right now.

1462
01:16:16,302 --> 01:16:19,605
Well, you... you got to.
You gotta bifurcate.

1463
01:16:19,738 --> 01:16:23,976
Uh, I don't know what that means,
but I think I get the gist of it.

1464
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:25,945
About to lose 500,000
'cause of LeMarcus.

1465
01:16:26,078 --> 01:16:27,146
- [Rodgers] Taylor.
- He fucked us.

1466
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:28,582
- Put the phone down.
- He fucked us.

1467
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:30,382
- Put the phone down.
- All right.

1468
01:16:30,516 --> 01:16:33,085
Coach, I know you don't want
to hear this right now.

1469
01:16:33,219 --> 01:16:36,122
I've been married
three times myself.

1470
01:16:36,255 --> 01:16:38,424
But the hurt goes away.

1471
01:16:38,558 --> 01:16:39,825
Poof.

1472
01:16:39,959 --> 01:16:41,994
One day, just like that.
Gone.

1473
01:16:42,128 --> 01:16:44,830
I'm telling you,
Bailey's my one and only.

1474
01:16:44,964 --> 01:16:47,967
And she's gone.
And it's my own goddamn fault.

1475
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,668
[Taylor] Coach,
no offense at all.

1476
01:16:49,802 --> 01:16:51,737
Your love life,
that's your thing.

1477
01:16:51,871 --> 01:16:53,339
Your racial views,
that's your thing.

1478
01:16:53,472 --> 01:16:55,875
But we have a national
title in less than 24 hours.

1479
01:16:56,008 --> 01:16:58,310
- Can you please just focus on that?
- Fucking racial views?

1480
01:16:58,444 --> 01:16:59,945
First of all,
one goddamn reporter

1481
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:01,514
baits me into saying
something stupid.

1482
01:17:01,647 --> 01:17:03,149
I know
you're not racist.

1483
01:17:03,282 --> 01:17:04,884
I'm just saying we got
the game to focus on, okay?

1484
01:17:05,017 --> 01:17:06,752
- That's all I'm saying.
- What fucking game?

1485
01:17:06,886 --> 01:17:08,821
- I don't have a goddamn team.
- Less than 24 hours.

1486
01:17:08,954 --> 01:17:12,158
I'm supposed to walk out of that
tunnel with... with freshmen.

1487
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:14,727
- Nobody's askin' you...
- and go in there and get our ass kicked?

1488
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:17,564
- You gotta figure it out.
- That's not competition. That's a fucking slaughter.

1489
01:17:17,696 --> 01:17:19,198
I'm doing what I can.

1490
01:17:19,331 --> 01:17:21,300
You gotta do better, Coach.
You're under contract.

1491
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:23,135
Con...
Fuck that contract.

1492
01:17:23,269 --> 01:17:25,704
Are you talking to me about
the fucking contract right now?

1493
01:17:25,838 --> 01:17:27,339
I could walk
across the street tomorrow

1494
01:17:27,473 --> 01:17:29,341
and get another contract
if they find me in breach.

1495
01:17:29,475 --> 01:17:31,710
I don't give a shit.
I don't need the goddamn money anyway.

1496
01:17:31,844 --> 01:17:33,212
Coach,
you're hurtin' right now.

1497
01:17:33,345 --> 01:17:36,550
Let's just give it
an hour or two.

1498
01:17:36,682 --> 01:17:38,350
See the state of play.

1499
01:17:38,484 --> 01:17:41,655
It's best not to make
any decisions feeling this way.

1500
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:44,723
Tell you what.
It's the ones

1501
01:17:44,857 --> 01:17:47,661
that are closest to us
that hurt us the most.

1502
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:08,881
You as good
as they say you are?

1503
01:18:09,014 --> 01:18:11,717
To which of my many talents
are you referring?

1504
01:18:13,018 --> 01:18:15,421
There was a fight
that no one knows about.

1505
01:18:15,555 --> 01:18:17,890
A real brawl.
A kid got hurt bad.

1506
01:18:18,023 --> 01:18:21,227
- I'll alert the authorities.
- Oh, they know.

1507
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,763
He's blind in one eye now
and got a hole in his skull.

1508
01:18:26,432 --> 01:18:29,435
But money talks,
and NDAs don't.

1509
01:18:34,641 --> 01:18:36,075
I'm listening.

1510
01:18:38,844 --> 01:18:40,212
LeMarcus.

1511
01:18:42,314 --> 01:18:43,550
[shower running]

1512
01:18:43,683 --> 01:18:46,452
[practicing Italian]

1513
01:18:46,586 --> 01:18:49,355
Oh, crap, I think I just called
you my pistachio. [laughs]

1514
01:18:49,488 --> 01:18:52,958
Your phone sucks.
Is mine in there?

1515
01:18:53,092 --> 01:18:54,694
It is here.

1516
01:18:54,827 --> 01:18:56,563
[Bailey] Ah.

1517
01:18:56,696 --> 01:18:59,832
You just got a text from
a guy named Mike Titus.

1518
01:18:59,965 --> 01:19:01,800
What? Crap.

1519
01:19:01,934 --> 01:19:05,404
I just must have grabbed James'
personal one again by accident.

1520
01:19:05,538 --> 01:19:09,341
[Italian accent] Can you bring it to
me, <i>mi</i> pistachio?

1521
01:19:10,776 --> 01:19:12,811
It's probably goin' ape-shit
right now.

1522
01:19:12,945 --> 01:19:14,947
After everything we've done
for LeMarcus.

1523
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,417
Every single one of those kids
are spoiled brats.

1524
01:19:18,551 --> 01:19:20,452
Spoiled freaking brats.

1525
01:19:20,587 --> 01:19:22,988
Geez. [chuckles]

1526
01:19:23,122 --> 01:19:27,159
Oh, I cannot wait
to go to Rome.

1527
01:19:27,293 --> 01:19:30,129
There's this one place
that I want to eat at,

1528
01:19:30,262 --> 01:19:33,432
and they still have the bullet
holes in the walls from the war.

1529
01:19:33,566 --> 01:19:37,102
Do you see this?
Probably not, 'cause your phone stinks.

1530
01:19:40,873 --> 01:19:41,974
What?

1531
01:19:44,877 --> 01:19:46,812
I've been helping LeMarcus.

1532
01:19:49,549 --> 01:19:51,283
What?

1533
01:19:51,417 --> 01:19:53,185
You know, with his boycott.

1534
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:54,920
That's why I'm here.

1535
01:19:56,556 --> 01:19:58,357
I don't get it.

1536
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:02,696
He came to me after class.

1537
01:20:03,697 --> 01:20:05,164
And... [sighs]

1538
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:07,801
...what was I gonna do?

1539
01:20:08,768 --> 01:20:10,737
Be another
tenured paper tiger?

1540
01:20:12,304 --> 01:20:14,406
Teaching organized labor
five days a week,

1541
01:20:14,541 --> 01:20:16,909
then hide behind my desk
when one of my own students

1542
01:20:17,042 --> 01:20:19,211
actually wants
to do something about it?

1543
01:20:21,113 --> 01:20:22,881
So...

1544
01:20:23,015 --> 01:20:24,383
I helped him

1545
01:20:25,517 --> 01:20:27,486
with his strategy

1546
01:20:28,287 --> 01:20:29,922
any way I could.

1547
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:33,125
It's funny.

1548
01:20:33,258 --> 01:20:35,361
LeMarcus knew
the rumors about us,

1549
01:20:35,494 --> 01:20:37,229
like everybody else.

1550
01:20:37,363 --> 01:20:39,164
Except your husband,
of course.

1551
01:20:40,466 --> 01:20:43,703
And you, calling LeMarcus
a spoiled brat,

1552
01:20:44,671 --> 01:20:48,240
especially when he has
so much to lose.

1553
01:20:50,175 --> 01:20:53,713
- Maybe you're more part of the system than you think.
- Get out.

1554
01:20:55,849 --> 01:20:58,016
[voice breaking]
Get the fuck out of here.

1555
01:21:02,689 --> 01:21:03,956
Leave!

1556
01:21:14,701 --> 01:21:16,068
[door closes]

1557
01:21:19,037 --> 01:21:20,105
[sobs]

1558
01:21:27,045 --> 01:21:28,748
[whispers] Fuck me.

1559
01:21:28,882 --> 01:21:30,048
[sobs]

1560
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,569
[knocking]

1561
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:55,708
[sighs]

1562
01:22:05,618 --> 01:22:07,821
Oh, sorry. I think
we got the wrong room.

1563
01:22:07,953 --> 01:22:09,823
No.
This room is Cecil's.

1564
01:22:09,955 --> 01:22:12,291
Come in.
We don't have a lot of time.

1565
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,168
My name's Katherine Poe.
I come bearing gifts.

1566
01:22:23,302 --> 01:22:25,270
You need my phone?

1567
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:30,042
You look rough.

1568
01:22:30,175 --> 01:22:32,311
Just a cold.

1569
01:22:32,444 --> 01:22:33,947
Where's Cecil?

1570
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:36,683
They're in a suite
ten floors up, playing <i>2K.</i>

1571
01:22:38,150 --> 01:22:39,619
No, wait.

1572
01:22:39,752 --> 01:22:42,087
[chuckles] You haven't
even heard my offer yet.

1573
01:22:42,221 --> 01:22:44,824
It's a pretty good offer.
A lot of wonderful things.

1574
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:46,693
A lot of meat
on the bone.

1575
01:22:51,898 --> 01:22:53,465
Okay.

1576
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,434
What you got?

1577
01:22:55,568 --> 01:22:57,871
I send the best concierge
doctor in New Orleans,

1578
01:22:58,003 --> 01:22:59,639
Dr. Eric, to your room.

1579
01:22:59,772 --> 01:23:03,208
He gives you an IV, a Z-Pak,
you get plenty of rest,

1580
01:23:03,342 --> 01:23:05,511
you and your team
play the game,

1581
01:23:06,846 --> 01:23:08,982
and you go number one
overall in April.

1582
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:10,516
All your dreams
come true.

1583
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:12,251
And...

1584
01:23:12,384 --> 01:23:15,187
I will personally
make sure

1585
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,725
that the NCAA forms
an exploratory committee

1586
01:23:18,858 --> 01:23:21,995
to fully monetize
amateur athletics.

1587
01:23:22,127 --> 01:23:24,429
- "Exploratory committee"?
- Yeah, that's gonna be a pass.

1588
01:23:24,564 --> 01:23:27,567
[Katherine] No, wait.
You haven't heard the cherry on top.

1589
01:23:28,835 --> 01:23:31,004
Best part is,
you don't go to jail.

1590
01:23:32,906 --> 01:23:35,240
[scoffs] For boycottin'
a football game?

1591
01:23:35,374 --> 01:23:38,578
For the attempted murder
of K.C. Walton.

1592
01:23:43,616 --> 01:23:44,984
[Emmett] Wow.

1593
01:23:46,019 --> 01:23:47,954
Wow!

1594
01:23:48,086 --> 01:23:51,490
For the last 48 hours, you guys have
been trying to destroy this man!

1595
01:23:51,624 --> 01:23:53,927
And what, you land
on outright assassination?

1596
01:23:54,059 --> 01:23:57,262
- For what, money?
- K.C. Walton is blind in one eye.

1597
01:23:57,396 --> 01:23:59,431
He has a crack
in his skull,

1598
01:23:59,566 --> 01:24:03,770
and he hasn't walked the same ever
since that fight outside of the, uh,

1599
01:24:03,903 --> 01:24:06,873
Gin Mill Bar and Grill.

1600
01:24:08,908 --> 01:24:10,944
So I spoke to his mother,

1601
01:24:11,076 --> 01:24:12,879
- and she jumped at the idea of being able to...
- [whispers] It's bullshit.

1602
01:24:13,012 --> 01:24:15,147
It's not bullshit!

1603
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,483
She jumped at the idea of being
able to throw out that NDA

1604
01:24:18,618 --> 01:24:21,420
and burn that 100K
that was used to buy them off

1605
01:24:21,554 --> 01:24:23,957
if it meant that
she could find the guys

1606
01:24:24,089 --> 01:24:26,960
who hurt her son
and get paid again.

1607
01:24:27,092 --> 01:24:29,963
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Hey. No.

1608
01:24:31,229 --> 01:24:32,599
She ain't got nothin'.

1609
01:24:32,732 --> 01:24:34,399
Let's get outta here.

1610
01:24:36,368 --> 01:24:37,804
I got Reggie.

1611
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:43,208
Your half-brother.

1612
01:24:48,213 --> 01:24:49,649
So you spoke to him?

1613
01:24:51,216 --> 01:24:53,285
Haven't found him yet.

1614
01:24:53,418 --> 01:24:56,889
When I do, I promise you,
I am going to piece together

1615
01:24:57,023 --> 01:24:59,424
what exactly happened
that night.

1616
01:24:59,559 --> 01:25:02,160
LeMarcus, wake up.

1617
01:25:03,596 --> 01:25:06,398
How do you think it is gonna
look when someone like Reggie,

1618
01:25:06,532 --> 01:25:09,102
who has two felony
possession charges

1619
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:11,169
and assault and battery,
shows up

1620
01:25:11,303 --> 01:25:13,372
in front of an all-white jury
in Missouri

1621
01:25:13,505 --> 01:25:15,008
with
attempted-murder charges

1622
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:18,111
to a guy who is
permanently injured?

1623
01:25:19,344 --> 01:25:21,346
One look at that jack,
and I'd be able to know

1624
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,382
that he was the one
that kicked K.C.'s ass.

1625
01:25:24,316 --> 01:25:26,619
But guess what?
This is America.

1626
01:25:26,753 --> 01:25:29,221
[whispers] Nobody cares
about your brother.

1627
01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:30,990
Nobody.

1628
01:25:32,759 --> 01:25:35,728
[normal voice] The only one they were
able to spot that night in that melee

1629
01:25:35,862 --> 01:25:39,732
was one LeMarcus James,
star quarterback.

1630
01:25:39,866 --> 01:25:42,135
And so the state police
picked you up

1631
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:43,670
and hit you with charges,

1632
01:25:43,803 --> 01:25:45,705
but some
deep-pocketed booster,

1633
01:25:45,838 --> 01:25:47,940
who I think
I just fucking met,

1634
01:25:48,074 --> 01:25:49,142
stepped in

1635
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:51,844
and paid off K.C.
and his family.

1636
01:25:51,978 --> 01:25:53,980
Because that's what we do
in big football, right?

1637
01:25:54,113 --> 01:25:56,616
You protect the phenom

1638
01:25:56,749 --> 01:26:00,385
when he has a chance of bringing
home that national title this year.

1639
01:26:00,519 --> 01:26:02,387
Sound about right?

1640
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:07,827
I suggest you let
Dr. Eric patch you up tonight,

1641
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,496
and then we do a joint press
conference in the morning.

1642
01:26:11,631 --> 01:26:15,367
All the head honchos
up in the penthouse,

1643
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,170
heads bowed,

1644
01:26:17,302 --> 01:26:19,839
agreeing that,
yes, there is a problem.

1645
01:26:21,541 --> 01:26:23,208
And then you play.

1646
01:26:23,341 --> 01:26:26,679
You win, and you get
to take that victory lap

1647
01:26:26,813 --> 01:26:29,448
you have been
dreaming about since...

1648
01:26:29,582 --> 01:26:31,884
since you stood
on the sidelines

1649
01:26:32,018 --> 01:26:34,687
watching your big brother
in north Virginia.

1650
01:26:36,221 --> 01:26:40,459
And then change does come
because of you, eventually.

1651
01:26:40,593 --> 01:26:43,629
And that is something
you both can be proud of.

1652
01:26:44,597 --> 01:26:47,265
I got a question.

1653
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:50,435
Are you completely fucking
heartless, or just a little bit?

1654
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:53,072
- Oh, my God.
- [Emmett] How do you live with yourself?

1655
01:26:53,206 --> 01:26:57,009
- Honestly, how do you live with yourself?
- [shouts] I am not heartless!

1656
01:26:57,143 --> 01:26:59,011
You do not know me!

1657
01:27:00,713 --> 01:27:03,515
You think I don't know
your struggle?

1658
01:27:03,649 --> 01:27:07,319
You think I don't know what you have
come from? That I haven't been there?

1659
01:27:08,386 --> 01:27:10,089
You think I don't know
what it's like

1660
01:27:10,223 --> 01:27:12,257
to be without heat
in your house?

1661
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:13,893
That I don't know
what it's like

1662
01:27:14,026 --> 01:27:16,195
to not be able
to afford your jersey,

1663
01:27:16,328 --> 01:27:17,830
and you are
avoiding your coach

1664
01:27:17,964 --> 01:27:20,566
'cause you don't have
the $50 to pay for it?

1665
01:27:22,267 --> 01:27:24,971
[voice breaking]
I ran track at Duke, okay?

1666
01:27:26,404 --> 01:27:27,774
Full ride.

1667
01:27:27,907 --> 01:27:29,842
No big medals, no big wins.

1668
01:27:29,976 --> 01:27:33,311
But I took that money because it was
the only way I was gonna run myself

1669
01:27:33,445 --> 01:27:36,182
out of that
Red Hook project.

1670
01:27:36,314 --> 01:27:38,918
[scoffs]
You think you know me.

1671
01:27:40,285 --> 01:27:42,155
You don't know me.

1672
01:27:42,287 --> 01:27:46,125
I had to fight and climb

1673
01:27:46,259 --> 01:27:48,594
and crawl to be here

1674
01:27:48,728 --> 01:27:50,730
because I did the work.

1675
01:27:54,066 --> 01:27:59,105
The NCAA spends $3.6 billion

1676
01:27:59,238 --> 01:28:02,809
on student-athlete
scholarships for kids like me,

1677
01:28:02,942 --> 01:28:05,443
like you and like you,

1678
01:28:06,813 --> 01:28:09,015
so that we can get a leg up.

1679
01:28:09,148 --> 01:28:11,083
And what happens
to all of that

1680
01:28:12,151 --> 01:28:14,153
when they start paying you?

1681
01:28:14,287 --> 01:28:15,755
Hmm?

1682
01:28:15,888 --> 01:28:20,126
What happens to volleyball
in Minnesota,

1683
01:28:20,259 --> 01:28:22,161
to soccer in Idaho,

1684
01:28:22,295 --> 01:28:24,462
to softball in South Carolina?

1685
01:28:24,597 --> 01:28:26,966
What happens to
all of those other sports

1686
01:28:27,099 --> 01:28:30,703
that are not men's football
and basketball?

1687
01:28:32,705 --> 01:28:36,242
You out here fighting,
and you forgot who you're fighting for.

1688
01:28:38,811 --> 01:28:41,881
You know, but...
[clears throat, sighs]

1689
01:28:42,982 --> 01:28:44,684
Hey, what do I know?

1690
01:28:45,852 --> 01:28:47,320
I'm heartless.

1691
01:29:00,766 --> 01:29:02,301
[door opens]

1692
01:29:04,036 --> 01:29:05,503
[door closes]

1693
01:29:09,141 --> 01:29:11,344
[crowd chattering]

1694
01:29:24,657 --> 01:29:27,960
[on TV] <i>Hi, everybody, and good morning
from the Big Easy. I'm Steve Levy.</i>

1695
01:29:28,094 --> 01:29:29,729
<i>We are some 12 hours away</i>

1696
01:29:29,862 --> 01:29:32,565
<i>from tonight's Snickers
National Title game.</i>

1697
01:29:32,698 --> 01:29:34,734
<i>Now, I'm being told
that a midnight deal</i>

1698
01:29:34,867 --> 01:29:37,402
<i>may have been brokered
with LeMarcus James.</i>

1699
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:40,306
<i>Details still remain
a little bit sketchy,</i>

1700
01:29:40,438 --> 01:29:43,576
<i>but there's a news conference
scheduled for a couple hours from now.</i>

1701
01:29:43,709 --> 01:29:45,778
<i>My sources tell me
that both teams</i>

1702
01:29:45,912 --> 01:29:47,412
<i>could be
at full strength tonight,</i>

1703
01:29:47,546 --> 01:29:49,715
<i>and that includes James.</i>

1704
01:29:49,849 --> 01:29:51,651
<i>You know what else
that means?</i>

1705
01:29:51,784 --> 01:29:54,486
<i>Strike up the band.
Fire up that old grill.</i>

1706
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:57,023
<i>We're gonna have some great
football action for you to...</i>

1707
01:29:57,156 --> 01:30:00,259
<i>The 13-1 Cougars
against the undefeated Wolves,</i>

1708
01:30:00,393 --> 01:30:01,928
<i>the two best players
in the country...</i>

1709
01:30:02,061 --> 01:30:04,630
<i>Or will it?
Even with the rumors</i>

1710
01:30:04,764 --> 01:30:06,766
<i>of a late-night deal
with LeMarcus James,</i>

1711
01:30:06,899 --> 01:30:10,236
<i>many oddsmakers still doubt
he will actually play tonight.</i>

1712
01:30:10,369 --> 01:30:13,039
<i>So the question is,
can James Lazor's Wolves</i>

1713
01:30:13,172 --> 01:30:15,041
<i>win without
their star quarterback?</i>

1714
01:30:15,174 --> 01:30:16,642
<i>I'm not so sure.</i>

1715
01:30:16,776 --> 01:30:20,379
Well, yeah.
He and LeMarcus have the same mother.

1716
01:30:20,512 --> 01:30:22,315
Yeah, they both grew up
in Virginia.

1717
01:30:22,447 --> 01:30:25,483
Reggie,
he played JUCO football,

1718
01:30:25,618 --> 01:30:27,320
but that fizzled out
after they cut him

1719
01:30:27,452 --> 01:30:29,454
for having
too many concussions.

1720
01:30:29,588 --> 01:30:31,456
I would start
with the state prisons.

1721
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:33,626
Even try
mental health facilities.

1722
01:30:33,759 --> 01:30:35,861
We need to do
a social media backdoor too.

1723
01:30:35,995 --> 01:30:37,797
I doubt that
he even has an account,

1724
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:40,166
- but we have got to find him.
- [knocking]

1725
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,169
He is our pressure point.

1726
01:30:43,302 --> 01:30:45,638
Oh. Coach.

1727
01:30:48,107 --> 01:30:49,675
I got your message.

1728
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:55,982
This thing
we're toying with,

1729
01:30:57,650 --> 01:30:59,952
it's Pandora's box,
you know?

1730
01:31:01,153 --> 01:31:02,321
I know.

1731
01:31:02,455 --> 01:31:03,990
Nobody gets hurt.

1732
01:31:05,224 --> 01:31:06,692
Nobody goes to jail.

1733
01:31:06,826 --> 01:31:09,829
- We just play this game.
- That's what we all want.

1734
01:31:17,803 --> 01:31:19,972
[coughing]

1735
01:31:20,106 --> 01:31:22,141
[Emmett] Dear Lord,

1736
01:31:22,274 --> 01:31:25,344
the trees are thick, and we've yet
to see a path through the wilderness.

1737
01:31:26,879 --> 01:31:28,647
Send us a light.

1738
01:31:28,781 --> 01:31:30,983
Show us the way.
Amen.

1739
01:31:31,117 --> 01:31:33,419
Amen. [coughing]

1740
01:31:36,188 --> 01:31:39,358
I can't believe you've been here
this whole time and didn't tell us.

1741
01:31:39,492 --> 01:31:42,094
What? You thought I was
gonna miss the show?

1742
01:31:42,228 --> 01:31:44,397
[LeMarcus chuckles quietly]

1743
01:31:44,529 --> 01:31:45,931
I'm sorry.

1744
01:31:46,065 --> 01:31:48,200
No, hey, you don't
owe me anything.

1745
01:31:48,334 --> 01:31:50,703
You're the one, the two of you,
who had the guts and vision...

1746
01:31:50,836 --> 01:31:53,039
I meant about her.

1747
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:56,208
Oh. [inhales sharply]

1748
01:31:56,342 --> 01:31:57,810
Yeah. Her.

1749
01:31:58,811 --> 01:32:00,012
Well...

1750
01:32:00,146 --> 01:32:01,247
[inhales sharply]

1751
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:03,482
I made my own bed
on that one, so...

1752
01:32:03,616 --> 01:32:05,918
"Thou shalt
not commit adultery"

1753
01:32:06,052 --> 01:32:07,653
is the seventh Commandment.

1754
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,392
Thank you
for clarifying that, Emmett.

1755
01:32:14,527 --> 01:32:16,195
You're welcome.

1756
01:32:16,328 --> 01:32:19,331
[LeMarcus] Look, Elliott,
we can't thank you enough, man.

1757
01:32:19,465 --> 01:32:22,168
Without you, we...
[sighs]

1758
01:32:22,301 --> 01:32:24,703
we wouldn't have even had
a shot to pull this off.

1759
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:28,240
What's going on here?

1760
01:32:29,775 --> 01:32:31,644
Are we about to hold hands

1761
01:32:31,777 --> 01:32:33,879
and feel good
about your little protest?

1762
01:32:34,013 --> 01:32:36,582
'Cause I thought you guys
were in it to win it.

1763
01:32:36,715 --> 01:32:38,584
You know,
as if it were, say,

1764
01:32:38,717 --> 01:32:41,153
the national title.

1765
01:32:46,725 --> 01:32:50,262
Let me give you a little something
I stumbled across from my travels.

1766
01:32:51,964 --> 01:32:54,467
I believe that's your coach's.

1767
01:32:55,634 --> 01:32:57,436
Wasn't even wrapped
in aluminum.

1768
01:32:57,571 --> 01:32:59,905
Amateur move.

1769
01:33:01,674 --> 01:33:04,477
Yeah, but what's the point of this?
We can't unlock it.

1770
01:33:05,878 --> 01:33:08,814
Do you need to?
You know what's on it.

1771
01:33:10,282 --> 01:33:13,553
And you're a quarterback.
You know how to bluff the other team.

1772
01:33:19,358 --> 01:33:20,893
So you're saying
we keep going?

1773
01:33:21,026 --> 01:33:22,495
[Elliott]
That's not my decision.

1774
01:33:22,628 --> 01:33:24,997
It's not even
about which one is right.

1775
01:33:26,899 --> 01:33:29,569
It's about, which one are you
gonna be able to live with,

1776
01:33:29,702 --> 01:33:31,770
no matter how it goes,

1777
01:33:31,904 --> 01:33:34,039
how much you suffer
the consequences.

1778
01:33:37,143 --> 01:33:40,813
I'm just letting you know
you still have some options.

1779
01:33:40,946 --> 01:33:44,450
- [coughing]
- It's off to Rome for me, comrades.

1780
01:33:44,584 --> 01:33:47,486
- Wait, you ain't staying for the game?
- Nah, opiate for the masses.

1781
01:33:47,621 --> 01:33:50,222
It's, like,
too much winning for my taste.

1782
01:33:53,526 --> 01:33:55,361
I'm so proud
of you guys.

1783
01:33:57,163 --> 01:33:58,831
You did this.

1784
01:33:58,964 --> 01:34:01,200
You alone.
And it was...

1785
01:34:03,603 --> 01:34:05,539
It was
fucking magnificent.

1786
01:34:08,908 --> 01:34:10,676
<i>Veni, vidi...</i>

1787
01:34:10,809 --> 01:34:12,178
- <i>Vici.</i>
- <i>Vici.</i>

1788
01:34:12,311 --> 01:34:14,113
- [door closes]
- [coughing]

1789
01:34:15,481 --> 01:34:16,715
[LeMarcus] Goddamn.

1790
01:34:16,849 --> 01:34:18,150
Well...

1791
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:21,954
we're about due
for our surrender.

1792
01:34:23,088 --> 01:34:24,823
What you thinkin'?

1793
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:27,193
I don't fucking know.

1794
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,663
My head is pounding.

1795
01:34:29,795 --> 01:34:32,231
Where's that doc?

1796
01:34:32,364 --> 01:34:35,234
Yeah, I'll go get him.
He said he'd wait in the lobby.

1797
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:37,736
[coughing]

1798
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:39,505
Damn, you sick.

1799
01:34:39,639 --> 01:34:42,708
See if I can get you another IV.
I'll be back in ten.

1800
01:34:47,413 --> 01:34:48,881
[door closes]

1801
01:35:53,812 --> 01:35:57,316
[Mike] As soon as he gets here,
we'll have the coach and him reunite,

1802
01:35:57,449 --> 01:36:01,153
uh, pleasantries, and then we'll
get right to inviting the media in.

1803
01:36:01,287 --> 01:36:03,789
I'll give them a few minutes.
They'll go off to play.

1804
01:36:03,922 --> 01:36:05,524
[knocking on door]

1805
01:36:05,659 --> 01:36:06,992
Here we go.

1806
01:36:09,562 --> 01:36:10,730
[Everly] Hey!

1807
01:36:10,863 --> 01:36:13,299
- LeMarcus has risen.
- There he is.

1808
01:36:13,432 --> 01:36:15,968
All right.
Great to see you.

1809
01:36:16,101 --> 01:36:18,103
Can I get you something?
Some water? A Snickers?

1810
01:36:18,237 --> 01:36:20,105
- [laughter]
- I'm good, thanks.

1811
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:22,676
[Mike] You were a little under the
weather, but you're better now.

1812
01:36:22,808 --> 01:36:24,443
Yeah.

1813
01:36:24,577 --> 01:36:26,746
- [Mike] That's good news.
- [Wes] Not for us.

1814
01:36:26,879 --> 01:36:28,180
[laughter]

1815
01:36:28,314 --> 01:36:30,149
[Everly] True.

1816
01:36:30,282 --> 01:36:32,251
[Mike] Um,
I just wanted to, uh,

1817
01:36:32,384 --> 01:36:34,520
get us to have
a little face-to-face

1818
01:36:34,654 --> 01:36:36,322
before we bring
the cameras in here.

1819
01:36:36,455 --> 01:36:38,290
I was just telling
the coach here

1820
01:36:38,424 --> 01:36:40,794
how impressed I was
with, uh, your conduct.

1821
01:36:40,926 --> 01:36:42,161
Very honorable.

1822
01:36:43,262 --> 01:36:44,631
[Coach Lazor] LeMarcus.

1823
01:36:44,764 --> 01:36:46,533
The team is back.

1824
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,401
They heard
about this deal, and...

1825
01:36:50,369 --> 01:36:51,904
everybody else
is playin' this.

1826
01:36:52,037 --> 01:36:53,505
It's just you
and Emmett now.

1827
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:57,242
These gentlemen are
giving you a committee,

1828
01:36:57,376 --> 01:37:00,346
and they are gonna address
all of your grievances.

1829
01:37:01,648 --> 01:37:02,981
So,

1830
01:37:03,849 --> 01:37:06,218
time to put on
those pads,

1831
01:37:06,352 --> 01:37:08,153
join your brothers,
and do battle.

1832
01:37:09,188 --> 01:37:10,724
Everybody's countin'
on you.

1833
01:37:12,458 --> 01:37:14,393
I'm countin' on you.

1834
01:37:17,831 --> 01:37:19,699
You know, I assure you,
LeMarcus,

1835
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:21,634
this isn't
a ceremonial committee.

1836
01:37:21,768 --> 01:37:23,869
We're gonna dig down
into these issues

1837
01:37:24,002 --> 01:37:26,905
and figure out
what's best for all of us.

1838
01:37:29,776 --> 01:37:31,377
All right?

1839
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:33,580
Like the coach said,
we have a game to play.

1840
01:37:33,713 --> 01:37:35,715
- Let's get the cameras in...
- I didn't say yes.

1841
01:37:37,049 --> 01:37:38,752
[Everly]
What's that?

1842
01:37:39,686 --> 01:37:41,019
I didn't say yes.

1843
01:37:43,355 --> 01:37:45,190
[sighs]

1844
01:37:47,694 --> 01:37:49,596
What would it take
in your mind

1845
01:37:50,496 --> 01:37:52,431
to get to yes?

1846
01:37:54,601 --> 01:37:56,736
Well, our demands
haven't changed.

1847
01:38:01,273 --> 01:38:03,242
[chuckles]

1848
01:38:32,237 --> 01:38:34,139
[Katherine] That's
the sealed case file

1849
01:38:34,273 --> 01:38:36,576
from that fateful night
at the Gin Mill.

1850
01:38:39,344 --> 01:38:43,115
The detectives investigated
for two weeks, and then...

1851
01:38:43,248 --> 01:38:44,684
[sighs]

1852
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:49,288
...suddenly, K.C. Walton
decided to drop the charges.

1853
01:38:55,628 --> 01:38:58,530
A lot of movin' pieces
in there, LeMarcus.

1854
01:38:59,498 --> 01:39:01,333
This thing is a minefield.

1855
01:39:03,135 --> 01:39:05,437
- You find my brother yet?
- [Katherine] Getting close.

1856
01:39:05,572 --> 01:39:09,676
I'd really love to stop the
search and just have a beer,

1857
01:39:10,810 --> 01:39:12,545
watch a football game.

1858
01:39:16,148 --> 01:39:18,283
Well, why don't
we tell 'em, Coach?

1859
01:39:19,619 --> 01:39:21,153
We're a wolf pack, right?

1860
01:39:23,121 --> 01:39:25,023
We hunt together,
we starve alone.

1861
01:39:25,157 --> 01:39:26,926
Ain't that the creed
you always preach?

1862
01:39:27,059 --> 01:39:30,496
Why don't we tell everybody
how high up this really goes?

1863
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:32,532
Stop. Just stop.

1864
01:39:32,665 --> 01:39:35,602
Look, you come out
of this now,

1865
01:39:35,735 --> 01:39:37,971
you're not just
a Heisman Trophy winner,

1866
01:39:38,103 --> 01:39:40,038
NFL first-rounder.

1867
01:39:41,608 --> 01:39:44,844
You're an icon now.
You've already accomplished that.

1868
01:39:44,978 --> 01:39:47,981
You're the Curt Flood
of collegiate athletics.

1869
01:39:49,147 --> 01:39:51,316
You're making
history here already.

1870
01:39:51,450 --> 01:39:53,151
They're gonna write books
about you.

1871
01:39:53,285 --> 01:39:55,588
Now, don't throw
everything away for-for

1872
01:39:55,722 --> 01:39:58,223
whatever this
self-righteous bullshit is.

1873
01:39:58,357 --> 01:39:59,993
Come on, man.
You've worked too hard.

1874
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:01,360
[grunts softly]

1875
01:40:01,493 --> 01:40:03,830
We've worked too hard
for this.

1876
01:40:04,864 --> 01:40:07,032
Let's just go
fuckin' win this thing.

1877
01:40:08,701 --> 01:40:10,168
[scoffs]

1878
01:40:10,302 --> 01:40:11,336
Win.

1879
01:40:13,205 --> 01:40:15,440
That's all that
really matters, right?

1880
01:40:17,175 --> 01:40:18,645
Just win.

1881
01:40:20,212 --> 01:40:22,147
So that's what I did.

1882
01:40:22,281 --> 01:40:24,551
I won every damn game I could.

1883
01:40:25,985 --> 01:40:27,820
Conference championships,

1884
01:40:27,954 --> 01:40:30,522
Heisman Trophy...
I won and I won and I won.

1885
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:35,060
Until you were so blind, you didn't
even see the game I was really playin'.

1886
01:40:35,193 --> 01:40:37,496
You see,
in order to slay Goliath,

1887
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:40,432
you gotta do it on the biggest
stage with the brightest lights.

1888
01:40:40,567 --> 01:40:43,002
Millions of people,
an entire system,

1889
01:40:43,135 --> 01:40:45,939
so desperate
for one more win,

1890
01:40:46,071 --> 01:40:47,707
they'd do anything,
give anything.

1891
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,543
No matter how many bodies
you gotta stand on top of.

1892
01:40:51,678 --> 01:40:53,947
And then you got
your professor

1893
01:40:54,079 --> 01:40:55,782
who's fuckin'
the coach's wife...

1894
01:40:58,051 --> 01:40:59,786
to give you
everything you need.

1895
01:41:01,888 --> 01:41:03,656
And you win.

1896
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:05,992
- You motherfucker!
- [excited chattering]

1897
01:41:06,124 --> 01:41:08,761
- You ungrateful bi...
- Coach, don't do it.

1898
01:41:08,895 --> 01:41:11,731
Goddamn you,
you fucking ungrateful...

1899
01:41:12,932 --> 01:41:15,902
Jesus fucking Christ,
LeMarcus.

1900
01:41:16,035 --> 01:41:18,972
My wife! My wife!

1901
01:41:22,675 --> 01:41:24,443
[quietly]
Oh, my God.

1902
01:41:29,849 --> 01:41:33,285
Jesus Christ, man.
Everything we've been through together...

1903
01:41:35,454 --> 01:41:37,590
everything
I've done for you...

1904
01:41:40,258 --> 01:41:43,228
You were a pimply faced
little 16-year-old boy,

1905
01:41:44,597 --> 01:41:46,633
scared to leave home.

1906
01:41:48,801 --> 01:41:51,169
And I looked your mother
in the eyes,

1907
01:41:51,303 --> 01:41:54,373
and I said,
"I will take care of your boy."

1908
01:41:54,506 --> 01:41:56,676
And that's
what I've done.

1909
01:41:59,846 --> 01:42:01,648
Treated you like my own.

1910
01:42:03,281 --> 01:42:05,118
Like my own son.

1911
01:42:10,522 --> 01:42:12,157
How could you...

1912
01:42:12,290 --> 01:42:13,793
[sighs]

1913
01:42:13,926 --> 01:42:15,795
Goddamn, LeMarcus.

1914
01:42:15,928 --> 01:42:17,964
[breathes shakily] Why?

1915
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:24,637
For all the ones
to come, Coach.

1916
01:42:25,972 --> 01:42:27,874
The ones
who ain't as fortunate.

1917
01:42:29,642 --> 01:42:31,711
Get this broken system
unbroken.

1918
01:42:34,013 --> 01:42:35,948
So no more of us
get banged up

1919
01:42:36,082 --> 01:42:38,216
and forced back
into poverty,

1920
01:42:39,585 --> 01:42:41,621
just like what happened
to Reggie.

1921
01:42:44,489 --> 01:42:48,161
You were the only one
who knew about that file.

1922
01:42:48,293 --> 01:42:51,496
And you stoop even lower,
and you bring Reggie into this?

1923
01:42:53,032 --> 01:42:54,934
What, to you he's just...

1924
01:42:55,068 --> 01:42:57,670
he's just some pawn
that you can use against me?

1925
01:43:00,039 --> 01:43:01,674
He was my brother.

1926
01:43:04,509 --> 01:43:06,211
He was a human being.

1927
01:43:09,582 --> 01:43:12,952
Reggie died four months ago
in Tallahassee.

1928
01:43:15,054 --> 01:43:16,388
He took his own life.

1929
01:43:16,521 --> 01:43:19,291
[quietly] Oh, Jesus. Fuck.

1930
01:43:19,424 --> 01:43:22,260
Y'all didn't know.
And what's worse, y'all don't even care.

1931
01:43:24,362 --> 01:43:26,199
There's always
some new batch of kids

1932
01:43:26,331 --> 01:43:29,068
that get you more wins
and get you more money.

1933
01:43:33,039 --> 01:43:34,372
I am not your son.

1934
01:43:35,842 --> 01:43:37,176
I'm a man.

1935
01:43:39,579 --> 01:43:41,080
[sniffles]

1936
01:43:43,015 --> 01:43:44,449
Yeah, you are.

1937
01:43:49,589 --> 01:43:51,190
And I love you.

1938
01:43:56,129 --> 01:43:58,164
But I got
a football game to win.

1939
01:44:02,467 --> 01:44:04,103
[door opens]

1940
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:06,906
[door closes]

1941
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:14,446
[Mike clears throat]
Gentlemen, um,

1942
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:16,281
would you step out
for a minute?

1943
01:44:17,415 --> 01:44:18,918
Give us some time?

1944
01:44:20,285 --> 01:44:21,621
[sniffles]

1945
01:44:39,404 --> 01:44:42,942
You open up that minefield, it's
gonna be more than just me and Reggie.

1946
01:44:44,210 --> 01:44:45,812
On Coach's phone,
we got emails

1947
01:44:45,945 --> 01:44:48,080
from prosecutors,
law enforcement.

1948
01:44:48,214 --> 01:44:50,750
All of 'em were involved
in the cover-up.

1949
01:44:50,883 --> 01:44:53,119
Shoot, even the governor

1950
01:44:53,252 --> 01:44:55,655
chest bumps in the
locker room on game day.

1951
01:44:57,455 --> 01:45:00,893
Coach's phone, you'll find a text
where he promises to take care of it.

1952
01:45:05,665 --> 01:45:07,033
The martyr.

1953
01:45:08,366 --> 01:45:10,870
Willing to die
for the cause.

1954
01:45:11,003 --> 01:45:13,706
I find that courageous.
Admirable.

1955
01:45:15,107 --> 01:45:17,710
But what about Emmett Sunday?

1956
01:45:18,845 --> 01:45:21,047
You said you were
doing this for him.

1957
01:45:22,782 --> 01:45:24,183
Miss Poe?

1958
01:45:36,195 --> 01:45:37,563
[Katherine clears throat]

1959
01:45:37,697 --> 01:45:40,967
"It was chaos.
People everywhere.

1960
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:44,036
Then all of a sudden,
LeMarcus James, the quarterback,

1961
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:47,006
showed up
with someone else.

1962
01:45:48,541 --> 01:45:52,178
[clears throat] A big guy.
It was really dangerous.

1963
01:45:52,311 --> 01:45:54,213
Then the big white guy

1964
01:45:55,615 --> 01:45:58,084
flew through the crowd
and hit one guy

1965
01:45:58,217 --> 01:46:01,386
who dropped like he was dead and
threw another guy into a wall.

1966
01:46:01,519 --> 01:46:04,690
LeMarcus grabbed the man
the crew were beating on,

1967
01:46:04,824 --> 01:46:06,458
and everyone ran.

1968
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:10,263
- Like I said, it was chaos."
- That was self-defense.

1969
01:46:11,364 --> 01:46:13,431
[Mike]
Maybe so. Maybe so.

1970
01:46:14,432 --> 01:46:15,735
But does it matter?

1971
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:19,739
We go down this road,

1972
01:46:19,872 --> 01:46:21,941
they won't be putting you
on trial,

1973
01:46:22,074 --> 01:46:24,744
they'll be putting
your best friend, Emmett.

1974
01:46:25,878 --> 01:46:29,248
Now, do you have the stomach
to watch the sharks

1975
01:46:29,382 --> 01:46:31,516
rip him apart limb by limb

1976
01:46:31,651 --> 01:46:35,054
in front of the whole world
and leave him destroyed,

1977
01:46:35,187 --> 01:46:36,355
canceled?

1978
01:46:38,423 --> 01:46:40,458
LeMarcus, you're standing
toe-to-toe with the behemoth,

1979
01:46:40,593 --> 01:46:42,595
and we haven't even
begun to fight.

1980
01:46:44,563 --> 01:46:46,799
College football is more
important than you,

1981
01:46:46,933 --> 01:46:48,901
me, Emmett,

1982
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:51,070
or whatever really is
on that phone.

1983
01:46:52,705 --> 01:46:54,707
The American people

1984
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:57,143
will let the state of
Missouri fall under the sea

1985
01:46:57,276 --> 01:46:58,878
rather than give up
Saturday afternoon,

1986
01:46:59,011 --> 01:47:00,713
drunk and roaring
for their alma mater.

1987
01:47:02,982 --> 01:47:04,984
We're inevitable
as the rain.

1988
01:47:12,457 --> 01:47:14,694
Now, you gonna put
on that helmet or not?

1989
01:47:23,302 --> 01:47:25,871
[crowd cheering]

1990
01:47:29,308 --> 01:47:32,578
[sportscaster on TV] <i>...gearing up for
the college football national title game.</i>

1991
01:47:32,712 --> 01:47:34,413
<i>The fans are buzzing
with excitement...</i>

1992
01:47:34,547 --> 01:47:37,183
[Emmett] "Inevitable"?
Like what?

1993
01:47:38,584 --> 01:47:39,919
The rain.

1994
01:47:41,754 --> 01:47:44,123
"I'm inevitable
as the rain."

1995
01:47:46,392 --> 01:47:48,661
- Feels powerful.
- Mm-hmm.

1996
01:47:48,794 --> 01:47:50,429
It was.

1997
01:47:54,834 --> 01:47:56,202
[bones popping]

1998
01:47:56,335 --> 01:47:58,104
[sighs]

1999
01:47:58,237 --> 01:48:01,173
Gonna have to drain the fluid
out of this damn thing again.

2000
01:48:04,944 --> 01:48:07,413
You look better. Lighter.

2001
01:48:07,546 --> 01:48:09,482
Finally breathe
through my nose.

2002
01:48:10,649 --> 01:48:13,853
By the way,
that Doc Holliday head fake,

2003
01:48:13,986 --> 01:48:16,689
you playing like you were on your
deathbed, was sure good.

2004
01:48:17,623 --> 01:48:19,492
[scoffs]

2005
01:48:19,625 --> 01:48:23,095
Lacked the nuance of Kilmer,
but, uh, I bought it.

2006
01:48:24,063 --> 01:48:25,698
I'll be your Huckleberry.

2007
01:48:25,831 --> 01:48:28,267
[both chuckle]

2008
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:36,876
You sure they didn't try
to use me against you?

2009
01:48:37,009 --> 01:48:38,210
Nah.

2010
01:48:39,645 --> 01:48:41,313
I swear.

2011
01:48:41,447 --> 01:48:43,549
'Cause if I find out
that you were...

2012
01:48:43,682 --> 01:48:45,251
Trust me.

2013
01:48:45,384 --> 01:48:48,187
They know this fight hurts them
way more than it hurts us.

2014
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:52,091
All those people involved in the
cover-up, they ain't doin' shit.

2015
01:48:52,224 --> 01:48:55,394
[Levy] <i>The Superdome in New Orleans
is ready to explode with excitement.</i>

2016
01:48:55,528 --> 01:48:58,330
<i>Tonight, it's the Snickers
National Title game.</i>

2017
01:48:58,464 --> 01:49:00,199
<i>Hi, everybody,
and good evening.</i>

2018
01:49:00,332 --> 01:49:02,268
<i>I'm Steve Levy,
along with Malcolm Jenkins,</i>

2019
01:49:02,401 --> 01:49:03,869
<i>and this one has
all the makings.</i>

2020
01:49:04,003 --> 01:49:05,571
- <i>This could be a classic.</i>
- No.

2021
01:49:05,704 --> 01:49:07,106
[Levy] <i>We're talking about
for years to come...</i>

2022
01:49:07,239 --> 01:49:09,475
- Leave it.
- <i>...for a variety of reasons.</i>

2023
01:49:09,608 --> 01:49:11,410
<i>A lot of the controversy
still looms</i>

2024
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:13,612
<i>with LeMarcus James bein'
missin' from the action,</i>

2025
01:49:13,746 --> 01:49:16,382
<i>as he continues his fight
against the NCAA practices,</i>

2026
01:49:16,515 --> 01:49:18,784
- <i>a stance that has gone crazy on social media...</i>
- <i>Whoo. Yes, sir.</i>

2027
01:49:18,918 --> 01:49:20,653
<i>...with the viral hashtag,
"Fix the System."</i>

2028
01:49:20,786 --> 01:49:22,822
[Levy] <i>How about
one million tweets</i>

2029
01:49:22,955 --> 01:49:24,990
<i>the last 12 hours alone?</i>

2030
01:49:25,124 --> 01:49:27,460
<i>My sense is,
this is only the beginning.</i>

2031
01:49:27,593 --> 01:49:31,163
<i>How do you think that translates onto the
field the next 60 minutes we'll see tonight?</i>

2032
01:49:31,297 --> 01:49:33,499
[Jenkins] <i>I think you'll see these
coaches have these teams prepared.</i>

2033
01:49:33,632 --> 01:49:35,434
<i>These players have worked
so hard to get to this moment,</i>

2034
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:37,103
<i>that I think
they'll be focused...</i>

2035
01:49:37,236 --> 01:49:38,804
At least we made
some noise, right?

2036
01:49:38,938 --> 01:49:40,806
<i>...knowing that
this is everything...</i>

2037
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:42,775
Oh, that wasn't just noise.

2038
01:49:44,176 --> 01:49:46,278
The truth is out now
because of us.

2039
01:49:47,446 --> 01:49:48,981
And they can't hide it.

2040
01:49:50,349 --> 01:49:52,952
Now more people are gonna
stand up, a lot more.

2041
01:49:54,053 --> 01:49:56,556
And they'll know
right where to hit 'em.

2042
01:49:57,623 --> 01:49:58,791
Yeah.

2043
01:50:00,693 --> 01:50:01,794
Yeah.

2044
01:50:02,628 --> 01:50:03,963
Hell, yeah.

2045
01:50:04,096 --> 01:50:06,765
Man, we're like the Rebels
in <i>Rogue One.</i>

2046
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:11,937
We die on the beach,

2047
01:50:12,071 --> 01:50:15,174
but the plans for the Death
Star make it off the island.

2048
01:50:23,249 --> 01:50:25,518
