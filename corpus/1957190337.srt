Mr. Donner.

187
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:44,747
That's quite a development.

188
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,141
-Ah, thank you very much.
-Mm-hmm.

189
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:48,620
[phone ringing]

190
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:50,535
WOMAN:
Krupp, Harrison & Dean.

191
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,451
He's not in the
office today.

192
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:55,715
[indistinct conversations]

193
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,588
[sighs]

194
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:02,156
Mr. Donner, thank you
for pushing the meeting.

195
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:04,027
I'm sorry.
Something at home.

196
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:05,637
Nothing too
serious, I hope.

197
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,770
No, no. Nothing
serious at all.

198
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:08,902
Uh, while we
were waiting,

199
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:11,121
your lovely assistant
was explaining

200
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,558
this video
phone to me.

201
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:15,386
Oh, yeah, that-that's
pretty cool, isn't it?

202
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,779
Mm-hmm.

203
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,041
My wife and I can
see each other

204
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:20,043
and sign over the phone.

205
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,784
Uh, she's deaf, and my son
is deaf, too, so, uh...

206
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,265
-Mm.
-Have a seat. Have a seat.

207
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,440
Thanks.

208
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:28,965
So, what did you think
of our proposal?

209
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:32,447
Impressive,
but I should warn you,

210
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,927
our company is set in its ways.

211
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,191
Well, I don't want
to change anything, but...

212
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:38,453
You know, to me,

213
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:40,890
public relations is
about perception.

214
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,152
My job is to recognize

215
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,676
what it is about you
that makes you unique.

216
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,201
You know, special.

217
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:14,489
[children laughing]

218
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,065
MAN: What-What this
time, McBain?

219
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,718
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

220
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:29,025
Can I borrow Mr. Williams
for a moment?

221
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:29,809
Oh, sure, absolutely.

222
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,420
I want you to meet
my husband, Ray.

223
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:35,858
Ray, this is
Laura's father Max.

224
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:37,860
I read your book
on deaf culture.

225
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:38,426
It's very good.

226
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:41,255
I learned a lot.

227
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:42,082
Ah, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

228
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,301
[Jennifer chuckles]

229
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:48,523
Laura, you must be very
proud of your father.

230
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:51,700
Oh... ho, ho.

231
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,572
He means the world to me.

232
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:57,184
I'm proud of you, too.

233
00:13:57,227 --> 00:13:59,621
Is your mom here?

234
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:02,493
[children laughing]

235
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,323
-Oh.
-[laughs]

236
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,717
-Told you, honey.
-He's having a ball.

237
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,762
DAN:
Ah, there goes... Okay.

238
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:12,199
Yeah. Oh, oh.
Oh, I... Let me get the...

239
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:14,505
My parents are here.

240
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:15,767
Let me get them over.

241
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,160
-Mom! Dad! Oh, you made it.
-Hi.

242
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:19,249
-Oh, good to see you.
-How you doin', big fella?

243
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:20,381
Yes, you, too, honey.

244
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:21,730
-Thank you for coming.
-How are you?

245
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:23,863
-Oh, how was your flight?
-The movie was good.

246
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:24,559
FATHER:
The pretzels were bad.

247
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:26,169
Yeah. Ah, well.

248
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:27,518
Hey, here's the birthday boy!

249
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:28,911
Oh, my darling.

250
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:30,391
-How are you, sweetheart?
-How you doing, Adam?

251
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:31,783
-How are you, big boy?
-Happy birthday.

252
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:32,915
Hey, you look great.

253
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,047
Where should I put that...?

254
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,483
-Oh, another present.
-Ah, you know.

255
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:36,484
Oh, my goodness!
Mount Vesuvius erupts.

256
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:38,268
-Yes...
-Hey, come on over.

257
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:40,880
You remember the, uh, Scotts,
live across the street?

258
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,316
Yes, of course.
How are you? Hi.

259
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,708
-My parents.
-Nice to see you.

260
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:45,275
Good to see you again.
I'm Priscilla. Priscilla.

261
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,103
-I'll get you guys some drinks.
-Priscilla? You?

262
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:49,323
EVERYONE:
♪ Happy birthday to you

263
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:54,676
♪ Happy birthday
to you ♪

264
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:59,811
♪ Happy birthday, dear Adam

265
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:05,121
♪ Happy birthday to you.

266
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:08,081
[no audio]

267
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:21,181
DAN:
Oh. Wait.

268
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,444
You have to make a wish.

269
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:26,012
"Tell me. Tell me."
Well, for what?

270
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:29,972
What do I wish for?

271
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,756
[laughter]

272
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,976
DAN [echoing]: <i>
...wish for?</i>

273
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,022
[laughter echoing]

274
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,689
Great party.

275
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,256
Don't you think?

276
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,258
Adam had such a good time.

277
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:58,174
The cut on his knee
didn't bother him a bit.

278
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:01,873
Yeah. Chasing that balloon--
that's all he was doing.

279
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,745
Oh, he's all right.

280
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:05,747
Yeah, well...

281
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,750
what if, next time,
he's chasing the balloon,

282
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:10,534
and it leads him out
into traffic?

283
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:12,362
Deaf kids don't walk
into traffic.

284
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:15,322
You never see on the news,

285
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:17,541
"Deaf child wanders aimlessly
into traffic."

286
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,239
It doesn't happen.

287
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:24,113
What if we were given the chance

288
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:26,333
to change the direction
of his life?

289
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:29,684
The ER doctor suggested

290
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:31,425
that-that
we can actually choose.

291
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:33,427
Choose what?

292
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,647
Whether Adam should have a...

293
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:38,867
cochlear implant.

294
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,785
[sighs]

295
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,398
The doctor said
that Adam is a good candidate.

296
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,879
The younger he is,

297
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,924
the more effective
the implant will be.

298
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:55,318
He may still remember
what things sound like.

299
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:58,060
[sighs]

300
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,410
I can't believe you'd even...

301
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:01,759
No, I-I...

302
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,326
I told the doctor no.

303
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,807
Good.

304
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,473
Then I checked the Internet.

305
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:24,173
Implants now have
16-channel sound.

306
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:27,785
I mean, they're powered
by a computer microchip.

307
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,439
Wait. Are you actually
considering this?

308
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,355
There's this doctor-- Dr. Flynt.

309
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:35,054
Let's at least go see him.

310
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,446
I mean, how can we, um,

311
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,710
make an intelligent decision

312
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,625
if we don't have all the facts?

313
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,540
But we know all this already.

314
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:44,759
You and I talked.

315
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,717
We always agreed.

316
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:48,197
Why are you suddenly...?

317
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,242
Because what if,

318
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:52,114
what if our boy
could hear again?

319
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,550
Adam's happy the way he is.

320
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:56,249
I know, but...

321
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,382
And you and I have always
told Adam to love who he is.

322
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,818
Now you want to tell him

323
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,429
something's wrong
with him? Why?

324
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:05,301
To maybe give him back
one of the basic human senses

325
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:07,477
that nature wants
all of us to have.

326
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,566
But that is what nature wants.

327
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,612
Nature did it!

328
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:13,179
Being deaf

329
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:17,444
is as natural to Adam and me
as being hearing is to you.

330
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,752
[sighs]

331
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:26,322
Let's go meet this doctor, okay?

332
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:29,195
Next week.

333
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:29,630
Friday.

334
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:31,545
Friday?

335
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:33,851
Yeah. At 3:45.

336
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:37,028
You made an appointment
without even asking me?

337
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:38,291
These doctors are so busy.

338
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:40,684
I mean, you...
you have to grab them

339
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:43,078
when you...

340
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:48,692
What?

341
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:50,694
You're scaring me.

342
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:54,045
Don't be scared.

343
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:57,527
You've already
made up your mind.

344
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,486
No.

345
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:02,271
I'm keeping my mind open.

346
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:06,797
Can you?

347
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:17,199
So, Ms. Kramer, why don't you

348
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,505
tell the court a little
about Pinewood?

349
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:20,420
Well, Pinewood has been
there for 70 years.

350
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,249
We are the only deaf
elementary school in the county.

351
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:26,121
Please tell the
court, Ms. Kramer,

352
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,470
do any of the children
at your school

353
00:19:27,514 --> 00:19:28,558
have a cochlear implant?

354
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,865
No.

355
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:33,607
The policy at our school
is that all our kids sign.

356
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,523
And when you see a child

357
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:37,567
with an implant, how do you

358
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,613
personally feel?

359
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:42,746
My heart breaks.

360
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,226
And why is that?

361
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,882
Well, 100 years ago,
we would take deaf people

362
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:50,189
and slice out the bottom
of their tongues

363
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,321
to <i>loosen</i> their tongues.

364
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:53,104
We thought that

365
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:55,411
it would make them
speak like us.

366
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:56,891
Today,

367
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:58,327

in their skulls.

368
00:19:58,371 --> 00:19:59,894
Objection.
Unwarranted comparison,

369
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:01,678
Your Honor, and irrelevant
to these proceedings.

370
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:03,593
I agree.

371
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:04,681

372
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:06,727
Could you maybe
clarify your point

373
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,902
for the court, Ms. Kramer?

374
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:09,773
What I'm trying to say is,

375
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:12,515
I am around deaf kids
and their families

376
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,387
every day at our school.

377
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,431
We don't look at deafness

378
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:19,000
as a handicap
that needs to be corrected.

379
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:21,655
Why do we feel this need
to make them speak like us?

380
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:26,877
They speak with their hands.

381
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:29,228
You're a deaf mother,
Mrs. Parks?

382
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,838
Yes, I have a daughter.

383
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:32,187
She's seven.

384
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,233
Wait a minute.
You're deaf.

385
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,974
I notice you're not
utilizing the services

386
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:38,889
of the sign language
interpreter.

387
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,326
I don't need one.

388
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:43,416
I can hear everything
you're saying.

389
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,461
But how is that possible?

390
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:46,680
I have a cochlear implant.

391
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:58,953
Wow.
And, uh, is your daughter deaf?

392
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:01,912
Yes. We got her implant
two years ago.

393
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:05,307
As a deaf parent,
was that a hard decision

394
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:06,221
for you to make?

395
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:08,310
MRS. PARKS:
We're still a deaf family.

396
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:11,313
We have a lot
of deaf friends.

397
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:13,663
We did get some pressure
not to do it,

398
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:14,751
but then I got mine,

399
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:18,755
and there was no
question in my mind.

400
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,018
And you feel
that giving your child

401
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:24,195
an implant has improved
the quality of her life?

402
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:27,155
MRS. PARKS:
She hears music, cars...

403
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:30,201
She can talk to anybody
anytime.

404
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:34,075
She won't ever feel left out
of anything anymore.

405
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:36,643
It's a miracle.

406
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,436
Let me remind both parties.

407
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,047
The purpose of
these proceedings is not

408
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:52,180
for the court to decide
whether the minor

409
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:53,703
should receive an implant.

What did he say?

545
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:32,221
Nothing.

546
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:33,701
He just stared at me,

547
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,398
like I was a raving lunatic.

548
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:36,835
[laughs]

549
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:39,141
You should've seen me
trying to order this latte.

550
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:43,624
I said, "Yes, whipped cream."

551
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:46,061
Whip... cream!

552
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:48,194
[laughs]

553
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:51,110
Oh...

554
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:56,593
Mom, have you ever had
to stand up against Daddy?

555
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:59,770
Tell him he's wrong?

556
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:02,077
There were a few times
in our marriage

557
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:03,252
when I wish I had.

558
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:06,647
When?

559
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:13,045
Oh... those are nice.

560
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:17,658
That watch would look good
on your father, don't you think?

561
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:27,842
Easy. Slow it down.

562
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,236
Am I throwing too hard?

563
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:34,849
Sorry.

564
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:40,072
You know what Grandpa said
about hand signals is true.

565
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:42,117
And when a player

566
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:47,470
strikes out, the umpire
also yells, real loud,

567
00:31:47,514 --> 00:31:50,082
"You're out!"

568
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:55,565
Good, but just, just...
try it...

569
00:31:55,609 --> 00:32:00,309
Use your voice,
just big and loud.

570
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:02,050
Just... You're out!

571
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:05,314
[no audio]

572
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:08,709
It's okay. Um...

573
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:11,494
Just use your voice.

574
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:13,496
You're out!

575
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,759
[no audio]

576
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:19,198
[chuckles]

577
00:32:28,642 --> 00:32:31,645
There was a deaf pitcher
for the New York Giants,

578
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:33,995
pitched eight years,

579
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:37,129
including the World Series...

580
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,706
And reminder:

581
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,536
staff meeting tomorrow
is moved to 11:00.

582
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,104
Are you okay?

583
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:57,453
I'm fine.

584
00:32:57,497 --> 00:32:59,325
Anything you want to talk about?

585
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:01,153
-Well...
-[door opens]

586
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:07,463
Hold on a sec, 'kay?

587
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:09,335
Hey, stop that!

588
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:13,034
We're having dinner soon.

589
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:14,166
Go wash up.

590
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:16,559
Dinner!

591
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:18,561
My pot roast is ready.

592
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:20,999
Oh, bye.

593
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:27,222
This competition thing
with your father--

594
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,658
it's gone too far.

595
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:30,356
[stamps foot]

596
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:34,229
Competition thing?

597
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:36,188
Your father, look...

598
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:39,234
I respect what he's done
with his life,

599
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:44,326
but from the beginning,
he has never accepted me.

600
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:48,200
No, he's accepted you.

601
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:49,940
No, no, no. He...

602
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:52,117
he tolerates me, barely.

603
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,382
His daughter marrying
a hearing man...

604
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:57,470
[sighs]

605
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:02,562
Deaf pride, that's one thing,

606
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:05,391
deaf prejudice, that's another.

607
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:06,348
Not true.

608
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:08,959
You're wrong.

609
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:14,922
Well, don't underestimate
prejudice.

610
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:18,491
[sighs]

611
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,149
FEMALE ATTORNEY: So ASL is just
a kind of English, right?

612
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:28,066
Uh, American Sign Language
is not English.

613
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:31,547
No? Isn't sign language just
making English with your hands?

614
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:34,115
No, it is its own

615
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,987
official language
unto itself.

616
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:39,294
The average hearing person
has no idea

617
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:42,341
how complex
sign language can be.

618
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:47,085
Dr. Cannon, as a professor
with a PhD in linguistics,

619
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:51,437
would you agree that
language creates culture?

620
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,614
CANNON: It's a standard we use
to define any culture

621
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:56,006
around the world.

622
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,748
ATTORNEY: So, since ASL is
an official language,

623
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:01,229
does that mean that
deafness is a culture?

624
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:05,103
Their language <i>
is</i> their culture;

625
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:08,149
their sense of self as a people,

626
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:12,806
their history, traditions,
dignity, power--

627
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,199
all of it.

628
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:19,291
It's all carried forward
and lives in their hands.

629
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:22,424
Dr. Harvey, what does
the future hold for Adam

630
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:25,862
as a deaf child?

631
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:26,907
Well, the, uh,

632
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,735
according to the data available,

633
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:30,389
the average deaf person
in this country

634
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:34,175
leaves high school reading at
the level of a fourth-grader.

635
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:35,785
Objection.
Is counsel suggesting

636
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:36,873
that deaf people
can't read?

637
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:38,310
That's absurd.

638
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:40,181
The average hearing American
graduates high school

639
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:41,965
reading at the level
of a fifth-grader.

640
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:43,358
Your Honor, the data reflects
the national average.

641
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,230
Miss Tate will have her
opportunity to challenge

642
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:47,841
these findings on
cross-examination.

643
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:49,669
Take a seat, Mrs. Tate.

644
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,236
Wait your turn.

645
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:54,587
What if Adam wants to go to
college, get a degree?

646
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,111
He would need a sign language
interpreter with him

647
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,287
all the time in the classroom.

648
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:03,683
And if Adam somehow manages
to get a deaf education,

649
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:06,164
what kind of livelihood
can he expect?

650
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:09,471
The average deaf adult
earns far below

651
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:10,733
the national standard.

652
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:13,171
A large percentage
of deaf adults

653
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:15,477
receive government subsidies,

654
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:18,219
um, disability insurance.

655
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:20,047
Wait a minute.

656
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,223
How is it that a deaf person
can accept a disability

657
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:25,922
insurance check
with one hand,

658
00:36:25,966 --> 00:36:27,576
and yet claim they're
not disabled

659
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,056
but a culture
with the other?

660
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,580
Objection! Misleading and
grossly prejudicial.

661
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:32,625
Sustained.

662
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:33,843
I withdraw it.

663
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:36,324
Dr. Harvey, as a professor
of sociology,

664
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:40,937
would you agree that when Adam
Miller's hearing disappeared

665
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:42,243
at age four,

666
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:44,114
so did many of
his life's options

667
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:46,073
and opportunities?

668
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:49,772
In my opinion, that would be
a true statement-- yes.

669
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:52,079
GRISHAM:
Thank you.

670
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,956
Hey, what's going on?

671
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,177
I thought maybe I
could work from home,

672
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,831
you know, in the
afternoons, for a while.

673
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:08,313
I... I told the office
that I'd be working, uh,

674
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:10,315
you know, half days.

675
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:12,317
Why?

676
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,711
You know, to have time with you

677
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:19,846
and with Adam.

678
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:24,894
Adam developed deafness,
not cancer.

679
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:30,639
[children laughing]

680
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:33,468
LAURA: He's making
appointments,

681
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:36,645
making decisions, without
even asking me.

682
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,430
That's so not like us.

683
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:41,911
Ray will do the same
thing sometime.

684
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:45,001
Men, they don't think
it matters.

685
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:47,526
Dan and I always talk.

686
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:49,528
About everything.

687
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:50,659
Together.

688
00:37:50,703 --> 00:37:52,618
Especially about Adam.

689
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:54,663
That's why I feel so...

690
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:56,448
I don't know.

691
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:59,538
Do you and Ray talk
about everything?

692
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:01,017
Sometimes I think

693
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:02,497
that Ray would talk
to his best friend

694
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:06,109
about things
that he doesn't say to me.

695
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:08,721
Dan and I have always said...

696
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:10,766
-"I married my best friend."
-Mmm.

697
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,638
So, if that's the case,

698
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:14,944
what are you going to do?

699
00:38:14,988 --> 00:38:17,164
LAURA:
I don't know.

700
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:20,254
Hi.

701
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:25,346
Do you remember sound?

702
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,652
Some things.

703
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:31,091
What do you remember?

704
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:34,224
Do you miss hearing things?

705
00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:35,400
When you think of sound,

706
00:38:35,443 --> 00:38:39,012
do you wish you could
hear things again?

707
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:45,323
I'm full. Done.

708
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,155
I wonder if, maybe,
it would've been easier

709
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,463
if he'd never
heard sound before.

710
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:56,203
If he'd

711
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:58,031
been born deaf like me.

712
00:38:58,074 --> 00:38:59,859
Easier?

713
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,513
For whom?

714
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:06,648
I remember the first time

715
00:39:06,692 --> 00:39:09,869
I understood there was sound
in the world.

716
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:12,872
I was a little girl.

717
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:14,917
My grandmother was hearing.

718
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:17,224
<i>She was outside
sweeping the porch.</i>

719
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:25,624
[teakettle whistling]

720
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,072
[whistling fades]

721
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,640
[whistling stops abruptly;
no audio]

722
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:47,559
[whistling resumes]

723
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:49,169
[no audio]

724
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:51,040
<i>And I remember
that's when I realized</i>

725
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,913
that's sound.

726
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:55,741
[under breath]:
Wow.

727
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:01,790
[no audio]

728
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:05,794
I'm supposed to know
what's right for him.

729
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:07,796
You do know.

730
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,581
Do I?

731
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:17,719
FLYNT: <i>
Uh, your parents</i>

732
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:21,114
are, um, hearing impaired?

733
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:25,901
Oh, they're deaf.

734
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:27,903
Well, you see, um, um,

735
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:30,689
usually, I, um...

736
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:33,866
Okay, my signing isn't
what it used to be.

737
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:35,911
Oh, I'll interpret.

738
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:37,522
Thank you.

739
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:39,698
You see, most
of the parents I see

740
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:43,397
about implants are hearing.

741
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:47,445
Uh, 90% of deaf kids
have hearing parents.

742
00:40:49,316 --> 00:40:50,099
Well, when I was born deaf,

743
00:40:50,143 --> 00:40:51,492
my parents celebrated.

744
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:54,887
Especially my father.
See, he's

745
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,237
he's big on Deaf Pride

746
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,281
and deaf culture.

747
00:40:58,325 --> 00:41:00,588
He even wrote a
book about it.

748
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:03,635
If he knew I was here...

749
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:04,984
I... I know, I know.

750
00:41:05,027 --> 00:41:06,115
FLYNT:
More and more

751
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,639
deaf parents are
getting implants

752
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:10,119
for their children,
if that, uh, helps you.

753
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:14,646
That makes me sad.

754
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,517
Well, we're just,
we're just here

755
00:41:16,561 --> 00:41:19,651
to get information,
that's all.

756
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:25,134
Tell me about the surgery.

757
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:28,398
The surgeon drills a hole
through the skull,

758
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:29,835
into the chamber
of the inner ear.

759
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:33,665
And then he inserts the
electrodes through the hole,

760
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,188
into the cochlea.

761
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:38,713
Takes three to five weeks
for the incision to heal.

762
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:40,933
And then there's
an external transmitter

763
00:41:40,976 --> 00:41:41,803
that, uh, attaches by magnet.

764
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:44,980
Then he can hear?

765
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:46,373
Not yet.

766
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:48,810
Well, how long before
he gets his hearing back?

767
00:41:48,854 --> 00:41:51,857
You do understand that
implants don't cure deafness.

768
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,902
When he removes
the device,

769
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:57,253
he's still a deaf child.

770
00:41:57,297 --> 00:42:00,474
So... what?

771
00:42:02,171 --> 00:42:05,174
Is he a... a deaf child
who hears?

772
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:07,916
Or is he a hearing child
who's deaf?

773
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,961
No...

774
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:10,789
he's, he's our son.

775
00:42:10,832 --> 00:42:13,356
No, he's too young.

776
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,140
He just turned eight.

777
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:16,011
-I know.
-Actually,

778
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:18,361
it's, it's, um, easier

779
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:22,191
for a child whose brain
is still developing

780
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:25,455
to learn to process
different sounds.

781
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:27,022
We find that the younger
the child is

782
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:29,634
the better the results we see.

783
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:32,550
We've implanted kids
as young as 12 months.

784
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:38,773
I'm trying to keep an open mind,

785
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:40,296
I really am.

786
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,299
That's why it's very important
for both of you

787
00:42:43,343 --> 00:42:46,041
to understand what implants can
and cannot do.

788
00:42:46,085 --> 00:42:48,130
Come with me.

789
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:48,870
<i>I want you to see something.</i>

790
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:50,959
WOMAN:
David...

791
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:53,048
I'm going to put
this on your ear.

792
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:55,050
And then I'll start this,

793
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:57,879
and if you hear anything,

794
00:42:57,923 --> 00:42:59,925
you tell me, okay?

795
00:43:07,106 --> 00:43:08,934
I scheduled your appointment so
you could see this.

796
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,418
See? It's the same.

797
00:43:15,462 --> 00:43:16,942
I'm going to activate
the implant.

798
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:23,905
Now, the hearing aid only
amplifies the sound.

799
00:43:23,949 --> 00:43:25,690
Makes it louder.

800
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:28,910
With an implant, 16 electrodes
are surgically inserted into

801
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:31,521
-the inner ear. -It will just
take a second, okay?

802
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:33,523
Now, that's
the processor,

803
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:35,090
attached to his ear there.

804
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:37,092
That sends the
sound impulses

805
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:39,573
to the implant,

806
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,750
which turns them into
electronic signals.

807
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:45,753
And they are sent
directly to the brain.

808
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:48,147
The whole thing runs
on a rechargeable battery.

809
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:48,974
[over speaker]:
Are you ready?

810
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:51,106
Okay, go ahead.

811
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,413
David?

812
00:43:54,196 --> 00:43:55,676
David?

813
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,983
Is he hearing me?

814
00:43:58,026 --> 00:43:59,680
It's okay; keep trying.

815
00:43:59,724 --> 00:44:02,727
David?

816
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:11,649
David.

817
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:18,090
Try again.

818
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:20,353
David.

819
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:27,621
MOTHER:

820
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,537
David?

821
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:38,066
Oh, darling.

822
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,068
Hey.

823
00:44:40,112 --> 00:44:42,418
Can you hear me?
Huh?

824
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:44,029
Can...
can he hear me?

825
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:45,595
He can't tell
it's your voice,

826
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:47,380
but he is responding
to the sound.

827
00:44:53,952 --> 00:44:55,736
[under breath]:
Wow.

828
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,652
FLYNT: <i>
Now, it'll, uh, take some time</i>

829
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,742
to retrain Adam's brain
to receive sound again.

830
00:45:01,786 --> 00:45:02,961
And then he'll need
speech therapy.

831
00:45:03,004 --> 00:45:07,400
Well, uh, maybe
at Adam's school, we can...

832
00:45:07,443 --> 00:45:09,663
Oh, Adam would have
to change schools.

833
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:12,797
...schools.

834
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,102
Why?

835
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,323
Well, with an implant, he'll be
going to a mainstream school

836
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:19,586
to learn how to listen
and speak.

837
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:22,937
What about his signing?

838
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:25,418
Oh, that would become
his second language.

839
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:31,641
And, with time,

840
00:45:31,685 --> 00:45:33,687
Adam will be able
to sign at home,

841
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,211
and speak and hear
in the outside world.

842
00:45:36,255 --> 00:45:38,431
Switch back and forth.

843
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:44,785
But he won't feel part
of the hearing world

844
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:47,048
because he'll never hear
what the other kids hear.

845
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:48,963
And he won't feel part

846
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:50,791
of the deaf world,
because he'll never

847
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:51,618
be totally deaf.

848
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:53,489
Well, I think you'll find

849
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:55,709
that Adam will have
the best of both worlds.

850
00:45:56,492 --> 00:45:58,843
And what do you say?

851
00:45:58,886 --> 00:46:00,975
What do you say
when Adam says,

852
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:01,976
"Daddy, why?

853
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,804
"Why are you doing
this to me?

854
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:06,807
-Could you... -"Is there
something wrong with being deaf?

855
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:08,156
No...
-"I don't get it.

856
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,418
Tell me, tell me."

857
00:46:09,462 --> 00:46:11,029
-What are you going to tell him?
-No... what,

858
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:12,987
what do, what do I say, when he
looks up at me and he says,

859
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:16,208
"You had the chance to
get my hearing back

860
00:46:16,251 --> 00:46:19,167
and you did nothing"?

861
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:20,516
What do I say then?

862
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,996
Oh, I, I know.

863
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,172
"Sorry, it wasn't
politically correct."

864
00:46:24,216 --> 00:46:25,957
Wait, you...

865
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,960
Folks, if you decide to go
through with this,

866
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:32,354
what we do is we assign
a psychologist to your case.

867
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:33,660
It's routine.

868
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:36,097
Well, Adam doesn't
need a shrink.

869
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:39,231
Well, no, this is to evaluate
the two of you as a couple.

870
00:46:42,582 --> 00:46:44,714
This is a life choice,

871
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:46,716
that you're making
for your family.

872
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,111
For it to work you both have
to be in complete agreement.

873
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,336
And if we're not?

874
00:46:57,379 --> 00:46:58,163
Then don't do it.

875
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,278

Come in,
Night Warrior

881
00:47:56,525 --> 00:47:57,352
Do you read me?

882
00:47:57,396 --> 00:48:00,355
Uh-oh! An alien creature!

883
00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:03,358
Blast him!
Blast him!

884
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:05,273
Blam! Blam! Blam!

885
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:07,841
Blam.

886
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,190
Hey, cut it out.

887
00:48:09,234 --> 00:48:11,410
He's an alien.

888
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:12,628
He can play with us.

889
00:48:12,672 --> 00:48:15,066
Talks like this...

890
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:17,024
-Look at me, I'm "death,"
I'm "death." -Stop it!

891
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:21,855
Look at me, I'm "death,"
I'm "death."

892
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,204
Stop it!

893
00:48:26,251 --> 00:48:28,209
Get off me!

894
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:30,255
Mark, stop that!

895
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:31,343
Get off of him!

896
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:33,214
What...? Come here!

897
00:48:33,258 --> 00:48:35,608
What is going on?

898
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:37,784
Come here.

899
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:44,965
What has gotten into you?

900
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:46,271
-He was making fun of Adam.
-Oh...

901
00:48:46,314 --> 00:48:48,882
Say you're sorry, Todd.

902
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,535
No.

903
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:51,537
Say you're sorry!

904
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,626
I think that's a good idea.
Say you're sorry.

905
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:55,933
Todd?!

906
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,420
How do you say...

907
00:49:05,464 --> 00:49:07,292
[over-enunciates]:
"I'm... sorry"?

908
00:49:11,035 --> 00:49:12,645
Todd!

909
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:19,391
I'm sorry.

910
00:49:36,321 --> 00:49:40,368
I'm, uh... I'm trying to help
the guys at the office

911
00:49:40,412 --> 00:49:43,067
with the King account.

912
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:49,334
They can't seem to do
anything without me.

913
00:50:06,264 --> 00:50:11,878
So, you went through
my briefcase?

914
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:14,533
Adam was drawing
a picture.

915
00:50:14,576 --> 00:50:16,361
He likes those
colored pens of yours.

916
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,026
Yes. We're set with
the psychologist

917
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:33,552
to be evaluated
as a couple.

918
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:37,338
So, we are going ahead.

919
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:41,690
For now.

920
00:50:41,734 --> 00:50:45,303
And when did "we" decide that?

921
00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:47,609
I was going to show you.

922
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:51,222
Oh, I see.

923
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:57,097
Evaluation as...

924
00:50:57,141 --> 00:50:59,404
a couple.

925
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:13,635
Mrs. Miller, would you say
you're a close family?

926
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:15,637
Yes.

927
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:16,682
You enjoy being
a grandmother?

928
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:17,813
Oh, I love it.

929
00:51:17,857 --> 00:51:19,511
I adore Adam.

930
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:20,773
He's my pride and joy.

931
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:23,384
That's why I just
don't understand...

932
00:51:23,428 --> 00:51:24,646
You don't understand what?

933
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,039
What mother,
if given the chance,

934
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,650
would deny her child the ability
to hear, to speak?

935
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:31,044
-Uh, Mrs. Miller, could you wait
until...? -If it were my child,

936
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,611
I would do anything
to help him.

937
00:51:32,654 --> 00:51:35,788
TATE: But isn't it true that if
Adam were in this courtroom

938
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:38,269
today, you, as his grandmother,

939
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:40,967
would be unable to
communicate with him?

940
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,708
To tell him
that you love him?

941
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:44,579
He knows that I love him.

942
00:51:44,623 --> 00:51:46,320
I tell him all the time.

943
00:51:46,364 --> 00:51:48,017
But how?

944
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:48,844
You don't speak
the same language.

945
00:51:48,888 --> 00:51:53,240
I hold him, I hug him.

946
00:51:53,284 --> 00:51:55,503
He sees it in my face.

947
00:51:55,547 --> 00:51:57,070
It's beyond words.

948
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,594
It doesn't matter
what language we speak.

949
00:51:59,638 --> 00:52:04,251
TATE:
No further questions.

950
00:52:04,295 --> 00:52:06,862
Let me ask you this--

951
00:52:06,906 --> 00:52:09,604
if your own daughter Laura
were hearing,

952
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:12,433
would you love her
any less?

953
00:52:12,477 --> 00:52:14,740
Of course not.

954
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:17,699
A mother loves her child,
no matter what.

955
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:20,267
So the fact that she is deaf is
actually irrelevant, isn't it?

956
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:22,530
And gives her no advantage,
pro or con, as a mother,

957
00:52:22,574 --> 00:52:24,706
isn't that what
you're saying?

958
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,794
Objection. Leading.

959
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:27,883
Seeking clarification,
Your Honor.

960
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:30,234
I'll allow it.

961
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:34,629
What I'm saying is,
my daughter and I

962
00:52:34,673 --> 00:52:36,501
share a deep bond.

963
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:39,765
We're both mothers.

964
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:47,729
There is no word for it,
no sign.

965
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:50,732
It's a woman's love
of her child.

966
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:55,433
It connects Adam to
Laura, her to me...

967
00:52:55,476 --> 00:52:58,392
all of us, all women

968
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:00,742
into a vast network

969
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:03,876
much more important
than any Internet.

970
00:53:03,919 --> 00:53:07,227
What about Dan?

971
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:10,578
Can't a man, a father,
deaf or hearing,

972
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:12,058
have the same connection

973
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:13,581
with his child?

974
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:16,758
Dan is a wonderful father.

975
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:18,412
I know that he loves

976
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:20,109
Adam deeply.

977
00:53:20,153 --> 00:53:24,201
That they share a deep
bond of their own.

978
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:26,986
But I also know that there
are many deaf people

979
00:53:27,029 --> 00:53:28,640
for whom the implant
was not successful.

980
00:53:28,683 --> 00:53:32,557
Dan needs to know that with
or without the implant,

981
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,820
Adam will always be deaf,

982
00:53:34,863 --> 00:53:36,648
and he must never be
denied his sign language.

983
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:39,868
What is Deaf Pride?

984
00:53:42,654 --> 00:53:45,787
Dignity, self-respect.

985
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:48,616
Can someone who
acquires deafness,

986
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,229
is not born deaf,
have Deaf Pride?

987
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:54,448
Well...

988
00:53:54,492 --> 00:53:56,755
no, it's not the same.

989
00:53:56,798 --> 00:53:58,278
How so?

990
00:53:58,322 --> 00:53:59,801
Being born deaf gives you what?

991
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:05,111
A deeper understanding,
appreciation of the deaf world.

992
00:54:05,154 --> 00:54:07,896
GRISHAM:
So, are you saying

993
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,029
there are two worlds--
one for the hearing,

994
00:54:10,072 --> 00:54:12,205
-one for the deaf?
-Yes.

995
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,641
GRISHAM: But isn't it true that
the only difference

996
00:54:13,685 --> 00:54:16,165
between a deaf
and hearing person

997
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:18,255
is that one hears
and the other doesn't?

998
00:54:18,298 --> 00:54:21,301
-Otherwise they are entirely the
same? -No, it's more than that.

999
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:23,303
As I explained in my book,

1000
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:26,567
we are a minority
in this country--

1001
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:29,004
with a culture.

1002
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:31,006
And like other minorities,

1003
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:34,662
we have some
painful history.

1004
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:39,972
Discrimination, prejudice,
lack of opportunity.

1005
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:41,713
All we want is to be ourselves,

1006
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:45,151
be perceived as people

1007
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:47,501
and to celebrate who we are.

1008
00:54:47,545 --> 00:54:50,287
But wouldn't life be easier
for you if you could hear?

1009
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:55,117
The majority always thinks
each minority

1010
00:54:55,161 --> 00:54:56,945
wants to be like them.

1011
00:54:56,989 --> 00:55:01,689
Most hearing people
think that a deaf person,

1012
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:04,997
if given a chance, would rather
be hearing than deaf.

1013
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,564
Not true.

1014
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:07,782
Not for me.

1015
00:55:07,826 --> 00:55:08,957
I know who I am.

1016
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:12,483
I have my people,
I have my language,

1017
00:55:12,526 --> 00:55:15,660
I have my culture--
my identity.

1018
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,793
Let me be.

1019
00:55:18,837 --> 00:55:19,925
As my wife says,

1020
00:55:19,968 --> 00:55:23,363
God made all of us different

1021
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:26,410
for a reason.

1022
00:56:09,888 --> 00:56:13,065
Yeah.
Happy Thanksgiving to all.

1023
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:45,053
Dah-dee.

1024
00:56:48,796 --> 00:56:51,538
Dah-dee.

1025
00:56:51,582 --> 00:56:54,193
Uh, yes, what...

1026
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:55,107
what is it?

1027
00:56:57,892 --> 00:57:00,112
Potatoes? Yeah.

1028
00:57:04,812 --> 00:57:07,293
Thank you.

1029
00:57:13,908 --> 00:57:17,129
Thank you, Daddy.

1030
00:57:18,783 --> 00:57:20,785
You're...

1031
00:57:20,828 --> 00:57:23,701
you're welcome.

1032
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,930
[phone ringing]

1033
00:57:35,974 --> 00:57:40,457
Oh, my, uh... phone.
Ringing.

1034
00:57:47,942 --> 00:57:50,162
[door closes]

1035
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:08,615
When did that start--
Adam speaking?

1036
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:10,617
Stop it.

1037
00:58:11,618 --> 00:58:12,445
What is going on?

1038
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:14,534
Something is wrong
with you and Dan.

1039
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:17,581
What is it?

1040
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:32,291
Dan... he and I think
we should...

1041
00:58:32,334 --> 00:58:32,944
Are you two planning
to separate?

1042
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:36,513
No, no.

1043
00:58:42,475 --> 00:58:44,869
Dan thinks we should...

1044
00:58:47,654 --> 00:58:51,789
...explore the idea of
getting Adam an implant.

1045
00:59:13,071 --> 00:59:15,595
No, Mom, we just finished.

1046
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:17,118
I wish you and Dad were here.

1047
00:59:17,162 --> 00:59:19,599
You won't believe, what...

1048
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:21,645
Wait a minute.
Hold on a second.

1049
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:32,569
It's Grandma.

1050
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:33,874
She wants to talk to you.

1051
00:59:33,918 --> 00:59:36,398
Okay? All right.

1052
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:38,618
Use your voice.

1053
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:39,706
You sounded great.

1054
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:42,361
And it would make her
very, very happy, so...

1055
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:43,971
Say, "Hello, Grandma.

1056
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:47,366
Happy Thanksgiving," okay?

1057
00:59:48,846 --> 00:59:50,630
Here.

1058
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:53,590
No...

1059
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:56,854
Adam, just use your voice.

1060
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,859
Please.

1061
01:00:06,907 --> 01:00:08,779
Okay. [laughs softly]

1062
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:17,265
He says, "Hi, Grandma.
Happy Thanksgiving."

1063
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:22,314
Yeah. Yeah.

1064
01:00:22,357 --> 01:00:24,664
She says,
"Happy Thanksgiving

1065
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:25,883
to you, too."

1066
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:28,973
Ah.

1067
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:32,759
Did you eat a lot of turkey?

1068
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:43,161
You would never

1069
01:00:43,204 --> 01:00:45,685
stick an implant
in our grandson.

1070
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:49,210
You know that I love him
the way he is.

1071
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:51,299
But I'm just so afraid--

1072
01:00:51,343 --> 01:00:54,346
what if I'm holding
him back in some way?

1073
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:55,260
Holding him back?!

1074
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:57,001
Has being deaf held me back?

1075
01:00:57,044 --> 01:00:59,264
No, of course not!

1076
01:00:59,307 --> 01:01:00,613
When I was his age,

1077
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,094
I was the only deaf kid
in the entire town.

1078
01:01:03,137 --> 01:01:05,400
I was made fun of,
I was beat up.

1079
01:01:05,444 --> 01:01:07,707
-I was alone.
-She knows.

1080
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:09,709
Nobody ever signed
to me. Nobody.

1081
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:12,712
My father told me
to talk like he did.

1082
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:15,149
He'd tie my hands together
and lock me in a closet

1083
01:01:15,193 --> 01:01:16,324
to keep me from signing.

1084
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:18,022
Yes, yes, it was awful.

1085
01:01:18,065 --> 01:01:19,284
-She knows.
-My father wanted

1086
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:21,068
my deafness to go away.

1087
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:23,070
Like these implants.

1088
01:01:23,114 --> 01:01:24,550
Wipe us out. No more deaf.

1089
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:26,944
She has to figure out
what's best for her son.

1090
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:28,249
You can't force
your experience on her.

1091
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:30,991
You're a deaf mother
with a deaf son!

1092
01:01:31,035 --> 01:01:33,298
I'm his mother first.

1093
01:01:33,341 --> 01:01:34,603
You are deaf first!

1094
01:01:34,647 --> 01:01:35,735
And Dan is still his father.

1095
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:37,389
Dan is ashamed
of his own son!

1096
01:01:37,432 --> 01:01:38,738
-And his wife?
-Stop it, both of you!

1097
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:40,871
Dan loves me for my heart,
not my ears.

1098
01:01:40,914 --> 01:01:41,959
I am Dan's wife--

1099
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:44,701
-not his deaf wife, his wife.
-I see different.

1100
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:46,528
What do you see, that Dan
doesn't love me anymore?

1101
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:49,053
Dan thinks we're
handicapped, <i>disabled.</i>

1102
01:01:49,096 --> 01:01:52,752
-What?! -No. The truth is, <i>
you</i> think that...

1103
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:54,101
about yourself!

1104
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:56,408
Come on, let's go.

1105
01:01:58,192 --> 01:02:01,630
You're a proud man
and I love you,

1106
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:03,241
but you live too much

1107
01:02:03,284 --> 01:02:04,459
with a capital "D."

1108
01:02:04,503 --> 01:02:05,765
Deaf way or no way.

1109
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:07,636
You see yourself
as a deaf man

1110
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,029
instead of just a man.

1111
01:02:09,073 --> 01:02:10,074
End of subject! Finished!

1112
01:02:11,118 --> 01:02:13,077
You were born deaf.

1113
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,383
You have a responsibility

1114
01:02:15,427 --> 01:02:17,037
to pass on our culture.

1115
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:19,300
"Born deaf"! "Born deaf"!

1116
01:02:19,344 --> 01:02:22,434
As if that made
me <i>more</i> deaf!

1117
01:02:29,354 --> 01:02:31,530
[door slams]

1118
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:38,885
It's time for all
of this to stop.

1119
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:46,937
Tell her.

1120
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,035
You...

1121
01:03:11,178 --> 01:03:15,052
You were born hearing.

1122
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:32,765
You were the most beautiful baby
I had ever seen.

1123
01:03:40,642 --> 01:03:43,080
Is that true?

1124
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:51,088
On the morning you were born,

1125
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:53,655
I...

1126
01:03:53,699 --> 01:03:55,919
I walked into the hospital room.

1127
01:03:55,962 --> 01:04:01,707
Your mother held you,
wrapped in a pink blanket.

1128
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,710
I stood behind you and...

1129
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:11,543
And we knew.

1130
01:04:13,414 --> 01:04:15,416
And you were disappointed.

1131
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:19,072
I was upset, said some things,

1132
01:04:19,116 --> 01:04:21,509
scared your mother.

1133
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:25,426
I was relieved

1134
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:28,865
when your hearing
finally went away.

1135
01:04:38,352 --> 01:04:39,876
[sighs]

1136
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:49,711
Before then, you were
very hard of hearing.

1137
01:04:49,755 --> 01:04:52,018
Without hearing aids,
you heard very little.

1138
01:04:52,062 --> 01:04:56,283
A loud noise,
door slam, a siren.

1139
01:04:56,327 --> 01:04:58,329
A teakettle.

1140
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:04,161
[sighs]

1141
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:07,860
What?

1142
01:05:09,688 --> 01:05:13,997
You never gave me hearing aids.

1143
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,999
Why?

1144
01:05:18,784 --> 01:05:22,266
So you could say
I was born deaf?

1145
01:05:22,309 --> 01:05:26,357
We did what we felt was best

1146
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,401
for our daughter.

1147
01:05:27,445 --> 01:05:31,579
You couldn't accept me as I was.

1148
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:49,902
Is everyone mad at me?

1149
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,860
No. No.

1150
01:05:51,904 --> 01:05:54,254
Nobody's mad at you.

1151
01:05:57,388 --> 01:05:59,956
I'm very proud of you.

1152
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:03,960
[laughs gently]

1153
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:07,876
Okay.

1154
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,359
This is the story
of... Pinocchio.

1155
01:06:12,403 --> 01:06:13,970
All right.

1156
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:17,756
"Once upon a time,
there was a woodcutter.

1157
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:21,368
"Now, he was very lonely.

1158
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:27,505
"Now, what this old man wanted
more than anything in the world

1159
01:06:27,548 --> 01:06:30,203
"was a son.

1160
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:31,944
"But instead,

1161
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,729
"he only had a puppet.

1162
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:38,951
"So, this lonely...

1163
01:06:43,173 --> 01:06:49,266
"...this lonely man pretended
that the puppet was a real boy."

1164
01:06:56,621 --> 01:06:59,015
[car engine starts outside]

1165
01:07:30,785 --> 01:07:32,874
DAN:
So...

1166
01:07:32,918 --> 01:07:36,226
you were born hearing?

1167
01:07:38,402 --> 01:07:41,840
I... saw.

1168
01:07:45,887 --> 01:07:47,367
That was a private conversation.

1169
01:07:47,411 --> 01:07:50,240
I was worried about you.

1170
01:07:52,546 --> 01:07:54,983
Don't walk away from me.

1171
01:07:55,027 --> 01:07:56,202
I love you, all right?

1172
01:07:56,246 --> 01:07:59,597
I'm... I-I am not
the big bad hearing man.

1173
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,468
Oh! Deaf, hearing,
deaf, hearing!

1174
01:08:01,512 --> 01:08:03,775
I'm sick of it! All of it!

1175
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:04,950
-Laura...
-[angry grunt]

1176
01:08:04,993 --> 01:08:07,779
Laura, look...
look at me, look at me.

1177
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:08,997
No! No!

1178
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:10,956
-Leave me alone! Don't touch me!
-Laura!

1179
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:13,306
Everybody, leave me alone!

1180
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:14,655
Laura, stop.

1181
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:16,135
-Stop, stop.
-[cries]

1182
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:17,919
Stop. Stop.

1183
01:08:17,963 --> 01:08:19,138
-[groaning, crying]
-Stop.

1184
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:20,052
Stop it.

1185
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,446
-[sobbing]
-Stop it, stop.

1186
01:08:22,489 --> 01:08:24,361
It's all right.

1187
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:26,537
It's okay, it's okay.

1188
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,800
[sobbing]

1189
01:08:42,814 --> 01:08:45,991
[slow, gentle theme playing]

1190
01:08:55,914 --> 01:08:57,742
What's that?

1191
01:08:57,785 --> 01:08:58,917
A robot.

1192
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,398
A robot? Mm-hmm.

1193
01:09:02,486 --> 01:09:03,791
Good one.

1194
01:09:03,835 --> 01:09:05,315
Thanks.

1195
01:09:11,059 --> 01:09:15,499
Your father wants you to know
that he loves you very much.

1196
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:17,196
I know he does.

1197
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,502
[doorbell rings]

1198
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:24,856
SALLY:
You have to understand

1199
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:26,640
that it isn't
easy for him.

1200
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:32,777
Mom, can I go out and play?

1201
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,258
Mm-hmm. That's fine.

1202
01:09:40,045 --> 01:09:42,526
Let me take a look.

1203
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,663
What do I do about Adam?

1204
01:09:49,707 --> 01:09:51,187
About my husband?

1205
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,276
When your father and I
were first married...

1206
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:56,017
Your marriage and mine,
your era and mine

1207
01:09:56,061 --> 01:09:57,497
were worlds apart.

1208
01:09:57,541 --> 01:09:59,934
SALLY:
Perhaps.

1209
01:09:59,978 --> 01:10:01,327
I teach deaf kids,

1210
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:06,114
but I had never seen a child
slowly go deaf over time

1211
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:07,594
until it happened
to my son.

1212
01:10:07,638 --> 01:10:10,554
It happened to my daughter.

1213
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:13,252
[sighs]

1214
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:16,429
He would stand right
here in this room

1215
01:10:16,473 --> 01:10:20,520
and turn up the TV set
louder and louder...

1216
01:10:20,564 --> 01:10:22,566
and still not hear it,

1217
01:10:22,609 --> 01:10:24,959
and then look to me.

1218
01:10:25,003 --> 01:10:27,092
It can be heartbreaking.

1219
01:10:27,135 --> 01:10:29,964
The deaf part of me said,

1220
01:10:30,008 --> 01:10:32,706
"Don't worry, Adam, there's
nothing wrong with you."

1221
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,447
That's right.

1222
01:10:34,491 --> 01:10:35,970
But...

1223
01:10:36,014 --> 01:10:38,495
the mother part of me

1224
01:10:38,538 --> 01:10:43,630
was saying, "My little boy
is scared and confused,

1225
01:10:43,674 --> 01:10:45,937
and I can't help him."

1226
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,199
[sighs]

1227
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,027
Well, maybe now I can.

1228
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:52,596
You have choices today
I never had to face.

1229
01:10:55,076 --> 01:11:00,299
If you had a choice with me,
what would you have done?

1230
01:11:00,343 --> 01:11:01,996
[chuckles]

1231
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,695
You are what
you are meant to be.

1232
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:07,219
You're a teacher.

1233
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:12,529
What is the lesson
you want to give your son?

1234
01:11:20,754 --> 01:11:22,974
[phone beeps]

1235
01:11:31,461 --> 01:11:34,942
Excuse me, Dr. Walter,
I can't get a...

1236
01:11:37,162 --> 01:11:39,991
I was just saying,
I-I can't get a...

1237
01:11:40,818 --> 01:11:42,733
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

1238
01:11:42,776 --> 01:11:44,125
You're-you're deaf?

1239
01:11:44,169 --> 01:11:45,649
Hard-of-hearing.

1240
01:11:45,692 --> 01:11:48,042
Oh, uh, no one told me.

1241
01:11:48,086 --> 01:11:49,566
One partner in your marriage
is deaf.

1242
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:53,744
That's why I've been
assigned to your case.

1243
01:11:53,787 --> 01:11:56,355
Please, have a seat.

1244
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:58,879
Uh, do you want some coffee?

1245
01:11:58,923 --> 01:12:01,186
No, thank you.

1246
01:12:03,449 --> 01:12:06,539
Being hard-of-hearing and deaf
are two different things.

1247
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:08,019
Yes.

1248
01:12:08,062 --> 01:12:09,760
I think I heard that
from somewhere.

1249
01:12:13,807 --> 01:12:15,548
So, you were saying...?

1250
01:12:15,592 --> 01:12:20,379
Yeah, I-I can't get a signal
in this area for s...

1251
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:22,599
Has... My wife--
has she called you yet?

1252
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:24,557
No. No, she hasn't.

1253
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:28,953
Well... she's late.
I don't know where she is.

1254
01:12:28,996 --> 01:12:30,389
You're here.

1255
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:31,347
Yes, I'm here.

1256
01:12:32,565 --> 01:12:33,653
But I think the whole point
was for you

1257
01:12:33,697 --> 01:12:35,220
to assess Laura and me

1258
01:12:35,263 --> 01:12:37,222
-as a couple.
-That's right.

1259
01:12:40,704 --> 01:12:44,577
Well, I hate to point out the
obvious, but Laura's not here.

1260
01:12:44,621 --> 01:12:45,970
That's right.

1261
01:12:46,013 --> 01:12:47,493
And if she's not here,

1262
01:12:47,537 --> 01:12:49,103
then she can't tell us how
she feels about the implant.

1263
01:12:49,147 --> 01:12:52,150
I think she is telling us how
she feels about the implant.

1264
01:12:52,193 --> 01:12:54,239
I hate to point out
the obvious.

1265
01:12:55,066 --> 01:12:57,068
Is this typical of Laura?

1266
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:58,809
Not calling?
Not showing up?

1267
01:12:59,766 --> 01:13:00,680
No.

1268
01:13:00,724 --> 01:13:03,335
Then why is she doing it now?

1269
01:13:05,598 --> 01:13:07,208
I want to focus on Adam,

1270
01:13:07,252 --> 01:13:08,688
not make this about her.

1271
01:13:08,732 --> 01:13:09,689
He's her son.

1272
01:13:09,733 --> 01:13:11,865
Yeah, well, he's my son, too.

1273
01:13:11,909 --> 01:13:12,823
I mean, what am I?

1274
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:15,216
Am I the "evil hearing father"

1275
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:17,958
because, you know, I want my kid
to, you know, hear again?

1276
01:13:18,002 --> 01:13:19,046
No, of course not.

1277
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,047
Thank you.

1278
01:13:20,091 --> 01:13:21,309
But know what?

1279
01:13:21,353 --> 01:13:23,094
Debating on the pros and cons

1280
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:24,965
of getting an implant
is not my job.

1281
01:13:25,009 --> 01:13:27,054
-It doesn't interest me.
-Oh.

1282
01:13:27,098 --> 01:13:29,579
Well, what does interest you?

1283
01:13:29,622 --> 01:13:31,537
You.

1284
01:13:31,581 --> 01:13:32,712
You interest me.

1285
01:13:32,756 --> 01:13:34,888
[scoffing laugh]

1286
01:13:34,932 --> 01:13:36,324
[sighs]

1287
01:13:36,368 --> 01:13:37,282
Talk with your wife,

1288
01:13:37,325 --> 01:13:39,110
and we'll arrange another time.

1289
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:42,592
I don't think
I have any more time.

1290
01:13:46,683 --> 01:13:48,641
May I ask you a question?

1291
01:13:48,685 --> 01:13:49,642
Of course.

1292
01:13:49,686 --> 01:13:49,860
That's why I'm here.

1293
01:13:52,906 --> 01:13:54,821
When Laura and I got married,

1294
01:13:54,865 --> 01:13:58,825
we wanted to have a baby
real bad.

1295
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:04,178
I knew when Adam was conceived,
it was beautiful.

1296
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:05,963
I mean, I-I-I-I knew.

1297
01:14:06,006 --> 01:14:08,879
I knew we were making our baby.

1298
01:14:08,922 --> 01:14:10,707
That's a nice thing to remember.

1299
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,797
No, it's not.

1300
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:21,457
Because when I was holding Laura
in my arms...

1301
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,242
all I could think about was...

1302
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:30,161
please...
make us a hearing baby.

1303
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:36,167
Does... does that make me bad?

1304
01:14:55,229 --> 01:14:57,231
It's late.

1305
01:14:57,275 --> 01:14:58,581
Adam sleeping?

1306
01:14:58,624 --> 01:15:03,455
Yeah. He kept asking me,
"Where's Daddy?"

1307
01:15:05,588 --> 01:15:08,765
I met with the, uh,
therapist today.

1308
01:15:09,722 --> 01:15:13,726
We had, uh, had
that appointment, remember?

1309
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:17,164
I was worried
that something had happened.

1310
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:19,515
Something did happen.

1311
01:15:21,995 --> 01:15:27,087
Did you explain to Adam

1312
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:29,481
why Mommy not only
didn't show up

1313
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:33,050
at her 3:45 appointment
with the therapist

1314
01:15:33,093 --> 01:15:38,795
and with Daddy,
but didn't even call?

1315
01:15:38,838 --> 01:15:40,100
I tried calling.

1316
01:15:40,144 --> 01:15:42,102
I tried texting.

1317
01:15:42,146 --> 01:15:44,235
But it-it wouldn't send.

1318
01:15:44,278 --> 01:15:46,759
It just said, "Signal failure."

1319
01:15:46,803 --> 01:15:53,026
Well, I couldn't get a signal
in that building, so...

1320
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:55,855
So I tried to reach
the receptionist.

1321
01:15:55,899 --> 01:15:58,075
I typed a message but stopped.

1322
01:15:58,118 --> 01:16:00,381
Mm-hmm.

1323
01:16:00,425 --> 01:16:02,949
The words I typed on my screen
were there:

1324
01:16:02,993 --> 01:16:07,084
"Can you find my husband?"

1325
01:16:07,127 --> 01:16:09,347
Where have you gone?

1326
01:16:11,175 --> 01:16:12,872
One plus one makes two.

1327
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:15,005
I teach math,

1328
01:16:15,048 --> 01:16:16,397
-don't forget.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1329
01:16:16,441 --> 01:16:18,443
One plus one...

1330
01:16:18,486 --> 01:16:21,664
-makes two?
-Adam and I.

1331
01:16:21,707 --> 01:16:26,146
If there's something wrong
with Adam,

1332
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:28,801
then there's something wrong
with me.

1333
01:16:28,845 --> 01:16:31,891
And I don't know
when that happened.

1334
01:16:31,935 --> 01:16:34,415
When did that happen?

1335
01:16:36,026 --> 01:16:38,942
When did that happen?!

1336
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:41,814
That I became disabled?!
To you?!

1337
01:16:41,858 --> 01:16:43,076
Dis-abled!

1338
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,164
Not able!

1339
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:45,557
To what,
be your wife, your lover?!

1340
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,646
Carry on a conversation--
what?! What happened?!

1341
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:51,128
You can't have a conversation
with anyone without me,

1342
01:16:51,171 --> 01:16:52,520
can you?!

1343
01:16:52,564 --> 01:16:55,306
Without me having
to interpret everything for you

1344
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:57,961
back and forth,
back and forth!

1345
01:16:58,004 --> 01:17:02,313
God gave me a hearing son

1346
01:17:02,356 --> 01:17:04,837
and then He let me
fall in love with him.

1347
01:17:04,881 --> 01:17:06,143
And then, then He...

1348
01:17:06,186 --> 01:17:10,582
[Laura crying, sniffling]

1349
01:17:19,243 --> 01:17:22,202
God gave me a hearing son

1350
01:17:22,246 --> 01:17:24,074
and then took him
away from me.

1351
01:17:24,117 --> 01:17:27,686
And now, I see him
sitting with you,

1352
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:33,387
just signing away, and I think
to myself, "No, it's not fair.

1353
01:17:33,431 --> 01:17:34,867
He was mine!"

1354
01:17:34,911 --> 01:17:36,913
He's ours!

1355
01:17:36,956 --> 01:17:39,785
I want my son back!

1356
01:17:58,369 --> 01:18:00,023
We were a family.

1357
01:18:03,896 --> 01:18:07,508
So much has happened
since Adam's birthday.

1358
01:18:07,552 --> 01:18:12,339
My wife and I
are, you know, here...

1359
01:18:12,383 --> 01:18:14,646
legally separated.

1360
01:18:17,301 --> 01:18:19,129
Your Honor,

1361
01:18:19,172 --> 01:18:21,174
please, just give me my son.

1362
01:18:21,827 --> 01:18:25,657
Are you currently employed,
Mr. Miller?

1363
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,615
I work at Krupp, Harrison
& Dean.

1364
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:29,748
It's one of the biggest
PR firms in the city.

1365
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:31,837
And how does your salary compare
to that of your wife?

1366
01:18:31,881 --> 01:18:34,971
I make more than three times
her salary, and next year

1367
01:18:35,014 --> 01:18:37,974
they're going to make me
senior vice president.

1368
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:40,324
Your Honor, submitted
are financial statements

1369
01:18:40,367 --> 01:18:41,934
of Mr. Miller's
current holdings,

1370
01:18:41,978 --> 01:18:45,024
as well as projection
reports of future earnings.

1371
01:18:45,068 --> 01:18:47,984
It includes a financial
portfolio Mr. Miller has created

1372
01:18:48,027 --> 01:18:50,813
to fund Adam's future care
and education.

1373
01:18:50,856 --> 01:18:53,946
Does it also include the cost
of getting a cochlear implant?

1374
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:55,469
Objection!

1375
01:18:55,513 --> 01:18:57,036
Sustained. Out of line.
I'm warning you.

1376
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,778
GRISHAM:
Mr. Miller,

1377
01:18:59,822 --> 01:19:02,128
are you willing
and able to undertake

1378
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:04,652
the financial responsibility
of raising a child,

1379
01:19:04,696 --> 01:19:06,785
as well as alimony payments
to your wife,

1380
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:09,788
should your separation
become final?

1381
01:19:09,832 --> 01:19:12,312
I'll provide Adam
with whatever he needs

1382
01:19:12,356 --> 01:19:14,053
and help Laura any way I can.

1383
01:19:14,097 --> 01:19:16,229
Mr. Miller...

1384
01:19:16,273 --> 01:19:18,710
do you love your son?

1385
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:22,235
Uh, more than anything
in the world.

1386
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:26,152
Does he seem any less to you,
now that he is deaf?

1387
01:19:26,196 --> 01:19:28,851
[clears throat]
Absolutely not.

1388
01:19:28,894 --> 01:19:30,374
He's my son.

1389
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:32,115
I want my son.

1390
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:33,377
GRISHAM:
Thank you, Mr. Miller.

1391
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:34,726
No further questions.

1392
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,946
Mr. Miller, if you retain
custody of your son,

1393
01:19:36,989 --> 01:19:39,818
will you give him
a cochlear implant?

1394
01:19:39,862 --> 01:19:40,732
Objection!

1395
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,168
The question is hypothetical

1396
01:19:42,212 --> 01:19:44,475
and asks the witness
to theorize on future events.

1397
01:19:44,518 --> 01:19:46,477
Your Honor, the question
is no more hypothetical

1398
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,957
than a report
of projected earnings.

1399
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,349
Mr. Miller could lose
his job tomorrow.

1400
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:50,786
The question is fundamental

1401
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:52,918
to the child's future
under care of this witness.

1402
01:19:52,962 --> 01:19:57,357
I'll allow it, but... remember,
this is a custody hearing.

1403
01:19:57,401 --> 01:19:58,271
It's not a legal debate
about implants.

1404
01:19:58,315 --> 01:20:01,318
The witness will answer.

1405
01:20:01,361 --> 01:20:02,406
Mr. Miller, I'll ask you again.

1406
01:20:02,449 --> 01:20:05,278
If you receive
custody of your son,

1407
01:20:05,322 --> 01:20:07,280
will you give him
a cochlear implant?

1408
01:20:07,324 --> 01:20:08,629
[clears throat]

1409
01:20:08,673 --> 01:20:10,283
He'll never hear
Mozart again.

1410
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:12,024
-Or the Beatles.
-Yes or no?

1411
01:20:12,068 --> 01:20:12,938
Or Beethoven.

1412
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:14,461
Beethoven was deaf, Mr. Miller.

1413
01:20:14,505 --> 01:20:15,680
Or the crack of a baseball bat

1414
01:20:15,723 --> 01:20:16,812
-in a major league ballpark.
-Yes or no?

1415
01:20:16,855 --> 01:20:19,031
I want my son
to hear those things.

1416
01:20:19,075 --> 01:20:21,512
Yes, I would give him
a cochlear implant.

1417
01:20:21,555 --> 01:20:23,383
So, the truth is, you
don't accept your son

1418
01:20:23,427 --> 01:20:24,341
for who he is, do you?

1419
01:20:24,384 --> 01:20:26,082
Of course I do.

1420
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:27,866
Then why are you planning to
have him surgically altered?

1421
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:29,563
Objection.
Inflammatory.

1422
01:20:29,607 --> 01:20:30,521
Sustained.

1423
01:20:30,564 --> 01:20:32,044
Why the rush, Mr. Miller?

1424
01:20:32,088 --> 01:20:33,176
Why not allow Adam

1425
01:20:34,612 --> 01:20:36,048
the freedom of experiencing
life as a deaf person?

1426
01:20:36,092 --> 01:20:38,746
Then, as an adult, he
can decide for himself.

1427
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:40,574
The best time is now.

1428
01:20:40,618 --> 01:20:42,098
For him or for you?

1429
01:20:42,141 --> 01:20:45,057
A parent has to decide
what's best for his child.

1430
01:20:45,101 --> 01:20:49,018
But the child's mother is
pleading with you not to do it.

1431
01:20:49,061 --> 01:20:51,498
Is she not also
the child's parent?

1432
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:53,196
She may be deaf,
but she has a voice.

1433
01:20:53,239 --> 01:20:55,676
Does she not, Mr. Miller?

1434
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,896
I'm thinking
of Adam's best interests.

1435
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,115
But is it
in Adam's best interest

1436
01:20:59,158 --> 01:21:02,422
to surgically insert
an electronic device

1437
01:21:02,466 --> 01:21:04,250
into his skull,
when the benefits

1438
01:21:04,294 --> 01:21:06,905
are controversial and the
long-term effects are unknown?

1439
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:11,083
I want my son to be able to hear
a smoke detector or a symphony,

1440
01:21:11,127 --> 01:21:13,694
use a telephone, or hear
someone yell, "Look out!"

1441
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:15,522
Or his grandmother say,
"I love you."

1442
01:21:15,566 --> 01:21:17,437
I mean, is that
such a terrible thing?

1443
01:21:17,481 --> 01:21:19,744
-Mr. Miller, nobody is saying...
-What am I supposed to do?

1444
01:21:19,787 --> 01:21:21,180
Keep him from hearing on purpose
when I don't have to?

1445
01:21:21,224 --> 01:21:24,662
Why would I do that?
What kind of father would I be?

1446
01:21:24,705 --> 01:21:26,316
Your Honor, could you
please have

1447
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:27,839
-Mr. Miller answer the question?
-I would cut off my right arm

1448
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:31,147
in a heartbeat for my boy,
if that made his life easier.

1449
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:35,151
Isn't that how a parent
is supposed to feel?

1450
01:21:49,121 --> 01:21:50,862
Is Dan a bad father?

1451
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,168
No.

1452
01:21:52,211 --> 01:21:55,127
And do you consider
yourself a good mother?

1453
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:57,347
Of course.

1454
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:59,044
And yet Dan is trying to afford

1455
01:21:59,088 --> 01:22:01,307
every opportunity for your son
and you are not.

1456
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:02,308
Objection.

1457
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:04,093
I'll rephrase.

1458
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:06,269
How do you reconcile the fact
that your son,

1459
01:22:06,312 --> 01:22:09,620
without an implant, has a
much more limited future?

1460
01:22:09,663 --> 01:22:11,622
That's a matter of opinion.

1461
01:22:11,665 --> 01:22:13,624
-I don't think he does.
-Opinion, Mrs. Miller?

1462
01:22:13,667 --> 01:22:15,495
We've established that
statistically.

1463
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:17,062
I'm a teacher.

1464
01:22:17,106 --> 01:22:22,154
I teach my students that
deafness is not a disability.

1465
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:23,025
GRISHAM:
All right.

1466
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,462
That it's something
to be celebrated.

1467
01:22:25,505 --> 01:22:26,376
All right, all right,
thank you, Mrs. Miller.

1468
01:22:26,419 --> 01:22:27,551
Wait. I've not stopped talking.

1469
01:22:27,594 --> 01:22:28,291
You've answered the
question, Mrs....

1470
01:22:28,334 --> 01:22:29,640
Your Honor, objection!

1471
01:22:29,683 --> 01:22:30,858
The wtness should be allowed to
answer the question fully.

1472
01:22:30,902 --> 01:22:33,687
I will allow it.
The witness will continue.

1473
01:22:33,731 --> 01:22:38,170
I teach them to accept
their deafness,

1474
01:22:38,214 --> 01:22:41,043
cherish it, revel in it.

1475
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:45,090
As his mother, I tell Adam
to accept his deafness.

1476
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:46,309
That he is not disabled.

1477
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:48,833
-That he is able... -Your Honor,
we've already established

1478
01:22:48,876 --> 01:22:49,921
that Adam <i>is</i> disabled.

1479
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,228
You've made your point,
Mr. Grisham.

1480
01:22:54,186 --> 01:22:58,364
He is able to do
everything except hear.

1481
01:22:58,408 --> 01:23:02,020
That his inability to hear

1482
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:04,718
has no effect on
his ability to think

1483
01:23:04,762 --> 01:23:07,852
to achieve, to love.

1484
01:23:07,895 --> 01:23:11,029
Adam's ability to love is not
in question here, Your Honor.

1485
01:23:11,073 --> 01:23:13,771
Let me hear her out,
Mr. Grisham.

1486
01:23:16,078 --> 01:23:19,820
LAURA: My job is to teach
Adam to be himself,

1487
01:23:19,864 --> 01:23:26,349
to thrive and grow up to
become a decent and kind man

1488
01:23:26,392 --> 01:23:28,351
no matter what.

1489
01:23:28,394 --> 01:23:32,224
To celebrate his difference,
his uniqueness.

1490
01:23:32,268 --> 01:23:40,015
Adam has already experienced
one trauma-- becoming deaf.

1491
01:23:40,058 --> 01:23:43,496
I feel he shouldn't be
put through another one.

1492
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:45,890
I believe
what's best for Adam

1493
01:23:45,933 --> 01:23:49,502
is to let him be.

1494
01:23:49,546 --> 01:23:51,504
Let him be Adam.

1495
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:55,639
And that's why

1496
01:23:55,682 --> 01:23:59,034
I must have custody of my son.

1497
01:24:07,129 --> 01:24:09,435
Let me remind both parties
once again:

1498
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:11,089
This is a custody hearing.

1499
01:24:11,133 --> 01:24:15,006
The purpose of these
proceedings is not

1500
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,312
for the court to decide

1501
01:24:16,355 --> 01:24:18,357
whether the minor
should receive an implant.

1502
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:20,011
That's a personal issue.

1503
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:23,710
I will deliberate
over the weekend.

1504
01:24:23,754 --> 01:24:26,365
This court will reconvene
on Monday at 3:00,

1505
01:24:26,409 --> 01:24:28,933
at which time

1506
01:24:28,976 --> 01:24:32,110
I will rule on the matter
of the custody of the minor.

1508

Leonard, what does this mean?

1510
01:24:43,861 --> 01:24:45,341
Exactly what she said.

1511
01:24:45,384 --> 01:24:46,690
We have to wait till Monday.

1512
01:24:46,733 --> 01:24:48,648
Longest weekend of my life.

1513
01:24:48,692 --> 01:24:50,824
You still have the
rest of the day.

1514
01:24:50,868 --> 01:24:52,739
Go to work, Dan.

1515
01:24:52,783 --> 01:24:53,610
Do you think I have a chance?

1516
01:24:53,653 --> 01:24:55,699
You have a good chance.

1517
01:24:55,742 --> 01:24:57,440

Have a nice weekend.

1518
01:24:57,483 --> 01:24:59,529

-Yeah.
