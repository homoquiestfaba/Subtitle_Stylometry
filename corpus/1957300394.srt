I have to tell you something.

[phone ringing]

11
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,328
It's gonna come out
soon enough anyway.

[ringing continues]

13
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:12,942
I want you to hear it from me.

14
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,645
I made a mistake.

15
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:30,438
[sighs]

16
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,531
I wanted to do the right thing.

17
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:48,151
I don't know what to do.
I'm so... I'm sorry.

-Hello.
-Hey, when are you coming home?

22
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,711
You know, I'm not...
I'm not sure.

23
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:28,409
I... gotta get this stuff done
before tomorrow.

24
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:31,368
So, you're not out drinking
with your work friends?

25
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:33,283
I'm at work.

26
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,590
[Nadia] Are you drinking?

27
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:37,374
No.

28
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,029
Okay, please don't.

29
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:43,293
[Nadia]
So, when are you coming home?

30
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:46,470
I don't know, um...
probably wouldn't wait up
for me though.

31
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,517
Sean, do you remember
that I'm ovulating?

32
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,172
Tonight?

33
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:53,912
[Nadia] That's on your calendar.

34
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:57,394
Sean?

35
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:05,794
Well, I gotta get
this stuff done, so...

36
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:07,535
Okay.

37
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:09,667
[Nadia] See you soon?

38
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:11,713
Okay.

39
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:14,411
Okay, yes.

40
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:17,675
You know what, I'll...
I'll be home in 30 minutes.

41
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:19,634
Okay.

42
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:20,809
Love you.

43
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:21,679
Mm-hmm.

00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:41,830
What are you doing?

49
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,527
I'm trying to help
your boys out.

00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:47,096
Karen said this is how
she and Steve got pregnant.

52
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:53,929
Right, right
and that's all this is.

53
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:57,062
Hey, where are you going?

54
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,239
[sighs]

55
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:00,588
I think I'm gonna head back in.

56
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,069
To work?

57
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,507
Yeah,
I got to get this stuff done.

58
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:10,815
So, you're just gonna screw me
and go?

59
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:16,734
[water running]

60
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:17,953
Seriously?

[birds chirping]

63
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:45,981
Which brings me
to social media, okay?
Watch what you post.

64
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,463
I don't want to see any red cups
or red eyes, alright?

65
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:52,379
If you're serious about landing
a position here
at the end of this internship,

66
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,032
you take this part serious.

67
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,339
The media would love to do
anything they can
to discredit us.

68
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:59,342
Excuse me.
Cole, sorry to interrupt,

69
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:02,563
but, uh, when you're done here,
will you see me in my office?

70
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:04,216
[Cole] Yeah, sure. Ten minutes.

71
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:07,132
-Are these the new interns?
-[Cole] Yes, sir.

72
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:09,613
Ripe and ready
for the world of politics.

73
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:13,661
[Robert]
Wow! Welcome to the team.
It's great to have you aboard.

74
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:15,706
I want to thank you in advance
for all the hard work,

75
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,013
I'm sure Cole's gonna be
throwing your way
in the next few days.

76
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:19,580
[Bruce] I understand that.

77
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:22,365
We all know the deadline
is not going to help me at all

78
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,802
because I have to have this done within 30 days.

79
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,414
Right. Thank you.

80
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:28,589
[thumps]

81
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:29,981
[sighs]

82
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,423
So, that went south in a hurry.
How behind am I?

83
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,816
You're supposed to have
a phone call with
Councilman Campbell at 02:00.

84
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,341
-Excuse me, senator.
I just thought...
-This is Councilman Campbell.

85
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,647
...it'd be best if I came in
and met with you face-to-face.

86
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,736
-And you can call me Robert.
-Alright Robert, let's walk.

87
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,610
Uh, okay, well,
thank you for meeting me today.

88
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:52,221
I wanted to talk to you
about Isaac's open senate seat.

89
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:54,354
[Robert] I feel like...
Like my strong record...

90
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,138
Robert,
you don't have a name yet.

91
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:58,532
You need a bill or a project
or something
to build your name up.

92
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:00,925
Well, I think that my experience
as councilman in...

93
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:02,884
How about this?

94
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:04,842
There's a renewable energy grant
I've been trying to land
for some time now,

95
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,670
but it seems dead in water.

96
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,759
It's a seed project
for wind energy
on the west side of the state.

97
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,195
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I remember that.

98
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,459
[Bruce] If you can push
that project through,

99
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:14,765
I'll make sure to bring
your name up to the rest
of the nominations committee.

100
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:18,421
But I'd like to sit down and
have a real discussion about...

101
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:20,684
Robert, I have to step
into this meeting.

102
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:23,513
The briefing on the project
will have all the information
you need to move forward.

103
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:27,169
Yeah, well.
Thank you, Bruce. Thank you.

00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,210
[Javier] Yeah, Santiago.

114
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:11,273
Santiago...

141
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,564
Hello, everyone.

142
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,872
Thank you all for inviting me
here today.

143
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,093
Thank you to the Ladies'
Auxiliary for the...

144
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:55,356
For the lovely decorations,
the fine food.

145
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,053
Uh...

146
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,230
-Hey.
-I need to share something
with you.

147
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:02,624
-Hi.
-I need to share something

148
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,844
that's difficult for me
to say...

149
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:07,759
I'm Ashlee.

150
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:09,500
Hey.

151
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:14,941
Usually people say
their name back,
maybe you should try it.

152
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:17,769
-That's cool.
-No, I'm sorry. I'm Javier.

153
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:20,772
Nice to meet you.

154
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,992
You too.

155
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:28,563
The future of this county is in
newer technology and innovation.

156
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:33,655
So, this... What are you doing
sulking back here in the corner?

157
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:38,007
Oh, uh, I work here, mostly with
the kids' program, but yeah.

158
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,271
And you don't approve
of this wind turbine project?

159
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:45,841
I mean, it's fine. I just...
I don't see how any of this has
to do with any of us, you know.

160
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:47,799
I mean, like,
why is this guy here?

161
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:48,931
To make himself look better?

162
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,324
Maybe he's here to help.

163
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,891
We don't need another
little project.

164
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,414
We need hands.

165
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:55,459
We need people to come here
and get their hands dirty.

166
00:14:56,634 --> 00:15:01,422
And the construction
of these wind turbines will be
our ticket to that future.

167
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:07,167
Thank you again
for inviting me here tonight.

168
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,344
Now, let's have some
of that pie, huh?

169
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:12,128

Hey.

174
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:31,582
What's up?

175
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:35,499
Is everything alright?

176
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:37,284
No.

177
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:42,332
[cries]

178
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,813
Oh, oh, it's gonna be alright.

179
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:46,423
Don't say that.

180
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,122

00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:37,819
You know, I asked this guy
to put together a darn near
impossible quote.

353
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:39,429
Like I never do that.

354
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:41,388
-[laughter]
-Uh, right, yeah.

355
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:45,653
Anyway Sean, it looks like
we're gonna be in the black
this summer

356
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:47,786
and that's because of you.

357
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,745
To Sean.

358
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,661
[glass clinking]

359
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:03,671
Hey, Don, I wanted to ask you
about a potential raise.

360
00:30:03,714 --> 00:30:06,195
-Sean.
-Look, I've been with the
company six months now and...

361
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:08,458
Sean, let me cut you off there.

362
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,940
You got some balls.

363
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:15,030
I like that.

364
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:16,510
Okay.

365
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:20,470
The turbine quote
came in at 20 million, right?

366
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:21,515
Yeah, that's right.

367
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:26,607
You shave another five percent
off of that,
I can't get you a raise,

368
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:28,870
but I can get you one hell
of a bonus.

369
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,829
[chuckles]

370
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:32,874
Alright, thanks.

371
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:40,403
[tranquil music playing]

372
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:42,623
[car horn honking]

373
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:46,757
But you can see,
uh, the projections show that

374
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:49,369
we are right on budget
for all three turbines

375
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:53,373
and we're really excited about
moving forward with the project.

376
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,288
Sounds great.

377
00:30:55,331 --> 00:31:01,294
Yeah, oh...
and I have the final draft
of the contract back from legal.

378
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,688
We're all set with the notary
for tomorrow?

379
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:06,168
Yep, she'll meet us
at the property.

380
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:12,827
[somber music playing]

381
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:21,836
Do you guys have any kids?

382
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,407
I know that is a weird question
to ask,

383
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,279
it's just that we're in that
process right now...

384
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:31,585
I have a son.

385
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,682
Any advice?

386
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:47,557
Be a good dad.

387
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:49,516
[sighs]

388
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:00,527
You only have one shot
at being a good dad.

389
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:02,703
It's easy to mess up.

390
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:15,368
It seems like you have
a good head on your shoulders,
so you'll be alright.

391
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:20,329
Thanks.

392
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:23,680
The rest of this is pretty
standard, looks good.

393
00:32:24,768 --> 00:32:27,858
Everybody here at Wescott's
doing a great job,
I appreciate that.

394
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:30,122
Let's just make sure we get
that signature tomorrow.

395
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:31,993
And we can start building
right away.

396
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:33,995
Absolutely. I don't see
why that should be a problem.

397
00:32:35,127 --> 00:32:38,478
-We'll do our best for you.
-Alright. I appreciate that.

[ominous music playing]

403
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:34,637
Hello. We were just at the house
on the corner.
No one was there.

404
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:36,813
Uh, are you the owner
of this property?

405
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:37,901

Counselor Campbell?

408
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:56,893
No.

409
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,194
[sighs]

410
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,239
I'm sorry, ma'am.

411
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:45,638
The state sets the price
for the leasing of the
properties in this project.

412
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:46,508
[sighs]

413
00:36:55,909 --> 00:36:57,780
-She wants us to leave.
-10,000 dollars.

414
00:36:57,824 --> 00:37:00,261
Tell her we'll give her
10 grand today

415
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:03,656
and we'll pay her 3%
of the profits annually.

416
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:05,962
You know we don't have that
in the budget.

417
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:07,877
I will approve any overage
just tell her.

418
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:27,375

[tranquil music playing]

422
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:09,852
[Sean] Well, what about here?
Line 44, page 3.

423
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:13,595
Chockfast grout is the minimum
requirement on this.

424
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:17,991
Well, you know, we got to find
a way to cut the cost of it
or it's not gonna happen at all.

425
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:19,384
You don't want to do it
like that.

426
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:21,386
Going with the low-grade grout
as your sealant

427
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:23,692
will definitely sacrifice
structural integrity
of the turbines.

428
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:26,391
We're sticking
with manufacturer recommendation
on this one.

429
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:29,785
We use cosmetic grout
on our buildings all the time
and they don't fall over.

430
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:33,093
This isn't an office building.
You're gonna sacrifice
the structural integrity.

431
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:35,530
Well, do we have
any legal restrictions
by going with the cosmetics?

432
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:37,532
That's not the direction
you want to go on this one.

433
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:39,099
Maybe you're still
inside a code,

434
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:41,536
but with a foreign manufacturer
it's really hard to tell.

435
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,233
I want the cheaper grout, okay?

436
00:38:43,277 --> 00:38:45,061
I want to see a new quote
with the cosmetic.

437
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:48,108
[man 1] We're not going with lower than recommendations.

438
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:52,025
There's too much risk for us
and any respectable contractor
will tell you the same thing.

439
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:58,901
[tranquil music playing]

440

Don't point. It's embarrassing.

00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:09,825
No, look at him.
He's wearing two polo shirts.

443
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:11,174
Wow, you're really drunk
already.

444
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:13,655
[laughing]

445
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:14,569
[clears throat]

446
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:15,701
You wish.

447
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:16,571
[chuckles]

448
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:21,315
Javier, what are we doing here?

449
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:27,321
Uh, just hanging out.

450
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:31,412
I mean, what are we doing,
like you and me?

451
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:37,026
-Um...
-These last few weeks
have been really fun

452
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,988
and I mean, I'm probably
getting this job here

453
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:45,208
and you're going away
in the fall probably.

454
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:46,688
Well, that might not happen.

455
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:48,342
I don't want you to change
your plans for me.

456
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,605
It's... It's just I don't have
enough money to go yet.

457
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:54,827
Then I have some good news
about that.

458
00:39:57,133 --> 00:40:02,095
I've found a scholarship for you
and I've submitted your name
and they're gonna call you.

459
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:03,401
Why would you do that?

460
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:07,492
You're mad about this?

461
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:09,363
I... I told you that I...

462
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:11,191
[sighs]

463
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,238
I want to earn this money
on my own.

464
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:18,111
I don't want to go to school
until I made enough money.

465
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:20,418
Yeah, this helps you
get to that point.

466
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:24,334
-That's what a scholarship does.
-I don't want a handout.
I work for what I have.

467
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:28,338
And you're saying I don't?

468
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:32,734
[applause]

469
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:42,483

00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:45,051
[bee buzzing]

471
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:46,879
I thought it must have been
a mistake

472
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:50,186
because all the forms
said 30 bags,
so I signed for the receipt.

473
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,232
Mm-hmm.

474
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:54,190
I mean, there's no way
this project would take
more than three bags to finish.

475
00:40:54,669 --> 00:40:58,847
I mean... I mean...
and you got... the forms said
30 bags, you know.

476
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:00,414
Oh, yeah,
you did the right thing.

477
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,024
-So, I signed for it.
-It's no big deal.

478
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:04,418
I... It's probably my mistake
if I just ordered too much.

479
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,594
There's enough here to do
about nine more bathrooms.

480
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:07,639

482
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:11,381
Something like that.

[car door closes]

488
00:42:28,502 --> 00:42:32,245
People of Kent County,
not even two months ago,

489
00:42:32,288 --> 00:42:35,988
we took our first steps
towards clean renewable energy

490
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:39,774
for finding a new way
to power ourselves
through the 21st century

491
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:42,342
when we broke ground
on what we had hoped

492
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:46,302
to be the first of many wind
turbine farms in this county.

493
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:52,961
So, working with the original
twenty million-dollar bid
when we began the project,

494
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:57,313
I factored in the savings
from materials and labor

495
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:59,185
and now that the project
is complete,

496
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:05,757
I can say that the actual cost
came to just over
18 million dollars.

497
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:10,283
[Bruce] What we celebrate today

498
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:13,721
is the accomplishment
of many dedicated people

499
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:18,857
working tirelessly and viciously
toward one unified goal,

500
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,903
the sustainability
of our future.

501
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:24,602
I don't understand.
You saved 10% off our bid?

502
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:27,909
I... Yeah, you know,
I just, uh, you know,

503
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:29,215
put the squeeze
in some of the vendors,

504
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:30,825
made sure they were giving us
the best price,

505
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:32,261
and made sure the subs
weren't ripping us off.

506
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:34,263
Do you have a specified
cost breakdown?

507
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:36,396
I'm confused as to where...

508
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:38,528
I'm just happy that you had
the stones to play hardball
with those guys, Sean.

509
00:43:38,572 --> 00:43:40,661
You made the firm
a lot of money.

510
00:43:41,314 --> 00:43:42,141
Thank you.

511
00:43:43,446 --> 00:43:46,058
[Bruce] ...the sustainability
of our future.

512
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:51,106
And one of those hard-working
public servants has been
your own councilman,

513
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,238
Robert Campbell.

514
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:53,152

[eerie music playing]

517
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:09,821
Hey, hey.

518
00:44:09,864 --> 00:44:11,213
You're gonna do great today,
okay?

519
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:18,046
How about you bring me lunch
after your interview
and we can talk about it?

520
00:44:22,224 --> 00:44:23,661
They're gonna love you.

521
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:25,837
From the description
on the application,

522
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,708
it sounds like they're looking
for somebody just like you.

523
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:32,539
-I don't even want this.
-Javi, this is what people do
to go to school.

524
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:35,629
-You... I don't know what to say
in a scholarship interview.
-Just talk about yourself.

525
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,936
-You need to do this.
-I don't need to do this.

526
00:44:38,937 --> 00:44:40,503
Do you even want
to go to school?

527
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:43,898
That's not fair.

528
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:46,771
You're... You're all talk.

529
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:50,513
You can't just stand around
and wait for life to happen.

530
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:52,080
You have to do something.

531
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:55,170
-Okay?
-Alright, back off, Mom.

532
00:44:55,954 --> 00:44:56,998
Grow up!

533
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:59,435
[footsteps thumping]

534
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:08,749
And how long has this project
been in development?

535
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,664
Well, this is the first stage
of the development.

536
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,927
We just started this project
only about four months ago.

537
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:14,407
-We had some federal funding...
-Excuse me.

538
00:45:15,234 --> 00:45:17,149
Excuse me.

539
00:45:17,192 --> 00:45:19,934
-Are you responsible for these?
-Yeah, this is my project.
Robert Campbell.

540
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:22,937
You should have taken
a community vote to find out
what the people wanted.

541
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:26,593
Well, listen. We did invite
the people to call in
if they had any problems.

542
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:29,422
-In a democracy, it's the
people's vote that count.
-I'm sorry.

543
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:32,642
Senator Peterson,
I'm just so grateful that you
were able to make it out today.

544
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:35,123
I'm grateful for the wonderful
weather too, huh?

545
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:37,996
Well, I gotta hand it to you,
Robert,
this is certainly impressive.

546
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:41,869
Well, it's a month early and...
And right under budget, huh?

547
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:43,958
Well, the people in the Capitol
are very pleased.

548
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:47,570
Listen, we've got
some federal money coming down
the pipe, maybe 50 turbines.

549
00:45:48,093 --> 00:45:50,443
Well, that's exactly
what this county needs,

550
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:53,315
but I was hoping to step
into that open senate seat.

551
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:56,492
Well, certainly.
Let's set up a meeting
in the next couple weeks.

552
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:58,756
-We could talk about it.
-Well, I was thinking
that it would be best

553
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:00,758
if we took advantage
of all the press

554
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,890
that we're getting here
on this turbine project
and announce it right away.

555
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:05,806
Well, Robert, you've certainly
done some great things out here

556
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,766
and I can safely say,
your name is on the short list,

557
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:10,811
but the committee
will still need to vet you

558
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:12,639
and run some background
searches.

559
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:14,728
-Sure.
-You could probably look
for a call from them.

560
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:15,990
-Alright.
-Okay?

561
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:17,644
Yeah, sure.
That's, uh, that sounds great...

562
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,254
That sounds great.

563
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:22,997
Listen, I'm looking forward
to working with you, senator.

564
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:23,911
Alright.

565
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:28,307
[car beeping]

566
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:30,222
Drive safe, huh.

567
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:36,097
[eerie music playing]

568
00:46:40,449 --> 00:46:41,363
Mm-hm.

569
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:47,195
-Is there a second page?
-I'm... Yeah, yeah, no.

570
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:49,458
As it's... That's it.

571
00:46:49,502 --> 00:46:53,549
Okay. Well, your transcripts
aren't included
in your application.

572
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:55,073
Did you bring them
with you today?

573
00:46:56,117 --> 00:47:00,513
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware
that I should have brought them.

574
00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:04,082
Javier, we do want to help
the Latino community,

575
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:06,954
but I need you to make an effort
here in this interview.

576
00:47:06,998 --> 00:47:09,304
I didn't know
that I was supposed to bring
my transcripts.

577
00:47:09,348 --> 00:47:12,307
Why don't you tell me
why you think you're qualified
for this scholarship?

578
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:19,140
I work at the community center
in Hart with the Latino kids.

579
00:47:20,315 --> 00:47:23,318
Uh, I want to go to school.

580
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,060
Okay.

581
00:47:26,104 --> 00:47:28,367
-Well, thank you for your time.
-That's it?

582
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:31,283
-Javier, I'll be in touch.
-It's Javier.

583
00:47:31,326 --> 00:47:35,504
Javier, I'll be in touch
regarding the results
of the scholarship.

584
00:47:47,212 --> 00:47:50,868
So, how'd it go?

585
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:53,000
He was so impressed,

586
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:56,308
he pretty much offered me
the seat right on the spot.

587
00:47:57,048 --> 00:47:58,614
You're the party's
official nominee?

588
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:00,486
Well, it's not official
till we announce it,

589
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:02,618
which is why I think
that we should strike
while the iron's hot

590
00:48:02,662 --> 00:48:04,403
and set up a press conference
for this afternoon.

591
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:08,059
Wait, hold on, Bob.
I think you need
to slow down, okay?

592
00:48:08,102 --> 00:48:10,496
This is the party's political
machine now.

593
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:12,454
They're gonna want to run
this through the Capitol,

594
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:13,368
-the press release is not
going to get anything...
-Listen, I don't think

595
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,805
that you are hearing me, Cole.

596
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:17,807
We are going to announce today.

597
00:48:17,851 --> 00:48:22,290
They don't just offer
the state senate seat
to the nicest guy in the room.

598
00:48:23,074 --> 00:48:24,292
We've got to attack this.

599
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,816
We're building a name here.

600
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,209
Hey, Sean, Sean.

601
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:29,950
I want you to set up
a press conference at 3 p.m.

602
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:32,910
Come here, come here.
Hey, listen,
you did a great job.

603
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:33,911
[Robert] I appreciate it.

604
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:34,912
[Sean] Thank you.

605
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:40,787
[somber music playing]

606
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:18,433
[truck rumbling]

607
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:25,353
[grunts]

608
00:49:27,877 --> 00:49:29,444
-Oh, I can help you with that.
-I got it.

609
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:34,406
-[sighs]
-I got you lunch.

610
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:35,276
Thank you.

611
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:39,019
You okay?

612
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:40,673
[sighs]

613
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:42,675
[coughs]

614
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:46,635
[plastic rasps]

615
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:48,507
Here is your salad.

616
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:57,385
-So, did you go
to your interview?
-Yeah.

617
00:49:59,822 --> 00:50:02,651
-How'd it go?
-Shitty.

618
00:50:08,657 --> 00:50:09,571
What happened?

619
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:13,401
I didn't bring my transcripts.

620
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:16,013
That's it?

621
00:50:17,797 --> 00:50:20,278
-[Javier] Yeah, I mean...
-[Ashlee] Did you try? Like...

622
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:21,192
Yeah, I went.

623
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:22,715
That's... That's not trying.

624
00:50:23,368 --> 00:50:25,152
You forgot your transcripts.

625
00:50:25,196 --> 00:50:27,111
Well, yeah.
I didn't know I was supposed
to bring them.

626
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:30,636
Javier, it's on the form.

627
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:33,900
Well, I didn't see that.

628
00:50:34,814 --> 00:50:36,120
You didn't read it?

629
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:42,604
Why do you always do this?

630
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,570
-I can't do this. This...
-What?

631
00:50:54,877 --> 00:51:01,101
I can't... I can't...
I can't be with someone who...

632
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,016
[Javier] What are you saying?

633
00:51:05,975 --> 00:51:06,976
I have to go.

634
00:51:08,456 --> 00:51:10,328
-Wait, wait, wait, Ashlee.
Oh, hey.
-You know what?

635
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:12,286
Actually, I have to get to work,
so I'm going to go.

636
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:14,375
No, are you seriously thinking
about breaking up with me
because of this?

637
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:17,422
-I'll talk to you later, bye.
-I can send the forms
if that's all this is.

638
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:26,170
[somber music playing]

639
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:29,216
[somber music playing]

640
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:44,275
[Javier] Mama!

641
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:45,145
[door bangs close]

642
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:46,886
Mama!

643
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:55,938
Mama!

644
00:51:58,376 --> 00:52:02,554
[somber music playing]

645
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:18,700
Uh, so, I thought after
the candidacy announcement, um,

646
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:20,746
we could cover
your educational platform,

647
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:24,271
then let them bring up jobs
which takes you
into renewable energy.

648
00:52:27,622 --> 00:52:28,449
You alright?

649
00:52:29,581 --> 00:52:31,278
Uh, yeah.
I'm so... I'm sorry, um...

650
00:52:33,976 --> 00:52:36,588
-Want me to get you some water?
-Just some personal stuff.
It's...

651
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:38,720
Mama!

652
00:52:42,724 --> 00:52:43,899
Okay.

653
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:48,643
[thunder roars]

654
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:54,301
Okay, I won't pry.

655
00:53:00,655 --> 00:53:01,482
How do you...

656
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:07,793
How do you tell somebody
to grow up
and take their life seriously?

657
00:53:11,405 --> 00:53:12,276
[sighs]

658
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,190
I don't.

659
00:53:15,017 --> 00:53:16,497
[Robert] That's something they
have to choose for themselves

660
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:20,371
and if they choose
to just sit around

661
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:22,982
and wait for life to start
then I walk away.

662
00:53:23,025 --> 00:53:25,463
I can't be bothered
with people like that.

663
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:28,074
-But what if...
-[door opens]

664
00:53:28,727 --> 00:53:31,469
Ma'am.
Ma'am, you can't just barge in.

665
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:34,950
-Sir, I'm very sorry.
-No, Mary it's fine. Thank you.

666
00:53:34,994 --> 00:53:37,214
Ashlee,
we'll have to finish this later.

667
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:39,433
-Do you want me to stay
and translate?
-No, we'll finish this later.

668
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:41,435
Ashlee!

669
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:52,446
Sorry.

670
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,499
You know I can't understand you.
Please slow down.

671
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:15,164
[sighs]

672
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:18,907
I can't...
I can't legally pay you.

673
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:26,088
I let you and Javier live there.
I own the farm.

674
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:27,655
Let me live there?

675
00:54:33,008 --> 00:54:34,053
No, you...

676
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:41,278
I let you and Javier stay there
because you need a home,
that's all.

677
00:54:46,892 --> 00:54:48,285
I want to work something out
with you.

678
00:54:48,328 --> 00:54:49,634
Stay away from us.

679
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:55,814
[Reyna] This is why Javier
doesn't know about you.

680
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:02,299
He doesn't know about you.
I never gave him the letters.
This is why.

681
00:55:07,478 --> 00:55:09,915
You stupid bitch!
You can't keep my son from me.

682
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:11,090
I gave you everything.

683
00:55:12,787 --> 00:55:14,920
You wouldn't have a roof
over your head

684
00:55:14,963 --> 00:55:17,314
if I hadn't bought that farm
for my son twenty years ago.

685
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:29,326
I can go to the news
about Javier.

686
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:38,030
I will call immigration
on that whole farm

687
00:55:38,073 --> 00:55:39,901
if you are still there
in the morning.

688
00:55:39,945 --> 00:55:44,558
Excuse me, sir,
I've held them off as long
as I could but it's 3:15.

689
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:47,344
-What?
-The press, sir.

690
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:49,868
Oh.

[clears throat]

694
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:22,727
Sir, please reconsider.

695
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:25,425
We could still make this about
the turbine project
if you just hold...

696
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:27,427
[microphone feedbacks]

697
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,037
Thank you, all,
for coming today.

698
00:56:30,952 --> 00:56:32,258
As you all know,

699
00:56:33,738 --> 00:56:35,566
we have officially opened

700
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:38,525
the first three turbines
on this side of the state.

701
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:43,487
We have officially opened
the first three turbines
on this side of the state

702
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,010
earlier today in Hart.

703

[clears throat]

704
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:52,583
Uh, I have...
I'd like to announce
my candidacy for state senate.

705
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:55,629
There's work to be done

706
00:56:55,673 --> 00:56:58,806
and I've proven
that I'm the man to do it, so.

707
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:02,027
What's your plan
for increasing jobs statewide?

708
00:57:02,593 --> 00:57:05,160
Well, thank you
for bringing that up.

709
00:57:05,204 --> 00:57:09,687
Over the past few months,
I've worked hard to build...

710
00:57:10,818 --> 00:57:13,342
Over the past few months,
I've worked hard...

711
00:57:13,386 --> 00:57:14,300
I'm sorry.

717
00:58:05,743 --> 00:58:09,747
Hey, what are you doing here?

718
00:58:10,922 --> 00:58:12,314
I have something to tell you...

719
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:14,447
-Yeah.
-...in person.

720
00:58:16,754 --> 00:58:17,581
What?

721
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:18,930
You alright?

722
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:20,758
Yeah.

723
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:24,065
[Nadia]
I think we have to cancel
our spring vacation though.

724
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:27,199
[Sean] What? Why?

725
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:30,463
[Nadia] Because I don't think
you can fly when you're
eight months pregnant.

726
00:58:31,856 --> 00:58:33,510
Wait, what?

727
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,555
I'm pregnant.

728
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:40,604
[chuckles] How do you even know?

729
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:41,953
It's called a pregnancy test,
Sean.

730
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:45,957
We're adopting.

731
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,002
We haven't even been trying.

732
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:52,224
I...

733
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:54,618
I just don't want you to get
your hopes up again.

734
00:58:54,661 --> 00:58:56,445
I know I'm pregnant.

735
00:58:56,489 --> 00:58:59,536
I've been not pregnant
enough times
to know when it feels different.

736
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:00,841
[scoffs]

737
00:59:00,885 --> 00:59:03,975
-We're having a baby.
-Okay, stop. Alright?

738
00:59:04,018 --> 00:59:06,543
Look, it is just way too soon
to even know that, right?

739
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:08,283
At least until next week
at the earliest.

740
00:59:08,327 --> 00:59:11,069
[scoffs]
Or we can go do a test right now

741
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,725
and then you can apologize
to me.

742
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:18,293
There's an urgent care in town.

743
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:23,385

00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:52,197
-Not now, Ashlee.
-I know what's going on.

749
00:59:53,415 --> 00:59:55,113
-What are you talking about?
-You own the farm.

750
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:58,507
You used tax dollars
to lease your own land?

751
00:59:58,551 --> 00:59:59,770
Is that why we made
such a generous offer?

752
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:01,685
-Listen, Ashlee.
-No, you listen.

753
01:00:01,728 --> 01:00:05,123
I have an email right here
that explains everything
to the press.

754
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,343
Give me one reason
not to send it.

755
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,607
[sighs]

756
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,347
The farmer is getting the money.

757
01:00:13,218 --> 01:00:14,132
That's not true.

758
01:00:15,437 --> 01:00:17,222
-I talked to her son.
-Well, that's not the...

759
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:19,093
-The arrangement
that I made with them.
-I'm going to go warn Reyna

760
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:20,704
and then I'm gonna send
this email.

761
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:22,488
-Do not do that.
-This is wrong, Robert.

762
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:25,491
-This isn't right.
-This isn't about me, Ashlee.

763

764
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:31,236

It means that you're not being
yourself lately

and you're acting
like a crazy...

I knew it.

829
01:07:54,896 --> 01:07:56,463
I knew you didn't really want
this baby.

830

That's not what I'm saying.

831
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:00,206
Do you have any idea what I've
done even to get us this far?

832

You're not telling me the truth
and I wish you would stop
sparing my feelings

what the hell you want.

01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:45,062
That's not why I'm here.

870
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:49,283
I've worked here 20 years.

871
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,591
You're not gonna take it away
from me.

872
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:56,726
Reyna, things got a little
out of hand yesterday.

873
01:15:56,769 --> 01:16:00,381
I think we both said some
things that... That we regret.

874
01:16:02,775 --> 01:16:03,907
I'm sorry.

875
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,051
I should have...

876
01:16:18,095 --> 01:16:19,836
I should have given you
the farm. Look, I...

877
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:23,796
I brought the deed.
I want you to have it
for real this time.

878
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,406
You don't want me to go?

879
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:29,628
You made this place what it is,
you deserve it.

880
01:16:29,672 --> 01:16:30,542
No.

881
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:40,378
I don't understand.

882
01:16:59,571 --> 01:17:00,398
I am sorry.

883
01:17:07,971 --> 01:17:08,841
[door bangs close]

884
01:17:08,885 --> 01:17:11,148
[sighs]

885
01:17:14,804 --> 01:17:16,240
[whimpers]

886
01:17:22,855 --> 01:17:25,858
[somber music playing]

887
01:18:51,248 --> 01:18:52,466
Sean.

888
01:18:57,689 --> 01:18:59,169
Come on, talk to me.

889
01:19:02,433 --> 01:19:03,260
I'm done.

890
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:09,179
Honey, don't do this.

891
01:19:09,222 --> 01:19:10,397
I killed that girl.

892
01:19:11,703 --> 01:19:13,792
It's my responsibility.
It was my fault.

893
01:19:13,836 --> 01:19:18,536
No, we're your responsibility.
Honey, just come home.

894
01:19:22,018 --> 01:19:23,062
I can't do that right now.

895
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:27,371
Damn it, don't do this.

896
01:19:27,414 --> 01:19:28,372
Just leave.

897
01:19:51,221 --> 01:19:52,048
[door closes]

898
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:07,585
[dogs barking]

899
01:20:31,435 --> 01:20:32,262
Javier.

900
01:21:23,966 --> 01:21:26,925
