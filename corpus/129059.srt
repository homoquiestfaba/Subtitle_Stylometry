1
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:35,163
That's-- That's close
enough, Miss Clifton.

2
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,134
She left them to me.

3
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:42,297
-They're mine.
-That's for the court to decide.

4
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,137
Your stepfather's challenge
is for your own good.

5
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,438
They're worth millions, Marie.

6
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:51,106
Do you really think you're ready
for that kind of responsibility?

7
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,353
You are not gonna
get away with this.

8
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,166
Sorry.

9
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,362
No shit.

10
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,843
Testing. Testing.

11
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:58,279
Who is he to say you're not
responsible enough for the diamonds?

12
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,419
He goes through money
like water.

13
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,454
You're 1 8 tomorrow.
If you wanna get what's yours...

14
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,683
...you'll have to play him
at his own game. Get a lawyer.

15
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,760
With what?
Lawyers cost money.

16
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,726
If you win, you'll have shitloads.

17
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,388
You don't know Jay.

18
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,329
He wants those diamonds.

19
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,528
And he would rather go broke
challenging my mother's will...

20
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,639
...than give me what's mine.

21
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:24,575
Students,
as spring break approaches...

22
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:29,772
...we are once again forced to tackle
the subject of sex education.

23
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,487
Dr. Johnson and Miss Richards...

24
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,459
...have graciously agreed to take
time out of their busy schedules...

25
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,063
...to meet with us today.

26
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,530
Dr. Johnson runs the forensic lab...

27
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,034
...at the police department.

28
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,139
Doctor.

29
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,676
Good morning.
We're here today to--

30
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,339
-He's hot.
-Yeah.

31
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:08,452
National studies report that
sexual activity among students...

32
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,112
...is at an all-time high.

33
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,417
This is no laughing matter.

34
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:19,361
Reports of unwanted pregnancies
are up by 1 6 percent.

35
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,126
What's that thing
on the skank's leg?

36
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,100
I don't know. Somebody said
she's under juvie detention.

37
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,136
Figures.

38
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,504
--reports of sexual assaults.
Miss Richards is here today...

39
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:35,580
...to talk to you about her own
harrowing personal experience.

40
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,414
Good morning.
My name is Kristen Richards...

41
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:45,524
...officer in the Juvenile Department
of Corrections here in Blue Bay...

42
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,126
...as some of you may already know.

43
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,421
But that's not
what brings me here today.

44
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,293
Back in high school...

45
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,861
...all I wanted to do was party.

46
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,438
By junior year...

47
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,513
...my life had become a blur
of alcohol, drugs...

48
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,479
-...and anonymous sex.
-Whore!

49
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,848
Then one night at
a spring-break party in Miami...

50
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,585
...someone slipped a roofie
in my drink...

51
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,662
-...and raped me.
-Oh, shit.

52
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,197
Not a day goes by
when my skin doesn't crawl...

53
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:31,428
...when I think of the pain
and humiliation.

54
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,273
I was never able to make
a positive ID on the guy that raped me.

55
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,814
All I can remember
was him whispering in my ear:

56
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,144
''You won't remember...

57
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,620
...but you'll never forget.''

58
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,563
<i>Now on the platform,</i>
<i>from Blue Bay High...</i>

59
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,639
<i>...for her second dive</i>
<i>in the final round...</i>

60
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,537
<i>...Marie Clifton.</i>

61
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,005
<i>Quiet, please.</i>

62
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,188
<i>The judges' scores are</i>--

63
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,690
Hey! That's more like it!

64
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,159
--<i>nine-eight, nine-seven...</i>

65
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,165
<i>...nine-nine, nine-nine...</i>

66
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,237
<i>...nine-eight. Overall</i>--

67
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,703
Nice takeoff.
You gotta work on your landing.

68
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:45,503
That was near-perfect.
I can't do any better than that.

69
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,340
Oh, now, there's
no such word as ''can't.''

70
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,072
<i>Now on the platform...</i>

71
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:54,709
<i>...from Lambert High, Adele Moray.</i>

72
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,896
-Thanks, babe.
-He's got nerve showing up...

73
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:10,934
...playing the loving stepfather
after all he put you through.

74
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,432
Why aren't you out there?

75
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,843
Are you kidding me?

76
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,978
He wouldn't miss this
for the world.

77
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,807
He's in his element.

78
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,381
It's a sport for rich girls.

79
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,279
Something I'm not.

80
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,046
-So you fold towels.
-I need a job.

81
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,157
It's part of my probation.

82
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,953
So you're a bad girl?

83
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,959
I was.

84
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,760
How bad?

85
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,435
Long story.
I'd rather not get into it.

86
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,072
<i>Quiet, please.</i>

87
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,539
<i>Now on the platform,</i>
<i>for her third and final dive...</i>

88
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,372
<i>...Marie Clifton of Blue Bay High.</i>

89
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,833
Listen, why don't you call me...

90
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,909
...and we'll see what we can do
about getting you a real job.

91
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:28,205
Better yet, talk to me later
at Marie's party.

92
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,973
I wasn't invited.

93
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,014
You are now.

94
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,102
Happy birthday.

95
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,940
They're not diamonds, but...,

96
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,547
Thanks.

97
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,880
He give you his present yet?

98
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,521
No.

99
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,589
You never know.

100
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:15,989
He could do the right thing. Cut the
bullshit, give you your inheritance.

101
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,857
Over his dead body.

102
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,213
Oh, hi, Mr. Clifton.

103
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,750
Rad party, Mr. Clifton.

104
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:50,084
<i>Coño</i>, who is this guy?

105
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,298
Awesome party.

106
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,096
Not much of a consolation prize.

107
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,899
Cheer up.
You got the pick of the litter here.

108
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,564
Just grab one and have some fun.

109
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,448
No. You know, I think
I'm gonna go talk to Jay.

110
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,516
-Hey, Marie! Time for a birthday swim!
-No, no, no!

111
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,737
It can't be done.

112
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,279
In construction
there's always delays.

113
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,816
Four months is not a delay.
It's a fucking disaster.

114
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,783
The building is almost finished.

115
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,082
I give you my word!

116
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,124
Every week the building
is unfinished, we take a finger.

117
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:58,020
Pray, Mr. Clifford, that you finish
before the 1 1 th week.

118
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,655
-Oh, God, please--
-The building is finished or you are.

119
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,868
-Who were those men?
-What happened to you?

120
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:15,207
Nothing. What is that?
What happened? Jay.

121
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,815
Hey, don't bogart it.

122
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,377
Are you okay?
What happened?

123
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,921
Don't worry about it.

124
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,992
Who invited the towel girl?

125
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,261
This is a private party, bitch.
You're not invited.

126
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,764
Your stepfather invited--

127
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,096
If you're smart,
you'll stay away from him.

128
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,864
-I don't want any trouble.
-But you're not smart.

129
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,031
Stay away from him.

130
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,380
Bitch!

131
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:00,020
That's enough! Stop it!

132
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:06,230
-It's my party and I didn't invite her.
-I did.

133
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,862
My apologies. My stepdaughter
continues to prove...

134
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,665
...how immature she really is.

135
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,502
My stepfather continues to prove
what an asshole he really is.

136
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,912
Little young, don't you think?

137
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,912
Party's over.

138
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,265
This place is amazing, Mr. Clifton.

139
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,102
Well, it will be when it's finished.

140
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,913
Are you okay?

141
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,559
Yeah. I'm fine.

142
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,927
Marie didn't hurt you, did she?

143
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,898
No.

144
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,368
You sure you don't want to
get out of those wet clothes?

145
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,587
Jay! Late night?

146
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,159
Okay, look. I was a bitch.

147
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:54,602
I know. I'm sorry.
I just thought, you know, that you....

148
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,574
I was hoping you just kind of
had a special present for me.

149
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,939
The party was your present.

150
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,983
What more
could you possibly want?

151
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,949
You know what I want.

152
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,247
This conversation is over.

153
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,014
Nothing's over.

154
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,523
Mr. Clifton?

155
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,524
Yes, officer. Can I help you?

156
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:21,299
It's ''detective.'' And you're under
arrest for suspicion of rape.

157
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,231
-There's gotta be a mistake.
-No, no mistake.

158
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,804
-You have the right to remain silent.
-What are you doing?

159
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:32,467
Hey, come on, now. I didn't--
I didn't do anything!

160
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,273
Jay! Jay.

161
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:39,281
Call my lawyer.
Hey, watch the hair!

162
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,716
Let's go over it again.

163
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,288
It was Mr. Clifton.

164
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,729
-What's Kristen Richards doing there?
-Victim's probation officer.

165
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,634
He raped me.

166
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,434
Can I talk to you for a second?

167
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,690
She one of yours?

168
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,285
Did you miss me?

169
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,792
Yeah.

170
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,094
Possession with intent to sell.

171
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,832
She was holding for her boyfriend,
ended up taking the rap for him.

172
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,067
She know what she's getting into?

173
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,337
She was raped, Michael.

174
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,645
How's your wife?

175
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,012
She's doing just fine.

176
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,279
We're getting divorced.

177
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,913
I told you, it's bullshit.
I didn't lay a hand on this girl.

178
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,061
We're taking her statement.
We'll run forensic tests.

179
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,696
-Thank you, detective.
-She's lying.

180
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,129
If that's the case,
you'll be out of here by tonight.

181
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:16,312
Do you understand the seriousness
of these charges, young lady?

182
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,547
There's a battery of forensic tests.
They're not pleasant.

183
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,853
There's gonna be
a background check.

184
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,988
You're gonna have to testify in court,
face the man that you're accusing.

185
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,165
You think I'm lying.

186
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,151
Jay Clifton's an influential man
here in Blue Bay.

187
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,519
Not the kind of guy to mess with
if you're not willing to go the distance.

188
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,827
Miss Sandoval, I'm Dr. Johnson.

189
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,658
This is my assistant, Julie.

190
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:10,996
Whenever you're ready, we'll need
a urine sample for the rape test kit.

191
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:17,131
If you'll remove your clothes,
we need to do a physical exam.

192
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,243
I'll wait outside.

193
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,179
Dr. Johnson. You have to see this.

194
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:33,252
Those are clear evidence markers.
The camera, please.

195
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,093
Thank you.

196
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,307
Hey. How are you doing?

197
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,852
What's up, boys?

198
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,656
-Detective.
-Doctor.

199
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,763
Here to see where all
the real work happens?

200
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,698
What you got?

201
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,101
You're not supposed
to be here, Kristen.

202
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,037
I thought you could use a little help.

203
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,576
-How long you known this girl?
-She was assigned to me months ago.

204
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,611
In foster care most of her life.

205
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,478
So you buy the whole story?
The rape?

206
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,312
Yeah.

207
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,921
Yeah, I do.

208
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,884
Something in the eyes.

209
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,696
I've had a little experience,
remember?

210
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,236
-Gotcha.
-What have you got?

211
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,208
Well, we have got prints.

212
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,685
The Holy Grail.

213
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,077
-Good morning, doctor.
-Good morning.

214
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,479
Dr. Johnson, do your tests show...

215
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,311
...that Elena Sandoval
had sexual intercourse...

216
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,215
...on the night of the 25th?

217
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,615
Yes, they do.

218
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,814
And would you
describe your findings...

219
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:50,052
...as being conclusive
with forced penetration?

220
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:54,461
Absolutely. There was
extensive bruising and tearing.

221
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,964
We found no semen...

222
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,104
...but latex abrasions
point to the use of protection.

223
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,303
This is quite common
in cases of premeditated rape.

224
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,875
What could you tell us about
Miss Sandoval's toxicology reports?

225
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:09,377
Positive ingestion of Rohypnol,
a common date-rape drug.

226
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:14,148
Would you care to explain state's
exhibit number one, please, doctor?

227
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,753
Yes. Miss Sandoval's body...

228
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,789
...was found to have a bite mark
on her upper torso.

229
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,425
Excuse me, Dr. Johnson.

230
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,687
Can you tell me about
the other markings towards the side?

231
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,859
I wasn't able to determine
the exact nature of those.

232
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,627
Fingernail markings, possibly.

233
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,737
Thank you.

234
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:37,841
Were you able to draw conclusions
from analysis of these teeth marks?

235
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,468
The tests I conducted show that
there's simply no other conclusion.

236
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:46,949
The bite marks on her body
were caused by the defendant...

237
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,087
...Mr. Jay Clifton.

238
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,284
Put that down.

239
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,848
-I was just--
-Yeah.

240
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,150
I don't know
what you're trying to do...

241
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,887
...but you're not gonna get
a dime from my stepfather.

242
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,554
-He's up to his ass in debt.
-He attacked me.

243
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,757
With no help from you, I'm sure.

244
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,073
Bye-bye.

245
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,610
Fucking slut.

246
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,853
Oh, crap.

247
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,046
Need some sugar?

248
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,522
Bachelor's dinner.

249
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,926
I just wanted a snack, you know?

250
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,829
So, what are you
still doing here?

251
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,334
Shouldn't you be back
at probation office?

252
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,495
Oh, I took some time off.

253
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,073
-You did, huh?
-Yeah.

254
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,937
What's that?

255
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,740
I don't know.

256
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,646
Let's take a look at it.

257
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,812
-<i>Why aren't you out there?</i>
-<i>It's a sport for rich girls.</i>

258
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,821
-He looks interested.
-<i>Something I'm not.</i>

259
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,688
-He does, doesn't he?
-Yeah.

260
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,955
Who sent this to you?

261
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,965
It seems the assistant diving coach
records all their meets.

262
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,662
Thought for some reason
we might want to see this.

263
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:49,636
-Thoughtful.
-Yeah.

264
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,538
Maybe we should talk to her.

265
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,440
''We''?

266
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,308
<i>Listen, why don't you call me...</i>

267
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,679
<i>...and we'll see what we can do</i>
<i>about getting you a real job.</i>

268
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,013
<i>Better yet, talk to me later</i>
<i>at Marie's party.</i>

269
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,816
-<i>I wasn't invited.</i>
-<i>You are now.</i>

270
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,091
So my client talked to her.
So what?

271
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:15,222
By the look on his face, he had a
little bit more than just talking in mind.

272
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,425
That is ridiculously accusatory.

273
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,469
I know what a man's thinking
when he looks like that.

274
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,732
-This is insane.
-No, this is rape!

275
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,309
-Alleged rape.
-I just offered-- I just offered her a job.

276
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,776
And an invitation to a birthday party.

277
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,006
That is not a crime.

278
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,812
-How about Risa Howard?
-Who's Risa Howard?

279
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,648
-She filmed this, Your Honor.
-Who?

280
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,791
I interviewed her
a couple hours ago.

281
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,620
She said she was supposed
to videotape the meet...

282
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:46,730
...but she couldn't believe how
sleazy Jay Clifton was acting.

283
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,899
-That's crazy!
-Enough.

284
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,504
Overactive imagination. Is this
what you're basing your case on?

285
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,869
That and everything else
you've already heard in court.

286
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,204
If you plead guilty to rape...

287
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,281
...the state's prepared to drop
the kidnapping and assault charges.

288
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,284
Out of the question.

289
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,203
Detective Morrison.

290
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,100
What happened?

291
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,436
Your stepfather's
in a lot of trouble.

292
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,606
I can't believe you're doing this.

293
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,218
You're not gonna
get away with this, bitch.

294
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,379
Let's go.

295
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,631
I can't believe this is happening.

296
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,738
Jay. How are you holding up?

297
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:07,642
-I'm in some shit here.
-Well, if there's anything I can do....

298
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,007
Theo doesn't think
there's any way out.

299
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,777
I'm gonna have to take their offer.

300
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,617
Which means what?

301
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,484
Which means I'm going to
prison for a few years...

302
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,183
...as opposed to a lot of years.

303
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,595
You really didn't do it, did you?

304
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,564
No! I swear to God
I didn't do it.

305
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:33,431
I don't know why
she's doing this to me.

306
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,998
Money.

307
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,732
She hasn't asked for any.

308
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,241
She's trailer trash.

309
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,108
She sees what we have
and wants it.

310
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,306
Wants it bad enough
to set you up.

311
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,044
Well, what am I supposed to do?

312
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,554
Maybe you should give it to her.

313
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:59,529
I mean, I could find out
how much she wants.

314
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,192
I'm not hearing any of this.

315
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,666
Look, this could ruin my--

316
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,828
Our whole lives. Okay?
I don't want that to happen.

317
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,737
Let's say she'd take some money
to go away. I don't have any.

318
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,778
I'm tapped out. I'm up to my ass
in debt with the bank.

319
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,677
And construction loans.

320
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,618
What about the diamonds?

321
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,385
You'd do that for me?

322
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,562
It's what Mom would have wanted.

323
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,759
I mean, we're a family, after all.

324
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,928
She'd want cash.

325
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:47,712
-How do we do it?
-This isn't a good idea, Jay.

326
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,608
Theo, could it be done?

327
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,321
I represented an importer years ago.
He might find someone...

328
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,552
...to front money
against their worth.

329
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:09,894
But nobody's gonna do anything
without clear title to the inheritance.

330
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,714
Let's do it.

331
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:34,114
-Hello.
-<i>Listen to me, you little slut.</i>

332
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:38,194
Get your ass over to my house
right now. I want to talk to you.

333
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,571
Hello?

334
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,895
Is anyone here?

335
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,805
He cleared my inheritance.

336
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,260
Kiss me.

337
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,569
Not yet.

338
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,618
Mind if Chad joins in?

339
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,087
Fuck me.

340
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,067
Anytime. Anyplace.

341
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,921
I can't believe it was that easy.

342
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,728
And now all you have to do
is get on the stand...

343
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,701
...and do the right thing.

344
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:12,036
-And swear to tell the truth....
-The whole truth....

345
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,735
And nothing but the truth.

346
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,816
I swear to tell the truth...

347
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,081
...the whole truth and nothing
but the truth. So help me God.

348
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,824
-We're good.
-How much did she want?

349
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,969
Way too much, 250.
But it's worth every penny.

350
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,765
-Good morning, Miss Sandoval.
-Good morning.

351
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,670
It's your assertion
that my client, Mr. Clifton...

352
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,505
...sexually assaulted you
on the night of the 25th.

353
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,704
Is that true?

354
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,241
Is that what you say happened?

355
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,510
No, he didn't...

356
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,945
...just sexually assault me.

357
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:03,220
-What do you mean?
-He didn't just sexually assault me.

358
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,295
He threatened to kill me
if I told anyone.

359
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,801
Isn't it true
that you were drunk that night?

360
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,494
I remember two things
clearly that night.

361
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:17,129
One was Jay Clifton raping me.

362
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:22,246
The other was what he whispered
in my ear right before I blacked out:

363
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,045
''You won't remember...

364
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,311
...but you'll never forget.''

365
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,455
You lying bitch!
You can't do this to me!

366
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,090
She's lying.

367
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,920
I didn't do anything!
I'm innocent!

368
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,267
<i>The testimony proved damning</i>
<i>for Clifton.</i>

369
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,629
<i>It took the jury less than</i>
<i>an hour to deliberate...</i>

370
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,366
<i>...and sentence him</i>
<i>to 1 5 years in prison.</i>

371
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,272
<i>This is Shirley Cina, reporting for</i>--

372
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,747
Hell, it could be a coincidence.

373
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,781
I don't think so.

374
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,718
She heard me speak
at the high school.

375
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:07,847
-How'd she get here to Blue Bay?
-Miami sent her to me.

376
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:11,018
I found her a place to live,
got her enrolled in school.

377
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,631
I don't know, Kristen.
All the evidence points to a rape.

378
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,666
-Michael, I'm telling you, she's lying.
-Why?

379
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,799
I don't know.

380
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,104
But I say we have
a little talk with her.

381
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,743
Oh, she fucked me!

382
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,307
-We got to do something.
-We'll appeal.

383
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,614
You got to get me out of here.

384
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,186
Since you're relatively
new to the community...

385
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:41,018
-...the court considers you a flight risk.
-There's something not right.

386
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,320
-I want to talk to the police.
-About what?

387
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,695
About what I did.
About the money.

388
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,564
I don't know if that's
such a good idea.

389
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,197
Don't worry.
I'll leave you out of it.

390
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:06,975
Well...

391
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,483
...it doesn't look like
anybody's here.

392
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,318
One way to find out,
I guess, huh?

393
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,060
Elena!

394
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,399
Blue Bay P.D.

395
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,939
I guess we go back
and get a warrant.

396
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,099
Come back in the morning.

397
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,439
Michael.

398
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,049
She stole my life.

399
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,290
Jesus.

400
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:38,774
I thought you were gonna
leave them in the bank.

401
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,745
Well, the doctor
has found us a buyer.

402
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,949
They're so beautiful.

403
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:54,252
A beautiful 4 million.

404
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,450
Maybe we should wait.

405
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,562
Sell them legitimately.

406
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,325
Be heartbreaking to see the
mother and daughter split up.

407
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,499
We've been over this.

408
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,162
That would take months,
and we can't risk...

409
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,036
...Jay finding a way
to block the sale.

410
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,567
Okay?

411
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,484
We could get more for them.

412
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,488
True.

413
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,429
But...

414
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,635
...a bird in the hand...

415
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:53,178
...is worth two in the bush.

416
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,382
Okay.

417
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:05,393
For the sake of argument, let's pretend
that you're telling the truth.

418
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,394
You didn't rape Elena Sandoval...

419
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,726
...and she took this bribe
you gave her.

420
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,568
So why didn't she
clear you in court?

421
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:16,537
What is this, the Spanish Inquisition?
How the fuck should I know?

422
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,538
You're the detective. Figure it out.

423
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:22,042
He didn't mean that. It's just that
we don't know the answer--

424
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,943
-You don't know the answer?
-Tell me something.

425
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:28,552
Exactly whose idea was it
to offer Elena money to go away?

426
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,154
-Actually, it was--
-Why? What are you getting at?

427
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:37,920
If you're telling the truth and she is
setting you up for some reason...

428
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,563
...then maybe she had a little help.

429
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,969
Son of a--

430
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,807
I signed away
my challenge to the will.

431
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,943
Meaning what?
What does that mean, huh?

432
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,180
Mr. Clifton is in a legal battle
with his stepdaughter.

433
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,622
-She's got the goddamn diamonds.
-Don't.

434
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:13,758
You're telling me that Marie
helped Elena set up this rape?

435
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:17,230
Yeah, but wait.
What about the evidence?

436
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,829
They would have needed help.

437
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,197
Yeah, they would have.

438
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,459
Hey, hey, hey.
We've got big problems.

439
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:03,395
-What's up?
-Nothing. I'll tell you later.

440
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,435
Come here.

441
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,809
-What the hell?
-I think I fucked up.

442
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,144
-How?
-I don't know for sure...

443
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,310
...but I think someone
was in my trailer last night.

444
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,285
''Someone''?

445
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,982
My probation officer, probably.

446
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:28,331
Okay, well, you-- You disposed
of everything, right?

447
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:32,265
I did, but.... But what if Jay
told them what you did?

448
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,131
Sweetie, men aren't
smart enough for that.

449
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:43,474
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
let the big bad wolf get you.

450
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:47,083
We're gonna get away
with this, right?

451
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,515
Absolutely.

452
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,756
Abso-fucking-lutely.

453
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:16,045
-Hey. Got a minute?
-Actually, no.

454
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,842
This won't take long. We just wanna
ask a couple of questions.

455
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,712
We really have things to do.

456
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,813
So go do them.

457
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,083
I'll call you later.

458
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,329
So, what's this about?

459
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,998
Lose a diamond?

460
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,561
Actually, no.
It's always been like that.

461
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,628
Just waiting for the right stone?

462
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,564
Something like that.

463
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:50,012
-So, what do you want?
-Your stepfather alleges...

464
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:54,140
...that you conspired to get him
falsely imprisoned for rape.

465
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,321
Yeah, right!

466
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:02,585
Yeah, he does. He says that you
talked him into signing away...

467
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,160
...any rights he had
over the diamonds.

468
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,694
And why would I do that?

469
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:10,425
To bribe Elena Sandoval
into dropping the charges against him.

470
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,035
Only that was never gonna happen.

471
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,472
In fact, your stepfather
never raped Elena, did he?

472
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,066
He was found guilty.

473
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,269
Yeah. He was.

474
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:23,913
Thanks to you and Elena.

475
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,376
And a little help
from Blue Bay Forensics.

476
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,013
I can't imagine
what you're talking about.

477
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:35,352
How about that you planned this
to get him give up his claim...

478
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,551
...against your inheritance?

479
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:42,164
Like I said, I don't know
what you're talking about...

480
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,927
...except that my mother
left those diamonds to me.

481
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,660
Not him. Me.

482
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,237
Well, that's good.
Because I understand...

483
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:52,637
...you've already gone
and collected your inheritance.

484
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,573
Good news travels fast.

485
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,736
So you got
your two priceless stones...

486
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,439
...except now you've got
partners to deal with.

487
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,177
Two diamonds, three players.

488
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,014
That could get ugly. Yeah.

489
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,123
-Are we done?
-Yeah.

490
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,883
We're done for now.

491
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,857
This is harassment.
I could sue you.

492
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,691
Well, knock yourself out, kid.

493
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,460
Tell you what, you and my ex-wife
can divvy up whatever I got left.

494
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:28,108
Detective.

495
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:32,372
Miss Richards. Is there something
I can do for you?

496
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,145
Yeah, I was wondering if you
could run a quick test for us.

497
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,581
No problem.

498
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,056
Please be careful.

499
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:53,192
I try to maintain
a sterile environment.

500
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,174
Are these the evidence photos
from the Elena Sandoval rape?

501
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,505
-Yes, they are, but--
-Did you, by any chance...

502
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,546
...ever find out what caused
these markings here?

503
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,682
Well, like I....

504
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,911
Like I told the judge,
my guess is fingernails.

505
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:19,021
Could it have maybe been
a prong setting of a ring?

506
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:22,688
One that's possibly
missing its stone?

507
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,800
Yeah. It's possible.

508
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,438
Marie Clifton has a ring like that.
Right?

509
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,004
You don't say.

510
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,703
No, I do say.

511
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,207
Come on.

512
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,143
The pill.

513
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,482
It's Rohypnol.

514
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,682
You don't say.

515
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,528
Fuck.

516
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,921
Hello?

517
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,788
What the hell?

518
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,428
We're screwed.

519
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,588
Morrison and that parole bitch
were sniffing around today.

520
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,064
They know something.

521
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:35,797
-Calm down.
-You fucking calm down!

522
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:39,170
They asked about your ring, genius.

523
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,506
They're onto something.
I can feel it.

524
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,442
They were fishing, okay?

525
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,915
If we stay cool and stick to the plan,
everything will be fine.

526
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:53,113
-I should move the diamonds tonight.
-You said you couldn't until next week.

527
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,451
Well, it might mean
a little less dough...

528
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:59,153
...but the fan is spinning
and the shit is coming.

529
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,630
How much less?

530
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:08,235
It will still be enough to keep us
liquid until time runs backwards.

531
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:13,675
No. I say we wait.

532
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,370
Where are the diamonds?

533
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:23,347
They're safe. Don't worry
your pretty little head about it.

534
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,454
-I want to see them.
-Why?

535
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:29,023
Because I want to, goddamn it.

536
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,623
You know, you need to calm down.

537
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:36,095
I got a goddamn right to see them.
We're partners.

538
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,394
Fine.

539
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:06,727
Two million dollars.

540
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:10,560
Wait. I thought you said
you could get--

541
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,463
What?

542
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,036
You said....

543
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,340
Don't fight it.

544
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:28,610
-What did you...?
-Don't fight it.

545
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,989
Hey, yeah. I can do it.
But it's got to be tonight.

546
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:44,430
No, no, no. Come on.
Not tomorrow. Tonight. Now.

547
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:47,092
No. What? Hey.

548
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,102
All right. Tomorrow. Fine.

549
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:52,071
Nine a.m. at the diner.

550
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,077
Yeah, I'll be there.

551
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,048
Chad, don't.

552
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,587
The doctor is sorry.

553
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,229
Bastard.

554
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,872
-Yeah?
-Chad fucked us.

555
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,843
I know. I was there.

556
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,312
No, Elena,
I mean he really fucked us.

557
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:36,213
-He stole my diamonds.
-<i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

558
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,513
No, I'm not kidding.

559
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,680
-Fuck!
-Would you keep it down?

560
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,952
I have a headache. We have to hurry.
I know where he's going.

561
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,119
-You think he'll sell them?
-Not if we find him first.

562
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,684
Pull over, asshole!

563
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:13,786
What?

564
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,322
Pull over, asshole!

565
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:18,188
Fuck you.

566
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,435
Son of a bitch.

567
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,277
God...

568
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,987
...damn!

569
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,127
Hi.

570
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:10,044
Michael. Hi.

571
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:15,245
-Where'd all that all come from?
-A meth bust a couple of months ago.

572
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,080
-Over 300 grand.
-No kidding.

573
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:21,418
-Yeah. So, what's up?
-I tried calling Elena again.

574
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,616
-Still no answer.
-Any idea where she is?

575
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,957
None, which is what worries me.

576
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,361
Listen, I've got to catalog this.
Come on.

577
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,839
Fuck!

578
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,948
You okay?

579
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:50,143
-Where is he?
-I don't fucking know!

580
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,880
That little shit has my diamonds.

581
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:56,219
We're not hurting him, Marie.
We just get our diamonds back.

582
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,827
I'm not gonna hurt him.
I'm gonna kill him.

583
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:02,022
Marie. Marie!

584
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:23,616
You smell good.

585
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,681
-Look, I'm sorry I never--
-What?

586
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:33,327
You never did anything to me.

587
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:38,659
And I have no regrets.

588
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,267
What?

589
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:48,969
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to go away?

590
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,706
No.

591
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,647
Because I can't.

592
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,590
You're going to have to be
the one to end it.

593
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:06,286
Wherever you hide, we're gonna
find you, you little weasel.

594
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:17,003
Gotcha!

595
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:32,013
Come on, Chad.
Where the fuck are you?

596
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:36,148
I'm not gonna hurt you. We just want
our fucking diamonds back.

597
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:39,929
-Damn. We're in big fucking trouble.
-What now?

598
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,032
I'm more than 1 0 miles
away from the police department.

599
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,169
Oh, God, Elena.

600
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:47,769
Are you telling me...

601
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,738
...that your parole officer
knows we're out here?

602
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,899
She knows.

603
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:58,605
Great. It's just fucking great.

604
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,623
-Shoot!
-What?

605
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,389
Elena.

606
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:14,755
Fuck.

607
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,363
Shit.

608
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:24,465
I've got to get out of here now
or she'll find us.

609
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,706
Do you hear that?

610
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:35,145
You go that way. Go.

611
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,657
Fuck!

612
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:58,740
Fuck! Come on! Fuck!

613
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,144
Elena!

614
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,677
Shit. Where the fuck are you?

615
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:09,545
Elena, do you see him?

616
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:14,018
Come on, Chad.
Where the fuck are you?

617
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,954
Bitch!

618
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:18,151
-No!
-Fucking bitch! Come here!

619
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:21,229
-Come on. Okay, no, no. Don't!
-Marie!

620
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:24,265
-Marie!
-Elena, shut up.

621
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:28,404
-Come here!
-Marie!

622
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:29,937
Shut up!

623
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,901
Sorry.

624
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:45,218
Fucking bastard.

625
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:50,259
You killed him.

626
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,456
Where the fuck
are the diamonds?

627
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,870
All right. Grab a leg.

628
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,665
Elena, come on.
Grab a fucking leg.

629
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:15,878
-We're getting closer.
-Which way?

630
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:18,919
-Left.
-All right.

631
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,523
God.

632
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:32,293
All right.
Get rid of the body. And his car.

633
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,829
Where are you going?

634
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:39,999
We've got an appointment.
to sell the diamonds.

635
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:43,145
My parole officer is gonna
find me any second.

636
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,278
Then I suggest you get to work.

637
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,766
Fuck!

638
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,469
Get in there.

639
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,822
Where the fuck is this diner?

640
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,430
Come on!

641
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:28,411
Fuck!

642
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,759
-Where's Johnson?
-Dead.

643
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,863
How could such a delicate thing
like you accomplish that?

644
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,090
Who said I did?

645
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,693
So, what brings you here?

646
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,430
Diamonds. Money.

647
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:52,967
Show me what you got.

648
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,974
You show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

649
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,310
Two million dollars.

650
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,176
The deal was four.

651
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,289
Johnson agreed to 2 million.

652
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:09,254
He's dead. Remember?

653
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,053
Two million is all I got.

654
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,821
Then you only get one diamond.

655
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,158
All right, let's see it.

656
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:30,646
You're sure this is the diamond
you wanna sell me?

657
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:32,746
Meaning?

658
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,289
What do you mean?
These are priceless.

659
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,433
You're priceless,
trying to pawn those shitty fakes.

660
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,932
-Are you crazy?
-They're fakes!

661
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,832
And not very good ones at that.

662
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,132
Wait!

663
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:06,574
Fuck me.

664
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:25,799
Would you care to explain
what you're doing?

665
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,974
It was an accident. I swear.

666
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:40,748
You're in some serious shit.

667
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,251
It was an accident, huh?

668
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:49,118
What were you doing out there?

669
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:51,886
I was just out cruising,
I saw the car--

670
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:56,361
Hey, hey, hey. Who the fuck
do you think you're talking to, huh?

671
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,363
We got your tracks dragging
his body back to the car...

672
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:03,700
...and forensics found that he was
killed by a blow to the head.

673
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:07,001
Now, we're talking about murder.
You understand that?

674
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,639
I didn't kill him.

675
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:12,576
You didn't kill him?

676
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,574
Okay, who did, huh?

677
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:20,988
We can't help you
unless you help us, Elena.

678
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,489
What do you want me to do?

679
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:36,600
Well, you can start
by telling the truth.

680
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:41,801
-So Marie planned it all.
-If you believe her.

681
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:44,674
Elena's not smart enough
to have thought this out.

682
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:48,578
-Marie has the brains and the motive.
-Let's talk it over with the DA.

683
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,743
It's Elena's word
against Marie Clifton's.

684
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,980
Who do you think
the court will believe?

685
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:56,352
What are you thinking?

686
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,494
Use Elena to set Marie up.

687
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,825
All right.

688
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:12,099
Where have you been?
I've been trying to call you for hours.

689
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,937
<i>The cops found me out there.</i>

690
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,011
-What happened?
-<i>Nothing.</i>

691
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:21,207
I said I was cruising, and didn't
think about being past my probation...

692
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:24,581
...l saw the car and almost
got killed trying to help him.

693
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:27,188
-And they believed you?
-Yeah.

694
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,257
They let me go.

695
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,188
-What about you?
-They were fakes.

696
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,522
-<i>What were fakes?</i>
-The diamonds.

697
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,434
-I don't understand.
-Jay must've just switched them...

698
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:43,561
...for fakes or something.
The guy fucking laughed at me.

699
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,369
-Where are the real ones?
-Well, gee, Elena, I don't know.

700
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:54,109
What are we gonna do?

701
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:55,545
I have an idea.

702
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,152
<i>Meet me at my house at 1 0.</i>

703
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,593
What now?

704
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:20,372
-What do I do?
-Just get her to admit she killed him.

705
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:22,477
And if she won't?

706
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:25,136
Then you're in big trouble.

707
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,731
Can you guys hear me?

708
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,267
<i>This thing work?</i>

709
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:54,801
I don't think I can do this.

710
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,945
Do what?

711
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,077
She's gonna blow it.

712
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:08,621
Whatever it is you've got planned.

713
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:18,125
Don't worry.
Everything is gonna be fine.

714
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:20,662
That's easy for you to say.

715
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:24,295
<i>You're not the one who almost</i>
<i>got killed out there in the swamp.</i>

716
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:28,672
<i>But $4 million would</i>
<i>make it all worth your while.</i>

717
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,710
<i>How do you plan</i>
<i>on getting that now?</i>

718
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:33,608
Because the real diamonds...

719
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:36,650
...are in Jay's safe
at the construction site.

720
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:41,183
How do you know that?

721
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,957
I have my sources.

722
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:54,295
He'll just take Chad's share
in the diamonds.

723
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,396
What about the combination?

724
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:00,701
How do you expect
to get into the safe exactly?

725
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,969
You believe the balls on this girl?

726
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,775
<i>That, my love...</i>

727
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,712
<i>...is where you come in.</i>

728
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,615
I don't--

729
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,558
All you have to do...

730
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,786
...is tell Jay you set him up...

731
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:23,693
...and that you'll sign a confession
if he gives us the combination.

732
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,358
She is amazing.

733
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,897
You might spend
a little time in juvie...

734
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:33,667
...but I will make it all
worth your while.

735
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,333
You're out of your mind.

736
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:38,537
First, you kill Chad...

737
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:41,046
...and now this.

738
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,419
Well, you wanna be with me,
don't you?

739
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,184
Yeah?

740
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,660
Please.

741
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:58,398
For us.

742
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:10,371
Is that a yes?

743
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,540
Please.

744
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:30,326
Well, well, well. Looks like
you two kissed and made up.

745
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:33,935
Very funny. Now give us
the combination to the safe.

746
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,103
Look, you wanna get out of here,
then you'll give me what's mine.

747
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:45,179
And how, pray tell, are you
gonna get me out of this hellhole?

748
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:55,014
It's a confession.

749
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:56,852
Dated but not signed.

750
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:00,562
You give us the real diamonds,
and I'll sign it.

751
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,325
And this goes into the mail,
Priority to Detective Morrison.

752
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:08,331
How do I know you're gonna do
what you say you'll do?

753
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:10,938
You're just gonna have to trust us.

754
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:14,634
-I've been down that road before.
-This is non-negotiable.

755
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:17,802
Jay?

756
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:26,916
We have no grounds for appeal.
This could be your last chance.

757
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,647
So?

758
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:41,293
Fuck it. Eight, 20, 99.

759
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:45,301
The combination
is the day Mom died?

760
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:48,311
You sick bastard.

761
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:48,675
You sick bastard.

762
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:54,307
Would you slow down?
We're in enough trouble as it is.

763
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:58,447
We are in no trouble at all.

764
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,450
But you killed Chad.

765
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,254
Whatever.

766
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:39,093
-Home free.
-We would be if you hadn't killed him.

767
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:43,958
-What is your obsession?
-I just don't think he had to die.

768
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:49,230
Talk to me. I need to know you're not
planning to do the same to me.

769
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:53,374
-She's a smart one.
-<i>Give it a rest.</i>

770
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:55,407
Too smart for her own good.

771
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:08,386
Come on. Keep pushing.

772
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:12,760
Why won't you just admit it?
You killed him in cold blood.

773
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:18,924
What the fuck is that?

774
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:21,427
She's been made. Stay in the car.

775
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:24,232
-No. She's my respon--
-Stay in the car!

776
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:33,476
What are you doing?

777
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:40,583
It's already been done.

778
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,108
What the fuck
are you talking about?

779
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:04,235
Don't worry. Everything
is gonna be fine.

780
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:10,318
Oh, no! You fucking did it,
you little bitch!

781
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,696
Shit!

782
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,145
Elena.

783
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:31,622
Fuck!

784
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,980
Elena.

785
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:59,160
Come on, sweetie.

786
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:02,161
Just give me my diamonds back.

787
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:07,432
Come on. I thought we were
in this together, huh?

788
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:11,300
Come out.

789
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,170
Everything will be--

790
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:45,306
I didn't have a choice.

791
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:51,409
She was gonna shoot us.

792
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,946
It's all right.

793
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:58,449
It's okay.

794
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,284
So where did you get the gun?

795
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,893
I live in a trailer park, detective.

796
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:42,292
Where do you think I got it?

797
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:47,331
I don't suppose you've got
a permit for it, do you?

798
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:53,805
Would you cut her some slack,
Michael? She's lucky she had it.

799
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:57,143
You're still in a lot of trouble.

800
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,347
She knows.

801
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,744
I'm gonna take her home.

802
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:06,251
Have one of your deputies
give us a ride.

803
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:10,051
I'll bring her by in the morning,
all right, at 1 0:00?

804
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,552
Hey.

805
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:22,999
Are you sure that there were
no diamonds in that safe?

806
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:26,630
It pissed her off. That's when
she grabbed me and found the mike.

807
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:32,113
Come on.

808
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,909
We'll see you in the morning.

809
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:55,760
Those diamonds were in that safe.
She's lying!

810
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:58,236
We didn't find any diamonds.

811
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:01,035
They weren't on
either one of the girls.

812
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,906
-Maybe they're hiding them.
-You're free, Mr. Clifton.

813
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,274
-Why don't you go find them?
-Hey!

814
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:09,348
Bullshit!

815
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:11,945
Awfully convenient
how they disappeared...

816
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:15,056
...after you and your men
showed up, don't you think?

817
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:20,460
Get your client out of here before
his mouth gets him in more trouble.

818
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,793
Come on, Jay.

819
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:31,405
Hey. It's me.

820
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:34,167
You said you'd be in by 1 0.
It's after 1 1 .

821
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:35,833
Give me a call, huh?

822
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:39,674
Better yet, just get your ass in here.

823
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:42,681
-Detective Morrison.
-Yeah? What's up?

824
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:46,048
Dalmers. Internal Affairs.

825
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:52,487
It's gone.

826
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:56,428
All $350,000 in seized evidence.

827
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,964
What's this got to do with me?

828
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,398
I was hoping you'd be able
to answer that.

829
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,435
-What?
-No one's been here...

830
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:06,165
...since the money was put here,
except you.

831
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:11,007
Your key card was the last one
to open the locker.

832
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,160
It's so beautiful.

833
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,331
The mother.

834
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,603
And the daughter.

835
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,076
It seems Elena Sandoval was given up
for adoption when she was born.

836
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:53,278
The records show that the
blood mother was Kristen Richards.

837
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:56,583
Something to do with
a rape case down in Miami.

838
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:59,993
The girl had a decent life
with her adopted parents...

839
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:04,997
...until she suddenly disappeared just
before school started a few weeks ago.

840
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:08,565
She was never on probation?

841
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:10,432
Nope.

842
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,431
Never.

843
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:17,105
They set the whole thing up.

844
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:23,379
Kristen Richards had a spotless
record her whole life.

845
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:27,251
What set her off?

846
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:36,625
<i>You know the guy</i>
<i>I really feel sorry for?</i>

847
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:39,724
The cop.

848
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:43,333
Hell hath no fury.

849
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:46,030
I never wanted to hurt him.

850
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:50,869
He was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

851
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,378
How about a fresh one?

852
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,177
A girl after my own heart.

853
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:14,468
Boy, you two look so good...

854
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:18,832
...that it's difficult to tell
the mother from the daughter.

855
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:22,176
Oh, that's just the roofies talking.

856
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:24,440
What did you say?

857
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:31,043
South Florida, class of '88,
hell of a party.

858
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:37,421
You know, I'd never actually
tasted cocktails like that before.

859
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:41,120
I-- I don't--
What are you talking about?

860
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:44,825
You and me.

861
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:49,869
It was like being awake
during an operation.

862
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:55,568
You can feel everything going on,
only there's nothing you can do.

863
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:58,338
-What?
-I wasn't sure, when you moved here...

864
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:03,075
...to Blue Bay a few years ago.
So I did a little digging.

865
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,718
Your college yearbook photo
sealed the deal.

866
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:11,655
-And I knew it was you.
-What the fuck are you talking about?

867
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:15,959
You took something
from me that night...

868
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,391
...but you left
a little something behind.

869
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:23,999
A daughter.

870
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,940
What night? I don't remember.

871
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:34,077
-You may not remember.
-But you'll never forget.

872
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:42,980
Oh, man!

873
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:51,966
Nice takeoff.

874
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:54,432
Gotta work on the landing.

875
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:39,543
Must be heartbreaking, being in
the kind of financial trouble you're in...

876
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,240
...having those diamonds
just sitting right there.

877
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:44,909
Who the hell are you?

878
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,954
There's no way
to beat her in court.

879
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:51,953
How did you get in here?

880
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:56,826
But you take Marie out of the picture,
and all your troubles go away.

881
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,332
We should talk.

882
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:16,614
-I just really want what's mine.
-That's what I'm saying.

883
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:20,380
The diamonds are your inheritance.
You deserve them.

884
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:24,924
I just don't know if my fucking
stepfather is ever gonna give up.

885
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:28,085
That's why we've gotta make this
a really good show.

886
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:32,523
You listen to me and we'll pull
this fucker off, guaranteed.

887
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:11,702
Hey, Risa.

888
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:29,123
Look, I'm a very busy man.
I'll call you when the tests are done.

889
01:20:35,363 --> 01:20:36,921
Will you take a check?

890
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:39,760
Fuck, no.

891
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:42,627
Money talks...

892
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:44,897
...bullshit walks.

893
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,509
Then how would you...

894
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:53,443
...like to make some real money?

895
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:01,112
Chad likes the sound of that.

896
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:16,560
We're not hurting him, Marie.
We just get our diamonds back.

897
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:21,435
Oh, no. I'm not gonna hurt him.
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

898
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,620
Showtime, Mother.

899
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,687
Ladies?

900
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:15,463
Very impressive.

901
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:18,360
Truthfully, I never thought
you could pull it off.

902
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:19,830
So let's see our future.

903
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:24,569
And the diamonds?

904
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:31,368
How do I know
they're the real thing?

905
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:34,037
You're just gonna have to trust us.
