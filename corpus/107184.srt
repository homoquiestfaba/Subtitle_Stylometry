1
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,780
When a man
Loves a woman

2
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,350
Can't keep his mind
On nothin' else

3
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,360
He'd change the world for
The good thing he's found

4
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,430
If she is mad
He can see it

5
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,400
She can do no wrong

6
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,940
Turn his back
On his best friend

7
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,080
If he put her down

8
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,080
When a man
Loves a woman

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,220
Spend his very last dime

10
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,230
Tryin' to hold on
To what he needs

11
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,930
He'd give up
All his comforts

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,970
And sleep out in the rain

13
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,970
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

14
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,380
Ooh
Well, this man
Loves you, woman

15
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,490
I'd give you everything
I had

16
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,200
Tryin' to hold on
To your high-class love

17
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,740
Baby, please don't
Treat me bad

18
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,210
When a man
Loves a woman

19
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,620
Down deep in his soul

20
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,620
She can bring him
Such misery

21
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,130
If she plays him
For a fool

22
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,040
He's the last one
To know

23
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Lovin' eyes
Can never see

24
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,110
When a man
Loves a woman

25
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,620
Okay, brother.

26
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,190
Right. That...

27
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,690
And that.

28
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,690
And that
Is cricket, hon.

29
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,800
Do you want it ?

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
Sure.

31
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,500
Doesn't matter
If you don't.

32
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,510
You know,
I won't be offended.
Jody's never offended.

33
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,280
What you say your name was ?
Jude.

34
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,950
Jude. Why,
That suits you, jude.

35
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,320
The teddy bear ?
No ! Fuck this bear.

36
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,520
The name: jude.

37
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,530
And it is jude,
Right ?

38
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,030
I gotta piss, jude.

39
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,730

40
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,740

41
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,280
Ooh, jude, my baby

42
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,280

Don't run off, jude.

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,280
You don't know me,
Do ya ?

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,620
What if I did ?
You'd know I wouldn't run off.

46
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,620
Oh !

47
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,330

00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,340
You know what ?
Tell me, jody.

49
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,340
It's nice.

50
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,610
Not here.

51
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,850
Who gives a fuck ?
Ya never know.

52
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,480
I never know nothing.

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,490
People. They could be lookin'.
Let 'em look.

54
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,850
Come and get me, soldier.
Whatever you say, jude.

55
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,930
Oh, I said
Baby, baby

Baby, whatcha doin'

59
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,150
What the fuck-

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,520
Get off. Get off.

61
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,520
Get it on !
Get it on.

62
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,290
Come on !

63
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,110
Jude !

64
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,510
She wears that
Silk blue sweater

65
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,510
She likes to wear
Her stockings black

66
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,920
So, what's your name,
Soldier ?

67
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,930
- fuck you. - yeah.

68
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,150
The situation
Is simple.

69
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,150
You're being held hostage
By the irish republican army.

70
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,160
They've got one of our senior members 
under interrogation in castlereagh.

71
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,460
We've informed 'em that
if they don't release him
within three days,

72
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,800
You'll be shot.

73
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,800
You'll be treated as our guest
Until further developments.

74
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,870
Have you anything
To say ?

75
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,680
Give him
A cup of tea.

76
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
You want
A cup of tea ?

77
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,130
Thanks, jude.

78
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,100
See does he
Want some.

79
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,110
Do you want
Some food ?

80
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,720
Hey.

81
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,490
What's he like ?

82
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,500
Horny bastard.

83
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,200
Did you give him it ?

84
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,210
There're certain things I wouldn't do
for my country.

85
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,810
Have a look at him.

86
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,480
Can't.

87
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,490
Poke him or somethin'.
See if he's still alive.

88
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,630
He's all right.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours.

89
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,100
Go on.
Have a heart.

90
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,020
You fucking bitch !
You fucking bitch !

91
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,960
You fucking whore !

92
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,330
You fucking whore !

93
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,300
Give me a knife !
I'll cut his fuckin' heart out !

94
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,070
Give me a knife !
Jesus !

95
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,480
You all right ?

96
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,820
Fuckin' animal.
Come on, jude.

97
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,820
What do you mean "come on" ?
I had him all over me !

98
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,190
Yeah.

99
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,200
Tough work, that.
Well, someone's gotta do it.

100
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,170
Nah, it
Was a breeze.

101
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,640
I just thought
Of you.

102
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,650
You know what, fergus ?
What ?

103
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,720
One of you
Made me want it.

104
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Which one ?

105
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Hold it there.
To your left.

106
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,040
Walk on. It's okay.

107
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,010
Around, around
To your left.

108
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,150
Gonna open
The door.

109
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,520
Move to your left.

110
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,790
Walk in. That's it.

111
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,800
Listen, soldier, you
Should eat somethin'.

112
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,340
Can't.
What do you mean,
You can't ?

113
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,340
I can't eat
Through a canvas bag.

114
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,480
Okay. Okay.

115
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,490
Here.

116
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,360
Fuckin' hell, man !
This is a farce !

117
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,360
How is it a farce ?
I seen your fucking face !

118
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,800
So, what do I look like ?

119
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,810
You're the one about 5'10"
with the killer smile...

120
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,940
And the baby face.

121
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,650
Oh, am I ? Yeah.

122
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,650
And the brown eyes.

123
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:17,660
You're the handsome one.

124
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,140
Thank you, handsome.
My pleasure.

125
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,810
I can't fuckin' breathe, man.

126
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,820
Be a christian,
Will ya ?

127
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,490
Tell him to take the hood off, honey.

128
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,930
How'd you know it was her ?

129
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,360
I can smell her perfume.

130
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,140
See, if we took the hood off,
We'd have to shoot you.

131
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,140
As it is, you got a fifty-fifty chance.

132
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,740
I thought you liked me,
You bitch.

133
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,410
It was fun while it lasted.

134
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,420
Nice lady.

135
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,420
Please, man.
I'm suffocatin' in here.
Take it off.

136
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,860
Can we not take it off ?
Have to check with himself.

137
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,230
Here. You mind him.

138
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,270
Don't leave me
With her, man !

139
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,270
She's dangerous !

140
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,320
Peter ? Can I take
The prisoner's hood off ?

141
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,950
Why do you want
To do that ?

142
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,120
- poor whore's suffocatin'
In the heat.
- so ?

143
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,020
Anyway, he's seen our faces.
He's seen your face.

144
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,160
Yeah, and he saw jude
As well.

145
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,000
Peter-
If you don't mind him
Seein' you, I don't mind;

146
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,770
- but you're the only one
He looks at.
- right. Thanks.

147
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,770
It's your decision.

148
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,850
Leave him to me, jude.
My pleasure.

149
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,380
Thank you, soldier.

150
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,560
Never thought fresh air
would taste this good.

151
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,360
Now, if you loose up my hands,
I could feed myself.

152
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,430
No fuckin' way.

153
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,400
I'm only joking.

154
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,370
You know, I was wrong
about one thing.

155
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,140
- and what's that ?
- you're no pinup.

156
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,950
- no ?
- no. You're not handsome
At all.

157
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,620
Are you tryin' to hurt my feelings ?
No.

158
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,620
- it's the truth.
- well, I could say the same thing about you.

159
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,690
Could you ?
But I won't.

160
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,700
We're more polite around these parts.
So I've noticed.

161
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,770
Hey.
What is it now ?

162
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,010
You're gonna have
to do it, aren't you ?

163
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,010
- do what ?
- kill me.

164
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,320
What makes you
Think that ?

165
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,660
They're not gonna let that guy out,

166
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,460
And you're gonna have to kill me.

167
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,660
They'll let him out.
You want to bet ?

168
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,470
I'm not a gamblin' man.
And even if they do,

169
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,300
You can't just let me loose.

170
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,410
Why can't we ?
Not your nature.

171
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,310
What do you know about my nature ?

172
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,940
I'm talkin' 'bout
your people, not you.

173
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,710
What the fuck do you know
about my people ?

174
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,290
Only that you're all tough,
undeluded motherfuckers...

175
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,660
And it's not in your nature
To let me go !

176
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,660
Shut the fuck up, would ya ?

177
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,670
Here.

178
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,170
You know a funny thing ?

179
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,180
No. What's the funny thing ?
I didn't even fancy her.

180
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,280
Didn't look
Like that to me.

181
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,720
She's not my type.

182
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,150
No ?

183
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,860
No.

184
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,960
Come here.

185
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,930
No. Come here.

186
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,930
I wanna show you something.

187
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,940
What ?
My inside pocket.

188
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,420
Take out my wallet.

189
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,860
Open it.

190
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,630
Inside there's a picture.

191
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,640
No, not that one.

192
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,640
There's another.

193
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,310
Now, she's my type.

194
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,920
She'd be anybody's type.
Don't you think of it, fucker.

195
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,790
Why not ?
She's mine.

196
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,360
Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.

197
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
No ?
Absolutely not.

198
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,070
Is she your wife ?

199
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,770
I guess
You could say that.

200
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,780
You make a nice couple.
Don't I know it.

201
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,980
So what were you
Fuckin' around for then ?

202
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,020
You fuckers set me up.

203
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,020
That- that bitch.
Ah-ah-ah.

204
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,060
She's a friend of mine.

205
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,130
Okay.
That nice lady.

206
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,870
She meets me in a bar.

207
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm thinkin' to myself:

208
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,510
"what the fuck
am I doin' here anyway ?"

209
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,210
What the fuck were you doin' here ?
I got sent.

210
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,210
- you could've said no.
- can't once I signed up.

211
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,220
- why did you sign up ?
- it was a job.

212
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,820
Ah, yeah, a job.

213
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,590
So I get sent to
The one place in the world...

214
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,620
Where they call you "nigger"
To your face.

215
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,930
Shouldn't take it personally.

216
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,930
"go back to
Your banana tree, nigger."

217
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,070
There's no use tellin' 'em
I come from tottenham.

218
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,080
And you like cricket ?
Best game
In the world.

219
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,950
Ever see hurling ?

220
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,280
That game
Where a bunch of paddies
Whack sticks at each other ?

221
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,050
Best game in the world. The fastest.
Never.

222
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,020
Well,
In antigua cricket's
The black man's game.

223
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,590
Kids play it
From the age of two.

224
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,700
My dad had me
Throwin' googlies
From the age of five.

225
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,230
Then we moved
To tottenham and it
Was somethin' different.

226
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,440
How was it different ?
Toffs' game there.

227
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,740
But not at home.

228
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,050
So, when you come
To shoot me, paddy,

229
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:39,050
Remember
You're gettin' rid
Of a shit-hot bowler.

230
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,690
I'll bear it in mind.

231
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, and by the way,

232
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,300
It's not "paddy."
It's fergus.

233
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,370
Nice to meet you,
Fergus.

234
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,380
My pleasure, jody.

235
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,390
Stay. Wait. Wait !

236
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,190
Take it easy now.
Just go slow.
Down by that tree.

237
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,300
Tree. Tree.

238
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,300
Right.

239
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,410
You gotta loosen my hands.
Can't.

240
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,580
Can't ?

241
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,580
Then you're gonna have
To take my dick out
For me, aren't you ?

242
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,490
Come on, man !
I'm gonna wet my pants.

243
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,970
Take the fucker out, man.
I'm dying.

244
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,680
I gotta lean forwards,
Or dribble all over myself.

245
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,690
Would you hold my hands
For me ?

246
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,170
Now, that
Is worth waiting for.

247
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,170
Hurry up, will ya ?
These things
Take time, fergus.

248
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,210
It's amazing how
These small details...

249
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,220
Take on such importance,
Isn't it ?

250
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,490
Now put it back in.

251
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,560
Give us a break.
I can't do it !

252
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,390
It's only
A piece of meat.

253
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,400
For fuck's sake,
It's got no major diseases !

254
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,610
Thank you.

255
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,150
I had a case of the clap
Two years ago.

256
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,050
Crabs in ulster.
Shut up,
Will ya !

257
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,720
But, all in all,
It served me pretty well.

258
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Get inside, will ya ?
I didn't mean
To offend you, fergus.

259
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,430
Fergus.

260
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,170
Yeah ? I'm sorry.

261
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,170
I- I know that
Wasn't very easy for you.

262
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,780
The pleasure was all mine. 

263
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,650
Oh, no, it was mine.

264
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,660
Believe me,
It was my pleasure.

265
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,160
What the fuck is this ?
Nothin', man.

266
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,930
He just took me out
For a pee.

267
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,940
Put the fuckin' hood
On him.

268
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,210
What the fuck is this ?
Nothin'.

269
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,350
He's just got
A sense of humor,
That's all.

270
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,490
When you're on duty
You'll keep your
Fuckin' mouth shut.

271
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,490
Go on and get some sleep.
Yeah, get
Some sleep.

272
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,950
Did he talk ?

273
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,950
Didn't
Make you laugh ?

274
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,520
Here, have
Some breakfast.

275
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,460
Good morning,
Fergus.

276
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,260
So, he knows your name ?
Yeah, I told him.

277
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,730
Are you all there ?
Come here.

278
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,640
I said come here !

279
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,640
Back in a minute,
Jody.

280
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,250
You'll have minimum contact with that prisoner !
Yeah, okay.

281
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,420
You know why ?
Why ?

282
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,420
Because tomorrow we
Might have to shoot him,
That's why.

283
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,070
They givin' you
Trouble, fergus ?

284
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,980
It happens.

285
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,880
There's two kinds
Of people:

286
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Those who give
And those who take.

287
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,730
Take off
The hood, man.

288
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,900
It's okay.

289
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,530
I understand.

290
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,540
Don't mind if
I prattle on, do you ?

291
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,080
I take it by your silence
That you don't.

292
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,120
Two types, fergus:

293
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,120
The scorpion
And the frog.

294
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,990
Ever heard of 'em ?

295
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,000
A scorpion wants
To cross the river,
But he can't swim.

296
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,070
Goes to
A frog who can
And asks for a ride.

297
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,610
Frog says,
"if I give you
A ride on my back,

298
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,340
You'll go
And sting me."

299
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,950
Scorpion replies,
"it would not be in
My interest to sting you...

300
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,550
Since, as I'll
Be on your back,
We both would drown."

301
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,450
Frog thinks about
This logic for a while
And accepts the deal.

302
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,460
Takes the scorpion
On his back,
Braves the waters,

303
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,200
Halfway over
Feels a burning spear
In his side...

304
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,500
And realizes the scorpion
Has stung him after all.

305
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,110
And as they both
Sink beneath the waves,

306
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,350
The frog cries out,

307
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,020
"why'd you sting me
Mr. Scorpion ?

308
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,020
For now
We both will drown."

309
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,730
Scorpion replies,

310
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,730
"I can't help it.
It's in my nature."

311
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,970
So what's that
Supposed to mean ?

312
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,910
Means what it says.

313
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,910
A scorpion does
What is in its nature.

314
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,520
Take off
The hood, man.

315
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,530
Why ? 'Cause you're kind...

316
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,660
And it's
In your nature.

317
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,750
See ? I was right
About you.

318
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,790
Don't be so sure.

319
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,400
Jody's always right.

320
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Where would you most
Like to be now, man ?

321
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,240
Doesn't matter where.
Come on, man.

322
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,980
If this shit
Was all over.

323
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,380
Uh,

324
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,490
Havin' a pint
In the rock.

325
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,360
You lack
Imagination, fergus.

326
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,360
Think of something
More... Alluring.

327
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,030
Like what ?

328
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,030
Like... Havin' a pint
In the metro.

329
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,440
Havin' two pints in the rock.
Havin' a pint
In the metro...

330
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,110
And dil's
Havin' a margarita.

331
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,250
Who's dil ?
Special friend.

332
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,720
Oh, yeah.

333
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
We got simple tastes, you and me.
Yup, the best.

334
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,000
But you guys never
Get a break, do you ?

335
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,530
Do you ? Oh, yeah.

336
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,240
We do a tour of duty
And we're finished.

337
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,510
But you guys are
Never finished,
Are you ?

338
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,510
We don't look on it
That way.

339
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,980
Often wonder
How you do it.

340
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,120
It depends
What you believe in.

341
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,790
What do you believe in ?
That you guys
Shouldn't be here.

342
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,790
That simple ? Yup.

343
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,600
Put that thing back on him, fergus.
He's hot !

344
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,530
Doesn't matter if he's hot.
Just cover the fucker up.

345
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,070
You got no feelings,
Woman !

346
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:57,070
You shut your face !

347
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,410
You're headed for trouble, fergus.
Okay, okay.

348
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,080
He's a good soldier-

349
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,090
I said
Shut the fuck up.

350
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,890
He believes in the future.
Is that right ?

351
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,930
Is it bad ?

352
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,930
Not bad.

353
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,940
Women are trouble. Do you know that, fergus ?
I didn't.

354
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,710
Some kinds of women are.

355
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,720
She can't help it.

356
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,350
Dil, she was no trouble,
No trouble at all.

357
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,790
- you liked her ?
- present tense, please, please.

358
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,970
Love her...

359
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,970
Wherever she is.

360
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:29,310
I'm thinkin' of her now.
Would you think of her too ?

361
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,380
I don't know her.

362
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,390
- I want you
To do something for me.
- what ?

363
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:42,560
- if they kill me-
- don't think that way.

364
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,430
But they will,

365
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,770
As sure
As night follows day.

366
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,070
They have to.

367
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,500
I want you
To find her out.

368
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,710
Tell her
I was thinkin' of her.

369
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,710
See if she's all right.
I don't know her.

370
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:06,120
Take her picture. It's-

371
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,120
Come here. It's in
My inside po-pocket.

372
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,100
Take the whole lot.
I won't need it.

373
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,100
I told you not
To talk that way.

374
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:26,380
Go to millies hair salon
In spittalfields.

375
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,310
Take her to the metro
For a margarita.

376
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,850
You don't have
To tell her who you are.

377
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,850
You just tell her jody was thinkin' of her-
Stop it.

378
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,140
Volunteer ?

379
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,150
We need you inside.

380
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,970
We've heard word.

381
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,970
They've used
Every trick in the book
And he's beginnin' to talk.

382
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,010
You're gonna have
To do it in the mornin'.

383
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,950
You okay about that ?

384
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,350
I'm a volunteer, am n't I ?
Good.

385
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,920
Beginnin' to have
Me doubts about you
The past few days.

386
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,060
Not the only one.

387
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,060
Better get some sleep
Tonight, fergus.

388
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,940
Peter. What ?

389
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,470
Request permission to guard
The prisoner tonight.

390
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,010
You're crazy. Don't let him, peter.
Shut the fuck up, jude.

391
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,010
What do you want to do that for ?
It would make
Me feel better about it.

392
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,620
Sure about that ?
Yeah, I'm sure.

393
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,630
Okay. You're
A good man, fergus.

394
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Don't.
I- I'm sorry.

395
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,190
Help me.

396
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,730
How can I ?
I don't know.

397
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,330
I don't know.

398
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,570
Just help me.

399
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,540
Give me a cigarette.

400
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:17,930
I don't even-
I don't even smoke.

401
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,940
Thought it was
The right thing to do.

402
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,990
Go to sleep now.
I don't want
To sleep.

403
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,190
Tell me something.

404
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,900
What ? A story.

405
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,870
Like the one about the frog ?
And the scorpion ?

406
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,240
No. No.

407
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,040
Tell me anything.

408
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,050
"when I was a child,
Yeah ?

409
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,560
"I thought as a child.

410
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,020
"but when I became a man,

411
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,030
I put away
Childish things."

412
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,800
What does that mean ?

413
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,600
Nothing.

414
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,040
Nothing ?

415
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,810
Tell me something.

416
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,820
Anything.

417
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:40,190
Not a lot of use,
Are you, fergus ?

418
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,370
Me ?

419
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,240
No.

420
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,240
I'm not good for much.

421
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,310
Come on, stand up.

422
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,280
Turn to your right.

423
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,290
Okay, step up.
One step.

424
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,460
Okay, turn
To your right.

425
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,460
Go forward.
Step up.

426
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,340
Now to the left.

427
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,310
I wish to say on behalf of the irish republican army-
Leave him be !

428
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:16,300
Take the hood off,
Fergus.

429
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,530
No.

430
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:22,040
I want to see you
A bit, please. Please.

431
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,040
Don't make me die
Like an animal.

432
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,560
I'm glad
You're doin' it.

433
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,830
Do you know that,
Fergus ?

434
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:47,770
Why ?
'Cause you're
My friend.

435
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,770
And I want you to go to the metro.
Stop that talk now !

436
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,550
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, fergus ?
The fastest.

437
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,710
Faster than cricket ?
Cricket's in
The ha'penny place.

438
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,720
So if I ran,
There's no way I could
Beat you, is there ?

439
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,920
You won't run !
But if I did,

440
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,930
You wouldn't shoot a brother in the back.
Jody !

441
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,100
You stupid bastard !
What'd you say,
Faster ?

442
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,500
I said you bastard ! Stop !
Gotta catch me first.

443
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,510
Used to run the mile,
You know, four times
Around the cricket pitch.

444
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,810
What was that game called ?
Hurling !

445
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,350
What ? What ?
Hurling !

446
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,850
Told you I was fast, huh ?

447
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,360
Don't do it.

448
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,140
Jody !

449
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,450
All line up !
Follow me !

450
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,060
Over here now !

451
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:18,070
Jude !

452
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,170
Fergus.

453
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,180
You're back
On the bike, tommy ?

454
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,810
How're ya keepin' ?
All right.

455
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:02,820
And notice I've asked you nothin'.
That's wise, tommy.

456
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,220
All right then.
I like bein' wise.

457
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,130
So what do you need,
Fergus ?

458
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,830
Need to go across the water.
Do ya now ?

459
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,970
Need to lose myself
For a while.

460
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,080
Aye.

461
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,080
There's a man I know
Ships cattle to london.

462
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,620
We're closing.

463
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,120
You deaf ?

464
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,120
I'll see you tomorrow, dil.
'Night.

465
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,130
Want something in particular ?
Just a bit
Of a trim.

466
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,600
Come on.

467
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,890
Someone recommended you ?
In a way.

468
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,890
Who ? Uh- a guy I work with.

469
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:42,200
What's his name ?
Does the water
Not get to your nails ?

470
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:46,530
What's it to you ?
Nothing.

471
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,570
You american ? No.

472
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,440
You're not english.
No.

473
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,540
Scottish ?
How'd you guess ?

474
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,550
- the accent, I suppose.
- oh. What's it like ?

475
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,720
Like treacle.

476
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,730
Nice laugh.

477
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:21,570
There. That should
Make her happy.

478
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,150
Who's "she" ?
Don't know.
Who is "she" ?

479
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,620
Hi, dil. Hiya, hon.

480
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:08,630
 All right ?
 I suppose.

481
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:15,030
Yes ? What'll it be ?
Bottle of guinness.

482
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:19,040
Bottle of guinness.

483
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,240
See that, col ?
See what, dil ?

484
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,710
He gave me a look.
Did he ?

485
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,410
I just cut his hair, you know.
Yeah ?

486
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:31,420
So what do you think ?
Nice.

487
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,490
There.
He did it again.

488
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,500
I saw that one. That was a look.
What would you call that ?

489
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,530
Ask him to ask me
What I'm drinking.

490
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,540
- she wants to know do you want
To know what she's drinking.
- a margarita.

491
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,150
Now he can look.

492
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:04,250
Ask him does he
Like his hair, col.

493
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,030
She wants to know, sir,
Do you like your hair.

494
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:11,030
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
He's scottish, col.

495
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,900
Scottish ? Yeah.

496
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,140
What he say ?
He agreed
That he was.

497
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,610
And what do you think
His name might be ?

498
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,610
I have no thoughts
On the subject.

499
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,680
Jimmy. Jimmy ?

500
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,420
Jimmy. That's
What he said.

501
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,950
Hiya, jimmy.

502
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:34,960
Hi, dil.

503
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,830
Sing us a song, dil.
Fuck off, dave.

504
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:42,100
Come on, babe.
You know what
I like.

505
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,100
Easy !

506
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,550
Shit.
Where d'you think you're
Fuckin' goin' then ?

507
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:59,380
Piss off, dave.
Get off my case !

508
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:03,390
Fuckin' cow !

509
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,740
Go on, get in there !
Stop pushing.

510
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,740
This is the last time.

511
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,230
One run ! Come on !

512
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:17,240
So, pat's a cricket fan,
Is he ?

513
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,610
It's not pat.
It's jim.

514
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,010
I don't actually give a fuck
Whether it's jim, pat or mick...

515
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:27,010
As long as you remember
You're not at lords,
All right ?

516
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,490
Here, love.

517
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:40,500
- so, I see you're
A regular, sir.
- is that good or bad ?

518
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,830
Well, you get to say,
"the usual, col,"
Things like that.

519
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:54,310
- here. Let's
Call this the usual.
- thanks.

520
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:59,350
No, no. It's on me.
Thanks very much.

521
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,930
You can take it out
If you want.

522
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,560
Came to see her,
Didn't you ?

523
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,570
- listen, there's something I
Should tell you. She's, uh-
- she's what ?

524
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:16,570
She's on.

525
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:26,720
I know all
There is to know

526
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,090
About the crying game

527
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,790
I've had my share

528
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,070
Of the crying game

529
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,810
First there are kisses
Kisses

530
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,750
Then there are sighs

531
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:57,750
And then before
You know where you are

532
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:03,220
You're saying good-bye

533
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,160
One day soon
I'm gonna tell the moon

534
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,870
About the crying game

535
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,610
And if he knows

536
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:23,710
Maybe he'll explain

537
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,520
Why there are heartaches
Heartaches

538
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:36,130
Why there are tears

539
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,430
And what to do

540
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:41,000
To stop feelin' blue

541
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
When love disappears

542
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,340
Don't want no more

543
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,850
Of the crying game

544
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,790
Don't want no more

545
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,330
Of the crying game

546
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,770
Don't know what you said
To make me love you so

547
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:16,340
I only know I never
Wanna let you go

548
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,710
He's still looking, col.
Persistent.

549
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:21,740
Good thing in a man.
An excellent quality.

550
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:24,950
- maybe he wants something.
- I expect he does.

551
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:28,950
- ask him.
- ask him yourself.

552
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:31,960
So tell me.

553
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,790
- everybody wants something.
- not me.

554
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,530
Not you ?
How quaint.

555
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:40,330
How old-fashioned
And quaint,
Isn't it, col ?

556
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,900
You old-fashioned ? Must be.

557
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,440
Got the money, dil !
Fuck off, dave.

558
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,110
You fuckin' promised.
Did I ?

559
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,310
You fucking did !
Well, didn't you ?

560
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:55,310
Well, come on !

561
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,450
It takes all types.

562
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:02,460
- so who's he ?
- he's what she
Should run a mile from.

563
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,560
- then why doesn't she ?
- who knows the secrets
Of the human heart ?

564
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:13,130
As long as we're together
Honey, I don't care

565
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,940
'Cause you
Started somethin'
Oh, can't you see

566
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:20,940
And ever since we met
You've had a hold on me

567
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,550
All right,
Good night.

568
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:27,550
You can't come
In here, love.

569
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:35,160
 Don't be like that.
 You heard me.

570
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,460
We're fuckin' grand
All of a sudden, eh ?

571
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:41,470
 Talk to me, you stupid bitch !
Piss off, dave.

572
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,800
- hi. - hi.

573
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,610
You forgot your bag.

574
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,240
Thank you. Jimmy.
Who the fuck's he ?

575
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,250
It's him, isn't it ?
Maybe.

576
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:00,960
See, they get the wrong idea.
Cunt.
What was that ?

577
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,520
- they all get the wrong idea.
- cunt.

578
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,090
- scrag-eyed dyke cunt !
- charming.

579
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,660
What'll I do ?
Break his neck.

580
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,500
No, don't.

581
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,400
He's gonna
Take his foot off
Slowly, david,

582
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,410
And you're to go home
Like a good boy,
You hear ?

583
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:22,180
Cunt.

584
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:26,180
Come on, honey.

585
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:33,090
You all right ?
Yes, thank you.

586
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,190
What was all that
About ?

587
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:39,360
He wants me to
Perform for him.

588
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,170
Perform ? You know.

589
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:46,370
You on the game ?
God, no.

590
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,410
I'm a hairdresser.

591
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:53,150
He's gettin' up.

592
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:57,150
Can't leave me then,
Can you ?

593
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,170
You want me to ask you in, right ?
No. Didn't say that.

594
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:18,170
But I'm not cheap,
You know that ?
Loud, but never cheap.

595
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:22,580
Hey !

596
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:25,980
Fucking dumb dyke
Carrot cunt !

597
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:29,990
If you kiss me,
It would really get his goat.

598
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:47,240
Now, if you ask me
To meet you tomorrow,

599
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,240
It would really
Drive him insane.

600
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,280
Where ?
Half-five at millies.

601
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,400
Give me
That look again.

602
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,410
What look ?
The one you gave me
In the metro.

603
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,680
Darling, you
Shouldn't have.

604
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,520
What's that about ?
They're jealous.

605
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,520
Why ? I wonder.

606
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,080
Now's the time you
Meant to do something,
Isn't it ?

607
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,750
Hmm, like what ?
Make a pass
Or something.

608
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:56,750
Isn't that the way it goes ?
Must be.

609
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:04,590
Have you got a special friend, jimmy ?
How special ?

610
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:08,500
Do you want one ?
Christ !

611
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,500
- - jesus.

612
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,610
That dave ?
The things a girl
Has to put up with.

613
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,050
I'm frightened, jimmy.
That's not like him.

614
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:31,420
Piss off, dave !

615
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,830
Tough guy, huh ?

616
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:37,000
Are you gonna be
All right on your own ?

617
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
But I'm not
On my own, am I ?

618
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:54,380
It won't hurt you
To come in.

619
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:58,990
Would you like a drink ?
Yes, please.

620
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:02,990
What'll it be ?
Uh, whiskey.

621
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,170
Yeah ! Hey !

622
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:13,800
Come on, dil !
Somebody out there.

623
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,310
Jesus fucking christ.

624
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:19,940
Hey, dil !

625
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:23,950
Hey, stirling fucking moss !
It's dave !

626
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:27,850
Come on, dil, talk to me !
Sure, dave.

627
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:30,260
Come on ! Hey, dil-

628
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,160
Hey, they're my clothes !
Take your clothes...

629
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,160
Don't throw my clothes out the window !
And fuck off...

630
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,530
Back to essex !
Fuckin' mad !

631
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:44,370
Don't chuck
My clothes out !

632
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,480
Take your
Fucking goldfish too !

633
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,480
My fuckin' fish !

634
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,330
Murderer !

635
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,560
Sorry.

636
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,570
How does he drive with his neck in a brace ?
Must be in love to manage that.

637
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,200
Doesn't know the meaning
Of the word.

638
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,210
Did he live here with you ?
He tried to.

639
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,650
Sit down, will you ?

640
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,090
What about him ?

641
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:30,820
He was different.

642
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,430
How different ?

643
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:36,400
As different
As it's possible to be.

644
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,370
Tell me about him.

645
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:43,370
No.

646
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,910
Shouldn't I go ?

647
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:50,910
Yes.

648
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,400
No.

649
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,840
Did you do that to him ?

650
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,840
You want to know how I kissed him ?
Yes.

651
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:23,780
Are you jealous ?
Maybe.

652
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:28,620
That's good.

653
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:24,420
What would he think ?

654
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:28,420
He can't think.
He's dead.

655
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:36,330
In ireland.
He was a soldier.
Went there like a fool.

656
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,800
Do you miss him ?
What do you think ?

657
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,810
- I think you do.
- you say that
Like a gentleman.

658
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:51,580
Do I ?
Like you're concerned.

659
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,960
You can't stay.
You know that.

660
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,800
Didn't think I could.

661
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,800
Real gentleman.

662
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:16,040
Shouldn't you be in mourning ?
I am.

663
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:40,270
There'll be bluebirds
Over

664
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:47,040
The white cliffs
Of dover...

665
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,510
Look, dil, I'm sorry.
Fuck off, dave.

666
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:51,280
No, I won't
Fucking fuck off.

667
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,020
I said I'm sorry, didn't I ?
Yeah. I heard.

668
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:58,620
You hear, jimmy ?

669
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:02,490
I was only gonna ask her
For a dance.

670
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:04,230
Shall we ?

671
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:05,760
Bah bah doo-wah

672
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,770
There'll be love
And laughter

673
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,840
Did he come here too ?

674
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,850
Is this an obsession of yours ?
Maybe.

675
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,120
He did, sometimes.

676
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,280
Did he dance with you ?

677
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:28,050
What do you want with me,
Jimmy ?

678
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:32,060
I want to look after you.
What does that mean ?

679
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:35,500
It's something I heard
Someone say once.

680
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,070
You mean that ?
Yeah.

681
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,940
Why ?

682
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,970
If I told you,
You wouldn't believe me.

683
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,980
The valley will bloom
Again

684
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,490
Johnny will go to sleep

685
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:02,260
In his room
There's room again

686
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:08,500
There'll be love
And laughter

687
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:14,040
You're not havin' me on,
Are you ?

688
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:18,040
'Cause dil
Can't stand that.

689
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,980
No.

690
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:23,980
She does get very upset.

691
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:29,090
Just you wait

692
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:32,730
And

693
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:36,730
See ooh ooh ooh

694
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:53,950
One for him too.

695
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:57,420
Drink.

696
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:01,430
What is this ?
I'm superstitious.
Drink.

697
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,170
Can't leave me now.
Aha.

698
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:09,900
The thing is,
Can you go the distance ?

699
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,710
Depends what it is.
Depends on nothing.

700
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,980
In one.

701
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,990
Uhh ! 

702
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:32,460
What you thinkin' of,
Hon ?

703
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:35,500
I'm thinkin' of your man.
Why ?

704
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,670
I'm wonderin' why
You keep his things.

705
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:40,840
I told you.

706
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,770
I'm superstitious.

707
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:47,780
Did he ever tell you
You were beautiful ?

708
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:51,320
All the time.

709
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,590
Even now.

710
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:57,260
What do you mean ?
He looks after me.

711
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:01,260
He's a gentleman too.

712
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:24,650
Wait just one minute.

713
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:57,660
Would he have minded ?

714
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:18,910
You did know, didn't you ?

715
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:23,320
Oh, my god.

716
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:27,660
Jesus, I feel sick.

717
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:31,660
Don't go, jimmy ! Ohh !

718
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:35,900
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

719
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:49,050
What were doing
In the bar
If you didn't know ?

720
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:55,390
Oh, I'm bleeding.

721
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,700
It's all right, jimmy. I can take it.

722
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,700
Just not on the face.

723
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:13,540
See, I'm not a young thing
Any longer.

724
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,150
Funny
The way things go.

725
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,620
Don't you find that,
Jimmy ?

726
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:24,620
Never the way
You expect it.

727
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,490
I'm sorry.

728
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:33,500
You mean that ?
Don't go ! Say something !

729
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,210
Jesus.

730
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:14,780
Now this love may not be
What we're looking for

731
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:18,780
This is not what we are looking for

732
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,820
I almost ran
It was not

733
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:26,820
No, no, no walkin' out that door

734
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:32,330
Forget the future
He's back, col.

735
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,200
Hi.

736
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,230
Don't want any
Of those looks, col.
They don't mean much.

737
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:39,770
- stop it, dil !
- no ! Tell him
To go fuck himself !

738
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:41,740
She wants me to tell you
Go fuck yourself !

739
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,310
I'm sorry.
Tell him to stop
Messin' dil around !

740
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:45,510
Dil !
Tell him it hurts.

741
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:49,480
- I've got to talk to her, col.
- he says he's got to
Talk to you.

742
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,490
Come on, dil.
Where ? Tell him again,
Col, go fuck himself !

743
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,860
Until tomorrow

744
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:02,860
One day soon
I'm gonna tell the moon

745
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:07,170
About the crying game

746
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:14,140
And if he knows

747
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:18,210
Maybe he'll explain

748
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:25,350
Why there are heartaches

749
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:30,290
Why there are tears

750
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:41,770
Come here, darlin' !
Hey ! Hey !

751
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,630
Off you go.

752
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:01,900
How much did that frame cost,
Mr. Franknum ?

753
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,430
200 quid, mr. Deveroux.

754
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:07,370
Well, your bloody pat
Has just cost me 200 quid.

755
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:11,370
Sorry. Sorry isn't gonna
Bring the bloody
Thing back, is it ?

756
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:14,280
Not in my experience.
No.

757
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:19,620
Off his wages.
Do you mean that ?

758
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:23,620
He wants to know whether I mean it, mr. Franknum.
I'm sure you do.

759
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,560
Bloody right I do.

760
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,990
Well, is that pat's tart ?

761
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:33,160
Does pat have a tart ?
She's not a tart.

762
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:37,170
No, of course not. She's a lady.
No, she's not that either.

763
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:54,190
Darlin'. Never let the sun
Go down on an argument,

764
01:08:54,190 --> 01:08:58,190
As jody used to say.
What are you doing here ?

765
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:59,930
Got your note.

766
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:02,700
So let's kiss and make up, honey.
Don't call me that.

767
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,730
Sorry, darling.
Stop it, dil.

768
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:06,970
Apologies, my sweet.

769
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:13,540
That's more like it, dear.
Have a cuppa.

770
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:22,320
You're somethin' else, dil.
You know that ?

771
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,620
Never said a truer word.

772
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,890
I was always best
Lookin' after someone.

773
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:30,560
- must be something
In the genes.
- must be.

774
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,800
And the fact that
You didn't know...

775
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,370
Is basically the fault
Of yours truly.

776
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:38,370
And even when
You were throwin' up,
I could tell you cared.

777
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:43,140
- you could ?
- do you care, jimmy ?

778
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,450
Yeah. Sure I do.

779
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:49,650
You mean that ?
Yeah.

780
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:51,420
I care, dil.

781
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:58,160
Are you crying ?

782
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,800
I'm tired and emotional.

783
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,610
Do it on your own time, pat.
What ?

784
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:13,510
Whatever it is
She does for you.

785
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:15,210
If I was her,
I'd consider that
An insult.

786
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:19,220
Consider it how you like.
Just get the bloody tart
Out of here !

787
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:25,990
Didja ever
Pick your teeth up
With broken fingers ?

788
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:28,830
What's that
Supposed to mean ?

789
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:32,830
A simple question.

790
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:39,840
- come on, dear.
- he didn't answer, honey.

791
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:45,080
Sorry about that, mr. Deveroux.

792
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,920
My, oh my, jimmy, how gallant.
Shut up.

793
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,250
Made me feel all funny inside.
I said stop it.

794
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:53,850
Ask to meet me again,
Jimmy.

795
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:57,830
Do you think that's wise ?
Nothing's wise.

796
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:01,830
 I didn't mean to hit you.
I know that.

797
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:06,240
I kinda liked you as a girl.
That's a start.

798
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,710
So, I'm sorry.
So, make it up to me,
Then.

799
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:13,710
How ?
Ask to meet me again.

800
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:18,580
Will you meet me again ?
When ?

801
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,350
Whenever.

802
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:24,160
Tonight.

803
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:39,940
Good night.
See ya later.

804
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:42,280
Do they know ?
Know what, honey ?

805
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,050
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Can't help it.

806
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:49,450
A girl has her feelings.
Thing is, dil,
You're not a girl.

807
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:53,460
Details, baby, details.
So they do know.

808
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:55,990
All right, they do.
Don't.

809
01:11:55,990 --> 01:12:00,000
 I shoulda known,
Shouldn't I ?
Probably.

810
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:04,770
Kinda wish I didn't.
You can always pretend.

811
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:08,310
Ah, that's true.

812
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:10,670
Your soldier knew,
Didn't he ?

813
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:12,510
Absolutely.

814
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:16,510
Won't be quite the same, though, will it ?
Are you pretendin' yet ?

815
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:22,150
I'm workin' on it.

816
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,790
There's dave.

817
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:27,690
He knew too.
Stop it, jimmy.

818
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:31,200
Am I becoming
Repetitious ?

819
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,500
A little. Sorry.

820
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,010
No, don't ask me in.
Please, jimmy.

821
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:42,010
No.
Can't pretend that much.

822
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,080
I miss you, jimmy.
Yeah ?

823
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:49,080
Shoulda stayed a girl.
Don't be cruel.

824
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:53,960
Okay.

825
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,860
Be a good girl.
Go inside.

826
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:01,870
Only if you kiss me.

827
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:15,250
Now are you happy ?
Delirious.

828
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:31,230
Hello, stranger.

829
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:34,270
You vanished.

830
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:37,270
What was it, fergus ?
Did you blow the gaff
On us...

831
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:40,970
Or did you just
Fuck up ?

832
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:43,180
Leave me alone, jude.

833
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:47,180
No. That's the last thing
I'll do.

834
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,600
- you never asked
What happened.
- I heard.

835
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,330
Eddie and tinker died.
I know.

836
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:05,340
Maguire and me got out
By the skin of our teeth,
No thanks to you.

837
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:11,840
What do you think
Of my hair ?

838
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,310
Suits you. Aye.

839
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:17,720
I was sick of bein'
A blond.

840
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,720
I needed a tougher look,
If you know what I mean.

841
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:36,700
Fuck me, fergus.

842
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,440
Am I to take it
That's a no ?

843
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:46,050
We had a court-martial
In your absence.

844
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:48,720
They wanted to
Put a bullet
Through your head.

845
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,550
I pleaded for clemency.

846
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:54,560
Said we should find out
What happened first.

847
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:58,560
So what did happen ?

848
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,100
He ran.

849
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:03,300
I couldn't shoot him
In the back.

850
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,740
Tried to catch him.

851
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:09,740
He made it to the road
And got hit by a saracen.

852
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:14,350
So you did fuck up.
Yes.

853
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:18,180
But you know what
The thing is, fergus ?

854
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,190
No. What is the thing ?

855
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:24,060
You vanished
Quite effectively.

856
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,930
Became mister nobody.

857
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:28,890
You've no idea
How useful that could be.

858
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:32,400
What do you mean ?
We've got some plans
Here...

859
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:36,400
And we'll need
A mister nobody
To execute them.

860
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:38,910
No way, jude. I'm out.

861
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:42,910
You're never out,
Fergus.

862
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:46,950
Maybe you don't care
About yourself, but-

863
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:50,950
Consider the girl, fergus.

864
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:52,560
The wee black chick.

865
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,560
- leave her out of this !
- jesus, fergus !
You're a walkin' cliche.

866
01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:01,370
You know we won't
Leave her out of it.

867
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:05,370
But I'm glad to see
You care.

868
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:07,410
And, I must admit...

869
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:10,780
- I'm curious.
- what the fuck
Do you know, jude ?

870
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:14,610
You fuckin' tell me, boy !

871
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:18,150
She's nobody.
She likes me.

872
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:22,150
Oh, so I suppose a fuck
Is out of the question.

873
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:26,890
You keep your head down,
Fergus.

874
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:28,960
No sudden moves.

875
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,070
And not a whisper
To her.

876
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:36,070
You'll be hearin'
From us.

877
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:42,410
Keep the faith.

878
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,870
He your boyfriend ?

879
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,840
Lucky you.

880
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:13,150
Carnations.

881
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:15,850
What ?
He'd bring me
Carnations.

882
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:19,850
Oh, so I got it wrong, huh ?
Not at all, honey.

883
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:23,860
Don't. Okay.

884
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,630
Come on. Come on.
Why, honey ?

885
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:34,640
Gonna tell me why ?
No.

886
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:40,140
What's wrong, jimmy? You gonna tell me what's wrong ?
No. Not here.

887
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,220
You gonna tell me
What it is ?

888
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:57,530
Ah. What is it ?
You know her,
Jimmy ?

889
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:00,400
Jimmy, is it ?
You know me, jimmy ?

890
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,230
- dil, this is jude.
- you following me ?

891
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:04,900
Yeah ! Just checkin'.

892
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:08,910
Has he been nice to you, dil ?
Ever so nice.
Aren't you, jimmy ?

893
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:13,210
That's good. I'm glad.

894
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:17,220
- young love, as they say.
- absolutely.
The younger the better.

895
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:21,820
- doesn't come much your way,
I suppose.
- don't go lookin' for it, dil.

896
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,360
Well, maybe you'll
Get lucky someday.

897
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,760
Bit heavy on the powder,
Isn't she, jimmy ?

898
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,770
- a girl has to have
A bit of glamour.
- oh, absolutely.

899
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,500
As long
As she can keep it.

900
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:39,510
Isn't that right, james ?

901
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,250
It's her, isn't it ?
What's her ?

902
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:53,960
She's the thing
You had to tell me.

903
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,660
Kind of.

904
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:59,670
I'm sorry, you know that ?
I'm really sorry.

905
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:04,940
- you see that, col ?
- saw it, dil.

906
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:08,040
- "fuck it" is what I say.
- yeah, fuck it.

907
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:12,050
- fuckin' men, col.
- fuck 'em.

908
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:16,850
Fuck you, jimmy !

909
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:38,080
- you could always
Make it up to her.
- how ?

910
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:42,210
When a girl runs out
Like that, she generally
Wants to be followed.

911
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:45,450
She's not a girl, col.

912
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:49,450
Whatever you say.

913
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:05,200
She went that way,
But you go with me.

914
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:37,140
So, it was you
All the time.

915
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:41,150
Who'd you think it was ?
I thought it was dave.

916
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:45,220
And who's dave
When he's at home ?

917
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,220
He's at home.

918
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:51,090
Should blow you away, you know that.
Yeah, I know.

919
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:52,060
Aah ! Ohh !

920
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:55,160
I'm gettin' emotional,
And I don't like gettin'
Fuckin' emotional !

921
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:58,370
You understand, hennessy ?

922
01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:01,070
Yeah. I understand.
Fuck you too.

923
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:02,770
Fuck you.

924
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:04,640
Ah, leave him alone, peter.

925
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,640
- he's in love.
- that right, fergus ?
You in love ?

926
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:11,980
Absolutely.
And what's she like
Between the sheets ?

927
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:15,720
Definitely unusual.
And who is she ?

928
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,690
Just a girl.

929
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:21,690
You know what'll happen
If you fuck up again,
Don't ya ?

930
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:26,000
Yeah, I do, peter.
Good.

931
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:41,450
So, what do you think that is, hennessy ?
A hotel ?

932
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:46,950
It's a knockin' shop.
Tres discreet, huh ?

933
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:50,090
He visits his ladies
Tuesdays and thursday nights...

934
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:54,090
And saturday mornings.
That's his security
In the car beyond.

935
01:21:57,030 --> 01:22:00,800
- who is he ?
- doesn't matter who he is.
He's a legitimate target.

936
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,800
- thank god for that.
- you tryin' to be cynical,
Hennessy ?

937
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:08,410
Hope not. Good.

938
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:12,410
So, what do you think ?

939
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:19,460
Whoever hits him will be hit,
If those men are any good.

940
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:24,460
- and I presume
You can't get inside.
- right.

941
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:28,470
- so it's on the street ?
- right.

942
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:32,200
Kind of suicide, isn't it ?

943
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,270
But then,
I don't have a choice.

944
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:38,480
Oh, you do, fergie.

945
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,110
Of course.

946
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:43,320
I forgot.

947
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,880
Come on.

948
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:49,890
Rehearsal.

949
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:01,440
You keep your mind
On your job, boy.

950
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,440
Then you'll leave her out of it ?
Aye. Then we'll
Leave her be.

951
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:13,320
He's arthritic.
Takes him two minutes
To get to the door.

952
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:20,190
And what if I say no ?
You know what. Go.

953
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:43,580
Pardon me, young man !

954
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:54,430
You were made for this.
Was I ?

955
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:56,100
Perfect !
What happens then ?

956
01:23:56,100 --> 01:24:00,100
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
And what if you don't ?

957
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:04,770
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
You may be right.

958
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:09,540
Stay late at your work
Tomorrow night and I'll
Bring you the gear.

959
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,650
Jude. Yes ?

960
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:17,120
Who is the old geezer ?

961
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:21,120
Some judge.

962
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:35,670
Why'd you follow me, dil ?
I was jealous, jimmy.

963
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:39,680
- you shouldn't be.
- why shouldn't I
Be jealous ?

964
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:46,020
Don't. My makeup.

965
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:55,200
She own you, jimmy ?
Yes.

966
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:59,200
She's from scotland too ?
Yeah, you
Could say that.

967
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:03,910
And you're not gonna tell me more ?
Can't.

968
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:18,020
What you doing, jimmy ?

969
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:23,230
I don't know yet.

970
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:27,370
Do you like me
Even a little bit ?

971
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:34,210
More than that.

972
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:38,940
Come on.
Let's go for a walk.

973
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:42,950
Do something for me, dil ?
Anything.

974
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:46,050
You'd do anything
For me ?

975
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:47,720
I'm afraid so.

976
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:51,730
You got the keys
To the shop ?

977
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:05,010
Want another haircut,
Jimmy ?

978
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:09,010
No.
Come on, sit down.

979
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:19,360
You'd do anything for me ?
Anything.

980
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:24,530
No way.
You said anything,
Dil.

981
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:28,530
A girl has to
Draw the line somewhere.

982
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:32,570
Want to change you to a man.
Why ?

983
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:34,940
It's a secret.

984
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:38,950
Would you like me better that way, jimmy ?
Yes.

985
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:42,220
And you wouldn't leave me ?
No.

986
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:46,220
Do you promise ?
I promise.

987
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:51,890
Go on, then.

988
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:15,350
You want to make me like him ?
No.

989
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:18,820
I want to make you
Into something new...

990
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:22,830
That nobody recognizes.

991
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:38,950
I don't recognize myself.

992
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:44,380
No.
Better in the dark.

993
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:47,690
So it's true, then.
What ?

994
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:51,690
You like me better like this.
Yes.

995
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:06,440
No, no. Dil. Dil.
Come on.

996
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,050
Dil.

997
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:28,730
Turn around.
Turn around.

998
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:37,480
Baby.

999
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,980
What you doin', honey ?

1000
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:45,320
Don't call me that.
Sorry.

1001
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,760
What you doin' ?
Try this on.

1002
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:51,930
Why ? For me.

1003
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:55,930
For you. Yes.

1004
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:04,740
What we doin' here, jimmy ?
Look on it like a honeymoon.

1005
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,260
You a handyman, fergie ?

1006
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:22,630
Take a pride
In my work.

1007
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:26,630
I sincerely hope so.

1008
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:46,560
Tools of the trade,
Now.

1009
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:55,030
And forget about
The girl.

1010
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:09,480
Dil !

1011
01:31:17,690 --> 01:31:21,700
Dil !

1012
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,600
Dil !

1013
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,500
What the fuck
Are you doing here ?

1014
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:28,670
I'm goin' home !
I told you
To stay in the hotel !

1015
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:30,240
I thought you was
Foolin' me.

1016
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,570
I thought you were leavin' me !
I had to go to work !

1017
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:36,110
I stayed all day
In the hotel thinkin'
Every noise was you !

1018
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:39,920
Come on.
There's something you're
Not telling me, jimmy.

1019
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:43,920
Come on !
No !
I'm goin' home.

1020
01:31:44,350 --> 01:31:47,220
Dil ! So tell me !

1021
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:49,460
I was tryin' to get out
Of something !

1022
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:52,600
No ! Tell me
Everything, jimmy !

1023
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:56,600
You- you gotta forget
You ever saw me, dil.

1024
01:31:56,730 --> 01:32:00,200
You mean that ?
Yeah.

1025
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,840
Stop it, would ya ?

1026
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:06,850
Give it over, dil,
For fuck's sake !

1027
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:12,080
I'm sorry. I get nervous.
I've got this blood condition.

1028
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:17,620
Just help me inside, jimmy,
And I'll be all right.

1029
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:34,740
Did you hear
What I said, dil ?

1030
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:49,530
Get my pills.

1031
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:53,530
- what pills ?
- prescription
For my condition.

1032
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:55,430
What condition ?

1033
01:32:55,430 --> 01:32:59,440
My condition. Ennui.

1034
01:33:08,510 --> 01:33:11,320
Are you supposed
To take that many ?

1035
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:15,320
Only in times
Of extreme stress.

1036
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:21,960
See, they all say
Good-bye sometime.

1037
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:23,830
Except for him.

1038
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:26,070
Are you all right, dil ?

1039
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:29,840
I will be.

1040
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,410
Go on.

1041
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:36,410
Good-bye, dil.

1042
01:33:38,850 --> 01:33:42,850
- jimmy. - what ?

1043
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:47,260
Don't go like that.

1044
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:52,200
Can't help what I am.

1045
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:12,190
I knew you had a heart.

1046
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:19,030
Dil, can I tell you
Somethin' ?

1047
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:22,100
I knew your man.

1048
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:24,170
You knew which man ?

1049
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:28,170
Your soldier.
You knew my jody ?

1050
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:33,240
Lifted him from a carnival
Outside belfast.

1051
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:37,180
Held him hostage
For three days.

1052
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:39,420
You knew my jody ?

1053
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:43,420
Are you listenin' ?
Yes.

1054
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:47,860
Got the order to shoot him.

1055
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:51,630
Before I could do it,
He ran.

1056
01:34:51,630 --> 01:34:54,170
Ran into a tank and died.

1057
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:57,000
- died ?
- did you hear me ?

1058
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,010
You killed my jody ?
In a manner of speakin'.

1059
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:06,680
- it was you.
- you should scream.

1060
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:11,320
You should beat my head off.

1061
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:20,660
You killed my jody.
No.

1062
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,300
You didn't ?

1063
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:27,100
I suppose I tried.
Tried.

1064
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:31,110
Don't you want to kill me ?

1065
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:37,110
Bang.

1066
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:44,390
Don't leave me tonight.

1067
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:48,330
Might kill me too.

1068
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:52,330
Okay.

1069
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:02,380
What the fuck ?

1070
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:06,380
So, tell me what
You're doing, jimmy.

1071
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:33,610
Didn't really listen
Last night.

1072
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:36,680
I heard,
But I didn't listen.

1073
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,850
Dil.

1074
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:40,920
That won't do you
No good.

1075
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:44,920
Dil knows
How to tie a body.

1076
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:50,030
I wondered why you came on
To me like that...

1077
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:54,030
When you gave me the look.
He asked me to see
Were you all right !

1078
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:13,520
See, I fix on anyone
Who's nice to me.

1079
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:17,230
Just the littlest bit nice
And I'm yours.

1080
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:18,690
Stop it, dil !

1081
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:22,270
Just don't kick dil
And she'll be touched.

1082
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:26,270
Be nice to her
And she'll be yours forever.

1083
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:32,740
See, I should
Blow you away, jimmy.

1084
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:35,980
But I can't... Yet.

1085
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:37,650
Let me go, dil.
Why ?

1086
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:41,650
- I gotta be somewhere !
- so try and go then.

1087
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,860
Where the fuck is he ?

1088
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:54,070
Christ.

1089
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:56,770
Let me go,
For fuck's sake, dil,

1090
01:38:56,770 --> 01:39:00,140
- or they'll be here.
- let them come, then.

1091
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:04,140
Can't stay here, peter. Drive around once more.
Bollocks.

1092
01:39:05,110 --> 01:39:08,080
See, I just want
Your company...

1093
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:12,090
For a little while
Longer.

1094
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:20,930
That fucker's dead.
No, we are.

1095
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:24,770
You don't know
What you're doin', dil.

1096
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:28,770
Never did.

1097
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:39,050
Shit. Give me the shooter.
What ? You're crazy !

1098
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:43,460
Give me the fuckin' shooter, jude !
Peter !

1099
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:48,630
Peter !

1100
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:39,920
I know
All there is to know

1101
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:44,220
About the crying game

1102
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,930
I've had my share
You like me now, jimmy ?

1103
01:40:50,930 --> 01:40:54,800
Of the crying game...
Yeah, I like you, dil.

1104
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,240
Give me a bit more, baby.
A bit more.

1105
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:02,240
More what ?
More endearments.

1106
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:05,980
I like you, dil.
Love me.

1107
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:09,180
Yeah.
Tell me you love me.

1108
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:13,190
Whatever you say, dil.
Then say it.

1109
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,890
I love you, dil.

1110
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:17,990
You do ?

1111
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:21,530
One day soon I'm gonna tell the moon
Yeah.

1112
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:25,540
About the crying game
What would you do
For me ?

1113
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:29,440
Anything.

1114
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,250
And if he knows
Say it again.

1115
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:36,250
Maybe he'll explain
I'd do anything
For ya, dil.

1116
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:43,090
Why there are heartaches

1117
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:49,930
Why there are tears

1118
01:41:49,930 --> 01:41:53,930
You'd never leave me ?
And what to do
To stop feelin' blue

1119
01:41:54,570 --> 01:41:57,010
Never.
When love disappears

1120
01:41:57,010 --> 01:42:01,010
I know you're lying, jimmy,
But it's nice to hear it.

1121
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:09,750
I'm sorry.

1122
01:42:17,530 --> 01:42:20,530
You stupid shit !

1123
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:23,330
Once was bad enough,
But twice ?

1124
01:42:23,330 --> 01:42:27,140
You didn't knock, honey.

1125
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:29,910
- dil !
- get that thing
Off me, fergus !

1126
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:31,080
What was that
She called you, jimmy ?

1127
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:34,480
Fergus ! It's my name, dil !
What's fergus ?

1128
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:37,350
- what happened to jimmy ?
- I said get her off !

1129
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:41,150
- what's she gonna do, jimmy ?
She gonna blow you away ?
- dil !

1130
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:43,820
- dil !
- was she there too
When you got my jody ?

1131
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:47,830
- dil !
- I asked you a question.
Were you there too ?

1132
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:51,370
You sick bitch.

1133
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:52,840
Dil !
You was there, wasn't you ?

1134
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:56,500
You used those tits
And that ass
To get him, didn't you ?

1135
01:42:56,500 --> 01:43:00,510
Aah ! Dil !

1136
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,880
She was there, wasn't she ?
She was.

1137
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:13,360
She used her tits
And that cute little ass
To get him, didn't she ?

1138
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:17,100
Yes.

1139
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:21,100
Tell me what she wore.

1140
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:26,540
Can't remember.

1141
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:39,920
I can't do it, jimmy.

1142
01:43:39,990 --> 01:43:43,990
He won't let me.

1143
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:55,540
You won't let me, jody.

1144
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,270
You've got to go now,
Dil.

1145
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:23,030
Do I ? Yes.

1146
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:24,700
Now.

1147
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:28,570
Am I in trouble, jimmy ?
Not if you go.

1148
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:31,380
Will I see you again ?
Yes.

1149
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:35,380
Promise ? Promise.

1150
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:39,390
Where am I to go, jimmy ?
The metro.

1151
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:42,890
And meet col. Yeah.

1152
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:46,900
Say hello to col.

1153
01:45:32,110 --> 01:45:36,120
You shoulda stayed at home.

1154
01:46:26,070 --> 01:46:29,740
I got the multivitamins
And the iron tablets, hon.

1155
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:32,080
- don't call me that.
- sorry, love.

1156
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:34,380
The white one's magnesium supplement.
Stop it, dil.

1157
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:38,390
I've got to keep you
Healthy, jimmy.
I'm counting the days.

1158
01:46:39,150 --> 01:46:42,590
Two thousand,
Three hundred
And thirty-four left.

1159
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:45,360
- thirty-five.
- I'm sorry, darlin'.

1160
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,760
I keep forgetting
The leap year.

1161
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:50,170
Dil.
What am I supposed to
Call you then, jimmy ?

1162
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:54,170
- fergus. - fergus.

1163
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:58,370
Fergus. My love.
Light of my life.

1164
01:46:58,370 --> 01:47:02,380
Please, dil.
Can't help it.
You're doing time for me.

1165
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:07,620
No greater love,
As the man says.

1166
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:09,450
I wish you'd tell me why.

1167
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:13,090
As a man said,
It's in my nature.

1168
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:15,560
What's that supposed
To mean ?

1169
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,530
Well...

1170
01:47:17,530 --> 01:47:19,900
There's this scorpion,
You see,

1171
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:22,540
And he wants to go
Across a river.

1172
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:25,040
Well, he can't swim,
So...

1173
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:29,040
He goes to this frog,
Who naturally enough can swim,
And he says, uh...

1174
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:33,550
"excuse me, mr. Froggy. I want to go across the river."
Sometimes it's hard to be

1175
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:38,750
A woman

1176
01:47:38,750 --> 01:47:39,920
So the frog
Accepts the idea.

1177
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:43,930
Scorpion hops on the frog's back.
Givin' all your love
To just one man

1178
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:50,300
Suddenly, the frog- "aah !"
He feels this sting !

1179
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:54,300
You'll have bad times
"you stung me !"

1180
01:47:54,810 --> 01:47:58,410
He'll have good times
"why did you go
And do that ?"

1181
01:47:58,410 --> 01:48:02,410
And the scorpion looks at him and says,
Doin' things that you don't

1182
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:04,050
Understand

1183
01:48:04,050 --> 01:48:08,050
"I can't help it.
It's in my nature."

1184
01:48:08,450 --> 01:48:11,290
But if you love him

1185
01:48:11,290 --> 01:48:15,290
You'll forgive him

1186
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:21,370
Even though he's hard to understand

1187
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:30,710
And if you love him

1188
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:34,920
Oh, be proud of him

1189
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:39,960
'Cause after all he's just a man

1190
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:48,570
Stand by your man

1191
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:52,840
And show the world you love him

1192
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:57,440
Keep givin' all the love you can

1193
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:07,050
Stand by your man

1194
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:43,090
I know all there is to know

1195
01:49:43,230 --> 01:49:47,230
About the crying game

1196
01:49:49,470 --> 01:49:53,070
I've had my share

1197
01:49:53,070 --> 01:49:57,070
Of the crying game

1198
01:49:59,550 --> 01:50:03,550
First there are kisses

1199
01:50:04,450 --> 01:50:07,690
Then there are sighs

1200
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:11,690
And then before you know where you are

1201
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:16,430
You're sayin' good-bye

1202
01:50:19,630 --> 01:50:23,640
One day soon I'm gonna tell the moon

1203
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,010
About the crying game

1204
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:38,820
And if he knows

1205
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:42,830
Maybe he'll explain

1206
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:48,900
Why there are heartaches heartaches

1207
01:50:49,830 --> 01:50:53,540
Why there are tears so sad

1208
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:57,540
And what to do to stop feelin' blue

1209
01:50:58,310 --> 01:51:02,320
When love disappears

1210
01:51:23,370 --> 01:51:27,380
First there are kisses kisses

1211
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:31,980
Then there are sighs so sad

1212
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:35,990
And then before you know where you are

1213
01:51:36,650 --> 01:51:40,660
You're sayin' good-bye

1214
01:51:41,790 --> 01:51:45,800
Don't want no more

1215
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:49,570
Of the crying game

1216
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:53,570
Don't want no more don't want no more

1217
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:59,150
Of the crying game
