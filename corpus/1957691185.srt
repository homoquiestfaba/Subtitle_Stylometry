00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,750
- Just stay. Don't move, okay?
- Okay.

176
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:23,916
Don't move.

177
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,791
So, my brother and I,
we're making this movie,

178
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,500
and it's got music in it.

179
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,166
And when I heard you singing up there,
I was like, "Wow."

180
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,291
(GIGGLES)

181
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,541

00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,458
(PLAYS KAZOO)

183
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,208
All right.

184
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:46,458
Anyway, our movie, my brother Terrell,
he's gonna direct it and I wrote it.

185
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,166
We emailed our script
to a bunch of producers,

186
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,750
but no one seemed interested,

187
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,875
so Terrell read up on
a couple of film blogs that

188
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,583
if you're new or you want to get noticed,
you gotta make a sizzle reel.

189
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,208
A what?

190
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, it's like a little movie
or a part of a movie,

191
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,916
or just something to show
what your big movie will be like.

192
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,291
- Okay.
- And I'm gonna be in it,

193
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,125
but we need a girl for it.

194
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,125
And you could be the perfect girl.

195
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,208
- Um.
- What?

196
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:20,625
I just... I've never acted before.

197
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,250
- But you sing. You sing, right?
- That's true.

198
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,208
So do you write your own stuff?

199
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,458
- Just covers.
- Okay, okay.

200
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,416
We want original songs for the movie,

201
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
but we'll probably do
a cover for the sizzle.

202
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,708
- Okay.
- Yeah.

203
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,083
So, uh, what's the movie about?

204
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:43,291
Oh, it's about this guy,
he's about to graduate high school,

205
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,875
and he's not sure what he wants
to do with his life yet,

206
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,375
and he tries a bunch of different things,
but nothing seems to stick.

207
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,000
And just when he's about to lose hope,

208
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,666
he goes to this party
that he almost didn't go to,

209
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,875
and he meets this girl.

210
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:02,000
And getting to know her
helps him figure things out.

211
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,166
Oh...

212
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,375
So...

213
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:09,000
She's only in the story to help him?

214
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh, no. No, no. No.

215
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,375
Sorry. No, she's not.
She's her own person, definitely.

216
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:19,958
Just getting to know her helps him realize
that he has to figure it out on his own.

217
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,250
She doesn't, like, figure it out for him.
She got her own story to tell.

218
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,458
And it's in the end, the last scene,
the big musical number on the beach,

219
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,625
where he realizes all of this,
that he'd been trying to be the person

220
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,375
that he thought she wanted him to be.

221
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,958
And they sing,

222
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,791
- they dance.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

223
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,750
And then she leaves.

224
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,083
Uh, what's it called?

225
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,416
<i>Tell Your Story.</i>

226
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,458
- What?
- The title is <i>Tell Your Story.</i>

227
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,083
- The title is <i>Tell Your Story.</i> Um...
- Yeah.

228
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,500
Right, that's cool, I like it.
I like it, that's cool.

229
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,833
So my brother works at this club, Forte.

230
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,666
They have a bar, but, you know,
sometimes they let me in through the back.

231
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,791
They have great music, and on Wednesdays,
they have open mic,

232
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,041
so it's a little more lax.

233
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,000
You should come meet him.

234
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Like, hang out?

235
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,333
Yeah. Like, hang out.

00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,791
Okay, okay.

00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:33,125
Okay, I'm putting some
extra cash on that thing.

238

239

and fill them out at work.

00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,583

in Berkeley keeps calling

250

even though I told them I'm unavailable.

251
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:12,791
Anyway, now I know why the other designer
quit and how they wound up with me.

and tell them that.

257
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,250

about this than I need to,

we'll go to the flea market

00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,958
We gotta stand back there
'cause we're not 21.

348
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,375
And that's Iggy.

349
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,666

00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,750
We'll be better when you stop talking.
Am I right?

353
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,125
Thanks, Ken.
It's always great to have you here.

354
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:24,541
All right, thanks for joining us, folks,
at LA's favorite open mic night.

355
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,458
Let us hear it! Come on!

of any of the performances,

357
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,333
please be respectful
of all of our performers.

358
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:36,583
Ken? I'm kind of
looking at you here, buddy.

359
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,166
Come on, you know I love you, Iggs.

360
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,750
If you really loved me, Ken,
you'd drink somewhere else.

361
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:45,125

by Brian Wilson.

393
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,083
And I would like to dedicate
this song to my new friend.

That was amazing.

What?

00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,166
I mean, isn't that why you did that?
As, like, an audition?

Oh, no. No, I just...

437

I just love to sing.

But listen, Terrell,
I would love to be in your movie, really.

439

I just... I've never acted before.

440

Well, I've never made a movie before.

441
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,916
And this is my first script.

442
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,208
I've never been
in a movie before, either, so...

Hey, but look, this is our baby, though,

447
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:56,958
so if you're gonna do this,
you gotta do it all the way.

448
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,708
So...

449
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:06,416

The worst customer in history.

453
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,791
That's Roxanne Martel.

00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,666
- Roxanne Martel. She's a musi...
- Hey.

I'm Iggy. I'm in charge here.

457
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:28,083
That was sensational.
Who exactly are you, again?

458
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:32,291
Star girl. And she's the lead in our movie.

459
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,375
Is she? Congratulations.
Now get her and your brother out of here

460
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:40,000

for letting kids hang out at the bar.

461

- Um, if you can...
- This way.

462
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,041
- Now!
- Thanks.

463
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:51,875
That was amazing!
I knew Terrell would love you.

00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,375
Are you around this weekend?

465
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,333
We can get started
with rehearsing the sizzle.

466
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,750
I still don't totally understand
what that is.

467
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,458
You will. Mostly we need to figure out

468
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,708
what song we'll use
so we can start rehearsing.

469
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:04,583
We need something that feels right
and isn't overplayed.

heard me sing.

was there the other night.

what happened to her.

00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,791
She put out one album
and then just... Nothing.

501
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,416
Like, how do you even do that?

502

so good and then just stop?

aside for months.

You'd wanna deal with table six?

Her name is Roxanne Martel.

540
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,250
And you never know
what someone's been through.

541
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,083
It is really cool that it's about LA.

542
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,041
She does come into the club
early to play piano.

543
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,583
And Forte's not far, you guys can walk.

544

- Call me when you talk to her.
- Oh, I... I don't have a phone.

My mom gave me the album.

we're making this sizzle reel.

Well, it's for this movie
that we're making,

579
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:14,250
so we're making, like,
a small version of the movie

580
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,083
to show what the big one will be like,

581
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:18,041
otherwise people won't give us money
to make it...

I'm gonna be in it.

What?

Let's take a break.

821
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,250
You asked me
why I didn't make another album.

822
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:17,458
It was a bad situation, when I was a kid.

823
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,958
So I left.

824
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:22,916
It was scary.

825
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:25,208
But I always felt better

826
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:30,166
when I found the artists
and musicians, street performers.

827
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,625
With people sharing something.

828
00:56:33,291 --> 00:56:36,958
And my voice got me places.
Clubs, parties.

829
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:39,041
Mostly Forte.

830
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:43,375
And eventually, here.

831
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:49,375
This is where I recorded <i>Miracle Mile.</i>

832
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:54,416
I put everything I had into it. I was 20.

833
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,708
And then,

834
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,916
nobody wanted it.

835
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:07,541
I couldn't separate myself from the work.

836
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:13,958
And I... And I didn't love myself enough
to be okay with failing.

837
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:18,083
I felt like nobody wanted me.

838
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:27,041
So I buried the album,
changed my name, started producing.

839
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:31,083
And it turned out,
I was pretty good at it.

840
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,666
But the most important thing I was able
to do with my success was save Forte.

What do you mean?

842
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,291
A few years back,
the landlords were making it really hard

843
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:47,083
for Iggy to keep it open,
and so I did him a favor.

00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:20,666
That just 'cause it doesn't look like
you thought it would

853
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:23,375

Mm-hmm.

872
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,750
Is that what you're using
to shoot this picture?

873
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:59,416
- Yeah.

874
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:02,250
Don't go away.

875
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:12,375
This is a vintage Bolex 16mm camera.

876
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:16,041
You shoot film on it.
It's the only way to shoot, in my opinion.

877
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,250
It's...

878
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:20,250
It's old, but still works.

879
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:22,708
What?

880
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,791
It's just collecting dust.

881

882
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:32,375
Thank you, Mr. Mitchell. Thank you.

883
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:35,000
You just have to show me
the movie when you've finished it.

884
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:39,333
- Of course. We wrote a song for it, too.
- Uh. (CHUCKLES)

885
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:42,625
Thank you, again. Good night.

886
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,458
Good night.

Action, rehearsal.

891
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:00,083
And on the day, this is when
I'll yell "playback." Come on, Evan.

892
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:02,458
What does "on the day" mean?

893
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:03,583
I don't know.

894
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:05,000
When we shoot it for real.

895
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:06,208
- Oh!
- Oh, okay.

896
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:07,291
Okay.

897
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:10,375
Mark it. And five, six, seven, walking.

898
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:14,125
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, go.

One, two, three, four,

903
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:33,333
And this is when you'll kiss.

904
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:36,958
Okay? I'm good.

905
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:38,916
And that's a cut on rehearsal.

906
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,500
ANA: <i>It was 1992.</i>

907
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:46,291
She was amazing.

908
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:50,083
I bought her tape after the show
and then that was it.

909
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,708
I always wondered what happened.
I can't believe all this.

910
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,000
(CHUCKLES)

911
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:59,750
Why didn't you ever tell me
you lived here?

912
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,666
It wasn't a great time in my life.

913
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:08,125
To be honest,
I don't love talking about it.

914
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:12,500
But Roxanne's music really got me through.

916
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:29,083
Can I get you two anything else?

917
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:31,625
- No, thanks, we're fine.
- Okay.

918
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,416
We're fine.

919
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:38,625
STARGIRL: Thank you, Mr. Mitchell,

920
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:40,166
but I talked to Terrell,

921
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:43,625
and he said we would need to buy the film
and develop it and everything.

922
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:46,458
And we just...

923
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:49,166
We don't have the money for that.

924
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:54,333
- But it was so, so nice of you.
- Sell it.

925
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:56,250
What?

926
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:58,666
I don't know how much you could get,

927
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,166
but buy something else
you need for your picture.

928
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:03,041
I insist.

929
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,583
I can give you, like, 300 for it.

930
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:10,000
Cool.

931
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:12,916

932
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,791

You guys look great!

935
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:32,625
Thank you. Is this okay? My mom made it.

936
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,416
She wanted to be here, but she had work.

937
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,416
- Yes. You look beautiful.
- Thank you, thank you.

- Loose. Loosen up. Okay. (LAUGHS)

The costume looked great
on camera, by the way.

I'm so sad I couldn't be there to see it.

957
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:58,583
I know what making movies is like now.

958
01:04:58,666 --> 01:04:59,666

I didn't get to tell you.

962
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:09,791
Uh, we were able to sell your camera,

963
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:14,875
and we bought a lens and stuff
for the iPhone.

964
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:19,791

a little bit more like a real...

(LAUGHS) No.

Isn't that what producers do?

of my favorite directors.

01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,041
It's <i>Cooley High.</i>

it. He's a legend, and it's iconic.

So, let's talk about
how we make this picture.

a little more work still.

Some character stuff,
some dialogue polishing.

1218
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,500
Yeah.

1219
01:20:56,916 --> 01:20:58,083
Of course.

1220
01:20:59,416 --> 01:21:00,666
I believe in you, too.

1221
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,458
And I can't wait to see it.

1222
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:09,041
Tell Priya I'll sign whatever
she needs to me to sign.

1223
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:10,500
The song is always yours.

1224
01:21:10,916 --> 01:21:13,625
Anything you need to keep the movie going.

1225
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:17,666
Just don't forget me
when you own all the places.

1226
01:21:29,541 --> 01:21:32,125
MR. MITCHELL: <i>You know,
I thought I was done.</i>

1227
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:38,583
I thought I'd just watch my shows,
go to the Gelson's,

1228
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:42,125
and, um, just wait it out.

1229
01:21:44,041 --> 01:21:45,541
I mean, I was always...

1230
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:50,333
I was always so good at,
uh, fixing problems with movies,

1231
01:21:50,416 --> 01:21:53,333
but I was never that good in my own life.

1232
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,666
And you just...

1233
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,250
Well...

1234
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:04,208
You gave me something
that I thought only existed in pictures.

1235
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:06,083
What?

1236
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,625
Well, suddenly,

1237
01:22:08,333 --> 01:22:10,458
I'm the guy that wants to know everything

1238
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:13,000
and everyone.

1239
01:22:13,833 --> 01:22:15,500
And I want them to know me.

1240
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:20,041
And I'm gonna call my son.

1241
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:30,000
If you could leave me
with one piece of advice,

1242
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:33,416
what would it be?

1243
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:38,416
Make mistakes, but don't regret them.

1244
01:22:40,041 --> 01:22:41,166
Learn from them.

1245
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:46,875
Because regrets are the hardest things
to carry when you get older.

1246
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:54,208
Oh, and get yourself a flip phone.

1247
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:57,208
So that you and I can talk.

1248
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:03,000
How else are you gonna tell me
how it goes with your son?

1249
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:04,875
Well, there you go.

1250
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:22,166
I screwed this up.

1251
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,458
Okay? I know I did.

1252
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:29,000
I screwed it up a lot.

1253
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:32,708
But you're great.

1254
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:34,458
You're so great.

1255
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:38,250
You are, like, the most alive person
I've ever met.

1256
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:41,000
(SIGHS)

1257
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:47,541
I stress out about

1258
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:50,500
not being able to support us
or take care of you.

1259
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:52,166
I just... I look at you,

1260
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:58,041
I think, "I made her,
and she's so extraordinary."

1261
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:01,375
So at least I did that right.

1262
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,625
I have done so many things
wrong in my life, but thank God

1263
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:09,708
the thing that mattered most
turned out the best.

1264
01:24:16,458 --> 01:24:19,166
I think about how hard
it must be to have a kid.

1265
01:24:20,666 --> 01:24:24,708
And how much harder
it must be to do it alone.

1266
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:27,833
You think about that?

1267
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:29,500
Sometimes, yeah.

1268
01:24:30,958 --> 01:24:32,958
I know 40-year-olds
who don't think about that.

1269
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:34,208
(LAUGHS)

1270
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:44,625
When I came to LA in the '90s,
when I saw Roxanne,

1271
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:47,625
I was here doing a movie.

1272
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,625
- You were?
- Yeah, I was.

1273
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:53,125
I always wanted to do movies.
It was my dream.

1274
01:24:54,125 --> 01:24:56,041
And the director didn't like my work.

1275
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:59,375
And he ended up not being a nice person,

1276
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:02,875
which is becoming, uh,
a little bit of a theme.

1277
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:04,791
Either way, I got fired.

1278
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:08,875
And I was so sad, so embarrassed.

1279
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,125
So I just left LA,

1280
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:15,291
and I felt better.

1281
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:19,208
I thought it was easier
just not to deal with it,

1282
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:22,000
which I know is wrong and terrible, but...

1283
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:26,000
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

1284
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:30,125
It just feels like
it's happening all over again.

1285
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:32,875
And I feel so foolish.

1286
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:36,041
No, Mom.

1287
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:38,000
It's brave.

1288
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:41,125
You were alone.

1289
01:25:42,208 --> 01:25:43,875
But you're not alone anymore.

1290
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:48,041
I don't want you to lose what you
have here. I really don't.

1291
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:49,750
So, then what if we didn't go?

1292
01:25:51,208 --> 01:25:53,666
Daphne said that she would give us
the month free.

1293
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:57,916
It's not the rent. I have rent.
I don't have a job.

1294
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,875
- You'll find one.
- What if I don't?

1295
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:02,583
- And what if the Berkeley thing goes away?
- I don't know.

1296
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:08,041
But I will be right by your side,
no matter what happens.

1297
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:13,041
So, I'm asking just this once.

1298
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:16,125
What if we stayed?

1299
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:21,333
<i>'Cause I do what I want,
I say what I feel</i>

1300
01:26:21,416 --> 01:26:23,958
<i>I follow the light to find something real</i>

1301
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:27,541
<i>I hold on to what I have here and now</i>

1302
01:26:28,708 --> 01:26:33,500
<i>Yeah, I know you wear silver coats</i>

1303
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:40,000
<i>But I know we're all,
we're all made of gold</i>

1304
01:26:41,333 --> 01:26:43,125
- (WHOOPING)
- Thank you so much.

1305
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:49,833
Keep it going for Cousin Bryan,
singing the same song

1306
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:53,708
- he sings every single week.
- (CHEERING)

1307
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:58,375
All right. I am so excited to bring
this next group to the stage.

1308
01:26:58,458 --> 01:27:02,125
It's actually their first time
performing together, so be nice.

1309
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:07,041
Big round of applause
for Table Six and the Shirley Temples.

1310
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:08,541
Let 'em hear it.

1311
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:10,666
(CHEERING)

1312
01:27:23,208 --> 01:27:27,791
So, I'm sitting at my table
like I do every night...

1313
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:29,333
Table six forever.

1314
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:32,416
As I was saying, I'm sitting at my table

1315
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:35,000
and Iggy comes up to me
and tells me I need to go outside.

1316
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:36,916
- It's really important.
- (LAUGHTER)

1317
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,166
I was annoyed.

1318
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:43,333
But then I get out there
and it's this kid.

1319
01:27:44,458 --> 01:27:46,750
When I saw it was this kid,
I wasn't so mad anymore.

1320
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:48,583
She has that effect on us grumps.

1321
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:53,541
Hell, she is the first person to get me
on this stage in 15 years.

1322
01:27:54,666 --> 01:27:56,250
(CHEERING)

1323
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,833
Sometimes we just go, you know?

1324
01:28:02,583 --> 01:28:06,041
And we go, and we go, and we go.

1325
01:28:07,291 --> 01:28:08,500
She made me stop.

1326
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:12,708
She made me look.

1327
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:16,833
Sometimes it's that simple.

1328
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:25,708
(SIGHS)

1329
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:30,541
The first time I was up here,
I had just gotten to LA.

1330
01:28:31,958 --> 01:28:37,125
And all I wanted was to stay somewhere
long enough to make some real friends.

1331
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:40,000
And I got more than that.

1332
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:44,833
Something I never expected.

1333
01:28:46,916 --> 01:28:47,916
I got a home.

1334
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:52,541
I've always had a family,

1335
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:54,958
just my mom and me, and...

1336
01:28:56,083 --> 01:28:58,958
we've gotten each other through a lot.

1337
01:29:01,416 --> 01:29:03,250
But we've never had a home.

1338
01:29:03,875 --> 01:29:06,166
And I don't mean a building.

1339
01:29:07,666 --> 01:29:12,708
Home is somewhere you feel safe
to dream crazy things,

1340
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:15,875
and the people there are crazy enough
to dream them with you.

1341
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:19,041
But also

1342
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:22,291
be there for you when things
don't turn out the way you hoped.

1343
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:28,791
My home turned out to be
a random bunch of people.

1344
01:29:29,541 --> 01:29:33,250
And now I never want to be
without them again.

1345
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,291
And so...

1346
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,500
we're staying.

1347
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,250
My mom and I are staying.

1348
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:46,041
- Yeah, we are!
- (LAUGHTER)

1349
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:47,291
Do you hear that, Evan?

1350
01:29:47,375 --> 01:29:49,250
Oh, I hear it, and I love it.

1351
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:55,333
I'm staying in LA. I'm staying in LA.

1352
01:29:55,416 --> 01:29:57,166
It's my home. It's my home.

1353
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,791
And I'm making a movie in my home.

1354
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:01,833
Big cheer.

1355
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:03,333
(ALL CHEERING)

1356
01:30:05,041 --> 01:30:07,000
And I'm getting a flip phone.

1357
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:08,375
Yes.

1358
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:10,333
(LAUGHTER)

1359
01:30:10,416 --> 01:30:15,666
So, here is one of Roxanne's,
and my old favorites.

1360
01:30:16,125 --> 01:30:19,416
And this one
is for all the dreamers out there.

1361
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:21,916
