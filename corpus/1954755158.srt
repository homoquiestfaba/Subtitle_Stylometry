1
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:52,023
Mr. and Mrs. Dargon.

2
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:53,824
- Detective.
- Detective.

3
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:56,193
Are you okay?

4
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:01,130
Do you remember
Mr. And Mrs. Dargon?

5
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:02,731
Glen and Marcy.

6
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,633
Are we doing first names?

7
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:07,368
We talked on the phone
from the hospital, right?

8
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,170
Yes, we called
as soon as we heard.

9
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:11,004
We tried to come
and see you, but...

10
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:13,640
but they wouldn't let us
until the test came back.

11
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:17,676
So, here you are.

12
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:18,710
Okay.

13
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:20,545
Hi.

14
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:22,046
Hi.

15
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:24,581
Well, charges have
been pressed,

16
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:27,517
and McKay will be held
without bail.

17
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:29,852
So far, her hospital records
are clean,

18
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:32,088
although she did refuse
to take a full examination.

19
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:33,822
That's private.

20
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:35,056
Of course.

21
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:36,724
As discussed,

22
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:38,392
she's to meet with
a court-appointed psychologist

23
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:39,993
once a week, more if needed.

24
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:43,062
Dr. Andrews... here's her card.

25
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,497
This should calm down.

26
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:45,832
We petitioned
for a protective order

27
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,265
on your behalf,

28
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:48,567
and that should be settled
by tomorrow.

29
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,168
Thank you.

30
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:52,002
I only wish we could
have met sooner.

31
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:54,105
Thank you.

32
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:57,107
Take care of yourself.

33
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:06,848
Can I hug you?

34
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:09,417
Um... sure.

35
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:17,523
You're real...

36
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:19,624
you're really here.

37
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:26,930
Welcome home.

38
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,737
Is it okay
if we stop hugging?

39
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:38,772
Yes, of course.

40
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:44,077
You're so big.

41
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:45,445
Would you like
something to drink?

42
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:46,879
I have lemonade.

43
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,547
And tea.

44
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:49,748
Water.

45
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:52,483
Coming right up.

46
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:54,751
Please, make yourself
comfortable.

47
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:55,752
Here, let me...
I'll take...

48
00:03:55,853 --> 00:03:56,753
No.

49
00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:58,655
Okay.

50
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:26,177
Is this you?

51
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:27,710
Yes.

52
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:33,015
And him?

53
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:36,317
Yes.

54
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:38,486
And this.

55
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:40,320
This is me, then.

56
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:42,756
Yes.

57
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:44,557
There you go.

58
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:49,127
You look so young.

59
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:52,730
I was.

60
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:03,271
I rode horses.

61
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:04,973
Ponies.

62
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:06,274
You had just started.

63
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,875
You were barely four.

64
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:09,443
But you kept asking,

65
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:11,778
and your friend Caroline
had had some lessons,

66
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,148
so of course you couldn't
let it go.

67
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:16,882
Do you remember Caroline?

68
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,850
No.

69
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,952
Your birthdays
were ten days apart,

70
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:23,487
so we always had
joint parties.

71
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,822
We had costume parties,

72
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:27,457
it being so close
to Halloween.

73
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:29,459
You were always a princess
for your birthday

74
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:32,294
and something else
for Halloween.

75
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:36,364
Isn't my birthday
March 15th?

76
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:40,000
No, it's October 21st.

77
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:44,136
I celebrate it on March 15th.

78
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:45,538
You see...

79
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,739
Um...

80
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,040
Yeah, here's another one.

81
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,977
So you're about to, um,
blow out the candles,

82
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:57,647
and here are the pumpkins
and leaves on the ground.

83
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:59,315
Oh.

84
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:05,653
We made a cheese plate,
if you're hungry.

85
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:06,988
And there's a pie in the oven.

86
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,356
Do you still like pie?

87
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:10,690
Sure.

88
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,359
Please, sit,

89
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,927
and make yourself
comfortable,

90
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:17,563
and let us know if...
if we can get you anything.

91
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:35,043
Leanne.

92
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,379
Leanne is here.

93
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,048
Actually, my name is Leia.

94
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:43,516
- Huh?
- What?

95
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:45,084
My name is Leia.

96
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:47,386
You changed your name?

97
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:49,221
No.

98
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:50,788
We... we named you Leanne.

99
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:53,124
We've always
called you that.

100
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:54,925
I don't remember that.

101
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:56,726
I only know that
my name is Leia

102
00:06:56,827 --> 00:06:58,795
and that I was named
after a princess.

103
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,129
Like from the movie?

104
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,630
What movie?

105
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:04,033
You don't know?

106
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:05,633
Know what?

107
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:06,868
Your name.

108
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,303
It's Leia.

109
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:11,371
Leia.

110
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:14,707
Yes?

111
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:16,809
No, I was just saying it.

112
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,310
Your name.

113
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,650
So tell us about yourself.

114
00:07:30,554 --> 00:07:32,721
I'm tired.

115
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:35,223
Oh, would you like
to lay down?

116
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:36,624
Yes.

117
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:39,360
Oh, you can go right
up to your room.

118
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,939
We didn't have time
to change anything,

119
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,942
but we kept it
like this for you.

120
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:02,978
I hope it's okay.

121
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:07,182
Maybe it's nice, even.

122
00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:08,582
For now.

123
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:15,555
Okay.

124
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:21,192
All right, I'm gonna
let you get settled in.

125
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,060
- Okay.
- Okay.

126
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:35,370
Okay.

127
00:09:57,268 --> 00:10:01,069
I'd like to propose a toast.

128
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,539
To Leanne.

129
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,106
To Leia.

130
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:07,108
We're so happy
to have you home.

131
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:08,776
It's a miracle.

132
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:11,077
Thank you.

133
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,192
I'm sorry, are we being rude?

134
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:31,861
Are you saying Grace?

135
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:34,963
I'm doing a "Dear Universe. "

136
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:37,131
It's a kind of prayer.

137
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:38,532
"Dear Universe, thank you

138
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:40,100
"for the food I'm
going to be eating,

139
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:42,902
"the thoughts I'm
going to be thinking.

140
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:45,938
Thank you for this moment
we are making. "

141
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,373
And then you make wishes.

142
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:50,775
Wishes?

143
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:53,377
Yes.

144
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,412
"I wish for you
to keep me honest,

145
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:56,780
help me to know who I am,"

146
00:10:56,881 --> 00:11:00,282
and anything else you want.

147
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:01,884
"Sincerely, Leia. "

148
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,786
And you can add a P.S.
if you feel necessary.

149
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:07,155
What church is that?

150
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:08,822
No church.

151
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:11,625
Church is for people who
can't believe in themselves.

152
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:15,228
The Universe is for when
you believe in everything.

153
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,567
Thank you.

154
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:28,004
You must be hungry.

155
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,806
Been quite a few days.

156
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:33,408
The police, the hospital...

157
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,977
Hospital food can't be that good.

158
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:37,745
And all the beeping.

159
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:40,013
Who can eat with
all that beeping?

160
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:45,084
I remember when I was
at the hospital

161
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:46,652
after I had had you.

162
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:48,254
And they brought me some food,

163
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:51,289
and I couldn't even recognize it.

164
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,757
It was like astronaut food,
I swear.

165
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:56,093
The only thing that I would eat
was the Jell-O...

166
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:57,427
I remember that.

167
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:58,427
Because the rest
of it was just so...

168
00:11:58,529 --> 00:11:59,829
No, I remember that,

169
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,030
because I had a pack
of Rollo's in my pocket

170
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:02,931
that you went
absolutely nuts for.

171
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:04,165
- That's right, that's right.
- I mean, she went bananas.

172
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,800
Well, I was starving.

173
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:07,101
I'd never seen anybody...

174
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:09,036
I was starving, because...

175
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:10,437
Go through a half a pack
of Rollo's before like that.

176
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:11,938
Because after you give birth,

177
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:12,972
they should have a turkey dinner
waiting for you.

178
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,531
Hello?

179
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,033
Hi.

180
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,167
Yeah, she's right here.

181
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,736
It's Jill.

182
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,540
Hello?

183
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,542
Great.

184
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:02,878
Thank you.

185
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:05,480
Uh-huh.

186
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:08,149
I know.

187
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,517
I know, I was thinking
the same thing.

188
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:13,720
She would be so happy.

189
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:16,355
Would you like to talk to her?

190
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:18,924
Hold on.

191
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:23,094
Um, Leia, this is your Aunt Jill
on the phone.

192
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:25,796
Why don't you say hello?

193
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,201
So... so say hello.

194
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:33,902
Hello?

195
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:38,939
Okay.

196
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:45,945
Congratulations for you too.

197
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:52,850
Okay.

198
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,023
I think she's done talking.

199
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:03,859
Oh, okay.

200
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,859
I should go.

201
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,928
Hello... already?

202
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:08,363
Okay.

203
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:09,930
Jill?

204
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:11,898
Yeah, she's tired.

205
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,767
I'll see you tonight.

206
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:17,069
- I'll see you tonight.
- Of course.

207
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:23,240
Okay, so would you describe
your first week at home

208
00:14:23,341 --> 00:14:26,276
as a positive experience?

209
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:28,878
Sure.

210
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:30,813
I notice you say that a lot.

211
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:32,581
"Sure. "

212
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:34,216
We just met.

213
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:37,451
Yes, but over
the last half hour,

214
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:38,552
"Would you like to sit?"

215
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:41,154
"Can I get you some tea?"

216
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,223
"Have you been sleeping
on a regular schedule?"

217
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:45,324
"Do you find yourself adapting
to your new surroundings?"

218
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:48,594
All these are things
you answered "sure" to.

219
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:51,729
Maybe you should ask
different questions.

220
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,331
Maybe you're right.

221
00:14:54,432 --> 00:14:57,834
How would you describe
your first week at home?

222
00:14:57,935 --> 00:15:02,271
As a positive experience.

223
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:05,974
Do I make you uncomfortable?

224
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:07,775
No.

225
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:11,311
Do I make you uncomfortable?

226
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:13,513
Of course not.

227
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:15,481
Okay.

228
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,582
"Sure" is a noncommittal
statement,

229
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:18,950
even in the affirmative.

230
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,619
If I say,
"Do you want some tea?"

231
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,119
and you say, "Sure,"

232
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,021
it tells me that you want tea

233
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:27,424
only because I asked it,
not because you want it.

234
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,993
I want you to feel free
to express definites,

235
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:31,860
concrete feelings.

236
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:34,296
This is a safe environment.

237
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:35,863
Okay.

238
00:15:35,964 --> 00:15:37,532
I don't really want this tea.

239
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:47,106
Everything you say here
is confidential.

240
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,541
You keep writing things
in that folder.

241
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:52,676
I keep notes.

242
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:55,713
But you are looking
for things, right?

243
00:15:55,814 --> 00:15:57,680
Against Ben.

244
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:00,616
Are you concerned about Ben?

245
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:02,651
Are you looking for things?

246
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,954
My only true concern
is how you are doing,

247
00:16:06,055 --> 00:16:08,189
how you are feeling,

248
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,491
that you feel supported.

249
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:13,359
Okay.

250
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:15,894
If there's anything I can do
to make that clearer to you,

251
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:17,463
do not hesitate to tell me.

252
00:16:17,564 --> 00:16:19,098
I am here for you.

253
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:23,901
Can you stop calling it "home?"

254
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:26,737
Like, my "transition back home?"

255
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:27,838
All right.

256
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:29,739
Does it not feel like home?

257
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,842
Would a place you don't remember
feel like home to you?

258
00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:36,311
How does it feel?

259
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,979
Like a place I don't remember,

260
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,048
like a neighbor's house.

261
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:43,483
Did you spend much time
at neighbor's houses

262
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:47,686
when you were with Mr. McKay?

263
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:48,987
No.

264
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:51,289
I spent time at home.

265
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:20,378
Want some dessert?

266
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:34,923
You don't have to look at that.

267
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:37,992
It's just...
it's just there.

268
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:41,494
Can I have this?

269
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:44,230
No.

270
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,299
Or not right now, okay?

271
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,967
Congratulations, God bless.

272
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,968
I've been following on the
news and everything

273
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,436
from the very beginning.

274
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,905
- So inspiring.
- Thank you.

275
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,605
You are so inspiring.

276
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:57,440
You must be so happy
to be home.

277
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:58,675
You holding up okay?

278
00:17:58,776 --> 00:17:59,809
Fine, thanks.

279
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,177
Oh, I bet you are.

280
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:02,178
Just excuse me.

281
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,678
You are in our prayers.

282
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:05,780
I hope that monster gets
everything he deserves.

283
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:06,915
Don't you worry.

284
00:18:07,016 --> 00:18:09,349
Thank you, thank you.

285
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,084
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

286
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,759
I'm sorry about that.

287
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,294
People have
a lot of questions,

288
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,696
and sometimes it gets
the better of them.

289
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:29,265
Questions about what?

290
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:31,300
Well...

291
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:35,037
about you and
how you're doing,

292
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:39,173
what you went through...

293
00:18:39,274 --> 00:18:42,275
how you survived.

294
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:44,177
Survived what?

295
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:48,047
The unknown, I guess.

296
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,584
I could ask everyone else
the same question.

297
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:38,852
You're ruining it!

298
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,554
You're ruining everything!

299
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:43,155
Hey, don't say that.

300
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:44,523
Ruiner!

301
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,525
Leia, that's not very nice.

302
00:19:46,627 --> 00:19:48,493
You are not very nice.

303
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:49,995
Yeah?

304
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:53,497
Who else do you know
that's nicer, huh?

305
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:54,899
No one.

306
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,066
That's right.

307
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:58,401
You're hurting him!

308
00:19:58,502 --> 00:19:59,736
Let's take him
to the hospital.

309
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:01,370
He has to go
to the hospital.

310
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:05,407
Leia, we both know
he can't go to a hospital.

311
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:07,008
And why?

312
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:08,943
- But he has to...
- Leia.

313
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:14,381
Hospitals are bad.

314
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:15,681
Yes.

315
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,082
And why?

316
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,083
You can't just say
something is bad

317
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:22,687
without knowing why.

318
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,055
They have no confidence
in the nature of things

319
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:27,357
and no respect
for the mystery of life.

320
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,925
Yeah.

321
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:32,894
And part of the mystery of life
is death.

322
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:38,132
And part of the nature of things
is accepting that.

323
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:41,035
I don't want him to die.

324
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:46,105
Well, look who's lost
confidence in me, huh?

325
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:50,108
Are you ready for a story?

326
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:51,909
Which one should I read?

327
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,645
<i>How about
The Frog Prince?</i>

328
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:56,147
You can follow...

329
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:58,415
He's fixed.

330
00:20:58,516 --> 00:21:00,783
You fixed him.

331
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,218
That's what I told you
I was doing.

332
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,219
I thought you were
hurting him,

333
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:06,554
like a doctor.

334
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:08,822
No, I was fixing him,

335
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:10,657
like a Ben.

336
00:21:14,995 --> 00:21:16,662
Look at you.

337
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:19,764
You're a mess.

338
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:22,299
I'm not a mess.

339
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,401
You get so worked up.

340
00:21:24,502 --> 00:21:26,003
Sorry.

341
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:28,271
No, you don't
have to apologize.

342
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:30,940
We can't help
what we feel.

343
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,842
But we can help
what we think, right?

344
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:37,511
So why would you think
I would hurt Teddy?

345
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:38,946
I don't know.

346
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,514
You don't know what you think?

347
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:43,850
I thought you were mad at me.

348
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:45,684
Why would I be mad at you?

349
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:48,354
For looking out the window.

350
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:51,923
I was concerned when you were
looking out the window, yeah.

351
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:55,692
I didn't want you
to see something scary.

352
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:57,661
But I fixed it, right?

353
00:21:57,762 --> 00:22:02,964
So, we don't have to worry
about that anymore.

354
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:04,866
I know.

355
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:07,268
But you yelled.

356
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,005
Even if I was mad,

357
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:13,339
I take care of you.

358
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,608
Always.

359
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:19,111
Okay.

360
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,746
Okay.

361
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:03,178
How long does it take trees
to grow?

362
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,415
Maybe 30, 40 years.

363
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:10,551
This has looked like this
for 40 years?

364
00:23:10,652 --> 00:23:12,085
More than that, actually,

365
00:23:12,186 --> 00:23:15,487
because we moved here
almost 25 years ago,

366
00:23:15,588 --> 00:23:17,990
and the trees were big then too.

367
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:26,897
Why does Glen get to leave?

368
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:29,331
Well, he goes to work.

369
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:42,575
We could leave too.

370
00:24:14,468 --> 00:24:16,602
What do you think?

371
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:17,903
You could try it on.

372
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:19,671
Sure.

373
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:26,110
Oh, that looks so pretty.

374
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:28,111
Do you like it?

375
00:24:28,212 --> 00:24:29,378
Do you want to try it

376
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,547
without the other
shirts underneath?

377
00:24:32,648 --> 00:24:34,649
I always wear these.

378
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:48,160
Would to try it?

379
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:49,962
Now...

380
00:24:50,062 --> 00:24:51,629
How is that one?

381
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,931
That's... that's not as tight
as the other one, right?

382
00:24:54,032 --> 00:24:55,265
Good.

383
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:56,399
Do you want me to adjust it?

384
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:57,501
It's adjustable back here.

385
00:24:57,602 --> 00:24:58,602
- No.
- No?

386
00:24:58,703 --> 00:25:00,302
Okay, great.

387
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:02,471
Great.

388
00:25:02,572 --> 00:25:05,507
Well, I think that
should work better

389
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:06,508
under the clothes.

390
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:08,675
I can do it.

391
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,644
Okay.

392
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:12,012
Okay.

393
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,817
Don't... don't forget...

394
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:21,685
don't forget to come out
and show me.

395
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,021
If... if you want to.

396
00:25:48,608 --> 00:25:50,975
It was... it was really nice.

397
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:54,444
I think she liked the
clothes that we found.

398
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:56,680
She looked great in them,

399
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:59,482
really beautiful.

400
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:03,118
I hope she liked them.

401
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:05,687
Good.

402
00:26:05,788 --> 00:26:09,190
See?
It's good.

403
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:12,125
Yeah, it's good.

404
00:26:12,226 --> 00:26:14,194
She's...

405
00:26:16,496 --> 00:26:20,199
She's sweet.

406
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,966
Dear Universe,

407
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:24,669
thank you for the thoughts
I'm going to be thinking.

408
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,737
Thank you for the dreams
I'm going to be dreaming.

409
00:26:27,838 --> 00:26:31,173
Thank you for this moment
we are making.

410
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:32,875
I wish for you
to keep me honest

411
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:36,177
and to keep an eye on Ben.

412
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:38,579
Sincerely, Leia.

413
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:30,253
Leia?

414
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:32,054
Good morning.

415
00:28:10,318 --> 00:28:11,685
Leia?

416
00:28:14,054 --> 00:28:15,955
Leia!

417
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,597
Leia.

418
00:28:26,698 --> 00:28:27,864
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

419
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:28,731
I... I... I...

420
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:31,400
I didn't see you out there.

421
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,634
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

422
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:34,603
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

423
00:28:40,142 --> 00:28:42,242
You know what we're
gonna do today?

424
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:43,710
We're gonna get you
an ID card

425
00:28:43,811 --> 00:28:46,612
so that...

426
00:28:46,713 --> 00:28:48,681
so that you have
an ID card.

427
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:51,482
Okay.

428
00:28:57,021 --> 00:28:59,188
Salem, Pennsylvania.

429
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:03,491
Department
of Motor Vehicles.

430
00:29:09,197 --> 00:29:13,733
What does "Louise" mean?

431
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:15,668
It's your middle name.

432
00:29:47,627 --> 00:29:49,561
It's work.

433
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,333
Okay.

434
00:29:57,434 --> 00:29:59,836
Whatever it is,

435
00:29:59,937 --> 00:30:04,706
I think we should just
try to be more...

436
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:06,841
than we were.

437
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:09,110
We already are.

438
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:11,778
We already are
more than we were.

439
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,009
Leia?

440
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,344
You okay in there?

441
00:30:53,445 --> 00:30:55,012
Oh, oh, okay,
okay, I'll get it.

442
00:30:55,113 --> 00:30:56,413
- Sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no.

443
00:30:56,514 --> 00:30:57,414
It's alright.
Here.

444
00:30:57,515 --> 00:30:58,982
Careful.
I'll get it,

445
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,216
I'll get it, I'll get it.
There we go.

446
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,551
It's all fine, it's all fine.

447
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,319
I like the bread warm.

448
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:05,319
That's okay.

449
00:31:05,421 --> 00:31:06,421
How do we... let's see.

450
00:31:06,522 --> 00:31:08,089
I like it toasty, sorry.

451
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,923
That's all right.

452
00:31:10,024 --> 00:31:11,892
It'll... it'll go off
in just a second.

453
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:15,327
This happens all the time.

454
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,764
There we go.
Okay.

455
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:21,666
There we go.

456
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:24,268
- Sorry.
- No, that's fine.

457
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:29,439
So... for next time,
there's a toaster.

458
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,274
You know.

459
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,108
So you could toast
the bread first,

460
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:36,410
and then make the sandwich.

461
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:38,746
Oh, yeah.

462
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:41,181
Here, let's start again.

463
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:43,917
Okay, here we go.

464
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:46,118
And...

465
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:47,753
Here you go.

466
00:31:57,562 --> 00:31:58,762
Mm-hmm.

467
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:00,596
Now turn it on.

468
00:32:07,236 --> 00:32:08,902
There we go.

469
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:10,971
- Oh, right.
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:19,478
Mr. McKay didn't
have a kitchen?

471
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:22,546
We had a kitchen, obviously.

472
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:24,048
Just, I never went
in there.

473
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:26,549
It was in a different
part of the house.

474
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,119
Ben always cooked for me.

475
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:33,155
Mr. McKay.

476
00:32:33,256 --> 00:32:35,890
So you never left
the basement at all?

477
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:38,559
You weren't allowed
in other parts of the house?

478
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,327
We didn't call it a basement.

479
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:42,529
It was where we lived.

480
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:46,765
I'm sorry.

481
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:48,300
That's okay.

482
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:52,403
It's an honest mistake.

483
00:32:52,505 --> 00:32:54,404
What is?

484
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,540
Calling it a basement.

485
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,244
No, I meant,
about everything.

486
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:03,578
I'm...

487
00:33:05,448 --> 00:33:08,983
I'm sorry about everything.

488
00:33:09,084 --> 00:33:10,918
It's okay.

489
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:12,585
You're trying.

490
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,501
Thank you for doing this
with me.

491
00:33:32,602 --> 00:33:36,337
It's supposed
to be therapeutic,

492
00:33:36,438 --> 00:33:38,273
meditative.

493
00:33:53,318 --> 00:33:56,387
You used to love beads.

494
00:33:56,487 --> 00:33:58,721
Your Aunt Jill
had a bead shop

495
00:33:58,822 --> 00:34:01,123
before she moved
to Santa Fe,

496
00:34:01,224 --> 00:34:02,891
and you loved
to go in there

497
00:34:02,992 --> 00:34:06,427
and sink your hands deep
into the bins of glass beads.

498
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,199
I wanted to get you some,

499
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,500
but I was always afraid
you'd eat them

500
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:15,868
when I wasn't looking.

501
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:25,542
What are you making?

502
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:27,444
A string of beads.

503
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,025
So I have room
for about six more,

504
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,261
but I have ten beads left.

505
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:51,028
Which...

506
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:53,431
which ones do you think
I should leave out?

507
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:59,069
Any of them.

508
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,102
Well, help me out.

509
00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:02,271
Which ones do you think?

510
00:35:05,174 --> 00:35:06,407
I know things.

511
00:35:06,508 --> 00:35:07,508
Oh, I know.

512
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,943
I wasn't nothing to him.

513
00:35:10,044 --> 00:35:12,746
He raised me.

514
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:15,114
Okay.

515
00:35:18,718 --> 00:35:22,120
Also, "ones" isn't a word.

516
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:44,937
What is that?

517
00:35:45,038 --> 00:35:46,071
What?

518
00:35:46,172 --> 00:35:47,706
That.

519
00:35:47,807 --> 00:35:49,674
Oh, that, wow.

520
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:51,042
Maybe you better open it.

521
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:52,777
Okay.

522
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,891
What is it?

523
00:36:10,992 --> 00:36:11,958
Look through it.

524
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,660
Look at the light.

525
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:17,429
Whoa.

526
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,264
Yeah.

527
00:36:19,365 --> 00:36:20,866
That's the window
I promised you.

528
00:36:20,966 --> 00:36:23,534
Click that button down
on the side.

529
00:36:25,303 --> 00:36:28,438
And those are the natural
wonders of the world,

530
00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:31,640
before they went away.

531
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:32,975
Where did they go?

532
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:35,376
You know.
I told you.

533
00:36:35,477 --> 00:36:38,212
Everything's ruined out there.

534
00:36:38,313 --> 00:36:40,547
Nothing good out there anymore.

535
00:36:40,648 --> 00:36:42,749
You couldn't save it?

536
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,483
Well, you have
to pick your battles.

537
00:36:44,584 --> 00:36:46,719
You can only save so much.

538
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,353
I picked you.

539
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,291
Those trees are so big.

540
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:56,393
They're called redwoods.

541
00:37:00,097 --> 00:37:02,597
An up-and-down river?

542
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:05,167
Oh, that's Niagara Falls.

543
00:37:07,736 --> 00:37:11,805
Inside-out mountains?

544
00:37:11,906 --> 00:37:16,141
That's...
that's the Grand Canyon.

545
00:37:16,242 --> 00:37:18,177
It's so pretty.

546
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:19,178
I love it.

547
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,578
I love my window.

548
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:23,081
Well, we have
a lot to look at.

549
00:37:23,182 --> 00:37:25,015
We have
underwater oceans,

550
00:37:25,116 --> 00:37:29,018
and night sky and space,

551
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,921
the deserts of Africa,

552
00:37:32,022 --> 00:37:33,488
cities of Europe.

553
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:35,323
It's like magic.

554
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:36,791
Can we look at space?

555
00:37:36,892 --> 00:37:38,592
When you look at space,

556
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:41,829
you have to lie on your back
and look up at the stars.

557
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,596
Leia?

558
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:46,199
This is Ursa Major,
the Great Bear...

559
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,935
Leia.

560
00:37:50,036 --> 00:37:52,703
You seem distracted.

561
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:55,005
Sorry.

562
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:58,308
What are you
thinking about?

563
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:02,010
Did you ever see
Niagara Falls?

564
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:05,613
Um, once,
when I was very small.

565
00:38:05,714 --> 00:38:08,516
Was it very far away?

566
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:13,353
It's an eight,
or nine-hour drive.

567
00:38:13,454 --> 00:38:14,487
What about
the Grand Canyon?

568
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:16,689
Was that far?

569
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,358
It's in Arizona.

570
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:22,794
Yes.

571
00:38:22,894 --> 00:38:24,795
It is in Arizona.

572
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:26,396
Yes.

573
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:52,183
This is a very special
birthday for us,

574
00:38:52,284 --> 00:38:53,918
for all of us.

575
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:58,922
And we wanted to give you
something really special.

576
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:01,323
We're very proud of you, Leia.

577
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:05,093
Okay.

578
00:39:05,194 --> 00:39:06,594
Now...

579
00:39:08,663 --> 00:39:10,531
Open your eyes.

580
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:11,532
What...

581
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:12,932
It won't hurt you.

582
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,834
It's okay, it's okay.

583
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,702
No, no, no, no, no,
it's okay.

584
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:18,270
It's okay, it's okay.

585
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:19,738
Feel her,
feel how soft she is.

586
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,539
- I don't want it.
- She's harmless.

587
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,274
Here, touch her, touch her.

588
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:24,608
I don't want it.

589
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:26,409
- Leia.
- I don't want it.

590
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,744
- Marcy.
- Leia.

591
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:28,912
We're sorry.

592
00:39:51,463 --> 00:39:52,897
I'll go bring back the dog.

593
00:39:52,998 --> 00:39:54,865
No, don't do that.

594
00:39:54,966 --> 00:39:57,800
Don't act like you're
righting some wrong of mine.

595
00:39:57,901 --> 00:39:59,402
I will take the
dog back myself.

596
00:39:59,503 --> 00:40:01,103
It was my idea.

597
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:37,632
This doesn't make sense.

598
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:39,399
It makes perfect sense.

599
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,767
People have been
doing trust falls

600
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:42,269
for generations.

601
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,070
But I don't understand
why we're practicing

602
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:46,606
something that isn't
going to happen in real life.

603
00:40:46,707 --> 00:40:51,309
So, this isn't a practice
for a real fall.

604
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,911
This is the actual fall.

605
00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:55,679
It's a metaphor,

606
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,516
for... things that happen
in real life.

607
00:41:00,618 --> 00:41:03,252
Now, turn back around.

608
00:41:03,353 --> 00:41:04,920
Come on, here we go.

609
00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:09,857
Now... fall.

610
00:41:21,267 --> 00:41:25,269
So it's natural
that you hesitate,

611
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:29,205
because you've never
trusted anybody before.

612
00:41:29,306 --> 00:41:31,440
I haven't?

613
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:34,376
No.

614
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:37,144
I'm here.

615
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,380
I'm gonna catch you.

616
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:41,681
Now fall.

617
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:54,158
Okay, um...

618
00:41:54,259 --> 00:41:57,327
Maybe... would it help
if I went first?

619
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:58,995
If I let myself fall backwards

620
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:00,796
and you caught me?

621
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:03,999
Let's try that.

622
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:05,366
Okay.

623
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,903
I'm gonna fall backwards,

624
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:11,905
and you're gonna catch me.

625
00:42:12,006 --> 00:42:17,143
One, two, three.

626
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:26,716
How is she?

627
00:42:26,817 --> 00:42:28,217
She's fine.

628
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,953
I drew her a bath.

629
00:42:30,054 --> 00:42:32,020
It'll get better.

630
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:34,957
It is getting better.

631
00:42:35,058 --> 00:42:37,558
You're always looking
ahead of everything.

632
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:39,327
"She'll be fine. "

633
00:42:39,428 --> 00:42:41,061
"We'll get through it. "

634
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:42,228
"Let's wait till morning. "

635
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,496
"Let's see what the police say. "

636
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:45,864
"Let's have another baby. "

637
00:42:45,966 --> 00:42:47,833
What about now?

638
00:42:47,934 --> 00:42:49,701
What about what's happening
right now?

639
00:42:49,802 --> 00:42:51,703
I need you with me in this.

640
00:42:51,804 --> 00:42:52,870
I am.

641
00:42:52,972 --> 00:42:54,404
Well, it doesn't feel like it.

642
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,506
If you can't see
that I'm in this with you,

643
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:57,841
that I...

644
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,911
I want us to move on, yes.

645
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,678
But I've also spent
the last 20 years

646
00:43:03,779 --> 00:43:05,080
holding your hand

647
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:06,982
through the search initiatives

648
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,649
and the anniversary vigils

649
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,084
and you never going
back to work.

650
00:43:10,185 --> 00:43:11,185
That's not fair.

651
00:43:11,286 --> 00:43:12,852
Nothing's fair.

652
00:43:12,953 --> 00:43:14,887
You have to move on,

653
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:17,255
especially now,
now that it's over.

654
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:19,257
- It's not over.
- Because of you.

655
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,925
You stopped.
Everything stopped.

656
00:43:21,026 --> 00:43:22,727
Why is it that
when you talk about it,

657
00:43:22,828 --> 00:43:26,196
it's always like something
that only happened to me,

658
00:43:26,297 --> 00:43:30,432
like you're some noble outsider,
some... some saint,

659
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:32,501
who sacrificed his life for me.

660
00:43:32,602 --> 00:43:34,069
I have sacrificed my life.

661
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,337
No.
It was taken.

662
00:43:36,438 --> 00:43:37,872
Our life was taken,

663
00:43:37,973 --> 00:43:40,407
and you are not giving
me anything, or her.

664
00:43:40,508 --> 00:43:44,176
Why won't you read
one of these books?

665
00:43:44,277 --> 00:43:46,045
Why won't you show
an even minor interest

666
00:43:46,146 --> 00:43:47,380
in how hard this is?

667
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:48,947
It doesn't have to be
that hard.

668
00:43:49,048 --> 00:43:51,416
How would you even begin
to know how hard it is

669
00:43:51,517 --> 00:43:53,717
if you won't let yourself
be a part of it?

670
00:43:53,818 --> 00:43:57,553
In case you haven't noticed,
we need your help,

671
00:43:57,654 --> 00:43:59,689
whether you think we do
or not.

672
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:12,465
I didn't know
anyone was in here.

673
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:16,201
No one said
if I could get out.

674
00:44:16,302 --> 00:44:18,170
Let me get you a towel.

675
00:44:37,153 --> 00:44:39,953
We want to talk to you
about your future.

676
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:41,522
My future?

677
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:43,456
We know that you're smart

678
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:45,391
and that you know things.

679
00:44:45,492 --> 00:44:47,692
And we think that
maybe the best way

680
00:44:47,794 --> 00:44:49,661
to assess what you already know

681
00:44:49,762 --> 00:44:52,663
and structure
your future learning

682
00:44:52,764 --> 00:44:54,498
might be a tutor.

683
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,199
What's a tutor?

684
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,235
A teacher.

685
00:44:59,336 --> 00:45:02,171
A teacher who comes
to the house

686
00:45:02,272 --> 00:45:03,705
and works with you

687
00:45:03,807 --> 00:45:06,074
to make sure you have
everything you need.

688
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:09,010
Leia.

689
00:45:09,111 --> 00:45:11,011
- Leia.
- Go away.

690
00:45:11,112 --> 00:45:12,012
Leia.

691
00:45:12,113 --> 00:45:13,313
- Go away!
- Hey.

692
00:45:13,414 --> 00:45:14,814
Hey, that's not fair.

693
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:15,815
Where have you been?

694
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:16,849
I'm sorry.

695
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,217
That's what's not fair.

696
00:45:18,317 --> 00:45:19,517
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry!

697
00:45:19,618 --> 00:45:20,852
Three days!

698
00:45:20,953 --> 00:45:22,053
You left me for three days!

699
00:45:22,154 --> 00:45:23,420
Two and a half days.

700
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:24,555
Why would you do that?

701
00:45:24,656 --> 00:45:25,556
Why?

702
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:26,890
I'm sorry.

703
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:28,191
- I called your name.
- I know.

704
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,559
You get everything!

705
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,726
- All right, all right.
- I hate you!

706
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,761
Get it all out.

707
00:45:32,862 --> 00:45:34,096
All right, all right,
hey, hey, hey.

708
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:35,397
Care!

709
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:36,664
Why don't you care
that I hate you?

710
00:45:36,765 --> 00:45:37,932
Because you don't hate me.

711
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:39,233
Yes, I do!

712
00:45:39,334 --> 00:45:40,834
You want me to die
like an animal!

713
00:45:40,935 --> 00:45:42,202
Aah!

714
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:43,203
Stop it!

715
00:45:43,304 --> 00:45:45,704
Stop it now!

716
00:45:45,805 --> 00:45:47,940
Now, look at me!
Look!

717
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,441
Leia.

718
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:53,344
Now we are even, yes?

719
00:45:53,445 --> 00:45:54,778
But I didn't mean
to hurt you.

720
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:56,880
I didn't mean
to stay away so long.

721
00:45:56,981 --> 00:45:59,582
You did mean to hit me.

722
00:45:59,683 --> 00:46:00,749
You aimed.

723
00:46:00,851 --> 00:46:04,119
You got me, on purpose.

724
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,553
Okay.

725
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,789
Okay?

726
00:46:14,795 --> 00:46:16,129
And I didn't mean
to hurt you.

727
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,696
I don't believe you.

728
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:23,934
If you don't believe me,

729
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:25,736
then... then what?

730
00:46:25,837 --> 00:46:27,804
Then what have you got?

731
00:46:29,974 --> 00:46:32,341
Nothing.

732
00:46:32,442 --> 00:46:33,575
That's the point.

733
00:46:33,676 --> 00:46:34,843
I don't have anything.

734
00:46:34,944 --> 00:46:37,178
Don't... don't say that.

735
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:41,214
Look, everything I do
is for you.

736
00:46:41,315 --> 00:46:42,415
If you don't have anything,

737
00:46:42,517 --> 00:46:44,216
then what am I?

738
00:46:44,317 --> 00:46:47,086
I'm...
I'm a failure?

739
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:55,492
Come on.

740
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:57,394
Shh.

741
00:46:57,495 --> 00:47:00,263
Come on, shh.

742
00:47:06,968 --> 00:47:09,236
What's gonna happen
to me, Ben?

743
00:47:14,608 --> 00:47:17,109
What's gonna happen
to me after this?

744
00:47:20,612 --> 00:47:21,846
There...

745
00:47:21,947 --> 00:47:24,081
There is no "after this. "

746
00:47:27,518 --> 00:47:30,619
Anyway, think about it.

747
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,290
We've got three weeks
till the first session.

748
00:47:35,391 --> 00:47:38,193
Leia?

749
00:47:38,293 --> 00:47:39,693
Okay.

750
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:04,346
Brennan, Pennsylvania.

751
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:11,051
Packerton County Jail.

752
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,259
Leia.

753
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:34,796
You came.

754
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:38,733
I miss you.

755
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:46,339
You look different.

756
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,873
You look good.

757
00:50:48,974 --> 00:50:50,408
I like your hair.

758
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:52,476
Looks nice like that.

759
00:51:18,965 --> 00:51:20,798
Did you know...

760
00:51:26,337 --> 00:51:30,639
Did you know that you were
changing things about me?

761
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:35,744
Like my name...
and birthday?

762
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:38,612
I didn't know those things
about you to begin with,

763
00:51:38,713 --> 00:51:42,148
so I didn't think
I was changing anything.

764
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:45,885
I was giving you things.

765
00:51:45,986 --> 00:51:50,589
You can't change
what you don't know.

766
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,591
I don't know
how to do anything.

767
00:51:53,692 --> 00:51:55,725
You got here, didn't you?

768
00:51:55,826 --> 00:51:57,827
You could follow directions.

769
00:51:57,928 --> 00:51:59,162
You caught the bus.

770
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:01,530
I don't know
how to do anything.

771
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:17,209
You'll be fine.

772
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,680
Do you regret it?

773
00:52:23,782 --> 00:52:25,182
Never regret the things you do.

774
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:28,651
Regret the things you don't.

775
00:52:28,752 --> 00:52:31,521
It takes as much effort

776
00:52:31,622 --> 00:52:35,590
running in place
as running a mile.

777
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:38,092
I'd rather see the mile.

778
00:52:42,296 --> 00:52:46,899
Even if you die in here?

779
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,901
Even if I die in here.

780
00:52:54,072 --> 00:52:55,939
I can't decide
what the worst thing

781
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,341
that's ever happened to me is...

782
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:07,948
Being with you my whole life

783
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:10,651
or being without you
for the rest of it.

784
00:53:24,262 --> 00:53:25,696
Hey.

785
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:32,768
No girls in their 20s at all?

786
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:34,303
What about teenagers?

787
00:53:34,404 --> 00:53:36,604
Any teenagers?

788
00:53:36,705 --> 00:53:38,406
Yes, I will hold.

789
00:53:42,543 --> 00:53:45,177
No, I know.

790
00:53:45,278 --> 00:53:48,180
Yes, you will...
you will call me

791
00:53:48,281 --> 00:53:50,281
if you hear anything.

792
00:54:17,937 --> 00:54:19,137
Okay.

793
00:56:58,895 --> 00:56:59,862
Oh, my God, where were you?

794
00:56:59,963 --> 00:57:00,863
Are you okay?

795
00:57:00,964 --> 00:57:02,598
Where were you?

796
00:57:02,698 --> 00:57:04,699
Leia, where were you?

797
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,102
I went for a walk.

798
00:57:07,202 --> 00:57:09,436
A walk?

799
00:57:09,537 --> 00:57:10,471
For seven hours?

800
00:57:10,572 --> 00:57:11,705
Yes.

801
00:57:11,805 --> 00:57:13,606
Where did you walk?

802
00:57:13,707 --> 00:57:15,341
I don't know, a park.

803
00:57:15,442 --> 00:57:17,242
What park?

804
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:21,312
Grayson Park?

805
00:57:21,413 --> 00:57:22,780
Yes.

806
00:57:22,881 --> 00:57:23,981
With the fountain?

807
00:57:24,082 --> 00:57:25,315
Yes.

808
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:26,816
There is no fountain
in Grayson Park.

809
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:28,451
Then the park
with the fountain.

810
00:57:28,552 --> 00:57:31,487
There is no park
with a fountain.

811
00:57:31,588 --> 00:57:33,389
You can trust me.

812
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,456
And you can tell me
where you were.

813
00:57:35,557 --> 00:57:37,892
I did.

814
00:57:37,993 --> 00:57:40,360
I don't think you did.

815
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:46,432
What is this?

816
00:57:51,771 --> 00:57:54,171
Stop it!

817
00:57:54,272 --> 00:57:56,206
Hey, Leia.

818
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:57,340
We were worried
about you.

819
00:57:57,441 --> 00:57:58,341
Are you okay?

820
00:57:58,442 --> 00:57:59,575
Nothing is okay.

821
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:00,977
Look at this.

822
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:02,544
- They're pictures of him.
- No.

823
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,146
These are pictures
of him, Glen.

824
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,681
Stop, they're mine.

825
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:08,182
I found them under her bed.

826
00:58:08,283 --> 00:58:11,151
"Today is my fake
real birthday.

827
00:58:11,252 --> 00:58:13,086
I wanted to tell you
I'm sorry... "

828
00:58:13,187 --> 00:58:15,721
- Come on.
- "For blowing out the candles.

829
00:58:15,822 --> 00:58:17,690
"Even though
without me telling you,

830
00:58:17,791 --> 00:58:19,425
"you wouldn't even know,

831
00:58:19,525 --> 00:58:22,026
"but I feel so bad about it,
I have to tell you,

832
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:23,428
"so I can apologize.

833
00:58:23,529 --> 00:58:24,761
"I'm sorry,

834
00:58:24,862 --> 00:58:26,430
and I'm sorry
for telling you. "

835
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:28,432
What kind of a hold does
this man have over you?

836
00:58:28,532 --> 00:58:30,666
Okay, okay, Marcy.
That's enough.

837
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:31,934
You've had enough, Glen?

838
00:58:32,035 --> 00:58:33,668
Can we talk about this?

839
00:58:33,769 --> 00:58:35,036
We will sit down...

840
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,905
I don't think we
can talk about this.

841
00:58:37,006 --> 00:58:38,105
I... I don't think so.

842
00:58:38,206 --> 00:58:39,206
Put the phone down.

843
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,574
Hello, this is Marcy Dargon.

844
00:58:40,675 --> 00:58:42,009
I'm calling for Detective Timms.

845
00:58:42,109 --> 00:58:43,009
- It's an emergency.
- Marcy, wait.

846
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:44,010
What are you doing?

847
00:58:44,111 --> 00:58:45,611
Wait.

848
00:58:45,713 --> 00:58:46,878
Well, please tell him this is Marcy...

849
00:58:46,979 --> 00:58:48,180
- Stop!
- It's an emergency.

850
00:58:48,281 --> 00:58:49,281
It's an emergency!

851
00:58:49,382 --> 00:58:51,382
Stop getting him
into trouble!

852
00:58:51,483 --> 00:58:52,750
- Give me those!
- These are not yours.

853
00:58:52,851 --> 00:58:53,918
- They're mine!
- These are not yours!

854
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:55,219
- Give them back!
- No!

855
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,286
He is hurting you!

856
00:58:56,387 --> 00:58:57,620
He is still hurting you!

857
00:58:57,722 --> 00:58:58,755
- No!
- He's hurting you right...

858
00:58:58,856 --> 00:58:59,956
You are hurting me!

859
00:59:00,057 --> 00:59:02,491
You!
You did this to me!

860
00:59:05,561 --> 00:59:08,096
Go upstairs.

861
00:59:08,197 --> 00:59:09,496
Go!

862
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,903
Thank you for all your help.

863
00:59:19,004 --> 00:59:20,705
What's wrong with you?

864
00:59:20,806 --> 00:59:21,973
I am done.

865
00:59:22,074 --> 00:59:23,073
You can't just
give up on her.

866
00:59:23,174 --> 00:59:24,108
With you.

867
00:59:24,209 --> 00:59:25,309
I am done with you.

868
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:26,744
Oh, you're done with me?

869
00:59:26,845 --> 00:59:28,411
I am so sick of dragging
you around on my...

870
00:59:28,512 --> 00:59:29,545
Is that what you think?

871
00:59:29,646 --> 00:59:31,380
Yes.

872
00:59:31,482 --> 00:59:33,415
Do you have any idea what this
has been like for me, huh?

873
00:59:33,516 --> 00:59:34,883
What you have
been like for me?

874
00:59:34,984 --> 00:59:36,817
What you have been
all these years?

875
00:59:36,918 --> 00:59:38,452
Where you have been?

876
00:59:38,553 --> 00:59:40,254
Where have you been
all these years and years?

877
00:59:40,355 --> 00:59:42,489
Here.

878
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,758
In our actual life,

879
00:59:44,859 --> 00:59:47,559
in what actually
happened to us,

880
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:52,163
in what actually
is still happening to us.

881
00:59:52,264 --> 00:59:55,565
And it is not my fault
that you cannot do that,

882
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:57,601
and it is not my responsibility
to make you.

883
00:59:57,702 --> 00:59:59,502
I want to move on,
for Christ's sake.

884
00:59:59,603 --> 01:00:01,137
I want us all to move on.

885
01:00:01,238 --> 01:00:02,638
No.

886
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:04,906
You want us to be different.

887
01:00:05,007 --> 01:00:07,305
You want to fast-forward
to the easy part.

888
01:00:07,618 --> 01:00:10,110
Well, there isn't one,
not like this.

889
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:14,147
And I cannot drag Leanne
back into reality

890
01:00:14,248 --> 01:00:16,349
if I have to do
the same for you.

891
01:00:19,385 --> 01:00:21,519
And I choose her.

892
01:01:02,952 --> 01:01:05,287
The only loophole
in our system is free will,

893
01:01:05,388 --> 01:01:07,321
and we can't account for that.

894
01:01:07,422 --> 01:01:09,456
A restraining order
has since been put in place

895
01:01:09,558 --> 01:01:10,825
forbidding Mr. McKay

896
01:01:10,926 --> 01:01:12,826
to make further contact
with the girl.

897
01:01:12,927 --> 01:01:15,528
His lawyer released
this statement.

898
01:01:15,628 --> 01:01:18,997
"I deeply regret any conflict
I may have caused.

899
01:01:19,098 --> 01:01:21,399
"I only want what
is best for Leanne

900
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,134
"and apologize for any actions

901
01:01:23,235 --> 01:01:25,869
"that could have been
interpreted to the contrary.

902
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:28,738
I wish her only good things
at this difficult time. "

903
01:01:37,813 --> 01:01:39,413
Hello?

904
01:01:50,022 --> 01:01:51,590
Hello?

905
01:01:57,261 --> 01:01:58,661
Who is it?

906
01:01:58,762 --> 01:02:01,330
It's Mr. Henry.

907
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:04,066
Mr. Henry?

908
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:06,200
The tutor,
for your daughter.

909
01:02:06,301 --> 01:02:08,002
I left you a message
last week.

910
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:12,505
I confirmed with
your husband yesterday.

911
01:02:12,607 --> 01:02:14,573
Can I see some ID?

912
01:02:14,674 --> 01:02:17,176
- ID?
- Yeah.

913
01:02:17,277 --> 01:02:18,744
Sure.

914
01:02:28,018 --> 01:02:30,386
Illinois?

915
01:02:30,487 --> 01:02:32,454
Yeah, that's where I'm from.

916
01:02:39,995 --> 01:02:43,630
No, thank you.

917
01:02:43,731 --> 01:02:46,899
Excuse me?

918
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,034
Excuse me?

919
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:54,138
Years ago when
she became separated

920
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:56,039
from a group
of neighborhood kids

921
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,875
while playing in an
inflatable castle.

922
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:00,643
911, what is your emergency?

923
01:03:00,744 --> 01:03:02,211
Yes, my daughter is gone.

924
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:03,812
She's missing, she's 41/2.

925
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:06,080
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

926
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:08,149
She was... she was
in the bouncy castle

927
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,317
with the other kids.

928
01:03:10,418 --> 01:03:11,952
Ma'am, ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to calm down.

929
01:03:12,053 --> 01:03:13,219
What is your location?

930
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,287
We're at Welling Park.

931
01:03:14,388 --> 01:03:15,288
There's a barbecue.

932
01:03:15,389 --> 01:03:16,822
I took off her shoes

933
01:03:16,924 --> 01:03:18,256
and I put her in the castle
for a minute.

934
01:03:18,357 --> 01:03:19,257
I was here the whole time.

935
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:20,759
I've been here.

936
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,293
She can't go anywhere
without her shoes.

937
01:03:22,394 --> 01:03:24,094
She doesn't know how
to run without shoes.

938
01:03:24,195 --> 01:03:25,996
And how long
has she been missing?

939
01:03:26,097 --> 01:03:28,131
Oh, my God, I don't know!
How could I not know?

940
01:03:28,232 --> 01:03:30,099
Ma'am, how long ago did
you discover she was gone?

941
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,833
15 minutes, we've been looking
for her for 15 minutes.

942
01:03:31,935 --> 01:03:33,235
Can you tell me
what she's wearing?

943
01:03:33,336 --> 01:03:35,569
She's wearing a yellow t-shirt

944
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:37,838
and a denim jumper,
yellow socks.

945
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,340
She's not wearing any shoes.

946
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,341
I'm holding her shoes.

947
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,410
Benjamin McKay was a product
of the foster care system...

948
01:03:45,512 --> 01:03:47,813
Bouncing between over 30
residences and group homes

949
01:03:47,914 --> 01:03:49,147
before the age of...

950
01:03:52,685 --> 01:03:55,352
Hello?

951
01:03:55,453 --> 01:03:58,587
Oh, hi, Dr. Andrews.

952
01:03:58,689 --> 01:04:00,656
How are you?

953
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:03,425
I was gonna call you,
and you beat me to it.

954
01:04:07,896 --> 01:04:10,631
Yeah, so... one of the things

955
01:04:10,732 --> 01:04:12,365
that I was gonna call you about

956
01:04:12,466 --> 01:04:15,134
is that Leanne has come down

957
01:04:15,235 --> 01:04:19,304
with a little touch of the flu,
we think.

958
01:04:19,405 --> 01:04:25,042
So can I call you when
she's feeling a little better?

959
01:04:25,143 --> 01:04:28,211
Thank you.

960
01:04:28,312 --> 01:04:31,280
Okay.

961
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:32,982
Bye.

962
01:04:36,652 --> 01:04:37,919
Leanne?

963
01:04:40,822 --> 01:04:43,389
Leanne, it's time for lunch.

964
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:45,124
I made you a sandwich,

965
01:04:45,225 --> 01:04:50,061
toasted like you like it.

966
01:04:50,162 --> 01:04:52,263
I'm gonna slide it
under the door now.

967
01:05:03,172 --> 01:05:05,640
Am I still in trouble?

968
01:05:10,078 --> 01:05:11,878
You're not in trouble.

969
01:05:13,314 --> 01:05:15,647
Then can I come downstairs?

970
01:05:20,919 --> 01:05:22,620
Do you miss me?

971
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:27,057
I'm thirsty.

972
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:32,928
Water's in a half an hour.

973
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,130
Check the schedule.

974
01:06:26,204 --> 01:06:29,439
What do I have to do?

975
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:32,574
Just look at me.

976
01:06:32,675 --> 01:06:36,144
I don't get it.

977
01:06:36,244 --> 01:06:39,280
The bond that we created

978
01:06:39,381 --> 01:06:42,782
when you were an infant
has been erased.

979
01:06:42,883 --> 01:06:45,684
Children bond to their mothers

980
01:06:45,785 --> 01:06:47,486
in the earliest months of life,

981
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,088
when they can't speak,

982
01:06:49,189 --> 01:06:51,355
when they can only look
in each other's eyes

983
01:06:51,457 --> 01:06:54,324
and trust that the mother
will care for them

984
01:06:54,425 --> 01:06:58,128
and provide the things
that they want or need,

985
01:06:58,229 --> 01:07:00,663
without their even asking.

986
01:07:02,632 --> 01:07:05,600
I'm 22.

987
01:07:05,701 --> 01:07:07,868
23.

988
01:07:07,969 --> 01:07:10,137
I'm not an infant.

989
01:07:10,238 --> 01:07:13,506
And that's why it's called
"attachment therapy"

990
01:07:13,607 --> 01:07:15,141
instead of just "attachment. "

991
01:07:15,242 --> 01:07:17,776
Just attachment happens
when you're a baby,

992
01:07:17,877 --> 01:07:21,378
but attachment therapy
happens when you're older

993
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,382
but you're incapable
of attaching to someone.

994
01:07:26,484 --> 01:07:29,919
I was attached to someone.

995
01:07:35,424 --> 01:07:38,392
This isn't something
I'm asking you to do.

996
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:46,198
So...

997
01:07:46,299 --> 01:07:52,070
you should lie down here
with your head in my lap.

998
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:00,209
Okay.

999
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:08,082
Now you look at me.

1000
01:08:08,183 --> 01:08:11,651
For how long?

1001
01:08:11,752 --> 01:08:13,553
We'll see.

1002
01:08:25,029 --> 01:08:26,730
What color are my eyes?

1003
01:08:26,831 --> 01:08:28,732
Blue.

1004
01:08:28,833 --> 01:08:31,433
- Yours too.
- Mm-hmm.

1005
01:08:31,535 --> 01:08:33,601
They were green
when I was born.

1006
01:08:33,702 --> 01:08:35,103
They changed.

1007
01:08:35,204 --> 01:08:38,605
When I was born,
did my eyes change?

1008
01:08:38,706 --> 01:08:40,507
I don't know.

1009
01:08:40,608 --> 01:08:43,843
Well, are there pictures?

1010
01:08:43,944 --> 01:08:46,112
Now, you know there aren't.

1011
01:08:56,554 --> 01:08:57,754
I want you to tell me
the story

1012
01:08:57,855 --> 01:09:00,390
about when you found me.

1013
01:09:00,491 --> 01:09:02,758
You mean
when you found me?

1014
01:09:02,859 --> 01:09:05,293
Please.

1015
01:09:05,394 --> 01:09:08,362
Well, it was spring.

1016
01:09:08,463 --> 01:09:12,365
And it was the middle
of the beginning of the end.

1017
01:09:12,466 --> 01:09:13,633
Of the world.

1018
01:09:13,734 --> 01:09:16,202
Of the world.

1019
01:09:16,303 --> 01:09:18,736
And... I was driving,

1020
01:09:18,837 --> 01:09:21,539
and something told me to stop,

1021
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,540
something in here.

1022
01:09:23,641 --> 01:09:25,475
So I did.

1023
01:09:25,577 --> 01:09:28,277
And there you were.

1024
01:09:28,378 --> 01:09:29,745
What did I look like?

1025
01:09:29,846 --> 01:09:32,148
Whew, all lit up,

1026
01:09:32,249 --> 01:09:33,748
the brightest...

1027
01:09:33,849 --> 01:09:37,585
You were the brightest thing
I ever saw.

1028
01:09:37,686 --> 01:09:40,254
But you were stranded,

1029
01:09:40,355 --> 01:09:41,821
and strangers.

1030
01:09:41,922 --> 01:09:45,725
Am I still the brightest
thing you ever saw?

1031
01:09:45,825 --> 01:09:50,394
You're brighter than the sun
at the center of the earth.

1032
01:09:50,495 --> 01:09:52,296
Is there really a sun
at the center of the earth?

1033
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:55,165
Well, there's a you,
isn't there?

1034
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,668
Okay, keep going.

1035
01:09:58,769 --> 01:10:01,971
Well, you could feel
I was looking at you.

1036
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:04,505
- In here?
- Mm-hmm.

1037
01:10:04,607 --> 01:10:07,609
So I picked you up,

1038
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:10,310
and you said...

1039
01:10:10,411 --> 01:10:11,511
"Save me. "

1040
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:13,179
So I did.

1041
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,250
I saved you from everybody
you left behind,

1042
01:10:18,351 --> 01:10:23,320
from ever being anything
but mine.

1043
01:10:23,421 --> 01:10:25,489
I wish I could
remember things.

1044
01:10:37,065 --> 01:10:39,267
What color were my eyes
when I was born?

1045
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,601
Shh.

1046
01:10:41,702 --> 01:10:44,337
You're not supposed to talk.

1047
01:10:52,444 --> 01:10:54,111
They were gray.

1048
01:11:07,056 --> 01:11:10,124
When am I allowed
to be alone again?

1049
01:11:10,225 --> 01:11:12,959
It's on the schedule.

1050
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,128
Now fall.

1051
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,995
Where's Glen?

1052
01:11:17,096 --> 01:11:19,698
Did you make a schedule
for him too?

1053
01:11:19,799 --> 01:11:24,168
No, we made a choice.

1054
01:11:24,269 --> 01:11:27,637
And at some point,
we'll make a decision.

1055
01:11:27,738 --> 01:11:31,707
Why choose to be apart
after so long?

1056
01:11:31,808 --> 01:11:34,542
It's important to make choices,

1057
01:11:34,643 --> 01:11:36,411
even hard ones.

1058
01:11:39,681 --> 01:11:43,716
Now fall.

1059
01:11:43,817 --> 01:11:44,717
I don't want to.

1060
01:11:44,818 --> 01:11:48,353
Leanne, fall.

1061
01:11:48,454 --> 01:11:49,721
I choose not to.

1062
01:11:49,822 --> 01:11:51,723
You have to.

1063
01:11:51,824 --> 01:11:52,823
On the count of three...

1064
01:11:52,924 --> 01:11:54,558
- No.
- One, two...

1065
01:11:54,659 --> 01:11:56,327
Aah!

1066
01:11:59,763 --> 01:12:01,997
Now you don't get cake.

1067
01:12:12,273 --> 01:12:14,441
I know you're scared.

1068
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:16,408
But it doesn't matter.

1069
01:12:16,509 --> 01:12:18,110
I didn't catch you.

1070
01:12:18,211 --> 01:12:20,311
That doesn't matter either.

1071
01:12:24,449 --> 01:12:28,384
If you do this now,

1072
01:12:28,485 --> 01:12:30,319
you can eat alone tonight.

1073
01:12:52,404 --> 01:12:53,571
Glen?

1074
01:12:53,672 --> 01:12:56,740
Marcy, open the door.

1075
01:12:56,841 --> 01:12:58,541
I didn't think you were home.

1076
01:12:58,642 --> 01:12:59,609
It's dark in there.

1077
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:00,809
You should turn a light on.

1078
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:03,078
I thought maybe you were out.

1079
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:06,414
No, here.

1080
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:09,182
I just came by for some things,
some clothes.

1081
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:14,954
Open up the door, Marcy.

1082
01:13:15,055 --> 01:13:17,323
Can I at least see her,
say hi?

1083
01:13:17,424 --> 01:13:21,326
You can't have it both ways.

1084
01:13:21,427 --> 01:13:24,395
She'll call you
when she's ready.

1085
01:13:24,496 --> 01:13:26,463
I'm sorry.

1086
01:13:26,564 --> 01:13:30,566
I'm just... sorry.

1087
01:13:30,667 --> 01:13:32,634
I'll go get your things.

1088
01:13:47,547 --> 01:13:50,581
At some point I'm coming
back in the house.

1089
01:13:50,682 --> 01:13:52,850
That's my life in there too,

1090
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:56,253
my house.

1091
01:13:56,354 --> 01:14:00,089
I'd rather not do this
with a lawyer, Marcy.

1092
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:02,191
And I wish you'd cared
half as much about us

1093
01:14:02,292 --> 01:14:04,325
as you care about
your things, but...

1094
01:14:04,427 --> 01:14:06,194
That's not fair.

1095
01:14:09,431 --> 01:14:10,931
Nothing's fair.

1096
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:24,475
Sooner or later, Marce.

1097
01:14:24,576 --> 01:14:27,177
Fine.
Later.

1098
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:34,049
If you need anything,
I'm not far.

1099
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:36,050
Over on Highland?

1100
01:14:41,989 --> 01:14:44,857
- Yes.
- Hmm.

1101
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,626
Lucky her.

1102
01:14:47,727 --> 01:14:49,794
After all this time.

1103
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:12,645
Thank you.

1104
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:37,765
No, no.

1105
01:15:40,368 --> 01:15:41,768
Good.

1106
01:15:50,343 --> 01:15:52,176
I'm done.

1107
01:15:53,678 --> 01:15:55,079
Mrs. Dargon?

1108
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:57,347
Dr. Andrews.

1109
01:15:57,448 --> 01:15:59,215
I'm...
I'm sorry.

1110
01:15:59,316 --> 01:16:01,183
Oh, not at all.

1111
01:16:01,284 --> 01:16:02,417
Is everything okay?

1112
01:16:02,519 --> 01:16:04,786
Did you need something?

1113
01:16:04,888 --> 01:16:06,554
May I come in?

1114
01:16:06,655 --> 01:16:09,056
Of course, please.

1115
01:16:09,157 --> 01:16:10,891
So how is Leia?

1116
01:16:10,992 --> 01:16:12,959
She's... she's good.

1117
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:14,426
Oh, good.

1118
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:17,129
She hasn't been to my office
in a while now.

1119
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:19,964
Well, she has that cold still.

1120
01:16:20,065 --> 01:16:22,934
It's bronchitis, I guess, now.

1121
01:16:23,035 --> 01:16:23,934
She'll be fine.

1122
01:16:24,035 --> 01:16:25,369
A lot of bed rest.

1123
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:26,570
Her flu?

1124
01:16:26,671 --> 01:16:27,704
What?

1125
01:16:27,804 --> 01:16:29,205
Her flu turned into bronchitis?

1126
01:16:29,306 --> 01:16:30,640
Yes, it did.

1127
01:16:37,178 --> 01:16:38,445
Sorry.

1128
01:16:38,547 --> 01:16:40,114
You okay?

1129
01:16:40,215 --> 01:16:42,015
Yeah, yeah.
I'm good, I'm good.

1130
01:16:55,893 --> 01:16:57,127
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

1131
01:16:57,228 --> 01:16:59,428
What happened to your face?

1132
01:16:59,529 --> 01:17:01,063
I fell.

1133
01:17:01,164 --> 01:17:02,498
It's minor.

1134
01:17:02,599 --> 01:17:07,101
It's not a big deal at all, really.

1135
01:17:07,202 --> 01:17:09,303
Glen called my office.

1136
01:17:09,404 --> 01:17:11,838
He's worried about
you and Leia.

1137
01:17:14,341 --> 01:17:17,143
Could we not call her that?

1138
01:17:17,244 --> 01:17:19,778
I named her Leanne.

1139
01:17:19,879 --> 01:17:23,314
That is her name.

1140
01:17:23,415 --> 01:17:24,715
Sure.

1141
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:33,095
Glen expressed concern
for both you and Leanne.

1142
01:17:33,756 --> 01:17:37,158
He and I are taking
some time apart,

1143
01:17:37,259 --> 01:17:41,027
as I'm sure he told you.

1144
01:17:41,128 --> 01:17:45,097
That must be very difficult
at a time like this.

1145
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:47,433
Is this your first separation?

1146
01:17:47,534 --> 01:17:51,035
I went to my sister's once,
years ago.

1147
01:17:51,136 --> 01:17:55,505
12, 14 years ago.

1148
01:17:55,607 --> 01:18:00,676
It was after they found
that body in Maryland.

1149
01:18:00,777 --> 01:18:04,713
How is Leanne finding
the separation?

1150
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:07,948
Fine.

1151
01:18:08,049 --> 01:18:10,618
Are they seeing much
of each other?

1152
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,518
Not at the moment.

1153
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:14,654
He's...

1154
01:18:14,755 --> 01:18:17,823
He's not...

1155
01:18:17,924 --> 01:18:21,459
I don't really want
to talk about Glen.

1156
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,228
Okay.

1157
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:26,997
What about other family?

1158
01:18:27,098 --> 01:18:29,632
Your sister,
are you still close?

1159
01:18:29,733 --> 01:18:30,699
She got married.

1160
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,167
She had two kids,

1161
01:18:32,268 --> 01:18:37,839
11 and... 8,

1162
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:42,209
which made it hard to... travel.

1163
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:45,878
I imagine that's not easy,

1164
01:18:45,979 --> 01:18:49,748
other people's children.

1165
01:18:49,849 --> 01:18:52,183
You have kids, Dr. Andrews?

1166
01:18:52,283 --> 01:18:55,919
No.

1167
01:18:56,021 --> 01:19:00,356
I never know
how to answer that.

1168
01:19:00,457 --> 01:19:02,891
I'm sure you're doing
just fine.

1169
01:19:06,294 --> 01:19:08,329
You do this a lot,

1170
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:12,232
counsel victims of kidnapping?

1171
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:15,701
Not specifically.

1172
01:19:15,802 --> 01:19:17,903
Me neither.

1173
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:21,105
But I'm sure
you're doing just fine.

1174
01:19:25,176 --> 01:19:28,344
Well, I don't want to take up
any more of your time.

1175
01:19:31,314 --> 01:19:32,748
If I could just
see Leanne now,

1176
01:19:32,849 --> 01:19:34,182
I'll be on my way.

1177
01:19:34,283 --> 01:19:38,185
Oh, yes, right.

1178
01:19:38,286 --> 01:19:40,888
Not for long,
just to touch base.

1179
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:43,723
I'd love to hear
about your vacation.

1180
01:19:43,824 --> 01:19:45,992
I'm sure it was
great for her.

1181
01:20:13,747 --> 01:20:15,748
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi,

1182
01:20:15,849 --> 01:20:17,650
three Mississippi,
four Mississippi,

1183
01:20:17,751 --> 01:20:19,617
five Mississippi,
six Mississippi...

1184
01:20:28,392 --> 01:20:32,394
58 Mississippi,
59 Mississippi...

1185
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:34,229
60.

1186
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:44,771
So she's... she's sleeping.

1187
01:20:44,872 --> 01:20:46,939
I... I... I tried to wake her,

1188
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,774
but she's just too feverish
to come down.

1189
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:51,676
Of course, her bronchitis.

1190
01:20:51,777 --> 01:20:55,312
Yes, it'll have to be
another time.

1191
01:20:55,413 --> 01:20:58,681
Thursday, her regular time.

1192
01:20:58,782 --> 01:21:02,451
Yes, right, Thursday.

1193
01:21:02,552 --> 01:21:03,952
Great.

1194
01:21:06,422 --> 01:21:07,489
Bermuda.

1195
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:09,656
Bermuda.

1196
01:21:09,758 --> 01:21:10,991
Barracuda's a fish.

1197
01:21:11,092 --> 01:21:12,692
Okay.

1198
01:21:16,729 --> 01:21:19,965
What was your favorite part?

1199
01:21:20,066 --> 01:21:21,133
We went on a boat.

1200
01:21:21,233 --> 01:21:22,767
Good.

1201
01:21:22,868 --> 01:21:24,268
I've never been on a boat.

1202
01:21:24,369 --> 01:21:25,469
I know.

1203
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:28,805
What if she asks
why I like it?

1204
01:21:28,906 --> 01:21:30,272
You just tell her
you like the water.

1205
01:21:30,373 --> 01:21:33,275
But what if I don't
like the water?

1206
01:21:33,376 --> 01:21:34,276
Do you?

1207
01:21:34,377 --> 01:21:36,778
I don't know.

1208
01:21:36,879 --> 01:21:40,547
I don't want to
answer these questions.

1209
01:21:40,648 --> 01:21:44,049
I don't want you to
answer them either.

1210
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:50,288
How was the plane ride?

1211
01:21:50,389 --> 01:21:51,389
It was scary.

1212
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,157
Good.

1213
01:21:53,258 --> 01:21:54,825
I don't get it.

1214
01:21:54,926 --> 01:21:57,360
Why would people do
something scary on purpose?

1215
01:21:57,461 --> 01:21:59,061
It's not actually scary.

1216
01:21:59,163 --> 01:22:00,630
It's just, some people
think that it's scary.

1217
01:22:00,731 --> 01:22:02,798
Do you?

1218
01:22:02,899 --> 01:22:03,799
Not really.

1219
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,634
Then why do I?

1220
01:22:06,735 --> 01:22:09,403
Because you've never
been on a plane before.

1221
01:22:09,504 --> 01:22:11,171
But the boat wasn't scary.

1222
01:22:11,272 --> 01:22:12,338
No.

1223
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:14,541
- Why not?
- I don't know.

1224
01:22:18,244 --> 01:22:21,145
I'm sorry.

1225
01:22:21,246 --> 01:22:25,582
Why don't you have a tan?

1226
01:22:25,683 --> 01:22:27,751
I wore a sun screen.

1227
01:22:27,852 --> 01:22:31,086
One word, "sunscreen. "

1228
01:22:31,188 --> 01:22:32,354
I wore a sunscreen.

1229
01:22:32,455 --> 01:22:35,056
Not "a," just "sunscreen. "

1230
01:22:35,157 --> 01:22:36,758
"I wore sunscreen. "

1231
01:22:36,859 --> 01:22:39,059
It's... it's a lotion.

1232
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:42,895
I wore sunscreen.

1233
01:22:42,996 --> 01:22:43,896
That's good.

1234
01:22:43,997 --> 01:22:45,364
I... I...

1235
01:22:45,465 --> 01:22:46,599
I think that's good for today.

1236
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:47,866
I think we should...

1237
01:22:47,967 --> 01:22:49,334
we'll practice more
tomorrow, yeah?

1238
01:22:49,435 --> 01:22:50,902
Okay.

1239
01:22:54,206 --> 01:22:58,575
What happens
if I get them wrong?

1240
01:22:58,676 --> 01:23:00,742
I'm just trying to do my best

1241
01:23:00,844 --> 01:23:03,078
to protect you.

1242
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:07,381
From what?

1243
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:09,883
Why do you ask
so many questions

1244
01:23:09,984 --> 01:23:14,420
and you still don't know
what a barracuda is?

1245
01:23:14,521 --> 01:23:16,088
I know what it is now.

1246
01:23:16,189 --> 01:23:17,456
It's a fish.

1247
01:23:20,893 --> 01:23:22,460
Let's move on.

1248
01:23:26,664 --> 01:23:28,164
What's next?

1249
01:23:33,369 --> 01:23:35,070
Beads.

1250
01:23:35,171 --> 01:23:37,872
I think that we're gonna
try something new.

1251
01:23:51,383 --> 01:23:54,818
Applied accountability.

1252
01:23:54,919 --> 01:23:57,587
What's applied accountability?

1253
01:23:57,688 --> 01:24:00,489
I fall, you fall.

1254
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:04,058
I succeed, you succeed.

1255
01:24:06,829 --> 01:24:11,431
So, how are you feeling about
the changes in the house?

1256
01:24:11,532 --> 01:24:13,966
Which changes?

1257
01:24:14,067 --> 01:24:17,103
Glen being gone.

1258
01:24:17,204 --> 01:24:18,670
Okay, I guess.

1259
01:24:18,771 --> 01:24:21,306
Are there other changes?

1260
01:24:21,407 --> 01:24:23,841
Has your relationship
with Marcy changed at all

1261
01:24:23,942 --> 01:24:25,476
since he's been gone?

1262
01:24:29,113 --> 01:24:31,914
Can we talk about
something else?

1263
01:24:33,883 --> 01:24:36,651
What about your vacation?

1264
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:40,487
Good.

1265
01:24:40,588 --> 01:24:42,589
It was good.

1266
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:43,890
Good.

1267
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,127
I used a sunscreen.

1268
01:24:49,228 --> 01:24:51,229
It's a lotion.

1269
01:24:59,269 --> 01:25:03,939
What about your relationship
with Mr. McKay?

1270
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,675
We're not allowed
to have a relationship.

1271
01:25:06,776 --> 01:25:08,876
And do you still want one?

1272
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:15,281
That doesn't have to be
a yes-or-no question.

1273
01:25:15,382 --> 01:25:20,618
It's natural to feel conflicted
about Mr. McKay.

1274
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:23,521
Ben.

1275
01:25:23,622 --> 01:25:27,157
Ben.

1276
01:25:27,258 --> 01:25:29,892
You always say that.

1277
01:25:29,993 --> 01:25:32,061
What?

1278
01:25:32,162 --> 01:25:35,029
That it's natural

1279
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,999
to feel conflicted
about my feelings.

1280
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,701
And it is.

1281
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:42,669
But how can you have feelings
about something

1282
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:45,404
when you don't know
anything about it?

1283
01:25:45,505 --> 01:25:49,374
Is that how you feel about him?

1284
01:25:49,475 --> 01:25:51,643
That's how I feel
about everything.

1285
01:25:55,747 --> 01:25:58,848
Okay, all right.

1286
01:25:58,949 --> 01:26:01,917
I'll let you get settled in.

1287
01:26:02,018 --> 01:26:05,520
Water's in a half an hour.

1288
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:17,830
Is this how people love?

1289
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:19,497
They become a room
for you to live in,

1290
01:26:19,598 --> 01:26:21,766
and then they lock?

1291
01:26:24,302 --> 01:26:27,471
How many rooms do you get
in your life?

1292
01:26:30,374 --> 01:26:32,575
Am I lucky or unlucky?

1293
01:26:36,145 --> 01:26:38,512
I'm really asking.

1294
01:26:42,216 --> 01:26:43,950
We're both lucky.

1295
01:27:52,004 --> 01:27:55,038
I... I have something for you.

1296
01:27:58,176 --> 01:28:00,976
I have to go and get it.

1297
01:28:01,078 --> 01:28:02,445
Where is it?

1298
01:28:02,546 --> 01:28:03,945
It's downstairs.

1299
01:28:04,046 --> 01:28:05,814
We are downstairs.

1300
01:28:05,915 --> 01:28:07,648
It's in the basement.

1301
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:10,751
Is it alive?

1302
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:12,452
No.

1303
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:14,087
Okay.

1304
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:33,869
I'm gonna trust you.

1305
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:35,536
Okay, good.

1306
01:29:22,241 --> 01:29:24,875
17 years, the singular window
in the basement

1307
01:29:24,976 --> 01:29:26,409
was sealed and covered,

1308
01:29:26,511 --> 01:29:29,645
making it impossible
to see in or out.

1309
01:29:29,746 --> 01:29:32,047
Neighbors said they never
noticed anything unusual

1310
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:34,983
about Benjamin McKay
or his basement.

1311
01:29:35,084 --> 01:29:40,554
He kept to himself mostly.

1312
01:29:40,655 --> 01:29:43,322
We'd always say hello
if we happened into each other,

1313
01:29:43,423 --> 01:29:45,925
but, you know, I mean,

1314
01:29:46,026 --> 01:29:48,927
never mentioned family,
never had anyone over.

1315
01:29:49,028 --> 01:29:51,329
I mean, he was always alone.

1316
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:53,697
At least we thought
he was alone.

1317
01:29:53,798 --> 01:29:57,534
No one knows how much time McKay
himself spent in the basement,

1318
01:29:57,635 --> 01:29:59,235
though there was just one bed

1319
01:29:59,336 --> 01:30:02,070
fashioned out of a camping cot
wrapped in blankets.

1320
01:30:02,172 --> 01:30:04,239
The bedding is being tested
for DNA,

1321
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:06,240
and thus far the results
of those tests

1322
01:30:06,341 --> 01:30:08,176
have not been released.

1323
01:30:08,277 --> 01:30:10,277
What will happen
at this museum of captivity

1324
01:30:10,378 --> 01:30:13,346
at 111 Langston Road
is yet to be determined,

1325
01:30:13,447 --> 01:30:15,381
as the relics of a life underground

1326
01:30:15,482 --> 01:30:17,383
wait to be claimed.

1327
01:30:17,484 --> 01:30:18,583
Truly horrifying.

1328
01:30:18,684 --> 01:30:21,419
For 21 News, I'm Juan Fernandez.

1329
01:30:50,842 --> 01:30:53,344
This is a stationary bicycle.

1330
01:30:53,445 --> 01:30:56,346
You ride it in place,

1331
01:30:56,447 --> 01:30:59,381
like... like this.

1332
01:31:01,418 --> 01:31:02,985
See?

1333
01:31:03,086 --> 01:31:05,653
And... it stays up by itself,

1334
01:31:05,754 --> 01:31:09,990
so you don't have to wear
a helmet or anything,

1335
01:31:10,091 --> 01:31:14,126
and you can change the speeds
with these dials.

1336
01:31:14,228 --> 01:31:16,462
I...

1337
01:31:16,563 --> 01:31:18,530
I found it downstairs.

1338
01:31:21,033 --> 01:31:23,267
Here, get on.

1339
01:31:23,368 --> 01:31:25,269
Now you just... you pedal.

1340
01:31:25,370 --> 01:31:30,773
You push down with your feet.

1341
01:31:30,873 --> 01:31:33,675
Yes, like that.

1342
01:31:33,776 --> 01:31:35,543
Next week is a solitary block,

1343
01:31:35,644 --> 01:31:39,547
and I thought it would be nice
for you to have something to do.

1344
01:32:48,267 --> 01:32:50,201
Dear Marcy,

1345
01:32:50,303 --> 01:32:52,836
thank you for caring about me,

1346
01:32:52,937 --> 01:32:55,005
for trying.

1347
01:32:55,106 --> 01:32:57,674
The idea that you can fight
for something you want

1348
01:32:57,775 --> 01:32:59,609
is new to me.

1349
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:01,243
I thought before

1350
01:33:01,344 --> 01:33:04,046
that you only fought
against things you didn't.

1351
01:33:04,147 --> 01:33:07,748
But now I know there are
different ways of doing it.

1352
01:33:07,849 --> 01:33:11,551
It's not that I don't
not love you specifically.

1353
01:33:11,652 --> 01:33:14,753
I maybe don't love anyone,
maybe.

1354
01:33:14,854 --> 01:33:17,623
Or maybe that doesn't matter.

1355
01:33:17,724 --> 01:33:19,357
I'd say I wish
I could be different,

1356
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:21,359
but I don't.

1357
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:24,561
I don't know
what that would be.

1358
01:33:24,662 --> 01:33:27,764
I'm sorry I don't remember you
from before,

1359
01:33:27,865 --> 01:33:31,467
but I'll remember you now.

1360
01:33:31,568 --> 01:33:34,536
I didn't leave
because you were bad.

1361
01:33:34,637 --> 01:33:36,938
The whole point of taking
everything away from me

1362
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:38,238
in the first place

1363
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:41,642
was that I would
get to be someone.

1364
01:33:41,743 --> 01:33:45,778
I mean, I am someone,
when I'm alone.

1365
01:33:45,879 --> 01:33:48,480
But when I'm with other people,

1366
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:51,282
I am what they think I am.

1367
01:33:51,383 --> 01:33:53,317
I don't know how to be that.

1368
01:33:53,418 --> 01:33:58,955
And I think I don't want to be
something to share anymore.

1369
01:33:59,056 --> 01:34:00,823
I thought you couldn't
choose your family

1370
01:34:00,924 --> 01:34:04,992
and that you were trying
to make me choose you.

1371
01:34:05,094 --> 01:34:08,596
But then I saw
that Ben chose me.

1372
01:34:08,697 --> 01:34:11,765
He picked me out,
and he made me his.

1373
01:34:11,866 --> 01:34:14,967
And there is no one
choosing that.

1374
01:34:15,068 --> 01:34:20,405
There is no un-growing up.

1375
01:34:20,506 --> 01:34:26,276
It's time for me
to grow up for good...

1376
01:34:26,378 --> 01:34:29,412
and have something that's mine.

1377
01:34:31,848 --> 01:34:33,882
And mine only.

1378
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:50,461
Sincerely, Leia.
