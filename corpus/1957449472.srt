1
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,629
You look
just like your pictures.

2
00:00:47,696 --> 00:00:49,131
Oh, uh, good.

3
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:51,503
They don't all, you know.

4
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,173
You do a lot of online dating?

5
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,045
Lots of first dates.

6
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:59,051
Hmm. That's a weird thing
to say.

7
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:00,454
Are you gonna finish that?

8
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:02,859
Oh, uh.

9
00:01:05,163 --> 00:01:07,502
Yeah, this guy is slaying.

10
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,971
Will you just do it already?

11
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:11,510
Not yet.
He can still salvage it.

12
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:14,315
So, your profile says
you're an entrepreneur.

13
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:16,720
Big deals on the horizon.

14
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:19,492
Milliondollar ideas
percolating up here.

15
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:20,662
Like what?

16
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:22,933
Tell her, John.

17
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,605
Sorry. Do I know you?

18
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:27,374
No, but I know you.

19
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:28,644
I've looked at your file.

20
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:30,815
Philomena! What are you doing?

21
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,619
Why don't you
tell her how looking for

22
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:35,424
a real job sort of cuts into
your gaming time. Bleh!

23
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,996
But it's okay, because
you're saving money, right?

24
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:41,269
How, you might ask?
We all know the answer to that.

25
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:44,008
♪♪ By living with your mother! ♪♪

26
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:45,511
Ow!

27
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:47,682
What a kidder!

28
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:49,218
Pay no attention to her.

29
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:51,957
What you should pay attention to
is your lovely date.

30
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:53,728
You two look so good together.

31
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:56,232
Like you were
made for each other.

32
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:57,936
Ridiculous.
Just get it over with.

33
00:01:58,003 --> 00:02:01,009
This is my match.
I will deal with it my way.

34
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:02,712
Your way is outdated.

35
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:04,248
Shut it, Philomena.

36
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:05,885
I have got seniority here!

37
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,765
And you can be as pushy
and as mean as you want,

38
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:10,895
but it doesn't change the way
that people fall in love!

39
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:12,164
These two are.

40
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,936
Really nice strangers,

41
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:18,243
who I've never met but
seem to have lovely chemistry.

42
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,882
So. I'm gonna go.

43
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:24,690
See? No! Give love a chance!

44
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:25,992
Nice meeting you, John.

45
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:27,428
- Oh.
- She's getting away.

46
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,533
Grr! Fine! I'll do it your way!

47
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:41,189
Oh.

48
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:45,130
Yes! Yes, wow!
You are so bad at this.

49
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:47,334
You got me all flustered!

50
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:49,840
Uh, excuse me.

51
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:51,977
Excuse me.

52
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:54,315
You are the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.

53
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,854
Ooh. Oh, hey! She's with me.

54
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,423
Pfft. No, I'm not.

55
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,604
Wow, this is truly a shocking
display of incompetence.

56
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:02,742
Yeah, I can't concentrate while
you're hurting my feelings!

57
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,035
- Oh.
- Is he bothering you?

58
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,039
No. II'm not bothering her,

59
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:07,509
you are! You are!

60
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:09,445
She's like half your age, bro.

61
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:11,750
Ohoh. Watch who
you're shoving, punk.

62
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,086
Ooo! Escalation.

63
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:14,321
You're the punk!

64
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,294
Ooh.

65
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:18,561
Could I have a Shirley Temple?

66
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:20,267
Extra sweet stuff,
and a sugar rim?

67
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,609
Quite the dumpster fire, Ruby.

68
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:25,945
Seriously.

69
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:27,525
How many hundreds of years
have you been doing this?

70
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:28,918
I'm tuning you out.

71
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:31,489
I can't hear you.
I can only hear positivity.

72
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:33,193
Ooh. Does it sound like
police sirens?

73
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:35,197
Because I think I hear it too.
Yeah.

74
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:40,808
Wonder who that could be?

75
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,187
I don't suppose
I could convince you

76
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:43,480
to not answer th

77
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:45,618
Hey, Boss. What's up?

78
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,121
Just maybe say I'm not here.

79
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:48,022
Yeah, she's sitting
right next to me.

80
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,458
Mmhm. Yeah.

81
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:50,738
Yeah, I know,
it was a huge disaster.

82
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:51,962
Totally. It's still happening.

83
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:53,366
I'm scared to turn around.

84
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,036
Yes, sir.

85
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:00,882
You don't have
a lot of friends, do you?

86
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:02,317
The reason I ask is.

87
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:03,988
You're kind of unpleasant.

88
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:07,327
I don't waste time on friends.
My career is my friend.

89
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:11,035
Boss wants to see you. Stat.

90
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:12,705
In case that was too subtle,

91
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:16,713
what I'm saying is that you're
definitely getting fired.

92
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:43,621
Affection, Attraction,

93
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:45,156
and Love, please hold.

94
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:46,727
Affection, Attraction, and Love,

95
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:48,964
- please hold.
-

96
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,803
Affection, Attraction,
and Love, may I help you?

97
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,241
I'm afraid he no longer
handles anything directly.

98
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:56,880
We have a very competent staff.

99
00:05:56,947 --> 00:05:59,451
Okay. Thank you.

100
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:02,324
Yes?

101
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:03,391
Oh, me?

102
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:04,563
Speak!

103
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:07,401
Hi. He's expecting me.

104
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,071
And you are?

105
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:10,942
Oh! Sorry! I'm Ruby.

106
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:12,448
I've been here like
a thousand times.

107
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:13,557
I just thought
you might remember.

108
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,083
Mister C, she's here.

109
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,154
I'm sure he's busy.
I can just hang out in the

110
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:18,456
He's been waiting for you.

111
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:19,659
Ohh! Well.

112
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:23,233
That fills my soul with dread!

113
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,736
Just kidding.

114
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:26,740
Okay, here I go. Wish me luck.

115
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:30,982
Scale of one to ten,
how mad would you

116
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:33,052
Affection, Attraction, and Love.

117
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:36,827
No guarantees. It's love,
not a used Buick.

118
00:06:36,893 --> 00:06:38,564
Listen, Bernie, what can I say?

119
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,070
Love stinks. People get hurt.

120
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:44,150
You gotta admit, a lot of
great songs come out of it.

121
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:46,178
So will you get off
my back, please?

122
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:48,149
All right, I'll see you
at the club on Tuesday.

123
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:50,688
A brawl!

124
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:51,833
It was really
more of a skirmish.

125
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:53,226
A brawl!

126
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:57,301
A brawl! You turned
a Level Three date into a brawl?

127
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,570
How did you?

128
00:06:58,637 --> 00:06:59,739
It's trending.

129
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:02,879
Great. She's here. Hi.

130
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:04,324
You wanna take over
the bow and arrow?

131
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:06,152
Huh? You better shape up.

132
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,089
Truth.

133
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:10,160
Ruby, this job isn't easy.

134
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:11,563
It never has been,

135
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,299
and it's not gettin' any easier.

136
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,836
Love has gotten lazy lately.

137
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:17,542
You got dating apps,
uh. reality TV.

138
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:19,946
I don't even recognize
the planet anymore.

139
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:22,819
Argh! But Cupid,
you are so good at what you do.

140
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:25,023
You are way too young to retire.

141
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,566
Nah, nah, I'm getting old.
I still look good.

142
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:30,735
You do. Oh, like a fox.

143
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:33,106
I do. I look very good lately.

144
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:34,809
But these people.

145
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:37,749
They're they're fickle,
impatient, selfish.

146
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:41,122
Love shouldn't be like that.

147
00:07:41,188 --> 00:07:42,725
And you.

148
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:46,065
Want to take over the reins
of this operation, huh?

149
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,537
Well, I don't think
you have the stomach for it.

150
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:50,307
She doesn't. I do!

151
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:52,311
I love love!

152
00:07:52,377 --> 00:07:55,150
When they find that person
who completes them.

153
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:56,787
Who makes them happy.

154
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,659
You know,
who they were made for.

155
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:02,532
I am made for finding
that one person for everyone,

156
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:04,736
and this job is made for me.

157
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:07,207
That's not what
her numbers say, though.

158
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:08,877
You're right.

159
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:13,520
Your numbers are low.
They have been for a long time.

160
00:08:13,587 --> 00:08:15,390
It's tough out there. Right?

161
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:17,494
No one believes in soulmates.

162
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:18,840
No one believes
in love at first sight.

163
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:21,068
Wh no one even
believes in true love!

164
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:24,108
In the old days,
you fell in love,

165
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:26,145
it was forever.

166
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:29,051
Of course, you only lived
'til 35, so it was tolerable.

167
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:30,420
Things are different now.

168
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:32,692
I think you're too sensitive
for this kind of work.

169
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,196
Too sensitive for love? Come on!

170
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:39,973
All right.

171
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,777
All right, I'll give you
one more chance.

172
00:08:41,843 --> 00:08:43,479
What? What?

173
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:46,920
No no. What a what a great idea.

174
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:50,528
Merciful is what you are.

175
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:53,132
Yes, I am. Thank you, Cupid.

176
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,636
Just you wait, all right.

177
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:56,181
I'm gonna be turning
those numbers upside down.

178
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:58,877
The world is gonna
be romantic again.

179
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:01,817
I'm not asking you to
set the world on fire.

180
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:04,154
Just make one person
fall in love.

181
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:06,893
And I've got
the perfect case for ya.

182
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,999
Oh. A case from the XFiles.

183
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:16,078
If you can find romance
for this guy,

184
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:19,084
then you are worthy
of being the god of love.

185
00:09:20,955 --> 00:09:23,560
Charlie Conrad.
College professor.

186
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:26,031
We call him "the anomaly".

187
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,568
He's unmatchable.

188
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,572
But there's someone
for everyone.

189
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,075
Not this guy.

190
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:34,281
But he seems nice.

191
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:43,366
I could show you
50 more clips just like that.

192
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:47,775
Every opportunity for romance
seems to go wrong.

193
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:51,015
Either his timing is off.
Or he's trying too hard.

194
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:53,687
Right now, I think he's
given up trying altogether.

195
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:55,290
Poor guy.

196
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:56,560
Poor you.

197
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:58,362
This is your last chance.

198
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:00,901
You've got until Christmas Eve.

199
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,972
Got your holidays
mixed up, don't you?

200
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:05,534
You think that's funny, huh?

201
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:08,449
No.

202
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:10,463
You know the last time
I had a Christmas vacation?

203
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:12,190
1472.

204
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:15,096
1472, the last Christmas
I saw my family,

205
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:18,269
Christmas tree,
presents, eggnog.

206
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:19,639
I want a Christmas vacation.

207
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,275
You deserve
a Christmas vacation, sir.

208
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:23,514
I do! Philomena, go along

209
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,083
and assist her. Sir!

210
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,955
When the clock strikes
midnight on Christmas Eve,

211
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:31,228
you will either take my place
as the god of love.

212
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,734
Or you won't.
Now get out of here.

213
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,571
Thank you.

214
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,970
- Boo.
-

215
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:56,345
Really professional.

216
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:58,425
If you could just try not
to traumatize the mortals.

217
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,788
Mm. You teaching me
about professionalism?

218
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:02,123
That is hilarious.

219
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,894
I know you're here to assist me,

220
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:05,296
but I'd rather work alone.

221
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:06,976
Okay, this job's going to be
a piece of cake.

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,839
I just I just
need to find the target.

223
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:12,545
Target acquired.

224
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,682
Huh.

225
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:17,287
So, what's the plan?

226
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:19,124
You gonna chat him up?

227
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:20,837
Ask him what he's looking for
in a soul mate?

228
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:23,432
Give him a
"What's your type?" survey?

229
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:25,036
Nope. That's the old me, okay?

230
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:26,940
No more hopeless romantic Ruby.

231
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:30,981
Say hello to Imeanbusiness Ruby.

232
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:32,048
Hm.

233
00:11:34,254 --> 00:11:35,423
Bingo.

234
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:49,418
Hm. I'm impressed.

235
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:51,155
Maybe you have changed.

236
00:11:58,402 --> 00:11:59,539
Hi.

237
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:00,874
I'm sorry. What?

238
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:03,680
You gotta Oh.

239
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:05,884
I, uh. oh, man.

240
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,788
It's, uh, I always
drop these things.

241
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:09,024
Ow!

242
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:11,362
- Oh, no! Oh, no!
- Argh!

243
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:13,199
Oh.

244
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,268
Are you serious?

245
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,840
Oh, man. I'm so sorry.

246
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:18,944
Can I at least pay
for your dry cleaning?

247
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:22,384
Oh, man. Oh, those are tests!

248
00:12:24,388 --> 00:12:25,591
Oooh ooh.

249
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:31,101
Oh, yes! Yes!

250
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,007
Oh, that was amazing.

251
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:36,513
Oh, my god. I need to.

252
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:39,318
No.

253
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:46,298
Oh!

254
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,102
Here, let me help.

255
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:52,745
Come on.

256
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,456
Oooh! Ooh, watch your step.

257
00:12:58,523 --> 00:12:59,523
Okay.

258
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,900
You okay?

259
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:06,271
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm good.

260
00:13:06,338 --> 00:13:08,409
Thanks. Just, uh.

261
00:13:08,476 --> 00:13:09,679
Fell in the thing.

262
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:11,650
Yeah. I saw.

263
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:13,319
Yeah.

264
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:15,858
You and everybody else
on campus.

265
00:13:16,993 --> 00:13:18,697
Nothing to see here, folks.

266
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,977
Just a grown man who can't seem
to make it through a semester

267
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,105
without fallin' in the fountain.

268
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:24,107
Oh, this has happened before?

269
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:25,343
It's a sore subject.

270
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,615
Rather not talk about it,
really.

271
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,153
Ooh.

272
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:31,956
It's cold, right?

273
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:35,798
Aah, it's winter.
Almost Christmas.

274
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:36,933
Oh, right.

275
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,269
Here you go.

276
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:41,375
Where'd you get this?

277
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:43,880
Always be prepared.
That is my motto.

278
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:45,049
I'm Ruby.

279
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:47,586
Good motto.

280
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,529
Well, I gotta go.

281
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,432
Really only so much
humiliation I can take

282
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,036
in one day at one time.

283
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:56,381
And, well, I think I might be
freezing to death, so.

284
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:57,951
Okay. Keep it.
Early Christmas present.

285
00:13:57,975 --> 00:13:59,545
Thanks.

286
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:01,115
Welcome.

287
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:04,722
Yeah, new towel. Pink.
Really brings out my eyes.

288
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:06,960
Oh, yeah.

289
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:08,530
Okay, bye.

290
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:12,538
See you around, Charlie.

291
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:21,623
What a nerd.

292
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:23,860
He's sweet.

293
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:27,233
Good luck finding someone who
agrees with you by Christmas.

294
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,607
Twelve days, Ruby.
Clock is ticking.

295
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:39,024
So without a solid working
knowledge of history,

296
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:41,663
history is doomed
to repeat itself.

297
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,234
And if we realize that
we didn't treat people well,

298
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,004
or if we realized that,
you know,

299
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:48,342
maybe there's a better way
to do these things,

300
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:51,014
we can do it better
the next time.

301
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:52,401
Yeah, yeah. I'm kind of confused

302
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,622
Hey, Gina. I was Todd!

303
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,093
I'm having a conversation.

304
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,530
So I was Hi, excuse me.

305
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,166
Can I talk to you guys?

306
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,638
I have a few questions
about Charlie.

307
00:15:02,705 --> 00:15:05,176
Who's Charlie?
She means Professor Conrad.

308
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:06,913
Are you a cop?
She looks like a cop.

309
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,052
Um. I'm wearing pink.

310
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:14,027
I'm, uh. I'm a reporter.
And I'm I'm writing a story

311
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:15,798
and I'm looking
for some background.

312
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:18,202
On Professor Conrad?

313
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:21,776
Not to be mean, but he isn't
exactly the kind of person

314
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:24,114
you would write
an article about.

315
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,387
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

316
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:31,428
Whatever background he has,
I promise you it is boring.

317
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:34,602
Well, maybe not looking
like a cop is your whole thing.

318
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,639
I'm onto you. cop.

319
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:44,020
Hi. You look like
a bright young man.

320
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:45,624
What can you tell me
about Charlie?

321
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:47,595
I mean, he's
he's like a teacher.

322
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:49,431
It's not like we hang out.

323
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:50,701
Yeah.

324
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,673
He's nice, I guess, but
kind of unreasonable?

325
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,711
Like when I tell him
I don't have my project

326
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:57,982
because my life has been
so extra right now?

327
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,451
And he gives me an extension,

328
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,523
but it's not really
enough of an extension.

329
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:03,560
And then he doesn't even like,
try to understand

330
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:06,098
that I have a lot
going on right now.

331
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,739
But, you know, nice.

332
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:11,208
Nice.

333
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:13,179
I like that he doesn't
pretend to know my name.

334
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:14,749
None of the teachers
know my name.

335
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:17,120
But Professor Conrad
doesn't pretend like he does.

336
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:18,857
I'll remember your name.

337
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:19,992
What's your name?

338
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,596
Well, as far as teachers go,

339
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:23,767
he's probably like,
my second favorite,

340
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,771
but that's really just because
I hate history.

341
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:26,906
Like, I hate it.

342
00:16:26,973 --> 00:16:27,908
Why are you yelling?

343
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:29,879
I'm expressing myself.

344
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,048
Do you need a hug?

345
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:35,557
Hi, Charlie!

346
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:38,830
Oh! Whoa, hey.

347
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,233
You're, uh. you gave me

348
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,536
the pink towel.

349
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:43,038
Yeah. Mmhm, that's me, Ruby.

350
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:44,742
- Right. Well, hi again.
- Hi.

351
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,589
Charlie, I have the offer
of a lifetime for you.

352
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:50,219
Oh? What do you mean?
Selling essential oils?

353
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:52,156
I hear they're really great,
but no, no.

354
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,461
I'm here to help you.

355
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,431
Help me what?

356
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:57,835
Fall in love.

357
00:16:57,902 --> 00:17:00,182
Hmm, wow, that sounds fun, but.
Not really in the market.

358
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:01,509
So nice seeing you again.

359
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:03,279
You know, it's nice
to see you too!

360
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:04,725
See, Charlie, I'm what
you could call a matchmaker.

361
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:06,553
Ah, so you want me
to pay you to fix me up?

362
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,357
For you, totally free. Mm.

363
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:11,461
So you're a matchmaker
for charity cases?

364
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,467
Yes! But I can see by your face
that's a bad thing.

365
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:15,637
So, no.

366
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:17,307
No, II.

367
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:19,244
II can just help you be happy.

368
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:22,150
Yeah, thanks but no thanks.

369
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:25,323
But. but you're lonely.

370
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:27,861
Ddon't you want love?
Everybody wants love.

371
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:29,865
No, not me. I've retired.

372
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:31,745
But don't you want a sweetheart
to spend Christmas with?

373
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:33,573
No, I do not want that.

374
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:36,512
You seem nice.

375
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:38,148
Oh.

376
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:39,785
You helped me
out of the fountain.

377
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:40,787
Gave you a towel.

378
00:17:40,854 --> 00:17:42,625
Gave me a towel. But.

379
00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:47,400
Not to be rude, but.
You're kind of freaking me out.

380
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,471
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

381
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:52,343
So, if you stop walking,
I'll keep walking and

382
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,515
and and we can just.

383
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:55,918
I don't want to freak you out.

384
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:57,320
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, yeah.

385
00:17:57,387 --> 00:17:58,523
- Okay.
- Bye.

386
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,750
Oh, see you around, Charlie.

387
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:00,994
Yup, okay.

388
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:03,065
Man!

389
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,538
Okay, Charlie. We need to talk.

390
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,111
Why are you in my house?

391
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:27,480
Because I mean business.

392
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:29,719
Well, that is terrifying.

393
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:33,192
Look, I don't have any money.
I'm a teacher.

394
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:35,096
What? No, I'm
I'm freaking you out again.

395
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:36,231
I'm Ruby. Remember?

396
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:37,400
With the Ah. oh, yes!

397
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:39,939
Wait! The towel.
Hold on. Hold on.

398
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:41,776
Aaaah.

399
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:44,849
Ah! Here. Here, take

400
00:18:49,892 --> 00:18:50,894
I don't want the towel.

401
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:07,493
Charlie!

402
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:09,832
That lamp was like
the nicest thing in here.

403
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:12,871
Can we dial this down a notch?

404
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:14,007
No!

405
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:15,677
Help!

406
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:17,881
Oh.

407
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,805
I think I might have used
the wrong tactic here.

408
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:31,341
Can we start over?

409
00:19:33,078 --> 00:19:35,082
Okay, good.

410
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:36,351
Ahh.

411
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:39,057
What is going on?

412
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:41,796
So this is gonna
sound weird, but.

413
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:42,965
Have you heard of Cupid?

414
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:44,300
Cupid?

415
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:47,106
Like, as in.
Valentine's Day Cupid?

416
00:19:47,173 --> 00:19:50,614
Yes! But he's Cupid every day.

417
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:54,320
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

418
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:56,458
I've never told a mortal before,

419
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:58,429
but I only have 11 days.

420
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:00,199
So gloves are coming off,
Charlie.

421
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,826
But youyou're
not gonna hit me, right?

422
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,140
Oh, no, no, no. I'm
I'm not gonna hit you.

423
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:06,411
I'm not gonna hit you. Okay?

424
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:10,386
II'm about to tell you
a really big secret.

425
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:12,725
And I need you
to prepare yourself.

426
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,791
Okay.

427
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:18,302
I work for Cupid.
And if things go well,

428
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:19,905
I'm going to
move into his position

429
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:23,112
and become the god of love,
if you can believe it.

430
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,349
Or I guess, the goddess of love.

431
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,288
I guess you could say
I'm a Cupid in training.

432
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:29,424
That is fascinating.

433
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:31,027
Yes.

434
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:34,902
What are the job requirements
for something like that?

435
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:36,539
Well.

436
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:37,606
Hey!

437
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:42,885
Ooh!

438
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:48,961
Oops.

439
00:20:56,077 --> 00:20:57,681
Feeling better?

440
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:00,921
Before you broke into my house
and beat me up? No.

441
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:03,091
Beat you up
is a bit of an exaggeration.

442
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:05,797
I was trying to explain to you
when you flipped out.

443
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,610
Yeah, well, I've recently
sustained a head injury.

444
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,972
So please recap.
You're, uh, Cupid?

445
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,243
His apprentice.

446
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,715
Mm. Fat baby
in a diaper with wings?

447
00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:16,853
Well, he's not a baby anymore.

448
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,489
And for obvious reasons,

449
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:20,927
HR convinced him to start
wearing pants a long time ago.

450
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:22,263
But yeah.

451
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,467
So you're like a goddess.
Oh, no.

452
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:26,906
No? No, no.

453
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:30,246
Oh, no.
Demigod, magical immortal,

454
00:21:30,312 --> 00:21:32,049
interfering
in the lives of humans,

455
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:33,185
that kind of thing.

456
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:35,189
Ruby the Immortal.

457
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:38,328
My real name is Cherub.
But Ruby just has more zing.

458
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:40,767
Don't you think?
Way more zing, yeah.

459
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:43,873
And, um, I'm sorry,
but you're bothering me why?

460
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,209
I'm helping you.

461
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:48,015
Helping you find love.

462
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:52,925
Okay. Great.
Well, I'm a little tired, uh,

463
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:55,496
so I'm going to go to bed.
But you can call me tomorrow,

464
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,109
and we'll schedule a little
lovefinding session.

465
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,168
No time.

466
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,470
We're on a ticking clock here.

467
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:01,274
I have until midnight
on Christmas Eve

468
00:22:01,341 --> 00:22:03,312
to make you fall in love.

469
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:05,316
Uh, Christmas isn't
even your holiday.

470
00:22:05,382 --> 00:22:07,654
I know. It's a
little arbitrary, but

471
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:09,859
what are you gonna do?

472
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:11,963
Why me?

473
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:15,035
Well, because,
according to Cupid,

474
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:21,081
you are the most romantically
hopeless person on Earth.

475
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:24,989
On Earth?
Out of everyone? Really?

476
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:26,635
Like not even just
the state of Virginia,

477
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:27,594
but like all the states
everywhere,

478
00:22:27,661 --> 00:22:28,897
and all the countries?

479
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:30,867
Yeah.

480
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:34,173
Wow! I've reached an allnew low.

481
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,146
I just let the opinion
of an imaginary flying baby

482
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:38,983
hurt my feelings.

483
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,787
You still
don't believe me, do you?

484
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:44,394
No. No. That you're
a magical cherub? Not at all.

485
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,799
Okay. We have to fix that.

486
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,435
No.

487
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:49,905
This might be
a little unnerving.

488
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:50,972
Wait, wait, wait, what?

489
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:54,480
Take a look around.

490
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:56,384
Wha. What do you see?

491
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:58,488
I'm in my underwear!

492
00:22:58,556 --> 00:22:59,959
Possibility!

493
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:02,496
The possibility of love
around every corner.

494
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:04,635
Hey, hey, could she be the one?

495
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:08,676
What about her? What about him?

496
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:11,782
The world is full of
romantic possibilities.

497
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,354
Did did you drug me?
How did you get me here?

498
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,057
No wonder
you don't believe in love.

499
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:17,393
You don't believe in magic.

500
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,197
This is insane!

501
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,466
Cupid is not real!

502
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,069
He's an antiquated idea

503
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,749
that was repackaged by
the marketing department

504
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:24,818
- of some greeting card company.
-

505
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:25,844
Oh!

506
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:27,079
- Uhoh, fuzz!
-

507
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:28,448
Hey, be cool.

508
00:23:28,516 --> 00:23:30,520
Uh, ma'am,
is this man bothering you?

509
00:23:30,587 --> 00:23:31,956
She's bothering me.

510
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:35,362
She's a witch
or she's magic or something!

511
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:36,642
You think you're dressed
appropriately

512
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,901
to be in a public area?

513
00:23:37,968 --> 00:23:39,805
Well, I'm. obviously, Officer,

514
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:41,384
if I'd known that I was going
to be magically transported,

515
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:42,978
I would have put on pants.

516
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:44,724
Okay, why don't you calm down
and come with me, all right?

517
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:46,060
I can get you out of this,
Charlie.

518
00:23:46,084 --> 00:23:47,153
No, ma'am. You can't.

519
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:48,219
Oh, okay.

520
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:49,725
I totally can.

521
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,428
Sir, don't make this difficult.

522
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:54,133
Just promise
you'll try and find love.

523
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,539
I'm not gonna promise anything!
I just want to go home!

524
00:23:56,606 --> 00:23:59,377
Okay, so we'll do it
the hard way.

525
00:23:59,444 --> 00:24:00,523
I don't want to fall in love.

526
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:01,625
I got my classes and my books.

527
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:02,584
And that's all I need!

528
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,287
Good to know, pal.

529
00:24:04,354 --> 00:24:06,033
I have until Christmas Eve
to convince you you're wrong.

530
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:08,596
Ma'am, can you please step back?

531
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:10,232
Okay, okay. Okay.
Okay. I give up.

532
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:11,769
Say it!

533
00:24:11,836 --> 00:24:13,840
Say "I promise I'll do
whatever Ruby wants me to",

534
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:15,677
so I can find love
and be happy!"

535
00:24:15,744 --> 00:24:18,057
Fine, fine. I promise I'll do
whatever Ruby wants me to do

536
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,618
so I can find love and be happy.

537
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:22,390
Wow, we got a couple of
real romantics here.

538
00:24:22,456 --> 00:24:23,993
But on one condition:

539
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,472
I'm not gonna have you tricking
me into falling in love.

540
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:27,500
No. Magic.

541
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,304
Sure, pal. No magic.

542
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,783
You're really tying
my hands here, Charlie.

543
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:33,045
Promise, or no deal!

544
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:35,650
Okay, no magic.

545
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:39,057
Don't worry, Romeo.

546
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:41,328
- Everything's gonna be just fine.
-

547
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,381
Hi!

548
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,018
Aah! Would you please

549
00:24:53,085 --> 00:24:55,255
stop popping up
everywhere like that?

550
00:24:55,322 --> 00:24:56,659
It's really disconcerting.

551
00:24:56,726 --> 00:24:58,362
I certainly don't
want you disconcerted,

552
00:24:58,428 --> 00:25:00,576
but we don't have time for
another little flipout, do we?

553
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,506
Charlie, you promised.

554
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:05,476
I have class, Ruby. I teach.

555
00:25:05,543 --> 00:25:07,213
See, that's what I do.
That's my job.

556
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,026
Kind of like your job is
breaking into people's houses

557
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,362
and harassing them
until they agree

558
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,756
to let you set them up on dates.

559
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:13,267
Yeah, well, that's not
a fair assessment.

560
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,828
Fine.

561
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:16,264
Do your little
romance experiment

562
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:19,571
after I'm done working, okay?
That's the deal.

563
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:21,842
Well, how long will that be?

564
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:23,922
I'll tell you what, go into
that building right there,

565
00:25:23,946 --> 00:25:25,984
talk to my boss,
tell her you work for Cupid,

566
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:27,788
and that I need
some vacation days

567
00:25:27,854 --> 00:25:30,894
so that we can go on the hunt
for my perfect person.

568
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,697
I'm sure that'll go great
for you.

569
00:25:43,118 --> 00:25:44,287
Hi!

570
00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:46,659
Why did you
roll up on me like that?

571
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:48,529
You just made me pee a little.

572
00:25:48,596 --> 00:25:50,099
- Terry! Terry!
-

573
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:53,673
How did

574
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,018
Okay, how did she
get in my office?

575
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:56,579
How did you You know what?

576
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:58,516
Always on top of it,
right, Terry?

577
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,352
Out!

578
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,557
Something wrong with that boy.

579
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,926
Are you Charlie's boss?

580
00:26:03,993 --> 00:26:05,429
Does he work
at this institution?

581
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:06,999
Yes. Then I'm his boss.

582
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,270
My name is Ruby Valentine,
and I need your help.

583
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:11,007
This won't hurt a bit.

584
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,554
Girl, I got you.

585
00:26:17,621 --> 00:26:18,832
So in light of that perspective,

586
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:20,092
I'm curious to know what

587
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,494
- your thoughts are.
-

588
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:22,664
Charlie!

589
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,137
Oh, hi.

590
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:29,143
What are you doing here?

591
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,923
I did what you said.
I talked to your boss.

592
00:26:30,947 --> 00:26:32,349
I'm sorry, you did what?

593
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:35,557
Hey! Look at all your fresh,
young faces.

594
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:38,663
Just learnin' and growin'
and gettin' smarter.

595
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:40,432
I feel good! Y'all feel good?

596
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:43,238
Hi. Dean Wozniak!

597
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:44,373
Hi. Oh.

598
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,044
Charlie. CharlieCharlieCharlie.

599
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:48,816
Oh, honey,
please don't ever wear

600
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,553
that shirt again.
That is an ugly shirt.

601
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,291
Oh, mmmm. No.

602
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:55,395
Is there something that
I can help you with?

603
00:26:55,462 --> 00:26:57,066
You sure can.

604
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:59,246
Do you see this beautiful,
intelligent woman right here?

605
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,372
Ain't she pretty?

606
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,474
Um, well, I

607
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:02,542
She's cute.

608
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:03,679
Super hot.

609
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:05,149
I don't see it.

610
00:27:05,215 --> 00:27:06,752
Okay, okay. This young lady. uh,

611
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:08,121
what's your name again, sweetie?

612
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:09,758
Ruby Valentine.
Ruby Valentine! Yes.

613
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:12,463
That's the most amazing
name I've ever heard.

614
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm a visiting professor,

615
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,746
and I'm here to oversee Charlie
and correct him

616
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,339
whenever he's wrong about stuff.

617
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:19,978
And she's the boss and says
I can be here all the time

618
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:21,882
and do anything I want. Right?

619
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:23,753
Right, right. I'm the boss.

620
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,790
Yes. She can be here
anytime she wants,

621
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:26,759
she can be here
as long as she wants,

622
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:27,861
and do what she wants.

623
00:27:27,928 --> 00:27:30,399
I have spoken! Yes.

624
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:32,102
Well, I'm gonna go take a nap,

625
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:34,416
'cause whoo, I feel wonderful.
Don't y'all feel wonderful?

626
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,545
Did I say that already?
I don't know.

627
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:38,181
I just feel good.

628
00:27:38,248 --> 00:27:39,694
And that's an ugly shirt. Ooo,
child, that's an ugly shirt.

629
00:27:39,718 --> 00:27:40,987
- Don't wear that tomorrow.
-

630
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:42,299
What was that?
What are you doing?

631
00:27:42,323 --> 00:27:43,559
My job. No, no.

632
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:44,862
That's what I'm doing.

633
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:46,368
What you're doing
is called stalking.

634
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,603
She's way too hot
to be stalking you.

635
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:49,705
Truth.

636
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:51,809
You guys are so nice.

637
00:27:51,876 --> 00:27:54,882
Oh! You're that cop.

638
00:27:54,948 --> 00:27:56,384
- No.
- I knew it.

639
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:04,033
And that's how Napoleon and
Josephine fell in love.

640
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,373
So beautiful.

641
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:10,345
I have to say this is the first
I've ever found history

642
00:28:10,412 --> 00:28:11,749
interesting in my life.

643
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,653
Okay, okay.
That's great. That's great.

644
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:15,159
Can we all now
get back to the reason

645
00:28:15,222 --> 00:28:16,367
that we're actually here,
in the first place?

646
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:18,028
Absolutely. Thank you

647
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:19,297
- for keeping us on track.
-

648
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:21,167
Who here thinks
Charlie is dateable?

649
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:23,171
Whoa! Show of hands.

650
00:28:23,238 --> 00:28:24,942
No, thithithis
is totally inappropriate.

651
00:28:25,008 --> 00:28:26,545
Do not answer this

652
00:28:26,612 --> 00:28:30,252
He's cute. But there's
a lack of effort happening here.

653
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,826
Agreed. I mean,
did you sleep in those clothes?

654
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:35,333
You should pay
more than six dollars

655
00:28:35,395 --> 00:28:36,565
for a haircut.

656
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,335
And you can be a bit.

657
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:39,504
Abrasive.

658
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:40,907
All right! See?

659
00:28:40,974 --> 00:28:43,679
That's a real turnoff,
Professor Conrad.

660
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:45,215
Step one in finding you love

661
00:28:45,282 --> 00:28:46,995
should be a makeover.
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

662
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:49,858
You promised.
Okay, whatever it takes.

663
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:51,160
The quicker you find love,

664
00:28:51,227 --> 00:28:52,667
the quicker
I'll be out of your life.

665
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,568
I don't get it.

666
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:56,404
What are you guys talking about?

667
00:28:56,471 --> 00:28:59,210
Class project!
I'm gonna need all your help.

668
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:01,515
I'm a bit out of the loop
with modern dating

669
00:29:01,582 --> 00:29:04,755
and Charlie here needs
all the help he can get.

670
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:06,592
We're trying to set
Professor Conrad up

671
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:07,727
like on a date?

672
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:09,898
More than that! Love.

673
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,367
Love is a myth.

674
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:12,580
It's simply our brain chemistry
tricking us

675
00:29:12,604 --> 00:29:13,739
to propagate the species.

676
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:15,510
Thank you, Gina.

677
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:18,348
Okay, you're my next project,
but let's stay focused, okay?

678
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:20,853
We have ten days
to find love for Charlie.

679
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,993
I'm open to any
and all suggestions. Go!

680
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,103
I mean.

681
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:32,209
There's like a thousand apps.

682
00:29:32,276 --> 00:29:34,881
Ooh, apps.

683
00:29:34,948 --> 00:29:39,123
Applications on the computer.
Intriguing.

684
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,494
Uh, personally,
I've always avoided them.

685
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:43,633
You know, I like to take
a more handson approach,

686
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,870
but desperate times
call for desperate measures.

687
00:29:45,937 --> 00:29:47,039
All right, class is over.

688
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:48,542
What about your dating profile?

689
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:50,647
Multiple photos and a bio?

690
00:29:50,713 --> 00:29:53,686
Are you sure you're ready for
this level of selfmarketing?

691
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:55,757
And don't forget photo touchups.

692
00:29:55,823 --> 00:29:58,461
Trust me.
I don't think you want to post

693
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:00,065
an unedited photo.

694
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,935
They're right.
We need their help.

695
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:07,681
They have other classes.

696
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:08,783
No, I'm I'm free.

697
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:09,985
I can skip.

698
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:12,423
This is way more interesting.

699
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,240
Build?

700
00:30:21,307 --> 00:30:22,644
Skinny?

701
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:23,979
Frail?

702
00:30:24,046 --> 00:30:25,817
He's got some tone to him, but

703
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:27,721
it wouldn't kill you
to hit the gym.

704
00:30:27,787 --> 00:30:29,090
So, athletic.

705
00:30:29,156 --> 00:30:31,595
Let's not get crazy.

706
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:32,731
He's tall.

707
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:33,966
Boom. That means a lot.

708
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,168
It means everything.

709
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,072
Can't we just put that he's tall

710
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:39,443
and leave out
all the personality bits?

711
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:41,156
Wow. This is a new level
of humiliation for me,

712
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,784
so thanks for that, guys.

713
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:44,688
Oh, toughen up.

714
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:46,224
So what are your interests?

715
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:49,296
And let's stay away from
the boring ones, shall we?

716
00:30:49,363 --> 00:30:50,609
You know what,
I really don't need you guys

717
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,036
to make a dating app for me.

718
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:55,977
It's actually a dating profile,
and yes, you do.

719
00:30:56,044 --> 00:30:57,179
Well, whatever it's called,

720
00:30:57,246 --> 00:30:58,649
I don't need it,
I don't want it.

721
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:00,853
So you guys can just do
whatever you want to do.

722
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,724
I don't care.

723
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,326
Bye.

724
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:07,366
Oh, you should add
that he's fiery and passionate.

725
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:10,405
- Oh.
- Ooh, I like that.

726
00:31:10,472 --> 00:31:11,775
I don't get it.

727
00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:13,755
What kind of person
doesn't want to fall in love?

728
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:14,981
The damaged kind.

729
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:15,950
Oh, no, no, no.
Put that, put that.

730
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:17,186
We love damage.

731
00:31:18,388 --> 00:31:19,390
All done.

732
00:31:20,626 --> 00:31:21,995
That's really good.

733
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:23,474
You know, if I saw that,
I would actually think

734
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:24,498
he's kind of cute.

735
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:28,341
Oh, which is gross.

736
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:29,845
Post it!

737
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:31,356
Any girl would look at this
and want a date with Charlie.

738
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,218
Plus, it's cuffing season.

739
00:31:33,284 --> 00:31:34,797
Standards are as low
as they get all year.

740
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:38,027
Right. Wait, what?

741
00:31:38,094 --> 00:31:40,232
Too high maintenance.

742
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,035
Too fun.

743
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:44,140
- Too cool.
-

744
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:46,144
Being a little picky, aren't we?

745
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,656
Okay, not that it's
any of your business,

746
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,918
but I'm trying to find
the right woman for him.

747
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:51,254
Right.

748
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,158
The same way that
you've always done it.

749
00:31:53,224 --> 00:31:56,598
Taking your time, choosing
nothing but the best candidates.

750
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,602
You want my advice?

751
00:31:58,669 --> 00:31:59,938
Not really.

752
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:01,642
Ruby, you have to go all in.

753
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,612
Find him as many possibilities
as you can.

754
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,115
This is a numbers game.

755
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:07,319
Oh, just match him
with everyone willynilly?

756
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:09,390
I'm not gonna do that.
That's not how I operate.

757
00:32:09,457 --> 00:32:11,236
Well, that's exactly why
your job is on the line,

758
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,630
in the first place.

759
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,570
Same old Ruby,
same old mistakes.

760
00:32:15,636 --> 00:32:17,683
But, look, all right, whatever.
I mean, what do I care?

761
00:32:17,707 --> 00:32:19,978
Do it your way.
I'm just trying to help you.

762
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:23,451
Philomena?

763
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,424
Do you know
what cuffing season is?

764
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:28,361
You don't?

765
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:31,334
And you're next in line
to be the God of Love?

766
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,506
Wow, I cannot.
I will see you upstairs.

767
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:39,618
Argh! Whatever.

768
00:32:41,387 --> 00:32:45,563
Like. Like. Like. Like. Like.

769
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:51,942
I can't believe
I'm on a date with a teacher.

770
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:56,250
I mean, I feel like
I just graduated.

771
00:32:56,317 --> 00:32:57,987
Whwhen exactly was that?

772
00:32:58,054 --> 00:33:00,626
Oh, months and months ago.

773
00:33:00,693 --> 00:33:01,795
Hmm.

774
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:03,398
This drink is delish!

775
00:33:07,272 --> 00:33:08,943
We're all gonna die someday.

776
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:11,849
So what's the point, right?

777
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:13,151
That's pretty dark.

778
00:33:13,218 --> 00:33:16,023
I mean, look at us.
Two lonely people

779
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,127
desperately seeking
companionship

780
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:20,700
when in the end,
we're all just gonna die alone.

781
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:21,766
Okay.

782
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,143
I don't want to waste your time

783
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,281
and I certainly don't
want you wasting mine.

784
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:30,620
I want a husband. I want kids.

785
00:33:30,686 --> 00:33:32,322
I want a big weddin'.

786
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:35,696
And I want a yearlong
engagement with a big ring.

787
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,967
And if I want all of
these things, which I do,

788
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:39,671
then I need to move quickly.

789
00:33:39,738 --> 00:33:41,183
Could you see yourself
proposing to me

790
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:42,677
in the next three to six months?

791
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:49,189
So, this is Alfie.

792
00:33:49,256 --> 00:33:51,427
He is so bad.

793
00:33:51,494 --> 00:33:53,264
This is Josephine.

794
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,901
How many cats do you have?

795
00:33:54,968 --> 00:33:56,270
Twelve.

796
00:33:56,337 --> 00:33:58,976
There are five more
outdoor babies but

797
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:01,414
they're not really mine, per se.
Hm.

798
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,951
You have a lot more
women coming?

799
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:04,854
Because my shift is almost over.

800
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:06,157
More women?

801
00:34:06,224 --> 00:34:09,330
Casanova has been here
for hours.

802
00:34:12,904 --> 00:34:15,084
I think she's just upset 'cause
I've had four blind dates

803
00:34:15,108 --> 00:34:16,545
and then all I've ordered
is water.

804
00:34:16,612 --> 00:34:18,314
Tonight?

805
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:20,218
Christmas is in a week.

806
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:21,725
Don't want to be alone
on Christmas?

807
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:22,924
Hm.

808
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:24,426
I get it. It's cuffing season.

809
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:26,264
You know, I don't know
what that means.

810
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,977
And I'd be fine to be alone
except that somehow

811
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:30,740
I've managed to become
part of a giant cosmic bet.

812
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:32,610
See that woman over there

813
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:33,679
sliding down on her seat?

814
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:35,215
Yeah, that's Cupid.

815
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:38,488
Or Cupid's assistant. Hey,
are you his assistant?

816
00:34:38,555 --> 00:34:39,691
What?

817
00:34:41,494 --> 00:34:43,097
Cupid set us up
using a dating app?

818
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,601
I know, right?

819
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,605
I told her she couldn't
use any magic, though,

820
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:48,450
and she only has a week to make
me fall in love by Christmas.

821
00:34:48,474 --> 00:34:49,744
Don't you mean Valentine's Day?

822
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:50,846
That's what I said!

823
00:34:50,913 --> 00:34:53,117
No. Christmas.

824
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:54,964
Apparently, Cupid wants to
spend the holiday on his boat

825
00:34:54,988 --> 00:34:57,560
or something. I don't
Charlie! You're talking crazy!

826
00:34:57,627 --> 00:34:59,296
Cherub Valentine.
That's her name.

827
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:00,976
But she goes by Ruby
because it's got more zing.

828
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,137
Hey, disappear or shoot
an arrow or something.

829
00:35:03,204 --> 00:35:04,507
Show Laura your magic.

830
00:35:04,574 --> 00:35:06,645
My name is Leslie.
Oh, what did I say?

831
00:35:06,712 --> 00:35:09,718
Here you go. big spender.

832
00:35:09,784 --> 00:35:12,890
Thank you. I detect your snark!

833
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:14,093
You know what? I'm leaving.

834
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,630
That's it for me.
I am out of here.

835
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,265
And you're not getting
20 percent,

836
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:19,904
you're getting 15 max.

837
00:35:19,971 --> 00:35:22,242
Leslie, I'm so sorry.
You've been lovely.

838
00:35:22,309 --> 00:35:24,246
This has nothing to do
with you but I have to go.

839
00:35:27,687 --> 00:35:30,225
He's a little highstrung.

840
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:32,530
So, you really think
you're Cupid?

841
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:36,470
Ah do I look like
a Looney Tunes?

842
00:35:36,538 --> 00:35:40,613
I mean, like, here's my
little bow and arrow. Pew!

843
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,082
Of course not.

844
00:35:42,149 --> 00:35:45,021
I'm just really
great at matchmaking.

845
00:35:45,088 --> 00:35:47,259
Here, let me show you.

846
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,566
Ah.

847
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:52,235
I think that guy over there.

848
00:35:54,574 --> 00:35:55,910
I think he might be the one.

849
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:59,183
Maybe I could introduce you.

850
00:35:59,249 --> 00:36:01,187
Oh, my. Yes, please.

851
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:11,007
What was that? We have a deal.

852
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:13,177
Well, the deal is dumb.

853
00:36:14,814 --> 00:36:16,393
Boring chitchat with women
that you picked for me,

854
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:17,896
wearing clothes
that you picked for me,

855
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,291
pretending to be some guy
who's looking for love,

856
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:22,597
which I am not.
But why? Why, Charlie?

857
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:24,466
Why don't you want to find love?

858
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:27,205
You really want to know why?
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

859
00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:31,047
I gave up.

860
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:32,482
Datin' and relationships,

861
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:36,424
it's just been one disaster
after another.

862
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,994
Disappointments, heartbreak.

863
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:40,933
I don't know. I ju
I just got tired of it, okay?

864
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,704
And now I'm just me.

865
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,974
And I have finally
gotten used to that.

866
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,847
And then you come around here
messing with my head.

867
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,920
But I don't want to change.

868
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:52,489
I don't need you to change me.

869
00:37:08,622 --> 00:37:13,064
Wow. That went well.

870
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,233
This is all your fault!

871
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,703
Moi?

872
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,516
Yes. You told me
I should play a numbers game!

873
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,478
That's why I chose
all those random women.

874
00:37:20,546 --> 00:37:22,482
You did this on purpose.

875
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,355
Yeah, obviously.
When you go down in flames,

876
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:26,701
who do you think the boss
is going to turn to?

877
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:28,327
That is so not nice of you.

878
00:37:28,394 --> 00:37:30,465
You are supposed
to be helping me!

879
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:34,774
Oh, but instead, I'm helping me.

880
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:36,043
Whoops.

881
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,849
Well, maybe I'll tell
Mister C about this, hm?

882
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:42,590
Yeah, you should do that, Ruby.
Everybody loves a tattletale.

883
00:37:42,657 --> 00:37:44,293
As a matter of fact,
that's why I'm here.

884
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:46,832
Cupid wants to see you
in his office, so

885
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,267
Cool. Amazing.

886
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:49,680
I've been meaning to
pop up there anyway.

887
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:50,606
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmhm.

888
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:51,875
I totally believe you.

889
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:52,877
It's true.

890
00:37:52,944 --> 00:37:55,014
I know.

891
00:37:57,285 --> 00:37:59,765
I need to see the boss, stat
He's kind of expecting me, so

892
00:38:06,972 --> 00:38:08,107
He'll see you now.

893
00:38:08,174 --> 00:38:09,577
Just me though, right?

894
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:11,515
He said both of you.

895
00:38:14,754 --> 00:38:16,457
No, no, no. Ruby!

896
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,333
Really?

897
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,672
Hello, sir.
I need to talk to you.

898
00:38:24,874 --> 00:38:26,487
- Philomena set me up.
- No. No, no, no.

899
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:27,956
- Don't listen to her.
- She just wants

900
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,560
the promotion for herself!
She doesn't know

901
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:30,662
- what she's doing!
- She said that

902
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:32,022
how I do things is dumb

903
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:33,324
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

904
00:38:35,094 --> 00:38:37,399
I could be on my boat.

905
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:38,778
- You know, I have a boat.
- In Boca.

906
00:38:38,802 --> 00:38:40,171
Yeah.

907
00:38:40,238 --> 00:38:41,908
Is that true, Philomena?

908
00:38:41,975 --> 00:38:43,612
Did you try and sabotage
Ruby's plan?

909
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:49,591
No! Kind of.
I just didn't help her.

910
00:38:49,657 --> 00:38:52,830
And you know what? Why should I?

911
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,401
I'm obviously the much better
candidate for your job.

912
00:38:55,468 --> 00:38:56,505
Rude!

913
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:58,441
No, she may be right.

914
00:38:58,509 --> 00:39:01,180
It seems Philomena might be
more willing to do

915
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:03,484
what needs to be done.

916
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:06,758
She does not care
about love at all.

917
00:39:06,825 --> 00:39:08,729
She doesn't care
if a couple will be happy.

918
00:39:08,795 --> 00:39:11,066
She's just pew, pew, pew
with the arrows.

919
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,603
All over the place.

920
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,048
- Yes, yes, yes, you do.
- I do not pew, pew.

921
00:39:14,072 --> 00:39:15,519
- I do not pew, pew.
- Pew, pew, pew.

922
00:39:15,543 --> 00:39:16,621
All right, all right, all right.

923
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,314
Quiet, quiet, both of you.

924
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:20,519
You've already wasted
half your time.

925
00:39:20,586 --> 00:39:21,855
From where I stand,

926
00:39:21,922 --> 00:39:23,692
the next six days
don't look so promising.

927
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:26,998
I underestimated how
difficult this case is, sir.

928
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,802
I'm going to need
a lot more than magic

929
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:32,209
and I'm using any and all tools
at my disposal, but.

930
00:39:32,275 --> 00:39:33,812
But what?

931
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:35,919
I don't even know if
he's gonna talk to me anymore.

932
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:39,624
He was really upset
about the whole.

933
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:42,429
Speed dating strangers?

934
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:43,732
Here's an idea.

935
00:39:44,901 --> 00:39:46,905
Why don't you
get to know him, huh?

936
00:39:46,972 --> 00:39:49,744
Then you use that intel
to get him a match.

937
00:39:51,113 --> 00:39:52,883
Come on, you guys.

938
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,088
Do I have to do
everything for you?

939
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,772
What's that for?

940
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,876
Don't tell me
you don't like cupcakes.

941
00:40:05,943 --> 00:40:08,447
I'm skeptical of
magical beings bearing gifts.

942
00:40:12,188 --> 00:40:13,457
It's a peace offering.

943
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:18,367
I'm sorry for pushing you
into blind dates

944
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:20,706
and trying to change you.

945
00:40:25,348 --> 00:40:27,285
Thanks for the cupcake.

946
00:40:27,352 --> 00:40:29,089
You're welcome.

947
00:40:29,156 --> 00:40:31,093
So I hate that I have to
keep getting all up

948
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,901
in your business, but
And yet, here we are.

949
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:39,076
I can't not do this.
Making people fall in love,

950
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:40,478
it's what I do.

951
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:41,848
It makes me happy.

952
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,994
And. you may not know it,
but you need my help.

953
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:50,775
I know you've had
bad luck in the past,

954
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:53,004
but you can't just give up.

955
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,509
Bad luck doesn't even
begin to describe it.

956
00:40:55,576 --> 00:40:57,780
Uh, high school.

957
00:40:57,847 --> 00:41:01,120
I got the flu, and I threw up
on my prom date.

958
00:41:01,186 --> 00:41:03,186
In college, one of my
girlfriends stole my identity

959
00:41:03,224 --> 00:41:05,763
and then proceeded
to buy 14 flatscreen TVs

960
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:07,733
on my credit card
before she fled town.

961
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,104
I really liked her, too.

962
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:12,251
Graduate school, my girlfriend
fell in love with my roommate

963
00:41:12,275 --> 00:41:14,781
and then moved in with us.

964
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,951
Yikes.

965
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:19,657
Yeah. So, since then,
for my own sanity,

966
00:41:19,724 --> 00:41:21,060
and really as a public service,

967
00:41:21,126 --> 00:41:23,565
I have decided to
stay away from the whole,

968
00:41:23,632 --> 00:41:26,604
like, love romance thing.

969
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:29,242
That is how I became
the undatable man.

970
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:30,946
You're not undatable.

971
00:41:31,013 --> 00:41:35,823
You're smart, sensitive,
a great teacher.

972
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:39,664
And when you're not mad at me,
you're really nice.

973
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,939
Plus, you're actually
super cute.

974
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,817
Really?

975
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:51,621
- Really? Super cute?
- Yeah.

976
00:41:51,688 --> 00:41:53,290
Oh, no, I, uh Super?

977
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:56,130
Just like a regular, just
a normal amount of of cute.

978
00:41:56,196 --> 00:41:58,535
Mm. It sounds like
you think I'm dreamy.

979
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,806
Maybe this is why you don't
get compliments very often.

980
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:02,877
The point is,
we need to find someone

981
00:42:02,943 --> 00:42:05,649
who sees you the way I do.

982
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:07,920
And how do we do that?

983
00:42:07,987 --> 00:42:10,592
Well, I need to know
who I'm looking for.

984
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:12,495
And in order to figure that out.

985
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:13,832
Oh, boy.

986
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:15,234
.You gotta hang out with me.

987
00:42:16,771 --> 00:42:18,474
We are on a mission, people.

988
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:21,413
We need to find the perfect
person for Professor Conrad.

989
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,618
Leave no stone unturned!

990
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:25,455
Also, I just really
need to know,

991
00:42:25,522 --> 00:42:27,058
what is cuffing season?

992
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:30,031
Cuffing season is that time,
usually October to March,

993
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:32,202
where people go looking
for a boyfriend or

994
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:33,346
girlfriend for the holidays.

995
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,308
And because it's cold outside.

996
00:42:35,374 --> 00:42:36,878
Yeah, that's kind of gross.

997
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:39,249
What? No! I maybe
I'm not explainin' it right.

998
00:42:39,316 --> 00:42:41,386
See, if you're single
for the holidays

999
00:42:41,453 --> 00:42:43,224
You don't have anybody
to invite to a family

1000
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,796
Thanksgiving dinner,
or get Christmas presents from,

1001
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,635
or have a date for New Year's,
Valentine's Day.

1002
00:42:48,702 --> 00:42:50,806
So cuffing season
is actually intentionally

1003
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:52,552
lowering your standards
so as not to be alone

1004
00:42:52,576 --> 00:42:54,112
because that would be
the real tragedy.

1005
00:42:55,749 --> 00:42:58,254
It is kind of gross.

1006
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,657
I don't mean to bother you guys,

1007
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:01,260
but do you have a daughter?

1008
00:43:01,326 --> 00:43:03,173
Uh, excuse me. I have
a very important and pressing

1009
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:04,466
question for you.

1010
00:43:04,534 --> 00:43:05,736
Are you single?

1011
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:07,071
And emotionally available?

1012
00:43:07,138 --> 00:43:10,546
♪♪ There's Christmas in the air ♪♪

1013
00:43:10,612 --> 00:43:13,518

00:43:33,124 --> 00:43:34,694
What are you doing
for Christmas?

1021
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,029
Same thing I always do.

1022
00:43:36,096 --> 00:43:38,300
Rent the same lake cabin
every year.

1023
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,772
What? By yourself?

1024
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:43,812
Yeah, why not?
I got my music, I got my books.

1025
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:47,720
You know, Superman has his
Fortress of Solitude.

1026
00:43:47,786 --> 00:43:50,792
It's more like
a Shack of Sadness.

1027
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:54,132
Wow. What does, uh.
What does a yellow arrow do?

1028
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:56,604
Yellow will make you
notice someone.

1029
00:43:56,671 --> 00:44:00,646
Purple will make you feel all
lovey and happy and dopey.

1030
00:44:00,712 --> 00:44:02,348
That's the one
you used on my boss.

1031
00:44:02,415 --> 00:44:06,624
Then there's red.
Red is for emergencies only.

1032
00:44:06,691 --> 00:44:09,229
It makes people do crazy things.

1033
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:11,433
Whoo! Charlie, look!

1034
00:44:13,103 --> 00:44:15,341
Yeah! It's a sign from Cupid.
We're on the right track!

1035
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:18,815
It's a sign
from the Tourism Bureau.

1036
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:21,521
Hey. Hm?

1037
00:44:21,588 --> 00:44:23,324
You're really good at your job.

1038
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,863
I think you're probably
really good at what you do too.

1039
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:29,269
Thank you. I, uh,
I appreciate hearing that.

1040
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,340
I've just been having
some trouble at work,

1041
00:44:31,406 --> 00:44:32,910
and I think my boss
hates me, and

1042
00:44:32,977 --> 00:44:34,614
Hm. I just need

1043
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,385
I, um. Yeah. Uh.

1044
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:43,598
Just to reiterate,
this is magic.

1045
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:46,804
You're not allowed to use
an arrow on me or anybody else.

1046
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:48,383
You know, you're really
making this more difficult

1047
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:50,746
than it needs to be,
but I promised.

1048
00:44:50,812 --> 00:44:52,516
No magic.

1049
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:53,985
So what about you?

1050
00:44:54,052 --> 00:44:56,023
Four days until Christmas.

1051
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:57,826
You got a special someone?

1052
00:44:57,893 --> 00:44:59,062
I'm immortal.

1053
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:01,166
Hm. Too long a commitment?

1054
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:02,233
Funny guy.

1055
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:04,740
I would imagine the dating pool

1056
00:45:04,807 --> 00:45:06,811
of dudes who live forever
is pretty shallow.

1057
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:08,815
It just doesn't work like that.

1058
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:10,351
I get to make people
fall in love,

1059
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:12,590
but I just don't get to.

1060
00:45:12,656 --> 00:45:13,758
What?

1061
00:45:14,727 --> 00:45:15,929
Really?

1062
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,300
Cupid's assistant

1063
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:19,570
Apprentice.

1064
00:45:19,637 --> 00:45:21,073
Miss "I love love."

1065
00:45:21,139 --> 00:45:23,612
Miss "There's a perfect person
for everybody."

1066
00:45:23,678 --> 00:45:25,014
You've never had a boyfriend?

1067
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,155
Never been on a date.
Never been kissed.

1068
00:45:29,222 --> 00:45:31,026
But I bet it's really nice.

1069
00:45:31,093 --> 00:45:33,364
I guess
I finally found the one thing

1070
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,700
we have in common.

1071
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:36,103
You've never been kissed,
either?

1072
00:45:36,169 --> 00:45:37,673
What? No.

1073
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,244
Yes, yes. Yes. I've been kissed.

1074
00:45:40,311 --> 00:45:42,950
It's okay if you haven't.
No, III have been kissed.

1075
00:45:43,017 --> 00:45:45,154
I've I have done
the kissing, all right?

1076
00:45:45,221 --> 00:45:46,524
And also received the kissing.

1077
00:45:46,591 --> 00:45:47,927
Whatever!
That's not what I meant.

1078
00:45:47,993 --> 00:45:49,563
I meant, it just seems
like we've both

1079
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,468
put our professional lives
ahead of our personal lives.

1080
00:45:52,536 --> 00:45:55,474
That's
the thing we have in common.

1081
00:45:56,978 --> 00:45:58,748
Sounds like I hit a nerve.

1082
00:45:58,815 --> 00:46:00,117
You didn't hit.

1083
00:46:03,892 --> 00:46:04,927
Hey, Gina. I

1084
00:46:04,994 --> 00:46:06,597
Oh. Hey, Todd.

1085
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:08,000
Stop it!

1086
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:10,772
I, uh. was wondering
if you wanted to

1087
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:12,643
Wait! Stop.

1088
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:15,882
Oh, my god.

1089
00:46:15,949 --> 00:46:17,653
Who is that?

1090
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,489
I know her.

1091
00:46:19,557 --> 00:46:21,594
She taught me Intro to Theatre.

1092
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:23,665
She's totally his type.

1093
00:46:23,732 --> 00:46:25,434
And she's reading a book.

1094
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:26,938
Lots of people read books.

1095
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:28,675
I wish Ruby was here.

1096
00:46:28,742 --> 00:46:31,346
What's up?

1097
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,417
Don't do that.

1098
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:40,097
Meet Amber McCormick,
professor of theatre.

1099
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:43,905
She likes to read, especially
the works of Jane Austen.

1100
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:44,874
Good taste.

1101
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,143
She's a romantic.

1102
00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:47,913
- Pretty.
- Pretty.

1103
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,852
She's hot. Hot!

1104
00:46:50,919 --> 00:46:51,854
She's not uptight.

1105
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:53,490
She's like, laid back.

1106
00:46:53,558 --> 00:46:55,061
She's not like, professor.

1107
00:46:55,127 --> 00:46:56,631
She's like Right.

1108
00:46:56,698 --> 00:46:58,400
Call me Amber. Like casual.

1109
00:46:58,467 --> 00:46:59,467
Oh, like boho.

1110
00:46:59,502 --> 00:47:01,507
Yes! Yes! Oh, yeah, yeah.

1111
00:47:01,574 --> 00:47:03,043
So, what do you think?

1112
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:05,916
What do you mean,
what do I think?

1113
00:47:05,982 --> 00:47:07,227
What, I'm supposed to
just look at this

1114
00:47:07,251 --> 00:47:08,691
and tell you
if I would date someone?

1115
00:47:08,722 --> 00:47:09,990
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1116
00:47:10,057 --> 00:47:11,928
No. No, no, no, no.

1117
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:15,234
You need to talk to her.
See if there's a spark.

1118
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:18,407
Then you just need to
follow your heart.

1119
00:47:18,474 --> 00:47:20,411
Follow my heart, huh? Mmhm.

1120
00:47:20,478 --> 00:47:22,950
That's the key
to all of this, Charlie.

1121
00:47:23,017 --> 00:47:25,154
Ooh! Brainstorm!

1122
00:47:25,221 --> 00:47:28,127
I know what we need.
We need a meetcute.

1123
00:47:28,193 --> 00:47:29,864
Yes, yes. What's a meetcute?

1124
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:33,905
All right, so what are we doing?

1125
00:47:33,972 --> 00:47:36,343
Okay. A meetcute
is that part of the movie

1126
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:38,123
where the girl and the boy
meet for the first time,

1127
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:39,750
and it's usually
silly or awkward,

1128
00:47:39,817 --> 00:47:42,355
but it's just so darn cute.

1129
00:47:42,422 --> 00:47:43,992
That sounds
pretty contrived to me.

1130
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:45,862
Why do you ruin
the things I love?

1131
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:49,670
Okay.

1132
00:47:49,737 --> 00:47:54,112
You said no magic, no arrows,

1133
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:56,751
and I'm sticking to my promise
despite how difficult

1134
00:47:56,818 --> 00:47:58,521
that makes everything

1135
00:47:58,588 --> 00:48:00,458
Well, good,
because that was our deal.

1136
00:48:00,525 --> 00:48:04,132
But that means that you need to
stop complaining for one second

1137
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:06,470
and just get on board with this.

1138
00:48:06,537 --> 00:48:09,610
The goal, after all,
is to make you happy.

1139
00:48:09,677 --> 00:48:10,946
Well, it's not working so far.

1140
00:48:11,012 --> 00:48:15,287
Okay, well, just wait.
Just stay close.

1141
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:17,024
Wait for my cue.

1142
00:48:18,494 --> 00:48:20,030
Perfect.

1143
00:48:29,149 --> 00:48:31,854
Watch it happen.

1144
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:40,271
Oh. Oh, no. Go, help her. Go.

1145
00:48:42,843 --> 00:48:43,945
Can I help you?

1146
00:48:46,951 --> 00:48:48,187
Oh.

1147
00:48:49,924 --> 00:48:51,661
Oh, my nose! My head.

1148
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:55,501
Ow! Oh god. Are you okay?

1149
00:48:55,569 --> 00:48:58,508
I'm so sorry.

1150
00:48:58,575 --> 00:49:00,411
You're bleeding.

1151
00:49:00,478 --> 00:49:04,553
Ohh. Uh, I'm fine.

1152
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,655
Are you sure?

1153
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:09,630
You did it, Charlie.
You got a date.

1154
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,375
Yeah. She probably only agreed
to go out with me

1155
00:49:11,399 --> 00:49:12,970
because she felt bad
for maiming me.

1156
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:17,478
No. She liked you.
And it was, uh, charming.

1157
00:49:17,546 --> 00:49:18,648
Oh, sure it was.

1158
00:49:18,715 --> 00:49:20,217
I mean it.

1159
00:49:20,284 --> 00:49:23,423
You showed vulnerability.
We like that.

1160
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:24,593
Hmm.

1161
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:30,437
Ah! Hey, hey.
No, no. Not that, no.

1162
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:38,320
What do you think?

1163
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:43,698
Super cute?

1164
00:49:43,765 --> 00:49:45,467
Yeah, actually.

1165
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:48,071
Oh, come here.

1166
00:49:48,106 --> 00:49:50,077
Let me, um, fix this.

1167
00:49:54,085 --> 00:49:55,387
I'm kinda nervous.

1168
00:49:55,454 --> 00:49:57,258
Why?

1169
00:49:57,325 --> 00:49:59,028
Well, I haven't
done this in a while.

1170
00:49:59,095 --> 00:50:00,799
You know, the whole
"date" thing.

1171
00:50:00,866 --> 00:50:02,411
With my track record,
there's a really good chance

1172
00:50:02,435 --> 00:50:03,714
that before the end
of the night,

1173
00:50:03,738 --> 00:50:05,174
I'll end up
in the emergency room.

1174
00:50:05,241 --> 00:50:09,182
Wrong attitude, Charlie.
Just be yourself.

1175
00:50:09,249 --> 00:50:12,623
Right. What'd you call me?
Romantically hopeless?

1176
00:50:12,689 --> 00:50:14,392
Even Cupid doesn't think
I can do this.

1177
00:50:14,459 --> 00:50:16,731
You're not hopeless.
I think you're really great.

1178
00:50:19,068 --> 00:50:20,170
I think you're.

1179
00:50:22,108 --> 00:50:23,343
Really great too.

1180
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:29,222
What do I know? I'm just a.

1181
00:50:29,289 --> 00:50:32,261
Figment of some
marketing guy's imagination.

1182
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,301
Right.

1183
00:50:37,104 --> 00:50:38,224
Good luck on your hot date.

1184
00:50:52,235 --> 00:50:55,441
So, you got him a date.

1185
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:57,512
Amazing.

1186
00:50:57,579 --> 00:50:58,615
It's a start.

1187
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,417
What happened to
love at first sight?

1188
00:51:00,484 --> 00:51:04,425
It's not that
but love can grow, too.

1189
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,367
What's wrong with you?

1190
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:10,572
You should be all annoyingly
peppy and gloating.

1191
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:11,707
Your guy has a date.

1192
00:51:11,774 --> 00:51:13,176
Yeah. It's great.

1193
00:51:13,243 --> 00:51:15,615
And they're probably
perfect for each other.

1194
00:51:16,918 --> 00:51:18,688
Probably? What's with the probab

1195
00:51:23,564 --> 00:51:24,600
No way!

1196
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:26,837
Are you kidding me?
You like him?

1197
00:51:26,904 --> 00:51:29,208
Shh! What? No! Oh, yes you do!

1198
00:51:29,275 --> 00:51:31,212
You're pathetically transparent.

1199
00:51:31,279 --> 00:51:33,116
Gross. I don't like him!

1200
00:51:33,183 --> 00:51:36,624
I just. I think he's nice.

1201
00:51:36,691 --> 00:51:38,026
Ruby!

1202
00:51:38,093 --> 00:51:40,565
You're an immortal.

1203
00:51:40,632 --> 00:51:42,368
He's just some dude
with no fashion sense.

1204
00:51:42,435 --> 00:51:45,942
You have magical powers.

1205
00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:48,982
He. falls down a lot.

1206
00:51:49,048 --> 00:51:50,484
I know!

1207
00:51:50,552 --> 00:51:53,625
It's just. you'll probably
only make fun of me.

1208
00:51:53,691 --> 00:51:54,994
Yeah, probably.

1209
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,305
It's just that I've made it
happen so many times.

1210
00:51:56,329 --> 00:51:58,801
I've seen how they react.

1211
00:51:58,868 --> 00:52:01,439
I just kind of wish
I could have that feeling of.

1212
00:52:01,507 --> 00:52:03,778
Falling in love, too.

1213
00:52:03,845 --> 00:52:05,749
You know what you should do?

1214
00:52:05,815 --> 00:52:06,815
Hmm?

1215
00:52:07,753 --> 00:52:09,288
You should tell him
how you feel.

1216
00:52:09,355 --> 00:52:10,457
You think?

1217
00:52:11,459 --> 00:52:13,330
Oh, absolutely. Yes!

1218
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:16,336
Just get it all on the table.
Talk about your feelings.

1219
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:17,643
Tell him how much you like him.

1220
00:52:17,706 --> 00:52:19,008
It's healthy.
You'll feel better.

1221
00:52:19,075 --> 00:52:20,545
Okay, you!

1222
00:52:20,612 --> 00:52:22,716
You're just trying
to sabotage me.

1223
00:52:22,783 --> 00:52:24,118
Don't worry, Philomena,

1224
00:52:24,185 --> 00:52:25,196
I'm not going to do anything
to mess this up.

1225
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,124
I'm getting the Cupid job!

1226
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:28,828
We'll see.

1227
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:31,132
I have a feeling you'll
figure out a way to blow it.

1228
00:52:34,172 --> 00:52:35,183
What's your favorite thing about

1229
00:52:35,207 --> 00:52:36,811
Ugh! Oh!

1230
00:52:39,148 --> 00:52:40,351
He's so dumb.

1231
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:41,587
No.

1232
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:44,860
I'm so sorry.

1233
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,164
Thank you.

1234
00:52:48,133 --> 00:52:49,369
Well, she hates me.

1235
00:52:49,435 --> 00:52:50,905
People spill coffee
all the time.

1236
00:52:50,972 --> 00:52:53,043
Hmm? Do they, though?

1237
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,546
Okay.

1238
00:52:54,613 --> 00:52:56,851
Maybe not all the time,
but it's happened before.

1239
00:52:58,521 --> 00:53:02,562
I, uh I guess we both
survived, didn't we?

1240
00:53:02,629 --> 00:53:06,136
It's funny how we met.
Don't you think?

1241
00:53:06,202 --> 00:53:09,242
Almost like out of a movie.

1242
00:53:09,308 --> 00:53:11,112
Yeah. It's called a meetcute.

1243
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:12,649
I know it's called a meetcute.

1244
00:53:12,716 --> 00:53:14,920
II can't believe you know
it's called a meetcute!

1245
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,089
Yeah.

1246
00:53:16,156 --> 00:53:17,091
It's almost like
someone up there

1247
00:53:17,158 --> 00:53:18,661
is shoving us together.

1248
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:21,567
Ah. Hmm. Mmhm.

1249
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:24,472
Yeah, it's almost like that.

1250
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:28,280
I had a nice time, Charlie.
I'd like to see you again.

1251
00:53:28,346 --> 00:53:31,119
Oh. Seriously?

1252
00:53:31,186 --> 00:53:34,292
II mean, if you don't want to

1253
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:38,601
No, I, yeah
I mean, yyes. I would.

1254
00:53:38,668 --> 00:53:40,337
Sorry. Yes, I totally would.

1255
00:53:40,404 --> 00:53:43,243
I just uh, I thought
I was pretty boring.

1256
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:44,713
Okay.

1257
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:47,284
Yes, you you were
a little boring.

1258
00:53:48,788 --> 00:53:50,859
I mean, you talked about
history for a long time.

1259
00:53:50,925 --> 00:53:52,428
Uh. yeah, sorry.

1260
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,700
I guess, you know, it's just,
uh, it's what I'm

1261
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:56,670
I think it's just that
we're both nervous.

1262
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,510
We'll do better next time.

1263
00:54:02,214 --> 00:54:04,252
Okay.

1264
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:05,688
Yeah. Deal.

1265
00:54:10,464 --> 00:54:11,499
So how'd it go?

1266
00:54:13,303 --> 00:54:14,740
Argh!

1267
00:54:14,807 --> 00:54:17,378
Could you please stop
breaking into my house?

1268
00:54:17,445 --> 00:54:18,447
I don't break anything.

1269
00:54:18,514 --> 00:54:20,919
No! You don't, I do.

1270
00:54:20,985 --> 00:54:24,058
You poof or pop or bibbity boo,
or whatever it is that you do,

1271
00:54:24,125 --> 00:54:26,262
into my private residence,
and I get startled,

1272
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,498
and I break things.

1273
00:54:27,566 --> 00:54:29,268
I don't bibbity bobbity boo.

1274
00:54:30,304 --> 00:54:31,807
I'm a teacher.

1275
00:54:31,874 --> 00:54:33,978
I can't afford to
buy new things.

1276
00:54:34,045 --> 00:54:35,815
Sorry.

1277
00:54:35,882 --> 00:54:37,084
So how'd it go?

1278
00:54:37,151 --> 00:54:40,190
Just fine. It was good.

1279
00:54:40,257 --> 00:54:41,594
Well, which is it?

1280
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,998
Because fine is very different
than good.

1281
00:54:44,065 --> 00:54:46,971
It was fine, and, uh
then it got better.

1282
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:49,308
So, you. like her?

1283
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:51,446
She's nice.

1284
00:54:51,514 --> 00:54:53,618
Because the clock is ticking.

1285
00:54:53,684 --> 00:54:55,330
Yeah, yeah. I know.
You're in a hurry to move on.

1286
00:54:55,354 --> 00:54:56,790
We have a date
tomorrow night, so.

1287
00:54:58,794 --> 00:54:59,794
We'll see.

1288
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:02,468
Goof on outta here.

1289
00:55:06,911 --> 00:55:08,751
All right. You're gonna
have an hour with this,

1290
00:55:08,815 --> 00:55:12,488
which should be plenty of time,
if you studied.

1291
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:16,229
You're not gonna tell us
how it went?

1292
00:55:16,296 --> 00:55:18,433
Oh, we absolutely need details.

1293
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,870
Was it a love connection?

1294
00:55:19,937 --> 00:55:21,177
Are you going to see her again?

1295
00:55:21,206 --> 00:55:23,611
Did you spill anything?

1296
00:55:23,678 --> 00:55:27,886
Ha, ha, ha.
It was, uh, it was good.

1297
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:29,823
Dunno yet.
We have a date tomorrow night.

1298
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:32,729
And yes, I did spill
something, coffee.

1299
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,800
But, good news is, not on her.

1300
00:55:35,902 --> 00:55:37,806
All right. Anyway, good luck.

1301
00:55:37,873 --> 00:55:39,710
Soon as you're done,
you can leave.

1302
00:55:39,776 --> 00:55:41,756
And uh, safe travels and have
a great Christmas, you guys.

1303
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,383
You can't possibly believe

1304
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:45,655
that we're gonna leave
before Christmas Eve.

1305
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:49,061
Like we would come this far
and then not see how it ends up?

1306
00:55:49,128 --> 00:55:50,128
What do you mean?

1307
00:55:50,163 --> 00:55:51,499
The bet?

1308
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:55,040
You have to fall in love
by Christmas Eve or.

1309
00:55:55,107 --> 00:55:56,577
Well, something happens.

1310
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,581
Yeah, I'm not really clear
on the consequences.

1311
00:55:58,648 --> 00:56:01,720
We wanna see if you make it.

1312
00:56:01,787 --> 00:56:03,827
Don't you guys wanna go home
and see your families?

1313
00:56:03,891 --> 00:56:06,429
After all the work
that I've put into this project,

1314
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,801
do you think
I'm just gonna walk away?

1315
00:56:08,868 --> 00:56:11,139
Professor Conrad,
we're invested in this.

1316
00:56:11,206 --> 00:56:12,842
I'm not convinced
it's going to happen,

1317
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:15,480
but I'm definitely
sticking around to see.

1318
00:56:15,548 --> 00:56:16,550
Plus, the Christmas Eve

1319
00:56:16,617 --> 00:56:19,055
gala is super fun!

1320
00:56:19,121 --> 00:56:22,361
Great. Just great.

1321
00:56:25,902 --> 00:56:27,505
Hey!

1322
00:56:27,572 --> 00:56:30,377
You with me?

1323
00:56:30,444 --> 00:56:31,714
Yes, of course.

1324
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,083
So, Philomena says you have this

1325
00:56:33,149 --> 00:56:34,418
whole thing wrapped up, huh?

1326
00:56:34,485 --> 00:56:36,590
Yeah. It's looking good.

1327
00:56:36,657 --> 00:56:38,561
Care to expound? Is he in love?

1328
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:41,065
No! Not yet.

1329
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:43,403
You know, we don't want to
rush into anything.

1330
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,440
Rush into anything?

1331
00:56:45,508 --> 00:56:47,812
You got three days.

1332
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:49,315
Three days until Christmas.

1333
00:56:49,382 --> 00:56:50,919
I'm gonna have
my Christmas, Ruby.

1334
00:56:50,985 --> 00:56:54,325
I'm just not entirely,
totally certain

1335
00:56:54,392 --> 00:56:57,398
that she's the one.

1336
00:56:57,464 --> 00:56:58,400
You're not?

1337
00:56:58,466 --> 00:57:00,370
Yeah.

1338
00:57:00,437 --> 00:57:01,807
You're not by any chance

1339
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:03,352
having any feelings
for this guy, are you?

1340
00:57:03,376 --> 00:57:05,280
What? No. No, that's crazy.

1341
00:57:05,347 --> 00:57:06,493
Because you know that
you're not allowed to

1342
00:57:06,517 --> 00:57:09,656
I know. It can't happen.

1343
00:57:11,827 --> 00:57:13,430
I just want him to be happy.

1344
00:57:15,067 --> 00:57:16,067
That's all.

1345
00:57:24,151 --> 00:57:25,989
Professor Conrad.

1346
00:57:26,055 --> 00:57:28,093
You, uh, heading out
for the break?

1347
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:30,598
Oh, yes, I'm trying to
head out right now.

1348
00:57:30,665 --> 00:57:32,067
Tomorrow is the Christmas gala,

1349
00:57:32,134 --> 00:57:35,541
and then two beautiful weeks
studentfree.

1350
00:57:35,608 --> 00:57:37,378
Just me, my kids, and my boo.

1351
00:57:37,444 --> 00:57:38,614
Uh, it sounds nice.

1352
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:40,050
Hmm. You have any plans?

1353
00:57:40,117 --> 00:57:43,089
III really don't have
"a boo", or a family,

1354
00:57:43,156 --> 00:57:45,093
uh, so I usually just spend
Christmas Day

1355
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,899
volunteering at a soup kitchen.
And then, I think this year

1356
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:49,277
I think I'm gonna
go up to the lake

1357
00:57:49,301 --> 00:57:50,638
and spend some alone time.

1358
00:57:50,705 --> 00:57:52,207
Okay, that sounds depressing.

1359
00:57:52,274 --> 00:57:54,713
Something you need?

1360
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,552
Oh, I look,
I don't wanna keep you.

1361
00:57:57,619 --> 00:57:59,322
You know what? Too late.

1362
00:57:59,388 --> 00:58:00,925
What do you want?

1363
00:58:00,992 --> 00:58:02,662
Right. Um.

1364
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,432
Do you remember Ruby?

1365
00:58:04,498 --> 00:58:07,237
The girl that you said could be
in my classroom all the time?

1366
00:58:07,304 --> 00:58:09,976
Oh. The visiting professor,
or something.

1367
00:58:10,043 --> 00:58:11,914
What about her?
Yeah. Well, the thing is,

1368
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,253
uh, we're from two completely
different worlds.

1369
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,690
And we have nothing in common.

1370
00:58:16,757 --> 00:58:18,594
And she's always pushing me
to be different

1371
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,665
You like her.

1372
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:24,539
I don't know.

1373
00:58:26,242 --> 00:58:27,846
There's this other girl.

1374
00:58:27,912 --> 00:58:33,524
Um, she's smart and pretty,
and we have a lot in common.

1375
00:58:33,591 --> 00:58:35,293
Professor Conrad,
let me tell you

1376
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,231
a little something about love.

1377
00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:40,671
See, love will have you
thinkin' about 'em all the time.

1378
00:58:40,738 --> 00:58:42,317
Love will have you gettin'
that knot in your stomach

1379
00:58:42,341 --> 00:58:43,944
whenever you're around 'em.

1380
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:45,681
Love will have you
goin' to bed at night

1381
00:58:45,748 --> 00:58:47,260
thinking about 'em,
and waking up in the morning

1382
00:58:47,284 --> 00:58:49,455
and hoping you see 'em.
See, sometimes with love,

1383
00:58:49,523 --> 00:58:51,593
you just gotta go with it.

1384
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,633
Life is too short
to settle for anyone

1385
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:57,806
or anything that doesn't
make you feel like that.

1386
00:58:58,941 --> 00:59:00,745
But.

1387
00:59:00,812 --> 00:59:02,147
Ruby and I don't make sense.

1388
00:59:02,214 --> 00:59:05,120
Ah! Love don't make sense.

1389
00:59:05,187 --> 00:59:07,391
You just gotta
follow your heart.

1390
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:08,561
Follow my heart.

1391
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,676
You're the second person
to tell me that this week.

1392
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,503
Well, it's good advice.

1393
00:59:13,571 --> 00:59:15,775
Now, if it's all right with you,

1394
00:59:15,842 --> 00:59:18,279
and now that I've solved
all your love problems

1395
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,716
I wanna go home!

1396
00:59:19,783 --> 00:59:21,553
- Yes! Sure. Sorry.
- Okay.

1397
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,832
I'll see you tomorrow
at the gala.

1398
00:59:22,856 --> 00:59:23,724
I'll see you tomorrow night.

1399
00:59:23,791 --> 00:59:26,095
Okay. Byebye.

1400
00:59:30,538 --> 00:59:33,611
Wow. Looks good.

1401
00:59:33,677 --> 00:59:36,617
Yeah, well, the show
is tomorrow night so

1402
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:39,856
Cool. You know,

1403
00:59:39,923 --> 00:59:41,368
directing the
university Christmas Eve gala

1404
00:59:41,392 --> 00:59:44,198
is my favorite part of the year.

1405
00:59:44,265 --> 00:59:46,035
Yeah. It's exciting.

1406
00:59:46,102 --> 00:59:51,847
Would you maybe.
Wanna be my date?

1407
00:59:51,914 --> 00:59:53,116
I know it's Christmas Eve,

1408
00:59:53,183 --> 00:59:54,719
and you probably
have family to see.

1409
00:59:54,786 --> 00:59:56,857
Oh, no. Um, nope.

1410
00:59:56,924 --> 01:00:02,267
Uh, I mean. just me.

1411
01:00:02,334 --> 01:00:04,706
So, yeah.

1412
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:08,179
Yeah. Yeah, I would love
to come tomorrow night.

1413
01:00:08,246 --> 01:00:10,183
Okay. Great.

1414
01:00:17,999 --> 01:00:21,673
I'm I'm so sorry.

1415
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,111
But III just remembered
that II've got,

1416
01:00:24,178 --> 01:00:27,084
um, I've got this thing
that I gotta go.

1417
01:00:27,151 --> 01:00:28,186
Okay.

1418
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:29,297
There's something I have to do.

1419
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:31,359
Uh, okay.

1420
01:00:31,425 --> 01:00:33,664
Uh sorry, but, but,
um, tomorrow night.

1421
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:35,433
Big show, I'm there.

1422
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,737
Or here.

1423
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:38,206
Is it. Is it something I said?

1424
01:00:38,273 --> 01:00:39,676
No, no, no!

1425
01:00:39,743 --> 01:00:41,188
Nothing you said or did
or anything at all.

1426
01:00:41,212 --> 01:00:42,457
You're amazing. I just.
II gotta go do a thing.

1427
01:00:42,481 --> 01:00:44,151
But I'll see you tomorrow night.

1428
01:00:45,988 --> 01:00:47,759
Ruby!

1429
01:00:47,826 --> 01:00:50,263
Ruby! Hey!

1430
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:52,635
- Ruby! We need to talk.
-

1431
01:00:52,702 --> 01:00:54,071
What was that?

1432
01:00:54,138 --> 01:00:55,784
Did you just run away from her?
No, no. I just

1433
01:00:55,808 --> 01:00:57,120
That was not very gentlemanly.
I know. I'm sorry.

1434
01:00:57,144 --> 01:00:59,181
I thought you liked her!
I like you!

1435
01:01:01,485 --> 01:01:02,485
You do?

1436
01:01:04,726 --> 01:01:05,828
Afraid so.

1437
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:09,268
But you're not
supposed to like me!

1438
01:01:09,335 --> 01:01:11,005
This was not a part

1439
01:01:11,072 --> 01:01:12,317
of the plan, Charlie.
No, I know. I know.

1440
01:01:12,341 --> 01:01:13,944
II didn't mean to do it.

1441
01:01:14,011 --> 01:01:15,022
But but when
I'm at dinner with her,

1442
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,148
I'm thinking about you.

1443
01:01:18,286 --> 01:01:20,257
Coffee, you. II
go to kiss her goodnight

1444
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:22,027
and all I can think about
is kissing you.

1445
01:01:29,509 --> 01:01:31,412
This is bad.

1446
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,884
Uh. that's not the response
I was hoping for.

1447
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:37,257
Um. This can't happen.

1448
01:01:37,324 --> 01:01:39,563
If if I've done anything
to make you think that I

1449
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,232
No. Uh, no.

1450
01:01:41,299 --> 01:01:46,175
I mean, I. I mean, I thought
I thought you liked me.

1451
01:01:46,242 --> 01:01:48,914
I think that you andand Amber

1452
01:01:48,981 --> 01:01:51,687
make aa really great couple.

1453
01:01:54,425 --> 01:01:55,995
Um.

1454
01:01:56,062 --> 01:01:57,062
Yeah.

1455
01:02:01,707 --> 01:02:03,009
Yeah. Um.

1456
01:02:04,746 --> 01:02:06,148
I'm a little embarrassed.

1457
01:02:07,852 --> 01:02:10,791
So, um. if you don't mind.

1458
01:02:11,793 --> 01:02:12,895
Yeah.

1459
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:30,395
Hey, Amber.

1460
01:02:34,271 --> 01:02:35,271
You came.

1461
01:02:38,012 --> 01:02:40,584
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

1462
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:42,054
The way you left last night.

1463
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,258
Yeah, yeah.
I'ml'm sorry about that.

1464
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:46,395
Uh, just, uh,
there was something

1465
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:48,567
I needed to take care of.

1466
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:50,003
But it's done now.

1467
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:52,074
And, uh, I'm really happy
to be here with you.

1468
01:02:53,276 --> 01:02:54,879
Good.

1469
01:02:54,946 --> 01:02:57,084
Well, I got you a seat.

1470
01:02:58,286 --> 01:03:02,528
Or. you could watch it with me
backstage?

1471
01:03:02,595 --> 01:03:06,002
Oh! All right. All right.
Sounds like nice access.

1472
01:03:06,068 --> 01:03:07,639
I'm a big deal around here.

1473
01:03:07,705 --> 01:03:09,542
Apparently so. Come on.

1474
01:03:13,717 --> 01:03:15,521
Hey, Gina.

1475
01:03:15,588 --> 01:03:17,391
Hey, Todd.

1476
01:03:17,457 --> 01:03:18,927
Mind if I sit with you?

1477
01:03:18,994 --> 01:03:20,898
Look, Todd,

1478
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:22,334
you're nice.

1479
01:03:22,401 --> 01:03:26,576
But you're a gym guy
and I'm an intellectual.

1480
01:03:26,643 --> 01:03:29,883
And I'm just not into
the whole dating thing.

1481
01:03:29,949 --> 01:03:32,588
If you can deal with that.

1482
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:33,857
Then you can sit with me.

1483
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:36,062
Okay.

1484
01:03:47,552 --> 01:03:48,854
God, you're depressing.

1485
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:51,192
What? No, I'm not.

1486
01:03:51,258 --> 01:03:52,562
Why?

1487
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:56,435
You've got it bad for
Professor Nerd Alert down there.

1488
01:03:56,502 --> 01:04:00,110
It's gonna happen. I can tell.

1489
01:04:00,176 --> 01:04:01,847
And he's been resisting
his feelings,

1490
01:04:01,913 --> 01:04:05,420
but he is falling for her.

1491
01:04:05,487 --> 01:04:08,192
So if it's not right,
then break them up.

1492
01:04:08,259 --> 01:04:09,337
Just because
you can't be with him

1493
01:04:09,361 --> 01:04:11,933
doesn't mean that she should.

1494
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,071
Right.
So you can get the promotion?

1495
01:04:14,138 --> 01:04:16,342
Do I want this job? Yes.

1496
01:04:16,409 --> 01:04:18,514
Will I do almost anything
to get it?

1497
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,918
Also, absolutely yes, but.

1498
01:04:23,189 --> 01:04:25,628
Something that you don't know
about me.

1499
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:31,940
I fell in love
with a mortal once too.

1500
01:04:32,007 --> 01:04:33,109
Sure you did.

1501
01:04:33,176 --> 01:04:34,679
Okay. Believe me or don't.

1502
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:39,054
But he was strong and handsome
and a little crazy,

1503
01:04:39,121 --> 01:04:41,392
which I'm really into.

1504
01:04:41,459 --> 01:04:42,929
But I knew
that it couldn't work.

1505
01:04:42,995 --> 01:04:45,133
So, even though
it wasn't right for him,

1506
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,435
I used a red arrow.

1507
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,243
And who did he
end up falling for?

1508
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:54,753
Freakin' Cleopatra! That snake.

1509
01:04:54,819 --> 01:04:55,819
Cleopatra?

1510
01:04:55,855 --> 01:04:57,023
Yeah.

1511
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:58,102
Are you talking
about Mark Antony?

1512
01:04:58,126 --> 01:04:59,662
Oh, God no! Eww!

1513
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,802
I would never fall for
that emo pretty boy.

1514
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:05,373
Julius Caesar!

1515
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,114
He was a stonecold silver fox.

1516
01:05:10,518 --> 01:05:12,354
Whoa!

1517
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:15,293
My point is if I liked a guy

1518
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,600
who I knew was about to end up
with the wrong woman,

1519
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:20,638
I would do what I could
to stop it.

1520
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:29,622
Students, faculty,
friends, and family.

1521
01:05:29,689 --> 01:05:34,264
Welcome to our annual
Christmas Eve gala.

1522
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:36,670
Our students have
quite a performance for us.

1523
01:05:36,736 --> 01:05:38,406
And I'm sure you're
going to see something

1524
01:05:38,473 --> 01:05:39,542
very special.

1525
01:05:39,609 --> 01:05:41,680
And, without further ado,

1526
01:05:41,746 --> 01:05:42,986
let's get the show on the road.

1527
01:05:46,957 --> 01:05:48,727
And three, two, one, cue.

1528

Me too.

1532
01:06:08,901 --> 01:06:10,003
No.

1533
01:06:22,662 --> 01:06:23,897
You. Whoa.

1534
01:06:23,964 --> 01:06:25,935

Uh, um, thhanks. Uh, this.

01:06:28,439 --> 01:06:31,078
This is Fred, the stagehand.

1537
01:06:31,145 --> 01:06:33,316
Stage manager. Stage manager.
Oh. Hi, Fred.

1538
01:06:33,382 --> 01:06:34,460
Did you look this way
in rehearsals?

1539
01:06:34,484 --> 01:06:35,955
Something's changed, right?

1540
01:06:36,021 --> 01:06:38,159
Haircut, or I don't know,
but it's working.

1541
01:06:38,226 --> 01:06:39,929
Hi, I'm Charlie.

1542
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,265
Uh. Hi, Charlie.

1543
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:42,578
I'm kinda having a thing
right here.

1544
01:06:42,602 --> 01:06:44,171
Mm. Well, we were too, until

1545
01:06:44,238 --> 01:06:46,041
Oh. Excuse me.

1546
01:06:46,108 --> 01:06:48,547
What are you, uh, the boyfriend?

1547
01:06:48,614 --> 01:06:50,684
Well, um.

1548
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,887
No.

1549
01:06:51,953 --> 01:06:53,322
Well, I mean, we're dating.

1550
01:06:55,728 --> 01:06:57,063
Yeah.

1551
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:58,567
What's. I mean,

1552
01:06:58,634 --> 01:07:00,474
I don't really think
it's any of your business.

1553
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:05,246
No way.

1554
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:07,083
Buttonup type, huh?

1555
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,689
You seem a a bit basic.

1556
01:07:09,756 --> 01:07:11,158
Yeah, we call that blue collar.

1557
01:07:11,225 --> 01:07:12,762
Oh. Okay.

1558
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:13,828
Oh!

1559
01:07:27,758 --> 01:07:31,031
Thank you so much
to these two gentlemen.

1560
01:07:31,098 --> 01:07:32,902
Uh, next we have

01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:35,608

1563
01:07:37,912 --> 01:07:38,981
but, uh

1564
01:07:39,047 --> 01:07:40,287
What are you doing after this?

1565
01:07:41,151 --> 01:07:42,822

Are you down?
Please welcome the dancers.

01:07:49,468 --> 01:07:52,207
Look. No, I'm serious.

1570
01:07:52,274 --> 01:07:53,911
Eggs? Bacon? Sausage?

1571
01:07:53,977 --> 01:07:55,079
My treat, come on!

1572
01:07:56,683 --> 01:07:59,789
That was. weird.

1573
01:08:04,264 --> 01:08:05,668
What was that?

1574
01:08:05,734 --> 01:08:06,870
III have no idea.

1575
01:08:06,937 --> 01:08:07,981
Yeah, man. That wasn't cool.

1576
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:09,642
Quit hassling her.

1577
01:08:09,709 --> 01:08:11,078
What's up?

1578
01:08:11,145 --> 01:08:13,349
I wasn't hassling her, man!
I was freaking wooing her!

1579
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:14,862
Shhh!
There is a performance going on!

1580
01:08:14,886 --> 01:08:16,121
Woo this!

01:08:16,188 --> 01:08:17,123
Okay, tough guy.

1582
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:18,560
Yeah. Come on. Come on.

1583
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:21,031
Hey! There is
a performance going on.

1584
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,440
So that's how it's
gonna be? Come on.

1585
01:08:25,507 --> 01:08:28,045
Seems like there's some
kind of kerfuffle backstage.

1586
01:08:28,112 --> 01:08:30,851
Kerfuffle? Who talks like that?

1587
01:08:30,918 --> 01:08:31,918
Ezra does.

1588
01:08:33,924 --> 01:08:35,460
I'm Ezra.

1589
01:08:35,527 --> 01:08:37,687
You're Emily, and you are
the prettiest girl at school.

1590
01:08:44,612 --> 01:08:45,446
What?

1591
01:08:45,514 --> 01:08:46,592
So, what are you doing later?

1592
01:08:46,616 --> 01:08:47,450
Hey!

1593
01:08:47,518 --> 01:08:48,820
Can you just give it a break?

1594
01:08:48,887 --> 01:08:52,060
Okay, who made you boss?
You're backstage.

1595
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:53,997
I'm the boss back here.

1596
01:08:54,064 --> 01:08:55,601
Kind of true.

1597
01:08:55,668 --> 01:08:57,805
See? You don't step to
the big dog in his kingdom,

1598
01:08:57,872 --> 01:08:59,542
huh?

1599
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:02,447
I think you're mixing
your metaphors there, Fred.

1600
01:09:09,862 --> 01:09:10,862
Well.

1601
01:09:12,702 --> 01:09:14,137
I'm so sorry.

1602
01:09:14,204 --> 01:09:15,741
I totally just
ruined your dance.

1603
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:19,147
Oh. Hi!

1604
01:09:21,352 --> 01:09:22,855
What in the world?

1605
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:27,932
Wow. Great! Aren't these
dancing people great?

1606
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:32,007
Okay. Youyou
you just keep dancing.

1607
01:09:32,073 --> 01:09:34,011
I don't think so.

1608
01:09:39,922 --> 01:09:41,291
You're hurting me.

1609
01:09:48,974 --> 01:09:50,844
No, no, no.

1610
01:09:53,049 --> 01:09:54,752
Oh, ho. Oh, my god.

1611
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:14,959
Oh, yeah. Found you.

1612
01:10:16,428 --> 01:10:18,365
Not the trees. Not the trees.

1613
01:10:20,604 --> 01:10:21,604
Oh.

1614
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:37,605
This is the most amazing show
I've ever been to.

1615
01:10:43,115 --> 01:10:44,384
Ruby! Oh, hey. 'Sup?

1616
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:45,888
Don't play innocent with me.

1617
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:47,594
You promised no magic,
and you're in there

1618
01:10:47,658 --> 01:10:49,161
shooting off your
little love arrows,

1619
01:10:49,227 --> 01:10:51,131
making everybody crazy!

1620
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:52,100
You don't know that.

1621
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:53,369
I do know that.

1622
01:10:53,436 --> 01:10:55,006
But I don't understand why!

1623
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:58,412
I did everything
that you me asked to do.

1624
01:10:58,479 --> 01:10:59,816
I put myself out there,

1625
01:10:59,882 --> 01:11:00,818
met somebody nice.

1626
01:11:00,884 --> 01:11:06,028
I'm sorry! I. I was jealous.

1627
01:11:06,094 --> 01:11:07,497
What?

1628
01:11:08,633 --> 01:11:12,875
You were right.
What you said earlier.

1629
01:11:14,377 --> 01:11:16,315
There is something between us.

1630
01:11:16,381 --> 01:11:23,262
Um, II think maybe
II might have possibly

1631
01:11:23,329 --> 01:11:26,669
developed some feelings for you.

1632
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,441
You like me?

1633
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:32,180
Yeah.

1634
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:33,291
But you completely shut me down.

1635
01:11:33,315 --> 01:11:34,417
I know! I.

1636
01:11:34,484 --> 01:11:35,763
You said
we couldn't be together.

1637
01:11:35,787 --> 01:11:37,023
We can't.

1638
01:11:50,517 --> 01:11:51,953
How am I supposed to take this?

1639
01:11:54,124 --> 01:11:55,561
I tell you that I like you,

1640
01:11:55,627 --> 01:11:59,669
and then you reject me.
You sabotage my date,

1641
01:11:59,735 --> 01:12:01,314
and then you tell me,
"Oh, no, just kidding,"

1642
01:12:01,338 --> 01:12:03,018
I actually do like you,
but no, no, no, never mind,

1643
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:04,812
"we don't have
a future together."

1644
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:08,720
What do you want from me?

1645
01:12:10,223 --> 01:12:15,934
I just. I want you to be happy.

1646
01:12:16,001 --> 01:12:17,103
I can't be happy.

1647
01:12:19,509 --> 01:12:20,677
Can't you see that?

1648
01:12:24,284 --> 01:12:25,954
Same thing over and over again.

1649
01:12:27,357 --> 01:12:29,829
Somethin' always goes wrong.

1650
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:36,843
Somehow I thought you and I
might be different.

1651
01:12:38,747 --> 01:12:39,849
But.

1652
01:12:42,453 --> 01:12:44,391
Nothing ever changes.

1653
01:13:26,743 --> 01:13:29,114
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, ya did it.

1654
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,383
Look at you.

1655
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:32,086
You get to move up
to the big chair.

1656
01:13:32,153 --> 01:13:33,690
I get my Christmas.

1657
01:13:33,757 --> 01:13:35,661
Everybody's a winner.

1658
01:13:35,727 --> 01:13:37,163
Couldn't have been easy.

1659
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:38,600
It wasn't.

1660
01:13:38,667 --> 01:13:41,739
Um. It it isn't.

1661
01:13:41,806 --> 01:13:43,743
Congratulations, Ruby.

1662
01:13:47,985 --> 01:13:49,622
Hey, kid, what's the matter?

1663
01:13:52,226 --> 01:13:55,466
I. can't.

1664
01:13:58,205 --> 01:14:01,144
I. I can't take this job.

1665
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,516
Not like this.

1666
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:06,021
What do you mean?

1667
01:14:06,088 --> 01:14:08,793
What I did was wrong.

1668
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:11,064
They're not right
for each other.

1669
01:14:11,131 --> 01:14:12,601
And he deserves
his perfect person.

1670
01:14:12,668 --> 01:14:14,905
They both do.

1671
01:14:14,972 --> 01:14:17,210
You were right. You were right.

1672
01:14:17,276 --> 01:14:18,546
What you said in the beginning:

1673
01:14:18,613 --> 01:14:20,984
II don't have
the stomach for this.

1674
01:14:21,051 --> 01:14:23,222
Shoving people together
just so they're not alone.

1675
01:14:23,288 --> 01:14:26,094
It's. it's why people
have stopped looking

1676
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:27,531
for their person. They.

1677
01:14:27,598 --> 01:14:29,200
They don't believe in love.

1678
01:14:32,006 --> 01:14:34,477
I just can't be a part of that.

1679
01:14:37,016 --> 01:14:38,887
You know what this means,
don't you?

1680
01:14:41,425 --> 01:14:43,495
I lose my job.

1681
01:14:45,934 --> 01:14:47,103
Wait.

1682
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:53,215
Ruby's right.

1683
01:14:53,282 --> 01:14:54,317
I'm sorry?

1684
01:14:54,384 --> 01:14:56,488
They're not a good match.

1685
01:14:56,556 --> 01:14:57,634
Why are we
putting people together

1686
01:14:57,658 --> 01:14:59,628
that don't belong together?

1687
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:00,964
It's how it's done.

1688
01:15:01,031 --> 01:15:02,868
Maybe this job
should be more than

1689
01:15:02,935 --> 01:15:05,406
random arrows flying around
and us just hitting our numbers.

1690
01:15:05,473 --> 01:15:07,343
And. if you

1691
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:08,479
don't believe that,

1692
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:10,584
then maybe you should retire.

1693
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:13,022
Just get on your stupid boat
and sail away.

1694
01:15:13,088 --> 01:15:14,859
Look, I don't know
who should be in charge,

1695
01:15:14,925 --> 01:15:17,163
but if you've given up on love,
it shouldn't be you.

1696
01:15:21,839 --> 01:15:24,277
Those were a lot of words
that I just said.

1697
01:15:25,914 --> 01:15:27,851
Since when did you become
so romantic?

1698
01:15:29,487 --> 01:15:31,959
Ugh! It's a new development.

1699
01:15:33,997 --> 01:15:36,501
This discussion isn't over.

1700
01:15:36,569 --> 01:15:38,640
And you

1701
01:15:38,707 --> 01:15:40,510
What's going
to happen to me now?

1702
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,282
It ain't pretty.

1703
01:15:45,419 --> 01:15:48,660
I have to take away your powers.

1704
01:15:48,727 --> 01:15:50,396
Does it hurt?

1705
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,033
It hurts later.

1706
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,846
By the power vested in me
as the God of Love,

1707
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:56,208
I hereby rescind
all your magical powers.

1708
01:16:01,786 --> 01:16:03,021
Is that it?

1709
01:16:03,088 --> 01:16:06,194
Yeah. Magic's weird. Hmm.

1710
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:07,564
Now for the hard part.

1711
01:16:10,937 --> 01:16:12,775
You have to be mortal.

1712
01:16:12,841 --> 01:16:15,212
Wait, you mean. Of course.

1713
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:18,018
What do you think happens
when you get fired from a job

1714
01:16:18,085 --> 01:16:20,690
as a deity? Now.

1715
01:16:20,757 --> 01:16:23,897
You gotta pay taxes,
you develop joint pains,

1716
01:16:23,963 --> 01:16:27,136
you gotta face the unknown.
It's horrible.

1717
01:16:27,203 --> 01:16:28,506
Philomena.

1718
01:16:28,573 --> 01:16:31,712
Please escort this human
back to Earth.

1719
01:16:31,779 --> 01:16:35,019
We will discuss
your little outburst later.

1720
01:16:35,085 --> 01:16:37,023
Yes, sir.

1721
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,064
Oh, Ruby.

1722
01:16:42,634 --> 01:16:43,937
One more thing.

1723
01:16:47,276 --> 01:16:48,312
I'm proud of you.

1724
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:51,184
You are? Yeah.

1725
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:52,691
It takes a lot of courage
to stand up

1726
01:16:52,754 --> 01:16:54,224
for what you believe in.

1727
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:56,194
You're gonna do
just fine on Earth.

1728
01:16:58,533 --> 01:16:59,835
I gotta admit.

1729
01:16:59,902 --> 01:17:02,875
I'll miss your
annoying chipperness.

1730
01:17:02,941 --> 01:17:04,512
You think I'm annoying?

1731
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:05,479
That's not the point.

1732
01:17:05,547 --> 01:17:07,784
Point is, you done good.

1733
01:17:07,851 --> 01:17:09,291
You helped a lot of people
find love,

1734
01:17:09,354 --> 01:17:11,491
and now I think
it's time for you,

1735
01:17:11,559 --> 01:17:13,696
find a little love for yourself.

1736
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:19,073
Well, enough of that.

1737
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:20,376
Scram.

1738
01:17:25,352 --> 01:17:30,931
So. How's it feel, being mortal?

1739
01:17:30,997 --> 01:17:32,868
Pretty much the same, I guess.

1740
01:17:32,935 --> 01:17:34,972
That's kind of a letdown.

1741
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:38,580
Hey. Did you stick up
for me back there?

1742
01:17:38,646 --> 01:17:41,819
Oh. I mean. I guess.

1743
01:17:41,886 --> 01:17:44,023
That was really cool of you.

1744
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:46,328
Yeah. It was really cool of me,
wasn't it?

1745
01:17:46,394 --> 01:17:47,472
I think we're friends now.

1746
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,616
Okay. I'm drawing the line.

1747
01:17:48,666 --> 01:17:49,986
There's a reason
that we are here.

1748
01:17:50,035 --> 01:17:51,035
Okay.

1749
01:17:57,049 --> 01:17:58,553
Amber?

1750
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,557
Hi, I'm I'm Ruby,

1751
01:18:00,624 --> 01:18:01,859
one of Charlie's friends.

1752
01:18:01,926 --> 01:18:04,832
Oh. You're the one.

1753
01:18:04,899 --> 01:18:06,268
The one what?

1754
01:18:06,334 --> 01:18:08,138
Charlie and I
broke up last night.

1755
01:18:08,205 --> 01:18:10,610
He said he was in love
with someone else.

1756
01:18:10,677 --> 01:18:13,382
You.

1757
01:18:13,448 --> 01:18:15,352
I'm so sorry. Hey.

1758
01:18:15,419 --> 01:18:17,256
The last thing I want
is a man who is in love

1759
01:18:17,323 --> 01:18:18,860
with someone else.

1760
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:20,462
You should go for him.

1761
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:23,335
Seriously.

1762
01:18:23,402 --> 01:18:26,509
Amber, you're
a really nice person.

1763
01:18:29,047 --> 01:18:31,819
Also, I am so sorry
about your show last night.

1764
01:18:31,886 --> 01:18:34,658
Yeah. What a disaster!

1765
01:18:34,725 --> 01:18:36,294
But you know
what the funny part is?

1766
01:18:36,361 --> 01:18:38,766
If the show hadn't gone
so completely off the rails,

1767
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:41,071
I wouldn't have connected
with Fred.

1768
01:18:46,515 --> 01:18:48,151
I think he might be the one.

1769
01:18:49,588 --> 01:18:51,057
You know what?

1770
01:18:51,124 --> 01:18:52,326
I think you might be right.

1771
01:18:52,393 --> 01:18:54,598
Really? Me too.

1772
01:18:54,665 --> 01:18:57,203
We're both in the theater,
you know?

1773
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:59,474
Kindred spirits.

1774
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:01,779
Like someone up there
has brought us together.

1775
01:19:03,382 --> 01:19:04,752
Who's that?

1776
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:07,724
Ruby. She's sweet.

1777
01:19:07,791 --> 01:19:11,899
So. your nerdy teacher
is on the market.

1778
01:19:11,966 --> 01:19:15,039
What an interesting development.

1779
01:19:16,241 --> 01:19:17,644
Question is.

1780
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:19,147
What are you gonna do about it?

1781
01:19:25,326 --> 01:19:26,361
Here?

1782
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:27,788
He volunteers
every Christmas Day.

1783
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:29,500
Ugh. Of course he does.

1784
01:19:29,568 --> 01:19:30,502
You comin'?

1785
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:31,504
No.

1786
01:19:31,572 --> 01:19:32,841
You don't need magic.

1787
01:19:32,908 --> 01:19:35,145
You two nerds are
perfect for each other.

1788
01:19:35,212 --> 01:19:36,749
Besides, I gotta
go back to the office

1789
01:19:36,816 --> 01:19:39,420
and get yelled at by Cupid.

1790
01:19:39,487 --> 01:19:41,057
I'm really proud of you.

1791
01:19:43,395 --> 01:19:46,167
Okay. Come here.

1792
01:19:46,234 --> 01:19:47,871
Oh!

1793
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:50,744
Good luck, Ruby. Thank you.

1794
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:52,413
Go get it. Oh!

1795
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,989
Oh, look, it's Ruby.

1796
01:19:57,056 --> 01:19:58,826
Merry Christmas, Ruby!

1797
01:19:58,893 --> 01:19:59,895
Merry Christmas, guys.

1798
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,331
What are you doin' here?

1799
01:20:01,398 --> 01:20:03,836
Obviously, being good citizens.

1800
01:20:03,903 --> 01:20:06,274
Professor Conrad offered us
extra credit for next semester

1801
01:20:06,341 --> 01:20:07,844
if we came
and volunteered with him.

1802
01:20:07,911 --> 01:20:09,715
All right.
Also, there's extra credit.

1803
01:20:09,782 --> 01:20:11,151
Where's Charlie?

1804
01:20:11,217 --> 01:20:13,556
He took off.
He said he had to catch a train.

1805
01:20:13,623 --> 01:20:15,159
A train? To where?

1806
01:20:15,225 --> 01:20:18,633
Said he was going to some
boring cabin on a lake.

1807
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:19,900
He's spending Christmas alone.

1808
01:20:21,739 --> 01:20:23,710
You love him, huh?

1809
01:20:27,183 --> 01:20:28,886
It's totally obvious.

1810
01:20:28,953 --> 01:20:31,458
You guys are made
for each other.

1811
01:20:31,525 --> 01:20:34,063
I guess I yes. Yes.

1812
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,569
I love him. I love Charlie!

1813
01:20:36,635 --> 01:20:37,738
Knew it.

1814
01:20:37,804 --> 01:20:38,740
Oh, you should tell him.

1815
01:20:38,806 --> 01:20:39,675
Yes!

1816
01:20:39,742 --> 01:20:42,046
Yo! I'll drive.

1817
01:20:42,113 --> 01:20:43,291
- Shotgun!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1818
01:20:43,315 --> 01:20:45,019
Yeah. Come on. Let's go.

1819
01:20:45,085 --> 01:20:46,725
Oh, my gosh.
It's so romantic I might cry.

1820
01:20:50,897 --> 01:20:52,066
Slow down, Raif!

1821
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:54,705
No! Go faster! Punch it!

1822
01:20:54,772 --> 01:20:56,007
Where are we going?

1823
01:20:56,074 --> 01:20:57,319
Why are you driving
if you don't know

1824
01:20:57,343 --> 01:20:58,980
where the train station is?

1825
01:20:59,047 --> 01:21:01,451
Right! Turn right!

1826
01:21:04,758 --> 01:21:06,361
This is my first time in a car!

1827
01:21:09,033 --> 01:21:10,335
It's kinda scary.

1828
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:22,627
Good luck, Ruby!

1829
01:21:22,694 --> 01:21:23,694
Bye!

1830
01:21:27,203 --> 01:21:28,271
Charlie!

1831
01:21:35,018 --> 01:21:36,354
Hello.

1832
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:37,858
Merry Christmas.

1833
01:21:40,129 --> 01:21:41,866
What are you doing here?

1834
01:21:41,932 --> 01:21:44,437
You, uh, you taking a trip?

1835
01:21:44,504 --> 01:21:46,876
Yeah. Um, just needed
some time away.

1836
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,282
I heard you and Amber broke up.

1837
01:21:51,451 --> 01:21:53,856
You told me
to follow my heart, Ruby.

1838
01:21:53,923 --> 01:21:56,294
I couldn't stay with Amber
and do that at the same time.

1839
01:21:57,798 --> 01:22:00,302
Okay, the thing is. I love you.

1840
01:22:02,139 --> 01:22:04,210
I'm in love with you.

1841
01:22:04,277 --> 01:22:06,281
And also, I really like you

1842
01:22:06,347 --> 01:22:08,285
as a person, you know.
Ruby, we you know.

1843
01:22:08,351 --> 01:22:10,657
I know I said we didn't
have a future.

1844
01:22:10,723 --> 01:22:14,698
That it was impossible,
but it's not. Not anymore.

1845
01:22:14,765 --> 01:22:18,138
See, uh. I kinda got fired.

1846
01:22:18,205 --> 01:22:21,579
Actually, no, II quit.

1847
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:25,018
I gave it up. For you.

1848
01:22:28,258 --> 01:22:31,030
You mean you're not a

1849
01:22:31,097 --> 01:22:34,003
Magical sprite spreading love?

1850
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:39,347
Nope.
Now I'm just a regular girl.

1851
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:42,052
I got a lot to learn.
It's all so new.

1852
01:22:44,023 --> 01:22:45,459
In fact.

1853
01:22:48,165 --> 01:22:49,433
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1854
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,937
II just really
wanted to do that.

1855
01:22:51,004 --> 01:22:52,439
That was that was my first kiss.

1856
01:22:52,507 --> 01:22:55,412
I knew it would be nice.

1857
01:22:55,479 --> 01:22:56,582
Nice?

1858
01:23:07,971 --> 01:23:09,741
Wow!

1859
01:23:09,808 --> 01:23:11,712
Wow is a much better response.

1860
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:15,854
I love you too.

1861
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,191
You do?

1862
01:23:18,258 --> 01:23:22,399
Madly, crazy, head over heels.

1863
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:26,642
Oh, my God. They're so cute,

1864
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:27,811
I think I'm gonna die.

1865
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,150
Yo! Way to go, Professor Conrad.

1866
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:34,791
You brought my students, huh?

1867
01:23:34,858 --> 01:23:36,294
I needed a ride.

1868
01:23:40,235 --> 01:23:41,437
Oh, my God.

1869
01:23:42,373 --> 01:23:44,143
Oh. What? What was that?

1870
01:23:45,245 --> 01:23:47,951
I wowed her with my charms.

1871
01:23:48,018 --> 01:23:51,457
Gina, I got your text.

1872
01:23:51,525 --> 01:23:53,228
I'm not looking
for a relationship.

1873
01:24:00,843 --> 01:24:01,946
Right on.

1874
01:24:03,248 --> 01:24:06,789
It's just so beautiful.

1875
01:24:11,431 --> 01:24:13,468
So this was your plan all along?

1876
01:24:13,536 --> 01:24:15,405
Those two are perfect
for each other.

1877
01:24:15,472 --> 01:24:17,711
Oh, please. You think
this was about them?

1878
01:24:17,777 --> 01:24:19,289
I knew they were destined
for each other.

1879
01:24:19,313 --> 01:24:21,518
This was about you, Philomena.

1880
01:24:21,585 --> 01:24:23,255
Me?

1881
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:24,891
I needed somebody
to take my place

1882
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:26,795
who was tough

1883
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:29,000
but loving.

1884
01:24:29,066 --> 01:24:31,037
I was testing you.

1885
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,516
And boy, oh boy,
did you come through.

1886
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:33,540
When you stood up

1887
01:24:33,576 --> 01:24:37,517
for Ruby,
when you defended love.

1888
01:24:37,584 --> 01:24:39,554
I knew I had the right person
for the job.

1889
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:44,765
Wow. That is not where
I thought this was going.

1890
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:46,535
I don't know what to say.

1891
01:24:46,602 --> 01:24:49,841
Say you'll do a good job,
because it's important.

1892
01:24:49,908 --> 01:24:53,415
The world needs love
now more than ever.

1893
01:24:53,481 --> 01:24:56,555
Well, my work is done.

1894
01:24:56,622 --> 01:24:57,624
I'm out of here.

1895
01:24:58,793 --> 01:24:59,861
Good luck, Cupid.

1896
01:25:02,232 --> 01:25:03,602
Cupid.

1897
01:25:04,838 --> 01:25:06,575
I like the sound of that.

1898
01:25:11,484 --> 01:25:13,556
Did you make all this happen?

1899
01:25:13,623 --> 01:25:15,092
No.

1900
01:25:15,158 --> 01:25:17,897
No arrows. No magic.

1901
01:25:17,964 --> 01:25:22,006
I'm just a normal girl
with the boy she loves.

1902
01:25:22,072 --> 01:25:23,509
It's gonna be a big adventure.

1903
01:25:43,849 --> 01:25:46,354
Oh, look at that sunset,
will ya?

1904
01:25:46,421 --> 01:25:47,757
Merry Christmas to all

1905
01:25:47,824 --> 01:25:51,565
and to all
a good Valentine's Day.

1906
01:25:51,632 --> 01:25:55,038
It's right around the corner,
get somebody somethin' nice.

1907
01:25:55,105 --> 01:25:56,675
Maybe some flowers.

1908
01:25:56,742 --> 01:25:59,514
Candy's always nice,
but it's too pricey.

1909
01:25:59,581 --> 01:26:02,754
That's okay, give 'em a hug.
Give 'em a kiss.

1910
01:26:02,821 --> 01:26:06,562
