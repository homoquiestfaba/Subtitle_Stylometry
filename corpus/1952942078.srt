1
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:03,582
And breathe.

2
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,616
And breathe.

3
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:10,235
Now whenever
you start feeling...

4
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:12,069
those little contractions...

5
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,684
I want you to take the time,
find a comfortable place...

6
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:19,389
and practise this
exercise, understand?

7
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:23,179
I'll see you next week.

8
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:42,541
My mind must be
playing tricks on me.

9
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:49,765
Looked all in my trunk
and I can't find my toby.

10
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:54,031
What's that? -It's a charm my
great-grandmother gave to me.

11
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:55,947
It'll show up.

12
00:03:56,617 --> 00:03:59,439
If my daddy calls, can
you tell him I walked home?

13
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,681
You be careful, and thank you
for taking care of Sunny.

14
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,302
Bye bye baby.
Bye.

15
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:16,581
Baby brother and his wife are taking
advantage of the situation here.

16
00:04:17,683 --> 00:04:19,022
Now I hate to be mean
but this business...

17
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:22,488
of them picking up Sunny whenever
they choose has got to come to an end.

18
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:26,231
And i'm gonna also ask them
why he wasn't at your birthday.

19
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:30,961
Gideon, don't bother the poor boy.

20
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:36,824
It just takes some people a little
longer to figure out who they are.

21
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:40,636
Yeah, I don't understand how
two brothers can be so different.

22
00:04:42,104 --> 00:04:43,144
Suzie.

23
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,921
Why don't you shut that door
and... come on over here.

24
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,576
Who is it?
Baby brother.

25
00:05:57,326 --> 00:06:00,564
Babe brother.
Oh mother it's cold out there tonight.

26
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:05,392
I'm glad you came to
the door instead of him.

27
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:09,404
This does not make any sense. You
are going to drag that poor boy...

28
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:12,057
out into the cold air at
this time in the morning.

29
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:16,802
Is he upstairs?

30
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,309
Where's Sunny?

31
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,255
He's upstairs.
Come on.

32
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:27,832
At don't wake up your daddy.

33
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:51,107
Thanks... for taking care of him.

34
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:55,666
I'll try not to be so long next time.

35
00:06:56,911 --> 00:06:58,599
Babe brother, what time is it?

36
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:01,671
Now do you think you can
just treat us like slaves?

37
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,168
It's after 1 o'clock.

38
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:05,806
I tried to call you to let
you know I was gonna be late.

39
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:07,293
That is a lie.

40
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:09,170
Can we save all this
for tomorrow, please?

41
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:11,268
Don't think you can get
ahead by riding our backs.

42
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:12,767
I paid my own way.
Since when?

43
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:14,632
Take Sunny home please.

44
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:27,611
Babe.

45
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:39,402
Take your vitamins.

46
00:07:52,865 --> 00:07:53,891
I'm the boss.

47
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:55,441
No.

48
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:01,885
Babe, I said no.

49
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:04,223
Well he wouldn't want any if you
didn't try to keep it away from him.

50
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:06,888
Just because you were spoilt
don't try and spoil Sunny.

51
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:13,153
Spoilt?
Spoilt?

52
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:17,683
My daddy never gave me anything
without my having to sweat for it.

53
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:22,593
Every summer, we had to pick all
of big mama's $100 land hairs.

54
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:24,358
and go to church all day all Sunday.

55
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:28,621
For big daddy, callouses and
sweat were the mark of a man.

56
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:33,080
Now Sunny will never have to
bust his knuckles like we did.

57
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:34,910
Come on baby i'm late.

58
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:40,024
Come from a family that's no
different from farm animals.

59
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:44,749
The world goes by while they stand
along the fence chewing on their cud.

60
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:49,561
Look, he needs discipline. Now
you are not helping when...

61
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,149
I tell him not to do something and
then you allow him to get away with it.

62
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:58,600
I love you, I gotta
go, see you later.

63
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:09,253
I wish that boy next door would
learn how to blow that thing.

64
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,892
So when you gonna find time
to help me fix the roof?

65
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:40,626
You aren't gonna believe me when
I tell you i'm afraid of heights.

66
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:44,913
You used that excuse...
to get out the army.

67
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:48,327
You always got something
to say, hey brother.

68
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,029
Your mother asked me
not to mention it...

69
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:54,910
but her birthday was last week.

70
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:04,896
I'd forgotton.

71
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:08,144
I ordered some cloth...

72
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:13,697
It didn't come in and...

73
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:20,060
I felt so bad if I were to come
to your birthday without that.

74
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:22,014
I just stayed at home.

75
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,271
What did you wife get her?

76
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:30,949
We got the same thing.

77
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:36,259
Boy, you tell your
wife to come in here.

78
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:56,205
Why don't you come in for a while?

79
00:10:56,927 --> 00:10:57,939
What would I talk about?

80
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:00,186
I have not read
this month's almanac...

81
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,808
I do not care to hear how
the corn was last fall...

82
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:05,725
or how to get rid of
gophers by using garlic.

83
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:10,813
They pride themselves
on making life difficult...

84
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:12,533
and that's just
not my cup of tea.

85
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:15,431
Come on.
Come on.

86
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:19,022
Just for a minute.
One minute.

87
00:11:20,926 --> 00:11:22,834
Quick, how much is cut
per pound and how many...

88
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,575
gallons of water does it
take to water an acre?

89
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:25,719
Gotcha.

90
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:28,701
Babe brother, he's a poor boy.

91
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,692
You all should've been hard
on him like you were on me.

92
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:35,485
He wouldn't be the way he is.

93
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,168
Junior,

94
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,207
everybody got the same.

95
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:45,783
I breastfed him just
like I breastfed you.

96
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:51,767
So another preacher said
'Brother, you are among friends...

97
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:57,527
tell us what's troubling your
soul, clear your conscience.

98
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,582
So the second preacher said...

99
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:05,658
'We have a bond because we
are confessing to one another...

100
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,529
so I must tell you,
my sin is corn liquor...

101
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,896
I just acts a fool behind
that spirit water...

102
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,404
I loves it more than preaching,
ain't that a sin lord?

103
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,407
So all the preachers are confessing
all their sins to one another...

104
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,177
each one worse than the last one...

105
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,357
finally they get
to the last preacher...

106
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:27,290
now he has been very quiet and
listening to every word that fell...

107
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:29,505
so a preacher says to him...

108
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:35,165
'Brother, confessing will lift up
your burden, bear your soul, we did.'

109
00:12:36,374 --> 00:12:40,845
So the last preacher says 'No...
my sin is the worst of all'

110
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:46,098
So another preacher says 'Oh man go
on and stop all that s...suspense.'

111
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:52,155
So the last preacher said 'Like I
said, my sin is the worst of all...

112
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:55,179
my sin is gossiping...

113
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,779
and I can't wait to go out and
tell everything i've heard.'

114
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:05,129
Gideon, you really ought not
to tell him stories like that.

115
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,575
Tell me another story.
No no no, you tell me a story.

116
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:16,144
Once upon a time, my mommy and
daddy lived in this big...

117
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:20,150
You stay back.

118
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:23,792
You might cut your fingers.

119
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:26,839
I looked everywhere for my toby.

120
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:02,482
Harry.
Suzie.

121
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:04,061
Is that you?

122
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:07,416
I can't believe it, it is you.

123
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,175
Gideon, Gideon look who is here.

124
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:15,785
Harry, oh good God.

125
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:21,373
We haven't seen you in what? It
must've been thirty years or more.

126
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,115
We haven't seen Harry since
we left our old home.

127
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:28,770
This is my grandson, this is...

128
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:31,105
this is my youngest son's child.

129
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:33,932
He's kinda like when my
boys were about his age.

130
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:41,072
Boy that's bad luck to
touch a fella with a broom.

131
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:47,035
He knows better than that.

132
00:14:47,623 --> 00:14:50,563
Now Sunny, you apologise
to Harry. -I'm sorry.

133
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,688
So, what brings you
around these parts?

134
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,101
I came all the way from Detroit
by bus going to Oakland.

135
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,096
Bus stopped in Los Angeles, I
had to get off and take me a rest.

136
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:12,055
You stay til you feel better now,
we would like to hear all the news.

137
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:14,292
I'm worn out but...

138
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:16,993
won't you feel like your
taking in a stranger?

139
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:21,121
You put them boxes down and
you stay as long as you like.

140
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:26,817
You sure i'm not a bother?
Oh man, come on.

141
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,515
I don't sleep on spring mattresses.

142
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:33,510
I always make me a
pallette on the floor.

143
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:59,811
Poor old Harry, he really must've been
worn out he's been asleep all day.

144
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:04,882
Good evening.
Good evening.

145
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:06,486
How you doing Harry?

146
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,968
It must be all the time zones that
crossed me made me feel this weary.

147
00:16:12,074 --> 00:16:13,899
Well you should go back and rest.

148
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:17,853
No maam, if I rest any longer
I won't sleep tonight.

149
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:23,746
May I use your bathroom
to wash up a bit?

150
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:28,395
Man, make like this is your home.

151
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:37,516
I always ask to keep from
wearing out welcome.

152
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:46,173
Harry, one can sure tell
you are from back home.

153
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,259
Nowadays people don't even
know what good manners are.

154
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:53,267
You had to know how to act
right where we come from.

155
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:56,697
You had to know how to
say 'yes sir, no sir'...

156
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,960
you had to know your place.

157
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:04,030
That's right, in those days
you could always find...

158
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:08,246
something redeeming in
the very worst person.

159
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:09,821
Harry,

160
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:15,434
I want you to meet my oldest son Julian,
his wife Pat and his daughter Rhonda.

161
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,919
Oh, this boy must
be turning over.

162
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:22,146
He just kicked me again.

163
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:33,299
Pleased to meet you.

164
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:43,998
Wake Harry and see if
he wants to go to church.

165
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:47,730
Let the man old sleep,
now we are going to be late.

166
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,711
Harry come on.
Next time.

167
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:00,639
-Hi. -I'll take care of
things here. -How you doing?

168
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:21,126
Uncle Joe have the illness, death.

169
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:13,215
What sort of work you in?
I'm a loan officer.

170
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:16,677
And my wife's in real estate.
That's how we met.

171
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,137
You're lovely, yes
indeed, yes indeed.

172
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:30,063
You're not like the
rest of Gideon's friends.

173
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:33,897
Most of them believe if you're not
hard at work then you're hard at sin.

174
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:39,749
I'm more modern... in my ways.

175
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,632
I don't believe in sin,
though there is good and evil.

176
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:50,480
And evil is something
that you work at.

177
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:57,312
Na uh, mustn't touch. You're mother
may not like you handling knives.

178
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:00,601
I think he just wanted
to see a rabbit's foot.

179
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:08,715
I let this rabbit's foot take the place
of my toby which I lost year's ago.

180
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,756
What's a toby?
A jar...

181
00:21:16,347 --> 00:21:18,796
that old people teach
you how to make.

182
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:21,806
You don't want to be at a
crossroads without one.

183
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,362
I had one for a long time
that used to belong...

184
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:27,978
to my grandmother who had
it since she was a child.

185
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:30,723
In my travels...

186
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:37,480
I misplaced it, and I been looking
over my shoulder ever since.

187
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,294
How do you like that?

188
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:48,034
I now baptise you in the name of the
father, the son and the holy ghost.

189
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:56,668
You have your child at home?
Have my child at home?

190
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:58,407
Oh please.

191
00:21:59,262 --> 00:22:03,798
I had my baby at Cedar and Sinai
and that ain't no county hospital.

192
00:22:05,631 --> 00:22:08,104
Some folks take that
natural stuff too far.

193
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:10,883
Junior's wife...

194
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:13,458
she kept her afterbirth
in the refridgerator...

195
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:15,703
that's why I don't eat
over there now.

196
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:19,387
Country folks have
some strange ways.

197
00:22:21,397 --> 00:22:22,573
You ever use this thing?

198
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:34,936
For those bad acting monkeys it's
just the thing for a mean dog.

199
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:41,234
Now I don't... know if I
actually did what I did...

200
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:46,408
or if I got my life story mixed
in with other folks' story but...

201
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:51,825
I seem to recall that I had
to use my crab apple there...

202
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:54,456
on a boy from back home.

203
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:59,960
And in obedience to the great
command, I now baptise you...

204
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:03,503
in the name of the father,
the son and the holy ghost.

205
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,118
I was coming...
down Beale street...

206
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:12,356
and I heard this music
coming from a saloon...

207
00:23:13,215 --> 00:23:14,758
sure enough it was Henry...

208
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:18,955
he and another boy had killed
the boy in their honker

209
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:22,558
and they balled the
jack in a towel.

210
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,711
Henry had lost one eye and had
a scar running down his face.

211
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,512
Bad luck I say.

212
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,485
We went up to his girl's room...

213
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:39,019
he got to drinking that corn liquor...

214
00:23:39,674 --> 00:23:42,483
drink would bring out
the worst in a fella.

215
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:45,936
I say him reach into his
pocket for his knife...

216
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:49,610
at the same time his girl
turned out the lights, bang!

217
00:23:54,922 --> 00:24:01,333
If I said, 'Man, the drinks.',
I keeps my knife open in my pocket.

218
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:06,747
Pick up the cards,
you not in a game.

219
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:17,573
So you used the knife?

220
00:24:19,086 --> 00:24:21,487
I don't know what happened
to him in the dark...

221
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:24,473
I know I protected
myself and always will.

222
00:24:27,618 --> 00:24:31,221
Hey, I got some... old...

223
00:24:33,157 --> 00:24:34,828
records I want you to hear.

224
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:40,225
I like blues sung simple,
man and his guitar.

225
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:52,188
How was church?
Linda.

226
00:25:09,226 --> 00:25:12,291
A woman in a family
way reminds me...

227
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:16,077
of spring in my younger days.

228
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:18,201
That's nice.

229
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:22,143
You and your husband are special.

230
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:27,064
Gideon tells me you do volunteer
work to help feed the poor.

231
00:25:29,623 --> 00:25:31,306
How many people
do you all feed?

232
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:36,350
Last Saturday we handed
out over 200 meals.

233
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:42,442
Good God almighty, bless
your bones child. 200...

234
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,803
but the problem grows.

235
00:25:46,137 --> 00:25:50,116
Week by week, crowds at the
doors just keep getting larger...

236
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:55,282
we just can't feed all the hungry.
Of course not.

237
00:25:56,218 --> 00:26:01,284
You ever heard of a man diving into
a river to save 500 drowning people?

238
00:26:04,218 --> 00:26:07,172
No.
You ain't.

239
00:26:12,468 --> 00:26:16,292
You have to take just one...
and fatten him up.

240
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:20,856
When you spread help too thin you
just nickel and dime the situation.

241
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:24,208
If you try to help
all, then all die.

242
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:28,546
But if you save one
life, life goes on.

243
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:32,379
You just have to remember
that medicine and words...

244
00:26:34,031 --> 00:26:39,459
leaves a bitter taste.
You have to... take one.

245
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,213
I don't know if we
could take one in...

246
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,764
with Rhonda and me at
home alone at times.

247
00:26:46,463 --> 00:26:48,938
Oh I wasn't pointing
the finger at you.

248
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:57,775
I appreciate you
lending me a hand.

249
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:01,908
That lazy ass brother of
mine was supposed to help me.

250
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:04,288
Some folks are still waiting
on their comeuppance.

251
00:27:05,805 --> 00:27:09,562
Don't take me wrong, but you
can't judge people how you act.

252
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:14,728
You're a caring person.

253
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:21,184
He should be caring,
that's not too much to ask.

254
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:26,666
You and your wife in your spare
time, work with the less fortunate.

255
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:31,663
I'm not talking about
you and what you do but...

256
00:27:32,147 --> 00:27:35,716
some folks that are always
around to help the victims...

257
00:27:36,126 --> 00:27:38,833
are deep down are attracted
to pain and suffering.

258
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:42,804
They love to be near the dying.

259
00:27:46,084 --> 00:27:47,823
But you never can tell
what's in the heart.

260
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,046
Let me give you a
hand with this.

261
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:55,946
Good morning.

262
00:27:56,427 --> 00:27:59,096
Excuse me Harry, could you
come downstairs for a minute...

263
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:00,815
there's someone I
want you to meet.

264
00:28:01,817 --> 00:28:03,589
I'll be right there.
ok.

265
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:10,426
Surprise.

266
00:28:21,314 --> 00:28:24,062
I couldn't believe it when Suzie
called and said you was staying here.

267
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:32,699
How've you been?

268
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,699
Girl, you still sing and dance?
Oh no Harry, i'm a different person now.

269
00:28:44,904 --> 00:28:46,573
Haven't the years
been good to Hattie?

270
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,114
It hasn't been the years,
it's been the men in her life.

271
00:28:53,594 --> 00:28:56,899
Harry, that's not nice.
I'm in church now.

272
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:01,906
Why go around and close the
barn when the horse is gone?

273
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:04,939
I remember when
you weren't saved.

274
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,852
That was way back when the Natchez
trace was just a dirt road.

275
00:29:11,178 --> 00:29:13,551
Some people grow up
and change their ways.

276
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:23,565
I know your mother ain't still
operating that house of hers.

277
00:29:24,948 --> 00:29:27,459
My mother passed on
some years ago.

278
00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:31,547
My mother passed on...

279
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:35,559
years ago.

280
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,257
Suzie.

281
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:40,411
Do you still have Joe's number?

282
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,091
I don't know, i'll have to look for it.

283
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:50,521
By the way, I came across Okra,
your childhood sweetheart.

284
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,468
Okra? Shute.

285
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:58,762
I wish I would catch that
egg-stealing skunk Okra.

286
00:30:00,616 --> 00:30:04,131
I could sure do with a
little swamp root now.

287
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,042
What?!

288
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:13,113
I haven't heard anyone
mention swamp root since...

289
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:16,326
butternut shoes went out.

290
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:19,969
You can certainly
tell your age my dear.

291
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:24,957
Do you know the saying 'Your
heart is in your left hand'?

292
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:32,940
Out of weariness, I
spoke to my own heart...

293
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:37,689
to leave it all back, and to die...

294
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:42,688
and I gave my heart,
to no madness and folly...

295
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:45,737
Harry...

296
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:49,466
you know you remind me of so
much that went wrong in my life.

297
00:30:53,105 --> 00:30:55,992
I have no enemies because
I don't live in the past.

298
00:30:56,994 --> 00:31:01,129
No sir, that's Pushkin,
you don't know him.

299
00:31:01,807 --> 00:31:05,699
He said 'In the hope
of glory and good...

300
00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:09,224
I look without fear ahead.'

301
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:12,796
An empty wagon
makes alot of noise.

302
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:16,474
You tappy head.

303
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,370
You ain't worth the
salt you put in greens.

304
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:26,095
We're speaking of tappyheads.

305
00:31:28,544 --> 00:31:30,527
We ought to have an
old-fashioned fish fry...

306
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:33,106
we can have it here next week.

307
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:35,566
Is this your house mister?

308
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:38,464
Sorry.

309
00:31:40,446 --> 00:31:44,773
What do you say Gideon?
Well, it's up to Suzie.

310
00:31:46,385 --> 00:31:49,410
Well, it would be nice.

311
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:54,908
In the mean time, Harry
can slaughter us a hog.

312
00:31:55,865 --> 00:31:57,437
I already have my dear.

313
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,792
Fred Jenkins.

314
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:21,400
Oh Suzie, you haven't changed a bit.
And you, if you ain't John Henry...

315
00:32:23,268 --> 00:32:27,382
Hattie, Marsh, oh you look so pretty.
-Where is everybody?

316
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:30,224
Marsh.

317
00:32:31,898 --> 00:32:33,852
Thanks for inviting me.
You're welcome.

318
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,694
Oh excuse me.

319
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:39,000
Oh Brad Tate

320
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:44,856
I'm still in love, and not
too old to get in a fight...

321
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,551
over a woman.

322
00:33:00,655 --> 00:33:02,869
How you doing?
Where'd you get this nice jacket?

323
00:33:03,324 --> 00:33:05,074
That's my Saturday night jacket.
Alright.

324
00:33:05,838 --> 00:33:07,364
Are you alright honey?

325
00:33:08,316 --> 00:33:10,639
Ok, go in there and i'll
bring you something to eat.

326
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,728
Hey Suzie, looks who's here.
It's the Clams.

327
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:26,090
Suzie.
Oh hello Phil.

328
00:33:26,993 --> 00:33:28,195
How you doing Phil.

329
00:33:28,748 --> 00:33:31,477
This is... Cherry Bell.
Hello.

330
00:33:32,406 --> 00:33:34,061
Thanks you so much for having us.

331
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,536
This is great.

332
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,512
Well it's about time.

333
00:33:50,938 --> 00:33:55,572
Oh Linda i'm so glad you could
come. You look very nice.

334
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:00,937
I'm sorry we're late but
Junior forgot his shoes.

335
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,400
I baked your favourite cherry pie.

336
00:34:59,086 --> 00:35:02,925
What's that?
Boy this is the real south.

337
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:06,908
That is real corn liquor.

338
00:35:09,347 --> 00:35:12,203
Is that real corn liquor?
It ain't Geritol.

339
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:16,854
We'll serve this in teacups.
There's a fight in everybody.

340
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:19,087
Get some teacups over here.

341
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:58,422
Let's get Hattie to sing
a song from the old days.

342
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,165
She used to keep those
juke jaws steaming.

343
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:07,889
Harry always tries
to be the kingfish.

344
00:37:08,632 --> 00:37:12,298
I told him i'm a different
person now, i'm saved.

345
00:37:37,627 --> 00:37:38,783
Grab me some teacups.

346
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,849
Get your socks knocked off.

347
00:37:54,882 --> 00:37:57,662
Son, you ain't danced
with your wife all night.

348
00:38:08,845 --> 00:38:10,527
There's something i've
always wanted to know...

349
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:15,008
tell me...
how did those boys die?

350
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,629
Now who you talking about?

351
00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:21,323
Miss clairmer's boy Henry to start with...

352
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:24,337
just as Hockle, there was another one.

353
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:26,285
Wasn't Hockle lynched?

354
00:38:28,878 --> 00:38:33,038
You know as well as I do, that
was made to look like a lynching.

355
00:38:35,944 --> 00:38:39,638
Now who would hang somebody
from a persimmon tree?

356
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:44,335
What difference does it make,
a persimmon tree, an oak tree...

357
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:47,406
a huckleberry bush?

358
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:52,071
Hockle's death almost
caused a race riot.

359
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:55,741
A lot of innocent people could've
been hurt behind that.

360
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,465
Strange as it may seem, it
mighta cleared the water.

361
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:04,018
Sometimes the right action
comes for the wrong reason.

362
00:39:08,775 --> 00:39:10,029
Come on Baby brother, bring Linda.

363
00:39:17,612 --> 00:39:19,272
Look, can you tell
me why me and Suzie...

364
00:39:19,272 --> 00:39:21,000
have got to be mother
and father to your child?

365
00:39:21,468 --> 00:39:22,775
You never take the boy anywhere.

366
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:25,380
If we didn't take Sunny to church, he
wouldn't have no sense of religion.

367
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:28,030
You don't want us to bring
him over here anymore?

368
00:39:28,427 --> 00:39:29,405
No no, that's not it.

369
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:31,654
It's when do you find
time to be parents?

370
00:39:31,982 --> 00:39:34,146
You never pick him up
before 9 or 10 at night.

371
00:39:34,857 --> 00:39:36,058
Look now you are all into yourselves.

372
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:39,497
Now Junior spends time with his child.
Oh here we go with that again.

373
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,122
Yes. -Wow, i'm so sick of you
talking about Junior all the time.

374
00:40:01,141 --> 00:40:04,512
I think if anybody had a
hand in killing Hockle...

375
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:07,054
you're the hands.

376
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:10,456
You should've asked
Henry and Chick.

377
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:13,591
Chick was already
killed by a mob.

378
00:40:14,531 --> 00:40:16,402
He killed a white man that
owed him some some money.

379
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:19,941
And when they caught him,
they tied him behind a car...

380
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:24,136
and they dragged him outta
the hills, back to town.

381
00:40:25,202 --> 00:40:27,277
Them boys never did
have good luck.

382
00:40:29,347 --> 00:40:30,658
You're damn right they didn't.

383
00:40:32,155 --> 00:40:35,406
Especially my cousin... Henry.

384
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:39,223
Henry made a lot of enemies.

385
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:42,566
He had a big mouth.

386
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:10,951
Gideon, better be careful.
You'll get a stroke arguing.

387
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:15,507
I don't care if I drop dead, as
long as he learns something from it.

388
00:41:16,896 --> 00:41:18,378
Why's he always picking on me?

389
00:41:18,737 --> 00:41:21,544
He's not picking on you, he's not.
He's just being like all parents...

390
00:41:21,922 --> 00:41:24,542
concerned about the ones they love.
I don't need that kinda love.

391
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:28,578
I don't need to be reminded all the time
that Big Momma was born in slavery...

392
00:41:29,202 --> 00:41:31,937
if you really care about me,
just show me how to make money.

393
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:34,476
Babe brother. -He doesn't
mean what he says.

394
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,706
Let's go back inside.
No!

395
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:42,695
Before anybody moves, you two...

396
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:48,124
shake hands. And don't carry
this thing any farther.

397
00:42:39,147 --> 00:42:41,092
Honey, are you gonna lie
there and sleep all morning?

398
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:46,840
I gotta go.

399
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:56,442
If my boys had lived, I woulda
had the same words as you.

400
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:07,631
I could sit in the
train tracks all day

401
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,350
We laid enough of
them didn't we?

402
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:16,945
So many memories stretched
along tracks like these.

403
00:43:46,213 --> 00:43:49,654
We'll go a little further,
the walk'll do us some good.

404
00:44:33,245 --> 00:44:34,433
Suzie.

405
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:37,859
Suzie.

406
00:44:41,608 --> 00:44:43,853
Gideon, what's wrong?
I'm worn out.

407
00:44:46,145 --> 00:44:47,578
Just stay in bed and rest.

408
00:44:50,518 --> 00:44:54,442
I gotta feed them chickens...
before they wake everybody up.

409
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,232
You stay inside.
I'll see to them.

410
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:24,121
Harry, Harry. Can you
watch Gideon for a while?

411
00:45:24,356 --> 00:45:26,353
One of my girls
is going into labour.

412
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:30,346
Just run along, i'll fix him
some soup, he'll be alright.

413
00:46:13,544 --> 00:46:14,953
The hard part is over.

414
00:46:59,147 --> 00:47:00,083
Gideon.

415
00:47:05,825 --> 00:47:07,384
Oh my god.

416
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,321
The poor thing.

417
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:13,202
Careful on this door knob.

418
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,352
Get out the way. -Careful of
his legs. -Move out the way.

419
00:47:20,626 --> 00:47:21,331
You got him?

420
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:33,703
Ok i'm almost finished here.

421
00:47:37,509 --> 00:47:38,789
Doctor says he'll be
better off at home.

422
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:47,575
Let's put his robe on him.

423
00:47:55,696 --> 00:47:58,348
Boy I thought you 'bout
to cross the river.

424
00:47:59,597 --> 00:48:01,078
You look good.

425
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,733
I say daddy-o.

426
00:48:06,032 --> 00:48:08,059
Would you do me a favour
and see if you can turn...

427
00:48:08,273 --> 00:48:10,397
off that tap in the bathroom,
my hand is too weak.

428
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:13,888
Any time you need somebody to fill
in for you, you just let me know.

429
00:48:15,605 --> 00:48:16,869
Would you do me another favour?

430
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:19,830
I don't like to ask it but could
you clean the tub for me?

431
00:48:20,695 --> 00:48:22,658
My back kinda hurts
when I bend over.

432
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:24,941
No problem.

433
00:48:35,028 --> 00:48:37,172
That smells like fresh coffee.

434
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,662
Would you like a cup?

435
00:48:42,722 --> 00:48:44,531
Only if you can spare.

436
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:51,050
Son, would you get me
an old newspaper please.

437
00:48:52,165 --> 00:48:56,230
Yes sir, these dogs
need to be buried.

438
00:48:58,086 --> 00:48:59,337
Been on them too long.

439
00:49:16,968 --> 00:49:19,211
I will leave you something in my will.

440
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:07,068
You think old Gideon's gonna
live to see this month out?

441
00:50:11,823 --> 00:50:13,991
I came upon the valley of bones,

442
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,370
the serpent said
make this your home,

443
00:50:21,164 --> 00:50:25,878
dries my sole pea,
heaven is lost to thee,

444
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,262
your gonna make a way.

445
00:50:59,794 --> 00:51:01,849
Chicken hates to see a
preacher coming to dinner.

446
00:51:05,577 --> 00:51:09,435
Marvin you gotta catch the next one,
you do it coz i'm out of breath.

447
00:51:10,575 --> 00:51:13,304
If I have to chase that
one, we won't eat.

448
00:51:16,523 --> 00:51:19,296
Sister, we've come to
see how you are doing.

449
00:51:19,946 --> 00:51:22,337
We came to ask you if we
could pray over Gideon.

450
00:51:24,728 --> 00:51:25,674
Please.

451
00:51:43,238 --> 00:51:45,002
Brother Gideon.

452
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:57,076
I put some plumber christian leaves
under his feet to draw out the fever.

453
00:51:58,488 --> 00:52:00,478
And what else have
you been giving him?

454
00:52:02,992 --> 00:52:05,911
I crossed his stomach
with some cold oil and...

455
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,466
I gave him some cow tea.

456
00:52:12,136 --> 00:52:16,438
Well sister Suzie, I
would think you depend on

457
00:52:16,805 --> 00:52:18,830
prayer rather than these
old fashioned remedies.

458
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:22,595
Let us read from the bible...

459
00:52:24,203 --> 00:52:26,617
'The lord reigns, the peoples tremble...

460
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:31,024
he sits enthroned upon the
cherubim, let the earth quake.

461
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,648
Never play with someone else's cards...

462
00:52:44,315 --> 00:52:45,691
You always get a new deck.

463
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:51,336
Look at this cards.

464
00:52:56,398 --> 00:52:59,394
See anthing?
It's just a regular card.

465
00:53:01,738 --> 00:53:06,429
Son, I could tell you everything
you got with that deck.

466
00:53:07,087 --> 00:53:09,390
It's marked. Now...

467
00:53:11,848 --> 00:53:18,769
I'm gonna show you how to make some
money in case you stop somewhere.

468
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,979
Harry just leeches of your parents.

469
00:53:25,757 --> 00:53:27,819
He's a master in wearing out wealth.

470
00:53:29,337 --> 00:53:34,295
Harry's the kinda guy you'd love to take
out in the woods and leave under a rock.

471
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:39,378
And where did he get the power to
summon up all his raffish friends?

472
00:53:40,502 --> 00:53:41,891
They all smell like mothballs.

473
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:48,788
Damn.

474
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:52,560
How come you don't see to it that
Sunny puts his shoes on right?

475
00:53:54,028 --> 00:53:55,943
What you doing?
Why don't...

476
00:54:08,518 --> 00:54:11,209
Let's give old dry bones a call,
see if he's coming or not.

477
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:15,479
Okra likes to exaggerate alot,
keep us waiting all night.

478
00:54:28,506 --> 00:54:29,533
Stand up, stand up.

479
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:39,706
Oh come on babe.

480
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,372
Come on honey.

481
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,496
Gotta get your shoe tied.

482
00:55:35,494 --> 00:55:40,677
When was the last... the
last time I saw James was...

483
00:55:42,778 --> 00:55:44,668
How about the pork chops?
Come down this way girl.

484
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,001
Everbody heard the story about Oink.
You all remember the story fo Oink?

485
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:51,003
Remember Oink?
Oink Oink.

486
00:55:53,547 --> 00:55:55,181
Give me the whole piece girl.

487
00:55:55,838 --> 00:55:57,742
Two highway patrolmen
coming down the street...

488
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:01,504
coming down a highway, two
coloured boys get picked up...

489
00:56:02,419 --> 00:56:04,533
asked them for their
ID, so Oink says...

490
00:56:05,608 --> 00:56:07,137
Oink says, he just says 'Oink'.

491
00:56:09,273 --> 00:56:12,251
Come on bro, talk to me.
Put the cigarette down.

492
00:56:14,029 --> 00:56:15,654
What is it?
Grasshopper.

493
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:19,505
Which as you can imagine,
you gotta mash shit up.

494
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:23,403
Look here, I'm talking.
You got what you asked man.

495
00:56:24,336 --> 00:56:25,523
Harry, you can imagine.

496
00:56:34,899 --> 00:56:35,991
Remember the time they almost...

497
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:39,873
because of his breath.

498
00:56:58,967 --> 00:57:00,301
Hit him in the head
with a piece of cake.

499
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:03,135
She did hit me in the head.

500
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,905
That's good.

501
00:57:24,147 --> 00:57:25,992
Peter wiggled and wiggled...

502
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,276
he wiggled right out of
his jacket just in time.

503
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,879
Peter ran to the toolshed,
he saw a watering can...

504
00:57:37,347 --> 00:57:40,905
and he jumped into the can,
and there was some water inside.

505
00:57:44,312 --> 00:57:47,567
I'm ok, go on back to your friends.

506
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:55,883
And um... there was some water
inside and Peter felt cold and wet.

507
00:57:57,068 --> 00:57:59,442
And then he sneezed.
You sure you ok?

508
00:58:00,535 --> 00:58:03,153
Catchoo. What did he do?
Sneezed.

509
00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:07,634
And then he sneezed.

510
00:58:24,038 --> 00:58:27,991
I want my daddy.
Rhonda, drag him in here.

511
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:34,358
Come on.

512
00:58:36,336 --> 00:58:38,068
Come on.

513
00:58:38,626 --> 00:58:40,563
You don't have to say anything
if you don't want to.

514
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:46,165
If you be nice, I will
take you to Disneyland.

515
00:58:48,476 --> 00:58:52,825
I wanna hear what happened. My
brother is a jackass and a damn fool.

516
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,008
Both you been scarce as hens since
you come here. -Calm down Junior.

517
00:58:56,336 --> 00:58:57,958
I didn't know where to go.

518
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:04,043
Couldn't go to my family, my friends.
Oh, what are we.

519
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,011
Rhonda why don't you take
Sunny out in the back yard.

520
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:10,199
Oh and get a bowl and
pick some strawberries.

521
00:59:10,632 --> 00:59:12,660
I bet Sunny'll enjoy that, now go on.

522
00:59:18,405 --> 00:59:21,524
Now you shouldn't be talking about
that boys father in front of him.

523
00:59:23,069 --> 00:59:26,732
This is family business,
we have to pull together.

524
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,703
The man is still a jackass.

525
00:59:29,683 --> 00:59:34,155
Everybody should have some
mother witch. -Junior, please.

526
00:59:35,969 --> 00:59:37,716
He just started staying out...

527
00:59:41,627 --> 00:59:46,261
He just started staying out
all night long. -Oh my god.

528
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:57,927
Watch them rocks.

529
01:00:10,126 --> 01:00:11,608
Gimme your arm lest you fall.

530
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,919
You alright?

531
01:00:40,324 --> 01:00:41,794
You alright?

532
01:00:44,338 --> 01:00:45,832
Peaceful.

533
01:01:01,698 --> 01:01:03,246
I could swear I heard
my son calling me.

534
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,232
You probably heard the wind stirring
up those dead leaves over there.

535
01:01:10,154 --> 01:01:13,853
No, no. No I heard his
voice clear as day.

536
01:01:15,164 --> 01:01:20,496
Maybe, maybe i'd better get back,
maybe... maybe something's wrong.

537
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:28,145
And I told Babe brother, I told him...

538
01:01:28,891 --> 01:01:32,481
if Harry sets foot in this house one
more time then i'm taking Sunny...

539
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:36,304
and leaving, and just as I said that,
who do you think is coming up the steps?

540
01:01:36,741 --> 01:01:40,032
Harry, Harry and his
old resurrected friends.

541
01:01:41,308 --> 01:01:45,114
Is that how you got that black eye?
This was an accident.

542
01:01:47,642 --> 01:01:48,611
Sure.

543
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:53,636
It was, it was unintentional.

544
01:02:00,902 --> 01:02:01,964
How's he doing?

545
01:02:02,634 --> 01:02:05,709
As long as he keeps his throat
clear he's able to get some sleep.

546
01:02:06,881 --> 01:02:11,081
I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra
and I thought you needed a rest.

547
01:02:12,044 --> 01:02:15,664
I'll stand guard, Okra wants
to talk to you anyway.

548
01:02:35,806 --> 01:02:37,459
I brought you these greens...

549
01:02:39,316 --> 01:02:43,384
and some salt meat.
That is very thoughtful of you.

550
01:02:44,029 --> 01:02:46,551
I haven't had time to tend
my garden like I should.

551
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:52,299
Would you like some coffee.
I'd be much obliged.

552
01:03:04,234 --> 01:03:10,786
You know... Gideon and I
are blood brothers and...

553
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:16,694
it's always been the policy
to take care of the wives...

554
01:03:18,081 --> 01:03:20,613
you know, if something
happens to a brother.

555
01:03:21,235 --> 01:03:23,810
That's very sweet
of you Okra but...

556
01:03:25,462 --> 01:03:29,845
Gideon has taken care of everything
in case something happens to him.

557
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:38,052
He has a policy.
Well now if you become a widow...

558
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:45,199
you'll be needing someone around
to fix the butternuts and...

559
01:03:47,165 --> 01:03:50,648
we always like for the widow
to marry someone from the lodge.

560
01:03:51,534 --> 01:03:54,705
Now I know Gideon ain't gone yet...

561
01:03:55,712 --> 01:03:59,085
but there will be a lot of his old
friends coming round to get in line...

562
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:05,399
And I would like for you to sort of
consider this a conditional proposal...

563
01:04:07,092 --> 01:04:11,086
to be first in line,
so to speak.

564
01:04:18,207 --> 01:04:22,395
Excuse me, I have
to go feed my dog.

565
01:04:45,259 --> 01:04:48,834
Why doesn't he just park his
car and come in and apologise?

566
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:55,787
Hey brother.

567
01:04:57,414 --> 01:04:58,553
Hey brother.

568
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:06,296
Hey babe brother, roll
down the window man.

569
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:09,085
Roll down the window
and let me talk to you.

570
01:05:10,095 --> 01:05:12,593
Babe brother, hey babe brother.

571
01:05:18,198 --> 01:05:20,564

Roll down the... roll down
the window babe brother.

572
01:05:26,241 --> 01:05:27,114
Grow up.

573
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:30,771
Why don't you grow up?

574
01:05:32,096 --> 01:05:33,557
Sit there, stay in the car.

575
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:49,634
Harry always shows his good side and
like the moon, the other side is black.

576
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:53,981
Back home he always did try to
act like the coloured gentleman.

577
01:05:55,215 --> 01:05:57,351
I'm telling you Harry
is nothing but evil.

578
01:05:59,082 --> 01:06:03,315
I'm warning you, you can't keep a
wild animal as a pet around children.

579
01:06:21,174 --> 01:06:25,697
Before even sun sets, I would have
his belongings back on route 55.

580
01:06:26,773 --> 01:06:31,220
That old fox. -I can't accuse
him just trying on so.

581
01:06:33,011 --> 01:06:35,071
Everybody who have been
associated with Harry...

582
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,133
end up with pennies
over there eyes.

583
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:46,078
Hattie, what must I do?
If it was left up to me...

584
01:06:48,325 --> 01:06:49,572
i'd poison him.

585
01:07:03,176 --> 01:07:07,180
Just take a look at Gideon and ask
yourself 'when did it all start?'

586
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:13,619
How long has he been like this,
just take a look at the calender.

587
01:07:15,554 --> 01:07:17,553
Good afternoon ladies.
Good afternoon to you.

588
01:07:23,542 --> 01:07:24,550
Good afternoon.

589
01:07:34,847 --> 01:07:36,627
I'm gonna go take
a look at Gideon.

590
01:07:44,023 --> 01:07:49,016
As god is my witness, I have never
done anything to that woman.

591
01:07:49,717 --> 01:07:51,410
You must have done
something to her.

592
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:56,537
Since she has repented, all
she does is throw stones.

593
01:07:57,689 --> 01:07:59,361
Hattie is a different person now.

594
01:08:00,124 --> 01:08:02,852
I don't make any bones about where
I am going to spend eternity.

595
01:08:04,006 --> 01:08:06,192
I have always been wild
and you know that.

596
01:08:07,393 --> 01:08:13,358
When you're made to feel half a man,
what do you think the other half is?

597
01:08:15,365 --> 01:08:24,486
I'm glad... you brought that
up, just who you are. I...

598
01:08:31,514 --> 01:08:33,432
I have to know who is in my house.

599
01:08:36,867 --> 01:08:39,794
You invited me.
Yes I did.

600
01:08:43,965 --> 01:08:45,869
But only if you are a good man.

601
01:08:48,611 --> 01:08:52,758
A friend. Are you a friend Harry?

602
01:08:55,925 --> 01:08:59,669
Like that boy next door,
playing his horn...

603
01:09:03,289 --> 01:09:07,440
if he was a friend, he would
stop irritating people.

604
01:09:09,551 --> 01:09:15,233
But if he stops practising, he wouldn't
be perfect at what he does someday.

605
01:09:24,783 --> 01:09:26,111
I want you to leave.

606
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,877
Okra and MC and Herman
wanna go back home with me.

607
01:09:40,227 --> 01:09:46,856
MC is coming by to pick me up tonight,
i'll come back and get my things.

608
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:55,249
Well, I hope Gideon recovers. Oh...

609
01:09:57,449 --> 01:10:00,894
you know I got an extra
picture of one of my boys...

610
01:10:03,871 --> 01:10:07,833
i'd like for you to put those
baby pictures over your dresser.

611
01:10:11,347 --> 01:10:15,011
It's better than keeping it
in this... old wallet of mine.

612
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:21,861
With all these addresses and names of
people who are no longer on this earth.

613
01:10:26,412 --> 01:10:29,049
I'll say my so longs to
Gideon before I leave.

614
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:35,506
Suzie, I truly wish he gets well.

615
01:10:46,378 --> 01:10:48,092
These damn things are
unloaded aren't they?

616
01:10:52,754 --> 01:10:54,824
I don't wanna wear out welcome...

617
01:10:57,938 --> 01:11:01,453
but you can stay in someone's heart
longer than you can stay in their house.

618
01:11:03,669 --> 01:11:06,773
Come on and go with us boy.
We're gonna have a good time.

619
01:11:09,993 --> 01:11:11,789
It wouldn't be a bad time
for me to leave right?

620
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:16,560
I know your mind is on your wife...

621
01:11:18,914 --> 01:11:20,583
but you should never treat
a woman as an equal.

622
01:11:21,914 --> 01:11:24,462
You wanna get your wife
back, get another woman.

623
01:11:26,814 --> 01:11:34,232
MC, you ever heard of a real
man having one woman? -No lord.

624
01:11:35,644 --> 01:11:39,075
One woman puts you out, you have
to have another take you in.

625
01:11:39,983 --> 01:11:42,353
You don't drive around
without a spare tyre do you?

626
01:11:43,315 --> 01:11:46,860
The more mules you gets,
the easier to plough.

627
01:11:53,229 --> 01:11:54,601
Come home with us son.

628
01:11:56,469 --> 01:12:02,521
We'll show you some steaming hot
chuchos, steaming hot women.

629
01:12:15,493 --> 01:12:18,252
Who's old piece of knife is this?
Was my brother's.

630
01:12:29,566 --> 01:12:34,310
I have to go by the house first.
We'll wait for you as long as we can.

631
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,792
Babe brother.

632
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:16,922
Take off this wet jacket.

633
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:50,957
I need to get my suitcase out
of the garage. -What for?

634
01:13:53,892 --> 01:13:55,301
I'm going back home with Harry.

635
01:14:02,527 --> 01:14:04,494
I've heard some foolish
things in my life.

636
01:14:07,105 --> 01:14:09,861
He's coming to pick me up.
Well you have lost your mind.

637
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:16,181
Have you given any thought
to your wife? Your son?

638
01:14:17,558 --> 01:14:19,344
Not to mention your sick father?

639
01:14:20,562 --> 01:14:23,749
And I need your help to
move your daddy's bed...

640
01:14:24,228 --> 01:14:27,595
away from that leak in
that seal. -I'm busy.

641
01:14:28,204 --> 01:14:31,840
Babe brother, don't make me
raise my hand to you, alright...

642
01:14:34,183 --> 01:14:37,735
you have to see for yourself that you
are going in the wrong direction.

643
01:14:50,081 --> 01:14:52,196
Did you tell her to go move that
bed? Junior go help your mother.

644
01:14:53,184 --> 01:14:54,927
Now don't you get down
there, move out the way.

645
01:14:56,915 --> 01:14:57,929
Where's Babe brother?

646
01:15:12,867 --> 01:15:14,439
How come you didn't ask
Babe brother to help you?

647
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,451
He said he was too busy.

648
01:15:18,228 --> 01:15:19,588
So he is busy huh?

649
01:15:32,273 --> 01:15:37,367
Why in the hell didn't you help mom?
I told her I would she didn't return.

650
01:15:39,799 --> 01:15:43,481
I bet you if your master told you
to fix the hole in the roof...

651
01:15:44,217 --> 01:15:45,843
you would rebuild the
whole damn house.

652
01:15:47,972 --> 01:15:49,960
You always got the best
of it around here.

653
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,853
And whenever dad talks about
'my son' it's always you.

654
01:15:54,779 --> 01:16:01,062
So, you fix the roof.
That is a damn lie and you know it.

655
01:16:02,339 --> 01:16:04,417
Every time father asks
you to do something...

656
01:16:05,133 --> 01:16:07,828
you either half-ass do it
or you run off and hide.

657
01:16:08,813 --> 01:16:10,410
Momma told you to turn the
dirt in her garden and...

658
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:12,775
you told her with your
smartass self that...

659
01:16:12,995 --> 01:16:15,053
you weren't a father,
get Junior to do it.

660
01:16:15,682 --> 01:16:18,375
Every time anybody asks you to do
something you say tell Junior to do it.

661
01:16:20,389 --> 01:16:25,351
Boy, you ought to grow up.
I told you about calling me boy.

662
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:32,606
See, I ain't no boy. You and dad
got a bad habit of calling me boy.

663
01:16:33,429 --> 01:16:36,843
You call me boy in front of my wife,
you think i'm gonna fix the roof?

664
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,634
I hope the whole damn thing blows
off and it pours down with rain.

665
01:16:42,413 --> 01:16:45,681
I ought to break your damn neck.
Yeah, i'm leaving.

666
01:16:46,536 --> 01:16:48,375
Don't even call me when
the shoe falls coz...

667
01:16:48,576 --> 01:16:50,511
all he ever did for me
was try to run my life.

668
01:16:51,187 --> 01:16:53,289
I'm so sick of people
trying to run my life.

669
01:16:54,006 --> 01:16:56,672
Babe brother this, Babe
brother that. What's my name?

670
01:16:57,066 --> 01:17:00,847
You dumbass, it's Babe brother.
-My name is Sam, Samuel.

671
01:17:01,404 --> 01:17:02,480
Sit down.

672
01:17:25,411 --> 01:17:28,484
Alright now, stop it Junior.

673
01:17:29,059 --> 01:17:30,605
Please stop it,
look what you're doing.

674
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:34,559
Junior.

675
01:17:52,514 --> 01:17:56,415
Somebody get some lard. -I'll get it,
you gotta get him to the emergency room.

676
01:17:59,937 --> 01:18:00,997
Tamara.

677
01:18:08,974 --> 01:18:11,858
I'll take her to the hospital.
We'll take her to the hospital.

678
01:18:17,206 --> 01:18:18,119
Why don't you two grab a seat...

679
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:20,201
I'll get the doctor to see
you as soon as possible.

680
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:30,745
Do you need to see the doctor too?
No, just my mother.

681
01:19:16,981 --> 01:19:22,382
Excuse me, why is it so crowded?
Well it's Friday night.

682
01:19:25,033 --> 01:19:26,342
It is a full moon.

683
01:20:50,863 --> 01:20:52,846
I can't believe what
I heard happened.

684
01:21:16,383 --> 01:21:17,821
I just came to get my things.

685
01:22:07,525 --> 01:22:11,971
Babe, I think you ought to go
upstairs and see how your dad is.

686
01:22:14,683 --> 01:22:19,255
Wanna change your shirt.
Wash some of the blood off.

687
01:22:53,956 --> 01:22:55,765
How long is Harry
gonna hang around?

688
01:23:43,649 --> 01:23:44,398
What is it?

689
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:48,585
Harry?

690
01:23:57,481 --> 01:23:58,606
There's nothing we can do for him.

691
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:08,703
Aren't you gonna take him with you?

692
01:24:09,581 --> 01:24:12,357
If he would hae died in our care, we
would be required to take him...

693
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:15,916
but since we found him dead, you have
to wait for the county to pick him up.

694
01:24:16,294 --> 01:24:20,735
What? And how long will that take?
Depends on how busy they are, sorry.

695
01:24:36,002 --> 01:24:37,253
Hi Junior.
Miss Hattie.

696
01:24:39,422 --> 01:24:42,585
What happened? -He slipped on some
marbles that were on the floor...

697
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,182
heart gave out.

698
01:24:46,268 --> 01:24:50,156
Sunny, i've told you over
and over and over again...

699
01:24:50,529 --> 01:24:52,483
pick up the marbles when you
finished playing with them.

700
01:24:52,804 --> 01:24:56,808
Honey, don't just leave them anywhere.
Honey, the baby boy didn't mean it.

701
01:24:57,737 --> 01:24:59,178
Rhonda, take Sunny out for a walk.

702
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:05,164
Good job, you go to the store
and you buy whatever you want.

703
01:25:06,581 --> 01:25:09,205
Now if that ain't enough, you just
come on back to see Uncle Marsh.

704
01:25:12,956 --> 01:25:17,094
Come in.
Howdy son.

705
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:24,147
Where's the body?
In our kitchen.

706
01:25:33,506 --> 01:25:34,831
Anybody mind if I take a look at him?

707
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:40,135
I don't think Harry would like it.

708
01:25:47,436 --> 01:25:49,669
I've noticed how big his eyes were.

709
01:26:02,009 --> 01:26:04,204
Excuse me for cutting you
up but we pay taxes too...

710
01:26:04,204 --> 01:26:06,530
we shouldn't have to pay you
to take a 24 hour lunch break.

711
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,958
Coroner said he was out here already,
knocked on the door and nobody was here.

712
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:19,635
Hello, ye... yes i'm
calling about the body.

713
01:26:20,494 --> 01:26:23,877
Now, look he's been laying in
our kitchen for hours now.

714
01:26:25,162 --> 01:26:30,948
Yes I... yes I..., well when is
somebody gonna get out here?

715
01:26:40,275 --> 01:26:42,388
Ok, thankyou.

716
01:26:44,486 --> 01:26:46,943
He says he doesn't know when he's
gonna be out this way again.

717
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:49,418
You know somebody downtown
is gonna hear about this.

718
01:26:50,134 --> 01:26:52,027
There just delaying coz it's
the coloured neighbourhood.

719
01:26:52,447 --> 01:26:55,284
If he was white they'd have had
him on his feet and outta here.

720
01:26:56,321 --> 01:26:59,031
Gideon, oh my god.

721
01:27:03,979 --> 01:27:05,132
You having another party?

722
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:11,745
You better come sit down.
You are still sick.

723
01:27:13,839 --> 01:27:15,849
Girl, you talking to John Henry.

724
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:25,820
When was I sick?
You been out for almost 3 weeks.

725
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:29,299
We've had some long conversations
with the lord about you.

726
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:33,390
Didn't we sister Suzie? I said
we need him down here lord.

727
01:27:46,217 --> 01:27:49,910
Who's that?
It's our friend Harry.

728
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,683
Not our Harry?
I wish it wasn't.

729
01:27:54,855 --> 01:27:57,833
What happened to him?
He dropped dead.

730
01:27:58,616 --> 01:28:00,860
Hattie, you're so mean.

731
01:28:01,705 --> 01:28:04,463
How long has he been dead?
Since this morning.

732
01:28:07,381 --> 01:28:13,935
What happened to your hand?
I cut it, on an old rusty knife.

733
01:28:20,067 --> 01:28:23,075
I hope you take care of your
mother better after i'm gone.

734
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,731
Baby brother, is that
my shirt your wearing?

735
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:33,370
Yes. -Why don't you
have on my shoes?

736
01:28:36,084 --> 01:28:37,199
There too big.

737
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:47,565
What happened inside?
A man dropped dead.

738
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:48,941
You live next door don't you?

739
01:28:51,512 --> 01:28:53,129
I mean, I have more sense
than to give up everything.

740
01:28:54,267 --> 01:29:00,283
My family? You and Sunny?
No, that wasn't me.

741
01:29:01,264 --> 01:29:04,814
I'm sorry, i'm
sorry baby go ahead.

742
01:29:06,886 --> 01:29:11,031
It was like I was
swimming in muddy waters.

743
01:29:11,829 --> 01:29:13,048
You were swimming in muddy water.

744
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:18,876
I'm sorry, i'm sorry baby,
go ahead you were saying.

745
01:29:20,734 --> 01:29:23,265
Is like all the things
the old country people...

746
01:29:23,919 --> 01:29:26,869
when they try to tell you what
hell is like. -You were in hell?

747
01:29:28,678 --> 01:29:30,925
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.

748
01:29:33,374 --> 01:29:35,220
I couldn't beleive some of
the things I was doing.

749
01:29:36,946 --> 01:29:40,581
It was like there was an internal
struggle going on inside of me.

750
01:29:42,515 --> 01:29:46,995
Do you think you won?
It was nip and tuck.

751
01:29:50,462 --> 01:29:52,725
What lessons have you learned
from all this Babe brother?

752
01:29:55,153 --> 01:29:56,593
Sam. Samuel.

753
01:30:07,111 --> 01:30:08,668
To really care about you.

754
01:30:11,881 --> 01:30:14,651
I mean, you hung in there.

755
01:30:27,342 --> 01:30:29,101
When you boys gonna fix the roof?

756
01:30:30,053 --> 01:30:31,470
As soon as I rest up a bit.

757
01:30:34,153 --> 01:30:39,488
I mean, as soon as everything's
back to normal, anytime.

758
01:30:42,708 --> 01:30:49,754
Here I am thinking about myself, poor
old Harry resting on the kitchen floor.

759
01:31:02,358 --> 01:31:04,002
Did I ever tell you the
story of the man who...

760
01:31:04,254 --> 01:31:06,765
wanted to make up his own
mind about heaven and hell?

761
01:31:07,397 --> 01:31:09,651
Now he didn't want nobody's
opinion but his own.

762
01:31:11,896 --> 01:31:13,388
Now he gonna check out heaven first...

763
01:31:13,811 --> 01:31:16,711
taking him a round trip ticket
to heaven, when he get in heaven...

764
01:31:17,163 --> 01:31:20,537
he sees it's much like it is back
home, people working in the field...

765
01:31:21,807 --> 01:31:24,805
bodies all dripping
sweat, barely surviving. -Steven, Charles.

766
01:31:25,725 --> 01:31:29,203
He asks the man who was getting drinks
he said... -What if it's a girl?

767
01:31:29,452 --> 01:31:31,709
"I thought the streets of
heaven were paved with gold?"

768
01:31:32,482 --> 01:31:37,109
"They are but you'll never see them. You
got to work day and night in heaven...

769
01:31:37,876 --> 01:31:39,253
coz idleness is sinfulness.

770
01:31:40,965 --> 01:31:43,859
Well the man used the other half of
his ticket to take the express to hell.

771
01:31:44,772 --> 01:31:49,009
He get there, he see everybody
all stretched out, kicked back...

772
01:31:49,525 --> 01:31:53,517
"what you all doing?" he said,
they all hollered back "Sitting".

773
01:31:55,689 --> 01:31:57,416
Well, he sees the devil walking round...

774
01:31:57,697 --> 01:32:00,682
I don't want to hear any joke about
coloured people being in hell.

775
01:32:01,627 --> 01:32:04,328
No no no, i'm almost finished,
i'm coming to the punchline.

776
01:32:04,907 --> 01:32:09,759
Now the preacher...-I don't want to
hear any tales about coloured people.

777
01:32:10,336 --> 01:32:15,316
White people. Anybody.
Now the punchline is...

778
01:32:15,627 --> 01:32:21,419
Gideon, I don't care to hear any
jokes about people being in hell.

779
01:32:23,426 --> 01:32:28,700
This hand reminds me that
it is nothing to laugh at.

780
01:32:31,336 --> 01:32:32,679
It's only a tale.

781
01:32:56,329 --> 01:32:58,953
Was that an earthquake?
It was something.

782
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,622
I'm cold, I need to
get out in the sunlight.

783
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,770
Hey kids.
Hi.

784
01:33:19,949 --> 01:33:22,862
Hey boy, you still got that
dead man in you house?

785
01:33:24,110 --> 01:33:27,249
Hello everybody.
Reginia.

786
01:33:28,776 --> 01:33:31,200
I know you haven't had a
chance to cook or do anything...

787
01:33:31,608 --> 01:33:33,385
with that dead man
in your kitchen.

788
01:33:34,533 --> 01:33:36,532
Well, some of your neighbours
have got together and we...

789
01:33:36,764 --> 01:33:38,795
set up a picnic table in
my back yard and we got

790
01:33:38,795 --> 01:33:43,123
food and everything for all
of you. -That's a great idea.

791
01:33:45,038 --> 01:33:47,277
The day wagon come,
we'll leave a note...

792
01:33:47,490 --> 01:33:49,081
and tell 'em we'll be down
the street at a picnic.
