01:00:06,068 --> 01:00:07,379
Wait.

358
01:00:09,413 --> 01:00:13,965
Do you hear that?
Do you know what that is?

359
01:00:13,965 --> 01:00:17,896
Mortal terror Edgar,
that's what that sound is.

360
01:00:18,413 --> 01:00:24,758
Not from pain or grief but from
the very bottom of his soul.

361
01:00:27,068 --> 01:00:29,310
He knows he's going to die-

362
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:35,206
just as you know,
why you're going to kill him.

363
01:00:38,413 --> 01:00:40,931
I don't know why!

364
01:00:40,965 --> 01:00:45,068
Oh, come off it Edgar! You've
already made up your mind.

365
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:50,206
How does he make you feel when
he looks at you?

366
01:00:52,241 --> 01:00:57,103
When he stares down
your anguish, your affliction?

367
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:01,620
[Crying]
He mocks me!

368
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:07,965
Keep telling yourself that!

369
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:11,793
It's the eye,Edgar!
You know it's the eye!

370
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,862
It's always been the eye!

371
01:01:38,827 --> 01:01:44,827
What is this? Is it my time?
No, no it can't be you!

[Laughing] Well what have
you got to say now?!

378
01:02:47,068 --> 01:02:49,206
That's what I figured...

379
01:03:05,275 --> 01:03:07,482
JONATHAN VO:
Now what are you going to do?

380
01:03:07,482 --> 01:03:09,310
Shut up!

[Heavy breathing/struggling]

382
01:03:51,827 --> 01:03:53,482
Just because no one saw this,

383
01:03:53,482 --> 01:03:55,448
doesn't make it a perfect crime,
Edgar.

384
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:57,620
Stay out of this!

385
01:04:02,862 --> 01:04:05,034
What are you going to do
with the body?

386
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:07,827
I don't know, I don't know!

[Heavy breathing/struggling]

395
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:15,517
I wouldn't do it here.

396
01:07:15,517 --> 01:07:16,413
No...

397
01:07:16,413 --> 01:07:17,896
They'll figure it out.

398
01:07:18,379 --> 01:07:21,206
They always figure it out.

399
01:07:21,241 --> 01:07:22,586
You can't be here.

400
01:07:22,586 --> 01:07:24,551
You're not here!
Only in my mind!

401
01:07:24,862 --> 01:07:26,034
Say what you will,

402
01:07:26,034 --> 01:07:29,620
though it seems like we've gone
pretty far already..

403
01:07:29,758 --> 01:07:32,206
what's a little more
crazy gonna hurt?

404
01:07:32,206 --> 01:07:35,034
Yeah? If you're so smart,
what would you do with him?!

405
01:07:35,034 --> 01:07:36,206
Keep it clean.

406
01:07:36,448 --> 01:07:38,862
And you should probably forget what
I said about the chainsaw.

407
01:07:39,724 --> 01:07:43,034
The fun part's about  
notgetting caught.

408
01:07:43,034 --> 01:07:44,931
The fun part?

409
01:07:45,551 --> 01:07:48,413
Go to hell!
This isn't fun, it's...

410
01:07:51,448 --> 01:07:53,517
It's what, Edgar?

411
01:07:54,758 --> 01:07:57,379
It's necessary.

412
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,448
If you thought there was
no going back before, Edgar,

413
01:08:29,793 --> 01:08:31,448
Well then...

414
01:08:31,655 --> 01:08:33,931
I think you know that,
as well as I do.

424
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:46,965
A-absolutely,
just one moment officer!

425
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:51,862
Let's keep this quick I-
[sneeze]

426
01:12:51,862 --> 01:12:53,655
Say no more.

427
01:13:10,551 --> 01:13:12,862
Hello Officers,
how can I help you?

428
01:13:12,896 --> 01:13:15,034
Are you Mister Nelson, sir?

429
01:13:15,034 --> 01:13:17,896
Me? No. I, I- I'm a good friend
of his.

430
01:13:17,896 --> 01:13:19,931
Well, I was called 
out here by him, in fact...

431
01:13:20,103 --> 01:13:23,689
although he's no
longer here I'm afraid.

432
01:13:24,068 --> 01:13:25,586
I see.

433
01:13:25,586 --> 01:13:28,034
And, who may you be, sir?

434
01:13:28,068 --> 01:13:30,379
Me? My name is Edgar.

435
01:13:30,379 --> 01:13:32,689
Well, Edgar, I assume
that's your vehicle out

436
01:13:32,689 --> 01:13:33,655
there in the ditch.

437
01:13:34,206 --> 01:13:38,034
Yeah, that's right,
it's a bit slippery out.

438
01:13:38,034 --> 01:13:40,689
Sir, I'm Officer Mellish,
this is my partner,

439
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:42,034
Officer Starkwell.

440
01:13:42,034 --> 01:13:45,000
We have two questions:
why are you here,

441
01:13:45,172 --> 01:13:46,586
and where is Mister Nelson?

442
01:13:47,586 --> 01:13:51,344
I was called out here, Officer,
as I've said.

443
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:54,172
But when I got
here, Nelson no longer was.

444
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,724
I'm not sure
where he's gone.

445
01:13:56,758 --> 01:13:59,448
And why were
you called out here?

446
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,413
From the way that Nelson
spoke to me over the phone,

447
01:14:02,413 --> 01:14:04,103
I felt he was in danger.

448
01:14:04,586 --> 01:14:06,103
Is that so?

449
01:14:06,172 --> 01:14:08,758
Well, It's not like him
Officer to,

450
01:14:08,862 --> 01:14:10,758
to sound so
fearful over the phone.

451
01:14:11,137 --> 01:14:13,655
Being that I've watched over
him over the years

452
01:14:13,655 --> 01:14:15,620
I felt it
necessary to come right out.

453
01:14:16,482 --> 01:14:20,448
Unfortunately Nelson seems
to have gone off by himself.

454
01:14:20,448 --> 01:14:22,586
Or not by himself.

455
01:14:23,206 --> 01:14:28,241
Frankly Officers, he's not been
in his right mind since his son

456
01:14:28,241 --> 01:14:30,034
passed away a short time ago.

457
01:14:31,482 --> 01:14:34,551
Well, you don't think
he's in trouble do you?

458
01:14:34,551 --> 01:14:35,482
Is that why you're here?

459
01:14:37,344 --> 01:14:39,482
Mind if we come in, Edgar?

460
01:14:39,655 --> 01:14:42,413
No... no, no not at all.

461
01:15:07,344 --> 01:15:09,517
I don't mind telling you Edgar
that we were called out for

462
01:15:09,517 --> 01:15:10,724
the exact same reason.

463
01:15:11,517 --> 01:15:15,172
Oh, is that so?
Can I ask by whom?

464
01:15:15,172 --> 01:15:16,172
Anonymous.

465
01:15:16,379 --> 01:15:19,137
Although, not surprisingly,
they shared your concerns.

466
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:22,827
Does Mr. Nelson drive?

467
01:15:22,827 --> 01:15:25,413
No, he has a service, sir.

468
01:15:25,758 --> 01:15:29,068
Well, we'll have to call to see
if he was in fact picked up.

469
01:15:29,103 --> 01:15:33,827
Oh dear, you don't think he
walked off by himself, do you?

470
01:15:33,827 --> 01:15:35,241
Is that impossible?

471
01:15:35,758 --> 01:15:38,206
We can't afford to rule anything out
now, can we Edgar?

472
01:15:38,344 --> 01:15:40,655
No, no we certainly can't,
Officer.

473
01:15:40,655 --> 01:15:43,310
[Piano key strikes]

474
01:15:44,344 --> 01:15:48,000
And how exactly do you know
Mr. Nelson, Edgar?

475
01:15:48,172 --> 01:15:53,206
Well, I've served him for years
at the bank in town-

476
01:15:53,206 --> 01:15:54,862
we've become quite close!

477
01:15:55,344 --> 01:15:59,482
I've looked in on him here
and there as he's gotten on

478
01:15:59,482 --> 01:16:01,344
in years- his needs-

479
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:07,896
well, he needs some help some-
times and, what with his son...

480
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:10,758
well, I don't need to tell
you his,

481
01:16:10,931 --> 01:16:12,862
well, his mind
wanders a bit and,

482
01:16:13,586 --> 01:16:17,931
so if he's taken to up
and walking off by himself...

483
01:16:17,931 --> 01:16:21,793
it seems more possible
the more I think about it.

484
01:16:21,793 --> 01:16:26,896
Uh huh. You wouldn't mind if we
took a look around would you-

485
01:16:27,655 --> 01:16:30,413
That sounds like
a bad cold, Officer?

486
01:16:30,413 --> 01:16:32,275
Ah, it's nothing, really.

487
01:16:32,275 --> 01:16:33,965
Let me make you gentlemen

488
01:16:33,965 --> 01:16:36,206
a hot pot of tea while you
look around!

489
01:16:36,275 --> 01:16:38,620
That won't be necessar-
[sneeze]

490
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:41,793
Ah, no no no,
it's no problem at all.

491
01:16:51,896 --> 01:16:54,931
There's definitely
something going on here.

492
01:16:54,931 --> 01:16:57,310
You don't think he's going
to try and run, do you?

493
01:16:57,310 --> 01:17:00,758
Nah, he thinks his explanations
are working for him.

494
01:17:00,758 --> 01:17:05,517
Let's see if we can get him
to crack. I'll look upstairs.

495
01:17:09,689 --> 01:17:13,241

STARKWELL VO:
Everything all right in there?

499
01:17:45,068 --> 01:17:48,862
Uh, uh everything's fine Officer,
your tea will be ready shortly.

500
01:17:48,862 --> 01:17:52,275
They're toying with you.
They're not idiots.

501
01:17:52,758 --> 01:17:54,275
You made too many mistakes.

502
01:17:54,275 --> 01:17:56,034
Shut up!

503
01:17:56,034 --> 01:18:00,000
"He called me, we're such
good friends!" What bullshit.

504
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,586
You don't know anything.
What can they possibly do, huh?

505
01:18:03,586 --> 01:18:07,758
Nelson's nowhere to be found,
there's no sign of a struggle,

506
01:18:07,758 --> 01:18:11,034
no sign of any wrongdoing at
all, he's simply gone!

507
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:14,551
They're Officers, Edgar,
they'll search the house.

508
01:18:14,551 --> 01:18:17,344
They've already seen the broken
frame to the front door.

509
01:18:17,724 --> 01:18:19,689
Christ, Edgar, 
they'll search the barn!

510
01:18:19,689 --> 01:18:21,344
And find what?

511
01:18:21,517 --> 01:18:24,310
There's nothing they can
find there I can't simply deny!

512
01:18:24,689 --> 01:18:26,758
Nothing? Just wait a week.

513
01:18:26,896 --> 01:18:30,586
I'm sure the house will be rather
pungent. Try denying that.

514
01:18:30,724 --> 01:18:32,241
Doesn't matter!

515
01:18:32,413 --> 01:18:35,620
As soon as they're satisfied
here tonight, I'm leaving.

516
01:18:35,724 --> 01:18:38,931
Edgar, what about Caroline
back there in the trunk?

517
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:42,586
CAROLINE OC:
Heeeeeelp! Get me out of here!

518
01:18:42,586 --> 01:18:44,379
You don't just shove someone
in a trunk

519
01:18:44,379 --> 01:18:46,275
and think they're
going to keep their mouth shut.

520
01:18:46,379 --> 01:18:48,379
You think she's
going to lie for you?

521
01:18:48,379 --> 01:18:50,551
CAROLINE OC:
Heeeeeelp! I'm in a trunk!

522
01:18:50,551 --> 01:18:52,275
It doesn't matter!

523
01:18:52,413 --> 01:18:55,655

Come here and take a
close look at this, Edgar.

528
01:19:29,172 --> 01:19:30,620
What do you make of it?

529
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:39,103
Huh. It looks as if the wood
has broken off around the latch.

530
01:19:39,965 --> 01:19:43,310
Worn out, maybe.
Over time, do you think?

531
01:19:45,896 --> 01:19:48,068
No, Edgar, I don't
think that at all.

532
01:19:50,758 --> 01:19:52,448
Ah, thank you.

533
01:19:52,689 --> 01:19:55,586
I could use this-
late nights, you know?

534
01:20:00,517 --> 01:20:02,655
[Sips] Mmm, it's good.

535
01:20:25,103 --> 01:20:29,241
[Sips] Ah...

536
01:20:51,344 --> 01:20:55,241
Can I ask what you're
looking for, exactly?

537
01:20:56,689 --> 01:20:59,137
Oh, anything suspicious, Edgar.

538
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:05,034
Anything that might show us why
an old man- seventies? Eighties?

539
01:21:05,344 --> 01:21:07,862
Uh, seventy-one this week,
in fact.

540
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:11,724
Why such a man of his age
might up and disappear late

541
01:21:11,724 --> 01:21:14,482
at night- early in the
morning, as it were.

542
01:21:14,655 --> 01:21:17,482
It's a bit strange, I'd say.

543
01:21:17,827 --> 01:21:20,482
Speaking of, what did he say?

544
01:21:20,517 --> 01:21:22,379
What did he say?

545
01:21:22,379 --> 01:21:24,551
On the phone.
He called you, remember?

546
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:27,655
[Laughs] Oh, yes! Of course...

547
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:31,724
I'm, I'm trying to recall,
there was nothing much to it, really-

548
01:21:31,965 --> 01:21:33,724
it was extremely brief.

549
01:21:34,241 --> 01:21:37,620
Fear, mostly, in his voice.

550
01:21:38,172 --> 01:21:41,448
Asked me my name a few times,
asked if I was alright?

551
01:21:41,862 --> 01:21:43,827
He asked if youwere alright?

552
01:21:44,172 --> 01:21:47,000
Yes! Strange, I thought
because I'm,

553
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,620
I'm just fine.
Just, completely fine.

554
01:21:50,827 --> 01:21:53,000
Are we sure of that, Edgar?

555
01:21:53,689 --> 01:21:55,137
JONATHAN VO:
Look out Edgar!

556
01:21:55,137 --> 01:21:56,862
All he's thinking about
is clubbing you across the

557
01:21:56,862 --> 01:21:59,034
back of the knee and placing
his foot over your throat!

558
01:21:59,034 --> 01:22:03,241
Well! I, I should
go get Officer, uh...

559
01:22:03,241 --> 01:22:04,758
Mellish.

560
01:22:04,793 --> 01:22:07,896
Mellishhis, his hot tea.

561
01:22:21,896 --> 01:22:23,965
So. Who do you think
called them, Edgar?

562
01:22:23,965 --> 01:22:26,586
[Quietly] No one!
Stop bothering me!

563
01:22:26,586 --> 01:22:29,413
Let's see, your boss Mr. Singer,

564
01:22:29,482 --> 01:22:33,206
he was spot on, wasn't he?
What's the word he used...

565
01:22:33,275 --> 01:22:34,896
SINGER:
It won't be anything unsavory...

566
01:22:34,896 --> 01:22:37,793
Oh yeah, unsavory,

567
01:22:37,965 --> 01:22:39,931
that's certainly a 
fine way of putting it.

568
01:22:39,965 --> 01:22:42,620
He's an idiot. Totally inept!

569
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:45,862
You know, Edgar, you haven't
quite been yourself lately.

570
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:50,310
Mr. Singer's noticed,
Caroline's noticed...

571
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:51,275
Impossible...

572
01:22:51,586 --> 01:22:54,241
And Lenore, well,
she's defitely noticed.

573
01:22:54,241 --> 01:22:57,724
How dare you! I'm not
some maniac loose in the

574
01:22:57,724 --> 01:23:01,103
night, some deranged
psychotic waiting to strike

575
01:23:01,103 --> 01:23:02,482
at anyone near him!

576
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:06,482
My wife, scared to be
near me... preposterous!

577
01:23:06,517 --> 01:23:10,931
Of course, and yet,
here we are, Edgar

578
01:23:21,379 --> 01:23:23,034
[Knocks on door]

579
01:23:23,034 --> 01:23:25,724
Oh. Come on in Edgar.

580
01:23:25,724 --> 01:23:28,103
You don't think the
old man would mind if

581
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:29,379
I sit on the bed, do you?

582
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:31,517
I brought you some tea, Officer.

583
01:23:31,517 --> 01:23:33,793
Yes, yes that's right...

584
01:23:39,827 --> 01:23:42,793
Mm, good. Just what I needed.

585
01:23:42,793 --> 01:23:44,310
Glad I can be of help.

586
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:47,620
We appreciate it Edgar,
we really do.

587
01:23:48,517 --> 01:23:51,000
Have to be quite a view out here
in the daytime.

588
01:23:52,655 --> 01:23:55,379
Nothing but
fields and trees, for miles it

589
01:23:55,379 --> 01:23:57,310
seemed on our drive out here.

590
01:23:58,965 --> 01:24:04,448
Yep, all out here alone.
Not a soul around.

591
01:24:05,103 --> 01:24:09,413
‘Course, can't see much of that
at this time of the morning.

592
01:24:09,896 --> 01:24:11,344
Shame, really...

593
01:24:11,862 --> 01:24:14,000
hardly believe we could find
a witness to the crime.

594
01:24:15,068 --> 01:24:17,862
What crime would
that be, Officer?

595
01:24:18,551 --> 01:24:20,517
Just speculating Edgar, 
that's all.

596
01:24:20,965 --> 01:24:23,206
You see I can't help but
think of the worst possible

597
01:24:23,206 --> 01:24:25,206
thing that could happen to
poor old Mr. Nelson.

598
01:24:25,965 --> 01:24:30,241
Then I work backwards.
Because that helps, Edgar.

599
01:24:30,758 --> 01:24:33,586
Helps me get in the
correct state of mind.

600
01:24:34,206 --> 01:24:35,931
Helps me think like they do.

601
01:24:36,586 --> 01:24:39,172
The supposed criminal
or criminals, that is.

602
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:40,655
I see.

603
01:24:42,586 --> 01:24:47,241
Then again, maybe the poor
old bastard just wandered off.

604
01:24:47,551 --> 01:24:48,896
Who knows, anyway.

605
01:24:50,206 --> 01:24:54,379
Well I, I I guess I
wouldn't put it past him.

606
01:24:54,379 --> 01:24:57,206
Has it ever occurred to
you to just shut up?

607
01:24:57,206 --> 01:24:59,517
[Quietly] Has it ever
occurred to you?!

608
01:25:00,551 --> 01:25:02,551
Of course I've considered
it,

609
01:25:03,068 --> 01:25:05,379
it's just that it doesn't
seem so likely.

610
01:25:06,689 --> 01:25:09,517
Why don't you join us
downstairs before we go, Edgar?

611
01:25:09,517 --> 01:25:10,965
Just a few more questions.

612
01:25:24,275 --> 01:25:29,448
I scoured it, I got nothing down
here. What about upstairs?

613
01:25:30,275 --> 01:25:33,620
No apparent signs of a struggle,
the old man's bed looks recently

614
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:41,034
slept in, the closet's a mess...
other than that...

615
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,931
[Loud sigh]

616
01:26:22,034 --> 01:26:25,137
Edgar, are you certain that
he called you from here?

617
01:26:25,586 --> 01:26:29,862
Well, [clears throat] no,
I suppose I'm not.

618
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:36,655
Uh, I prefer to stand, thanks.

619
01:26:40,827 --> 01:26:43,655
Can I ask you
Officers a question?

620
01:26:43,655 --> 01:26:45,482
Of course Edgar.

621
01:26:47,344 --> 01:26:49,862
Am I suspected of something?

622
01:26:49,896 --> 01:26:52,689
[Laughs] Absolutely, Edgar.

623
01:26:52,724 --> 01:26:54,379
Did you think otherwise?

624
01:26:54,413 --> 01:26:57,827
[Laughs] Can I ask
what you base that on?

625
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:00,206
You can simply ask us,
Edgar.

626
01:27:00,206 --> 01:27:02,448
You don't have
to ask if you can ask us.

627
01:27:08,103 --> 01:27:12,137
It is a bit peculiar,
wouldn't you say, Edgar?

628
01:27:12,137 --> 01:27:15,275
That you're the only one here.

629
01:27:15,655 --> 01:27:19,931
You are the only one here,
in a house that isn't yours.

630
01:27:25,068 --> 01:27:27,551
You've come a long way Edgar.

631
01:27:27,551 --> 01:27:30,620
[Laughs]

632
01:27:32,931 --> 01:27:35,758
Since you journeyed
into a barn.

633
01:27:38,068 --> 01:27:41,931
I uh... [clears throat]
I think I'd like to have a

634
01:27:41,931 --> 01:27:44,965
lawyer present if uh, you
Officers are going to ask

635
01:27:44,965 --> 01:27:46,551
any more questions.

636
01:27:48,241 --> 01:27:50,586
[Laughs]

637
01:27:50,586 --> 01:27:52,758
JONATHAN VO:
A helpless father.

638
01:27:52,758 --> 01:27:54,758
Now Edgar, you're
really not in a position to

639
01:27:54,758 --> 01:27:56,448
request something like that.

640
01:27:58,275 --> 01:28:00,448
JONATHAN VO:
...without a daughter.

641
01:28:01,137 --> 01:28:06,448
Edgar, we could take you in
on this alone if we so wished.

642
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:08,655
Is that what both of
you want?

643
01:28:08,655 --> 01:28:10,965
Is that where
this has been going?

644
01:28:11,551 --> 01:28:16,448
And you somehow
managed, to take your part

645
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:22,517
in all this madness. As if
there was no other way, really.

646
01:28:22,517 --> 01:28:27,034
Honestly? No, Edgar. We don't
take any pleasure in simply

647
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:32,275
arresting suspects. Because then
you have to witness the denials,

648
01:28:32,275 --> 01:28:33,827
the lies and all that...

649
01:28:33,862 --> 01:28:34,965
Paperwork.

650
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,827
Oh God, yes!
The bloody paperwork.

651
01:28:37,827 --> 01:28:40,517
And everyone played their role
so perfectly.

652
01:28:40,793 --> 01:28:44,413
A carefully
orchestrated three-act play.

653
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:47,517
[Low heartbeat]

654
01:28:47,517 --> 01:28:52,310
And you know, Edgar, I can't
wait to see how it all ends.

655
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:56,000
[Steady heartbeat]

656
01:29:00,137 --> 01:29:03,517
[Quietly] Stop talking to me!

657
01:29:03,517 --> 01:29:05,103
I'm sorry?

658
01:29:05,275 --> 01:29:06,689
Edgar?

659
01:29:06,862 --> 01:29:08,862
Edgar, now is not
the time to go silent.

660
01:29:08,862 --> 01:29:10,275
We know something about you.

661
01:29:10,275 --> 01:29:13,862
We know just why you
might be here this evening.

662
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:16,620
Revenge is a tricky thing,
Edgar.

663
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:19,586
No one keeps their
hands clean for too long.

664
01:29:20,551 --> 01:29:23,551
What would your
daughter say about all this?

665
01:29:25,689 --> 01:29:28,034
[Screams]

666
01:29:28,034 --> 01:29:29,241
Hey, easy Edgar.

667
01:29:29,275 --> 01:29:30,413
Edgar...

668
01:29:30,896 --> 01:29:37,034
Ah... that sound again...
pounding! Hammering away!

669
01:29:37,586 --> 01:29:39,241
Tearing my brain apart!

670
01:29:39,379 --> 01:29:41,034
Edgar, restrain yourself!

671
01:29:41,068 --> 01:29:42,103
Edgar, calm yourself!

672
01:29:42,103 --> 01:29:44,620
You're just making this
situation much worse!

673
01:29:44,724 --> 01:29:47,862
Don't you hear it?! That
hideous sound?! Pounding!

674
01:29:47,862 --> 01:29:51,344
Thumping the thoughts from
my brain! I can't take it!

675
01:29:51,758 --> 01:29:53,586
[Laughs/cries] No!

676
01:29:53,586 --> 01:29:56,241
He's losing his mind!

677
01:29:56,241 --> 01:29:59,517
Calm yourself Edgar! Stop
what you're doing right now!

678
01:29:59,517 --> 01:30:02,068
You're- you're villains!

679
01:30:03,034 --> 01:30:07,517
Here! Here!
I'll tear the boards away!

680
01:30:08,965 --> 01:30:14,206
I admit it! I admit everything!
Just make it stop!

681
01:30:14,448 --> 01:30:16,586
Please make it stop!

682
01:30:16,724 --> 01:30:18,517
Make what stop?!

683
01:30:22,172 --> 01:30:25,862
[Loud heartbeat]

684
01:30:33,689 --> 01:30:35,034
Oh my God...

685
01:30:35,068 --> 01:30:38,551
Jesus!
He's hacked him to pieces!

686
01:30:38,551 --> 01:30:41,413
[Laughs/cries]

687
01:30:43,241 --> 01:30:46,068
No! You hear it! That sound!

688
01:30:46,689 --> 01:30:49,379
It's the beating of his
hideous heart!

689
01:30:50,758 --> 01:30:56,034
[Laughs/cries]

690
01:31:04,931 --> 01:31:09,827
[Steady heartbeat]

691
01:32:43,896 --> 01:32:46,724
[Heartbeat]
