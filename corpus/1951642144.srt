1
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,460
Cease fire!
Cease fire! Heads up!

2
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,780
Man down! Cease fire!

3
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,900
Stupid motherfucker!

4
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,380
<i>Sí.</i>

5
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,020
What's up, Sylvia?

6
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,660
Cute little outfit.

7
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,220
You look nice.

8
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,180
Mike's in
the bedroom.

9
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,180
Yeah?

10
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,900
Man, I said
you look nice.

11
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,580
I have a court
appearance, Jim.

12
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,620
Well, you just
give 'em hell.

13
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,740
Hey.

14
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,740
Spiffy duds, huh?

15
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,900
You look like
a gift-wrapped turd.

16
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,660
Now please leave me alone.
I have to concentrate.

17
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,420
I have two filings
and a deposition today.

18
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,020
Play nice, kids.

19
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,940
What up, dog?

20
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,900
- Nothing. Just got back.
- Cool. Cool.

21
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,380
How was Mexico, dog?

22
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,660
Oh, it was a dream, man.

23
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,660
- Loving my woman.
- Right.

24
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,300
That's it.
I'm out of here.

25
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,020
Those are copies
of your resumé.

26
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,100
Pass them out like candy.

27
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,460
'Cause I can always
print up more.

28
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,180
And just call me
if anything happens, okay?

29
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,900
And no drinking.

30
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,340
Come on, baby, be cool.

31
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,540
Honey, I'm serious.

32
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,580
No drinking. Okay?

33
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,820
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

34
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,820
Good luck.

35
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,980
Your suit's fine, okay?

36
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,300
Dude, she called me
a gift-wrapped turd.

37
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,820
Don't be fucking
with her, dude.

38
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,540
She's pissed.

39
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,020
Why is she on
the warpath? Dog...

40
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,980
I didn't look for work
yesterday, dude.

41
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,660
Sold some of her CDs,
bought a couple of 40s

42
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,420
and a pack of GPCs.

43
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,580
Caught a buzz
and watched

44
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,500
my Chicago Vs. Lakers tapes.

45
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:38,620
That's on you, homie.

46
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,780
We didn't even
hang yesterday.

47
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,260
I was out of the country.

48
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,180
So? My old lady still
thinks it's your fault.

49
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,380
Huh? Huh? Hmm?

50
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,300
Come on, dude, let's get
the fuck out of here

51
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,460
and find my ass
some employment.

52
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,820
It's cool you driving me around?

53
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,340
Yeah, dude, it's cool.
It's no trouble.

54
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,980
<i>Here, asshole.</i>

55
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,260
Breakfast.

56
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,020
Oh... ho, ho...

57
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,820
Dog.

58
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,700
No <i>pisto</i> for me, dude.

59
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,820
Today's a no-pounding day.
You heard the woman.

60
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,540
Good. More for me.

61
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,900
Fuck it.

62
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,580
<i>Salud.</i>
<i>Salud.</i>

63
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,580
Man, hope they put me in
the next class or I'm fucked.

64
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,300
I can't pay my rent.

65
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,180
Landlady's about to pull
a gauge on my ass.

66
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,620
What happened to all that money
you saved in the army, dude?

67
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,420
The tax-free shit?

68
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,100
Man, bro, this fucking
ride cleaned me out.

69
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,780
I guess we drank
up the rest.

70
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,420
Dumb ass.

71
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,420
Cops better start
paying you, dude.

72
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,860
You spend enough
fucking time with them.

73
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,180
They better start kicking me
down some paychecks, man.

74
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,300
They got me hopping through
hoops, you know?

75
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,540
"Come in for a test."
"Come back in two weeks."

76
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,260
Another test, another two weeks.

77
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,740
Fuck.

78
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,740
Shit gets real,

79
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,020
you be hating life.

80
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,980
Party time will be over.

81
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,620
Dude, you don't know how much

82
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,580
I'm looking forward
to this shit.

83
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,860
You know, I'll be super recruit.

84
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,660
I was jumping
out of choppers

85
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,860
in the mountains,
taking down

86
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,740
hard motherfuckers,
you know?

87
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,420
I'll be laughing my way through
LAPD's reindeer games.

88
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,060
Shit, they're
gonna love me.

89
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,300
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna
fucking love them, dude.

90
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,300
Ah, fuck you.

91
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,620
I'm going to love my old lady.

92
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,340
I'm gonna marry homegirl.

93
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,900
Import her ass.

94
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,380
Oh, come on, man.

95
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,780
Dude, what happened
to all the honeys

96
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,540
we were gonna pimp
with your badge, dog?

97
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,500
You're fucking up the plan.

98
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,820
I've been thinking, you know?

99
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,980
Love's about sacrifice.

100
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,900
Only true measure of it.

101
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,380
What would you do for Sylvia?

102
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,900
Get a job.

103
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,740
- Mm...
- Nine to fucking five.

104
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,500
Yeah.

105
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,980
That's love.

106
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,340
Hey.

107
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,060
Good morning.

108
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,300
So when do you officially

109
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,940
hand your ass over to the Man?

110
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,700
"Mr. Jim Davis,
we regret to inform...

111
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,940
I had two beers, right?

112
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,300
Yeah.

113
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,580
Going fucking
blind or something.

114
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,540
Okay, this letter
says, quoting...

115
00:10:23,575 --> 00:10:28,620
"no longer eligible
as a police officer candidate."

116
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,100
What the fuck does that mean?

117
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,020
Come on, dude.

118
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,580
"no longer eligible"? I mean,
what does that sound like?

119
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,780
They pulled the plug, dude.

120
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,700
No, no...

121
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,220
Why?

122
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,420
Oh, man, I'll bet you...

123
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,420
I'll bet you it's
'cause I'm white.

124
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,500
I bet it's 'cause
you're a dick.

125
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,180
No, no, no, Mike,
you don't understand.

126
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,980
I am fucked.

127
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,860
I got to get married.

128
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,740
Okay? INS won't let me
bring Marta across

129
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,100
unless I got employment.

130
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,140
I promised her.

131
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,900
This fucks up my plan.

132
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,140
This is fucking bullshit, okay?

133
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,500
This... these fucking
assholes...

134
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,740
These fucking assholes!

135
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,300
What the fuck
is their problem, man?!

136
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,220
This is fucking typical
cop hate game bullshit!

137
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,020
Yo, yo, fucking
chill, Magilla Gorilla.

138
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,380
I mean you're trippin', dude.

139
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,460
Hey, what the fuck

140
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,620
are you looking at, asshole?!

141
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,260
Fucking dick.

142
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,260
Yo, yo,

143
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:28,260
Jim, Jim...

144
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,540
I'm gonna fucking kick your
teeth down your puke hole!

145
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,940
You fucking want some?

146
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,060
Jim, Jim, dude.

147
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,260
Kick back, dude.

148
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,820
The fucking light is green.
Get the fuck in the car.

149
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,100
Man, fuck.
- You're going to catch

150
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,220
a case doing that shit, man.

151
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,420
What the fuck were you doing?

152
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,180
Fuck the LAPD, man.

153
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,140
What's up with Pasadena,
Pomona, Santa Ana and all that?

154
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,980
Oh, no, fuck the sticks.

155
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,860
L.A. City's the shit.

156
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,500
Hey, Sheriff's Department.

157
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,020
It's good enough for the INS
and still basically L.A., right?

158
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,100
Yeah, Sheriff's Department,
yeah.

159
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,260
They make you work
the jails the first two years

160
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,300
or something.

161
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,620
I could be cracking heads

162
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,380
up at the Honor Ranch.

163
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,580
I'll give 'em a call,
start testing.

164
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,660
Yeah.

165
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,020
That's right.

166
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,820
Yo, it's just
a minor setback, right?

167
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,140
Quit trippin', dude.

168
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,260
Shit.

169
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,300
Hey, you know what
I want to do?

170
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,780
What?

171
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,700
I want to get fucked up.

172
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,260
Me, too, man.

173
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,020
I got to find a job and placate
my baby, you know.

174
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,780
Sylvia's going
to kick your ass?

175
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,380
Come on, big man,
she'll be cool.

176
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,980
Come on.

177
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,620
- Bye, Nicole.
- Bye.

178
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,820
Let me get a couple
of singles, too, please.

179
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,780
Sorry, you buy whole pack.

180
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,580
Be cool, dude.

181
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,780
If I buy a whole pack

182
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,420
I'm gonna want
to smoke it.

183
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,620
I just want a couple
of smokes with my beer.

184
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,300
City give me $1,500 ticket.

185
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,300
No more.

186
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,740
Asshole.

187
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,700
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

188
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,060
Oh, shit.

189
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,740
That fucking gangster, man.

190
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,460
Homeboy just ran
a six second four-forty.

191
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,100
Damn, the chino looked
fucking pissed, man.

192
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,980
You think we'll be able
to go back there?

193
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,740
I hate that shit.

194
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,500
Fuckin' chino lookin' at us
like we were gonna bust him?

195
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,460
Come on, dude.
We're wearin' suits, man.

196
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,700
We totally look like cops.

197
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,340
He said he got fined
for that shit.

198
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,500
He was just being cautious.

199
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,660
Well, we got <i>pisto</i>,
we got <i>frajos</i>.

200
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,660
Only one thing missin'.

201
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,420
Be-at-ches.

202
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,980
Oh, yeah, I mean
besides bitches, man.

203
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,220
<i>Yesca?</i>
Mm-hmm.

204
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,820
Bingo.

205
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,060
I need to feel
some reefer madness.

206
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,780
You sure you want
to score some bud, dude?

207
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,860
You haven't smoked out
since like forever, man.

208
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,300
I said I want
to get fucked up, man.

209
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,980
Fuck this purity bullshit.

210
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,220
Yeah... fuck purity.

211
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,660
Aw, man, look at this
zero-head, dog.

212
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,740
Stupid-ass cholo.

213
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,020
Look at that.

214
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,260
That dude's slangin', dog.

215
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,500
Want to get
a dime?

216
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,580
No, I want it all.

217
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,300
Go for the stash, man.

218
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,260
Whoa, go, go, go.

219
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,900
Hey, hey, yo, yo.

220
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,980
That's my shit!

221
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,620
Fuck.

222
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,900
Outstanding.

223
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,980
Out-fucking-standing.

224
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,340
That shit was slick.

225
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,380
That motherfucker
just got schooled.

226
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,340
Bitch-ass cholo.

227
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,900
- Check this shit out, huh?
- Yeah.

228
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,100
Nice motherfucking haul.
You see that shit, huh?

229
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,820
Mm. It's not laced either.

230
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,820
Smell that shit.

231
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:41,900
Smell that motherfucking shit.

232
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,940
We just burned my car.

233
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,580
We go back there,
we're gonna get shot.

234
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,540
Yeah, no shit.

235
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,500
Man, bust that light.

236
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,260
Roll that shit up.

237
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,180
Yeah, yeah, Cool.

238
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,860
Yo, let's drop off
some resumés first.

239
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,060
Then we'll smoke out, dude.

240
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,180
Some resumés.

241
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,340
Yeah.

242
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,380
Ah, man, fresh air.

243
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,540
Look.

244
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,340
Oh! They're
dropped off, man.

245
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,540
You fucking asshole, man.

246
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,820
I got to get
a fucking job, man.

247
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,100
What's your problem, man?

248
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,380
What the fuck are
you doing, dickhead.

249
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,500
Yo, Mike, first day looking--

250
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,060
nobody ever gets a job
their first day looking.

251
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,620
Come on, don't
sweat it, man.

252
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,660
Hey, I can't
fuck around tomorrow.

253
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,820
I got to get a job for sure.

254
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,020
This is your job, man.

255
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,380
So act like a fucking
professional,

256
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,460
spark up the goods, 'cause we
got a lot of work to do.

257
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,340
It's harsh. It's good, though.

258
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,500
You okay?

259
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,460
How are those lungs, baby?

260
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,100
There it is.

261
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,660
That magic feeling.

262
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,660
Damn, look at that bitch.

263
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,380
Oh, damn.

264
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,380
Fuck, yeah.

265
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,900
She's fucking good.

266
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,460
I bet she got skills.
I want to get laid.

267
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
You just saw your woman.

268
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,900
Only hit her once, man.

269
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,180
We can't go nowhere alone.
They got me sleeping in the car.

270
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,780
Family's got that ass
under guard, huh?

271
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,900
Lock and key.

272
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,620
Fuck, I want to get laid.

273
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,620
Pay a visit
to my harem, huh?

274
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,780
Online, pornmeister.

275
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,300
Uh-uh, let's go
to Letty's pad, man.

276
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,100
How much you want to bet
I hit it.

277
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,860
- She won't, dog.
- How much you want to bet?

278
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,180
She won't give you shit, dog.

279
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,780
You big time
fucked her over.

280
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,420
Aw, man, I popped that poodahey.

281
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,580
I got that mind control, man.

282
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,020
How much you want to bet
I get back up in it?

283
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,500
20 bucks?

284
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,740
You ain't got 20 bucks.

285
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,660
So, neither do you, man.

286
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,420
Come on, shake on that shit.

287
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,780
Come on.

288
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,980
What the fuck, let's go.

289
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,540
I got it.

290
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,060
What's up, Patty?

291
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,940
- <i>Y tu hermana?</i>
- She ain't here.

292
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,420
<i>Y sabes que?</i>

293
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,460
You're not welcome
in this house.

294
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Sure, Patty.

295
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,540
I'd love to come in.

296
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,180
Thank you.

297
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,380
Are they here?

298
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,300
You're looking fine,
as fuck, <i>chulas</i>.

299
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,420
Don't... don't touch
me, please.

300
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,020
Hey, hey.

301
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,500
You got to get out of here.

302
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,420
Letty...

303
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,460
I just wanted
to see you again.

304
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,220
Hey, Patty, you want to grab
me a <i>pisto</i> or something?

305
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,180
I ain't grabbing you shit.

306
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:05,540
Oh, you still got
a mouth, huh?

307
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,500
Maybe one day you'll learn
how to keep it shut.

308
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,620
Laters. I'm going to my room.

309
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,820
You know you have to run
his ass out of here.

310
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,220
Baby.

311
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,340
Let's sit down.

312
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,020
No, no, no.

313
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,980
So, um...

314
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,780
You a cop yet?

315
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,340
I'm working on it.

316
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,540
<i>Y tu?</i>

317
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,420
<i>Que andas haciendo?</i>

318
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,740
Well, you know, I'm going
to L.A. Trade Tech.

319
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,300
It's good you're doing
positive shit.

320
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,060
What, after everything
I don't get a kiss?

321
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,700
It's because of everything
you can't get a kiss.

322
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
Oh, come on, come here.

323
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,900
Yeah.

324
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,500
Don't.

325
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,100
Jim, I got a boyfriend.

326
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,860
Who?

327
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,100
Flaco.

328
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,060
You're back with that

329
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,340
piece of shit after
what he did, Letty?

330
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,660
You're not fucking him, are you?

331
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,900
Please tell me no.

332
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,620
Yes. So... just go.

333
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,380
'Cause there's nothing
here for you, Jim.

334
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,740
See?

335
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,020
Okay?

336
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,780
I don't believe
this shit, Letty.

337
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,580
You're too good for that.

338
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,580
You gotta go.

339
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:56,340
Go. Please!

340
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,460
Let me talk to them.

341
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,340
No, Jim, don't
be stupid. Please.

342
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,540
Okay? <i>Largate.</i> Just go.

343
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,300
I guess it's later days.

344
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,260
<i>Largate.</i> Just go!

345
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,700
Flaco, the <i>pinchi guero</i>'s here!

346
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,860
<i>Apuarte,</i> Jim!
Hurry up!

347
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,900
- Fuck him up!
- I got him!

348
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,900
Fucking white boy!

349
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,540
What's up, faggot?!

350
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,300
We're going to fuck you up!

351
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,860
Yo! pop the trunk

352
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,060
so I can handle this shit!

353
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,740
Fuck you, <i>puto</i>!

354
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,340
I'll bust you!

355
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,260
Leave him alone!

356
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,140
Pop the fucking trunk!

357
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,220
Jim!

358
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,700
Oh, you fucked up!

359
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,820
Get your fucking knees
down on the curb now!

360
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,420
Get the fuck
over there, man!

361
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,300
Don't fucking move unless you
want your brains hanging out!

362
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,420
What's your problem, Flaco?

363
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,300
Motherfucker!

364
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,220
Fucking knees on the curb, man!

365
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,540
That's right!

366
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,460
Interlock your fingers
behind your heads, Flaco!

367
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,900
You deaf fuck!

368
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,580
Yo, Mike.

369
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,820
Yeah?

370
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,180
Do up their ride.

371
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,020
Freeze, bitch!

372
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,900
I'm going to take that big ass
of yours home,

373
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,020
hit it for a minute, you know?

374
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,300
Fuck off!

375
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,300
Now you got it.

376
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,100
Yo, relax, homie.

377
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,180
You break Letty's heart,
I'm coming for your mom.

378
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,340
Fuck!

379
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
Hey, <i>haina</i>.

380
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,900
Whoo!

381
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,420
Fuck off!
Oh, yeah?

382
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,300
What you got down here?

383
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,820
Oh...

384
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,300
Liking that.

385
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,140
Damn! Those are
badass kicks, dog.

386
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,900
Lucky you got little bitch feet,

387
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,220
else I'd be stomping around
in them motherfuckers.

388
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,060
- Fuck you, <i>puto</i>.
- Huh?

389
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,660
- Yeah. Fuck you.
- Yes?

390
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,300
You fucking stay still!

391
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,540
Bitches! If you didn't have
that fucking gun,

392
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,020
<i>ese</i>, it wouldn't
be about shit, homie.

393
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,860
Not fucking shit!

394
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,260
Hey, later, Patty!

395
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,060
I hope you're not
pregnant, but you know

396
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,140
you wanted me to blow in you.

397
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,260
Fuck you!

398
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,860
Bye, Letty!

399
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,900
<i>Salud.</i>

400
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,940
Divvy up the bounty, dude.
I know you got some cash.

401
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,180
I know I got more than that.

402
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,140
Yeah. Here we go.

403
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,420
Shit.

404
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,540
That's my pussy
she's giving away there.

405
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,140
Homeboy uses extra large.

406
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,860
Man, that's it?
Next time,

407
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,420
jack someone with a job.

408
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,980
Well, fuck you.
What did you get, their lunch?

409
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,660
Check it out.

410
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,620
Holy shit.
You're kidding me.

411
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,540
Whoo! It's a fucking
Ruger P-94. Nine millimeter.

412
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,340
14, plus one in the chamber.

413
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,060
It's a good fucking gun.
Durable.

414
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,820
It's brand-new.

415
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,700
It's a BB gun.

416
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,100
Yeah. Cool.

417
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,660
Here you go, dog.

418
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,980
About time you got a <i>cohete</i>.

419
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,420
No. I don't want it.

420
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,620
Why the fuck not? I'll use it.

421
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,580
That's a good reason. Sell it.

422
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,540
How much you think
we can get for the gun?

423
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,180
Two bills, maybe three.
Costs six new.

424
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,260
We'll sell it
and split the greenery.

425
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,220
You sure?

426
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,860
It's cool, dude.

427
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,380
50-50.

428
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,900
Good BB gun though.

429
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,380
Shoot some birds and shit.

430
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,100
Hey, put that shit away.

431
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,580
Looks real as hell.

432
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,820
Not a bad day's work.

433
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,740
Get down to business though.

434
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,100
I know you didn't get any.

435
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,580
So pay up, motherfucker.

436
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,300
Dick.

437
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,860
Hello. This is a message
for Michael Alonzo.

438
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,500
This is Bob Luell
at the Palm Glen Group.

439
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,500
We have reviewed your resumé,

440
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,180
and would like
to make an appointment

441
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,540
for later in the week.

442
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,660
Please call me at your

443
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,420
earliest convenience.

444
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,380
Thank you.

445
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,580
Huh? That's good.

446
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,140
One more? This is fun.

447
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,180
Sounded a little gay,
but it was good.

448
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,220
No, no, no. no.
That's it, dude. That's it.

449
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,300
I get too many callbacks,

450
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,540
Sylvia's going
to get suspicious.

451
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,100
Oh, Sylvia's going
to be kissing your ass.

452
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,460
Not if she
recognizes your voice.

453
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,420
Oh, she won't. Here, sir.

454
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,980
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm cool.

455
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,420
- Come on.
- I'm cool.

456
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,820
I want to get home before the
little woman and sober up.

457
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,740
Come on, bro. One brew.

458
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,020
All right, but hey,

459
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,820
I got to look for a job
tomorrow for sure.

460
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,020
Okay? I can't
be getting fucked up

461
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,100
behind Sylvia's back
when I'm supposed

462
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
to be looking
for work, man.

463
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,780
Not cool.
Tomorrow, for sure.

464
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,820
I got to find a job, too.

465
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,260
Hello.

466
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,900
Yes, sir.

467
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,820
Yes, sir. That is correct.

468
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,260
Six years.

469
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,460
Honorably discharged.

470
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,100
Yes, sir.

471
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,860
I would love to.

472
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,860
Believe me, I would
welcome the opportunity.

473
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,780
Tomorrow

474
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,620
is not a problem.

475
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,860
Thank you, sir.
You have a good day, too.

476
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,460
Good-bye, sir.

477
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,660
That was the man, huh?
You're all "Sir,

478
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,020
sir, sir."

479
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,980
Yes! Fucking yes! Thank God!

480
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,060
That was the man!
That was the Federal man!

481
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,540
The Federal man!

482
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,780
Department of
Homeland Security

483
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,580
wants me to come in
tomorrow to start testing!

484
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,420
Oh, shit!

485
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,660
Fucking A, my brother!

486
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,940
That shit is righteous,
motherfucker!

487
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,140
It's on, homie!

488
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,780
Wow, man.
Tomorrow.

489
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,460
So what the fuck you
going to do now, dude?

490
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,980
I got to take a piss test.

491
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,300
If I'm cool,
I'm in the house.

492
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,580
Yeah! Oh!

493
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,900
Shit, dude,
do they piss test for weed?

494
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,500
Oh, shit!

495
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,580
You fucked up, man.

496
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,420
Oh, fuck.

497
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,660
I fucked up.

498
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,180
Oh, fuck. I fucked up.

499
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,500
Fuck! Oh...

500
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,420
You know, one dope
molecule, and I'm done.

501
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,820
And they will burn me

502
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,340
with every law enforcement
outfit in the country.

503
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,500
Shit!

504
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,780
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, dude.

505
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,100
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

506
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,900
Hey, there's a way out
of every fucking situation.

507
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,340
- Right? Relax, dude.
- Yeah, yeah.

508
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,700
Yeah. I'm going to do
what I got to do, you know?

509
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,820
It's cool. Fuck, yeah.

510
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,900
I'll pass that shit.

511
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,260
Hell, yeah. Yeah.

512
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,540
Of course
you will, dude!

513
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,380
Later, loco.

514
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,620
Don't fucking trip, dude.

515
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,500
All right.

516
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,460
Shit.

517
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,420
Eat.

518
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,340
Come in, dumb ass!

519
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,060
What's up, dog?

520
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,020
What up, dog...

521
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,740
Hey, Jim.
Want some coffee?

522
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,780
Sure.

523
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,500
Want some eggs?
There's extra.

524
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,660
Yes, ma'am. Please.

525
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,580
I, uh, heard
about the LAPD.

526
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,380
Sorry about that.

527
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,260
I thought they
guaranteed you a job.

528
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,740
Yea. Me, too.

529
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,260
Well, maybe it
wasn't meant to be.

530
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,940
You know, you being a cop.

531
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,420
Tell her what's up, dude.

532
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,700
Well, I applied

533
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,660
to all the Federal
law enforcement agencies.

534
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,980
You know, ATF, Border Patrol,

535
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,380
ICE, Homeland Security,
all of them.

536
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,060
And Homeland Security's
interested in me.

537
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,540
They want me to come in today
and start testing.

538
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,940
Wow. That's great.
How sure is this?

539
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,620
Well, I got a urinalysis today.

540
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,740
If I pass that, I'll be
a Special Agent candidate,

541
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,700
and then I could
be out of here next month.

542
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,500
You haven't been
smoking out, have you?

543
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:27,100
Nah. Chilled on that shit
a while back.

544
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,260
Good. Well, thanks for driving
Mike around yesterday.

545
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,100
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, bro.

546
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,060
Three callbacks.

547
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,580
Damn! Good!

548
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,260
We dropped off
enough resumés. Whoo!

549
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,660
Got more.

550
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,660
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

551
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,180
Well, you have
to keep trying

552
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,660
until something happens.

553
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,140
Finding a job <i>is</i> a job, right?

554
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,420
Lunch money.

555
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,620
Thank you.

556
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,860
And good
luck today.

557
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,740
Thank you.

558
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,140
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

559
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,900
Good luck.

560
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,260
And, Jim, good luck
on your pee test.

561
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,420
I hope you studied.

562
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,660
I'm going to
cram for it.

563
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,980
Man, that's freaky.

564
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,980
She was in
a good mood.

565
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,380
Breakfast
and beer money?

566
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,380
Yeah, dude.

567
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,660
She heard the
messages last night.

568
00:31:11,695 --> 00:31:12,780
She got me a sixer.

569
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,420
I slammed two last night.

570
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,020
Out-fuckin'-standing!

571
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,620
Now we know beer is just
a phone call away.

572
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,780
Yeah.

573
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,420
Yeah. We talked shit out
last night, though.

574
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,540
You know? Hey, all she wants
is for me to get a job.

575
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,340
I shouldn't be playing her
like that.

576
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,620
Dude, you <i>had</i> a good job,

577
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,180
with that, uh, with
that Web design shit.

578
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,700
Had, dude. <i>Had.</i>

579
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,860
All right? All that
shit's in India now.

580
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,500
Want a cold one?
No, later.

581
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,700
You got any vinegar?

582
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,100
Vinegar? What for?

583
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,780
Ah...

584
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,700
Oh...

585
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
Damn, dude!

586
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,900
Ah...!

587
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,540
- Man!
- That is fuckin' sick, man.

588
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,420
What'd you do that for?

589
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,860
- Shuts down the old kidneys.
- Ooh.

590
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,820
Come on, let's roll.

591
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,900
Grab me that bag, dude.

592
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,740
Little trick I learned
in the service.

593
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,820
Aw, that's sick, dude.

594
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,420
You're gonna stick
a turkey baster in your dick?

595
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,940
Quit looking, faggot.

596
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,700
You wish.

597
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,740
Oh, man.

598
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,020
Fuckin'...

599
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,580
shit, dude.

600
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,620
Oh, fuckin' shit...

601
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,220
Aw...

602
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,140
Aw, motherfucker!

603
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,940
Whew!

604
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,380
Ah...

605
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,540
That was...

606
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,100
unpleasant.

607
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,580
Man...

608
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,540
Man, I want to get
this shit over with.

609
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,780
You know, my teeth are floating.

610
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,260
Oh...

611
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,740
You get those
in the military, dog?

612
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,900
I was a Ranger.

613
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,020
Your mom still suck
a mean dick, hmm?

614
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,660
Gotcha! Shouldn't ignore people.

615
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,220
Why don't you go
fuck yourself!

616
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,300
Hey!

617
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,660
Let's play nice,

618
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,220
boys.

619
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,140
I have everyone's "Consent to
Urinalysis" form signed

620
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,220
and dated, am I right?

621
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,180
Yes, sir.

622
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,100
Good. I'm Agent Richards.

623
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,700
Jackets off.

624
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,740
I will now administer
the easiest test

625
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,700
Homeland Security
will ever give you,

626
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,020
the whizz quiz.

627
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,340
Roll up both sleeves
past the elbow.

628
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,340
Remove all gloves, rings,
watches, bracelets,

629
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,540
jewelry, Band-Aids
and bandages.

630
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,940
I want to see nothing
but bare hands and forearms.

631
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,460
Wiggle your fingers.

632
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,060
Let me see
both sides.

633
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,820
Beautifully done.

634
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,860
Again, gentlemen,
no talking.

635
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,100
Detweiler, is it?

636
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:14,980
You're with me.

637
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,100
Fucker.

638
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,020
Next!

639
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,860
Name?

640
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,940
Davis, Jim.

641
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,580
Ah, the Ranger.

642
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,940
Yes, sir.

643
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,780
- You serve?
- 101st.

644
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,180
- High speed.
- All right.

645
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,020
Think you can fill that, son?

646
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,660
I could fill
a goddamn trash can, sir.

647
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,540
You're full of piss
and vinegar, aren't you, Jim?

648
00:34:58,575 --> 00:35:00,660
Yes, sir.

649
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,660
Hey, unload that shit before
you clown with it, okay?

650
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,300
I don't want my head
blown off

651
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,660
just when I'm getting
it straight.

652
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,700
Pop! What's it like

653
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,140
to just straight-up
whack a motherfucker?

654
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,140
What's it like?
I mean, what the fuck, you know?

655
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,580
It's like nothing.
What's it supposed to be like?

656
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,900
You tell me.

657
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,140
You were busting heads
for the military.

658
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:26,540
I can't talk about
this shit, Mike.

659
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,900
But I will tell you one
thing-- you point and shoot,

660
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,580
pop, pop, move on, fuck 'em,
they shouldn't have been there,

661
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,100
you move the fuck on.

662
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,940
You do not stop
and <i>think</i> about it.

663
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,140
- It's not a big deal.
- So if it's nothing,

664
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,460
then what you getting
all mad for?

665
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,620
I'm not getting mad.

666
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,020
I just hate stupid
questions, Mike.

667
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,100
You think you killed
a lot of Commies?

668
00:35:49,135 --> 00:35:51,100
- They weren't Commies, dumb ass.
- Then what were they?

669
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,420
You know what they were--
they were fuckin' Hajjis,

670
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,900
terrorists, the bad guys.

671
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,780
Did you like it?
Oh, shit.

672
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,700
Did you dig it?

673
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,020
You bust a nut?

674
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,740
Not fuckin' now, man.
Seriously.

675
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,220
You're killing my buzz, dude.

676
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:12,620
Aw, kick back, stress case.

677
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,900
Are we on a mission to
sell this piece or what?

678
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,020
Hell, yeah.

679
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,380
Let's sell this
fuckin' piece.

680
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,860
Got to get some scratch,
you know what I'm saying?

681
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,660
Pop! Pop! Pop!

682
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,860
Yo, Darrel!

683
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,460
- Yo, yo, yo, Darrel!
- Wake the fuck up, Darrel!

684
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,180
Darrel!

685
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,380
Come on, come on, come on,
wake up and fuckin'

686
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,940
shine!

687
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,620
Y'all need to knock
this shit off right now.

688
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,980
Hey, what's up, bro?

689
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,140
Come on in, motherfuckers.

690
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,500
Yeah.

691
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,260
Get your little
ass up in here.

692
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,340
Shit!

693
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,420
Oh, man...

694
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,700
y'all scared
the fuck out of me, man.

695
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,140
You motherfuckers
got ties on.

696
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,980
I saw that city-lookin'
car pull up--

697
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,020
I thought y'all was
some rollers or shit.

698
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,380
I just got out of County.

699
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,580
- $9,600.
- No shit. When?

700
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:23,340
Yesterday.

701
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,940
Damn. What'd
they put on you?

702
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,900
Some bullshit.

703
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,980
I saw some wrong-ass shit

704
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,220
up in there, dude.

705
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,300
I ain't ever going back
to that motherfucker.

706
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,780
It scared you straight, huh?

707
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,340
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, you get booty-played?

708
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,540
<i>Hell,</i> no.

709
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,580
You over there tickling
your brown eye, dog?

710
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,980
They-they put some jelly
on there, serve some syrup?

711
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,900
- You toss the salad?
- Hey, you know, nigga,

712
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,580
I kept my ass to the wall
and my mouth shut.

713
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,740
Shoot.

714
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,860
I almost lost my job
over that shit.

715
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,460
Fuckin' around in there.

716
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,660
Oh, God...

717
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,420
- You a cop?
- Nope.

718
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,100
Rejected his ass.

719
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,220
Fuck you.

897
00:46:11,695 --> 00:46:13,900
Yeah, man, the human body's
got a gallon.

898
00:46:13,935 --> 00:46:16,900
Damn!

899
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,740
I coulda boned Gracie.

900
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,380
She had that proper thickness.

901
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,380
Look at me, dog.

902
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,300
Look at me.

903
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,980
I'm fuckin' traumatized
and shit.

904
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,620
Yo, homie, that shit
don't fuckin' faze you at all?

905
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,940
Oh, man,
I seen way worse.

906
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,380
Trashcanistan.

907
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,740
My battle buddy, he got his legs
and arms blown off

908
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,060
by a booby-trapped motorcycle.

909
00:46:42,095 --> 00:46:45,180
Medic saved his ass
and he lived.

910
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,940
He didn't want to, but he did.

911
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:50,300
I got to face my woman.

912
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,540
How in the fuck am I supposed
to play this shit off, huh?

913
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,540
Man, you'll do it, player.

914
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,380
Hey, baby girl,
you cooking?

915
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,740
Yeah. Where have you been?

916
00:47:05,775 --> 00:47:07,180
Oh, Jim's pad.

917
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,460
You been drinking?

918
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:10,060
Oh, you know,
I had a few brews.

919
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,460
A few?
Yeah.

920
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,660
You look wasted.

921
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,860
Don't trip, girl.

922
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,060
I've been working
all day.

923
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,220
I've been looking
for work all day.

924
00:47:22,255 --> 00:47:25,100
I wish I could hang out and
get wasted like the old days.

925
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,860
You know what?

926
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,100
When I'm working,
you can lounge.

927
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,940
I'll fix this place up,

928
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,300
get you nice clothes
and stuff...

929
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,540
Mike, Mike, Mike.

930
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,980
It doesn't have anything
to do with money.

931
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,340
Come here.

932
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,620
Sit down. I want
to talk to you.

933
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,140
Hey, it's not
about stuff.

934
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,060
It's about you and me
needing an equal partner.

935
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,460
Right.

936
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,540
Hey, I know that you
supported me through college

937
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,980
and I'm gonna always

938
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,100
- owe you for that.
- Right.

939
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,340
Now everything's flipped

940
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,900
and I feel like I'm doing
everything alone.

941
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,820
You know, sometimes
I feel like you're my kid.

942
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,780
I mean, you sneak
around like one.

943
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,940
Oh-ho!

944
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,900
Look... Wow, dude.

945
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,140
I'm sorry.

946
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,140
Be cool, baby girl,

947
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,540
I'm on a mission
to get my shit together.

948
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,060
I applied at this commercial
realty company in Studio City,

949
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,260
and this black guy,
he was the office manager

950
00:48:13,295 --> 00:48:14,460
and he's fuckin' hella cool,

951
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,220
you know? We're talkin'
and all that shit.

952
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,420
You know? We're just kickin' it
and all that.

953
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,780
Did you, did you
check the messages?

954
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,940
Four messages.

955
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,580
Mr. Alonzo, I'm calling

956
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,140
from Sunhouse Properties
to schedule an interview.

957
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,580
Honey, this is great!

958
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,380
Mm, mm...
Oh! Oh...

959
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,300
You better call him
first thing in the morning.

960
00:48:36,335 --> 00:48:37,820
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

961
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:41,100
Oh, damn, dog,
that shit was good, dude.

962
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:43,540
Damn, they should give you
a fuckin' Oscar for that shit.

963
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,660
You just stood there

964
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,500
and you fed me a line of
bullshit like it was nothing.

965
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,220
You should be
the lawyer.

966
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,700
How could you just do that?

967
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,260
How could you look me in the eye
and lie to me like that?

968
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,300
I'm sorry.

969
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,820
I'd rather you hit me.

970
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,020
I'm your clown.

971
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,540
I'm your fucking clown.

972
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,940
And you and Jim
are laughing at me?

973
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,900
No, it's not...

974
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:27,020
No, no, no, you are so utterly,
irrevocably busted!

975
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,860
Why don't you just go play
with your little butt buddy?

976
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,780
Go cook up more lies.

977
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,700
You know, I bet
you're doing lines again.

978
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,300
Dude, how could you say
that shit?

979
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,500
I'm not fuckin'
doing lines again.

980
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,020
Yeah, right, right.

981
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,620
I'm not fuckin'
doing lines again!

982
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,060
Right now your word
is less than shit.

983
00:49:46,095 --> 00:49:48,060
Maybe you should go.

984
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,820
Just fuckin' go.

985
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:55,820
Just fuckin'... just go, right?

986
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,380
Fuck it.
I'll fuckin' go!

987
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,460
Please, go. Go!

988
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,340
Fuck it then!
I'll fuckin' go!

989
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,940
Then go, Mike!

990
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,060
I'm serious!
I'll fuckin' go

991
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,260
except I won't fuckin'
come back!

992
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,420
You want me to fuckin' go?!

993
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,420
Fuckin' go, Mike!

994
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,700
I'll fuckin' go then!

995
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,660
I'll fuckin' go!

996
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,500
Get the fuck outta here!

997
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,500
Hello?

998
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,060
Speaking.

999
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:28,140
Of course, sir. Absolutely.

1000
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,140
Thank you very much,
Agent Richards.

1001
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,140
Thank you, sir.

1002
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,060
Who was that?

1003
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,420
That was the feds,
my friend.

1004
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,940
I've been informed that I passed
my urinalysis

1005
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,300
and they would like me
to go in this morning

1006
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:49,460
to start formal testing.

1007
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,900
Fuck yeah, dude.

1008
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,980
I'll be there all day,

1009
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,980
so take my ride,
get your ass a job.

1010
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:55,980
Let's go.

1011
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,260
Oh, shit!

1012
00:50:57,295 --> 00:51:00,820
Come on. Get your
parasitic ass in gear.

1013
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,500
I had some twisted-ass dreams
about that dude being killed.

1014
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,420
I slept like a baby.

1015
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,740
I heard screaming.

1016
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:15,260
What kind of tests?

1017
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,980
Psychological tests.

1018
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,140
Geez, you're
a freakin' psycho, dude.

1019
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,540
Don't answer that shit
honestly.

1020
00:51:22,575 --> 00:51:24,940
Hell no.

1021
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,140
They use the Minnesota
Multiphasic Inventory.

1022
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,180
It's like 600 questions,
cross-referenced

1023
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,140
to detect deception.

1024
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,620
They ask the same shit

1025
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,540
six different ways.
It's lame.

1026
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,340
You'll ace it.

1027
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,780
Dude, I'm gonna pull it off.

1028
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,260
All I needed was a shot.

1029
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,980
Gotta play the system.

1030
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,220
Like a piano.

1031
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,300
You done
with that crap, son?

1032
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,540
Yes, sir.

1033
00:52:02,575 --> 00:52:05,100
Let's grab some coffee
while these guys finish up.

1034
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,140
Bring that with you.

1035
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,020
I see dumb people.

1036
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,180
We reviewed
your LAPD package.

1037
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,660
Since they ran your background,
physical and psych,

1038
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,660
we're going with
their paper.

1039
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,220
- Navy sucks.
- Army swallows.

1040
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,060
Took a little work to
pry your jacket loose

1041
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,460
from their people.

1042
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,980
They don't much like us poaching
from their applicant pool.

1043
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,460
Move it, dirt bag.

1044
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,340
Why'd they drop me?

1045
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,740
Someone here make a call?

1046
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,140
Nope.

1047
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,420
They dropped you
on psych, Jim.

1048
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,780
You blew
their profiles.
