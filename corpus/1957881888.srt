00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,200
[music playing]

2
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,120
 Snow, snow, snow.

3
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,760
It must be 20 below out there.

4
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,720
[sneeze]

5
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,240
What I wouldn't give to
move this whole operation

6
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,440
to a warmer climate.

7
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,720
 Elmer, what in the
name of Ebenezer Scrooge

8
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,160
is your problem, anyway?

9
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,000
Are we going to go through
this every Christmas?

10
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,680
 Nothing ever changes.

11
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,360
Every year, it's
the same thing--

12
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,560
hurry, hurry, hurry.

13
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,840
Beat the clock.

14
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,320
Rush, rush, rush, rush.

15
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,680
And when you barely have
time to catch your breath,

16
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,920
we start all over again.

17
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,640
I need a vacation.

18
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
 A vacation?

19
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,960
From what?

20
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,760
You haven't finished
one single assignment.

21
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,040
You've already been kicked
out of parts and assembly.

22
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
The boxing division is working
overtime after that fiasco,

23
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,360
and the design department
voted to put you

24
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,400
on the next polar
bear out of town.

25
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,120
 Can I help it if no one
appreciates my suggestions?

26
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,240
 The real kick in the pants is
it's a week before Christmas,

27
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,240
and I need every available
elf, like it or not.

28
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,360
Now report to gift wrap.

29
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,560
And step on it!

30
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,960
Christmas is coming!

31
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,720
 Yeah, yeah.

32
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,680
WOMAN OVER INTERCOM: Would the
elf belonging to [inaudible]----

33
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,240
 And stay out.

34
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,720
WOMAN OVER INTERCOM: You're
blocking the reindeer bay.

35
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,080
 Tsk, tsk, tsk.

36
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,800
All I have left is QC.

37
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,440
It's your last stop, Elmer.

38
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,720
If I get one more
complaint, you're

39
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,080
going to spend the
rest of the holiday

40
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,920
cleaning up after the reindeer.

41
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,160
Got it?

42
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,760
WOMAN OVER INTERCOM:
Attention, elves.

43
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,720
Gingerbread cookies and milk
will be served at 3 o'clock

44
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,880
today.
Attention, elves.

45
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,840
The ECU-- Elf Credit Union--

46
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,240
will observe holiday hours
and stay open until 4:15

47
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,680
PM Monday through Friday.

48
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,760
[glass breaking]
- Incoming!

49
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,520
ELF: Elmer!

50
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
ELMER: I hate being an elf.

51
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,320
Work, work, work, all year long.

52
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,880
For what?

53
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,680
So a bunch of kids can get
some presents for Christmas.

54
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,640
Give, give, give.

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,000
What about me?

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,240
Don't I count?

57
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,760
When was the last
time I got presents?

58
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,200
I'll tell you when--

59
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,280
never.

60
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,120
That's when.

61
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,320
And I wish, just a wish,
I could trade places.

62
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,760
I'd be a kid getting
presents for Christmas,

63
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,920
eating candy canes, having
visions of sugarplums

64
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,880
dancing in my head.

65
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,440
What is a sugarplum, anyway?

66
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,400
How would I know?

67
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,720
I've never even seen one.

68
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,000
That's another thing.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,600
If I were a kid, I
wouldn't have to work.

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,640
Cartoons all year long.

71
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,200
[sneeze]

72
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,440
Somewhere where
it ain't snowing.

73
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,840
SANTA: You should have
the missus make you

74
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,040
some nice, hot chicken soup.

75
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,120
Best thing there
is for a head cold.

76
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,640
 Um, Santa?

77
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,000
How long have you
been standing there?

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,520
 Long enough to know you're not
the happiest elf on the team.

79
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,760
 Oh, it just seems like
I'm missing something.

80
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,280
There's so much
giving going on, but I

81
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,760
never do any of the getting.

82
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,440
 You think you'd
be happy out there

83
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,080
in the real world, where all the
boys and girls have it so easy.

84
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,200
You think that's what's missing?

85
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,000
Hmm?

86
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,800
 Well, yeah.

87
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,760
Never been in here before.

88
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,800
 Elmer, meet GERT.

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,160
 Gert?

90
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,480
 Global Electronic
Radar Tracking.

91
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,840
After that close
encounter with that 747,

92
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,600
Elvin thought we should
update things a little.

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,960
 But what about Rudolph?

94
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,440
 Oh, I'll always need
Rudolph and the others

95
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,760
to pull the full load.

96
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,000
But with the atmosphere
filled to capacity

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,080
with all the microwaves and
television and satellite

98
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,720
transmissions,
even Rudolph could

99
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,120
overshoot a rooftop, especially
in all that confusion.

100
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
 I sure wish I could go.

101
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,480
I'd do anything to
see the outside world.

102
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,800
 Oh, Elmer.

103
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,840
If you only knew how
special you were.

104
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
All my elves are special.

105
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,880
What a gift it is
to be able to give.

106
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,280
It's the most wonderful
thing there is.

107
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,720
 Elmer!

108
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,520
What are you doing here?

109
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,960
Get back to work.

110
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,440
 OK, OK!

111
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,480
Don't be getting your
Christmas tinsel in a bunch.

112
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,360
I'm going.

113
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,160
[chuckling]

114
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,440
 Those young elves.

115
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,920
There's a staff meeting at
3, and you have a fitting

116
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,800
with a tailor at 3:30.

117
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Looks like they're going to
have to let the suit out again,

118
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,680
Santa.

119
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,520
[chuckling]

120
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,560
 What a gift it is to give.

121
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,280
What does that mean?
What gift?

122
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,680
Give who?

123
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,720
Still sounds like no
presents for Elmer to me.

124
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,400
Ew, Donner.

125
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,040
Someone needs a bath.

126
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,400
Good thing my nose
is stuffed up.

127
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,360
How to become a a real boy.

128
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,080
If you want to be a boy, these
three things you must deploy.

129
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,440
First to find a far-off
place with houses,

130
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,640
farms, and open space.

131
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,560
Second, you must do a deed to
help one true friend in need.

132
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,840
Do both of these
by half past noon

133
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,520
on the eve of a Christmas moon.

134
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,280
The third and final
stipulation to guarantee

135
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,960
your transformation, and those
funny ears that you despise

136
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,560
will disappear before your eyes.

137
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,280
If you wish three
times to yourself

138
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,440
to no longer be an elf.

139
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,280
That doesn't sound too hard.

140
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,600
[music playing]

141
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,360
I'm sure there's enough
room in this sleigh for one,

142
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,840
small, pointy-eared elf.

143
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,120
Now all I have to
do is get off at

144
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,880
a nice, warm, tropical
locale and spend

145
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,040
Christmas like everybody else.

146
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,080
That'll bring me one step
closer to becoming a real boy.

147
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,920
This is cool.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,760
Santa's list.

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,520
You can add one more to
your list this year, Santa,

150
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,040
because Elmer plans on being
at the receiving end for once.

151
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,320
Santa's magic dust!

152
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,720
Boy, what I could do with this.

153
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,440
I could have anything
I ever wanted.

154
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,720
[sneeze]

155
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,120
Oh, look at that.

156
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Oh, no.

157
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,000
How do you turn this thing off?

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,880
[beeping]

159
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,320
Got a bad feeling about this.

160
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,800
[music playing]

161
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,120
[humming]

162
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,760
 Oh, well, Slick.

163
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,560
Not a lot going on tonight.

164
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,960
All the lonely people,
where do they--

165
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,920
wait a minute.

166
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,080
That's copyrighted material.

167
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,160
It'd cost me dearly.

168
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,440
[elmer shouting]

169
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
 Did you see that, Whitlock?

170
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,920
 See what, sir?

171
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,800
 That.

172
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,840
That flash of light.

173
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,440
 No, sir, I didn't.

174
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,280
By chance it was your blinding
wit, you arrogant windbag.

175
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,200
 What's that, Whitlock?

176
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,960
 Nothing, sir.

177
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,480
 I don't know, Whitlock.

178
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,280
I'm going for distinguished.

179
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,080
What do you think?
- Distinguished.

180
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,120
Yes.

181
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
I'll get my magic wand.

182
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,560
 Ah.

183
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,920
Perhaps the hat
speaks for itself.

184
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,840
 Volumes, sir.

185
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,520
It speaks volumes.

186
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,160
It just shouts a
nitwit in rented tails.

187
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,040
 Yes.

188
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,240
Yes, that's it.

189
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,640
Nothing says respect
like a top hat.

190
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,480
 Or a sharp, pointy stick.

191
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,480
 This is a very important
meeting coming up, Whitlock.

192
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,520
Randolph Slick is
offering to finance

193
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,560
my entire re-election campaign.

194
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,400
 And all out of the goodness
of his heart, no doubt.

195
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,880
 Oh, no, no.

196
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,840
This is about business,
one hand washing the other.

197
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
 Wash your own hand.

198
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,640
Heaven knows where it's been.

199
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,280
 All I have to do is remove a
few zoning laws from the books.

200
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,080
That's not too much to
ask, is it, Whitlock?

201
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,240
 Oh, no, sir, not at all.

202
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,040
Tell me, is our
little town being

203
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,240
rezoned as a military target
range or a munitions dump?

204
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,080
 Whitlock, give me
more credit than that.

205
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,640
Why must you always
think the worst?

206
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,000
 Oh, I don't know.

207
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,520
Let's see.

208
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,720
After 12 years' faithful
service, let's call it a hunch.

209
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,320
 The new owners
of Slick Plastics

210
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,760
will probably want to expand,
introduce a whole new line

211
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,160
of plastic products.

212
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,760
Oh, it could be anything.

213
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,080
 You'd presume a man in your
position would think to ask.

214
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,520
 When a man like
Mr. Slick offers you

215
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,960
something for nothing,
well, you don't look a gift

216
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,920
horse in the mouth, Whitlock.

217
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,840
 Unfortunately, we're
dealing with the opposite

218
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,800
of [inaudible], sir.

219
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,480
 Not a word about
this to anybody.

220
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,800
Mr. Slick doesn't want anybody
finding out about this deal

221
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,280
until it's finalized.

222
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,760
We don't want any
environmentalists or do-gooders

223
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,160
trying to interfere.

224
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,440
 Too bad you're not
running for governor, sir.

225
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,520
MAN: You say
something, Whitlock?

226
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,000
 Just breathing, sir.

227
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,960
 Well, stop it.

228
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,800
It's annoying.

229
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,600
Ah, Burt Wellington,
you've still got

230
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,400
it, despite what mother says.

231
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,920
You still got it.

232
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,160
 I'm trying to
stay upwind of it.

233
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,400
 Call for my car, Whitlock.

234
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,280
 Yes, sir.

235
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,600
Right away, sir.

236
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,920
Might I breathe now, sir?

237
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,880
WOMAN: Two days
before Christmas,

238
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,080
and there's still
no sign of snow.

239
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,760
You know, it says
in the paper it

240
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,640
hasn't been this unseasonably
hot in Plantville since 1929.

241
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,920
 You say somethin', darlin'?

242
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,200
 Oh, don't mind me.

243
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,800
I'm just grousin' about
the weather again.

244
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,000
But with the plant closing
down and everyone out of work,

245
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,400
it just doesn't seem
much like Christmas.

246
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,920
 What?

247
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
 Joe, did you have to use
everything in the kitchen?

248
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,800
 Look, I'll clean
it up later, OK?

249
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,480
 Yeah, sure.

250
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,960
 You know, with
everybody wanting

251
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,240
my great-great-grandmother's
secret recipe for orange

252
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,360
cranberry sauce surprise, well,
that's been in our family for--

253
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,400
 For generations.

254
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,160
Yeah, I know.

255
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,160
 Well, Rebecca-- she can
pass it down to her kids.

256
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,320
Where is Becky, anywhere?

257
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,680
I thought you to
were going shopping.

258
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,160
 She's buried herself
in the newspaper again.

259
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,920
I don't even think
she realizes Christmas

260
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,080
is just a couple days away.

261
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,720
 She's got big dreams, Mother.

262
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,800
With a girl like Becky, you
can't keep her in a small town

263
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,160
forever.

264
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,520
No, sir.

265
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,000
Our daughter was meant
to do important things.

266
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,120
 I just don't see why she
can't do important things

267
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,600
right here in Plantville.

268
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,080
 She wants to see the
world, experience new things.

269
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,320
I can't blame her for feeling
that there's something missing.

270
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,560
 I know.

271
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
I'm just so proud of
her I could burst.

272
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,680
 There, there, Mother.

273
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,200
Now, don't start
fretting yourself

274
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,800
before anything's happened.

275
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,000
It's Christmas time.

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 It's the heat.

277
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,600
It's got me all out of sorts.

278
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,520
 You still got me.

279
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,800
 Yeah.

280
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,120
 Yeah.

281
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,440
You're going to have
plenty of me around here

282
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,960
until the plant reopens.

283
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,720
 It just seems like such
an awful time for everyone

284
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,000
to be out of work.

285
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,600
 It's never a good
time to be out of work.

286
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,160
You know, Slick said that
after the sale of the plant,

287
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,760
the new owners would have it up
and operating by mid-January.

288
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,920
 I sure hope
you're right, dear,

289
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,680
because everyone in Plantville
depends on Slick Plastics

290
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,600
for their livelihood.

291
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
Maybe that new
owner will finally

292
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
listen to some of your ideas.

293
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,640
Good heavens.

294
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,480
What was that?

295
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,520
 I don't know.

296
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,160
I think it was a meteor.

297
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,640
This weather has
created all kinds of

298
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,160
strange atmospheric conditions.

299
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,440
Hey, make a wish, Mother.

300
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,560
I think it was a falling star.

301
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,440
Come on.

302
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,320
 I wish-- oh.

303
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,920
 Ha.

304
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,760
There it is.

305
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,640
I don't believe it.

306
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,000
Right here in my little town.

307
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,360
[music playing]

308
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,240
[footsteps]

309
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,200
WOMAN: Where'd it go?

310
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,880
I got it.
I actually got it.

311
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,160
I got it on film.

312
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,440
If I hurry, I can
make the news run it.

313
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,720
Please let there be
film in the camera.

314
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,360
Please let there by
film in the camera.

315
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,280
[chuckling]

316
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,480
 Well, well, look
what I've found.

317
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,200
I can't believe my luck.

318
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,600
I can't believe what's
just fallen into my lap.

319
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,400
I've got a plan to
hatch, money to make.

320
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,040
When it rains, it pours.

321
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,480
[chuckling]

322
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,760
Merry Christmas, Slick.

323
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,600
MAN OVER INTERCOM: Spicy
enchiladas with beans.

324
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,080
A side note-- the infirmary will
be open today until 6 o'clock.

325
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,480
SANTA: Eldwin!

326
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,040
 Coming, sir!

327
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,560
Great leaping reindeer.

328
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,560
It's only 7:00 AM and already
there there's a crisis.

329
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,920
Haven't even had my coffee yet.

330
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,520
SANTA: Eldwin!

331
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,000
 On my way, sir!

332
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,800
I'll be putting in overtime
until Groundhog Day.

333
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,120
SANTA: Eldwin.

334
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,280
Eldwin!

335
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,320
 Yes, Santa.

336
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,920
What seems to be the problem?

337
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,600
 Look around, Eldwin.

338
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,160
Notice anything missing?

339
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,520
 Can't believe
the sleigh is gone!

340
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,880
 I'm sure that's
why you're head elf.

341
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,160
 Where in the name of
Rudolph is the sleigh?

342
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,080
 That's what I
would like to know.

343
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,880
 I don't think this is
covered in the elf manual.

344
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,480
SANTA: Calm down, Eldwin.

345
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,080
I'm sure there's a
logical explanation.

346
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,920
 I have a sneaking feeling
that a pin-headed, pointy-eared

347
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
procrastinator is behind this.

348
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,320
Oh, if I get my hands on
that exasperating elf,

349
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,920
his Christmas goose is cooked.

350
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,520
He's not going to stand
a snowman's chance

351
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,720
in a corner of the desert of--

352
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,640
SANTA: Eldwin,
Eldwin, wasn't it you

353
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,040
who insisted that we install
the new global electronic radar

354
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,080
tracking device?

355
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,160
 Yeah, yeah, that was me.

356
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,960
It certainly seemed to be
a good idea at the time.

357
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,800
 Don't you think we
should turn it on?

358
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,200
 Turn it-- turn it on!

359
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,520
Right!

360
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,760
I'll go turn on the
radar tracking device.

361
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,000
 Good idea.

362
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,320
[chuckling]

363
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,120
MR. SLICK: You seen this?

364
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,760
 Ah, Mr. Slick, I was
just coming to see you.

365
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,000
Uh, there's nothing
wrong, is there?

366
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,600
 The morning paper,
front page story.

367
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,640
MAYOR WELLINGTON: Oh, that.

368
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,240
It's, uh, nothing.

369
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,400
Some publicity stunt just to
sell a bunch of newspapers.

370
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,840
[chuckling]

371
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,000
Now then, about your
contribution to my campaign

372
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
fund.

373
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,960
How much can I put you down for?

374
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,000
That is why you're here,
isn't it, Mr. Slick?

375
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,920
Uh, do you know, a
cashier's check will be--

376
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,760
 Not just yet.

377
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,680
 There isn't a problem,
is there, Mr. Slick?

378
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,200
 Lovely little
town, Plantville.

379
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,160
Peaceful.

380
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,520
Quaint.

381
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,440
Discreet.

382
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,720
 Yes, lovely town.

383
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,200
Now, about my campaign--

384
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,760
 Have you taken care of
all the zoning restrictions

385
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,840
like I asked?

386
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
 Yes.

387
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,000
Yes, everything's in the works.

388
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,480
Now, a personal
check can do as well.

389
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,560
 Sleek manufacturing
has been steadily losing

390
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,040
money for the past three years.

391
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,920
Oh, let's face it.

392
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,720
No one wants to buy
plastic flowers anymore.

393
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,080
When the Cincinnati corporation
offered to purchase the land

394
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,560
so they could discreetly
rid themselves of their, how

395
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,560
shall we say, toxic
debris where no one

396
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,600
would think to look for it--

397
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,360
well, at least not
until Plantville

398
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,520
starts to glow in the dark.

399
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,960
 Yeah.

400
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,960
 It seemed like a perfect
way to make some money

401
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,040
back on a losing proposition.

402
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,160
 You mean the new owner isn't
going to reopen the plants?

403
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,560
 Of course not, Wellington.

404
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,400
You'll be lucky if
they put up a fence.

405
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,560
But I may have found
something even better.

406
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,760
 Better than toxic waste?

407
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,000
MR. SLICK: This!

408
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,920
MAYOR WELLINGTON: That?

409
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,880
A UFO?

410
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,040
MR. SLICK: To the contrary.

411
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,840
A very identifiable
flying object.

412
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,800
To the novice eye,
it's only a UFO.

413
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,760
But to the experienced peeper
with high-powered binoculars

414
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,760
like me, it's a gold mine,
and all you have to do

415
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,880
is retrieve it.

416
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,920
I want it bad,
and I want it now.

417
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,400
 But what is it?

418
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,720
 Christmas.

419
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,840
[chuckling]

420
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,480
No wonder everyone loves me.

421
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,560
I'm a genius!

422
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,480
[laughter]

423
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,680
Well?

424
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,160
What are you just
sitting there for?

425
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,920
Get someone out to that
field to secure my property.

426
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,840
 Oh, yes.

427
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,920
Right away, Mr. Slick.

428
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,000
Call me when it's done.

429
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,480
I'll be in a bubble
bath, relieving stress.

430
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,960
 Uh, well, what about
your campaign contribution?

431
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,400
I was going to leave town,
uh, for the holidays.

432
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,680
I've already made reservations.

433
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,880
Nonrefundable airline tickets.

434
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,280
Oh.

435
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,800
Whitlock, get the
sheriff in my office now.

436
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,280
REBECCA: UFO spotted
over Ohio farm.

437
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,760
The Rollins farm just
outside of Plantville, Ohio,

438
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,480
was the target of
reported UFO sightings.

439
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,160
Rebecca Rollins, editor
of the local newspaper,

440
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,640
caught the nighttime phenomenon
on film, creating a stir

441
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,920
among the town's residents.

442
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,720
[chuckling]

443
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,360
Wow, look at that.

444
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,800
I did it.

445
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,960
I'm in the national news wire.

446
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,600
Wow.

447
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,760
This is my ticket out of this
dreary little one-horse town

448
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,960
and on to a big city paper
where I can do some real good.

449
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,360
[music playing]

450
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,400
[groaning]

451
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
 What happened?

452
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,200
I must have been
out for a while.

453
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,440
This thing doesn't
need a tracking device.

454
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,840
Needs a set of seat
belts and an airbag.

455
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,240
Good thing I landed head first.

456
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,000
Could've been seriously hurt.

457
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,320
Wonder where I landed.

458
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,880
Wherever I am, they
have cows here.

459
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,040
At least there's no snow.

460
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,640
Just leave this thing out
in the middle of a field.

461
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
It's probably toys.

462
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,320
[music playing]

463
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,400
Oh, great, it's stuck.

464
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,240
Needs a little extra help.

465
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,680
[sneeze]

466
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,040
What is it with this stuff?

467
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,960
[lights zapping]

468
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,440
[inaudible], you stupid thing!

469
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,440
How do you stop
this crazy thing?

470
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,800
[music playing]

471
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,840
That should hold it for a while.

472
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,600
So this is it, the real world.

473
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,560
Cool.

474
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,720
Pretty far-out place.

475
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,800
Lots of open space for me
to enjoy a great Christmas

476
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,120
with lots of presents.

477
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,600
Wait a minute.

478
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,320
If Santa's sleigh is
here, not the North Pole,

479
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,760
how's he going to
deliver me presents?

480
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,920
That really snaps my suspenders.

481
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,520
If it's not one
thing, it's another.

482
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,560
Where's that section
on troubleshooting?

483
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,840
[music playing]

484
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,040
 Hey, take it easy,
will you, Hank?

485
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,720
This coffee's hot.

486
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,280
 Sorry, Chief.

487
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,440
County maintenance shut down
road work for the winter.

488
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,040
I guess they figured there'd
be snow on the road by now.

489
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,160
 I don't know why the mayor
insisted we come out here.

490
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,200
Since that picture made
headlines all over the country,

491
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,920
we're gonna be knee-deep in
lookey-loos and sightseers,

492
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,400
and that's before breakfast.

493
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,040
 According to the mayor,
there's something out here.

494
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,560
He wants us to find it first.

495
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,280
 I think the mayor had just
a little bit too much holiday

496
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,320
cheer, and some of
those pink elephants

497
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,480
flew right up his nose.

498
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,400
[chuckling]

499
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,320
 Really?

500
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,080
 Yeah, right up his nose.

501
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,800
[door closing]

502
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
 Morning, Sheriff.

503
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,720
 Morning, Joe.

504
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,680
[chuckling]

505
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,480
 I suppose you saw the
headlines in the morning paper.

506
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,720
 Yeah, that girl of yours sure
put our little town on the map

507
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,680
this time.

508
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,560
 Got the whole town talking.

509
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,920
Loreen over at the diner
said strangers are asking

510
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,520
directions to your place.

511
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,960
JOE: Well, I guess I'll have
to throw on a big extra pot

512
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,640
of coffee then, huh?

513
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,360
SHERIFF: Say, Joe, uh, you mind
if we take a little look around

514
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,600
before curiosity
brings a bus load

515
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,280
of nosy neighbors this way?

516
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,960
 No, make yourself at home.

517
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,400
If you find any of
those little green men,

518
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,440
Sheriff, save one for me.

519
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,880
Meanwhile, I'll have Betty
throw on some extra flapjacks.

520
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,720
- Benny.
- What?

521
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,880
 What if there
really are aliens?

522
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,160
What do we do then?

523
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,400
 Well, we'll just
find out where

524
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,560
they're from and [inaudible].

525
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,080
 Yeah, but what they
don't come peaceful like?

526
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,680
 Maybe we'll take the
shotgun, just in case.

527
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,120
 Sure.

528
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,840
[music playing]

529
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,920
 Uh-oh.

530
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,320
The natives don't
look too friendly.

531
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,840
This isn't covered
in the manual.

532
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,000
 Why don't you check out
over in that area there?

533
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,960
I'm gonna see what's
on top of that hill.

534
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,280
[music playing]

535
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,640
 Ben!

536
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Hey, come here.

537
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,880
Look, look, look!

538
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,000
Tracks going right
into that door!

539
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,920
SHERIFF: I'll be.

540
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,720
Would you look at that?

541
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and look over there!

542
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,640
Little, tiny, pointed
footprints going

543
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,560
right in the same direction.

544
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,800
 This thing had better work.

545
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,800
[sneeze]

546
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,120
[music playing]

547
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,600
[groaning]

548
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,920
 What?

549
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,160
 You're not gonna
believe this, Ike.

550
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
 What?

551
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,560
 You're not gonna believe it.

552
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,560
100,000 light years
through space, and you're

553
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,480
not gonna believe what
they're riding in.

554
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
 What?

555
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,800
[music playing]

556
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
 Ben?

557
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,760
 Huh?

558
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,880
 Do you see what I'm seeing?

559
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,960
SHERIFF: You mean that little
green man on a bicycle?

560
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,400
 Uh-huh.

561
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,320
 No, I don't see a thing.

562
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,560
 What do we do now, Ben?

563
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,600
 Just follow orders, Ike.

564
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,400
Just follow orders.

565
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,600
[music playing]

566
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,480
[yelling]

567
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,040
 Next time I travel,
I'm taking first class

568
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,520
and bringing my luggage.

569
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,880
[music playing]

570
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,600
I was hoping for
something a little bigger,

571
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,360
something with a view.

572
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,840
Definitely a jacuzzi.

573
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,200
[snoring]

574
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,120
[music playing]

575
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,640
[door opening]

576
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,280
 Hi.

577
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,280
 Uh, hello.

578
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,680
 You have pointed ears.

579
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,360
 Runs in the family.

580
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,440
 So are you, like, related to
that guy from another planet?

581
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,000
He has ears just like yours.

582
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,560
 That would explain
the welcoming committee.

583
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,880
 How come you're sleeping
in the play house?

584
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,840
 Oh, I was just
passing through.

585
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,200
 Oh, I don't mind.

586
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,600
It's just that I haven't
seen you around before.

587
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,680
Do you go to my school?

588
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,120
 School?

589
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,360
I wish.

590
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,800
Lunch and recess
and arts and crafts?

591
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,120
It'd be a lot better than
working for a living.

592
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,600
Just try to convince
the other elves of that.

593
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,640
[gasp]

594
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,080
 Elf?

595
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,960
Really?

596
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,840
You're an elf?

597
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,040
 Well, actually, yeah, I am.

598
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,240
I really want to
be a boy, though,

599
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,040
but I don't think
Santa understands.

600
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,680
 You're one of Santa's elves?

601
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,200
That is totally cool!

602
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,640
 Whoa whoa, whoa.

603
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,080
I know what you're thinking.

604
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,320
Santa's elves.

605
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,880
Hanging with the big
guy all the time.

606
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,120
You don't know what kind
of pressure there is.

607
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,280
Painting, wrapping.

608
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,920
It's full-time,
nonstop responsibility.

609
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,520
It's exploitation, I tell you.

610
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,080
"Hard Copy" should do an expose.

611
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,760
It's not totally cool.

612
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,240
It's really cold out there.

613
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,280
I hate being an elf.

614
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,760
All I really want
is to be a boy,

615
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,360
get presents at Christmas
like everybody else.

616
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,200
So I got this book and ran away.

617
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:15,640
But a couple of guys think I'm
a space alien, and here I am.

618
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,800
 And I see the problem.

619
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
It's the ears.

620
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,440
Well, maybe the shoes and stuff.

621
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,320
Oh, I know.

622
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,520
Wait here.

623
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,280
Oh, I almost forgot.
My name's Julie.

624
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,320
What's yours?
- Elmer.

625
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,320
 Be right back, Elmer.

626
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,680
[music playing]

627
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,680
Here.

628
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,560
Put these on.

629
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,920
Jacket belongs to my dad, but
the cap and boots are mine.

630
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Better?

631
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,320
 You look just like a real boy.

632
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,480
 Cool.

633
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,080
This might be easier
than I thought.

634
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,360
Now all I have to do
is do good deed by noon

635
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,000
and wish three times.

636
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,200
 Well, you can stay here for
Christmas, but we need a plan.

637
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,680
My dad's really nice,
but he is a grownup.

638
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,600
 That's bad?

639
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
 Well, no, but sometimes
when you get old--

640
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,960
like, more than 20--

641
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,800
elves just don't compute.

642
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,920
 You mean grownups
don't believe in elves?

643
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,840
What about Santa?

644
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,400
What about Christmas?

645
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,360
 Well, it's not that
they don't believe.

646
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,840
It's just sometimes
they forget to believe.

647
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,560
 This place is worse
shape than I thought.

648
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,360
 We'll think of something.

649
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,200
Dad's been working odd jobs
ever since the plant closed.

650
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,440
Saturdays he's
usually so tired he

651
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,240
doesn't notice much until
after he's had his coffee.

652
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,520
 What about your mom?

653
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,280
 My mom's in heaven.

654
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,360
Daddy says she's an
angel watching over us.

655
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,840
 Well, that only leaves
me with one major problem--

656
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,200
Santa's sleigh.

657
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,160
I sort of accidentally
hijacked it to get here.

658
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,920
Gotta figure out how
to get it back in time.

659
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,040
There's gonna be more
than one disgruntled

660
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,320
boy on Christmas morning.

661
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,240
 Good morning, Daddy.

662
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,960
 Julie.

663
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,400
 Um, Daddy, this is
my new friend, Elmer.

664
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,880
He's going to be
staying for breakfast.

665
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,840
Is that OK?

666
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,880
 Oh, yeah.

667
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,000
Sure, honey.

668
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,240
Breakfast.

669
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,480
Just don't make a
mess in the kitchen.

670
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,800
 OK.

671
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,000
And he'll be staying
for Christmas too, OK?

672
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,480
 Uh-huh.

673
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,240
 Told ya.

674
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,520
[snoring]

675
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,520
 Elmer?

676
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,160
Who on Earth is Elmer?

677
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,480
 Work?

678
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,720
Study?

679
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,840
You're kidding.

680
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,520
Tell me you're kidding.

681
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,400
I mean, you've got
to work in school?

682
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,760
 Sure, Elmer.

683
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,840
What'd you think, it was
just all fun and games?

684
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,200
 Well, I wasn't dreaming.

685
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,680
 No, Daddy.

686
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,720
This is Elmer.

687
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,000
 Hey, Elmer.

688
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,200
Julie, it's time
for your medicine.

689
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,000
There we go.

690
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,520
 You've got to
take that every day?

691
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,440
 Every day, twice a day.

692
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,600
 Ew.

693
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,520
 I don't mind.

694
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,400
 That's good.

695
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,800
You're my special girl.

696
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,960
 Elmer's special too, Daddy.

697
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,800
 Yeah, I bet he is.

698
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,200
So Elmer, uh, you
live around here?

699
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,480
 Um, not exactly.

700
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,520
 Are you just visiting
for the holidays?

701
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,680
 Yeah, that's it.

702
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,280
I'm just visiting
for the holidays.

703
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,040
JULIE: Um, he's here
from out of town.

704
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,520
 Way out of town.

705
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,960
 Yeah.

706
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,200
Another country, where
they don't know Christmas.

707
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,800
MAN: Uh-huh.

708
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,960
 So you don't mind if Elmer
stays for Christmas, do you?

709
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,040
I mean, you know, in the spirit
of foreign relations and all?

710
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,160
MAN: Um, sort of like
a cultural exchange?

711
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,360
It almost seems like it'd be
our patriotic duty, right?

712
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,280
 Yeah, that's just
I was thinking of.

713
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
 Uh-huh.

714
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,600
Well, let's see.

715
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,760
We got about an hour
before your appointment.

716
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,120
Uh, how would you like
some hot cocoa and eggs

717
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,960
with that cereal, Elmer, huh?

718
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,200
I mean, we don't
want you to think we

719
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,000
were bad hosts in this country.

720
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,920
ELMER: Sure.

721
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,480
I could eat a horse.

722
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,520
 I never met a
boy who couldn't.

723
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,160
Must be universal.

724
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,520
[music playing]

725
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,640
 Oh, dear.

726
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,720
 She's clean.

727
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,360
WOMAN: With Becca so preoccupied
and the weather the way

728
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,520
it is, and half the town
ignoring the holidays because

729
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,040
of the layoffs, I think I'm just
going to forget about Christmas

730
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,880
and go straight into
the spring cleaning.

731
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,920
[chuckling]

732
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,520
[sigh]

733
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,280
This place is gonna need it
after they get through with it.

734
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,960
MAN: There's no radiation
in the surrounding

735
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,480
areas or the fields, sir.

736
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,720
We checked the barn.

737
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,360
It's just some old
household furniture,

738
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,440
some farm tools, and some
broken down household

739
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,640
electrical appliances.

740
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,560
 Hey, I've been
meaning to fix those.

741
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,920
 Just a bunch of
junk, nothing special.

742
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,920
 That's what I thought.

743
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,600
It's almost always a hoax.

744
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,440
You know how these
small-town people are.

745
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,800
MAN: Yeah, imagine
extraterrestrials

746
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,520
traveling to Earth looking
for signs of intelligent life,

747
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,880
landing here.

748
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,640
[chuckling]

749
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,720
 Look, do another
routine sweep.

750
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,640
Fill out the reports.

751
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,840
Close out the file.

752
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,800
There's no UFOs here.

753
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,080
And let's pack it up.

754
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,680
Uh, we got to be in
Cleveland by noon.

755
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,280
Housewife claims
she has an alien dog

756
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,200
trapped in the basement.

757
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,960
 Yes, sir.

758
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,920
[glass rattling]

759
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,400
[spraying noise]

760
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,400
 Hey!

761
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,520
Hey, where you going?

762
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,720
I was gonna get a
follow-up story!

763
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,080
Wow.

764
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,360
Mom, can you believe it?

765
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,600
All this excitement
over my story.

766
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,080
When you see the power
of press in action,

767
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,400
doesn't it just
give you a chill?

768
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,240
 Well, it gives me something,
but I don't think it's a chill.

769
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,440
 Got to get a quote
from the mayor.

770
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,000
See ya!

771
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,160
[music playing]

772
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,760
 What?

773
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,960
 A little green man's, uh--

774
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,440
 I heard what he said!

775
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,880
Have you lost your mind?

776
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,440
 That's sure what it
looked like, Mayor.

777
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,960
 Perhaps your relatives have
arrived for the holidays.

778
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,120
 You let it get away.

779
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,560
What were you thinking, man?

780
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,240
IKE: Well, we were
kind of thinking

781
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,680
we might be disintegrated into
oblivion by some alien ray gun.

782
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,280
 Don't let him talk again, OK?

783
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,160
From now on, I want
him to shut up.

784
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,720
 Oh, why don't we take turn?

785
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,760
You shut up first, and we go
clockwise around the desk.

786
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,680
 Can it, Whitlock.

787
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,560
 Oh, that I could, sir.

788
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,640
 Well, now, Mayor, we hooked
up the little creature's,

789
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,760
uh, spacecraft and towed it to
the plant, just like you said.

790
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,880
 Then Sheriff, why
don't you get out there

791
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,880
and find whoever it is that
owns that flying contraption?

792
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,080
Put up an APB.

793
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,320
Put up a roadblock.

794
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,800
Send out a dragnet.

795
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,440
 How am I supposed
to do that, Mayor?

796
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,600
It's only Ike and I.

797
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,040
 I don't care how you do it.

798
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,280
You're the sheriff.

799
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,560
Now get out there
and find whatever

800
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,000
it is that's running
around before I lose

801
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,840
my chance at being re-elected.

802
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,200
And make sure I get one
good photo opportunity.

803
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,840
Re-elect Wellington, the
[inaudible] people's choice.

804
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,920
Not a bad campaign slogan, eh?

805
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,240
 Yeah, not bad.

806
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,720
SHERIFF: I thought you
were gonna shut up?

807
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,320
MAYOR WELLINGTON: So go on.

808
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,400
Get out there and find me
that alien or whatever it is.

809
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,680
I don't care if you have to
leave the planet to find him.

810
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,040
 Just when you thought it
was safe to leave the door

811
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,120
unlocked.

812
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,080
 Oh, uh, Mr. Slick.

813
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,880
I wasn't expecting you here at
just this particular moment.

814
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,200
I, uh, was just speaking
with-- the sheriff

815
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,920
and his deputy were
just apprising me

816
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,040
of how the progress
is, uh, going on

817
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,320
in-- in-- in the investigation.

818
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,000
Uh, Whitlock, get me a
glass of water, will you?

819
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,960
It's-- it's hot in here.

820
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,720
[elevator bell ringing]

821
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,440
Whitlock, don't
just stand there.

822
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
Get me some water.

823
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,000
WHITLOCK: Yes, sir, right away.

824
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,640
His water bowl must be empty.

825
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,440
May I help you, madam?
- Yes.

826
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,520
I'm Rebecca Rollins.

827
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,200
I'm the editor of the "Post."

828
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
I'd like to get a quote from the
mayor about the UFO sighting.

829
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,640
 The mayor is
groveling at the moment.

830
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,680
Would you care to wait?

831
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,640
 Sure.

832
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,560
Yeah, I can wait.

833
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,080
 Just relax for a while.

834
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,880
When he babbles, it always
takes him so much longer.

835
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,520
[elevator bell ringing]

836
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,800
MR. SLICK: How hard can it be
to find one little green man?

837
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,800
Those bumbling fools
couldn't find each other

838
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,800
with a flashlight and a map.

839
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,880
 I assure you, Mr. Slick, you
have nothing to worry about.

840
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,960
I'm on top of it.

841
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,360
 Roasting.

842
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,440
 On top of it.

843
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,000
I don't think so.

844
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,320
Why don't you watch--

845
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,760
oh.

846
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,640
Excuse me, my dear.

847
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,240
 It's all right, Mr. Slick.

848
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,040
 Yes.

849
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
[elevator bell ringing]

850
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,520
Come on!

851
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,920
 Little green man?

852
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,360
 You know, if one were
to look hard enough,

853
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,160
one might actually
find a real story

854
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,040
somewhere in all this drivel.

855
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,920
MAYOR WELLINGTON: Whitlock!

856
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,480
Why is it so hot in here?

857
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,040
 Would you mind telling the
mayor that I had to leave?

858
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
Um, pressing engagement.

859
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,240
 I live for it.

860
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,600
[sonar beeping]

861
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,720
 I did it!

862
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,640
I found it!

863
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,800
- Mm, mm, what?
- Yes!

864
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,680
There it is!

865
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,160
The [inaudible] glare.

866
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,720
 Ah, good look up.

867
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,680
 All right,
according to the map,

868
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,000
the sleigh touched down in--

869
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,040
Plantville?

870
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,280
 Ah, lovely down plant.

871
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,320
Mm, very quaint.

872
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,400
Wouldn't mind taking a
vacation there someday.

873
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,600
I always wanted to take a
tour of their plastics plant.

874
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,840
They are the leading producers
of synthetic foliage.

875
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,840
 I beg your pardon, sir.

876
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,120
 Oh, you know, plastic flowers.

877
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,000
Fascinating.

878
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,240
 If you say so, Santa.

879
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
But personally I
prefer the real thing.

880
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,360
 Of course, of
course, but try to get

881
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,040
a tulip to bloom at 20 below.

882
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,240
 I see your point.

883
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,600
But don't worry, sir.

884
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,800
I'll have helpers in the
area within the hour.

885
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,920
They'll recover that
sleigh and send it back,

886
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,000
along with that wayward elf.

887
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
[whistling]

888
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,760
 Oh.

889
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:25,320
Ah, El-- Ah, Eldwin.

890
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,080
 Impressive, aren't they, sir?

891
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,080
Been working with them
since Thanksgiving.

892
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,600
And now we're
ready to roll, sir!

893
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,760
 Sir!

894
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,320
 We're now on DELFCON two, sir!

895
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,720
That's tactic alert.

896
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,000
 Mhm.

897
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,800
Never mind, Eldwin.

898
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,800
This is something I need
to take care of myself.

899
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,520
 But, sir, you can't.

900
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,440
 Why not?

901
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,640
 It's not hear of.

902
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,880
It's Christmas.

903
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,960
You can't just
leave and trail off

904
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,560
after some selfish
inconsiderate elf.

905
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,200
 Eldwin, I'm surprised at you.

906
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,840
Elmer's a member of the family.

907
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,160
Everyone's entitled to sow
a wild oats now and again.

908
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,880
 But he's jeopardized
this entire Christmas.

909
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,160
What if something happens?

910
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,240
What if you don't
make it back in time?

911
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,560
We've got things to do.

912
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,760
 Eldwin, you're my most
loyal and qualified elf.

913
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,800
You've always taken
care of everything.

914
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,960
I have every confidence
in your ability to handle

915
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,360
anything that comes up.

916
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,480
And I'll be back
before you know it.

917
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,920
[laughter]

918
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,960
And we will discuss your
elf patrol when I get back.

919
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,960
[laughter]

920
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,280
 I know I should taken that
desk job with the Easter Bunny.

921
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,760
 The tree looks beautiful.

922
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,920
Now, momma, don't put
too much sugar in that.

923
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,840
 Oh, Joe.

924
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,400
Glad that you're back.

925
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,320
I made this list of all
the last minute things

926
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,160
we have to do before
the party for the kids

927
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,840
from the cancer ward.

928
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,560
And we've got to get started on
our special Christmas cookies.

929
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,800
You know, we better
bake about six dozen.

930
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,440
They go like hot cakes.

931
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,680
 Oh, sorry, can't mom.

932
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,240
I've got to stay on
top of this story.

933
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,960
I think it could be
better than I thought.

934
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,480
 But even the government
man said there's

935
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,880
nothing left to investigate.

936
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,960
 No, I overheard something
that could be great.

937
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,400
You see, it's all about timing
with these big city papers.

938
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,280
I finally have their attention.

939
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,280
All the cards have
been dealt in my favor.

940
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,040
If I want to ante up
with the big boys,

941
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,640
I have got to play my ace.

942
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,280
You cannot beat those odds.

943
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,200
 Well, let's place our bets.

944
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,640
 I think she's got
the winning ticket.

945
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,000
 Hmm, that smells good.

946
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,160
 Yeah.

947
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,480
 That's because
she takes after you.

948
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,880
 Yes, I'd like to speak to
the managing editor of the New

949
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,040
York National Reporter, please.

950
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,720
Yeah, this is Rebecca
Rollins calling.

951
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,120
Your paper carried my coverage
on this morning's national news

952
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,840
story about the UFO sighting.

953
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,120
Well, yeah, I have a resume.

954
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,320
It's right here in my bedroom.

955
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,800
I mean, my office.

956
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,680
I came fax that to
you in 10 minutes.

957
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,520
Well, thank you.

958
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,480
Thank you.

959
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,640
Goodbye.

960
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,520
Ahh, yes!

961
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,640
 Hey, Becky, I just
whipped up a big batch

962
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,080
of my orange cranberry
sauce surprise.

963
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,240
 Well, you better take it
easy on the peach brandy pot

964
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,560
because you have the only
80 proof condiment in town.

965
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,840
 That was my secret ingredient.

966
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,400
How did she know?

967
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,080
 Joe, everyone knows.

968
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,000
Your orange cranberry sauce
surprise is 20% cranberries

969
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,040
and 80% sauce, surprise.

970
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,040
[cracking]

971
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,240
 See anything, you and Ike?

972
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,040
 No.

973
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,520
Are you sure he went this way?

974
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,600
 Yes, deputy.

975
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,120
I'm sure he went his way.

976
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,280
Now, let's find those tracks.

977
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,440
Move it, deputy.

978
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,080
[camera shutter]

979
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,560
 Yeah, yeah.

980
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,680
If you could please
have Dr. Price call me.

981
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,880
It's very important.

982
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,800
 Daddy.

983
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,040
 Yeah, thank you.

984
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,840
Yeah, honey.

985
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,800
 Why are Sheriff
Ben and Deputy Ike

986
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,800
crawling around in our yard?

987
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,600
 What?

988
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,840
I don't know.

989
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,320
Seems like they're
looking for something.

990
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,800
 They're coming this way.

991
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,240
 It's probably widow
Delaney's cat got out again.

992
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,240
She keeps putting antlers
on them like a reindeer.

993
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,760
I don't blame them
for taking off.

994
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,600
 Will you give me a
little room, please?

995
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,520
And take off those glasses.

996
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,000
Excuse me.

997
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,360
[knocking]

998
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,920
 Good morning, Sheriff, Deputy.

999
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,000
 Good morning, Rick.

1000
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,800
 Delaney's cat get out again?

1001
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,960
 Huh?

1002
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,120
Oh, no, no.

1003
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,240
Not this time.

1004
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,400
We just stopped by to--

1005
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,520
well, we're sort of checking the
area to see if anyone has seen

1006
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,720
anything out of the ordinary.

1007
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,360
 Yeah, about this high,
green, riding a bicycle.

1008
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,120
 Green?

1009
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,280
Afraid not.
- Oh.

1010
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,040
 But if I see anything
green go by on a Schwinn,

1011
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,160
I'll give you a call.

1012
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,680
 Ah, we'd appreciate
that, yeah.

1013
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,400
Well, Merry Christmas.

1014
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,520
 Merry Christmas to you too.

1015
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,480
 Oh yeah Merry--

1016
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,280
 Come on, Ike.

1017
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,720
 What's the matter
with you, Ben?

1018
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,800
 He's hiding something.

1019
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,120
 Whoa.

1020
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,400
 What?

1021
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,680
What?

1022
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,800
 You just kind of
knew that, didn't you?

1023
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,080
 Yeah.

1024
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,200
 Yeah, like you've got a
sixth sense or something, huh?

1025
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,480
- Yeah, well.
- You're amazing.

1026
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,120
What do we do now, Ben?

1027
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,720
 Hide and watch, deputy.

1028
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,160
Hide and watch.

1029
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,880
 Hide and watch.

1030
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,680
 Let's go.

1031
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,960
 Jolie.

1032
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,720
Jolie.

1033
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:19,800
Hey.

1034
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,720
Come here.

1035
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,640
I want to talk to you.

1036
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I've got a funny feeling the
Sheriff's looking for Elmer.

1037
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Elmer ran away from
home, didn't he?

1038
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,840
 He sort of ran away.

1039
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,520
That's not why they're
looking for him.

1040
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:45,200
 Jolie, somebody must be
very worried about Elmer.

1041
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,760
 You don't understand, daddy.

1042
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:54,280
You see, Elmer's--
he's just special.

1043
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,600
 Hey, come here.

1044
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,760
Hey, now, I know you
want to help Elmer,

1045
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,440
but sometimes it's
not easy to tell

1046
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,000
what's right from
what's wrong, especially

1047
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,200
when it's your friend.

1048
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,120
Why don't you let
me talk to him.

1049
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,000
 He's gone, daddy.

1050
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,280
Only one of us have Christmas.

1051
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,880
I hope he comes back.

1052
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,160
 So do I, little one.

1053
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,960
 Oh, there's knobs
and tiles and switches.

1054
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,800
What the heck is
this thing here?

1055
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,120
Oh, it feels kind
of good in my hand.

1056
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,880
Look, I can see myself.

1057
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,480
I want to slick
you up, beautiful.

1058
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,720
This-- this is beautiful.

1059
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,040
Once I get my hands
on the Navigator

1060
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,400
of this convertible
monstrosity, hello Christmas!

1061
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,720
[maniacal laughter]

1062
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,200
Take me where I want to go!

1063
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,080
I'm dancer.

1064
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,520
I'm pancer.

1065
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,880
I'm Fido, Spock, what ever
the heck your names are,

1066
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,680
take me there!

1067
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,040
 Hm, looks like the Sheriff
didn't quite buy my story.

1068
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,400
[car starts]

1069
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,320
[music playing]

1070
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,920
What a lucky girl,
door to door service.

1071
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,080
 Hey, let's go, sweetie.

1072
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,320
 Nurse, where is
my wheelchair, huh?

1073
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,080
WOMAN 1: (OVER SPEAKER)
Attention x-ray,

1074
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,440
your pictures are ready.

1075
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,920
 Though she is
a very good girl.

1076
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,720
She can have a double portion
of her favorite ice cream.

1077
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,640
 Mint chocolate chip.

1078
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,640
 Mint chocolate chip.

1079
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,520
 And where do you
think you're going?

1080
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,080
 Official business, ma'am.

1081
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,360
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to step aside.

1082
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,040
 Well, you better
call for backup.

1083
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,000
 Ma'am, excuse me, but there's
someone really important we

1084
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,040
have to see in there right now.

1085
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,520
 Then have a seat.

1086
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,040
And when they're through,
I'll let them know

1087
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,080
you're waiting to see them.

1088
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,840
 Thank you.

1089
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,480
WOMAN 1: (OVER SPEAKER)
Would the surgical resident

1090
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,880
acquiring silverware, please
return it to the kitchen

1091
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,760
before lunch.

1092
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,600
Thank you.

1093
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,240
- Ben?
- What?

1094
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,120
What?

1095
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,080
 Hmm, hmm.

1096
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,960
 He gets.

1097
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,160
 Doesn't he look familiar, Ben?

1098
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,800
 Yeah.

1099
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,440
Now that you mention it, it does
look a little like somebody.

1100
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,800
Just can't quite put
my finger on who.

1101
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,040
 Maybe we saw him
on the post office.

1102
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,160
Maybe he's wanted.

1103
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,080
 I don't know.

1104
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,440
I don't know.

1105
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,400
But I think he's after
the same thing we are.

1106
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,280
 What do we do, Ben?

1107
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,640
 Ditch it.

1108
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,360
 Oh, you're so smart, Ben.

1109
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,280
 I don't want to go.

1110
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,160
 Come on.

1111
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,160
Come on.

1112
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,520
 Go, go, go.

1113
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,920
 Can you hear it?

1114
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:21,800
 Yeah.

1115
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,920
[heart beating]

1116
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,800
Does everyone's heart
sound like that?

1117
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,640
 Well, yours sort of
beats to its own rhythm,

1118
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,000
but we're going
to fix that soon.

1119
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,760
Could we talk outside?

1120
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,320
 Sure.

1121
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,880
OK, I'll be right back.

1122
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,240
You'll be OK for
a minute, honey?

1123
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,840
 Mhm.

1124
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,680
 Love you.

1125
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,000
 Elmer.

1126
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,480
Come out now, Elmer.

1127
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,160
 How did you know I was here?

1128
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,440
 Your galoshes squeak a little.

1129
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,520
 Even when I look
like a real boy,

1130
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,760
I'm still getting into trouble.

1131
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,560
 Want to listen?

1132
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,320
[heart beating]

1133
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,080
 Cool, you've got
a calypso thing.

1134
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,880
 The doctor wants to keep
her overnight for observation.

1135
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,240
 I had a feeling.

1136
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,240
I brought her stuff.

1137
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,320
Why don't we hear
from Dr. Price?

1138
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,320
There's got to be a way
to get his attention.

1139
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,040
He's the only one that
can really help her.

1140
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,960
 Well, I have a new plan.

1141
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,720
I'm going to inundate
his office with email

1142
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,880
every five minutes
until he responds.

1143
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,000
Rick, I can be a pretty
hard woman to ignore.

1144
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,760
 Thanks.

1145
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,080
 I was worried
about you, Elmer.

1146
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,280
I thought that
they had found you

1147
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,880
and you were going
to miss Christmas.

1148
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,720
 They followed me here,
but I gave them the slip.

1149
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,440
 You're going to get to
make your Christmas wish.

1150
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,240
I promise.

1151
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,000
 Now.

1152
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,920
 Oops, busted.

1153
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,560
 Elmer, how'd you get here?

1154
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,960
 Daddy, please don't
make Elmer leave.

1155
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,880
He needs our help.

1156
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,120
Please, daddy, please.

1157
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,480
 Shh, shh, Jolie.

1158
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,120
It's all right,
don't get excited.

1159
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,920
Elmer can stay for now.

1160
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,800
 Promise?

1161
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,040
 Yeah, I promise.

1162
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,440
But I need the truth.

1163
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,880
You have to tell me
where Elmer belongs.

1164
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,000
 Daddy, Elmer's
special because he's

1165
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,280
really one of Santa's elves.

1166
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,360
 I see.

1167
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,680
 No, daddy.
It's true.

1168
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,520
You can even ask him.
- OK, all right, baby.

1169
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,240
You just promise
to take it easy.

1170
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,680
 I promise.

1171
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,480
Will you mail this for me?

1172
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,520
Just sort of a follow-up letter.

1173
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,200
You don't think I'm
too late, do you?

1174
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,400
 Nope.

1175
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,280
I'm sure it will get
to Santa on time.

1176
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,360
 OK, let's get you settled.

1177
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,440
 I'll be right outside, baby.

1178
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,800
 Come on, how do you know--

1179
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,680
Come on, honey.

1180
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,720
 I don't care.

1181
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,720
I don't want you, mom.

1182
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,480
 Timmy, you still want
that astro robot warrior

1183
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,920
you asked for for Christmas?

1184
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,400
 Yeah.

1185
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,520
 Don't push your luck, son.

1186
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,400
 Why does Jolie
have to stay here?

1187
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,000
 Because the doctors
have to keep an eye on her

1188
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,640
for a little while.

1189
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,600
She needs a new heart, Elmer.

1190
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,360
And the doctors
wanted her to get

1191
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,960
a little older, grow
a little bigger,

1192
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,600
but now she may not
be able to wait.

1193
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,400
 But if she can then they're
going to give her a new heart

1194
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,640
anyway, right?

1195
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,000
 Well, she's on a list.

1196
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,640
She's on a very long list.

1197
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,320
And the doctor in Miami who can
help her is very, very busy.

1198
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,880
 I didn't know it'd
be so hard to be a kid.

1199
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,080
I remember this.

1200
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,040
Christmas two years ago.

1201
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,600
Dear Eldwin taught
me to make animals.

1202
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,080
One ear's a little
shorter than the other.

1203
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,200
She really likes this rabbit?

1204
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,440
 She can't go to
sleep without it.

1205
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,600
 Never knew it
would mean so much.

1206
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,560
 Some things are very important
to Jolie, especially Christmas.

1207
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,320
And she really believes
you're one of Santa's elves.

1208
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,560
I don't want her to be
disappointed, Elmer.

1209
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,920
Do you?

1210
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,000
 I think a lot of kids
might be disappointed.

1211
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
 I think you better set
things right with her.

1212
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,840
 Yeah, this isn't turning out
to be one of the best plans.

1213
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,240
Mr. Evans, do you
believe in Christmas?

1214
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,040
 Sometimes it isn't easy.

1215
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,720
 OK, Elmer, get the let out.

1216
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,320
It's Christmas Eve.

1217
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,920
You've got to get Santa's
sleigh back to the North Pole

1218
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,200
or Jolie will be
so disappointed.

1219
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,200
I've got three hours left
to do a good deed if you

1220
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,520
want to become a real boy.

1221
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,080
 You're hiding
something, Rick Evans.

1222
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,080
 Oh, I'm fine.

1223
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,200
Thank you very much for asking.

1224
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,960
And how are you today, Rebecca?

1225
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,040
 What's the scoop, Rick?

1226
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,760
 How'd you find out about him?

1227
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,480
 I'm a reporter, remember?

1228
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,920
 Come on, I mean,
you don't really think

1229
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,920
this is newsworthy, do you?

1230
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,600
 Are you kidding.

1231
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,040
This is my shot at more national
headlines, front page photos.

1232
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,320
A chance like this comes
once in a lifetime.

1233
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,000
This is my shot at the big time.

1234
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,280
 Big time, what are
you talking about?

1235
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,120
 Don't hold out on me, Rick?

1236
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,120
Besides, if the Sheriff,
his deputy, the mayor,

1237
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,160
and Randolph Slick are all
after this little alien, well,

1238
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,040
then, so am I.

1239
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,200
 Alien?

1240
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,080
Why not.

1241
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,080
Jolie thinks he's an elf.

1242
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,400
 An elf.

1243
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,360
 Yes, sounds almost
as ridiculous as alien.

1244
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,480
Look, Rebecca, all
I'm trying to do

1245
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,600
is keep my daughter's new
friend, Elmer, out of trouble.

1246
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,000
And then find some way to
get the attention of a doctor

1247
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,320
in Miami before it's too late.

1248
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,360
My daughter needs a new heart.

1249
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,440
 Who's Elmer?

1250
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,240
 What's that look for?

1251
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,400
You've been talking to
my dad, haven't you?

1252
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,080
 I didn't know
you were so sick.

1253
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:28,880
 I feel OK.

1254
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,960
 I've got to figure
out how to get

1255
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,520
Santa's sleigh back, some how.

1256
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,520
 What about your wish?

1257
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,360
We don't have much time left.

1258
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,480
No, no, no!
No pictures!

1259
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,360
That will ruin everything.

1260
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,720
Run, Elmer, run!

1261
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,560
 That's him!

1262
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,880
Which way did he go?

1263
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,800
 Who?

1264
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,680
 The alien.

1265
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,960
The-- the elf.

1266
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:15,840
 Elmer?

1267
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,760
 Whatever.

1268
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,720
Did he come this way?

1269
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,640
 She's gone.

1270
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,320
Jolie's gone.

1271
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,000
 Oh, no.

1272
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,800
She's gone after him.

1273
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,080
 Got ya!

1274
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:45,560
[screaming]

1275
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,520
 Santa's sled!

1276
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,000
There's no time.

1277
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
 Open the truck.

1278
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,440
I've got him.

1279
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,520
Hurry up, Ike.

1280
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,400
Get in!

1281
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,400
Get in!

1282
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,360
We've got him.

1283
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,320
We've got him.

1284
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,320
We've got him.

1285
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,080
 Let's get out of here.

1286
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,960
 Now they made me angry.

1287
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,560
Randolph Slick, I
should have known.

1288
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,720
Been on my naughty list
since you were 12 years old.

1289
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,760
Well, I'll be.

1290
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,600
You've got yourself into
a fine mess this time.

1291
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,640
 Ahh, yes!

1292
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,320
This is it, my big
photo opportunity.

1293
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,360
Sheriff, would
you do the honors?

1294
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,200
Stand up, you.

1295
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,000
Well, what do you think,
this my good side?

1296
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,640
 Oh, very nice, mayor.

1297
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,280
Where is Whitlock
when you need him.

1298
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,720
 Take several, I'm going to
use these for campaign posters.

1299
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,600
Of course, one for
mommy, she'll like that.

1300
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,280
 But what about Christmas?

1301
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,520
What about all the kids
who won't have presents?

1302
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,680
 Deputy, I assure you
I haven't the faintest

1303
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,480
idea what you're talking about.

1304
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,640
 He's talking about
me stealing Christmas.

1305
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,840
No sleigh, no presents.

1306
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,560
And you, you unlucky
little gnome,

1307
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,480
I'll use you to ransom all
the presents for myself.

1308
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:08,280
And the entire world will know
what it's like not to receive

1309
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,640
Christmas presents, like I did.

1310
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,520
[whimper]

1311
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,840
 Oh, well, as long as
it doesn't involve me.

1312
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,080
Oh, that reminds me,
cash would be fine.

1313
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:27,240
 Actually, there's
been a change in plans.

1314
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,760
 I beg your pardon.

1315
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,320
 I've decided not to sell
the land for toxic waste.

1316
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,280
I've decided to turn the
whole plant into a memorial.

1317
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,440
The entire world will buy
a ticket to see Santa's

1318
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,160
Sleigh and the last elf.

1319
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,800
The demise of Christmas
will be historic.

1320
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,640
And my name will be
on everyone's lips.

1321
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,080
 But you--

1322
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,840
But what about our deal?

1323
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,200
You can't do this!

1324
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,440
 On the contrary,
I can do anything.

1325
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,400
I'm Randolph P. Slick.

1326
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:02,080
And I don't need you anymore.

1327
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,360
Merry Christmas.

1328
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,320
 Wait!

1329
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,040
I can sell tickets.

1330
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,600
I'll make all of my
relatives buy one.

1331
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,200
I have a very large family.

1332
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,840
How do you think
I got to be mayor?

1333
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,840
Slick, come back here!

1334
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,880
 I don't know, Ben.

1335
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,080
I don't like this.

1336
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,320
I don't like this at all.

1337
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,600
 You just keep an eye on him.

1338
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,240
 Oh, dear.

1339
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,920
Oh, dear.

1340
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,000
Why did I ever let him go alone?

1341
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Oh, dear.

1342
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,560
We should be loading by now.

1343
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,000
It's Christmas Eve.

1344
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,080
No Sleigh.

1345
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,640
No Santa.

1346
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,400
If I don't hear
from something soon,

1347
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,480
I may have to cancel Christmas.

1348
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,240
How am I ever going
to fix this one?

1349
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,480
Oh.

1350
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,640
I'll be voted out
of the Elves Lodge.

1351
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,200
I'll have to turn in my hat.

1352
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:08,200
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

1353
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,240
 Psst, Elmer.

1354
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,040
Psst.

1355
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,560
 Jolie, what are
you doing here?

1356
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,400
You're supposed to
be in the hospital.

1357
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,240
 They don't keep you.

1358
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,120
You only have two hours left.

1359
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,040
 Jolie, Mr. Slick is
planning on ruining Christmas.

1360
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,520
He's not going to
give the sleigh back.

1361
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,720
And he's going to
make Santa give

1362
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,200
up all the Christmas presents.

1363
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,640
We have to stop him.

1364
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,160
 I was so sure
they'd come back here.

1365
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,640
Where could they be?

1366
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,040
This is all my fault.

1367
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,720
 Rick, if I hadn't taken
that picture of Elmer,

1368
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,200
he never would have run off.

1369
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,080
I was just thinking of myself.

1370
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,080
Rick, we're going to find him.

1371
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,080
[sigh]

1372
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,080
[honking]

1373
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:49,880
What's that?

1374
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,560
 Looking for an elf
and the little girl?

1375
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:02,440
Come with me.

1376
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,480
 I can't leave
without Santa's sleigh.

1377
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,400
 Hey!

1378
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,880
Ben.

1379
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,840
Hey, Ben.

1380
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:47,720
They got loose.

1381
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,720
 What are you doing, Ike!

1382
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,320
 Wait, wait, wait!

1383
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,200
[grunting]

1384
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,280
 Which way are they going?

1385
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,880
[grunting]

1386
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,680
 There they go!

1387
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,160
Wait!

1388
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,640
[screaming]

1389
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,240
 There they are!

1390
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,120
Wait a minute!

1391
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:52,120
[grunting]

1392
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,560
[crashing]

1393
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,560
[grunting]

1394
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,040
 Hey!

1395
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,600
 Whoa!

1396
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,600
 Jolie, are you OK?

1397
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,600
 You have to help us!

1398
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,600
We've got to go!

1399
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,400
Come on!

1400
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,640
 My gosh, he really is an elf.

1401
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,560
 No.

1402
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,800
No pictures.

1403
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,000
Everyone finds out
Elmer's an elf,

1404
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,640
he won't be able
to make his wish.

1405
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,560
 I need to do a good deed.

1406
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,160
 Why would Slick do this?

1407
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,840
 He wants to steal
Christmas, daddy.

1408
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,600
 Yeah, instead of selling the
plant into a toxic waste site,

1409
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,720
he's going to make
it into a memorial.

1410
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,640
And people will buy tickets to
see what's left of Christmas.

1411
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,560
Me.

1412
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,240
 Toxic waste site.

1413
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,840
What happened to
reopening the plant?

1414
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,120
That must be the story that
Whitlock's been talking about.

1415
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:31,880
 Stand back.

1416
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,240
Straighten it out, Elmer.

1417
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,880
 Where do you think
that laundry driver went?

1418
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,800
 I don't know, but we've
got to get out of here.

1419
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,400
How do you find a good deed
for an elf by half past noon.

1420
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:47,320
 When in doubt,
ask another elf.

1421
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:49,080
 Let's get out of here, Elmer.

1422
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:49,920
Let's go.

1423
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,280
 Oh, I don't know
which is left or right.

1424
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,480
See if you can figure that out.

1425
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,280
 Every year we've
been through this.

1426
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,000
 Mom, dad.

1427
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,560
Could you use another elf
who needs to do a good deed?

1428
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,120
 Oh.

1429
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,240
He's real.

1430
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:12,360
And you're in charge of gifts.

1431
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:17,280
Children, Santa is working very
hard preparing for his busiest

1432
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:21,480
night of the year, so he
sent us his favorite elf

1433
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,680
to bring these special gifts.

1434
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,600
 Me?

1435
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,080
 Yes, you.

1436
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,520
You still have a few minutes
left to do a good deed.

1437
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,440
 Do I get one?

1438
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,440
Do I get one?

1439
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,240
Wow!

1440
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:53,960
 Thank you.

1441
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,520
 Thank you.

1442
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,400
 Thank you.

1443
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,400
 You did a good deed, Elmer.

1444
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,240
Now you can make your Christmas
wish and become a real boy.

1445
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,240
 Well, I think my good deed
will slip by in a technicality,

1446
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,640
but something still
doesn't feel right.

1447
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,360
I still got Santa's sleigh.

1448
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,200
I wish Santa was here.

1449
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,800
He'd know what to do.

1450
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,680
 I'm never far away, Elmer.

1451
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,720
 Santa, how'd you get here?

1452
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:33,600
 Two buses, a plane,
and a laundry truck.

1453
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,560
 Oh my gosh.

1454
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,080
[camera shutter]

1455
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,880
 I really made a mess of
things this time, huh, Santa?

1456
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,880
Now there won't
be any Christmas.

1457
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,080
 Nonsense, Elmer.

1458
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:50,160
Ground, no one can stop
Christmas, not even Mr. Slick.

1459
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:54,240
 --over there having a good
time without my permission.

1460
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:59,440
Someone has stolen my
sleigh and my little elf.

1461
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,680
 I beg your pardon.

1462
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,680
That's my sleigh
and that is my elf.

1463
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,640
 Ow, ow, ow.

1464
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,080
 At least for the moment.

1465
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,120
 But-- But I--

1466
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,440
 You've been a pain ever
since the seventh grade,

1467
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:20,440
Randolph Percival Slick, a
toxic waste dump, really?

1468
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:24,520
Stealing my sleigh and
holding Elmer here for ransom.

1469
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,880
You've really done
it this time, Randy.

1470
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,000
That plastics plant is
going to reopen as planned.

1471
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,840
And I think we're
going to be turning out

1472
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:36,640
toys, lots and lots of toys.

1473
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,160
My elves could use the help.

1474
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,040
[cheering]

1475
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:39,960
 It'll never happen!

1476
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,720
Never happen!

1477
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:46,640
 And if I get one
bad report, I'm

1478
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,640
going to send Eldwin and his elf
patrol down here to kick some,

1479
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,080
you know what.

1480
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,960
Got it?
- Yes, sir.

1481
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,320
 And as mayor,
I can assure you,

1482
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,520
Santa, if Mr. Slick has
any other shenanigans

1483
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:04,520
up his sleeve, well, I'll
be sure to tell you first.

1484
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,240
As mayor it's my
duty and my privilege

1485
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,520
to see to the protection
of these fine citizens

1486
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,800
of this fine town.

1487
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:19,600
And as I'm re-elected, I promise
you all a chicken in every pot,

1488
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,160
a car in every garage--

1489
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:25,240
 You put a sock in
it, you old wind bag.

1490
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,680
 Are you talking to me?

1491
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,120
 Nobody else is blubbering.

1492
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,120
Oh, by the way, I quit.

1493
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,280
 Quit?

1494
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,600
You can't quit.

1495
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,160
How will I ever run a
reelection campaign?

1496
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:37,840
 With any luck, it
will be impossible.

1497
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,480
Merry Christmas, you old toad.

1498
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,400
[laughter]

1499
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,600
[applause]

1500
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,800
 And I think this belongs
to a friend of yours.

1501
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,640
 Now I know what you
meant about giving, Santa.

1502
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,320
The gift I really
want to give I can't.

1503
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:13,360
 Never say I can't.
You have to believe.

1504
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,120
 There's nothing left.

1505
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:26,720
I wasted it.

1506
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,200
Santa, I'm no good with magic.

1507
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,160
It always seems to backfire.

1508
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,440
This is just way too important.

1509
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:38,640
 Well, this bag is nothing
but tinsel and stardust.

1510
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,440
True magic comes from in here.

1511
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,720
Always has.

1512
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:47,960
You have to believe
to have more magic.

1513
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:53,320
Hmm, don't think with your
head, think with your heart.

1514
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:56,960
How can I best help Jolie?

1515
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,120
 I'd give her my
heart if I could.

1516
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:03,600
I just wish that doctor in
Miami would make time for her,

1517
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,160
to see how special she is.

1518
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,240
And who's going to pay
attention to some boy like me?

1519
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,160
 Right.

1520
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,600
Oh, boy.

1521
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,480
 Wait.

1522
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,000
I'm not a boy.

1523
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,400
I'm an elf.

1524
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,680
I'm an elf.

1525
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:24,720
I'm a short, pointy-eared
elf from the North Pole.

1526
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:28,640
Who could ignore a live
honest to gosh elf?

1527
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,760
 But what about
your wish, Elmer?

1528
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,440
It's half past 2:00, you have
to make a wish right now.

1529
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,880
 Not now, I won't
be special anymore.

1530
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:39,280
 You have to decide now, Elmer.

1531
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,800
 Elmer.

1532
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,120
 Jolie, you're my
only best friend.

1533
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,320
Would you still like me
if I'm not a real boy?

1534
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,320
 Of course, Elmer.

1535
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,000
I knew you'd change your mind.

1536
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,600
Besides, I feel extra special
when my best friend is an elf.

1537
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,960
What did you wish for?

1538
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,480
 Well, let's just say
that doctor in Miami

1539
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,360
will never know what
hit him when he sees

1540
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,440
the Christmas day headline.

1541
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,200
 Say cheese.

1542
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,600
Well, I got to go.

1543
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,280
I've got a deadline.

1544
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,680
This is the biggest story the
Plantville Post has ever seen--

1545
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,120
that anybody has ever seen.

1546
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,600
 So I guess you can look
for your name in the big city

1547
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,320
headlines for sure.

1548
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,720
 Well, maybe not right away.

1549
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,360
There are a lot of really
important things for me

1550
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:28,000
to write about right here.

1551
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
 Well, folks, we're going
to have to be leaving.

1552
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,120
Oh, I almost forgot.

1553
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,720
Your letter, I received
it there, Jolie.

1554
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:39,720
This is what you asked for.

1555
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,320
 A present for me, really?

1556
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,440
I love it.

1557
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,800
It reminds me of home.

1558
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,720
I thought it might.

1559
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,880
 Well, when I left home
Rudolph had the sniffles,

1560
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,160
and that always
affects his aim, even

1561
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:08,800
with the new radar and stuff.

1562
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,400
So I'm going to be needing
a navigator this trip.

1563
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,080
You think you'd
like the job, Elmer?

1564
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,000
 Me?

1565
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,720
See the world?

1566
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:18,640
 Mhm.

1567
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,400
 You bet.

1568
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,640
I guess this means goodbye.

1569
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,840
 Promise to visit?

1570
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,680
 I'll be there when
you get your new heart.

1571
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,080
 Well, folks, we
have to be taking off.

1572
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:43,920
 Oh, Santa, I want you to
try some of my surprise sauce.

1573
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,200
 Thank you.

1574
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,120
Bye, everybody.

1575
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,880
 Bye, everybody.

1576
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,400
We have toys to deliver.

1577
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,280
 Bye, Elmer.

1578
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,200
Bye, Santa.

1579
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,360
 Merry Christmas, everyone.

1580
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,560
 Merry Christmas to you too.

1581
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:06,000
[flying off]

1582
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,600
Look at that.

1583
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,480
 Oh, that's beautiful.

1584
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:16,960
 It's snowing.

1585
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,560
 You picked a
great spot, honey.

1586
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,880
 Yeah, perfect
place to recuperate.

1587
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,200
 You were right, Elmer.

1588
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,600
A vacation in the sun
should be mandatory

1589
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,840
for every one of my elves.

1590
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:06,760
 No snow.

1591
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,360
 Oh, oh, I'm turning pink.

1592
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,440
[sneeze]

1593
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,320
[laughter]

1594
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:25,040
[music playing]
