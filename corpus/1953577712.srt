1
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,490
It was
unmistakable--

2
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:48,735
a wolf raising its stem and stern,

3
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:51,934
its sail dripped blood-red.

4
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:55,838
These things served
but one purpose--

5
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:59,544
to strike fear and
terror into the hearts

6
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:02,086
of any who came across them.

7
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:13,231
Each stroke, each painful breath...

8
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:18,833
they believed it brought them ever
closer to the ends of the earth.

9
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:25,476
But onward they pushed, for the
ends of the earth they sought.

10
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:33,612
Gloria, honor, these
things awaited them there.

11
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:41,259
But so did something else.

12
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:47,968
The waters have stilled,
the winds have died.

13
00:03:48,741 --> 00:03:51,505
I suspect her sight to be true.

14
00:03:52,146 --> 00:03:54,739
That, or we're near the abyss.

15
00:03:56,084 --> 00:04:01,544
Lyngvi, lost land of legend and fable,

16
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:04,350
we found it, Baldur.

17
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,784
Of that you can be certain.

18
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,954
Aye. If the night proves
your woman to be wrong again,

19
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:13,898
she'll find herself rowing
for 20 men on the morrow.

20
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:17,200
Have faith, Ulfrich,

21
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:20,435
for if Freyja's led us
to Midgard's edge for

22
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:23,001
nothing more than gloom and fog,

23
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:25,308
I'll gladly take your
place upon the rail.

24
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:29,649
Or at least Thor will.

25
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,824
The eyes of the wolf moon point
the way with Frigg¡¦s distaff.

26
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:36,859
That they do.

27
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:39,754
Our destiny may lie on these shores.

28
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:46,234
It's still your oar
to row upon our return.

29
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:48,864
If we return, eldest.

30
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:52,372
No Northman has dared
sail this far before.

31
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:55,381
We shall claim this island
and all it bears for our own.

32
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:59,510
And if Northmen have sailed here before?

33
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:01,721
Well, then we'll take it anyway.

34
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:05,388
This land may yet prove our kingdom.

35
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:07,862
Forgive me, brother.

36
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:09,860
Your kingdom.

37
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:11,328
Aye.

38
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:13,635
Father will be pleased.

39
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,064
Perhaps he'll give it to Ulfrich.

40
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:21,868
The weather here seems
to suit his temperament.

41
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:32,187
Disappointed there's
nobody here to greet us?

42
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:34,888
No army to grind to the ground?

43
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,122
No,

44
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:39,763
it's just a strange sensation,

45
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:42,931
almost as if I've been here before.

46
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:45,506
Have you ever known such a thing, Sif?

47
00:06:45,507 --> 00:06:47,405
Some say such feelings are of

48
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,914
long-forgotten memories
of our past lives.

49
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:52,910
So, tell me, Freyja,

50
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:54,849
does your foresight extend back as well?

51
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:56,814
On occasion.

52
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:59,719
Well, if I lived before,
that means I died as well,

53
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,759
a mistake I won't be making twice.

54
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,552
Don't encourage him, wife.

55
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:06,460
Thor's already too eager
to ride with the Valkyries.

56
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:10,462
You'll find your path to the
gates of Valhalla soon enough,

57
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,437
whether it be here or some
other godforsaken land.

58
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:15,635
But what of your path, brother?

59
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:18,273
It's to look after
you, of course--

60
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:20,143
make sure you don't die
before your proper time.

61
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:24,078
- Aegir!
- Aye.

62
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:26,581
Go with Thor and scout the shoreline.

63
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:30,121
I'll expect you both back within
an hour with enough food for 20 men.

64
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:32,055
More if you plan to eat as well.

65
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:43,565
That's one man

66
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:46,108
who will never know the
dishonor of growing old.

67
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:47,200
Aye.

68
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:50,475
Sail with Thor long enough,
we'll all be spared from it.

69
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:57,620
Forgive me. I forgot my place.

70
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:01,721
Remind me. Where is it?

71
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,993
By your side. Always.

72
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:10,400
Then there's nothin' to forgive.

73
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,967
One day, I'll be a king,

74
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:17,144
and you my queen.

75
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:20,943
Take care not to forget
that as well, hmm?

76
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:31,651
Be mindful of them.

77
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:34,023
It's a dangerous game they play.

78
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:35,860
Sif and Ulfrich?

79
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:39,228
You know very well who I speak of.

80
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:41,862
You can't deny nature.

81
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:44,408
And Thor's
that--

82
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:46,672
a force of nature,
if I've ever seen one.

83
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:52,848
I haven't known such dreariness since

84
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:55,219
spending an evening alone with Ulfrich.

85
00:08:56,258 --> 00:09:00,285
It can only mean we've entered
the realm of the frost giants.

86
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:04,297
Well, if we've truly
crossed into the mist world,

87
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:07,631
then Sol herself would be hard
pressed to shine her light this far.

88
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:10,496
And if you honestly
believe we're the first men

89
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:13,064
fool enough to venture this far, then

90
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:14,633
I believe it as well.

91
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:20,245
Who goes there?

92
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,352
Do you expect the deer to respond?

93
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:26,821
Or the rabbit, perhaps?

94
00:09:29,663 --> 00:09:31,653
Let's unmask your stalker.

95
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:51,976
Aegir!

96
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:53,949
Aegir!

97
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:56,180
Aegir!

98
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:04,264
So, tell me, Freyja,

99
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:07,330
what do you expect we'll find here?

100
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:11,039
Gods? Giants? Monsters?

101
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:14,274
I want a piece of them all.

102
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,484
Well, careful now, Bragi,
or a piece you may have.

103
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,018
Your imagination exceeds
that of even Thor¡¦s.

104
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,988
I suspect we'll find little
more than lonely trees and

105
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:27,424
some scattered rocks
in this miserable place.

106
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,378
So much for trees and rocks.

107
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,492
Thor!

108
00:10:57,128 --> 00:10:58,060
What's wrong?

109
00:10:58,061 --> 00:10:59,993
- Where's Aegir?
- Speak, man.

110
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:01,826
He's been taken.

111
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,835
- Taken? by who?
- By a great beast.

112
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:06,904
I--it moved like
a wolf, but...

113
00:11:06,905 --> 00:11:09,032
but not like a wolf
I'd ever seen before--

114
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:12,134
easily the size of a
man, but maybe larger.

115
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:13,645
And you left Aegir to them?

116
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:17,414
No, I followed him until I lost 'em.

117
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:20,384
I'd have been lost,
too, had I continued.

118
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:22,612
They led me into a trap.

119
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,126
- I barely escaped with my life.
- Then we've little time.

120
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:28,159
Hodur, Tyr, Geirrod,

121
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,090
mind the ship and the women.

122
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:32,166
They can busy themselves with the ship.

123
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,896
We'll mind ourselves. Sif?

124
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:38,372
Well, come on, then.

125
00:11:38,644 --> 00:11:40,668
Nothing the lot of us can't handle.

126
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,979
Set the tents?

127
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:50,082
Let's see what they find.
Our stay may be brief.

128
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:21,486
If Aegir died, I only hope he died well.

129
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,188
If he's dead, envy him.

130
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,861
He sits in the great hall drinking

131
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:30,900
Lerad's mead while we freeze our stones.

132
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:33,967
Aegir couldn't drink for piss.

133
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:36,499
They'll send his ass back

134
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,509
when he can't finish
the horn in three drafts.

135
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:53,257
What is it?

136
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,857
Nothing.

137
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:07,038
Tracks.

138
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:09,702
Look at their size.

139
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,941
Ah, it's animal just the same.

140
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,547
Baldur?

141
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:18,320
These tracks are laid in twos.

142
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:20,784
Tell me, Ulfrich,

143
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,756
what animal walks on just two legs?

144
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:35,665
You may get your monsters after all.

145
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,502
Fabled isle, eh?

146
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:07,566
You can keep it.

147
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:12,713
I don't understand.

148
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,283
I truly believed it our destiny
to discover a new kingdom.

149
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:25,489
Thor, if you're ever to
rule or lead, you must learn

150
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,295
to forsake such things in
the face of greater needs.

151
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:30,264
Aegir is your kinsman.

152
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:33,132
What say we find him, if
only to provide the rites?

153
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:36,200
Expanding our kingdom we'll leave
for another time and place, huh?

154
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:40,107
This is why you lead, Baldur.

155
00:14:45,655 --> 00:14:47,713
You're right about one thing, brother.

156
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:50,123
There is something on this island,

157
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:52,692
and it doesn't much like men.

158
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:04,804
- What is it, Freyja?
- Do you sense something?

159
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,670
Only suffering and death.

160
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:10,071
This place has known both.

161
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:14,217
Well, you don't need the
sight to figure that one out.

162
00:15:15,421 --> 00:15:16,683
Wait, there's something in there.

163
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,692
- Stand back.
- Ulfrich, wait!

164
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:39,805
By the skalds.

165
00:15:40,151 --> 00:15:42,516
I've no words for that stench.

166
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:51,694
It's all right.

167
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:54,455
- It's all right.
- No, it's not. It's not all right.

168
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:57,127
- You must leave at once.
- We're not here to hurt you.

169
00:15:58,505 --> 00:15:59,835
But the others are.

170
00:16:12,187 --> 00:16:13,619
Forgive our manners.

171
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:17,085
It's been months since
we've had real food.

172
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:19,587
My name is Hel.

173
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,995
This is Garmur.

174
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:25,991
How is it you've survived if
you haven't left this hall?

175
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:30,196
Grubs, worms-- whatever
the dirt provides.

176
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,501
The better question is how
did you know of this island?

177
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:34,976
- What brought you here?
- Thor.

178
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:37,708
- And where from? Where do you hail?
- Thor!

179
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:40,347
Please continue.

180
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:43,083
We came from Faroer.

181
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:46,519
Explorers you could say,
though misguided to be sure.

182
00:16:47,427 --> 00:16:50,953
We were seduced by the
stories of gods and giants.

183
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:53,925
So we sought the isle of the immortals.

184
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:58,603
In the end, I suspect we
made the same mistake you did.

185
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:00,929
What mistake?

186
00:17:01,642 --> 00:17:02,939
Coming here.

187
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,009
So you were attacked by
these same wolves as well?

188
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:11,649
Shortly after we first arrived.

189
00:17:12,223 --> 00:17:15,315
We would have left, but we'd
already stripped our boat for wood.

190
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:17,783
It wasn't long after we were forced to

191
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:20,489
reinforce the walls with
whatever we could find.

192
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:21,898
And then?

193
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:26,529
And then we prayed they wouldn't get in.

194
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:28,864
Those are not creatures of this realm.

195
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:32,799
Not one night passes without the
howl of those demons at our door.

196
00:17:33,246 --> 00:17:34,507
Please,

197
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:38,171
I beg of you, leave this
place while you still can.

198
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:40,948
Take us with you.
Before they return.

199
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:44,083
Ah, I've heard enough.

200
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,289
Ulfrich.

201
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:51,953
Ulfrich!

202
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,397
What's the matter with
you? Where are you going?

203
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:58,769
We shouldn't be sittin' here
listenin' to such absurd tales--

204
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:01,768
creatures from other realms? Demons?

205
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:05,281
Aegir is still out
there. He may yet live.

206
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,813
Thor saw one of these
things with his own eyes.

207
00:18:07,814 --> 00:18:10,580
You yourself saw the damage
inflicted on that skull.

208
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:14,823
Oversized wolves. Nothing more.

209
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,918
A meal that will finally fight back.

210
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:21,097
Well, I say bring them on.

211
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:24,861
Until we know what we're
up against, we would do well

212
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:26,735
to heed that woman's warning.

213
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,473
What's more, these
people are our cousins.

214
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,270
These people are not our cousins.

215
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:36,575
Hiding? eating grubs?

216
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:38,843
They are weak and pathetic
and of no consequence--

217
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:41,183
whether you like it or not,
they are north men just the same.

218
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:46,151
Waste your time with 'em if you like.

219
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:47,796
I'm goin' after Aegir.

220
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:50,091
Hermoid, Heimdall, with me!

221
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:54,164
You forget your place, Ulfrich.

222
00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:04,971
Forgive me...

223
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:07,143
Brother.

224
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:11,485
You ask for that which is not needed.

225
00:19:13,894 --> 00:19:14,882
You're right.

226
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:18,655
Borr, Bragi. The rest
of us will continue on.

227
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,300
You and your brothers will
stay here and guard the village.

228
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:22,699
With our lives, Baldur.

229
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,967
We should hope it won't come to that.

230
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:19,322
Thor.

231
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,465
What ails you?

232
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:26,306
...felt like fire was
coursing through my veins.

233
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,301
I can't explain it.

234
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:30,844
It was as if I was dreaming,
yet I did not sleep.

235
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:34,078
What did you see?

236
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:36,977
A great warrior!

237
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:40,783
A poisoned sky, a sea
serpent of unimaginable size.

238
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:45,593
This warrior, did he
wield a strange weapon?

239
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:47,993
A hammer.

240
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:51,398
Yet it was a hammer I'd never
laid my eyes upon before.

241
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:53,271
How do you know of this?

242
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:56,771
I believe you saw...

243
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:59,676
the hammer of the gods.

244
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:04,373
Of course.

245
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:08,149
The warrior, he bore a serpent shield.

246
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:11,891
Believe it was you, brother.

247
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:16,494
Oh, yeah, clearly,

248
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,968
as Baldur alone wears the serpent.

249
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,936
Now, are we here to find our kinsmen,

250
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:27,135
or sit here debating the
meaning of Thor's dreams?

251
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:38,079
You all right?

252
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,312
You're wearing a hole in the earth.

253
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:04,749
Apologies if my duties
are arousing your slumber.

254
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,184
Be still, if you're so sorry.

255
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:32,117
Did you hear that?

256
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,321
There it is again.

257
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:44,191
Bragi, did
you see any--

258
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,762
by the giants. Must you do that?

259
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,503
I'll happily return to
my post if you'll shut--

260
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,009
where'd the others go?

261
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:11,824
Njord!

262
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:16,364
Tonight...

263
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:19,904
we drink at Odin¡¦s side, Borr!

264
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:23,236
Let's not keep him waiting!

265
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:30,517
Baldur!

266
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,051
What?

267
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,321
Borr, Bragi!

268
00:23:41,164 --> 00:23:42,152
Do you really think?

269
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,732
Everyone back to the village. now!

270
00:23:45,536 --> 00:23:46,466
Hel!

271
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,569
Garmur!

272
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,729
Garmur!

273
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,035
We're too late. They've been taken.

274
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,044
Four men, dragged away by wolves?

275
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:29,747
I told you. These are not
wolves as you and I have known.

276
00:24:31,455 --> 00:24:34,788
Hel, Garmur, show
yourselves if you still live!

277
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:48,264
I'm so sorry.

278
00:24:48,642 --> 00:24:50,165
There was nothing we could do.

279
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:54,009
Everyone inside!

280
00:24:58,885 --> 00:25:00,352
Everyone.

281
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,665
Clearly, these are not simple wolves.

282
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:20,741
This is an enemy unlike
any we've ever known,

283
00:25:21,044 --> 00:25:23,205
and a situation none of
us could have foreseen,

284
00:25:23,747 --> 00:25:25,236
not even you, Freyja.

285
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:28,612
Or you, Thor.

286
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:32,750
We're only here 'cause of my
damn notions of glory and destiny.

287
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:34,818
Sentiment is noble, youngest,

288
00:25:35,728 --> 00:25:37,991
but the burden lies
solely on my shoulders.

289
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:39,820
I brought us here, not you.

290
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,858
That's all fine and good, Baldur,

291
00:25:43,136 --> 00:25:44,624
but what are we gonna do now?

292
00:25:44,937 --> 00:25:46,666
I've already told you.

293
00:25:47,141 --> 00:25:48,367
We need to leave.

294
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:52,234
No. We should fight these
things with our full force,

295
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:54,573
before they thin our ranks any further.

296
00:25:55,383 --> 00:25:58,784
If you listened to me before, Borr
and his brothers would still live.

297
00:25:58,785 --> 00:26:00,822
Mind your words, Ulfrich.

298
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,353
Baldur might tolerate your insolence,

299
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:06,087
but I have neither his
patience nor his virtue.

300
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,193
We have underestimated
these wolves once.

301
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,832
Not again.

302
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,470
We're going back to the ship.

303
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,434
We're to leave, then?

304
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:18,909
No.

305
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,469
We're not going anywhere
until we find the others.

306
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,143
We'll collect those at the
beach, and once we're 14 strong,

307
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:28,219
we'll come back, find our kinsmen,

308
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,446
and kill anything that gets in our way.

309
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:31,750
And what of these people?

310
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:34,056
They survived without us for months.

311
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:36,156
Let them survive another few days.

312
00:27:06,831 --> 00:27:07,763
Thor!

313
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:12,594
Give him room, woman.

314
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,402
What is it now, brother?

315
00:27:17,877 --> 00:27:20,743
I'm beginning to think you
have no threshold for pain.

316
00:27:20,744 --> 00:27:22,244
Another vision?

317
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:25,074
Worse this time.

318
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,415
Much stronger.

319
00:27:28,723 --> 00:27:31,157
Baldur slaying another monster?

320
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,058
Not exactly!

321
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:37,793
He was standing there

322
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:40,059
at the mountain's peak.

323
00:27:40,803 --> 00:27:44,067
He held the hammer to the heavens
and called down the lightning itself.

324
00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:45,931
I felt the lightning.

325
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,744
And it burned through
me like Sol's flame.

326
00:27:50,347 --> 00:27:51,438
Thor.

327
00:27:51,816 --> 00:27:55,546
I believe these visions are
leading you to the hammer.

328
00:27:57,021 --> 00:28:00,513
It's up there somewhere
on that very mountain.

329
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,755
The visions may be mine,

330
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:06,094
but the hammer's for Baldur
alone there...

331
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:08,427
to find.

332
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,664
We'll come back for you.

333
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:16,432
Not till we've vanquished
all these creatures.

334
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:20,541
And find my hammer.

335
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,243
Your hammer?

336
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:28,421
Let's make haste,
you flat-footed mares!

337
00:28:42,673 --> 00:28:44,300
They've been gone for hours.

338
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:47,376
Safe to say they've either
ventured inland for the night

339
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,175
or they're dead.

340
00:28:50,249 --> 00:28:52,341
Either way we'll be
needing the tent, then.

341
00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:54,742
Freyja, you and Geirrod see to it.

342
00:28:54,987 --> 00:28:58,115
Tyr, you and I will go
find something worth eating.

343
00:28:58,925 --> 00:29:02,019
I'm sure we can find something
without having to wander too far.

344
00:29:10,738 --> 00:29:12,170
- What is it?
- Thor!

345
00:29:14,944 --> 00:29:16,103
A man!

346
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:17,471
Long dead.

347
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:21,412
Imagine being so frightened
as to choose dishonorable death

348
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:23,075
rather than face what lay beneath.

349
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,980
I damn nearly can.

350
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:28,421
I pray none of us
face such a dim choice.

351
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,096
These visions of yours,

352
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:43,868
I don't believe they're of Baldur.

353
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,174
Baldur is the greatest
warrior I've ever known.

354
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:49,406
How could you of all
people question this?

355
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:50,948
Because...

356
00:29:51,585 --> 00:29:53,917
I have foreseen his destiny.

357
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,054
And?

358
00:29:55,257 --> 00:29:57,281
It lies along another path.

359
00:29:58,494 --> 00:29:59,550
Well...

360
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:01,325
you're wrong.

361
00:30:01,563 --> 00:30:02,621
You'll see.

362
00:30:02,622 --> 00:30:04,164
Now, forget this nonsense and move.

363
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,810
Is it wise venturing
back into these woods

364
00:30:15,811 --> 00:30:17,972
after what happened to Thor and Aegir?

365
00:30:17,973 --> 00:30:19,481
A man's got to eat.

366
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:22,450
I'm not going hungry on
account of a few wolves.

367
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,654
If anything, I'll feast on them.

368
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:29,421
Tyr?

369
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:33,562
Get up, you lazy bag of bones.

370
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:37,892
Odin's fury.

371
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,271
Come on, you. Time to
meet the end of my blade.

372
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,181
Thokk's tears.

373
00:31:00,496 --> 00:31:03,192
I knew Hodur and Tyr wouldn't
let that spit go to waste.

374
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:06,161
Go give them a hand with the kill.

375
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:08,936
And hurry up already.

376
00:31:11,843 --> 00:31:12,969
Hodur!

377
00:31:13,678 --> 00:31:14,975
I'm ravenous.

378
00:31:22,456 --> 00:31:23,387
Geirrod?

379
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:37,064
Not good.

380
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:54,789
No!

381
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:05,128
I can't believe it!

382
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:06,800
Believe It.

383
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:09,365
We're pretty well wracked now.

384
00:32:10,843 --> 00:32:12,537
How? How?

385
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:15,672
How do wolves take
entire ships, I ask you?

386
00:32:16,383 --> 00:32:18,943
Thor, did you happen to
see a vision about that?

387
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,884
Don't take your fury out on Thor.

388
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:22,419
This isn't his doing.

389
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:25,887
You told me earlier if I wanted to lead,

390
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:28,758
I needed to set aside my
selfishness and think of others.

391
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:32,091
Let me do that now, Baldur.

392
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:37,669
It is clear to me now that we
are not alone on this island,

393
00:32:37,908 --> 00:32:41,537
and I'm not speaking of
demon wolves or puny villages.

394
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:45,841
There's something going on here.

395
00:32:46,217 --> 00:32:47,309
Agreed.

396
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:51,183
If we find our friends, I
believe we'll find our ship.

397
00:32:52,157 --> 00:32:54,920
That's the first sensible
thing you've said this day.

398
00:32:56,629 --> 00:32:58,391
It'll be dark soon.

399
00:32:59,065 --> 00:33:00,998
Let's gather our supplies,

400
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:02,962
make our way back to the village.

401
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:05,804
We camp there tonight.

402
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:08,941
We take back what's ours tomorrow.

403
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:31,423
Here we are.

404
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,676
I don't understand.

405
00:33:41,948 --> 00:33:43,105
Where'd they go?

406
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:47,348
Did they flee? Or attempt to catch us?

407
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:49,785
Perhaps they were
attacked and finally taken.

408
00:33:50,891 --> 00:33:55,124
They survive on their own for months,
only to succumb the day we arrive?

409
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,818
Exactly.

410
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:58,891
Something's not right.

411
00:33:58,892 --> 00:34:01,025
If they were taken, why no blood?

412
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:04,671
We believe there to be
something else to this.

413
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,740
I think we're getting
closer to the truth.

414
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:08,170
But what truth?

415
00:34:08,377 --> 00:34:10,037
I still don't understand.

416
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:11,678
Nor do I.

417
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,838
Only somehow these people play a part.

418
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,314
In the meantime, the sun is nearly set.

419
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:18,215
We'll prepare to stay the night here.

420
00:34:18,216 --> 00:34:20,381
I despise the notion of hiding.

421
00:34:20,382 --> 00:34:21,821
There's no honor in it.

422
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:24,286
We risk drawing the
ire of the Valkyries.

423
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,157
He's right.

424
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:28,091
I'd rather go down fighting.

425
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,268
Aye. Or we'll never see Valhalla.

426
00:34:32,038 --> 00:34:34,130
How well do you see
in the dark, Hermiod?

427
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:36,003
Or you, Heimdall? As well as a wolf?

428
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:39,609
They've been preying on the fact
that they can thin our numbers

429
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,203
and catch us off guard.

430
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:43,315
Well, no longer!

431
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:46,047
We will hold this position tonight,

432
00:34:46,254 --> 00:34:47,584
but make no mistake.

433
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,747
We won't be hiding.

434
00:34:49,825 --> 00:34:53,020
If they're fool enough
to try and overtake us,

435
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:54,153
they'll fail.

436
00:34:54,154 --> 00:34:55,523
And then tomorrow?

437
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,187
We will bring the fight to them!

438
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:58,730
For odin!

439
00:35:42,885 --> 00:35:44,407
- For odin!
- For odin!

440
00:36:04,443 --> 00:36:05,999
To honor the soon dead.

441
00:37:31,442 --> 00:37:33,238
They dragged away their dead.

442
00:37:33,444 --> 00:37:34,808
Not all!

443
00:37:39,184 --> 00:37:41,242
But will they dare return?

444
00:37:41,453 --> 00:37:43,421
They're fare no better.

445
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:45,512
We'll crush them into the ground!

446
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,220
You fought well today, brother.

447
00:37:49,462 --> 00:37:51,258
It's a shame you didn't die.

448
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:53,991
Not before my proper time.

449
00:37:54,701 --> 00:37:56,634
Skirnir did die well.

450
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,529
We'll need a vessel for the ash.

451
00:39:04,514 --> 00:39:06,573
Baldur, you must see this at once.

452
00:39:09,386 --> 00:39:11,546
What in Odin¡¦s name?

453
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:14,722
I was hoping you could give
me some insight into that.

454
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,830
Creatures that revert back to men,

455
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:27,196
such sorcery should not be possible.

456
00:39:27,706 --> 00:39:30,539
You never believed the villagers,
surely you believe your own eyes.

457
00:39:30,811 --> 00:39:32,937
Thor cut down no man today, only beast.

458
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:35,873
And yet here a man's head rests.

459
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,912
Those damn villagers may be right,

460
00:39:37,913 --> 00:39:39,953
but they don't know half
of the horrible truth.

461
00:39:39,954 --> 00:39:42,181
The creatures walked
amongst them as well.

462
00:39:42,891 --> 00:39:44,323
But I recognize this man.

463
00:39:44,324 --> 00:39:46,085
He was here in this very hall.

464
00:39:46,895 --> 00:39:49,591
He's right. I'd never
forget this man's face,

465
00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:51,255
but I'd sure like to try.

466
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,560
Must this be in here?

467
00:39:52,902 --> 00:39:54,960
Hermiod, do something with this.

468
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:56,129
What exactly?

469
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,968
Anything. Just get it out of here.

470
00:39:58,442 --> 00:40:00,569
I believe it's far worse
than you imagine, Thor.

471
00:40:01,278 --> 00:40:03,007
The urn, what was so special about it?

472
00:40:03,008 --> 00:40:04,874
It bore an encryption on the inside.

473
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,517
And what did it say?
Before you broke it.

474
00:40:08,587 --> 00:40:10,851
Beware the sons of Loki.

475
00:40:12,258 --> 00:40:14,020
- The God.
- The trickster.

476
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:15,458
- The same.
- What do you think it means?

477
00:40:15,661 --> 00:40:17,185
Loki had
two sons--

478
00:40:17,186 --> 00:40:21,131
Jormungand, the Midgard
serpent, and Fenris, the wolf.

479
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:22,964
Jormungand,

480
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:25,064
that's what I saw in my vision.

481
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:28,204
That's the snake that Baldur's
gonna slay with the hammer.

482
00:40:29,077 --> 00:40:30,806
One thing at a time, youngest.

483
00:40:30,807 --> 00:40:32,605
I'm more concerned with this wolf.

484
00:40:32,606 --> 00:40:36,046
It said the blood of Fenris
will grant everlasting life

485
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:38,312
and the ability to
shape-shift like Loki.

486
00:40:38,314 --> 00:40:41,481
Wait, you're saying the
villagers were the wolf creatures?

487
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:43,388
They were one and the same all along?

488
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:45,451
And just a fraction of
them, from what we've seen.

489
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:47,318
None of this seems real.

490
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,489
Shall I fetch back the head?

491
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,563
You sought out the gods, Freyja.

492
00:40:51,903 --> 00:40:53,369
Appears we've found them.

493
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,426
So what now?

494
00:40:55,173 --> 00:40:57,640
Tomorrow we find out if
all your visions are true,

495
00:40:57,842 --> 00:41:00,003
or just the ones that
get us into trouble.

496
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:32,405
He waits to see you.

497
00:41:40,892 --> 00:41:43,086
The invaders still persist.

498
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:46,786
They have proven most
determined and most formidable.

499
00:41:48,134 --> 00:41:50,498
There is one among
them, a young warrior,

500
00:41:50,499 --> 00:41:52,798
he fights like no man I've ever seen.

501
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:56,466
They now quest for the hammer.

502
00:41:58,011 --> 00:41:59,477
Forgive me.

503
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,804
I have failed you.

504
00:42:01,805 --> 00:42:05,349
So, the warrior has returned.

505
00:42:05,686 --> 00:42:08,985
Bring him to me. Kill the others.

506
00:42:09,191 --> 00:42:12,353
Do not fail me again.

507
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,909
Tell me, Northman,

508
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:35,609
why is the one known as Ulfrich
in disfavor with the others

509
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,484
if he is eldest?

510
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:41,292
Why does this Baldur lead in his place?

511
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:46,765
Skoll.

512
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,465
Should I call on Hati as well?

513
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,711
You've got a warrior's spirit.

514
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:03,373
You deserve to die holding your sword.

515
00:43:03,853 --> 00:43:05,843
If you only had arms.

516
00:43:11,595 --> 00:43:13,756
How talkative are you feeling?

517
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:17,966
More than your friend, I hope.

518
00:43:19,704 --> 00:43:20,897
His mother.

519
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,335
Yes?

520
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,672
A thrall from the south.

521
00:43:26,945 --> 00:43:28,071
A slave girl.

522
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:31,109
A bastard son.

523
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,876
Intriguing.

524
00:43:35,022 --> 00:43:36,386
Thank You.

525
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:56,776
What you lookin' for?

526
00:43:56,777 --> 00:43:58,881
Grubs? Worms?

527
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:04,019
No, I'm retracing my steps,
learning from my mistakes.

528
00:44:04,556 --> 00:44:05,782
There.

529
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,991
I favored my spear side
too heavily during a lunge.

530
00:44:09,695 --> 00:44:11,423
I'm no good with spears.

531
00:44:11,629 --> 00:44:13,529
I prefer shorter weapons, I believe.

532
00:44:15,334 --> 00:44:17,528
You really just lookin' at dirt?

533
00:44:19,072 --> 00:44:22,098
What else weighs on
that mind of yours, Thor?

534
00:44:24,345 --> 00:44:26,073
It's just dirt, Sif.

535
00:44:26,814 --> 00:44:28,111
It's dirt.

536
00:44:28,783 --> 00:44:30,181
Thor!

537
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,110
I warned you

538
00:44:35,112 --> 00:44:36,384
for the last time.

539
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:37,957
You're stirring yourself over nothing.

540
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:40,851
Stolen glances.

541
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:42,428
Hidden touches.

542
00:44:43,065 --> 00:44:45,225
I've seen my fair share of nothin'

543
00:44:45,736 --> 00:44:46,997
from you, Sif,

544
00:44:48,672 --> 00:44:50,605
and you, brother.

545
00:44:54,746 --> 00:44:56,576
Have you nothin' to say for yourself?

546
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:01,681
At least have the self
respect to deny it, woman.

547
00:45:04,523 --> 00:45:06,956
Then you leave me no choice.

548
00:45:09,462 --> 00:45:11,122
I challenge you, Thor.

549
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:12,959
Here?

550
00:45:13,266 --> 00:45:15,234
Now you can't be serious.

551
00:45:15,836 --> 00:45:17,302
I'd raise your sword, brother.

552
00:45:17,303 --> 00:45:18,803
I believe he is.

553
00:45:19,473 --> 00:45:21,303
Are you just gonna stand
back and do nothin'?

554
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,501
Deferring to one's younger
brother is humiliation enough.

555
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:26,478
Don't expect you to
understand such things.

556
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:29,110
I'm not gonna lose my woman as well.

557
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:32,211
Don't do this, Ulfrich.

558
00:45:32,212 --> 00:45:35,517
The days of you tellin'
me what to do are over.

559
00:45:39,897 --> 00:45:41,625
Prepare yourself.

560
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:45,905
Do you really believe this is what we
should be concerning ourselves with?

561
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:00,687
Enough!

562
00:48:03,393 --> 00:48:04,949
How dare you?

563
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:06,970
You dishonor the codes.

564
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,081
You speak of honor and codes when you
challenge your own brother?

565
00:48:12,813 --> 00:48:14,377
You know nothing of these.

566
00:48:16,464 --> 00:48:21,156
Oh I see. I am your brother
when the purpose suits you.

567
00:48:23,557 --> 00:48:26,267
We don't have time for
petty squabbles!

568
00:48:27,312 --> 00:48:29,501
These demons could return
at any moment.

569
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,654
Ulfrich!

570
00:48:40,141 --> 00:48:44,207
I hope you grow old...
and rot together.

571
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:46,502
Please, Ulfrich, you can't leave.

572
00:48:51,509 --> 00:48:55,888
No, Baldur, that's one thing I can do.

573
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,018
Ulfrich!

574
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:04,233
Sif, give him time.
He'll be back.

575
00:49:04,548 --> 00:49:08,092
But what of the wolves?
He's not safe.

576
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:11,743
He's made his decision,
as we all must.

577
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:15,290
We'll give him an hour to return.

578
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:17,794
If he's not back by then,
we move out.

579
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:26,450
We can't afford to lose a man
of Ulfrich's skill.

580
00:49:26,452 --> 00:49:28,537
That's not what concerns me.

581
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:32,918
What concerns me is if that skill
were turned against us now.

582
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:02,719
Stay back.

583
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:04,692
I mean you no harm.

584
00:50:05,232 --> 00:50:07,393
We gave you a chance to leave.

585
00:50:07,636 --> 00:50:09,067
Two, actually.

586
00:50:09,503 --> 00:50:11,368
You lied to us, demon.

587
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:15,807
I may have left out some details,
but what I told you was true enough.

588
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:19,244
Northmen came to this
isle seeking the gods.

589
00:50:19,245 --> 00:50:22,515
Well, they've found them.

590
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:27,514
I see now destiny has brought you
here for a reason, Lord Ulfrich.

591
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,819
Stop speakin' in riddles.

592
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,268
Why did you want us to leave,

593
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:35,191
and what is this destiny
of which you speak?

594
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,293
You'll have all the answers in due time.

595
00:50:38,295 --> 00:50:40,095
All you need to know now

596
00:50:40,097 --> 00:50:42,935
is I can offer you the
things you've always wanted

597
00:50:42,936 --> 00:50:44,941
and always been denied.

598
00:50:46,212 --> 00:50:47,370
Go on.

599
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,343
Come with me and drink from his blood,

600
00:50:50,344 --> 00:50:54,080
and you'll not only have
power and immortality,

601
00:50:54,588 --> 00:50:58,353
but a woman who treats you the
way you deserve to be treated,

602
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,117
like a king.

603
00:51:01,495 --> 00:51:02,688
Whose blood?

604
00:51:02,898 --> 00:51:04,125
Fenris?

605
00:51:07,035 --> 00:51:08,866
And what would you require in return?

606
00:51:15,178 --> 00:51:17,646
Nothing you wouldn't give.

607
00:51:20,317 --> 00:51:21,681
Willingly.

608
00:51:44,979 --> 00:51:46,672
No point in wallowing.

609
00:51:46,914 --> 00:51:48,402
We're all to blame.

610
00:51:49,118 --> 00:51:50,515
He'll come around.

611
00:51:51,887 --> 00:51:53,114
Or he won't.

612
00:51:54,021 --> 00:51:55,488
Comforting.

613
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:57,958
Would you prefer I'd
let them kill each other?

614
00:51:57,959 --> 00:51:59,525
'Course not.

615
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:01,520
Well, take comfort in that.

616
00:52:01,998 --> 00:52:03,260
It's all I've got.

617
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:10,829
Unless you wanna spend
another night here,

618
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,702
I suggest we get moving.

619
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,177
Thor, any new visions
we should know about?

620
00:52:18,817 --> 00:52:20,409
All I know is we need to go there.

621
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:24,387
Then there we'll go,

622
00:52:24,691 --> 00:52:27,920
and if the god's will it, we'll
cross paths with Ulfrich again.

623
00:52:51,387 --> 00:52:52,718
What is it, Thor?

624
00:52:53,322 --> 00:52:54,846
I'm uncertain,

625
00:52:54,847 --> 00:52:56,549
'cause there's something...

626
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,924
familiar about this place.

627
00:52:59,229 --> 00:53:01,823
- We were here just yesterday.
- No, no, it's not that.

628
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:05,057
I can't quite explain it.

629
00:53:06,038 --> 00:53:07,561
How far do you think it?

630
00:53:08,607 --> 00:53:10,836
Nearly a day's journey to
the base of the mountain.

631
00:53:13,313 --> 00:53:14,938
I don't know how I know that,

632
00:53:15,181 --> 00:53:16,374
but I do.

633
00:53:16,616 --> 00:53:17,878
Let's get moving, then.

634
00:53:29,732 --> 00:53:30,992
Stop!

635
00:53:31,867 --> 00:53:32,891
On your guard.

636
00:53:32,892 --> 00:53:34,661
I fear we're no longer alone.

637
00:53:48,686 --> 00:53:49,709
Ulfrich?

638
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:52,716
Brother, tell me you're not
in league with these demons.

639
00:53:56,496 --> 00:53:59,429
Ah, spare me your reproach, Baldur.

640
00:53:59,998 --> 00:54:02,263
I was little more than a servant to you.

641
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:07,132
Little more than nothin' to you.

642
00:54:09,043 --> 00:54:10,942
It doesn't have to end like this.

643
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,813
I concur, youngest.

644
00:54:15,082 --> 00:54:18,211
Come with us, Thor,
and the others may go.

645
00:54:18,212 --> 00:54:20,479
You'll find your ship
awaits you at the shore.

646
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:21,982
No.

647
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,416
It's just a trick,

648
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:26,017
another way to thin our
ranks. Keep the line, Thor.

649
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:28,526
I've nothing against Hermiod or Heimdall

650
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:30,626
or even Freyja.

651
00:54:30,627 --> 00:54:32,258
But make no mistake!

652
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:36,703
This is your last chance to leave this
place with your sword in your hand.

653
00:54:42,247 --> 00:54:44,874
When you reach the
river of blood, Baldur,

654
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:46,744
remember this moment,

655
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,425
the moment you failed
to follow your pride,

656
00:54:50,469 --> 00:54:53,983
the moment you damned yourself
and everyone you loved.

657
00:54:53,984 --> 00:54:55,185
Run.

658
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,555
- Run! Get them out of here.
- Go!

659
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:04,125
My entire life I have hated you.

660
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:08,068
Then you better summon it all.

661
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,466
- Baldur!
- Freyja, let's move!

662
00:55:45,418 --> 00:55:46,544
Run!

663
00:55:48,523 --> 00:55:49,749
Run!

664
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,348
Take Thor.

665
00:55:53,762 --> 00:55:55,126
Kill the rest.

666
00:56:47,122 --> 00:56:49,090
Baldur, no!

667
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,505
Go!

668
00:57:48,858 --> 00:57:51,384
We have to keep moving!
Can't afford to stop!

669
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,952
No, we can't afford not to.

670
00:57:53,698 --> 00:57:55,461
They'll catch up to us soon,

671
00:57:55,462 --> 00:57:57,659
and then Baldur's sacrifice
will have meant nothing.

672
00:57:58,036 --> 00:57:59,731
Well, what would you suggest?

673
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,332
We'll use their strength
and speed against them.

674
00:58:04,709 --> 00:58:08,645
We'll channel them down this slope,
and then they won't be able to stop

675
00:58:08,646 --> 00:58:10,204
until they're met by our steel.

676
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:13,782
We set a trap for them this time.

677
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:16,513
You're damned right.
We don't have much time.

678
00:59:21,465 --> 00:59:24,558
Gaze upon your destiny, Ulfrich!

679
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,535
For this sword shall cleave
your head from its shoulders

680
00:59:28,536 --> 00:59:31,768
- before this day is through!
- We'll See.

681
00:59:32,243 --> 00:59:33,766
We'll See.

682
00:59:39,252 --> 00:59:41,811
I never believed him
capable of such things.

683
00:59:42,254 --> 00:59:43,448
We should follow.

684
00:59:43,657 --> 00:59:46,056
He can't escape what's
coming to him now.

685
00:59:46,258 --> 00:59:47,885
They didn't collect their dead.

686
00:59:49,597 --> 00:59:52,622
I don't believe these beasts can
truly be killed like you or I.

687
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,693
- They bleed well enough.
- That much is certain,

688
00:59:55,694 --> 00:59:59,135
but I saw one with a paw that
looked like it was growing back.

689
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:01,964
No matter how many we think we kill,

690
01:00:02,177 --> 01:00:04,508
they just get back up
again once they've healed.

691
01:00:06,048 --> 01:00:07,743
I know of no living thing,

692
01:00:07,744 --> 01:00:11,150
beast, man, or god that
heals from a severed head.

693
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:04,907
These sons of the bitch.

694
01:01:11,224 --> 01:01:14,658
I didn't survive all this
time just to die like this.

695
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,324
Where are you from, old man?

696
01:01:16,996 --> 01:01:19,430
We voyaged here several months ago,

697
01:01:19,431 --> 01:01:21,295
built a small village even,

698
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,126
but then they attacked.

699
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,503
We were just looking for a new home.

700
01:01:26,439 --> 01:01:27,930
Now I'm
afraid I'm--

701
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:29,938
I'm all that's left of my people.

702
01:01:30,245 --> 01:01:32,473
Forgive us if we've
heard that one before.

703
01:01:32,747 --> 01:01:34,303
It's just another trick.

704
01:01:34,682 --> 01:01:36,649
- Kill him!
- No! Wait! Wait!

705
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:38,015
I, I...

706
01:01:38,016 --> 01:01:39,516
I can prove it.

707
01:01:39,517 --> 01:01:40,679
I can prove it!

708
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,790
Th--these creatures, their
limbs, they grow back,

709
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,985
so take one of my fingers.

710
01:01:46,395 --> 01:01:49,762
Take one of my fingers. If it
grows back, so strike me down.

711
01:01:50,701 --> 01:01:53,134
No, it's all right. Just do it quick.

712
01:01:59,677 --> 01:02:02,169
Remind me to apologize
if I don't kill you.

713
01:02:02,448 --> 01:02:05,974
When you do, apologize that is,

714
01:02:05,975 --> 01:02:08,016
the name is Vali.

715
01:02:08,321 --> 01:02:10,220
If what you say is true,

716
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:12,551
how is it you've survived all this time?

717
01:02:12,552 --> 01:02:15,660
I haven't left the protection
of the tree for months.

718
01:02:15,661 --> 01:02:18,663
Apparently it's a theme on this island.

719
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,264
Well, let's move.

720
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:22,026
We're wasting time.

721
01:02:22,027 --> 01:02:24,333
We are leaving, aren't we?

722
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,870
Not until we kill everything
on this entire island.

723
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,470
Move!

724
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:39,152
So, you plan to retrieve Mjolnir,

725
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,484
the hammer of the gods.

726
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:46,121
How do you know of the hammer?

727
01:02:47,098 --> 01:02:51,535
You youngsters, you never make time
anymore for the old stories, do you?

728
01:02:52,538 --> 01:02:55,438
No one ever makes time for
the old stories anymore.

729
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:58,269
Vali.

730
01:02:59,546 --> 01:03:02,844
They say the hammer fell from the sky,

731
01:03:03,216 --> 01:03:05,980
a mighty gift from Odin himself,

732
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:10,215
its power so great that only
one mortal man could harness it.

733
01:03:12,193 --> 01:03:13,319
Baldur.

734
01:03:13,762 --> 01:03:16,594
His name has been lost through the ages,

735
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:19,327
but he already wielded it once.

736
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:22,495
It is said he will
return and wield it again.

737
01:03:24,407 --> 01:03:25,873
Don't you see?

738
01:03:26,176 --> 01:03:27,369
Baldur will return.

739
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,705
Let me finish.

740
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,274
Please.

741
01:03:32,917 --> 01:03:34,976
Loki had
two sons--

742
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,145
Jormangand and Fenris, we know.

743
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,255
But did you know that Jormungand

744
01:03:39,256 --> 01:03:42,351
was felled on this very
island by the great champion?

745
01:03:42,995 --> 01:03:46,191
He struck down upon him with the hammer,

746
01:03:46,667 --> 01:03:49,658
but not before the great
serpent had bit him.

747
01:03:50,771 --> 01:03:53,899
So he was victorious,
but at terrible cost--

748
01:03:54,142 --> 01:03:55,732
his life.

749
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:59,877
Odin was pleased, though,
so it was prophesied

750
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:02,445
- this champion would one day return
- Can't resist!

751
01:04:02,446 --> 01:04:05,418
And reclaim his place amongst the gods.

752
01:04:06,589 --> 01:04:08,249
Don't let go, Thor.

753
01:04:08,857 --> 01:04:10,687
You must see it through.

754
01:04:11,696 --> 01:04:14,595
See the warrior's true identity!

755
01:04:15,131 --> 01:04:17,257
Face your destiny!

756
01:04:17,668 --> 01:04:19,190
No!

757
01:04:25,277 --> 01:04:26,833
Thor, can you speak?

758
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:28,970
It's not possible.

759
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,975
Who did you see?

760
01:04:32,117 --> 01:04:35,886
It was me... all along, not Baldur.

761
01:04:37,057 --> 01:04:38,784
But I don't understand it.

762
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:40,924
It doesn't make any sense.

763
01:04:41,495 --> 01:04:43,793
Baldur is dead, Thor.

764
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:47,498
It's hard to believe, I know,

765
01:04:47,901 --> 01:04:52,201
but you must finally accept
that you were the chosen warrior.

766
01:04:55,144 --> 01:04:57,008
You were the champion.

767
01:04:57,947 --> 01:04:59,470
And you still can be.

768
01:05:03,553 --> 01:05:05,543
That's why they wanted you.

769
01:05:06,823 --> 01:05:08,290
Fenris.

770
01:05:09,327 --> 01:05:11,556
I killed his brother, so
he killed both of mine.

771
01:05:11,962 --> 01:05:17,162
He and his minions, they live
here in mortal fear of the hammer,

772
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:21,169
the only thing in existence that
can truly end their immortality,

773
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:23,299
so they guard it, ever vigilant,

774
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,367
for all times against...

775
01:05:27,982 --> 01:05:29,675
Your return.

776
01:05:31,151 --> 01:05:34,143
But he can't resist his
desires for vengeance.

777
01:05:34,355 --> 01:05:36,050
He means to kill you,

778
01:05:36,591 --> 01:05:39,491
even if it puts his own life at risk.

779
01:05:40,462 --> 01:05:42,293
Well, he'll have his chance.

780
01:05:43,432 --> 01:05:44,899
Thank you, Freyja.

781
01:05:45,335 --> 01:05:46,528
I'm in debt to you.

782
01:05:48,105 --> 01:05:50,729
And you, can you fight?

783
01:05:52,076 --> 01:05:54,703
I'm middle-aged. I'm not dead.

784
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,977
Well then, the hammer awaits.

785
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:09,191
- We'll never get through that way.
- We'll die trying.

786
01:06:09,193 --> 01:06:10,318
Wait.

787
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:11,827
There's another way.

788
01:06:12,832 --> 01:06:14,197
We'll go around.

789
01:06:14,868 --> 01:06:16,095
Show us.

790
01:06:18,305 --> 01:06:19,329
Come here.

791
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:40,724
I guess your people weren't
the first ones here, either.

792
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,628
Our ship is down there somewhere.

793
01:06:43,629 --> 01:06:44,961
There, I can see it.

794
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:48,866
Secured for departure.

795
01:06:55,047 --> 01:06:56,240
Let's move.

796
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:21,603
Could have stabbed you in the back.

797
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,742
Sneakin' around, Thor,

798
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:27,780
that's not very becoming.

799
01:07:28,985 --> 01:07:32,681
Probably nothin' new for you or Sif.

800
01:07:33,858 --> 01:07:34,915
Vali!

801
01:07:35,594 --> 01:07:37,389
Take them through the passage.

802
01:07:38,463 --> 01:07:39,623
Sif!

803
01:07:39,897 --> 01:07:41,524
Find our friends.

804
01:07:42,501 --> 01:07:43,694
What of you?

805
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:47,605
I'll follow when I'm done here.

806
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:50,131
Go!

807
01:08:06,194 --> 01:08:07,660
A noble sentiment,

808
01:08:07,661 --> 01:08:09,659
sparing them your demise.

809
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,098
Don't worry.

810
01:08:12,099 --> 01:08:14,134
I will deal with them soon enough.

811
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,394
What has become of you, brother?

812
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:20,207
You are not the man today
that I've known my entire life.

813
01:08:20,512 --> 01:08:22,911
The man you knew is dead.

814
01:08:23,214 --> 01:08:25,680
He was weak, a coward.

815
01:08:26,016 --> 01:08:27,916
And I loathed him.

816
01:08:27,917 --> 01:08:30,352
You've thrown your
life away, and for what?

817
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:32,779
To live among these demons?

818
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,825
Power changes a man, brother,

819
01:08:35,261 --> 01:08:36,852
and for the first time

820
01:08:37,998 --> 01:08:42,093
- I truly know how it feels.
- You had power, Ulfrich.

821
01:08:42,435 --> 01:08:43,731
Not like this.

822
01:08:44,639 --> 01:08:47,368
Even now it courses through my veins.

823
01:08:47,808 --> 01:08:49,604
You've no idea.

824
01:08:51,947 --> 01:08:53,812
There can only be one of us, though.

825
01:08:58,921 --> 01:09:00,855
Let's get this over with.

826
01:10:29,991 --> 01:10:33,757
Now, brother, you'll see true power.

827
01:11:28,057 --> 01:11:29,251
You're right.

828
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:32,928
There can be only one.

829
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,732
Are you sure this is the way?

830
01:11:45,733 --> 01:11:47,539
It's not much farther.

831
01:11:48,547 --> 01:11:50,138
How will Thor find us?

832
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:53,150
If he truly has been here
before, he'll have no trouble.

833
01:11:53,151 --> 01:11:54,481
Trust me.

834
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:25,144
So, this warrior, what if he returns?

835
01:12:25,145 --> 01:12:26,711
Aye, what then?

836
01:12:28,527 --> 01:12:29,618
That teek.

837
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:30,818
What's going on?

838
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:34,453
Perhaps your friend was taken prisoner.

839
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:37,329
Impossible.

840
01:12:38,236 --> 01:12:39,635
Thor didn't lose.

841
01:12:39,972 --> 01:12:43,237
You must come at once.
The bastard son has fallen.

842
01:12:43,238 --> 01:12:45,037
Ulfrich has been slain.

843
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:49,581
Before they come back.

844
01:13:05,801 --> 01:13:07,063
Aegir.

845
01:13:07,671 --> 01:13:08,830
Sif.

846
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:13,375
- My sword.
- Of course.

847
01:13:14,244 --> 01:13:15,404
Freyja.

848
01:13:27,226 --> 01:13:28,784
Hold on.

849
01:13:29,362 --> 01:13:33,958
Tonight you feast on the Saehrimnir,
and drink at Odin¡¦s table.

850
01:14:01,899 --> 01:14:05,232
Shame. He won't keep as long dead.

851
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:13,334
By the way, you really should
watch what you say around wolves.

852
01:14:13,747 --> 01:14:15,804
We have pretty good hearing, teek.

853
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,043
You.

854
01:14:21,044 --> 01:14:22,918
Surprised to see me?

855
01:14:23,491 --> 01:14:26,356
He won't let you have it. You know this.

856
01:14:27,428 --> 01:14:29,486
You'll be rid of me soon enough.

857
01:14:29,487 --> 01:14:31,154
Vali, what's going on?

858
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:37,029
You think Thor is the only
one who seeks the hammer?

859
01:14:37,572 --> 01:14:39,596
You foolish old man.

860
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:51,979
Sif!

861
01:15:52,425 --> 01:15:55,394
Do what you came to do. Find the hammer!

862
01:15:56,628 --> 01:15:57,890
Go!

863
01:16:00,033 --> 01:16:01,092
I will return.

864
01:16:39,343 --> 01:16:44,146
I can't tell you how long I've
awaited your return, son of Odin.

865
01:16:44,717 --> 01:16:47,741
I am Fenris, son of Loki.

866
01:16:47,742 --> 01:16:50,746
The wolf-god. I know.

867
01:16:50,747 --> 01:16:53,951
Then you must also know why you're here.

868
01:16:53,952 --> 01:16:55,685
Aye.

869
01:16:56,164 --> 01:16:58,563
- But do you?
- Of course.

870
01:16:58,564 --> 01:17:01,862
You are here to die, brave warrior.

871
01:17:02,737 --> 01:17:04,295
Are you ready?

872
01:17:04,296 --> 01:17:06,668
Your mortal heart betrays you.

873
01:17:07,275 --> 01:17:11,838
It pleases me that I should
be the one to teach you fear.

874
01:17:12,215 --> 01:17:16,015
The hammer, the instrument
of my brother's demise,

875
01:17:16,253 --> 01:17:19,745
and the only thing that
could ever render me mortal,

876
01:17:19,746 --> 01:17:23,052
so I keep it close right here.

877
01:17:23,053 --> 01:17:26,290
- Why?
- Because you can't help yourself.

878
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:28,591
You are drawn to the hammer.

879
01:17:28,592 --> 01:17:31,794
Your lust for it insatiable.

880
01:17:32,805 --> 01:17:35,273
Well, thank you for tending it for me,

881
01:17:35,274 --> 01:17:37,137
but I'll be needing it back now.

882
01:17:38,812 --> 01:17:40,745
Come and take it.

883
01:18:16,656 --> 01:18:19,623
Well, that wasn't so bad.

884
01:18:36,377 --> 01:18:40,473
To kill a brother's slayer
is a rare opportunity, indeed.

885
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,814
He killed me as well, they say.

886
01:18:42,815 --> 01:18:46,421
Except he was not a
favored son of the gods,

887
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:52,685
so while he rots in the underworld,
you dishonor him by staying here.

888
01:18:53,196 --> 01:18:56,893
Well then, he and Ulfrich
can honor each other.

889
01:19:24,298 --> 01:19:25,697
Freyja!

890
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:43,679
I guess she didn't see that coming.

891
01:20:10,552 --> 01:20:11,641
Wait!

892
01:20:11,886 --> 01:20:12,944
What?

893
01:20:33,311 --> 01:20:35,403
I'll see you again.

894
01:20:35,404 --> 01:20:37,003
On the plains of Asgard.

895
01:20:37,782 --> 01:20:39,750
Until then, sister.

896
01:20:58,473 --> 01:21:01,805
Nothing can save you now, brave warrior.

897
01:21:01,806 --> 01:21:05,074
I only hope my brother isn't insulted.

898
01:21:05,075 --> 01:21:08,272
This is almost too easy.

899
01:21:08,885 --> 01:21:13,082
Just the same, say hello to him for me.

900
01:21:15,658 --> 01:21:16,589
Tell him yourself.

901
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:22,198
We have to go.

902
01:22:28,141 --> 01:22:29,608
Vali's path. We'll go around.

903
01:22:29,877 --> 01:22:30,900
No!

904
01:22:31,612 --> 01:22:32,840
Wait here.

905
01:22:32,841 --> 01:22:34,206
Are you sure?

906
01:23:08,821 --> 01:23:10,345
You did it, Thor.

907
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:13,455
Freyja?

908
01:23:15,494 --> 01:23:16,984
She died well.

909
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:20,593
Reunited with Baldur. As it should be.

910
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:25,228
...the hammer.

911
01:23:26,975 --> 01:23:27,998
May I--

912
01:23:28,777 --> 01:23:30,107
may I hold it?

913
01:23:30,712 --> 01:23:32,975
How can I guarantee you
wouldn't use it against me?

914
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:36,347
I still owe you a finger.

915
01:23:39,155 --> 01:23:42,646
Only you can wield it, remember?

916
01:23:43,527 --> 01:23:44,617
I'll think about it.

917
01:24:11,358 --> 01:24:12,346
And so...

918
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:14,917
they sailed away from Midgard's edge,

919
01:24:14,919 --> 01:24:18,692
each lost in their own
silent contemplation.

920
01:24:19,335 --> 01:24:21,529
Though they'd won the day,

921
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:25,334
they left more on that
isle than they'd taken.
