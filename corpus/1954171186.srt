A year ago

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,960
I'll do everything you say.

3
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,960
I confess that your comment -

4
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,840
- Brings you closer to the reverence
which is due to him.

5
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,560
I surrender myself to
you, for I am yours.

6
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,960
Thus, teacher man, so
long as it lives.

7
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:29,520
Well, you're back.
You look good.

8
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,320
- Dav, Russell.
- Hi, Jeffrey.

9
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:39,720
- This one's from the boss.
You sweat?

10
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,280
- Are you nervous here
the first day.

11
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,960
- It's my coffee!
- Drink it in the car.

12
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,920
- I want to sit and ...
- Come on.

13
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,080
So it will be shown
no more wrong.

14
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,160
- Everything all right?
- This is gold.

15
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,800
The beautiful Diane Stringer.
A pensioner with volunteering.

16
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,120
Well-liked, single, likes a glass of
white wine at the weekend, etc, etc.

17
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,040
- Sexual activity?
- We are still waiting
for answers to tests.

18
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,600
Do we have lacked a mother?

19
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:53,520
My childhood was
not super, but I

20
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,120
- Have you found anything?
- There are no fingerprints.

21
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:03,280
- Thinking we two the same?
- Hardly.

22
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Masks and a clean crime scene.

23
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,600
A perfectly prepared bed.

24
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,360
Ask friends, it is true.

25
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,840
Will you send this to the
laboratory, Bobby?

26
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:38,640
We have found nothing.

27
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,240
I will take over.

28
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:50,200
- It lay under a pile of soil.
- It was not very well hidden.

29
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,640
- It was certainly
not my intention.

30
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,320
I think our friend has
come back, Russell.

31
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,160
Speaking of friends.
.. Ah, shit, Jeffrey.

32
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,880
Hi, Amanda.

33
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,680
- Do you remember Russell?
- What have found?

34
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,960
An arm.

35
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,080
- I did not know that you ...
- Now I'm here then.

36
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,160
- I got your card.
- Good.

37
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:25,440
- It was good enough not much.
- It was you who dropped me.

38
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,320
It could well have gone better.

39
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,960
Elvis!

40
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,960
So I am home.

41
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,000
Go ahead.

42
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,280
PROFILE characters following
RESEARCHERS

43
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,200
Police officers from LA love to

44
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:43,160
Diane Stringer died of a cy
nidinsprøjting, broken ribs -

45
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:46,440
- A punctured lung
and a torn liver.

46
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,760
Vagina wall is damaged
and the lack of

47
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,280
So there is a sick
asshole among us.

48
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,680
Of course no one has
seen anything.

49
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,040
Either he knew her,
or he got access.

50
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:03,880
Check out all the area's
sex crimes, Jamie.

51
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,240
Check the relatives and friends
in our directory.

52
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,680
- Do we him as a serial killer?

53
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,240
It is not a sex criminal.
I think he is impotent.

54
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,080
- What is he?
- I do not know.

55
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,760
- Is he a serial killer?
- I do not know.

56
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,960
Okay, everybody.
Let's get started.

57
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,200
Let me just talk
to you, Russell.

58
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,320
Do you think you are ready to return?
You seem confused.

59
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:53,280
- No, I analyzes just
what we have.

60
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:59,040
Come to the meeting at.
15th There shall be composed
of a workgroup.

61
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,200
What should you do with me?

62
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,000
If you are self-centered, you are reasonably
clever and good to spar with.

63
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,160
Somewhat clever?

64
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,160
"Maybe I can suck it
on to you later."

65
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,120
Five minutes.

66
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:24,120
- Go out and get some lunch, you know.
- Do I know this? How nice.

67
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:28,720
- It was damn kindly meant.
- Yes, rend me.

68
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,280
Should I now also have your food?
Is it where we are?

69
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,640
- Sorry, Detective Spivey.

70
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:45,280
- Now I do not interfere, right?
- No sooner.

71
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:49,560
Can we ...?
May I speak with you alone?

72
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,280
Yes. Come here.

73
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,840
- What about to sit here?
- It's fine.

74
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:11,160
What's wrong? You look worried.

75
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:26,480
Sorry, but I can not
see a checkmark.

76
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,000
I miss you!

77
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,960
Okay ...

78
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,080
That I received from
my wife yesterday.

79
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,360
- You must understand ...
- No. Would you explain me this?

80
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:54,400
- You have said that
my wife is dead.

81
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:58,480
It is a reasonable assumption
given what we found.

82
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,480
The police should probably
not assume anything.

83
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,960
- No, but in light of ...
- What if she is alive?

84
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,080
- It can she possibly be.
- You have to help me.

85
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,240
I would also like to, but she
can not possibly be alive.

86
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:23,200
The letter may have driven
around the system and

87
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,840
It is dated yesterday.

88
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,400
It has been my life's worst years.
Be nice to help me.

89
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:37,680
I can not bear to live
through this again.

90
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,080
You must do something.
What if she is alive.

91
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,160
Okay ...

92
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,880
For your sake I look
at the case.

93
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:02,320
It is the only thing
that is sent

94
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,880
It is sent from a
wireless network.

95
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,480
- Do you know where?
- I'm working on it.

96
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:15,360
- I must go. Mailer you to me?
- Yes. Goodbye.

97
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:19,560
Sorry. So I am here.

98
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,360
Despite the number of wishes
that we say serial murders?

99
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:26,960
- Whether the two murders are not a series?
- No, it's a couple.

100
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,280
- This one is only an assumption.
- But there are not many
similarities ...

101
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:37,760
Shall we gather a working group and
use the many treasures one million?

102
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,920
- Why should he be impotent?

103
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,160
Well, it's just a guess ...

104
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,120
Box finally panic with a story.

105
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,080
- What are you also here?
- I'm sparring partner.

106
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,240
Have you nothing to join,

107
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,320
Well, I have since ...

108
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,680
I understand your reluctance
to assemble a working group.

109
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,520
It is an email from John Tyler's
wife, dated yesterday.

110
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:13,320
This is what is left of
Rebecca Tyler, sir.

111
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,000
- Is she dead?
- Probably.

112
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:23,320
Is she alive, it would seem
rather foolish not

113
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,720
What would you suggest?

114
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,840
I think we should resume the Tyler
case, look at Stringer-murder -

115
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,640
- And investigate cases
in parallel.

116
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:41,080
- There are some similarities ...
- Calling sites were cleaned.

117
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,000
- Cut off limbs, trophies ...
- She believes masks.

118
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,960
- I know. Is it the lips?
- It's Rebecca.

119
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,920
Think you can handle this?
Last flipped you off course.

120
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,200
Freaked's so much to say
but I feel better now.

121
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:05,760
So get into it, which will.
Have you else need anything?

122
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,240
No thanks, that's fine, sir.

123
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,720
Can I get my badge
and my gun, sir?

124
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,680
- Your sign is here.
- Thank you.

125
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,480
- Did you do your own gun?
- Shall we go to it again?

126
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:31,080
- Is it away, you find a stick.

127
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,520
Your asshole ...

128
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:50,080
Thank you.

129
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,880
- What are we here?
- There is something
about the carpet.

130
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:56,440
I have presented a videotape
on your table.

131
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,080
Just after the notch in the film, I am
sure you can see one in the mirror.

132
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,040
Look at it and contact me.

133
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,840
Would you like to help me
move the table, Jeffrey?

134
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,080
- What are you doing?
- Safely. We'll pay.

135
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,840
Buy a new carpet.

136
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,520
There is a notch on the survivors
encompassing the devel nd.

137
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:30,160
I think the guy off camera -

138
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,800
- Lifted the curtain
and wrote it here.

139
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,240
I surrender myself to
you, for I AM YOUR

140
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:46,600
Yes, it's blood.

141
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:52,320
- He has marked his territory.

142
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,320
- Do you have any fire?
- Do not smoke here.

143
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,280
Why not?

144
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,720
Should I be forced to
be passive smoker?

145
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,080
Then you're back in the saddle.
How is it?

146
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:23,680
It's been a wonderful time now
is overridden by the job.

147
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,040
You have to give it some time.

148
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,680
The conversations here only
works if you want.

149
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,560
I thrive here. I must not smoke

150
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:44,360
- How's the drinking?

151
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,600
I can almost get the passport
within a day.

152
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,360
It is hard, but you gotta
have some goals, right?

153
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Your problems will adhere
to the wound is healed -

154
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,240
- And it happens only when you
start to tell something.

155
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,960
- I said yes.
- Have you met her?

156
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,080
Who?

157
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,040
Yes.

158
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,080
How did you feel?

159
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,400
I felt like a complete idiot.

160
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,400
Will you try to describe it with emotions?
"I felt ..."

161
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,680
I felt I lost control, I felt shame.
..

162
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,720
What are you ashamed of?

163
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,960
Here is William Shakespeare's
collected works.

164
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,520
- Is there anything else you want?
- No, thank you for your help.

165
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,280
I never understood that
shit at college.

166
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,840
It's like good wine.
It becomes better with time.

167
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,080
It is you might become.

168
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,240
WHAT IS YOUR SHIT IN THE WORLD?

169
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,720
- Nobles.
- I've got one to.

170
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,680
- An e-mail anymore?
- 3a.

171
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,160
Hi, John.

172
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,840
Do you know how Owen Park is?

173
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,400
Must be a onemanshow?

174
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,960
I thought it best
to do everything

175
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,160
Come here, my friend.

176
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Elvis is a retired police dog

177
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,840
Running out and play.

178
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,720
Are you okay? You seem tired.

179
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,400
Besides having obsessions and
be an alcoholic I'm fine.

180
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,320
You should get some help for
your alcohol problem.

181
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:15,920
The second might
be a good thing.

182
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:21,560
What you call obsessive, I call
fierce determination -

183
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:25,480
- And it seems like good qualities
of a policeman.

184
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:31,360
My mother always said that there may come
something good out of the worst -

185
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,600
- And it helps me to look
positively at things.

186
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,960
Well, now the case.

187
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,720
"What is your shit in the world?"
Say it do anything?

188
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,000
John ...

189
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,600
Committed a murder
a few days ago.

190
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,560
- Calling The place looked
like your wife.

191
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:03,160
It is possible that the
same perpetrator.

192
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,920
I think there is
a serial killer.

193
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,640
For some reason he contacts you.

194
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,320
- Why?
- I do not know.

195
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:17,840
But we have reason to believe
that it will continue.

196
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,480
I say this only so you
are prepared for it.

197
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,280
I deliver your wife's mask for a

198
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:35,440
Whoever has done it
is very clever.

199
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,080
They are custom made from scratch.
They are amazing.

200
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,360
- The artist is probably a man.

201
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,480
Artists use their thumbs to.

202
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,520
Strokes are quite large.
Large strokes, big
thumb and man.

203
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,600
Can you see if both masks are
made of the same person?

204
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,000
They are both custom made and
made of the same material.

205
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,400
They are also made
in the same style.

206
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,000
It looks like this.

207
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:12,120
Spivey. I come away.

208
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:27,920
It'll go mom. It'll go mom.

209
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,280
I'll fix it mom.

210
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,000
Sorry, Mom. I'll get better.

211
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,040
Now I have reviewed the tape and
there is definitely something.

212
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,920
Can you enlarge it?

213
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,440
It is a human.

214
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,080
- Can you enlarge it?
- Now pushing you lemon.

215
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,040
Was it intended that we
should see it here?

216
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,600
Or was it a mistake?

217
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Mor ...

218
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,520
Do I have to come down now?

219
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:29,720
YOU ARE ALL TOGETHER SOME FISSER

220
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,400
- Do you sleep well?
- I've heard of it.

221
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,840
I could well try it.
Do you have any fire?

222
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,160
Amanda left the scene so 2O

223
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,000
It has some good notes.
Have you them from the boss?

224
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:12,000
Is this something we
should talk about?

225
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,000
Dreaming you saw anything
when you sleep?

226
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,240
Do you dream about your parents?

227
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:45,120
I once dreamed that my father
drove me to buy a gun.

228
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,560
- Were there others in the car?
- My son, I have not.

229
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,800
How old was your son
in the dream?

230
00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:02,240
- Maybe ten.
- Maybe ten.

231
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,680
- How old were you?
- I could not see myself.

232
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,120
- Bought your gun?
- No, they did nothing more.

233
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,360
How did you feel about that?

234
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,040
It is obvious why I have
suicidal thoughts.

235
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:31,840
But since they have no
weapons, I am not.

236
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,320
We swap no place yet, but
it is good thinking.

237
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:43,560
- Was your father in the shop?
- That with my son was his idea.

238
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:46,000
- Did you see him with?
- No.

239
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:53,120
I think there was something remarkable,
when you were ten.

240
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,120
Have you any idea
what it could be?

241
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:06,040
Want to talk about the latest
victim and masks?

242
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,480
It excites you as always
up to talk about them.

243
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,040
What is it that bothers
you so much?

244
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:30,480
- Why did your father not in?

245
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:44,440
What the hell happened to
you when you were ten?

246
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,120
The time is gone.

247
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,000
You look good, little man.

248
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:05,160
Listen, Russ.
Smile, no matter what
you see there.

249
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,320
- Be happy when you see mom.
- Okay, Dad.

250
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,640
- I have both good and bad news.

251
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,760
We've got reply from the laboratory.
It is cotton.

252
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:21,960
The bad is that it
is almost total.

253
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,960
- Spivey.
- Your pen pal is back.

254
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,400
- He is serious.
- Can you trace it?

255
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,520
A bookstore in West Hollywood.

256
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:33,400
It has happened again.

257
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,040
The 'mask murderer has
turned on again -

258
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:42,680
- And now believed he
also left behind

259
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,440
We can neither confirm
or deny snakes.

260
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:52,120
But we are very busy to see -

261
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,400
- Between these two forbid-ons.

262
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,320
KriminaIinspektør Myers would
not jump to conclusions -

263
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:04,760
- But we know the following: There are
two similarities between the crimes:

264
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:08,920
Masks and cut limbs.

265
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,720
- He does not turn on the assassination.
- Murder is not the goal.

266
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,840
Shut up, where is it scary.

267
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,080
Jacobs?

268
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,680
Check out his neck and
take a sample of it.

269
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,120
Richardson.

270
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:12,720
The sample you asked for?
Victim had.

271
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,320
Its own.

272
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:21,520
Says Shakespeare play "As You
Like It" you something?

273
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,000
I can not even spell
Shakespeare.

274
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:30,440
I'm good at figures, but the kind
I have never understood.

275
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,080
- Why?
- I'm just curious.

276
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,240
You still hang up posters?
Stop it.

277
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,760
The probability, that she
is alive, is so small ...

278
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,560
I continue as long
as it is likely.

279
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:50,680
I'll find him, John.

280
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,480
Do you know what it means when the
wind is blowing in the trees?

281
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,520
It is God who beckons.

282
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,720
You have a lot of nice trinket.

283
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,360
Many dislike nips, but I can.

284
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,240
What do I get for it?

285
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:28,880
Amanda left the scene
20 minutes before me.

286
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,480
Run.

287
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:39,680
I rang her mobile
but she did not.

288
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:47,120
I saw her car.
The door on the passenger
side was open.

289
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:52,520
Then I heard something.

290
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:03,120
I must have surprised
him, for he ran away.

291
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:15,880
He hit me.

292
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,560
Amanda rescued you say?

293
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:37,280
What is it about the masks
that bothers you?

294
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:55,200
"A faithful shepherd followed
your steps."

295
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,560
"Look at him, he worships you.
Teach him what is to love."

296
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:07,480
"To be nothing but tears,
as I have for Phoebe."

297
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:15,480
- Spivey.
- The mails are becoming
more and more strange.

298
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:23,400
"I flee from you in order not to harm you.
They say I am a murderer."

299
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:26,040
He's not going to kill you.

300
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,360
You are a tool.
He uses you to get
in touch with us.

301
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:35,560
- Has one of you took
my earrings?

302
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,320
And so you would think
you can trust cops.

303
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,640
The material we found on the woman
was nonoxynol-9 on the lips.

304
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,720
It is a spermicidal
agent on condoms.

305
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,480
Hear it here from a
Shakespeare piece:

306
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,720
"You learn as long as you live.
Women can suffer a broken rib."

307
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,080
- The first victim.
- Yes. Broken ribs.

308
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,480
It is the last mail, Tyler has received.
Verbatim from the play.

309
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,880
He plays the piece?

310
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:10,560
Both Stringer murder
and murder is Tyler.

311
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,440
I do not remember
"As You Like It"

312
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:18,520
- No, it's a comedy.
- Why he refers to it?

313
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,000
Not only have we tried
what the accident.

314
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:30,000
Theaters have Fier tragedy than this
scene, which takes place on us.

315
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,560
The whole world is a stage.

316
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,360
All men and women are
merely actors.

317
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:41,600
Each have their replies.

318
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,200
And through his life plays
a man many roles.

319
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,200
Spivey?

320
00:35:57,879 --> 00:36:00,040
Wait ... what?

321
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:05,840
Have no guards here?

322
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:10,280
We've never had problems before, mr.
Spivey.

323
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:14,040
Nightwatch is free tonight.

324
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:21,000
Are you saying that asshole can go in
and unseen dig such a hole here?

325
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:27,200
Apart from a few teenagers,
we have never had problmer.

326
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,840
Moreover, it would
also take one man

327
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:42,840
- It's an interesting point.

328
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:46,760
It does not.
He got what he wanted.

329
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:42,680
I would certainly have
called first.

330
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:49,320
I thought that we could make peace.
To

331
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:53,480
I have taken with food.
It has shown you also need.

332
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:15,280
I think I've tried
it here before.

333
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:20,760
- How is your apartment?
- Okay.
Jeffrey helped with the move.

334
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:24,720
Lifting heavy things is shown
the only thing he can do.

335
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Maybe you could help me
to hang up curtains.

336
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:31,560
You've kept mine.

337
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:35,920
They fit just as well do so.

338
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,560
- How long will this continue?

339
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,080
- Do you have a second, Russell?
- Yes.

340
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,920
I have gay fantasies about
my psychologist.

341
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,360
I wonder just what
happened with us.

342
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:10,440
- My forced leave
was probably his.

343
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:15,520
How is it when police officers
lose their service weapons.

344
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:21,240
- We always runs in circles.
- I justify it.

345
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:24,560
- I just want to explain ...
- Forget it.

346
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,400
You freaked, Russell.

347
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:30,760
You started to drink and
did not fit your work.

348
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:36,360
- I know you had to witness.
- What is it about?

349
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,040
I'm terrified ...
Dogs Fear of not ...

350
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,120
For not being able to help you.

351
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:55,880
- You have always helped me.
- Not the night in the woods.

352
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,440
Were you not here, he had
killed me, Russell.

353
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,320
I'm not just forgabt in you.

354
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,760
I love you really still.

355
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:23,400
And just so you know:
I have never.

356
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:27,440
And the one who calls
others to be honest -

357
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:31,480
- Lets you good enough something
to be desired.

358
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:43,160
Do you want to talk about it?

359
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:49,400
Listen here: I have been told to go with you.
I do so.

360
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:53,640
The rest is up to you.

361
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,080
Do you have any fire?

362
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,800
No, I have not.
Want more coffee?

363
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:07,640
- I would rather have fire.
- You need more coffee.

364
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:11,960
Why you smashed the
mug, Russell?

365
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:14,800
Keep your eyes on the mug.
At one of the pieces.

366
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:20,920
Looking at it long enough,
collectors mug again.

367
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:23,920
Now you need to relax
and hear what I say.

368
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:27,400
Look at the stump. Do you hear?

369
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:32,560
Think back to your childhood
and keep on focusing.

370
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,680
You are ten years old.
What can you see?

371
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,000
- My mom.
- What is she doing?

372
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,360
She works in the garden.
She loves her roses.

373
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:56,400
- Describe her.
- She is beautiful.

374
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,240
She is the best mom on our way.

375
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:04,360
My father loves her.

376
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:09,480
- She does say 
omething for him?

377
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:15,800
There was her thing.
Moget bad, is not he?

378
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,720
What can you see?

379
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,880
An accident.

380
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:30,600
Beware!

381
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:37,040
She struck her head.

382
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,800
She looks different.

383
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:45,280
You look good, little man.

384
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,520
Listen, Russ.
Smile, no matter what
you see there.

385
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,480
- Be happy when you see mom.
- Okay, Dad.

386
00:42:56,439 --> 00:42:59,880
I'll wait here. Come.

387
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,480
Now you may well go to her.

388
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,640
Hi, Mom. You look really lovely.

389
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,920
Then she comes home.
Now she's come home.

390
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:42,920
Describe it.

391
00:43:44,479 --> 00:43:46,920
She has changed.

392
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:51,440
She uses nasty words.
She is not the same anymore.

393
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,160
- How is she to you?
- She is a second.

394
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,960
She kisses me with the mask on.

395
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:03,840
I can feel the plastic on my face.
It is disgusting.

396
00:44:03,919 --> 00:44:06,800
What happened to her?

397
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,920
- She died.
- How did she die?

398
00:44:25,879 --> 00:44:31,080
- Where is your father?
- He started to drink.

399
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,120
Okay ...

400
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,240
Now I count to three and says:
"Awake." And then you wake up.

401
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:40,320
Then you can only remember
what you want.

402
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,520
One, two, three ... wake up.

403
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:58,680
Fire.

404
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,920
Okay ...

405
00:45:11,999 --> 00:45:18,120
I have cleaned the image and made it lighter.
What says?

406
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:22,920
Stop the tape.

407
00:45:23,919 --> 00:45:27,920
- What is it?
- Maybe a birthmark?

408
00:45:27,999 --> 00:45:30,320
Play it one frame at a time.

409
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:35,600
- It's too blurry.
- Is the picture quality poor?

410
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,240
No, so there should be lines everywhere.
They are only on him.

411
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:45,480
- What do you say?
- There is no shadow.

412
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:50,120
Apart from design and
location, I think

413
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,280
Large scars.

414
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,280
The whole world is a stage.

415
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,640
All men and women are
merely actors.

416
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,200
Each have their replies.

417
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,320
And through his life plays
a man many roles.

418
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:13,000
Sorry to have to
get involved in.

419
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,760
Welcome back, Spivey.

420
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:20,720
I'm the king or queen and will
continue to play acting.

421
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,520
They have seen my work
before, Spivey.

422
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,840
They only get it here fora:

423
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:34,720
The last scene of all is a
new childhood oblivion.

424
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,400
Take care of yo
rselves, friends.

425
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:41,360
For the rest, Spivey ...
your mom is with me.

426
00:46:41,439 --> 00:46:43,480
I would say hello.

427
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:50,640
What are you doing here?

428
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,680
I can not sleep.
What are you even here?

429
00:46:54,760 --> 00:47:00,040
I could of course say, I just came
by, but I'm looking for you.

430
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,280
Me? What can I help?

431
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:06,960
Do I have to ...
You've studied psychology.

432
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,880
One of my friends ...
And it's so true.

433
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:20,320
He's not so good, and
I have it bad with.

434
00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:24,560
I think in fact it is my
fault that he has such.

435
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,800
All right ...

436
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,200
So, guilt is emotion -

437
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,000
- And it is only possible if you feel
something, so it is positive.

438
00:47:39,479 --> 00:47:42,320
It sounds sensible enough.

439
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:48,760
I also feel something
else for him.

440
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,080
Guilt is like love and hate.

441
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,440
The opposite of love
is indifference.

442
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:07,160
It sounds fat, right?

443
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:12,160
I think at least not that
my friend does not care.

444
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:31,040
I am sure that your friend is happy
that you feel something for him.

445
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,400
I have no work.

446
00:48:36,399 --> 00:48:39,040
Do not reject me.

447
00:48:46,919 --> 00:48:52,440
Do you understand what
is happening?

448
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:56,240
- Yes, I do.
- He goes after me.

449
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:02,440
And are you close to me
can happen to you.

450
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:05,560
I can not ... protect you.

451
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:10,080
I would rather die than
to see you get hurt.

452
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:15,600
- Let be.
- Now, I think you
should come home.

453
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,080
Are you aware of how
much you mean?

454
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:40,880
- There is a sheet on for your sake.
- How delicious.

455
00:49:40,959 --> 00:49:46,040
- Was it expensive?
- Wal-Mart best.

456
00:49:53,879 --> 00:49:56,080
What is it?

457
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,520
That evening in the forest ...

458
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:06,000
Would you promise me one thing?

459
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:14,080
I never get to see you
look like this again.

460
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,880
I promise.

461
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:23,400
I love you.

462
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:31,680
They only get it here fora:

463
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,600
The last scene of all is a
new childhood oblivion.

464
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,520
Take care of yo
rselves, friends.

465
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,760
"The last scene of all is
a new childhood ..."

466
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:59,360
"Idre men meet death without teeth, sight,
taste, and without something."

467
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:04,440
Idre men. Amanda ..!

468
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:08,560
One of the perpetrators
are after me.

469
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,080
- Is there more?
- I think we are.

470
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:18,720
A white man in the 50s.
He looks ordinary looking
and is pedantic.

471
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,400
His hobby requires concentration.
He

472
00:51:24,479 --> 00:51:26,080
He is a loner.

473
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,760
The second is also white.
He's big, strong and impulsive.

474
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,520
We think he damages himself.

475
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,680
He has scars on the
body, and I think.

476
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,080
His next victim is
an elderly man.

477
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,920
It is not random victims.
He knows them.

478
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:59,400
"A fool thinks he has some -

479
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:03,600
- But a wise man knows he is an imbecile.
"

480
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:09,880
"When the pagan philosopher
felt the urge

481
00:52:09,959 --> 00:52:13,920
- He opened his mouth and came in your mouth ...
"

482
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:22,520
What did you really know me?

483
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:28,120
It is a hypnosis form that works

484
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,480
It is called the "confusion
technique".

485
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,280
Your dream was about your mother's
suicide not on yours.

486
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:39,160
- You saw it as your father's fault.
- I blamed him.

487
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,560
Forgive him.
He committed an error.
You have had feelings of guilt.

488
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,320
- Over what?
- That you were not in the car.

489
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:52,920
You feel that you betrayed your mother
because you do not rescued her.

490
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:55,760
It was too much for a decade.

491
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:00,600
So the feeling was there long
before you met Amanda.

492
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,920
You have been willing to failure
women throughout their lives.

493
00:53:04,999 --> 00:53:10,720
It was not the mask,
you were afraid.

494
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:21,360
- I saw you smash it here.
- Granted. I've done it before.

495
00:53:21,439 --> 00:53:24,440
I have a whole garage
full of them.

496
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:29,880
Spivey.

497
00:53:29,959 --> 00:53:34,240
Our friend has shown huseret again
and presented a gift to us.

498
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,400
He comes here a couple times
a month and sits at the bar.

499
00:53:48,479 --> 00:53:52,920
He did not even drink anything.
He looks just through his mask.

500
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:57,600
It's nothing. Here is also one.

501
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,600
Sorry.

502
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,000
But it frightens me.
It does not here.

503
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:09,720
I have lived in the
French quarters.

504
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,600
What is it?

505
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,600
Yes, he plays.
Make it just perfect.

506
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,600
It uses me as often.

507
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,480
Is this clean?
Hear ye?
Everything needs cleaning.

508
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,560
It was the same yesterday.

509
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,720
He came in and gave the guard
four 20-dollar banknotes.

510
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,840
I keep an eye on him.
He has damned.

511
00:54:37,919 --> 00:54:40,960
- He pays twice as much.
- Why?

512
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:44,400
He cut in it, so we must
remove a mass of blood.

513
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:49,160
- Is it not in the price here?
- I do not think you are quite.

514
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,720
It is not the cuts, you
can put patches on.

515
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,520
He cut deep, as if he
was making sushi.

516
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,360
Long and deep wounds to hell.

517
00:55:01,439 --> 00:55:06,560
Some to be sewed, otherwise
he would bleed to death.

518
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,320
But as I said, so it scares me.

519
00:55:10,399 --> 00:55:14,600
It makes it that are on
the table, however.

520
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:20,840
- Does he not know what it is?
- It must himself see.

521
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,960
Then came with me to hell.

522
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,000
It's easy money.

523
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,320
And I know what I'm talking about because
I have been a Honda dealer.

524
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:37,680
Clean the boots, dammit.

525
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,920
There rolls the money into.
This is where filth is.

526
00:55:46,879 --> 00:55:49,240
Bother at all to take a break?

527
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,560
"I surrender myself to
you, for I am yours."

528
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,480
Tell us about the mask.

529
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,880
There was just a mask.

530
00:56:04,959 --> 00:56:07,520
- Was it colored?
- Yes.

531
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,400
We will have a word with
his chopper friends.

532
00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:17,040
Shut up, which looks out here.
He is precise and insane.

533
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,840
- What?
- He is precise.

534
00:56:24,919 --> 00:56:29,360
Temporal.
He'll never be half, or twenty
over a quarter past.

535
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:32,840
He is always 02/13.

536
00:56:32,919 --> 00:56:35,120
It's damn crazy, right?

537
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,760
It was Rebecca last
birthday gift.

538
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:47,520
- How has it been?
- In the jewelry box.

539
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,480
- Do you still?
- In the dresser in the bedroom.

540
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,880
It seems like it always
ha'r done it?

541
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:16,200
Have you seen this before?

542
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:28,280
"Fall in love not in me.
I am more.

543
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:32,120
He has been in my home.
The lunatic has been here.

544
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:43,000
They have seen my work
before, Spivey.

545
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:59,680
They have seen my work
before, Spivey.

546
00:58:36,879 --> 00:58:42,360
Hey, Elvis! Where's your daddy?

547
00:58:42,439 --> 00:58:47,760
- No coffee?
- Have I missed your
coffee again?

548
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,800
Skip over coffee.
It tastes like piss.

549
00:58:50,879 --> 00:58:53,520
I love orchids.

550
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,040
- How sweet.
- Bite me.

551
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,960
Your daddy loves
pee wife, right?

552
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:08,360
- Let him work a little.
- No, he is too old.

553
00:59:08,439 --> 00:59:10,840
Let him try.

554
00:59:10,919 --> 00:59:13,360
Find Jeffrey!

555
00:59:13,439 --> 00:59:17,920
The russell Spivey from Los
Angeles police, Justine.

556
00:59:17,999 --> 00:59:23,560
I am seeking information
on a mask, I

557
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,600
- Have some papers on it?
- From 1968 ...

558
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,160
Then I paper archive.

559
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:36,160
- It is a police matter.
- I'll see what I can do.

560
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,360
Thank you.

561
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:42,920
Spivey.

562
00:59:53,919 --> 00:59:56,000
Holy shit!

563
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:03,760
I take it.

564
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:18,640
"Without teeth, eyesight
and without something."

565
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,200
I've found something, Russell.

566
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,080
"The world is a stage
and all the actors.

567
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,320
"Each have their lines -

568
01:00:34,399 --> 01:00:37,640
- And through his life plays a man many roles.
"

569
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,920
CHANGE sheet and save
it in the woods

570
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:16,680
There is something we do not see Jeffrey.
It's right in front of us.

571
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,800
- The same age and
same neighborhood.

572
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:26,080
- "You've seen my work before ..."
- What?

573
01:01:34,959 --> 01:01:40,480
I want to know about
these three persons.

574
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:49,960
Stringer was a nurse, Rothman
and Bragg were porters.

575
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,880
Were they at one time employed
at the same time?

576
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,480
The three of them recruited from
the mid 60s to late 60s.

577
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:11,800
- Godfrey skgnhedsklinik.
- It's Spivey, Justine.
Something new?

578
01:02:11,879 --> 01:02:14,680
He has not worked
here for years.

579
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,760
What is his name?

580
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:20,400
Check a Carter Pullman, Jacob.

581
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:25,280
Check criminal records and
find his current address.

582
01:02:26,959 --> 01:02:30,640
- Nobles.
- I've been bad.

583
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,800
- Are you okay?
- Will you tell Russell?

584
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:39,680
Carter's mother, Christine Pullman,
proportionate criminal record.

585
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,600
Do you know the name
Christine Pullman,

586
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,600
People in the neighborhood are
still talking about her.

587
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,440
We were often at home.
It was always her
son, who phoned.

588
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:56,680
Her husband often beat her
and abused her violently.

589
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,760
It was not illegal back then,
so she notified him never.

590
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,960
Eventually, she could hardly
cope with more.

591
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:15,320
D. February 13, 1958 she cut him
to pieces in the bathtub -

592
01:03:15,399 --> 01:03:18,560
- And buried him
in the basement.

593
01:03:19,479 --> 01:03:24,480
All real estate agents
in town have.

594
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,160
What became of her?

595
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,720
She was found covered in blood.

596
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:34,080
She was incoherent and stared
when she was arrested.

597
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,360
- What about the boy?
- Carter?

598
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,480
It was the most 
istressing of all.

599
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,520
He was hung up in the basement.

600
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:48,000
The scars, he had testified
to regular abuse.

601
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:52,840
- What happened to him?
- Authorities were desperate.

602
01:03:52,919 --> 01:03:55,080
Therefore he went to orphanages.

603
01:03:55,160 --> 01:04:00,200
Then we heard from him ever.
He was a quiet boy.

604
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,960
Thanks for your help, Sedgewick.

605
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,160
Okay, thanks. No fixed address.

606
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:17,320
- Kl. 2.13.
- 13th. February 19S8.

607
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:22,120
All real estate agents in town have
no heid tried to sell the house.

608
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,840
Give me your phone and
grab a group effort.

609
01:04:28,479 --> 01:04:31,400
Lives there anyone in Pullman's
house, Sedgewick?

610
01:04:53,319 --> 01:04:54,880
A gun!

611
01:04:58,439 --> 01:05:00,400
It is mine.

612
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:03,720
Want to get someone to retrieve
my gun holster?

613
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,120
- Who is that?
- It's Christine Pullman.

614
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,520
Will you take care of it, Jacob?

615
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:22,560
Have you found something,
my friend?

616
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:28,640
- What is this?
- The basement, we
took Carter in.

617
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:45,480
I remember the larger than this.

618
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,440
Light here, boys.

619
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:58,360
- We need a nail
scissors, Jamie.

620
01:06:19,399 --> 01:06:22,480
- My God!
- It's Rebecca Tyler.

621
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,520
- We need some ambulance people.

622
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,960
What is there now, dammit?

623
01:06:31,999 --> 01:06:34,080
What is it?

624
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,600
What?

625
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:50,360
Jacobs ...

626
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,960
Make sure that she
will be helped.

627
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,840
Where is Amanda, Jeffrey?

628
01:06:59,919 --> 01:07:02,960
Skip over coffee.
It tastes like piss.

629
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,560
She was taken home.

630
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,800
It's Amanda Richards.
Leave a message.

631
01:07:13,879 --> 01:07:18,480
Listen carefully, Amanda.
Please get out of the house.

632
01:07:24,479 --> 01:07:26,040
Shit!

633
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,400
- I come, I come.
- Hurry.

634
01:07:37,479 --> 01:07:39,800
Which apartment is it?

635
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:53,000
- Does the elevator here?
- No, take the stairs.

636
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,640
Amanda?

637
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:16,560
Amanda, It's Jeffrey.

638
01:08:22,919 --> 01:08:24,800
Amanda?

639
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:35,800
Have you found her, Jeffrey?

640
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,680
Adrian?

641
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,440
- Come in, Adrian?
- I listen.

642
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:54,560
Which apartment living
Amanda Richardson in?

643
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:01,320
- Is she just moved in?
- Damn, Adrian!

644
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:04,760
Look for a change of address.

645
01:09:15,999 --> 01:09:19,360
What are you, Elvis?

646
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,560
Find Jeffrey, Elvis.

647
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,320
Adrian ...

648
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,240
I need help now!

649
01:09:40,199 --> 01:09:44,240
I've seen this man's strength.

650
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:53,920
Pull in time out, by my honor and
my princely word, must die.

651
01:09:54,999 --> 01:10:00,400
I am here to save.
I have no idea how devoted I am.

652
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:10,880
It's fools as you, that
fill this world -

653
01:10:10,959 --> 01:10:13,440
- With ugly children.

654
01:10:22,959 --> 01:10:25,920
Have you got hold
of it, I asked?

655
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,800
- Well done.
- Bite me.

656
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,600
Russell .. .

657
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:55,480
I understand ...
not quite what going on here.

658
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,560
There is no one will
tell me something.

659
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,360
I have good news for you.
Your wife is alive.

660
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:11,600
It was what I said.

661
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,920
It's beautiful.
Fantastic. How is she?

662
01:11:18,999 --> 01:11:23,920
She is weak, but she lives.

663
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,400
It's quite amazing.

664
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,880
Where am I happy.

665
01:11:30,959 --> 01:11:36,960
- When I visit her?
- I have a photo of her.

666
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,600
- Who has done it at her?
- It's a little confusing.

667
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:54,440
According to her,
you have done it.

668
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,880
What do you think?

669
01:11:56,959 --> 01:12:00,160
It's completely insane, Russell.

670
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:05,280
You know me.
You know since I never

671
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:08,080
So we try something else.

672
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:18,720
- Do you know who this is?
- No. I'm tired of it here.

673
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,560
- Playing us for any game?
- No.

674
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:26,000
- I do not know who it is.
- It is your mother.

675
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:32,880
Fine.
If you want to play the silly
game, so we make it -

676
01:12:32,959 --> 01:12:35,200
- But it is silly.

677
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:39,040
- What did your mom like?
- My mom ...

678
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,120
She was. ..

679
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,720
What color was her hair?

680
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,840
What about her eyes? You do.

681
01:12:50,919 --> 01:12:55,480
- It is running around in my head now ...
- Can not remember your mother?

682
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,720
I can not ... think.

683
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:04,000
So let us take a few
easy questions in.

684
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:08,000
- Wait, wait, wait ...
- What was your teacher
in the fourth class?

685
01:13:08,879 --> 01:13:12,040
Answer the questions
as they got more.

686
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:15,520
I do not understand it, John.
What was your father?

687
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,360
How long were you scout?
What was your first pet?

688
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,840
- Have you forgotten everything?
- Wait ...

689
01:13:22,919 --> 01:13:25,080
It is here, I think
you can remember.

690
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:30,520
Can you remember when your wife,
Rebecca, were you unfaithful?

691
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:38,440
Your wife bollede with one another, because
you can not get it up and running

692
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,920
According to her, you have never been
able to get it up and running.

693
01:13:41,999 --> 01:13:46,680
When she became pregnant, did you know
it was not yours, is not it, John?

694
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:50,600
She says you were one second.

695
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,360
Can you remember it, John?

696
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,640
It grew another man's child

697
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,120
What was it you wrote?

698
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,160
"What is your shit
in the world?"

699
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:06,760
"You are all some fisser."

700
01:14:07,959 --> 01:14:12,680
The guide pussy deserved to die,
but John got frustrated that!

701
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,560
Fucking whore.

702
01:14:25,239 --> 01:14:28,320
You look somewhat
bruised looking.

703
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,400
Do you want to beat me?

704
01:14:34,919 --> 01:14:36,760
Who are you?

705
01:14:37,839 --> 01:14:39,720
I am not a crook.

706
01:14:56,199 --> 01:14:58,560
Do you have any fire?

707
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:24,640
- You made my mother's
mask, right?

708
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,960
It is not all that
the eye can see.

709
01:15:28,039 --> 01:15:32,760
Get cleaned the shriveled body
of this wicked world -

710
01:15:32,839 --> 01:15:37,120
- By patiently taking
my medication.

711
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:43,280
I could immediately see that you
took your world for granted.

712
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,280
Now you may well see her.

713
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:55,320
Occasionally there may come something
good out of the worst.

714
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,800
Hi, Mom.

715
01:15:57,879 --> 01:16:00,560
You look really lovely.

716
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,600
You were blind.

717
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:08,440
- It is not my mother.
Who is it?

718
01:16:09,159 --> 01:16:12,360
Stop it. Do not do it there!

719
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,640
You just have to show respect.

720
01:16:16,119 --> 01:16:20,360
I fear you have sold your
own land to see others.

721
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:25,760
Having seen so much and
nothing to hold ...

722
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:32,360
... To have rich eyes
and poor hands.

723
01:16:46,999 --> 01:16:49,280
Where are you from?

724
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:55,960
- You smashed the image
of your mother.

725
01:16:56,039 --> 01:17:00,800
Why did you do that, Carter?

726
01:17:00,879 --> 01:17:04,920
Why you smashed the
picture, Carter?

727
01:17:04,999 --> 01:17:09,400
You smashed it, but look at it.

728
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:16,040
Can you see the pieces?
They accumulate.

729
01:17:16,879 --> 01:17:20,640
Listen carefully to
what I say, Carter.

730
01:17:21,879 --> 01:17:27,800
We two must be on a little trip
back to when you were ten.

731
01:17:27,879 --> 01:17:30,200
Can you see anything?

732
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:33,160
Your mother is unhappy.

733
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:37,920
Your father is sleeping.
He treats her badly, right?

734
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,800
I can not get to finish.

735
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,720
I can not reach it. Sorry.

736
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,680
You saw it, right?

737
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:05,840
Carter!

738
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:11,720
I did not have to be done.
It was not perfect.

739
01:18:27,879 --> 01:18:31,720
Pit the sheets down.
I have to save the sheets.

740
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,640
Save the sheets ...

741
01:18:36,919 --> 01:18:40,720
Mor ... what are you doing?

742
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:46,760
You must clean the walls.
They must be absolutely clean.
Understood?

743
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,640
Clean them!

744
01:18:55,239 --> 01:18:57,760
It can not go on, mother.

745
01:18:57,839 --> 01:18:59,880
It may not go away.

746
01:18:59,959 --> 01:19:02,000
I'll do my best.

747
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,960
Russell ...

748
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,000
Will not you help me?

749
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:40,120
No, I will not be there.

750
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:43,560
Do not make me hurt.

751
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:48,680
- Sorry, I'll get better.

752
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,560
It does not help.

753
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:54,120
You are not useful.

754
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:05,960
I surrender myself to
you, for I am yours.

755
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:09,200
I surrender myself to
you, for I am yours.

756
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,800
I surrender myself to
you, for I am yours.

757
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,600
I surrender myself to you ...

758
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,120
Carter ...

759
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:27,640
When I have spoken to
three, wakes you.

760
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,760
A ...

761
01:20:29,839 --> 01:20:31,520
... Two ...

762
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,680
... Three.

763
01:20:49,879 --> 01:20:53,600
Do you think you've caught me?

764
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:57,280
I am here because I
want to be here.

765
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:01,120
I have done so for your sake.

766
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:07,120
You have killed a nurse, two porters
and destroyed your wife.

767
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:11,120
The pussy is not my wife!

768
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,600
May I see it?

769
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:20,120
It's creepy.

770
01:21:20,199 --> 01:21:24,400
Could you not have made
it more feminine?

771
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:39,360
I will not be judged!

772
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:46,240
I knew it would end like this.
To

773
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,040
Are you ready?

774
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:52,240
My mother committed suicide
when I was ten.

775
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,920
Two years later my father
died of drowning.

776
01:21:55,999 --> 01:22:01,640
Since I was the 12th Do you really
think you can intimidate me?

777
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,760
Yes.

778
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:22,800
Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm just tired.

779
01:22:22,879 --> 01:22:25,840
But it is nice that he
has returned, right?

780
01:22:25,919 --> 01:22:32,080
I overheard that you dropped your kussehul,
although she would help.

781
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:39,840
You have always been a spoiled
shit adolescents.

782
01:22:44,959 --> 01:22:46,920
But are not you more.

783
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:53,880
A fool thinks he has some -

784
01:22:53,959 --> 01:22:57,680
- But a wise man knows
he is an imbecile.

785
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,960
You love mazes.

786
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:10,000
Then learn this of me:
To have is to have.

787
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:16,360
Leaning is something from
a cup into a glass -

788
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,840
- Timber is something and
fill something else.

789
01:23:22,879 --> 01:23:25,720
So, you, you fool -

790
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,440
- Leave the community
with this woman.

791
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,280
I kill you.
I'm treating you with poison.

792
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:38,320
I kill you in 150
different ways.

793
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,360
I know.

794
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,560
Amanda? Amanda!

795
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:43,560
- You will not live here.

796
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:52,680
Occasionally there may come something
good out of the worst.

797
01:24:53,959 --> 01:24:56,520
You were actually blind

798
01:24:59,959 --> 01:25:03,200
Do you understand me now?

799
01:25:03,959 --> 01:25:06,520
Therefore, you shake and flee.

800
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,440
Now I say goodbye.

801
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:14,440
You pigeons ...

802
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,800
... To nothing ...

803
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,520
... In my eyes.

804
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,760
Blessed are the dead who
now lie with the Lord.

805
01:25:38,839 --> 01:25:45,360
They are rested after their work,
for their deeds follow them.

806
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:51,400
Support us, Lord, when the
day coming to an end.

807
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:56,080
We ask you, Lord, to accept
two of your children.

808
01:25:56,159 --> 01:26:00,560
We give you Gretchen
Spivey back -

809
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:05,720
- And ask you also to find
room for Amanda Richards.

810
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,800
Have mercy, Lord, for
I am powerless.

811
01:26:09,879 --> 01:26:13,240
Health me, sir, because
my body is afflicted.

812
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:16,280
Come back, sir, and
rode my life.

813
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:20,360
Give me your steadfast love.

814
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,080
The best of me come with you.
