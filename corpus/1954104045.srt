1
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,476
Are you awake?

2
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,711
No.

3
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,215
What time is it?

4
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,616
Two o'clock.

5
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:27,286
Almost two o'clock.

6
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,588
AM or PM?

7
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,425
You're not serious.

8
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,161
Not entirely.

9
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,599
It's afternoon.

10
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,801
I know.

11
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,403
What time is your flight?

12
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,438
7:40 to Amsterdam.

13
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,740
I haven't seen
you for two weeks,

14
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,110
and you're leaving
again this evening?

15
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:55,214
I know. I'll be gone for
just a few days.

16
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,483
God, you're a sexy woman.

17
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,819
What are you doing?

18
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,788
I'm not doing anything.

19
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,691
They're going to take me
out of here on a gurney.

20
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:06,758
Ah!

21
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,698
Tell me something sexy.

22
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:20,305
I want you to put your
hand up my dress.

23
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,808
But you're not wearing a dress.

24
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,911
What does that
have to do with it?

25
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:30,582
It's something you
like for me to say.

26
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:34,486
I know. But it has to be real,
doesn't it?

27
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,459
Why don't you just tell me what it is
that you want me to do to you?

28
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,831
I want you to touch me.

29
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,267
You want me to touch you where?

30
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,237
I want you to
touch me down there.

31
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,274
You do?

32
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,877
I really do.

33
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,213
Say it more sexy.

34
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,385
I want you to touch me.

35
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:09,221
God, you're sopping.

36
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,823
I know.

37
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,663
How did you get yourself
into such a state?

38
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,869
From thinking about you.

39
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,306
From thinking about me, what?

40
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:31,343
From thinking about your sweet
face between my legs.

41
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,357
Wait, wait, wait.

42
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:49,528
I think I should go tidy up.

43
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,363
I don't want you to.

44
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,240
Slow, slow, slow.

45
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,914
How do you know
how to do that?

46
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,419
From hanging out
with really nasty girls.

47
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,397
You've ruined me,
you know that?

48
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,366
I hope so.

49
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,575
Oh, my God!

50
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:14,960
Ah.

51
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,624
Do you like it because it reminds
you of somewhere else?

52
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,792
That's not why I like it.

53
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,694
I like it for itself.

54
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,097
It doesn't have
to be like something else.

55
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,565
No.

56
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,134
Do I remind you
of someone else?

57
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,837
Yes, you do.

58
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,572
Someone you miss?

59
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,776
Someone who is dead.

60
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,714
I don't think I miss things.

61
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,518
I think to miss something is to
hope that it will come back.

62
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,186
But it's not coming back.

63
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,858
I've always known that
since I was a girl.

64
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,628
You don't think
that's a bit cold?

65
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,099
I think truth
has no temperature.

66
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,807
Mmm.

67
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,013
There it goes.

68
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,651
Follow me, please.

69
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,100
Good morning.

70
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:39,304
I want her to have something that
she won't be uncomfortable wearing.

71
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,006
I don't want to
give her a diamond

72
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,208
so big, she'd be afraid to wear it.

73
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,745
She is probably more courageous
than you imagine.

74
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,751
Is this a pillow?

75
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,252
No, it's an Asscher.

76
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,788
Look at the corners.

77
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,657
Let's put it in the grading box.

78
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,995
The pillow has a slight arc
to the sides.

79
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,332
It is a modern version
of the old-mine cut.

80
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,067
Let's look at the color.

81
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,935
Put it table-side down.

82
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,671
So you're looking
through the pavilion?

83
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,040
Yes, there's more to look through.

84
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,616
It appears to be yellow.

85
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,718
It's nitrogen that
gives it the yellow.

86
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,755
The colors start with D.
A D-stone has no color.

87
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,026
So, what am I looking at?

88
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,895
H.

89
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,196
Is that still a good color?

90
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,198
That's a very good color.

91
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,834
The truth is that
anything you can say

92
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:45,036
about the diamond is
in the nature of a flaw.

93
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,174
A perfect diamond would be
composed simply of light.

94
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,811
Do you see the inclusion?

95
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,680
No.

96
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,783
It is small, what we would
call a feather.

97
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,686
Remember, you're not
looking for merit.

98
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,221
This is a cynical business.

99
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,757
We seek only imperfection.

100
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,892
Yes.

101
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,394
I think I see it.

102
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,198
So, it is graded what?

103
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,733
A VS1.

104
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,335
Some might grade it higher.

105
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,404
You might grade it higher.

106
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,109
You like this stone?

107
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:27,011
Oh. I like that stone.

108
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,885
How many carats is it?

109
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,253
3.9.

110
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,354
It's expensive.

111
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:46,030
The stones themselves have
their own view of things.

112
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,900
Let me show you.

113
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,508
This is a cautionary stone.

114
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,847
Although, I suppose
every diamond is cautionary.

115
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,117
A cautionary diamond.

116
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,418
Of course, why not?

117
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,357
It's not a small thing to wish for,
however unattainable,

118
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,894
to aspire to the stone's
endless destiny.

119
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,730
Isn't that the meaning of adornment?

120
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:21,866
To enhance the beauty
of the beloved

121
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,335
is to acknowledge
both her frailty,

122
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,971
and the nobility
of that frailty.

123
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,439
We announce to the darkness

124
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:32,544
that we will not be diminished
by the brevity of our lives.

125
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:38,917
That we will not
thereby be made less.

126
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,419
You will see.

127
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,472
Afternoon, sir.
Thank you.

128
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,541
Looking good, Counselor.
Chris.

129
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:04,943
How you doing?

130
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,424
Good.

131
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:17,956
Where's Reiner?

132
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,624
He's in there.

133
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:33,872
You don't have
to worry about it.

134
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,306
Yeah, but who paid for it?

135
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,142
I put the credit card down.
So, obviously, I paid for it.

136
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,011
You paid for it? I don't care.

137
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,079
But you like it?

138
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,147
I do like it.

139
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,851
I've never been to Barbados.
Are all the ladies as sexy as you?

140
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,087
It's a steaming pit
of sexual abandon.

141
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,489
I don't believe you.

142
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,859
Well, it used to be. I left.

143
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,463
Ah, come in.

144
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,403
Good morning, Counselor.

145
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,006
Good morning. Malkina.

146
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:09,974
<i>Hola, guapo.</i>

147
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,142
Hey.

148
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,879
How's Laura?
Incredible.

149
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,447
That sounds about right.

150
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,050
Nice lady, nice lady.

151
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:22,053
I assume that she's not privy
to your newest business venture.

152
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,355
She's not. And your lady?

153
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:25,857
Uh...

154
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:27,025
Yeah.

155
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,261
"Yeah," what?

156
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,031
I don't know what she knows.
I don't want to know.

157
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,199
You don't trust her?

158
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,335
Jesus, Counselor.
She's a woman.

159
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,370
I don't mean to
sound that cold.

160
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:44,309
I just mean that, where men are concerned,
they've got their own agenda.

161
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:48,079
I always liked smart women. But it's
been an expensive hobby, you know?

162
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,080
Yeah.

163
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,951
Do you know what
all that stuff is?

164
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,020
Mostly, yeah.

165
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:59,624
Anything I don't know, I can ask her.
Which worries me even more.

166
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,194
You never told me what happened

167
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,896
with you and the lovely Clarissa.

168
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:08,366
Ms. Clarissa of the extraordinary body.

169
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:12,937
I think in the end, it was jealousy
that undid us.

170
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,038
Jealousy?

171
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,573
Yeah, she was getting
more pussy than I was.

172
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,509
Is that true?

173
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,145
I think so.
Probably, yeah.

174
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,583
So, is this place secure?

175
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,951
Who knows?

176
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,287
I don't speak in arraignable
phrases anywhere.

177
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,090
There's a scrambler on
the phone, but still,

178
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,559
there's a lot of smart
people out there.

179
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:39,097
Of course, anybody who thinks
he's the smartest

180
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,065
is on his way to the slam.

181
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,066
Would that be me?

182
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,434
No, no.

183
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,070
Although, I have to
say that I always thought

184
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,406
a law degree was
a license to steal

185
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:51,609
and that you, for one,
hadn't really capitalized on it.

186
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,612
You're not the straight dude
people think though, are you?

187
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,080
I guess not.

188
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,983
I don't mean the caper,
I mean you. Women like you.

189
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,184
All right.

190
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,021
Do you know what
they like about you?

191
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,055
I'm a good fuck?

192
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,990
Right!

193
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:09,427
No, they can sniff out
the moral dilemma.

194
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,195
The paradox.

195
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,630
"Moral dilemma. "

196
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,133
Yeah, they're drawn to it.
Not sure why.

197
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:18,202
Maybe it's just that lacking any
moral sense themselves,

198
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,738
they're fascinated by it in men.

199
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,207
Men are attracted to flawed women,
too, of course,

200
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,309
but their illusion is that
they can fix them.

201
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,011
Women don't want
to fix anything.

202
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,013
They only want
to be entertained.

203
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,615
The truth about
women is you can

204
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,383
do anything to them
except bore them.

205
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,286
Well

206
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,122
there's nothing about Laura
that I would want to fix.

207
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,457
Maybe not.

208
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,025
Do you think she
knows things about me

209
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,727
that I don't know about myself?

210
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,130
Jesus, Counselor, I'm not even sure
what sort of question that is.

211
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,066
Yeah.

212
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,103
Okay.

213
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,746
If you pursue this road
that you've embarked upon,

214
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,583
you will eventually
come to moral decisions

215
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,252
that will take you
completely by surprise.

216
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,787
You won't see
it coming at all.

217
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,125
I don't intend to take
this up as a trade.

218
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,527
Yeah, one-time deal, right?

219
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,096
Which you've heard
a thousand times.

220
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,531
No, but a few.

221
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,068
What usually happens is that
after a couple of deals,

222
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,371
they know more than you do and
they set up shop across the street.

223
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,739
And how does that
work out for them?

224
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,708
Not well.

225
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,477
So, that would be a moral issue.

226
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,245
Not for me.

227
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,180
Or for your associates.

228
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,517
Yeah, well...

229
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,487
They have a real aversion to
mixing business with pleasure.

230
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,158
Do you know what a bolito is?

231
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,327
No.

232
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,096
A bolo is one of those
skinny neckties

233
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,799
or one of those things
you throw in Argentina.

234
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,667
Yeah, right.

235
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:01,372
No. In this case,
it's a mechanical device

236
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,774
and it has this
small electric motor

237
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,576
with this rather
incredible compound

238
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,445
gear that retrieves a steel cable.

239
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,613
Battery-driven.

240
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:11,315
And the cable is made out of
some unholy alloy,

241
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,817
almost impossible to cut it.

242
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,119
And it's in a loop.

243
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:19,290
And you come up behind the guy
and you drop it over his head

244
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,826
and you pull the free end of the
cable tight and walk away.

245
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,394
No one ever even sees you.

246
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,196
And pulling the cable
activates the motor

247
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,265
and the noose
starts to tighten

248
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,568
and it continues to tighten
until it goes to zero.

249
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,103
It cuts the guy's head off.

250
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,172
Yeah, well, it can.

251
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,406
There's nothing he can do.

252
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,175
No.

253
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,843
Jesus.

254
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,946
Yeah.

255
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,482
How long does it take?

256
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,717
Oh...

257
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,452
Three, four minutes, five maybe.

258
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,321
It depends on your collar size.

259
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,223
You're shitting me.

260
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,391
No, no, no.

261
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,626
It's just that there's no easy way

262
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,129
to turn the thing off,
or reason to.

263
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:01,432
It just keeps running until the noose
closes completely and then...

264
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,767
It self-destructs.

265
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:06,270
Actually, you're probably dead
in less than a minute.

266
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,872
From strangulation?

267
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,240
No.

268
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,178
The wire cuts through
the carotid arteries

269
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,614
and then sprays blood
all over the spectators

270
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,216
and everybody goes home.

271
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,284
Sweet.

272
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:23,221
Yeah, sweet.

273
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,656
Think about it, Counselor.

274
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,494
Here you go, ma'am.

275
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,498
Thank you.

276
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,302
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.

277
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,314
I have something to
discuss with you

278
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,516
and I'm a bit scared.

279
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,451
Hmm.

280
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,388
Have you been bad?

281
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,056
No.

282
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,030
Actually, I don't have that much
to discuss, so...

283
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,537
Let me just give you this

284
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,907
and tell me what you think.

285
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:05,923
Will you?

286
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,800
Don't leave me hanging, here.

287
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,003
Yes, I will!

288
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,617
Try it.

289
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,998
What, you didn't know?

290
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,669
I knew

291
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,971
but I was scared anyway.

292
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,074
That's good.

293
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,845
It's so beautiful.

294
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,082
You are a glory.

295
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,019
I'm a glory?

296
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,489
Yes.

297
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:14,859
As in "glorious. "
You're a glorious woman.

298
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,064
And you're a man
of impeccable taste.

299
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,167
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

300
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,437
You can't take it back.

301
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,072
Here.

302
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,478
I intend to love you until I die.

303
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,348
Me first.

304
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,016
Not on your life.

305
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,505
That's a nice ring.
How many carats is it?

306
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:02,706
I don't know.

307
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,575
You don't know?

308
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:05,676
No.

309
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,411
You've gotta be kidding me.

310
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,479
No, I don't know.

311
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,047
Let me see it.

312
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,583
No, take it off.

313
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,157
Mmm.

314
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,828
It's a 3.5 carat.
Maybe 3.8.

315
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,896
It's a nice stone.
It's Asscher cut.

316
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:26,997
Thank you.

317
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,466
Good color.

318
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,868
Probably an F, or a G.

319
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:36,607
Nothing visible,
so at least a VS2.

320
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:37,641
Wanna know how
much it's worth?

321
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,776
No.

322
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,581
You really don't, do you?

323
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,049
I really don't.

324
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,886
So, have you set a date?

325
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,988
Not yet.

326
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,792
I really want to get married in the Church.
And he's okay with that.

327
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:58,128
He was married before, so I thought
that would be a problem.

328
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,599
But the church doesn't
recognize other marriages, so...

329
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,434
Are you nervous?

330
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:04,635
A little bit.

331
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:07,071
Sometimes I am.

332
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,006
So, you're a church lady?

333
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,143
I go. It's important to me.

334
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,513
And what about confession?

335
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,147
Yeah.

336
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,782
Well, maybe not so much.

337
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,953
Does the priest
ever ask you about sex?

338
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,625
He doesn't ask, but you're supposed
to tell him everything.

339
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:28,792
And all the nasty shit you did,

340
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,528
you're just supposed to pretend like

341
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,162
you're never gonna
do it again, right?

342
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,498
I guess.

343
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,866
Hmm. Strange.

344
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:45,509
And suppose you've done
something really nasty?

345
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,278
He doesn't press
you for the details?

346
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,816
I don't think so.

347
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,520
You're blushing.

348
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:58,689
Mm-mmm.

349
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,492
Okay, we can change the subject.

350
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:03,627
We'll talk about my sex life.

351
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,664
You're teasing.

352
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,568
Just rattling your cage.

353
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,840
What a world.

354
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,881
Do you think the world is strange?

355
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,887
I meant yours.

356
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,527
<i>Hello?
Reiner, are you there?</i>

357
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,695
<i>Counselor.</i>

358
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:39,229
I think I'm in.

359
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:42,232
<i>You can't think, Counselor.
You're in or you're out.</i>

360
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,269
All right, I'm in. And thanks.

361
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,237
Don't thank me yet.

362
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,608
I won't say, "I hope you know what
you're doing" because you don't.

363
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,777
<i>But, money problems
are serious problems.</i>

364
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,647
<i>You keep telling yourself
it's not as bad as it appears</i>

365
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,716
and then one morning,
you realize it's worse.

366
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:01,885
My back is against
the fucking wall, man.

367
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,288
I believe you.

368
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,992
Do you have the cash?

369
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,927
I'll have it Thursday.

370
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,095
<i>All right.</i>

371
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,664
I'll call Westray and set it up.

372
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,081
Counselor.
Westray.

373
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,416
It's not dark enough in here for you?

374
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,154
Wow.

375
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,056
That's a dandy. What happened?

376
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,891
Confrontation with a doorman.

377
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,693
"Confrontation"?

378
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,828
Jesus.
What did you say to him?

379
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,631
I think I told him that he was
not to take it personally

380
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:48,766
but he should go fuck himself.

381
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,134
What did he say to that?

382
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,770
He said, "I'm gonna hurt you,
white person. "

383
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:53,904
What will you have?

384
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,239
I'll have a Heineken.

385
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,141
Make it two.

386
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,977
I didn't know you
got into donnybrooks.

387
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,078
I don't.

388
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,680
Anyway, it was in another country.

389
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,151
And besides,
the wretch is dead.

390
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:11,755
No, but I sent a pair of reliable
chaps to speak with him.

391
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,657
Bloody expensive, too.

392
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:14,658
You surprise me.

393
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,927
Counselor,
I'm just a middle man.

394
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:20,931
I know the smallest
crumb can devour us.

395
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:25,135
You learn not to let anything pass.
You can't afford to.

396
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,737
I should keep that in mind.

397
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:30,808
You might keep that in mind.
So, fire away.

398
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,377
All right. What do you
do with the money?

399
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,112
What do I do,
or what does one do?

400
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:36,180
What do you do?

401
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,817
Mine goes offshore.

402
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:41,485
We can talk about it if you like,
but you can't use my people.

403
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,287
All right.

404
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,723
Okay. Let me make a call.

405
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:46,824
All right.

406
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,892
What else?

407
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,694
You seem unsettled.

408
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,062
I'm all right.

409
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,298
Uh...

410
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,933
What's the buy-out
for this whole deal?

411
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:58,102
Net net?

412
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:00,237
Yeah. Net net.

413
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,772
It's hard to put
a cold dollar on it.

414
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:03,974
You don't know what your
expenses are up front.

415
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:08,312
It's 625 kilos, goes for about $50
an ounce in Colombia.

416
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:11,849
And the street value in Dallas
can go as high as two grand.

417
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,383
Is that where it's going?
Dallas?

418
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,853
No, it's going to Chicago.
Don't write that down.

419
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,888
We're probably
looking at 20 million.

420
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,523
Maybe a little more.

421
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,894
It's 21,900 ounces.

422
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,729
Good return on
your investment.

423
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,231
Did you do that in your head?

424
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:30,000
No, I remembered it.

425
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,402
But I know someone who
could do that in her head.

426
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,105
I'll bet you're right.

427
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,910
If you're not in,
you need to tell me.

428
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,812
I'm all right.

429
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,848
Here we go.

430
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,725
No, you're good.

431
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:55,859
Thank you.

432
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,728
Well, cheers.

433
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,231
A plague of pustulant boils
upon all their scurvid asses.

434
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,933
Is that your normal toast?

435
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,301
Increasingly.

436
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:10,073
So, if the drug wars stop

437
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,508
this will dry up, right?

438
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,877
Let's just say,
it will be more than risky.

439
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:17,481
That's the thing Reiner
doesn't seem to get.

440
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,449
You may have noticed his lifestyle

441
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,318
has become increasingly lavish.

442
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,420
I've noticed.

443
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,890
I don't set foot in his clubs.
And I miss the bastard.

444
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:30,928
We used to share a taste
for exotic women.

445
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,198
In fact, a few times shared
the women themselves.

446
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,999
That wouldn't include the
present one, would it?

447
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,870
Now, why would
you ask me that?

448
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,907
No reason. Sorry.

449
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,043
The answer is no, of course.
The civil answer.

450
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:48,478
But I see a murky picture forming
in that mind of yours.

451
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,348
How well do you
know Malkina?

452
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,918
Not very well. Why?

453
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,421
Because you don't know someone
until you know what they want

454
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:58,622
is why.

455
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,558
I'll try and remember that.

456
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,626
Good.

457
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,930
And Reiner?

458
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:08,198
Reiner.

459
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,901
Reiner is beyond advising.

460
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:13,270
Reiner thinks nothing
bad can happen.

461
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:15,973
And he's in love.

462
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:17,975
You two are going
to open a new club?

463
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,576
Is that all right?

464
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,979
Sure. Why not?
What the fuck.

465
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,984
Do you know how many people
were killed in Juarez last year?

466
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,986
No. A lot.

467
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:32,489
Yeah. I think 3,000 is a lot.

468
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,158
This is a different species,
Counselor.

469
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,928
They will rip out your liver
and feed it to your dog.

470
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,299
I should keep that in mind, too.

471
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,637
I can't advise you, Counselor.

472
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,874
But you are advising me.

473
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:54,044
I just need you to be sure
that you're locked in.

474
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:58,849
Because I don't know...

475
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:02,619
Maybe I should tell you what Mickey
Rourke told what's-his-face.

476
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:06,490
That's my recommendation anyway,
Counselor. Don't do it.

477
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:08,592
"This arson is a serious crime. "

478
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:11,328
Yeah. And so is this.

479
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,134
I guess I'm a little taken aback at

480
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:20,504
the cautionary nature
of this conversation.

481
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:22,906
Good word, "cautionary. "

482
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,641
In Scots law, it defines an instrument

483
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:27,110
in which one person stands
as surety for another.

484
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,146
As surety.
Yes.

485
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,981
Sounds a bit primitive.

486
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:31,982
It is.

487
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:34,117
The problem being,
of course

488
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,721
is what happens when the surety becomes
the more attractive holding?

489
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,023
What about you?

490
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:45,295
I can vanish in a heartbeat
with my money. Can you?

491
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:49,666
Truth is, Counselor, I can walk
away from all of this in a second.

492
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,902
And I mean all of it.

493
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:54,504
You're not gonna believe this,
but I'm going to tell you anyway.

494
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,940
I think about my life.

495
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,475
I can live in a monastery.

496
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:02,646
Scrub the steps, clean the pots,
try some gardening.

497
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,615
You're serious.

498
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,617
Very.

499
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:08,685
Why don't you?

500
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,322
In a word?
Women.

501
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,131
I've seen it all, Counselor.

502
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:24,634
It's all shit.
It's all shit.

503
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,571
I'll be in touch.

504
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,441
Hey, Counselor?

505
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,144
You want to know why Jesus
wasn't born in Mexico?

506
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,278
No, why?

507
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,281
Couldn't find three
wise men or a virgin.

508
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,422
And, Counselor, here's something
else to consider.

509
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:48,725
The beheadings and the mutilations?
That's just business.

510
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,061
You gotta keep up appearances.

511
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:54,965
It's not like there's some smoldering
rage at the bottom of it.

512
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:57,601
Let's see if we can guess who
it is they really want to kill.

513
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:59,503
I don't know. Who?

514
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:01,171
You, Counselor.

515
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,806
You.

516
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,401
What?

517
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,569
Yeah? Well, too bad.

518
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,334
Hey.

519
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:39,402
Did you bring cigarettes?

520
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,587
They treating you well?

521
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,656
Oh, yeah. Peachy.

522
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,564
You've got a preliminary hearing
on the 17th.

523
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,601
What size dress do you wear?

524
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,336
I wear a five.

525
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,705
What about shoes?

526
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,842
Five?

527
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,210
Yeah.

528
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,145
Hat?

529
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:23,280
What?

530
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:24,681
What size hat?

531
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,483
A hat?

532
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:28,885
I don't know what size hat.

533
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,887
What the fuck do
I need a hat for?

534
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:35,225
A hat? You're shitting me.

535
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:36,293
Yes.

536
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:41,331
You're a smartass.

537
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,200
You had me going
there for a minute.

538
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,872
So, you gonna get me
something sexy to wear?

539
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,174
No.

540
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:53,777
You'll probably have me looking
like a fucking schoolmarm.

541
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,546
How about a businesswoman?

542
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,249
Yeah. Some business.

543
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,617
All right.

544
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,319
What was it you
wanted to tell me?

545
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:06,323
My kid is in jail.

546
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,325
Oh, boy.

547
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:09,960
Where?

548
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,295
Fort Hancock.

549
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,966
What was he doing
in Fort Hancock?

550
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,735
He was coming to see me.

551
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,271
What's he in jail for?

552
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:22,372
Speeding.

553
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:23,773
Speeding?
Yeah.

554
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,878
Son of a bitch.

555
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,314
What,
he couldn't pay the fine?

556
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:35,852
He had $12,000 on him,
but they took that off him.

557
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,922
How did you find this out?

558
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,291
He called.

559
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:43,960
What else is he charged with?

560
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,029
I don't know.

561
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,299
Some other stuff.

562
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:51,334
And how fast was he going?

563
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:52,869
206.

564
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,406
206.
Yeah.

565
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,776
What is that, "206"?

566
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,246
That's not a speed.

567
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:07,250
That's somebody's weight,
or a time of day.

568
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:11,254
You're telling me he was going
206 miles an hour? In what?

569
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:14,257
On that Jap bike of his.

570
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:16,693
Listen, if you could
get his money back,

571
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:19,396
he could pay the fine
and get out of there.

572
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:21,464
He's not getting
his money back.

573
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,567
How much is the fine?

574
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:25,902
$400.

575
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:28,405
Jesus.

576
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,540
I don't guess you
would spring for it.

577
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,809
Christ, $400?

578
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:34,978
Yeah.

579
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,915
All right.

580
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,650
"All right" what?

581
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,253
All right, I'll get him out.

582
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:45,422
Thanks. I owe you.

583
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:47,424
Yes, you do.

584
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:49,959
How about a blowjob?

585
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,431
You would still owe me $380.

586
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,468
Damn, but you
are a smartass.

587
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,604
I know.
You bring it out in me.

588
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,977
Lighten up, Ruthie.

589
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:09,446
Don't call me that.

590
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:11,848
I hate that name.

591
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,718
I don't even like "Ruth. "

592
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,861
Take care, Ruth.

593
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:26,896
Guard.

594
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,707
Pull over.

595
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,424
How are you doing?

596
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,459
Ugh.

597
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,096
Get this thing out of here.

598
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:01,898
You got it.

599
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,999
Go.

600
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,042
Ah!

601
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,223
Sorry. I got held up.

602
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,161
How are you, man?

603
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:41,030
You see a place like this in the cold
light of day, it looks pretty seedy.

604
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,565
But you get the right
lighting in here

605
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,868
and some music,
some good-looking girls,

606
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,135
and it's a whole other world.

607
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,470
Jesus.

608
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:48,771
We're looking
for cash flow here.

609
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,077
So, how soon do you think?

610
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,145
Two weeks. Three, max.

611
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,715
Yeah.

612
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,551
Are you gonna
keep the dance floor?

613
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:02,852
Yeah. A dance floor
takes up a lot of space

614
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,755
but you try and chat up
a girl at a bar,

615
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:07,924
she's supposed to
tell you to fuck off.

616
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:09,959
She doesn't want to
look like a bitch.

617
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:12,562
But,
you ask a chick to dance,

618
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,766
well, you got a better shot.

619
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:21,604
Anyway, the other big
space-eater is the bandstand.

620
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:24,774
I think what I'm gonna do
is take the wall out

621
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:27,544
and get rid of
the hallway, yeah.

622
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:28,811
I think that will do it.

623
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:30,880
Yeah. All right.

624
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:34,684
I'll talk to my guy and it
should take two or three days.

625
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:35,785
That's my boy.

626
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,541
There he is.

627
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:01,711
I won't be able to get what
the kid is saying. Is that okay?

628
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:04,581
We don't care what
the kid is saying.

629
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,586
Did you get it?

630
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:12,322
Yeah. It's not much.

631
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,757
That's okay.

632
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,627
Keep your eye on him.

633
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:20,630
This guy doesn't read
the fucking newspapers.

634
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:22,899
I know.

635
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:25,702
Could you see what it was?

636
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:28,671
Nope. But it's in the helmet.

637
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,074
Yeah.

638
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:32,609
It's in the helmet.

639
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,688
<i>Yes?
We got him.</i>

640
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,759
<i>Good. Stay with him,
and call me back in an hour.</i>

641
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:05,842
Come here.

642
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,980
Well, Counselor,
how are you making it?

643
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:12,982
I'm all right.

644
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:14,717
Is this your lady?

645
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,853
It is.

646
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:18,254
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

647
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,189
Me and the Counselor
go back a ways.

648
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:21,791
We do, I'm afraid.

649
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:22,859
Don't be afraid.

650
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:24,293
Hell,
I'm okay with everything.

651
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:25,795
Are you okay with everything,
Counselor?

652
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,632
I am if you are.

653
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:32,035
See, now, ain't he just
the best son of a bitch?

654
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:33,736
All right, Tony, let's go.

655
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:35,371
How long have you
known this guy, petunia?

656
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:36,706
Long enough.

657
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:39,776
Maybe you should listen
to your lady friend.

658
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:40,777
Is that what
you do, Counselor?

659
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:41,878
Pretty much.

660
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,012
Does he keep you entertained?

661
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,214
None of your business.

662
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:47,083
Because you look to me
like you might get bored easy.

663
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:49,152
Tony, let's go.

664
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:50,186
Tony, I'm leaving.

665
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,755
Hell, Counselor,
keep your seat.

666
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:54,223
You don't have
to get up for me.

667
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:57,126
See, petunia, the Counselor has
a way of sullin' up like a possum

668
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,795
when he don't get his own way.

669
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:01,097
I'm going to say
you probably noticed it.

670
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:03,199
But that ain't
really the problem.

671
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,701
The real problem is

672
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:06,736
his thin skin makes
it okay in his eyes

673
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:08,705
for you to wind
up under the bus.

674
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,708
Do you know what I'm saying?

675
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:15,378
Anyhow, that's how I see it.

676
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,846
You take care now, you hear?

677
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,117
Baby!

678
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,922
Who was that?

679
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:27,857
It's an old client.

680
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,327
It goes with the territory.

681
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,231
I'm sorry.

682
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:01,824
Hi.

683
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,128
"Hi"?

684
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,065
Oh, um...

685
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,003
Bless me,
Father, for I have sinned.

686
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,406
And?

687
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,711
How long has it been
since your last confession?

688
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:24,247
Well, I've never been before.

689
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,849
This is my first.

690
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,351
Are you Catholic?

691
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:29,919
No.

692
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,322
Then I cannot
give you absolution.

693
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:34,757
I know

694
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:36,893
but I just wanted to tell
somebody what I had done

695
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:38,928
and I thought, "Why not
go to a professional?"

696
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,030
Have you thought about
taking instructions?

697
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:43,065
That's not
something I do very well.

698
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:45,201
I mean, in order to
become a Catholic.

699
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:47,003
Then you could confess

700
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:48,971
and you will be
forgiven for your sins.

701
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,308
What if they're unforgivable?

702
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,745
Nothing is unforgivable.

703
00:46:55,747 --> 00:46:57,213
Oh, yeah?

704
00:46:57,215 --> 00:47:00,917
Well, I haven't killed anybody,
but I've been pretty bad.

705
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:03,753
Look, we have people here
waiting to go to confession

706
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:04,921
so, I'm sorry.

707
00:47:04,923 --> 00:47:06,289
They can wait.

708
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,225
I did.

709
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:10,793
Who did you
talk to about this?

710
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:12,395
Why did I talk to somebody?

711
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:14,197
You said "Bless me, Father. "

712
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:16,933
Well, I asked a friend but she
didn't know I was gonna do it.

713
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:18,501
So we're done here then?

714
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,436
I haven't told
you my sins yet.

715
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:23,139
I don't want to hear your
sins. There would be no point.

716
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,242
Were you baptized?

717
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:28,411
I don't know. It's possible.

718
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:29,779
Your parents never told you?

719
00:47:29,781 --> 00:47:31,781
I never knew my parents.

720
00:47:31,783 --> 00:47:33,850
They were thrown out of a
helicopter into the Atlantic Ocean

721
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:35,184
when I was three.

722
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,421
Listen

723
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:40,489
you don't have to do
the whole forgiveness thing.

724
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,625
All you have to do is listen.

725
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,127
To the sins.

726
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,832
Women tell you
about sex, don't they?

727
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:52,501
I can't talk about that.

728
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:55,938
Yeah, but every woman who
goes to confess tells you

729
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,140
that she's an adulterer
or fornicator or something

730
00:47:58,142 --> 00:48:00,843
or why else
would she be there?

731
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:05,248
So you must have a very
unusual picture of women.

732
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,017
You must think that they're
just having sex all the time...

733
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:09,852
You really need to go now.

734
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:11,988
If you don't leave,
I leave.

735
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,222
Wait, where are you going?

736
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,392
I wasn't finished.

737
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,197
I don't know.

738
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,300
Women have funny
ideas about sex.

739
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,404
They're supposed
to be so modest.

740
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:30,907
Let me tell you,
when they get it

741
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,341
in their heads how
they want to fuck

742
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:33,576
they're like a freight train.

743
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:36,145
Sign here.

744
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:39,081
The things I've
learned about women.

745
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,216
Fuck.

746
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:42,885
About half of it I
would like to forget.

747
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:44,854
I'm not sure if I follow you.

748
00:48:44,856 --> 00:48:47,356
What is it you would like
to forget, for instance?

749
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,258
You don't want to know.

750
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,361
Sure I do.

751
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,965
I don't know. Let's talk
about something else.

752
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,967
Here.

753
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:00,269
Just pull up your
socks and tell me.

754
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,006
Yeah

755
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,176
I don't know.

756
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:09,111
What is it you
would like to forget?

757
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,980
All right.

758
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:13,082
I would like to forget
about Malkina fucking my car.

759
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,917
What?

760
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:16,085
See?

761
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:17,887
What did you just say?

762
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:21,657
I said I would like to forget
about Malkina fucking my car.

763
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,894
What the hell are
you talking about?

764
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:27,430
Do you remember
that yellow California I had?

765
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,398
Sure. Nice car.

766
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,467
Very nice car.

767
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:36,405
Anyway, this was a while back,
not that long.

768
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:41,010
We'd been getting it on for a
while, and we came back one night.

769
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:44,013
<i>We were staying
up at Cloudcroft.</i>

770
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:48,050
<i>We drove out on a golf course
and parked.</i>

771
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:50,086
And we're sitting there,
talking

772
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:53,689
and for no particular reason
that I could see,

773
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:56,959
she slides off her knickers

774
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:59,595
<i>and hands them to me
and gets out of the car.</i>

775
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:01,130
I asked her what
she was doing

776
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:04,000
and she says, "I'm
going to fuck your car. "

777
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,035
All right.

778
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:08,037
Leave the door open.

779
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:14,110
<i>So</i>

780
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:18,581
<i>she goes around and climbs up
on the hood of the Ferrari</i>

781
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:23,986
<i>and pulls her dress up
around her waist</i>

782
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:26,489
<i>and spreads herself
across the windshield</i>

783
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:30,226
<i>in front of me
with no panties on.</i>

784
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:35,464
<i>And she's had this
Brazilian wax job, you know?</i>

785
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,299
Don't even think
I'm making this up.

786
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:39,201
You can't make
this up, all right?

787
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,070
<i>I mean, she was a dancer.</i>

788
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:44,473
<i>So,
she does this full split</i>

789
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:49,712
<i>and then she starts rubbing
herself up and down on the glass.</i>

790
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:52,748
<i>Then she leans down
to see if I'm watching.</i>

791
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,451
<i>Like, no, I'm sitting there
reading my email.</i>

792
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:59,388
<i>And she kisses me upside down.</i>

793
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,190
<i>And then she tells me
that she's going to come.</i>

794
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:04,126
<i>I thought, "I'm losing my fucking
mind. That's what's happening here. "</i>

795
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:07,096
<i>It was like one of those,</i>

796
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:11,367
one of those catfish things.
You know? One of those...

797
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,037
One of those
bottom-feeders you see

798
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:16,639
going up the side
of the aquarium,

799
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:19,375
sucking its way up the glass.

800
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:21,710
<i>I mean,
it was, I don't know...</i>

801
00:51:23,714 --> 00:51:25,181
...hallucinatory.

802
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:28,117
You see a thing like that,
it changes you.

803
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,087
Jesus.

804
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:32,655
Yeah, tell me about it.

805
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:35,825
Did she?

806
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,228
Did she what?

807
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:41,664
Did she come?

808
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:45,134
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

809
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:47,103
<i>Finally she climbs down
and she comes around</i>

810
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:49,171
<i>and she gets in the car
and shuts the door.</i>

811
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:51,340
I hand her her knickers,
she puts them in her purse

812
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:54,710
and she looks at me to see
what I thought about that.

813
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,814
<i>What I thought about it?</i>

814
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:01,150
Well, I don't know
what I thought about it.

815
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:04,820
I mean, I still don't.

816
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:09,592
It was too gynecological
to be sexy. Almost.

817
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:11,627
But mostly,
I was just fucking stunned.

818
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,131
And I asked her if she
had ever done that before

819
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:17,566
and she said she had done
everything before. And I believe her.

820
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,739
Jesus. Catfish?

821
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:26,575
I don't know.
I think so, yeah.

822
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:28,077
Do you think
she knew what kind

823
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,578
of effect this
might have on a guy?

824
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,715
Jesus, Counselor, are you
kidding? She knows everything.

825
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:38,187
You don't think this is
an odd thing to tell me?

826
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:40,189
I think it is an odd thing.

827
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:41,790
No, I mean,
why is it okay to tell

828
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,392
a thing like that
about somebody...

829
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:45,628
Somebody I'm banging?

830
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,198
Come on, Reiner.

831
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,568
Okay, I don't know,
you're probably right.

832
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:55,371
Maybe I wanted to see
what you would say.

833
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:58,474
Maybe there's more to it
than that. Maybe I'm scared.

834
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,509
You're scared?

835
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,610
Yeah.

836
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:04,446
Probably, yeah. Sometimes...

837
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:07,116
She scares
the shit out of me.

838
00:53:07,118 --> 00:53:08,651
Because of that?

839
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:10,319
No, not that. But...

840
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,255
You're in love with her.

841
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:15,157
I don't know what I am.

842
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:18,260
Yeah, I guess
I'm in love with her, but

843
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,730
you don't think
that's cause for worry?

844
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,567
It's like being
in love with

845
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:28,637
easeful death.

846
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,906
Well, I don't know what it is
that you're trying to tell me.

847
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:32,908
I know.

848
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,345
Does this have anything
to do with the deal?

849
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,948
I don't know.

850
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,919
You're right.

851
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:45,888
I shouldn't have told you.

852
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,756
Just forget it. Forget it.

853
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:49,725
Forget it?
Yeah.

854
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,494
How do you propose I do that?

855
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:55,197
Jesus, Counselor,
how do I know?

856
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,532
Just forget it.

857
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:17,253
I gotta go.

858
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:25,361
Sir, may I help you?

859
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,566
Nope.

860
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,567
<i>Are you there?</i>

861
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,571
Anything?

862
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:25,073
<i>He's coming.</i>

863
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:28,210
Yeah, I hear him.

864
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,579
All right, let's do it.

865
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:37,913
<i>Jamie, come in.</i>

866
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:42,217
<i>Are we okay?</i>

867
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,920
We're good.

868
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:47,022
I know.

869
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,892
I just wanted to
hear your voice.

870
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:54,997
Don't go there.

871
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,536
You're just glowing
with sexual health?

872
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:03,906
I love it.

873
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,777
Yes.

874
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:12,147
Bad. Badly.

875
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:18,554
You haven't been taking liberties
with your person, have you?

876
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,692
You couldn't touch it
with a powder puff?

877
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,131
It's too boring.

878
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,968
I kept waking up
thinking you were there.

879
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:36,171
I could smell your perfume
on the sheets.

880
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:42,778
What I said was,

881
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:48,517
"Here, let me help you off
with your damp things. "

882
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:51,219
And then I pull
down your panties.

883
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,225
Oh, my goodness.

884
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,931
Is this phone sex?

885
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:08,136
I know.

886
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:11,173
Life is being in bed with you.

887
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:13,609
Everything else
is just waiting.

888
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:17,713
I love you very much.

889
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,616
Good night.

890
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:03,325
Do you know
which truck it is?

891
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,994
Yeah.
It's got Arizona plates.

892
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,245
Do you know how it goes?

893
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:24,346
Yeah.

894
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:26,715
It's color-coded.

895
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,351
Red to red.

896
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,355
Green to green.

897
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:35,857
Black to black.

898
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,759
See if it will start.

899
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:44,232
Wait a minute.

900
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,269
This thing has
got a switch on it.

901
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,907
Try it now.

902
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:07,122
<i>Counselor.</i>

903
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:08,857
We've got a problem.

904
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,793
<i>Are you there?</i>

905
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:14,196
I'm here.

906
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:16,898
How bad a problem?

907
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,967
Let's say pretty bad.

908
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:20,802
And then multiply it by 10.

909
01:02:20,804 --> 01:02:22,003
Fuck.

910
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:24,039
Meet me in
the atrium at the Coronado.

911
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:26,174
<i>Coronado? When?</i>

912
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:27,743
Now.

913
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:31,113
We can start getting used
to our new lifestyle.

914
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:05,213
Morning.

915
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,782
Have you seen the paper?

916
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:07,883
Nope.

917
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,257
Do you know who
the Green Hornet is?

918
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:18,827
The Green Hornet?
Yes.

919
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:20,295
He's a cartoon character.

920
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,897
He's a biker.

921
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,199
Shit.

922
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:25,267
Mmm.

923
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,502
All right, what?

924
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:29,371
Is he in custody?

925
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:30,438
It's in the paper.

926
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:32,507
What has he done?

927
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:34,142
You don't know
anything about this?

928
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,811
About what?

929
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:37,813
Like I said,
it's in the paper.

930
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:44,786
He had no ID on him?
No.

931
01:03:44,788 --> 01:03:46,354
No head either.

932
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:47,889
What the hell is this?

933
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:49,991
I was hoping
you would tell me.

934
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:52,961
I had a call from
our business partners.

935
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:55,197
They wanted to speak with you.

936
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:57,833
It seems the deceased
was working for them.

937
01:03:57,835 --> 01:03:59,467
Now the shipment is missing

938
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:02,938
and all they have to go on is
that he was a client of yours.

939
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,240
Client? He wasn't a client.

940
01:04:05,242 --> 01:04:06,975
You got him out of jail.

941
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:09,144
That doesn't
make him a client.

942
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:11,880
It was a speeding ticket,
for Christ's sake.

943
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,950
Jesus.

944
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:16,084
I am perfectly
willing to believe

945
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:17,452
you had nothing
to do with this

946
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:19,988
but I am not the party
you need to convince.

947
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:22,390
Convince of what,
for Christ's sake?

948
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,926
That this is just
some sort of coincidence.

949
01:04:24,928 --> 01:04:28,964
They're a pragmatic lot. They
don't believe in coincidences.

950
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:31,399
They've heard of them,
they've just never seen one.

951
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,303
So, what happened
to the shipment?

952
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:36,471
I asked them that.

953
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:38,306
And?

954
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:40,475
<i>They said, "Se fue. "</i>

955
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:41,943
It's gone?

956
01:04:41,945 --> 01:04:43,011
Mmm.

957
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:45,213
Jesus.

958
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:49,084
Does his mother know? I guess
she does. I need to call her.

959
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:52,120
That is probably
not a good idea.

960
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:53,288
Why?

961
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,457
She said she's going
to have you killed.

962
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:58,026
Sweet Jesus!

963
01:04:58,028 --> 01:05:00,896
Sorry about that.
What can I get you to drink?

964
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:02,197
Hemlock.

965
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,331
I'm sorry?

966
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:05,834
I'll have an OJ and a coffee.

967
01:05:05,836 --> 01:05:08,370
He'll be having a double
Maalox and a side of Oxycontin.

968
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:10,605
Just bring us the two coffees.

969
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:12,040
And my OJ.

970
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:21,016
How did you wind up with her?

971
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,119
The mother?

972
01:05:24,121 --> 01:05:27,055
Yes, the mother.
The mother of all mothers.

973
01:05:27,057 --> 01:05:29,457
Court appointment.

974
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:31,860
It's an appeal. One of
Ferguson's fucked-up deals.

975
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:36,264
Look, they can't hook me onto
this thing, mother or no mother.

976
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:40,602
Well, I don't know what the kid
told her, or what she told the kid.

977
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:43,405
But at this juncture, I would
avoid trying to explain myself.

978
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:45,607
What do they think I would do
with this shit?

979
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,142
They don't know.
They don't care.

980
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:49,344
They think everybody
is hooked into something.

981
01:05:49,346 --> 01:05:51,579
You need to think
about this, Counselor.

982
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:53,515
These people are out 20 mil.

983
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:56,084
Do you understand
how serious this is?

984
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:00,922
They think we're all involved,
don't they? Reiner, too?

985
01:06:00,924 --> 01:06:04,025
What do you think?
You fucking genius.

986
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,098
Have you ever
seen a snuff film?

987
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,900
No. You?

988
01:06:11,902 --> 01:06:13,034
Would you?

989
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:14,135
I would not.

990
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:18,039
Because the consumer
of the product

991
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:20,041
is essential to
its production.

992
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:25,113
You cannot watch without
being accessory to a murder.

993
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:26,448
Will there be anything else?

994
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,049
No, thank you.

995
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,688
Do you know
somebody who's seen one?

996
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:36,291
Yes, I do.

997
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:39,527
He said the young girl was
looking into the camera, crying

998
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:42,263
when her head was lopped off.

999
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:44,499
Think about that
the next time you do a line.

1000
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,034
I don't do drugs.

1001
01:06:46,036 --> 01:06:48,103
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

1002
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:50,138
Because what follows,
I would hope

1003
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,340
would be beyond your
powers of imagination.

1004
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:58,179
They let a figure in, wearing
only a hood with eyeholes

1005
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:04,152
to address himself to the
headless and quivering corpse.

1006
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:09,424
Which, you must remember, was selected
because of her youth and beauty.

1007
01:07:09,426 --> 01:07:13,061
And all of this,
he has paid for.

1008
01:07:13,063 --> 01:07:17,599
So, what do you think
that cost? Ballpark?

1009
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:19,801
Jesus.

1010
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:21,503
Mmm.

1011
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:24,272
God.

1012
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:26,441
The point, Counselor

1013
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:29,010
is that you may think
there are things that

1014
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:31,246
these people are
simply incapable of.

1015
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:32,580
There are not.

1016
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:38,153
Counselor, I don't know
what you should do.

1017
01:07:38,155 --> 01:07:41,056
But at this point,
it's out of your hands.

1018
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,193
What about you?

1019
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:48,196
I've known this day was
coming for a long time.

1020
01:07:48,198 --> 01:07:51,166
Do I regret what I've done?
That's sophomoric.

1021
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:54,302
I should've jumped ship a
long time ago, and I didn't.

1022
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:58,740
So, what happens next?

1023
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:01,409
I'm going to go find a nice,
quiet place,

1024
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:04,212
and sit down and
think about this.

1025
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:08,216
I would suggest you do the
same, but I know you won't.

1026
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:09,484
If you think,
Counselor,

1027
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:12,087
that you can live in this
world and be no part of it,

1028
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:14,222
then all I can
say is you're wrong.

1029
01:08:14,224 --> 01:08:17,559
It's not that you're
going down, Counselor

1030
01:08:17,561 --> 01:08:19,494
it's what you're
taking down with you.

1031
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,527
Excuse me, ma'am.

1032
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:54,529
I'm terribly
sorry to bother you

1033
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:58,666
but my phone is out
and it's my kid's birthday.

1034
01:08:58,668 --> 01:09:01,669
May I please use your phone
for just a minute?

1035
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:03,771
Sure.

1036
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:05,607
Thank you.

1037
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:16,117
Where are you?

1038
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:18,653
I can't call you
on my cell anymore.

1039
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:23,158
Now, listen to me. Go home and
wait for me there, I'll call you.

1040
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,393
I'll explain everything later.

1041
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,697
I love you.

1042
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:32,200
I'll call you later. Okay.

1043
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:35,803
Thank you.

1044
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:37,872
I hope you didn't call China.

1045
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:40,141
Have a nice day.

1046
01:09:40,143 --> 01:09:41,209
You, too.

1047
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:00,328
Fuck.

1048
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,847
Switch off the engine.

1049
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,383
They're not cops.

1050
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:23,952
These guys are cartel.

1051
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,699
Switch off your engine!

1052
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:42,370
Go check it out.

1053
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,316
Ah!

1054
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,563
No problems.

1055
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:50,398
Got to go.

1056
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,400
Bodies on the road.

1057
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,536
You talked to him.

1058
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:56,971
Yeah, I talked to him.

1059
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:02,410
I don't feel comfortable here.
Can we go somewhere else?

1060
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:04,445
Sure.

1061
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:05,380
Come on.

1062
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:21,696
You think I know something you
don't, Counselor? What would that be?

1063
01:13:21,698 --> 01:13:25,066
I don't know what "how
bad" means. Bad is bad.

1064
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,468
Westray thinks we're fucked.
"We"?

1065
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:28,369
Yeah.

1066
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:30,838
All right.
I suppose I could ask you

1067
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,374
if you've got
a rat in your pocket.

1068
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:35,643
You're not serious.

1069
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:39,414
Well, when was the last time
you tried to call him?

1070
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,782
Yesterday. Why?

1071
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:42,116
Why?

1072
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:44,185
Because I couldn't
reach him now, all right?

1073
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,426
What are you going to do?

1074
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,495
I don't know.

1075
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,531
What are you?

1076
01:13:56,533 --> 01:13:57,565
I don't know.

1077
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,903
That's what Westray said.
But he did know, didn't he?

1078
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:08,409
What are you going
to use for money?

1079
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:10,011
I've got some money.
I don't think so.

1080
01:14:10,013 --> 01:14:11,679
If you had any
serious money,

1081
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:13,414
you wouldn't be in this
jackpot in the first place.

1082
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:14,549
I might.
Oh, yeah?

1083
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:17,084
Well, I know why I'm in it.
Do you?

1084
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,986
Sure. Same as you. Greed.

1085
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:20,455
Yeah?

1086
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:23,424
No. You got in trouble.

1087
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:26,561
I tried to appeal
to your greed two years ago.

1088
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:28,963
No deal. Now, it's too late.

1089
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,232
It's too late.

1090
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:33,701
What do you think I should do?

1091
01:14:33,703 --> 01:14:36,904
I don't know, Counselor.
I don't know.

1092
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,107
They know
that you're stupid.

1093
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:42,477
They just don't
know how stupid.

1094
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,484
You say that like
it's my hole card.

1095
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,555
Maybe it is.

1096
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,190
Suppose you could sit
down and have a chat

1097
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:57,758
with these guys,
what would you say?

1098
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,161
I'd tell them the truth.

1099
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:03,498
You're just a fucking wonder,
do you know that?

1100
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,566
Go ahead.
Go ahead what?

1101
01:15:05,568 --> 01:15:07,768
With the truth.
I'd like to hear it.

1102
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:09,570
I'd tell them that
I never even met this kid.

1103
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:11,539
That I got him out of jail
on a speeding charge.

1104
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:13,608
<i>Okay, how did he
happen to hire you?</i>

1105
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:16,077
<i>He didn't. I got him out
of jail as a favor to his mother.</i>

1106
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:18,579
<i>How do you happen
to know the mother?</i>

1107
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,548
<i>I was appointed by
the court to represent her</i>

1108
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:22,583
<i>in an appeal on
a capital murder case.</i>

1109
01:15:22,585 --> 01:15:24,552
Do you know what her son
did for a living?

1110
01:15:24,554 --> 01:15:25,620
No.

1111
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:26,888
But you do now.

1112
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:29,790
I do now.

1113
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:31,459
And would it please
you to tell the court

1114
01:15:31,461 --> 01:15:32,660
what that occupation was?

1115
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:36,197
How did I get in court?

1116
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:38,132
I thought I was
talking to cartel guys.

1117
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:41,669
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I was
giving you the easiest way out.

1118
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:44,705
Very funny.

1119
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,974
Yeah, well, probably not.

1120
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:51,679
I'm really worried, baby.

1121
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:54,682
It's going to be all right.
I'll take care of it.

1122
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:55,816
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1123
01:15:55,818 --> 01:15:57,552
Can't you meet me someplace?

1124
01:15:57,554 --> 01:15:58,686
<i>I can't right now.</i>

1125
01:15:58,688 --> 01:16:01,155
That's not
possible that you can't.

1126
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:02,223
God, I miss you.

1127
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:05,192
Meet me.

1128
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:07,828
We really have to be careful.

1129
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,997
<i>How bad is it?</i>

1130
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,733
How bad is it?

1131
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,335
All right, where?

1132
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:18,606
How about Boise?

1133
01:16:18,608 --> 01:16:19,907
<i>Boise?</i>

1134
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:21,842
Boise.

1135
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:25,846
Why Boise?

1136
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:27,882
What's wrong with Boise?

1137
01:16:27,884 --> 01:16:29,884
Have you ever been to Boise?

1138
01:16:29,886 --> 01:16:31,586
No, have you?

1139
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:33,754
No.

1140
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:38,359
<i>Do you have a hotel?</i>

1141
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:41,662
I'm looking as we speak.

1142
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:46,601
Tomorrow.

1143
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:48,636
Boise.

1144
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:51,672
<i>Yeah, Boise.</i>

1145
01:16:51,674 --> 01:16:54,709
<i>I'll leave you a message
at the Delta counter.</i>

1146
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:56,043
Okay.

1147
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:58,846
<i>Baby, I'm so sorry.
I'll set this straight.</i>

1148
01:16:58,848 --> 01:16:59,981
I know.

1149
01:16:59,983 --> 01:17:02,149
<i>I love you.
I love you.</i>

1150
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:04,285
<i>Be safe.</i>

1151
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:38,085
So

1152
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:40,321
<i>where do you think this
is going, mi capitan?</i>

1153
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:42,723
This?

1154
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:43,991
Yes.

1155
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:50,965
I can't really
take your question seriously.

1156
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:57,238
It's going where it's going.

1157
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,708
Well, either you think
it's all going to work out

1158
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:03,444
or you don't want
to think about it at all.

1159
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:07,715
Because the third alternative
is unacceptable?

1160
01:18:07,717 --> 01:18:09,617
Yes.

1161
01:18:09,619 --> 01:18:11,686
The excluded middle.

1162
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,990
I don't like
decisions made for me.

1163
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:19,293
But if you put them off, waiting
for the maximum information

1164
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:21,295
that may be what happens.

1165
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:23,831
You think there's
still space enough

1166
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:26,300
to make the decision,
and then there isn't.

1167
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:29,003
"Space. "
Yeah.

1168
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:33,441
Greed really takes you
to the edge, doesn't it?

1169
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:38,813
That's not what greed does.
That's what greed is.

1170
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,784
When the axe comes
through the door

1171
01:18:43,786 --> 01:18:45,820
I'll already be gone.
You know that.

1172
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:49,290
That's fair enough.

1173
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,796
You're in trouble.

1174
01:18:55,798 --> 01:18:58,165
Yeah, probably.

1175
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:01,368
I don't want to lose you.

1176
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:04,739
There.

1177
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:08,209
I know.

1178
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:09,944
Are you hungry?

1179
01:19:09,946 --> 01:19:11,879
I'm starving.

1180
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:52,079
Fuck. Fuck!

1181
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:08,395
Shit!

1182
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:24,845
Intercept him!
We want him alive!

1183
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:26,113
<i>Got it!</i>

1184
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,966
Fuck.

1185
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,959
No!

1186
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:13,928
What the fuck did you do?

1187
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:33,007
<i>Do you know where Reiner is?</i>

1188
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:34,074
Nope.

1189
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:37,011
He doesn't answer his cell.

1190
01:23:37,013 --> 01:23:39,713
And the phone at the club
is no longer in service.

1191
01:23:39,715 --> 01:23:41,215
Where are you?

1192
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:43,150
I'm at home.

1193
01:23:43,152 --> 01:23:45,219
I'm surprised to hear
you're still there.

1194
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,521
Well, I won't be in an hour.

1195
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,459
An hour.

1196
01:23:52,461 --> 01:23:55,429
Yeah. Where are you?

1197
01:23:55,431 --> 01:23:57,031
I'm not at home.

1198
01:23:57,033 --> 01:23:58,465
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

1199
01:23:58,467 --> 01:24:01,035
What are you,
a mental defective?

1200
01:24:01,037 --> 01:24:02,736
I can't advise you, Counselor.
Call a cab.

1201
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:06,573
Listen,

1202
01:24:06,575 --> 01:24:09,410
if your definition of a friend
is someone who will die for you...

1203
01:24:09,412 --> 01:24:10,644
then you don't
have any friends.

1204
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:13,747
<i>I gotta go. You take care.</i>

1205
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:42,236
No!

1206
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,895
Are you all right here, sir?

1207
01:26:41,897 --> 01:26:43,230
Sorry?

1208
01:26:43,232 --> 01:26:44,264
Can I bring you something?

1209
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:48,335
Would you do something for me?

1210
01:26:48,337 --> 01:26:49,436
Yes, sir. Of course.

1211
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:55,342
Here's my card.

1212
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,512
I'm a guest at the hotel.

1213
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:01,815
What I wish you
would do for me is go

1214
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:03,517
to the desk and see
if I have any messages.

1215
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:06,620
I know you're wondering
why I don't go myself,

1216
01:27:06,622 --> 01:27:08,722
but I've
bothered them so much

1217
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:12,359
I think they're beginning to
figure me for some sort of nutcase.

1218
01:27:12,361 --> 01:27:13,360
Sure.

1219
01:27:13,362 --> 01:27:14,561
I'm afraid
they'll stop looking.

1220
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:15,862
You got it.

1221
01:27:53,535 --> 01:27:55,302
<i>Abogado Hernandez?</i>

1222
01:27:55,304 --> 01:27:56,570
<i>I need your help.</i>

1223
01:27:56,572 --> 01:27:58,272
<i>Can I come see you?</i>

1224
01:27:58,274 --> 01:28:01,208
<i>No problem.
Tomorrow.</i>

1225
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:02,276
<i>Thank you.</i>

1226
01:28:16,292 --> 01:28:17,557
Upstairs.

1227
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,577
All right.

1228
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:40,881
I have made the call.

1229
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:42,883
You understand?

1230
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,420
If it is all right,
it is all right.

1231
01:28:46,422 --> 01:28:49,089
Don't put me in the center.
Okay?

1232
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:51,858
"In the middle. "

1233
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:54,061
In the middle, yeah.

1234
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,597
What do I owe you?

1235
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:05,605
You owe me nothing, Counselor.
We are friends.

1236
01:29:05,607 --> 01:29:07,574
Just a handshake.

1237
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:13,714
Thank you.

1238
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:16,817
It will be a yes or no.

1239
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,825
I will do what I can do.

1240
01:29:24,827 --> 01:29:27,561
But you must
know that this is

1241
01:29:27,563 --> 01:29:29,363
a long shot.

1242
01:29:29,365 --> 01:29:30,764
I know.

1243
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:32,966
Thank you.

1244
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:46,813
Look, the last time I spoke to
them, they were in Midland, Texas.

1245
01:29:46,815 --> 01:29:49,349
That was about two days ago.

1246
01:29:49,351 --> 01:29:51,718
So, I called up the Sheriff
there and I asked him,

1247
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,454
had they found any dead bodies
along the side of the highway?

1248
01:29:54,456 --> 01:29:58,458
And he said that they did. And I
said, "Thank you," and I hung up.

1249
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:02,496
I know you think I'm kidding.

1250
01:30:02,498 --> 01:30:04,531
But I'm not.

1251
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:06,833
And I'm not out.

1252
01:30:06,835 --> 01:30:10,470
That's right. And I'm not
kidding about that either.

1253
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:13,407
Really?

1254
01:30:13,409 --> 01:30:18,378
No, I know where the truck
is going. I always did.

1255
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,414
Really?

1256
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:23,583
Well, I think that falls under
the category of "tough shit. "

1257
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:25,452
We're all done here.

1258
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:41,835
Here.
Thanks.

1259
01:31:11,432 --> 01:31:14,801
In the last two accounts,
we're only an hour different

1260
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:16,603
but it's another day.

1261
01:31:16,605 --> 01:31:17,704
It's tomorrow.

1262
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:21,508
See, I love that. I love that.

1263
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:25,579
So, what have we got?
625 kilos?

1264
01:31:25,581 --> 01:31:27,581
Yeah, something like that.

1265
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:29,816
Shit. You know,
of all the people

1266
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:32,519
you and I should
know if electronic money

1267
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:34,087
earns an extra
day of interest

1268
01:31:34,089 --> 01:31:36,957
when it crosses
an international date line.

1269
01:31:36,959 --> 01:31:38,925
Right? I'm just saying.

1270
01:31:38,927 --> 01:31:40,861
That's a good question.

1271
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:44,664
Why is there a fourth drum?

1272
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:47,467
No reason.

1273
01:31:47,469 --> 01:31:49,135
It's just convenient.

1274
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:51,605
Convenient?

1275
01:31:51,607 --> 01:31:53,573
Mm-hmm. Yeah,
maybe we have a traveler.

1276
01:31:53,575 --> 01:31:55,675
Like somebody, you
wish for them to go away

1277
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:58,445
so, you send them to America.
That's all.

1278
01:31:58,447 --> 01:31:59,546
Can I have a look?

1279
01:31:59,548 --> 01:32:00,547
You want to look?

1280
01:32:00,549 --> 01:32:02,449
Yeah.
Sick bastard.

1281
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:06,987
Do you know who he is?

1282
01:32:06,989 --> 01:32:09,756
<i>No. Fuck, no.
He's some pinche pasajero.</i>

1283
01:32:12,227 --> 01:32:13,493
A passenger?

1284
01:32:13,495 --> 01:32:15,862
Yeah. An immigrant.

1285
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:17,030
Oh!

1286
01:32:18,767 --> 01:32:21,601
So, it's just a way to
get rid of a body?

1287
01:32:21,603 --> 01:32:22,903
Yeah.

1288
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:27,541
From Mexico?

1289
01:32:27,543 --> 01:32:29,543
No, no, no. Colombia.

1290
01:32:29,545 --> 01:32:31,144
He came all
the way from Colombia?

1291
01:32:31,146 --> 01:32:32,579
Mm-hmm.

1292
01:32:32,581 --> 01:32:33,513
What are you
going to do with him?

1293
01:32:33,515 --> 01:32:35,081
Nothing.

1294
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:36,683
He just goes
back in the truck?

1295
01:32:36,685 --> 01:32:38,251
Yeah. Goes back in the truck.

1296
01:32:38,253 --> 01:32:40,020
Then what?

1297
01:32:40,022 --> 01:32:41,821
Nothing. It's just normal.

1298
01:32:41,823 --> 01:32:43,623
But they think
it's a fucking joke.

1299
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:46,893
They think it's funny, so they
do this shit to me, you know?

1300
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:50,564
But in this business, you gotta
have a sense of humor, or else...

1301
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:56,803
So, what happens to him?

1302
01:32:57,705 --> 01:32:59,539
Nothing. I told you,

1303
01:32:59,541 --> 01:33:01,708
they go back
together in the truck.

1304
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:03,610
He's inside, they paint it,
he rides around.

1305
01:33:03,612 --> 01:33:06,112
They try to sell it at
auction maybe, maybe not.

1306
01:33:06,114 --> 01:33:08,348
He rides around some more,
sucking up the shit.

1307
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:12,652
Hey, welcome to America.

1308
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:19,759
<i>Yes, but I can only tell you
what I already told our friend.</i>

1309
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:22,028
<i>There is no one to talk to.</i>

1310
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:25,098
Could I come to The Florida?

1311
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,033
<i>The Florida is closed.</i>

1312
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:31,638
I would do
whatever you suggest.

1313
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:34,007
<i>I have no suggestions,
Counselor.</i>

1314
01:33:39,747 --> 01:33:41,681
We could meet someplace.

1315
01:33:41,683 --> 01:33:43,650
<i>We're meeting now.</i>

1316
01:33:47,989 --> 01:33:50,590
I'm not sure you
understand my position.

1317
01:33:50,592 --> 01:33:52,726
<i>But I do, Counselor.</i>

1318
01:33:52,728 --> 01:33:56,096
Actions create consequences
which produce new worlds

1319
01:33:56,098 --> 01:33:58,898
and they're all different.

1320
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:02,669
Where the bodies are buried in the
desert, that is a certain world.

1321
01:34:02,671 --> 01:34:06,606
Where the bodies are simply left
to be found, that is another.

1322
01:34:06,608 --> 01:34:09,709
<i>And all these worlds,
heretofore unknown to us,</i>

1323
01:34:09,711 --> 01:34:12,112
<i>they must have always
been there, must they not?</i>

1324
01:34:13,614 --> 01:34:15,215
<i>I don't know.</i>

1325
01:34:17,585 --> 01:34:19,052
Will you help me?

1326
01:34:19,054 --> 01:34:21,187
<i>I would urge you
to see the truth</i>

1327
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:23,323
<i>of the situation
you're in, Counselor.</i>

1328
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:25,725
That is my advice.

1329
01:34:25,727 --> 01:34:30,664
It is not for me to tell you what
you should have done or not done.

1330
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:35,168
<i>The world in which you seek to
undo the mistakes that you made</i>

1331
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:39,005
<i>is different from the world
where the mistakes were made.</i>

1332
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,776
You are now at the crossing.

1333
01:34:42,778 --> 01:34:46,713
And you want to choose, but
there is no choosing there.

1334
01:34:47,214 --> 01:34:49,649
<i>There's only accepting.</i>

1335
01:34:49,651 --> 01:34:53,186
<i>The choosing was
done a long time ago.</i>

1336
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:56,056
Are you there, Counselor?

1337
01:34:56,657 --> 01:34:57,957
<i>Yes.</i>

1338
01:34:57,959 --> 01:34:59,793
I don't mean to offend you

1339
01:34:59,795 --> 01:35:02,896
but reflective men
often find themselves

1340
01:35:02,898 --> 01:35:06,366
at a place removed
from the realities of life.

1341
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:09,969
In any case, we should
all prepare a place

1342
01:35:09,971 --> 01:35:12,072
where we can
accommodate all the tragedies

1343
01:35:12,074 --> 01:35:14,207
that sooner or later
will come to our lives.

1344
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:17,844
But this is an economy
few people care to practice.

1345
01:35:17,846 --> 01:35:20,747
Do you know
the words of Machado?

1346
01:35:20,749 --> 01:35:22,749
<i>I know his name.</i>

1347
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:28,021
Lovely poet.

1348
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:32,692
<i>Machado was a schoolteacher</i>

1349
01:35:32,694 --> 01:35:35,729
<i>and he married a young,
beautiful girl.</i>

1350
01:35:35,731 --> 01:35:37,897
<i>And he loved her very much.</i>

1351
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:40,166
<i>And she died.</i>

1352
01:35:40,168 --> 01:35:43,803
<i>And then he
became a great poet.</i>

1353
01:35:43,805 --> 01:35:46,139
I'm not going to
become a great poet.

1354
01:35:46,141 --> 01:35:49,008
<i>No, perhaps not. But
even if you were to do so,</i>

1355
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:51,444
<i>it would not help you.</i>

1356
01:35:51,446 --> 01:35:54,114
Machado would have
traded every word,

1357
01:35:54,116 --> 01:35:57,383
every poem,
every verse he ever wrote

1358
01:35:57,385 --> 01:36:01,020
for one more hour
with his beloved.

1359
01:36:01,022 --> 01:36:03,757
And that is because
when it comes to grief,

1360
01:36:03,759 --> 01:36:06,126
the normal rules of
exchange do not apply,

1361
01:36:06,128 --> 01:36:08,928
because grief
transcends value.

1362
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:13,800
<i>A man would give entire nations
to lift grief off his heart</i>

1363
01:36:13,802 --> 01:36:17,737
and yet, you cannot
buy anything with grief.

1364
01:36:17,739 --> 01:36:21,374
Because grief is worthless.

1365
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:24,911
Why are you telling me this?

1366
01:36:24,913 --> 01:36:30,817
<i>Because you continue to deny the
reality of the world you're in.</i>

1367
01:36:30,819 --> 01:36:33,887
<i>Do you love your wife so much,
so completely,</i>

1368
01:36:33,889 --> 01:36:38,925
<i>that you would exchange
places with her upon the wheel?</i>

1369
01:36:38,927 --> 01:36:42,128
And I don't mean dying,
because dying is easy.

1370
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:47,400
Yes! Yes, damn you!

1371
01:36:50,504 --> 01:36:53,239
<i>Well, that is good
to hear, Counselor.</i>

1372
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:00,880
What are you saying?

1373
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:04,450
Are you saying
this is a possibility?

1374
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:06,452
No.

1375
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:08,588
It's impossible.

1376
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:12,192
You said I was that man

1377
01:37:12,194 --> 01:37:13,927
at that crossing.

1378
01:37:13,929 --> 01:37:16,796
<i>Yes. At the understanding</i>

1379
01:37:16,798 --> 01:37:21,601
<i>that life is not
going to take you back.</i>

1380
01:37:23,537 --> 01:37:27,874
<i>You are the world you have created,
and when you cease to exist,</i>

1381
01:37:27,876 --> 01:37:32,846
<i>this world that you have
created will also cease to exist.</i>

1382
01:37:32,848 --> 01:37:35,481
But for those with
the understanding that

1383
01:37:35,483 --> 01:37:38,351
they're living
the last days of the world,

1384
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:42,555
death acquires
a different meaning.

1385
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:47,193
The extinction
of all reality

1386
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:52,999
is a concept
no resignation can encompass.

1387
01:37:53,001 --> 01:37:58,371
<i>And then, all the grand
designs and all the grand plans</i>

1388
01:37:58,373 --> 01:38:03,376
will be finally exposed and
revealed for what they are.

1389
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:07,347
<i>And now,
Counselor, I have to go,</i>

1390
01:38:07,349 --> 01:38:10,250
<i>because I have to
make other calls.</i>

1391
01:38:10,252 --> 01:38:13,953
<i>If I have time,
I think I'll take a small nap.</i>

1392
01:38:24,965 --> 01:38:28,568
<i>Welcome to
London Heathrow, Terminal 5.</i>

1393
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:31,571
<i>Please keep your bags with you
at all times.</i>

1394
01:38:31,573 --> 01:38:36,276
<i>Any unattended luggage will be
removed and may be destroyed.</i>

1395
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:53,059
I like the hat.

1396
01:38:53,061 --> 01:38:54,160
Thank you.

1397
01:38:57,031 --> 01:38:58,364
The International.

1398
01:38:58,366 --> 01:38:59,666
Of course.

1399
01:39:12,579 --> 01:39:13,947
Hello, madam.

1400
01:39:13,949 --> 01:39:15,415
Hi.

1401
01:39:15,417 --> 01:39:16,716
Checking in?

1402
01:39:20,554 --> 01:39:22,088
How are you doing?

1403
01:39:22,556 --> 01:39:23,656
Okay.

1404
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:28,094
You're Canadian.

1405
01:39:28,096 --> 01:39:31,130
You saw my passport.
Where are you from?

1406
01:39:31,132 --> 01:39:32,732
New Mexico.

1407
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:35,969
Have a drink with me.

1408
01:39:35,971 --> 01:39:37,370
What?

1409
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:41,140
Have a drink with me.

1410
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:43,409
You're a masher.

1411
01:39:43,411 --> 01:39:46,612
A masher? Lord,
where did you hear that?

1412
01:39:46,614 --> 01:39:48,448
I'm teasing.

1413
01:39:49,283 --> 01:39:50,416
I think.

1414
01:40:10,038 --> 01:40:11,070
Yes.

1415
01:40:18,545 --> 01:40:22,315
<i>Senor,s I must close.</i>

1416
01:40:23,217 --> 01:40:24,450
I know.

1417
01:40:24,452 --> 01:40:26,686
You have no
place to go, maybe?

1418
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:31,157
I fell asleep, I'm sorry.

1419
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:33,559
There is no harm.

1420
01:40:33,561 --> 01:40:35,228
No harm.

1421
01:40:37,965 --> 01:40:40,033
That's a lovely thought.

1422
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:42,802
A magical thought.

1423
01:40:46,407 --> 01:40:47,774
Good night.

1424
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:54,280
It's very dangerous out there.
In the street.

1425
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:57,216
I know.

1426
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:02,522
If they hear somebody in
the street, they shoot them.

1427
01:41:02,524 --> 01:41:07,193
Then they turn on the light
to see who is dead.

1428
01:41:07,195 --> 01:41:08,728
Why do they do that?

1429
01:41:08,730 --> 01:41:10,696
To make a joke.

1430
01:41:10,698 --> 01:41:15,568
To show that death doesn't
care. That death has no meaning.

1431
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:17,036
Do you believe that?

1432
01:41:17,038 --> 01:41:18,504
No.

1433
01:41:18,506 --> 01:41:21,140
Of course not.

1434
01:41:21,142 --> 01:41:23,709
All my family is dead.

1435
01:41:23,711 --> 01:41:25,344
I'm the one who
has no meaning.

1436
01:43:30,337 --> 01:43:32,205
So, you got the password?

1437
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:35,408
Five digits.

1438
01:43:35,410 --> 01:43:36,475
Who's Rowena?

1439
01:43:36,477 --> 01:43:38,211
I don't know.

1440
01:43:38,213 --> 01:43:41,981
All right. Social
security, driver's license.

1441
01:43:42,816 --> 01:43:44,850
Can I ask you something?

1442
01:43:44,852 --> 01:43:46,519
Sure.

1443
01:43:46,521 --> 01:43:49,255
I don't see what good this will
do unless you have the computer.

1444
01:43:53,694 --> 01:43:55,995
You and I are square.

1445
01:43:58,298 --> 01:44:01,300
So, are you
planning to see him again?

1446
01:44:01,302 --> 01:44:04,203
What would be the point?
He'll be broke.

1447
01:44:04,205 --> 01:44:05,771
Smart girl.

1448
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:08,474
Or is it worse than that?

1449
01:44:11,812 --> 01:44:13,679
I don't want to get mixed up
in something heavy.

1450
01:44:13,681 --> 01:44:16,349
You already are.

1451
01:44:16,351 --> 01:44:18,851
How would you know
he won't come looking for you?

1452
01:44:18,853 --> 01:44:19,986
But he won't, will he?

1453
01:44:22,556 --> 01:44:23,990
No.

1454
01:44:24,424 --> 01:44:26,292
He won't.

1455
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:30,763
Jesus.

1456
01:44:38,338 --> 01:44:39,305
Take the money.

1457
01:44:39,307 --> 01:44:40,873
I don't want it.

1458
01:44:41,508 --> 01:44:42,642
Please yourself.

1459
01:44:42,644 --> 01:44:44,210
I have to go.

1460
01:44:44,212 --> 01:44:45,711
You know what I like
about Americans?

1461
01:44:45,713 --> 01:44:46,946
No, what?

1462
01:44:47,681 --> 01:44:49,749
You can depend on them.

1463
01:44:59,326 --> 01:45:00,559
Thank you, Ray.

1464
01:45:00,561 --> 01:45:01,861
Okay. Take care.

1465
01:46:19,673 --> 01:46:23,109
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1466
01:46:24,644 --> 01:46:25,945
Fuck you!

1467
01:46:25,947 --> 01:46:27,046
Drive.

1468
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:31,143
There you go.

1469
01:47:34,448 --> 01:47:35,581
Drive.

1470
01:47:51,665 --> 01:47:53,499
<i>Momento!</i>

1471
01:48:04,578 --> 01:48:06,178
Hey.

1472
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:02,968
God!

1473
01:49:06,573 --> 01:49:08,140
Oh, God!

1474
01:49:22,622 --> 01:49:24,623
No!

1475
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,180
Good evening.

1476
01:49:48,182 --> 01:49:50,015
Lovely to see you, madame.
Thank you.

1477
01:49:50,017 --> 01:49:51,951
Good evening, sir.
Follow me.

1478
01:50:20,614 --> 01:50:21,914
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

1479
01:50:27,587 --> 01:50:28,854
It's good to see you.

1480
01:50:28,856 --> 01:50:30,189
You, as well.

1481
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:32,291
How's Marisa?

1482
01:50:33,994 --> 01:50:35,628
She's fine.

1483
01:50:36,329 --> 01:50:38,163
You should come and see us.

1484
01:50:38,165 --> 01:50:39,398
I know.

1485
01:50:42,936 --> 01:50:44,737
We should talk.

1486
01:50:44,739 --> 01:50:46,739
Yes. Of course.

1487
01:50:46,741 --> 01:50:48,907
We need to move the
money as soon as possible,

1488
01:50:48,909 --> 01:50:51,276
speaking as your banker.

1489
01:50:51,278 --> 01:50:52,978
Are you
returning to the States?

1490
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:56,849
No, and I certainly
can't go to Mexico.

1491
01:50:56,851 --> 01:50:59,284
I'm thinking Hong Kong.
Really?

1492
01:50:59,286 --> 01:51:00,686
You don't speak the language.

1493
01:51:00,688 --> 01:51:02,254
I'm a quick study.

1494
01:51:02,256 --> 01:51:04,056
Well, I suppose you could
simply buy into the market there.

1495
01:51:04,058 --> 01:51:06,125
Yes, it's not a problem.
Cash?

1496
01:51:06,127 --> 01:51:08,827
The easiest way to move cash
is in diamonds.

1497
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:11,263
You can hold $20 million
in the palm of your hand.

1498
01:51:11,265 --> 01:51:14,233
Well, I suppose there's no
problem selling diamonds in China.

1499
01:51:15,168 --> 01:51:17,770
You can sell diamonds on Mars.

1500
01:51:19,372 --> 01:51:20,773
You need to get out, Michael.

1501
01:51:23,743 --> 01:51:26,712
If anything went wrong,
your name might come up.

1502
01:51:26,714 --> 01:51:28,280
That's right.

1503
01:51:28,282 --> 01:51:30,382
You're not really leaving
me a choice, are you?

1504
01:51:31,184 --> 01:51:32,685
You'll thank me.

1505
01:51:37,724 --> 01:51:39,191
And the cats?

1506
01:51:39,193 --> 01:51:43,796
Silvia died, and Raoul is
alive and well in Arizona.

1507
01:51:44,831 --> 01:51:46,365
I'll miss him.

1508
01:51:47,834 --> 01:51:49,835
I miss watching him
out on the high desert

1509
01:51:49,837 --> 01:51:52,371
bringing down jackrabbits
at 70 miles an hour.

1510
01:51:53,707 --> 01:51:56,175
I never tired of that.

1511
01:51:56,177 --> 01:51:59,378
To see quarry,
killed with elegance

1512
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:03,315
it's just moving to me.

1513
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:06,385
Is it sexual?

1514
01:52:06,387 --> 01:52:10,923
Yes, of course. A thing
like that is always sexual.

1515
01:52:12,058 --> 01:52:17,730
The hunter has grace,
beauty,

1516
01:52:17,732 --> 01:52:21,700
and purity of heart
to be found nowhere else.

1517
01:52:21,702 --> 01:52:26,271
You can make no distinction between
what they are and what they do.

1518
01:52:26,273 --> 01:52:28,507
And what they do is kill.

1519
01:52:30,043 --> 01:52:33,278
We, of course,
are another matter.

1520
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,282
It is our faintness of heart that
has driven us to the edge of ruin.

1521
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:42,254
Perhaps you won't agree

1522
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:44,523
but nothing is
crueler than a coward.

1523
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:47,726
And the slaughter to come

1524
01:52:47,728 --> 01:52:50,896
is probably beyond
our imagining.

1525
01:52:50,898 --> 01:52:54,233
I think you've told me
more than I wish to know.

1526
01:52:55,368 --> 01:52:57,302
Then I'll say no more.

1527
01:52:59,038 --> 01:53:01,774
Shall we think about ordering?

1528
01:53:02,642 --> 01:53:04,309
I'm famished.
