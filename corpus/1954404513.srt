1
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,390
Alright dude, time to get up.

2
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,280
Come on, Rigby.

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,210
Dude, get up. We got to get ready for work.

4
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,590
Okay. Okay.

5
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,710
Dude, this is so cool.

6
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,050
I never got a job that got you a place to live.

7
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,570
I never even had a job.

8
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,110
Yeah, about that.

9
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,210
I kinda told them you'd be a good idea to hire,

10
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,710
so can you try not to do the whole "Rigby thing".

11
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,650
"Rigby thing"? What do you mean?

12
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,790
I mean you're lazy.

13
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,630
What? I'm not lazy.

14
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,360
Dude, you were lazy to fill up the application for this job.

15
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,170
That's why I have to do it in the first place.

16
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,220
Just cause I was too lazy to do something boring

17
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,380
like filling in a job application doesn't mean I'm lazy.

18
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,040
Okay. Okay. Look.

19
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,560
Let's just both promise that starting right now

20
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,090
we're not gonna do anything to screw this up. Okay?

21
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,860
Okay. You think there's breakfast stuff in the kitchen?

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,300
Only one way to find out.

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,860
...Milk.

24
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,730
...Cereal.

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,050
...Combine.

26
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,040
This is the only clean spoon left dude.

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,560
Let's play "Punchies" for it.

28
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,630
Okay. Me first.

29
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,880
Take it.

30
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,790
Man,

31
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,080
so far this job is awesome!

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,190
I still can't believe we get our own rooms!

33
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,640
Dude, those rooms aren't cool. There's nothing in them.

34
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,400
I had to sleep on the floor last night.

35
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,950
Will yeah I mean.

36
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,420
We could get some stuff for by earning some money. You know?

37
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,660
I guess.

38
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,390
You want some milk.

39
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,790
Yeah.

40
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,590
Please don't eat up in the table like that.

41
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,940
Like what?

42
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,370
Oh my. I never seen anyone eating cereal like that.

43
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,910
How quaint!

44
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,700
Yeah, well they shouldn't be doing that.

45
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,040
That's what the bowls are for.

46
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,300
Oh, they're fine!

47
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,940
- ...Did you see that chair? - I love chairs...

48
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,360
Hey, Pops! What are you doing with that chair?

49
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,620
Oh, well. I no longer require its services.

50
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,200
So, Benson & I are taking it to the place

51
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,020
where the big man-made come upon & wisk it away to magic trash city!

52
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,770
We're throwing it away.

53
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,610
Aw, what?

54
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,340
Yeah, why would you throw that thing out? It looks awesome.

55
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,160
Can we at least check it out, before you chuck it?

56
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,730
Yeah, can we at least check it, before you chuck.

57
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,500
Oh, that would be fine.

58
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,770
Look, I gotta get back to work.

59
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,420
You guys help him throw it away when you're done.

60
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,430
Aw, man this chair is awesome.

61
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,430
Look how awesome it looks.

62
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,840
Dude, it sounds like old man pants.

63
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,170
I'm gonna sit in it.

64
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,030
Good idea.

65
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,470
What? What's wrong?

66
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,770
Dude, this is the most uncomfortable chair I ever sat in.

67
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,300
Aw, what? Let me try it.

68
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,500
Yes, I'm afraid it's true.

69
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,970
I purchased it through the post and it just isn't as comfortable as it looks.

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,760
This is terrible.

71
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,960
Maybe we're just not sitting it right.

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,290
Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on, come on, baby!

73
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,680
It's just not comfortable, man.

74
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,940
If you ask me, I think we should throw it away.

75
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,830
Oh, well, yes, that's what I'm on my way to do.

76
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,140
Hey, Pops. Since you're throwing it out anyway, can I just have it?

77
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,110
- No, let me have it! - I asked him first.

78
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,720
- Come on, Pops! - No, Pops, me!

79
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,860
Well, I don't think I know who to give it to.

80
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,960
But if you two can settle it between yourselves,

81
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,410
then you're more than welcome to have it.

82
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,480
Yeah, let's play punches.

83
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,650
No way! I'm not playing that game with you anymore.

84
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,470
If we're playing for something like that chair,

85
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,380
then we need to play a game that takes a little more skill.

86
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,910
How much skill?

87
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,880
Rock paper scissors.

88
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,300
I adore rock paper scissors.

89
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,020
Although where I come from, we called it quartz parchment shears.

90
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,090
Alright, how do you wanna play it.

91
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,520
Are we go in a one-two-three go?

92
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,520
Or one-two-three, shoot on three?

93
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,570
Let's do it on three.

94
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,810
Alright, fine. But let's stretch first.

95
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,630
I don't wanna put my ham or whatever.

96
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,310
Okay.

97
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,270
What's up with the new guys?

98
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,100
They're ready to play quartz parchment shears for my old Silounna.

99
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,450
Nice.

100
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,880
You know who else gonna play quartz parchment shears for your old Silounna?

101
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,830
Who?

102
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,830
My mom!

103
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,010
See? I told you I was gonna say it!

104
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,360
Ready?

105
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,230
Oh, my!

106
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,530
Shouldn't you guys be throwing that thing away?

107
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,160
Benson, come quick!

108
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,660
Quartz parchment shears and they already tied two times, it's absolutely fascinating!

109
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,190
I have work to do.

110
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,580
And they shouldn't be playing that. It's an evil game.

111
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,200
Whoo, an evil game.

112
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,220
Two ties.

113
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,390
You don't know what I'm throwing next, baby!

114
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,890
I already know what you're throwing before you even throw it, baby!

115
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,890
That's not even possible, baby!

116
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,510
Come on!

117
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,630
Good show, jolly good show!

118
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,440
Everyone come quick!

119
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,130
The most amazing game of quartz parchment shears is happening right now!

120
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,460
No, no!

121
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,490
99 ties in a row!

122
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,020
Enough!

123
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,760
Why are we even doing this?

124
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,520
You don't even think this chair comfortable.

125
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,990
So? neither do you!

126
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,750
Dude, I was lying.

127
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,290
I was just saying that, so you wouldn't want it.

128
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,080
I was lying also, I love that chair.

129
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,070
Well, then I guess it's too bad that after I win it.

130
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,520
I'm never letting you sit it.

131
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,530
Then finish it!

132
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,270
Since no one can decide,

133
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,000
and all these playies tied 100 times,

134
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,570
I take it upon myself to eat your prize.

135
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,450
What's that?

136
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,780
Come on, let's go!

137
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,480
This is all your fault!

138
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,360
How is this my fault? I just wanna play punches.

139
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,650
The chair!

140
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,340
The Rigby!

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,150
Oh, dear!

142
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,710
Hello? Hello?

143
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,930
Please someone come quick!

144
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,900
Quartz parchment shears' gone terribly wrong...

145
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,640
Pops, where are you?

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,460
Skips, take the shortcut, I'll go around back.

147
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,650
Idiots.

148
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,490
Skips!

149
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,440
What did you do?

150
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,400
They're playing rock peper scissors. Grab on!

151
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,710
Don't you know that's an evil game?

152
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,970
Hold on, everybody.

153
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,350
Hold on, everybody!

154
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,800
Hold on, every... Rigby!

155
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,420
What do we do?

156
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,100
You have to break the tie!

157
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,740
Rigby! We have to in this. I'm gonna throw rock!

158
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,660
- Yeah, right. - I'm not kidding!

159
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,510
Hurry up! Do it now!

160
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,550
Did you win?

161
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,760
I think you win.

162
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,330
It doesn't matter. I wasn't able to hold on that chair anyways.

163
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,510
Look!

164
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,510
Oh, cool!

165
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,520
No, you don't.

166
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,310
You're not getting that chair.

167
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,990
But here's what you do get.

168
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,410
You get to flip that cart back over.

169
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,300
You're throwing that chair away, and then you're cleaning up this whole mess!

170
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,580
Pops, you're coming with me, and you two idiots,

171
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,940
if this isn't cleaned up when I get back, You're fired!

172
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,780
- Geez, I can't believe it... - But... Benson, I...

173
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,320
Okay.

174
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,210
Starting now, let's both promise not to do anything to screw this up.

175
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,820
- Agreed? - Agreed.

176
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,060
Rock paper scissors for who gets to drive the cart?
