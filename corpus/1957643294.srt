00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,916
- [Narrator] There once lived
 a gentleman from a fine family

39
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,320
whose hard work made
 him very, very rich.

40
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,791
His life was filled with beauty.

41
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,697
Not only was he blessed with
 a loyal and loving wife,

42
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,833
but a most attractive daughter.

43
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,269
(calm music)

44
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:26,613
Sweet, kind, she was as
 lovely inside as she was out.

45
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,450
Life, however, is not
 always predictable

46
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,453
and darkness passed
across the man's future

47
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,955
and his wife took gravely ill.

48
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,630
A few weeks later,
  she passed on.

49
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,871
Winter came and
 covered everything in
 a blanket of white.

50
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,616
(plops)

51
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,873
And when the sun
 brought springtime,

52
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,043
the rich man had
 found a second wife,

53
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,512
who brought along
  her two daughters.

54
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,848
Like their mother, they had
 nasty and wicked hearts.

55
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:40,019
This did not bode well for
  the rich man's daughter.

56
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:46,459
Sometime later, the rich man
 left on a long business trip.

57
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,127
- But you just came back.

58
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,863
- It can't be helped, I'm sorry.

59
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,533
Now what might I
 bring back for you?

60
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,801
- Well, I--

61
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,804
- A beautiful dress,
 my wonderful husband.

62
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,272
- And candy.

63
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:03,209
Lots of cherries covered
 with thick, creamy chocolate.

64
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,479
- And pearls!

65
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,214
A long magnificent strand

66
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,851
to adorn my long and
 magnificent neck.

67
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,753
- And you, my daughter?

68
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,422
- I need nothing, Father.

69
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,792
I wish only that
  you return safely.

70
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,461
- I shall.

71
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,196
Until then, farewell!

72
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,737
- I miss you already, Father.

73
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,138
- What did you say?

74
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,373
- Nothing.

75
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,643
- Then stop wasting time
and go do your chores!

76
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,912
(stepsisters laughing)

77
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,916
- [Narrator] Blinded by
  his love for his new wife,

78
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,020
the father didn't see what
 was happening to his daughter.

79
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,190
The cruel stepsisters
 immediately took
 away her bedroom,

80
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:56,696
her fine clothes, and
  made her do all the chores

81
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:00,366
around the house while
 they had all the fun.

82
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,370
(laughing)

83
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,178
The father had no idea she
 was sleeping on a straw mat

84
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,347
in front of the fireplace.

85
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,286
And although the
 fire kept her warm,

86
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,323
the ashes and cinders
 drifted across her,

87
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,692
making her look dusty and dirty.

88
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:30,496
The stepsisters made fun of
 her and called her Cinderella.

89
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,598
(crying)

90
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,213
(lively music)

91
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,954
(sloshes)

92
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,975
- I miss you, Mother.

93
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,116
(mysterious music)

94
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,888
- Why, Cindy,
 you've been crying.

95
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,223
- You're alive?

96
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,025
- Would I be talking
 if I wasn't alive?

97
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,427
- No, but...

98
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,428
Who are you?

99
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,698
- I'm your fairy
 godmother, of course.

100
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,166
- I didn't know I...

101
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,100
- Nonsense.

102
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,102
Everybody has a fairy godmother.

103
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,037
Well, almost everybody.

104
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,775
- You can fly!

105
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,711
- Oh, I can do all
  sorts of things!

106
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:55,782
Watch.

107
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,052
(clatters)

108
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,654
- But I just hung those up!

109
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,722
- No problem.

110
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,429
(laughs)

111
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:13,032
- Oh, I wish you were
 here all the time.

112
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,534
- I am, my sweet.

113
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,703
And I know everything
 that's going on.

114
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,773
- Then you know about my
 stepmother and stepsisters?

115
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,576
- Their deeds will
  not go unpunished.

116
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,444
You have my word.

117
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,780
Now, no more tears, promise?

118
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,583
- I promise.

119
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,551
- Good.

120
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,719
Pleasant dreams, my child.

121
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,321
And fear no longer.

122
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,367
- Good night to you,
 fairy godmother.

123
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,469
(kisses)

124
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:26,506
- Oh, too bad Cinderella
can't play with us.

125
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,609
- Somebody has to
  do all the chores.

126
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,878
(laughing)

127
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,951
- Cinderella!

128
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:39,785
(gasps)

129
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,021
(shatters)

130
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,661
Now look what you've done.

131
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,329
- You frightened me.

132
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,701
- When you finish
 cleaning up your mess,

133
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,037
the floors need to be
scrubbed, the curtains cleaned,

134
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,239
and the silver polished.

135
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,408
- But I just
 polished the silver.

136
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,110
- Well, do it again!

137
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,213
I want to see my
 face in every spoon.

138
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,555
What?

139
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,989
What's happening?

140
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,962
What is going on here?

141
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,036
(laughs)

142
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,712
- You cheated.

143
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:40,546
- I did not.

144
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,380
- Did too.

145
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,214
- Did not.

146
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,049
- Did too.

147
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:43,883
- Did not.

148
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:44,817
- You did!

149
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,285
Besides, it's my turn anyway!

150
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,887
- No, it's my turn.

151
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:48,721
- Move!

152
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,361
(tinkling music)

153
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,731
(bounces)

154
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,983
(crashes)

155
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,386
(laughs)

156
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:42,608
- [Narrator] Meanwhile, the
king's son had just come of age.

157
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,112
And the king and queen were
anxious for the handsome prince

158
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:50,016
to choose a wife from the
 rank and nobility in the land.

159
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,685
- Do you think he likes her?

160
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:56,122
- Well, if I could
 see, I could tell you.

161
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,225
(crashes)

162
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,732
- My father is the
  Duke of Rockingham

163
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,735
and he is very, very wealthy.

164
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,370
(sighs)

165
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,572
My grandfather was
  even wealthier.

166
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,675
- Wealth isn't important to me.

167
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,210
- Our collection of fine
 art is the most exceptional

168
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,645
in the land.

169
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,313
Save yours, of course.

170
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:22,982
Huh?

171
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,217
- Quick, dear, he's coming.

172
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,359
- Well?

173
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,927
- Isn't she lovely?

174
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:42,001
- I will not marry
 someone I don't love.

175
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,270
- But--

176
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,205
- I have an idea.

177
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,907
We will hold a grand ball

178
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,677
and invite all the eligible
 young ladies we can find.

179
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,580
- Yes, a magnificent
 ball, a feast!

180
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,951
Surely you'll be able to
find your princess then?

181
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,854
- I will agree
 under one condition.

182
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,522
- Speak, my son.

183
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,525
- The choice is
 mine and mine alone.

184
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,828
- Agreed.

185
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,230
The invitation shall
 go out immediately!

186
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,833
(upbeat music)

187
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,721
(knocking)

188
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,958
(stepsisters laughing)

189
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,195
- I got it, I got it!

190
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,070
It's mine!

191
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,341
(grunts)

192
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,212
(laughs)

193
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,382
- It's here!

194
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,218
The invitation is here!

195
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:11,123
The king and queen request
 the pleasure of your company

196
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:15,060
at the grand ball to be
held at the royal palace

197
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,495
three days hence.

198
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,633
- Oh, mother, that's wonderful!

199
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,902
But I need a new dress.

200
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,805
- Me too, me too, me too!

201
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,174
- Not to worry, my children.

202
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,176
You shall have
  whatever you need.

203
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,244
(laughing)

204
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,446
- May I go to the ball?

205
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,982
- That's hardly
 possible, Cinderella.

206
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,852
You certainly don't expect
 me to buy three new dresses,

207
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,287
do you?

208
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,622
- Well, I just
 thought it would be...

209
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,058
- Besides, you can't even dance.

210
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,092
Come, girls.

211
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,928
There's so much to do!

212
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,739
- I will not cry.

213
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,808
I will not cry.

214
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,043
I will not cry.

215
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,213
- [Stepmother] Cinderella!

216
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,194

217

00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,067

 Cinderella tried her utmost

219
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,903

Won't you please reconsider?

247
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,221
- Well, she did
 help us get dressed.

248
00:15:58,924 --> 00:15:59,758
- Alright.

249
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,029
I've just emptied a bowl
  of lentils into the ashes.

250
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,865
Pick them out of the fireplace
 before our coach arrives

251
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,133
and you can go.

252
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,369
- Oh, thank you, thank you!

253
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,790
How will I ever do this in time?

254
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,425
- [Fairy Godmother]
 Not to worry, Cindy.

255
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,260
We'll take care of it.

256
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,072
(swishes)

257
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,746
(chirping)

258
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,180
- Oh my goodness!

259
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,290
(drops)

260
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:21,306
- I don't suppose you've
finished, have you?

261
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,845
- I did what you asked.

262
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,013
- So you have.

263
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,419
(ominous music)

264
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,088

265
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,756
Except for that one.

266
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,461
- But the rest are in the bowl.

267
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,963
- I said all, not all but one.

268
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,935
- Our coach is here.

269
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,841
- I will not cry.

270
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,843
I will not cry.

271
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,111
I will not cry.

272
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,725
(crying)

273
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:26,972
- Come on, Cindy.

274
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,741
Stop it before
  you drown us both.

275
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,545
- I know I promised
 not to cry, but...

276
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,880
- Oh, it's alright.

277
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,315
I understand.

278
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,952
Why, even fairy godmothers
  cry once in a while.

279
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,253
Follow me.

280
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,388
- Where are we going?

281
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,825
- You, my darling Cindy,
are going to the ball.

282
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,960
- To the ball?

283
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,528
But how?

284
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,897
- Now get me a pumpkin.

285
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:52,898
- A pumpkin?

286
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,501
- Yes.

287
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,202
Yes, you know, a
 round orange thing.

288
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,036
A pumpkin.

289
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,985
- But how will a pumpkin
get me to the ball?

290
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,720
- Enough with all the questions.

291
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,188
Leave it to me.

292
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,291
In the meantime, get me
 four mushrooms, six lizards,

293
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,125
and a rat.

294
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:21,860
- A what?

295
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,097
How strange this all is.

296
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,232
- You haven't seen anything yet.

297
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,133
Now go, go!

298
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,707
The fun's just beginning.

299
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,079
Birds of a feather,
 come back together.

300
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,091
Scoop it clean, my
 crested companions.

301
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,170
- I couldn't find any lizards.

302
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,738
- Well, look in
  the watering can.

303
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:07,573
Now hurry!

304
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,918
- I found the lizards!

305
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,493
- Well done, Cindy.

306
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,995
Now place it here.

307
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,736
- What do you want to
 do with these things?

308
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,870
- Don't worry.

309
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,706
Now stand back, my darling.

310
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,608
The fun has just begun!

311
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,480
(swishes)

312
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,809
- (gasps) Oh, I
  can't believe it!

313
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,846
But how can I go to
 such an elegant affair

314
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,681
in these wretched rags?

315
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,915
- Not to worry.

316
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,193
- It's beautiful!

317
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,033
But...

318
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,868
- Yes, I know, I know.

319
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:48,940
- Glass slippers?

320
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,941
How unusual.

321
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,113
- Not a bad touch, if
 I do say so myself.

322
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,948
Come, it's time to go.

323
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,024
One last thing.

324
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,861
You must not remain at
  the ball beyond midnight.

325
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,296
- Why not?

326
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,566
- If you stay a moment longer,
 the charm will be broken

327
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,903
and everything will change
  back to its old self.

328
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,906
- Before midnight, I promise.

329
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,075
(banging)

330
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,377
- What is it?

331
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:32,017
Well, (laughs) nobody's perfect.

332
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,262
(swishes)

333
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,371
Be gone, my Cindy.

334
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,640
And have the time of your life!

335
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,709
Remember what I told you!

336
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,650
Be home before the
  clock strikes 12.

337
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,487
- I will, fairy
  godmother, I will!

338
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,868
(lively music)

339
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,770
- I must say, dear, you've
  really outdone yourself.

340
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,106
Everyone who is anyone is here.

341
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,707
- If this doesn't
 get our son a wife,

342
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,676
I don't know what will.

343
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:08,847
We have the finest orchestra
 all the way from Vienna,

344
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,722
the most important
  chef from Paris,

345
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:29,701
and the most beautiful
  young ladies in the land.

346
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,172
- Alright, girls, get
 in there and get him.

347
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,640
You can do it, now go!

348
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,809
(crashes)

349
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,884
- Would you honor me with
  a dance, your highness?

350
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:49,120
I understand you
 have feet like wings.

351
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,289
- I beg your pardon?

352
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,791
- Dance with me!

353
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,093
I'm so much more graceful.

354
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,428
- You are not.

355
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,996
You dance like a stork.

356
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,830
- That's a lie!

357
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,664
- It is not.

358
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,599
- Is too.

359
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,399
- [Short Stepsister] Oh yeah?

360
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,334
Well, you're a dunce.

361
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,268
- [Tall Stepsister] Am not.

362
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,202
- [Short Stepsister] Are too.

363
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,136
- [Tall Stepsister] Am not.

364
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,005
- [Short Stepsister] Are too!

365
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,813
- What do you suppose happened?

366
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:54,119
- I've never seen anyone as--

367
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,354
Your face is like...

368
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,324
You're the most beautiful
  young lady I've ever seen.

369
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,558
- I'm flattered.

370
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,359
Thank you.

371
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,432
- May I escort you inside?

372
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:09,367
- It would be my honor.

373
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,237
(gasps)

374
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,689
- [Announcer] Ladies
 and gentlemen,
 announcing the prince!

375
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,523
(applause)

376
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,624
- The prince?

377
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,065
- What a charming creature.

378
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,567
- Charming indeed.

379
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,807
- What grace.

380
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,142
- What elegance.

381
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,911
- What nerve.

382
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,747
And who is she anyway?

383
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,055
(upbeat music)

384
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:07,619
- That's the gaudiest
 dress I've ever seen!

385
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,020
- And those shoes.

386
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,489
Who ever heard of
  glass slippers?

387
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,026
- He'll soon tire
 of her, you'll see.

388
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,762
- [Narrator] But the prince
 did not tire of Cinderella.

389
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:21,933
He danced only with her for
 the rest of the evening.

390
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:46,257
So entranced was
  Cinderella with the prince

391
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:50,428
that she forgot all about her
 fairy godmother's warning.

392
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,569
(clock chiming)

393
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,572
- (gasps) Oh no!

394
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,175
Forgive me, your
highness, but I must go.

395
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,643
- Wait!

396
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,312
I don't even know your name!

397
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:11,316
- Please, please let me
go before it's too late!

398
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,065
(gasps)

399
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,204
No!

400
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,619
(breathing heavily)

401
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,290
- Did you see a lady
 come running out?

402
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,958
- She ran into the
 maze, your highness.

403
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,862
But she looked more like
a peasant than a lady.

404
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,207
- [Prince] Hello?

405
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,143
- Oh no, no!

406
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:16,681
- Hello?

407
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:17,515
Come back!

408
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,461
(rips)

409
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,505
- [Narrator] Afraid
 to get caught,

410
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,307
Cinderella left her
 glass slipper behind

411
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,309
and fled into the night.

412
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,120
(tinkling music)

413
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:03,061
- How could I have
  lost you so soon?

414
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,541
- I know he must love
 me, but I do love him.

415
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,977

(sighs)

00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,378
(slow music)

450
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,415
(crowd chattering)

451
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,597
- Hear ye, hear ye.

452
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,265
Let it hereby be known

453
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,735
that the royal prince
 requests all single ladies,

454
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:40,705
regardless of rank or stature,

455
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:43,674
to try on this
 unique glass slipper.

456
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,777
Furthermore, whomever
 this slipper shall fit

457
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,881
will become the
 bride of the prince

458
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,151
and be the princess of the land.

459
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,087
(crowd chattering)

460
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,926
- [Narrator] The prince
traveled over hills and valleys

461
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,162
in search of his true love.

462
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,899
(springing)

463
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,814
(squeaking)

464
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:27,652
But alas, no one was
  found to fit the slipper.

465
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,223
The prince was growing
 weary of his fruitless quest

466
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:36,394
as he turned up the road
  to where Cinderella lived.

467
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,770
(horse neighs)

468
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,138
- (gasps) He's here!

469
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,773
The prince is coming.

470
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:52,944
- Cinderella, close that door
 and come here this instant.

471
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,915
- My feet are freezing!

472
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,152
- And mine are boiling.

473
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,020
- Oh, stop complaining.

474
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,424
The idea is to get them
to fit into the slipper.

475
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,493
- But my foot will never
shrink enough to fit.

476
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:13,497
- And I don't think that
mine'll get any bigger.

477
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,167
- They better.

478
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,401
Cinderella!

479
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,470
Dispose of these buckets.

480
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,775
- May I try on the slipper too?

481
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,579
(laughs)

482
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,951
- Absolutely not.

483
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,387
You're much too
  dirty to be seen.

484
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,589
As soon as you dispose
 of these buckets,

485
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:43,361
go upstairs to the attic and
 wait until I call you down.

486
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,195
- But I...

487
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,564
- Do as I say.

488
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:47,398
Now!

489
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,904
(knocking)

490
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,811
Good afternoon, your highness.

491
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,980
We've been expecting you.

492
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,383
Won't you please come inside?

493
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,526
(laughs)

494
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,031
- If only I could
 try on that slipper,

495
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,400
the prince would know
 I'm the one he loves.

496
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,869
Isn't there anything you can do?

497
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,371
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

498
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,740
- Oh, please, hurry!

499
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,776
The prince won't
be here forever.

500
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,245
- One thing you
 must learn, my dear.

501
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:37,214
Never rush a fairy godmother!

502
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,450
(grunting)

503
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,920
- Push harder, dear.

504
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,089
- I'm trying!

505
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,864
- Stop, before the
  slipper shatters!

506
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,767
Then I shall never
  find my beloved.

507
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:00,938
(grunts)

508
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,682
- Sorry, Mother.

509
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:13,951
- Next?

510
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,623
- Oh, I just adore glass!

511
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,863
- Oh, no, no, I'm afraid
 your foot is much too small.

512
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,032
- Perhaps if she tried again.

513
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,234
- Don't you have
 any other daughters?

514
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,068
- No, I...

515
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,538
- I was told you
 had three daughters.

516
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,475
- (laughs) Well, actually I do.

517
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,111
But Cinderella's
 only my stepdaughter

518
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,645
and surely she
 couldn't be the one.

519

(distant singing)

520
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:43,781

00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,748
A mere coincidence.

546
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:27,017
It can't be Cinderella.

547
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,186
- It is possible, my lord.

548
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,660
(dramatic music)

549
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,700
(thumps)

550
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,879
Hmm, what's this?

551
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,048
- The other slipper.

552
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:01,151
I lost only one the
 night of the ball.

553
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,988
- We shall see.

554
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,259
- You are the one!

555
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,094
You shall be my bride.

556
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:17,902
- Oh.

557
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,237
(sniffling)

558
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,580
- No, sire, she
  cannot be the one.

559
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,217
Why, look at those ragged
  clothes, that dirty face!

560
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,353
- I did not fall in
love with a fancy dress.

561
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:40,257
Nor can a few simple
  ashes conceal her beauty.

562
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:42,259
It is Cinderella I love.

563
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,129
- And I you, my prince.

564
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:52,870
- [Narrator] A few days later,

565
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,272
the prince and
Cinderella were married.

566
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,942
It was a grand and
  glorious ceremony,

567
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:00,678
and Cinderella looked
  more beautiful than ever,

568
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,046
while the prince was happier

569
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,782
than he ever
 dreamed he would be.

570
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,888
Cinderella's father had
returned from his trip

571
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,423
to give away the bride,

572
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,259
but she never told him
  how much she had suffered.

573
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,094
And when her
 stepsisters apologized

574
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,463
for their thoughtlessness,
  Cinderella,

575
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,565
with a goodness
 that knew no bounds,

576
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:25,069
saw to it that they
 married two handsome lords.

577
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,972
Cinderella and the prince
 lived in comfort and happiness

578
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,640
for the rest of their lives.

579
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,276
And while Cinderella grew
  to be a beautiful woman,

580
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,079
it was her good grace
  that was far more precious

581
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,580
than her beauty,

582
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,017
and her forgiveness that
  was a jewel beyond price.

583
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,419
As all who hear this story know,

584
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:46,390
only true kindness is worthy
 of a fairy godmother's gift.

585
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,126
For without kindness,
 we can do nothing.

586
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:53,197

  everything is possible.
