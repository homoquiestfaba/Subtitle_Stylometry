1
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:09,449
Yo, yo...

2
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:13,359
You guys are freaking out a little too much here...

3
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:19,184
We're Yakuza..  We ain't letting you get away!

4
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:23,602
Someone..Someone save us!!

5
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:25,094
That's enough!

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,296
Who are you?

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,411
I'm...

8
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:37,012
St. Agnes Academy Class 3-A Leader..

9
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:39,731
Sakaki Makio.

10
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:40,678
St. Agnes?

11
00:00:40,678 --> 00:00:42,793
Leader of Class 3-A?

12
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:49,903
You rotten guys think you can beat me?!

13
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:07,751
Makky!

14
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,914
Sakaki-kun!

15
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:16,366
Umemura-san!

16
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:22,389
Thank you.


17
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:24,244
Hero...

18
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:30,881
The End.

19
00:01:31,544 --> 00:01:32,955
Main Character: Me.

20
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:34,494
Heroine:  Umemura-san.

21
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,056
The Friend: Sakura-something.

22
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:37,582
The Homeroom Teacher:  Iron-Face.

23
00:01:37,582 --> 00:01:39,200
Leader of the Bad Guys: Kazu.

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,755
Everyone from Class 3-A..

25
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:41,721
Everyone from the Kantou Sharp Fang.

26
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:42,291
Idea by: Me.
- Master..

27
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:42,926
Written by: Me.
- Master..

28
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:43,725
Directed by: Me.
- Master..

29
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:45,293
What?

30
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:48,606
I'm very sorry about interrupting your dream, but..

31
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:50,184
It's almost time for studies.

32
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:51,090

33
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,591
There's a protractor on your face.

34
00:01:53,877 --> 00:01:57,174
It was a great dream.


35
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:59,472
We'll be continuing elementary mathematics today.

36
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:01,082
I got it.

37
00:02:01,082 --> 00:02:02,446
I'm turning this in also.

38
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:04,857
Oh, your journal with Yuriko-sensei.

39
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:09,386
Writing a journal for 3 months is a pain, but..

40
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:11,568
But I'm kinda sad it finishes today.

41
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:13,693
- Aniki, news.
- What?

42
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:17,765
Starting tomorrow, the winter outfit is back.

43
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:19,603
Oh the winter uniform.

44
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:22,018
- It's already that season?
- Yes.

45
00:02:23,187 --> 00:02:28,239
Yo, I'm the Kantou Sharp Fang's Young Master, Sakaki Makio.

46
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,992
27 years old.  Scorpio.

47
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:34,310
And yet in the morning, I become...

48
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,506
St. Agnes Academy 3-A class leader..

49
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:40,098
Sakaki-Makio, and become 17 years old.

50
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:42,728
How is it?
Do I look like a high school student?

51
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:45,403
Yes, you look like a model student.

52
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:47,181
The white socks define it.

53
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:49,334
The white socks define it!

54
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:53,699
I thought school and studying was a bunch of crap...

55
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,551
Now I'm being optimistic.

56
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,244
- Mikio?
- Yes?

57
00:02:58,244 --> 00:02:59,606
How is university?

58
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:01,886
I'm finally getting used to it.


59
00:03:01,886 --> 00:03:04,938
Economics from Japan's perspective is quite interesting.

60
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:08,772
Historically, it's one of the first fully developed societies..

61
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,623
But I'm not quite sure that experience allows us any power of persuasion.

62
00:03:12,623 --> 00:03:14,146
Complicated isn't it.

63
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,992
Makio, how about you?

64
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:18,036
Huh?

65
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:21,817
I made a sssssuggestion box.

66
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:23,044
Sssssuggestion box?

67
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:25,190
I learned it in Japanese history class.

68
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,747
As class president, I'll use this to bring the class together a bit more.

69
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:30,750
Not bad.

70
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,140
Yeah.

71
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:36,891
How's the gang been lately?

72
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:40,436
You don't have to worry about that.

73
00:03:41,341 --> 00:03:43,068
More milk?

74
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:45,036
Nah, I'm good.

75
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:48,713
Alright...  I'm off to school.

76
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:50,346
Have a good day.

77
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,251
Be careful.

78
00:03:56,378 --> 00:04:00,426
If he finds out I was the one who acquired the Shichiriya Gang...

79
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:02,166
What would he say?

80
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:04,597
Mikio...

81
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:06,593
Huh?

82
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:08,951
What the hell are you thinking?

83
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:15,306
Why involve yourself with the gang's work all of a sudden?

84
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,175
No reason.

85
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,687
It looked interesting is all..

86
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,095
Oh, a suggestion box.

87
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:30,748
You look like you're enjoying yourself lately.

88
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:34,621
I'm basically a greedy carnivore.

89
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:37,294
I always get whatever I want.


90
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:39,161
From now on..

91
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:43,216
I won't hold back and enjoy school.

92
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:46,939
Well, that's how it is...

93
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:50,839
N-n-n-ext time..  About l-l-l-ove...

94
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,094
Good morning!

95
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:01,949
Good morning.

96
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:04,358
Good morning.

97
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:07,536
If Jun is still here, then it must mean we're not late.

98
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:11,112
What's that supposed to mean?  And by the way, you're late way too often.

99
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:12,949
My bad.

100
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,858
"To Sakaki-kun:
I'll make lunch sometime.  Would you like to go somewhere sometime?"

101
00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:22,000
Sis!

102
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:25,176
Azusa, what's wrong?

103
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:28,318
You took my pencil case by accident.

104
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:32,528
Oh!  Anikinder!

105
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:34,985
Sorry, I made a mistake.

106
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:36,499
Jeez..

107
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:37,338
Sorry.

108
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:40,217
Azusa, you've gotten big.

109
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:42,065
Jun-kun, good morning.

110
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:43,119
Morning.

111
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,767
Who's the old man?

112
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:46,366
Old man?

113
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,392
He's not an old man, he's my friend.

114
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:50,795
Oh right!  You're Sakaki!

115
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:51,655
Huh?  Sa-sa..?

116
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:52,987
Enough, hurry up and get to school!

117
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,526
Ok, see you later!

118
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:55,831
Have a good day.

119
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:00,767
Sorry, sometimes I talk about you at home.

120
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:03,169
Really?

121
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,778
Shall we?

122
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,190
We'll all be late.

123
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,131
Ok.

124
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:13,160
Alright...

125
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,012
Today is the day, I..

126
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,170
Ask Umemura-san out on a date!

127
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,881
Ask Umemura-san out on a date!!

128
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:29,094
Ask Umemura-san out date myself!!!!

129
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,349
Winner!

130
00:06:33,884 --> 00:06:35,484
That was great, Makky!

131
00:06:35,484 --> 00:06:36,118
Really?

132
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:37,667
As expected of my underling.

133
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,716
You might be 2nd strongest guy here, next to me.

134
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:41,694
No way..

135
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:44,519
Hoshino-kun is good at judging people.

136
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,729
Not bad.  You used to practice Judo?

137
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:49,900
Yea, ever since I saw Yamashita win the Gold Medal at the Olympics at Los Angeles.

138
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,140
I see.. the Olympics at Los Angeles..

139
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,995
But you weren't even born yet.

*The Olympics at Los Angeles: 1984.*

140
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:54,935
Huh?!

*The Olympics at Los Angeles: 1984.*

141
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:57,636
Are you really 17?

142
00:06:57,636 --> 00:07:00,806
Every now and then, you seem like an adult..

143
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:02,075
That spot between your eyebrows.

144
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:03,616
And his skin.

145
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:05,323
I think you're hallucinating..

146
00:07:05,323 --> 00:07:07,501
Yea, Makky's really youthful.

147
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:11,921
But late in the day, his mustache grows out like my dad's.

148
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:15,150
But he's pure with a fresh smile.

149
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,192
I think you look really young.

150
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:20,109
Sakura-something...

151
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:24,761
Sakaki, do you want to spar with me,?

152
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:45,325
Alright, at this rate..

153
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:46,583
Makky's really strong.

154
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,843
Amazing!

155
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:51,888
I'll get Umemura-san's heart!

156
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:10,710
My Boss
My Hero

157
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:17,968
Knark52nd Dolis Random Emotion

158
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:23,476
Timings from Tianj.
Raws from gryzze.

159
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,152
"Minami-sensei."

160
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:32,155
"Thank you for enduring my horrible journal for the last 3 months."

161
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:33,900
You're welcome.

162
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:38,129
Feels like it's become a bit lonely.

163
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:41,869
"Lastly, I'd like to give you a present."

164
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:44,049
Present?

165
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:47,584
"Flip me."

166
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:02,724
Iron-face.

167
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:03,995
Iron..

168
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:08,213
I..Ir.Ir..Iro..Iron..

169
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:09,385
Yuri..?

170
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:13,343
What do you want to talk about?

171
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:18,981
This is just a feeling..

172
00:09:18,981 --> 00:09:22,085
If I'm wrong, tell me... but..

173
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:28,196
What is it?
Get to the point.

174
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:31,705
Are you in love?

175
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:32,999
What?

176
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:36,095
And with one of our students.. An older looking one..

177
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:37,461
I'm not.

178
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:43,035
No I'm not! There's no way that could happen.

179
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:44,950
I see.

180
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,918
They're still kids.

181
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,915
And I'm an adult over 20.

182
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:53,635
I see.

183
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:57,878
In Tokyo, there are laws regarding healthy upbringing of youth.

184
00:09:57,878 --> 00:10:02,538
No one can become involved with a youth under 18 years old. 

185
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:08,293
If you break that law, you'll be apprehended by the police.

186
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:11,686
Wha?

187
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:13,519
Umemura Hikari-san...

188
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,329
Is 17 years old, born in March during the first year of Heisei rule (1989).

**Method of stating years in relation to an emperor's rule. 
Showa (1926 - 1989), Heisei (1989 - present)

189
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:18,685
Umemura-san was born during the Heisei?

**Method of stating years in relation to an emperor's rule.
Showa (1926 - 1989), Heisei (1989 - present)

190
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,474
Yes, all of your classmates...

**Method of stating years in relation to an emperor's rule.
Showa (1926 - 1989), Heisei (1989 - present)

191
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:23,455
Were born during the last year of Showa rule (1988) or the beginning of Heisei rule (1989).

**Method of stating years in relation to an emperor's rule.
Showa (1926 - 1989), Heisei (1989 - present)

192
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:27,823
I see, everyone's so proper I hadn't even noticed..

193
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:30,455
I can understand if the police take me down...

194
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:33,152
But getting arrested for something like that isn't even funny.

195
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:34,60
Continuing on..

196
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,622
Her father used to run a company...

197
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:39,819
But now is a laborer at a construction company.

198
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,506
Her mother has a part time job...

199
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:44,357
So the oldest child Hikari-san takes care of most of the housekeeping.

200
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,850
Born in Heisei, how splendid..

201
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,330
Indeed.. because of that she's often very late in the morning.

202
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,911
I...

203
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:58,397
Even for just another second, want to be with her..

204
00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:00,298
And..

205
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:02,688
Protect her...

206
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:05,260
See her smile.

207
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:08,471
That's all.

208
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:11,211
Then a date should be fine.

209
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:12,893
Really?

210
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:13,945
It'll be fine.

211
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:16,713
You're in prime condition.

212
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:17,889
Yea..

213
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:20,820
But Umemura-san..

214
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,107
Do you think she l-l-l-likes me?

215
00:11:26,107 --> 00:11:28,938
What do you all think?

216
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,078
What do you guys think?

217
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:33,383
She likes you, yea?

218
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:35,529
She likes you, probably.

219
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,850
She definitely likes you.

220
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,098
- Really?
- Yes.

221
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,944
Really? Really? Really?

222
00:11:41,944 --> 00:11:42,776
You think so too?

223
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:44,774
Seriously, you're fine.

224
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:46,401
But..but..

225
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:49,926
I'm way dumber than Umemura-san...

226
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,786
Plus I was born during the Showa, so I have the oldest looking face in class...

227
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:58,795
Will my good points really get through to her?

228
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:00,246
They'll get through.

229
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:02,405
They'll get through loud and clear.

230
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:05,900
Damn it!  I'm so jealous of that Umemura punk!

231
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,653
Really?

232
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:09,479

233
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,819
Who do you think you're calling a punk?!

234
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:15,388
Don't get carried away and call her by name without using -san!!

235
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:16,203
I'm sorry!

236
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,330
However!

237
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,212
You, a lady killer, should have nothing to fear.

238
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:24,178
That's right.
There is nothing you cannot obtain.

239
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:27,780
Please think positively.

240
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,907
OK.

241
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:35,904
I tried thinking positively.

242
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:39,685
I'm the wife of a gang leader.

243
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:41,563
You guys.  Mess them up.

244
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:42,634
Yes ma'am!

245
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:46,241
Not bad.

246
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:48,391
The Class President of Love!

247
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:49,553
Love Hunter!

248
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:52,338
Love Hunter! Love Hunter!
- Stop it.

249
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,365
Hikari~ Makio~ Hikari~

250
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:58,692
The first date is about leaving school together.

251
00:12:58,692 --> 00:12:59,842
Leaving school together?

252
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:00,840
Yea.

253
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,892
Just say, "Want to walk back together?"

254
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:05,470
Want to walk back together?

255
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,428
How cute!

256
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:11,001
When you're walking back together, it's all about "Agnes Road."

257
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:11,955
"Agnes Road?"

258
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:16,912
It's a special road at this school only couples can walk.

259
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:20,067
Oh, that small path out by the back gate.

260
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,297
Right.  Along that path there's a park and shops that sell ice cream and stuff..

261
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:26,163
When I was a freshman I accidentally took that path alone.

262
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:29,500
That happened to me too!  It was awkward, wasn't it?!

263
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,438
It was so sad walking it alone, tears came from my eyes.

264
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:35,573
Agnes Road?

265
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:39,246
If two people take that road together and enjoy it...

266
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:42,506
They'll become a real couple.

267
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:45,811
I see. I see.

268
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:53,825
The typical pattern of events is: the Photo Booth, eating Ice Cream, then talking on the bench.

269
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:56,376
Photo-booth..  Ice Cream..

270
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:58,796
Talking on the bench?

271
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,195
Talking..on..the...bench...

272
00:14:01,195 --> 00:14:03,331
For now, just successfully invite her.

273
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:05,246
Even though you're ten years too slow for Umemura..

274
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:08,176
Ok, I'll do my best.

275
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:10,576
Hikari?

276
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:15,573
Sakaki-kun...

277
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,641
Umemura-san...

278
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:34,620
Do you... do.. you... y-y-you..

279
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,577
Do you want to walk back from school with me today?

280
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,889
Huh?

281
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:45,954
Yes.

282
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,502
I'd love to.

283
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,790
I'll see you later then.

284
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:56,273
Aniki!

285
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:02,533
You did it Sakaki!

286
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,593
Yes..

287
00:15:04,896 --> 00:15:07,198
Alright...

288
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,080
Sakaki Makio...

289
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,714
Is gonna get Umemura's heart at Agnes Road!!

290
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,380
This is...

291
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,564
Agnes Road?

292
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:27,014
It's Hayasaka-kun and Mita-san..

293
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:30,263
Seems like they've been going out since the Test of Courage.

294
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:35,357
This is my first time... Shall we?

295
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:36,733
Yes.

296
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,384
Will Hikari be Ok?

297
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,192
Huh?

298
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:50,133
Sakurakoji?

299
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:51,719
Hagiwara!

300
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,330
What are you doing?

301
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,301
Huh?

302
00:15:58,066 --> 00:15:59,419
Mikky!

303
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,091
The little brother?

304
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:05,121
Are you worried about your big brother?

305
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,247
Um.. yeah..

306
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:09,102
You two are really close!

307
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,167
Lets go together!

308
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:13,923
I've wanted to take this path at least one time as a couple before I graduate.

309
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,684
Sakurakoji, let's go.  It'll be awkward to walk here alone, right?

310
00:16:27,748 --> 00:16:29,140
Wha?

311
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,952
No topic..

312
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:34,900
I have no topic..!

313
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,294
What have I been talking to women about until now?

314
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:39,752
Cars?

315
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:41,337
Golf?

316
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:44,025
Precious metals?  Gambling?

317
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:47,164
No, I can't..

318
00:16:47,164 --> 00:16:49,082
Should I compliment her clothes?

319
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:50,307
No..

320
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:53,557
She's wearing her uniform..

321
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:55,494
That's right!

322
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:57,407
Her hair!

323
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,911
I'll compliment her hairstyle!

324
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,151
The part in your hair is pretty.

325
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:05,033
Huh?

326
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:08,694
It's like... so perfectly split in the middle.

327
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,193
Oh..

328
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:15,458
Is it weird?   I have no time in the mornings so
 I just tie it like this.

329
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,199
It makes me look lazy.

330
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,516
No, it looks really good. Seriously.

331
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:24,336
It shows your straightforward personality.

332
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:25,902
Weird.

333
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:27,979
This is fun.

334
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:29,653
Eh?

335
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:32,081
The breeze feels good.

336
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:39,315
You're right.

337
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:44,443
The mood seems pretty nice..

338
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:47,265
Yeah, it's moving along smoothly.

339
00:17:58,155 --> 00:18:00,466
Is that...

340
00:18:00,466 --> 00:18:05,038
Point 1:  The damn photo booth..

341
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:07,856
Let's take our pictures.

342
00:18:07,856 --> 00:18:10,690
So this is a photo booth?

343
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:15,667
It's fun.

344
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:23,102
Point 2: The damn ice cream.

345
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:29,033
Wha?  350 yen for a ring is way too cheap!

346
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:32,964
This is expensive..  Reduce it to 300 yen?

347
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,335
I've got cram school now, so I'm out.

348
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:41,304
- Great work.
- Thanks.

349
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:46,755
Sakurakoji, are you fine with just watching?

350
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:49,519
If you like that person, tell them or you'll regret in.

351
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,646
Because Hikari and Makky have no clue.

352
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:56,844
Later.

353
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,438
"Like"?

354
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:05,384
I knew you were after Aniki!!

355
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:07,031
We're childhood friends.

356
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:14,443
We lived in the same apartment complex during elementary school. 

357
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:16,726
We always played together.

358
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:22,224
Then during junior high and high school..

359
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:28,572
She gradually became more mature... cuter..

360
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:31,624
Now I can't properly talk to her anymore..


361
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:38,233
Makky's tall amongst other things so she looks better paired with him anyways.

362
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:42,063
I'm going home.

363
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:44,805
It's good that they're happy together.

364
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:46,365

365
00:19:50,777 --> 00:19:56,255
Point 3:  The damn bench..

366
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:57,212
Huh?

367
00:19:57,212 --> 00:19:58,669
Huh?

368
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:00,078
Oh.. um..

369
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:05,806
Today is an a-wa-re (beautiful) sunset.

*Reference to episode 3*

370
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:09,913
Yea, you're right.

371
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:16,780
So what do we do after this?

372
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,883
Go to a bar?

373
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:23,641
No..  Alcohol is out of the question.

374
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:26,772
A casino?  Cabaret club?

375
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:28,666

376
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:33,832
Something more Heisei..

377
00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:40,198
Sorry, I have to go.

378
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,240
Eh?

379
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,409
I have work all of a sudden.

380
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,149
Work?

381
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:46,983
I see.

382
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,572
If it's Ok..  Want to come along?

383
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:54,794
Excuse me?

384
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,531
Huh?  Who's this?

385
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:00,823
She lives next door.

386
00:21:00,823 --> 00:21:04,091
Her parents sometimes ask me to watch her for an hour or so.

387
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:05,985
I get 500 yen.

388
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:10,908
My little brothers, Hayato and Asahi..

389
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:11,930
And Azusa..

390
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,702
Little sister, Nozomi.

391
00:21:13,702 --> 00:21:16,194
- Hello.
- Oh.. Hello.

392
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:17,826
- Could hold her for a second..
- Hey Sis..  Sis..

393
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:19,094
Wait a sec..

394
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:21,125
- Sis!
- What?

395
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,154
Where are your parents?

396
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:24,332
They're still at work.

397
00:21:24,332 --> 00:21:26,985
Hey Sis, where's my cram school schedule?

398
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,047
It's hanging on the fridge, right?

399
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:30,624
Give me your lunchbox.

400
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:33,037
Hry, who's he?

401
00:21:33,037 --> 00:21:34,714
Hey Sis, when's dinner?

402
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:38,919
I'm making it right now.  Clear that area.

403
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,615
- I'll be going.
- Have a good day.

404
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:43,795
"Have a good day..."

405
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,250
Ow!

406
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:49,965
Hey!

407
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:55,185
Just because you're young and cute doesn't mean you can do whatever you want dammit.

408
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:03,273
You sure are cute.

409
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:07,085
Huh?

410
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:10,160
This is your special "challenge" pen.

411
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:12,705
"Admission on Recommendation"?

412
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:15,600
It's the catalog for the university I'm testing for.

413
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,619
I was aiming for a national school, but it looks impossible.

414
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:23,089
So next week I'm taking that school's test because it gives financial aid.

415
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:24,474
I see..

416
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:28,037
If I decide on a school early, I can work a lot more.

417
00:22:31,004 --> 00:22:32,880
Itadakimasu.

*said before a meal

418
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,656
Itadakimasu.

*said before a meal

419
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,290
Help yourself.

420
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,256
Oh thank you.

421
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,714
Itadakimasu.

422
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:44,229
Azusa, stop watching TV and eat.

423
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:45,335
OK.

424
00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:46,880
Good..

425
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,813
Make sure you eat your carrots.

426
00:22:48,813 --> 00:22:49,555
OK.

427
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:51,586
This croquette looks good.

428
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:54,294
Did you put more effort into them this time?

429
00:22:54,294 --> 00:22:56,899
They're the same as always.

430
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:59,952
What an ordinary..

431
00:22:59,952 --> 00:23:02,883
What a peaceful scene..

432
00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:07,148
Azusa, turn off that TV.

433
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:08,790
No!

434
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,455
He really likes that show.

435
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:13,311
I like it too.

436
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:14,768
- You do?
- Yea.

437
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,792
Boys always want to be the hero.

438
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:20,007
You got it, Sakaki.

439
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,282
Really?

440
00:23:21,282 --> 00:23:23,502
I don't like it much.

441
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,606
You don't?

442
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:25,738
Hmm..

443
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:29,431
Everything is always solved with violence, right?

444
00:23:29,431 --> 00:23:31,047
Yea..

445
00:23:33,315 --> 00:23:38,253
When I was young, my dad's company went under.

446
00:23:38,253 --> 00:23:42,149
Men looking like Yakuza came to our home.

447
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:46,439
My father got beat up right in front of me.

448
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:54,309
I couldn't do anything..  I could only cry.. It was frustrating.

449
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,440
Thats why I hate violence.

450
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:01,853
I look down on people who fight.

451
00:24:01,853 --> 00:24:03,563
I won't forgive them.

452
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:12,688
Sorry, this talk about the TV show has nothing to do with this.

453
00:24:12,688 --> 00:24:15,438
We sold our old apartment and payed off our debt.

454
00:24:15,438 --> 00:24:18,349
But I still remember it sometimes.

455
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:23,597
What will you do after you graduate?

456
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:26,249
Something about taking over the family business?

457
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:28,779
Um..

458
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:36,485
This is really delicious.

459
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:38,189
So?

460
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:40,182
Good.

461
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:43,838
That's right..

462
00:24:43,838 --> 00:24:45,434
What am I thinking?

463
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:47,309
-Was it good?
-Yeah, it's great.

464
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:48,700
Thank you.

465
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:56,747
I'm no hero..

466
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:58,610
I'm a demon..

467
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,344
A demon above all..

468
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:04,252
A demon like me..

469
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:08,309
Wanting to protect her...

470
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:12,468
What a nice dream I was dreaming.

471
00:25:18,904 --> 00:25:20,547
Know how to get to the station?

472
00:25:20,547 --> 00:25:22,935
It's straight ahead from here.

473
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:27,363
Thanks for today.

474
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:30,404
Let's go somewhere next time.

475
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,526
I'll really make lunch.

476
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:35,202
Park..

477
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:38,747
- A movie sounds nice too..
- Umemura-san?

478
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:40,259
What?

479
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:45,439
I..

480
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:50,849
I am..

481
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:54,637
Young couple found!

482
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:58,184
What are you guys doing flirting around at a place like this?

483
00:25:59,245 --> 00:26:00,493
Let's go.

484
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:03,365
Hold up!

485
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:07,648
- This girl is way cute.
- Want to go out with me?

486
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:09,858
We have no business with guys.  Beat it.

487
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:11,229
Hurry up and go somewhere.

488
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:13,847
Ow!

489
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:14,912
You punks...

490
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,051
"Men looking like Yakuza came to our home."

491
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:24,471
"I couldn't do anything..
I could only cry... It was frustrating."

492
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:26,757
"Thats why I hate violence."

493
00:26:26,757 --> 00:26:29,049
"I look down on people who fight."

494
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:30,133
"I won't forgive them."

495
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:32,047
What are you doing!?

496
00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:34,693
Sakaki-kun!

497
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,884
Wanna go somewhere?

498
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:38,150
Stop, please!

499
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,918
Don't get in our way and just leave.

500
00:26:41,918 --> 00:26:43,731
Sakaki-kun! Sakaki-kun!

501
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:48,701
Let go of her, please!

502
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:56,089
Stop! Let go!

503
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:57,354
Let go of her, please.

504
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,509
What's with him?

505
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:07,489
Hey, stop!

506
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:09,350
Let her go, please.

507
00:27:33,503 --> 00:27:35,185
What's up with this guy?

508
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:36,575
Let's get outta here.

509
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:40,550
Sakaki-kun?

510
00:27:42,355 --> 00:27:44,188
Sakaki-kun?!

511
00:27:44,188 --> 00:27:48,075
Sakaki-kun!

512
00:27:49,723 --> 00:27:51,207
Sakaki-kun!

513
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,504
Aniki, get a hold of yourself.

514
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:54,766
Aniki!

515
00:27:57,452 --> 00:27:58,982
Master!

516
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,790
Are you alright?

517
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,569
How could something like this happen to you?

518
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:09,911
- Find out who did it.
- Yes sir.

519
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:11,918
Forget it!

520
00:28:15,428 --> 00:28:16,870
It hurts.

521
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,110
Aniki..

522
00:28:19,775 --> 00:28:22,335
It hurts, damn it.

523
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:29,400
Up until now..

524
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:35,225
Being called Yakuza..

525
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:38,861
Being called a Villian..

526
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:42,538
It never bothered me..

527
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:48,911
Leave me alone.

528
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:49,719
But what about your wounds?

529
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,832
It's fine. Please!

530
00:28:58,546 --> 00:29:00,173
Kazu.

531
00:29:01,243 --> 00:29:02,744
Kazu!

532
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:26,588
This Wednesday after school there will be a physical exam in the gym.

533
00:29:26,588 --> 00:29:30,738
Our class will be there sometime after 4:30 will start when the sophomores finish.

534
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:34,284
As you all know, participation is optional.

535
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:40,785
Um.. Sakaki-kun.

536
00:29:40,785 --> 00:29:42,201
Yesterday Sakaki-kun..

537
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:43,762
I'm fine.

538
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,851
It's nothing.

539
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,916
Sorry for being late.

540
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,796
Sakaki-kun!

541
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,202
Excuse me.

542
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:19,624
Laugh!

543
00:30:19,624 --> 00:30:20,950
Ok.

544
00:30:24,432 --> 00:30:26,356
His wounds probably still hurt.

545
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:29,410
He's probably embarrassed you saw him being so uncool.

546
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,024
He'll come around in time.

547
00:30:32,024 --> 00:30:34,069
You think so...?

548
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:36,240
Did I do something to make him hate me..?

549
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,953
It's fine, Makky isn't that complicated a person.

550
00:30:40,953 --> 00:30:43,887
Cheer up.

551
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:47,247
Ouch.

552
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:51,628
Does it? But your recovery rate is amazing.

553
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:56,331
Such severe wounds healing this much in only 3 days...

554
00:30:58,035 --> 00:31:03,015
But the wounds of the heart still haven't healed, right?

555
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,737
Sensei.

556
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:10,750
I...

557
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:16,819
I'm lying.

558
00:31:17,974 --> 00:31:20,782
To my friends..

559
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:23,860
Even to you..

560
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,664
I'm lying.

561
00:31:27,203 --> 00:31:28,814
Really?

562
00:31:30,225 --> 00:31:33,013
That's why..

563
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,273
It doesn't matter that it's hurt..

564
00:31:43,244 --> 00:31:44,689
Makky..

565
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:46,921
Good morning, Makky.

566
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:48,103
Good morning.

567
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:49,421
Early aren't you?

568
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:52,788
Making sure you don't run into Hikari?

569
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,277
That's not it.

570
00:31:55,277 --> 00:31:58,333
Jun-kun and Sakaki.

571
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,850
Azusa, what's up?

572
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,960
Sis forgot this.

573
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,659
Ah!

574
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:07,365
Umemura-san's "challenge" pen.

575
00:32:07,365 --> 00:32:10,177
Sis has a test today too..

576
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:11,447
Huh?

577
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:17,884
That's right..  She's taking the test now.

578
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:21,956
Sakaki, bring this to Sis.

579
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:23,740
You won't make it.

580
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,416
Sis was saying that you're a hero.

581
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:32,728
She was saying, "Saving me from the bad guys..  He's like a hero."

582
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,170
Please, Sakaki!

583
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,905
Go, Makky.

584
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:44,102
I'll think of some kind of excuse to tell Sensei.

585
00:32:44,102 --> 00:32:46,776
If you don't go...

586
00:32:48,144 --> 00:32:49,901
I will.

587
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:01,945
Excuse me!

588
00:34:01,945 --> 00:34:03,254
Stop!

589
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:08,589
Umemura-san!

590
00:34:09,277 --> 00:34:10,680
Umemura-san!

591
00:34:12,107 --> 00:34:14,427
Is Umemura-san here?

592
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,751
Umemura-san! Umemura-san!

593
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:19,755
Ah!

594
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:21,205
Umemura-san.

595
00:34:21,924 --> 00:34:23,508
Sasaki-kun!

596
00:34:28,664 --> 00:34:30,481
What's going on?

597
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,791
Here...

598
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:42,738
Do your best on the test.

599
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:50,254
No way.  All for this?

600
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,747
Today is just the interviews.

601
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:56,267
Huh?

602
00:34:58,527 --> 00:35:02,795
I'm happy. Thank you.

603
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:11,802
You'd better get back.

604
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:20,633
Lets meet at the park from before after the test.

605
00:35:25,293 --> 00:35:27,394
I'll be waiting.

606
00:35:57,467 --> 00:36:02,417
Next, St. Agnes Academy: Umemura Hikari-san.

607
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:04,068
Here.

608
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,951
Jun?

609
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:28,844
Makky...

610
00:36:28,844 --> 00:36:33,726
Said he couldn't make it so he asked me to go in his place.

611
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:39,492
Oh..

612
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:42,140
I see..

613
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,655
He could've just sent an e-mail..

614
00:36:45,926 --> 00:36:48,211
I bought pudding too.

615
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,978
I have no idea what he's thinking..

616
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,275
I don't want them to go to waste, so you want to eat them together?

617
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,956
That's right, you don't like sweets..

618
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,389
Thanks..

619
00:37:37,018 --> 00:37:41,155
"I'm hiding things from my friends as well.."

620
00:37:41,155 --> 00:37:45,903
"I'm lying..  To my friends.. Even to you..."

621
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:12,159
It's a bit boring without the journals, isn't it?

622
00:38:17,668 --> 00:38:19,800
Sensei...

623
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,057
I..

624
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,922
I've learned yet another lesson.

625
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:45,646
There are things I can't obtain.

626
00:38:48,572 --> 00:38:51,809
I..

627
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:55,557
I've learned many things at school.

628
00:38:55,557 --> 00:38:59,266
And had many joyful experiences.

629
00:39:01,353 --> 00:39:04,893
But now...

630
00:39:07,921 --> 00:39:10,383
I'm in so much pain..

631
00:39:13,597 --> 00:39:18,272
Even though I look like this, I was strong.

632
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:22,119
Since my mom's death I've never cried once.

633
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:25,116
In fights...  In anything...

634
00:39:25,116 --> 00:39:28,181
I've never lost once.

635
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:34,575
But even so..

636
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:42,200
Why am I so weak?

637
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:50,061
I..

638
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,995
I was better off not knowing things like this..

639
00:40:01,326 --> 00:40:05,852
If it was this painful...

640
00:40:05,852 --> 00:40:09,298
I was better off not knowing about youth.

641
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,943
All I can say is..

642
00:40:32,905 --> 00:40:36,932
Come to school tomorrow..

643
00:40:41,511 --> 00:40:46,986
There will be times when you become hurt, also times when you're in agony.

644
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,319
But even so..

645
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:51,398
Come here.

646
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:59,559
Come to school, study, talk, and eat lunch.

647
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:03,626
And when you overcome your sadness..

648
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:08,363
You'll definitely be stronger than you are now.

649
00:41:08,363 --> 00:41:14,042
That's true strength.

650
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:17,644
You're not weak.

651
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,231
Don't worry.

652
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:25,222
You'll be Ok.

653
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:49,834
Why did father say such a thing?

654
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:53,839
Saying that he'll make me take over if brother can't graduate.

655
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,481
When he never intended to..

656
00:41:56,481 --> 00:42:00,178
Boss once said:

657
00:42:00,178 --> 00:42:02,229
Master has the physical strength.

658
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:05,262
And Master Mikio has the brains.

659
00:42:05,262 --> 00:42:08,090
If the two combine their strengths and take over.

660
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,548
There would be nothing more wonderful.

661
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:16,104
Are you interested in working with the gang?

662
00:42:16,104 --> 00:42:18,199
Not particularly.

663
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:22,418
But I have no intention of working beneath my brother.

664
00:42:22,418 --> 00:42:27,813
During college I thought about saving up money and starting a business.

665
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:32,112
But this direction might be more interesting...

666
00:42:32,112 --> 00:42:34,072
Just kidding.

667
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:37,526
Hey Kuroi-san?

668
00:42:37,526 --> 00:42:41,263
Will you become my ally?

669
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:05,189
I was able to have a nice dream..

670
00:43:11,775 --> 00:43:15,127
"Days Until Mid-Term Exams."

671
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:25,840
Yo..

672
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,126
I mean..

673
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:28,729
Hello?

674
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:30,369
Hello, Makky?

675
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:33,825
Sakura-something?  It's Sunday, what's up?

676
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:39,493
I'm almost at your house.

677
00:43:39,493 --> 00:43:42,932
Can you meet me right now?

678
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,648

679
00:43:46,648 --> 00:43:47,712
Huh?

680
00:43:47,712 --> 00:43:50,328

681
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:53,080

682
00:43:58,248 --> 00:43:59,728

683
00:43:59,728 --> 00:44:02,235
What do I do?

684
00:44:02,235 --> 00:44:04,414
What do I do?!

685
00:44:07,724 --> 00:44:10,098

686
00:44:10,098 --> 00:44:12,971

687
00:44:12,971 --> 00:44:16,333

688
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:18,464

689
00:44:18,464 --> 00:44:20,687

690
00:44:20,687 --> 00:44:22,990
