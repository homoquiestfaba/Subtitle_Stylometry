man burned to death

at Pablo Psychiatric Hospital.

00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,640
The hospital claims the patient

00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:26,844
had no extraneous materials
needed to start a fire,

8
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:29,981
and no such materials
were found at the site.

Local investigators say
all the evidence points out

10
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:36,087
that the victim was
burned from within,

known as self-combustion.

with the patient informed us

the patient claimed to
be possessed by a spirit.

00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:44,188
Boys.

187
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:46,657
You saw how awkward
she was around Leo.

188
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,192
Yeah, he better watch it.

189
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:58,402
[crickets chirping]

190
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,255

[suspenseful music]

00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:33,604
[mirror cracking]

194
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:34,438
[thud roaring]

195
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:35,472
Oh my God.

196
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:39,476
What the hell was that?

197
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,310
Stay here.

198
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,446
No.

199
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:45,449
[suspenseful music]

200
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,590
[Derek] Cora.

201
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:54,458
Cora?

202
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,404
- Oh.
- Oh my goodness.

203
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:08,672
You hit your head.

204
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,573
I'm okay.

205
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:10,541
[Derek] Oh, come on.

206
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:11,708
Let's get up on your bed here.

207
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:12,777
[Jennifer] Here we go.

208
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,144
Okay.

209
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:15,479
- Oh.
- Oh, hey.

210
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:16,446
- Oh, it's okay.
- Hey.

211
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,514
Hey, it's all right.

212
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:19,716
- Bad dream.
- I'm okay.

213
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,119
[Derek] Let me
see, let me see.

214
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:22,787
Oh.

215
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:25,422
Up.

216
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,424
Down.

217
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:29,560
Down.

218
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,629
Left.

219
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:33,497
Right.

220
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,432
Great.

221
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:40,070
[speaking in foreign language] Tell me, did she have
previous concussions?

222
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,154
[speaking in foreign language]
No.

223
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,197
No.

224
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,157
I don’t know.

225
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,577
Allergic reactions to
medications?

226
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,786
No.

227
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:54,668
Well... We can do
a CT scan... if you want.

228
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,604
[Technician] Cora,
we are ready for you.

229
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:20,444
[light dramatic music]

230
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,269
This patient's alive?

231
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,538
[Technician] Yeah, I watched
her walk into the room.

232
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:49,874
But it might have changed.

233
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:52,576
The machine has malfunctioned.

234
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:53,911
[Technician] We checked
after the first round,

235
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:55,512
it's working fine.

236
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:56,881
No it's not.

237
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:58,582
Let's run her again.

238
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:06,523
[dramatic music]

239
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:37,621
[people chattering]

240
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,749
[speaking in foreign language]
Whiskey?

241
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:06,851
Whiskey?

242
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,113
[speaking in foreign language]
Want to tell?

243
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:37,789
One patient, a girl.
Her CT is the same as...

244
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,750
Will you be able to help her?

245
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,171
The second shot was normal.

246
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,592
Hmmm... that's it.

247
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,052
How are you?

248
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,012
My affairs?

249
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,097
Nobody asks the bartender
about his business.

250
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,807
They tell him theirs.

251
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,228
Cheers.

252
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:14,718

[thud banging]

263
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,024
Hey.

264
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:11,062
[ominous music]

265
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:13,864
It's okay.

266
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:21,504
[phone ringing]

267
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:35,719
Hello?

268
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:36,619
[Darya] There you are.

269
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,520
Are you okay?

270
00:20:37,554 --> 00:20:38,956
Yeah, I'm fine.

271
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:41,292
[Darya] Where are you?

272
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,860
How come you're not at work?

273
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:43,693
Shoot.

274
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,696
What time is it?

275
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,165
[Darya] Time to be at work.

276
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:51,534
- I overslept again.
- It's crazy.

277
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:52,303
The police are here.

278
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:53,771
A lady went through the window.

279
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:55,272
The little girls
parents were pissed.

280
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:57,074
First her cat scans
kept changing,

281
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:59,010
then she is in the
room with a jumper,

282
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:00,077
and they took the girl home.

283
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:00,911
Stop talking, please.

284
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:02,079
I'll be right in.

285
00:21:02,113 --> 00:21:03,080
[Darya] All right, hurry up.

286
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:05,282
Thank you, Darya.

287
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:08,819
[light suspenseful music]

288
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:17,294
Sorry.

289
00:21:17,328 --> 00:21:18,229
- There you are.
- Oh, hey.

290
00:21:18,262 --> 00:21:20,097
What the hell is going on?

291
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:21,032
I've been interrogated.

292
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:21,866
Can you imagine?

293
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:23,100
First time in my life.

294
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:24,268
They've been asking me
all those questions.

295
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:25,102
Did I see anything?

296
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,669
Did I hear anything?

297
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,942
[dramatic music]

298
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,578
[phone ringing]

299
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:14,819
Hello, can I speak
with Mr or Mrs Walters?

300
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:15,920
[Derek] This is he.

301
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:18,122
Cora Walters' father.

302
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:20,623
[Derek] Yeah.

303
00:22:20,657 --> 00:22:22,326
This is Nina
from the hospital.

304
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:26,363
I just wanted to check
in on your daughter.

305
00:22:26,397 --> 00:22:27,231
How is she?

306
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:31,634
[Derek] Not great after she
saw that woman commit suicide.

307
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:33,370
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

308
00:22:33,404 --> 00:22:36,240
These incidents can be
very traumatic for a child.

309
00:22:37,374 --> 00:22:40,111
I would like to come
over for a formal visit.

310
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:40,978
Is it okay?

311
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:41,812
Sure.

312
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,760
[speaking in foreign language] Kolya, hey!... I told you!
Hey... what’s this!...

313
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,553
[speaking in foreign language] What’s going on?
This is a mess!

314
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,555
You... come in... Sorry!

315
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:11,350
Come on, pick it up!
Well, we have taps.

316
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,602
Well, and who pays?
It’s from your salary.

317
00:23:13,944 --> 00:23:14,816
[tense music]

318
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:18,315
What have I got to do with it?
I'm just stuck, that's all.

319
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:23,225
[gate bell ringing]

320
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,863
- You can! Come on! Hey!...
- Ok.

321
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,963
[suspenseful music]

322
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:39,003
[doorbell ringing]

323
00:23:45,176 --> 00:23:48,379
Hi, I'm Nina,
from the hospital.

324
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:51,148
Oh, oh, please come in.

325
00:23:57,221 --> 00:23:59,890
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

326
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:01,425
Oh, thank you.

327
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,495
After the incident, we
kind of left in a hurry.

328
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:06,830
We didn't feel comfortable
leaving Cora there.

329
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:07,697
I understand.

330
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:11,802
Can I see Cora's
release documents?

331
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:12,903
Oh, yes.

332
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:37,995
Cat scan is.

333
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:41,765
This is Nina
from the hospital.

334
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,367
Hi, nice to meet you.

335
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,768
Nice to meet you, too.

336
00:24:45,803 --> 00:24:46,437
Should we sit?

337
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:49,106
Please.

338
00:24:57,147 --> 00:25:01,852
So, hysteria is
a form of neurosis

339
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:04,888
in which emotional disturbances

340
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:07,224
can turn to physical problems.

341
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:10,160
It could be related
with family stress,

342
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:11,929
death of a family member.

343
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,032
Is anyone in your family ill?

344
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:17,268
- No.
- No.

345
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:20,871
Then it could be hereditary.

346
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:24,942
Any history of mental illness?

347
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:28,045
Not that we know of.

348
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:29,546
No.

349
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,484
Then, it could be, as
we call it, free floating.

350
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:36,120
Which means it has
no particular reason.

351
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:41,425
Has Cora any kind
of strange behaviors

352
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,027
after she left the hospital?

353
00:25:47,598 --> 00:25:50,301
[tense music]

354
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:51,969
[Jennifer] Um.

355
00:25:52,002 --> 00:25:53,537
Let me show you.

356
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,073
[tense music]

357
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:09,353
Wow that's.

358
00:26:09,386 --> 00:26:10,854
She's a very sweet girl.

359
00:26:10,888 --> 00:26:11,922
This isn't like her.

360
00:26:13,424 --> 00:26:16,026
Does she walk in
her sleep often?

361
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,995
No, not at all.

362
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:19,063
Not that I know of.

363
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:25,602
Well, this could be
[speaking in foreign language],

364
00:26:25,636 --> 00:26:27,171
a night terror.

365
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,340
What's that?

366
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:36,013
A night terror is having
feelings of intense fear

367
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:38,048
in the middle of the night.

368
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:41,452
Relatively common but
usually at a younger age.

369
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,055
The child appears to be awake,

370
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:49,393
but actually they
are in a dream state.

371
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:53,063
They don't understand
what they are doing.

372
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:55,366
So what do you
recommend we do.

373
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:56,900
Right now, observation.

374
00:26:58,135 --> 00:27:00,170
We're not taking her
back to the hospital.

375
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:07,144
Actually, it's
better for the patient

376
00:27:07,177 --> 00:27:10,247
to see him in his
everyday environment.

377
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,516
[Jennifer] You mean here?

378
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:13,384
Yes.

379
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,487
[Jennifer] Who
would observe her?

380
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:19,390
I can.

381
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:23,494
If you're okay with that.

382
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:28,399
Cora, do you like
Ukrainian food?

383
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:32,269
[Cora] It's fine.

384
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,274
[Nina] So, what brought
you to work in Ukraine?

385
00:27:39,343 --> 00:27:41,578
My grandparents
were Ukrainian.

386
00:27:41,612 --> 00:27:42,513
[Nina] Really?

387
00:27:42,546 --> 00:27:43,981
I was born in the States

388
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:45,516
but we visited here a
lot when I was a kid.

389
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:50,320
One time I liked it so much
I just decided to stay.

390
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:53,657
[Derek] What's your
background, exactly?

391
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,297
[Nina] I studied here in
Kiev, in Bogomolets University.

392
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,065
Then I worked in a sleep clinic

393
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,568
for a few years in
the United States.

394
00:28:05,636 --> 00:28:07,671
And then I came back to Ukraine.

395
00:28:09,306 --> 00:28:10,207
Why'd you come back?

396
00:28:13,377 --> 00:28:16,013
I thought I could help
more people working here,

397
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:16,680
in a hospital.

398
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,519
And I got frustrated
by the sleep clinics.

399
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:26,323
They observe patients
only in the clinic,

400
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:31,094
but when it comes to sleep
disorders, that's ineffective.

401
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:33,530
You need to see the patients

402
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:36,667
in their everyday
sleeping environment.

403
00:28:44,408 --> 00:28:48,111
Cora, we've
invited Nina to stay.

404
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:50,180
- She's gonna.
- I know.

405
00:28:50,214 --> 00:28:52,449
She's gonna watch
me while I sleep.

406
00:28:52,483 --> 00:28:55,285
[ominous music]

407
00:29:05,462 --> 00:29:09,199
All of these paintings
were here when we came.

408
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:12,202
Which, some of them
are very beautiful.

409
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:14,404
Some of them, really good.

410
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:16,340
Yeah, yeah.

411
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:18,642
It was kind of cool to
see them when we moved in.

412
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:26,250
And towels for the bathroom.

413
00:29:26,283 --> 00:29:27,484
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

414
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:29,787
It's usually pretty
warm in here,

415
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:32,556
but if you need another
blanket, they're in the closet.

416
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:35,025
Can I get you anything else?

417
00:29:35,726 --> 00:29:36,660
I'm fine, thank you.

418
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:37,528
Okay.

419
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:39,530
Have a good night.

420
00:29:39,563 --> 00:29:40,397
I'll see you in the morning.

421
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,698
See you tomorrow.

422
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:53,577
[sullen music]

423
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:27,244
[water guggling]

424
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:43,594
[sullen music]

425
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:52,837
[children playing]

426
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,772
[Child Voiceover] Mom.

427
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:11,688
[sharp ominous music]

428
00:31:11,722 --> 00:31:14,124
[Nina gasps]

429
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:16,193
It's okay.

430
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:22,066
It's okay.

431
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:26,637
Did you go into the wrong room?

432
00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:29,941
Come on, sweetie.

433
00:31:29,974 --> 00:31:35,178
[music box playing]
[child giggling]

434
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:40,384
[light footsteps running]

435
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,820
[child laughing]

436
00:31:42,854 --> 00:31:45,823
[suspenseful music]

437
00:31:47,892 --> 00:31:52,864
[music box playing]
[light footsteps running]

438
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:03,407
[child giggling]

439
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,780
[door closing]

440
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,320
Cora.

441
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:17,955
Nina?

442
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,692
What's going on?

443
00:32:21,725 --> 00:32:22,626
How was Cora?

444
00:32:26,898 --> 00:32:29,733
At around 3:00, Cora
came into my room.

445
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:31,803
She just stood there, staring.

446
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:34,438
She was sleepwalking?

447
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:35,873
Maybe.

448
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:40,210
And honestly, I never seen
anything quite like this.

449
00:32:41,813 --> 00:32:43,380
So, what do we do now?

450
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:45,817
I recommend more observation.

451
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,386
The hospital needs a report and,

452
00:32:50,822 --> 00:32:54,792
before I know more, I'm
not sure what to tell them.

453
00:32:56,794 --> 00:32:59,296
[tense music]

454
00:33:19,784 --> 00:33:22,552
[dramatic music]

455
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:28,860
[speaking in foreign language]

456
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,997
[doorbell ringing]

457
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:07,965
Hey, come on in.

458
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:12,904
Get you set up upstairs.

459
00:34:13,905 --> 00:34:14,906
What have you got in here?

460
00:34:14,939 --> 00:34:15,773
Cameras.

461
00:34:16,874 --> 00:34:21,311
I also put a camera in the
hall so I can watch her.

462
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:25,549
Night terrors occur

463
00:34:25,582 --> 00:34:28,418
between stages three and
four of the sleep cycle.

464
00:34:29,821 --> 00:34:33,791
At that point, your body's
temperature continues to decline

465
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:35,993
as you head over to REM sleep.

466
00:34:39,063 --> 00:34:41,799
If the temperature is prevented
from dropping properly,

467
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,001
it can trigger a night terror.

468
00:34:44,035 --> 00:34:47,437
That's why I gave Cora
a lighter blanket,

469
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,507
and hopefully she'll agree to
wear it with thinner pajama.

470
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:54,045
Do night terrors
run in your family?

471
00:34:55,146 --> 00:34:56,346
I have no idea, why?

472
00:34:57,114 --> 00:34:59,016
Usually it's hereditary.

473
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,919
Has Cora had any
anesthesia recently?

474
00:35:01,953 --> 00:35:03,054
No.

475
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:07,457
Maybe she takes any medication
like asthma or allergy?

476
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,793
Not that I know of, why?

477
00:35:10,094 --> 00:35:11,728
Just all possible causes.

478
00:35:17,168 --> 00:35:18,135
And, we are on.

479
00:35:22,173 --> 00:35:24,909
[chilling music]

480
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:31,115
I thought Cora was
at home already.

481
00:35:31,148 --> 00:35:32,049
She's at school.

482
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:36,954
[door closing]

483
00:35:36,988 --> 00:35:38,421
oh, they're here.

484
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:43,895
Hey, how was school?

485
00:35:43,928 --> 00:35:44,795
As her.

486
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:47,965
[Derek] You gotta check this
set up out, it's pretty cool.

487
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:48,833
Okay.

488
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,002
Okay go, upstairs.

489
00:35:51,035 --> 00:35:52,904
[Derek] I'll be in my
office if you need me.

490
00:35:55,806 --> 00:35:58,475
[ominous music]

491
00:36:03,915 --> 00:36:05,016
Hey, how's it going?

492
00:36:12,656 --> 00:36:13,490
Wow.

493
00:36:15,692 --> 00:36:17,929
Has Cora had any trouble
adjusting to a new country?

494
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:19,830
[marker scribbling]

495
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:23,167
Well, with the school
changes here and the house.

496
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,735
Anything that might
cause an anxiety.

497
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,638
She likes it here.

498
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:30,841
I mean, it's obviously been

499
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:31,943
a bit more stressful
lately, but.

500
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,981
Derek said you
work long hours.

501
00:36:38,648 --> 00:36:39,482
Yeah.

502
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:44,188
How that goes, that makes
an impact in your household.

503
00:36:46,523 --> 00:36:49,592
Problems with your marriage?

504
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:50,460
No.

505
00:36:52,729 --> 00:36:54,231
I'm just trying to
get a clear picture

506
00:36:54,265 --> 00:36:55,199
of Cora's home life.

507
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:58,235
We're happily married.

508
00:37:04,976 --> 00:37:07,477

[sharp ominous music]

511
00:37:23,094 --> 00:37:24,527
I know we joke about it,

512
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:27,264
but do my long hours bother you?

513
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:32,870
I don't know, what's
the right answer?

514
00:37:32,903 --> 00:37:34,537
I can see that one
going either way.

515
00:37:35,272 --> 00:37:36,173
The honest one.

516
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,213
I miss you, but sometimes
it's good to miss someone.

517
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:48,585
Do you still think I'm hot?

518
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:50,620
[Derek] Of course.

519
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:57,228
Prove it.

520
00:37:57,261 --> 00:37:58,628
I said, prove it.

521
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,998
Prove what?

522
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:03,334
Prove that you
still think I'm hot.

523
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:07,104
Hm.

524
00:38:07,138 --> 00:38:08,638
Wait.

525
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:09,273
Are there camera's in here?

526
00:38:09,306 --> 00:38:10,341
Are we being watched?

527
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:11,175
No.

528
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,675
Wait, microphones?

529
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:13,778
Can she hear us?

530
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:16,579
I don't think so.

00:38:16,613 --> 00:38:17,281
[Derek scaring Jennifer]

532
00:38:17,314 --> 00:38:18,681
Stop.
[Derek laughs]

533
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,051
I don't want her to hear us.

534
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:21,152
Oh, who cares?

535
00:38:21,185 --> 00:38:22,319
I do.

536
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:24,587
Let's be loud.

537
00:38:24,621 --> 00:38:25,555
Make her jealous.

Cora.

545
00:40:35,152 --> 00:40:36,787
Are you okay, honey?

[Cora] Are you okay?

552
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,841
What happened?

553
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,211
[Cora] We went for a walk.

Don't tell your parents, okay?

555
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:07,717
Okay.

556
00:41:09,186 --> 00:41:11,889
This will be our little secret.

557
00:41:11,922 --> 00:41:14,225
[eerie music]

558
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:44,221
[appliance rattling]

559
00:41:49,193 --> 00:41:50,461
[Jennifer] Cora looked
good this morning.

560
00:41:50,494 --> 00:41:51,829
How'd it go last night.

561
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,768
It was, well it
can be some nebulism,

562
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:01,372
or sleepwalking as
you said, but unsure.

563
00:42:01,405 --> 00:42:02,506
There are many possibilities

564
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:04,241
and they're difficult
to determine.

565
00:42:06,143 --> 00:42:06,777
Okay.

566
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,149
Jennifer, please be patient.

567
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,151
It just takes time.

568
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:18,055
I'll talk to Cora and
try to make a connection.

569
00:42:22,092 --> 00:42:22,993
See you tonight.

570
00:42:26,597 --> 00:42:29,500
[melancholy music]

571
00:42:38,108 --> 00:42:40,177
[knocking on door]

572
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,312
[door opening]

573
00:42:41,345 --> 00:42:43,180
[Nina] Can I come in?

574
00:42:43,213 --> 00:42:44,882
Yeah, sure.

575
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:53,190
Which doll is this?

576
00:42:55,926 --> 00:42:56,560
Is this one?

577
00:42:57,428 --> 00:42:58,262
No.

578
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:02,499
Is it me?

579
00:43:04,234 --> 00:43:05,069
[Cora] Maybe.

580
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:09,540
[ominous music]

581
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:16,113
Wanted to see your drawings.

582
00:43:18,148 --> 00:43:18,982
Can I look?

583
00:43:27,991 --> 00:43:29,193
Do you want to be an artist?

584
00:43:31,328 --> 00:43:32,162
Maybe.

585
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:35,032
Probably one day,

586
00:43:35,065 --> 00:43:37,334
your father will be
selling your paintings.

587
00:43:40,137 --> 00:43:41,171
Maybe.

588
00:43:47,111 --> 00:43:48,946
Do you miss having
your mom around?

589
00:43:51,148 --> 00:43:54,017
Kind of, but it's
not a big deal.

590
00:43:57,721 --> 00:43:59,390
Oh, you have a teddy bear.

591
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:00,257
He protects you?

592
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,193
It's a stuffed animal.

593
00:44:05,295 --> 00:44:06,330
True.

594
00:44:08,432 --> 00:44:10,234
But it has a meaning behind it.

595
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:17,541
I have one and I
believe he protects me.

596
00:44:19,977 --> 00:44:20,611
Maybe.

597
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:32,189
I have a great idea.

598
00:44:33,357 --> 00:44:35,392
Follow me, come on.

599
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,662
[tense music]

600
00:44:51,175 --> 00:44:52,576
Oh, I'm not
allowed to have soda.

601
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:53,677
My mom doesn't let me.

602
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:57,281
Let's break the rules
for tonight, okay?

603
00:44:58,348 --> 00:44:59,183
Okay.

604
00:45:04,688 --> 00:45:09,326
And, we're gonna
have a fancy dinner.

605
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,161
Just the two of us.

606
00:45:11,195 --> 00:45:13,163
So we need some fancy glasses.

607
00:45:16,467 --> 00:45:17,668
Let's taste it.

608
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:26,376
And.

609
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,377
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

610
00:45:36,587 --> 00:45:38,288
I need to show you something.

611
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,290
Okay.

612
00:45:48,198 --> 00:45:48,800
Is it food?

613
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,234
No.

614
00:45:50,267 --> 00:45:51,568
Then what is it?

615
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:11,722
[Nina humming]

616
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,147
[door closing]

617
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,348
And now I play yours.

618
00:46:47,691 --> 00:46:49,526
[Derek] What's going on here?

619
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,527
Nothing.

620
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:51,361
We're having a fancy dinner.

621
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:52,195
Do you want to join us?

622
00:46:52,229 --> 00:46:53,130
Yeah, looks like fun.

623
00:46:55,499 --> 00:46:56,533
Is this soda?

624
00:46:59,136 --> 00:47:00,337
I love soda.

625
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,705
I told you that
was a good idea.

626
00:47:02,874 --> 00:47:03,875
I love these too,
did you get these?

627
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:05,242
[Nina] Yeah, I bought them.

628
00:47:05,275 --> 00:47:06,610
We use them as feet.
[eerie music]

629
00:47:06,643 --> 00:47:07,711
As your feet?

630
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:09,613
- Bad dancing.
- Hey.

631
00:47:09,646 --> 00:47:10,647
Where you going?

632
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:11,682
I'm going to bed now.

633
00:47:18,555 --> 00:47:20,624
Well it was good to see
her smile for a second.

634
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:21,658
Yeah.

635
00:47:21,692 --> 00:47:22,526
Bloop.

636
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:26,430
I think you can eat it now.

637
00:47:28,398 --> 00:47:30,500
I think I'd like
some real wine.

638
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:32,135
You?

639
00:47:32,169 --> 00:47:32,736
[Nina] Why not?

640
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:35,505
[ominous music]

641
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:36,373
[Derek laughing]

642
00:47:36,406 --> 00:47:37,674
[Derek] You ate
like half of it.

643
00:47:38,776 --> 00:47:40,778
I just like strawberry.

644
00:47:40,812 --> 00:47:42,579
Yeah, I could tell.

645
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:43,547
Want some more?

646
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,615
Yes, please.

647
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:49,787
So, how is your art
dealing business going?

648
00:47:50,922 --> 00:47:52,422
It's fine,

649
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:54,725
I'm just trying to figure out

650
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:57,527
what to do with
ruined paintings.

651
00:47:58,495 --> 00:47:59,730
[Nina] Yeah, it's so bad.

652
00:48:01,732 --> 00:48:04,735
[suspenseful music]

653
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:09,606
[Derek] I guess there's
not much to decide.

654
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,776
Pretty well destroyed.

655
00:48:13,543 --> 00:48:16,680
[Nina] Why are you laughing?

656
00:48:16,713 --> 00:48:17,648
To be honest,

657
00:48:18,515 --> 00:48:20,952
half of this work
was trash anyways.

658
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:23,286
[both laughing]

659
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,321
Oh my God, cheers.

660
00:48:24,354 --> 00:48:25,857
Don't tell them I said that.

661
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,191
What's going on?

662
00:48:30,293 --> 00:48:31,328
Where's Cora?

663
00:48:32,629 --> 00:48:34,398
She just went to bed.

664
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:36,700
I'll go check on her.

665
00:48:38,268 --> 00:48:38,903
Goodnight.

666
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:44,474
You gonna offer me a glass

667
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:46,576
of whatever it is
you're drinking?

668
00:48:47,477 --> 00:48:48,612
[Derek] Uh, yeah.

669
00:48:48,645 --> 00:48:49,479
You bet.

670
00:48:50,414 --> 00:48:51,748
[tense music]

671
00:48:51,783 --> 00:48:52,749
How was your day?

672
00:48:54,317 --> 00:48:55,752
[Jennifer] Long.

673
00:48:57,822 --> 00:48:58,790
[Derek] Why?

674
00:49:10,734 --> 00:49:13,236
[tense music]

675
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:22,512
Do you like her?

676
00:49:22,546 --> 00:49:23,380
Yeah.

677
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:27,852
I mean not like that.

678
00:49:29,653 --> 00:49:31,889
I like what she's
doing for Cora.

679
00:49:31,923 --> 00:49:33,323
She was great with her.

680
00:49:33,356 --> 00:49:34,624
You should have
seen her tonight.

681
00:49:36,928 --> 00:49:38,395
Aw, is someone jealous.

682
00:49:38,428 --> 00:49:39,262
Stop.

683
00:49:40,664 --> 00:49:42,432
Come on, where is
this coming from?

684
00:49:42,466 --> 00:49:44,001
Where is this coming from?

685
00:49:44,035 --> 00:49:45,736
I have a stranger
living in my house

686
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:46,938
with my husband and my daughter,

687
00:49:46,971 --> 00:49:49,639
having fancy dinners
and drinking wine

688
00:49:49,673 --> 00:49:51,843
and doing God knows what
else while I'm at work.

689
00:49:51,876 --> 00:49:52,810
Oh my gosh.

690
00:49:52,844 --> 00:49:54,812
Come on, that's ridiculous.

691
00:49:54,846 --> 00:49:56,680
You think this is funny?

692
00:49:56,713 --> 00:50:01,485
Yeah. [chuckles]

693
00:50:01,518 --> 00:50:02,787
Okay, yeah.

694
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,720
While you're at work,

695
00:50:03,755 --> 00:50:06,623
I'm having an affair
with the specialist.

696
00:50:06,656 --> 00:50:08,391
While our daughter sleep
walks around the house,

697
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:09,459
ruining my paintings.

698
00:50:11,062 --> 00:50:12,029
Don't mock me.

699
00:50:12,864 --> 00:50:13,898
Asshole.

700
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:24,041
[ominous music]

701
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,547
[sparks sizzling]

702
00:50:51,735 --> 00:50:54,972
[door creaking lightly]

703
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:10,320
[door opening]

704
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:29,339
[eerie music]

705
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:52,129
[tense music]

706
00:51:52,163 --> 00:51:53,865
Hey, what, what are we doing?

707
00:51:53,898 --> 00:51:55,465
She just pulled a bunch
of stuff out of the closet.

708
00:51:55,498 --> 00:51:56,100
- I don't.
- Cora?

709
00:51:56,133 --> 00:51:57,367
Go get her, yeah.

710
00:52:01,571 --> 00:52:02,405
Cora?

711
00:52:06,676 --> 00:52:07,510
She's not here.

712
00:52:18,789 --> 00:52:19,656
She isn't there.

713
00:52:19,689 --> 00:52:20,758
Where is she?

714
00:52:30,134 --> 00:52:31,135
Nina.

715
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:33,037
Nina, wake up!

716
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:33,905
Where's Cora?

717
00:52:35,139 --> 00:52:36,606
Oh shoot.

718
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,975
What time is it?

719
00:52:39,944 --> 00:52:41,745
[water splashing]

720
00:52:41,779 --> 00:52:42,612
Oh my God.

721
00:52:44,148 --> 00:52:46,616
[tense music]

722
00:52:51,488 --> 00:52:52,455
Cora, hey!

723
00:53:00,231 --> 00:53:01,065
Cora.

724
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:05,102
Oh my God!

725
00:53:10,775 --> 00:53:11,641
Oh my god.

726
00:53:11,675 --> 00:53:12,509
Get her.

727
00:53:14,744 --> 00:53:15,947
I can't get her.

728
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,183
[Derek] Watch her
head, watch her head.

729
00:53:20,151 --> 00:53:21,118
[Jennifer] Cora.

730
00:53:21,152 --> 00:53:22,320
Cora, breathe.

731
00:53:22,353 --> 00:53:23,020
[Derek] Breathe into her
mouth, breathe into her mouth.

732
00:53:23,054 --> 00:53:27,258
[speaking in foreign language]

733
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,993
Oh my God, Cora.

734
00:53:29,961 --> 00:53:31,128
Please.

735
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:32,495
Please, breathe.

736
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,572
I think she's sleeping now.

737
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:21,145
All right, I'll be back.

738
00:54:34,925 --> 00:54:37,094
How could you fall asleep?

739
00:54:39,163 --> 00:54:40,730
I'm sorry.

740
00:54:40,765 --> 00:54:41,866
She could have died.

741
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,169
I know, I'm sorry.

742
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:46,636
It will never happen again.

743
00:54:46,669 --> 00:54:47,570
Get out.

744
00:54:47,604 --> 00:54:49,273
Get the hell out of my house.

745
00:54:49,306 --> 00:54:50,241
I want her gone.

746
00:54:50,274 --> 00:54:51,641
- Okay.
- Tonight.

747
00:54:51,674 --> 00:54:52,575
Get out.

748
00:54:52,609 --> 00:54:54,078
Hey, Cora can hear you, quiet.

749
00:55:11,295 --> 00:55:14,198
[melancholy music]

750
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:35,152
Hey.

751
00:55:41,158 --> 00:55:42,659
Hey, I need to go.

752
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:46,797
I'm sorry.

753
00:55:57,808 --> 00:55:59,276
He will protect you.

[ominous music]

757
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:06,802
[speaking in foreign language] - Anton!
- Sorry, we are closed.

758
00:57:08,804 --> 00:57:11,306
Ah, it’s you.

759
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:14,226
I need a drink.

760
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:18,522
Can I offer you
something special?

761
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:24,361
Thirty years of whiskey,
cures everything.

762
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:26,613
Soft, fragrant.

763
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:28,198
You’ll like it!

764
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:32,786
At the expense of the
institution.

765
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:40,919
Will you give me ice?

766
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:42,379
This one is just clean.

767
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:56,685
Bad day?

768
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:00,397
Can I have more?

769
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:09,473

[sharp ominous music]

777
00:59:40,931 --> 00:59:41,532
I just want, I just,

778
00:59:41,565 --> 00:59:44,034
I'm just talking to you.

779
00:59:44,068 --> 00:59:45,169
[Nina screams]

780
00:59:45,202 --> 00:59:46,337
Stop, stop.

781
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:47,204
I'm just.

782
01:00:03,053 --> 01:00:05,889
[Nina whimpering]

783
01:00:12,196 --> 01:00:13,197
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

784
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,498
I, I didn't want to.

785
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:16,567
[Nina] Who are you?

786
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,601
Did you draw this?

787
01:00:19,103 --> 01:00:20,471
That's none of your business.

788
01:00:20,504 --> 01:00:21,605
[Man] Who drew this?

789
01:00:25,142 --> 01:00:26,176
A young girl.

790
01:00:27,244 --> 01:00:28,278
Wait, I'm not gonna hurt you.

791
01:00:28,312 --> 01:00:29,446
Please, wait, wait.

792
01:00:35,386 --> 01:00:36,553
This girl is in danger.

793
01:00:38,122 --> 01:00:39,356
What are you talking about?

794
01:00:40,691 --> 01:00:43,460
If you care for her,
you will hear me out.

795
01:00:43,494 --> 01:00:44,428
I'm a priest.

796
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,132
Why should I believe you?

797
01:00:49,299 --> 01:00:51,502
[Man] I fought
the enemy for years.

798
01:00:51,535 --> 01:00:52,403
The enemy?

799
01:00:52,436 --> 01:00:53,237
Evil.

800
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:56,140
It's not just a coincidence

801
01:00:56,173 --> 01:00:58,041
that I happened to
see these drawings.

802
01:01:00,511 --> 01:01:02,212
I've seen this picture before.

803
01:01:05,182 --> 01:01:07,084
This is not just a drawing.

804
01:01:07,117 --> 01:01:08,485
This is a demons face.

805
01:01:09,686 --> 01:01:11,388
One of the Devil's disciples.

806
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:15,959
The Devil creeps up on us
in many different ways.

807
01:01:18,162 --> 01:01:21,498
Through dark thoughts,
visions, dreams, nightmares.

808
01:01:24,735 --> 01:01:26,703
Tell me about this young girl.

809
01:01:30,207 --> 01:01:31,241
You must help her.

810
01:01:36,781 --> 01:01:39,483
They're still not answering.

811
01:01:43,387 --> 01:01:44,988
Why do you keep plastic fish?

812
01:01:47,024 --> 01:01:48,125
What?

813
01:01:48,158 --> 01:01:48,959
Your fish.

814
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,362
They're dead, soulless.

815
01:01:57,701 --> 01:01:59,403
Turn right, up ahead.

816
01:02:18,823 --> 01:02:21,525

824
01:02:57,528 --> 01:02:59,596
No, what the hell?

825
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:01,164
Cora.

01:03:03,433 --> 01:03:04,434
- Cora.
- Help!

828
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:06,670
It burns.

829
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,573
- It burns.
- You're okay, you're okay.

830
01:03:09,606 --> 01:03:11,441
- No, help, help.
- We're right here.

835
01:03:34,766 --> 01:03:35,599
Cora.

836
01:03:40,637 --> 01:03:41,672
Cora.

837
01:03:53,483 --> 01:03:55,686
[tense music]

838
01:04:12,736 --> 01:04:13,570
Cora?

839
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,174
Cora?

[creature growls]

841
01:04:21,712 --> 01:04:22,713
Oh!

844
01:04:31,288 --> 01:04:32,189
You okay?

[creature growls]

846
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:36,426
Cora, what are you?

847
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:37,294
Ah!

848
01:04:40,597 --> 01:04:42,466
I don't see her.

849
01:04:42,499 --> 01:04:43,768
Cora, Cora no!

850
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:45,202
[Jennifer] Stop it!

01:04:45,235 --> 01:04:47,772
[Derek grunting]

852
01:04:51,575 --> 01:04:53,343
Let go, Cora, let go.

[creature growling]

854
01:05:04,454 --> 01:05:05,656
Oh my God.

855
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:07,557
Leave me alone!
[Derek grunting]

856
01:05:07,591 --> 01:05:09,693
- Come on, come on.
- Put her down.

858
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:31,816
[Cora] Leave me alone.

Get her down, get her down.

01:05:51,702 --> 01:05:52,536
Help.

863
01:05:54,638 --> 01:05:56,373
[Jennifer] Cora,
it's mom and dad, Cora.

864
01:05:56,406 --> 01:05:57,875
[Derek] Help, help, come on.

[Father Andrey] Move, move.

866
01:05:58,742 --> 01:05:59,643
[Derek] What do we do?

867
01:05:59,676 --> 01:06:00,444
[Father Andrey] Hold her down.

868
01:06:00,477 --> 01:06:01,578
[Derek] I'm trying.

869
01:06:01,611 --> 01:06:02,446
Push.

870
01:06:05,515 --> 01:06:06,784
You.

871
01:06:06,818 --> 01:06:08,652
Drunk failure.

872
01:06:08,685 --> 01:06:10,955
Go back to London, throw
yourself off a bridge.

873
01:06:10,988 --> 01:06:12,723
Maybe it'll work this time.

874
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:16,493
Oh, look who's back.

875
01:06:16,526 --> 01:06:18,261
Why don't you go spend time
with your real daughter.

876
01:06:18,295 --> 01:06:21,698
Oh, that's right, you
can't, she's dead.

877
01:06:21,732 --> 01:06:22,867
Cora, please.

878
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:26,904
And who's fault
is that? [laughs]

879
01:06:26,938 --> 01:06:27,738
Shut up, mom.

880
01:06:27,772 --> 01:06:28,973
You God damn liar.

881
01:06:29,006 --> 01:06:30,540
Cora, stop.

882
01:06:30,574 --> 01:06:31,809
Get your hands off me.

883
01:06:31,843 --> 01:06:33,510
You're not my real father.

884
01:06:34,779 --> 01:06:36,680
Who are you?

885
01:06:36,713 --> 01:06:37,647
[demon laughs]

886
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:38,515
[Demon] Agrr.

887
01:06:38,548 --> 01:06:39,851
Is that your name?

888
01:06:39,884 --> 01:06:40,918
[Demon] Yeah.

889
01:06:43,553 --> 01:06:44,387
Cora.

890
01:06:46,723 --> 01:06:47,992
Oh, Cora.

891
01:06:48,025 --> 01:06:50,327
[sharp eerie music]

892
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,829
Do you have a daughter?

893
01:06:51,863 --> 01:06:52,662
What?

894
01:06:52,696 --> 01:06:53,931
A daughter.

895
01:06:53,965 --> 01:06:54,866
Do you have a daughter?

896
01:06:54,899 --> 01:06:57,902
Yes, but she died a long time.

897
01:06:57,935 --> 01:06:59,070
How did she know that?

898
01:06:59,103 --> 01:07:00,537
She knows about me, too.

899
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:01,705
What's happening to her?

900
01:07:01,738 --> 01:07:02,940
Is she gonna be okay?

901
01:07:03,975 --> 01:07:05,810
She has a fever, that's good.

902
01:07:05,843 --> 01:07:06,676
She's fighting.

903
01:07:11,748 --> 01:07:14,018
Take her to the bed
to get some rest,

904
01:07:14,051 --> 01:07:16,053
and get a cold compress
to cool her off.

905
01:07:16,087 --> 01:07:17,054
- Okay, I got her.
- Go quick.

906
01:07:17,088 --> 01:07:18,355
- I got her.
- Take her.

907
01:07:22,659 --> 01:07:24,394
[Jennifer crying]

908
01:07:24,427 --> 01:07:25,362
[Derek] Who is this guy.

909
01:07:25,395 --> 01:07:26,696
[Nina] A priest.

910
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:27,965
He knows what he's doing.

911
01:07:39,609 --> 01:07:40,443
Come on.

912
01:07:41,378 --> 01:07:43,014
Sit down, sit down.

913
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:45,715
She'll be okay.

01:07:59,396 --> 01:08:02,365
[haunting music]

915
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:09,472
How do you know him?

916
01:08:11,408 --> 01:08:12,043
I,

917
01:08:13,878 --> 01:08:14,644
we.

918
01:08:14,678 --> 01:08:16,113
This is Alexander.

919
01:08:16,147 --> 01:08:17,714
How do you know him?

920
01:08:18,648 --> 01:08:19,851
We.

921
01:08:19,884 --> 01:08:22,119
We don't have time
for this, tell me.

922
01:08:22,153 --> 01:08:22,987
He.

923
01:08:31,428 --> 01:08:32,797
Is Derek Cora's father?

924
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:34,832
Please don't tell Derek.

925
01:08:34,866 --> 01:08:36,801
It happened right before we met.

926
01:08:36,834 --> 01:08:37,902
I didn't want to tell him.

927
01:08:37,935 --> 01:08:39,436
I didn't want to lose him.

928
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:44,407
She's all right.
