THE QUEEN barbarian II
The Empress Strikes Back

3
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:08,076
~ 1990 ~

4
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:22,861
No!

5
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,596
No one will make me
lady.

6
00:01:25,615 --> 00:01:27,513
No! Daughter of King Alko.

7
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:30,584
Not going to show up
ahead in these bastards,

8
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,380
Anything less than
befitting a lady.

9
00:01:33,402 --> 00:01:36,918
If you want me there should be
to accept so as I am.

10
00:01:36,956 --> 00:01:39,518
And so as smelly!

11
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:44,339
You run away from the fire.
It's time to learn the protocol.

12
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:47,518
My only trouble you bring,
by little girl.

13
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:52,112
Now King is away and
Ankaris will make your life difficult

14
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,049
The King will come back.

15
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:58,071
And the daughter of the King will make his life
Ankaris very short.

16
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:00,636
Nampis!

17
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,940
Stay away from me.

18
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:14,938
You look beautiful Atheleia.

19
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:20,876
Have you heard from father Ankaris?

20
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:22,142
Unfortunately we have.

21
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:25,150
A battle took place at the border,
a week ago.

22
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:26,532
But we did not lose.

23
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:27,947
Never lose.

24
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:30,162
We won the battle.

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,861
But our beloved King
Alko lost.

26
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:39,909
True?

27
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:46,704
The power is mine now,
right? anyone disagree with that?

28
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,490
And spells the
protected.

29
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:56,055
The spell
protect the life of the King.

30
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:58,763
Wait at least until
bring his body here.

31
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:00,325
Kneel!

32
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:04,450
The Lord gave you a command.
This will be your guardian.

33
00:03:04,622 --> 00:03:06,536
The body of your father
not found.

34
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,687
Then there is proof
that is dead!

35
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:13,320
Ma'am... you are very persistent.

36
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,106
Father you confided your
the secret of the magic scepter,

37
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,966
To surrender,

38
00:03:19,997 --> 00:03:22,762
If something happens.

39
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:25,105
To finish the
skimming treasury

40
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:28,253
And change advisors
with your killers?

41
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:29,519
You would obey.

42
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,222
Until I see that the King is dead

43
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,042
I will not give away your
power.

44
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:38,226
You will see that I have enough
power to change your opinion.

45
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,948
Chofrax.

46
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:10,193
Treasurer!

47
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,998
I brought a little food.

48
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:18,553
Thanks.

49
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:22,037
I wondered if I had any friends left

50
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,240
I hate them.

51
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,761
The men do not understand
power.

52
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,507
They think that it is good to have
more and more.

53
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:36,281
You know the secret of
magic scepter.

54
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:39,265
Yes, but as my father is alive

55
00:04:39,273 --> 00:04:41,249
I can not use it.

56
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,687
You know, I heard them talking.

57
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:47,259
They think it's really dead.

58
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:50,202
If not though?

59
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:53,053
And use the power of the scepter

60
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:54,639
Wherever you are going to die.

61
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:59,194
No risk to betray
my father.

62
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:01,498
You can not just sit here
.

63
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:04,348
I do not have much choice.

64
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:09,012
My Good girl!

65
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:18,389
I'm ready to go out.
Please.

66
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:56,667
Let's get away
from your father.

67
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:11,481
<i>Trust the power of your
to the one daughter</i>

68
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,946
<i>Who held on
bygone times</i>

69
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:17,453
<i>The Trust me
that nobody can touch</i>

70
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,790
<i>Without the blessing of the female sex
.</i>

71
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:28,841
You have the power now?

72
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:31,731
No, there are still some
words.

73
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,990
The know?

74
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:36,825
Yes, but I'm afraid...

75
00:06:37,936 --> 00:06:39,311
For my father.

76
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,334
Chofrax!

77
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:45,568
You can not take the scepter with the
Chofrax violence. You know the power.

78
00:06:45,574 --> 00:06:48,840
Then used the
to stop me.

79
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:51,073
Are you afraid?

80
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,408
You think your
father is still alive,

81
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,961
And not sacrifice his life?

82
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:00,055
Then sacrificed yours.

83
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:02,657
Atheleia.

84
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,524
Well done my girl.

85
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,729
And now.... Kneel!

86
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:29,565
Having scepter
does not mean that you have the secret of power.

87
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:32,690
Remain the guardian of
you and you remain mortal.

88
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,664
Will you give me the secret.

89
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,461
Or you die.

90
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,055
My father said you will become my slave
if you bring the scepter.

91
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:46,774
And it will actually happen.

92
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:53,910
It's mine.

93
00:07:55,831 --> 00:07:57,238
Are not you?

94
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:00,675
You look so superior to everyone.

95
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:03,206
Kiss my foot.

96
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:09,188
I think your little daughter
become big queen one day.

97
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:12,384
And good husband with
suitable husband.

98
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:16,965
I told you I want to kiss my
the slave legs.

99
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:40,329
You can govern by force,

100
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,686
But the real power is not
will be yours ever.

101
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:45,983
Then that power will be sacrificed.

102
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:49,298
Why
secret will die with you.

103
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:56,021
Perhaps he is right my Lord

104
00:08:56,044 --> 00:09:00,162
Without the magic scepter of the
enemies can fight back.

105
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:02,310
I feed them with it.

106
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,302
Prepare the execution of Atheleias
with the first light the next day.

107
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:08,802
Promised that will become my slave.

108
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:10,390
We will find you another.

109
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:12,313
Orion!

110
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:15,272
You 're her fiancé
my daughter.

111
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:17,918
Show me the spouse
a day will share the throne.

112
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,088
You're good!

113
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:22,215
Not sure
that likes me!

114
00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:24,902
I'm not sure
likes anyone!

115
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:27,686
I always love!

116
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:34,030
You can be my King!
You could;

117
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:36,559
Not really
never thought.

118
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:39,041
One day I will become Queen
.

119
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:42,890
What if you want to marry me,
to be nice to me now.

120
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:44,968
Gladly!

121
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:46,742
My Queen!

122
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:13,820
Sprinkled!

123
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:57,544
Where do you come from?

124
00:11:58,224 --> 00:12:03,062
In chasing the men in your places!
You know what I mean!

125
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:10,157
There are others!

126
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,303
Better to go from here!

127
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,479
I can not lose to them.

128
00:12:20,154 --> 00:12:22,698
I never find gold
when someone knocks.

129
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:46,729
Really need to get out of here!

130
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:50,472
How waiting to doff
livelihood anyway.

131
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:15,319
This should be
a beautiful and peaceful forest.

132
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,684
But a few months ago
trouble come and go!

133
00:13:17,979 --> 00:13:19,205
Here you live?

134
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes!

135
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,046
I wish I could too!

136
00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:24,514
Will appreciate what you did not have.

137
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,005
What are you?

138
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:28,661
I'm Zielona!

139
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:31,848
My name is Atheleia.

140
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:34,004
A! One that hung in the morning!

141
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:36,703
The news travels fast!

142
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:39,356
Better to gallop faster!
Go!

143
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:55,572
It's very "lady" for
be useful to us.

144
00:13:55,612 --> 00:13:56,541
Just look at her!

145
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,934
When it's time
battle will see how useful I am.

146
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:05,935
Oh I would not want to spoil your
these beautiful clothes.

147
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:10,372
Fuck me!

148
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:17,021
Erigkina! It has already passed
a hard day.

149
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:19,965
Okay then, let the
pave the sheets.

150
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,011
I told you.
Leave me!

151
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:58,712
Yes Erigkina. Hit it!

152
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,377
Father!

153
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:05,527
Father!

154
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,365
Bring back!

155
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:14,111
Let go!
Do you want me.

156
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,871
We do!

157
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:29,658
You do not need to go immediately back
.

158
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,572
Come on, do not do nasty
.

159
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,984
... Come party like a man.

160
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,386
Ballas!

161
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:09,051
At last we caught one of them
damned rebels.

162
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:11,498
Flew t 'your weapon.

163
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:13,561
Let her go.

164
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:14,647
Grasp.

165
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:16,710
I will not try, even.

166
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:24,053
You really think that two of you
, can stop us?

167
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:37,944
You .

168
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:40,662
Betrays your royal blood.

169
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:44,394
You want to pour the
my royal blood.

170
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:47,230
Now let's see what
color is yours.

171
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:49,898
You ...

172
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:54,197
... You're a fugitive from
royal execution order.

173
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:59,769
Surrender now... and
regret their "friend you".

174
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,446
I do not think like you.

175
00:18:03,877 --> 00:18:06,657
Flew t 'your weapons.
Old-rebels.

176
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:15,152
Chase them.

177
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,605
We have an army of our own.

178
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:40,923
An army of
people who lost loved ones,

179
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:42,919
Them stole their crops,

180
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:45,000
That got them their children,

181
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:46,303
Or worse

182
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:51,232
We had a King who ruled
fair, even the poor knew.

183
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,501
The justice was on our side.

184
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:57,982
If you need a leader to your
convince, then I learn to lead.

185
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:01,754
If this requires a stronger army then
,

186
00:19:01,778 --> 00:19:03,275
I'll find the strength.

187
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:06,893
But I'll make a promise.

188
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:10,340
We will win!

189
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:12,306
Yes! We!

190
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,040
Atheleia!

191
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,766
So in
chased a handful of women.

192
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:32,972
I will go tomorrow with several men,

193
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:35,461
To clean the
forest for good.

194
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:37,363
If the find.

195
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:40,356
You are welcome to
to admire!

196
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:44,537
I doubt be helpful.
He always won in fencing.

197
00:19:44,728 --> 00:19:46,966
My portion dislikes.

198
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:49,560
Give me yours, Orion.

199
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:05,549
Finish your food,

200
00:20:07,487 --> 00:20:08,869
Gave it to me.

201
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:13,260
Do not fidget, otherwise
I will never marry.

202
00:20:18,422 --> 00:20:20,515
I will come with you tomorrow.

203
00:20:21,044 --> 00:20:22,208
My Lord .

204
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:26,574
In two days we will not stay
one rebel alive.

205
00:20:56,224 --> 00:21:00,009
I did not know that aimed
someone else.

206
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:04,091
But I killed it.

207
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:12,677
Where you think you going?

208
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:18,740
Wait! Wait!

209
00:21:20,002 --> 00:21:22,723
There are dozens of people to be fed.

210
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,284
You are welcome to share with us
.

211
00:21:28,868 --> 00:21:29,992
How to say?

212
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:34,702
You can not speak?

213
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:41,977
Soldiers.

214
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:47,154
And now you are hiding here.

215
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:50,857
All alone?

216
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:56,054
There are others
share your match...

217
00:21:57,804 --> 00:22:00,250
And welcome lunch.

218
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,316
You know what did the nobles
and to my own?

219
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,504
They killed!

220
00:22:16,723 --> 00:22:18,174
Glad to escape.

221
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:21,329
I did so
took my father.

222
00:22:21,447 --> 00:22:23,689
Tortured him to death.

223
00:22:24,073 --> 00:22:26,510
It's time to pay.

224
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:30,650
Glad I leave this place.

225
00:22:30,688 --> 00:22:35,641
I wish I could go with you
and killed out there.

226
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:36,855
Thee Nampis?

227
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:38,231
Who did you hurt?

228
00:22:38,277 --> 00:22:40,246
I 'find someone.

229
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,697
If this child
become queen,

230
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:44,941
Not want to see it.

231
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:48,137
You know how to say now?

232
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:50,348
Old goat-midwife!

233
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,848
Sure grew.

234
00:22:53,145 --> 00:22:55,942
You must first crawl
her legs.

235
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,775
Just have the crown in the hands of my
be waiting below.

236
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,366
I do not know what the King

237
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:05,326
And does not turn back on
to marry the Atheleia.

238
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:06,936
She would not ever marry!

239
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,426
Her I'd ask...

240
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:10,983
... Many times.

241
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:14,926
It's too late now.

242
00:23:23,672 --> 00:23:25,445
Old goat-midwife!

243
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:11,190
The company is ready.

244
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:11,963
Nice.

245
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:15,173
Do the rebels to
walking faster.

246
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:19,569
Good afternoon, my Lords.

247
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:30,820
I see you keep a big company!

248
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,972
If you like both,

249
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:36,269
Then you are welcome to follow.

250
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:39,345
I used to think to ask them if they want to
to follow them.

251
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:43,746
This is the last thing
would ask anyone!

252
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:23,405
I'll never get used!

253
00:25:26,835 --> 00:25:28,335
Do not kill him!

254
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:31,563
I made a mistake?

255
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:33,821
Cuff him!

256
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:43,595
To tie him? I have never
xanadesei anyone.

257
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:46,426
Why tell me
do these things.

258
00:26:56,537 --> 00:26:58,005
Get in!

259
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,625
It's gorgeous!

260
00:27:46,657 --> 00:27:51,295
Do not you dare touch
with your bloodstained hands.

261
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,445
No.

262
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:14,366
Take my cape off
of these vromopaida.

263
00:28:14,382 --> 00:28:16,898
Not give you orders here.

264
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:21,460
Why simply not to kill?

265
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,991
Be finish.

266
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,808
I do not intend to kill.

267
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,904
Do not like those
get your fortune?

268
00:28:29,936 --> 00:28:34,793
I will punish you as you did
with these poor farmers.

269
00:28:35,441 --> 00:28:38,285
Perhaps I
I cut your hands.

270
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:41,261
Would not dare.

271
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:43,270
No.

272
00:28:43,911 --> 00:28:47,200
Thinking that there are better ways of punishment.

273
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:49,973
Why so afraid of women?

274
00:28:50,252 --> 00:28:52,978
I fear nothing!

275
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,705
Women are a waste of time.

276
00:28:57,591 --> 00:29:00,404
But, you have so much time now.

277
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:12,516
All have their Achilles heel.

278
00:29:12,532 --> 00:29:15,904
One night with me
may have been your end

279
00:29:15,918 --> 00:29:18,568
You do not have even destroyed.

280
00:29:19,045 --> 00:29:21,248
But now that I know.

281
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:35,920
What are you doing out here?
Food to throw away.

282
00:29:35,944 --> 00:29:38,238
Only villagers
to hang out.

283
00:29:39,113 --> 00:29:42,418
Best of friends I
you did last.

284
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:45,660
What is your favorite
little princess?

285
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:47,440
You know what I want.

286
00:29:47,456 --> 00:29:50,524
And I know what I will do once I get
throne.

287
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:55,328
And to get him would be
as chilly as you are now?

288
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:58,420
And you...
... with your army.

289
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:01,340
Born in power.

290
00:30:01,386 --> 00:30:03,447
Not need it like you.

291
00:30:03,463 --> 00:30:07,869
No! Just
camp in the countryside for recreation.

292
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:10,478
For them!

293
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:15,481
You know how they live Orion?

294
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:17,081
A little food on their table

295
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,379
Few rags to keep warm
their children.

296
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,968
Knowing the future they have.

297
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:26,750
Life is already hard enough for them
no one like you.

298
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,287
I too am a man.

299
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:31,320
Every day less.

300
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:34,462
I learned something here, Orion.

301
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,720
That my life is more valuable than
others.

302
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,253
Do not you see that?
Is not that right;

303
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:53,514
It was the power in only
seeking.

304
00:30:54,989 --> 00:31:00,638
I gave up long ago
believing that you do not love.

305
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:04,493
I thought it would
claimed forever.

306
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:08,118
I have to do with the logic
now.

307
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:13,244
I remember that
were very reasonable.

308
00:32:53,684 --> 00:32:58,199
Let us return you something
old Chofrax!

309
00:33:38,836 --> 00:33:41,203
I wish you a good return.

310
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:43,914
And Convey my respect
to Ankaris.

311
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,156
Kill!

312
00:33:46,618 --> 00:33:47,615
No!

313
00:33:47,615 --> 00:33:51,514
Now Ankaris will see that we are
strong enough to put...

314
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,670
... The "bravest".

315
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:56,856
And a warning, not
other slave caravans.

316
00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:59,853
Otherwise the next time the
loop will be more firm.

317
00:33:59,877 --> 00:34:01,921
There will be some more time.

318
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,674
And when he comes,

319
00:34:03,703 --> 00:34:06,438
Loop is
around your neck.

320
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:07,875
Ethmpek!

321
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:34,385
It loons!

322
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:35,854
Peasants!

323
00:34:36,871 --> 00:34:41,254
Were peasants who waited
but we found an army.

324
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:45,595
And your own army massacred
from villagers and a girl.

325
00:34:45,608 --> 00:34:47,999
Girls
more loudly than you think.

326
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,763
It is possible to think
that at the end will win?

327
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,065
If you want to know what you think...
... ask him.

328
00:34:55,213 --> 00:34:58,553
He is
strolled with her in the forest.

329
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:05,101
When you hostage strolled
when they tell you to lounge about.

330
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:10,426
Honestly believes that the villagers
is as good as we do.

331
00:35:10,452 --> 00:35:15,718
Let's see if close enough
to take in the trap.

332
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:20,937
When you hang loved
of villagers in the square.

333
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:23,967
Hanging innocent people?

334
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:26,381
Villagers not people.

335
00:35:26,412 --> 00:35:29,569
Or is soulatso together
changed your minds?

336
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,067
You know my devotion
my Lord.

337
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:32,916
Course.

338
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:39,885
And to be rewarded for it
will lead the first run.

339
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,432
And you?

340
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,487
...

341
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:48,597
... I will erect
trap Atheleia.

342
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:58,752
Why? What have we done;

343
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:00,392
Enough!

344
00:36:00,704 --> 00:36:02,240
We did not do anything.

345
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:10,084
And to prevailing when you were a baby.

346
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:12,087
And Atheleia well.

347
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:17,118
The Ankaris
thinks he can help her.

348
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:19,798
Calmly with it!

349
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,245
- You will not come.
- You come.

350
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:30,787
My stomach
dies of anguish.

351
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:52,057
And if you do not come?

352
00:36:54,136 --> 00:36:56,143
Come!

353
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:13,260
Came!

354
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:17,619
Seal the gates!

355
00:37:47,771 --> 00:37:51,610
What if there are other nuns here
and ask us what we are?

356
00:37:51,642 --> 00:37:54,363
Just say "bless"
and go!

357
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:56,079
Bless!

358
00:37:57,177 --> 00:37:58,286
Bless!

359
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,847
We came to bless
death row.

360
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:35,440
We came from very far away.

361
00:38:37,144 --> 00:38:40,477
The nuns want to bless
prisoners.

362
00:38:45,512 --> 00:38:47,168
Let the pass.

363
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,648
You came in very dangerous
part, Sister.

364
00:38:59,758 --> 00:39:04,359
The risk does not employ those
serve a higher purpose.

365
00:39:04,438 --> 00:39:05,398
Sister!

366
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:07,654
Sister!

367
00:39:09,811 --> 00:39:12,260
You can bless
my sword?

368
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,449
Sister!

369
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:20,067
He wants to bless his sword.

370
00:39:20,146 --> 00:39:22,175
Bless on it, then.

371
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,573
May...

372
00:39:28,596 --> 00:39:31,150
May this sword...

373
00:39:32,174 --> 00:39:35,197
Do not pray for them
the old souls Sister.

374
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:38,795
Pray for the poor
to live...

375
00:39:39,147 --> 00:39:41,553
Do not say anything my son.

376
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:52,069
May this sword
become...

377
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:54,520
Remember the blessing Sister?

378
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:02,135
I can not bless
in the hands of a soldier.

379
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:06,851
May the sword beating
only freedom.

380
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,848
What kind of blessing is this?

381
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:18,589
Grasp!

382
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:15,193
Let's get out of here.

383
00:41:31,774 --> 00:41:34,274
Do not worry about me
turn the camp.

384
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:35,695
So you say?

385
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:25,810
Ethmpek no!
We can not lose you!

386
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:40,507
I told you that
will meet again.

387
00:42:46,173 --> 00:42:48,954
You can slept well.

388
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,623
They do not torment
guilt at nights.

389
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,558
Always impressed,

390
00:42:58,582 --> 00:43:02,230
They found on the wrong side
blame others

391
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,800
That they are guilty.

392
00:43:08,392 --> 00:43:11,681
I'm sure you want to
open your eyes

393
00:43:11,713 --> 00:43:13,908
And see what happens to you.

394
00:43:26,836 --> 00:43:29,961
So that you decided
to win a woman.

395
00:43:30,578 --> 00:43:33,486
I guess this is my chance

396
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:36,338
To repay your grace

397
00:43:36,987 --> 00:43:41,752
And to see bare
from your dignity.

398
00:43:46,203 --> 00:43:50,407
Oh! How beautiful
disgusting spectacle!

399
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:09,083
My father said that
I track.

400
00:44:11,302 --> 00:44:12,606
Course.

401
00:44:15,312 --> 00:44:17,444
You will hurt much?

402
00:44:18,054 --> 00:44:20,571
There is
pain kneeling them.

403
00:44:20,952 --> 00:44:22,124
It's fear.

404
00:44:23,003 --> 00:44:26,542
Knowing how is absolutely helpless.

405
00:44:32,726 --> 00:44:35,334
Are you helpless?
Is not that right;

406
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:38,819
Can I ask you
that pleases me.

407
00:44:38,858 --> 00:44:41,516
And thou
you can not do anything.

408
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,339
I like this
when I become Queen.

409
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:49,758
You would never become Queen.

410
00:44:49,823 --> 00:44:52,354
You better tell us
for the scepter now.

411
00:44:52,386 --> 00:44:53,610
Kantin speak.

412
00:45:10,242 --> 00:45:12,515
This looks wonderful inconvenient.

413
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:16,343
Is not Atheleia?

414
00:45:17,162 --> 00:45:18,513
It is very inconvenient?

415
00:45:23,173 --> 00:45:24,738
Old spoke then.

416
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:27,313
'll Talk again.

417
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,664
Very soon.

418
00:45:39,168 --> 00:45:43,589
Now you want to tell us,
Atheleia is not it?

419
00:45:45,312 --> 00:45:46,710
Tell us.

420
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,298
Tell us the scepter.

421
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:54,164
Please Atheleia,
not want to happen to you something.

422
00:45:56,758 --> 00:46:00,279
May need a little more persuasion.

423
00:46:10,172 --> 00:46:13,228
About falls so every time.

424
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:18,636
Say about three more times
and will become extremely more inconvenient,

425
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:21,198
Than it is now.

426
00:46:23,558 --> 00:46:28,003
We'll let Atheleia
to think about what you want to tell us.

427
00:46:28,189 --> 00:46:32,999
Before
pull this lever three times.

428
00:46:35,046 --> 00:46:37,957
Come treasurer, we have dinner.

429
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:42,621
Come treasurer.

430
00:46:49,818 --> 00:46:54,441
It is possible, my Lord,
but I am stronger.

431
00:46:54,472 --> 00:46:56,688
Suffers too.

432
00:46:56,768 --> 00:47:00,797
Take care so as not to die before
to tell us everything.

433
00:47:00,835 --> 00:47:01,795
Okay!

434
00:47:01,835 --> 00:47:05,231
We know what
want a couple of days.

435
00:47:05,259 --> 00:47:09,889
But I have no intention to kill
either now or later.

436
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,045
No.

437
00:47:11,085 --> 00:47:16,534
Will continue my
pays for too long!

438
00:48:46,928 --> 00:48:49,089
Orion the Atheleia runs away.

439
00:48:51,973 --> 00:48:55,842
I wish I had not trusted
never secret.

440
00:49:04,283 --> 00:49:08,576
Father, give me a sign
if you're alive or dead.

441
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:10,470
Very touching

442
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:14,815
Do you really believe that?

443
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,776
What are you doing?

444
00:49:25,669 --> 00:49:26,833
Get.

445
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:44,460
If you are afraid to save yourself
with the scepter,

446
00:49:44,496 --> 00:49:48,199
Then you definitely will not give
his secret to us.

447
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:51,353
So the Ankaris
will not hesitate...

448
00:49:51,377 --> 00:49:54,907
... Give me leave
to kill you.

449
00:49:56,623 --> 00:49:59,774
I intend to do it very slowly.

450
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:04,848
The scepter
secret should remain a secret.

451
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:09,605
Someday someone will come
stop you.

452
00:50:10,261 --> 00:50:12,956
Who?
Someone you tangible rebels?

453
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:18,087
My soldiers will march
an hour to hunt them.

454
00:50:19,908 --> 00:50:22,374
Seems not to care.

455
00:50:22,648 --> 00:50:26,997
But you at least
wish him good luck in Orion.

456
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,211
Who will lead
enterprise.

457
00:50:30,237 --> 00:50:34,799
Much like
impatient to prove himself.

458
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:42,345
Where were you last night?

459
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,976
Where?... Here!

460
00:50:44,756 --> 00:50:48,044
I came in looking for.
The Atheleia escaped.

461
00:50:48,107 --> 00:50:49,276
I heard.

462
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:52,046
It was when I went out to walk a little
,

463
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,787
Over the ramparts.

464
00:50:53,844 --> 00:50:55,742
You go there often?

465
00:50:56,755 --> 00:51:00,185
I will come to walk
together overnight.

466
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:03,385
I have nothing to do when
miss.

467
00:51:04,841 --> 00:51:06,020
Where are you going?

468
00:51:06,394 --> 00:51:08,321
I go to the rebels!

469
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,954
Do not go!

470
00:51:10,376 --> 00:51:12,555
Keep my little companion.

471
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:16,534
Out there is the last
place I wanted to be.

472
00:51:16,547 --> 00:51:18,758
But I have orders to go to
Chofrax.

473
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:23,490
So simply I would tell my father
give you other orders.

474
00:51:26,218 --> 00:51:27,725
Give me a kiss.

475
00:51:36,032 --> 00:51:41,360
Stay at known path and
find yourself directly in the camp.

476
00:51:41,363 --> 00:51:43,040
We will find them, sir.

477
00:52:11,232 --> 00:52:11,973
Treasurer?

478
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,673
Your father told me
that will find you here.

479
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,624
There are spiders in here.

480
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:26,184
Is poisonous?

481
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,199
I do not know.

482
00:52:28,237 --> 00:52:31,566
I was thinking of the
put on her.

483
00:52:31,697 --> 00:52:37,964
Do not be afraid not to lose any, not after
know what room it goes.

484
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,440
Okay then!

485
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,646
I kinda hungry
anyway

486
00:52:53,647 --> 00:52:55,742
You are so weak.

487
00:53:01,027 --> 00:53:02,050
Come!

488
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,303
The last time
saw the royal escort,

489
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:14,928
Was just
30 km away from our castle.

490
00:53:14,928 --> 00:53:16,904
To reread your message?

491
00:53:16,928 --> 00:53:17,676
No

492
00:53:19,058 --> 00:53:21,917
If the King has come back...

493
00:53:22,464 --> 00:53:25,070
The
Atheleia not know this yet.

494
00:53:26,211 --> 00:53:29,851
Maybe I can convince her
tell us the secret.

495
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:34,534
Sure, bold servant
Lady Treasurer will succeed,

496
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,240
More than me.

497
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:38,193
Let him try!

498
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,139
- I want to see.
- No.

499
00:53:40,178 --> 00:53:41,842
What do you mean, no?

500
00:53:41,871 --> 00:53:43,880
This should
do it myself.

501
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,301
Please forgive me.

502
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:34,197
I swear on my life that...

503
00:54:34,776 --> 00:54:37,066
Will leave this castle now.

504
00:54:37,121 --> 00:54:39,035
Or will die here together!

505
00:54:42,289 --> 00:54:44,569
That sounds like a plan.

506
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,506
Orion!

507
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,220
Father! Father! Father!

508
00:55:15,403 --> 00:55:17,059
Oh! Megalodyname...

509
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:29,741
Note.

510
00:55:40,596 --> 00:55:43,306
Oh my God.
On the bed please.

511
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,085
Carefully Oh!

512
00:55:53,029 --> 00:55:54,702
Out! Outside! Outside!

513
00:55:54,933 --> 00:55:58,334
The took care of baby,
I can do it again.

514
00:56:00,254 --> 00:56:01,285
Where are you?

515
00:56:07,844 --> 00:56:09,130
It will be well?

516
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:10,849
I do not know.

517
00:56:12,525 --> 00:56:13,821
It's possible.

518
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,806
Always be possible.

519
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,433
We did not find any trace of them, my Lord
.

520
00:56:27,448 --> 00:56:30,724
Looked where I told you
the Orion to look.

521
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:33,805
It's one of those stupid!

522
00:56:33,834 --> 00:56:38,363
We dash immediately.
This time will follow me.

523
00:56:55,294 --> 00:56:57,658
I will bring him back, my child
.

524
00:56:57,682 --> 00:56:59,439
I do not want him back.

525
00:57:01,908 --> 00:57:05,396
On this
want because you want to be with her.

526
00:57:05,431 --> 00:57:07,493
Never loved me.

527
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,559
Well of course she loves.

528
00:57:11,466 --> 00:57:13,606
I wish I was dead!

529
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:31,672
Sure I wish you were dead.

530
00:57:56,568 --> 00:58:01,293
The father believes
I want power.

531
00:58:03,168 --> 00:58:04,620
But wrong.

532
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:07,142
Is yours.

533
00:58:07,171 --> 00:58:11,352
You said will you give me
just growing up.

534
00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:14,652
I have grown enough now.

535
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:17,638
Please, Mother!

536
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,312
Let me.

537
00:58:23,992 --> 00:58:26,152
Let this be the day.

538
00:58:32,084 --> 00:58:34,433
<i>Trust your strength</i>

539
00:58:34,448 --> 00:58:36,597
<i>To that daughter</i>

540
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:40,220
<i>The
held in bygone times.</i>

541
00:58:41,922 --> 00:58:44,063
<i>The Trust in me</i>

542
00:58:44,072 --> 00:58:46,680
<i>That nobody can touch</i>

543
00:58:46,938 --> 00:58:50,447
<i>Without the blessing of the female sex
.</i>

544
00:58:54,725 --> 00:58:56,840
<i>Use your power.</i>

545
00:58:56,856 --> 00:58:59,551
<i>To do with a woman</i>

546
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:02,753
<i>Worthy of your majesty</i>

547
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:08,064
Please, Mother!

548
00:59:09,272 --> 00:59:12,342
I want him back or I want him dead.

549
00:59:17,273 --> 00:59:19,800
<i>Use your power.</i>

550
00:59:20,186 --> 00:59:22,597
<i>To do with the woman</i>

551
00:59:26,018 --> 00:59:29,047
<i>That will fulfill your destiny.</i>

552
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,100
Zielona! Zielona!

553
00:59:48,115 --> 00:59:51,022
Soldiers, I saw them in the woods.

554
00:59:51,069 --> 00:59:52,654
Stay here.
Where are the others?

555
00:59:52,686 --> 00:59:54,131
Ethmpek, come!

556
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:04,744
You're safe.

557
01:00:04,885 --> 01:00:05,979
You're safe.

558
01:00:07,336 --> 01:00:09,073
You, you're here.

559
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:12,366
I will be where you.

560
01:00:12,382 --> 01:00:13,350
Always.

561
01:00:19,585 --> 01:00:21,327
Oh My Lady!

562
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:24,718
Thank God!
My Lady!

563
01:00:24,744 --> 01:00:26,424
Oh My Lady!

564
01:00:26,483 --> 01:00:29,366
It is very weak, a little
food will help.

565
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:32,608
You do not need to tell me
how to do my job

566
01:00:32,647 --> 01:00:36,957
But not with these dirty
pigs are out there.

567
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:37,973
Not my Lady!

568
01:00:37,997 --> 01:00:43,362
I
a delicious breakfast will prepare you with my hands.

569
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,127
You just wait,
right here.

570
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:53,567
Well what do you expect?
You need food,

571
01:00:53,885 --> 01:00:56,510
Little peace and quiet.

572
01:00:56,557 --> 01:00:58,938
Open now open!
Go! Come on!

573
01:01:00,492 --> 01:01:01,398
The Nampis!

574
01:01:01,461 --> 01:01:03,289
But He's right, you know.

575
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:06,686
The reports say that King
turns. You have to rest.

576
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,650
- Rested enough.
- Not enough.

577
01:01:13,575 --> 01:01:14,731
I was wrong.

578
01:01:16,653 --> 01:01:21,122
Love is the greatest
strength than anything else.

579
01:01:22,172 --> 01:01:24,876
Now it seems to be happening.

580
01:01:26,441 --> 01:01:29,730
And I was the only
I wanted everything.

581
01:01:29,753 --> 01:01:31,393
Rest my love.

582
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,034
Rest.

583
01:01:35,095 --> 01:01:37,784
I see that you become better Atheleia
!

584
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:39,444
Thanks Nokia.

585
01:01:42,936 --> 01:01:46,011
I'll see what it is.
I guard now.

586
01:02:13,782 --> 01:02:15,498
The King turned...

587
01:02:16,424 --> 01:02:17,436
... Dead.

588
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:22,279
In
brought back to be buried in his homeland.

589
01:02:22,294 --> 01:02:25,361
Only not
own longer.

590
01:02:25,597 --> 01:02:29,901
As far counted
lost the homecoming.

591
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,841
Die quickly?

592
01:02:33,491 --> 01:02:35,110
And brave.

593
01:02:35,694 --> 01:02:37,560
Your Majesty!

594
01:02:57,401 --> 01:02:59,651
He buried on his own soil.

595
01:02:59,713 --> 01:03:01,701
Bring me body.

596
01:03:01,836 --> 01:03:05,312
Send message
then everyone everywhere.

597
01:03:05,687 --> 01:03:07,882
To gather all here tonight.

598
01:03:08,462 --> 01:03:10,572
It's time to fight!

599
01:03:10,596 --> 01:03:12,384
You are not strong enough.

600
01:03:12,406 --> 01:03:16,109
We waited the day you turned
King and now it!

601
01:03:16,703 --> 01:03:19,863
This will give us the
strength to defeat his enemies.

602
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:23,145
Now I'm free to use
the power of the scepter.

603
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:27,485
- In a few days...
- In a few days I will be dead.

604
01:03:29,454 --> 01:03:33,919
Anyone scepter
can not be killed by human hand.

605
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:38,996
It was the human hand that freed
the spider with poisoned.

606
01:03:39,004 --> 01:03:41,770
The scepter is
my only salvation.

607
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:43,317
Going to live!

608
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:46,634
All are to live free!

609
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,353
So it will gather
10,000 swords.

610
01:03:51,081 --> 01:03:53,095
We attack at dawn!

611
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:54,609
Yes! Ask!

612
01:04:02,822 --> 01:04:07,069
What do you mean you can not find it,
it is only a little girl.

613
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:10,782
You are not worthy to find
a little girl.

614
01:04:10,807 --> 01:04:12,416
Treasurer!

615
01:04:12,578 --> 01:04:13,477
Treasurer!

616
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:16,344
This is no time for games.

617
01:04:20,163 --> 01:04:22,270
Why everyone follow me?

618
01:04:22,716 --> 01:04:24,574
Do not follow me.

619
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:26,520
Find!

620
01:04:27,487 --> 01:04:28,807
Treasurer!

621
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:31,784
Treasurer!

622
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:33,109
Taaamis!

623
01:04:44,973 --> 01:04:47,830
Our army is
strongest ever.

624
01:04:47,872 --> 01:04:50,651
Coming
warriors from all parts of the province,

625
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:52,719
Help our cause.

626
01:04:53,141 --> 01:04:56,445
The most important is to
get inside the castle.

627
01:04:56,930 --> 01:05:01,095
Some of us will die,
must be sacrificed.

628
01:05:01,751 --> 01:05:05,018
But the victory would mean
freedom for us all.

629
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:06,737
Yes! Ask!

630
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:38,995
... Sorry...

631
01:05:43,184 --> 01:05:44,766
What happens?

632
01:05:44,822 --> 01:05:47,747
Is fever of
spider venom.

01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:50,973
Keep cool until the
to fetch some water.

634
01:05:51,012 --> 01:05:52,402
You're unique.

<i>... Your strength...</i>

<i>... Trust the...</i>

637
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,130
<i>... One man did not touch...</i>

638
01:06:07,131 --> 01:06:08,466
Atheleia?

639
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,693
<i>... Without the blessing...</i>

640
01:06:11,896 --> 01:06:13,545
<i>... The female sex...</i>

641
01:06:13,576 --> 01:06:17,091
Atheleia, something magical happens
I think you should see this

642
01:06:17,128 --> 01:06:18,576
... Hold me now...

643
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:21,308
<i>Scepter wins</i>

644
01:06:22,676 --> 01:06:24,613
<i>Scepter wins</i>

645
01:06:25,601 --> 01:06:27,367
<i>And grasps the power</i>

646
01:06:27,742 --> 01:06:29,812
<i>For whoever reigns.</i>

647
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:47,605
Who's there?

648
01:06:48,487 --> 01:06:50,143
Hey Nampis.

649
01:06:54,321 --> 01:06:55,545
Not to know you.

650
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:57,896
What are you doing in this scene?

651
01:06:58,452 --> 01:07:01,664
It is the scene of Orion.
Is not that right;

652
01:07:03,537 --> 01:07:07,216
Whatever you're not
you have no business there.

653
01:07:07,832 --> 01:07:09,026
Yet I have.

654
01:07:09,482 --> 01:07:11,779
I can do what I want now!

655
01:07:13,591 --> 01:07:15,309
What are you?

656
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:19,064
You do not need to tell you.

657
01:07:19,945 --> 01:07:22,257
Old goat-midwife!

658
01:08:12,744 --> 01:08:13,947
What do you want?

659
01:08:14,728 --> 01:08:17,439
Just know the secret.

660
01:08:17,778 --> 01:08:19,285
What secret?

661
01:08:20,028 --> 01:08:21,090
His scepter.

662
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,538
What are you?

663
01:08:24,069 --> 01:08:27,062
Let me must go
to the castle now.

664
01:08:28,929 --> 01:08:30,960
The know those eyes.

665
01:08:31,327 --> 01:08:35,225
Now I will become Queen and
after you marry.

666
01:08:37,962 --> 01:08:39,087
Kiss me!

667
01:08:44,623 --> 01:08:45,575
You ?

668
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:47,122
But how?

669
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:49,542
I will not let you to have!

670
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:54,790
Went to kill me.

671
01:08:55,948 --> 01:08:57,617
Save the Nampis!

672
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:00,156
What is this?

673
01:09:00,389 --> 01:09:03,381
Who understands
such magic.

674
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,293
You know what?

675
01:09:06,584 --> 01:09:07,896
The cashiers.

676
01:09:13,591 --> 01:09:15,560
I will tell my father.

677
01:09:15,578 --> 01:09:17,542
If you recognize what you are.

678
01:09:17,581 --> 01:09:19,706
Course will recognize me!

679
01:09:19,746 --> 01:09:21,683
While you stand with
with the rebels?

680
01:09:21,705 --> 01:09:23,165
Would not dare!

681
01:09:23,935 --> 01:09:24,635
Ethmpek!

682
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:28,101
Change of clothes and
valtin on a horse.

683
01:09:28,174 --> 01:09:31,562
Think it over Atheleia!
You will regret this!

01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:35,437
When I become Queen will
to hang from the...

685
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:41,275

- Let's say it in Ethmpek.

686
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,478
Is everything ready?

687
01:09:44,494 --> 01:09:45,991

Ride!

690
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:35,496
What do you have here?

Transfer the body
King Alko,

692
01:10:37,598 --> 01:10:39,313
Who died in battle.

693
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:41,671
Did you hear the news?

694
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:44,007
I want to see the
my own eyes.

695
01:10:48,372 --> 01:10:50,753
You claim that this is the Alko.

696
01:10:56,755 --> 01:10:57,775
It is indeed!

697
01:10:58,218 --> 01:10:59,983
Your Majesty!

698
01:11:01,575 --> 01:11:03,028
Open the gates!

699
01:11:15,409 --> 01:11:16,853
Coming knights!

700
01:11:22,443 --> 01:11:23,259
Get them!

701
01:11:42,603 --> 01:11:44,384
Father! Father!

702
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:23,765
Help me!

703
01:12:25,502 --> 01:12:27,611
We need to get the scepter.

704
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:53,032
A front, go
not waste time.

705
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,073
Will do training
the traitor.

706
01:12:57,179 --> 01:12:58,809
Practiced enough?

707
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:16,200
Continued!

708
01:13:57,591 --> 01:13:58,794
What shame?

709
01:13:58,841 --> 01:14:04,334
To come so close to the scepter,
only to die.

710
01:14:05,123 --> 01:14:09,534
I write in your grave
that killed woman.

711
01:14:09,631 --> 01:14:15,071
You will be dust in your grave before you
read my tombstone.

712
01:14:21,155 --> 01:14:21,855
Attack!

713
01:14:25,487 --> 01:14:26,187
No!

714
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,232
Father!

715
01:14:40,895 --> 01:14:42,175
Father?

716
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:46,915
What are you, that
call me Father?

717
01:14:47,118 --> 01:14:50,814
I came here to give you the power of
scepter.

718
01:14:59,627 --> 01:15:00,452
Treasurer?

719
01:15:01,547 --> 01:15:02,656
Father!

720
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,833
Treasurer!

721
01:15:11,759 --> 01:15:14,688
Taaamis

722
01:15:26,706 --> 01:15:28,352
So soon.

723
01:15:29,032 --> 01:15:33,711
"We all
our Achilles' heel."

724
01:16:15,257 --> 01:16:16,359
Ankaris?

725
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,765
Was always the magic that held
rulers in power.

726
01:17:08,796 --> 01:17:11,051
Instead of thanks
those who govern.

727
01:17:11,106 --> 01:17:13,547
But this is the real magic
.

728
01:17:13,571 --> 01:17:17,178
When people trust the
life of someone else.

729
01:17:17,202 --> 01:17:22,806
This is the magic that govern
this kingdom now and then!

730
01:17:22,963 --> 01:17:24,283
Yes! Ask!

731
