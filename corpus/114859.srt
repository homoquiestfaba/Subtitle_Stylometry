00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:54,112
<i>Los Angeles Tower,</i>
<i>this is Transworld 22 Heavy.</i>

2
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:57,745
<i>We are going down!</i>
<i>Repeat, engines two and...</i>

3
00:00:57,855 --> 00:00:59,846
<i>L.A. Tower, this is...</i>

4
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:02,050
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

5
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,286
<i>22 Heavy, pull up! Pull up!</i>

6
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,318
Andrew,
this is your father.

7
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:13,396
Hello?

8
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:19,058
Look, you don't call me back,
so I don't know how to do this.

9
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:23,338
If you're not gonna
return my calls...

10
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,170
then there's no way
for us to communicate...

11
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,372
<i>Look, I don't know</i>
<i>how to do this...</i>

12
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:33,416
<i>but you're gonna need</i>
<i>to come home now.</i>

13
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:36,179
<i>Last night...</i>

14
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:38,187
<i>Your mother died</i>
<i>last night, Andrew.</i>

15
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:40,883
<i>She drowned.</i>

16
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,423
<i>Last night,</i>
<i>she drowned in the bath.</i>

17
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:46,789
Ten résumés just today.

18
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:49,621
They come in every day
from Idaho or Milwaukee or Florida.

19
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:53,356
And you know what they want even more than
a guest spot on <i>Everybody Loves Raymond?</i>

20
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:56,524
They want your job. This cannot happen again.
This will never happen again.

21
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:58,761
You have two tables.
You are 30 minutes late.

22
00:03:58,869 --> 00:04:01,463
And if I ever say this again,
your job will go to...

23
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,938
Todd Slauson
from Duluth, Minnesota.

24
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,144
Sparkling or flat?

25
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:16,811
Waiter 10,
do you have your earpiece in?

26
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:19,913
You forget the order 41
for Table 101.

27
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:22,288
What the fuck, man?
What, are you on break?

28
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:24,258
<i>Nah, I'm just</i>
<i>messin'with you.</i>

29
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:27,990
Uh, we'll have four
Ketel Red Bulls and...

30
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:31,693
And I'll have a Ketel cosmo
with a Red Bull and some bread ASAP.

31
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,771
We don't have bread.

32
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:37,500
What do you mean?
How can you not have bread?

33
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:41,135
Uh, we're a Vietnamese restaurant.
We just don't have bread.

34
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:43,270
But you're
not Vietnamese.

35
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,178
No, I'm not.

36
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:51,017
Can I have something to chew on?
Fuck. Bamboo, whatever.

37
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:53,146
I'll see what I can find.

38
00:04:56,093 --> 00:04:58,323
<i>Waiter number 12...</i>

39
00:04:58,429 --> 00:05:00,795
<i>Flight Number 121</i>

00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:28,446
<i>Shit, yo.</i>

42
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:30,452
Holy shit.

43
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:32,886
What's up, man?

44
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,890
Largeman, what are you
doing here?

45
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:38,325
Uh, that's my mom.

46
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:41,330
- Fuck.
- Oh, fuck.

47
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:43,332
Sorry.

48
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:45,766
Yeah.

49
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:49,270
So, welcome back home.

50
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:51,102
Thanks.

51
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,540
So what have you
been doing?

52
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:55,839
You still, uh,
acting and shit, right?

53
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:58,278
- Yeah.
<i>- L-In L.A., right?</i>

54
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:00,282
- Yeah.
<i>- That's cool.</i>

55
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:02,284
I hear that place
is, like, fucking crazy.

56
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:05,446
My cousin's a writer out there.
Says that place is mad crazy.

57
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:08,616
<i>He's, like, writing a movie</i>
<i>about snowboarders or some shit.</i>

58
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:10,659
I don't...
I don't know.

59
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:13,855
Um, but I should
introduce you to him, Largeman.

60
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:15,864
Maybe you two
could do something together.

61
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,991
Yeah, definitely.

62
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:20,536
What are you
doing tonight, man?

63
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:24,405
Uh, nothing.
No real plans.

64
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:26,772
I'm just in town
for a couple days, so...

65
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:28,777
You should
come out with us.

66
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:33,077
We're gonna go over the Gleasons' house.
They're having some...

67
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:35,208
fucking huge party
or something.

68
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,981
- Supposedly.
- Well, yeah. Supposedly.

69
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:40,648
- Really?
<i>- He lives up on the hill.</i>

70
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:42,952
We'll probably go over there
after we bury your mom.

71
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,119
<i>- Well, I got to shower.</i>
<i>- Same.</i>

72
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:50,865
<i>Do you know your mother</i>
<i>redid the hallway bathroom?</i>

73
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:53,935
What?
I'm sorry. What?

74
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:56,938
Since I met her,
she never showed an interest in anything.

75
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,338
All of a sudden,
a month ago, she wakes up...

76
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:01,934
she wants to redecorate
a bathroom.

77
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:04,309
I helped her.

78
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:07,679
- Oh, must have been fun.
- Well, I sew.

79
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:09,684
I made you something.

80
00:08:09,786 --> 00:08:11,651
It's a shirt.

81
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:15,224
That's... That's good.
Thank you.

82
00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:19,153
Will you try it on now?

83
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:22,697
Now?

84
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,427
In case I have to fix it
before you leave again...

85
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:28,232
and we don't see you
for another nine years.

86
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:30,238
I wanna make sure it fits.

87
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,036
Oh. Okay.

88
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:36,078
You're gonna
love the material.

89
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,241
I used the leftovers from
your mother's design. Gorgeous.

90
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,733
Hi.

91
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:04,304
- Hello.
- How you doing?

92
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:08,242
"Well, besides that,
Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show?"

93
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:11,940
You know, I'm not really sure what
to say here, Dad, so I'm sorry.

94
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,449
Mm.

95
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:16,815
<i>How are you?</i>

96
00:09:18,622 --> 00:09:20,954
I'm okay.

97
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:23,458
I've been getting these
really bad headaches though.

98
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,256
<i>Um, they're really quick.</i>

99
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:29,855
It's like a... just a little
lightning storm in my head.

100
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:32,060
Just for a second,
and then it's gone.

101
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:35,969
I just thought maybe you could help me
get that checked out while I'm home.

102
00:09:36,073 --> 00:09:38,268
Go see Dr. Cohen
first thing in the morning.

103
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,741
He's a neurologist in my building.
I-I'll call him.

104
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:43,608
He'll fit you in. I'm sure it's
nothing to worry about.

105
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:50,185
Place looks good.

106
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:53,950
Oh, that's nice. Yeah, we've been
doing a lot of work on it.

107
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:56,082
Really?

108
00:09:58,662 --> 00:10:01,859
Actually, no.
I don't know why I just said that.

109
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:04,456
Someone redid the, uh,
hallway bathroom. I saw that.

110
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:06,832
Yeah. That's new.

111
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:13,606
I'm glad you're here.

112
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:18,580
Saying good-bye
is important.

113
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,180
I'm glad you could
fit it in.

114
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:40,425
- Put your hands on your head, please.
- What?

115
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,399
I said put your motherfucking hands
on your head! Please.

116
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:47,402
Eighty-two in a 25.

117
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:49,972
What are you gonna tell me,
you're late or just tired?

118
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:51,973
- I was...
- Shut the fuck up!

119
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:59,972
- Largeman.
- Kenny?

120
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,108
Holy shit!

121
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:04,119
Oh, man.
How you doing?

122
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:06,155
I'm... I'm great.

123
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:08,656
- Your mom just died!
- I know.

124
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,660
- I mean, that's why you're home.
- Yeah. Yup.

125
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:13,957
You're a cop, Kenny?

126
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:17,659
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Why?

127
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:20,828
I don't know. Couldn't think of
anything better to do.

128
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:22,837
No, but it's really cool
though, man.

129
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:25,237
People really
listen to you. I mean...

130
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:27,242
they have to!

131
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:30,245
- Yo, and check this shit out. That's the safety.
- Oh, cool.

132
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:33,009
And plus, the benefits, man.
If I get shot, I'm like...

133
00:12:33,116 --> 00:12:35,016
rich!

134
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:38,645
But, Kenny, the last time I saw you,
you were doing coke lines off a urinal.

135
00:12:38,755 --> 00:12:41,223
No, I had to grow up, man.

136
00:12:41,324 --> 00:12:44,760
It's time to grow up. Plus, I wasn't
making shit in that fish market.

137
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:47,227
No one knew who I was,
couldn't get laid.

138
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,389
It's a much better
situation for me, man.

139
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:55,165
Speaking of which,
um, how'd I do?

140
00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:56,933
What do you mean?

141
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,167
I don't know.
You know, just the whole...

142
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:01,506
You mean, like, as a cop?

143
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:04,102
Yeah. The whole,
"Shut the fuck up!"

144
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:07,445
Well, I thought you were a dick,
so I guess that's good.

145
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:10,281
Nice. So,
what the fuck, man?

146
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:13,185
You're this huge movie star now?
I heard you did some...

147
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,315
you played a big football player
or something.

148
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:17,552
- I didn't see it.
- It was just this thing...

149
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:20,129
- Fucking De Niro and shit.
- What?

150
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,130
- He's awesome.
- Yeah.

151
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:24,132
<i>- Deer Hunter?</i>
- Yeah.

152
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:26,725
Man, we should sit down
and we should talk...

153
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:30,102
because I've got some
really good ideas for movies.

154
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,607
You could play me
and shit. Poof!

155
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,007
<i>- Stories from the Force.</i>
- Yeah.

156
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:37,602
Yeah, definitely. That sounds good.

157
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:02,437
- Holy shit!
- What's up?

158
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:04,439
- How you doing, man?
- How you doing, man?

159
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,873
<i>- What's up?</i>
- Hey, how you doing? Good to see you.

160
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:11,004
<i>Get this guy a beer. This guy does not</i>
<i>wait for a beer. He's a movie star.</i>

161
00:14:11,114 --> 00:14:13,241
Like, uh, Jersey's
De Niro and shit.

162
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,955
- Largeman, man, what are you doing home?
- I, uh...

163
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:21,353
Press junket.

164
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,949
That's phat, yo.
Fuck, yeah!

165
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,427
<i>Serpico</i> and shit.
"Attica!"

166
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:30,432
<i>Shut the fuck up, man.</i>

167
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:34,468
You like that?

168
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:37,404
Like, uh,
"press junket"?

169
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:40,305
That's improv, bitch.
You can use it. Right?

170
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,310
Okay. Let me
show you something.

171
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:50,953
Largeman! Oh, whoa!
What's going on, man?

172
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:54,616
How you been?
Hey!

173
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:57,318
- Jess. How are you, brother?
- How's it going, man?

174
00:14:57,427 --> 00:15:00,294
I haven't seen you in so long.
I heard you're kicking ass.

175
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:03,889
Oh, um, basically the man
bought my silent Velcro patent.

176
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,594
- What?
- I developed this little item.

177
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:08,933
It's just like Velcro,
but it doesn't make that...

178
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,633
the Velcro noise.

179
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:14,505
- So how much did they buy it for?
- A lot, man.

180
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:17,512
Wow. So wh-what are you
doing with yourself?

181
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:19,582
Um, nothing.
Nothing.

182
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:21,651
<i>I've never been so bored</i>
<i>in my whole life.</i>

183
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:24,777
Yeah. First month I went out.
I bought a whole bunch of shit.

184
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:26,788
But, y...
Nothing.

185
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:32,586
<i>Someone got</i>
<i>a joint for me?</i>

186
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:03,992
Here you go.

187
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:08,656
Oh. No, thanks, man.

188
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:12,257
Really? I thought you were
a big movie star and shit.

189
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:14,701
- Nah.
<i>- Well, then here.</i>

190
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:17,534
Eat this.

191
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:19,836
<i>Welcome home.</i>

192
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:33,351
I guess I'll see you guys later.

193
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:37,490
Should we
play a game?

194
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:41,257
<i>Let's play</i>
<i>"spin the bottle."</i>

195
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:44,891
I'm not playing "spin the bottle."
How old are we?

196
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:47,834
- Or more importantly, how old are they?
- Oh, they're all legal.

197
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:49,837
I think.

198
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:52,203
<i>Well, we just ate</i>
<i>all this fucking "X,"</i>

199
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:55,004
so what the hell else
are we supposed to do?

200
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:57,511
Girl has a point.

201
00:16:57,614 --> 00:17:00,981
<i>- Fucking right.</i>
<i>- I'm in!</i>

202
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,316
<i>- Hey!</i>
<i>- Large!</i>

203
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:13,189
<i>Large!</i>

204
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:21,853
- Largeman, this is Dana.
- Hi.

205
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:24,661
Hi.

206
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:26,998
Who's up?

207
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:56,632
Whoo!

208
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,167
This is gonna be a good night.

209
00:20:22,752 --> 00:20:24,652
It's good, isn't it?

210
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,655
I always try to save a couple
of the marshmallows till the very end...

211
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:33,729
but I never make it.

212
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,730
I always end up with...

213
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:38,130
a bunch of flake things
and pink milk.

214
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:41,760
My mind wanders.

215
00:20:44,908 --> 00:20:46,808
<i>So, Tim...</i>

216
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,277
How long have you been
working at Medieval Times?

217
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,077
Three years. B-But I've
only been a knight for two.

218
00:20:54,183 --> 00:20:56,151
You have to
pay your dues.

219
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:59,483
I worked in the stables
and helped in the kitchen.

220
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:01,750
When I started,
he was making the coleslaw.

221
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:04,122
It hasn't been the same
since you got knighted.

222
00:21:04,227 --> 00:21:06,127
But I really
just stirred it.

223
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:08,220
Don't be modest.

224
00:21:08,331 --> 00:21:10,663
Mr. Modesty won
the joust last night.

225
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:15,101
- Congratulations.
- It's not that big a deal. It's fixed.

226
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:18,105
<i>What was it that happened</i>
<i>to you in high school?</i>

227
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:20,107
You had a thing.
I forgot what it was.

228
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:22,609
- He got the shit kicked out of him.
- No, he didn't.

229
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:26,341
How do you know? He got the shit
kicked out of him by Tyrell Freedmen.

230
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:29,213
- I fucked him up too.
- He knocked your teeth out.

231
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:31,651
He only chipped one tooth.

232
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:36,357
So, uh, w-what are you
up to now, Mark?

233
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:38,359
You're digging graves?

234
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:44,957
Mark's getting into
real estate.

235
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:52,733
- Tim can speak Klingon.
- What?

236
00:21:52,842 --> 00:21:54,707
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

237
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:57,041
- What the fuck is Klingon?
- Like the <i>Star Trek</i> guys?

238
00:21:57,146 --> 00:21:59,740
- Yeah, he can speak their language.
- No, she's kidding.

239
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:02,079
No, I'm not.
Why are you being shy?

240
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:04,676
- Yeah, don't be shy, Tim.
- It's just... It's made-up.

241
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:07,722
This guy who plays the wizard
at work is a Trekkie. I don't...

242
00:22:07,824 --> 00:22:10,987
- Don't be shy. Tell them
what you said to me last night.
- No.

243
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:13,722
Say what you said
to her last night.

244
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:20,696
You gotta be kidding me.

245
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:23,772
It means, "I like to
mate after battle."

246
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:25,864
- That's not what I said.
- Yeah.

247
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:27,943
No. No. That wasn't
the one I said.

248
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:29,978
This one means,
"Kill Kirk"...

249
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,708
and also "Hallelujah,"
depending on the context.

250
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:36,114
You must have got it
confused with, uh...

251
00:22:38,821 --> 00:22:42,416
- Honey, that is good.
- You know what that means, Tim?

252
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:45,426
Well, I do. It means,
"Get the fuck out of my house...

253
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:47,428
before I chop
your fucking head off."

254
00:22:55,505 --> 00:22:57,871
Mark, he's a knight.

255
00:22:57,974 --> 00:23:00,704
He's just a fast-food knight.

256
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,046
I should get going.

257
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,659
Thanks, uh,
for the cereal.

258
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:21,787
I had a lovely evening.

259
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:24,298
By the way, it says
"balls" on your face.

260
00:23:26,502 --> 00:23:29,403
- Asshole.
- My mom did it.

261
00:23:33,076 --> 00:23:35,271
In the spring...

262
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:39,678
the hungry gator must find
new and clever ways to find food.

263
00:23:44,454 --> 00:23:47,321
Did you tell Large
about... the tapes?

264
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:50,085
No, Mom. I'm not doing
those stupid tapes.

265
00:23:50,193 --> 00:23:52,127
- What are the tapes?
- Real estate tapes.

266
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:55,959
You can make up to
$100,000 your first year.

267
00:23:56,065 --> 00:23:58,556
You should have seen the boat
this Oriental guy had.

268
00:23:58,668 --> 00:24:01,865
He even had his own game show in China,
he had so much money.

269
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:03,996
I think Mark would be
perfect at it.

270
00:24:04,107 --> 00:24:07,270
Ma, shut up about those fuckin' tapes.
Okay? It's a scam.

271
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:11,073
Well, I'm doing it.
I'm saving up for those tapes.

272
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,448
Because I know what you could be
if you just apply yourself.

273
00:24:12,448 --> 00:24:13,972
Because I know what you could be
if you just apply yourself.

274
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:17,075
You know what?
I do apply myself every day, Mom.

275
00:24:17,186 --> 00:24:20,280
I work my ass off
burying dead people. Okay?

276
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:23,222
I'm only 26. I'm not in any rush.
What's your rush for?

277
00:24:25,128 --> 00:24:27,824
Just let me be.
I don't rush you.

278
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:32,993
Okay. Then I'll
do 'em myself.

279
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:35,969
Fine. Do 'em.

280
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:39,940
Okay, then I won't
let you on my yacht.

281
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:43,205
Except Large. Large, you can
come anytime you want.

282
00:24:43,312 --> 00:24:46,804
Just don't bring
your friend here.

283
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:51,513
Shit! I got to go
to my meeting.

284
00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:54,813
Okay.

285
00:24:57,126 --> 00:24:59,026
I love you.

286
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:02,663
- I love you too.
- I love you.

287
00:25:05,768 --> 00:25:08,931
- Large, it was nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

288
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:11,666
Oh. Oh, you guys,
don't stay in here all day...

289
00:25:11,774 --> 00:25:14,641
'cause I took the batteries out of
the carbon monoxide detector.

290
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:17,110
It was beeping all night.

291
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:22,176
She drives me crazy!

292
00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:25,652
<i>She gets all baked out and makes me</i>
<i>feel like I have to impress her.</i>

293
00:25:25,755 --> 00:25:27,655
And you know what?

294
00:25:27,757 --> 00:25:30,248
I'm okay with being unimpressive.
I sleep better.

295
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:35,694
- Hey, what time is it?
- No idea.

296
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:37,732
I gotta go.

297
00:25:42,271 --> 00:25:44,466
Hi, I'm Andrew Largeman.
I'm sorry.

298
00:25:44,574 --> 00:25:47,702
- I'm really late for my appointment.
- Andrew. Andrew.

299
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,246
Okay, Andrew. I'm gonna need you
to fill out this paperwork for me.

300
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:53,508
As soon as we're ready,
we'll call you in.

301
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:55,982
- Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Have a seat.

302
00:25:56,085 --> 00:25:57,985
<i>- Hello, Miss Lubin.</i>
- Oh, hello there.

303
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:00,612
<i>Just have a seat.</i>
<i>We'll be with you soon, okay?</i>

304
00:26:00,723 --> 00:26:02,918
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

305
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:28,616
How's it going?

306
00:26:31,354 --> 00:26:33,413
Get off.

307
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:35,422
Get off.

308
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:46,968
Heel.

309
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:50,368
Heel!

310
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:56,504
Got any suggestions?

311
00:26:56,612 --> 00:26:58,546
Oh, what?

312
00:26:58,648 --> 00:27:01,776
- You got any suggestions?
- Yeah, kick his balls.

313
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,353
Kick his balls.

314
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,021
Yeah, but I don't wanna destroy
future generations of charitable dogs.

315
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:13,027
Don't worry about it.
I got three Dobermans.

316
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:16,565
If I didn't kick them in the balls regularly,
I'd never get anything done.

317
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,634
But he's gotta be close
to finishing by now.

318
00:27:18,734 --> 00:27:20,634
Not yet.

319
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:22,863
Here comes the lipstick.

320
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:25,270
Mrs. Lubin?
We're ready for you now.

321
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:28,275
Okay. Come on, Arthur.

322
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,918
I feel so used.

323
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:40,785
Thanks for your help.
For, at least, your good intentions.

324
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:45,324
- I recognize you.
- Oh, did you go to Columbia High?

325
00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:47,726
No, not from high school.
From TV.

326
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,492
- Didn't you play the retarded quarterback?
- Yeah.

327
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,590
Are you
really retarded?

328
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:55,903
No, I'm not.

329
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:58,132
Cool.

330
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,869
Great job, man. I mean,
I thought you were really retarded.

331
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:05,140
You're just as good as that Corky kid,
and he's actually retarded.

332
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:07,408
If there was some
sort of retarded Oscar...

333
00:28:07,516 --> 00:28:11,077
you would win like
hands down, kick his ass.

334
00:28:11,187 --> 00:28:13,883
Well, thank you.
Thanks, I appreciate it.

335
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:16,457
I have to fill out
this form though, so...

336
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,459
- Right on.
- Thanks.

337
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:25,725
My cousin's an actor.
Jake Ryan Winters.

338
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:27,735
Doubt you've ever
heard of him.

339
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:32,240
He was, like, on <i>Xena</i> once as a gnome
or something. That's really cool though.

340
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:34,775
Thanks.

341
00:28:36,212 --> 00:28:38,112
Oh, my God.

342
00:28:38,214 --> 00:28:40,114
That scene.
That last scene...

343
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:42,480
where you give the speech
to the whole stadium...

344
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:45,383
and your dad... oh, your dad
gives you the thumbs up.

345
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:48,389
Aw. That was, like...

346
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:50,391
That was emotional.

347
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:53,895
So, you got
anything else coming out?

348
00:28:53,996 --> 00:28:56,226
No. You know,
I'm auditioning...

349
00:28:56,332 --> 00:28:58,266
I can't believe
you're not really retarded.

350
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:00,267
I mean, Jake's not
a very good actor.

351
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:03,429
You can't really tell on <i>Xena</i>
'cause he's in the hairy gnome suit...

352
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:07,066
but when we were little, he used to
put on these really, really low-budge...

353
00:29:07,176 --> 00:29:09,440
renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber
musicals in our attic.

354
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:12,514
<i>And they were awful!</i>

355
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:14,845
Like, so bad.

356
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:20,347
It sucks, though, because there's not
that much work for little people, you know?

357
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:22,924
<i>Anyway, I'm talking too much.</i>

358
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:25,755
I'll just...
You got to fill out your forms.

359
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:27,954
What are you
listening to?

360
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:30,031
The Shins.

361
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:32,498
- You know them?
- No.

362
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:35,934
You gotta hear this one song.
It'll change your life. I swear.

363
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:39,599
Oh, I'm sorry. You have to...
You gotta fill out your forms.

364
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,608
Conundrum.
Think you could, uh...

365
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,043
- maybe listen while you fill out your forms?
- I think I can handle it.

366
00:29:45,147 --> 00:29:47,115
Yeah? Okay.

367
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,409
It's good.
I like it.

368
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:20,672
- So, what are you here for?
- What are you here for?

369
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:22,910
Waiting for a friend. You?

370
00:30:24,286 --> 00:30:26,186
I, uh...

371
00:30:26,288 --> 00:30:28,688
Oh, fuck, that was nosy.
I'm sorry.

372
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:32,420
I am so nosy. I didn't...
I didn't mean to be. I'm sorry.

373
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:35,725
No, I just... I get these headaches.
I just want to have it checked out.

374
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,822
Cool.

375
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:39,833
<i>- Andrew Largeman?</i>
- Yes.

376
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:43,268
- We're ready for you now.
- Oh, okay.

377
00:30:43,372 --> 00:30:46,273
- Thank you. Nice meeting you.
- You didn't. I'm Sam.

378
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,002
Andrew.

379
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,546
Nice to meet you.
Good luck with your head.

380
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:53,581
Thanks.

381
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,348
Don't worry, Sam.
We'll be with you next.

382
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:29,875
- Mr. Andrew Largeman?
- Yes, hi.

383
00:31:29,985 --> 00:31:32,078
- There's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
- What?

384
00:31:32,187 --> 00:31:35,213
Just kidding.
How would I know that? Uh...

385
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:38,726
<i>I'm Dr. Cohen.</i>

386
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:42,989
What can we do
for you today, Andrew.

387
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:46,732
Um, I've been getting these
really intense headaches.

388
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:50,066
<i>Um, they last for</i>
<i>like a split second.</i>

389
00:31:50,172 --> 00:31:54,006
It's like lightning, like a surge
of electricity, and then it's gone.

390
00:31:57,813 --> 00:31:59,747
Lithium?

391
00:31:59,848 --> 00:32:01,907
How long have you been
on the lithium?

392
00:32:02,017 --> 00:32:06,511
Um, I've been on some form of it
since I was 10 or so.

393
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:11,622
And the Paxil,
Zoloft, Celexa...

394
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:13,661
Depakote...

395
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:16,253
did they, uh,
help you at all?

396
00:32:16,365 --> 00:32:18,265
No.

397
00:32:19,401 --> 00:32:21,392
I mean,
I don't know. Uh...

398
00:32:21,503 --> 00:32:24,836
It's recently occurred to me I might not
even have a problem.

399
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,343
Only, I'd never know it because as far back
as I can remember, I've been medicated.

400
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:31,675
<i>I left them</i>
<i>in L.A. Though.</i>

401
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,012
<i>This is, uh, the first time I haven't had</i>
<i>medicine in my body for... a long time.</i>

402
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:38,678
<i>You know that stuff will</i>
<i>leave your body pretty fast.</i>

403
00:32:38,787 --> 00:32:43,224
- I can write you a prescription.
- Actually, I was thinking about
taking a little vacation.

404
00:32:43,325 --> 00:32:45,623
Have you discussed this
with your psychiatrist?

405
00:32:45,728 --> 00:32:49,061
Uh, well,
my psychiatrist is my dad.

406
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:53,759
Yeah. So I think he'd
prefer me to stay on it.

407
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:57,066
He... likes to think
it makes me happy.

408
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:02,239
You know, our bodies are capable
of doing some very funny things...

409
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:04,710
when they're consumed
with stress and anxiety.

410
00:33:05,814 --> 00:33:07,543
<i>Uh...</i>

411
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:12,485
I found my ex-best friend's
cuff links in my wife's purse.

412
00:33:15,124 --> 00:33:17,752
I couldn't get an erection
for a year and a half...

413
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,760
for example.

414
00:33:21,563 --> 00:33:24,862
Wow. Um...

415
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:27,800
But I don't really think
that's it because I don't...

416
00:33:27,903 --> 00:33:31,270
I don't really feel like
stressed or anxious at all.

417
00:33:31,373 --> 00:33:35,104
'Cause all the lithium he's had you on.
It's amazing you can even hear me now.

418
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:39,576
Look, Andrew, uh,
first of all...

419
00:33:39,682 --> 00:33:43,140
I think you do need to find
a psychiatrist that isn't your father.

420
00:33:43,252 --> 00:33:46,050
That's something that should have
been remedied years ago.

421
00:33:46,155 --> 00:33:48,055
He knows better.

422
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:51,149
And secondly, uh, I'm in
no position to comment on...

423
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,855
whether you should stay on the meds or not
because I don't know your story.

424
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:58,922
But my opinion,
since you're paying for it...

425
00:33:59,034 --> 00:34:02,629
<i>is that, yeah, those drugs may help you</i>
<i>as a means to an end...</i>

426
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:05,434
but sooner or later, if you're not
in some sort of therapy...

427
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:09,773
whatever's going on in your mind will find
a way to peek its little head out of the water.

428
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:12,039
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

429
00:34:12,147 --> 00:34:14,206
Yeah, you're all right.
You're alive.

430
00:34:14,316 --> 00:34:17,149
Come on.
I'll take a look at you. Come.

431
00:34:19,588 --> 00:34:23,046
I'll need you to take your shoes off.
I have to scratch your feet.

432
00:34:56,058 --> 00:34:58,356
So why were you
really there?

433
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,485
Charging.
I'm a robot.

434
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:05,591
- Do you lie a lot?
- What do you consider a lot?

435
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:07,669
Enough for people
to call you a liar.

436
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:11,297
- People call me lots of things.
- Is one of them "liar"?

437
00:35:11,406 --> 00:35:14,273
I could say no, but how would
you know I'm not lyin'?

438
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:16,867
I guess I could choose
to trust you.

439
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:19,447
- You can do that?
- I can try.

440
00:35:19,548 --> 00:35:21,846
Whose bike is that?

441
00:35:23,952 --> 00:35:26,182
It was my grandfather's.

442
00:35:26,288 --> 00:35:30,782
It was the only thing he left to anyone
in my family, and he left it to me.

443
00:35:30,893 --> 00:35:32,884
And I like it.

444
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,799
So this is the point in the conversation
where you ask me if I'd like a ride home.

445
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:42,063
- It is?
- Yep.

446
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,239
Would you like a ride home?

447
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:52,372
Fine. But I'm not
getting in that sidecar.

448
00:35:52,481 --> 00:35:55,177
- Why not?
- Sidecars are for bitches.

449
00:35:55,284 --> 00:35:58,014
Anyone who rides in that
is automatically your bitch.

450
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,680
Thus, I will ride
on the back.

451
00:36:08,964 --> 00:36:10,864
- Whoa.
- Hold on tight.

452
00:36:10,966 --> 00:36:13,025
Okay. Holdin'.

453
00:36:16,638 --> 00:36:18,799
My hair is blowin'
in the wind.

454
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:25,545
What, are you
like a hang glider?

455
00:36:25,647 --> 00:36:28,115
My boyfriend was gonna
pick me up so I brought it.

456
00:36:28,217 --> 00:36:31,675
- But then he couldn't.
- What does he have? One of those tandem things?

457
00:36:31,787 --> 00:36:34,517
No. He drives a Ninja.
Goes way faster than this guy.

458
00:36:34,623 --> 00:36:38,081
- But what kind of helmet is that?
- You can wear it on a bike.

459
00:36:38,193 --> 00:36:40,718
- Anyway, how's your head?
- I should live through the day.

460
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:42,729
Cool.
Make a right here.

461
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:50,300
Are you doing
anything right now?

462
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:53,499
- Can you elaborate on "doing anything"?
- I know this guy, Jesse.

463
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:55,634
He bought this mansion
that's right up here...

464
00:36:55,744 --> 00:36:57,644
and he wants me
to come visit him.

465
00:36:57,746 --> 00:37:01,944
But I don't want to stay very long.
I was thinking, like if you came too...

466
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,451
I could just say I have to take you home
when I'm ready to go.

467
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:08,717
Wow. That's pretty damn
random of you, Andrew.

468
00:37:08,824 --> 00:37:11,292
- I know.
- "Nice to meet you. Can I use you?"

469
00:37:11,393 --> 00:37:13,384
- No.
- It's the Hollywood in you, I guess.

470
00:37:13,495 --> 00:37:15,929
No. Come on.
It's not like that. It'll be fun.

471
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:19,262
I'll tell you what, we can have like...
like a signal.

472
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:22,394
Like, when you pull on your ear,
that's the code.

473
00:37:22,504 --> 00:37:26,497
And then I'll be like, "Oh, I got to
take her home." And then we'll go.

474
00:37:28,176 --> 00:37:30,235
Can we have
code names too?

475
00:37:30,345 --> 00:37:32,779
If you want.

476
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:35,782
Okay. But don't try
and like kidnap me or anything...

477
00:37:35,884 --> 00:37:39,786
'cause my step-uncle's a bounty hunter
and he could have you tracked and killed.

478
00:37:39,888 --> 00:37:42,015
You're such a liar.

479
00:37:44,493 --> 00:37:46,393
Whoo!

480
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,160
Okay. You ready?

481
00:38:11,353 --> 00:38:14,288
I'll be fine. Am I the first boy
you've ever brought home?

482
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:16,323
No. But, um...

483
00:38:16,425 --> 00:38:19,553
I lied to you before when I told you
my boyfriend drives a Ninja.

484
00:38:19,661 --> 00:38:22,687
- He doesn't drive a bike?
- No, I don't have a boyfriend.

485
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:26,563
But, you know,
he might drive a Ninja.

486
00:38:26,668 --> 00:38:29,831
- Wherever he is.
- Wow. We're off to a great start.

487
00:38:29,938 --> 00:38:34,102
Okay. So...
So sometimes I lie.

488
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:36,905
I mean,
I'm weird, man.

489
00:38:37,012 --> 00:38:40,038
About random stuff too.
I don't even know why I do it.

490
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:42,048
It's like...
It's like a tic.

491
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:46,587
I mean, sometimes I hear myself
say something, and then I think...

492
00:38:46,688 --> 00:38:49,156
"Wow, that wasn't even
remotely true."

493
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:51,817
So how do people know
what's real?

494
00:38:51,927 --> 00:38:55,954
Well, I always feel bad afterwards
and admit them when they're lies.

495
00:38:57,165 --> 00:38:59,065
Can you trust that?

496
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:02,193
Open the door.

497
00:39:03,939 --> 00:39:05,173
Okay.

498
00:39:05,173 --> 00:39:06,071
Okay.

499
00:39:10,178 --> 00:39:12,669
Kevin, down.
Mom!

500
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:15,614
Come on. Kick him in the balls.
Kick him in the balls.

501
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:17,912
Mom!

502
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,921
All right! Everybody down!
Who wants to eat?

503
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:24,254
Do you want to eat?
Then get the fuck off him.

504
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,021
Kevin!
Get off!

505
00:39:27,129 --> 00:39:30,428
<i>I'm so sorry. We just don't have</i>
<i>the time to train them.</i>

506
00:39:30,532 --> 00:39:32,727
Who's got the time
to train them?

507
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:35,530
- Mom, this is Andrew.
- Welcome.

508
00:39:35,637 --> 00:39:37,537
Welcome.
I'm sorry the place is a wreck.

509
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:41,006
<i>Honey, I asked you to get</i>
<i>the metal wheel out of the hamster cage.</i>

510
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:44,010
- I forgot.
- Well, you forgot and now Jelly's dead.

511
00:39:44,112 --> 00:39:46,239
Luckily, I got Peanut Butter out in time.

512
00:39:46,348 --> 00:39:48,782
We have to get
the only hamsters on planet Earth...

513
00:39:48,884 --> 00:39:51,045
<i>who can't figure out</i>
<i>a stupid hamster wheel.</i>

514
00:39:51,153 --> 00:39:53,280
There's a tin box
on the kitchen counter.

515
00:39:53,388 --> 00:39:55,948
You can do the honors.
I have to get to work.

516
00:39:56,058 --> 00:39:58,049
- It's nice to meet you. Andrew, right?
<i>- Yes.</i>

517
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,458
Andrew.
Very nice to meet you.

518
00:40:00,562 --> 00:40:03,122
Samatha, put the clothes
in the dryer and buryJelly.

519
00:40:06,668 --> 00:40:08,966
So this is it.

520
00:40:17,712 --> 00:40:19,907
- It's nice.
- No, it's not.

521
00:40:20,015 --> 00:40:22,745
Don't say that just 'cause
you can't think of anything else.

522
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:25,183
I'm not. I'm not.
It's... It's very cozy.

523
00:40:25,287 --> 00:40:27,755
You guys are a little early
on the tree though.

524
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:31,815
<i>Yeah, we never got around to taking it down.</i>
<i>When it got to be fall again...</i>

525
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:33,827
we figured,
"Just leave it up."

526
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:37,194
Oh, my God. You're totally freaked out.
You're totally freaked out right now.

527
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:40,462
- You, like, can't wait to leave.
- I'm not. I'm not. I like it.

528
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:43,197
- It's very nice.
- Well, you wanna see my room?

529
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:45,205
Sure.

530
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:48,141
- Hey.
- Hey.

531
00:40:48,243 --> 00:40:51,303
Titembay, this is my friend Andrew.
Andrew, this is my brother, Titembay.

532
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:54,940
- Hi. It's very nice to meet you.
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.

533
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,143
- I'm sorry about Jelly.
- Oh, that's okay.

534
00:40:57,252 --> 00:40:59,880
I saved some mac and cheese for you.
It's in the fridge.

535
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:02,013
Thank you.

536
00:41:05,961 --> 00:41:09,397
Anyway, I'm late for class.
It's nice meeting you.

537
00:41:09,498 --> 00:41:12,296
- Very nice to meet you.
- See you later.

538
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,670
So here we are.

539
00:41:17,772 --> 00:41:20,900
It's nothing fancy,
but you know... What?

540
00:41:22,677 --> 00:41:25,237
Uh, it's... Titembay, right?

541
00:41:25,347 --> 00:41:28,111
Yeah, it's weird, huh?
You're, like, so freaked out right now.

542
00:41:28,216 --> 00:41:31,515
You're running for the door. It's okay.
You can go. Don't feel bad. It's really...

543
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,588
- Stop doing that.
- What?

544
00:41:33,688 --> 00:41:37,021
The whole thing you just did. I wanna be here.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be.

545
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:39,855
Trust me, my family is way more
fucked up than yours. Okay?

546
00:41:39,961 --> 00:41:41,588
Okay.

547
00:41:41,696 --> 00:41:44,563
So, Titembay.

548
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:48,397
- Yeah, he's my brother.
- Is he adopted or...

549
00:41:48,503 --> 00:41:51,495
Kind of. My mom adopted him
from Sally Struthers like years ago.

550
00:41:51,606 --> 00:41:55,269
One of those "For the cost
of a cup of coffee a day" sort of things.

551
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:58,904
Where she's like, "How can you
just sit there and not help the children?"

552
00:41:59,014 --> 00:42:02,381
And we couldn't. We just couldn't sit there
and not help the children.

553
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:05,817
So we start sending him like
pictures and letters and stuff for years...

554
00:42:05,921 --> 00:42:09,687
<i>but then I got really into ice-skating,</i>
<i>so we sort of forgot about him.</i>

555
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,817
Then one day we get this phone call
and it's Titembay.

556
00:42:12,928 --> 00:42:15,123
And he's at the dry cleaners
around the corner.

557
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,960
And he's like, "I'm at Rutgers.
I live in the dorms...

558
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:21,524
but I'm used to living with my tribe
so I'd rather live with a family."

559
00:42:21,636 --> 00:42:24,070
And he's been living
with us ever since.

560
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:26,606
Wow.

561
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:29,643
Yeah. I know.
He's the most amazing guy.

562
00:42:29,744 --> 00:42:33,578
You gotta hear his stories. He struggled
through so much because he wanted to learn.

563
00:42:33,682 --> 00:42:35,809
When I think of what
he's accomplished, I just...

564
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:37,851
I just feel,
like, lazy. You know?

565
00:42:37,953 --> 00:42:40,786
He's studying criminal justice at Rutgers,
and when he was a baby...

566
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:44,154
he was one of those kids with,
like, the flies all over his face.

567
00:42:45,493 --> 00:42:47,791
Wow.

568
00:42:47,896 --> 00:42:49,796
I mean,
i-it's a crazy story.

569
00:42:49,898 --> 00:42:53,800
Yeah, I know. I mean, that's a true story.
I am not that good.

570
00:42:54,936 --> 00:42:57,461
This is Tickle.

571
00:42:57,572 --> 00:43:01,872
- What is Tickle?
- Tickle's my favorite thing in the whole world.

572
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:04,946
It's all that's left
of Nanny, my blanket.

573
00:43:05,046 --> 00:43:07,241
- Tickle's all that remains.
- Mm-hmm.

574
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:09,783
- Was there like a hurricane or something?
- Shut up.

575
00:43:09,884 --> 00:43:13,251
No, I mean, I've had this
since I was a baby.

576
00:43:13,355 --> 00:43:16,085
It's what they brought me home
in from the hospital.

577
00:43:17,392 --> 00:43:20,384
- It's like the Wailing Wall.
- What?

578
00:43:20,495 --> 00:43:22,827
Uh, the Wailing Wall
is like this, uh...

579
00:43:22,931 --> 00:43:26,492
It's like the most holy place
forJews to go and pray in Israel.

580
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:31,265
It's all that's left of this enormous temple
that was destroyed by the Romans.

581
00:43:31,373 --> 00:43:34,171
So you're like
reallyJewish.

582
00:43:34,276 --> 00:43:36,176
- What?
- You are, aren't you?

583
00:43:36,278 --> 00:43:38,371
- You are.
- No, I'm not.

584
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,380
L-I'm Jewish,
but I'm not reallyJewish.

585
00:43:40,482 --> 00:43:43,246
I don't do anything Jewish.
I don't go to temple or anything.

586
00:43:43,351 --> 00:43:45,581
But I don't know anyJews
that go to temple.

587
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:47,814
The Jews I know,
they go on one day.

588
00:43:47,922 --> 00:43:50,914
- It's Yom Kippur, the Day of Repentance.
- Okay.

589
00:43:51,026 --> 00:43:53,824
Did you know that most temples
are built with moveable walls...

590
00:43:53,928 --> 00:43:57,295
so that on the one day of the year
when everyone comes to repent...

591
00:43:57,399 --> 00:44:00,129
they can actually make the room
big enough to hold everyone?

592
00:44:00,235 --> 00:44:02,829
I don't really
believe in God.

593
00:44:02,937 --> 00:44:05,701
- Just Tickle.
- Oh, I believe in Tickle.

594
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:10,334
- We're not gonna make out or anything.
- What?

595
00:44:10,445 --> 00:44:13,243
I'm sorry.
I just totally ruined that moment, didn't I?

596
00:44:13,348 --> 00:44:15,976
- No, no.
- It's just that we're not gonna make out, okay?

597
00:44:16,084 --> 00:44:18,211
- Oh, no, I hadn't planned on trying...
- Oh, my...

598
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,845
I am so lame.
That was like really... I am...

599
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:23,116
I'm sorry.
Forget I just said that. I am...

600
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:25,158
That was dumb. And...

601
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,423
- You know what I do
when I feel completely unoriginal?
- What?

602
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:36,762
I make a noise or I do something
that no one has ever done before.

603
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:40,671
And then I can feel unique again
even if it's only for like a second.

604
00:44:40,775 --> 00:44:43,403
So, no one's
ever done that?

605
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:47,607
No, not in this spot. No. You just witnessed
a completely original moment in history.

606
00:44:47,716 --> 00:44:50,184
- It's refreshing. You should try it.
- Oh, no. Thanks.

607
00:44:50,285 --> 00:44:53,015
- No, come on.
- I think that was good enough for both of us.

608
00:44:53,121 --> 00:44:55,282
Come on.
What are you, shy?

609
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,688
<i>This is your one opportunity</i>
<i>to do something...</i>

610
00:44:57,792 --> 00:45:02,229
that no one has done before and that no one
will copy again throughout human existence.

611
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,733
A-And if nothing else, you'll be remembered
as the one guy who ever did this.

612
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:08,735
This one thing.

613
00:45:10,905 --> 00:45:13,396
Uh...

614
00:45:18,146 --> 00:45:20,046
How was that?

615
00:45:20,148 --> 00:45:22,378
Oh, I've done
that one before.

616
00:45:22,484 --> 00:45:23,885
So, uh...

617
00:45:23,885 --> 00:45:24,852
So, uh...

618
00:45:24,953 --> 00:45:27,922
I gotta go bury this hamster
before the dogs eat him.

619
00:45:28,022 --> 00:45:30,718
Wanna help? Hmm?

620
00:45:42,036 --> 00:45:45,335
- Wow.
- Yeah.

621
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,601
- I mean, this is, uh...
- I know.

622
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:50,769
<i>It's not that we're bad</i>
<i>pet owners or anything.</i>

623
00:45:50,879 --> 00:45:54,781
It's just, you know, we've had
so many of them over the years.

624
00:45:54,883 --> 00:45:57,147
Besides,
a lot of these are fish.

625
00:45:57,252 --> 00:45:59,345
After you.

626
00:46:07,529 --> 00:46:10,157
All right.

627
00:46:12,934 --> 00:46:14,834
Sit down.

628
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,035
What are you
thinking about?

629
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:27,842
- Now?
- Yeah.

630
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:30,975
- Right now?
- Yeah.

631
00:46:31,085 --> 00:46:34,919
Right now, I was thinking I've been
going to a lot of these things lately.

632
00:46:35,023 --> 00:46:37,457
- What, dates?
- Not dates.

633
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:40,585
Is this a date?
This isn't a date.

634
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:42,663
Funerals.

635
00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:44,698
Why? Who else died?

636
00:46:46,501 --> 00:46:48,731
Oh, uh...

637
00:46:48,837 --> 00:46:52,739
That's why I'm home actually. I guess
I haven't even told you that yet. Um...

638
00:46:56,978 --> 00:46:59,071
My mom just died.

639
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:07,280
God, that's weird
to say that out loud, but, uh...

640
00:47:08,456 --> 00:47:11,289
My mom just died.
And, uh...

641
00:47:11,392 --> 00:47:13,917
Yeah, that's why I'm home.

642
00:47:14,028 --> 00:47:16,394
I'm so sorry.

643
00:47:16,498 --> 00:47:18,523
God, I'm so sorry.

644
00:47:18,633 --> 00:47:21,500
<i>And here I am, like, putting you</i>
<i>through another one of these.</i>

645
00:47:21,603 --> 00:47:23,537
<i>Not that Jelly's like</i>
<i>anywhere near your mom's.</i>

646
00:47:23,638 --> 00:47:26,402
I mean,
we loved Jelly but...

647
00:47:26,508 --> 00:47:28,408
I'm so sorry.

648
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:31,240
No, it's okay.
It's all right.

649
00:47:31,346 --> 00:47:33,280
I'm all right with it.

650
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:36,043
Anyway, I think it's
what she wanted, so...

651
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,550
How'd she die?

652
00:47:40,154 --> 00:47:42,122
She drowned actually.

653
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:47,527
Yeah, my, uh...
My mother was a paraplegic.

654
00:47:47,629 --> 00:47:50,154
She was in a wheelchair
so she, uh...

655
00:47:50,265 --> 00:47:52,392
<i>You know, and, uh...</i>

656
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,593
I guess she was
taking a bath...

657
00:47:54,702 --> 00:47:56,693
and she must have
slipped or something.

658
00:47:56,804 --> 00:47:59,739
That's what they say.
I don't... I don't know. But...

659
00:47:59,841 --> 00:48:01,866
needless to say,
she drowned and...

660
00:48:01,976 --> 00:48:04,968
that's how she...
sh-she died.

661
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:07,479
When?

662
00:48:07,582 --> 00:48:09,982
This was, uh...

663
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:12,953
Sunday.

664
00:48:13,054 --> 00:48:15,352
Oh, my God.

665
00:48:20,929 --> 00:48:22,829
Why are <i>you</i> crying?

666
00:48:24,866 --> 00:48:26,834
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

667
00:48:28,169 --> 00:48:30,399
Because... I'm not
usually like this.

668
00:48:30,505 --> 00:48:34,999
It's just like...
It's just so sad.

669
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:37,669
You know, it's like...

670
00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:40,646
It's so tragic, isn't it?
It is. It's like...

671
00:48:40,748 --> 00:48:44,582
It's like real life
tragedy or something.

672
00:48:44,686 --> 00:48:47,621
Anyway, let's change
the subject, okay?

673
00:48:47,722 --> 00:48:49,815
Let's really bring
the focus back toJelly...

674
00:48:49,924 --> 00:48:53,018
'cause what could be ruder than talking
about someone else who died...

675
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:55,789
when you're in the act of
burying a close friend?

676
00:48:55,897 --> 00:49:00,095
- Well, what should we do?
- I don't know. I've only been
to one of these things.

677
00:49:00,201 --> 00:49:02,328
You appear to be
the expert.

678
00:49:02,437 --> 00:49:05,270
Well, we usually
say something.

679
00:49:05,373 --> 00:49:08,171
Okay, uh,
I'll go first. Um...

680
00:49:09,844 --> 00:49:13,245
Didn't really know you, Jelly.
From what I hear, you were a good pet.

681
00:49:13,348 --> 00:49:15,782
- Little trouble with the wheel but...
- That's not funny.

682
00:49:21,689 --> 00:49:23,680
Jelly, you were
a great pet.

683
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,020
I'm sorry I forgot to take
the wheel out of your cage.

684
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,894
I'm so, so sorry
about that.

685
00:49:32,934 --> 00:49:35,459
Good-bye.

686
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,731
I hope that you liked me.

687
00:50:21,115 --> 00:50:23,242
Holy shit! You scared
the shit out of me.

688
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:26,445
- Why are you always doing that?
- I haven't seen you in a while.

689
00:50:26,554 --> 00:50:28,954
I know. I've been catching up
with people around here.

690
00:50:29,057 --> 00:50:32,515
Dr. Cohen called.
There's nothing wrong with you.

691
00:50:32,627 --> 00:50:35,790
Yeah, I think I'm starting
to figure that out myself.

692
00:50:35,897 --> 00:50:39,628
- When are you thinking of leaving?
<i>- Uh, probably tomorrow.</i>

693
00:50:39,734 --> 00:50:43,898
Um, you know, I got a lot of stuff
I got to take care of in L.A.

694
00:50:44,005 --> 00:50:47,441
<i>- Probably have to find a newjob, so...</i>
- We need to talk.

695
00:50:48,743 --> 00:50:51,541
Yeah, uh, how?
I mean, when?

696
00:50:52,647 --> 00:50:55,241
What are you
doing... now?

697
00:50:57,018 --> 00:51:00,886
Uh, now's not so good. I told my friend Mark
I was gonna meet up with him.

698
00:51:00,988 --> 00:51:02,956
But how about, uh,
like later tonight?

699
00:51:03,057 --> 00:51:06,322
- Okay. Then we'll talk.
- Yeah.

700
00:51:06,427 --> 00:51:08,486
We owe that
to each other.

701
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:11,497
Yeah.

702
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,624
We owe it to her.

703
00:51:15,069 --> 00:51:17,503
Yeah.

704
00:51:17,605 --> 00:51:19,505
Good.

705
00:51:19,607 --> 00:51:21,541
Sorry I scared you.

706
00:51:24,378 --> 00:51:26,642
<i>How could you</i>
<i>leave all that lithium?</i>

707
00:51:26,748 --> 00:51:29,376
<i>I was totally going to</i>
<i>hit you up for some, man.</i>

708
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:32,817
<i>This fucking guy.</i>
<i>I'm glad you're back, man.</i>

709
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,686
<i>This town is so messed up.</i>
<i>Everyone's got their drug of choice.</i>

710
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:39,919
It's like in <i>Brave New World.</i>
You ever read that book?

711
00:51:40,027 --> 00:51:44,327
Who wrote that?
Um, Aldous... Aldous something.

712
00:51:44,432 --> 00:51:47,458
<i>Aldous, uh...</i>
<i>Anyway...</i>

713
00:51:47,568 --> 00:51:52,005
<i>there's like Alphas and Betas</i>
<i>and Epsilons and all sorts of people.</i>

714
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,954
<i>Huxtable.</i>

715
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:12,321
Aldous Huxtable.
That's it, bro.

716
00:52:27,503 --> 00:52:31,166
<i>Andrew, would you like</i>
<i>to see Sam's ice-skating tape?</i>

717
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,070
- Mom, no.
- Absolutely.

718
00:52:33,175 --> 00:52:36,576
She was so ahead of her time.
She could have gone to the Olympics.

719
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:38,670
No, no, no, no.
I couldn't have.

720
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:41,011
Yes, you could have.
Don't blame it on the epilepsy.

721
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,745
- You had a gift.
- Come on. Let me see it.

722
00:52:44,854 --> 00:52:48,620
<i>Let's just show him the "Florida Stars</i>
<i>of the Ice"opening. The gator costume.</i>

723
00:52:48,724 --> 00:52:52,854
- Mom, I'm asking you, seriously.
- Come on. Don't be shy. Let me see it!

724
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:57,194
<i>Oh, she wants you to see it. How could you</i>
<i>not want him to see how talented you are?</i>

725
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,632
- Were.
- Come on.

726
00:53:00,736 --> 00:53:03,227
- Come on.
- Ohh!

727
00:53:05,341 --> 00:53:07,969
- Honey, what are you doing?
- I'm dusting for prints.

728
00:53:08,077 --> 00:53:10,272
Well, could we move
the crime scene into the kitchen?

729
00:53:10,379 --> 00:53:12,279
I want to show Andrew
Sam's skating.

730
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:15,817
But someone's been pissing on my GameCube,
and I'm about to close the case.

731
00:53:15,918 --> 00:53:17,977
It wasn't me, Your Honor.

732
00:53:18,087 --> 00:53:20,555
The paw prints
point to a canine. Hmm.

733
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:22,817
<i>Andrew, come on.</i>
<i>Sit down here on the couch.</i>

734
00:53:22,925 --> 00:53:25,826
I can't believe you're
actually showing him this.

735
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:31,326
Look, there she is.

736
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:48,609
- You're the alligator?
<i>- You can tell by the hands.</i>

737
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:15,601
- Here comes the double axel.
- And...

738
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:20,045
- Land! Oh, I mean, come on. Is she good?
- Wow, she's great.

739
00:54:23,686 --> 00:54:26,712
- All right.
- Wow.

740
00:54:26,822 --> 00:54:30,121
- Shut up.
- No, I mean, your mom was right. You're really good.

741
00:54:31,994 --> 00:54:34,622
- This is awesome, but we gotta go.
- All right.

742
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,960
- I just wanted to show him how talented you are.
- Mom, come on!

743
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:38,829
My baby!
All right, go on!

744
00:54:38,934 --> 00:54:41,835
Go on. Get away.
Wait a minute.
