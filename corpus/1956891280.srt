1
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,289
Hi, I'm Ivan.

2
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,082
I'm a gorilla.

3
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,668
It's not as easy as it looks.

4
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,545
You'll see.

5
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:50,133
Out this window
is the billboard for my show.

6
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,511
I'm the headliner.
Which means I'm the star.

7
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,057
I look pretty ferocious, don't I?

8
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,727
I'm never really angry, but I can pretend.

9
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,811
That's my job.

10
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:07,192
For 20 years humans have come
from miles around to visit me

11
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,904
at the Big Top Mall
and Video Arcade at exit eight.

12
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,991
And this is our tent,
where we perform inside the mall.

13
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,493
It's pretty unique?

14
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,453
Welcome, one and all!

15
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,746
Step right up!

16
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,416
- Our show will commence in five minutes!
- Five.

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,878
This is Mack. I've known him
for as long as I can remember.

18
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,421
He's a little bit of a ham.

19
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,757
I thank you all for coming! Hello there!

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,301
I'm not sure the accent's foolin' anyone.

21
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:37,263
Welcome to the littlest big top on Earth!

22
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,476
Prepare yourselves for the most
marvelously majestic animal show,

23
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,104
the likes of which you have never seen!

24
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,733
Introducing Henrietta!

25
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,612
The best baseball-playing chicken
you've ever seen.

26
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,407
The batter is now approaching the plate.

27
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,118
She's got incredible
beak-eye coordination.

28
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,371
That's my girl!

29
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,081
Home run!

30
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,958
Frankie, the seal!

31
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,254
I will not drop the ball.
I'm gonna drop the ball.

32
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,339
He's a little, neurotic.

33
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,882
I'm gonna drop the ball.

34
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,719
But his act is always perfect.

35
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,345
Well done!

36
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,556
I didn't drop the ball!

37
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,683
- Here he comes.
- Murphy!

38
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,060
Rabbit in a fire truck!

39
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,438
Whee!

40
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,982
Murphy's always a big hit with the kids.

41
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:34,237
Now, the queen of the Big Top, Stella!

42
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,825
Stella is my oldest and wisest friend.

43
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,287
She's been performing
since before I was born.

44
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,831
She knows more than I'll ever know.

45
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,459
Now, where's my favorite poodle gone?

46
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,336
There's my cue.

47
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,339
Snickers brings a lot of class
to the show.

48
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,176
I love an audience.
Best part of the day.

49
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,260
Up you go, girl!

50
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,971
They nail their routine every time.

51
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,725
- Come on, Snickers. Let's do this.
- Okay, Stella. Ready when you are.

52
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,935
- Trunk up!
- There you go.

53
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,812
Magic.

54
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,482
- And this guy...
- Hey, pal.

55
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,733
Is my best buddy.

56
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,735
He's not supposed to be here, but he...

57
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,071
He sure makes himself at home.

58
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,783
Now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

59
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:24,329
I don't do any tricks.
Mack says it's enough for me to be me.

60
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,040
But I'm the headliner, so I come on last.

61
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,625
You've heard of the legend...

62
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,920
Sounds like a lot of pressure,
I know, but I love my job.

63
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,755
See him for yourselves!

64
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,298
Wait for it, wait for it...

65
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,301
The one and only Ivan!

66
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,555
Watch this.

67
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,350
I always get the kids.

68
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,604
And then a little chest thump.

69
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,191
That's pretty impressive?

70
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:59,906
The one and only Ivan!

71
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,660
And this is Julia.

72
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,914
She comes by my domain every night
because her father, George, works here.

73
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:13,003
She could sit anywhere,
but she always chooses to sit by me.

74
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,587
I think she likes me.

75
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,591
- What do you think, Ivan?
- How about that?

76
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,677
That's the real me right there.

77
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,264
Hey, Jules, that's a good one.

78
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,932
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,727
George, your girl's got
some serious talent.

80
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,813
She gets it from her mother.

81
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,274
Yeah, how's Sarah doing?

82
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,527
She has her good days and bad days.

83
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,612
And these things, they take time.

84
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,448
Yeah.

85
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,451
Jules,

86
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,830
why don't you go buy yourself
some new crayons?

87
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,875
You don't need to do that, Mack.

88
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,002
No, I... I'd like to.

89
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,089
What do you say, Julia?

90
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,133
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

91
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,721
Go quick, all right? We gotta get going.

92
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,560
School's out soon.
Things always pick up then.

93
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,854
Yeah. It'll pick up.

94
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:13,938
Yeah.

95
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,693
This ain't good, kid.

96
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,323
This won't even begin to cover
food and rent.

97
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,786
We gotta pack 'em in again.
Get the excitement back, you know?

98
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,831
If we don't, it's over.

99
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,543
Then what are we gonna do?

100
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,384
Great.

101
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,053
Asking a gorilla for advice.

102
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,606
"Get the excitement back"?

103
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:11,538
Don't you just love the moon,
with its untroubled smile?

104
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,456
I prefer the sun.

105
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,667
I love the feel of sun on my belly.

106
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,295
It is an impressive belly, my friend.

107
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,007
- Thank you.
- Somebody loves sleeping on it.

108
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,511
You know, the first night
he snuck in here he was half this size.

109
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,848
He was adorable.
I dreamt I ate a furry doughnut.

110
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,896
Stella, you remember when this place
was packed with people?

111
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,025
Three shows a day. Standing room only.

112
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,651
I remember.

113
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,654
You think it's not like that anymore
because of me?

114
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,240
Do you think I've lost my edge?

115
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,452
I mean, if they want an angry gorilla,
I can still be that.

116
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,457
Why do they want an angry gorilla anyway?

117
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,834
I think humans like us one way.

118
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,670
And gorillas they see as angry.

119
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,050
My father used to say, "Anger is precious.

120
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,762
Use it to keep order
and warn others of danger."

121
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,349
But here, there's no one to protect.

122
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,393
Sometimes it's hard to roar for no reason.

123
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,478
I know.

124
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,980
I didn't touch the kibble. It wasn't me.

125
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,357
Hi.

126
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,068
- Hi.
. Hi.

127
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,112
Are you guys talking about me?

128
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,989
'Cause whatever it is, I didn't do it.

129
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,157
No.

130
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,868
Back to my dream.

131
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,620
Tasty.

132
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,040
Well, don't worry, you'll see.

133
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,542
I'm the headliner. I got this.

134
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,337
I'm gonna fix the show.

135
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,505
Yes.

136
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,883
You will, my friend.

137
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,719
You are the headliner.

138
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,059
Let's give 'em a great show, okay?

139
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,355
We're in this together, kid.
I know we can turn this around.

140
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,235
That's my boy.

141
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,612
All right, curtain up in ten minutes.

142
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,448
- All right, Murph. Showtime.
- It's all under control.

143
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,534
It's all under control.

144
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,204
Do the words "Bird for sale"
mean anything to you? Do they?

145
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,581
- "Bird for sale"?
- Yeah, well, just remember that.

146
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,969
- That is our show.
- Nailed it.

147
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,971
I hope you enjoyed yourselves.

148
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,682
- Still, not a lot of people out there.
- Thank you. Ta-ta!

149
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,363
Ivan!

150
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,283
I have something for you.

151
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,663
Sometimes when I'm drawing,
I see you watching me.

152
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,832
I just got some new crayons.

153
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,626
So, I thought maybe
you'd like my old ones?

154
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:05,754
Here.

155
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,964
They're a little broken.

156
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,887
- You good?
- Yeah.

157
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,222
All right. Let's go, honey.

158
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,640
Good night, Ivan.

159
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,559
Good night, Uncle Mack!

160
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,894
Night.

161
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,361
What are you gonna do with that?

162
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,529
I'm not sure.

163
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,782
I'd probably eat it.

164
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,535
- It's a crayon.
- I know it's a crayon.

165
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,330
Listen.

166
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,667
- It's raining kibble up there.
- I'm starvin'.

167
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,753
- Don't you wish you could have some?
- It's like a dream come true.

168
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,963
Let's hope he's not
hangin' around tonight.

169
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,175
All right.
See you in the morning, Snickers.

170
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,510
Bingo.

171
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,429
- You better hide.
- He's never gonna catch me.

172
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,932
He's comin'.
You're skating on thin ice, buddy.

173
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,266
That dog!

174
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,727
- Castello!
- I told ya.

175
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,020
Castello!

176
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,689
Yeah, Mack, what's up?

177
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:06,773
What's up?

178
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,817
My blood pressure.

179
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,276
Are you kidding me?

180
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,447
How many times have I gotta tell you
to get that mutt outta here?

181
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:18,118
Look, your job
is to keep our animals in their cages

182
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,537
and all other animals out!

183
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,916
The last thing we need around here
is another mouth to feed.

184
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,835
You got it, Mack. It's under control.

185
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,129
- It's all under control.
- Sure it is.

186
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,923
Under control. It's all under control.

187
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,109
Ha.

188
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,193
Loser.

189
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,618
Crayons.

190
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,204
What would I draw anyway?

191
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,294
Hello, Mr. Beetle.

192
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,642
Wha...

193
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,230
- What is it? A flying cow?
- No.

194
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,482
- Is it a hand?
- Nah.

195
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,109
- Hands are so tough to get right.
- Really?

196
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,402
- Is it Tennessee?
- No.

197
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,612
- Kansas.
- Boy.

198
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,113
- Is that me?
- Wh-What?

199
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,366
- Did you draw a picture of me?
- No.

200
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,619
- I know! It's a burrito.
- No, it's not a burrito. It's a...

201
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,288
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

202
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:50,126
It's a lonely haystack
on a late summer day.

203
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,130
It's a beetle.

204
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,885
A beetle?
I never would've guessed.

205
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,014
A beetle.
Right, there are the legs. I see the legs.

206
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,974
- Thanks for the raisins.
- You're welcome.

207
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,894
- Here, you want one?
- You know I can't eat raisins.

208
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,240
- Morning, Mike.
- Mack.

209
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,954
- What's going on?
- I might have better luck at the galleria.

210
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:29,207
No, Mike. That's a mistake.
That's a... That's a big mistake.

211
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,127
Things will be picking up
around here in no time.

212
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,337
You know, it's ebb and flow.

213
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,716
I know all about the ebb.
I haven't seen the flow in a while.

214
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,384
Yeah.

215
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,970
Well, good luck.

216
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,055
You too.

217
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,444
And that is our show.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

218
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,822
Please, do remember to tell your friends.

219
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,867
If you please?
And thank you again for coming.

220
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,951
Ta-ta.

221
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,583
Ho! This is the game changer
we've been waiting for.

222
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,170
"Made my day"? You've made my year!

223
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll see you in the morning.

224
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,631
And thank you.

225
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,428
Hey, Ivan.
My heart's still racing from your show.

226
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,099
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean, that was real rage, right?

227
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,976
Whatcha do, stick pins in your feet?

228
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,020
No. I was acting.

229
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,939
What? You should be teaching a class.

230
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,649
Thanks, man.

231
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,859
Look what I drew.

232
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,946
- What's this?
- Aw, look at that.

233
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,074
I know you're not really meant to be here,

234
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,368
but now you're not just any dog.

235
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,078
You have a name.

236
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,705
- Bob.
- That's nice.

237
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,707
A little presumptuous, don't you think?

238
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,292
What's "presumptuous" mean?

239
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,171
Whoa.

240
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,176
- Dad, come look at this!
- Here comes the old man.

241
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,260
Get outta here.

242
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,054
Look what Ivan drew.

243
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,723
Look at that.
He made a little scribble?

244
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,183
It's not a scribble.

245
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,851
It's a beetle.

246
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:14,938
He drew a beetle.

247
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:20,485
Well, I guess you need
an artist's eye to see it?

248
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,569
Like yours?

249
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,240
- You ready to go home to Mom?
- Yeah.

250
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,950
All right, say your good nights.

251
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:28,993
Night, Ivan.

252
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,666
Night, Bob.

253
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,214
Did you call the little dog "Bob"?

254
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,717
Yeah, that's his name.

255
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,051
"Bob"?

256
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,305
Why do they think
they can go around naming everything?

257
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,226
If she weren't so cute,
I'd nip her on the nose.

258
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,738
This is gonna be exciting.
Today is the day!

259
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,240
You wanna come with me, Snickers?

260
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,367
- Where're they going?
- All right.

261
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,912
Curiosity killed the cat, but fed the dog.

262
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:16,332
Operation Kibble, go!

263
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,251
We're in.

264
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,795
There it is.

265
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:25,717
Kibble. Alone at last.

266
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,553
Whoa. That feels good.

267
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,057
Soft.

268
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,728
So this is how it feels.

269
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,606
So relaxing.

270
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,690
Ooh!

271
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,858
Was that me?

272
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,615
She won't mind. Okay, where was I?

273
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,993
Now we're talking.

274
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,330
Yeah.

275
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,873
Enjoying yourself?

276
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,042
Hey, Snickers, you're back.

277
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,753
Time for a shampoo?

278
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,505
That you're never gonna see.

279
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,173
Come on.

280
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,926
Why don't you just give in to domesticity?

281
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,388
'Cause I... I like my freedom,
thank you very much.

282
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,765
May I?

283
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:18,311
Well, then, you'll just have to keep on
eating leftovers and sleeping on cement.

284
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,689
I never sleep on cement.

285
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,107
I sleep on Ivan.

286
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:26,653
Speaking of which, I gotta go get him
pumped up for the show.

287
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,030
- No, there is no show.
- What?

288
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,032
- The show's been canceled.
- Why?

289
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:34,160
Well, there's a new animal
being delivered.

290
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,623
Don't tell anyone. They might get upset.

291
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,668
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is just between you and me.

292
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,714
Ivan! The show's canceled!

293
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,757
- Canceled?
- New animal being delivered.

294
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,219
New animal on the way!
New animal is coming!

295
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,054
Hey, a new animal, Stella.

296
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,889
- A new animal?
- Yeah!

297
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,475
You've gotta love him.

298
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,311
Henrietta, Murphy,
we got a new friend coming.

299
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,771
- Ooh!
- Hey, party time.

300
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,774
- Where're we gonna put him?
- Keep that ball in the air, Frankie.

301
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,276
We got a new animal comin'.

302
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,445
Like I'm not under enough pressure.

303
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,655
Hey, Ivan, could be another gorilla.

304
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,491
- You think?
- Maybe it's a new species.

305
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,661
Flying squirrels or singing mice.

306
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:17,746
In that thing?

307
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,999
Here it is. It's a big day!

308
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,834
A big day. Come on, let's open it up.

309
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,253
Am I being replaced?

310
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:29,174
Frankie, you can't be replaced.
You've got a unique talent.

311
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:30,633
Thank you.

312
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,514
Ooh.

313
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,602
Wow.

314
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:44,314
I hate surprises. I can't look.

315
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,398
Hi there.

316
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,361
Aren't you the cutest little thing?

317
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,071
Hi. Yes.

318
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,367
I'm starting to like this animal.

319
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,369
George?

320
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,746
I think I'm gonna need some help.

321
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:05,752
Yeah, look at that, George.
She knows what to do.

322
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,134
That's right, Stella.

323
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,006
A baby.

324
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:55,969
Aw.

325
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,811
You see that?

326
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,444
Hey there. How you doin'?

327
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,658
Look at Stella. I knew she'd do it.

328
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,326
Great job, honey.

329
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,328
I was hoping for a lady bunny.

330
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,247
Hey.

331
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,332
- That's amazing.
- It's a great idea, Mack.

332
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,836
Yeah, and I got her cheap too.
From a bankrupt circus in New Jersey.

333
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:37,177
- Everybody loves baby animals.
- Yeah.

334
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,763
Welcome to your new home.

335
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,389
Her name is Ruby.

336
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,850
She's never performed,

337
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:47,604
but she's gonna
turn this show around in no time.

338
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,688
Look at her.

339
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,816
She's just what we needed.

340
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,277
Bless you.

341
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,490
Ruby, Ruby. So sweet, so sweet.

342
00:19:58,573 --> 00:19:59,824
Cutie patootie.

343
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,202
She is the cutest.

344
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,495
Does she have any talent,

345
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:06,206
or are they just gonna
put her in a fire truck like you?

346
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,958
Hey! Watch it, chicken.

347
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,176
She's gonna turn this show around?

348
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:40,281
- Are you a monkey?
- Am I a what?

349
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,075
Are you a monkey?

350
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,869
What are you... No, I'm a gorilla.

351
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,956
Where are the other gorillas?

352
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:50,333
There are no other gorillas.

353
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,461
Well... who's that?

354
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:57,173
That's Not-Tag.
Don't touch her. She's not real.

355
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,843
Why is she named Not-Tag?

356
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:00,969
It's a long story.

357
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:05,223
- Ooh, I love stories!
- I'm sure you do, but I'm-I'm busy.

358
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,808
You don't look busy.

359
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,435
Looks are deceiving.

360
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,188
I'm sorry there are no other gorillas.

361
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,858
Well, I'm not.
'Cause it's always just been me.

362
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,445
"The One and Only Ivan."
That's what it says on the billboard.

363
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,697
Ivan's always been the headliner here.

364
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,407
You hear that? The headliner.

365
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,784
Wow! Why?

366
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:28,288
Because he's a silverback.
He terrifies humans.

367
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,707
You're not terrifying.

368
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,793
Yeah, I am. I'm very scary.

369
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,628
So, you know, run along,

370
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,340
before I start thumping
and roaring with rage.

371
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:49,684
And now,
the moment you've all been waiting for.

372
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:52,062
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not finished.

373
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,397
Our new headliner.

374
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,482
What?

375
00:21:55,565 --> 00:22:00,528
Introducing
the new addition to the family, Ruby!

376
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,157
Aw!

377
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,456
- Hello, Ruby.
- She's coming towards us.

378
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,640
Go, Ruby!

379
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,725
I've never heard applause
like that before.

380
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,644
They even clapped extra for me.

381
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:35,689
That little angel is the best thing
that could ever happen to us.

382
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,649
- Ivan?
- Shh. Sleeping.

383
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,859
Why does the rabbit drive a fire truck?

384
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:40,944
Sleeping.

385
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:44,280
- Why does the seal worry so much?
- Go back to bed, Ruby.

386
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,200
- Ever seen a lion? I have...
- Is this kid for real?

387
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,743
- Know any jokes?
- I...

388
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:49,953
I do.

389
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,664
How do you know
an elephant has been in the refrigerator?

390
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,333
Footprints in the butter!

391
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,086
Isn't that funny?

392
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,922
I'm hungry. I love carrots.

393
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,382
What's your favorite food?

394
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,051
Tell her. It might shut her up.

395
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,054
Yogurt raisins.

396
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,474
All right. I'm gonna let go.

397
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,185
Whoa.

398
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:19,607
We gotta look our best today.
Just like old times.

399
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,824
Who's next? What would you like?

400
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,326
Here to see Baby Ruby?

401
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,370
- There you are, young lady.
- New star.

402
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,873
- Nice to see you. Thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

403
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:37,250
Perfect! Enjoy the show.

404
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,510
She's a flash in the pan.

405
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:50,722
Babies don't stay babies forever.

406
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,474
Your appeal is timeless.

407
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:55,018
It's not the baby's job to save the troop.

408
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,520
It's the job of a silverback.

409
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:58,938
It's my job.

410
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,858
I don't think she got the memo.

411
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:14,579
Hi, baby.

412
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:18,291
You're doing so well in the show.
Everybody's coming to see you.

413
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,213
Hey, Stella.
Isn't it amazing how big the crowds are?

414
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:31,888
Dad.

415
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,515
Dad!

416
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:34,599
Yeah?

417
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,560
Stella's doing something funny
with her foot again.

418
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,357
Mack!

419
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,236
What is it?

420
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:48,947
It is a bit swollen.

421
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,283
Is it tender?

422
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,453
All right, lift.

423
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,747
Let's take a look here.

424
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,668
Well... Something's not right.

425
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:05,880
It's okay, Stella. It's okay, girl.

426
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,092
Well,

427
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,678
I don't see anything, but...

428
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:17,183
she could have something lodged in there
or could be an infection.

429
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,061
And she does seem to be hurting.

430
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,148
Make sure there's aspirin
in her food tonight.

431
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,401
The vet will be here
first thing in the morning.

432
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:30,488
You hang tough, sister. We need you.

433
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,748
She'll be all right.
She's a strong old girl, okay?

434
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,126
Okay, Stella, let's rest now.

435
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,176
All right! Come on!

436
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,136
Come on!

437
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:59,392
You're doing so great in the show, Ruby.

438
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,520
Thanks, Aunt Stella.
I'm sorry about your foot.

439
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:06,649
It's just tired of carrying me around
all these years.

440
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,194
Now, would you like to hear another story?

441
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:12,030
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

442
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,034
Hey, why'd you do that?

443
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:19,662
This is a good one
from when I was a baby in the wild.

444
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,165
One day...

445
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,834
I was out looking for water...

446
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:28,755
when I slipped and fell into a hole

447
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:31,174
and got stuck in some very deep mud.

448
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,636
- Just then, a little girl...
- Like Julia!

449
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,180
Just like Julia... heard my cries.

450
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,766
She told her whole village,

451
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:43,395
and together they all came and freed me.

452
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,146
Wow!

453
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,815
Humans did that?

454
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:47,899
I don't believe it.

455
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:49,984
Not all humans are bad.

456
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,028
They can surprise you.

457
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:58,118
Are all animals free in the wild?

458
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,202
Yes.

459
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:03,081
Well... will we ever be free?

460
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:08,044
There are places, not very far from here.

461
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:09,879
Safe places.

462
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:13,925
With trees, and grass, and lakes.

463
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,178
Where animals can roam free.

464
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:20,098
- The wild.
- Like the wild.

465
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,934
Where humans make amends.

466
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:29,149
Now, let's try to get some sleep.

467
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,567
Okay.

468
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,485
- Good night.
- Good night.

469
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:36,448
Good night, Ivan.

470
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:37,532
Wh...

471
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,410
Good night.

472
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,711
- Ivan! Showtime.
- Ivan. Showtime.

473
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,379
Hey, Mack.

474
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,632
I'm not sure Stella should go on.

475
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:56,509
Really?

476
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:59,304
She's not putting any weight on it.

477
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:03,975
That's not good.
All right, let's let her rest.

478
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:05,977
I'll call the vet again after the show.

479
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:07,937
Ruby.

480
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:10,523
Attagirl.

481
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,984
You're gonna be flying solo today.

482
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:16,654
You can do it. Right, sweetheart?

483
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:17,822
She'll be fine.

484
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:24,871
I'm not sure this is a good idea,
Aunt Stella.

485
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,123
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

486
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:30,794
the tiny tyke
you've all been waiting for.

487
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:33,254
I can't do it without you. I'm scared.

488
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:35,924
Ivan, she's gonna miss her cue.

489
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,008
What?

490
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,886
Ruby!

491
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:44,307
- I-I won't know what to do.
- I'll be watching.

492
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,726
Listen, kid. You gotta go out there.

493
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,103
I-I can't do it.

494
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:50,605
Hey, they're here to see you.
You can't let everyone down.

495
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:52,899
But I'm scared.

496
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:57,946
Ruby!

497
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,952
Listen to me. They're gonna love you.

498
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:06,705
Really? Are you sure?

499
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:10,125
Sure, I'm sure.
You don't even have to do anything.

500
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:12,919
Just stand out there and be you.

501
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:18,008
Shall we try it again?
Ladies and gentlemen, Ruby!

502
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:20,468
Come on.

503
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,805
You can do it.

504
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:34,941
Peekaboo.

505
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,904
Aw!

506
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:41,239
Look at you.

507
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,741
Hello.

508
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:45,660
Come on out and say hello to everyone.

509
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:51,041
All these lovely boys and girls
have come to say hello to you.

510
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:55,295
Yes, they have. Hello there.

511
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:58,340
Hello, little lady.

512
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:03,553
Ruby!

513
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,932
Well, she did it.

514
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:10,643
She did.

515
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:29,037
Hey, Ruby. You can't sleep?

516
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:30,914
I'm hungry.

517
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:33,083
Well...

518
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,585
how about I...

519
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,380
I'll draw you a carrot.

520
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:40,840
To tide you over until you get a real one.

521
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:43,718
You know how to draw?

522
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:47,055
Yeah. But don't tell anybody.

523
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:49,057
- Why?
- Because I'm a silverback.

524
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,141
So?

525
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:53,937
So just don't say anything, because...
Well, then everybody will want one.

526
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,815
Then what am I gonna do?
Then I got no time to be ferocious.

527
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:58,983
Wow!

528
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,319
That's a great carrot.

529
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:03,071
It'll just be our secret, okay?

530
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:04,781
Okay. I love secrets.

531
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,241
- Promise?
- I promise.

532
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,411
- Aunt Stella!
- No, no, no, no!

533
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:11,996
Shh, shh, shh, shh. D-Don't wake her.

534
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:14,833
- Do you wanna hear a story?
- Yes, please.

535
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:17,544
Like one of Stella's stories,
from when you were little.

536
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:19,713
Well...

537
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,216
I don't remember things
from when I was little, I...

538
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,300
Yeah.

539
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:28,179
He's the total opposite of an elephant.
He can't remember a thing.

540
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,433
- You wanna hear about my life?
- Yes.

541
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,393
Okay.

542
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,228
Well, I was living a pretty good life

543
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:38,481
until I was abandoned in the streets
by a mean human being.

544
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:42,902
Then I fell off a bridge into a river
and almost drowned.

545
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:45,113
That's it. End of story. Now go to sleep.

546
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:48,491
Okay. That's... Thanks.
That's not a bedtime story.

547
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:51,244
Guess not.
It's got a happy ending though.

548
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:54,122
I ended up here with you,
my best buddy ole pal.

549
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,210
Okay, Ruby,
I think I might have a story for ya.

550
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:01,755
- Really?
- Yeah.

551
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:05,592
Okay. All right.

552
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:06,676
Um...

553
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,891
So, once there was
a little baby gorilla named...

554
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:13,975
Ivan!

555
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:18,688
Yeah. Okay. Ivan.

556
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:22,359
- There you go.
- And little Ivan, he wore diapers.

557
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:23,943
And he drank from a bottle.

558
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,362
We're rolling.

559
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:28,239
And he had two nice human friends
that adopted him.

560
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:29,407
Come here.

561
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,785
They spent every waking minute together.

562
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,996
What're you lookin' at? Your papa?

563
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,998
He lived in a nice house.

564
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,793
And he slept in human beds.

565
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:42,462
And he was loved.

566
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:48,635
And he was so lucky 'cause he got
to go to restaurants, and baseball games,

567
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:52,138
and movie theaters, and playgrounds.

568
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:55,058
- Higher!
- Playgrounds were his favorite.

569
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:58,103
People stared, but he never even noticed.

570
00:32:58,186 --> 00:33:00,897
Felt like the whole world
was his playground.

571
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,232
Ready? Smile.

572
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:04,984
- Back before Mack thought of the show...
- Perfect.

573
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:07,737
It was just a young gorilla
in a photo booth.

574
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:11,866
But still, people came from far and wide
to see the young gorilla.

575
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,703
- And who's next?
- It was a nice life.

576
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:18,123
But the little gorilla did
what gorillas do.

577
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:23,545
- He made mess. A lot of messes.
- What have you done? My gosh.

578
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,797
Hey. He found the cake, honey.

579
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,965
I can see that.

580
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:29,426
He turned the world into his playground.

581
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:30,885
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

582
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:32,929
No.

583
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:36,224
Little Ivan had a lot of freedom,
and he enjoyed it.

584
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:40,562
Sometimes his human friends
would get very upset.

585
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:44,232
And the little gorilla didn't know why.

586
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:47,318
Helen?

587
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:50,113
One of 'em got so upset, she left.

588
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:53,199
And she never came back.

589
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,044
- And then one day, he came here.
- Go ahead.

590
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:08,089
He had a new home built just for him.

591
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:11,968
And he's been here ever since.

592
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,347
Good night, Ruby.

593
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:19,934
Ivan?

594
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:26,816
I need you to promise me something.

595
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:28,610
Anything.

596
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,406
I need you to take care of Ruby.

597
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,702
I can't be here for her.

598
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:43,625
I want her to have a life
different from mine.

599
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,754
I want her to be free.

600
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,883
In a safe place. Not...

601
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,426
Not here.

602
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,928
Not a cage.

603
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:57,138
Promise me.

604
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,477
I promise, Stella.

605
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,773
On my word as a silverback, I promise.

606
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:11,111
Thank you, Ivan.

607
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:23,123
Goodbye.

608
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:15,902
Come on. Get it together.

609
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,507
You're on your own now, Ruby.

610
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,177
So,

611
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,806
we gotta work on your act?

612
00:37:48,226 --> 00:37:49,477
We'll start tomorrow.

613
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:55,150
Good night, girl.

614
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:30,810
How is she? How's-How's Ruby?

615
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:32,228
Better now.

616
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:35,106
I told her not to worry
'cause you were gonna save her.

617
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:37,650
What? What are you talking about?

618
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:39,986
You promised Stella
you were gonna get Ruby outta here.

619
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,237
Are you outta your mind?

620
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:44,741
So she could be free.
Have a great life. Remember?

621
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:48,119
Anyway, that cheered her up.
She fell right to sleep.

622
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:49,913
Shouldn't have even made that promise.

623
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:53,333
How am I supposed to get her outta here?
And where would we go?

624
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:57,504
And what about Mack?
Yeah, he's taken care of me my whole life.

625
00:38:58,588 --> 00:38:59,881
You'll figure it out.

626
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:04,094
You're the one and only Ivan. Remember?

627
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:05,178
Nah.

628
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:12,018
Say it.

629
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,271
Go on. Say it.

630
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,235
I'm the one and only Ivan.

631
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:25,073
And don't you ever forget it.

632
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:42,674
Scoot over.

633
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:51,266
She's up there.

634
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:53,893
Can you see her smiling?

635
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:03,528
It's 'cause she knows
you're gonna figure this out.

636
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:30,221
Come on. Quit it, will ya?

637
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:33,725
It's disgusting.

638
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:36,895
Ivan. You're gonna wanna see this.

639
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:38,438
What is it?

640
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,401
- Come on!
- Okay.

641
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:51,201
You're gonna need to learn a few tricks,
Ruby. Just like Stella.

642
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:52,869
It'll be fun.

643
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,122
No, come on back. Right here.

644
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:58,792
There we go. Nice, big, even circle.

645
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:00,543
All right?

646
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:05,590
Yes. There you go. Nicely done.

647
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:08,343
Good, good, good, good. There you go.

648
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:11,763
Keep going. Attagirl. You can do it.

649
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:15,141
There you go. Okay, come on.
You can get this. Trunk up.

650
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:20,355
Come on, you gotta do this on your own,
Ruby. Trunk up.

651
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:22,399
Here we go. No, no, no. Here, trunk up.

652
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:26,361
And keep it up.
Come on, Ruby, it's not that hard.

653
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:29,364
Let's do this again
like you did this morning. Lift.

654
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:32,826
Lift. No, right here. Lift.

655
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:37,580
Lift. That's it! We're finally
making progress. Okay, right leg. Lift.

656
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:42,168
Up. You're gonna have to learn to balance
on this. Here we go. Lift. Come on.

657
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:45,380
That's it. No, no, no, no, no, no.
That one stays up.

658
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:47,674
Left. No, no, no. Where're you going?

659
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:49,009
Where're you going? Ruby.

660
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:56,558
Come on. Here we go.
Right here. Let's try again.

661
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:58,309
Lift. Lift.

662
00:41:58,393 --> 00:41:59,936
Lift! That's it.

663
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,188
Dad, she looks tired.

664
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:05,150
Yeah, well, hey. We're all tired, right?

665
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:09,779
I mean, am I the only one who understands
that we got to make a living here?

666
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:14,826
Okay, let's go. Other foot. Here we go.
Lift. Lift, lift.

667
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,247
Hey, Mack? Hey, let's call it a day.
I'll take Ruby back.

668
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,999
- You can take a break.
- No.

669
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:24,544
We're finally making progress here.
No, I am not giving up now.

670
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:26,838
And we are not canceling
any more shows either.

671
00:42:26,921 --> 00:42:28,923
No, Ruby. Ruby, no, no, no, come on.

672
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:30,508
Don't sit. No, no, no.

673
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:33,011
- Okay. Put our things away.
- Come on. Come on.

674
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:36,056
No. Come here. We got to get up.

675
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:38,933
Come on. Let's go. Ruby. Come on. Up.

676
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:41,102
Let's get up. Come on. You gotta get up.

677
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:44,147
Come on. No, come on.
You gotta get up. You gotta learn this.

678
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,274
- Mack.
- Ruby. No, come on. We can do this.

679
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:47,692
Come on. Get up.

680
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:54,783
What?

681
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:55,867
Wow.

682
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,295
Holy moly.

683
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:31,319
Wow. Look at all those drawings.

684
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:34,823
I always kinda figured you were an artist.

685
00:43:34,906 --> 00:43:37,033
I think we're all a little artsy.

686
00:43:37,575 --> 00:43:41,621
Sometimes I arrange my popcorn
on the floor in cute little patterns.

687
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:43,373
Hey! Why'd you do that?

688
00:43:43,456 --> 00:43:44,916
Yeow!

689
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,251
So gentle.

690
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:47,335
Shh!

691
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:49,671
Can you tell what this is?

692
00:43:50,922 --> 00:43:53,341
A Cheeto?

693
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:54,634
No.

694
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:56,052
A wig? Mack's wig?

695
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:57,887
Mack's w... What?

696
00:43:57,971 --> 00:43:59,514
A mountain range?

697
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:00,849
It's a key.

698
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,438
I need to get Julia to give me the key.

699
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:10,025
If I had that,
I could free Ruby from her cage.

700
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:11,693
Cool!

701
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:14,279
- And then what?
- I don't know. We'd go.

702
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:16,197
- Go where?
- We'd just go.

703
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:17,699
Where you gonna go?

704
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:24,039
The forest.

705
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:29,794
You know, the forest.
On the other side of the highway.

706
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:31,546
- The forest.
- Yeah.

707
00:44:31,629 --> 00:44:33,298
- Perfect.
- That's all we need.

708
00:44:33,381 --> 00:44:35,258
- Yeah!
- Trees, grass.

709
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:38,136
Right. We're wild animals.
That's where we belong.

710
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:39,220
That's right.

711
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:40,680
Ivan?

712
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:42,432
Hey. Ruby.

713
00:44:42,932 --> 00:44:44,434
Sorry, did we wake you up?

714
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:46,519
Do you wanna hear a story?

715
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:48,855
Aw. Yes, please.

716
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:50,982
Okay.

717
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:53,526
So, once there was a...

718
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:55,820
a baby elephant.

719
00:44:56,446 --> 00:44:58,907
Who was smart and brave.

720
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:02,202
But she lived in a small domain.

721
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:05,955
And she needed to live in the wild,
where she could be free.

722
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:10,251
Does the baby elephant get to be free?

723
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:20,261
Yes, because she had a friend.

724
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:22,138
A friend who made a promise.

725
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,481
Hi, Henrietta.

726
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,566
Hi, Frankie.

727
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:35,610
Hi, Ivan.

728
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:38,405
Whoa.

729
00:45:42,283 --> 00:45:43,993
Did you draw all these?

730
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:47,038
Ivan, these are amazing.

731
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:49,874
That looks like a...

732
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:51,876
- Hey, you.
- Hey, Mack.

733
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:54,587
- New drawings?
- Yeah.

734
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:56,464
- May I?
- Sure.

735
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:04,097
- Did you draw these?
- No.

736
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,558
Ivan drew 'em.

737
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:09,352
Did he?

738
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:13,314
You know, actually, these aren't too bad.

739
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:14,899
How about that?

740
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,277
A gorilla who draws.

741
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,491
Gorilla that can draw.

742
00:46:25,368 --> 00:46:28,747
A gorilla who draws!

743
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,123
Ha!

744
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:32,542
- Now that's somethin'! Boy!
- Dad.

745
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:34,544
Dad, I told you Ivan can draw. Look.

746
00:46:34,627 --> 00:46:37,797
The press is gonna eat this up!

747
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:40,967
A gorilla who can actually draw?
Now, that's like... Mwah!

748
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,719
- Aw.
- That's a game changer!

749
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:43,803
Game changer.

750
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:47,307
"Ivan the Artistic Ape"?

751
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,313
The owner of the animal show here
at the Big Top Mall and Video Arcade

752
00:46:53,396 --> 00:46:57,108
earlier this week gave some crayons
to the show's silverback gorilla.

753
00:46:57,192 --> 00:47:00,403
People have been coming from far and wide
to see the result.

754
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:01,988
Is that you, Ivan?

755
00:47:02,072 --> 00:47:03,156
Wha...

756
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:06,493
Hey, Ivan. Take a look at this.

757
00:47:06,576 --> 00:47:08,912
Crowd's even bigger than the old days.

758
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:10,622
That is you!

759
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:16,586
Twice as many as yesterday.

760
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:22,175
Ivan. Ivan!

761
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:24,302
Can you hear that crowd?

762
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:25,512
We're a hit!

763
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:28,515
We can keep this show going forever!

764
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:31,851
Ha-ha! You're a headliner again.

765
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,645
All right, come on, let's do this.

766
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:36,773
No forehead?

767
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:41,903
All right, we can do it later.
Because right now, it's showtime.

768
00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:42,987
Ha-ha.

769
00:47:50,662 --> 00:47:54,374
And now,
the moment you've all been waiting for!

770
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,209
Our final act.

771
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:59,087
The Artistic Ape from Exit Eight.

772
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,923
The one and only Ivan!

773
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:10,265
What will he draw today?

774
00:48:11,307 --> 00:48:16,521
Your silence is appreciated,
because here is the magic!

775
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:28,658
Any moment...

776
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,997
the magic will be here.

777
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:50,680
My. Let's try again, shall we?

778
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:54,934
Ladies and gentlemen, the magic is here!

779
00:48:58,521 --> 00:49:01,483
In the gift shop!

780
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:04,819
One of Ivan's original paintings
can be yours.

781
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:09,032
Each one signed
with his trademark thumbprint.

782
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:12,452
What the heck was that?

783
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:15,747
A baby elephant
isn't gonna turn things around for us.

784
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:20,502
This is our chance. You are our chance!

785
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:23,421
So, come on! Start the...

786
00:49:25,256 --> 00:49:27,801
What the heck? No.

787
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:30,387
- Castello!
- Yeah?

788
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:31,513
Get over here!

789
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:35,767
Come here.

790
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,686
What's that?

791
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:39,813
If I ever see that dog again,

792
00:49:39,896 --> 00:49:42,357
I'm never gonna see you again,
because you will be fired!

793
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,441
You understand?

794
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:47,028
Copy that, Mack. No idea
how he got past me. I'm sorry, boss.

795
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:49,781
Just... get him outta here.

796
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:04,129
It's too bad you can't have it all.

797
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:08,174
You can have your freedom, but you gotta
live by your wits with no security.

798
00:50:08,258 --> 00:50:10,051
Or you can have security,

799
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:12,971
but you're stuck in a cage all day,
doing tricks for humans.

800
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:14,305
It's a tough call.

801
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:16,933
Bob, I have a plan.

802
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:19,310
You just... You just called me Bob.

803
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:20,687
Yeah. Kinda fits ya.

804
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,981
- You think? "Bob"?
- Yeah.

805
00:50:23,064 --> 00:50:26,443
Bob. Bob-o. Bobby-dog.

806
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:29,529
- Hey, Bab-ay. Bobby, Bobby.
- Hey! Focus.

807
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:32,949
For this plan to work,
I'm gonna need your help.

808
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:43,543
The things I do...

809
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,057
- Nice.
- Let's go!

810
00:51:43,895 --> 00:51:47,232
- Ivan, what's happening?
- I'm gettin' you outta here.

811
00:51:47,315 --> 00:51:48,566
- Really?
- Yeah.

812
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,778
- Neat. Where are you taking me?
- To live in the wild.

813
00:51:52,987 --> 00:51:54,572
What about the others?

814
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:00,954
Okay, guys, stick together.

815
00:52:01,037 --> 00:52:02,163
Here we go!

816
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:05,583
Snickers! Snickers! This is it!
The moment of truth!

817
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,794
We're all taking off. Come with us.

818
00:52:07,877 --> 00:52:10,880
- What? And go where?
- The wild.

819
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:14,467
The what? But I wouldn't last two minutes
in the wild.

820
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:16,094
- Why?
- Well...

821
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,805
there are no blow-dryers.

822
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:22,142
Okay.

823
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:26,813
Locked.

824
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,191
Definitely locked.

825
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:33,236
Thelma? Are you okay?

826
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:35,488
It's all under control.

827
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:36,948
Hey, guys.

828
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:40,368
- What're you doing?
- The doors are locked.

829
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:43,621
Of course the doors are locked!

830
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:45,957
I thought you were 400 pounds
of pure power.

831
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,626
Right.

832
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:55,216
Now that's what I call an exit.

833
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,677
Wow. It's so big out here.

834
00:52:57,761 --> 00:53:01,431
Follow me, fellas.
I know this lot like the back of my paw.

835
00:53:04,642 --> 00:53:08,813
Guys, this is really chafing my belly.

836
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:12,484
Come on, Frankie. You hear that alarm?
The po-po will be here any minute.

837
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:15,987
Let me at 'em.
I'll blast 'em back with my hose.

838
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:18,907
That rabbit's crazier than I thought.

839
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:23,661
- Hello?
- Hey, Mack. It's me.

840
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:27,123
So, I'm locked inside Ivan's cage.

841
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:28,208
Wait, what?

842
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:31,544
It's okay. I'm absolutely fine,
'cause Ivan's not here.

843
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:35,840
- What?
- In fact, none of the animals are here.

844
00:53:40,303 --> 00:53:44,974
Okay. All we have to do
is make it across, and we're finally free.

845
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:50,772
Well, I'll just cross the road then.

846
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,441
Why would you cross the road, Henrietta?

847
00:53:53,983 --> 00:53:55,527
To get to the other side.

848
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:01,783
She said it!

849
00:54:02,575 --> 00:54:03,702
Boy.

850
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,955
- That's a good one!
- Classic.

851
00:54:11,876 --> 00:54:15,088
- Are we done?
- Yeah. I'm done.

852
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:16,965
Okay. Let's go!

853
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,592
Here we go! Whoo!

854
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:25,890
Whoo!

855
00:54:26,516 --> 00:54:28,435
My truck is stuck.

856
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,272
- Ivan.
- Wha...

857
00:54:32,355 --> 00:54:33,773
M-My truck is stuck.

858
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:36,776
Ivan...

859
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,988
- Murphy! Get out!
- Reverse!

860
00:54:40,071 --> 00:54:42,490
- What?
- My truck is stuck!

861
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:45,869
- Ivan!
- Hop out of the truck!

862
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:52,208
Ivan. I... My truck.

863
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:54,586
I'm sorry, Murphy.
I know you loved that thing.

864
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:57,213
- Murphy, baby, you okay?
- I almost died.

865
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:58,673
You just made it by a hair.

866
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:01,259
I saw my whole life flash before my eyes.

867
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:02,635
And?

868
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,680
I think I could do better.

869
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:07,557
- Come on, let's go.
- Home free.

870
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,226
Look at me. Out in nature.

871
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,187
Just trees and grass and...

872
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:14,356
empty soda cans.

873
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:18,068
What?

874
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,078
No, no, no, no.

875
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:31,164
Hey, Mack!

876
00:55:31,247 --> 00:55:32,374
Unbelievable.

877
00:55:36,252 --> 00:55:38,421
Come on. Come on.

878
00:55:50,141 --> 00:55:53,103
You feel that?
The wind on our faces.

879
00:55:53,186 --> 00:55:55,480
Real dirt beneath our feet...

880
00:55:55,563 --> 00:55:57,148
This is nice.

881
00:55:57,232 --> 00:55:59,359
- Is this it? The wild?
- Yeah!

882
00:55:59,442 --> 00:56:02,070
You did it, Ivan. You saved us.

883
00:56:02,153 --> 00:56:04,572
Hey, Frankie, do you miss your ball?

884
00:56:04,656 --> 00:56:08,451
Not at all. I've wasted so much of my life
with that stupid ball.

885
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:12,539
You wasted your life? I played baseball.
And I'm a chicken.

886
00:56:12,622 --> 00:56:14,416
I gotta level with you, Henrietta.

887
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,002
It could have been a lot worse for you.

888
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:21,256
Look at me! I'm hopping! On my own feet!

889
00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:22,340
Whee!

890
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:24,968
We're free! This is our new home.

891
00:56:25,051 --> 00:56:27,429
We can go where we want, do what we wa...

892
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,681
Wha...

893
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:44,195
What happens now, Ivan?

894
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:06,051
What?

895
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:13,058
Guys, go! Everybody hide. Everybody!

896
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:14,809
I wanna stay with you, Ivan.

897
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:17,604
I knew this was too good to be true.

898
00:57:17,687 --> 00:57:20,440
Whoa, whoa. Ivan, it's me! It's me.

899
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:22,192
It's only me.

900
00:57:26,237 --> 00:57:27,989
What're you doin' out here, kid?

901
00:57:32,118 --> 00:57:35,080
Look. Ivan, you can't be out here. It's...

902
00:57:35,163 --> 00:57:37,874
All right, all right. All right.

903
00:57:46,257 --> 00:57:48,301
It's all under control.

904
00:57:52,847 --> 00:57:54,015
Come on, kid.

905
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:57,143
We gotta get you back. All of you.

906
00:57:58,061 --> 00:57:59,813
You're not safe out here.

907
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,273
Ruby is at risk.

908
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:05,235
Is that what you want?

909
00:58:07,612 --> 00:58:09,572
We're in this together, Ivan.

910
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:13,076
We're family.

911
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,706
Come on. Let's go home.

912
00:58:36,474 --> 00:58:37,976
- Hey, Mack.
- Hey.

913
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:39,686
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

914
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:41,521
Hey, thanks for coming in early.

915
00:58:41,604 --> 00:58:42,939
Yeah, of course.

916
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:46,609
- Where's Castello?
- Gone. I fired him.

917
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:48,236
Listen...

918
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:51,948
no one can know about tonight.

919
00:58:52,032 --> 00:58:55,160
I mean, if the city ever finds out,

920
00:58:55,243 --> 00:58:58,455
they would shut us down in a heartbeat.

921
00:58:58,538 --> 00:59:01,458
No worries. Understood.

922
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:02,542
All right.

923
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:06,421
Hey, it's okay. Go ahead.

924
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:09,841
- Good job getting them all back.
- Thanks, George.

925
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,981
Ivan?

926
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:29,778
Will you tell me about a real forest?

927
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,946
Ruby, listen to me.

928
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:34,449
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

929
00:59:34,532 --> 00:59:37,702
But what is the wild like, Ivan?
Will you tell me?

930
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:40,455
You know I can't remember
that kind of stuff.

931
00:59:40,538 --> 00:59:43,917
- But I've never even seen it.
- Ruby, I told you I can't remember.

932
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,836
I don't... I can't remember the wild.

933
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:48,713
Stella used to say...

934
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:54,302
"There's a difference between
'can't remember' and 'won't remember.'"

935
00:59:59,557 --> 01:00:00,809
Please?

936
01:00:03,186 --> 01:00:04,396
Okay, I'll tell...

937
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:08,650
I'll try to remember. I'll try.

938
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:14,489
I remember my... my parents.

939
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:18,159
They called me... they called me Mud.

940
01:00:18,576 --> 01:00:20,495
- "Mud"?
- Yeah.

941
01:00:20,578 --> 01:00:22,914
It's better than Bob.

942
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:27,085
'Cause I was always wandering away
from the troop in search of it.

943
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:38,763
I would use mud
to draw on anything I could find.

944
01:00:40,765 --> 01:00:43,393
I would get lost in a world of my own.

945
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:49,482
While other gorillas were learning
to swing from vines and gather fruit,

946
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:51,401
I was always down on the ground,

947
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:54,070
in the mud... drawing.

948
01:00:55,196 --> 01:00:56,614
I could draw all day.

949
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:01,244
My father thought
that was a little strange,

950
01:01:01,327 --> 01:01:04,748
so he tried to teach me
how to be strong and fearsome.

951
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:09,544
This did not come naturally to me.

952
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:12,047
I was a work in progress.

953
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:16,676
But my dad still loved me.

954
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:23,433
The only thing I loved as much as drawing
was playing with my sister, Tag.

955
01:01:24,934 --> 01:01:26,644
My parents called her Tag.

956
01:01:26,728 --> 01:01:29,064
That was the game she loved to play.

957
01:01:29,147 --> 01:01:30,523
She was good at tag.

958
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:32,692
She'd always win.

959
01:01:36,404 --> 01:01:38,156
Tag sounds like fun.

960
01:01:38,823 --> 01:01:40,241
Where's your sister now?

961
01:01:45,663 --> 01:01:48,750
I don't think you want
to know all this, Ruby.

962
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,752
Yes, I do.

963
01:01:53,129 --> 01:01:54,255
Well...

964
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:58,677
it's a little foggy, but, um...

965
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,724
One day, I was drawing in the mud.

966
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,310
My dad watching over me.

967
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:10,855
All of a sudden, it became very quiet.

968
01:02:14,275 --> 01:02:16,277
We heard strange noises.

969
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:22,200
That's when they came.

970
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:27,205
My dad threw me on his back, and we ran.

971
01:02:28,373 --> 01:02:30,291
Faster than he'd ever run before.

972
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:35,547
My father and I,
we got separated from the others.

973
01:02:37,716 --> 01:02:40,719
He did everything he could to protect me.

974
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:44,848
He placed me out of harm's reach,
high up in a tree.

975
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:48,852
And then...

976
01:03:06,077 --> 01:03:08,496
I never saw anyone in my troop again.

977
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:12,500
Julia gave me this.

978
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:17,922
I named it "Not-Tag"
because it'll never be Tag.

979
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:26,514
I used to think, i-if I'd learned
how to fight like my father...

980
01:03:27,432 --> 01:03:29,768
and I hadn't always been drawing
in the mud...

981
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:33,355
I coulda...

982
01:03:35,982 --> 01:03:39,110
Humans are the worst.

983
01:03:39,194 --> 01:03:41,738
Cockroaches have bigger hearts.

984
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:43,740
"Not all humans are bad."

985
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:48,161
Remember what Stella said,
"Humans can surprise you."

986
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:52,332
I bet your father loved you
for who you are, Ivan.

987
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:56,586
I bet he loved your drawings, like I do.

988
01:03:59,297 --> 01:04:02,342
Thanks for the story, Ivan. Good night.

989
01:04:02,425 --> 01:04:04,010
Good night, Ruby.

990
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:05,220
Good night, Bob.

991
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:10,100
Now they're all calling me Bob.

992
01:04:23,154 --> 01:04:25,824
Hey, it was fun while it lasted.

993
01:04:25,907 --> 01:04:28,410
And look, you got a new truck.

994
01:04:28,493 --> 01:04:31,871
Yeah, but who drives a yellow fire truck?

995
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:35,083
Sorry I left you, ball.
Don't be mad at me.

996
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:37,168
Here we go.

997
01:04:38,211 --> 01:04:40,588
Take your time. Take your time.

998
01:04:40,672 --> 01:04:42,424
All four. That's it.

999
01:04:43,091 --> 01:04:45,010
Beautiful.

1000
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:46,845
That's my girl.

1001
01:04:46,928 --> 01:04:50,557
Let's just go for a little stroll?
Here we go, sweetheart.

1002
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,725
Hey, Ivan.

1003
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:55,061
These are for you.

1004
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:59,733
They were a present from my aunt,
but I'm kinda too old for finger paints.

1005
01:05:00,233 --> 01:05:02,694
All you gotta do is put your finger in...

1006
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:05,905
Well, you'll figure it out.

1007
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:13,872
I heard about last night.

1008
01:05:15,165 --> 01:05:17,542
You don't wanna be here anymore, do you?

1009
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,007
I wish I could help you, Ivan.

1010
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,301
Just like I wish I could help my mom.

1011
01:05:27,135 --> 01:05:29,012
Why are things stuck in cages?

1012
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:32,682
Why do people have to be sick?

1013
01:05:34,976 --> 01:05:36,394
That's why I like drawing.

1014
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:40,774
I can draw things the way I want it to be,
and it's almost like...

1015
01:05:40,857 --> 01:05:43,818
if I draw it well enough, it'll come true.

1016
01:05:52,994 --> 01:05:54,204
This is my mom.

1017
01:05:56,998 --> 01:05:59,417
This isn't what she looks like right now.

1018
01:05:59,918 --> 01:06:01,711
One day she'll look like this again.

1019
01:06:06,257 --> 01:06:07,842
You're a real artist, Ivan.

1020
01:06:09,552 --> 01:06:10,887
I know you understand.

1021
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:01,271
Ivan, what are you doing?

1022
01:07:01,354 --> 01:07:03,648
Can't talk. Can't talk. Too much to do.

1023
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:50,278
- Where is Ivan?
- He's up there.

1024
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:03,291
Today is gonna be a good one, Snickers.

1025
01:08:23,186 --> 01:08:26,106
Well, hello there. Just in time.
Standing room, right over here.

1026
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:28,650
- That must be him. Mack?
- Yes?

1027
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:29,943
Hi.

1028
01:08:30,026 --> 01:08:32,362
- Candace Taylor, WNMZ.
- Hello.

1029
01:08:32,445 --> 01:08:34,781
I would love to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.

1030
01:08:34,864 --> 01:08:37,283
Is it about our Picasso Primate, no doubt?

1031
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:40,954
Can you confirm reports
there was an escape here the other night?

1032
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:42,372
An escape?

1033
01:08:42,455 --> 01:08:45,000
We have people claiming they saw animals
on the highway.

1034
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,376
- My.
- A gorilla.

1035
01:08:46,459 --> 01:08:50,046
Well, that would be quite a sight to see
a gorilla on the highway, wouldn't it?

1036
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:54,259
No, I can assure you that all the animals
are right here, safe and sound.

1037
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:57,887
And actually, we're about to start
another fabulous show right now.

1038
01:08:57,971 --> 01:09:02,517
So, listen, why don't you stick around?
And feel free to film our show.

1039
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,185
Ta-ta.

1040
01:09:04,936 --> 01:09:07,105
Always use both hands with the light,
okay?

1041
01:09:07,188 --> 01:09:09,108
- And remember to wait for me...
- I've got this.

1042
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:10,984
I've watched the show more than anyone.

1043
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:12,068
George, George.

1044
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:14,070
Listen, there is a reporter out there,

1045
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:17,073
and she's asking a lot of questions
about the animals escaping.

1046
01:09:17,157 --> 01:09:20,035
- If she finds out, I'm done.
- I understand. You got it, Mack.

1047
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:23,830
Hey, Jules, thanks a lot for helping us
out with the show. Good luck!

1048
01:09:23,913 --> 01:09:25,206
Break a leg, Mack.

1049
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:28,752
Frankie the seal!

1050
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:35,717
Let's play catch, Frankie.

1051
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,385
Up!

1052
01:09:39,929 --> 01:09:43,266
Is Ivan okay?
It's almost time for him to go on.

1053
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,476
I'll go check.

1054
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:48,313
Frankie, what do you say...

1055
01:09:48,396 --> 01:09:50,440
Shouldn't you be warming up?

1056
01:09:54,694 --> 01:09:58,323
Ladies and gentlemen, Ruby!

1057
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:02,202
And up you go, girl!

1058
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:10,877
And now...

1059
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:14,506
the moment you've all been waiting for.

1060
01:10:14,589 --> 01:10:17,634
The Primate Picasso himself!

1061
01:10:18,259 --> 01:10:20,512
The one and only Ivan!

1062
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:01,302
Well, he's quite the artist,
isn't he, folks?

1063
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:06,808
Yes. Yes!

1064
01:11:46,931 --> 01:11:47,932
Excuse me.

1065
01:11:51,102 --> 01:11:53,104
- Dad, do you see it?
- Yeah.

1066
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:56,358
His painting's amazing.
And he did it with your finger paints?

1067
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:57,484
No, not that.

1068
01:11:58,026 --> 01:11:59,903
It's how he wants things to be.

1069
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:02,322
Ivan wants to be in the wild.

1070
01:12:03,865 --> 01:12:05,992
- What?
- Ivan doesn't wanna be here anymore.

1071
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:08,828
I know it. We have to do something.

1072
01:12:08,912 --> 01:12:13,333
Julia, even if that's true, I don't know
what we can do about that, sweetheart.

1073
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:14,417
I know.

1074
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:16,336
She can help him.

1075
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:26,721
Julia, this is my job. Okay?

1076
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:29,224
- We can't just...
- Dad, please!

1077
01:12:29,307 --> 01:12:31,101
Ivan needs to be free.

1078
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:35,146
Don't you always say
we should try to do the right thing?

1079
01:12:37,023 --> 01:12:39,067
Who's next? What would you like?

1080
01:12:41,444 --> 01:12:45,907
There you are. What would you like?
One and two...

1081
01:12:56,376 --> 01:12:57,377
Go.

1082
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:05,593
Excuse me. Hi. I'm Julia.

1083
01:13:06,219 --> 01:13:07,637
Hi, Julia.

1084
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:09,097
What can I do for you?

1085
01:13:16,938 --> 01:13:19,774
Ivan, what's that noise?

1086
01:13:21,026 --> 01:13:24,863
Free Ivan! Ruby!
Free Ivan! Ruby! Free Ivan!

1087
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:26,364
What's happening?

1088
01:13:27,824 --> 01:13:29,200
Free Ivan! Ruby!

1089
01:13:29,284 --> 01:13:33,204
As you can see, I'm now standing
in front of the Big Top Mall.

1090
01:13:33,288 --> 01:13:35,707
Remember Ivan?
The gorilla that likes to draw?

1091
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:39,502
Well, his painting is clearly a sign
he wants to be free.

1092
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:44,549
Free Ivan! Ruby! Free Ivan! Ruby!
Free Ivan! Ruby!

1093
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:06,529
You did it, buddy.

1094
01:14:07,072 --> 01:14:09,824
Ivan, why are they yelling our names?

1095
01:14:09,908 --> 01:14:11,618
Are they mad at us?

1096
01:14:12,118 --> 01:14:15,455
No, Ruby. They're not mad at us.

1097
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:17,082
They wanna help us.

1098
01:14:17,832 --> 01:14:20,168
They want us to be free.

1099
01:14:26,174 --> 01:14:30,720
Remember, Stella knew there was
something better out there for us.

1100
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:33,348
She couldn't get there herself,

1101
01:14:34,099 --> 01:14:36,351
but she wanted to make sure
that you would.

1102
01:14:37,143 --> 01:14:39,813
I don't wanna go anywhere without you.

1103
01:14:39,896 --> 01:14:43,233
Well, you know,
change is scary for all of us.

1104
01:14:43,316 --> 01:14:46,945
Sometimes you just have to
take a leap of faith, Ruby.

1105
01:14:48,196 --> 01:14:51,616
Trust that kindness will always be there
when you need it.

1106
01:14:53,076 --> 01:14:54,786
"Not all humans are bad.

1107
01:14:56,955 --> 01:14:58,540
They can surprise you."

1108
01:14:59,624 --> 01:15:01,209
Remember?

1109
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:03,003
I remember.

1110
01:15:06,756 --> 01:15:08,466
Mind your backs!

1111
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:09,551
All right.

1112
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:14,139
So long, Frankie.
Let me see that gorgeous smile.

1113
01:15:14,222 --> 01:15:16,266
Keep in touch.

1114
01:15:16,349 --> 01:15:18,351
Ain't nobody loves you better.

1115
01:15:20,937 --> 01:15:25,150
- Do you think there'll be other elephants?
- Yeah. I'm sure there will be.

1116
01:15:25,233 --> 01:15:26,901
Will they like me?

1117
01:15:26,985 --> 01:15:29,738
Yeah, of course they'll like you. You bet.

1118
01:15:29,821 --> 01:15:32,574
You can tell 'em the refrigerator joke.
They'll love that.

1119
01:15:32,657 --> 01:15:34,617
Footprints in the butter!

1120
01:15:34,701 --> 01:15:36,995
Exactly. Works every time.

1121
01:15:37,078 --> 01:15:38,705
I'll tell them about you, Ivan.

1122
01:15:38,788 --> 01:15:41,082
And Bob and Julia

1123
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:43,501
and Henrietta and Murphy

1124
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:45,754
and Frankie and Thelma...

1125
01:15:48,923 --> 01:15:50,300
and Stella.

1126
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:52,844
Yeah.

1127
01:15:52,927 --> 01:15:55,221
You be sure to tell 'em about Stella.

1128
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:57,182
I will.

1129
01:16:01,978 --> 01:16:03,438
Hey, Ruby.

1130
01:16:03,521 --> 01:16:05,231
I'm Dr. Maya.

1131
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,317
Now, you come with me.

1132
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:22,999
There you go.

1133
01:16:29,214 --> 01:16:30,840
Goodbye, Ivan.

1134
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:33,593
Goodbye, Ruby.

1135
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:47,107
It's gonna be just you and me now,
Snickers.

1136
01:16:53,613 --> 01:16:54,698
Hey, pal.

1137
01:16:55,448 --> 01:16:57,158
Don't get too comfortable.

1138
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,704
I guess all good things come to an end.

1139
01:17:00,787 --> 01:17:01,788
Yeah.

1140
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:06,501
How am I gonna fall asleep
without that warm tummy of yours?

1141
01:17:06,584 --> 01:17:09,004
You can sneak in there, with me.

1142
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:12,257
Humans are dumb, but they ain't that dumb.

1143
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:17,095
You'll be all right.
You're a wild beast, remember?

1144
01:17:18,221 --> 01:17:21,141
Well, technically,
I'm a domesticated species.

1145
01:17:21,224 --> 01:17:24,019
But I'll figure something out.
I always do.

1146
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:27,105
Here.

1147
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:29,441
What's this for?

1148
01:17:30,066 --> 01:17:31,526
That's to help you sleep.

1149
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:35,572
Aw.

1150
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:38,783
Thanks.

1151
01:17:41,661 --> 01:17:45,123
Well, I'd better get outta here
before they cart me off to the pound.

1152
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:55,633
You're the one and only Ivan, pal.

1153
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:57,761
Remember that.

1154
01:17:58,386 --> 01:17:59,387
Yeah.

1155
01:18:02,223 --> 01:18:03,850
And you're the one and only...

1156
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:08,021
Bob.

1157
01:18:08,104 --> 01:18:09,814
Everyone needs a name.

1158
01:18:10,648 --> 01:18:12,484
I guess mine's Bob.

1159
01:18:15,236 --> 01:18:17,655
No, no, no. Don't worry, dog.

1160
01:18:20,033 --> 01:18:21,034
You're okay.

1161
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,315
We had some laughs, kid?

1162
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:08,790
Remember that?

1163
01:19:11,334 --> 01:19:13,044
The day I brought you home.

1164
01:19:17,924 --> 01:19:19,467
Best times of my life.

1165
01:19:56,921 --> 01:19:57,922
Well...

1166
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:01,885
good luck, kid.

1167
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,494
I'm gonna miss you, Ivan.

1168
01:20:49,724 --> 01:20:50,850
Go on, Ivan.

1169
01:20:52,018 --> 01:20:53,311
It's time.

1170
01:21:05,281 --> 01:21:06,491
Go on.

1171
01:22:07,844 --> 01:22:08,928
Ivan!

1172
01:22:09,512 --> 01:22:13,683
You're okay. This isn't your home.

1173
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:16,686
This is.

1174
01:24:41,706 --> 01:24:43,458
She's here, Stella.

1175
01:24:45,043 --> 01:24:47,170
She's free.

1176
01:27:49,853 --> 01:27:52,355
Nice digs you got here.

1177
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:53,732
Bob?

1178
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:56,651
Hi, pal! Long time no see.

1179
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,571
How'd you get in here?

1180
01:27:59,654 --> 01:28:01,573
Are you kidding? I can sneak in anywhere.

1181
01:28:01,656 --> 01:28:02,657
Ivan!

1182
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:04,242
Here she is.

1183
01:28:04,325 --> 01:28:05,326
Ivan!

1184
01:28:05,785 --> 01:28:07,037
- Julia?
- Yeah.

1185
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,290
Turns out her mom likes having me around.
Who could blame her?

1186
01:28:10,373 --> 01:28:14,085
So, I live with them as, well,
as kind of a favor, you know?

1187
01:28:14,169 --> 01:28:15,712
Just to keep everyone happy.

1188
01:28:16,379 --> 01:28:18,340
- Really?
- Ivan.

1189
01:28:19,466 --> 01:28:22,052
We've missed you. You look great!

1190
01:28:25,055 --> 01:28:27,265
Dad, doesn't he look so happy?

1191
01:28:27,349 --> 01:28:28,475
He sure does.

1192
01:28:29,267 --> 01:28:32,187
Uncle Mack, he looks great, doesn't he?

1193
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,106
He really does.

1194
01:28:36,483 --> 01:28:38,068
See?

1195
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:41,112
You drew it so well,
you made it come true.

1196
01:28:41,571 --> 01:28:42,947
I'm so proud of you.

1197
01:28:45,241 --> 01:28:46,826
Never forget, pal,

1198
01:28:47,535 --> 01:28:49,621
you're the one and only Ivan.

1199
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:58,254
That's me. Mighty silverback.
