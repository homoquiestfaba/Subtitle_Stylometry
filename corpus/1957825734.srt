Morning.

13
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:07,467
Hey.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,334
Hey.

15
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:09,802
Happy belated Valentine's.

16
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:10,803
Good one Alex.

17
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:12,038
Have a good workout.

18
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:14,306
- Hey Theresa.
- Hey.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,574
What's up with the mask?

20
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,310
Oh, I just got
back from Hong Kong.

21
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:20,146
Everyone's wearing them
'cause of the outbreak.

22
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:21,381
Outbreak?

23
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,015
Coronavirus?

24
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,450
Oh yeah, I got a text.

25
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,419
I got a text alert about that.

26
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:28,488
I thought it was just in China.

27
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:29,722
We'll see.

28
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:32,463
Hmm, okay, well I
was gonna go work out,

29
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:33,927
but it was nice seeing you.

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,860
You too.

31
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:35,995
Yeah, have a good day.

32
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,842
Ideally, you draw up a play,

33
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,478
you get yourself a bucket,
then you come back defensively

34
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,513
and you lock down and
get yourself a steal.

35
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:57,249
But that has to be a theme
for this team, brother.

36
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,684
It's only the first quarter?

37
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:01,453
These guys better wake
up or this game is over.

38
00:02:01,587 --> 00:02:03,131
There's a
nice bounce pass to Gardner,

39
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:05,425
drives and stolen as he goes up.

40
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,593
Fast down court, Sanders
slides right by Pearson,

41
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,161
and goes in for an easy layup.

42
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,163
Man, I don't know

43
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,664
what they did last night,

44
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:13,717
but they better get their
head in the game today.

45
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,068
The World Health Organization

46
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,469
has announced an official name

47
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:19,138
for the novel
coronavirus disease

48
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,775
that is causing illness and
even death in Wuhan, China.

49
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,977
It's called COVID 19.

50
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,713
There are many types
of human coronaviruses,

51
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:32,352
but COVID 19 is a new disease
not previously seen in humans.

52
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,086
You
risk throwing a split fever

53
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:35,654
here for the pass?

54
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,390
That's
exactly what I was about to say.

55
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:39,563
You have to be careful with
the runner on the third.

56
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:16,896
I knew the air quality
in LA was bad, but.

57
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:19,966
It affects people with
respiratory problems.

58
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,266
Nice to see you too.

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,969
Gotta go! Bye!

60
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:24,802
See ya.

61
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,607
We still don't know

62
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,409
if those two games
tonight will be played,

63
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,711
but what we do know is that
NBA officials have said

64
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,947
an unidentified player
has tested positive

65
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,016
for the coronavirus disease,
and according to one report,

66
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,055
three teammates have also
tested positive for coronavirus,

67
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,391
and all that is what's
led Commissioner Silver

68
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,959
to make his announcement today

69
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,229
that the NBA season is
officially suspended.

70
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,431
League officials
did not say how long

71
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,233
that suspension will last.

72
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:07,813
Yes, COVID is greatly affecting
distributor confidence.

73
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:11,250
Orders are down in China,
Taiwan, and Hong Kong.

74
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:14,286
Even our Japanese
distributor is indicating

75
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,788
that he will be ordering less

76
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:18,992
because of the virus
potential impact on Japan.

77
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,161
These are products
for ischemic stroke,

78
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,863
which is an emergent procedure

79
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:25,940
and demand should not go down
no matter how this unfolds.

80
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:28,601
That was essentially
my response as well,

81
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,670
but our Japanese
distributor is concerned

82
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,072
that his other businesses
could be hard hit

83
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:38,711
if elective procedures aren't
canceled, but I'm sure that

84
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:41,481
when this dies down
in a couple of weeks,

85
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,783
they will resume
normal ordering.

86
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:46,185
Hmm.

87
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:48,020
Well then for the moment,

88
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,624
we'll just have to find a
way to cut down on expenses.

89
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:56,796
We are spending a fortune on
your apartment in Hong Kong,

90
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,632
you practically live there,
and they love you there,

91
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:04,570
but until business picks
up, I'm very sorry but

92
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:07,606
we will have to suspend
your employment.

93
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:12,311
As you said, I'm sure
things will return to normal

94
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,579
when this all dies down,

95
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,983
then we'll be able
to hire you back.

96
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,798
You gotta admit
I've been pretty quiet

97
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,191
the last couple of days, right?

98
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,927
Sorry to hear that all
your sports were canceled.

99
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,996
Are you?
Really?

100
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,000
But it is awfully
quiet around here.

101
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,435
Yeah, too quiet.

102
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:38,338
Now I know when your
boyfriend comes over.

103
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,807
What do you mean?

104
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,210
You should have
sex in your bedroom.

105
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,344
Disgusting.

106
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,813
Not your living room.

107
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,216
See ya.
But good to know.

108
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,886
Do so by
socially distancing themselves

109
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,088
from others.

110
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,856
A state as large as
ours is many parts,

111
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,491
but at the end of the
day, we're one body.

112
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,959
There's a mutuality,

113
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,763
and there's a recognition
of our interdependence

114
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,764
that requires of this moment

115
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:10,669
that we direct a statewide order
for people to stay at home.

116
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:14,640
That directive goes into
force and effect this evening.

117
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,576
We are confident that the people
of the state of California

118
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,245
will abide by it.

119
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,458
They'll do the right thing.

120
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:22,014
They'll meet this moment.

121
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,450
They'll step up as they
have to protect themselves

122
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,718
and to protect broader community

123
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:28,654
and this great
state and the world.

124
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,884
You know the governor
issued to stay at home, right?

125
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,768
I got a three on three
game later, finals.

126
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,236
You?

127
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,373
Groceries because that's
the only thing we're allowed.

128
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,875
You're telling me I
can't play basketball?

129
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:53,413

Theresa, your neighbor.

The invisible woman.

147
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,206
Yeah.

148
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,542
Was my cello too loud?

149
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,876
You play the cello?

150
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,245

151
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:36,182
Seriously, I love strings.

152

Do you?

153
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,617
I love chains.

154
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,221
Love to open your locket
and see what's inside.

155
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:43,354
Australian?

156
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:46,258
I'm from Fresno actually.

157
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,560
I meant the gold.

158
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,161
Oh, Canadian.

159
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,063
I went to the
Yukon, Dawson City.

160
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:54,000
You panned for gold
and got all this?

161
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,736
I, after four hours
of scooping rocks,

162
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,238
got it at the gift shop.

163
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:05,310
I was hoping to get your number.

164
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,713

165
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:10,782

Oh is that what

181
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:38,737
You know the reason
that there's no traffic

182
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,272
is 'cause no one's
going to work.

183
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:44,443
If no one's going to work,
no one's buying cars.

184
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:50,116
And if no one's buying
cars then I'm not selling.

185
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,719
Here's what I owe you, okay?

186
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,954
Plus a little extra.

187
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,556
It's not as much as I'd like,

188
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:00,425
but considering I'm still
paying those on a closed lot,

189
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,060
it's the best I can do.

190
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:05,264
Yes, we are so broke,
we take any more losses,

191
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,300
we'll have to move
to Beverly Hills.

192
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:31,423
You know in French they
say like three minus half,

193
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:32,257
three plus half.

194
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,426
Interesting.

195
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:38,263
Also women, they don't
shave their arms or legs.

196
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:44,436
You heard of WD-40?

197
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,046
You have a good workout?

198
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,982
Sounds like you're making the
most of your new purchase.

199
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,919
Oh, just watch
the Blacklist will ya?

200
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:03,989
You know, I'm
not exactly thrilled

201
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,567
that you can hear my
every move either.

202
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,302
You know there's
quarantine last any longer,

203
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,294
you're gonna hear a
lot of my movements.

204
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,430
Do I need to go buy
some air freshener?

205
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:13,065
No,

206
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,319
I'm talking about I'm probably
gonna gain some weight.

207
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:16,668
Okay.

208
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:22,775
You hear that?

209
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,645
First it was like white noise,

210
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,282
endless stream of cars, day
and night, night and day.

211
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,919
Now I actually do notice
when I hear a car.

212
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,169
When did you get out?

213
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,302
Two weeks ago.

214
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,471
Inmates for good
behavior got on parole

215
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:54,806
'cause this virus thing.

216
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,776
What do you want Melvin?

217
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,620
What'd I tell you
about calling me Melvin?

218
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,912
I'm your dad.

219
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,981
Being blood does
not make you a father.

220
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:05,117
All I'm tryna do is
holler at you, shit.

221
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,987
I gotta go anyways,
I have a date.

222
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:13,559
You have a date?

223
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,163
I wasn't talking to you.

224
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,504

watch the Blacklist?

Since you can't go outdoors,
I brought outdoors to you.

238
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:17,523
That's so sweet.

239
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:19,925
Where's your mask?

240
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:21,559
Oh, I just took it off.

241
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:23,562
You don't need me to wear
it around you, right?

242
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:24,864
No.

243
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,301
You look amazing.

244
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:30,502
Thank you.

245
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,673
I've been thinking about
you a lot these last few days.

00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:35,806
Me too.

247
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:38,944
I just wished we had a
couple more days together.

248
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:40,077
I do too.

249
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:42,914
Is that your neighbor's phone?

250
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,250
Yeah, unfortunately
I just found out

251
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,020
that these two apartments
used to be one,

252
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,122
and so the manager stuck
a wall in the middle

253
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:52,024
to make it two.

254
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,461

00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,357
Woo, that was a better
workout than the gym.

260
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,294
Hear that neighbor?

261
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,127
Hey I'm headed to the
roof for a little fresh air.

262
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:03,963
You wanna join?

263
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:12,304
Just being neighborly
and phenomenally bored.

264
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:17,676
Think of it as non
date, non-friendly.

265
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,513
How about non-thanks.

266
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:28,019
All right, you're making
me resort to bribery.

267
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:33,125
I've splurged on a $20
bottle of wine, French wine.

268
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:38,397
Ignore me, drink the wine.

269
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:01,620
How's James?

270
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:05,190
You know his name?

271
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,925
He asks you to
say it all the time.

272
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,128
Are you practicing
for a radio shock gig?

273
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,074
And you can hear me all
the way from my bedroom?

274
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,634
Have you heard it lately?
It's kind of like Nebraska.

275
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,137
I can hear you snore.

276
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,106
Correction, I don't snore.

277
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,246
Can I ask you a
personal question?

278
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,615
I think you know everything.

279
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,316
Why don't you like me?

280
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,052
Why do you think?

281
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:37,155
Oh, sorry.
That was rude of me.

282
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,091
Thinking's not
your strong point.

283
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,826
Ouch.

284
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,331
You just look at me
like a piece of meat.

285
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:48,200
Porterhouse though.

286
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,636
Haha. You are so funny.

287
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,673
No, every time I
walk in the hallway,

288
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,674
I feel like I need
to take a shower.

289
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:58,577
Guilty as charged.

290
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:00,845
My punishment?

291
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,047
More truth.

292
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,384
Whenever you convince a victim,

293
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,786
I mean woman to come
over to your place.

294
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,389
I bet the first thing that you
do is check your Lakers app

295
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,858
to check their score.

296
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,562
And if they're winning,
which usually are,

297
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:19,130
at least I'm in a good mood.

298
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,801
Everything's a silly
little joke to you, isn't it?

299
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:25,914
But one day you're gonna wake up

300
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,672
and realize the joke's on you.

301
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:29,445
Seems like you've
given me some thought.

302
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:33,112
Kind of hard not to when
you're in my ear 24/7.

303
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:36,548
Binge on the Blacklist, why?

304
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:40,385
Hate to have a little
bit of silence?

305
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:49,895
Well,

306
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:52,897
this has been nice.

307
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:55,400
I'll go hang myself now.

308
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,170
Should do this again
in my next life.

309
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:00,804

Thanks for update,
Captain Obvious.

334
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:45,544
No auditions?

335
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:47,764
How'd you know
I was an actress?

336
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,847
I seen that movie on Netflix.

337
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:50,981
Really, which one?

338
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,316
Or was it the porn channel?

339
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:54,795
Seriously, it doesn't take
that much detective work

340
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:58,023
to know that every waitress
in LA is an actress.

341
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:01,202
Why can't you just
catch the coronavirus

342
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,594
and leave me alone?

343
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,999
I mean, what do you do?

344
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,401
Sales.

345
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,803
Exotic cars, classics.

346
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,137
Sales fits you.

347
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,840
Really?
How so?

348
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,874
As I await the insult.

349
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:21,579
You put on some charm first
while smiling like a wolf,

350
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:22,947
then you apply pressure,

351
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,217
waiting for the perfect
moment to pounce.

352
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:30,822
Wow, I'm not quite the
stereotype you envision.

353
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:32,057
Enlighten me.

354
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,860
See, you love dishing it out,

355
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:37,662
but you hate having
it dished back to you.

356
00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:39,195
If you're auditioning
for a bitch,

357
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,932
I'm sure you'll be authentic.

358
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:43,168
That's what my agent
keeps telling me.

359
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,455
What?

360
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:07,059
Prison got me thinking
about a lot of things.

361
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,862
Oh, me and your
moms were so young.

362
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:12,996
Young?

363
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,300
Were you young three years ago

364
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:19,538
when you decided to barge into
my mother's apartment drunk?

365
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:22,440
No.

366
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:25,043
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

367
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,648
I don't ever want
you to call me again.

368
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:36,955
Damn.

369
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,436
Xavier,

370
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,005
I'm talking to you.

371
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,808
What, What?

372
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,115
Where is the fuck
is the toilet paper

373
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,151
I asked you to buy last week?

374
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:42,486
I forgot to get it.

375
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,223
We are completely out!

376
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,960
It is the one thing
I asked you to do.

377
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,195
Honey, what are
you trying to say?

378
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,734
I come home after
working 24 hours

379
00:23:55,867 --> 00:24:02,040
nursing a people back to health
to find a dirty apartment,

380
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,544
the fridge has no food in it,

381
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,014
the dog hasn't been washed,

382
00:24:10,948 --> 00:24:14,486
and the bills haven't been paid,

383
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:22,561
and now we have no
fucking toilet paper.

384
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,830
You know what?

385
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,332
I am done.

386
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,735
Get the fuck out.

387
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:32,737
What?

388
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:37,241
Get the fuck out!

389
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,111
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

390
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:43,248
I think COVID has
gone to your head.

391
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,985
Do I have to do everything?

392
00:24:49,854 --> 00:24:51,823
Get the fucking door.

393
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,597
God.

394
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,167
What?

395
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,371
Hey, I'm just your
neighbor down the hall.

396
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:12,076
Yeah, I still recognize
you with all that on.

397
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,114
I was just seeing
if you were okay.

398
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:20,185
That is so sweet
of you to notice.

399
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,787
I come in peace.

400
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,289
No, we are fine.

401
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,723
You know, we've just been

402
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,926
doing a little role
reversal since COVID.

403
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,229
My husband just
doesn't seem to get it.

404
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,883
He doesn't need to
know our business.

405
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:35,500
I can tell him anything
that I want to tell him.

406
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:36,667
Guys, toilet paper.

407
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,069
I have extra.

408
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:40,906
Oh, um,

409
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:46,143
I'm so sorry, I am so tired.

410
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:47,445
I know it's okay.

411
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,614
I know you're under
a lot of pressure

412
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:51,082
and I don't even know

413
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,217
how I'm gonna pay my
bills without working.

414
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,019
Me neither.

415
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,856
And I'm unessential.

416
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:00,292
Non.

417
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:04,628
I'm non-essential.

418
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,906
And look, if you'll excuse us,

419
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,141
I have some work to do.

420
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:18,275
Yeah, man.

421
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:19,476
Do your thing.

422
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,613
Have a good one.
Bye.

423
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,348
Be safe.

424
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,965
Here's one I think
you'll like, TUI,

425
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,467
comes from the
Latin word tutelage.

426
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:47,305
Tutelage usually means specialized
in individual guidance.

427
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:50,208
Alexander the Great
was under the tutelage

428
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:54,745
of the philosopher Aristotle
between the ages of 13 and 16,

429
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,313
and his tutor inspired him

430
00:26:56,447 --> 00:27:00,651
with the love of philosophy,
medicine, and science.

431
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,854
At 16, he commanded
his first army

432
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:04,889
and by his death 16 years later,

433
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,659
he had founded the
greatest empire ever seen,

434
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,392
but it's not so easy
to trace the effects

435
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:13,098
of the brilliant tutelage he
had received in his youth.

436
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:15,900
Cool.

437
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,069
Alex the Great.

438
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:21,072
You trying to tell me something?

439
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:24,009
And Aristotle, didn't
he play for the Lakers?

440
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,142
Come on.

441
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,511
No, no, no, that
was Ron Artez.

442
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,481
But what's happening
with King James anyway?

443
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,016
Why don't you just watch
baseball reruns or something?

444
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:36,488
Well, ESPN is doing
fantasy baseball games,

445
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,856
but even I think
that's pathetic,

446
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,758
but come on, don't
change the subject.

447
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:43,027
Why doesn't he ever stay
over two nights in a row?

448
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,030
Believe it or not Alex,
that's none of your business.

449
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:48,265
Your business is located
at a one way street,

450
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,400
the dead ends.

451
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,102
And you know this how?

452
00:27:51,235 --> 00:27:54,105
Because he's like every other
guy. He's a freaking wolf.

453
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:56,078
He's just better at
holding in his inner animal

454
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,685
for the first two
minutes on your couch.

455
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,177
Just the thought of
knowing that you can hear us

456
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,880
on my couch makes
me wanna fumigate.

457
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,748
Not everything
can be written off

458
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:05,182
with a silly little joke.

459
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:06,384
No, no joke.

460
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:08,052
Like I have to convince
you of anything

461
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,921
when you're just trying
to sabotage my shit.

462
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:12,957
Humor me for one second, okay?

463
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,828
And tell me the qualities
that are unique only to him.

464
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,662
Okay.

465
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:23,133
He's genuine for starters,
ever heard of that?

466
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:27,572
And he's sincere,
honest, trustworthy.

467
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,139
Loyal and obedient?

468
00:28:29,273 --> 00:28:32,409
Does he get a biscuit if he
brings you your slippers?

469
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:33,878
From what I hear,

470
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,947
you two don't talk about
anything of importance.

471
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:39,350
Nothing personal, real,

472
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,619
safe political opinions followed
by safe personal insights.

473
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:44,856
I mean, if one step lesson

474
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,192
you could be talking to
the freaking mailman.

475
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,827
Why not ask him
about something real?

476
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,496
Like if he's pro-life
or pro-choice

477
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,575
or try talking to him about
taking it to the next level

478
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,535
and then see how genuine
of a guy he becomes.

479
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,336
Okay, and let
me guess who you think

480
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,872
my perfect boyfriend is.

481
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,074
My backstabbing neighbor?

482
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,976
Let me flip the
question back on you.

483
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:07,245
Are you pro-life or pro-choice?

484
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,218
I believe that all
women should get to choose

485
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:11,282
what they do with their bodies.

486
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:13,417
Why a bunch of old
white men get to decide

487
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,152
is beyond me.

488
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,356
Careful now, that's awfully
close to a thoughtful answer.

489
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:23,928
Do you have a girlfriend?

490
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:26,931
No, let me guess, you don't.

491
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:30,802
I date, not the same
girl two nights in a row.

492
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,537
Sound familiar?

493
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:34,848
But I do let 'em sleep
over once in a while

494
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:36,440
even if I don't want them to.

495
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:40,879
I guess I'm not as honest
with my feelings as James.

496
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:47,151
How does someone break a
dish loading a dishwasher?

497
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:49,554
Our china is our most
expensive wedding gift,

498
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,089
and why are you putting
our china in the dishwasher

499
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,991
in the first place?

500
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:56,894
I broke a plate and
you're busting my balls.

501
00:29:57,027 --> 00:29:58,062
Oh no, no, no.

502
00:29:58,195 --> 00:29:59,630
Those are working just fine.

503
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:03,401
In fact, that is the only
thing you seem to do right.

504
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:05,269
Fuck you.

505
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,505
Yeah that's not
happening anytime soon.

506
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:10,608
Look I am tired of
always having to redo

507
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,977
everything that you do.

508
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,412
It's exhausting.

509
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,915
I'm trying, but all you
tell me is I'm doing it wrong.

510
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:19,951
Because you are.

511
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,555
Look, before
this COVID started,

512
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,525
I went to work every
day and I was respected

513
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:32,029
and now I'm non-essential
and I feel that way here

514
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,598
and it hurts.

515
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,634
Oh shit.

516
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,605
Let's not go
through that again.

517
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,475
Honey.

518
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,078
What?

519
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:52,584
This is a dust pan,
not a broom shield.

520
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,020
Thanks.

521
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,962
So do you want me to
take the glass outside

522
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:07,298
or can I just throw
it in this can?

523
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:10,635
The trash can is perfect.

524
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:20,979
Hey, isn't this book the one
you've always wanted to read?

525
00:31:21,845 --> 00:31:24,682
For like the last three years.

526
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:26,527
Well, why don't you
go sit down and read it

527
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,153
and I'll finish
cleaning the kitchen.

528
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:35,627
I love you too.

529
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:41,699
Hey Randy.

530
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:43,134
Yeah?

531
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:45,469
You sure make those
crutches look sexy.

532
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:47,238
Hey, uh, Xavier?

533
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,472
Yeah?

534
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:51,342
Is that a broom or are
you just happy to see me?

535
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:55,813
Oh, way!

536
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,150
Watch out!

537
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,570
What?

538
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:21,005
It's me.

539
00:32:21,138 --> 00:32:24,976
We were just making sure
everybody here was alive.

540
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:28,980
Yeah.

541
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,115
We're just in the
middle of something.

542
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,851
Yeah, we're working
some things out still.

543
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,353
Outstanding.

544
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:38,956
We've gotta be quieter.

545
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:41,159
I'm gonna go get the ball gag.

546
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:43,962
Ball gag?

547
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,030
Too much information.

548
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,702
Talk about getting
to know your neighbors.

549
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:18,662
How do you feel about
not doing anything tonight?

550
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,798
Yeah, that's fine.

551
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,967
But did I do something?

552
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,668
Like not give you enough sake?

553
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:28,873
I was just wondering if
we could talk for a bit.

554
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,507
All right, anything.

555
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,910
He fidgets, hoping this
doesn't take more than a minute

556
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,078
to get back to business.

557
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:35,946
How do you feel about me?

558
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,448
Huh?

559
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:38,783
I like you.

560
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,884
I respect you.

561
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:43,654
I really enjoy our time
together, you know what I mean?

562
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:49,059
Then why don't you ever
wanna spend the night?

563
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:49,994
I do.

564
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:51,662
You don't.

565
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,406
You know I deal with a lot
of international companies,

566
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,975
so I'm on the phone
with Europe at 5:00 AM

567
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,000
and by 9:00 AM our time
they've already shut down,

568
00:33:57,134 --> 00:33:59,203
so I can't sleep in.

569
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:00,704
That doesn't explain weekends.

570
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,239
I know, I'm sorry.

571
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:05,810
I was just listening to
dumb voices in my head.

572
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,315
And now it's time for
the wolf to eat his sheep.

573
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:13,250
He's gonna be real
gentle in the beginning

574
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,861
and real rough at
the end just because

575
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:17,788
he had to sort through
her female mine fields.

576
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,696
Hey you.

577
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,999
I'm sorry,

578
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,943
do you need another minute
to get dressed for dinner?

579
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,168
Heck no.

580
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:32,770
Stuck in my apartment.

581
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,638
I wanna be comfortable.

582
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,480
Unless this bothers you.

583
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:49,019
When did you know
that you liked women?

584
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,122
I've always known.

585
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,791
Isn't it weird that I haven't?

586
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:55,192
That's why you run so hard

587
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:58,495
and hide so much,
invisible woman.

588
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:00,765
Why do you keep
calling me that?

589
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:03,834
You could simply
live in Hong Kong,

590
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,567
but then you wouldn't
be able to run away

591
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,271
from everyone you meet.

592
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:09,773
Meet someone there,
you're off to the states,

593
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:13,311
meet someone here and
you're off to Hong Kong.

594
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:15,513
Wow.

595
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,882
You're hiding, invisible
even to yourself.

596
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:24,155
Sorry, life's too
short for bullshit,

597
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,591
especially with COVID.
Yeah.

598
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:29,460
Okay, no bullshit.

599
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:31,729
You wanna know why
I keep this place?

600
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,468
'Cause of the way you
look at me in the hall.

601
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:40,871
That's because I like you.

602
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:43,040
You don't even know me.

603
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:45,243
You'd be surprised.

604
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,550
I got fired.

605
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:54,985
What?

606
00:35:55,018 --> 00:35:56,086
Hmm.

607
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,355
But that means I'm
gonna be spending

608
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:02,560
a little more time in
the states finding out

609
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:06,864
what it's like to be visible.

610
00:36:06,997 --> 00:36:07,997
Hmm.

611
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,202
I can't wait to kiss you.

612
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:15,239
Lead me not into temptation.

613
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,277
But deliver us from evil.

614
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,479
This is not evil.

615
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,585
I'm so fucking scared.

616
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,087
Good.

617
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:36,827
What, what are you...

618
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:43,133
♪ Want you here, want you near ♪

619
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:47,571
♪ Want you to hold me tighter,
make me feel lighter ♪

620
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:49,406
♪ Want you here, want you near ♪

621
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,344
♪ And I want every little piece
that you have to be singing ♪

622
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,947
♪ Now for me and all
of your, hang on, ♪

623
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:01,218
♪ We've found that missing
piece to be a tighter, ♪

624
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:05,856
♪ Better, more of me and you ♪

625
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:17,168
Oh shit.

626
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,304
I don't suppose I could
get a cup of coffee from you.

627
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,676
Milk and sugar?

628
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:27,211
Just milk.

629
00:37:34,284 --> 00:37:35,324
I got a question for you.

630
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:37,722
Yeah, what's that?

631
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:39,790
Order up.

632
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,934
What's your favorite
movie of all time?

633
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:53,170
Pride and Prejudice.

634
00:37:53,303 --> 00:37:54,303
Really?

635
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:59,309
Let me guess, you love
all Jane Austen movies,

636
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:05,916
all types, all versions,
all Jane, all men.

637
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:08,919
Yeah, I admit that they
have some similarities,

638
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:11,055
similar characters,
similar storylines,

639
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:15,526
but I just love the
romance, the grandeur.

640
00:38:15,692 --> 00:38:18,762
Let me guess. You love
ultra graphic films

641
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,132
with a couple of
bad jokes thrown in.

642
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,767
You still enjoy the movies
you liked as a child

643
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,037
because your taste hasn't
changed nor developed.

644
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:32,042
I think that your
favorite film is Diehard.

645
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:35,946
Then Gladiator and Bourne
Identity definitely make top 10.

646
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:38,549
Top five.

647
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:40,249
Sad.

648
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:42,620
Not as sad as last night.

649
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:47,022
Too soon?

650
00:38:49,526 --> 00:38:50,661
Still there?

651
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,100
How's the coffee?

652
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:00,704
I wonder why we drink coffee.

653
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:04,107
I mean, why is it so popular,
coffee and coffee houses.

654
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,410
To me, the expensive
kind and the cheap kind

655
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,979
all taste the same with a
little bit of milk in it.

656
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,283
Deep.

657
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,588
Do you and James have
these personally revealing

658
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:20,024
conversations with
each other like this?

659
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,994
Yeah, but coffee, coffee.

660
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:26,430
Yeah, I heard it was
invented by a sheep herder,

661
00:39:26,563 --> 00:39:28,331
found a sheep eating
coffee berries.

662
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:30,033
It was all jittery.

663
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,504
So we covered movies,
we covered coffee.

664
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:35,137
What else?

665
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,975
Sports?
You into any?

666
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:40,143
Just basketball.

667
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,146
- Really?
- No!

668
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,055
This is nice.

669
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:53,758
What?

670
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,461
The silence.

671
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,798
Yeah, I'm good.

672
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,434
Me too.

673
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,669
Careful,

674
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,672
that didn't feel mean at all.

675
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:12,074
I'm slipping.

676
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,311
As long as you're not tripping

677
00:40:14,444 --> 00:40:15,846
'cause we can't go anywhere.

678
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:17,647
Haha. You funny.

679
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:19,283
I keep having
this funny thought

680
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:22,786
that I'm turning into
Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie.

681
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:24,354
You're turning into a woman?

682
00:40:24,487 --> 00:40:28,525
No, I'm becoming a better man.

683
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:32,563
In my case, talking to a wall.

684
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:35,032
So if this is the
better version of you,

685
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:38,803
then I'd be absolutely
terrified to meet the old you.

686
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,282
Do you wanna come
over for dinner tonight?

687
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:56,119
If you don't have any plans,
which I know you don't.

688
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:58,188
I mean, we gotta get
through this together

689
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:01,191
whether you like it or not.

690
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:03,093
I mean, I can take the hour

691
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:06,997
and try and prove
I'm not a cove idiot

692
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,300
and you can shoot
me down a bunch.

693
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,236
That sounds fun, right?

694
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:15,617
I mean, hey, you know,
it's nothing formal.

695
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:17,908
I mean, we just have
to wear the masks

696
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:20,477
and we can do the whole
six feet apart thing.

697
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,814
It's not even slightly
romantic, yeah?

698
00:41:24,214 --> 00:41:27,251
Just two neighbors
passing the time

699
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:30,488
doing something a bit different.

700
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:35,593
And let me guess,
pizza or Chinese?

701
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,129
I guess I am a
bit of a stereotype.

702
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,597
Mm-hmm.

703
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:43,767
You know, is it even
safe to deliver food?

704
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,420
I mean, we don't know
who's cooking it,

705
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:48,104
who's delivering it, if
they're washing their hands,

706
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:50,273
I have a novel idea.

707
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,610
Why don't I cook?

708
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,911
You know, you won't
have to work out as much

709
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,515
if you don't have
so much to work off.

710
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,583
And the bitch is back.

711
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:03,487
You're talking about
cooking veggies, right?

712
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,489
Like I think I know
what those are.

713
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:08,324
- You.
- I know, me funny.

714
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:10,327
I gotta go to the store anyway,

715
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,629
so I'll pick up some salad
stuff while I'm there,

716
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,665
and 10 pounds of dressing.

717
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,572
- Hey.
- Hey.

718
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,141
Best sleep of my life.

719
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:28,378
Oh, I'm glad somebody
got some sleep.

720
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,781
You must be doing it wrong.

721
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,652
Which should
tell you something.

722
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,152
Hang on.

723
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,756
Oh,

724
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:40,357
I...

725
00:42:40,924 --> 00:42:43,193
I called my brother
this morning.

726
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:45,996
You came out to him?

727
00:42:46,129 --> 00:42:49,900
I left a message to
call me, but I plan to.

728
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,670
I'm tired of being invisible.

729
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,740
Wow, I'm impressed.

730
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,009
Letting your freak flag fly.

731
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:00,577
Hmm.

732
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,412
He's going to be shocked.

733
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,782
Your family has known
for as long as you.

734
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:06,993
What are you talking about?

735
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:09,152
I just found out 12 hours ago.

736
00:43:09,285 --> 00:43:10,354
You knew.

737
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,624
You admitted it to
yourself 12 hours ago.

738
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:16,694
You wanna know
something funny?

739
00:43:17,727 --> 00:43:18,762
Mhm.

740
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:24,001
If it weren't
for the separation

741
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,303
and Skype.

742
00:43:27,737 --> 00:43:28,839
Yeah?

743
00:43:30,406 --> 00:43:33,143
I never could have done
what we did last night.

744
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:34,678
Okay.

745
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:36,211
I see that.

746
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,816
I mean, this is
probably bad to say, but

747
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:42,152
this pandemic saved my life.

748
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,155
Thanks to you.

749
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:47,157
Girl, this is
probably bad to say,

750
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,261
but you should come
over here right now.

751
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,896
What?

752
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,632
Oh, this is crazy.

753
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,901
I need to hold you, kiss you,

754
00:43:58,034 --> 00:44:00,270
and make you feel as
special as you are.

755
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:03,207
I... I don't.

756
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,174
Kiss me.

757
00:44:05,608 --> 00:44:06,743
On the screen?

758
00:44:07,577 --> 00:44:10,380
Computer screens are
seven times more dirty

759
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,082
than your toilet.

760
00:44:12,215 --> 00:44:16,220
Not yours, and especially
not yours during coronavirus.

761
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:19,623
I know you, you clean that
screen every 10 minutes.

762
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,861
Happy?

763
00:44:24,594 --> 00:44:25,729
Horrified.

764
00:44:25,862 --> 00:44:27,164
Who am I, your mother?

765
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,434
Oh, you do not wanna
bring up my mother.

766
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:34,905
Hmm.

767
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:39,043
Do something sexy.

768
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,778
You are like a dirty old man.

769
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:44,714
Oh, damn, below the belt.

770
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:46,784
Literally.

771
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:51,455
I like you.

772
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:53,556
Yeah?

773
00:44:53,923 --> 00:44:57,361
Even though I take forever?

774
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,797
Forever.

775
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:02,598
Forever.

776
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,270
I like the sound of that.

777
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,541
I've never said that
to anyone before.

778
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,212
I've never heard that
word from anyone before.

779
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:23,853
♪ We're so much better, it's
harder, better, for many ♪

780
00:45:35,298 --> 00:45:38,235
Come in.

781
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:40,536
Hey.

782
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:42,471
Hey.

783
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:45,642
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said last night.

784
00:45:45,775 --> 00:45:47,377
You're making dinner?

785
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:48,845
Oh no, no, no.

786
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,659
This is just a care
package for a neighbor.

787
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:55,051
Um, yeah, I'm gonna go deliver
that and I'll be right back,

788
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,454
so just make
yourself comfortable.

789
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,588
Okay.

790
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:06,930
I heard.

791
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,066
Don't worry about it.

792
00:46:15,872 --> 00:46:17,174
At least you get free food.

793
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,918
I guess he sensed
you were jumping ship.

794
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,610
Now he's gonna get all
syrupy sweet on ya.

795
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:23,881
Whatever it takes to keep
his ship dock in bay, right?

796
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,888
Why did I ever agree
to have dinner with you?

797
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:29,185
I don't know, chalk it
up to being bored stiff

798
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,688
and taking pity on
your loser neighbor.

799
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,857
Hey, whatever's in
here smells nice.

800
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,826
Goodnight.
Night.

801
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,028
I bought ear plugs.

802
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,436
Anyway,

803
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:51,241
I've been thinking a lot

804
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,952
about what you said last
night and you're right.

805
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,911
I have been neglectful and been

806
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,046
way too preoccupied with work,

807
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,016
but I don't work
tomorrow morning,

808
00:47:00,149 --> 00:47:02,019
so if you want me to
stay the night I can,

809
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,854
unless you just wanna
sit here and talk.

810
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:04,987
Why?

811
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:06,456
Why what?

812
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,358
Seem like you're acting
different lately.

813
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:10,369
I just wanna make sure that
you're not paying me a visit

814
00:47:10,393 --> 00:47:14,164
because you're worried
that I'm having doubts.

815
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,834
That was no.

816
00:47:20,903 --> 00:47:22,272
I should go.

817
00:47:22,405 --> 00:47:25,275
Nope, no, no, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry. I just...

818
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,252
I've just been locked in
this place for too long

819
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:29,145
and I've left to my thoughts

820
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,249
and just making up
problems that don't exist.

821
00:47:32,915 --> 00:47:33,915
Oh.

822
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,053
How can I make it up to you?

823
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:38,821

Bye.

842
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:03,974
Morning.

843
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:08,945
You know, I was gonna tell you

844
00:49:09,078 --> 00:49:11,280
that James and I
almost broke up,

845
00:49:11,414 --> 00:49:13,984
but then I realized I
was sounding like you,

846
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,518
and then I knew I was wrong,

847
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:18,621
so I don't understand
how you have the nerve

848
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,324
to tell me anything.

849
00:49:21,324 --> 00:49:23,794
Yeah, I'll let you finish.

850
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:25,595
It's more than I
can say for James.

851
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:27,597
Does he ever let you...

852
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,499
finish?

853
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:35,505
But you're nothing
like him at all, right?

854
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:39,977
With some, sure, the ones
that I don't care about.

855
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:43,913
But that's not me.

856
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,985
You truly care about me, right?

857
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,724
Yeah.

858
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:06,402

by the way, your dish.

00:50:08,871 --> 00:50:11,274

Reading a script.

You're up for a role.

886
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:37,627

all of Hollywood shut down.

00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:47,436
This script doesn't
necessarily have a role for me,

890
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:51,407
but I just like reading
it for fun and to learn.

891
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:55,378
If you could play any
role, what would you play?

892
00:51:55,511 --> 00:51:56,679
Cleopatra.

893
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,815
Cleopatra, really?

894
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,284
She's your role model?

895
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:03,453
She was a con artist whore.

896
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,755
Wow.

897
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:09,693
Sorry, actually, I
think I'm mixing her up with me.

898
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:12,362
You're sexy when you
shake your head like that,

899
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,499
not as sexy as Cleopatra though.

900
00:52:16,632 --> 00:52:18,468
You might have to work on that.

901
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:20,737
I will work on it

902
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,974
just as soon as you work
on your John McClain.

903
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:28,511
♪ I'm at home on layaway ♪

904
00:52:28,644 --> 00:52:32,615
♪ I'm going a little cray ♪

905
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:36,486
♪ Free time's a favor but
I'll pay for it later ♪

906
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:41,090
♪ Well I'm on my layaway ♪

907
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,861
♪ I'm still here ♪

908
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,932
♪ Still here ♪

909
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,065
Howdy sis?

910
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:50,934
What are you doing here?

911
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,401
I told you to call me.

912
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:56,505
Figures you'd show up
maskless and carefree.

913
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:59,275
I think you mean careless
and you'd probably be right.

914
00:52:59,408 --> 00:53:00,677
I couldn't care less,

915
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,578
but your call was
quite a step up

916
00:53:02,711 --> 00:53:06,550
from your usual text
message with smiley faces so

917
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,383
what's up?

918
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,818
Have to be something up?

919
00:53:08,951 --> 00:53:10,629
Considering you've
never invited me over.

920
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:12,355
And I still haven't
invited you over.

921
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:14,691
And you have yet
to invite me in.

922
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,395
You know, I wanted
to invite you over

923
00:53:19,528 --> 00:53:20,964
before all of this stuff,

924
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:25,702
but I've always been
on the road nonstop.

925
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,706
Besides you're busy
with your family and

926
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,741
you're so far away.

927
00:53:31,874 --> 00:53:34,644
I drove over here
in less than an hour,

928
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,581
so I repeat, what's up?

929
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:39,781
I

930
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:42,986
wanted to touch base.

931
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:46,423
I mean, you have no
idea how lonely it is

932
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,993
when you're single
during a stay at home.

933
00:53:51,894 --> 00:53:52,894
What's up?

934
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,265
I found someone,
I met somebody.

935
00:53:56,432 --> 00:53:58,901
And I thought you
said you were lonely.

936
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,604
Well, tell me about him.

937
00:54:01,737 --> 00:54:02,737
He's

938
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:12,047
a she.

939
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,288
So what, you
just got so lonely

940
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,823
you figured any port in a storm?

941
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:21,791
I think I've always
been in this port.

942
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,427
Maybe you've never
been in a storm.

943
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,995
Well what do you want me to say?

944
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,231
That it's all fine and dandy?

945
00:54:28,364 --> 00:54:29,532
No problem?

946
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,735
Don't give our entire
upbringing another thought?

947
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,037
God.

948
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:39,007
Yeah.

949
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:40,944
This is rich.

950
00:54:42,111 --> 00:54:43,746
Remember this?
Hmm?

951
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,817
The unrighteous shall not
inherit the kingdom of God.

952
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:52,054
Homosexuals will not
inherit the kingdom of God.

953
00:54:52,321 --> 00:54:55,959
Nor adulterers, nor drunkards,

954
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:59,329
1 Corinthians 6:9 and 10.

955
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:02,465
Forget it.

956
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,577
Come on Paul, what
would Jesus say?

957
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:20,850
He would probably
say something like

958
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:24,387
above all, love
each other deeply

959
00:55:25,554 --> 00:55:28,858
because love can cover
a multitude of sins.

960
00:55:30,526 --> 00:55:32,595
Peter 4:8.

961
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,297
Not that I sinned.

962
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,867
Between the two of us,
you were always the saint.

963
00:55:39,435 --> 00:55:40,904
I'm the last person

964
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:43,039
that should be throwing
stones from my glass house.

965
00:55:46,442 --> 00:55:47,777
You look happy.

966
00:55:51,714 --> 00:55:53,516
I'm happy for you.

967
00:55:58,054 --> 00:55:58,821
Come on.

968
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:01,991
COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID.

969
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,760
I love you.

970
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,565
I love you too.

971
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:11,234
Put a mask on.

972
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:30,853
COSM.

973
00:56:31,687 --> 00:56:34,090
Comes from the Greek
word for order.

974
00:56:34,223 --> 00:56:36,960
Since the Greeks believe the
universe was an orderly place,

975
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:41,230
words in this group usually
relate to the universe,

976
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:44,500
so cosmonaut was the
word for space traveler

977
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:46,669
from the former Soviet Union,

978
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,638
the roots of our
own word, astronaut,

979
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:50,974
suggests star traveler instead.

980
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:54,177
Oddly enough, cosmetics
comes from the same roots

981
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,978
since putting things
in order is similar

982
00:56:56,111 --> 00:56:58,948
to decorating something
such as your face.

983
00:57:00,716 --> 00:57:02,518
I have to bite off that.

984
00:57:02,651 --> 00:57:04,687
Gimme a book so I can read.

985
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:09,292
I just feel like our
vocabulary is so limited,

986
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,894
including mine.

987
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,762
Hence the book.

988
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:16,098
I mean, look at the
songs we listen to,

989
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:19,802
the rhymes and the lyrics
are so predictable.

990
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:24,274
I mean, how can someone
write meaningful songs

991
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:28,243
if they don't study the
meaning of the words?

992
00:57:28,377 --> 00:57:29,746
Why listen to rap?

993
00:57:31,313 --> 00:57:32,949
Not the dumb shit rap,

994
00:57:33,282 --> 00:57:37,620
Drake, Jay-Z, and you
can't forget Tupac.

995
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:42,591
I mean, I don't always agree
with what they're saying,

996
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:45,762
but at least they're
saying something.

997
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:48,565
I don't know, I
like music about love.

998
00:57:49,364 --> 00:57:51,500
I love your smile.

999
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,235
I love your hair.

1000
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:55,505
I love the way you walk.

1001
00:57:56,538 --> 00:57:58,741
There's something about you,

1002
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,179
but nobody ever explains
well that something is.

1003
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:06,081
Like your James.

1004
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:07,717
Here we go.

1005
00:58:09,184 --> 00:58:10,624
All he has to do
is say I love you,

1006
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:14,357
and your heart melts
if he ever has.

1007
00:58:15,157 --> 00:58:18,728
He never has to say
why he actually cares,

1008
00:58:19,595 --> 00:58:23,566
what it is exactly he likes
besides your sugar pot.

1009
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,272
Goin' to school?

1010
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:32,675
Glad you changed the subject

1011
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:35,377
because it was one
word from your last.

1012
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:39,214
Yeah, but if you
really want to know,

1013
00:58:40,015 --> 00:58:42,218
Santa Monica Community College.

1014
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:43,620
Yeah.

1015
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,855
I mean, no one in my
family had a degree

1016
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:50,093
and I'm not looking for sympathy
but I came from nothing,

1017
00:58:50,826 --> 00:58:52,295
less than nothing.

1018
00:58:53,362 --> 00:58:57,033
Unfortunately, my
father wasn't absent.

1019
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,703
It would've been a
lot better if he was,

1020
00:59:00,836 --> 00:59:03,973
if he disappeared the
moment I was born.

1021
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:15,183
I'm sorry.

1022
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:17,654
Really.

1023
00:59:18,921 --> 00:59:22,058
I wasn't exactly born
on third base either,

1024
00:59:23,892 --> 00:59:29,098
but I had two parents,
do have two parents.

1025
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:32,569
Seriously,

1026
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,904
kind of feel you,

1027
00:59:37,005 --> 00:59:39,975
like ya even more knowing
you had to struggle.

1028
00:59:40,108 --> 00:59:44,581
Makes me feel like a loser
for not trying harder.

1029
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:59,895
Time for me to not only improve my
fantastic body and buddy career...

1030
01:00:00,028 --> 01:00:03,967
But time to expand my mind,

1031
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:09,772
my spirit, my cosmos.

1032
01:00:11,573 --> 01:00:12,609
Hmm.

1033
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:18,480
Well, I'm gonna give you
time to expand on that.

1034
01:00:19,147 --> 01:00:21,217
I'm gonna go back
to my apartment.

1035
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:58,281
Good morning.

1036
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,259
Hey, good morning.

1037
01:02:10,392 --> 01:02:11,793
Just wake up?

1038
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:13,362
Read all night.

1039
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,498
Did it hurt?

1040
01:02:16,465 --> 01:02:18,400
Sort of knocked me out.

1041
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:20,903
I was reading about black
holes in the universe

1042
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:23,839
and how they're gonna devour
everything in their paths

1043
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:26,342
and devour Earth.

1044
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,412
It got me thinking,

1045
01:02:31,046 --> 01:02:34,116
if a black hole will eat
everything in their path,

1046
01:02:34,249 --> 01:02:37,920
then at some point they're
gonna explode, right?

1047
01:02:38,053 --> 01:02:40,990
Which means there's gonna
be a whole other Big Bang.

1048
01:02:42,057 --> 01:02:43,392
A new beginning.

1049
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:47,730
Oh, yeah, yeah, I
was thinking that too.

1050
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,501
I know that I baffled
you with my bullshit.

1051
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:55,270
Do you want to try
for dinner again?

1052
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:56,405
Tonight?

1053
01:02:57,105 --> 01:02:59,908
As long as it's not King
James time, you know?

1054
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:04,814
Well, he actually left
town during quarantine.

1055
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:07,349
His work insisted on it.

1056
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:09,318
Outstanding.

1057
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:14,490
That's a major bummer. So,
same time, same place?

1058
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:08,010
Hey stranger.

1059
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:11,080
Not glad to see me?

1060
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:13,782
No, no, no, I am,
I am just surprised.

1061
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,451
You know, quarantine and all.

1062
01:04:15,584 --> 01:04:17,753
Since when do you give
one shit about quarantine

1063
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:20,089
or what anyone says?

1064
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,625
- Whatcha cooking?
- Umm...

1065
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:24,193
I didn't know you knew how.

1066
01:04:24,326 --> 01:04:27,362
I've been learning a lot
of new things these days.

1067
01:04:34,836 --> 01:04:37,173
You turn into a Buddhist monk?

1068
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:40,541
Thank God.

1069
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:45,648
Company?
During quarantine?

1070
01:04:46,915 --> 01:04:50,152
Probably just the
neighbors sharing supplies.

1071
01:04:51,953 --> 01:04:53,923
Oh hey, hey.

1072
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:55,891
Thank you so much.

1073
01:04:56,024 --> 01:04:58,660
- Yeah.
- Hey, I owe you too.

1074
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,596
I'm so sorry, sorry.

1075
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:04,066
Sorry.

1076
01:05:04,699 --> 01:05:06,035
Cool neighbor.

1077
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:08,971
Kind of hot, kind of likes you,

1078
01:05:10,005 --> 01:05:11,940
but she'll have to wait in line.

1079
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:29,225

I'm starved.

1099
01:06:44,366 --> 01:06:47,036
You were a beast last night.

1100
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,472
You weren't so bad yourself.

1101
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,707
Can we turn down the music?

1102
01:06:57,279 --> 01:07:01,017
The only thing you ever made
for me was a phone call.

1103
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:06,889
Your hot neighbor can cook.

1104
01:07:07,022 --> 01:07:08,757
Hunger is the best recipe.

1105
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:11,360
Good sex is the best recipe.

1106
01:07:13,995 --> 01:07:15,765
Can't hear rap right now.

1107
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:18,300
Oh, it's not technically rap.

1108
01:07:19,267 --> 01:07:20,869
Whatever.

1109
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,678
I'll get dressed.

1110
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,314
Okay.

1111
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:34,817
First thing you agreed to.

1112
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,755
I need a new boy toy.

1113
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:46,495
You don't get any more of this.

1114
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:07,083
See ya.

1115
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:11,387
Betty wait.

1116
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:24,499
Be safe.

1117
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:27,136
Take care.

1118
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:33,542
So glad you liked my food.

1119
01:08:35,977 --> 01:08:37,546
Waited up all night?

1120
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:38,980
You wish.

1121
01:08:39,114 --> 01:08:41,216
I was just giving
you time to read your book.

1122
01:08:41,349 --> 01:08:43,385
Build your vocabulary.

1123
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,787
Appreciate it,
and coincidentally,

1124
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,623
one of my new words of
the day was egomaniacal,

1125
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:52,661
which in Latin
means selfish prick.

1126
01:08:53,962 --> 01:08:56,064
I wasn't very
selfish last night.

1127
01:08:56,197 --> 01:08:59,368
I was actually very giving.

1128
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,406
I imagine when you're
giving, you're also taking.

1129
01:09:04,539 --> 01:09:07,076
As far as I remember
you and I are platonic,

1130
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:09,511
which comes from
the Latin Pluto,

1131
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,747
meaning we come from
different planets,

1132
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:15,217
so since this doesn't
matter, what do you think?

1133
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:18,253
Should we do dinner?
Try again tonight?

1134
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:21,156
Tempting, but I'll pass.

1135
01:09:21,523 --> 01:09:23,091
Also you probably got the virus

1136
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,660
from miss Mademoiselle Betty.

1137
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:29,564
I get the feeling that you
weren't her first house call.

1138
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,600
And I think you're
gonna get it from James

1139
01:09:31,733 --> 01:09:34,537
when he comes back
from his business trip.

1140
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,463
Hello Zozo.

1141
01:10:36,965 --> 01:10:38,767
Nice place.

1142
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:42,069
Doing good.

1143
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:46,441
Yeah, it's not
rocket science, Melvin.

1144
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,278
It's just a minimum wage job.

1145
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:58,721
If I could have held a job,

1146
01:10:59,954 --> 01:11:01,957
maybe y'all could have
held onto my family.

1147
01:11:02,624 --> 01:11:06,795
It Held your alcohol
and held your rage.

1148
01:11:08,429 --> 01:11:11,467
What do you want?
To be a dad?

1149
01:11:14,102 --> 01:11:15,637
Because when I look at you,

1150
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:21,042
all I see is what you took
from me and what you gave me.

1151
01:11:21,342 --> 01:11:22,811
You remember this?

1152
01:11:24,212 --> 01:11:25,981
You remember all the other ones?

1153
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:40,529
I'm worthless piece of shit.

1154
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:45,701
Only good I ever done is you.

1155
01:11:50,171 --> 01:11:51,373
I'll disappear.

1156
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,477
Not gonna hold you down anymore.

1157
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:01,750
Do some good in this world.

1158
01:12:06,554 --> 01:12:09,692
Proud of you Zozo, proud of you.

1159
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:21,437
Melvin.

1160
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:35,050
I wanna be able to call you dad.

1161
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,488
I want to be able to hug you.

1162
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,559
I want a dad.

1163
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:48,830
All right.

1164
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:52,801
I'm really trying at
it this time, okay?

1165
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:57,872
Okay.

1166
01:12:59,574 --> 01:13:01,943
All right.

1167
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:17,401
I think I just figured out

1168
01:13:17,425 --> 01:13:18,894
how to obtain world peace.

1169
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:22,998
Imagine two world
leaders sitting down,

1170
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:26,000
eating ice cream,
and declaring war.

1171
01:13:26,134 --> 01:13:28,070
Can't fight while
you eat ice cream?

1172
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:29,504
Simply not possible.

1173
01:13:29,637 --> 01:13:31,607
You really are a goofball.

1174
01:13:33,074 --> 01:13:34,710
I guess you just
bring it outta me.

1175
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:37,011
That's awfully close
to kissing words,

1176
01:13:37,812 --> 01:13:39,948
but at least we have
six feet between us.

1177
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:44,619
Business trip is over

1178
01:13:44,752 --> 01:13:46,392
and now he wants to
take care of business?

1179
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,624
Why is this guy taking
business meetings anyway?

1180
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:50,992
You sure it's safe to see him?

1181
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:54,296
Alex, just stop trying
to get in my head.

1182
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:56,398

It's almost great, but it's

Vis a vis, word of the day.

1193
01:14:46,681 --> 01:14:48,150
Where'd you go?

1194
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:50,151
Vancouver.

1195
01:14:50,785 --> 01:14:52,821
Canada?
So you flew.

1196
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:55,123
Yeah.

1197
01:14:55,256 --> 01:14:58,660
Meaning that you
went to LAX twice.

1198
01:15:01,429 --> 01:15:05,934
You know that you could
be a carrier of the virus,

1199
01:15:07,502 --> 01:15:11,172
meaning that you could
infect me and everyone else.

1200
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:14,843
I don't have any attempts
or any symptoms whatsoever.

1201
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:18,447
You know that symptoms
may never appear

1202
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,115
and you can even have the virus

1203
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,684
and never show any
signs of illness.

1204
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:26,154
You know that governor
issued a stay at home order,

1205
01:15:26,287 --> 01:15:28,623
so what gives you the
right to gallivant?

1206
01:15:28,756 --> 01:15:31,292
Right?
Gallivant?

1207
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:34,029
You really have gone stir crazy.

1208
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:36,932
Maybe you're right.

1209
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:38,977
Maybe I have been cooped
in here for far too long,

1210
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:42,671
but you would have some empathy
if you were doing the same,

1211
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:46,307
and besides it's giving
me time to think,

1212
01:15:46,874 --> 01:15:48,176
to rethink things,

1213
01:15:48,309 --> 01:15:50,946
to think about things
for the very first time.

1214
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:53,315
Such as us.

1215
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:57,551
Yeah.

1216
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:02,991
Such as people who just
keep spreading this thing

1217
01:16:03,124 --> 01:16:07,328
with no qualms about
it, no responsibility.

1218
01:16:07,962 --> 01:16:09,598
I think I should go.

1219
01:16:10,431 --> 01:16:11,431
Really?

1220
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,169
Okay, well then

1221
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,340
you should probably take this.

1222
01:16:19,407 --> 01:16:20,976
So I'm not coming back.

1223
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:24,446
I thought we were
stronger than that.

1224
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:27,281
Can I ask you one random
question before you leave?

1225
01:16:28,182 --> 01:16:29,718
What do you think
about abortion?

1226
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:33,121
Are you pro-choice or pro-life?

1227
01:16:35,323 --> 01:16:36,391
What is so funny?

1228
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:38,839
I just think it's
a random question.

1229
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,127
You've been attacking me

1230
01:16:40,261 --> 01:16:42,096
ever since I walked
through the door.

1231
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,398
I'm pro-life.

1232
01:16:43,531 --> 01:16:47,668
So you're telling me
that if I was pregnant,

1233
01:16:47,802 --> 01:16:50,038
I should have no
choice in the matter?

1234
01:16:51,372 --> 01:16:56,678
That you would want
me to keep your baby?

1235
01:16:56,944 --> 01:16:57,944
You're pregnant?

1236
01:16:58,012 --> 01:16:59,414
No, no, I'm not,

1237
01:16:59,547 --> 01:17:03,251
but your concern is
really touching James.

1238
01:17:03,384 --> 01:17:04,552
It truly is.

1239
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:05,929
We really know nothing
about each other

1240
01:17:05,953 --> 01:17:07,923
and that's not your fault, but...

1241
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:12,628

I'm good, really.

1249
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:51,499
When you realize that
some things were thick,

1250
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:57,939
then it becomes less real
so in a way less painful.

1251
01:17:58,773 --> 01:18:00,441
Bounce back at light speed.

1252
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:03,378
I think you've been hanging
out with me too long.

1253
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,385

hurts, but whatcha gonna do?

Tequila, beer, French
wine, we've got that.

1264
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:04,172
I'm not gonna fall for that.

1265
01:19:04,572 --> 01:19:05,874
Right.

1266
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,446
Hey, this is for you.

1267
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:16,218
Hope you like it.

1268
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,197
Oh.

1269
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:33,401
One for you,

1270
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:35,937
I figured you'd
finish your book soon,

1271
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:37,972
and one for me.

1272
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:39,940
Figured I could
learn a thing or two.

1273
01:19:40,074 --> 01:19:42,043
Once you're finished,
we can swap.

1274
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:46,348
I think you should
start with this one first.

1275
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,384
Hmm.

1276
01:19:54,755 --> 01:19:56,424
Can I be honest with you?

1277
01:20:04,632 --> 01:20:05,632
Look,

1278
01:20:08,269 --> 01:20:12,908
this is gonna sound
story book stupid but

1279
01:20:15,142 --> 01:20:20,015
I don't think I'd be the
man I am today without you.

1280
01:20:22,516 --> 01:20:26,521
You sound like a
Jane Austen novel.

1281
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:31,326
I guess we should
thank COVID-19.

1282
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:36,298
How long do you
think it'll last?

1283
01:20:36,931 --> 01:20:39,100
The virus or us?

1284
01:20:39,834 --> 01:20:41,603
The stay at home.

1285
01:20:41,936 --> 01:20:43,805
Hopefully as long as possible.

1286
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:49,344
In the meantime we can
read books together.

1287
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:53,081
I just really say that?

1288
01:20:53,781 --> 01:20:55,717
Now I think that you've
been hanging around

1289
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,385
with me for too long.

1290
01:20:58,787 --> 01:20:59,787
Yeah.

1291
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:06,394
We'll kiss at some point, right?

1292
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:14,602
Movie time on the roof!
Roof in five!

1293
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:16,037
Don't be late!

1294
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:18,573
Come on,

1295
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,640
let's go.

1296
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:31,619
Melvin, it's awfully good
of you to pay Zoe's rent,

1297
01:21:31,752 --> 01:21:33,021
and I'm thankful

1298
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:34,564
I don't have to hand out
another eviction notice.

1299
01:21:34,588 --> 01:21:37,324
I'm just trying to make
up a lost time, brother.

1300
01:21:37,825 --> 01:21:39,661
Saving Zoe, save myself.

1301
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:42,630
Well, it seems like you're
off to a really good start.

1302

I think I'm far
enough away from you.

1317
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:02,176
I'm gonna take this off.

1318
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,980
Well, it seems that since
we've been sequestered

1319
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:08,115
and told we
shouldn't see anyone,

1320
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:10,684
we've actually somehow
gotten to know each other

1321
01:23:10,818 --> 01:23:12,053
a little bit better.

1322
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:15,223
Some of us even speaking
for the first time

1323
01:23:15,356 --> 01:23:17,292
and I am just grateful

1324
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:19,460
that when they closed
our country down,

1325
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:22,630
it only managed to
open up our hearts,

1326
01:23:22,763 --> 01:23:26,834
so welcome to the buildings
first movie night!

1327
01:23:26,967 --> 01:23:28,536
Hopefully the first of many.

1328
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,472
Since the pandemic
has got us all

1329
01:23:31,605 --> 01:23:36,677
rethinking our goals and our
values and our relationships,

1330
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:38,712
I hope that you like
the movie I picked

1331
01:23:38,846 --> 01:23:40,682
and find it appropriate.

1332
01:23:43,484 --> 01:23:44,686
When I come through.

1333
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:46,720

1335
01:23:48,022 --> 01:23:49,456
You want the moon?

1336
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:51,725
Just say the word and I'll
throw a lasso around it

1337
01:23:51,859 --> 01:23:52,893
and pull it down.

1338
01:23:53,027 --> 01:23:55,096
Hey, that's pretty good idea.

1339
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:56,831
