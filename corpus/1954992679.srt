1
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,870
Does your breath always stink?

2
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:15,340
Oh, shit!

3
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:21,146
Fucking clapped that garbage.

4
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:24,716
You coming?

5
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,819
Yeah.

6
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:33,125
See that? That's crazy.

7
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,864
Wait, wait.

8
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,066
Slow down.

9
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,968
Wait.
- What are you doing?

10
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,638
I forgot my key.

11
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:50,876
This is a nice area.

12
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:53,879
Right?

13
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,848
Do you rent?

14
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,920
Come on in.

15
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:08,393
Impressive.
- Thank you.

16
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:11,130
What did you say you did again?

17
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,165
Insider tradings.

18
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,566
Just so you know,

19
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,068
I don't do this that much,
like, hardly ever,

20
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,303
so don't be nervous.
Yeah, yeah.

21
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,306
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

22
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,275
You have a girlfriend
or something?

23
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,344
Because I don't care.
It's totally fine.

24
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,712
No, no, I would never...
i would never...

25
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:28,247
you would never
have a girlfriend?

26
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,915
No, I would never cheat on a...

27
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,483
so, you have a...
do you have a girlfriend?

28
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:36,021
No, I don't.
I was just... I wanted a second.

29
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,259
Why don't we have some wine?

30
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,728
I have wine. Want some?

31
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,264
Yeah.
- Okay.

32
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,143
This is a really nice place.

33
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,611
Think fast.
- What?

34
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,082
God. Where did you get this?

35
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,952
A wine place.

36
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,921
This is like an $800 bottle.

37
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:11,890
Well, then it better be good.

38
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,798
Whoa.

39
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,099
Just use an opener.

40
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,235
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

41
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:26,471
Let's get some glasses.

42
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,342
Hey, hey.

43
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:34,346
That's some
really expensive wine.

44
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,349
All right. I'm good.

45
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,957
Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,158
There we go.

47
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,293
Mmm.

48
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:53,565
Not used to...

49
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,049
Shit.

50
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:17,923
Are you crazy?

51
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,593
What?

52
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,929
Oh!

53
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,566
Jesus Christ.

54
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,568
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

55
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,137
We don't need
to smash everything.

56
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,606
I'm so drunk.
- Really?

57
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,810
I feel like you
didn't even drink anything.

58
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,319
Want to go upstairs?

59
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,598
You're the hottest girl
that has ever shown

60
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,933
an interest in me before.

61
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:05,470
Are you latina?

62
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,340
I feel like you're latina.

63
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,015
Shit.

64
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,694
Hello?

65
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,464
Lady?

66
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,139
Crazy.

67
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,928
Okay!

68
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:44,002
I'm just gonna uber so you
don't have to worry about it!

69
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,705
Thank you?

70
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,955
Fuck you.

71
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,599
Yeah?
- Hey.

72
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,969
Peter. How was the flight?

73
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,637
Short flight. We didn't crash.

74
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,040
Real success story.
What do you want?

75
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,641
Good. And the hotel's good?

76
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,510
Everybody's happy
with the accommodations?

77
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,312
They're super swank, man.

78
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,247
What's up?

79
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,016
I'm in will's house.

80
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,586
I'm sorry?

81
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,554
I'm standing in will's kitchen.

82
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,023
I'm looking
at will's family portrait.

83
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,358
I don't... I-I...

84
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,997
Okay, well, you need to explain
to me why you're there.

85
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,066
Ii - after you guys
left the banquet,

86
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:24,169
I met this girl,
and... and we had drinks

87
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,937
and... and it was going
really well.

88
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,539
I think she... I think she...
i think she liked me.

89
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,341
And then I went back
to her house,

90
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,644
and, um, the only problem is,
it's not her house.

91
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,247
It's, uh...

92
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,549
It's will's house.

93
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,051
Where is she now?

94
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,319
Kevin.

95
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,155
You know, at the...

96
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,092
Moment, I don't...

97
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,961
Kevin, where is she now?
This is very important.

98
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:53,064
I have to call you back.
- No. Kevin...

99
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,715
lady!

100
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,852
Hello? Hello?

101
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,657
Peter. Hello?

102
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,329
Oh, fuck.

103
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,331
Hello... oh, god. Hello?

104
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,367
Shit. Oh, my god.

105
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,635
Oh, shit.

106
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,738
Hey, get up!

107
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,308
Get up! Okay, get up.

108
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,342
Let's go. Wake up.

109
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,277
Come on. Come on.

110
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,745
There you go. Okay.

111
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,881
Okay. Now we're talking.

112
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,849
Did you take some...

113
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,284
did you take something?

114
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,620
Did you take something?
Look at me. Hey.

115
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,255
Hey! Wake up!

116
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,625
Hey, Peter.

117
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,026
You tell me
what's going on right now.

118
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,062
I'm sorry.
I need to call an ambulance.

119
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,663
Ow.
- This girl took something.

120
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,498
What's her name?
- Who cares?

121
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,733
She needs an ambulance.

122
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,835
Calm down. What is her name?

123
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,003
Tell me to calm down, Peter.

124
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,905
Look, I don't know her name!

125
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,640
Well, what does she look like?

126
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,508
She's little.
She's got brown hair.

127
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,044
She's... she's... she's pretty.
I think she's a latina.

128
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,247
Is she wearing a red dress?
- She was.

129
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,282
Why?

130
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,150
Okay, we can't call 911.

131
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,820
What?
- Is she still breathing?

132
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,088
How did you know
she was wearing a red dress?

133
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,857
Is she still fucking breathing,
Kevin?

134
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,592
Yes, she's still breathing!

135
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:28,927
Okay, listen to me.

136
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,262
What I'm about to tell you
stays between us.

137
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,565
Okay.
- Tell me that you understand

138
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,900
the severity of the situation.

139
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,269
This can't be shared
with anyone.

140
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,671
Uhhuh. Yeah.

141
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,072
I'm serious, Kevin.

142
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,341
Nobody else knows about this.
Of course.

143
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:46,111
About a year ago,
this girl seduced will.

144
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:49,280
Was a huge mistake,
one-time thing.

145
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,782
He cut it off immediately,

146
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,518
but she became obsessed
with him.

147
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,656
Now, if you call 911, the press
is gonna get wind of this.

148
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,659
We can't have that,
not this week.

149
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,360
What am I supposed to do?
- Sit tight.

150
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,929
I'm gonna send one
of our doctors to you.

151
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:08,967
In the meantime,
you got to make her throw up.

152
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,803
P-Peter, I'm n-not really,
um, comfortable with that.

153
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,773
I don't care what you're
comfortable with, Kevin.

154
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,441
That's what you do.

155
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:17,809
Okay.

156
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,310
But don't you think
it'd be a lot simpler

157
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,879
if I just took her
to the hospital, then...

158
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,047
then they could do
what they need to do?

159
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,049
Dr. Newman can get to you

160
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,184
before you can get
to a hospital.

161
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,085
The foot guy?!

162
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,554
Yes. He is a foot specialist.

163
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,623
He is also a real physician.

164
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,625
O...
- Oh, Kevin?

165
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,827
Fine.
- One more thing.

166
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,295
This is your clusterfuck.

167
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:41,866
If she doesn't make it,
she was your girlfriend.

168
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,072
Shit.

169
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,908
Here we go. Okay.

170
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,609
I want to apologize.

171
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:56,281
I don't want to do this as much
as you don't want to do this.

172
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,782
Okay, all right.

173
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,218
Uh...

174
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,491
There we go. There we go.

175
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,296
Oh!

176
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,504
Okay, you're doing good.

177
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,774
That's good. That's good.

178
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,509
That feel better?

179
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,777
There you go.
- I'm all better.

180
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,113
You're good. Good.
- I'm better.

181
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,849
Hey, Dr. Newman.
- Kevin, hello.

182
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,317
It took a little trying.

183
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:35,286
But I got her to throw up,
so everything's good.

184
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,321
Oh, yeah.

185
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:39,591
Yeah, you didn't need
to do that.

186
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,025
What?

187
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,961
So, her body's already absorbed
whatever she took,

188
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:46,431
so that didn't really
help at all.

189
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,699
Great.

190
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:48,933
Okay, so
what are we dealing with here?

191
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,735
Is it sleeping pills,
painkillers?

192
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,837
What do we got?

193
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,873
I-I have no idea.
- Okay.

194
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,374
Uh, look for an empty bottle.

195
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,577
It's probably somewhere close.

196
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,812
Empty bottle.

197
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,213
Just look on the floor,

198
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,149
look behind the toilet,
look in the shower.

199
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,517
Just look for that empty bottle.

200
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,185
You'll be just fine. Okay.

201
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,788
I'm gonna... I'm gonna lean you
just like that.

202
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,956
Just stay right there. Oh, no.

203
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,458
Okay, Dr. Newman, I'm looking.

204
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,460
Kevin, just start breathing.
You need to breathe.

205
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,662
I'm breathing,
I'm breathing, I'm...

206
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,230
Breathing. How are you?

207
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,799
Oh, well, thank you for asking.

208
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,433
Today I went to the circus
with my daughter.

209
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,836
Oh, that sounds like a...
i got it!

210
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,305
It's Xanax.
- Ah, bingo!

211
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,540
We got a winner.

212
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:29,808
Okay, what's the dosage?

213
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,843
.5 milligrams.

214
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,978
Ugh. And the bottle's empty?

215
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,847
Yep. Totally... totally...
totally empty.

216
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,715
Okay. Sit tight.

217
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,884
I'll be there in 10 minutes.
Okay.

218
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,085
You know what?
Hang on a second.

219
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,187
I'm gonna sing you
a little song.

220
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,322
Okay.
- It's gonna help. Ready?

221
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,530
Okay. Okay. I'm...
I'm gonna hang up, doctor.

222
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,933
Okay, great.

223
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,479
Hi. Doctor, thank you so much.
I am so... so sorry about this.

224
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,081
Lead the way. Lead the way.
- She's... she's upstairs.

225
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,616
Obviously, you know,
t-this is not how

226
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,418
I thought t-this was gonna
happen, you know.

227
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,487
God. Did you take something?
- Sorry.

228
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,356
We were in the bathroom.
I don't know if...

229
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,258
if you're supposed to lean
her up like that, but I did.

230
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,427
Oh. Okay. All right,
this is what I need you to do.

231
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,796
She threw up a bunch, and...
- Yeah, yeah.

232
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,297
Okay,
this is what I need you to do.

233
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,099
I need you to go to the kitchen,
make a pot of coffee,

234
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:31,336
pour a mug 3/4 full, then
you fill the rest with whiskey,

235
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:34,239
and you need like a teaspoon
of brown sugar in it, all right?

236
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,407
You want me to make
an Irish coffee?

237
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:41,446
Whipped cream would be
fantastic.

238
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:44,148
Go.

239
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,485
She's got great feet.

240
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,072
Okay. She's doing okay.

241
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,541
She's doing okay.
Here's your Irish coffee.

242
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,776
That's for you.

243
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,845
All right, so we're not
out of the woods yet.

244
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,413
Normally I'd attach
a heart monitor,

245
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,915
but since that's not an option,

246
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,516
you're just gonna
have to keep her awake.

247
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,853
Keep her awake? What happens
if she falls asleep?

248
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,022
Well, then her brain will stop
sending the signal to her lungs

249
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,090
that she needs to breathe.

250
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,792
But you're not gonna let
that happen, so we don't have to

251
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,895
worry about that, do we?

252
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,897
Wwhere are you going?

253
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,299
I'm going home.

254
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,601
Drink up.

255
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,506
Wwait, doctor.

256
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,808
Fuck.

257
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,043
You're leaving?

258
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,411
You got to give her
a cold shower,

259
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,846
pour some regular coffee...
You can't leave.

260
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,615
Listen, she's gonna
be a little confused at first.

261
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,150
This is an emergency situation.
- Just ask her name.

262
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,618
I'm pretty sure
it's not mort Stevens.

263
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,620
You know what I'm saying?
Ask her where she is,

264
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,221
who she is, who's the president
of the United States,

265
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,489
all that kind of stuff.

266
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,191
I could really use
your help here.

267
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,693
Listen, listen, you just
got to keep her awake all night.

268
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:02,994
You're gonna be fine, okay?

269
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,529
You got this.

270
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,998
That's a fist bump. You failed.

271
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,866
All right. Good luck.

272
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,502
Ccome on, we... b...

273
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,571
fucking foot guy.

274
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,117
No.
- Yes.

275
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,386
No, no, no, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

276
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,155
No, no, no, no.

277
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,490
No, no, no, not in the bath,
not in the bath.

278
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,059
That's a drowning place.
That's a drowning place.

279
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,327
Okay. Come on.

280
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,431
There we go. There we go.

281
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,900
There you go. Good girl.

282
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,469
All right.

283
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:56,080
Sit, sit, sit.
Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.

284
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,982
No, no, no,
don't go out of the shower.

285
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,017
Get in the shower.

286
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,918
Sit.

287
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,520
Sit down.

288
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,623
Oh.

289
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,567
Hey. Head up.

290
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,636
Drink it.

291
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,004
No.

292
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,239
Drink the coffee.

293
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,940
I don't want the coffee.
- Tough shit.

294
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:26,611
Drink the coffee.

295
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:30,581
I'm supposed
to ask you some questions.

296
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,585
Probably be good if I knew
your name at this point.

297
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,724
What's your name?

298
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,359
I don't remember it.

299
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,327
You can't remember your name?
You have amnesia?

300
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,796
Do you know my name?

301
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,531
No, that's why I just
asked you two seconds ago.

302
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:50,935
Well, then you're very
romantic 'cause we just had sex.

303
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,204
Oh, you remember that?

304
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:56,274
Barely. Barely.

305
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,910
That's funny.
Do you know my name?

306
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,711
Yep.

307
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,513
Fernando.

308
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,614
What?

309
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,017
Fernando.
- Do I look like a Fernando?

310
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,151
You are so racist.

311
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,386
How is that racist?

312
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,254
Because you could be
a Fernando.

313
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,557
I've never been confused
with a Fernando before.

314
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,058
You're a racist.
- I'm a racist?

315
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,227
You're a racist.
- Okay.

316
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,695
Drink your coffee.

317
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:21,065
I had sex with a racist.

318
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,634
Add it to the list.

319
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,749
Madeline Parker.

320
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,952
That's a good name.

321
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,453
That's a pretty name.

322
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,656
Well, it is nice to meet you,
I guess.

323
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,125
I'm Kevin.

324
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,461
I know you're confused right now

325
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,831
and that there is a lot of stuff
being thrown at you.

326
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:59,770
But I would like to know why the
fuck we are in my boss's house.

327
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,572
Excuse me, Kevin,

328
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,809
but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

329
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:10,915
And I'm really, really, really
foggy, so...

330
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:16,988
I don't know how to help you
or whatever you are...

331
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,489
okay.

332
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,725
Well, when everything clears up
up there for you,

333
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,426
we are gonna have a lot
to talk about.

334
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,728
Hey.

335
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,230
Hey!

336
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,169
I'm sorry that I'm gonna...
get the fuck up.

337
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,370
Ow!

338
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,539
God damn it.

339
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,174
You're like a fucking child.

340
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,508
I am so sleepy.

341
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,976
Yeah, I know you're sleepy.

342
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,012
That's what happens
when you swallow all that Xanax.

343
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:44,048
Two quick minutes
and I promise I won't die.

344
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,616
You know I can't do that.

345
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,151
Right.
You want to have sex again?

346
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,186
What? No.

347
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,687
I know that look.
- No.

348
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,056
You're tenacious.
- Not interested.

349
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:58,029
You mean you've never,
ever wanted to fuck a starfish?

350
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:02,099
This is the least attractive
thing I've seen you do.

351
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,402
Ugh.

352
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,973
Okay.

353
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,242
Let's talk.

354
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,710
You have any pets?

355
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,146
Wow. That is a boring intro.

356
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:16,981
What? You got a cat?
- I got a dog.

357
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,349
You have a dog?
- Yeah.

358
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,184
What's his name?
- How do you know it's a he?

359
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,286
Okay, what's her name?
- It's a he.

360
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,589
Okay,
what's your male dog's name?

361
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:25,823
Fernando.

362
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:29,260
The dog's name is Fernando.

363
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,128
Where are you from?

364
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,030
My mom's vagina.
- And where was

365
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,800
your mother's vagina located
when you dropped out of it?

366
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,068
Shitsville, Ohio.

367
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,971
Shitsville, Ohio?
Is there a six flags near there?

368
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:42,540
Yeah.

369
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,775
I guess.

370
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,478
Where are you from?

371
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,113
Born and raised here.

372
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,884
What?

373
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:54,919
You're fancy.

374
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,054
That's fancy?
- Yeah.

375
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,556
Everyone from Allen has money?

376
00:20:58,558 --> 00:20:59,890
Yeah.

377
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,525
You know that stereotype
is bullshit, right?

378
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,461
Okay, yeah,
you're from the ghetto.

379
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,962
Not from the ghetto
or the slums.

380
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,597
You've seen some real shit?
- It's not about that.

381
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,032
I'm just saying...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

382
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:13,871
There's a lot
of economic diversity in Allen.

383
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,942
What do you do?

384
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,010
Wow!

385
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,178
What do you do?

386
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,313
Personal architect.

387
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:23,347
You're a personal architect?

388
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,316
I'm a personal.

389
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:26,984
What do you do for a living?

390
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,052
Body painting.

391
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,186
You're a body painter?

392
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,321
I paint bodies.

393
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:31,422
What is your job?

394
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:34,225
I'm a bartender.

395
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:36,794
What's wrong with you?

396
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:41,799
I serve overpriced drinks
to townies like you.

397
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,769
Just 'cause I live here,
that does not make me a townie.

398
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:47,305
Okay.

399
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,407
What do you do? Wait.

400
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,376
Let me guess.

401
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:55,379
Aspiring actress.

402
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:59,016
You're gonna make it good.

403
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:04,221
I think you know
who I work for.

404
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:07,892
Fuck it.

405
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,260
This is too awkward
for me right now.

406
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:13,397
This is the most infuriating.

407
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,370
Time to exercise!

408
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:21,639
Ow! My lungs! You idiot!

409
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,341
Here we go.
- That really hurts.

410
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:26,711
I'm sorry,
but we got to work out.

411
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:29,780
Okay, we're just gonna
take a little walk.

412
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,649
All right. Just walk.

413
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:33,117
That's all you have to do
is just keep yourself...

414
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,352
oh, my god.

415
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:35,886
Is that your toenail?
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:39,190
It's been awhile since I...
Your talons.

417
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,494
Can you hold on one second?
Just please keep walking.

418
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,730
Hey.
How's it going there, champ?

419
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:46,997
You know, I think,
uh, pretty good.

420
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,633
Everything seems to be
under control.

421
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,268
Shit.
- Whoa.

422
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,870
Oh, no.

423
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:53,938
Kevin?

424
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,139
You are so dumb.
- Kevin, what is that?

425
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,240
Huh?

426
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,942
What? Here we go.

427
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:00,211
What was that?
- You hurt my rib, you idiot!

428
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,012
Huh?

429
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,248
Kevin,
you have to talk to me now.

430
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,750
Talk to me now, son.
- Oh, god.

431
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:08,052
What was that?
- Oh, god.

432
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:12,890
Oh, nothing, uh, a plate fell
and it's making me cough.

433
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,091
A plate fell.

434
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,659
A plate fell, he says.

435
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:19,296
Okay, please don't wreck
coach's house.

436
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,698
I won't, Peter.

437
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,100
Hey, fuck you, Peter!

438
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,902
Go fuck yourself, you dickbag!

439
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,170
Shut up.

440
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:27,571
That's for you.

441
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,440
We we got to keep her
under control, Kevin.

442
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:30,641
You're dumb!

443
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,009
Shut the fuck up.

444
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:34,011
You are being so rude.

445
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,446
You're a dickhole!

446
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,580
What is she saying?

447
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,783
She says you're a dickhole.

448
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:42,820
All right, well, at least
she's feeling better, right?

449
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,989
Yeah, I think she really
turned a corner.

450
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:48,125
All right,
well, keep me posted, okay?

451
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:50,327
Have you mentioned anything
to will about this?

452
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,129
No, I'm gonna do that
right now.

453
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,466
If you could maybe just, um,
reiterate to him when you do

454
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:57,935
how much I respect him and...
and... and I would never want

455
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,070
to get involved
in his personal life, of course.

456
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:03,073
Look, take it easy.

457
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,742
You're gonna be fine.

458
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:08,245
Right now, we just
have to keep a lid on this.

459
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:11,882
Don't let her talk to anyone
and don't let her leave.

460
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,684
That might be a bit
of a challenge.

461
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,020
I know you never had sex,
Peter.

462
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:19,623
I know you're a virgin, Peter!

463
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,859
Okay, buddy, look,

464
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:23,694
you're really saving will's ass
on this.

465
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,396
We're not gonna
forget about you.

466
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:28,299
I'm gonna be on the first plane
out of L.A.X. In the morning.

467
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:31,402
I should be down there
at 7:00 A.M. to relieve you.

468
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:32,503
Okay.

469
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:35,706
I won't let anybody down.

470
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,446
What?

471
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,015
So you know Peter?

472
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:47,084
I know<i> a</i> Peter.
- Can we have just,

473
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:49,286
like, a normal conversation
for two seconds?

474
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:51,522
I know about you and will.

475
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,261
I need a fucking cigarette.

476
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,831
You shouldn't smoke.

477
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,900
It's bad for your health.

478
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:05,936
Thank you.

479
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,407
What'd he tell you?

480
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:11,675
You know, everything.

481
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,144
That you guys
had a one-night stand

482
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:17,448
and that you got all crazy
and obsessive.

483
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,983
So typical.

484
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:23,988
You think he would really
leave his wife and kids for...

485
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,723
For what?

486
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:28,559
For what? I'm interested.

487
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,261
I'm genuinely interested
in what you have to say.

488
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:31,428
Nothing.
- For what?

489
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,530
Nothing.
- For what?

490
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,797
Some crazy slut you take home

491
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,133
for a cheap fuck?
That's not what I meant.

492
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,102
Isn't that
what happened tonight?

493
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:41,238
Isn't that what happened?

494
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,408
Tonight you...

495
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,877
You took me home.

496
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,183
And with that, I'm leaving.
- Where you going? Come on.

497
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,485
No, come on.

498
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:57,254
Let's just relax for a second
and talk.

499
00:25:57,256 --> 00:26:00,824
Relax?!

500
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,059
I'm sorry,
but I can't let you leave.

501
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,928
Where is my dress?
- I don't know.

502
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,330
We took it off in,
like, a big rush.

503
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:07,565
Turn around.

504
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:08,999
Turn around, you perv! God!

505
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,168
Okay, I saw it all anyway
like an hour ago.

506
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,403
Yeah, and then I tried
to kill myself.

507
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,971
You do the math.

508
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:16,073
That's not why you tried
to kill yourself. Come on.

509
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,243
Oh, you know why? You know why?

510
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,579
I've never gotten, you know,
that bad of a response.

511
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,148
Shut up.
Shut up. Shut your mouth.

512
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,084
Zipper.
I don't think that you should

513
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,852
drive a car really.
- Zipper!

514
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:30,754
You took enough drugs
to take down an elephant.

515
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,390
I appreciate the comparison.
- I'm just saying,

516
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,192
you think you should be
operating heavy machinery?

517
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,427
It's a dodge neon.

518
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,162
It doesn't exactly qualify
as heavy machinery.

519
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:40,064
Anything that's got four wheels
and a motor like that,

520
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:41,632
that's heavy machinery.
You know what?

521
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:44,268
Could you just... fuck!

522
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,074
I am fine.
- I didn't say...

523
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:51,642
I am fine. I am fine.
- I didn't say anything.

524
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:54,144
You try hopping around
on one heel.

525
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,513
I just... i-i don't think
that that's why you fell.

526
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:59,083
"I-I-I-I-I."

527
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,217
Stupid idiot.

528
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:03,053
I don't... I don't know...
- Where's my bra?

529
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,756
Where is my bra?

530
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,364
I'm serious.

531
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:14,965
I can't let you leave.

532
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:18,535
Shut up.

533
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:20,671
It's been real, kev.

534
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:23,674
You're not going anywhere.

535
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:25,809
High-five?
- I'm serious.

536
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,011
And I'm leaving.

537
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:30,714
Get the... you are such a pussy.

538
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,856
Hold on.

539
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,364
I won't let you.

540
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,967
Kevin.

541
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:53,470
Please don't get obsessed.

542
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,673
It's just a one-night stand.

543
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,444
You know...

544
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,379
damn it, Kevin,
what's so bad if she licks you?

545
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,714
Hey!

546
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:05,683
I will call the cops.
Do you hear me?

547
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,084
Do whatever
you got to do, dude.

548
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:09,386
I am serious. Don't get
in the car. Please.

549
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,422
I'm begging you.
I was told to keep you here.

550
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:15,626
Really, I-I-I'm running out
of options here. Please.

551
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,761
Please, I am begging you, do not
put those keys in the ignition.

552
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,329
Please do not put those keys
in the ignition.

553
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:20,998
Don't start the car.
Don't start the car!

554
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,232
Please!
Don't put it in reverse!

555
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,701
I am begging you! Do not back

556
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,936
out of this driveway!
Dude, let go!

557
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,371
Please. I can help you.

558
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,605
Let go!
- I'm serious.

559
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:29,840
Please just get out of the car.

560
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:30,908
You asked for it.

561
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,342
Please, I am begging you.

562
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,244
Everything that...

563
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:35,713
oh!

564
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,681
You asked for it!

565
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,683
Oh!

566
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:43,353
Oh, my god! My eyes!

567
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:45,889
God damn it.

568
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,492
I've been nothing
but nice to you!

569
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:51,762
This entire time!

570
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:54,298
I said to let go.

571
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,900
Oh! Ah!

572
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,603
Just get up.
- Oh, god!

573
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:00,604
Just...

574
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:01,905
It feels bad.

575
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,575
It feels like it's really bad.
Come on.

576
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,777
I got to go, so let's just...
It burns so bad.

577
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,245
Okay, you got to stop hunching.

578
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,647
I don't want to get hit
in the midsection with a corner.

579
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:13,784
It was... okay.

580
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:16,520
All right. Just hold on.
Oh, my god.

581
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:19,723
Oh, god.

582
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,425
Oh, man, it burns so bad.

583
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,393
Well...

584
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,395
I'm gonna have to wear
two eye patches to work.

585
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,731
Nobody wears two eye patches.
Don't do that.

586
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,833
I think I caught my corneas
on the blades of grass.

587
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,835
Well, then why'd you
rub your eyes in it?

588
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,270
To get the burning...

589
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,438
I can't open...

590
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,973
did... did it work?
- I can't open my eyes.

591
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:38,175
It burns my... it burns my eyes.
Oh, no.

592
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,911
Oh, no. Let's do this.
Does it look bad?

593
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:44,615
Does it look really bad?

594
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:45,816
Does it look bad?

595
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,985
Because I have to...
- it...

596
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:50,487
does it look crazy?

597
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:53,157
Yes.

598
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,125
It doesn't look that bad.
It's okay.

599
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,262
What?

600
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:01,532
No, no, no. No.

601
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:02,766
Hey!
- Hey, what?

602
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:05,169
Hey!
- Ah!

603
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:09,807
Ah! Stop it. Give me the keys.

604
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,308
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.

605
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,877
Ow! Oh!
- Stepped on your foot.

606
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:18,549
I'm gonna put you in the sink
and wash you like a little baby.

607
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:22,386
Get ready.

608
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:25,756
Ahh!
Are you fucking kidding me?!

609
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,002
Fuck!

610
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:44,208
You asshole!

611
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,542
Where you driving? Wait.

612
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:48,612
Easy.

613
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,280
Ow!

614
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,149
Oh!

615
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:54,952
I wouldn't go in there.
- Fuck!

616
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:57,120
There's, like,
poison oak, coyotes,

617
00:30:57,122 --> 00:31:00,524
I heard there's a mountain lion,
like ticks and stuff.

618
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,994
Oh!

619
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:07,297
You want to...
you want to play scrabble?

620
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,935
Nerd.

621
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,608
I don't care. I don't care.

622
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,020
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

623
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:33,056
Hey. Are you crazy?
Are you insane?

624
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,159
I'm not driving,
so why the fuck not?

625
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,295
Okay, okay, no, no, no, no.
You won't let me drink.

626
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,430
You won't let me drive.
You won't let me sleep.

627
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,799
You're getting a little
too controlling, kev.

628
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,434
I don't like that in a guy,
okay?

629
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,637
I just don't think
you should be drinking whiskey

630
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:47,971
after downing all those pills.

631
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,439
And I just don't think
I want to spend

632
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:50,540
another second with you.

633
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:51,975
Well, I'm sorry about that,
but...

634
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:53,143
is this Peter?
- What?

635
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,811
This is Peter. This is Peter.

636
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,546
What are you talking about?
- Peter put you up to this.

637
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,148
That's crazy.
- Peter wanted you to babysit me,

638
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,917
keep me here
so I don't do anything crazy.

639
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:00,918
I think you're a little bit...

640
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,486
aah!

641
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,021
I don't think
that you should be...

642
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:05,222
god, that guy is so good!

643
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,623
He manipulated a little baby boy

644
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,692
like you to take care
of the crazy Madeline!

645
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:11,762
Volatile Madeline!
Just don't want you to die.

646
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,163
Oh, you care about me now?

647
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,831
It's not caring or not.
- You care about me now?

648
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,066
You have no ulterior motive

649
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,334
to keep me here?
Get out of my way.

650
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,735
What ulterior motive
would I have?

651
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:19,903
Why do you keep hitting me?!

652
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,505
You know
what I'm talking about.

653
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,240
No, I don't!
- I could do a lot of damage

654
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,708
to will if I wanted to.

655
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,243
Oh, you could do damage?

656
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,111
Yes, I could.
- Who's gonna listen to you?

657
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,646
Um, for your information,
I have a friend

658
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:31,982
at the<i> herald</i> who would be happy
to take my call.

659
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:34,217
Do not laugh at me.

660
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:37,688
I want you to know that will
is beloved at the <i>herald.</i>

661
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,589
Oh, you are so condescending.
- And if there was ever

662
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,325
a question of your word
versus his...

663
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,527
Oh, you are so condescending.
- ... I would be shocked

664
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:47,230
if anyone would even entertain
your side of the story.

665
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:49,399
What is that? That's his dick.

666
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:50,467
Oh, man.

667
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,536
Oh!

668
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,271
There's no way
to prove that that's will.

669
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:58,308
That could be anybody.
Are you kidding?

670
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,178
Okay, yeah, in full body
it's will, but...

671
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,846
oh, man, is he flexing?

672
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,614
He's so buff.

673
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,116
This was around Christmas.

674
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:08,251
Oh, god, I'm never gonna
be able to unsee that.

675
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,655
He is gonna look so good
on sportscenter.

676
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:14,257
Hey! Hey! Oh!

677
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,560
Doesn't matter. They're
all saved to cloud, bitch.

678
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:19,296
Idiot. That is the last time you
grab something out of my hand!

679
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:21,031
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna destroy a man's

680
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:23,066
life before the biggest game
of his career?

681
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,468
I'm sorry.

682
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,936
What?

683
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:27,338
I know he's your boss
and everything

684
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,773
and you think
he's like super-cool, the man,

685
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:30,941
but he did this to himself.

686
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,442
He is more than just my boss.

687
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:35,045
I have bled silver and blue
since I was a little kid,

688
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,014
and do you have any idea
what it would mean

689
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:40,584
to bring a national championship
to this school, to this town?

690
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,652
He completely fucks over
his whole family

691
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,955
and the only thing you can think
about is this stupid game?

692
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:46,656
This is will's personal life.

693
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:49,059
You picked a pretty convenient
time to air some dirty laundry.

694
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,927
No, no, no.
I didn't have some grand scheme.

695
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,430
I was walking into the ocean
with a pocketful of rocks

696
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,198
and then your dumb ass
came along,

697
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,900
so if you're gonna make me live
this shitty life,

698
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:58,168
then he's gonna do it, too!

699
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,703
That's a nice way
to live your life.

700
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,039
I hope the universe gives back
what you put into it.

701
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,673
I didn't plan this.
I didn't want this.

702
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,609
Mm-hmm.
- All I wanted to do was to go

703
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:08,011
to the banquet and talk to will.
Yeah.

704
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:11,181
But Peter intercepted me
and he wouldn't let me do that.

705
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:14,551
What would you have
said to him?

706
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,820
Hmm?

707
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,955
I mean, so what?

708
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,524
You banged once.

709
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,059
He sent you a couple dick pics.

710
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:25,529
That's what middle-aged guys do.

711
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,068
Wasn't only once.

712
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,502
I know you think I'm this floozy

713
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,571
that he just took home
for a one-night stand,

714
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,607
but you could not be further
from the truth.

715
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:42,079
I don't think you're a floozy,
mostly because it's not 1923.

716
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,447
Oh, god.

717
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,117
And I know that I have no right
to know this.

718
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,485
I don't even know
why I'm asking.

719
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,320
But...

720
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:53,190
How long did it go on?

721
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:59,596
Three... three... three weeks?

722
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,731
No.

723
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,366
Three months?

724
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:05,068
No.

725
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,170
God. Three years?

726
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,139
Such a long time.

727
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:11,341
Yes, it is.

728
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:12,676
But he ended it, I guess.

729
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:15,946
There's... he knew
that what he had done,

730
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,114
it was wrong.

731
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,883
Yeah, he ended it
by text message.

732
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:21,184
Oh, my god.

733
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,554
It was a classy, classy move.

734
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:28,291
I'm sorry.
I've gotten one of those once.

735
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,360
It's no fun.

736
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,962
What'd it say?

737
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,764
It said, "Kevin, I think
we should see other people."

738
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,032
Frownie face."

739
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,902
Oh.

740
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:41,104
That sucks.

741
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:43,773
Such a fucking idiot.

742
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,380
I mean, the man preaches
integrity and accountability.

743
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:54,518
And what? He's just...
he's just a fucking horndog.

744
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,319
Well, that's not fair.

745
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,321
That's not accurate.

746
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,557
We had more than just sex.

747
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,160
It was more than just sex?
- Yeah.

748
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,662
Well, that makes me feel
a lot better.

749
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,130
49-year-old man,

750
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:10,800
girl who looks like you... sure
you got the world to talk about.

751
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:14,838
Wow, you are exactly
like everyone in this town!

752
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,474
Everyone has the same attitude
about will.

753
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:20,510
Will Campbell, coach.
That's it.

754
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,914
He's more than coach Campbell
to me. He's my mentor.

755
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:25,949
He's your mentor?

756
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:27,751
I don't want to make you sad,

757
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:30,887
but he's your mentor and you've
never even been in his house.

758
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,623
You didn't even know
this was his house.

759
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,525
He didn't invite you
to any of his cookouts?

760
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,161
I am one of three
video assistants, okay?

761
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:41,031
It takes a lot to cultivate
that kind of relationship.

762
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,466
But I know I do a good job
and I know that he has noticed,

763
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,368
and we have talked
multiple times.

764
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,037
Buddy, buddy, buddy,
okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

765
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,106
Wait, wait, wait, hey.

766
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:52,475
I completely get it.

767
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:55,879
I know exactly the job
he does on people.

768
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,381
Let me guess.
He looked you in the eye.

769
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:02,552
He remembered your name,
little, like, details about you,

770
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:08,592
he shook your hand.
He made you feel special, right?

771
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:13,196
It is sick,
but he is so good at that.

772
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:17,267
Well, if he's so full of shit,
how come you liked him?

773
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,202
Because he didn't do that
to me.

774
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:20,537
Okay.
- He didn't.

775
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,439
He never wore that mask
around me.

776
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:24,441
I'm sure you saw
the real will Campbell.

777
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:25,809
Actually, yes, I did.

778
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:27,644
You know he's been
married for 20 years.

779
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,813
And they've been on auto pilot
for at least half of that.

780
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:32,582
If Sarah knew, this whole thing
would be just...

781
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,285
She hasn't been
complaining so far.

782
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:36,953
Sarah knows?

783
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,855
With will's last contract
extension,

784
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:43,126
it pays to turn a blind eye,
doesn't it?

785
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:47,397
My chest feels really tight.

786
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:51,901
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

787
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,236
No, it's your left arm.

788
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,005
Yeah, yeah,
that's the one that hurts.

789
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:57,040
All right, you want a drink?

790
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:58,308
I've had too much to drink.

791
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,576
Because I could really
use a drink.

792
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:00,810
I think I need
like a baby aspirin.

793
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,012
They say that...
We're having drinks.

794
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:04,514
I'm gonna get us some.

795
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:19,062
Good god.

796
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:21,131
Will's wine is spectacular.

797
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:24,100
Mmhmm.

798
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,102
You okay?

799
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:31,308
You're not supposed
to be drinking that much.

800
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,576
Let's smoke weed.
- No.

801
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:35,745
You want to smoke weed?
- No!

802
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:36,946
Yeah.

803
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,716
No!

804
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:41,318
Can we please get out of here?

805
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,521
She's 16. She's got weed.
That's a law.

806
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:46,823
This is creeping me out.

807
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,992
Ooh.

808
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:52,095
Ooh, what?

809
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:53,196
It's a little guitar.

810
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,364
I think it's a violin.

811
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:57,467
I know it's a violin. My god.

812
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,135
Please don't.
What are you gonna do with that?

813
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:04,974
I'm gonna roll it up and I'm
gonna smoke it like a doobie.

814
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,617
You want to see something cool?

815
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,289
Super weird.

816
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,057
Oh, my god. Sorry.

817
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,826
Can we get out of this room
now, please?

818
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,260
Ooh, darts!

819
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,663
You know, for someone who took
a whole shit-ton of Xanax,

820
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,064
you're bouncing off the walls.

821
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,300
You see this?
That's some harsh shit.

822
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:32,035
What do you think
that bitch did?

823
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,503
Who cares? Let's go.

824
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,105
What do you mean, who cares?
- I mean who cares.

825
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:36,439
Stop... ow!

826
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:39,776
Who hands darts
with the needles... ow!

827
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:42,412
Fuck! Shit!

828
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,414
You're out of
your fucking mind!

829
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:47,884
I'm just a little tired.

830
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,288
Come on. Let's get
out of this room, please.

831
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,057
No, let's play.
- I don't want to play.

832
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,726
Why?
You afraid I'm gonna beat you?

833
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,561
Okay, we'll play one game.
- Oh, okay.

834
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,597
This sock will be the line.

835
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,966
I'm gonna play
standard scoring rules, okay?

836
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,434
Oh, my god.
- We'll just go by the bars.

837
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:05,535
Why are you so serious
all of a sudden?

838
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:06,836
Why can't we just play

839
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,204
whoever hits
the bull's-eye first wins?

840
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:10,273
Because we'll be here all night
if we do that.

841
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:11,908
You'll be here all night.

842
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,711
I won't.

843
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:16,780
Dang. Good shot.

844
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:20,316
Thanks.

845
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:21,985
Shit!

846
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:24,220
T-t-t-the board is clearly
not flush to the wall,

847
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:26,289
making it very difficult
to catch a good angle.

848
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,657
Okay, it's not regulation?

849
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:28,691
It's not. It's bullshit.

850
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,527
Okay.
- It's not fair.

851
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:34,030
Is this why the whole team
left you behind?

852
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:37,767
What's that supposed to mean?
- I mean, they're all in L.A.

853
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,369
The big game is four days away

854
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:42,138
and you're here playing darts
with me.

855
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,207
I don't have to physically
be with the team

856
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:45,975
to show my worth or contribute.

857
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,445
Thank you, though.

858
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:51,181
What do you do then?

859
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:53,583
I go through hours of high
school players' video footage

860
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,285
and then I take notes...
You jerk off on it?

861
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,621
And I give the notes about the
exceptional players to Peter.

862
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,957
Hmm.
- Fuck!

863
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,158
Man!

864
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,528
I've never... I've never shot
this poorly.

865
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,797
Boom! She's gonna feel that
in the morning,

866
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,499
that Chelsea.
- Who's Chelsea?

867
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,935
I named her Chelsea because
there's this really mean cunt

868
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:14,037
that I went to high school with,
and she looks just like her.

869
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,106
I never had any drama
in high school.

870
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,775
You mean you never got laid
in high school?

871
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:21,377
I mean I was a heavier...
i was...

872
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:23,513
I weighed a lot more, so...

873
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:26,516
How heavy can you get?

874
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:29,252
Are you done?

875
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:31,521
Can can I... yeah, I'm done.

876
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:34,524
Just take a shot.

877
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,125
Aah! Aah!
- That's bullshit.

878
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,360
You were over the line.

879
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:38,695
I'm sorry. You're way over.

880
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:40,263
No, I wasn't.
- Look where your feet are.

881
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:41,898
I was going by that one.
- Why would you go that by sock?

882
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,800
That sock's three feet closer,
and we were...

883
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:46,169
you said the sock.
You said stand behind the sock.

884
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,671
You didn't specify which... hey!

885
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,407
You just can't handle
that I beat you.

886
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,542
I can handle that you beat me

887
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:54,043
if you can handle
that you cheated.

888
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:55,578
I okay, fine.

889
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,779
Whatever helps you sleep
at night, but I won.

890
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:57,947
I'll sleep fine at night

891
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,949
knowing that I won
fair and square,

892
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,451
because that's how we do it
at Allen state.

893
00:42:01,453 --> 00:42:02,952
Oh, my god.

894
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:05,788
Don't tell me
you actually believe

895
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,390
in all of will's bullshit.

896
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:08,858
Yeah, I actually do.

897
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,094
I wouldn't have
gone into coaching if I didn't.

898
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:12,862
That's how you got
into coaching?

899
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,130
I thought it was
because you couldn't play.

900
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:17,133
I could have played.
- What? Kicker?

901
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:18,801
I don't think
they let fatties kick the ball.

902
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,169
Are you just gonna give
me shit all night,

903
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,704
or do you want
me to answer your question?

904
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,907
Can we do both?

905
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:26,142
All right. Answer my question.

906
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:27,443
Well, if you must know,

907
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:29,379
I was actually in the stadium
during the mud bowl.

908
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:31,180
I don't know what that is,
but it sounds gross.

909
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:32,382
You don't know
what the mud bowl is?

910
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,616
No, I don't like football.

911
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:34,918
I told you.
I think it's barbaric.

912
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,352
What do you and will
talk about?

913
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,588
History, politics.

914
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,822
We covered a lot.

915
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,491
And you never went over
the mud bowl?

916
00:42:41,493 --> 00:42:44,827
No. God.
Mud bowl, mud bowl, mud bowl.

917
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,663
You obviously want to tell me
about the mud bowl.

918
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:49,866
No, I don't want to tell you
if you're gonna be like that.

919
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:52,735
Will you please tell me
about the mud bowl?

920
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,771
It was awesome.

921
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:57,307
I was 14 years old.

922
00:42:57,309 --> 00:43:00,009
My dad took me to the game.
My first time in the stadium.

923
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,811
It's will's first year
as the head coach,

924
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:03,079
and it is pouring rain.

925
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,814
And at this time,
we're like a cupcake game

926
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:06,316
on major program schedules.

927
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:08,217
You know what I mean?
Just so they can get a "w",

928
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,485
keep they're ranking high.

929
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:12,589
Notre dame comes in ranked
number one in the nation.

930
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:15,892
We go toe-to-toe with them
the entire game.

931
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,761
Fourth quarter, we're down
by a touchdown, a minute left.

932
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,430
We're on our own 4 yard line.

933
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:21,764
We have to drive
the entire field.

934
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,366
We have no time-outs.

935
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:25,234
How do we do it? Methodically.

936
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:26,936
They're in a dime package,
and will knows that.

937
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,605
There's no need
to try to go over the top.

938
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:32,442
So everything's a quick drop,
short outs, crossing patterns.

939
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,977
If you catch the ball
within the hash marks,

940
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:35,511
you got to get out of bounds
right away.

941
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:36,946
We score.

942
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,282
A normal coach...
just kick the extra point,

943
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,650
we'll deal with it in overtime,
right?

944
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:42,018
We have the momentum. Not will.

945
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,721
Will calls an end-around
to Marcus Freeman,

946
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:46,623
who everybody knows
is gonna get the ball

947
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:47,991
and try to run it
to the end zone.

948
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:50,593
They've got 10 in the box
stacked against him.

949
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:51,828
What does Marcus do?

950
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,396
He throws across his body

951
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:56,933
to a wide-open receiver
in the corner of the end zone.

952
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,735
Two-point conversion good.

953
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:04,374
The greatest football call in
the history of football calls.

954
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:05,541
Wow.

955
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:07,677
Yeah.

956
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,946
So, did they win?
- Yeah, we won!

957
00:44:09,948 --> 00:44:11,948
That was the game
that put Allen state on the map.

958
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,316
So, what? You got obsessed

959
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,585
with like a bunch
of 20-year-old neanderthals?

960
00:44:15,587 --> 00:44:17,620
Live vicariously through them?
I know it sounds crazy,

961
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:21,057
but this is really important
to a lot of people, to me.

962
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:23,559
If we lose,
I get depressed for like a week.

963
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,428
That's what makes you sad?

964
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,763
A football game?

965
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,097
Will has done a lot
for this community.

966
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,532
He's done a lot for the school.

967
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:31,801
He has created jobs.
He has helped the economy.

968
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:33,403
He built
the youth builders program.

969
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:36,172
You can say that about
literally every single coach.

970
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,107
All he did was win a few games.
It's not just that.

971
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:40,243
Like, my... my dad and I,
we didn't talk very much,

972
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:42,078
but every Saturday
we were able to order pizza,

973
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,280
sit on the couch,
and be in each other's presence

974
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:46,149
while we watched the game.
Oh, my god. Wait.

975
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:48,418
Two men eating pizza,
watching football?

976
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,787
Everybody does that.
Will didn't create that.

977
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:52,855
Don't idolize him.
He's just a guy.

978
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,158
And to you, he's just a guy?

979
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,726
Yeah.

980
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:59,228
So, it wasn't the power?

981
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,330
The power?

982
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:03,399
No.

983
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:06,369
You don't know
what you're talking about.

984
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:10,907
So, please, enlighten me.

985
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,010
Enlighten me.

986
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:16,512
Mnh-mnh.
- Come on.

987
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:20,416
Mnhmnh.

988
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:22,685
Well, I didn't even know
who he was when we met.

989
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:24,687
Really?

990
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:25,922
Really.

991
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:27,690
You didn't know
who will Campbell was?

992
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:29,625
No.
I'd only lived here for a year.

993
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:32,328
And I already told you I don't
give a rat's ass about football.

994
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,497
Okay.
- He used to come into my bar

995
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:38,534
after work every day and sneak
into a booth in the back,

996
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:43,706
order a Sam Adams and work
on his fantasy novel,

997
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,141
and I think that's really...

998
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:47,777
I'm sorry.

999
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:49,779
Did you say fantasy novel?

1000
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:51,180
Yes, I did.

1001
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:54,383
With like wizards,
like elves and fairies?

1002
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:57,120
There were no fairies, okay?
- Like minotaurs?

1003
00:45:57,122 --> 00:45:57,987
No.

1004
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,655
Like half-man, half-tigers?

1005
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:01,257
See, this attitude right here,

1006
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,392
this is why
he never told anyone...

1007
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:05,394
because of annoying stuff
like this.

1008
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:06,829
What was it called?

1009
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:08,331
There's no way
I'm telling you that.

1010
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:09,866
Why?
- Because you're gonna make fun

1011
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,267
of it, and then
I'm gonna get mad,

1012
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,769
and then I'm gonna punch you,
and I'm tired.

1013
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:14,270
I don't want to do that
right now.

1014
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,105
Fine. I won't make fun of it.
I won't laugh at it.

1015
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,975
I won't even...
i won't make a peep.

1016
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:22,211
Just tell me the title.

1017
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:24,147
"The keepers of Galnorea."

1018
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:26,816
You kidding me?

1019
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:28,117
What was it about?

1020
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,353
Wizards who get gonorrhea?

1021
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:32,221
It's a bad title.
I asked him to change it.

1022
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:34,223
He didn't want to change it.

1023
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:41,297
So, how do you go from talking
about dragons with stds to...

1024
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:44,867
What?
- To being...

1025
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:47,036
to being in... inti...

1026
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:48,571
to, like, having whatever...

1027
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:50,640
to having sex?

1028
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,775
Yes.

1029
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,977
He gave me a ride home
one night.

1030
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,079
And he invited himself up.

1031
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:58,848
He said we didn't have to have
sex because he was married

1032
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,717
and whatever,
but I knew what that meant,

1033
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:04,654
so I fucked his brains out
anyway.

1034
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:07,089
Well, I guess everyone
got what they wanted.

1035
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:09,258
Oh, god, you're so judgmental.
- I'm not judging.

1036
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,260
You know,
I dated a lot of mean guys,

1037
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:15,598
and he's the only one who didn't
actively make me hate myself.

1038
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,300
Yeah.

1039
00:47:17,302 --> 00:47:22,839
He just made you want
to kill yourself.

1040
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:24,207
I'm sorry.
- Goodbye.

1041
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:27,844
No. That was not cool.

1042
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,447
I didn't mean it.

1043
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,683
It's fine.
- No, it's not fine.

1044
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,618
No, really, it's fine.

1045
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,086
I didn't even get that right.

1046
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:39,689
I fucked up at fucking up.

1047
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,791
That's good.
- No.

1048
00:47:41,793 --> 00:47:44,293
That's good.

1049
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:47,730
I am positive that if you
get another shot at it,

1050
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:51,067
you're gonna nail it.

1051
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:53,269
Just dead on impact.

1052
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:54,971
I'm assuming you jump
from something.

1053
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:56,839
That's very mean.

1054
00:47:56,841 --> 00:47:59,809
Seriously,
I believe in you in that.

1055
00:47:59,811 --> 00:48:02,044
Thank you.

1056
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,779
Did you really want to do it?

1057
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,648
For real?

1058
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:08,317
That was the plan. For real.

1059
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:12,588
I bought those pills
off some sketchy dude downtown.

1060
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,458
Mort Stevens.
- Yeah, I don't think he was mort.

1061
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,526
How do you know? Could have
been... anybody could be a mort.

1062
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:20,563
That's racist.

1063
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,331
Touch.

1064
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:26,469
Anyway, I had those pills,
and I kept chickening out,

1065
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:31,173
so I decided that I would come
to the banquet.

1066
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:32,675
I knew tonight
was the last night

1067
00:48:32,677 --> 00:48:35,344
that I'd be able to talk to will
before he goes to L.A.

1068
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:39,916
So I snuck in there and I guess
I was hoping

1069
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:45,588
he was gonna talk me out of it,
but that didn't really happen.

1070
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:49,492
And then you picked me up
at the bar?

1071
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:50,893
No.

1072
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:53,229
Well, I wasn't hitting on you.
- Say that so casually,

1073
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:55,031
like it's the truth?
That's not the truth.

1074
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:56,899
Well, what is the truth?
- You hit on me.

1075
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:58,601
I did not do anything
like that.

1076
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,970
You complimented my bag.
You said, "hey, nice bag."

1077
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:04,407
Well, it was nice,
and I was being nice.

1078
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:06,742
You wanted to get
into my pants.

1079
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:08,711
You were wearing a dress.

1080
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:10,713
Come on.

1081
00:49:10,715 --> 00:49:13,649
Fine. I was hitting on you.

1082
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:15,685
But you were the one that said
you wanted to take me home.

1083
00:49:15,687 --> 00:49:18,688
Well, yeah, once I realized
who you worked for,

1084
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,122
I thought it'd be
an extra little "fuck you"

1085
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:24,393
to bang you in will's bed.

1086
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:26,595
Thank you.

1087
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:28,631
Sorry.
- No.

1088
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,266
It's fine.

1089
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:33,235
I'm a terrible person.

1090
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,806
And now the one solid thing
in my life

1091
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:39,542
has completely abandoned me.

1092
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:43,245
Will was the one solid thing
in your life?

1093
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:46,816
You know he was gonna
leave Sarah.

1094
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:47,917
Oh.

1095
00:49:47,919 --> 00:49:49,785
Yeah. I'm that girl.

1096
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:54,156
I'm that girl.

1097
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:57,760
Hey, he seduced both of us.

1098
00:49:57,762 --> 00:49:59,295
Yeah.

1099
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:02,765
Except I only
let him fuck me once.

1100
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:06,268
Twice if you count the one time
I let him finish in my mouth.

1101
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,737
Oh!

1102
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:09,105
I had to. He was my boss.

1103
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,709
Yeah.

1104
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:16,979
It was a wise business decision.

1105
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:18,314
You still sleepy?

1106
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:21,784
I'm the most sleepiest
of all times.

1107
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:23,953
Let's go outside.
- No.

1108
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:25,321
Come on.
Let's get some fresh air.

1109
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:26,689
There is airs in here.

1110
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,324
You can have
one of your cigarettes.

1111
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:29,959
By the way, you should switch
to e-cigarettes.

1112
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:31,627
I've read a bunch of articles
that say it's better for you

1113
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,162
and it looks cool.
Will you forward them to me?

1114
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:34,330
Thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

1115
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:35,531
Come on. Let's go outside.

1116
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,334
No.

1117
00:50:38,336 --> 00:50:40,936
Come on.

1118
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:42,571
Okay.

1119
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:44,006
Let's go.
- You got it, buster.

1120
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:45,374
I won't even drag you.

1121
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,909
Thank you,
'cause you hurt me last time.

1122
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,943
I know. I'm sorry about that.

1123
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:49,345
I felt it... I felt it...

1124
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:52,581
you've been
throwing me around all night.

1125
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,753
Why don't we go
in the pool, huh?

1126
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:00,356
Fuck no.
It's freezing. Are you crazy?

1127
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:02,158
What do you mean?
These conditions are perfect.

1128
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,628
Yeah, looks positively balmy.

1129
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,497
Ideal.

1130
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:11,000
It's too cold.
- I love going in bodies of water

1131
00:51:11,002 --> 00:51:14,336
when you can see
your own breath.

1132
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:15,704
Do you?

1133
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:18,774
Oh, yeah.

1134
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:21,944
So, what... what...
you're a bartender, right?

1135
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:23,712
Yep.

1136
00:51:23,714 --> 00:51:25,414
What's the five-year plan
there?

1137
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,716
Oh, my god. What are you?
My guidance counselor?

1138
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,819
No, I just want to know.

1139
00:51:29,821 --> 00:51:32,221
I don't have a plan.

1140
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,689
I was never very good
at planning.

1141
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:34,890
What are you good at?

1142
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:38,794
I don't know, man. Blowjobs.

1143
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:42,131
Yeah, you're good at those.

1144
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:46,402
I rest my case.

1145
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,137
You play a nice violin.

1146
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:50,673
I gave that up in the ninth
grade along with debate club

1147
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:51,674
and my virginity.

1148
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:52,908
You write really nicely.

1149
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,410
How would you know that?

1150
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:56,579
That suicide note
really flowed.

1151
00:51:56,581 --> 00:52:00,149
It was mostly bumper
sticker wisdom, you know.

1152
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:02,485
I have a gift.

1153
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:06,422
What about you?
What's your plan?

1154
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:09,191
Well, I hope to get
a graduate assistant position

1155
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:10,626
in a few years,
then maybe move up

1156
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,428
to an assistant coach
on will's staff.

1157
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,830
Then after that hopefully parlay
it into a head coaching gig

1158
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:19,034
somewhere at a small school
that I can make some noise,

1159
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:20,269
just like will did.

1160
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:24,340
Like will,
like will, like will.

1161
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:25,608
If you're not careful,
you're gonna waste

1162
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,209
your whole life
on that stupid game.

1163
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:29,211
It's not stupid.

1164
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:31,180
Hundreds of players
will tell you

1165
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:33,449
that will is like
a father to them.

1166
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:35,217
That means something.

1167
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:40,990
I'm good at cooking.

1168
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:42,424
That's cool.

1169
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:43,859
Don't patronize me.

1170
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:46,228
No, I think that's awesome.
You should like...

1171
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,463
don't say it.
- What?

1172
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:49,732
"You should open up
a restaurant."

1173
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:50,966
That's you.

1174
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:52,635
Spoton impression of me.

1175
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:54,203
Right?

1176
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:57,339
You're good at impressions.

1177
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,642
So what's your specialty?
Jack Nicholson.

1178
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:03,612
I meant what's your,
like, recipe?

1179
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:04,914
Are we still talking
about this?

1180
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:07,349
I'm interested.
- What is<i> your</i> specialty?

1181
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:10,219
Chinese takeout.
I crush it every time.

1182
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:11,353
Good one.
- Come on.

1183
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:12,421
I'm serious. I want to know.

1184
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:13,622
I watch a lot of cooking shows.

1185
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:16,358
I don't have, like,
a specialty.

1186
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,360
I don't make one thing,
you know.

1187
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,429
I just... I can whip up a meal

1188
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:22,231
with anything
you have in your cupboards.

1189
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:23,599
That's my jam.

1190
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:26,802
So you're like a food genie.

1191
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:29,271
No, but just something

1192
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:30,906
me and my friends
do every once in awhile.

1193
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:32,942
Like I'll make the food and
they'll bring the booze 'cause

1194
00:53:32,944 --> 00:53:35,344
we're all broke as fuck.

1195
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:37,479
I don't see my friends
that much.

1196
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:38,948
By the time I get off campus,

1197
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:41,884
they're either home in their own
bed or wasted drunk,

1198
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:44,720
and it's like I have
to take care of them.

1199
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:47,389
Sounds lonely.

1200
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,858
Hmm. Keeps me focused.

1201
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,460
Wow.

1202
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:54,797
You sound exactly like will.

1203
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:57,733
Well, will always said the key
to success

1204
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,702
is preparation and persistence.

1205
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:01,870
Yeah, I know.

1206
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:07,943
I've seen the fucking t-shirts
and the koozies.

1207
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:09,078
All right.

1208
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,346
I'm cold.

1209
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:13,249
Let's go inside.

1210
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:16,318
Okay.

1211
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,020
Can you help me up?

1212
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:19,688
All right.

1213
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,925
You mother...

1214
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:24,927
oh! Oh! Oh!

1215
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:27,263
I'm sorry! I didn't think
it would be this cold!

1216
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:29,465
What a dumb mistake!
I'm so sorry!

1217
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:31,667
I'm so sorry!
- Oh! Oh, my god!

1218
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:33,168
Are you okay?!
- Oh, my god!

1219
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,104
I'm so sorry!
- Oh, my...

1220
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:39,708
you fucker.

1221
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:45,681
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1222
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:52,688
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1223
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,356
You're sorry?
- I'm sorry. It's just...

1224
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:56,725
I didn't... I didn't know
how to keep you awake.

1225
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:58,594
Want to keep me awake,
just say "hey!"

1226
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:01,096
Just say "hey"? I-I-I-I...

1227
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:02,698
I don't know
if that's like the strongest...

1228
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,732
just say "hey!"

1229
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:06,969
Can you hand me a towel,
please?

1230
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:15,744
Got a pool in the winter,
you want to heat it, you know?

1231
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:22,084
Why are you breathing so loud?

1232
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:25,821
I'm not good at being cold.

1233
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:28,590
Come here.

1234
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:36,098
Come on. Open your towel.
We need body heat.

1235
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,867
Okay. Yeah.

1236
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,871
Okay.

1237
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:02,291
Why are you hard?

1238
00:56:02,293 --> 00:56:03,459
I'm

1239
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:06,295
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1240
00:56:06,297 --> 00:56:09,131
No, no.

1241
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:10,733
No.

1242
00:56:10,735 --> 00:56:13,569
Tough moment to read, you know?

1243
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:15,838
Don't follow me with it.

1244
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:53,275
What are you doing?

1245
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:55,477
I'm just whipping something up.

1246
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:57,746
I'm hungry.

1247
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,715
Yeah?

1248
00:56:59,717 --> 00:57:03,152
What are you making
with milk and sriracha sauce?

1249
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:04,353
Don't sound so disgusted.

1250
00:57:04,355 --> 00:57:06,655
This is a thing that I make.
God.

1251
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:08,056
Okay,
you're making a lot of it.

1252
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:10,859
Well, I'm making enough
for when Peter gets here.

1253
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:13,695
How do you know
Peter's showing up?

1254
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:15,264
Okay, he just wants to
talk to you.

1255
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:18,667
Yeah, just a sweet, little
convo between two friends.

1256
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:20,068
What? Do you think
he's gonna threaten you?

1257
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,004
I am sure they're going
to intimidate me, yeah.

1258
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:24,440
They'll try, at least.
You can handle that, right?

1259
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:25,874
You're tough.

1260
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:29,077
Okay. Listen.
This is how it's gonna go down.

1261
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:30,813
Peter's gonna show up
with a blank check

1262
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:33,982
to find out how much
it costs to keep my mouth shut.

1263
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:35,350
Yeah right.

1264
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:36,385
Just wait and see.

1265
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:39,121
You'll... okay.

1266
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:41,857
Sounds crazy.

1267
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:43,025
Hey, hey!

1268
00:57:43,027 --> 00:57:44,159
Oh!
- Sorry.

1269
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:45,661
These are for the dish.

1270
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:50,065
I need that back,
actually, so can I have that?

1271
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:52,768
How much would it cost?
- How much would it cost to what?

1272
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:58,440
How much would it cost
for you not to say anything?

1273
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:02,811
Well, I've never had more than
$1.000 in my bank account,

1274
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,680
so most days
you can get me pretty cheap.

1275
00:58:04,682 --> 00:58:07,015
But not today.
- No.

1276
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:09,618
Not today.

1277
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:12,788
Hell hath no fury
and the scorn of the woman.

1278
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,756
Scorn of women.
I think... yeah,

1279
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:16,592
that's how that goes.
You know what I mean.

1280
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:18,527
Let's just play this out
for a second, okay?

1281
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:19,828
You go to the press.

1282
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,497
They rake will over the coals.

1283
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:22,931
They crucify him.

1284
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:25,601
His wife does the whole
"stand by your man" thing

1285
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:27,269
then will goes back to coaching.

1286
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:29,238
He wins a couple big games.

1287
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,073
The press looks at it
like a redemption story.

1288
00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:32,708
And then where does that
leave you?

1289
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,943
Bahamas.
- You become a trashy girl

1290
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:36,678
that tried
to break up his marriage.

1291
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,281
Yeah, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

1292
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,553
I mean...

1293
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:46,889
If it were<i> just</i> an affair.

1294
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:48,490
But...

1295
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:50,759
It's more than that.

1296
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:53,529
It's more than that.
- Huh?

1297
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:57,833
It's more than that. What?

1298
00:58:57,835 --> 00:59:01,370
I can't... I can't ruin
your perception of Saint will.

1299
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:03,672
You love him.

1300
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:05,073
I don't think this will ruin it

1301
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:08,977
after what I've been
through tonight.

1302
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:09,845
Okay.

1303
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:11,079
Remember when all the...
i can't.

1304
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:13,115
I can't do it.
- Just tell me.

1305
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:15,751
Remember when all those schools
were recruiting Kyle Walker?

1306
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:18,287
Yeah, of course.
Usc, ucla, 'bama,

1307
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:19,721
Texas, Nebraska, Arizona.
Yeah, shh, shh, shh.

1308
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:21,223
No one cares.

1309
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:23,358
Basically all those schools
were jizzing them self

1310
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,460
to get Kyle Walker.
- Yeah.

1311
00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:27,763
And then he went
to Allen state?

1312
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:29,498
He wanted to play for will.

1313
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,166
Have you seen those girls
at usc?

1314
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:35,003
I'm talking like...

1315
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:36,805
What is that?
- They're hot.

1316
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:38,173
Look, when you graduate
high school

1317
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,008
and you're serious
about college football,

1318
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,377
you know the value of being
coached by a living legend.

1319
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:44,613
Kevin, they paid him.

1320
00:59:44,615 --> 00:59:46,048
Bullshit.
- They paid him.

1321
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,849
That is bullshit.
- I'm telling you the truth.

1322
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:49,217
They paid him. I was there.

1323
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:51,019
I went on that trip
with will to Houston.

1324
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:54,990
He rolls up to Kyle Walker's
house in a brand-new range rover

1325
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:57,626
and then he takes a cab home?
So what?

1326
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:59,728
Doesn't mean anything.
- Okay.

1327
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,263
Well, the championship's
on Monday.

1328
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,532
What do you think will happen
if I leak

1329
01:00:03,534 --> 01:00:04,833
that little tidbit to the press?

1330
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:06,802
The ncaa would do
a thorough investigation

1331
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:11,740
and come up with nothing
because will does not cheat.

1332
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:13,308
At football.

1333
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,243
Well, if they looked into it,
they would find plenty.

1334
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:16,845
And then his whole staff...
and you...

1335
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:18,547
would be up shit's creek
without a paddle,

1336
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:20,449
and I don't think the community
would like that very much.

1337
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:23,785
Look, obviously I've heard
the rumors any time

1338
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,787
a five-star blue-chip recruit

1339
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:27,489
comes to a small school
like this.

1340
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:30,692
And with all the things
that will has done for Allen,

1341
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:32,194
there's gonna be chatter,
obviously.

1342
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:34,062
Hey, hey.
I'm telling you first-hand,

1343
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:37,466
as a first-hand account,
I'm the source.

1344
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:40,369
Will would never do that.

1345
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:42,437
Okay, come here. Come on.

1346
01:00:42,439 --> 01:00:43,972
We're going on a trip.

1347
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,775
Come on.

1348
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:54,182
Awesome.

1349
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:55,651
I know.

1350
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:59,054
Kind of overwhelming for such
a famously modest guy, right?

1351
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:02,491
Wow. This ball was signed
by all the captains

1352
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:07,329
of the '03 sugar bowl victory.

1353
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:10,332
Don't forget all of
these beautifully framed posters

1354
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:11,800
praising will's genius.

1355
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:14,302
He's a pretty good
football coach.

1356
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:15,737
He's only human.

1357
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:19,374
This is a narcissistic shrine
that he made

1358
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,543
and gave to himself.

1359
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:23,245
Nobody knows this guy.

1360
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:26,615
They all think
he's some modest family man.

1361
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:28,550
Don't you know him?

1362
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:30,352
Isn't he the real will with you?

1363
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:34,122
I don't think
anyone really knows anyone.

1364
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,694
Well, I mean, I don't think
that takes away

1365
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:40,062
from his coaching
accomplishments

1366
01:01:40,064 --> 01:01:42,264
or the fact
that he's changed the culture...

1367
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:46,134
he has created an unattainable
standard for living

1368
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:47,869
that you try to live up to,

1369
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:50,605
that he doesn't even
try to live up to.

1370
01:01:50,607 --> 01:01:52,941
Well...

1371
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:56,445
It doesn't seem so bad to try.

1372
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:59,748
I don't know what to tell you.

1373
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:29,377
Look, I'm just saying you don't
have to put so much pressure

1374
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:32,314
on yourself, you know?

1375
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:34,182
You could have a real life
outside this thing.

1376
01:02:34,184 --> 01:02:35,317
Will does.

1377
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:36,852
I'm perfectly happy
with my life, thank you.

1378
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:38,487
You told me
you never see your friends.

1379
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:40,222
And when was the last time
you even had a girlfriend?

1380
01:02:40,224 --> 01:02:42,190
That's none of your business.

1381
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:44,326
Well, we just had sex, so it's
kind of sort of my business.

1382
01:02:44,328 --> 01:02:46,294
It's really not.

1383
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:47,095
Oh, my god.

1384
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:48,663
Why are you getting touchy?

1385
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:49,698
I'm not getting touchy.

1386
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,433
Have we hit a nerve? Huh?

1387
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:54,169
Will you please stop
kicking me?

1388
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:56,605
Was tonight your first time?

1389
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:57,939
You have to tell me if it was.

1390
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,842
Did it feel like my first time?

1391
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:03,779
Don't answer that.

1392
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:07,315
Do you even go on dates?

1393
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:11,086
Are you on Okcupid?
Nerdlove. Com?

1394
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:12,320
This conversation is over.

1395
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:13,722
Well, we have to talk
about something.

1396
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:15,056
Is nerdlove. Com
even a real website?

1397
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:16,525
If we don't...
I'm falling asleep.

1398
01:03:16,527 --> 01:03:18,426
I'm gonna fall asleep
if you don't tell me.

1399
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:20,662
Fine. We will go through
my entire relationship history,

1400
01:03:20,664 --> 01:03:22,631
but that means that we have
to go through yours, as well.

1401
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:23,899
That's fine with me.

1402
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:27,669
I just don't think
you can handle it.

1403
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:30,772
Try me.

1404
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:37,179
He started openly hitting on
other girls in front of me.

1405
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:38,880
That's terrible. What'd you do?

1406
01:03:38,882 --> 01:03:39,981
Break up with him?

1407
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,384
Hell no.
- Why?

1408
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:45,086
Uh, because that's what
he wanted, obviously.

1409
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:46,755
He wasn't man enough
to break up with me himself,

1410
01:03:46,757 --> 01:03:50,859
so he passive aggressively tried
to get me to break up with him.

1411
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:52,360
So you just stuck it out?

1412
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:53,995
Yeah.

1413
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:56,298
I couldn't lose.

1414
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,532
That's good.

1415
01:03:57,534 --> 01:03:59,835
It always important
for a relationship to feel

1416
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,736
like there's a winner
and a loser.

1417
01:04:01,738 --> 01:04:03,972
Well, technically, I won 'cause

1418
01:04:03,974 --> 01:04:05,640
I got to stay
six months rent-free

1419
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:07,509
in a dope-ass apartment.

1420
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:10,078
Doesn't seem worth it to me.
- Washer/dryer in unit.

1421
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,379
You know what?
Forget I said anything.

1422
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:12,881
You should have
stayed there forever.

1423
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:14,149
No.

1424
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:15,550
Even if you were being abused.

1425
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:17,786
I would have said stick it out.

1426
01:04:17,788 --> 01:04:21,022
Do that laundry
at your leisure.

1427
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:24,559
Yeah. Worth it.

1428
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:27,062
Now, this is Steve
we're talking about, right?

1429
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:29,030
No, no, no, no.
Steve was the ankle fetish.

1430
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,765
Steve was the ankle fetish.
- Weirdo.

1431
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:32,033
No, this is...
- Brian?

1432
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,134
Brent.
- Brent.

1433
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:34,502
Sorry.
- Sorry.

1434
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:36,204
No, it's okay.
It's a lot to keep track of.

1435
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:38,773
What are you implying?

1436
01:04:38,775 --> 01:04:40,041
Nothing.

1437
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,276
You're trying to say
I'm a whore.

1438
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:42,777
No, I am not.
- Yes, you are.

1439
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:44,346
I would never... no.
- It's fine.

1440
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:45,647
I kinda am.

1441
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:48,083
No, you're not.

1442
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:49,818
You're being really hard
on yourself.

1443
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:52,020
I'm not being hard on myself.

1444
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:55,590
It's the men
who have been hard on me.

1445
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:57,025
In you.

1446
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:58,260
In me, on me.
- Okay.

1447
01:04:58,262 --> 01:04:59,394
Play me like a drum.
- Stop it.

1448
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,862
You don't want to go on? Okay.

1449
01:05:00,864 --> 01:05:02,063
Play you like a drum?

1450
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:03,665
With their dicks.
- Yeah, I got it.

1451
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:05,066
Yeah.

1452
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,735
I don't like...
i don't want to think about it.

1453
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:09,104
Sorry.

1454
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:12,440
What's... you know,
how many dudes we talking?

1455
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:14,709
I don't have a number
off the top of my head.

1456
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:16,278
There's no final tally?

1457
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,614
I don't tally them every day.
I'm not in jail like...

1458
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:22,183
What's your number?
I'll give you mine.

1459
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:23,818
I got to think about it.

1460
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,353
Well, me too.
- Okay.

1461
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:27,222
Let's think.
Let's think together.

1462
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:30,458
Okay.

1463
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,460
I got a guesstimate.
- Yeah, I need one second.

1464
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:34,229
Hold on.
- Oh, boy.

1465
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:38,300
I instantly regret doing this.

1466
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:39,734
Justin.

1467
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:42,337
What?

1468
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:43,805
Okay.

1469
01:05:43,807 --> 01:05:46,508
I am ready.

1470
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:47,776
Okay, you first.

1471
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:49,577
I'm not going first 'cause
then you'll just...

1472
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:51,313
you'll hear my number and then
you're gonna change yours.

1473
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:53,181
We'll go at the same time.
- Okay, that sounds fair.

1474
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:54,849
On the count of three.
- Okay.

1475
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:56,318
Three...
- Wait, wait, wait.

1476
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,652
Does the other girl
in a threesome count?

1477
01:05:57,654 --> 01:06:00,588
What?

1478
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:01,690
Are you having a stroke?

1479
01:06:01,692 --> 01:06:03,024
No, I'm... I'm...

1480
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:04,259
I'd love to hear
more about that specific...

1481
01:06:04,261 --> 01:06:06,661
just do the countdown.
- Okay.

1482
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:07,929
Three...

1483
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:10,198
Two, one.

1484
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,600
8.
- 8.

1485
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:13,668
We have the same number.

1486
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,737
Yeah, crazy.

1487
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:16,905
Ha!
- Weird.

1488
01:06:16,907 --> 01:06:19,474
We have the same number.

1489
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:24,145
It's actually 12.
- Yeah, mine's 6.

1490
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,313
Six is respectable.

1491
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,082
No, it's embarrassing.

1492
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:28,917
You've been with
the right number of people

1493
01:06:28,919 --> 01:06:30,185
for someone your age.

1494
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:31,519
I've been with like no one.

1495
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:33,655
Yeah, that is kind
of embarrassing.

1496
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:35,190
I'm just kidding.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

1497
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:37,892
I wish I could take a lot
of mine back.

1498
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:39,995
I'd take one back.

1499
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:41,363
Ouch.

1500
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:42,230
Me?

1501
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:45,567
No, actually, not you.

1502
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:48,536
19.

1503
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:51,039
Mine's actually 41/2.
- 1/2?

1504
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:52,474
I didn't finish.

1505
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:54,909
I think it counts
if you've got your penis in.

1506
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:56,244
Oh, I got in.
- It counts.

1507
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:57,445
That counts as sex.

1508
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,614
Okay, so then
it's a solid five.

1509
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:06,121
I am very honored to be
the fifth notch in your bedpost.

1510
01:07:06,123 --> 01:07:10,658
Technically
it's in will's bedpost.

1511
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,926
Yeah, I know.

1512
01:07:11,928 --> 01:07:13,028
I know it well.

1513
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:15,797
Ah. No, no, no, no, no.

1514
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:17,599
Sorry.

1515
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:21,236
What did you get
out of that relationship?

1516
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:25,840
This is gonna sound cheesy.
I don't want to say.

1517
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:28,343
Will believed in me.

1518
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:31,346
He pushed me to do things.

1519
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:33,148
And I have a habit of not
following through all the way,

1520
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:36,051
so that was really good for me.

1521
01:07:36,053 --> 01:07:37,619
He's the one who told me
to take cooking classes.

1522
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:39,387
I would have never done that
in a million years.

1523
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:41,189
I would have made fun of it

1524
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:43,091
and then I would have not
followed through

1525
01:07:43,093 --> 01:07:44,392
and then I would have wished
that I had.

1526
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,593
Well, he was right on point
with that.

1527
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:47,395
I want to live
in this casserole.

1528
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,696
Yeah?
- Seriously.

1529
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:50,198
I want to pay taxes
to this casserole.

1530
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:55,336
See?

1531
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,445
No, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

1532
01:08:03,447 --> 01:08:04,913
I'm cleaning up.
- No.

1533
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:06,815
We're not cleaning up.
We don't have to clean up.

1534
01:08:06,817 --> 01:08:08,349
It's rude.

1535
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:13,054
I forbid you from doing
anything responsible forever.

1536
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,526
Oh, my god.
You really don't know how to be.

1537
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:22,397
I don't know
what to do with myself.

1538
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,533
Come on.

1539
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:27,869
Safe.

1540
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:34,843
Wh... ah.

1541
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:44,586
Ooh, it's nice out here.

1542
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:51,192
This is really nice.

1543
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,264
What are we doing?

1544
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:57,699
Will you relax?

1545
01:08:57,701 --> 01:08:59,968
I'm relaxed.
I love... I love being up high.

1546
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,970
I feel good, I feel good.

1547
01:09:01,972 --> 01:09:05,840
The air is nice and cool
up here.

1548
01:09:05,842 --> 01:09:07,442
What's going on?

1549
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:10,311
The sun's gonna come up soon.

1550
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,714
Yeah, it tends to do that.

1551
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,719
I survived the night.

1552
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:20,321
Yes, you did. No thanks to you.

1553
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:21,923
I could jump off this roof
right now.

1554
01:09:21,925 --> 01:09:24,592
Well, please help me inside
before you do 'cause I-i...

1555
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:27,162
yeah, no problem.
That'll only take 45 minutes.

1556
01:09:27,164 --> 01:09:28,830
I might change my mind.

1557
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:32,567
I'm winded, too.

1558
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:34,802
Thank you.

1559
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:38,006
I really appreciate it.

1560
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:40,775
No problem.

1561
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:43,745
You know, I really thought
I wanted to do it.

1562
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:46,714
But there was this moment when
I was drifting off

1563
01:09:46,716 --> 01:09:48,249
that I thought...

1564
01:09:48,251 --> 01:09:52,053
"No. Oh, shit."

1565
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:53,688
You know, you did take me here.

1566
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,557
You could have done this
by yourself.

1567
01:09:55,559 --> 01:09:57,358
I f...

1568
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,663
I feel like you wanted
to be found someway.

1569
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:03,631
Yeah, you're probably right.

1570
01:10:06,336 --> 01:10:09,103
You know,
I thought about it once.

1571
01:10:09,105 --> 01:10:11,372
I think everybody
thinks about it.

1572
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:14,342
I did more than think about it.

1573
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:16,878
Senior year,
I drove my dad's car into a tree

1574
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,746
and told everyone
I fell asleep at the wheel.

1575
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:20,715
Oh, my god.

1576
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:22,817
I was going
through a really tough time.

1577
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:26,254
I wanted to be
valedictorian so bad.

1578
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:29,357
There was this kid, Steve Kim.

1579
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:30,992
We were like neck-and-neck.

1580
01:10:30,994 --> 01:10:33,661
I beat that motherfucker.

1581
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:37,899
I was the valedictorian
of my high school.

1582
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:40,702
I gave the speech at graduation.

1583
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:45,873
I thought for sure
I would feel like...

1584
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:47,475
Fulfilled or something.

1585
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:51,212
Yeah.
- I didn't.

1586
01:10:51,214 --> 01:10:55,817
I felt the same way
I had before.

1587
01:10:55,819 --> 01:11:00,021
That's when I realized
my life would be a series

1588
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:02,991
of fights with the Steve Kims
of the world.

1589
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:10,999
And it just seemed daunting
because even if you win,

1590
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:12,800
it all feels the same.

1591
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:15,270
I think you're better off
than Steve Kim.

1592
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:18,206
You saved a life...

1593
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:19,474
Cool khakis.

1594
01:11:19,476 --> 01:11:21,142
He's a partner in instagram.

1595
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:23,478
Hmm.

1596
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:28,916
Thank you. I like my khakis.

1597
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,425
Anyway, I walked away
without a scratch.

1598
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:39,861
Totaled the car.
Wow. You are so lucky.

1599
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:41,763
That is not luck.
- That's luck.

1600
01:11:41,765 --> 01:11:45,600
That was a saab. That is
good, ol' Swedish engineering.

1601
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:47,468
Those things are tanks.

1602
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:49,937
You trying to sell me
a saab right now?

1603
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:51,506
No, I just, you know,

1604
01:11:51,508 --> 01:11:53,041
if I could have you
look over here...

1605
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:59,681
Anyway, my dad...

1606
01:11:59,683 --> 01:12:05,253
He gave me this
as like something

1607
01:12:05,255 --> 01:12:07,822
to remember the accident by.

1608
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:11,225
He has no idea
what I think of every time

1609
01:12:11,227 --> 01:12:14,662
I go to look at it.

1610
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:57,972
Shit.

1611
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,244
Sorry.

1612
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:05,480
Go ahead.

1613
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:10,952
Hey, Peter.

1614
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:12,954
Uh, yeah.

1615
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:27,468
Yeah.

1616
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:56,864
Madeline?

1617
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:02,170
Hello?

1618
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:11,312
Hi. Uh, just, um,
just hold on for one second.

1619
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:21,689
Hey.

1620
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:22,957
You're not gonna find them.

1621
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,059
Leave me alone.

1622
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:26,627
You have a phone call.

1623
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:27,962
I just want to go home.

1624
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,497
There's someone
that wants to speak to you.

1625
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:33,367
I don't want to talk to Peter.

1626
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:35,970
It's not Peter.

1627
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:42,043
What?

1628
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:57,358
Will?

1629
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,761
Come on. Don't tell me that.

1630
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:04,999
Nope.

1631
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:09,003
I don't really think
that's appropriate to ask.

1632
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,948
Okay.

1633
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:33,828
Yeah, right.

1634
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:36,964
And if I'm not here?

1635
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:43,905
You can try.

1636
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,193
So, they'll be here
in 20 minutes.

1637
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:14,168
Will wants to see me.

1638
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:21,142
Then you got what you wanted,
right?

1639
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,115
I'm gonna clean up.

1640
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:31,485
You know, it was Peter
who told him not to talk to me.

1641
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:32,987
Uhhuh.

1642
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:35,890
Yeah, will had no problem
following through with that.

1643
01:16:35,892 --> 01:16:40,061
Super happy for you.
It's gonna work out great.

1644
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:44,065
Dick.

1645
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:49,170
Fuck, that wine is good.

1646
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,575
Hey, look who's bringing
in the dishes.

1647
01:16:54,577 --> 01:16:56,777
Very responsible.

1648
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:59,213
You know what?
- What?

1649
01:16:59,215 --> 01:17:01,449
I'm just making sure
you don't get in trouble, okay?

1650
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:03,918
Uhhuh. This has nothing
to do with a certain someone

1651
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,286
who happens to be on their way?

1652
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:07,989
You have a bigger crush on will
than I do.

1653
01:17:07,991 --> 01:17:09,457
I would think
you're more concerned

1654
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:10,791
about who's showing up.

1655
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,259
You're trying to save his ass
all night.

1656
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:14,695
I'm the whore?
You're the fucking whore.

1657
01:17:14,697 --> 01:17:17,798
This is about more
than just you and me.

1658
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,967
What is it about? Football?

1659
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:24,005
Is it about your idol,
will Campbell?

1660
01:17:24,007 --> 01:17:26,407
Coach?

1661
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:28,676
I seriously cannot wrap my head

1662
01:17:28,678 --> 01:17:31,045
around why you still
believe in this guy.

1663
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:33,948
You don't believe in him
anymore?

1664
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,250
Okay. Let me just explain

1665
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:37,752
relationships to you.
Oh, I would love this.

1666
01:17:37,754 --> 01:17:39,120
Because you probably never
had one.

1667
01:17:39,122 --> 01:17:40,721
When you have a relationship
with someone,

1668
01:17:40,723 --> 01:17:42,256
you share things, you go deep,

1669
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:45,126
you have feelings that don't get
washed away so easily!

1670
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:46,994
And where does Sarah
fall in all this?

1671
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:50,231
You just proved you have no
idea what you're talking about.

1672
01:17:50,233 --> 01:17:52,533
You know,
she has her own secrets, too.

1673
01:17:52,535 --> 01:17:53,768
She's not perfect.

1674
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:57,171
Train wreck.

1675
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,073
Excuse me?

1676
01:17:59,075 --> 01:18:03,244
I said
you're a fucking train wreck.

1677
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:04,845
I'm a fucking train wreck?
- Yeah.

1678
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:06,580
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

1679
01:18:06,582 --> 01:18:08,015
You think life has to be
this...

1680
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,784
who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?!

1681
01:18:09,786 --> 01:18:10,851
You can say that to me?!
Look at you!

1682
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,253
You're empty inside!

1683
01:18:12,255 --> 01:18:13,821
You haven't lived a day
in your fucking life

1684
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:15,122
until you met me!

1685
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:17,725
You used me to get to will.

1686
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:19,393
And now you're gonna
bring him down with you.

1687
01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:21,162
Yeah, you got me pegged.

1688
01:18:21,164 --> 01:18:23,164
You're so smart.

1689
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:25,733
I think I do.

1690
01:18:25,735 --> 01:18:27,601
Enlighten me.

1691
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:32,773
You're just
a scared little girl.

1692
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:35,176
That's it.

1693
01:18:35,178 --> 01:18:36,277
Mmhmm.

1694
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:39,480
What about a regular
relationship?

1695
01:18:39,482 --> 01:18:43,284
It's too boring, right?

1696
01:18:43,286 --> 01:18:45,286
Too mundane.

1697
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:46,554
Got to cry for help.

1698
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:48,589
Got to pull some shit
like last night, right?

1699
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:51,358
Fuck you!

1700
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,295
Let me ask you a question
since you're the better person

1701
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:57,031
here, right? Mr. morality.
I didn't say that.

1702
01:18:57,033 --> 01:18:59,433
Let me ask you a question.
- Mm-hmm.

1703
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:01,435
What would you have done
if I died last night?

1704
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:03,070
Then you'd be dead.

1705
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:04,438
You're not listening.

1706
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,440
What would you have done?

1707
01:19:06,442 --> 01:19:10,478
Would you have called 911
finally instead of wasting time

1708
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,114
calling Pete,
calling this secret doctor,

1709
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:15,583
instead of calling someone who
could actually save my life?!

1710
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:17,418
You're a fucking coward!

1711
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,320
You're a piece of shit!

1712
01:19:19,322 --> 01:19:24,358
I bet... I bet if Peter
told you to drive by a hospital

1713
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,961
and open up the door
and let me fucking tumble out,

1714
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:28,162
you would you have done it!

1715
01:19:28,164 --> 01:19:29,563
And you want to know
why I know that?

1716
01:19:29,565 --> 01:19:31,332
It's because you're a stupid,
little bitch,

1717
01:19:31,334 --> 01:19:33,400
and you would do anything
they tell you to do

1718
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:35,770
'cause you don't have
a fucking brain of your own!

1719
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:38,172
Yeah, walk away.

1720
01:19:38,174 --> 01:19:40,341
I'll tell them you said hi.

1721
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:52,119
Call me a fucking bitch.

1722
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:54,722
You're a bitch. Fucking bitch.

1723
01:19:54,724 --> 01:19:58,159
Mort st... fucking bitch.

1724
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:09,370
Ow!

1725
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:24,612
So, the bedroom is even cleaner
than we found it.

1726
01:21:24,614 --> 01:21:29,917
There's no sign
of illicit love-making anywhere.

1727
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:33,187
That's great.

1728
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:48,035
And you're gonna be a big hero.

1729
01:21:48,037 --> 01:21:51,405
Your career's gonna take off.

1730
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:54,341
Sky's the limit.

1731
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:02,483
And you'll get will back.

1732
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,658
Everybody wins.

1733
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:58,105
Maddie.

1734
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,880
Try one of those on.

1735
01:23:06,882 --> 01:23:10,150
I don't really, uh,
smoke that much.

1736
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:11,852
You'll like it.

1737
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:17,491
Yeah, it's smooth.

1738
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,497
You know, Kevin, you really
do look like a dog's asshole

1739
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:25,065
right now.

1740
01:23:25,067 --> 01:23:27,568
Yeah, well,
it's been a long night.

1741
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:33,207
Trust me.
It won't go unappreciated.

1742
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:35,442
Will and I were talking.

1743
01:23:35,444 --> 01:23:37,211
There might be a spot on
the coaching staff opening up

1744
01:23:37,213 --> 01:23:40,347
that could have your name on it.

1745
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:45,719
Coaching staff, huh?

1746
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:49,156
Liked the way
you handled yourself.

1747
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:58,932
What's gonna happen to her?

1748
01:23:58,934 --> 01:24:02,269
You look good.

1749
01:24:02,271 --> 01:24:04,171
You don't have to be here.

1750
01:24:04,173 --> 01:24:06,073
I know you don't have time
for my bullshit.

1751
01:24:06,075 --> 01:24:09,209
Maddie, don't. Don't say that.

1752
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:14,381
Shouldn't you be with the team,
your family?

1753
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:16,750
No.

1754
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:19,086
I should be right here with you.

1755
01:24:19,088 --> 01:24:20,587
Right.

1756
01:24:20,589 --> 01:24:23,390
I needed to see you.
- You're only saying this now

1757
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:24,625
'cause you don't want me to go
to the press.

1758
01:24:24,627 --> 01:24:27,995
That's not true.
You want the truth?

1759
01:24:27,997 --> 01:24:29,063
You want the truth
about how I feel?

1760
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:30,297
Yeah.
- I love you.

1761
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:33,500
I want you back in my life.

1762
01:24:33,502 --> 01:24:36,236
I never wanted you
out of my life.

1763
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:37,771
But it's complicated.

1764
01:24:37,773 --> 01:24:41,075
It's complicated.
- Yeah, it's complicated.

1765
01:24:41,077 --> 01:24:43,977
You know it is.
It's complicated.

1766
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:48,549
So I don't know
what to do here.

1767
01:24:48,551 --> 01:24:50,717
First thing,
I want to make sure you're okay.

1768
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:54,021
I'm fine.

1769
01:24:54,023 --> 01:24:56,924
I don't think you're fine.
- I'm the best I've ever been.

1770
01:24:58,494 --> 01:25:01,061
I love you,
and I have missed you.

1771
01:25:01,063 --> 01:25:03,397
God, I missed you.

1772
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:04,798
You don't miss me.

1773
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,769
You miss late-night quickies
and room service.

1774
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:10,104
Well, yeah.

1775
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:17,077
Come on, maddie.

1776
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:19,580
It's more than that
and you know it.

1777
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:24,051
Will you look at me?

1778
01:25:24,053 --> 01:25:26,253
What?

1779
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:29,756
Never mind.

1780
01:25:29,758 --> 01:25:31,425
What?

1781
01:25:33,429 --> 01:25:37,898
did you and Kevin...?

1782
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,299
Here in my house?

1783
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:42,102
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1784
01:25:42,104 --> 01:25:44,138
Did he kiss you?

1785
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,672
What? Are you jealous?

1786
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:48,542
Yeah. I am.

1787
01:25:48,544 --> 01:25:51,545
I'm jealous. How about that.

1788
01:25:51,547 --> 01:25:53,013
Good.
- Do you like that?

1789
01:25:53,015 --> 01:25:54,248
I like it a lot.
- Uh-huh.

1790
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:57,151
It's different.
- Uh-huh.

1791
01:25:57,153 --> 01:25:59,887
Hey.

1792
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:05,526
God, maddie,
when I got that call

1793
01:26:05,528 --> 01:26:08,695
and I heard what happened,
I didn't know what to do.

1794
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:13,467
Hey, I don't want to lose you.

1795
01:26:13,469 --> 01:26:16,036
I don't.
I don't want to lose you.

1796
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:18,772
I love you.

1797
01:26:19,774 --> 01:26:21,909
Trust me.
I don't like it, either.

1798
01:26:21,911 --> 01:26:24,878
But if he wants to risk
having her around,

1799
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,182
what can I do about it?

1800
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:37,257
Kevin.

1801
01:26:37,259 --> 01:26:40,494
Thank you for looking
after maddie last night.

1802
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:47,034
You all right?

1803
01:26:47,036 --> 01:26:50,671
I know about Kyle Walker.

1804
01:26:50,673 --> 01:26:53,173
Yeah,
he's a good football player.

1805
01:26:53,175 --> 01:26:56,276
How'd you get him to come here?

1806
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,884
What do you know?

1807
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:07,521
You know, just the p's.

1808
01:27:07,523 --> 01:27:08,589
The p's.

1809
01:27:08,591 --> 01:27:11,625
Persistence, preparation...

1810
01:27:11,627 --> 01:27:12,793
Payoffs.

1811
01:27:12,795 --> 01:27:15,229
Kevin, I wasn't done
talking to you.

1812
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:16,530
It's okay, Pete.
- Yeah.

1813
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:19,366
I was done with you, though.

1814
01:27:19,368 --> 01:27:21,101
Okay, Kevin,
you're disappointed in me.

1815
01:27:21,103 --> 01:27:22,736
I get it.

1816
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:26,139
But everything I've done
is for the sake of this program.

1817
01:27:26,141 --> 01:27:27,708
And one day if you find yourself

1818
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:30,010
in a position like mine...
and I think you will...

1819
01:27:30,012 --> 01:27:31,545
you're gonna find out
that making tough decisions

1820
01:27:31,547 --> 01:27:34,114
is a big part of the job.

1821
01:27:34,116 --> 01:27:36,550
Trust me when I tell you,

1822
01:27:36,552 --> 01:27:39,720
these decisions are what got us
where we are today.

1823
01:27:39,722 --> 01:27:44,358
But I don't trust you, so...

1824
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:49,429
What are you doing?

1825
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:53,100
What are you doing?

1826
01:27:53,102 --> 01:27:56,270
Kevin, we appreciate you
taking care of her, all right?

1827
01:27:58,841 --> 01:28:01,074
Should have given those to you
hours ago.

1828
01:28:01,076 --> 01:28:02,809
Kevin, listen to me.

1829
01:28:02,811 --> 01:28:04,711
Hey.

1830
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:06,813
Kevin.

1831
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:08,915
Think about your future!

1832
01:28:11,854 --> 01:28:14,254
Just needs a little while
to cool down.

1833
01:28:14,256 --> 01:28:16,623
How do you know?

1834
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:18,425
Maddie, you had to get
a good sense of this guy.

1835
01:28:18,427 --> 01:28:21,194
He's upset now,
but he'll come around, right?

1836
01:28:21,196 --> 01:28:25,332
Yeah, will.

1837
01:28:25,334 --> 01:28:28,468
Besides, you can talk anyone
into anything.

1838
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:33,340
Yeah. It was a nice
fucking mess you got us in.

1839
01:28:33,342 --> 01:28:35,208
I'll go talk to him.

1840
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:36,443
Would you?
- Yeah.

1841
01:28:36,445 --> 01:28:38,011
Just tell him to come back
in here.

1842
01:28:38,013 --> 01:28:40,180
Yeah, I'll... I'll just fix it.

1843
01:28:40,182 --> 01:28:42,883
Thank you.

1844
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:50,691
All right.

1845
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,403
Hey.

1846
01:29:03,405 --> 01:29:06,373
Hi.
- What are you doing?

1847
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:09,376
I guess I'm changing
my five-year plan.

1848
01:29:09,378 --> 01:29:11,545
You want a ride?

1849
01:29:11,547 --> 01:29:13,447
What about will?

1850
01:29:13,449 --> 01:29:17,050
I hope he wins.

1851
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:24,591
Where to?
