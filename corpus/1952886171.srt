1
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,013
The need in taupe.

2
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:52,549
Topo. T, O, P, O. Topo.

3
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,016
Now, for the front
of the shirts ...

4
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,984
... I see blue ...

5
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,091
... or maybe ... Sky blue.

6
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,783
Do not know what it is
blue?

7
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,929
I can not believe you work in a
fabric store and not know colors.

8
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,496
Get a new job.

9
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,893
PROHIBITED PASS

10
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:11,661
Yes

11
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,205
Would you believe that Ricky brought ...

12
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,706
... one of my students
as a companion?

13
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,902
Be fair. I did not know
Brandon was a student that yours ...

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,139
... to enter
male prostitutes in point ...

15
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,482
Wherever you choose
their boyfriends.

16
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,879
Attention, passengers.

17
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,452
The ferry dock in five minutes.

18
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,283
Welcome to Martha's Vineyard.

19
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:41,356
Noah, awake, baby.
We.

20
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,866
Come on, let me show you something.

21
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,777
This is my favorite part
coming here.

22
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,511
Everything is so beautiful.

23
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,343
Only the best for my love.

24
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,777
The king of my world.

25
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,826
Is not it beautiful, guys?

26
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,034
Ricky, if my stripes Louis,
we will be just you and me.

27
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,999
Yes, massa.

28
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,799
The dog could help
to carry your bags.

29
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,443
I bet that Trey is happy
for not coming.

30
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,139
Now, Trey, is the husband
Alex, right?

31
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,285
Yes, they had to stay home
with the new baby.

32
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:10,013
Thank God. On this trip, the last
we need is a baby screaming.

33
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,454
I think you took care of that.

34
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,291
- Surprisingly, Wade.
- Did you see the ocean view?

35
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,660
This house is intense.

36
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:59,062
So here will be held
the wedding, right? Wade and Joey Do?

37
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,571
Son Wade and Noah, Randy.

38
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,141
N, O, A, H.

39
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,972
It's Brandon, Ricky.

40
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,943
B, R, A, N, D, O, N.

41
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,514
Welcome home
of Robinson.

42
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,956
The rooms are upstairs,
names are in the doors.

43
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,825
In the words of Dominique
Devereaux from "Dynasty" ...

44
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:30,732
... do not sleep with your clothes on
or sleep with clothes.

45
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,564
I need two rooms.

46
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,064
You unpack.

47
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,210
I'll show Noah
something behind.

48
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,936
Hey.

49
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,945
- Child will not work.
- They have no prospects.

50
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,883
I give them two months.

51
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,148
I think not.

52
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,088
Why do you think
that marriage does not work?

53
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,591
I do not believe in marriage.

54
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,356
For men monogamy
is a contradiction in terms.

55
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:03,559
But Wade and Noah have
some unique problems.

56
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,363
The problem is the accident.

57
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,903
It's what brought them together.

58
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,201
- Both are spiteful.
- Wade had a car accident?

59
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:15,245
- Noah helped him recover.
- How romantic.

60
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,883
Except that what caused the crash
was a fight ...

61
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,714
... between Wade and her boyfriend after
seeing Wade and Noah in action.

62
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:26,991
- Sounds like a novel.
- Why not work.

63
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,788
Life is not a novel.

64
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,157
But everything in life
bounces off something.

65
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,596
But this drama
enhanced emotional is not real.

66
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,860
I mean, what is
when is it?

67
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,594
Two people with nothing in common ...

68
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,569
... that even
is like a special way.

69
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,509
- Should not tell Noah?
- For what purpose, Trey?

70
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,776
Noah is only for Wade.
You will not hear a thing.

71
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,045
Love is blind.

72
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,620
What are you wearing?

73
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,917
This wedding should run
with some military precision.

74
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,721
- I'm channeling ...
- Who, The Village People?

75
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,055
You're cute.

76
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,690
Are we going to use all these
in one weekend?

77
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,063
Only if the local types
are horrible.

78
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,607
Herf "the feelings of the baby?

79
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,641
Let's see if we can do
something about it.

80
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,676
There.

81
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,580
Hello, O.J. How is our
small Zulu warrior?

82
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,653
Alex, for the umpteenth time ...

83
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,688
... is Ojemodupe.
- Never mind. O.J. For short.

84
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:36,557
Before you forget, the local provider
is still a damn, so it looks.

85
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,560
I need you to go FedEx ...

86
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,256
... and send a lot of things for the wedding.

87
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,368
No, Alex. I must be at the clinic in an hour.

88
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,197
You can do
way.

89
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,862
Take pencil and paper, because there should be no errors.

90
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,874
Blue you write, right?

91
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,815
I really missed this place.

92
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,111
As a child I used to come
every summer.

93
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,846
Spring Break, Christmas.

94
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,218
- This barn was my sanctuary.
- But ...

95
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,262
... Where are the boats?
- Down.

96
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,695
It was kind of your parents who let us use this ...

97
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,301
... especially in light of their opinion
over gay marriage.

98
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,669
My grandfather left us the house
all.

99
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,067
I use it anytime.

100
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,140
And when my parents die, will be mine.

101
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:30,045
And after we get married ...

102
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,242
... also will be yours.

103
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,823
It is the fifth call in an hour.

104
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,119
It must be important.

105
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,990
Answers.

106
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,260
- Hi, Brandy.
- How is my favorite writer?

107
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,993
I'm fine, Brandy.
What?

108
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,365
I sent some notes from the script.
Do you received?

109
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,370
I need the draft
early Monday.

110
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,600
Not yet.
I have revised my email.

111
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:02,373
But Wade and I were married this weekend, so ...

112
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,641
- Are you getting married?
- In Massachusetts.

113
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,081
- On Martha's Vineyard.
- Noah, listen.

114
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,484
This film is one of the premieres
Paramount's most important.

115
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,284
What will I tell the studio head?
What you did not do your work ...

116
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,656
... because you were busy
symbolic ritual with your boyfriend?

117
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,423
And when you ask why
I did not know before ...

118
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,330
... I'll say: "I guess I must have
offended because I do not even invited.

119
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,937
Invite only a few close friends, but ...

120
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,665
"And I'm not a close friend?

121
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,004
Of course we would love to come.
I'll send the information.

122
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,237
Not coming.
Not coming.

123
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:38,713
No, it's very last minute.
But good luck this weekend.

124
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,581
I hope my comp
box on Monday morning.

125
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,745
- Brandy, do not listen.
- Bye.

126
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,833
My God, what now?

127
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,032
Alex!

128
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,336
Now that I have your attention ...

129
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,039
... time to announce
the beginning ...

130
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,186
Operation ...
wedding weekend perfect.

131
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:18,289
I have the whole weekend split
in one hour segments.

132
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,426
Can we have some
time to enjoy being here?

133
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,528
Then we will all
wedding things you like.

134
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,960
If you want this wedding
fall behind ...

135
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,362
... within minutes of our arrival,
okay.

136
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:31,094
When finished enjoying
"being here" ...

137
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,966
... mom will be in the kitchen
candied yams ...

138
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,768
... and peeling shrimp for soup.

139
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,834
They are confused ...

140
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,980
... if you think I'm going to be working like a slave ...

141
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,479
Well, according to the schedule, says ...

142
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,917
... Ricky must be "taking pictures backyard canopy ...

143
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,920
... to send over the Internet the florist ...

144
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:53,752
... for the leaves to make the game ".

145
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,622
Sure.

146
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,163
Well, Counter teacher, how makes you and Mr. Macintyre ...

147
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,131
... Eddie and Chance, Brandon,
at least this weekend.

148
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,668
And four years.
Married for three.

149
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,169
It's so good.

150
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,570
My longest relationship is four months, almost.

151
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:13,234
Well, when you are young, naturally that just want to have fun.

152
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,142
And even when you're not so young.

153
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,783
But we are very happy, do not you, baby?

154
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,215
I've never been happier.

155
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,524
- Who is?
- It's Arthur, the caregiver.

156
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,289
Makes gardening
fills the fridge ...

157
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,888
... turn on the heating.

158
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,688
Maybe I can warm it.

159
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,423
- He is a heterosexual, Ricky.
- I have not yet known.

160
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,396
Ricky.

161
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,504
Sure you can lend a hand
the teacher.

162
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,471
"You said you were
love it, right?

163
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,736
See you at dinner.

164
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,641
Ever ago
what couples do?

165
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,548
Not really. He tells
"say yes to life".

166
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,916
Rather, say yes to STDs.

167
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,886
- You have to excuse him.
- No, I'm not mistaken with Ricky.

168
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,691
Just have fun, okay?

169
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:11,428
- And on that thing you said ...
- What? I heard nothing.

170
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,437
Thanks, professor.
I mean, Chance.

171
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,009
I'll check my email.

172
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,882
"Practice of cake cutting.

173
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,354
We, love.

174
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,963
- Pie!
- Come on, time on the cake.

175
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,037
Look, I really was not
in love with Chance.

176
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,143
It's just so inspiring.

177
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,905
All that passion that makes
in their classes and seminars.

178
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,915
Interesting.
Alex did not put you name.

179
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:03,146
Just wrote
"Ricky's the trick."

180
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,328
So this is be gay?

181
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:17,060
Does being a prostitute who can not
saying no or being bored and tired ...

182
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,901
... pretending to be happy?

183
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,505
Here's my little warrior Zulu.

184
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,977
- Is not it nice, baby?
- It's so adorable.

185
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,517
I do not know how you can be away from him a minute.

186
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,850
I know. We wanted him to bring, but
Doctors said it was too soon.

187
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,651
We've him had only two months and with its immune system ...

188
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,522
- It's definitely positive?
- We do not know.

189
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,392
Most babies to mothers with HIV are positive ...

190
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,762
... in the first six months,
I have or not.

191
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,995
So we are waiting.

192
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,702
You miss him.

193
00:12:56,408 --> 00:13:00,344
Honestly, baby, it's nice
rest, because he cries a lot.

194
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,980
Raise the roof of the house.

195
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:06,812
But only the weekend. Will
mother in the arms of Alex on Monday.

196
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,318
Where is Ricky
with those photos of foliage?

197
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,479
Watch my sweet, baby.
Ricky!

198
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:12,715
Where are you, bitch?

199
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,122
I know you're fast
taking the damn photos.

200
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,353
What do you think about having children?

201
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,296
We still have not moved
together, papo.

202
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,401
That changed Monday.

203
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,630
Then we can discuss it on Monday,
when we married respectable.

204
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,708
We will have no children
born out of wedlock.

205
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,275
You're so sad.

206
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,549
- Baby Gat.
- Send a voice mail.

207
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,514
Probably named to congratulate me.

208
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,051
You lie.

209
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,156
You know, this marriage
never work ...

210
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,349
... if you do not learn to trust me.

211
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,357
I trust you.

212
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,359
This crazy and stupid spoiled
is another matter.

213
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,862
He's obsessed with you
since he refuses.

214
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,593
You know I like
Baby Gat, right?

215
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,768
- No?
- Yes

216
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,909
Then stop fooling yourself, papo.

217
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,747
I hear they cut cake.

218
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,416
Thanks, baby.

219
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,862
We need to talk.

220
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,534
- What does it matter?
- Who says we are wrong?

221
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,505
- Brandon.
- Brandon is in love with me.

222
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,903
Sure it would.

223
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,307
But in the room,
Couples talked about ...

224
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,039
... who marry and then discover
who do not like.

225
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,378
He was talking about
Noah and Wade, not us.

226
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,822
Okay.

227
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,585
- Eddie, I ...
- Dinner is served.

228
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,038
Bow our heads.

229
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:14,339
Lord, thank you
for giving me the strength ...

230
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,676
... to prepare
This delicious meal ...

231
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,247
... without anyone's help.

232
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,012
Alex.

233
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,850
Thanks for the wonderful
gifts of love and friendship ...

234
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:31,019
... you have given us this day.
Amen.

235
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,896
- Amen!
- Amen.

236
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,462
- See you later.
- Bye.

237
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,812
What's for dinner?
I'm starving.

238
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,779
Let's eat.

239
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,553
Have they decided
about the name?

240
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,421
"You shall put the name of Noah,
it yours, or both?

241
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,562
- Still not decided.
- We'll take both.

242
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,323
And if you go to a place like
Saudi Arabia ...

243
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,831
... will not be presented as
lord and master.

244
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,027
I doubt we're going to Saudi Arabia.

245
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,001
Well, what about Jamaica?

246
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,404
Sometimes you have to be pioneers.

247
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,943
You should try to be brave.
That's where it starts.

248
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,513
- I thought only joking.
- About what?

249
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,774
The double surname.

250
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,885
I mean, if you want to put my name
with yours, well ...

251
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,021
... but do not know.
- When you meet the perfect guy ...

252
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,056
... definitely want to put
his name with mine.

253
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,125
Homosexuals
are like stars.

254
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,558
The stars never change
their surnames when they marry.

255
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,130
Diana can marry
anything you want.

256
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,133
It will always be Miss Ross.

257
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,295
But marriage is a statement
before the world, right?

258
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,601
The reality is somewhat more
complicated than a big gesture.

259
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,801
You know what?
How about a toast?

260
00:16:55,547 --> 00:17:00,450
To Noah, for making me the honor
give me her hand in marriage ...

261
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,754
... call us
as we call it then ...

262
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,949
... and wherever we choose
spend our holidays.

263
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,924
To Noah.

264
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,132
You know, I think it is surprising
that you and Mr. Iverson ...

265
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,997
... manage an HIV clinic
and adopt an African orphan.

266
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:23,267
Surprisingly, unlike some
unnamed superstar ...

267
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,309
follow the proper channels ...
in our adoption.

268
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,236
And Professor Counter,
I mean, Chance ...

269
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,042
... he and her husband,
have a daughter, right?

270
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:36,586
Little Ethiopia.
It's so cute.

271
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:40,350
- I thought it was Kenya.
- Yes, Kenya, yes.

272
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,551
It is with the parents of Eddie
during the weekend.

273
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,593
And their parents know
what him and Chance?

274
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,556
What about your parents?

275
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:54,603
If I told my parents I am gay they disown me.

276
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,901
But I want to, you know?

277
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,778
I want to know who I am
and who love me anyway.

278
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,138
And I feel that unless I tell them ...

279
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,911
... not give them the opportunity
to know the real me.

280
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,554
Understand?

281
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:14,687
Look, never tell anyone
he has to tell.

282
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,055
You do what's right for you.

283
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,722
Make sure that decisions
you make are the foundations ...

284
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,061
... the world in which
want to live.

285
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,167
It's getting late and we must
get up at dawn.

286
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,773
So why
do not you go to bed?

287
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:37,612
- Here.
- What is this?

288
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:42,279
- Condoms, and you better use them.
- Because Ricky is promiscuous.

289
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,252
Although Ricky was a saint,
met him last week.

290
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,621
You should always use condoms.

291
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,523
Thanks, Alex.

292
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,896
Nene, take your little
tight ass up.

293
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,737
What do snowflakes
at night?

294
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,439
God scattered diamonds
on black velvet.

295
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,288
Why did not you
Wade I marry?

296
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,387
I just want to be happy.

297
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,461
Do not you think I can make Wade happy?

298
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,088
Do not think anyone
can be happy without being free.

299
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,061
Why are you so afraid?

300
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,405
Then why did you bring to Brandon?

301
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,310
I do not know.

302
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,379
The other day I was looking at pornography
and it occurred to me.

303
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,807
The idea of being locked
a weekend ...

304
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:49,010
... with a group of married couples
scared me.

305
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,061
Being trapped.

306
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,999
That's what scares me most.

307
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,796
But that's what you do not understand
on Wade and myself.

308
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,632
It is love that frees us.

309
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,673
Love is just a word.

310
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,901
Freedom too.

311
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,439
What pornography?

312
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:21,414
What looked at pornography
when you had that epiphany?

313
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,680
"Under the Habit".

314
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,379
What?

315
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,550
"These monks kneel
but not to pray. "

316
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,332
I think it's my place, my brother.

317
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,936
- Good night, Ricky.
- Good evening.

318
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,768
- Hello.
- Hello.

319
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,512
My weddingbook!

320
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:59,418
You left it in the downstairs bathroom.
I stuck with tape.

321
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,892
Chance is my bible.

322
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,290
You look tired and too late.
Go to sleep.

323
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,398
Sleep?
Baby, I sew it all.

324
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,228
I design a wedding cake.
I have things to do.

325
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,199
At the risk of
a stupid question ...

326
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,963
... Why did not you order a cake?

327
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,935
What is that?

328
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,711
It is one thing
I'm a bit ... momentum.

329
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,747
- Alex.
- It's herbal, not tea.

330
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,281
"Herbs?

331
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,282
Herbs!

332
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,126
Can I connect?

333
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,862
Sure.

334
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,596
What the hell is this?

335
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,472
DowneLink is my profile.

336
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,611
"Like in" oral sex "?

337
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,644
It is not something sexual, Ricky.

338
00:21:55,814 --> 00:22:00,342
It is a place of friendship. It's like
MySpace but for homosexuals, and. ..

339
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:05,149
Yes, I understand, as
Black Gay Chat or Whatstea.

340
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,328
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, baby, how are you?

341
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,865
- How are you?
- There must be a handsome man ...

342
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,502
... on this island.

343
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,400
Look, the thing is ...

344
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,541
... I tell you something.

345
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,438
Something important.

346
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,271
Fat, old, fat, ugly ...

347
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,710
... damn thin, nothing.

348
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:34,443
No, Mom, Myla not became pregnant. We are only friends.

349
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:39,079
Look, the thing is,  I am gay.

350
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:43,394
Homosexuality? What the hell you mean you're gay?

351
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,360
- I'm out.
- I feel for not faint.

352
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,395
Do not expect me awake.

353
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,968
It is a sin, Brandon. Sin!

354
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,595
Hi Mom ...
Mama, no.

355
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,470
- Mom ...
- Wait to tell your father!

356
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:02,306
Insurance will have a heart
in the act! God!

357
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,381
Homosexuality? Homosexuality?

358
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,657
What?
"Ricky did something?

359
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:23,662
I was so inspired
to be with you ...

360
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,532
... to hear your families accepted you.

361
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,504
So I called my mom and told her I'm gay.

362
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:36,536
- What happened?
- Called my dad ...

363
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,377
... and he said he does not want me to come back.

364
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:44,318
- Do not want to be alone tonight.
- Of course not.

365
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:50,453
- Limits?
- Shut up, Eddie.

366
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,559
Well, well.

367
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,244
What are you looking?

368
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,481
To you.

369
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,790
You know it's our last chance.

370
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,659
Why?

371
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,793
Premarital sex.

372
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,767
What's farewells
singles?

373
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:38,740
Well, premarital sex between us.

374
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,046
What do you mean with "bachelor parties"?

375
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,712
- No I meant.
- Is better for you.

376
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,271
No kisses.

377
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,175
Yes

378
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,768
Police Department
Martha's Vineyard.

379
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,636
Get away from the tree.

380
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,529
Breakfast in bed for the happy couple!

381
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,601
Alex.

382
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,879
Is not this fun, baby? Pancakes, maple syrup ...

383
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,947
... bacon, scrambled eggs,
hard-boiled ...

384
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,175
... toast, coffee,
tea, orange juice ...

385
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,683
... my mom's cookies
candied yams and my ...

386
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,187
... and you'd better eat it all.
Enjoy it!

387
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,129
Breakfast in bed!

388
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,161
They are at 5:50 a.m.

389
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,823
Breakfast!

390
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,362
I think Ricky and Brandon escaped.

391
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,940
They were probably walking.

392
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,339
Or for a car ride.
Ricky's car is not.

393
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,140
They say, fled.

394
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,475
Damn, are they getting fatter?

395
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,982
Alex, are sweet potatoes for breakfast?

396
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,553
Chance, how many times
I tell you?

397
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,418
The sweet potatoes are the new
for breakfast. Magazine "O".

398
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:16,219
Now eat it today
need all your strength ...

399
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:21,024
... because you have to
millions of things. Yes?

400
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,797
Care.

401
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,030
That was close.

402
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,364
Great.

403
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,276
They say they can not deliver samples of bed linen ...

404
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,777
... or Doric columns.

405
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:39,212
Farewell to my temple Arcadio as the theme for the wedding.

406
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,908
You know what time is it, Alex?

407
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,249
- Yes, 6:01.
- No, L.A. It's 3 a.m.

408
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,822
So? Just as you feed your baby.

409
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,983
Hello, O.J.!
What are you doing up so late?

410
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,391
You know your dad must go
to work tomorrow to make money ...

411
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,794
... so you can buy something when you return.

412
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,546
What?

413
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,708
Recently, your look.

414
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,753
Sounds like a total stranger.

415
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,819
No, no, no, it's good.

416
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,894
It means that even ...
Still fascinates me.

417
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,226
You're still my man of mystery.

418
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,923
You are so weird.

419
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,601
And by the way ...

420
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:41,612
... the answer to that question you ask last night is yes.

421
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,547
I would like to have children ...

422
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,744
... but not soon.

423
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,749
Boy, can that
want to download.

424
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,254
Idiot!
Does this seem red?

425
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,921
I said red roses, not lavender,
pink, green, or those colors!

426
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,897
- Are you colorblind?
- Sorry, Mr. Kirby ...

427
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,160
... but the order
says "lavender".

428
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:06,633
If there is any problem,
call the store.

429
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,535
Alex, purple is my favorite color.

430
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,879
I guess it will pretty
with the costumes.

431
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,040
Thank you very much.

432
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,213
Thank you very much.
Take care.

433
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,386
What now?

434
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:33,219
- Take care, okay?
- Okay.

435
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:42,505
Where were you, Ricky?

436
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,608
- I could not sleep, so ...
- Can we take him to the backyard?

437
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,450
Beware, beware. Come on.

438
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,154
Eddie, Eddie, beware with flowers.

439
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,360
Put them there. Well.

440
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:13,204
Well, bitch, what happened?

441
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,398
I could not sleep, so I went for a walk in the park ...

442
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,907
... the other side of the island.
- Let's skip the preamble dishonest.

443
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,602
You were in the woods for Men.

444
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,543
Despite having a young adorable in your room.

445
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,344
- I saw this guy and...
- Do we need to hear this?

446
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,008
No, but we want to.

447
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:32,782
Well, when we were, you know, the police appeared.

448
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,926
The guy got away, and I remained alone.

449
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,824
- Ricky ...
- Wait, wait, wait. Improve.

450
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:43,865
I spent the night in jail for public indecency.

451
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,401
I hope Wade's family does not find out ...

452
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,004
... on this offense at your door.

453
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:49,605
It is a misdemeanor.

454
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:53,403
And the best part is that the night Sergeant was attractive.

455
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,636
And I liked it.

456
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:58,543
So I've got two guys on a night and a free trip home.

457
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,775
Which reminds me that someone should take me to the park ...

458
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,044
... to pick up my rental car.

459
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,515
Bravo, Ricky.

460
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:08,750
On my wedding weekend?

461
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,292
Really?

462
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:14,261
It's your wedding, not mine.

463
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,065
Damn!

464
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:24,436
If another person and not Ricky, I'd swear he was jealous.

465
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,978
I hope the weather clears before the wedding.

466
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,809
Oh, shit.

467
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,041
Shit!

468
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,117
- Shit, shit!
- What?

469
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,982
Reset the pages I worked the last two hours.

470
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,714
I said, save often.

471
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,189
- That does not help me.
- What works, Professor?

472
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,762
The paradigms of the free market capitalist consumerism ...

473
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,490
... and individual freedom seen through the eyes of a slave ...

474
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,760
... on the auction block.
- Well, it seems profound.

475
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:55,497
It is. Overall
I hope to release ...

476
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,039
... black gay men controlling forces of both ...

477
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,076
... the free market mentality where slavery is rooted ...

478
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,043
... and attitudes of hatred to one induced under the same models ...

479
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,809
... current psychoanalysis.
- It's so amazing.

480
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:11,820
When was the last time well you get excited about us?

481
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,824
What has my book to do with our marriage?

482
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,723
God, I go crazy.

483
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:21,058
If this has to do with me because I
have spent the night with you ...

484
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,201
Would you mind giving us a moment?

485
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,037
Yes, sure, Mr. Macintyre.

486
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:31,570
It has nothing to do with
last night, Brandon.

487
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:42,709
Lose those pages you more angry
that the idea of losing your marriage.

488
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,587
Is it the real you?

489
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,750
Your husband and your daughter are just decoration ...

490
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,689
... for your intellectual vocation?

491
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,353
Yes they were, then this marriage ...

492
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,522
... will never work because I need ...

493
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,863
... for us to be your center.

494
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,134
So?

495
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,708
Eddie, I ...

496
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,113
I do not know.

497
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:21,891
Well, you thought, or else ...

498
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,995
Or if not what?

499
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,541
What's so funny?

500
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,973
I discovered something.

501
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,051
Why do you do what you do.

502
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,122
The sex is just a distraction.

503
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,858
What?

504
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,149
Of truth.

505
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,723
And what would the truth, exactly?

506
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,531
You're in love with Noah.

507
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:12,100
Nice try, Brandon, but I am too big for mind games ...

508
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,141
... and you're too young for them.

509
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,645
- Then I dare you.
- What?

510
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,146
Kiss him. Now.

511
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,584
Go up and kiss him. Then tell me I'm wrong.

512
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,586
Because I've seen how you look ...

513
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,692
... and I've seen the way that it supports the body.

514
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:34,423
I have 19 years, but I know
much more about love than you, Ricky.

515
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,260
Go to hell.

516
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,330
What is this?

517
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,647
It's for you. It is an early wedding present.

518
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,940
"How to Save Your Gay Marriage?"

519
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,914
Alex, still we are not married.

520
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,644
What are you trying to make us?

521
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:01,520
Prevention. I'm sure it will fabulous and perfect marriage.

522
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:05,219
Well, thanks, I guess.

523
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,887
How do I look?

524
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:11,057
- I ...
- Yes?

525
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:20,377
- What was that?
- Nena, she freaks.

526
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:23,036
That's what makes you sucking cock in the park.

527
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,512
Especially if they are large.

528
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:30,986
- What was that?
- Why ask me everything?

529
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:37,392
They have to prove my soup.
Honey, is a bomb.

530
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,326
It is my great-grandmother's recipe.

531
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,694
Damn. What?

532
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,898
The tension is so thick as the bread that made Chance.

533
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,771
- I like bread, Professor.
- Thanks, Brandon.

534
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,242
Consent of teacher.

535
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,980
Must be the Pet Store.

536
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,913
"Pet Shop?

537
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,785
Where is my friend, Noah?

538
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,446
Where is my writer?

539
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,721
- "Baby Gat?
- Is the rapper?

540
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,417
He is the protagonist
I write the movie.

541
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,186
Kind of neat.
Will you give me an autograph?

542
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,663
No, but you can stick your cock in your butt, if you want.

543
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:20,531
- Wade!
- "Baby Gat is gay? God.

544
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,366
You can not tell anyone, Brandon.

545
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,167
What does your sex life so valuable?

546
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,209
The fact that my film collapse if people find out.

547
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:30,074
Noah!

548
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,873
Yoy are not invited and you are not welcome.

549
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,076
Go back to your limousine and go to hell!

550
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,279
You mean that limo?

551
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,600
- Yes?
- Brandy, come back here.

552
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,296
Impossible, Noah.

553
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,840
Fortunately, Diddy bought a house in the vineyard ...

554
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,739
... and tonight give a great party.

555
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,879
Be late
lunch before the party.

556
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:07,609
Now, be nice to our star.
We need him for the film.

557
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,719
Chaito!

558
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,481
Damn.

559
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,921
Have mercy on the traveler Alvarado, good sir.

560
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:19,256
Do not leave me out in the cold, cold.

561
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,898
It's daylight, Curtis, and I know that one can take you ...

562
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,090
... to a hotel.

563
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,739
To an old diamond.

564
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:36,744
Curtis, you know I can not accept it.

565
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,940
Then throw it away. You know gift when something is a gift.

566
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,584
Basta!
I know what you're doing.

567
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,945
- And you leave an encouragement.
- Me? I'm doing nothing.

568
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,749
Yes you do.
I love attention.

569
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,391
Watch your body language.

570
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,459
It is not enough stamina the antics ...

571
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:51,720
... of your annoying friends.

572
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:56,765
- Wade, also are your friends.
- Not even welcome them!

573
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,611
Excuse me.

574
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,017
Sit!

575
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:28,495
Your friends do not like.
Ever they like.

576
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,566
That's not true.

577
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,635
If they disapproved,
Why be here?

578
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,964
Because you want.

579
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,902
Yes

580
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,709
I am sorry you think
my friends do not want ...

581
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,370
... much as I do. They will,
but it takes time. You know.

582
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,642
I regret that appeared Baby Gat uninvited and that despite ...

583
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:50,309
... of what I say or do, remains a flirtatious.

584
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,718
Brandy sorry ...
My boss, do not forget.

585
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,923
... has told us were getting married.

586
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:58,550
I regret that.

587
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,127
But I know ...

588
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,192
... Are you using this as an excuse to get away?

589
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,436
Will you marry me or not?

590
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,941
Because if you do not want ...

591
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,326
I will not lock you, Wade.
I love you.

592
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,472
And I want love
you feel more free.

593
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,541
For loving me means you should do certain things ...

594
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:48,200
... and accept that you are not part of certain things.

595
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:52,110
And he must fight about such things.

596
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,513
Do not you understand?
I know all that.

597
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,677
That's why I proposed marriage when we could have lived together.

598
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,187
To prove that I understand ...

599
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:04,453
... just do not need your friends if you doubt me no doubt.

600
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,064
Come on. Time to put things in place.

601
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:13,464
And Baby Gat?

602
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,634
Faced with this bitch when the time comes.

603
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,438
- Look, Curtis ...
- Baby Gat.

604
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,708
Only my friends call me Curtis.

605
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:31,412
Whatever, baby. I care only remember that this wedding.

606
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,387
- It will be remembered.
- In a good way.

607
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:39,188
Now, how do we make this no idiot ruin it?

608
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,994
I believe that you they're ruining it without my help.

609
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,691
What?
Who do you think you talking about?

610
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,803
You know nothing about me.
We can solve ...

611
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:50,270
... all this table. We set fire to this place. I tell you ...

612
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,170
Damn, my blueberry pie.

613
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,145
Look, we want Noah to be happy.

614
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,747
- They want Noah to be happy.
- Me.

615
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,680
And you're ready to go the closet to be with him?

616
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,252
- Because it is what is needed.
- We'll fix that.

617
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:05,979
I do not think well.

618
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,283
I live by my impulses, man.

619
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,859
My feelings. My heart.

620
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,657
So do not come with lectures on logic.

621
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,164
Because that's your thing, not mine.

622
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,368
I say what atemos, and metamos in the trunk ...

623
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,129
... a car until this is over.

624
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:22,932
That would be kidnapping, and Ricky ...

625
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:26,008
... you've spent a night in prison this weekend.

626
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,007
I ran out of ideas.
Anyone else?

627
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,237
What do you think?

628
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:34,407
Thrilled to see a star, I filmed everything with my cellphone ...

629
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,644
... to show my friends University.

630
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,346
I shot a Baby Gat giving flowers to Noah.

631
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,684
You know, the gay thing.

632
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,293
Could be transferred via Bluetooth YouTube easily.

633
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:48,329
Or I can save and delete after the wedding.

634
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,729
Brandon, you're a genius.

635
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,727
Holy God. What ...?

636
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,436
- Eddie?
- Leave it.

637
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,202
You have to calm down.

638
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,041
I must say ...

639
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:08,707
... what I did before was wrong, go, now I realize.

640
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:12,583
They love nothing will change.

641
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,884
I just want to be there to celebrate their union.

642
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,290
You have my word.

643
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:21,687
From brother to brother.

644
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:26,059
- Where does this?
- Feel the love, rasta, that is.

645
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,830
These guys ...

646
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,768
These guys ...

647
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:36,679
They want.

648
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,246
Both of them.

649
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:43,110
They just tell me the great couple that form.

650
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,917
Although they have a review.

651
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:50,592
What?

652
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,127
They say you're paranoid.

653
00:43:55,699 --> 00:44:00,329
They say that you trust ...

654
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:05,407
... where you want they want to Noah.

655
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:21,082
I am a man who keeps his word.

656
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,861
It is better that you, too what are you, my black.

657
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,178
Who asked for something from the Pet Store?

658
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,745
Alex!

659
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:51,979
Look.

660
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,696
When we talked last time about our dreams?

661
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,165
In college I was in a band.

662
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,464
Lead Parasol.
You said it stank.

663
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,235
Go to hell!
At least it was fun.

664
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,708
I loved playing in that band.

665
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,813
When was the last time I played a guitar?

666
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,575
When you see that trigger a midlife crisis.

667
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,040
I guess.

668
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,488
Crap.

669
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,746
Sorry.

670
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,187
Chance!

671
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,065
My God, Alex!

672
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,570
So let go and then ...

673
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,905
Do you fly?

674
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,204
Do not freeze at this time of year?

675
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,970
The perfect metaphor for the joy of marriage.

676
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,137
That's it.
Returned.

677
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,045
God! What happened?

678
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,119
- We found him unconscious.
- Careful.

679
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:00,051
Okay?

680
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,961
Still breathing. He has a good pulse.

681
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:06,994
Alex, where are they?

682
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,098
- Give me the pills.
- Do you take pills?

683
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,393
- Amphetamines or something.
- Son of herbs.

684
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:12,592
Where are ...?

685
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,794
DETAINED THE DREAM

686
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,461
Alex, not herbal.

687
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,470
They are loaded with caffeine.

688
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,439
That's why I passed out.
You're exhausted. You must sleep.

689
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,670
- But the wedding.
- Do not worry about that.

690
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:24,837
You prepared the schedule.
We will follow it.

691
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,176
- Sleep.
- Do not forget to bring your camera ...

692
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,285
... for the video of the preparation.

693
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:33,253
- I'm sorry.
- Eddie, not now.

694
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:38,457
Very well then. I guess
we all have work to do.

695
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,426
You recover.

696
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,364
What is that thing the broom?

697
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:26,066
When our ancestors were slaves were not allowed to marry ...

698
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:29,178
... legally, so they created this ritual to symbolize a wedding.

699
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:33,544
- It's a way of honoring history.
- Great.

700
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,872
I feel bad because your family is not.

701
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:19,312
Are our families or none.
We discussed it. It is my choice.

702
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:23,186
Yes, but now it's real.

703
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,991
It feels like a bad start or a bad omen.

704
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,325
Because with my family was not my choice.

705
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,330
Papo.

706
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:37,898
- Did they finish?
- Almost.

707
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:40,270
You picked the perfect time to awaken.

708
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,571
That was the plan.

709
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:48,109
The final touch.

710
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,722
Alex, are adorable.
Thank you very much.

711
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,952
- Thanks, Alex.
- Is not it nice?

712
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,926
- Look at the scarf.
- They must be hungry.

713
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,565
- You hungry?
- Very much so.

714
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,293
I'm starving. Let's eat.

715
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,799
Boys. Dinner.

716
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,800
- Great, I'm starving.
- Yes, that is.

717
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,434
Now, Noah and Wade ...

718
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,636
... before moving to their respective stag ...

719
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:19,646
... I remind you that from now on,
bride and groom ...

720
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,215
... should not be before the wedding.

721
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,046
- What?
- Why?

722
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,346
Bad luck.

723
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,684
- But do not share the bed?
- Wade can sleep in the shed.

724
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,691
Great. Well, okay.

725
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,319
Eddie, do you still take it to Wade your bachelor party?

726
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:37,058
- Yes.
- Well, and we'll do the party ...

727
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:41,102
... here at home. The jacuzzi is warming at this time.

728
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,603
- Is the hot tub?
- What about Brandon?

729
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:46,004
Brandon can celebrate with us.
'll Enter another one.

730
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,041
- It's fun.
- Yeah, like a slumber party.

731
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,909
You can come with us, Brandon.

732
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,606
Yes, sure, Mr. Macintyre.

733
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:57,753
Well. No more formal dessert.

734
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:00,287
Beginning the bachelor parties.

735
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,049
Come on!

736
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,056
- What do you call this place?
- Fos'cle.

737
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,793
Bar heterosexual bias with a bohemian twist.

738
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:16,530
- Do you have your ID, right?
- Yes, Mr. Macintyre.

739
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:20,198
Hey, Kim-Fung Choi, if you want go to that bar ...

740
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,572
Eddie and Wade ... call us.

741
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:30,879
Do you think it is okay to stop using condoms after marriage?

742
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,045
It's difficult.

743
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,386
I mean, passing clinic many young ...

744
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,393
... I ask, "Can I let him without a condom? ".

745
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:43,388
Having known the guy less than a week.

746
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:46,798
They say:
"I love it. I trust him.

747
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,733
Doing many good things for me. "

748
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:52,204
And I say, "Do you trust him? Nena you'll be sitting in a clinic ...

749
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:53,899
HIV ... feeling stupid! "

750
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,075
But not much more complicated when you talk ...

751
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:00,739
... on a long term relationship?
- You and Trey still use condoms?

752
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:04,876
We did the first five years but always did the test.

753
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:08,855
And you know that we are to meet 11 years?

754
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,523
Can you believe it?
And I never cheated.

755
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,459
That you know.

756
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,121
What about you and Eddie?

757
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,666
Still use condoms.
I think it's more hygienic.

758
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,463
Well, I think we can expect.

759
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:26,900
Maybe we review the options after years of happy monogamy.

760
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:31,104
There's that word again.
Monogamy.

761
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:34,079
With all types that are sexy ...

762
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,741
... Why do it?

763
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,979
Well, not so much monogamy itself.

764
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,090
Well ...

765
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:45,820
Wade is the man ... sexiest on the planet.

766
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:49,693
- For you.
- Yes, for me. And I got it.

767
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,765
But as you know it the sexiest if not sales ...

768
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:57,031
... and you check regularly?

769
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:01,143
You just know. Okay?

770
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,245
- I drink to that.
- Health.

771
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,903
- Bitch, okay.
- Yes?

772
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:07,879
I mean, you know, I will not lie.
I know he has wood.

773
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,109
Health, friends.

774
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:10,651
- Health.
- By Martha's Vineyard.

775
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,278
- For the wedding.
- For the wedding.

776
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:21,586
So like effeminate, right?

777
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:22,959
I mean ...

778
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,624
... Noah is not very masculine, no offense.

779
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,168
And even the teacher's Counter a little loose ...

780
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,635
... when nobody is looking.

781
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:33,902
There was nothing I sought, but when you fall in love, indeed.

782
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,375
- Yes.
- But did you ever think ...

783
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,481
... "if someone more masculine? "

784
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,344
Sometimes.

785
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,009
But femininity in a type is something funny.

786
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:46,087
You get used to and you stop noticing it.

787
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,087
Notes all things masculine.

788
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:51,694
Muscles of the face angle.

789
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,658
Then you must submit
someone ...

790
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,926
... and during this horrible time back to see everything.

791
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:01,099
Suddenly you're scared.
You think: "Who am I?

792
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:02,932
Do we really want this? "

793
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:04,971
But it forces you to confront it.

794
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:09,100
To be more courageous than you ever
been if you had the easy option.

795
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,481
I will ask another round.

796
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,511
I hope you have not offended. Me like Mr. Nicholson. It's great.

797
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:21,953
Only now I'm trying discovered homosexuality.

798
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,959
And the kids my age are so impacts on different things.

799
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:27,824
And if you walk around being sexist ...

800
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,329
... with my pants hanging from the rear ...

801
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,763
- You're a real man.
- Exactly.

802
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,596
We all have to be 50 Cent ...

803
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,432
... or if Terrell Owens not fit that mold ...

804
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,198
... not even deserve to exist.

805
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,275
You know something, man?
It is.

806
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,537
It takes a lot more value to be yourself as who you are ...

807
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:47,205
... is someone with whom many idiots ignorant have problems.

808
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:48,908
But make no mistake.

809
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,882
Noah?

810
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,284
It is ten times more brave than I ever will be.

811
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,287
But what about the thing upside down?

812
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:59,451
Do not limit a bit? Like a parody of heterosexual relationships?

813
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:04,259
- What do you mean?
- Because I'm versatile, yes?

814
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:09,599
Did you ever want Mr. Nicholson fuck you?

815
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:11,468
Who says you he have not already done?

816
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,402
Hey.

817
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,813
Baby, you're drunk, baby.

818
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:28,152
- It's not fair.
- What?

819
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,089
I do not care the family of Wade.

820
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,821
Yes, but what you do about it?

821
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,494
He forgot the phone.

822
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,363
Is it prudent?

823
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,267
I know he would love that his family was here.

824
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:46,170
What time is it?

825
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:53,606
Hello?

826
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:56,517
"Mrs. Robinson?

827
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,880
"Wade?

828
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:01,387
I'm actually Noah.

829
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:03,116
But flames my son's phone.

830
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,557
Is something wrong?
Did something happen?

831
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:08,664
No, no, no.
Everything is fine.

832
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:10,561
It's just that ...

833
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,425
This is the wedding.

834
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,366
What wedding?

835
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,096
Wade's wedding.

836
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,205
What are you talking?

837
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,105
Who speaks and how do you know my son?

838
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:24,041
And why call me at this time?

839
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,583
- No one knows.
- Oh, this is sweet.

840
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:34,986
Wade and I ...

841
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,793
- Yes?
- Wade and I were married.

842
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:41,890
I'm afraid I do not understand.

843
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,396
Wade is married.

844
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,397
Who are you, Pastor?

845
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:53,104
No, I mean ...
I have marry him.

846
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:56,541
Wade and I were married.

847
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,814
And the thing is ...

848
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:04,044
... he would you are here.

849
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,876
"" Here "?

850
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:10,016
In the house of Martha's Vineyard for the wedding ...

851
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,285
... tomorrow.

852
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:13,588
It would mean a lot to him.

853
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,388
Listen, do not know who ...

854
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,590
... and do not know why I called at midnight ...

855
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,927
... saying hateful lies.

856
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,094
But whoever it is, let alone my son!

857
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,707
- The guys forgot the key.
- Well, well, well.

858
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,872
Let no one say a word about what just happened ...

859
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:38,180
... until you think what to say to Wade.

860
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:41,947
Okay.

861
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,787
Forgot gown.

862
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,934
I like to stay.

863
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:58,596
Surprise!

864
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,643
Are we going to invite to happen?

865
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,978
Of course.

866
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,222
- Curtis!
- Your old man is not, right?

867
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:22,489
The last chance to make the wild.

868
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,155
That is what the bachelor party.

869
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,392
Get away from me.

870
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:29,232
The party was fabulous.

871
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:32,272
Baby Gat talked and talked on your scripts.

872
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:35,377
And Diddy is looking for a vehicle new to his acting career.

873
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:38,309
"I Am Legend" finds its "In Pursuit of Happiness."

874
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:40,644
Where is the toilet?

875
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:43,115
- Down on ...
- Got it!

876
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,412
Coked.

877
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:46,578
Beautiful house.

878
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,583
I wear clothes.

879
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:52,250
It does not bother me.

880
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:54,589
My God, boys ...

881
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,101
... They are Brandy and Baby Gat.
What do I do?

882
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,430
Want my advice?

883
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:04,164
Probably not, but in these circumstances themselves.

884
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,432
Sleep with Baby Gat ...

885
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,168
... but I know what the British call "bad in bed".

886
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:09,743
So lose interest.

887
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:12,677
Without principles, but psychologically effective.

888
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,714
I sleep with Baby Gat.

889
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,181
A useful suggestion, please?

890
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:18,650
Offer him a drink.

891
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:22,691
Great!
You Keep them busy here ...

892
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:27,489
... while I clear my mind and Wade will tell how ...

893
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:31,760
... I just tell his mother he's gay.

894
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:36,802
And I wear clothes.
I wear clothes.

895
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:41,967
Ricky is in love with Noah.
So nobody is attracted.

896
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:43,976
It is not against marriage.

897
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:46,479
It is against Noah to marry someone other than him.

898
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,152
That makes sense, really.

899
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,015
You know, you're pretty smart.

900
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,748
If it were so smart, have devised a way ...

901
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:58,826
... to tell my parents without completely disinherit me.

902
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:01,725
When we discover, let me know.

903
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:05,163
Wait, did not you tell your parents?

904
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:06,597
But you're getting married.

905
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:10,667
Yes, well, I guess that makes me dumber than I look.

906
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,469
Now, when I was at the party Oprah's Christmas last year ...

907
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,271
Baby, please.
You were not in Oprah's house.

908
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,008
Yes, I was.
Santa Barbara.

909
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:23,243
Is the promised land of the real estate? Does Oprah's house?

910
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,988
Back off, it will explode.

911
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,783
Tell me everything.

912
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,087
Start with the kitchen!

913
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:37,062
Yes, I'm not much into the kitchen.

914
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:38,894
Anyway, look at me O ...

915
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,298
... look at Beyonce, looks back at me ...

916
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,668
... and says:
"They could be twins."

917
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:48,768
I know.

918
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,004
- What?
- My God.

919
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,843
No, seriously, what happens?

920
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:09,028
Are you hiding from me?

921
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:12,065
I needed air.

922
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,759
What's wrong?

923
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:16,097
You tell me.

924
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,037
I had two days claustrophobic ...

925
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,975
... of fights, arguments ...

926
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:30,051
couples on the brink ...
divorce.

927
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,709
To overcome this, just ...

928
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:34,914
... to discover that the family of Wade not known he is homosexual.

929
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:38,492
If it takes you where the commitment long term, not to mention ...

930
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:43,496
... marriage,
Why do this?

931
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:47,602
How do I know?
I never aspired to marital status.

932
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,261
The old man used to wear my mother as sandbag.

933
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,169
She never left him.

934
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:56,675
Once stabbed him, but never left him.

935
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:59,337
Curtis that is horrible.

936
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:01,540
It's what I say.

937
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,413
What do you do?

938
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,986
Live free or die ...

939
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:08,487
... Noah Nehemiah Nicholson.

940
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:14,426
Live free or die.

941
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:18,158
Thanks for sharing that.

942
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,238
Curtis.

943
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,172
Curtis.

944
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:29,402
Curtis, out!

945
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:39,578
Crap.

946
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,849
Sure you'll be fine, Mr. Robinson?

947
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:44,049
I'm fine.

948
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:47,594
Sorry, guys. I did not think I had taken both.

949
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,232
There is a real farewell unless someone vomit.

950
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:52,492
I'll change clothes.

951
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,329
What's wrong with you?

952
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:56,335
Can we not have a moment no genuine attempt ...

953
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,565
... without you want to sleep with me?
- Sorry, I could not help it.

954
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:03,075
- You're too sexy.
- Come on.

955
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:06,977
You change your clothes.
You freeze.

956
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,208
Is it a hot tub?

957
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:09,612
Yes

958
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,619
I'll race you!

959
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,984
What?

960
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,168
Baby Gat, yes!

961
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,832
Curtis!

962
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:35,233
Nobody can beat me!

963
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:41,573
Do you realize you're naked and it's very cold?

964
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,378
You know you're crazy?
You're completely crazy.

965
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:46,454
I'm crazy about you!
Come on!

966
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:49,250
You exit the tub.
No, salt.

967
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:51,757
Simply, no!

968
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,919
What about Curtis?

969
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,290
Stupid.

970
01:03:55,464 --> 01:04:01,369
As you take off your clothes.

971
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:05,966
That means you have to know Diana.

972
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:07,837
I say, Miss Ross.

973
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,069
Her son Evan and I are almost best friends.

974
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:12,737
Her acting career is also rising.

975
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:15,008
Tell me you saw him in "ATL".

976
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,446
Sure, bitch.

977
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:21,249
He is young but is well!

978
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:22,755
Yeah, baby, you can get.

979
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:25,086
Seriously, bitch.

980
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:27,923
Who would you say bitch?

981
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,559
I thought you seriously angry.

982
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:37,433
That is not the problem.

983
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:38,835
You love me.

984
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:41,135
No, no ...

985
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,470
... I love you.

986
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:44,044
I love Wade.

987
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,681
Your mouth says Wade but your penis says Curtis.

988
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,051
No, not so.

989
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:55,652
What the hell, guys?

990
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:58,817
What?

991
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:00,284
Wade, just ...

992
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,833
Wade!

993
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:06,593
Wade!

994
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:09,567
Let him go.

995
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,764
Film or no film ...

996
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:13,408
... if you ruin my wedding, I swear ...

997
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,306
... by God I'll kill you!

998
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:17,605
Wade!

999
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,941
Ricky, Ricky.
Go after him.

1000
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:21,743
Make sure he doesn't something crazy.

1001
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,180
Why not?

1002
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:25,513
You did.

1003
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:29,351
Please?

1004
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:33,984
Come to papa. What?

1005
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:42,064
You are.

1006
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:04,183
I saw what happened there.

1007
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,760
Are you okay?

1008
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:09,090
You are?

1009
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,790
You love him, right?

1010
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:29,041
But he loves you.

1011
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:30,617
Yes?

1012
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:39,989
Between you and me ...

1013
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:44,155
I always wondered ... what all the fuss.

1014
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:50,297
What do you that makes him so crazy?

1015
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:54,941
Well ...

1016
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:58,171
Between you and me, I always ...

1017
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:02,306
I wondered why ... fuss over you.

1018
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:05,921
Why no one rejects you?

1019
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:10,081
Not even Arthur.

1020
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:12,420
Yes?

1021
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,264
Yes

1022
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:41,314
Shit! Noah!

1023
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:42,582
Noah!

1024
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:45,727
Noah!

1025
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:50,298
If I have to listen to a story Celebrity banal more ...

1026
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:55,665
... I will cut my own eardrums.

1027
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:58,170
You want wine?

1028
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,331
I want a divorce.

1029
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:10,141
Do you want to slap and ...

1030
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,787
... divorce?

1031
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,719
We are not happy, and you know it.

1032
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:20,760
It's over.

1033
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:25,833
What, no reply hurtful?

1034
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:31,071
I'm too drunk.

1035
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:36,439
We should talk about this when we're sober.

1036
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:37,943
Enough, Chance.

1037
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,911
We failed.

1038
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:43,176
Failure is an most basic freedoms.

1039
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:44,416
Enough!

1040
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,524
"Chance?

1041
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:14,541
Oh, O.J. It's so cute.

1042
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:18,744
Is not it? And love
Mama Alex.

1043
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:22,755
Sometimes I think Trey is a little jealous of our relationship.

1044
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:25,450
Is that Trey?

1045
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:26,925
Wow, that's nice.

1046
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:30,554
I know your big bum should be maltratandote.

1047
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:33,566
And it makes me feel as a real woman.

1048
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:36,398
- A W, O, M, A ,N.
- W, O, M, A, N..

1049
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:42,809
Noah!

1050
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:44,946
Noah!

1051
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:46,376
It is bad luck for the newlyweds ...

1052
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:48,847
... be before the wedding!

1053
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,578
Yes

1054
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:52,948
Noah!

1055
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:54,680
Noah, is not what you think.

1056
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:59,651
Nene. Nene, opens the door.
Nene, please.

1057
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:03,056
Let's talk. Noah!

1058
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:06,201
Noah, please, baby. Come on.

1059
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,858
Noah.

1060
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,670
Damn!

1061
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:22,143
HOW TO SAVE YOUR GAY MARRIAGE

1062
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,582
God, the food ...

1063
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,089
... it looks great.

1064
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:41,195
And the cake.

1065
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:44,025
What, Alex?

1066
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,962
It is the cake.

1067
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:49,536
It's perfect.

1068
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:53,133
I was trying to ...

1069
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:58,076
... see me happy, but I can not lie.

1070
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:00,977
"How to Save Your Gay Marriage. "

1071
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,811
It was not for Wade and me, right?

1072
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,919
Baby, my marriage is a disaster.

1073
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:08,147
I wondered why had highlighted many passages.

1074
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,758
But I thought things were going well between you.

1075
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:12,791
The clinic recently received that great benefit.

1076
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:14,929
- Adopt O.J.
- I know.

1077
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:17,998
I guess I should be grateful.

1078
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:22,297
But Trey and I, we go crazy.

1079
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,530
We are together 24 hours.

1080
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,608
But most of the time is in the clinic or watching the baby.

1081
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:29,676
A couple of months they have it.

1082
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,507
They must get used to being parents.
Things are better.

1083
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,946
Not only that.

1084
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:39,144
Trey is more passive.
I'm more dominant.

1085
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:40,879
And sometimes I hear the way ...

1086
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:46,221
... in which I talk and see his face, and it's like ...

1087
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:48,795
... I can not stop I'm doing.

1088
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:51,728
Well, "identify the problem is the first step ...

1089
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,492
... to solve it. "

1090
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:56,433
The problem is that I'm the boyfriend from hell.

1091
01:12:56,605 --> 01:13:00,041
And the solution is that it should me on the street.

1092
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,700
But you know Trey loves you,
Right?

1093
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,072
That sounds more convincing ...

1094
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:07,613
... as a solution when
you get married.

1095
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:12,311
But after 10 years ...

1096
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:14,786
... need something more than love to save the marriage.

1097
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,619
But if love does not save ...

1098
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:21,024
... What can you do?

1099
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:23,664
You do not think worth saving?

1100
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:30,763
Do you think he cares?

1101
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:32,873
Clearly.

1102
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,008
Thank you.

1103
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,349
Take this.

1104
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:57,728
Forget it.

1105
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,571
Chance.

1106
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:10,701
Chance.

1107
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,278
What time is it?

1108
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,042
Time to decide what you really want.

1109
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,879
Eddie was asleep all night.

1110
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,521
If you upload now ...

1111
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,281
... never know.

1112
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,859
I know, because I will tell.

1113
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:28,656
It's my husband.
I owe the truth.

1114
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,160
Brandon.

1115
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:37,532
Brandon.

1116
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:39,298
Wake up.

1117
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,875
Time to go to bed.

1118
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:05,823
Move.

1119
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,231
Are you okay?

1120
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:11,702
The wedding party appears have become a divorce.

1121
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,307
Even Wade and myself.

1122
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:16,501
Come here.

1123
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,248
Sorry I could not rewrite the script.

1124
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,248
Do not worry about that.

1125
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,751
- I'll get a.
- Really?

1126
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:28,446
Talk to your boss.

1127
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:30,421
I heard he is a real bitch ...

1128
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:32,583
... but I can handle it.

1129
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:36,492
Now listen, the script is life, Noah.

1130
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:39,099
You're the writer of your own life.

1131
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:42,669
It's time to take control.

1132
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:46,706
Time to take control.

1133
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:52,336
Thanks, Brandy.

1134
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:57,816
I need a joint.

1135
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:12,963
This can not happen again.

1136
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:15,865
Bad boundaries.

1137
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:18,336
But thanks.

1138
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,631
In the kitchen.

1139
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,763
And honey, tell your daddy ...

1140
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:56,900
... Trey knows that Daddy Alex which may be a fool.

1141
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:59,980
And it promises to ...

1142
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:03,015
... attempt to close the mouth ...

1143
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:08,521
... and open your ears and listen.

1144
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:11,757
He just wants the opportunity.

1145
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:17,661
Do you think Alex deserves papi an opportunity?

1146
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:22,099
Do you have to ask?

1147
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:25,706
Well, I know you want me back home ...

1148
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:27,637
... because you know I'm hungry.

1149
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,504
I have something for you.

1150
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:34,206
Let me raise the music.

1151
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:08,110
I'm sorry, okay?

1152
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:09,511
My fault.

1153
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,586
I mean, I started.

1154
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:15,052
Why?

1155
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:19,284
Because ...

1156
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,190
I do not understand.

1157
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,354
Why is my best friend would feel ...

1158
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,864
... the need to add my boyfriend the parade of trophies ...

1159
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,763
... which brought the weekend?

1160
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:29,403
The student, the gardener ...

1161
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:31,937
... the stranger in the park, the police said.

1162
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:35,042
- I did with the police.
- What?

1163
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,542
I felt humiliated ...

1164
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,476
... after I was arrested.

1165
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:41,479
So I lied that the tragedy ...

1166
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,083
... seems a win.

1167
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:44,775
The guy sexy in the woods ...

1168
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:45,977
... was a repressed married ...

1169
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:48,816
... did not know how make a good puff.

1170
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,821
Arthur was just an adventure.

1171
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:53,722
And Brandon is a child.

1172
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:55,362
A child appealing, but being with him ...

1173
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:58,090
... makes me feel middle-aged and outmoded.

1174
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:00,598
But with Wade ...

1175
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:02,202
... I needed to know why.

1176
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:05,463
- Why that?
- Why him?

1177
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,438
What's so great?

1178
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,441
What is the magical, special ...

1179
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:15,948
... wonderful, amazing that has him ...

1180
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:18,211
... I do not?

1181
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:26,851
- You mean ...?
- I love you.

1182
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:30,828
Not as a friend, or friend.

1183
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:32,523
More than that.

1184
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:35,568
And every man seems trivial compared.

1185
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:36,999
They are just bodies.

1186
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:39,936
I love you.

1187
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:42,201
And the words burn my mouth ...

1188
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:44,311
... because I know you do not love me.

1189
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:48,108
- Ricky ...
- Not like that, I know.

1190
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,513
It is my burden.

1191
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:53,677
And sorry if sometimes makes me act like a fool.

1192
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,720
But one thing I do know.

1193
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:01,418
What?

1194
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:08,869
You always take care.

1195
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:11,801
Always.

1196
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:19,046
And I know otherwise.

1197
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:26,050
You love Wade.

1198
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:39,258
Thank you.

1199
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:47,272
So what you waiting for?

1200
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:15,568
Sorry.

1201
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,204
I'm sorry too.

1202
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:20,705
You know, nothing happened.
Only a drunken kiss.

1203
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,935
The same with Baby Gat.

1204
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:25,341
Less than a kiss.

1205
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,589
Are we doing the right thing?
Are we taking it ...

1206
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:42,889
... seriously enough?

1207
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:44,895
"Until death do us part?

1208
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:47,967
"Forgetting all others?

1209
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,468
We can only try, Wade.

1210
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,903
But I want to try.

1211
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,941
Really.

1212
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,477
Do you?

1213
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:00,877
Sure.

1214
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,049
Going to change.

1215
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:15,026
I have to save three more relations before it reaches the minister.

1216
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:17,528
Show me the path.

1217
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,263
Where's the cream?

1218
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,907
I got your cream.

1219
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:29,475
Shut up.

1220
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:38,511
Sorry about last night.

1221
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:41,781
Can we forget?

1222
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,534
Do not look to me, brother.

1223
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:58,605
I swallowed so many pills I do not know what happened last night.

1224
01:22:58,773 --> 01:23:00,297
Well.

1225
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:06,736
Can you help me with my hair?

1226
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:08,246
Yes

1227
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,974
First let me go to see Brandon.

1228
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:20,150
You're not really remember?

1229
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,665
Because I do not.

1230
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,737
Hello.

1231
01:23:30,905 --> 01:23:32,930
Hello, sir ...

1232
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:34,803
... Noah.

1233
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:38,207
Are you okay?
Did you hear your parents?

1234
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:41,178
Not a word.

1235
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:47,452
Well, maybe that will take them ...

1236
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:51,956
... time, but they will understand.

1237
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:54,220
What if they do not?

1238
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:56,626
What will I do?

1239
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:58,288
I mean, I live in the university ...

1240
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:04,098
... during the year, but what about summer vacation?

1241
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:06,365
Listen, whatever ...

1242
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:08,065
... what happens to your family ...

1243
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:10,609
... you always have a place to go.

1244
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:13,805
With Wade and me
and Chance and Eddie, or Ricky.

1245
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:17,110
Ricky?

1246
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:18,445
It may take time ...

1247
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:22,056
... but he always does right at the end.

1248
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,350
Come on.

1249
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:36,629
Why would you do that for me?

1250
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:41,469
For now ...

1251
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:46,239
... you are also part of our family.

1252
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,939
Now I take a shower.

1253
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:51,142
But you look cute.

1254
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,026
For me, the life of the mind always comes first.

1255
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:02,459
I can not be happy if not.

1256
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:05,758
But I'll never love anyone ...

1257
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,095
... as much as you.

1258
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:09,964
I do not want a life with anyone ...

1259
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:11,730
... except you.

1260
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:13,373
And give you all the love ...

1261
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:17,602
... I have to give another human being.

1262
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:19,679
Can we make a promise?

1263
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,679
"Make what we have among us ...

1264
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:23,784
... in an adventure?

1265
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,351
Say yes to everything ...

1266
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,181
... the remarkable and surprising?

1267
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:29,118
Always be rebuilding the temple.

1268
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,281
Always be reconstructed the temple.

1269
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,120
T.S. Eliot.

1270
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:39,659
I slept with Brandon.

1271
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:49,071
I know.

1272
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:52,475
I missed you.

1273
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:55,980
As you should have.

1274
01:25:56,151 --> 01:26:00,884
By the way, the answer is yes.

1275
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:03,182
What is the question?

1276
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,724
Do you forgive?

1277
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,027
Should we start?

1278
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,194
A minute.

1279
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:53,636
But it's cold.
The guests are frozen.

1280
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:56,299
One more.

1281
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,860
My God.

1282
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:16,326
We, ma'am.
Watch your step.

1283
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:20,228
Mommy?

1284
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:23,029
You look so beautiful.

1285
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:31,370
Mami.

1286
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:33,673
I can not believe you left married without me.

1287
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:36,749
I wanted you to be here, but did not want Wade to feel bad.

1288
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:40,651
Well, at least had common sense ...

1289
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:44,690
... to invite us but his parents could not come.

1290
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:47,054
- Yes
- I love you.

1291
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:49,355
Your dad wanted to come, but had to leave ...

1292
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:51,589
... to see his mother.
- Grandma? Okay?

1293
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:54,166
He fell, hurt his hip.
Old drunk.

1294
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:55,666
- Mom!
- Okay.

1295
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:57,202
But I wanted to tell you ...

1296
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:59,169
... we'll
a great ...

1297
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,570
... reception in Los Angeles when you return.

1298
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:04,803
- Great.
- Where am I?

1299
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:06,537
You can sit here.

1300
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:08,045
No, not fair.

1301
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:10,582
Sit.

1302
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,242
What now?

1303
01:28:14,922 --> 01:28:16,981
No idea.

1304
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:25,560
It's my mom.

1305
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:27,064
Crap.

1306
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:35,104
Baby, this is worse than an episode of "Jerry Springer".

1307
01:28:35,276 --> 01:28:36,607
"Maury Povich.

1308
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:38,067
Oh, baby.

1309
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,845
Mom?

1310
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:45,815
Wade.

1311
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:47,682
Mom, Mom, this is ...

1312
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:49,584
... Noah.

1313
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:51,019
Do you know?

1314
01:28:51,192 --> 01:28:52,784
Noah and I had a conversation ...

1315
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,327
very interesting last night ... at 1:30 in the morning.

1316
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:58,863
Sorry. I was going to tell you.

1317
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:01,934
We were drunk, and I felt bad that your family was not here.

1318
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:04,298
- I had no idea that they do not ...
- Okay.

1319
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:06,406
I'm glad to be known.

1320
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:09,065
Wade, would you explain ...

1321
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:11,268
obvious why ... tell me ...

1322
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:15,507
... you're not alone gay ...

1323
01:29:16,818 --> 01:29:18,217
... but you were going to marry ...

1324
01:29:18,386 --> 01:29:21,480
... with your male lover in our holiday home?

1325
01:29:21,656 --> 01:29:24,124
I wanted to.
I tried many times.

1326
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:26,089
But how could the way I grew up?

1327
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:30,162
It would be easier to tell I'm a serial murderer.

1328
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:34,028
Wade, you're my son.

1329
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,227
And though it may not be ...

1330
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:40,363
... the life you I have chosen for you, I know from experience ...

1331
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:43,772
... that sexuality is not a choice.

1332
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:45,469
Whatever you say ...

1333
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:48,979
... your father and these evangelists in church.

1334
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:52,449
"Then you accept it?

1335
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,315
Because if not ...

1336
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:57,253
... you can come back and go home.

1337
01:29:57,425 --> 01:30:00,588
Noah and I have lived many things to let you ...

1338
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:02,127
... or else we will ruin this day.

1339
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:06,232
Well, then someone I paid the driver.

1340
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:07,425
I'll pay.

1341
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:10,935
- There he goes.
- It's the least I can do.

1342
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:22,281
I'm sorry your father can not be.

1343
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:25,647
Can not or will not?

1344
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:27,378
I'm here.

1345
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:35,622
- Step by Step.
- Step by Step.

1346
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:38,095
Sit.

1347
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:40,097
I tell him his son ...

1348
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:42,828
... is getting married with a wonderful human being.

1349
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:45,472
The catch her in a minute, but you know ...

1350
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,733
A beautiful girl like you not married?

1351
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:49,877
You're a lesbian. Sorry.

1352
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:51,375
Baby, I hope not.

1353
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:52,979
I like penis.

1354
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:54,307
- Strictly!
- Strictly!

1355
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:01,246
The first time I saw you ...

1356
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:04,050
... was not love at first sight.

1357
01:31:04,225 --> 01:31:06,216
You were interesting ...

1358
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:08,055
... fascinating, remarkable ...

1359
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:10,561
... but you were a man.

1360
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:12,096
When I started to feel ...

1361
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:13,790
... things you did not know ...

1362
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:16,436
... what was it ...

1363
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:18,697
... you were a man.

1364
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:23,276
When I told you first that I loved you, trembling, full ...

1365
01:31:23,444 --> 01:31:26,675
... of fear that just could not breathe, I could see ...

1366
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,406
... doubt in your eyes.

1367
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:31,245
I could feel your fear.

1368
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:34,946
And when ...

1369
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:38,990
Well, words are just words.

1370
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:42,994
And talk is free.

1371
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:46,065
I asked you to marry me because ...

1372
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:49,294
... marriage is a fact.

1373
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:52,234
I asked you to marry me here ...

1374
01:31:52,406 --> 01:31:57,002
... in my family's house to show you ...

1375
01:31:57,178 --> 01:32:00,147
... that I am not ashamed ...

1376
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:02,282
... join our names ...

1377
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:04,281
... before the whole world, that ...

1378
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:09,685
... everyone suits us and our love.

1379
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:12,348
And in front of your friends ...

1380
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,552
... who want to learn ...

1381
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:16,026
... because you want them.

1382
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:18,290
And because they love you to you.

1383
01:32:18,466 --> 01:32:22,300
All I did for you.

1384
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:28,403
And all this will do for us.

1385
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:32,542
I will be brave.

1386
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:35,443
Tolerant.

1387
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:38,744
I'll be loving.

1388
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,047
I will be kind.

1389
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:43,053
I'll take everything you tremble ...

1390
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,658
... and I will place within you ...

1391
01:32:45,826 --> 01:32:48,818
... safely
in the palm of my hand.

1392
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:52,898
Forever.

1393
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,001
Are you crying?

1394
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:02,840
The first time I saw you ...

1395
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:05,604
... was not love at first sight.

1396
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:07,509
You were interesting ...

1397
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:11,778
... fascinating, remarkable ...

1398
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:13,784
... but you were heterosexual.

1399
01:33:13,955 --> 01:33:16,355
Or so he thought.

1400
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:18,116
Or so you thought.

1401
01:33:20,494 --> 01:33:23,463
But my love for you grew in silence ...

1402
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:24,928
... from the corner of my eye ...

1403
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:30,332
... drained by the time and tears ...

1404
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,870
... and kisses.

1405
01:33:35,142 --> 01:33:37,736
I knew that I loved when ...

1406
01:33:37,912 --> 01:33:39,743
... to see through me ...

1407
01:33:39,914 --> 01:33:42,508
... a fear and a desire in excess of lust.

1408
01:33:42,683 --> 01:33:45,743
When I wanted to give the world and receive nothing ...

1409
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:49,651
... more for your smile.

1410
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:52,759
And that'll do it for you.

1411
01:33:52,927 --> 01:33:56,624
And this will do for us.

1412
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:59,994
Be polite.

1413
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:02,965
Be honest.

1414
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,196
Be brave.

1415
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:07,773
Be truthful.

1416
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:11,378
I will be your port in a storm ...

1417
01:34:11,545 --> 01:34:14,275
... and your shield in battle.

1418
01:34:14,448 --> 01:34:16,245
And when the time comes ...

1419
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:18,783
... to go to old home of the ancestors ...

1420
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:23,755
... dance with you there.

1421
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:31,489
And now, with power ...

1422
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:34,396
... that gives me the commonwealth ...

1423
01:34:34,568 --> 01:34:36,934
... Massachusetts ...

1424
01:34:37,104 --> 01:34:40,198
pronounce you man ... ...

1425
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:42,069
... and husband.

1426
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:45,679
Sealed with a kiss.

1427
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:21,047
Yes!

1428
01:37:25,873 --> 01:37:27,670
Shall we dance?
