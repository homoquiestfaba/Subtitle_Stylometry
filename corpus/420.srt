1
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:10,753
<i>Attention. Please prepare
for docking procedure.</i>

2
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,493
<i>There's a package for you,
Miss Perkins.</i>

3
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,502
They didn't leave a name.

4
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,608
- Said it was important.
- Thank you.

5
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,308
I don't like this business
you're getting yourself into.

6
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,211
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley.
You know what a careful girl I am.

7
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,447
I move my mouth, words come out,
you don't hear.

8
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:31,296
- I'm late for a movie.
- I don't like it when you smile at me.

9
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,124
You don't like my smile?

10
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,698
I don't like what's behind it.

11
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,763
Listen, Polly, six scientists are missing,
probably dead.

12
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,841
Somebody out there means business.
I don't want you in the middle of it.

13
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,213
It's only a movie, Mr. Paley.

14
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,147
I'll bring you some popcorn.

15
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,081
<i>Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.</i>

16
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,921
<i>We must be over the rainbow.</i>

17
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,025
You sent me this?

18
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,766
Who are you?

19
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,941
- What's this all about, Mr...?
- Doctor.

20
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,045
Dr. Walter Jennings.
I'm a research chemist.

21
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,545
I specialize in nucleic-acid emissions.

22
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,843
The bonding enzymes
in proteus molecules which...

23
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,646
The missing scientists.
You said you knew who was next.

24
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,124
Yes, l...

25
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,454
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.

26
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,988
I was one of seven scientists
chosen to serve in a secret facility

27
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,261
stationed outside of Berlin
before the start of the First World War.

28
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,999
<i>It was known only as Einheit Elf,
"Unit 11."</i>

29
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,576
We agreed never to discuss
what went on behind those doors.

30
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,839
The things we were made
to do there...

31
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,141
Terrible things.

32
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,546
<i>- I shouldn't have come.
- Now I know we're not in Kansas.</i>

33
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,250
<i>Are you a good witch
or a bad witch?</i>

34
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,326
Doctor, you said you knew
who was next.

35
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,225
Yes.

36
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,158
Don't you see?

37
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:25,163
- There is only one left.
- Who? Who is it, doctor?

38
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,971
Me.

39
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,873
He's coming for me.

40
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,838
Who? Who's coming?

41
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,342
Totenkopf.

42
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,744
It's Totenkopf.

43
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,570
There!

44
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,242
<i>All citizens, attention.</i>

45
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,354
<i>New York City
must be evacuated at once.</i>

46
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,890
<i>Proceed in an orderly manner
to the East River Drive.</i>

47
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,859
<i>All members of the police and fire
department on leave or off duty</i>

48
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,591
<i>shall report immediately to their
precincts or company command.</i>

49
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,200
<i>This is urgent.</i>

50
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,604
<i>- Editor Paley.
- Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.</i>

51
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,007
What's going on? They're calling
for midtown to evacuate.

52
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,943
<i>Listen, Mr. Paley,
I don't have much time.</i>

53
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,950
I need you to dig up anything you can
on a Dr. Walter Jennings

54
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,451
and someone named Totenkopf.

55
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,590
An address, a phone number,
anything you can find. It's important.

56
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,657
Totenkopf. Who is he?

57
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,623
<i>He may have something to do
with the missing scientists.</i>

58
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,490
Quick as you can.

59
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,825
Polly, listen to me.
I want you to get out of there.

60
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,126
I want you to put the phone down,
close your notepad

61
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,633
and get the hell out of there.

62
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,464
Wait a minute.

63
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,576
I can see something now coming
into sight above the Palisades.

64
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,510
They're crossing Sixth Avenue.

65
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,842
Fifth Avenue.

66
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,382
They're a hundred...
They're a hundred yards away.

67
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,747
Polly. Polly!

68
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,484
Oh, my God.

69
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:26,988
Polly!

70
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,160
Polly!

71
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,161
<i>Polly!</i>

72
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,457
Stop! Come back!

73
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,469
Fire!

74
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,672
Get out of here!

75
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,613
They've broken through the perimeter.
Send reinforcements.

76
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:27,808
Send everything you've got!

77
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,682
Emergency protocol 90206. Calling
Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.

78
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,384
<i>Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

79
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,827
<i>This is an emergency
protocol, 90206.</i>

80
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,523
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?</i>

81
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,295
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

82
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,132
<i>This is an emergency
protocol, 90206.</i>

83
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,673
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?</i>

84
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,939
<i>Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

85
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,584
This is Sky Captain. I'm on my way.

86
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,326
Polly.

87
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,131
Joe.

88
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,341
<i>Further details of the attack
continue to pour in.</i>

89
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,741
<i>The central portion of the city is
blacked out from radio communication</i>

90
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,544
<i>due to damaged power lines
and electrical failure.</i>

91
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,653
<i>Cables received from English, French
and German news agencies</i>

92
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,086
<i>now confirm the attack
was not limited to the city.</i>

93
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,489
<i>The BBC is reporting
that a steel mill in Nuremberg</i>

94
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,061
<i>was virtually excavated</i>

95
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,893
<i>by what witnesses describe
as a mechanized tornado.</i>

96
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:13,231
<i>News agencies in Paris and Madrid
speak of strange burrowing machines</i>

97
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,667
<i>rising from the ground,</i>

98
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:18,707
<i>robbing entire communities
of their coal and oil reserves.</i>

99
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,009
<i>Meanwhile, with military resources
stretched thin across the globe,</i>

100
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,206
<i>world leaders
must once again call upon</i>

101
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:29,319
<i>the elite mercenary forces
of Sky Captain and his army-for-hire</i>

102
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:33,958
<i>to uncover the meaning
of these mysterious events.</i>

103
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,742
Where's Dex?

104
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,252
Shazam.

105
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:33,206
I thought you said this thing was big.
Can I have it?

106
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:37,546
You find out where it came from,
and I'll buy you one for Christmas.

107
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,851
Oh, I need to show you something.

108
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,312
I recorded this signal just before
the first machine appeared.

109
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,558
I didn't think anything of it
until I played it back.

110
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,896
- Morse code?
- See, that's what I thought at first,

111
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,827
but the syntax
is more complex than that.

112
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,524
There's a sub-carrier hidden
in the lower frequency.

113
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,795
I think it's being used
to control them.

114
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,666
If it shows up again,
could you track it?

115
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,473
I can try, yeah.

116
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,972
- Good boy, Dex.
- Thanks.

117
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,704
In the meantime,
see what you can do with that thing.

118
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,246
Find out what makes it tick.

119
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,218
- You don't mind, do you?
- I don't mind.

120
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,518
I wanna know where it comes from,
Dex. Who sent it here.

121
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:29,398
<i>Switch to map coordinate
69 SW by 49 E.</i>

122
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,387
Tummy ache?

123
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,830
How you been, Joe?

124
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,000
- Miss me?
- Get out.

125
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,566
Well, it's nice to see you too.

126
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,236
Dex said you might be in a mood.

127
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,809
Dex?

128
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,377
Get in here!

129
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,712
It's been three years, Joe.
You're not still mad at me, are you?

130
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,750
Can't even remember
what we were fighting about.

131
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,547
You sabotaged my plane.

132
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,554
Right.

133
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,196
I spent six months in a Manchurian
slave camp because of you.

134
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,130
- They were gonna cut off my fingers.
- Joe,

135
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:39,002
for the last time, I didn't sabotage
your damn airplane.

136
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,367
All so you could get a photograph
of Tojo Hideki

137
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,132
in his bathrobe, remember?

138
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,708
You know, I'm starting to think

139
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,879
that you've invented
this whole sabotage nonsense

140
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,207
to cover the fact that
you were running around on me

141
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,975
with your little mystery girl
the whole time we were in Nanjing.

142
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,380
Never happened.
All in your imagination.

143
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,578
Who was she, Joe?

144
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,347
- What was her name?
- That's enough.

145
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,049
What are you gonna do?

146
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:04,926
Shoot me?

147
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,499
Oh, great. We all made up.

148
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,936
It's been a pleasure, Polly.

149
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:16,164
Let's do it again in ten years.
Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.

150
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,206
If she resists, shoot her.

151
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,741
- Hi, Polly.
- Hi, Dex.

152
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,038
- I gotta...
- It's okay, hon, I know.

153
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,714
Okay.

154
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:28,352
It's just as well. I guess you wouldn't
have been interested in this, anyway.

155
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,923
- Where did you get that?
- There's more where this came from.

156
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,955
Lots more.

157
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:42,266
- I want that blueprint, Polly.
- I want this story, Joe.

158
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,765
And you're gonna help me get it.

159
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,802
Maybe we should show her, Cap.
Maybe she can help.

160
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,834
Show me what?

161
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,481
Show me what?

162
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,024
My God. What is this?

163
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,960
Where do they come from?

164
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:20,533
They started appearing three years ago
in remote areas.

165
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,401
We managed to keep it a secret
until now.

166
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,267
They show up without warning,
they take what they need,

167
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,844
and then they disappear
without a trace.

168
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,205
Three years and we still can't explain
what they want

169
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,849
or who's sending them here.

170
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,679
A man came to see me today,
a scientist.

171
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:39,084
He was terrified.
Said someone was coming for him.

172
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,556
I asked him who he was so afraid of,
and he repeated one name:

173
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,251
Totenkopf.

174
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,328
He nearly went white
when he said it.

175
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,795
Totenkopf, who is he?

176
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,366
He's the invisible man.

177
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,131
I've been through every library record
twice looking for anything.

178
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,605
I've called every contact I have
from Paris to Bangkok.

179
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,505
This is the only thing I could dig up.

180
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,879
He ran some kind of secret
science unit outside of Berlin

181
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,847
before the start of World War I.

182
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,214
Something called Unit 11.

183
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,550
It's been more than 30 years
since anyone has spoken his name.

184
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,824
Until today.

185
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,996
Note the insignia he used
for the unit.

186
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,461
It matches the markings
on all of these machines.

187
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,731
The scientist, where is he now?

188
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,536
We're in this together, right, Joe?

189
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,873
Nothing gets published until I say so.
You don't write a sentence

190
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,711
or take a photograph without
asking me first. Understood?

191
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,250
Understood.

192
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,060
What?

193
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,662
I missed you.

194
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,101
Thanks for saving my life today,
by the way.

195
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,845
Were you down there?

196
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,812
You missed me too. How nice.

197
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,354
This is it. This is Jennings' lab.

198
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:33,063
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.

199
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,837
Dr. Jennings!

200
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,771
It's locked.

201
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,608
That window there.

202
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,886
I may be able to get in
through that window

203
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,079
if I can attach a line...

204
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:57,786
It's open.

205
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,475
We're too late.
Someone beat us here.

206
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,458
All right, Polly...

207
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,391
...no more games.
What the hell is going on?

208
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,224
I was hoping you could tell me.

209
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,835
Dr. Jennings!

210
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,973
You must stop him!

211
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,972
Stay here.

212
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,715
Stop!

213
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,319
I don't wanna hurt you.

214
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,987
- Miss Perkins.
- I'm here, doctor.

215
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,654
- I'm going to get you some help.
- You must promise.

216
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,595
If Totenkopf finds them,
the countdown will begin.

217
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,364
- This world shall end.
- I don't understand, doctor. Find what?

218
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:23,563
Promise.

219
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:40,982
He's dead.

220
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,188
I think I found something.

221
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,964
Dr. Jennings had this with him
this morning at the theater.

222
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,466
- I'd better get back to the base.
- I'm coming with you.

223
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,111
Of course you are.

224
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,391
Reconnaissance picked up something
on radar traveling at over 500 knots

225
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:21,792
and coming straight for us.

226
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,992
- How long before they reach us?
- There!

227
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,035
Get my plane ready. I'm going up.

228
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,369
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

229
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,309
Don't be stupid. Remember what
happened last time you flew with me?

230
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,415
- We had a deal.
- This is not a game, Polly.

231
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,847
- People are gonna die.
- You are not leaving me, Joe.

232
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,385
Not this time. This is my story,
and we had a deal!

233
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,556
Go, go, go!

234
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,294
Get in.

235
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,674
There you are.

236
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,588
- Cap, this is Dex, do you read me?
- Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.

237
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,021
Come in, Dex.

238
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,502
Look, whatever you do, don't shoot!

239
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,373
- Okay.
- You shot it, didn't you?

240
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,341
<i>- Yes.
- Listen, Cap,</i>

241
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,841
the signal's coming
from one of those machines.

242
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,205
You gotta keep them
in one piece.

243
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,906
Which machine is it, Dex?

244
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,081
<i>There's no way of telling.
It could be any one of them.</i>

245
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,116
I think I found it, Dex.

246
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,797
- Wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal.
- It's heading for the city.

247
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,495
Don't let it get away. I need you
to bounce that signal back to me.

248
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,140
If we lose it now,
we may never get it back.

249
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,544
You let me know when
you've got something, Dex.

250
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,041
<i>I'll let you know. Out.</i>

251
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,088
All right, I want a full-spectrum sweep
of every incoming signal.

252
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,724
Amplify any variant frequency cycle
and route them to me.

253
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,432
They've come back
for the generators.

254
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,601
Who is this guy?

255
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,649
- You okay?
- Great.

256
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,447
There's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia
under the seat if you need it.

257
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,954
- I'm fine.
- You don't look so good.

258
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,250
Pull up!

259
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,101
- Joe!
- I see it!

260
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,215
It's getting away.

261
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:04,478
- I lost the signal, Cap.
- I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.

262
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,122
- Go left.
- Sit back, Polly.

263
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:14,628
There's a shortcut down Broadway.
You can catch him on 42nd Street.

264
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,266
I know these streets like the back
of my hand. Go left!

265
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,267
Hey!

266
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,875
Okay, okay, now go straight.

267
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,144
- No, no, no, go right!
- When?

268
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,486
Back there.

269
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,432
I could use a little more warning
next time.

270
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,601
Go left!

271
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,775
Tell me you got something, Dex.

272
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,807
<i>We're getting clobbered up here.</i>

273
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,505
It's no picnic down here either, Cap.
Hang in there, I've almost got it.

274
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,051
Joe!

275
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,696
Dex! We can't hold them off
any longer!

276
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,598
- I'm almost there.
- We have to evacuate now!

277
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,864
Go ahead without me.
I'm right behind you.

278
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,572
- Lovely.
- Okay, turn left at the drugstore.

279
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,840
- Left again.
- We're going around in circles.

280
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,247
Will you just trust me? Go left!

281
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,161
- It's a dead end.
- That's not supposed to be there.

282
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,329
It's a dead end!

283
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:56,922
There's no way out!

284
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,636
Oh, bugger.

285
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,406
Joe!

286
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:34,027
- There's the lead ship.
- Shortcut!

287
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:35,900
I got us here, didn't I?

288
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,276
- Dex. Dex!
- Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.

289
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,245
- Thirty seconds.
- Plus or minus.

290
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:50,410
Listen, I'll try and take them out over
the water, buy us some time. Over.

291
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,390
Still glad you came?

292
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,774
Joe, I found it! Joe!

293
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,272
<i>Dex, come in. Where is it?</i>

294
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,815
<i>Come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?</i>

295
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,489
<i>Dex, do you read me?</i>

296
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,363
<i>Dex, are you there?</i>

297
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,632
I can't outrun them much longer.

298
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:17,900
Hold on.

299
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,378
Joe, what are you doing?
You're heading straight down!

300
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,015
- You're gonna kill us!
- I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.

301
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,084
We're going too fast.
We're not gonna make it.

302
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:32,853
Joe, you have to pull up!

303
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,028
Pull up!

304
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,878
- We went underwater.
- Dex rigged it up.

305
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,850
Got the idea from one
of his comic books.

306
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:16,990
You mean, you knew this
the whole time,

307
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,863
and you let me think
we were gonna crash?

308
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,801
I thought we were gonna die!
You should have said something!

309
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,374
Look, Polly, it was your idea
to tag along, not mine.

310
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,411
If you can't take it,
that's not my fault.

311
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,080
Oh, I can take it.

312
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,182
- I can take anything you dish out.
- Good.

313
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,616
Because that was nothing.

314
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,742
Dex, come in. Do you read me?

315
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,943
Do you read me, Dex? Copy.

316
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,226
Dex!

317
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,833
Dex!

318
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,168
Dex.

319
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,496
They're everywhere.

320
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,368
Joe, look out!

321
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:51,844
Dex!

322
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,598
Why would Totenkopf do this?

323
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,126
Why Dex?
It doesn't make any sense.

324
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,502
He was looking for something.

325
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,445
Dex said he knew where
the transmission was coming from.

326
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,420
He must have got too close.

327
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,942
- He was trying to tell me something...
- Joe.

328
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,554
Good boy, Dex.

329
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,575
These journals belong to Dr. Vargas.

330
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,648
He must have passed them on to
Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.

331
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,382
- My God.
- What?

332
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:07,023
"Totenkopf was awarded his first
patent when he was 12 years old.

333
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,691
By 17, he had already received
two doctorates

334
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:14,160
and was one of the most highly
regarded minds of his day.

335
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:18,324
One year after his disappearance,
ominous rumors began circulating.

336
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,595
Whispers that Totenkopf
had begun work

337
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:24,103
on what was darkly hinted
to be a doomsday device.

338
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,606
Efforts to locate him
have consistently failed,

339
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,439
and to this day, his whereabouts
remain a mystery.

340
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:33,139
Even less is known
about his companion,

341
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,580
an assassin who controls
his machines."

342
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,276
She's the one who took Dex.

343
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:39,923
What else?

344
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,193
These are Unit 11 supply logs.

345
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,332
This is everything he's used
his machines to collect

346
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,969
for the last three years,
including generators from the city.

347
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,196
It reads like a shopping list
from all over the world.

348
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,535
What have you been up to, doctor?

349
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,885
It'll be all right, Joe.
Dex can look after himself.

350
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,829
We'll find him.

351
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,265
My old friend Joe.

352
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,505
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

353
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:09,338
This is Polly Perkins.
She'll be coming with us.

354
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,207
Nice to meet you.

355
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:18,621
- Kaji, did you get the maps I needed?
- Yeah, they're inside.

356
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,756
Did you get a little something
for me?

357
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:25,156
Of course. Three cases,
just like you asked.

358
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:30,129
Vienna sausages.
My God, it's been so long.

359
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,461
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?

360
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,372
Come, I'll show you the maps.

361
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,650
- How well do you know him?
- Kaji?

362
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,652
He's old legion.
Reconnaissance. Why?

363
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,487
I don't trust him.

364
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,422
That's funny, he said
the same thing about you.

365
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:02,756
Here. Get changed.
Your clothes stay behind.

366
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,799
You won't be needing high heels
where we're going.

367
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:18,880
Dex tracked the signal to here,
this valley north of Karakal.

368
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,583
This is where
the transmission originated.

369
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,219
Why is there no writing here?
What is this place?

370
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,353
- Shambhala.
- You know it?

371
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,189
It is forbidden.

372
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:34,091
It's said to be the source
of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.

373
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,858
Those who live there are said
to have supernatural powers.

374
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,831
You can get us there, Kaji,
can't you?

375
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,231
No one has ventured this far.
It's very dangerous.

376
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:47,034
Shambhala is said to be protected by
the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.

377
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,906
If they find us there,
they will kill us.

378
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,548
Why? Why is this place so special?

379
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,516
Shambhala is known by many names.
To the Hebrew, it is Eden.

380
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,553
To the ancient Greek,
it was Empurios.

381
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,954
You may know it as Shangri-la.

382
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:12,760
A storm is coming. If you still wish
to go, we must go now.

383
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,634
I need to send a message.

384
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,741
<i>Editor Paley, this may be the last
message you receive from me.</i>

385
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,850
<i>We've tracked a radio signal to Nepal
in search of Dr. Totenkopf.</i>

386
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,816
<i>The story grows stranger
at every turn.</i>

387
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:35,287
<i>Clues about a countdown.
But to what, I don't know.</i>

388
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:36,925
<i>I fear time is running out.</i>

389
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,692
<i>With any luck, I'll be back soon
with Dex and the story.</i>

390
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:44,265
<i>I hope. Polly Perkins.</i>

391
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:14,257
This is where civilization stops.

392
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,364
A blank on the map.

393
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,167
We must be careful from here.

394
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,504
Hurry.

395
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,432
What is it?

396
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,035
It looks like a mining outpost.

397
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,832
Something bad happened here.

398
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,879
Seems to be abandoned.

399
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,241
Tell your men we're heading down.

400
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,274
I want a closer look.

401
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,193
What is it, Joe?

402
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,591
Uranium.

403
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:57,494
The whole mine's contaminated.

404
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,468
- We can't stay here.
- Let's go.

405
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,005
Where's Polly?

406
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,438
Polly!

407
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,704
Miss Perkins?

408
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,346
We'll have to split up.

409
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:27,830
Polly!

410
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,898
Let her go.

411
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,929
Give me the vials
and the girl will live.

412
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,698
What vials?
What are you talking about?

413
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,475
I will not ask a second time.

414
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,941
Drop the gun.

415
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,848
I told you, I don't know what you're
talking about. You'll just have to kill us.

416
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,357
As you wish.

417
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,363
Wait! Wait. Wait.

418
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,472
I'm sorry, Joe.

419
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,804
Goodbye, my friends.
Your journey ends here.

420
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,991
I was going to tell you, Joe.
You have to believe me.

421
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:33,756
- What was in those vials?
- I don't know.

422
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:38,264
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm telling the truth, Joe.

423
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,868
Dr. Jennings gave them to me
just before he died.

424
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:43,801
He said that the world would end
and the countdown would begin

425
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,838
if Totenkopf got his hands on them.

426
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,406
You've done nothing but lie to me
from the beginning.

427
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:55,608
Okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate.
That is what he said.

428
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:59,388
That was what Totenkopf
was looking for.

429
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,080
- That's why he took Dex.
- I'm sorry.

430
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,721
I never meant for any of this
to happen.

431
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,495
Do you hear that?

432
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,171
Dynamite.

433
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:28,711
That noise again.

434
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:39,885
Move!

435
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:55,672
What are you doing?

436
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,481
Come on!

437
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,748
Oh, great.

438
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,649
We're safe.

439
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:08,957
Polly, this may be
our last moment together.

440
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,093
There's something
I need to ask you.

441
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,488
Yes, Joe?

442
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,457
Did you cut my fuel line?

443
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:22,036
Damn it! I didn't sabotage
your lousy airplane!

444
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,299
Our last moments on earth
and this is all you have to say to me?

445
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,670
Could we just for once die
without all this bickering?

446
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,684
There you are.

447
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,361
- Why did you lock the door?
- Run!

448
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:47,730
My film.

449
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,194
Polly, leave it!
There's no time!

450
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,414
Polly.

451
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:13,048
Polly.

452
00:53:40,947 --> 00:53:42,710
My clothes.

453
00:53:44,651 --> 00:53:47,620
What are you doing in here?
Get out. Get out!

454
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:50,688
Not unless you have some pants
hidden under there for me.

455
00:53:50,891 --> 00:53:54,827
- Oh, don't tell me you're...
- Naked.

456
00:53:56,296 --> 00:53:59,493
- You can say it, Polly.
- This isn't funny, Joe.

457
00:54:00,634 --> 00:54:04,627
Where are we? What happened to us?
Where are our clothes?

458
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:09,707
Stop looking at me like that.

459
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:12,405
Like what?

460
00:54:14,281 --> 00:54:16,374
Turn around, Joe.

461
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:19,441
I'm serious. Turn around.

462
00:54:25,826 --> 00:54:26,850
Hi, Joe.

463
00:54:48,048 --> 00:54:49,948
Ask him what he did
with our clothes.

464
00:54:52,986 --> 00:54:54,453
The clothes are burned.

465
00:54:54,654 --> 00:54:56,519
Burned? Why?

466
00:54:59,826 --> 00:55:01,851
He says the mine is poisonous.

467
00:55:02,062 --> 00:55:03,120
Our clothes were infected.

468
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:09,927
He says he's arranged for a guide
to lead us back down the mountain.

469
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:12,628
He will take us there
once we are dressed.

470
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:16,104
We appreciate that. But explain to him
we are here to find a man.

471
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:24,908
He says we must leave
before it is dark.

472
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:26,683
There's nothing more
he can do for us.

473
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,955
It's very important we find this man.

474
00:55:30,624 --> 00:55:31,989
His name is Totenkopf!

475
00:55:37,063 --> 00:55:39,031
He says, what do you want
with this man?

476
00:55:39,232 --> 00:55:41,097
I've come to kill him.

477
00:55:41,334 --> 00:55:42,995
And to find my friend.

478
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:49,804
He says he will help you.

479
00:55:59,686 --> 00:56:01,517
What do you think?

480
00:56:05,692 --> 00:56:07,751
I think they burned
the wrong clothes.

481
00:56:09,062 --> 00:56:11,394
You said I couldn't bring
anything else.

482
00:56:11,598 --> 00:56:13,429
I think you look like
a woolly mammoth.

483
00:56:14,601 --> 00:56:15,863
They're waiting for us.

484
00:56:17,938 --> 00:56:20,873
The priest says that Totenkopf
enslaved his people,

485
00:56:21,074 --> 00:56:23,133
made them work in the mine,
but the mine was poisonous.

486
00:56:23,343 --> 00:56:26,244
Those who did not die right away
were brought here for him to study.

487
00:56:26,446 --> 00:56:28,471
Where is Totenkopf now?

488
00:56:28,682 --> 00:56:32,618
He does not know. Only that
Totenkopf is gone, many years ago.

489
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,585
I can't believe this is happening.

490
00:56:41,628 --> 00:56:44,256
I only have two shots left.

491
00:56:44,564 --> 00:56:48,330
We're in Shangri-la
and all I have is two shots.

492
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:49,900
Everything I had was in that bag.

493
00:56:50,103 --> 00:56:51,661
You should have let me go back
for my film.

494
00:56:51,872 --> 00:56:54,102
You're right, I should have.

495
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,370
So where's he taking us?

496
00:57:01,581 --> 00:57:06,041
To meet the only living survivor
of Totenkopf's experiments.

497
00:57:06,253 --> 00:57:07,982
What experiments?

498
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:24,698
Ask him, where is Totenkopf?
Tell him it's important we find him.

499
00:57:32,279 --> 00:57:34,247
He wants to know why.
Why do you seek Totenkopf?

500
00:57:34,447 --> 00:57:37,439
To make him pay
for what he has done.

501
00:57:48,528 --> 00:57:51,395
His staff. He's asking for his staff.

502
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:56,701
He says, follow Rana. The staff
will lead you there to Totenkopf.

503
00:57:58,405 --> 00:58:01,636
Rana? Is there such a place?

504
00:58:06,112 --> 00:58:09,548
He says now that he has helped you,
you must help him.

505
00:58:10,817 --> 00:58:12,546
Of course. Anything.

506
00:58:17,357 --> 00:58:18,722
What do you want?

507
00:58:23,029 --> 00:58:25,293
Kill me.

508
00:58:35,742 --> 00:58:38,836
Have you looked at this?
There's markings on it, like a ruler.

509
00:58:41,014 --> 00:58:43,005
And there's a moon and a star.

510
00:58:46,953 --> 00:58:51,356
<i>And all I ask is a tall ship</i>

511
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:55,617
<i>and a star to steer her by</i>

512
00:58:57,097 --> 00:58:58,564
A star.

513
00:58:58,765 --> 00:59:01,859
He wasn't talking about a place,
he was talking about a star!

514
00:59:02,068 --> 00:59:04,195
Rana is a star.

515
00:59:04,537 --> 00:59:08,598
Ancient sailors used to navigate
by using the night sky.

516
00:59:08,808 --> 00:59:12,471
They could determine their position
by the moon and the stars.

517
00:59:12,979 --> 00:59:14,080
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

518
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,844
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

519
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:19,883
latitude tables that required a key
to decipher them.

520
00:59:20,086 --> 00:59:24,523
The key was called Jacob's staff.
This has to be the key!

521
00:59:24,724 --> 00:59:26,214
You mean this could really work?

522
00:59:26,426 --> 00:59:29,224
You could really find Totenkopf
with this thing?

523
00:59:29,429 --> 00:59:31,420
We do things a little
different nowadays.

524
00:59:31,631 --> 00:59:34,623
All we needed to know was where
to look. What's the date?

525
00:59:34,834 --> 00:59:36,529
- March 2.
- March 2.

526
00:59:36,736 --> 00:59:40,832
Using Karakal Plateau
as our assumed position...

527
00:59:41,775 --> 00:59:43,709
March 2...

528
00:59:45,545 --> 00:59:50,209
Rana is at latitude 20.40.

529
00:59:51,117 --> 00:59:57,852
Right ascension, 03 hours,
43 minutes.

530
00:59:58,291 --> 01:00:03,058
Declination, minus 10.60.

531
01:00:08,368 --> 01:00:10,427
There's nothing there.

532
01:00:10,637 --> 01:00:12,832
Are you sure you did it right?

533
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:14,768
I'm sure.

534
01:00:15,475 --> 01:00:18,342
If the old man was right,
that's where Totenkopf is now.

535
01:00:18,545 --> 01:00:20,672
Dead center in the middle
of nowhere.

536
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:32,821
What's that point there?

537
01:00:33,026 --> 01:00:34,891
That's where we run out of fuel.

538
01:00:35,095 --> 01:00:36,756
Oh, great.

539
01:00:38,865 --> 01:00:40,196
So how do we get there?

540
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,638
- Franky.
- Who?

541
01:00:47,741 --> 01:00:50,141
Frank Cook. An old buddy of mine.

542
01:00:50,343 --> 01:00:52,641
Runs a mobile reconnaissance outpost
for the Royal Navy.

543
01:00:53,947 --> 01:00:56,108
If I can get a message to them,

544
01:00:56,316 --> 01:00:59,114
I may be able to arrange a rendezvous
at these coordinates.

545
01:01:00,286 --> 01:01:01,719
And what if they don't
get the message?

546
01:01:01,921 --> 01:01:05,049
Franky's never let me down.
They'll be there.

547
01:01:07,393 --> 01:01:08,451
They'll be there.

548
01:01:24,677 --> 01:01:26,838
Is that light supposed to be on?

549
01:01:27,046 --> 01:01:28,570
Relax, Polly, everything's fine.

550
01:01:30,049 --> 01:01:33,212
- We're out of fuel, aren't we?
- Buckle up.

551
01:01:36,389 --> 01:01:38,414
Manta Station, do you read me?

552
01:01:39,058 --> 01:01:41,390
Where are you, Franky?

553
01:01:46,699 --> 01:01:47,859
What are you doing?

554
01:01:48,368 --> 01:01:51,132
You can't land this
in the middle of nowhere.

555
01:01:51,404 --> 01:01:53,998
I'm not. I'm landing it on that.

556
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:58,242
- What is it?
- It's a mobile airstrip.

557
01:01:58,444 --> 01:02:00,173
Dex had a hand in designing it.

558
01:02:00,547 --> 01:02:03,641
It's kind of a secret. You can keep
a secret, can't you, Polly?

559
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:04,908
Yeah.

560
01:02:05,118 --> 01:02:07,643
I can keep a secret.

561
01:02:14,227 --> 01:02:15,694
Two shots.

562
01:02:15,895 --> 01:02:20,264
<i>Permission to land on platform 327.
Maintain your present course.</i>

563
01:02:20,834 --> 01:02:22,461
Copy, 327.

564
01:02:22,669 --> 01:02:24,899
<i>Welcome aboard, captain.</i>

565
01:03:04,043 --> 01:03:08,309
Joseph Sullivan.
I was sure you'd be dead by now.

566
01:03:11,084 --> 01:03:12,847
It's good to see you too, Franky.

567
01:03:13,052 --> 01:03:17,318
This had better be important
or one of us is in trouble.

568
01:03:17,523 --> 01:03:18,649
It's important.

569
01:03:22,595 --> 01:03:23,823
What is that?

570
01:03:29,435 --> 01:03:31,198
You be nice.

571
01:03:32,438 --> 01:03:35,168
Commander Cook,
meet Polly Perkins.

572
01:03:35,642 --> 01:03:38,873
Polly Perkins.
I've heard so much about you.

573
01:03:39,078 --> 01:03:41,171
It's a pleasure to finally meet
the competition.

574
01:03:42,115 --> 01:03:45,516
It's been a long time since Nanjing,
hasn't it, Joseph?

575
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:52,221
So, Franky, I hear you've been having
trouble with that number-three engine,

576
01:03:52,425 --> 01:03:54,359
or at least you were last time...

577
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,960
Commander, we're tracking six
enemy submersibles

578
01:03:57,163 --> 01:03:59,154
bearing 30 degrees northwest.

579
01:03:59,365 --> 01:04:02,823
<i>- Who wants to kill you now?
- Man your battle stations.</i>

580
01:04:03,036 --> 01:04:04,401
<i>- All hands on deck.
- Follow me.</i>

581
01:04:14,747 --> 01:04:16,578
Take us to 10,000 feet
and deploy countermeasures.

582
01:04:16,783 --> 01:04:17,750
Yes, commander.

583
01:04:18,618 --> 01:04:20,415
Reconnaissance located an island

584
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:23,384
3 kilometers northeast
of our current position.

585
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:26,057
It is not, however,
on any of our charts.

586
01:04:26,259 --> 01:04:28,227
- That has to be him.
- That has to be who?

587
01:04:30,129 --> 01:04:32,620
What have you got me
into this time, Joseph?

588
01:04:32,832 --> 01:04:34,766
Nothing you can't handle, Franky.

589
01:04:37,804 --> 01:04:39,567
Polly, try not to touch anything.

590
01:04:39,772 --> 01:04:43,902
Enemy warships bearing 316,
mark 4. Closing fast.

591
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:47,341
- Give me a visual.
- Launching radio imager.

592
01:04:58,358 --> 01:05:00,849
We're receiving a signal.
On-screen now.

593
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:09,891
Totenkopf.

594
01:05:12,372 --> 01:05:15,864
Commander, we've lost power to the
forward rotors. We're losing altitude.

595
01:05:16,075 --> 01:05:19,238
All engines, reverse full.
Get us out of here.

596
01:05:19,912 --> 01:05:21,812
Francesca, you've got to get me
on that island.

597
01:05:22,015 --> 01:05:25,109
I'm not about to risk the lives
of my men for one of your silly antics.

598
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:27,343
He's got Dex.

599
01:05:29,288 --> 01:05:31,313
Rescind order!

600
01:05:33,326 --> 01:05:36,818
You'll never make it from the air.
We have to find you another way.

601
01:05:41,534 --> 01:05:43,968
There's a tidal flow on the eastern face
of the island.

602
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:47,401
It's too deep.
We're not rated past 300 meters.

603
01:05:48,007 --> 01:05:49,304
But...

604
01:05:50,476 --> 01:05:52,000
...this area here,

605
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:53,974
there's an undersea inlet
at the southern tip

606
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:58,617
and it runs beneath the entire length
of the island. That is your only way in.

607
01:05:58,885 --> 01:06:01,080
Everything else is sheer rock
to the edge of the water.

608
01:06:01,287 --> 01:06:03,653
What about those machines?
How do we get past them?

609
01:06:03,856 --> 01:06:05,289
Leave that to me.

610
01:06:07,693 --> 01:06:09,490
Alert the amphibious squadron.

611
01:06:13,533 --> 01:06:16,400
<i>Report to main station carrier.</i>

612
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,402
What?

613
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:56,802
Nanjing?

614
01:06:57,977 --> 01:07:00,275
I can't hear you, Polly.

615
01:07:00,713 --> 01:07:02,010
You'll have to speak up.

616
01:07:23,236 --> 01:07:26,797
<i>Keep your nose up, Joseph. You
always were bad at the short takeoff.</i>

617
01:07:27,006 --> 01:07:29,736
Keep up, Franky. I don't wanna
have to come back for you.

618
01:07:33,146 --> 01:07:35,614
I thought your takeoff was just fine.

619
01:07:36,048 --> 01:07:37,208
Thank you, Polly.

620
01:07:37,483 --> 01:07:39,348
So you heard that, did you?

621
01:07:43,523 --> 01:07:46,720
<i>Manta leader to Manta team,
impact in ten seconds.</i>

622
01:07:46,926 --> 01:07:48,621
Switching to amphibious mode.

623
01:07:58,004 --> 01:08:00,973
Impact in five, four, three,

624
01:08:01,174 --> 01:08:03,301
two, one.

625
01:08:29,602 --> 01:08:30,694
Franky.

626
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:33,963
<i>You remember our milk run
over Shanghai, don't you?</i>

627
01:08:34,173 --> 01:08:36,641
<i>We had the target buttoned up
and he was jinxing in the flak.</i>

628
01:08:36,842 --> 01:08:40,141
- Pops a rivet, thinks he's taken a hit.
- And started yelling:

629
01:08:40,346 --> 01:08:41,745
<i>- "Protect the rabbits!
- "Protect the rabbits!</i>

630
01:08:41,948 --> 01:08:44,473
<i>- Protect the rabbits!"
- Protect the rabbits!"</i>

631
01:08:55,127 --> 01:09:00,087
Enemy target spotted four points
to the right. Depth, 1,600. Look sharp.

632
01:09:12,812 --> 01:09:14,746
Joe, watch out!

633
01:09:56,422 --> 01:09:59,687
- Joseph, there's the inlet.
- I see it.

634
01:10:03,229 --> 01:10:06,426
Get ready to make a run for it.
We're about to clear you a path.

635
01:10:12,672 --> 01:10:14,697
Hold on, now, Polly.
Hold on.

636
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:16,736
Manta leader to Manta team,

637
01:10:16,942 --> 01:10:20,207
arm cluster torpedoes
and stick close to element formation.

638
01:10:22,848 --> 01:10:23,815
Fire.

639
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:40,225
Joseph! Pull up!

640
01:10:52,478 --> 01:10:54,969
Joseph, it's still alive. Disengage.

641
01:10:57,416 --> 01:10:59,316
Do you hear me? Disengage.

642
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:01,547
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

643
01:11:01,754 --> 01:11:04,552
<i>- What is it?
- Do you hear me? Pull up!</i>

644
01:11:04,757 --> 01:11:07,487
- The rudder's jammed. I can't steer.
- Joseph!

645
01:11:10,663 --> 01:11:11,891
Disengage!

646
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:31,445
- Thank you, Franky. That was close.
- Get ready to make a run for it.

647
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:33,015
<i>You're only going to have
one shot at this.</i>

648
01:11:33,219 --> 01:11:35,278
Franky, what are you doing?
This is no time to show off.

649
01:11:35,488 --> 01:11:37,422
- She's heading straight for it.
- On my mark.

650
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:39,448
- She's going to ram it.
- It's suicide.

651
01:11:39,658 --> 01:11:41,523
Franky, pull up.

652
01:11:43,195 --> 01:11:44,992
- Three.
- Pull up, Franky.

653
01:11:45,197 --> 01:11:46,687
Two.

654
01:11:46,932 --> 01:11:48,194
One.

655
01:12:02,748 --> 01:12:04,181
You're all clear.

656
01:12:04,784 --> 01:12:06,649
<i>Good luck, Joe.</i>

657
01:12:06,986 --> 01:12:09,648
Thank you, Franky.
We'll take it from here.

658
01:12:10,856 --> 01:12:12,187
She's some kind of girl.

659
01:12:13,426 --> 01:12:14,518
Yes, I know.

660
01:12:36,115 --> 01:12:38,049
I'm taking us up.

661
01:13:32,271 --> 01:13:33,602
What?

662
01:13:38,878 --> 01:13:43,076
- What is it?
- One of Totenkopf's creatures.

663
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:02,257
- You're not gonna photograph that?
- I've only got two shots left.

664
01:14:02,468 --> 01:14:04,629
Who knows what's waiting for us
out there.

665
01:14:04,837 --> 01:14:06,828
Suit yourself.

666
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:12,708
There's a clearing up ahead.
Totenkopf can't be far.

667
01:14:35,801 --> 01:14:37,098
Run.

668
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:49,878
There.

669
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:08,031
Polly!

670
01:15:14,607 --> 01:15:16,234
Oh, great.

671
01:15:17,876 --> 01:15:19,366
Come on!

672
01:15:21,547 --> 01:15:22,514
Polly!

673
01:15:24,516 --> 01:15:26,006
Come on!

674
01:15:35,961 --> 01:15:36,862
Are you mad?

675
01:15:36,962 --> 01:15:37,692
Are you mad?

676
01:15:37,896 --> 01:15:42,060
Are you completely insane?
You could have gotten yourself killed!

677
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:49,439
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

678
01:15:49,642 --> 01:15:51,940
- I didn't mean...
- I shot the ground!

679
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,004
- What?
- When we were running,

680
01:15:56,215 --> 01:15:59,116
I shot the ground.

681
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:05,589
It isn't funny.

682
01:16:07,626 --> 01:16:12,723
I only have one shot left.
One shot!

683
01:16:19,605 --> 01:16:22,472
What is it with you
and that stupid camera, anyway?

684
01:16:23,075 --> 01:16:24,565
You gave it to me.

685
01:16:27,646 --> 01:16:29,273
You don't even remember, do you?

686
01:16:30,683 --> 01:16:33,174
You were flying with the American
volunteers in Nanjing,

687
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:35,945
I was covering the evacuation
of Shanghai.

688
01:16:36,488 --> 01:16:38,285
- I remember.
- Joe, I wanna ask you something

689
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:39,889
and I want you to tell me the truth.

690
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:43,959
I don't care one way or the other,
I swear. I just need to know.

691
01:16:44,596 --> 01:16:46,257
The girl in Nanjing was Franky,
wasn't it?

692
01:16:46,465 --> 01:16:49,491
- Polly.
- How long were you seeing her?

693
01:16:51,203 --> 01:16:52,261
Look me in the eyes.

694
01:16:53,839 --> 01:16:56,273
I never fooled around on you.

695
01:16:56,475 --> 01:16:57,442
Never.

696
01:17:00,379 --> 01:17:02,279
I sabotaged your plane.

697
01:17:04,283 --> 01:17:05,807
- Three months.
- I knew it!

698
01:17:06,018 --> 01:17:08,851
I can't believe I ever trusted you,
you lousy...

699
01:17:13,525 --> 01:17:15,220
He's here.

700
01:17:26,071 --> 01:17:27,766
You all right?

701
01:17:43,655 --> 01:17:45,020
Through there.

702
01:17:51,764 --> 01:17:52,731
Through there.

703
01:18:53,292 --> 01:18:54,691
My God, Joe.

704
01:18:56,028 --> 01:18:57,689
It's an ark.

705
01:18:57,896 --> 01:19:00,228
He's building an ark.

706
01:19:10,342 --> 01:19:12,037
What are you doing?

707
01:19:14,046 --> 01:19:16,708
You honestly think you're gonna
find something more important

708
01:19:16,915 --> 01:19:20,043
than every single creature on Earth
being led two by two

709
01:19:20,252 --> 01:19:22,584
inside a giant rocket ship?

710
01:19:23,188 --> 01:19:24,815
I might.

711
01:19:26,325 --> 01:19:28,850
- Like what?
- I'll know when I see it.

712
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:40,633
<i>- Ten minutes to liftoff.
- They've started the countdown.</i>

713
01:19:40,839 --> 01:19:43,239
We have to find Totenkopf.

714
01:19:52,951 --> 01:19:54,612
You've got a gift.

715
01:20:20,145 --> 01:20:21,772
- Dex!
- Hurry, get in!

716
01:20:26,685 --> 01:20:27,845
<i>Einsteigen. Komm, springt!</i>

717
01:20:35,394 --> 01:20:36,952
Are you all right?
How did you find us?

718
01:20:37,162 --> 01:20:39,221
We escaped into the tunnels
once the countdown started.

719
01:20:39,431 --> 01:20:42,059
Some of the scientists were caught.
They didn't make it.

720
01:20:44,903 --> 01:20:46,200
The machines that were guarding us

721
01:20:46,405 --> 01:20:48,373
are loading everything on this island
into that ship.

722
01:20:48,573 --> 01:20:50,871
We've got about ten minutes
to stop that thing from blasting off.

723
01:20:53,512 --> 01:20:55,912
Dex! Get us out of here!

724
01:21:19,237 --> 01:21:20,602
Good boy, Dex.

725
01:21:21,506 --> 01:21:22,768
Thanks, Cap.

726
01:21:27,312 --> 01:21:29,109
- Who are they?
- They're Unit 11.

727
01:21:29,314 --> 01:21:30,406
Or what's left of them.

728
01:21:30,615 --> 01:21:33,641
They were brought here to finish
what they started 30 years ago.

729
01:21:33,852 --> 01:21:35,114
Finish what?

730
01:21:35,487 --> 01:21:36,454
Tell them.

731
01:21:36,655 --> 01:21:39,715
Totenkopf believed that humankind
was doomed to extinction,

732
01:21:39,925 --> 01:21:41,552
so he proposed the unthinkable:

733
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,196
To build a vessel that would carry
the building blocks of a new civilization

734
01:21:45,397 --> 01:21:46,364
into space.

735
01:21:46,565 --> 01:21:48,556
He used his machines
to collect specimens

736
01:21:48,767 --> 01:21:50,428
representing all life on Earth.

737
01:21:50,635 --> 01:21:52,227
What Totenkopf called
"The World of Tomorrow."

738
01:21:52,437 --> 01:21:55,235
Those vials that Dr. Jennings
gave me, what were they?

739
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,738
Adam and Eve.
Totenkopf's masterpiece.

740
01:21:57,943 --> 01:22:00,207
Seeds of a technological utopia.

741
01:22:00,412 --> 01:22:01,811
We smuggled them off this island,

742
01:22:02,014 --> 01:22:03,811
knowing Totenkopf
would never leave without them.

743
01:22:04,016 --> 01:22:07,577
But now that he has them again,
there is nothing left to keep him here.

744
01:22:07,786 --> 01:22:10,482
Then let him go. Let him go
where he can't harm anyone.

745
01:22:10,689 --> 01:22:13,317
No, no, no, that ship
must never leave this Earth.

746
01:22:13,525 --> 01:22:15,425
Why? What haven't you told us?

747
01:22:15,627 --> 01:22:18,824
When the rocket reaches 100
kilometers, at the edge of space,

748
01:22:19,031 --> 01:22:21,795
- Earth will be incinerated.
- How do we stop it?

749
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,764
Only Totenkopf can stop it now. But
we've never been allowed near him.

750
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:27,063
He's too well guarded
even to be seen.

751
01:22:27,272 --> 01:22:29,832
- Where is he?
- We're on our way, Cap.

752
01:22:30,142 --> 01:22:31,302
Good boy, Dex.

753
01:22:35,447 --> 01:22:37,608
Careful. Careful.

754
01:22:40,252 --> 01:22:42,686
Hurry, they'll be coming for us.

755
01:22:48,393 --> 01:22:49,758
Through there.
That's the only way in.

756
01:22:49,961 --> 01:22:53,260
You see, there is no way past them.

757
01:22:53,732 --> 01:22:55,700
Five minutes, Joe.

758
01:22:56,902 --> 01:22:58,733
- Wait here.
- You'll be killed.

759
01:22:59,805 --> 01:23:01,363
He knows what he's doing.

760
01:23:04,009 --> 01:23:05,101
I think.

761
01:23:10,015 --> 01:23:10,982
Hey, that's my gun!

762
01:23:16,555 --> 01:23:17,749
- Dex?
- Try shaking it.

763
01:23:25,797 --> 01:23:29,164
- We must hurry.
- Don't do it, you idiot!

764
01:23:29,367 --> 01:23:30,664
Doctor, stop!

765
01:23:48,053 --> 01:23:50,578
<i>Who dares come before me?</i>

766
01:23:50,789 --> 01:23:53,053
<i>Who dares enter this place?</i>

767
01:23:53,258 --> 01:23:56,489
<i>What has begun
cannot be stopped.</i>

768
01:23:56,695 --> 01:24:00,028
<i>- The time for this world is over.
- Totenkopf.</i>

769
01:24:00,232 --> 01:24:01,494
Hello, doctor.

770
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,167
Why are you doing this?

771
01:24:03,368 --> 01:24:06,337
<i>I have been witness to a world
consumed by hatred</i>

772
01:24:06,538 --> 01:24:08,836
<i>and bent on self-destruction.</i>

773
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,339
<i>Watched as we have taken
what was to be a paradise</i>

774
01:24:12,544 --> 01:24:15,843
<i>and failed in our responsibilities
as its steward.</i>

775
01:24:16,047 --> 01:24:19,278
<i>I know now that the course
the human race has set for itself</i>

776
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,518
<i>cannot be changed.</i>

777
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,952
<i>I am the last, desperate chance
for a doomed planet.</i>

778
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:28,854
<i>Now, leave this place or die!</i>

779
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,932
- Is it safe?
- Well, there's only one way to find out.

780
01:24:49,514 --> 01:24:50,947
I meant throw something.

781
01:25:13,138 --> 01:25:14,400
He's not here.

782
01:25:14,873 --> 01:25:16,340
We're too late.

783
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:18,236
These are his personal papers.

784
01:25:18,443 --> 01:25:21,935
He would never leave without them.
He must still be here.

785
01:25:22,147 --> 01:25:24,809
- We must find him.
- I found him.

786
01:25:39,864 --> 01:25:41,024
It's impossible.

787
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:43,529
It can't be.

788
01:25:43,735 --> 01:25:47,102
The last entry in his journal
was made on October 11, 1918.

789
01:25:47,339 --> 01:25:48,966
He died over 20 years ago.

790
01:25:55,847 --> 01:25:57,644
We've been chasing a ghost.

791
01:26:10,362 --> 01:26:12,796
<i>Three minutes to liftoff.</i>

792
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:21,338
They never stopped. They're finishing
what they were programmed to do.

793
01:26:21,539 --> 01:26:26,909
Don't you see? This entire island
is Totenkopf. Every wire, every gear.

794
01:26:27,112 --> 01:26:30,081
He's found a way to cheat
even his own death.

795
01:26:30,282 --> 01:26:33,274
So how do we kill somebody
who's already dead?

796
01:26:35,353 --> 01:26:37,082
- How do I stop it?
- Nothing can stop it now.

797
01:26:37,289 --> 01:26:39,655
- There must be some way.
- His machines would never allow it.

798
01:26:39,858 --> 01:26:42,190
Leave the machines to me.
Dex, show me what to do.

799
01:26:45,163 --> 01:26:47,723
If you can cut the lead
in the system terminal,

800
01:26:47,932 --> 01:26:50,230
it should create a short...

801
01:26:51,903 --> 01:26:55,031
...which will ignite the fuel line
before the booster engines can fire

802
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,003
- and destroy the atmosphere.
- That's it?

803
01:26:58,543 --> 01:27:01,910
- That's all I have to do?
- The terminal's onboard the rocket.

804
01:27:02,113 --> 01:27:04,445
You won't have time to escape.

805
01:27:07,852 --> 01:27:10,013
Contact Franky as soon
as you're off the island.

806
01:27:10,221 --> 01:27:12,985
- She'll know exactly what to do.
- What are you talking about?

807
01:27:13,191 --> 01:27:15,716
- I'm going with you.
- Not this time.

808
01:27:15,927 --> 01:27:17,918
We had a deal.

809
01:27:18,596 --> 01:27:21,622
You're not gonna leave me now,
just when things are getting interesting.

810
01:27:24,602 --> 01:27:28,333
- I won't let you.
- I wish we had more time.

811
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:31,703
And I only hope, one day,
you can forgive me.

812
01:27:40,652 --> 01:27:43,120
- Take care of her, Dex.
- Good luck, Cap.

813
01:27:50,695 --> 01:27:53,095
<i>One minute to liftoff.</i>

814
01:28:07,479 --> 01:28:09,572
We meet again,
my mysterious friend.

815
01:28:12,884 --> 01:28:13,908
How do you wanna do this?

816
01:29:21,753 --> 01:29:23,983
Nice shot, Polly.

817
01:29:34,365 --> 01:29:36,526
What took you so long?

818
01:29:40,905 --> 01:29:42,065
She's a machine.

819
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,908
<i>Ten seconds to liftoff.</i>

820
01:29:52,417 --> 01:29:53,714
<i>Nine...</i>

821
01:29:53,918 --> 01:29:55,215
<i>... eight...</i>

822
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:56,944
<i>... seven...</i>

823
01:29:57,155 --> 01:29:58,417
<i>... six...</i>

824
01:29:58,623 --> 01:29:59,954
<i>... five...</i>

825
01:30:00,158 --> 01:30:01,716
<i>... four...</i>

826
01:30:51,009 --> 01:30:52,772
We've gotta get those animals
off the ship.

827
01:30:52,977 --> 01:30:55,172
<i>Ninety kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

828
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:56,642
There's no time.

829
01:31:01,085 --> 01:31:02,609
That's our only way across.

830
01:31:07,425 --> 01:31:09,893
<i>Eighty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

831
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:22,631
<i>Danger! Danger! Danger!
Cargo release imminent!</i>

832
01:31:23,107 --> 01:31:24,802
What did you do now?

833
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,047
Come on!

834
01:31:30,248 --> 01:31:32,876
<i>Seventy kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

835
01:31:45,797 --> 01:31:47,697
<i>Sixty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

836
01:31:50,935 --> 01:31:52,527
Hold on!

837
01:31:59,277 --> 01:32:03,008
Please! Don't touch anything else!

838
01:32:11,189 --> 01:32:13,680
There's no time. We'll never make it.

839
01:32:14,826 --> 01:32:17,590
<i>Fifty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

840
01:32:25,336 --> 01:32:26,360
Run!

841
01:32:27,839 --> 01:32:30,239
<i>Forty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

842
01:32:37,982 --> 01:32:40,280
Come in, Manta station.
Do you read me?

843
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:45,687
<i>Thirty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

844
01:32:49,827 --> 01:32:52,022
Franky, it's Dex. Do you read me?

845
01:33:01,305 --> 01:33:02,272
It didn't work.

846
01:33:05,843 --> 01:33:07,811
<i>Twenty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

847
01:33:08,413 --> 01:33:11,678
Joe, you're running out of time.
You've gotta do something.

848
01:33:13,217 --> 01:33:17,153
<i>And God saw that the wickedness
of man was great in the earth...</i>

849
01:33:17,355 --> 01:33:20,290
<i>- He thinks he's God.
- And God said unto Noah, the end...</i>

850
01:33:20,491 --> 01:33:21,788
Shut up!

851
01:33:21,993 --> 01:33:24,587
<i>Ten kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

852
01:33:25,096 --> 01:33:26,063
<i>Nine...</i>

853
01:33:27,065 --> 01:33:28,430
<i>... eight...</i>

854
01:33:28,633 --> 01:33:29,725
<i>... seven...</i>

855
01:33:30,234 --> 01:33:32,794
<i>- ... six...
- Why won't you die?</i>

856
01:33:33,004 --> 01:33:35,131
<i>Five kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

857
01:33:36,607 --> 01:33:38,302
<i>Four...</i>

858
01:33:38,876 --> 01:33:40,070
