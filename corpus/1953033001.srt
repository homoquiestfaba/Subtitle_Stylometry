1
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,686
<i>Saul and Jonathan were swifter</i>
<i>than eagles, fiercer than lions. </i>

2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,017
<i>In their death, they were not divided. </i>

3
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,021
<i>Jonathan, you were</i>
<i>like a brother to me. </i>

4
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,894
Kill me!

5
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:38,694
<i>Beloved Saul, </i>
<i>you called me your son. </i>

6
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,207
<i>When the Philistines</i>
<i>crushed your army... </i>

7
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:52,845
<i>... God made your crown</i>
<i>fall into my hands. </i>

8
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:13,338
<i>After seven years in Hebron, </i>
<i>my army and I approached Jerusalem. </i>

9
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:16,169
Our numbers are too great
to stay here in Hebron.

10
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,170
I have appealed to the Jebusites...

11
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:21,143
... to make their city of Jerusalem
our capital.

12
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,306
They claim they can beat
back our armies...

13
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,850
... with nothing but the sick
and the lame.

14
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,854
What do you think?
Shall we test that boast?

15
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,527
Look what becomes
of the well of Jerusalem.

16
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,139
Tell your city elders
that their water supply...

17
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,305
... is now in the hands of King David
of the Israelites.

18
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:47,663
They've captured the well!

19
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,033
You have a choice.

20
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,606
You can join us and live
in peace and security...

21
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,435
... or oppose us and die of thirst.

22
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,011
Please. Please, sir.

23
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,580
Enter our city in peace.

24
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,294
<i>O my God, </i>
<i>you have made this city... </i>

25
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,300
<i>... a blessing</i>
<i>for your faithful servant, David. </i>

26
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,202
<i>Thank you for Jerusalem... </i>

27
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,768
<i>... a place where my wives</i>
<i>and children... </i>

28
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:33,345
<i>... and all my once-weak and</i>
<i>scattered tribes can rest... </i>

29
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:39,315
<i>... and live as a united nation</i>
<i>to serve you, O Lord. </i>

30
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,568
Lord...

31
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:02,265
... who am I that you have brought me
to this beautiful city...

32
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,768
... and this beautiful house?

33
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,147
<i>You know my heart, Lord. </i>

34
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:16,579
<i>You know all the great things</i>
<i>you have done for me... </i>

35
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,315
<i>... that I would know your will. </i>

36
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,294
<i>We are your people... </i>

37
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,958
<i>... forever, Lord. </i>

38
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,600
<i>From a humble shepherd, Lord, </i>
<i>you have lifted me up... </i>

39
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,472
<i>... to be king over your city</i>
<i>and your people... </i>

40
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,309
<i>... as you did for that humble farmer</i>
<i>from the tribe of Benjamin... </i>

41
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,016
<i>... the man named Saul. </i>

42
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:25,846
Father...

43
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,281
... the mules...

44
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,045
... they're gone.

45
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,557
Abner, stay here.

46
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,659
Jonathan, come with me.
We'll get them back.

47
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,762
Are we being punished, Father?

48
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,802
I don't know.

49
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,995
I don't need to know.

50
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,064
We're at the border
of Benjamite territory.

51
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,839
If they're much further, they're lost.

52
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,708
I have faith the Lord wouldn't
make us come this far for nothing.

53
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,552
Have you found
our animals in the town?

54
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,316
No, master. But there is
in the city a man of God.

55
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,226
An honorable man.

56
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,453
What he says comes to pass.

57
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,757
We've no gifts for a holy man.

58
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,030
I have this silver.

59
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,366
Bless you, Jonathan.

60
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,671
We'll go and see him tomorrow.

61
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,996
We're looking for lost mules.

62
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,661
Perhaps you're the man
who can help us.

63
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,197
Come...

64
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,095
... up here with me.

65
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,038
Don't concern yourself
about your mules.

66
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,740
They've been found.

67
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,974
Did you say our mules
had been found?

68
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:51,213
Perhaps you know
that the tribes of Israel...

69
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,859
... have decided to ask God for a king.

70
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,927
We've all heard it.

71
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,563
I am the Lord's prophet...

72
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,062
... Samuel.

73
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,028
And yesterday...

74
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,336
... the Lord spoke to me,
and he said, "Tomorrow...

75
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,842
... at about this time...

76
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:14,403
... you'll meet a man
out of the tribe of Benjamin.

77
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,685
Anoint him to be
the captain of my people...

78
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,321
... and to save them from the Ammonites
and the Philistines. "

79
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:38,097
The Benjamites are
the smallest tribe of Israel.

80
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:46,335
My family is the least important
of all the Benjamin tribe.

81
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:50,005
None of that matters now,
since the Lord is with you.

82
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,585
You are the one on whom
all the hopes of Israel rest.

83
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,352
On you...

84
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,917
... and all your father's house.

85
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,381
With his blessing...

86
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,745
... the Lord has anointed you...

87
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:31,048
... as prince over all Israel.

88
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,651
Listen to the word of the Lord.

89
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,255
Obey his commandments.

90
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,759
Your enemies will flee...

91
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,659
... and your kingdom shall prosper.

92
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,204
Now rise to your feet.

93
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,907
I'm your humble servant,
my lord king.

94
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,354
Hail King Saul.

95
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,888
God bless him.

96
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:15,195
The Lord has seen you
as fit to do a king's work.

97
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,568
Trust him.

98
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,704
Is that all?

99
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:24,373
Today, after you depart from me,
you should travel to Rachel's sepulcher.

100
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,837
- I know it.
<i>- There you shall meet two men. </i>

101
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:32,347
<i>They will show you that the mules</i>
<i>that you went to seek are found. </i>

102
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,985
<i>Then you shall come</i>
<i>to the plain of Tabor... </i>

103
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,888
<i>... where you will meet three men</i>
<i>going up to God at Bethel. </i>

104
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:46,360
<i>And they will gift you with goats</i>
<i>and bread and wine. </i>

105
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:52,197
<i>And then you shall meet</i>
<i>a company of devout men... </i>

106
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,034
<i>... coming from a high place. </i>

107
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,013
<i>And the spirit of God</i>
<i>will come over you. </i>

108
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,308
God has given me another heart.

109
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,614
What is my first task?

110
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,120
To gather together the tribes...

111
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,654
... strike back at the Ammonites...

112
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,493
... and win a war.

113
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,345
God save King Saul!

114
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,538
God save King Saul!

115
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,348
God save King Saul!

116
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,950
God save King Saul!

117
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,679
Welcome, men!

118
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:53,648
Welcome to the army of Israel!

119
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,353
I will give orders to our forces...

120
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,324
... through my son...

121
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,192
... Jonathan...

122
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,961
... and my nephew, Abner,
and my lieutenant, Phineas.

123
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,198
Our job now...

124
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,606
... is to make weapons!
- Yes.

125
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,407
We must make
as many weapons as possible.

126
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:22,043
We must work as hard
as we possibly can.

127
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:28,149
God doesn't want us to wave
our hands at the enemy.

128
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,929
He wants us to be as strong as we can...

129
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,998
... so that we can defeat our enemy.

130
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,072
God bless Saul!

131
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,673
God bless Saul!

132
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,433
And the army of Israel!

133
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,161
Stop!

134
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,842
Leave her be.
She's under my protection.

135
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,783
- Who are you?
- Not someone to answer your questions.

136
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,316
A while ago, you slaughtered
the men of this village.

137
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,687
I warn you now.

138
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,759
Give up hope of getting these lands...

139
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,864
... or any lands belonging to Israel.

140
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,225
Go back to where you come from.

141
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,927
What do we have here?
A Hebrew warrior?

142
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,595
These are the words of the Lord.

143
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,950
My name is Saul, king of Israel.

144
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,451
No!

145
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,326
Samuel...

146
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:56,138
... what now?
- Now you'll take your army to Gilgal.

147
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,507
I'll join you there.

148
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,014
You will wait for me for seven days...

149
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,706
... and then I'll come and tell you
what you must do for the Lord.

150
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,523
Over this next ridge.

151
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,811
My God.

152
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,857
Fetch me a calf.

153
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,289
I'll kill it as a sacrifice.

154
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,989
Very well, uncle.

155
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:58,602
Father, be patient. Wait for Samuel.

156
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,171
If he's not here to speak to God for me...

157
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,808
... I'll have to take care
of the matter myself.

158
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,545
Take the animal and burn it.

159
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,879
- Can't we share in the meat, my lord?
- Burn it. Bring me the ashes.

160
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,386
Saul.

161
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,924
What are you doing?

162
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,492
I'm making a sacrifice.

163
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,761
My army's been bled by deserters.

164
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,932
The Philistines are massing
in great numbers.

165
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,235
You were not here to speak on my behalf.

166
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,897
You were told to wait.

167
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,667
I had to do something.

168
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,539
You've not obeyed
the commandments of the Lord God.

169
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:46,342
He would have established
your kingdom forever.

170
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,386
Samuel.

171
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,651
Samuel, wait.

172
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,593
Whatever the Lord asks of me,
I'll do it.

173
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:23,681
A few miles south of here,
there is a camp of Amalekites.

174
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,490
Since we are a nation, they are
the most brutal enemies of Israel.

175
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,854
Their leader, Agag,
is a vicious murderer...

176
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,596
... a man of evil.

177
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,360
God wants you to remove them.

178
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,798
Jonathan!

179
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,738
Fetch my armor.

180
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,640
We march at once.

181
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,477
Fetch the armor!

182
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,554
Ready the spears!

183
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,653
And when I win this battle...

184
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,991
... will I be restored in the eyes of God?

185
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,057
Do not even ask.

186
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,231
Simply do as God commands.

187
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,124
Destroy the Amalekites completely, Saul.

188
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:14,433
Men, women, children, cattle, everything.

189
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:53,644
Great king, you have the field
and crushed my army.

190
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,905
Surely the bitterness of death is past.

191
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,078
Why is this man still alive?

192
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,754
Why have his cattle been spared?

193
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:07,017
My men are hungry. They need meat.

194
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:10,089
Agag is worth more
to me alive than dead.

195
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,490
Trust me, Samuel. It's for the best.

196
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,753
My God.

197
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,524
O my God.

198
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,334
<i>I repent that I have made Saul king. </i>

199
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,974
<i>He has turned back from following me... </i>

200
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:03,445
<i>... and has not performed</i>
<i>my commandments. </i>

201
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,529
Samuel...

202
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,872
... greetings.
- Stop.

203
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,478
I'll tell you what God has said.

204
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,007
Say on.

205
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,182
When you were little
in your own eyes...

206
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,544
... were you not made king of all Israel?
- I was.

207
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,210
And all God asked was that
you obey his commands.

208
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:47,419
Instead, you're as rebellious
as some heathen witch.

209
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,752
You reject the Lord.

210
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,729
Now he'll reject you and your kingdom.

211
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,030
Samuel...

212
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:59,433
... if I've sinned,
it was to feed my army.

213
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:04,174
All right. All right, I've sinned.

214
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:08,343
But, Samuel, help me, please. Help me.
Help me make this right with God.

215
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,244
Together. Together we'll make
a burnt offering.

216
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:13,612
You think God cares
about burnt offerings?

217
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,414
Or does he care that
his servant obey his word?

218
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,620
You cannot bargain
with the God of Israel.

219
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:26,824
As your sword
has made women childless...

220
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,557
... so shall your mother be childless.

221
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:43,004
No man has been given
what you have been given.

222
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,843
To have handled it so recklessly...

223
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,848
- You go too far.
- No, not far enough, I'm afraid.

224
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,217
Today, you've lost the kingdom
that God gave you.

225
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,357
I'll go find someone better
to give it to.

226
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:55,619
You'll not see me again
until the day you die.

227
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:59,821
No, Samuel.
Samuel, no! Samuel, no!

228
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:03,261
Samuel, don't go.

229
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,334
Samuel.

230
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:17,243
<i>Samuel... </i>

231
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,981
<i>... fill your horn with oil... </i>

232
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,677
<i>... and set out for Bethlehem. </i>

233
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:26,654
<i>There you will find a man</i>
<i>named Jesse. </i>

234
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:31,127
<i>Among his sons, there is a king. </i>

235
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:42,472
Thank you for choosing our village
to make a sacrifice.

236
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:45,337
Your presence honors us.

237
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,602
And your name might be?

238
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,114
I'm Jesse of Bethlehem.

239
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:54,252
My sons and I would be honored
if you took supper with us.

240
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,380
I'd like to meet your sons.

241
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,986
Will they all be there?

242
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,727
Oh, yes. They'll all be there.

243
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:23,743
- My eldest is Eliab.
- Eliab.

244
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,481
- Then Abinadab.
- Abinadab.

245
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,949
- Shammah.
- Shammah.

246
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,516
- Joel.
- Joel.

247
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:34,090
- Nehemiah.
- Nehemiah.

248
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,954
- Seriah.
- Seriah.

249
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,993
And Azariah.

250
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,993
Azariah.

251
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,059
A fine group.

252
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,045
A fine group. Strong young men.

253
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,176
You must be very proud.

254
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,846
Is this all? Are these all your sons?

255
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,992
Oh, no. My youngest and smallest
stays out overnight with the sheep.

256
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,898
His name is David.

257
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,386
Lord...

258
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,593
... this boy?

259
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,227
Is this the one?

260
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,630
<i>Don 't consider his size or his age. </i>

261
00:27:56,575 --> 00:28:00,011
<i>The Lord sees not as man sees. </i>

262
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,348
<i>Man looks</i>
<i>at the outward appearance. </i>

263
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,577
<i>God sees into the hearts. </i>

264
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,317
Who goes there?

265
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,521
A friend.

266
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,123
My name is Samuel.

267
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:18,190
Are you David?

268
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,761
Samuel the prophet?

269
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,931
Yes.

270
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,433
Please, sir, allow me
to sit with you.

271
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:37,343
I regret having nothing to offer you
except a piece of my blanket.

272
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,989
So you've heard of me?

273
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,453
You anointed our beloved King Saul.

274
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,593
I could tell by your face
the minute I saw you...

275
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,599
... that you were much traveled.

276
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,262
More in the realm of the spirit
than on the surface of the earth.

277
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,807
But those are the best journeys.

278
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:12,178
So you come on business
with my father and brothers?

279
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,850
I was sent by the Lord.

280
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:23,687
The Lord, our God,
has sent me to anoint you...

281
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:27,696
... as the one to rule over all Israel...

282
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,635
... and to build
a great new kingdom.

283
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:39,808
I think I've heard the voice
of God in these hills.

284
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,284
- But this...
- This is God's will.

285
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,892
If it's God's will, then I have
no cause to be troubled.

286
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,119
Then you'll let me anoint you?

287
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,396
What of King Saul...

288
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:02,528
... who has done
so many brave things...

289
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,298
... and has many capable sons already?

290
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,337
What's going to happen to him?

291
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:10,270
Only the Lord God knows Saul's fate.

292
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:51,512
With the blessing...

293
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:54,646
... of almighty God...

294
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:58,622
... honoring the names
of our fathers...

295
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,224
... Abraham...

296
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,388
... Isaac...

297
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:05,693
... and Jacob...

298
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,663
... I anoint you...

299
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:13,329
... king of all Israel...

300
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,173
... King David.

301
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:28,050
The Lord has anointed you
as prince over his people.

302
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,487
Listen to the word of the Lord.

303
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,085
Obey his commandments.

304
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,120
Your enemies will flee...

305
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:38,991
... and your kingdom shall prosper.

306
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:19,403
You don't think God has abandoned me?

307
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,102
I'll be robbed of my crown.

308
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,309
My life.

309
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,404
A sword is at my throat.

310
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,709
Father, some evil spirit is troubling you.

311
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:37,014
Oh, yes, an evil spirit sent
by God himself.

312
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:46,262
It's more than a spirit. Oh, God.

313
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,301
I could see my death.

314
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,881
- Is this the one?
- No.

315
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,713
That's him.

316
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,588
Are you David?

317
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,590
Yes.

318
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,635
It is said your harp playing...

319
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,899
... can charm evil spirits
away from living beings.

320
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,175
You have this gift?

321
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,515
It's God's gift, if it's anyone's.

322
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,816
I am Jonathan.

323
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,354
Will you help my father?

324
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,063
The Lord is my shepherd.

325
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,364
I shall not want.

326
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,606
He makes me lie in green pastures.

327
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,843
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

328
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,517
He restoreth my soul.

329
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:20,758
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

330
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,153
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

331
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,294
... I will fear no evil.

332
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,096
For thou art with me.

333
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,497
Thy rod and thy staff comfort me.

334
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:40,741
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

335
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,072
Thou anointest my head with oil.

336
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,782
My cup runneth over.

337
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:56,992
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life...

338
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:00,923
... and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord...

339
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,993
... forever.

340
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:11,100
Walking through the valley
of the shadow of death.

341
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:17,575
- What's your name?
- David, son of Jesse, my lord king.

342
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:21,312
I like your music.

343
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:23,778
Your words speak to me.

344
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,219
I'm glad, my lord king.

345
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,324
Stay near.

346
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:35,028
You can sleep by my sons.

347
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:39,829
And by day, polish my armor.

348
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,933
And at night, delight the king
with your poems and your playing.

349
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,543
As you wish.

350
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,312
I'm tired.

351
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,682
Very tired.

352
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,820
You can leave me.

353
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,997
For what you've done for my father...

354
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,537
... I will always be grateful to you.

355
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,083
- God bless you and keep you.
- Thank you, Jonathan.

356
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,280
Goliath's killed our best fighters.

357
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,012
- You can't go into battle alone.
- I have to prove I'm still worthy to lead...

358
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,248
... by cutting this Philistine animal
to pieces!

359
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,756
Get my sword.

360
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,757
Father, we cannot afford to lose you.

361
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,864
My lord king, as your loyal servant,
I'll fight this Philistine.

362
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,859
What are you going to do?
Harp him to death?

363
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,039
- David, your loyalty is admirable, but...
- David...

364
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,175
... Goliath is a warrior.
He's trained. He's strong.

365
00:37:58,343 --> 00:37:59,901
He's a killer.

366
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,512
You have no experience
of such a fight.

367
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:06,549
When I kept my father's sheep,
a lion took a lamb from the flock.

368
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:09,551
I went out after him. I killed it.

369
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:11,486
I killed that lion.

370
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:16,422
This Philistine will just be
another animal I'll kill in the same way.

371
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,221
That's what you called him.

372
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,487
The Lord will protect me.

373
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,497
You better take my armor.

374
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,409
- I don't know how to use it.
- What will you use to kill Goliath?

375
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,169
Harsh language?

376
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,442
I will kill him.

377
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:53,530
The Lord be with you.

378
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,124
What's this?

379
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:34,092
The Hebrews are sending children
to face me now?

380
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,632
Go home. I don't kill boys.

381
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,396
And you're not a man.

382
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,408
Come to me, boy.

383
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,940
I'll give your flesh to the birds...

384
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,275
... and your bones to the dogs.

385
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,550
Hey, boy!

386
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,182
Are you too afraid to fight?

387
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,924
You come armed with a sword...

388
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:06,496
... but I come in the name
of the Lord of hosts...

389
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:09,564
... the God of the armies of Israel.

390
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,871
I'm going to kill you.

391
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,345
It's your body that the dogs will eat...

392
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:25,548
... and all the world will know
there is a God in Israel.

393
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,824
My God.

394
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:07,116
Make a joyful noise
unto God all ye lands.

395
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:10,193
Sing forth the honor of his name.

396
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,190
Through the greatness
of thy power...

397
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:16,731
... shall thine enemies
submit themselves unto thee.

398
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,830
- You did it.
- God was with me.

399
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,236
<i>David! David! David!</i>

400
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,311
<i>David! David! David!</i>

401
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,547
Let us see.

402
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,111
- Jonathan, how did it go?
- Good.

403
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,217
- Are you all right?
- Never better, Michal.

404
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,183
And you, David?

405
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,416
Two more of the Philistine army
sleep with their fathers tonight.

406
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:51,187
Does that impress
the daughter of King Saul?

407
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,523
We caught half a dozen of them, Father,
and their mules.

408
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,256
The Philistine women weep...

409
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:58,994
... when they remember the day
David entered our camp.

410
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,973
- How did David do?
- He got two by himself.

411
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,084
You've heard what they're saying.

412
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,044
Yes, uncle.

413
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:21,183
Saul has killed 1000 Philistines...

414
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:23,517
... David, 10,000.

415
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,158
He doesn't discourage such talk.

416
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,362
Perhaps he's the one.

417
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:33,734
Which one, uncle?

418
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:38,404
The one Samuel went in search of.

419
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:45,143
The one who would be
after the Lord's own heart.

420
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,287
Our army loves him.

421
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:55,325
Perhaps such a hero...

422
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,185
... wants to be my son-in-law...

423
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,228
... marry my daughter.

424
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:08,364
I could never pay
such a bride's price...

425
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:10,973
... however much I might wish it.

426
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:14,210
- Father, you...
- Be quiet.

427
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,006
A king knows what his people
and his family are thinking.

428
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,246
The garrison at Gilgal...

429
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:25,755
... it will need to be resupplied soon.

430
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:28,653
Take some men, make sure
those supplies never arrive.

431
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,225
Bring me back the foreskins
of 100 dead Philistines.

432
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,735
That will be a price
for a daughter's hand.

433
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,678
You have honored me
with such a command.

434
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:10,126
Let God arise.
Let his enemies be scattered.

435
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:13,462
Let them also that hate him
flee before him.

436
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:16,640
As smoke is driven away,
so drive them away.

437
00:46:16,808 --> 00:46:20,300
As wax melteth before the fire...

438
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:24,205
... so let the wicked perish...

439
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:27,476
... at the presence of God.

440
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:38,718
Two hundred Philistine foreskins, instead
of the 100 you requested, my lord king.

441
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,732
The price was high.

442
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,172
Definitely a deed of valor...

443
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,841
... worthy of a husband of a princess.

444
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,645
I must prepare myself for your daughter.

445
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,306
I can't greet her with this blood on me.

446
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,621
Tomorrow night, uncle.

447
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:10,420
After the ceremonies.

448
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,528
I know three men
who have no love for David.

449
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:21,363
Blessed art thou, O Lord, our God...

450
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:27,069
... king from eternity,
who creates the fruit of the vine.

451
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,274
She is consecrated.

452
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:38,817
You are consecrated to me...

453
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:42,284
... according to the law of Moses
and of Israel.

454
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,904
You are in grave danger.

455
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,972
You must leave here tonight.

456
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:37,410
Tell me, what's wrong?

457
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:40,513
Don't ask me how I know this...

458
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:44,888
... but Saul intends to take your life.

459
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:09,036
Kill him!

460
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,251
Why?

461
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:19,055
Your maid.

462
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,251
The girl is dead.

463
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,426
Why did you deceive me...

464
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:28,759
... and help my enemy?

465
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:33,567
I have been faithful
to my husband, as I should.

466
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:46,948
- Where is he?
- I had no chance to find out.

467
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:51,419
Your father wants me dead.

468
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,253
What?

469
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:57,160
Michal thinks so, and so do I.

470
00:49:57,328 --> 00:50:00,195
I've done him no harm.
But still he seeks my life.

471
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:03,265
David, you're not in danger.

472
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:07,933
Look, my father would do nothing
without confiding in me.

473
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:11,836
- He has never kept anything from me.
- He knows the love we have for each other.

474
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,443
He knows enough to keep his plans
out of your sight.

475
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:16,204
Don't be naive.

476
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:19,981
David...

477
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,718
... I love you as I love my own soul.

478
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:28,723
Choose any way of testing
my father's intentions towards you.

479
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,085
I will do whatever you ask.

480
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:35,963
- Tomorrow is a feast day.
- Yes.

481
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,059
When he sees
that my seat is empty...

482
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:40,793
... tell him...

483
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:45,040
... that I have gone
on a yearly sacrifice to Bethlehem...

484
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,542
... with my father and brothers.
If he's at peace with that, I'll return.

485
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:52,307
If he's angered,
we'll know he means me harm.

486
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,919
If my father does mean to do you evil...

487
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:05,221
... you will know of it from my lips.

488
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:07,857
I will send you away,
and you will go in peace.

489
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,759
From this day on,
there's a covenant between us.

490
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:15,160
As long as I live, no harm will ever come
to the house of Jonathan.

491
00:51:27,852 --> 00:51:30,343
If we are attacked,
who will organize our defenses?

492
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,594
It's a pity David isn't with us.

493
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:46,160
Where is David?

494
00:51:48,973 --> 00:51:52,465
He's gone to Bethlehem to make
a sacrifice with his family.

495
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:55,405
What is it, Father?

496
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:03,478
David is unclean.

497
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,751
He means me harm.

498
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,495
How can you say that, Father?

499
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:20,767
The mother that bore you
was foul and rebellious!

500
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:23,369
You choose David's life over mine?

501
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,601
Over your own kingdom?

502
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,508
Why do you hate one who has loved
and served you faithfully?

503
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:34,714
He tasks me.

504
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,852
He's like a pebble scratching at my heart!

505
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,894
As I am king, I swear he must die!

506
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:00,574
In a few miles,
you will come to the city of Nob.

507
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,505
The priests there are men of virtue.

508
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:09,085
I must return, help my father
wrestle with his evil spirit.

509
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,346
We've given our oath.

510
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,624
The Lord will always be with you.

511
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,168
I'm grateful for this.

512
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:31,567
Here is the only other thing
I can give you.

513
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,779
The sword of Goliath.

514
00:53:41,185 --> 00:53:44,211
If you have any need of it, it is yours.

515
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:47,586
I can give you nothing in return.

516
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:51,158
We know you have been gallant
in Saul's service...

517
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:53,563
... and we know the Lord is with you.

518
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:56,894
Who's he?

519
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,970
Doeg, the Edomite...

520
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,829
... one of Saul's captains.

521
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,637
Be careful of him.

522
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:24,286
<i>O God, thou art my God. </i>

523
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:27,055
<i>Early will I seek thee. </i>

524
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:29,892
<i>My soul thirsts for thee. </i>

525
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:34,934
<i>My flesh thirsts for thee</i>
<i>in a dry, thirsty land. </i>

526
00:54:35,406 --> 00:54:39,001
<i>Because thy loving kindness</i>
<i>is better than life... </i>

527
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,904
<i>... my lips shall praise thee. </i>

528
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:55,052
David.

529
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,791
Where is he?

530
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:02,160
I do not know where he is,
my lord king.

531
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,633
You've conspired
with David against me.

532
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:08,972
You've given him bread and a sword.

533
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:12,870
You pray to God that he might
rise against me. Do you deny it?

534
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:16,035
Who has been as faithful
to my lord king as David...

535
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:18,247
... that you made your son-in-law?

536
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:20,378
Kill him.

537
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:24,051
Let there be no more traitors.

538
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:26,121
Kill the priests of the Lord...

539
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:28,851
... for their hand is with David.

540
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:47,676
Greetings. I am Joab...

541
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:50,243
... one of the men loyal to David.

542
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,606
I am seeking Nabal.

543
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:54,414
Nabal.

544
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:01,119
- So?
- I am Joab.

545
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:02,948
I come from David.

546
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,888
He asks for your kindness
and generosity.

547
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:09,294
Our King Saul has a warrant
on David's head.

548
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:14,095
David is not welcome here.

549
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:19,933
I ought to slit that pig's throat
from ear to ear.

550
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:21,843
Somebody's coming.

551
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:38,919
I am Abigail,
wife of the man Nabal...

552
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,531
... who has behaved so discourteously
towards you, my lord.

553
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,167
My husband is a fool.

554
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,667
I have brought food
and blankets for your people.

555
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,700
But your first protector is the Lord God.

556
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,704
Please...

557
00:56:58,015 --> 00:57:00,483
... try to take no offense.

558
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:04,351
Don't be drawn into action
by the evil of those who hate you.

559
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,829
Blessed be the Lord
that sent you to me today.

560
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:17,426
Blessed be you
for your wise words.

561
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,202
There is no reason for me
to shed the blood of Nabal.

562
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,800
Thank you, my lord.

563
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,211
That penniless outlaw, David...

564
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:41,382
... dreams he can have a seat
at my table.

565
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,121
The nerve.

566
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:49,396
Saul still has a bounty on David.

567
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:55,004
A message
concerning David's whereabouts...

568
00:57:55,339 --> 00:58:00,276
... is still worth a nice price
in silver shekels.

569
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:06,849
You have no notion
of who David is, do you, Nabal?

570
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:10,445
- What do you mean?
- Those who oppose David oppose God.

571
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:12,552
God.

572
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:15,820
David was a step away
from taking your life.

573
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:23,429
The ground beneath your feet
is ready to give way, Nabal.

574
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,964
Consider this.

575
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:35,606
Abigail, wait!

576
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,611
Abig...

577
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:59,834
Michal has been given
by her father to another man.

578
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,834
You have been alone a long time.

579
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,150
Would you come with me
and be my wife?

580
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,511
You must leave this place.

581
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,716
It seems as if...

582
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:54,749
... every time I've found a place
to rest my head...

583
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,892
... I've had to leave.

584
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,287
Before he died,
Nabal sent word to Saul...

585
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:04,025
... that you could be found
in the hills of Engedi.

586
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,595
You must leave.

587
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:14,800
Good. I'm glad Saul
knows where to find me.

588
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,978
It's time we had a reckoning.

589
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,619
David, wait.

590
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,661
Wait here, uncle.

591
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,861
- Here, Jonathan.
- Yes, Father.

592
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:37,660
This way. We'll stay here the night.

593
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,042
One blow from that spear,
and Saul is dead.

594
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,107
Order me to do it.

595
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,804
Do not do it.

596
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,916
Who can raise his hand
against the one who God anointed?

597
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:29,609
The Lord will take him.

598
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:32,721
His day will come to die,
but not by my hand.

599
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,332
- Abner?
- What is it, uncle?

600
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:46,368
- He was here.
- No, uncle.

601
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:50,600
Abner, you've not done a good job
of guarding your king.

602
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:54,940
Is this the voice of my son David?

603
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:58,008
Where did you hear
that I ever meant you harm?

604
01:01:58,682 --> 01:02:02,209
This day you can see with your eyes
you were given into my hands.

605
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:05,983
Some said to kill you...

606
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:07,781
... but I did not.

607
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,526
I will not raise my hand
against my lord king.

608
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,759
I came this close to you, Saul.

609
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:19,697
Now you must know there is no evil
in my heart towards you.

610
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,663
I have not sinned against you...

611
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,773
... even though you have hunted me
and sought to take my life.

612
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:28,135
The Lord will judge between you and me.

613
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:31,376
Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.

614
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:34,550
But my hand will not rise against you.

615
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,655
Is this your true voice, David, my son?

616
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:41,715
It is, my lord.

617
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:46,089
Then I have sinned.

618
01:02:51,034 --> 01:02:54,333
Return to me, David.

619
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,740
I'll do you no harm...

620
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:02,777
... because my soul is precious
in your eyes tonight.

621
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:06,515
God is with you.

622
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:08,817
You will be king.

623
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:16,926
But swear to me you will not
cut off my sons...

624
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:19,757
... nor destroy the name
of my house.

625
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,363
I swear it.

626
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:29,438
God bless you, David.

627
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,207
You will do great things.

628
01:03:42,686 --> 01:03:44,950
Be merciful to me, O God.

629
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:49,419
Be merciful to me,
for in you my soul takes refuge.

630
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:52,526
In the shadow of your wings
I will take refuge...

631
01:03:52,696 --> 01:03:55,494
... till the storms
of destruction pass by.

632
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,252
Nathan...

633
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:22,155
... God makes it hard to be a king.

634
01:04:24,728 --> 01:04:26,355
You must help him.

635
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:32,391
Listen to what I tell you.

636
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:34,560
You must tell him...

637
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:37,605
... stay close to God.

638
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:39,336
Close.

639
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:42,672
You know he's God's choice.

640
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,012
Samuel worried about you, David.

641
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:23,650
Even on his deathbed.

642
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:28,947
He told me to warn you of Saul,
not to believe his promises of peace.

643
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:32,524
The evil spirit within Saul
can return at any time.

644
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:35,727
You will be like a lamp
to the people of Israel...

645
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,593
... for the Lord is with you.

646
01:05:37,901 --> 01:05:39,596
That is what Samuel said.

647
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:42,905
All of Israel will miss him, Nathan.

648
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:46,767
It was also his wish that I go with you
and be a teacher to you...

649
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,309
... and help you hear the word
of the Lord.

650
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:53,078
His last words were, " Help David.

651
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,751
God makes it hard to be a king. "

652
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,454
David.

653
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:34,818
David.

654
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:38,091
The Amalekites kidnapped
your wife, Abigail.

655
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:40,695
The women went
to the stream to wash...

656
01:06:40,964 --> 01:06:42,932
... and a bunch of Amalekite raiders
took them.

657
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,124
Round up the men.
We'll pursue them at once.

658
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,382
The women are up there.

659
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:14,363
Here, Leah, you take this.

660
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,260
You harlot!

661
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:18,700
You'll be sorry you did this.

662
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,928
We'll get no good price
for the wife of David!

663
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,404
<i>O Lord God... </i>

664
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:28,968
<i>... to whom vengeance belongeth... </i>

665
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,741
<i>... show thyself. </i>

666
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,543
<i>Thou judge of the Earth... </i>

667
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:39,278
<i>... render a reward to the proud. </i>

668
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:44,383
<i>Lord, how long</i>
<i>shall the wicked triumph?</i>

669
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:37,574
The Philistine armies of Achish
are massing in all directions.

670
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:41,408
We must either abandon Gilboa
or think of a strategy...

671
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:44,144
... for breaking through their lines.
- How?

672
01:08:48,358 --> 01:08:50,553
How can I decide what to do...

673
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,455
... when I cannot reach my God?

674
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:54,927
God wants us to live.

675
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:58,600
No.

676
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:03,599
Only him who speaks to God...

677
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:05,570
... can be certain what to do.

678
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:09,972
Who would that be, Father?

679
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,504
The prophet Samuel, of course.

680
01:09:12,682 --> 01:09:15,173
- He's dead.
- I know he's dead.

681
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:20,051
Nevertheless, I must speak to him.

682
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:26,156
A witch.

683
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:28,158
What?

684
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:31,529
A witch could bring Samuel
back from the other world.

685
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:33,168
No, you can't!

686
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:34,969
Can't?

687
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:39,966
Our army stands on the brink
of annihilation!

688
01:09:40,443 --> 01:09:42,809
I must have counsel of him
that speaks to God.

689
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:44,541
It's a sin.

690
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:46,581
So I've sinned.

691
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,541
At least I'll have spoken to God again.

692
01:09:58,161 --> 01:10:00,561
- Who's there?
- We mean no harm.

693
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:02,931
- We're travelers.
- Travelers?

694
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:13,174
Woman, I...

695
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:15,944
... know of your powers.

696
01:10:17,147 --> 01:10:20,173
Can you bring back someone
known to me from the other world?

697
01:10:20,351 --> 01:10:22,251
Are you mad?

698
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:27,447
You know King Saul of the Israelites
has forbidden such practices.

699
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:31,089
I guarantee you will not be punished
by this Saul.

700
01:10:36,267 --> 01:10:37,598
And what will you pay?

701
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:02,424
Who was he and when did he die?

702
01:11:04,128 --> 01:11:05,789
The prophet Samuel.

703
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:07,759
Six months ago.

704
01:12:01,852 --> 01:12:03,342
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?

705
01:12:04,254 --> 01:12:06,779
You are King Saul. You tricked me.

706
01:12:06,957 --> 01:12:08,288
No, no.

707
01:12:17,301 --> 01:12:18,598
Samuel.

708
01:12:21,071 --> 01:12:22,629
Saul.

709
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:26,471
Why have you brought me here?

710
01:12:27,077 --> 01:12:29,170
Why do you disturb my rest?

711
01:12:29,413 --> 01:12:31,381
I had to talk to you.

712
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,374
My army is in jeopardy.

713
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:38,587
God has left me.

714
01:12:39,923 --> 01:12:41,447
Only you can tell me what to do.

715
01:12:41,959 --> 01:12:43,620
If God has left you...

716
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:45,690
... what can I do?

717
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:48,963
The Lord has taken your kingdom.

718
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,229
And he intends it for David.

719
01:12:51,402 --> 01:12:52,699
No.

720
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:56,139
Now he has left you to the Philistines.

721
01:12:56,306 --> 01:12:58,365
- No.
- Tomorrow...

722
01:12:58,742 --> 01:13:01,802
... you and your sons will be with me.

723
01:13:01,979 --> 01:13:03,844
No!

724
01:13:04,114 --> 01:13:05,979
No!

725
01:14:02,139 --> 01:14:03,538
We attack!

726
01:14:03,774 --> 01:14:05,002
But we are so few.

727
01:14:05,242 --> 01:14:08,302
Remember the day we drove
the Philistine raiders from the village?

728
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:10,640
- That was a good day.
- Today will be such a day.

729
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:13,180
The spirit of God is with us again?

730
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,483
The spirit of God is with us today.

731
01:15:01,732 --> 01:15:03,427
Forward!

732
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:37,766
Run.

733
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,732
Jonathan. Jonathan.

734
01:17:51,902 --> 01:17:53,267
Kill me.

735
01:17:53,603 --> 01:17:55,070
Kill me.

736
01:17:55,739 --> 01:17:57,730
Don't let them take me.

737
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:14,516
Kill me.

738
01:18:37,314 --> 01:18:39,805
Jonathan!

739
01:18:45,188 --> 01:18:46,849
Jonathan!

740
01:18:56,066 --> 01:18:58,159
Kill me!

741
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:31,963
<i>Saul and Jonathan</i>
<i>were swifter than eagles. </i>

742
01:19:32,335 --> 01:19:34,769
<i>They were stronger than lions. </i>

743
01:19:35,305 --> 01:19:38,331
<i>And in their death, </i>
<i>they were not divided. </i>

744
01:19:39,743 --> 01:19:43,736
<i>How are the mighty fallen</i>
<i>in the midst of battle. </i>

745
01:19:58,061 --> 01:19:59,289
David.

746
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:01,123
You are anointed of God.

747
01:20:03,033 --> 01:20:05,194
You must be our king.

748
01:20:27,591 --> 01:20:31,391
<i>Thou shalt not be afraid</i>
<i>of the terrors by night... </i>

749
01:20:31,761 --> 01:20:35,094
<i>... nor of the arrows that flieth by day... </i>

750
01:20:35,465 --> 01:20:38,764
<i>... nor of the destruction</i>
<i>that wasteth at noonday. </i>

751
01:20:39,436 --> 01:20:43,236
<i>He shall give his angels charge</i>
<i>over thee... </i>

752
01:20:43,406 --> 01:20:46,375
<i>... to keep thee in all thy ways. </i>

753
01:21:24,381 --> 01:21:26,645
Here we are in the great city
of Jerusalem...

754
01:21:26,816 --> 01:21:28,579
... which is so rich in building stone.

755
01:21:28,752 --> 01:21:31,619
Here I'm gonna build the greatest temple
the world has ever seen...

756
01:21:31,788 --> 01:21:35,189
... to house the Ark of the Covenant
as is fit and proper.

757
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:39,161
I'm afraid there's a problem
with that, my lord king.

758
01:21:40,196 --> 01:21:41,754
What kind of a problem?

759
01:21:42,032 --> 01:21:43,932
The Lord God has spoken to me of this.

760
01:21:44,234 --> 01:21:46,668
And what has he said?

761
01:21:47,537 --> 01:21:48,970
He said:

762
01:21:50,373 --> 01:21:52,637
"I have not dwelt in any house
since the time...

763
01:21:52,809 --> 01:21:55,471
... I brought the children of Israel
out of Egypt.

764
01:21:58,081 --> 01:21:59,776
I have walked in a tent...

765
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:02,043
... and have not complained or said:

766
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:05,185
'Why have you not built me
a house of Cedar? '"

767
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:08,787
It is not for you, David, to name
what God can demand for himself.

768
01:22:08,959 --> 01:22:10,756
I only want to honor him.

769
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:15,597
God knows this...

770
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:17,730
... and he loves you for it.

771
01:22:19,269 --> 01:22:20,702
He said:

772
01:22:21,705 --> 01:22:23,570
"Tell my servant, David...

773
01:22:23,807 --> 01:22:25,604
... I took you from the sheepfold...

774
01:22:25,775 --> 01:22:27,606
... to be ruler of Israel.

775
01:22:28,645 --> 01:22:31,045
I have appointed
a place for your people.

776
01:22:31,247 --> 01:22:33,044
A place of their own...

777
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:36,576
... where they may live and move no more.

778
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,087
As to a house for me...

779
01:22:39,255 --> 01:22:41,587
... it will come
when your days are fulfilled...

780
01:22:41,825 --> 01:22:44,157
... and you sleep with your fathers.

781
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,000
I will take one of your seed...

782
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:54,395
... and establish his kingdom.

783
01:23:02,579 --> 01:23:05,912
But my mercy shall not depart
away from him...

784
01:23:06,082 --> 01:23:08,573
... as I took it from Saul
to make room for you.

785
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:13,247
Your house and your kingdom...

786
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:15,287
... shall be established forever. "

787
01:23:16,893 --> 01:23:18,121
And...

788
01:23:18,561 --> 01:23:19,960
<i>: : :my son : : :

789
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:22,198
... will build a temple for the Lord?

790
01:23:22,899 --> 01:23:24,127
Yes.

791
01:23:30,874 --> 01:23:32,102
<i>And... </i>

792
01:23:32,609 --> 01:23:33,837
<i>... my son... </i>

793
01:23:34,277 --> 01:23:36,575
<i>... will build a temple for the Lord?</i>

794
01:23:36,913 --> 01:23:38,540
<i>Yes. </i>

795
01:24:26,996 --> 01:24:29,123
There's a woman living
just a stone's throw...

796
01:24:29,299 --> 01:24:31,062
... from the east corner
of this house.

797
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:34,101
That's Uriah the Hittite's house,
my lord king.

798
01:24:34,671 --> 01:24:37,162
You are referring to his wife,
Bathsheba.

799
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:41,771
Uriah, a fine soldier.

800
01:24:42,445 --> 01:24:45,937
- Hasn't Joab gone to join him at Rabbah?
- Yes, my lord king.

801
01:24:48,151 --> 01:24:49,812
Have...

802
01:24:50,687 --> 01:24:53,053
- Bathsheba?
... Bathsheba...

803
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:56,520
... join me after you've cleared
away the meal.

804
01:25:32,762 --> 01:25:34,286
Welcome to my home, Bathsheba.

805
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:53,778
Your husband is a brave soldier.

806
01:25:58,454 --> 01:26:00,945
Thank you, my lord king.

807
01:26:17,574 --> 01:26:20,008
Do you know the reason you're here?

808
01:26:26,649 --> 01:26:28,378
The sight of me...

809
01:26:29,752 --> 01:26:32,346
... pleased you.
- You saw me watching you?

810
01:26:32,522 --> 01:26:33,750
I did not, my lord.

811
01:26:35,758 --> 01:26:37,385
It was a feeling.

812
01:26:40,263 --> 01:26:41,491
A strange feeling.

813
01:26:44,334 --> 01:26:46,063
I could sense...

814
01:26:46,236 --> 01:26:47,703
... someone watching me.

815
01:26:48,304 --> 01:26:51,239
Something you know somehow
without knowing how.

816
01:27:01,618 --> 01:27:03,609
I am married, my lord.

817
01:27:04,687 --> 01:27:06,746
Do you love your husband?

818
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,226
As it is a wife's duty
to love her husband.

819
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:23,671
You're not answering my question.

820
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:27,468
Perhaps it is the way you ask it.

821
01:27:30,046 --> 01:27:31,775
Does he live...

822
01:27:32,582 --> 01:27:34,140
... in your heart...

823
01:27:34,984 --> 01:27:37,077
... as one unique spirit
that speaks to you?

824
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:48,796
I'm afraid...

825
01:27:49,132 --> 01:27:51,930
... to break our laws
of marriage, my lord.

826
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:07,776
And I am afraid...

827
01:28:08,785 --> 01:28:11,015
... to refuse my king.

828
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:17,024
Especially when he is as great as you.

829
01:29:24,594 --> 01:29:26,289
Thank you, Joseph.

830
01:29:49,218 --> 01:29:51,448
I am troubled, my lord.

831
01:29:52,455 --> 01:29:54,389
What is it, Bathsheba?

832
01:29:58,728 --> 01:30:00,218
My lord...

833
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:05,657
... I carry your child.

834
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:30,184
I want you to bring back
my lieutenant, Uriah...

835
01:30:30,393 --> 01:30:32,725
... with a report
on the battle at Rabbah.

836
01:30:33,763 --> 01:30:35,355
Yes, my lord king.

837
01:31:06,762 --> 01:31:08,787
The Ammonites send
scouting parties...

838
01:31:08,965 --> 01:31:11,160
... that we have
a hard time catching.

839
01:31:11,434 --> 01:31:14,961
Their knowledge of those hills
is better than ours.

840
01:31:17,573 --> 01:31:19,768
And finally, Joab...

841
01:31:20,076 --> 01:31:21,407
... does he inspire the men?

842
01:31:21,577 --> 01:31:23,636
He's respected, my lord king.

843
01:31:25,248 --> 01:31:26,738
Well, then...

844
01:31:26,916 --> 01:31:29,942
... thank you very much
for your honesty, Uriah.

845
01:31:31,354 --> 01:31:32,753
You can go home now...

846
01:31:33,022 --> 01:31:34,353
... bathe.

847
01:31:35,658 --> 01:31:37,853
Spend some time with your wife.

848
01:31:49,505 --> 01:31:51,564
Lay my blanket on the ground.

849
01:31:53,476 --> 01:31:56,775
I will be here in the courtyard
near my men <i>:

850
01:31:56,979 --> 01:31:58,742
Yes, sir.

851
01:32:02,251 --> 01:32:03,775
Good night, sir.

852
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,767
Uriah.

853
01:32:20,703 --> 01:32:22,193
I...

854
01:32:23,439 --> 01:32:24,997
I gave you permission to go home.

855
01:32:26,275 --> 01:32:28,004
The Ark lives in a tent...

856
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:30,542
... and my fellow soldiers
sleep in the open fields.

857
01:32:32,815 --> 01:32:36,512
It's wrong for me to go to a house
and enjoy the comforts of a wife.

858
01:32:38,854 --> 01:32:41,015
Uriah, you're a man
after my own heart.

859
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:43,522
It's my duty as a soldier,
my lord king.

860
01:32:45,494 --> 01:32:47,792
You must stay a few more days
in Jerusalem.

861
01:32:48,664 --> 01:32:51,360
You must come feast with me.
Good night.

862
01:32:51,801 --> 01:32:53,393
Good night, my lord king.

863
01:33:55,064 --> 01:33:56,292
Have some more wine.

864
01:33:58,367 --> 01:33:59,732
It's good, isn't it?

865
01:34:00,336 --> 01:34:02,531
The finest, my lord.

866
01:34:09,545 --> 01:34:10,978
You should go home now.

867
01:34:11,313 --> 01:34:12,610
Enjoy yourself.

868
01:34:12,815 --> 01:34:14,373
See your wife.

869
01:34:15,484 --> 01:34:16,974
I'm sure it's been a long time.

870
01:34:20,389 --> 01:34:22,584
I would, my lord, but...

871
01:34:23,459 --> 01:34:24,824
But I'm tired.

872
01:35:05,935 --> 01:35:07,766
He's here, my lord king.

873
01:35:20,483 --> 01:35:21,973
Uriah...

874
01:35:22,651 --> 01:35:24,551
... you are to return to Rabbah...

875
01:35:25,054 --> 01:35:26,749
... and give this...

876
01:35:27,156 --> 01:35:28,783
... to Joab.

877
01:35:36,198 --> 01:35:37,665
Uriah.

878
01:35:37,867 --> 01:35:39,095
My lord king.

879
01:35:47,476 --> 01:35:48,807
I'd like you...

880
01:35:49,211 --> 01:35:50,769
... to have this.

881
01:35:53,215 --> 01:35:54,443
Thank you, my lord.

882
01:35:55,151 --> 01:35:56,584
Thank you.

883
01:36:37,993 --> 01:36:39,756
Uriah, welcome!

884
01:37:00,249 --> 01:37:02,376
<i>Joab, greetings from your king. </i>

885
01:37:02,551 --> 01:37:04,985
<i>The bearer of this letter is Uriah, </i>
<i>your lieutenant. </i>

886
01:37:05,654 --> 01:37:09,886
<i>With respect to Uriah, place him</i>
<i>in the hottest part of the battle... </i>

887
01:37:10,059 --> 01:37:12,994
<i>... where he is most likely to be killed. </i>

888
01:37:36,886 --> 01:37:40,117
I hate these patrols.
There are scouts all around the place.

889
01:37:40,289 --> 01:37:42,052
Quiet, you men.

890
01:38:56,799 --> 01:38:58,391
My lady.

891
01:39:01,437 --> 01:39:03,405
I bring you the sword
of a very brave man.

892
01:40:44,473 --> 01:40:46,031
No.

893
01:41:25,714 --> 01:41:28,706
The sword devours one man
as well as another.

894
01:41:29,051 --> 01:41:31,212
There's no reason for these things.

895
01:41:34,957 --> 01:41:36,424
May I weep...

896
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:38,316
... my lord?

897
01:41:39,161 --> 01:41:40,628
Of course.

898
01:41:43,232 --> 01:41:44,665
But also...

899
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:46,624
... remember...

900
01:41:47,836 --> 01:41:49,064
... Uriah died...

901
01:41:49,538 --> 01:41:51,233
... as he would have wished...

902
01:41:51,406 --> 01:41:53,067
... gallantly...

903
01:41:53,242 --> 01:41:56,234
... Ioyal to his king and his people.

904
01:41:59,381 --> 01:42:01,747
That's a good death for a soldier.

905
01:42:01,917 --> 01:42:04,647
No way her husband dies...

906
01:42:05,187 --> 01:42:07,985
... is good for his wife, my lord.

907
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,065
Your feeling...

908
01:42:20,269 --> 01:42:21,896
... for Uriah...

909
01:42:23,238 --> 01:42:24,466
... makes me jealous.

910
01:42:27,943 --> 01:42:29,706
But you have my heart.

911
01:42:33,882 --> 01:42:35,440
You know that.

912
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:47,087
There is one blessing.

913
01:42:49,431 --> 01:42:51,626
We can acknowledge our child.

914
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:04,937
Oh, that is fortunate for the child.

915
01:43:06,381 --> 01:43:07,609
And for you?

916
01:43:17,492 --> 01:43:21,019
I will do as you command.

917
01:43:30,405 --> 01:43:32,270
Then we shall marry.

918
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:41,973
And as a wedding gift, Hiram of Galilee
has sent 200 heads of cattle.

919
01:43:42,217 --> 01:43:44,685
Well, thank him.

920
01:43:45,821 --> 01:43:50,224
And finally, your prophet Nathan has
a legal matter for you to dispose of.

921
01:44:01,803 --> 01:44:05,295
My lord, I would ask that you hear
this matter in private.

922
01:44:06,341 --> 01:44:07,638
Very well.

923
01:44:07,809 --> 01:44:09,436
You may leave us, Joseph.

924
01:44:12,514 --> 01:44:14,345
Now, Nathan...

925
01:44:14,983 --> 01:44:16,245
... tell me about this case.

926
01:44:21,056 --> 01:44:24,025
There are two men in a nearby city.

927
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:27,424
One rich, the other poor.

928
01:44:28,196 --> 01:44:31,256
The rich man has many sheep,
many cattle.

929
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,030
The poor one has nothing...

930
01:44:34,202 --> 01:44:37,365
... except for one little ewe lamb
he's raised up since birth...

931
01:44:37,673 --> 01:44:40,073
... like it was one of his own children.

932
01:44:41,009 --> 01:44:43,603
And yet, the rich man...

933
01:44:43,879 --> 01:44:47,906
... has taken up the poor man's
one little ewe lamb to slaughter...

934
01:44:50,018 --> 01:44:51,417
... and sell as his own.

935
01:44:52,888 --> 01:44:54,856
There's only one answer to this.

936
01:44:55,424 --> 01:44:58,552
The rich man must give
the poor man one whole flock...

937
01:44:58,994 --> 01:45:00,757
... and then he must die.

938
01:45:03,432 --> 01:45:05,229
What was the name of this rich man?

939
01:45:07,235 --> 01:45:09,829
I want to know so I can see
to his punishment personally.

940
01:45:16,078 --> 01:45:17,943
You are that man.

941
01:45:27,322 --> 01:45:28,550
What do you mean?

942
01:45:30,459 --> 01:45:32,188
God has given you everything:

943
01:45:32,394 --> 01:45:34,487
Houses, wives, soldiers...

944
01:45:34,663 --> 01:45:36,688
... and a great name among the nations.

945
01:45:36,865 --> 01:45:39,993
If you needed more from him,
you had only to ask.

946
01:45:40,202 --> 01:45:41,430
Instead...

947
01:45:41,636 --> 01:45:44,969
... you used the Ammonite sword
to kill Uriah and took his wife.

948
01:45:46,775 --> 01:45:49,437
Now the sword will never depart
from your house.

949
01:45:49,611 --> 01:45:51,670
And God has said:

950
01:45:51,847 --> 01:45:55,510
"Thou will raise up evil against you
out of your own house. "

951
01:46:06,728 --> 01:46:08,457
I have sinned.

952
01:46:09,531 --> 01:46:11,328
Does it mean that I must die?

953
01:46:11,633 --> 01:46:13,658
You shall not die...

954
01:46:13,969 --> 01:46:17,427
... but the child born between you
and the wife of Uriah...

955
01:46:17,839 --> 01:46:19,636
... shall surely die.

956
01:46:50,338 --> 01:46:51,566
How is my wife?

957
01:46:54,342 --> 01:46:55,707
Well...

958
01:46:55,977 --> 01:46:57,501
... my king.

959
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:03,848
And how is my child?

960
01:47:07,155 --> 01:47:09,419
Your child is thriving.

961
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:12,355
You feel him kick?

962
01:47:18,099 --> 01:47:20,260
He wants to see his father.

963
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,754
Unless there's any news,
leave me alone.

964
01:47:40,922 --> 01:47:44,858
I'm going outside to fast
and ask God's mercy.

965
01:47:56,004 --> 01:47:58,234
Have mercy upon me, O God.

966
01:47:59,007 --> 01:48:01,771
According to thy loving kindness.

967
01:48:03,044 --> 01:48:04,978
According to thy tender mercies.

968
01:48:06,147 --> 01:48:08,638
Wipe out my transgressions.

969
01:48:08,884 --> 01:48:11,546
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.

970
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:14,018
Cleanse me for my sin.

971
01:48:15,223 --> 01:48:17,248
For I acknowledge...

972
01:48:17,492 --> 01:48:18,789
... my transgressions.

973
01:48:27,102 --> 01:48:29,002
Create in me...

974
01:48:29,437 --> 01:48:31,302
... a clean heart...

975
01:48:32,107 --> 01:48:35,235
... and renew a right spirit within me.

976
01:48:37,045 --> 01:48:38,740
Do not cast me from your presence.

977
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:44,750
Do not take your holy spirit from me.

978
01:49:20,522 --> 01:49:22,217
The child?

979
01:49:24,225 --> 01:49:25,852
Dead, my lord king.

980
01:50:20,582 --> 01:50:22,812
I say it again, dear God.

981
01:50:23,151 --> 01:50:25,745
Create in me a clean heart...

982
01:50:26,021 --> 01:50:28,854
... and renew a right spirit.

983
01:50:47,242 --> 01:50:51,042
You fasted and wept for your child
while it was alive.

984
01:50:54,082 --> 01:50:56,050
But when the child dies...

985
01:50:56,384 --> 01:50:57,715
... you eat a meal.

986
01:50:59,087 --> 01:51:00,918
When the child was alive...

987
01:51:01,523 --> 01:51:02,854
... I fasted...

988
01:51:03,224 --> 01:51:04,521
... because I said to myself:

989
01:51:04,693 --> 01:51:08,629
"Who can tell whether God
will be gracious and let the child live?"

990
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:14,095
But the child is dead.

991
01:51:15,937 --> 01:51:18,098
Why should I continue to fast?

992
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:21,308
Can I bring him back?

993
01:51:24,446 --> 01:51:26,107
I can go to him...

994
01:51:26,648 --> 01:51:28,843
... but he cannot return to me.

995
01:51:56,377 --> 01:51:57,810
Forgive me...

996
01:52:03,284 --> 01:52:05,411
... for the loss of your son.

997
01:52:05,854 --> 01:52:07,253
It is I...

998
01:52:07,522 --> 01:52:09,922
... who must beg your forgiveness.

999
01:52:12,761 --> 01:52:14,160
Why?

1000
01:52:30,812 --> 01:52:32,302
I...

1001
01:52:33,314 --> 01:52:34,611
... plotted...

1002
01:52:35,049 --> 01:52:37,017
... the death of Uriah.

1003
01:52:39,187 --> 01:52:40,415
The Lord...

1004
01:52:40,655 --> 01:52:43,488
... took our child in judgment.

1005
01:52:53,334 --> 01:52:55,461
My child...

1006
01:52:57,238 --> 01:52:58,830
... died...

1007
01:52:59,107 --> 01:53:02,508
... on account of Uriah's innocent blood?

1008
01:53:06,514 --> 01:53:07,742
You...

1009
01:53:08,082 --> 01:53:12,246
... the great King David,
favorite of God, and God...

1010
01:53:12,554 --> 01:53:14,488
... did this to you?

1011
01:53:16,191 --> 01:53:17,818
I sinned.

1012
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:24,295
I pray that he will forgive me.

1013
01:53:26,768 --> 01:53:28,827
There's nothing else I can do.

1014
01:53:35,844 --> 01:53:37,505
I sinned too.

1015
01:53:41,416 --> 01:53:45,045
If I had not desired you as well,
none of this would have happened.

1016
01:53:48,857 --> 01:53:50,085
And whatever...

1017
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:53,224
... judgment God makes...

1018
01:53:59,067 --> 01:54:01,262
... we'll face it together.

1019
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:24,219
Do you remember the day...

1020
01:54:24,692 --> 01:54:26,489
... when I asked you...

1021
01:54:27,028 --> 01:54:28,620
... if Uriah lived...

1022
01:54:28,863 --> 01:54:32,264
... in your heart as one unique spirit
that spoke to you?

1023
01:54:42,777 --> 01:54:44,540
I remember.

1024
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:48,449
There is a man that feels
that way about you.

1025
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:50,840
He feels...

1026
01:54:52,921 --> 01:54:55,082
... you are the one unique spirit...

1027
01:54:55,456 --> 01:54:58,152
... he is destined to walk with forever.

1028
01:55:00,028 --> 01:55:02,622
I know you are that man.

1029
01:56:25,913 --> 01:56:27,437
<i>Solomon. </i>

1030
01:56:43,031 --> 01:56:44,623
Let God arise.

1031
01:56:44,999 --> 01:56:47,058
Let his enemies be scattered.

1032
01:56:48,636 --> 01:56:50,467
But let the righteous...

1033
01:56:50,638 --> 01:56:52,037
... be glad.

1034
01:56:52,206 --> 01:56:53,798
Let them rejoice.

1035
01:56:54,442 --> 01:56:56,569
A father for the fatherless
is the Lord.

1036
01:56:58,413 --> 01:57:00,745
God setteth the solitary in families.

1037
01:57:01,883 --> 01:57:04,215
I am gathered happily
with my wives, Michal...

1038
01:57:04,919 --> 01:57:06,477
... Abigail...

1039
01:57:06,654 --> 01:57:08,087
... and Bathsheba...

1040
01:57:08,256 --> 01:57:10,053
... and all of our children.

1041
01:57:10,558 --> 01:57:12,025
Allow us, Lord...

1042
01:57:12,193 --> 01:57:14,923
... to live out our lives
together in peace...

1043
01:57:15,263 --> 01:57:16,821
... and harmony.

1044
01:57:24,138 --> 01:57:26,402
What are you doing?
You're up to something.

1045
01:57:26,808 --> 01:57:29,208
Wait and see. Wait and see.

1046
01:57:29,377 --> 01:57:30,605
It's Tamar, isn't it?

1047
01:57:30,812 --> 01:57:32,143
Eat this.

1048
01:57:33,414 --> 01:57:36,611
- Doesn't my sister look magnificent?
- Yeah, she does.

1049
01:57:36,818 --> 01:57:38,513
Tamar, what are you doing?

1050
01:57:39,387 --> 01:57:41,252
That's servant's work.

1051
01:57:41,456 --> 01:57:44,857
You sometimes forget
you are the daughter of a king.

1052
01:57:45,026 --> 01:57:46,823
It's woman's work.

1053
01:57:48,930 --> 01:57:51,455
Whoever I am,
I'm still a woman, aren't I?

1054
01:57:51,899 --> 01:57:53,730
Bathsheba, what do you think?

1055
01:57:53,901 --> 01:57:56,665
Should a princess carry out
the duties of a handmaiden?

1056
01:57:56,838 --> 01:57:59,636
It is the privilege of a princess
to please herself.

1057
01:57:59,807 --> 01:58:03,208
If she enjoys woman's work,
let her enjoy it.

1058
01:58:03,377 --> 01:58:04,844
And remember...

1059
01:58:05,012 --> 01:58:08,209
... the only food I can bless
is what she serves me.

1060
01:58:08,382 --> 01:58:10,316
Let me go, brother.

1061
01:58:10,718 --> 01:58:12,686
That tickles.

1062
01:58:15,756 --> 01:58:17,348
David is our father...

1063
01:58:17,592 --> 01:58:19,560
... but our mothers were different.

1064
01:58:19,727 --> 01:58:21,285
You're joking, Amnon.

1065
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:25,695
- I'm not.
- I think you should be.

1066
01:58:25,867 --> 01:58:29,303
Touch her, and the wrath of Absalom
would fall onto you like rain.

1067
01:58:29,470 --> 01:58:31,836
Not to mention your father's.

1068
01:58:32,673 --> 01:58:35,267
I've gotten around Absalom all my life.

1069
01:58:36,277 --> 01:58:37,505
He's easy.

1070
01:58:47,486 --> 01:58:48,748
Good move, Absalom.

1071
01:59:03,802 --> 01:59:04,962
It's all right.

1072
01:59:12,444 --> 01:59:14,241
That's enough, Amnon.

1073
01:59:19,184 --> 01:59:21,209
Don't mind losing, Absalom.

1074
01:59:21,553 --> 01:59:23,214
We all still love you.

1075
01:59:26,758 --> 01:59:29,750
It seems to me as though Amnon
is going to be the soldier.

1076
01:59:30,562 --> 01:59:32,792
And Absalom, the poet.

1077
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,592
How do you both feel about that?

1078
01:59:37,035 --> 01:59:38,400
Whatever you say, Father.

1079
01:59:41,073 --> 01:59:42,836
Can't we be like you, Father?

1080
01:59:44,142 --> 01:59:45,507
Can't we be both?

1081
02:00:12,204 --> 02:00:14,297
- Tamar.
- Brother.

1082
02:00:28,353 --> 02:00:30,321
I rode her too hard.

1083
02:00:30,856 --> 02:00:32,721
Her leg is broken.

1084
02:00:35,761 --> 02:00:37,626
It's better she not suffer.

1085
02:00:52,377 --> 02:00:54,311
Have you slept with a man, Tamar?

1086
02:00:55,781 --> 02:00:57,942
What a strange question, brother.

1087
02:00:58,417 --> 02:00:59,782
I'm unmarried.

1088
02:00:59,951 --> 02:01:01,782
Of course I'm a virgin.

1089
02:01:02,087 --> 02:01:03,452
I'm not married.

1090
02:01:03,622 --> 02:01:05,112
I've slept with women.

1091
02:01:05,557 --> 02:01:06,922
You're a man.

1092
02:01:07,092 --> 02:01:09,026
It's expected of men.

1093
02:01:09,694 --> 02:01:11,321
It is a great, great pleasure...

1094
02:01:11,496 --> 02:01:14,624
... to lie in bed with a man
who longs to touch you.

1095
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:18,225
When my husband
takes me to that bed...

1096
02:01:18,570 --> 02:01:20,970
... I'll find out all about it.

1097
02:01:22,808 --> 02:01:24,275
She's pure, Amnon.

1098
02:01:24,443 --> 02:01:26,070
Why does it have to be her?

1099
02:01:26,244 --> 02:01:28,872
You could have handmaidens
by the dozen.

1100
02:01:29,047 --> 02:01:30,742
I have to be with her...

1101
02:01:31,583 --> 02:01:33,175
... or I'll die.

1102
02:01:37,089 --> 02:01:39,148
Do you really mean that?

1103
02:01:39,324 --> 02:01:41,019
I do.

1104
02:01:42,461 --> 02:01:43,792
Look at you.

1105
02:01:44,129 --> 02:01:46,791
You're even starting to look ill.

1106
02:01:47,132 --> 02:01:48,759
I'm not surprised.

1107
02:01:49,501 --> 02:01:51,401
I feel lovesick.

1108
02:02:07,819 --> 02:02:10,549
- What?
- I think I have an idea.

1109
02:02:11,490 --> 02:02:15,790
Stay here. You're about to become
quite a bit sicker.

1110
02:02:29,374 --> 02:02:31,604
Jonodab, what's ailing Amnon?

1111
02:02:32,277 --> 02:02:35,007
He seems to have eaten some meat
with worms, my lord king.

1112
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:36,408
He's taken to his bed.

1113
02:02:36,715 --> 02:02:38,876
Nothing serious, I hope.

1114
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:40,881
He's requested a remedy.

1115
02:02:41,052 --> 02:02:43,612
Has he? What?

1116
02:02:43,788 --> 02:02:47,053
He's very fond of the honey cakes
as Tamar prepares them.

1117
02:02:47,225 --> 02:02:49,250
He wonders if she might
come to his room...

1118
02:02:49,427 --> 02:02:52,294
... and prepare some of these
in her own special way.

1119
02:02:52,464 --> 02:02:54,261
How is that with you, girl?

1120
02:02:54,432 --> 02:02:56,764
If it will help my brother
and his illness...

1121
02:02:56,935 --> 02:02:58,698
... I'd be glad to, Father.

1122
02:03:17,222 --> 02:03:19,690
I love watching you cook.

1123
02:03:46,218 --> 02:03:48,152
Now eat, brother. You'll feel better.

1124
02:03:49,154 --> 02:03:50,382
Feed me.

1125
02:03:50,689 --> 02:03:52,122
Let me eat from your hand.

1126
02:04:05,537 --> 02:04:06,970
I love you, Tamar.

1127
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:09,304
As a brother should.

1128
02:04:10,175 --> 02:04:11,437
I want you.

1129
02:04:14,145 --> 02:04:17,239
As a man wants a woman.

1130
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:30,550
Don't force me.

1131
02:04:30,795 --> 02:04:32,888
You know it is against
every law of God.

1132
02:04:33,064 --> 02:04:34,326
Don't worry.

1133
02:04:36,167 --> 02:04:38,362
I won't hurt you.

1134
02:04:38,970 --> 02:04:40,460
If this was right...

1135
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:43,665
... you could ask Father's permission.
- Silence.

1136
02:04:44,609 --> 02:04:45,974
No.

1137
02:05:06,865 --> 02:05:08,196
Get out, will you, please?

1138
02:05:11,603 --> 02:05:13,366
Please...

1139
02:05:13,538 --> 02:05:15,768
... say a kind word to me.

1140
02:05:18,376 --> 02:05:20,503
I can't have whores in my room...

1141
02:05:20,679 --> 02:05:23,580
... after they've performed
their services.

1142
02:05:28,219 --> 02:05:29,652
Whores?

1143
02:05:32,324 --> 02:05:34,349
I thought you said you loved me.

1144
02:05:50,275 --> 02:05:51,708
Get out.

1145
02:06:06,624 --> 02:06:08,558
Tamar.

1146
02:06:09,794 --> 02:06:12,957
Brother. Help me. Please help me.

1147
02:06:13,131 --> 02:06:14,621
- Help me.
- What is it, sister?

1148
02:06:14,799 --> 02:06:16,027
Amnon.

1149
02:06:20,405 --> 02:06:21,997
Tell me.

1150
02:06:36,187 --> 02:06:38,087
Absalom, what is it?

1151
02:07:10,355 --> 02:07:11,583
You have sinned...

1152
02:07:13,491 --> 02:07:14,822
... against me...

1153
02:07:15,093 --> 02:07:16,651
... against your family...

1154
02:07:17,529 --> 02:07:18,757
... against God.

1155
02:07:23,134 --> 02:07:25,830
You have no place in my army
or my court.

1156
02:07:26,304 --> 02:07:29,000
You will not be in my presence
at meals or at prayers.

1157
02:07:29,174 --> 02:07:30,937
You are, from now on...

1158
02:07:31,209 --> 02:07:32,767
... in disgrace.

1159
02:07:37,449 --> 02:07:40,282
Take my cattle to market
at Hebron, and that's all you do...

1160
02:07:40,452 --> 02:07:42,545
... for this family and this nation.

1161
02:07:54,532 --> 02:07:57,467
Tamar's soul lies in pieces,
and Amnon still lives?

1162
02:07:57,802 --> 02:07:59,429
He is my son...

1163
02:07:59,604 --> 02:08:02,334
... and your brother.
- He raped your daughter.

1164
02:08:02,507 --> 02:08:04,338
We put men to death for much less.

1165
02:08:04,509 --> 02:08:05,999
It is my decision.

1166
02:08:10,215 --> 02:08:12,479
My decisions are law.

1167
02:08:12,650 --> 02:08:15,642
Another example of your mercy, Father?
It's part of your legend.

1168
02:08:18,756 --> 02:08:21,850
I must be able to forgive
my own flesh and blood.

1169
02:08:22,293 --> 02:08:24,420
So must you.

1170
02:08:25,430 --> 02:08:29,059
It's not mercy, Absalom.
It's how a family, how a nation survives.

1171
02:08:32,070 --> 02:08:33,298
Absalom.

1172
02:08:38,076 --> 02:08:39,976
If we cannot find a way...

1173
02:08:40,144 --> 02:08:43,136
... past the sins we commit,
we cannot live.

1174
02:08:46,317 --> 02:08:49,309
Now, show me that you
understand my wisdom.

1175
02:08:50,889 --> 02:08:52,356
Embrace me.

1176
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:33,258
Cheer up, brother.

1177
02:09:33,431 --> 02:09:35,262
The work isn't so rough.

1178
02:09:35,433 --> 02:09:38,095
What have you got
to be so happ y about, brother?

1179
02:09:38,269 --> 02:09:41,033
It doesn't humiliate you
chasing cattle all day?

1180
02:09:41,306 --> 02:09:42,705
Don't worry about me.

1181
02:09:42,874 --> 02:09:45,399
- I won't be doing this for much longer.
- You won't?

1182
02:09:45,944 --> 02:09:48,037
I'll find my way back into the court.

1183
02:09:48,212 --> 02:09:50,874
Father will soften his judgment
against me.

1184
02:09:51,215 --> 02:09:52,546
Do you know why?

1185
02:09:52,717 --> 02:09:56,346
He'll forgive anyone just to win back
one more person's love.

1186
02:09:56,754 --> 02:09:58,984
Father's not satisfied with God's love.

1187
02:09:59,190 --> 02:10:01,158
He wants everyone else
to love him as well.

1188
02:10:02,427 --> 02:10:04,861
You have us all figured out, Amnon.

1189
02:10:05,630 --> 02:10:07,598
I know Father. That's all.

1190
02:10:08,666 --> 02:10:09,928
And all this...

1191
02:10:10,101 --> 02:10:11,500
... while my sister, Tamar...

1192
02:10:11,669 --> 02:10:15,002
... eats dirt and babbles
like a sick child...

1193
02:10:15,773 --> 02:10:17,331
... because of you.

1194
02:10:18,042 --> 02:10:19,600
You took her soul.

1195
02:10:19,777 --> 02:10:22,337
I can't believe
I'm hearing this rubbish.

1196
02:10:22,614 --> 02:10:24,775
She's a woman, Absalom.

1197
02:10:25,116 --> 02:10:26,606
Women are weak.

1198
02:10:26,951 --> 02:10:28,612
Women are born to suffer.

1199
02:10:48,473 --> 02:10:49,804
This is good.

1200
02:10:53,511 --> 02:10:55,342
Come on.

1201
02:10:55,513 --> 02:10:58,641
Come here, my pretty.
Let's dance. Come on.

1202
02:11:00,918 --> 02:11:02,351
Come on. Come on.

1203
02:11:03,354 --> 02:11:04,821
Come closer.

1204
02:11:07,458 --> 02:11:08,686
Oh, come on.

1205
02:11:10,228 --> 02:11:11,593
It's so good.

1206
02:11:12,296 --> 02:11:14,230
Come on. You want to play?

1207
02:11:22,206 --> 02:11:25,300
When the wine has weakened Amnon,
strike him and kill him.

1208
02:11:30,948 --> 02:11:33,644
Come back. Come back. Come here.

1209
02:12:17,528 --> 02:12:19,223
- Tamar.
- What is it, brother?

1210
02:12:19,397 --> 02:12:20,830
Amnon is dead.

1211
02:12:21,032 --> 02:12:23,000
I had him killed.

1212
02:12:23,768 --> 02:12:25,793
Report this to our father.

1213
02:12:26,370 --> 02:12:27,667
I have killed Amnon...

1214
02:12:27,839 --> 02:12:29,966
... in just judgment
for what he did to you.

1215
02:12:31,609 --> 02:12:32,906
Tell Father...

1216
02:12:33,111 --> 02:12:35,136
... I know I must be lost to him...

1217
02:12:35,313 --> 02:12:37,747
... for disobeying his command
and doing this.

1218
02:12:38,983 --> 02:12:41,008
Perhaps I shall never see him again.

1219
02:12:41,986 --> 02:12:44,511
Nevertheless, I still love him.

1220
02:12:44,789 --> 02:12:46,051
I shall love him forever.

1221
02:12:47,158 --> 02:12:48,819
Say goodbye to him for me...

1222
02:12:50,094 --> 02:12:51,789
... and to all of Jerusalem.

1223
02:12:54,432 --> 02:12:56,764
I will never forget
what you've given up for me.

1224
02:13:05,209 --> 02:13:09,578
O God, you have made the earth tremble.

1225
02:13:10,381 --> 02:13:12,110
You have broken it.

1226
02:13:13,651 --> 02:13:15,175
Heal the breaches...

1227
02:13:15,353 --> 02:13:17,947
... for the earth shakes beneath our feet.

1228
02:13:22,593 --> 02:13:24,356
You've cast us off.

1229
02:13:25,096 --> 02:13:26,893
You have scattered us.

1230
02:13:28,132 --> 02:13:30,066
Oh, please.

1231
02:13:30,234 --> 02:13:32,600
Turn yourself to us again.

1232
02:13:40,411 --> 02:13:42,538
I'm saddened for you, my lord king.

1233
02:13:44,649 --> 02:13:47,777
Feeling sorry for me is turning
into a full-time occupation for you.

1234
02:13:48,119 --> 02:13:51,418
You have given me and the nation
much reason to celebrate as well.

1235
02:13:53,257 --> 02:13:56,192
That's God. Not me.

1236
02:13:57,662 --> 02:13:59,186
Amen.

1237
02:14:17,148 --> 02:14:18,581
Do you think...

1238
02:14:18,749 --> 02:14:22,082
... that once God starts punishing a man,
he will ever stop?

1239
02:14:24,088 --> 02:14:26,818
Perhaps it is those
who God loves the most...

1240
02:14:27,158 --> 02:14:29,524
... those on whom he lavishes his gifts...

1241
02:14:29,694 --> 02:14:31,594
... that he punishes the most severely.

1242
02:14:31,863 --> 02:14:33,956
The price of God's glory.

1243
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:39,133
Remember what Samuel told me
all those years ago.

1244
02:14:39,637 --> 02:14:41,104
"Help David.

1245
02:14:41,305 --> 02:14:43,671
God makes it hard to be a king. "

1246
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:55,345
This is the woman in mourning
from Tekoah...

1247
02:14:55,519 --> 02:14:57,384
... who bids you to give her judgment.

1248
02:14:57,555 --> 02:14:59,580
Yes. Ask her to come in.

1249
02:15:11,569 --> 02:15:12,968
Help me, please...

1250
02:15:13,137 --> 02:15:14,604
... my lord king.

1251
02:15:15,806 --> 02:15:17,535
What seems to be the problem?

1252
02:15:17,708 --> 02:15:19,039
I am a widow.

1253
02:15:19,410 --> 02:15:20,900
I had two sons.

1254
02:15:21,245 --> 02:15:23,179
They worked the fields together.

1255
02:15:23,547 --> 02:15:24,946
And they quarreled.

1256
02:15:25,116 --> 02:15:26,708
And one killed the other.

1257
02:15:31,389 --> 02:15:33,186
Go on.

1258
02:15:35,393 --> 02:15:37,588
All the rest of my family...

1259
02:15:37,762 --> 02:15:41,528
... bid me to punish
my surviving son harshly.

1260
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:44,363
But if I do that...

1261
02:15:44,535 --> 02:15:46,298
... I will have no heir.

1262
02:15:46,470 --> 02:15:50,065
And my husband's name
will disappear from the earth.

1263
02:15:51,242 --> 02:15:53,233
I will have nothing.

1264
02:15:56,647 --> 02:16:00,913
Whoever tries to force you
to take your remaining son's life...

1265
02:16:01,085 --> 02:16:04,054
... shall be brought to me,
and I will deal with them.

1266
02:16:11,762 --> 02:16:13,093
No one else will bother you.

1267
02:16:15,032 --> 02:16:17,796
Thank you, my lord king.

1268
02:16:18,936 --> 02:16:21,200
God will respect no man...

1269
02:16:21,505 --> 02:16:24,963
... unless he devises some way
for those children he has lost...

1270
02:16:25,409 --> 02:16:27,240
... to be brought back to him.

1271
02:17:10,021 --> 02:17:12,615
The man wants you
to judge him, my lord king.

1272
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:15,088
He was burning the tents
outside the city gates...

1273
02:17:15,259 --> 02:17:17,284
... and trying to drain our water supply.

1274
02:17:17,528 --> 02:17:19,496
Who on earth would do
such a stupid thing?

1275
02:17:19,663 --> 02:17:21,062
Bring him in.

1276
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:31,340
Well?

1277
02:17:31,509 --> 02:17:33,943
I can only ask forgiveness
and understanding...

1278
02:17:34,111 --> 02:17:36,579
... in the words of a prayer
my father made.

1279
02:17:37,014 --> 02:17:39,278
May I speak my father's words?

1280
02:17:42,953 --> 02:17:44,284
Go ahead.

1281
02:17:45,656 --> 02:17:48,557
"Deliver me from blood-guiltiness,
O my God...

1282
02:17:48,793 --> 02:17:51,887
... and my tongue shall sing aloud
of thy righteousness.

1283
02:17:52,663 --> 02:17:54,927
Create in me a clean heart...

1284
02:17:55,232 --> 02:17:57,962
... and renew a right spirit within me. "

1285
02:17:59,637 --> 02:18:01,002
Those are my words.

1286
02:18:21,826 --> 02:18:25,125
He's not our child.
But he is my son, precious to me.

1287
02:18:25,296 --> 02:18:28,788
"Behold, I will raise up evil
from thine house. "

1288
02:18:29,867 --> 02:18:32,233
How easily you forget
the prophet's message.

1289
02:18:34,805 --> 02:18:36,705
I know what you're thinking.

1290
02:18:37,575 --> 02:18:40,476
You think that with Absalom
permanently in disgrace...

1291
02:18:40,644 --> 02:18:42,635
... my favor would fall on Solomon.

1292
02:18:45,950 --> 02:18:49,113
I am not planning the succession, David.

1293
02:18:49,720 --> 02:18:51,915
Simply consider this.

1294
02:18:52,656 --> 02:18:56,285
Absalom has already shed
his own brother's blood.

1295
02:18:56,460 --> 02:18:59,395
- What is he capable of next?
- He's my son!

1296
02:19:03,968 --> 02:19:05,765
Promises between men.

1297
02:19:06,036 --> 02:19:08,800
Or contracts between merchants
or treaties between nations.

1298
02:19:08,973 --> 02:19:10,964
These can be broken
if advantage demands it.

1299
02:19:11,142 --> 02:19:14,407
But the covenant between
a father and a son can never end.

1300
02:19:17,214 --> 02:19:20,650
No matter what Absalom did,
I can never stop being his father.

1301
02:19:22,720 --> 02:19:26,383
If he does something wrong,
it is because I failed to teach him.

1302
02:19:27,324 --> 02:19:30,657
He is mine, as you are mine.

1303
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:37,795
As I am God's.

1304
02:19:42,473 --> 02:19:46,034
May I ask you a frank question,
my lord prince?

1305
02:19:46,210 --> 02:19:47,507
Please.

1306
02:19:48,546 --> 02:19:50,912
If you were king...

1307
02:19:52,249 --> 02:19:54,683
... would you have judged
the actions of Amnon...

1308
02:19:54,852 --> 02:19:57,821
... and your own deeds
as lightly as David did?

1309
02:19:57,988 --> 02:20:01,355
David faces the law
and the commands of his heart...

1310
02:20:01,525 --> 02:20:04,119
... and always finds a way
to disobey the law.

1311
02:20:05,129 --> 02:20:06,391
You...

1312
02:20:06,764 --> 02:20:09,598
... chose the law over your own blood.

1313
02:20:10,569 --> 02:20:12,833
That tells me you are strong enough...

1314
02:20:13,004 --> 02:20:15,199
... to properly lead the nation.

1315
02:20:15,574 --> 02:20:17,599
Don't speak any more of these things...

1316
02:20:17,809 --> 02:20:19,242
... Aphitophel.

1317
02:20:19,611 --> 02:20:22,842
These words are already written
in your own heart.

1318
02:20:23,381 --> 02:20:26,873
It is because of David's mercy
that I am alive at this moment.

1319
02:20:27,886 --> 02:20:29,979
If the roles had been reversed...

1320
02:20:30,155 --> 02:20:34,057
... you would have been strong enough
to order your son's punishment.

1321
02:20:34,226 --> 02:20:37,423
That is something you have never
forgiven your father for.

1322
02:20:37,629 --> 02:20:39,358
For that weakness...

1323
02:20:39,798 --> 02:20:41,493
... he calls mercy.

1324
02:20:41,833 --> 02:20:43,960
What if all you say is true,
what then?

1325
02:20:47,105 --> 02:20:49,699
Watch the elders of the tribes
and the army.

1326
02:20:50,508 --> 02:20:52,408
How they view your father.

1327
02:20:53,044 --> 02:20:56,707
There's an opportunity for you
if you only seize it.

1328
02:20:58,583 --> 02:21:00,778
With the gold we lavish on David...

1329
02:21:00,952 --> 02:21:03,011
... there's no money left for food.

1330
02:21:03,355 --> 02:21:06,222
It would be one thing
if we could see an end to the sacrifice.

1331
02:21:06,391 --> 02:21:08,757
But with your father,
there is no reasoning.

1332
02:21:10,829 --> 02:21:12,091
There was a time...

1333
02:21:12,397 --> 02:21:15,560
... when being a member
of David's army...

1334
02:21:15,734 --> 02:21:17,031
... meant respect.

1335
02:21:17,502 --> 02:21:20,232
He even shortchanges us
to pay for his temple now.

1336
02:21:20,405 --> 02:21:24,034
The Assyrians and Moabites
are taking ground from us every day.

1337
02:21:24,209 --> 02:21:26,734
- Something has to be done.
- Yes, but what?

1338
02:21:26,911 --> 02:21:28,538
The men can't take it anymore.

1339
02:21:28,847 --> 02:21:32,044
I know, but the longer we stand here
and wait and do nothing...

1340
02:21:32,217 --> 02:21:33,775
... the worse the situation gets.

1341
02:21:33,952 --> 02:21:36,819
You may answer
this question honestly.

1342
02:21:37,789 --> 02:21:40,349
If Israel had a new ruler...

1343
02:21:40,525 --> 02:21:43,153
<i>: : :a</i> younger man
who would rebuild the army...

1344
02:21:43,328 --> 02:21:46,661
... who would let the villagers
keep more of their wealth...

1345
02:21:46,965 --> 02:21:48,455
... would you men...

1346
02:21:48,633 --> 02:21:49,895
... support him?

1347
02:21:53,371 --> 02:21:55,202
How badly do we stand with the army?

1348
02:21:55,373 --> 02:21:58,604
Nearly two-thirds of the soldiers on foot
in the Southern part...

1349
02:21:58,777 --> 02:22:00,142
... have gone over to Absalom.

1350
02:22:00,312 --> 02:22:04,180
Half of the farmers of the villages
hereabouts have gone over to him as well.

1351
02:22:04,983 --> 02:22:06,280
And in the north?

1352
02:22:06,484 --> 02:22:08,884
The tribes of Israel
on the other side of the Jordan?

1353
02:22:09,054 --> 02:22:11,215
Reports of their loyalty
are still unconfirmed.

1354
02:22:13,391 --> 02:22:18,727
Aphitophel has guided Absalom brilliantly.

1355
02:22:18,897 --> 02:22:22,355
Am I correct that here in Jerusalem
is where we're at our most vulnerable?

1356
02:22:22,534 --> 02:22:23,762
Yes, my lord.

1357
02:22:25,937 --> 02:22:28,201
If we were Philistines
or Egyptians, Joab...

1358
02:22:28,373 --> 02:22:31,240
... now would be the perfect time
for us to take poison.

1359
02:22:34,279 --> 02:22:36,042
What do you think, Nathan?

1360
02:22:36,948 --> 02:22:41,351
Do you think God loves Absalom enough
to see him take my life and my crown?

1361
02:22:42,787 --> 02:22:44,550
I do not, my lord king.

1362
02:22:45,056 --> 02:22:47,149
God wants you to survive.

1363
02:22:50,362 --> 02:22:52,353
You're like a lamp for his people.

1364
02:23:08,747 --> 02:23:12,513
We will not defend Jerusalem.

1365
02:23:14,619 --> 02:23:16,814
You will not defend Jerusalem?

1366
02:23:20,992 --> 02:23:23,756
Absalom has a superior fighting force.

1367
02:23:24,229 --> 02:23:26,629
I've spent 15 years,
the best years of my life...

1368
02:23:26,798 --> 02:23:29,289
... building this city
into the capital of the nation.

1369
02:23:29,734 --> 02:23:32,134
I'm not gonna let all I've accomplished
get burned...

1370
02:23:32,303 --> 02:23:34,464
... in a few days of bloody fighting.

1371
02:23:34,639 --> 02:23:37,665
That's one sin against God
I know at least not to commit.

1372
02:23:39,911 --> 02:23:42,277
So, what do you propose?

1373
02:23:43,681 --> 02:23:44,978
We head for the north.

1374
02:23:45,283 --> 02:23:49,686
Find those men who are loyal
to David and Joab, if there are any.

1375
02:23:51,389 --> 02:23:55,325
We will not sacrifice Jerusalem
for these troubles.

1376
02:24:14,112 --> 02:24:15,545
I fear...

1377
02:24:16,214 --> 02:24:17,909
... for those who must stay...

1378
02:24:18,082 --> 02:24:19,811
... and face the generosity...

1379
02:24:19,984 --> 02:24:21,474
... of Absalom.

1380
02:24:23,788 --> 02:24:26,382
You don't need to tell me
that you warned me about him.

1381
02:24:26,558 --> 02:24:28,025
I remember that.

1382
02:24:29,861 --> 02:24:32,352
You've been right about
almost everything, Bathsheba.

1383
02:24:32,530 --> 02:24:35,192
From the very first moment
you entered this palace.

1384
02:24:38,536 --> 02:24:40,265
And you may very well ask...

1385
02:24:40,638 --> 02:24:42,333
... if I knew...

1386
02:24:42,507 --> 02:24:44,134
... all the punishments...

1387
02:24:44,309 --> 02:24:46,504
... that were gonna be heaped upon us...

1388
02:24:46,678 --> 02:24:48,578
... would I still have gone toward you?

1389
02:25:01,593 --> 02:25:04,084
It is a question better not asked.

1390
02:25:06,798 --> 02:25:08,322
I love you.

1391
02:25:15,473 --> 02:25:17,270
I love you too.

1392
02:25:24,782 --> 02:25:26,181
I'm sorry.

1393
02:25:27,485 --> 02:25:29,578
So sorry for your city.

1394
02:25:34,592 --> 02:25:39,620
Keep not thy silence, O God.
Hold not thy peace and be not still.

1395
02:25:40,265 --> 02:25:42,597
Thine enemies make a tumult.

1396
02:25:42,767 --> 02:25:45,429
They that hate thee
have lifted their heads.

1397
02:25:46,437 --> 02:25:49,099
They have taken crafty counsel
against thy people.

1398
02:25:49,274 --> 02:25:52,175
They have said, "Come, let us
cut them off from their nation...

1399
02:25:52,343 --> 02:25:56,643
... that the name of Israel
may be no more in remembrance. "

1400
02:25:57,081 --> 02:26:01,450
Fill their faces with shame
that they may seek thy name, O Lord.

1401
02:26:03,555 --> 02:26:05,921
Fill their faces with shame.

1402
02:26:13,197 --> 02:26:14,528
David.

1403
02:26:16,968 --> 02:26:18,196
David.

1404
02:26:19,237 --> 02:26:21,797
My tribe of Gittite people
wish to join you.

1405
02:26:21,973 --> 02:26:24,134
My road is long and hard, lttai.

1406
02:26:24,709 --> 02:26:28,167
You and your people will be safe here.
You've only lived here a short time.

1407
02:26:28,446 --> 02:26:31,506
And if you remain,
you will continue to have my blessing.

1408
02:26:31,683 --> 02:26:33,617
We are your servants.

1409
02:26:33,785 --> 02:26:37,721
But we have sworn an oath
to your kingdom.

1410
02:26:37,889 --> 02:26:39,550
And the kingdom of David...

1411
02:26:39,724 --> 02:26:41,191
... is wherever David is.

1412
02:26:41,693 --> 02:26:44,594
Thank you, lttai.
I am glad of your support.

1413
02:26:56,374 --> 02:26:59,172
Zadok, the Ark must remain
in the city.

1414
02:26:59,344 --> 02:27:00,743
But, my lord king...

1415
02:27:00,945 --> 02:27:03,413
... it cannot fall into Absalom's hands.

1416
02:27:05,116 --> 02:27:07,141
If I find favor with God...

1417
02:27:07,385 --> 02:27:09,853
... I will return to Jerusalem
and see the Ark again.

1418
02:27:10,021 --> 02:27:11,249
If not...

1419
02:27:11,422 --> 02:27:13,822
... it will offer me no protection
against Absalom.

1420
02:27:15,393 --> 02:27:16,860
Nathan?

1421
02:27:19,097 --> 02:27:20,758
You're right, my lord king.

1422
02:27:20,932 --> 02:27:22,194
The Ark must remain.

1423
02:28:17,121 --> 02:28:18,645
Bahurim.

1424
02:28:18,823 --> 02:28:21,519
Maybe we'll find someone
who sympathizes with us up there.

1425
02:28:21,693 --> 02:28:23,058
Let's go on ahead.

1426
02:28:38,009 --> 02:28:39,567
Go away!

1427
02:28:39,744 --> 02:28:42,269
Get out of here! We curse you!

1428
02:28:50,354 --> 02:28:52,254
Why do you throw stones at us?

1429
02:28:53,458 --> 02:28:56,154
If you hate us, why don't you join
Absalom in Jerusalem?

1430
02:28:56,527 --> 02:28:58,791
I am Shimei, the Benjamite.

1431
02:28:58,996 --> 02:29:00,930
Nephew of Abner and Jonathan.

1432
02:29:02,834 --> 02:29:06,736
And we curse both David
and his son Absalom.

1433
02:29:08,573 --> 02:29:11,542
You have Saul's blood on your hands.

1434
02:29:11,976 --> 02:29:14,809
You have stolen his kingdom
like a thief.

1435
02:29:15,646 --> 02:29:18,672
And if your son turns on you
like a thief as well...

1436
02:29:18,850 --> 02:29:20,442
... then God is just.

1437
02:29:20,618 --> 02:29:22,916
And you are a bloody man.

1438
02:29:28,826 --> 02:29:30,054
Now turn away.

1439
02:29:30,228 --> 02:29:33,629
You'll find nowhere to hide
here in Bahurim.

1440
02:30:26,017 --> 02:30:27,507
Order me, my lord king...

1441
02:30:27,685 --> 02:30:31,212
... to take a few guards into Bahurim
and pay Shimei a visit.

1442
02:30:31,689 --> 02:30:35,386
Why should we let that dead dog
curse you and live another day?

1443
02:30:36,727 --> 02:30:39,696
Let me go over there
and take off his head.

1444
02:30:41,098 --> 02:30:43,726
No doubt he too thinks
he has God's blessing.

1445
02:30:45,436 --> 02:30:48,837
It seems as though a lot of men thrive
on hating me at the moment.

1446
02:30:49,173 --> 02:30:51,300
The Benjamites at least
have some reason.

1447
02:30:52,343 --> 02:30:54,971
Compared with Absalom,
who is my own flesh and blood.

1448
02:30:57,982 --> 02:30:59,882
Let Shimei and his men...

1449
02:31:00,051 --> 02:31:02,144
... curse me and throw stones at me.

1450
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:07,218
God may see our afflictions and repay us
with good for what we're suffering.

1451
02:31:12,430 --> 02:31:13,658
Like Saul...

1452
02:31:13,831 --> 02:31:16,857
... you're still letting
those who hate you flourish.

1453
02:31:17,435 --> 02:31:21,064
It is a policy that is harming us
to this day.

1454
02:31:22,206 --> 02:31:24,936
I have a few ideas about fighting back.

1455
02:31:27,712 --> 02:31:30,476
Send for that friend of Aphitophel's.

1456
02:31:30,681 --> 02:31:32,239
Hushai, I think his name is.

1457
02:31:47,965 --> 02:31:49,796
Hushai, my lord king.

1458
02:31:51,669 --> 02:31:53,534
You called for me, my lord king?

1459
02:31:54,472 --> 02:31:56,565
You study with Nathan and Zadok?

1460
02:31:57,275 --> 02:31:58,640
Yes, my lord king.

1461
02:31:59,110 --> 02:32:02,273
You are known to the one
who calls himself Absalom's advisor...

1462
02:32:02,446 --> 02:32:03,845
... Aphitophel?

1463
02:32:04,048 --> 02:32:05,538
Yes.

1464
02:32:13,491 --> 02:32:17,222
I'm going to ask you to do something
you might find painful, Hushai.

1465
02:32:17,695 --> 02:32:19,253
Ask, my lord king.

1466
02:32:19,864 --> 02:32:22,765
I want you to return
to the comfort of Jerusalem.

1467
02:32:23,768 --> 02:32:26,328
But I want to be here
with you and Nathan.

1468
02:32:26,537 --> 02:32:28,198
You cannot help me here.

1469
02:32:28,906 --> 02:32:30,134
But...

1470
02:32:30,308 --> 02:32:32,208
... if you can get close to Absalom...

1471
02:32:32,510 --> 02:32:35,172
... you may defeat
the counsels of Aphitophel.

1472
02:32:37,882 --> 02:32:39,110
I see, my lord king.

1473
02:32:39,984 --> 02:32:41,349
Go to Jerusalem.

1474
02:32:42,019 --> 02:32:43,680
Go now.

1475
02:32:55,132 --> 02:32:57,259
The Council of Elders, my lord king.

1476
02:32:59,670 --> 02:33:01,228
My lord king.

1477
02:33:02,006 --> 02:33:03,871
The Council of Elders wants to know...

1478
02:33:04,041 --> 02:33:06,805
... will you stop collecting tribute
for the temple?

1479
02:33:07,144 --> 02:33:08,543
For the time being...

1480
02:33:08,713 --> 02:33:12,046
... all your tribute will go towards
strengthening the army.

1481
02:33:12,416 --> 02:33:15,476
My father is a cruel, old leopard.

1482
02:33:15,686 --> 02:33:17,244
He has to be hunted down...

1483
02:33:17,421 --> 02:33:19,480
... cornered and killed.

1484
02:33:20,358 --> 02:33:22,588
That is the first work of the nation.

1485
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:24,921
Nothing else can be accomplished...

1486
02:33:25,096 --> 02:33:27,894
... until David is no longer a threat.

1487
02:33:28,065 --> 02:33:30,226
Agreed, my lord king.

1488
02:33:35,039 --> 02:33:36,939
Absalom.

1489
02:33:49,253 --> 02:33:51,187
Absalom.

1490
02:33:52,156 --> 02:33:54,317
You are Ahimaz, nephew of Zadok...

1491
02:33:54,492 --> 02:33:56,119
... priest to David.

1492
02:33:56,894 --> 02:33:58,759
- Who says so?
- Your king.

1493
02:33:58,929 --> 02:34:01,557
Your true king, David,
may require a service from you.

1494
02:34:02,433 --> 02:34:03,798
Be ready.

1495
02:34:22,386 --> 02:34:25,583
The young priest, Hushai,
would like to greet the king.

1496
02:34:37,101 --> 02:34:39,035
The king recognizes in Hushai...

1497
02:34:39,203 --> 02:34:42,195
... a brilliant student of Nathan and Zadok.

1498
02:34:46,110 --> 02:34:49,136
Are you comfortable
in swearing loyalty to me?

1499
02:34:49,980 --> 02:34:52,813
I am a great believer
in youth and power.

1500
02:34:54,452 --> 02:34:56,010
The Lord favored David...

1501
02:34:56,187 --> 02:34:59,054
... when he was young
and fought a weak king.

1502
02:34:59,857 --> 02:35:01,222
Now Absalom...

1503
02:35:01,392 --> 02:35:03,792
... is similarly favored.

1504
02:35:09,934 --> 02:35:11,526
Well spoken.

1505
02:35:55,446 --> 02:35:59,212
On the other side of that door
are three of David's concubines.

1506
02:35:59,917 --> 02:36:02,112
Take them tonight, all of them.

1507
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:05,750
That way, you will fulfill
the prophecy...

1508
02:36:06,123 --> 02:36:09,286
... and everyone will know
that what once was David's...

1509
02:36:09,860 --> 02:36:11,725
... is now yours.

1510
02:36:20,004 --> 02:36:21,767
Solomon.

1511
02:36:28,145 --> 02:36:29,544
The news is not good?

1512
02:36:29,713 --> 02:36:33,012
None of the villagers this close
to Jerusalem want to join us.

1513
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:36,549
In fact, nobody in this area is prepared
to meet with the regular army.

1514
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:38,210
Won't they give us any food?

1515
02:36:38,722 --> 02:36:40,121
They're afraid.

1516
02:36:40,291 --> 02:36:42,020
Absalom has troops everywhere.

1517
02:36:43,394 --> 02:36:46,591
Our only hope are the tribes of Judea
on the other side of the river.

1518
02:36:46,764 --> 02:36:48,789
- We're too weak for a river crossing.
- David.

1519
02:36:49,300 --> 02:36:51,962
If Absalom catches you
with the river at your back...

1520
02:36:52,570 --> 02:36:54,037
... he will annihilate you.

1521
02:36:57,107 --> 02:37:01,043
We should pursue David
with all our forces now.

1522
02:37:01,212 --> 02:37:03,772
Tonight. While he's weary.

1523
02:37:03,948 --> 02:37:07,543
And with little support,
we can kill him without many losses.

1524
02:37:09,653 --> 02:37:11,985
Hushai, what do you say?

1525
02:37:13,791 --> 02:37:15,418
I think my learned friend is wrong.

1526
02:37:16,927 --> 02:37:18,952
You know that your father and Joab...

1527
02:37:19,129 --> 02:37:22,098
... and their best men
are still strong soldiers.

1528
02:37:23,033 --> 02:37:24,330
You strike at them now...

1529
02:37:25,069 --> 02:37:26,934
... they're like a wounded bear...

1530
02:37:27,404 --> 02:37:30,373
... ready to put up their angriest,
bloodiest fight.

1531
02:37:31,208 --> 02:37:35,872
If ever there was a time when David
would be likely to frighten your men...

1532
02:37:36,580 --> 02:37:38,013
... it's now.

1533
02:37:38,649 --> 02:37:41,049
My counsel...

1534
02:37:41,218 --> 02:37:42,446
... is to wait.

1535
02:37:44,855 --> 02:37:48,757
Let all the men of Israel
from Dan to Sheba join you.

1536
02:37:49,260 --> 02:37:50,955
You will fall on him then...

1537
02:37:51,262 --> 02:37:53,196
... like a hard rain.

1538
02:38:11,315 --> 02:38:14,250
I accept Hushai's counsel.

1539
02:38:16,787 --> 02:38:18,254
We will wait.

1540
02:38:18,856 --> 02:38:20,380
We wouldn't want it to be said...

1541
02:38:20,557 --> 02:38:23,651
... that slaughter was the purpose
of Absalom's rule.

1542
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:44,777
- Can you run?
- Yes.

1543
02:38:44,948 --> 02:38:47,314
Run to David's camp
just north of Bahurim.

1544
02:38:47,518 --> 02:38:49,850
Tell him he must cross
the river without delay.

1545
02:38:50,020 --> 02:38:52,887
I don't know how much longer
Absalom will heed my counsel.

1546
02:38:53,057 --> 02:38:55,150
- Can you remember all of that?
- Yes, I can.

1547
02:38:55,326 --> 02:38:56,691
Then run.

1548
02:39:26,757 --> 02:39:28,725
Who is that?

1549
02:39:36,100 --> 02:39:37,431
This is Ahimaz.

1550
02:39:37,601 --> 02:39:40,229
Blood kin to Zadok and loyal to you,
my lord king.

1551
02:39:40,404 --> 02:39:42,395
- Yes?
- My lord king...

1552
02:39:42,573 --> 02:39:44,905
... I have news
from your servant, Hushai.

1553
02:39:45,376 --> 02:39:46,900
Come in, come in.

1554
02:42:40,918 --> 02:42:43,250
We will commence
the war against David...

1555
02:42:43,720 --> 02:42:45,415
... in Aphitophel's honor...

1556
02:42:45,722 --> 02:42:46,950
... at sunrise.

1557
02:42:49,259 --> 02:42:50,487
My lord king...

1558
02:42:50,727 --> 02:42:52,627
... please welcome Shobi of Rabbah...

1559
02:42:52,829 --> 02:42:54,126
... Machir of Lodebar...

1560
02:42:54,298 --> 02:42:56,232
... and Brarzilla of Rogelim.

1561
02:42:56,667 --> 02:42:58,692
They all head militias of their villages.

1562
02:42:58,869 --> 02:43:00,803
And they're all prepared
to fight for us.

1563
02:43:00,971 --> 02:43:02,336
We are honored to help...

1564
02:43:02,806 --> 02:43:04,068
... my lord king.

1565
02:43:04,975 --> 02:43:06,943
You'll each take one half of the force...

1566
02:43:07,110 --> 02:43:08,805
... and I will lead.
- No.

1567
02:43:08,979 --> 02:43:10,310
You can't.

1568
02:43:10,981 --> 02:43:12,505
Why not?

1569
02:43:12,683 --> 02:43:14,082
If you are with us...

1570
02:43:14,251 --> 02:43:15,946
... and the battle goes poorly...

1571
02:43:16,286 --> 02:43:18,379
... they will kill all of us to get to you.

1572
02:43:20,023 --> 02:43:21,786
If you are not seen on the field...

1573
02:43:22,459 --> 02:43:24,324
... we may survive a defeat
well enough...

1574
02:43:24,494 --> 02:43:26,121
... to fight another day.

1575
02:43:26,930 --> 02:43:28,454
Ittai, what do you think?

1576
02:43:28,932 --> 02:43:30,160
I agree.

1577
02:43:33,704 --> 02:43:35,194
Very well then, Joab.

1578
02:43:35,372 --> 02:43:36,600
You will lead.

1579
02:43:36,773 --> 02:43:38,138
Where will you meet them?

1580
02:43:38,542 --> 02:43:40,066
At the wood of Ephraim...

1581
02:43:40,744 --> 02:43:43,440
... where they will be tired
after crossing the river.

1582
02:43:46,216 --> 02:43:47,513
One last thing, Joab.

1583
02:43:48,018 --> 02:43:50,543
If it is at all possible
to save the life of Absalom...

1584
02:43:50,721 --> 02:43:52,211
... please find a way.

1585
02:44:02,933 --> 02:44:04,400
Forward.

1586
02:44:06,403 --> 02:44:08,633
I used to be frightened
entering a battle.

1587
02:44:09,439 --> 02:44:11,304
Now I'm frightened not to enter it.

1588
02:45:29,653 --> 02:45:31,143
Absalom.

1589
02:45:31,655 --> 02:45:33,020
Absalom.

1590
02:45:37,794 --> 02:45:39,489
Follow him.

1591
02:46:10,260 --> 02:46:12,888
We must follow Absalom.

1592
02:48:54,858 --> 02:48:57,622
Go. Tell the king what we have done.

1593
02:49:18,815 --> 02:49:20,180
Follow lttai.

1594
02:49:20,984 --> 02:49:22,383
Inform the king.

1595
02:49:43,106 --> 02:49:44,403
A rider.

1596
02:49:44,574 --> 02:49:45,802
No, two.

1597
02:49:45,976 --> 02:49:48,410
First one's lttai. A good man.

1598
02:49:50,413 --> 02:49:51,971
He brings good tidings.

1599
02:49:52,248 --> 02:49:53,545
I feel it.

1600
02:49:59,289 --> 02:50:02,019
All is well, my lord king.

1601
02:50:03,793 --> 02:50:05,021
Blessed be the Lord God...

1602
02:50:05,195 --> 02:50:08,790
... who delivered up those men,
who raised their hands against you.

1603
02:50:11,201 --> 02:50:12,725
What news of Absalom, my son?

1604
02:50:13,003 --> 02:50:14,334
Is he captive?

1605
02:50:14,571 --> 02:50:16,300
Is he prisoner? Is he safe?

1606
02:50:18,775 --> 02:50:20,970
I cannot say, my lord king.

1607
02:50:21,945 --> 02:50:24,413
Joab and a detachment
sought after him.

1608
02:50:24,647 --> 02:50:27,582
There was furious fighting...

1609
02:50:29,519 --> 02:50:31,043
... but I do not know the result.

1610
02:50:37,894 --> 02:50:39,122
Well?

1611
02:50:39,362 --> 02:50:40,761
Good news, my lord king.

1612
02:50:42,365 --> 02:50:44,128
For God has delivered you this day...

1613
02:50:44,300 --> 02:50:46,791
... from the power of those
who rose against you.

1614
02:50:47,704 --> 02:50:48,932
And Absalom?

1615
02:50:53,943 --> 02:50:56,411
May all the enemies of King David...

1616
02:50:56,679 --> 02:50:58,271
... God's anointed...

1617
02:50:59,249 --> 02:51:02,309
... meet the same fate
as that young man has.

1618
02:51:08,191 --> 02:51:10,250
My son.

1619
02:51:10,427 --> 02:51:12,361
My son.

1620
02:51:12,529 --> 02:51:14,622
Absalom.

1621
02:51:16,266 --> 02:51:19,429
Why couldn't God take my life
instead of yours?

1622
02:51:46,996 --> 02:51:48,691
Please.

1623
02:51:54,537 --> 02:51:56,300
Leave me.

1624
02:52:14,858 --> 02:52:16,086
My lord king.

1625
02:52:16,726 --> 02:52:20,093
You have turned this day's victory
into a ceremony of mourning.

1626
02:52:20,497 --> 02:52:23,557
The camp speaks only
of your grief for your son.

1627
02:52:30,106 --> 02:52:31,334
David.

1628
02:52:33,910 --> 02:52:35,241
David.

1629
02:52:36,980 --> 02:52:39,312
We have been together a long time.

1630
02:52:40,950 --> 02:52:42,713
And I have always loved you.

1631
02:52:44,154 --> 02:52:45,621
And I've always tried...

1632
02:52:46,222 --> 02:52:48,122
... to understand the way you feel...

1633
02:52:49,159 --> 02:52:50,786
... the way you see things.

1634
02:52:53,129 --> 02:52:55,120
But today, you disgraced yourself...

1635
02:52:56,332 --> 02:52:58,095
... and me...

1636
02:52:58,268 --> 02:53:00,361
... and all your men.

1637
02:53:01,037 --> 02:53:02,265
How's that?

1638
02:53:02,872 --> 02:53:04,931
You not only love your enemies...

1639
02:53:05,508 --> 02:53:07,806
... you seem to love them
more than your friends.

1640
02:53:08,478 --> 02:53:10,469
If all your loyal followers had died...

1641
02:53:10,647 --> 02:53:12,376
... and Absalom had lived...

1642
02:53:12,882 --> 02:53:14,645
... to crush your kingdom...

1643
02:53:16,319 --> 02:53:18,287
... you would have been pleased.

1644
02:53:20,290 --> 02:53:22,053
What would you have me do?

1645
02:53:22,825 --> 02:53:24,417
Return to Jerusalem.

1646
02:53:25,261 --> 02:53:27,058
Stand up at the gates...

1647
02:53:27,530 --> 02:53:30,658
... and thank all those
who were loyal to you this day.

1648
02:53:31,734 --> 02:53:33,326
Honor them with your greeting.

1649
02:53:34,637 --> 02:53:36,867
Or they will start a rebellion
more dangerous...

1650
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:39,133
... than the one we put down today.

1651
02:53:41,678 --> 02:53:43,305
Be king, David.

1652
02:53:47,717 --> 02:53:49,082
Be king again.

1653
02:54:50,580 --> 02:54:52,775
Praise be to King David...

1654
02:54:52,949 --> 02:54:54,814
... of the Israelites.

1655
02:55:13,169 --> 02:55:14,761
Hail.

1656
02:55:22,345 --> 02:55:24,973
I know this victory is hollow for you.

1657
02:55:33,389 --> 02:55:34,754
My sorrow...

1658
02:55:35,725 --> 02:55:37,659
... is not just for myself.

1659
02:55:39,028 --> 02:55:41,053
With both my sons gone,
how can I be sure...

1660
02:55:41,230 --> 02:55:44,290
... that this kingdom will survive
on a firm foundation?

1661
02:55:46,369 --> 02:55:49,668
You taught me that after every trial
the nation faces...

1662
02:55:49,872 --> 02:55:52,272
... it emerges stronger than before.

1663
02:55:53,176 --> 02:55:55,701
And you said this was proof
of God's love.

1664
02:55:56,446 --> 02:55:59,142
No matter what mistakes
and ordeals we suffer...

1665
02:55:59,982 --> 02:56:01,609
... God loves us...

1666
02:56:02,118 --> 02:56:04,086
... and calls us back to him.

1667
02:56:06,356 --> 02:56:07,846
You must go...

1668
02:56:08,524 --> 02:56:10,082
... and listen to God.

1669
02:56:43,693 --> 02:56:46,161
<i>You have made great wars... </i>

1670
02:56:46,362 --> 02:56:49,297
<i>... and have shed blood</i>
<i>in great abundance. </i>

1671
02:56:49,766 --> 02:56:53,327
<i>Therefore, you shall not build my temple. </i>

1672
02:56:56,372 --> 02:57:00,433
<i>Solomon, your son, shall sit</i>
<i>upon the throne of Israel. </i>

1673
02:57:01,577 --> 02:57:04,341
<i>I will give him rest from his enemies... </i>

1674
02:57:04,547 --> 02:57:07,175
<i>... so that he can be a man of peace. </i>

1675
02:57:33,876 --> 02:57:36,208
<i>And so it shall be Solomon... </i>

1676
02:57:36,879 --> 02:57:38,813
<i>... who will build my temple. </i>

1677
02:59:32,328 --> 02:59:34,853
<i>Your son shall be my son. </i>

1678
02:59:37,967 --> 02:59:40,026
<i>And I will be his father. </i>

1679
02:59:43,839 --> 02:59:46,672
<i>And I will establish his kingdom... </i>

1680
02:59:47,577 --> 02:59:48,839
<i>... forever. </i>

1681
