<i>Take your

7
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:43,856
I'll be home in a few.

8
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:47,292
Get off in about an hour.
Space cadet, get me a...

9
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:48,793
<i>To go in this quarter.</i>

10
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:50,761
<i>They need to score
on this drive.</i>

11
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:04,338
<i>Don't lie to me, okay?</i>

12
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,173
<i>You sound like one of my kids.</i>

13
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:13,145

<i>Second down and nine

17
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:29,957
<i>She's so annoying.</i>

18
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:35,194
Elizabitch, get your
bony ass over here.

19
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:37,829
- What is going on?
- Don't hang up on her.

20
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,431
<i>Your baggage can be
claimed at carousel number three.</i>

21
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:41,965
<i>Please see a gate agent...</i>

22
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,800
Put security cameras
in the whole house.

23
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:46,068
- Except for the bedroom.

24
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,071
Christie wouldn't go for that.

25
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:52,140
My pool cleaner's
even gone rogue.

26
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:54,342
No, I'm serious.

27
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:56,777
Yeah, it's jumping out
of the pool on its own.

28
00:03:56,779 --> 00:04:00,080
<i>There is a flight
3598 to Manchester, New Hampshire.</i>

<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, it's me.

34
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,330
Just got off the plane.
What are you doing?

35
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:24,733
What am I doing? I'm picking
up Johnny at school.

36
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:26,468
I'm getting a sitter
from the bus stop.

37
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,404
Going back to the lab because
we got completely slammed.

38
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:31,205
Sharon, they made an offer.

39
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:34,041
<i>A big, big offer.</i>

40
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:35,842
For all the rights
to "night traveler."

41
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:38,878
We're talking about

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,180
<i>virtual reality, algorithms,</i>

43
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:42,948
<i>interface user stuff,
I don't know.</i>

44
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,851
That's amazing, Clay.
Congratulations.

45
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,319
Yeah.

46
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,421
Well, you know,
it's a big deal, yeah.

47
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,757
So are you going out
to celebrate tonight?

48
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,426
<i>Celebrate?
Celebrate, no.</i>

49
00:04:56,428 --> 00:04:58,494
Yeah, this is
a big night for you.

50
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:01,096
I just assumed you'd want
to celebrate with someone.

51
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:03,465
Not really.

52
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:05,300
So you're not with someone?

53
00:05:05,302 --> 00:05:08,369
No. No.

54
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:10,204
<i>There's nobody.</i>

55
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:12,472
Hey, is that dad?

56
00:05:12,474 --> 00:05:14,507
Can I talk to him?

57
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:24,949
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, buddy.

58
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:28,252
- How you doing?
- We did the parachute drill today.

59
00:05:28,254 --> 00:05:30,787
- Yeah.
- You put a little parachute on your bat.

60
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,456
I swear, my swing is like
100 times faster.

61
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,191
That's great.

62
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:37,793
Are you coming home?

63
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,462
Yeah, yeah, soon.

64
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:43,131
- I just want you to come home.
- Ah, shit.

65
00:06:23,304 --> 00:06:26,938
Hi, shar, it's me.
Yeah, I ran out of juice.

66
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,107
Listen, there's a flight

67
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:32,509
<i>to Manchester that leaves
in about an hour.</i>

68
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,111
Clay, you've been gone
for over a year.

69
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:37,947
I love you,
but it's not that simple.

70
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,581
I'd like to see my son.

71
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,516
- Shit.
<i>- Your time is up.</i>

72
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:44,519
- I need more money. Hold on.
- <i>Please deposit...</i>

73
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:12,075
what's wrong with you?
Stop it!

74
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:17,279
Get off him! What are you doing?
Get off!

75
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,029
Get off of her!

76
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:44,401
Stop that!

77
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:52,207
Go! Go! Go!

78
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:00,981
Oh, my god, Chloe.

79
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:04,317
Hey, hey, hey, don't touch her.

80
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,951
- I'm not gonna touch her.
- She might be contagious.

81
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,053
I need to call 911, though.

82
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,554
Hello? Hello?

83
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,232
Let me see your goddamn hands!
Get your hands in the air!

84
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:00,528
Why'd you do that? What, are
you gonna shoot everybody?

85
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,630
- What the hell is happening?
- Who the hell knows?

86
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:05,466
- Quick, let's go.
- Don't use your cell phone.

87
00:09:05,468 --> 00:09:08,068
- Why?
- They did.

88
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:23,547
Help me!

89
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:58,631
No, no, no.
Bro, stop, he's normal.

90
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:00,766
Hey, hey, hey!

91
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:03,335
Come on.
Let's go, bro.

92
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:06,371
Bro, come on.

93
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:08,573
- - Don't use your
cell phones.

94
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:11,208
<i> We've been trying, but we
can't get a signal down here.</i>

95
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,578
We need to get out of this airport right
now before it burns to the ground.

96
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,246
<i>Get out of here?
We ain't going nowhere.</i>

97
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:17,780
Is there a driver on this train?

98
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:20,349
- That'd be me.
<i>- Can we leave?</i>

99
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:22,751
- No.
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

100
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:25,720
Central shut down the power,
emergency brakes came up,

101
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:28,255
and this train can't
move more than 50 feet.

102
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:30,724
- Shit.

103
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:33,626
- We could walk.
<i>- Walk?</i>

104
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:35,828
<i>Walk?
Ain't nobody walking.</i>

105
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,297
- What did you say?
- We could walk.

106
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,799
I got maps of the system

107
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,801
and I got all the maintenance
tunnels with the exits marked.

108
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,669
We can walk right out of here.

109
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,471
That's a brilliant idea.
You're my new best friend.

110
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,374
- What are you gonna do when the t starts running again?
- Let's go.

111
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,242
You don't want to come, you don't
got to come. I don't care.

112
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,410
You guys are idiots.
We're safe right here.

113
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:57,379
Only if this lasts less
than 24 hours.

114
00:11:57,381 --> 00:11:59,347
- What do you mean?
- The groundwater.

115
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:01,449
The sewage workers
pump out the groundwater.

116
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:04,652
If nobody's Manning the
pumps, whole system floods.

117
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:06,553
All of this will be underwater.

118
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:08,721
You'll be forced into the terminal
or back out in the streets.

119
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:10,989
And if Boston is still burning or
if what he's saying is true...

120
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:13,591
<i> Don't listen to him. We're
not gonna be down here that long.</i>

121
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:15,826
- Do you want to stay here or do you want to go?
- <i>It's gonna blow over.</i>

122
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:19,329
- These things always do.
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Can I come with you?

123
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:21,664
- I'm not gonna stop you.
- Yo, awesome. Deuces, man.

124
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,699
- You don't even know him.
- Adios.

125
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,501
You think this is
happening everywhere or just here?

126
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:28,436
We'll know
in a little while.

127
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:31,505
We lose power, means it's
happening everywhere.

128
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:33,406
Nobody's Manning
the power stations.

129
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:35,708
Probably running
for their lives like us.

130
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,545
Wonder how many folks were on
those things when it happened.

131
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:41,647
A lot.

132
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:43,649
Too many.
Like everybody.

133
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:45,350
And those that didn't get it
the first time got zapped

134
00:12:45,352 --> 00:12:47,318
when they tried to call
911 or their families.

135
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,852
Hmm.

136
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:52,522
I'm Tom Mccourt, by the way.

137
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:54,824
Clay Riddell.
Good to know you.

138
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:57,960
Mike Mattick. They
call me dj liquid.

139
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:00,595
- Keep moving.
- Dj.

140
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:03,864
I got to get to Kent pond.
My family is up there.

141
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,867
I've got a wife and son. You know,
in New Hampshire. Kent pond?

142
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,935
You got anybody
you need to check on?

143
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:11,504
- I got my boo.
- Did you say "my boo"?

144
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:13,672
- Yeah, what you got, huh?
- Come on, come on.

145
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:17,976
My man, he done left me, so I
ain't got nobody. I live alone.

146
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:26,482
Yo, I got service.
What does that mean?

147
00:13:26,484 --> 00:13:28,917
I don't know.
Put that thing down.

148
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:32,654
Are they normal?

149
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:34,489
- They look normal to you?
- I don't know.

150
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:36,557
You want to take that chance?
What's abnormal?

151
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,764
Shit!

152
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,999
<i>Shit! Come on!
Come on!</i>

153
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:54,872
Come on! Run!

154
00:14:08,786 --> 00:14:10,719
Come on, man.
Come on.

155
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:18,992
Come on! Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

156
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:20,093
Come on. Come on.

157
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,633
The dumpster.
The dumpster.

158
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,468
I got it.
I got it.

159
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:42,378
Go. Go.

160
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:56,690
Hold it.

161
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:04,597
<i>I know her.</i>

162
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:15,640
- Okay, what floor?
- Two.

163
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:17,675
<i>Okay, go. Go.</i>

164
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:44,868
- - Shit, hurry up!

165
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,703
Hurry up.

166
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:14,930
Yeah, dead.

167
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:21,168
Think it's safe to text?

168
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:24,437
<i>I'm out of juice.</i>

169
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:26,605
I've got to text my family,
see if they're okay.

170
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:27,887
Can I borrow your phone, please?

171
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,794
It's all jumbled up.

172
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,729
<i>Scrambled.</i>

173
00:16:57,731 --> 00:16:59,630
Why don't you stick
my phone in the freezer?

174
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:01,865
<i>It makes the battery
last longer.</i>

175
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,167
Probably need it
to check the signal.

176
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,903
<i>If we don't make any calls,
it should last for a few days.</i>

177
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:12,475
You draw all these?

178
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:14,543
- -<i> Yeah.</i>

179
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:16,611
<i>My graphic novel.</i>

180
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:28,888
<i>I was thinking
about that poor kid</i>

181
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,256
<i>down in the tunnel.</i>

182
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,726
Dj...

183
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:35,728
Liquid?

184
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:38,563
God damn.

185
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:45,169
<i>You know, if we're going to
survive this, whatever it is,</i>

186
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:48,772
people are gonna
have to put aside

187
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:53,042
<i>their finer sensibilities.</i>

188
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:58,279
If they can't,

189
00:17:58,281 --> 00:18:01,248
they're gonna die.

190
00:18:07,256 --> 00:18:10,156
<i>Hello?</i>

191
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:12,625
- She sound normal?
- <i>Hello?</i>

192
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:14,893
- <i>Please, someone be there.</i>
- Are you normal?

193
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:17,695
<i>What do you think?
Open the damn door.</i>

194
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:26,869
- Okay.
- I live upstairs.

195
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:30,072
Yeah, I've seen you before.
I'm Clay.

196
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:32,574
- <i>Tom.</i>
- I'm Alice.

197
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:35,243
I think you guys should close the blinds.
I don't think that's smart.

198
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:37,211
You guys should
close the blinds.

199
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:39,146
I don't think it's gonna be good
if somebody sees us in here.

200
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:42,082
He's gonna close them.
Tom, you close them.

201
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,950
<i>See, he's closing them.</i>

202
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:47,787
- Are you hurt?
- What do you mean, am I hurt?

203
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:51,657
Are you physically injured?
Can I help you?

204
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:53,991
I killed my mom.

205
00:18:56,562 --> 00:18:59,329
I killed my mom.

206
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:03,633
I want to get out of this dress
because it really smells.

207
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:07,637
Like blood and sweat
and my mom's perfume.

208
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:10,640
My girlfriend
might have left some jeans.

209
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:12,675
I think they'd
just about fit you.

210
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:14,943
And I have pajamas.
I have plenty of pajamas.

211
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:26,153
Okay?

212
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:28,321
Yeah, I'm just tired.

213
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:31,824
Here, do you want to maybe...

214
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:41,099
There's still some hot water
if you want to take a shower.

215
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:44,268
Uh-huh, okay.
Thank you.

216
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,378
<i>Listen, Tom,
I'm gonna head north</i>

217
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,646
<i>to Kent pond in the morning
as soon as it gets light.</i>

218
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:02,348
I think you and Alice should
probably come with me.

219
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:06,985
Clay, I'm really sorry
about your family.

220
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:09,387
Don't be sorry because there's
nothing to be sorry about yet.

221
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:20,697
My kid had a cell phone,
but he never made calls.

222
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:23,733
He just texted, you know?
Liked games.

223
00:20:23,735 --> 00:20:27,069
But my wife, she had one and I
called her right before it happened.

224
00:20:27,071 --> 00:20:30,739
When I met you. So I don't
know if she was on it.

225
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:41,282
I just want you to know I'm real
glad I ran into you today, Tom.

226
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:52,425
You okay?

227
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:58,864
Oh, um, I found
these in your pocket.

228
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:01,032
Hope you don't mind.

229
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:02,933
No, no, no, no.

230
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:14,276
Here, maybe drink something.

231
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:16,344
- No.
- Do you want something to eat?

232
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:18,179
No.

233
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:30,123
If you guys go somewhere,
can I come with you?

234
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,291
Hoping you'd say that.

235
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:33,458
<i>Definitely.</i>

236
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,359
Yeah.

237
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,263
I'm gonna try
and get some rest now.

238
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,797
Yeah, we'll be here.

239
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:46,168
Yeah.

240
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:00,447
So...

241
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:04,284
Some kind of terrorist attack

242
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:06,052
or some shit, do you think?

243
00:22:06,054 --> 00:22:08,154
I don't know, man.

244
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:12,891
Well, whoever it was,

245
00:22:12,893 --> 00:22:16,027
us three are like bugs
who had the dumb luck

246
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:19,463
to avoid the stomp
of the giant's foot.

247
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:10,701
They're like birds.

248
00:24:10,703 --> 00:24:12,302
<i>They're acting like
a flock of birds.</i>

249
00:24:17,976 --> 00:24:19,542
<i>Well, I don't like it.</i>

250
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:23,278
I don't like this flocking
thing at all.

251
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:28,983
I mean, whatever it is, I've
just got to get to Kent pond

252
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:31,618
<i>and find out
about my wife and son.</i>

253
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:36,388
If you guys don't want to
come, I totally get it.

254
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,440
Hold up.
Hold up.

255
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,484
- Oh, shit.
- What?

256
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,590
- I don't know.
- Should we go back?

257
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:09,502
<i>Oh, my god! Help me!</i>

258
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:13,404
<i>Help me!</i>

259
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:16,407
- - Oh, Jesus.

260
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,776
- -<i> Oh, god!</i>

261
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:20,778
- Should we help them?
- No, no, no, no.

262
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,479
- Nothing we can do.
- We go back or we go right now.

263
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,280
No, go, go, go.
They're not looking.

264
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,148
- They're not looking. Go, go.
- Go.

265
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:48,802
Where they all go?

266
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:51,738
Maybe we got lucky
and they all dropped off,

267
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,274
you know, when they lost the
signal like at the train station.

268
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:14,658
Tom. Tom.

269
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:19,328
Always considered
myself a pacifist,

270
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,796
but I wouldn't mind
having a pistol right now.

271
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:23,799
Um, guys.

272
00:27:23,801 --> 00:27:28,470
I don't think
that's a good idea.

273
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:30,104
<i>I go in with
my hands raised</i>

274
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,738
and just say I want to talk.

275
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,806
Maybe ring the doorbell. What's
the worst that can happen?

276
00:27:33,808 --> 00:27:35,741
I'm a black man with a crowbar.

277
00:27:35,743 --> 00:27:37,542
I'm not walking over there.

278
00:27:37,544 --> 00:27:39,544
Okay, how about that one?

279
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:41,746
Oh, that makes all the
difference in the world.

280
00:28:12,144 --> 00:28:14,611
Oh, my god.
Oh, my.

281
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:37,866
Why don't you
take care of Alice?

282
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:39,868
<i>I'll get what we came for.</i>

283
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,193
Here, take this.

284
00:29:09,396 --> 00:29:11,295
Uh-uh.

285
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,233
- What?
- Look at you.

286
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:19,969
Yeah, basic training.
You never forget.

287
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:22,705
Grab some ammo.

288
00:29:27,711 --> 00:29:29,711
<i>How do you
load these things?</i>

289
00:29:29,713 --> 00:29:31,612
You guys, there's
someone out here.

290
00:29:31,614 --> 00:29:33,347
What?

291
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:35,382
He's by himself.

292
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:38,518
Close 'em.
Close the drapes.

293
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,324
Hey, are you okay?

294
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:54,298
Hello.

295
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:03,807
Hello.

296
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:04,974
Kid.

297
00:30:09,012 --> 00:30:10,012
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

298
00:30:15,651 --> 00:30:18,685
I guess they don't
all travel in flock...

299
00:31:15,435 --> 00:31:16,934
fuck this.

300
00:31:27,077 --> 00:31:28,609
Let's go.
Let's go.

301
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:20,084
What the hell?

302
00:34:27,753 --> 00:34:29,786
<i>Well, it looks like
when the sun goes down</i>

303
00:34:29,788 --> 00:34:31,821
they're programmed
to pack it in.

304
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:33,622
It was like they all
did it together.

305
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:36,191
Like it was an automated
response or something.

306
00:34:36,193 --> 00:34:39,260
You know what I don't get
is how they all knew

307
00:34:39,262 --> 00:34:41,562
exactly where we were that fast.

308
00:34:41,564 --> 00:34:44,731
<i>I mean, it's not like they
were watching us or anything.</i>

309
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:46,799
Not with their own eyes anyway.

310
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:48,901
Not with their own...

311
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:52,104
so you're saying when that
kid saw us, they all saw us?

312
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:53,772
How else do you explain it?

313
00:34:53,774 --> 00:34:56,007
- So now they're psychic?
- <i>Telepathic.</i>

314
00:34:56,009 --> 00:35:00,578
Like maybe the pulse
flows through them

315
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,980
like they're this big,
organic, you know, network.

316
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:05,882
Like a hive mind.

317
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:08,985
Yeah.

318
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:11,052
<i>You got anything better?</i>

319
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,779
What makes you think
they're still there?

320
00:35:40,781 --> 00:35:43,248
I mean, no matter what
or how it went down,

321
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,216
don't you think
they might have bailed?

322
00:35:45,218 --> 00:35:48,152
If they're safe, they
would have left a message.

323
00:35:56,862 --> 00:36:00,897
Lost most of my money in
the great collapse of '08.

324
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:05,801
And I lost my emotional stability
in the great divorce of '09.

325
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:10,872
You know, at the time, I thought
that was the end of the world.

326
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:13,007
- Whoa, what is that?

327
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:14,742
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

328
00:36:16,712 --> 00:36:19,012
It's music.

329
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,190
Greetings, gentlemen.

330
00:36:31,192 --> 00:36:34,960
Miss.
Welcome to Gaiten academy.

331
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:39,230
If you folks need a place to stay for
the night, we have plenty of rooms.

332
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:41,999
The boys who didn't have
cell phones have all run off.

333
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,734
<i>The ones who did have them...</i>

334
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:45,936
oh, we know about that.

335
00:36:45,938 --> 00:36:49,205
I'm Jordan.
I'm a scholarship boy.

336
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,707
- I lived in Holloway.
- Good for you, Jordan.

337
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,409
Yes, sir. That's what
the head said, too.

338
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:56,044
Charles Ardai.
Headmaster.

339
00:36:57,981 --> 00:37:00,341
Quite a problem these cell phones
have caused now, isn't it?

340
00:37:02,217 --> 00:37:04,317
The devil's intercom
is what I used to call them.

341
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:06,986
Nice.
It's apt.

342
00:37:06,988 --> 00:37:08,887
What's with the music?

343
00:37:08,889 --> 00:37:11,456
Did you ever play
musical chairs as a child?

344
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:14,392
- Yeah.
- Well, as long as the music doesn't stop,

345
00:37:14,394 --> 00:37:16,994
we've got nothing
to worry about.

346
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:20,364
We'll have a quick peek, then we'll
go over to Cheatham lodge for dinner.

347
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:23,734
It's not 200 yards to
Tonney field, I promise.

348
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:31,506
<i>Holy shit.</i>

349
00:37:35,111 --> 00:37:37,911
<i>Is the music coming
from their phones?</i>

350
00:37:37,913 --> 00:37:39,879
<i>Don't worry,
they won't wake up.</i>

351
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:41,981
<i>How can you be
so sure of that?</i>

352
00:37:43,884 --> 00:37:45,850
Observe.

353
00:37:45,852 --> 00:37:48,052
- What the hell are you doing?

354
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:50,120
No, no, he's calm.
He's calm.

355
00:37:50,122 --> 00:37:53,356
<i>I could put my sword cane
right through his throat</i>

356
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:55,157
<i>and he wouldn't try to stop me.</i>

357
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:58,160
Nor would those around him
spring to his defense.

358
00:37:58,162 --> 00:38:00,262
Of course, if I tried
it in the daylight,

359
00:38:00,264 --> 00:38:02,130
they'd tear me limb from limb.

360
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:04,332
The music comes from
their mouths, too.

361
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:06,901
It's not hardly a whisper,
but you can hear it.

362
00:38:09,972 --> 00:38:12,472
- Come here.
- That's got to be your imagination.

363
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:14,954
- There's no way that they're actually talking.
- <i>Come listen.</i>

364
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:23,782
It's like they don't breathe.

365
00:38:25,118 --> 00:38:28,285
I can hear it.
I can hear it.

366
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:31,054
How is that even possible
without a transmitter?

367
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:34,891
They are transmitting. It's a new
skill they seem to have picked up.

368
00:38:34,893 --> 00:38:37,126
And they're changing
at an alarming rate.

369
00:38:37,128 --> 00:38:40,796
Can we please move
this conversation inside?

370
00:38:40,798 --> 00:38:42,564
Please.

371
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,036
<i>We cannot overestimate</i>

372
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:51,304
<i>the developmental leaps
we're witnessing here.</i>

373
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:54,473
They appear to be eusocial.

374
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:57,342
Like a colony of bees or ants.

375
00:38:57,344 --> 00:39:00,311
<i>They act for the good
of the group as a whole.</i>

376
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:03,013
There's no competitiveness,
no selfishness.

377
00:39:03,015 --> 00:39:06,950
In fact, they may be the next
stage in human evolution.

378
00:39:06,952 --> 00:39:09,519
Every human on planet earth

379
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:12,522
will be part
of one giant organism.

380
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:15,858
No individuality.
No privacy. Come on.

381
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,961
No war.
No resource depletion.

382
00:39:18,963 --> 00:39:21,029
- No conflict.
- No, thank you.

383
00:39:21,031 --> 00:39:24,399
<i>As to what they're doing at night
as they lie there so still,</i>

384
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:28,302
open-eyed and listening
to their music,

385
00:39:28,304 --> 00:39:29,870
we think they're rebooting.

386
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:32,839
Yeah, I mean,
they might as well have

387
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:36,275
"software updating, please stand
by" blinking on their foreheads.

388
00:39:36,277 --> 00:39:38,277
You mean they had
their brains wiped?

389
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:41,513
Yeah, I mean, what is a brain?

390
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:44,315
It's just a big old hard drive.

391
00:39:44,317 --> 00:39:46,150
Organic circuitry.

392
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:48,051
<i>No one knows how many bytes.</i>

393
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,420
<i>Like, giga to the power
of googolplex, let's say.</i>

394
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:52,422
<i>An infinity of bytes.</i>

395
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:54,957
<i>If your brain were an info
strip on a hard drive,</i>

396
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,961
it would say something like
2% in use, 98% available.

397
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,229
Holmes, you astound me.

398
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:03,331
- I love cybernetics.
- Ah.

399
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,067
Cyberpunk fiction, too.
William Gibson.

400
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:07,601
<i>Neal Stephenson,
you like him?</i>

401
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:09,436
Neal Stephenson is a god.

402
00:40:09,438 --> 00:40:10,870
Yeah, he's pretty good.

403
00:40:10,872 --> 00:40:14,306
Right now the nights are ours.

404
00:40:14,308 --> 00:40:17,976
But what happens if they decide
that they need less sleep?

405
00:40:17,978 --> 00:40:22,113
<i>What happens if they decide to grow
against their digital lullabies?</i>

406
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:24,448
What happens

407
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:27,117
when they're not
afraid of the dark?

408
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,018
What are you suggesting?

409
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,021
I think what's happening now is
more than temporary anarchy.

410
00:40:32,023 --> 00:40:34,957
I think it's the start of a war.

411
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:38,260
<i>It's going to be a short
but extremely nasty one.</i>

412
00:40:38,262 --> 00:40:41,162
But what does one do in a war?

413
00:40:41,164 --> 00:40:43,297
One kills one's enemies.

414
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:45,065
Well, even with
the guns we have,

415
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,433
it'll be slow work.

416
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:49,602
We have a gasoline pump
in our little motor pool.

417
00:40:51,072 --> 00:40:54,339
Gasoline may serve
to end their lives.

418
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:57,909
Hold up.
You want to napalm them?

419
00:40:57,911 --> 00:40:59,944
<i>We have a sprayer truck
that we use</i>

420
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:02,913
to keep our playing
fields very green.

421
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:08,150
I want to wipe them out.

422
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:12,154
I agree with him. I think
we should wipe them out.

423
00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:14,156
<i>The ones on the soccer field.</i>

424
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:16,057
<i>And I don't want to do it
for the human race.</i>

425
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:17,958
<i>I want to do it for my mom.</i>

426
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,694
As many as we can,
as fast as we can.

427
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,332
Before it's too late.

428
00:41:35,207 --> 00:41:37,574
We sure we want to do this?

429
00:41:37,576 --> 00:41:40,443
Oh, yeah, for sure.
Let's go.

430
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:50,618
I'm sure.

431
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,266
Whoa.

432
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,602
Holy cow.

433
00:42:32,987 --> 00:42:36,021
All right.

434
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,297
Do you like first-person
shooter games?

435
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,367
Yeah.

436
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:02,577
Pretty freaked out, huh?

437
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,579
I'm fine.

438
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:06,681
How about you?

439
00:43:08,217 --> 00:43:10,250
Freak city.

440
00:43:13,288 --> 00:43:16,222
- Oh.

441
00:43:21,261 --> 00:43:23,094
<i>We have a problem?</i>

442
00:43:23,096 --> 00:43:24,795
No, no, no.
It's great.

443
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:27,030
Put it in a lower gear.

444
00:43:27,032 --> 00:43:29,065
Yeah, it's not like I've
done this before, all right?

445
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:31,033
Just put it in a lower gear.

446
00:43:31,035 --> 00:43:33,402
Yeah, we were just on
somebody's head or something.

447
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,380
All right.
They're coming back.

448
00:43:55,389 --> 00:43:58,656
No, you've had enough of that to be DUI.
You know that, right?

449
00:43:58,658 --> 00:44:00,724
Yeah.

450
00:44:00,726 --> 00:44:02,759
But it won't really count

451
00:44:02,761 --> 00:44:05,127
after the mass murder, you know?

452
00:44:08,432 --> 00:44:11,766
No one knows better than me
that you can't stop progress.

453
00:44:11,768 --> 00:44:16,203
But still, you're never
too old to fight it.

454
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,257
- - Uh-oh.

455
00:44:42,861 --> 00:44:45,161
Holy shit.

456
00:44:45,163 --> 00:44:46,529
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

457
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:10,785
Shit, the truck.
Get down!

458
00:45:21,495 --> 00:45:24,329
Alice, you all right?

459
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:26,731
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

460
00:45:26,733 --> 00:45:28,566
Shit.

461
00:45:33,438 --> 00:45:36,705
Ardai!

462
00:45:36,707 --> 00:45:38,506
<i>Ardai!</i>

463
00:45:38,508 --> 00:45:40,808
No!

464
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,510
Help.
Help him.

465
00:45:43,512 --> 00:45:45,378
Somebody help him.

466
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,347
Tom. Clay.

467
00:45:49,817 --> 00:45:51,850
Help him.

468
00:45:51,852 --> 00:45:54,686
Okay.

469
00:45:54,688 --> 00:45:56,287
No.

470
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:58,355
Come on, buddy.
Come on. It's okay.

471
00:45:58,357 --> 00:46:00,590
All right.

472
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:06,695
- What is that?
- Yeah, I feel it, too.

473
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:10,766
It feels like rage.

474
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,869
We got to go right now.

475
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:32,519
<i>Do not withhold your
mercy from us, o lord.</i>

476
00:46:34,623 --> 00:46:36,789
<i>May your love and your truth</i>

477
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,991
<i>always protect us.</i>

478
00:46:38,993 --> 00:46:43,428
<i>For troubles without number
surround us.</i>

479
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:47,597
<i>Our sins have overrun us
and we cannot see.</i>

480
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,835
<i>Our sins are more than
the hairs of our head</i>

481
00:46:53,837 --> 00:46:57,771
<i>and our hearts fail within us.</i>

482
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:01,573
<i>Be pleased to save us, o lord.</i>

483
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:07,811
<i>O lord, come quickly to help us.</i>

484
00:47:11,316 --> 00:47:13,683
<i>May those who seek
to take our lives</i>

485
00:47:13,685 --> 00:47:16,719
<i>as this life was taken</i>

486
00:47:16,721 --> 00:47:19,821
<i>be put to shame and confusion.</i>

487
00:47:22,025 --> 00:47:24,825
May those who desire ruin

488
00:47:24,827 --> 00:47:28,895
be turned back in disgrace.

489
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:33,966
<i>May all those who say to us,</i>

490
00:47:33,968 --> 00:47:35,734
"aha.

491
00:47:37,037 --> 00:47:39,603
Aha..."

492
00:47:42,374 --> 00:47:45,508
Be appalled by their own shame.

493
00:47:47,879 --> 00:47:50,813
<i>For here lies the dead.</i>

494
00:47:50,815 --> 00:47:54,616
The dust of the earth.

495
00:50:11,112 --> 00:50:13,045
<i>Nightmare?</i>

496
00:50:13,047 --> 00:50:14,946
<i>Yeah.</i>

497
00:50:16,616 --> 00:50:19,483
- <i>You, too?</i>
- Yeah.

498
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:23,652
I thought when you get older,
the nightmares go away.

499
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:26,954
No, they still happen.

500
00:50:28,657 --> 00:50:30,522
They just grow up, too.

501
00:50:33,527 --> 00:50:36,528
There was this really creepy,

502
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:39,731
disgusting guy in my dream.

503
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:42,767
<i>He was dirty. Yellow teeth.
He had on a red hoodie.</i>

504
00:50:42,769 --> 00:50:44,068
- What?
- <i>Long hair.</i>

505
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:46,937
Does he have
a tear on his cheek?

506
00:50:46,939 --> 00:50:50,006
<i> In my dream, he was poking
my neck with a knitting needle</i>

507
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:51,540
and calling me insane.

508
00:50:51,542 --> 00:50:53,241
In a red hoodie?

509
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:56,010
Pushed me in front
of a speeding train.

510
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:04,017
The guy in my dream,

511
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,753
that's the character
from my graphic novel.

512
00:51:06,755 --> 00:51:10,089
You know, my comic book,
"the night traveler."

513
00:51:10,091 --> 00:51:12,925
He's the guy in the drawings on
your wall of your apartment?

514
00:51:12,927 --> 00:51:17,795
Yes. He's a, you know,
prophet of the apocalypse.

515
00:51:17,797 --> 00:51:19,630
So you saw all this shit coming?

516
00:51:19,632 --> 00:51:21,999
Hey, it was just
a comic book, man.

517
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:25,302
Unless this is just all
my goddamn dream.

518
00:51:25,304 --> 00:51:29,272
You may have had it first, but
you're definitely not the only one.

519
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:34,944
It's getting dark.
Let's get out of here.

520
00:51:34,946 --> 00:51:37,813
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Yeah, I don't want to sleep no more.

521
00:52:54,317 --> 00:52:56,684
<i>"Kashwak equals no-fo."</i>

522
00:52:56,686 --> 00:52:58,952
<i>"I heart Kashwak."
What does that mean?</i>

523
00:52:58,954 --> 00:53:02,655
Maybe no-fo means
no phones.

524
00:53:02,657 --> 00:53:05,891
Like a dead zone. No cell
phone towers, so it's safe.

525
00:53:05,893 --> 00:53:10,128
You can't assume that. It's too
early to think we know the rules.

526
00:53:16,201 --> 00:53:19,268
Open up!
We're Americans.

527
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,209
<i>Happy hour start yet?</i>

528
00:53:30,713 --> 00:53:33,714
Ooh, company.

529
00:53:33,716 --> 00:53:37,184
You're cute.
You're cute.

530
00:53:37,186 --> 00:53:40,020
You, sir, are very cute.

531
00:53:40,022 --> 00:53:41,955
Thank you.

532
00:53:41,957 --> 00:53:45,692
And you, my love,
are to die for.

533
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:50,729
No phoners come through here.

534
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:52,864
Phoners don't like English food.

535
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:55,399
English people
don't like English food.

536
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:58,668
- Hey, I do, mister.
- All right, all right.

537
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:01,237
What the hell is Kashwak? What
do you guys think that is?

538
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:05,274
Oh, you know Kashwak.

539
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:07,175
Up in Maine.

540
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:10,311
<i>It's an unincorporated
area they call tr-90.</i>

541
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,746
<i>Kashwakamak lake.</i>

542
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:15,915
Everybody's going there. Everybody
who hasn't been pulsed.

543
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:17,349
We're going.
We're leaving tomorrow.

544
00:54:17,351 --> 00:54:19,851
Thanks for letting us
come in tonight.

545
00:54:19,853 --> 00:54:22,420
Mmm, we're happy you're here.

546
00:54:22,422 --> 00:54:25,689
We're really glad you're here.

547
00:54:25,691 --> 00:54:27,924
You think Bob Dylan's a phoner?

548
00:54:27,926 --> 00:54:31,327
That's a good one.

549
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:34,296
<i>There's no... there's
no telephone songs on here.</i>

550
00:54:34,298 --> 00:54:37,232
That would... that would
be apropos, right?

551
00:54:37,234 --> 00:54:38,933
<i>Like...</i>

552
00:54:50,212 --> 00:54:53,947
Oh, d2. D2.

553
00:54:59,721 --> 00:55:03,055
That's like the devil
of ego, right?

554
00:55:03,057 --> 00:55:06,158
The vanity of
super individuality.

555
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,227
But the other one was
this one called Arama.

556
00:55:09,229 --> 00:55:13,297
And he was, like,
a demon of big data.

557
00:55:13,299 --> 00:55:15,799
<i>Of numbers, of abstraction.</i>

558
00:55:15,801 --> 00:55:17,867
- <i>Right? You know what I'm saying?</i>
- Yeah.

559
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:20,135
- <i>You with me? You with me, Geoff?
- Hell, yeah.</i>

560
00:55:20,137 --> 00:55:22,270
<i>When I came
home from Vietnam,</i>

561
00:55:22,272 --> 00:55:24,405
you know, I was lost,

562
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:27,274
drifting and...

563
00:55:27,276 --> 00:55:30,210
Somebody reached out their hand

564
00:55:30,212 --> 00:55:32,845
and they saved my life.

565
00:55:32,847 --> 00:55:36,315
<i>They might be dead now
or even part of the flock</i>

566
00:55:36,317 --> 00:55:38,283
<i>that's trying to pull me in.</i>

567
00:55:38,285 --> 00:55:40,818
All I know is

568
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,787
that I didn't survive a war

569
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:47,023
and all the rest of it

570
00:55:47,025 --> 00:55:51,193
just to get pulled in
by this fucker

571
00:55:51,195 --> 00:55:53,094
or his flock.

572
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:57,131
<i>You know, the first time
I saw his face,</i>

573
00:55:57,133 --> 00:56:00,167
it wasn't dreams,
it was in his house.

574
00:56:00,169 --> 00:56:02,335
On the wall.
You drew him.

575
00:56:02,337 --> 00:56:05,538
I'm not the first guy to draw
a devil on a piece of paper.

576
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,473
<i>- The devil?</i>
- Yeah.

577
00:56:09,443 --> 00:56:12,210
- How's it end?
- <i>I never finished it.</i>

578
00:56:12,212 --> 00:56:14,912
I mean, it's like
a serial graphic novel.

579
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:18,448
Didn't really end. It was
just a game and a story.

580
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:20,416
- Just a game?
- Mm.

581
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:25,053
Good always conquers evil.

582
00:56:26,089 --> 00:56:28,422
Now, I believe that.

583
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:03,585
You know, and I saw you
with your son once, too.

584
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:06,121
And I always wanted that.

585
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:12,393
Anyway, I saw you leave your
apartment with that woman

586
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,995
and I just really hated that.

587
00:57:14,997 --> 00:57:17,063
- <i>Liz?</i>
- Liz.

588
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:19,165
Hated that.

589
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:21,000
Always seemed like
you were pissed at me.

590
00:57:21,002 --> 00:57:23,702
I never knew
what was up with you.

591
00:57:23,704 --> 00:57:25,670
You'd give me that death stare.

592
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,273
Yeah.

593
00:57:29,275 --> 00:57:31,174
I give everyone the death stare.

594
00:57:33,978 --> 00:57:38,146
But I know you love your family.

595
00:57:38,148 --> 00:57:39,614
I've seen you with your son

596
00:57:39,616 --> 00:57:42,283
and I know that shit
happens with couples,

597
00:57:42,285 --> 00:57:44,284
just...

598
00:57:47,222 --> 00:57:49,622
you're gonna find him, Clay.

599
00:57:50,725 --> 00:57:52,558
You're gonna find him.

600
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,293
You think?

601
00:57:55,663 --> 00:57:57,562
You are.

602
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,333
<i>We were traveling in the dark</i>

603
00:58:02,335 --> 00:58:05,002
<i>and that was really,
really dark for me.</i>

604
00:58:05,004 --> 00:58:07,637
'Cause I had him.
And I had her.

605
00:58:10,608 --> 00:58:14,309
I had some bullshit job
that I hated

606
00:58:14,311 --> 00:58:17,979
doing graphic design
for some stupid company.

607
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:21,749
<i>But I hated myself for not having
the balls to do what I wanted</i>

608
00:58:21,751 --> 00:58:26,320
and I hated Sharon for loving
me when I hated myself

609
00:58:26,322 --> 00:58:29,389
and all these warped,
convoluted feelings.

610
00:58:32,694 --> 00:58:34,694
Sometimes I'd get home from work

611
00:58:34,696 --> 00:58:37,163
and I'd change into
my rock and roll t-shirt

612
00:58:37,165 --> 00:58:40,132
and I'd go to the bar and smoke weed
and listen to Norwegian death metal

613
00:58:40,134 --> 00:58:43,401
like some teenager who wanted
to blow up his high school.

614
00:58:43,403 --> 00:58:45,636
It was pathetic.

615
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:50,273
Then one day I just split
and moved out.

616
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:52,608
And do you like being there?

617
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,110
First night I was there,
I knew it was a mistake.

618
00:58:55,112 --> 00:58:57,011
Very first night.

619
00:59:00,182 --> 00:59:02,448
I called Sharon
the day of the pulse.

620
00:59:04,051 --> 00:59:05,417
I couldn't tell her I missed her

621
00:59:05,419 --> 00:59:07,051
and that I wanted to come home.

622
00:59:07,053 --> 00:59:10,154
I said I want to see my son.

623
00:59:10,156 --> 00:59:13,790
See, I had to prove I was right and
to prove I was special, you know?

624
00:59:13,792 --> 00:59:17,393
I mean, probably just wanted
her to be proud of you.

625
00:59:20,698 --> 00:59:25,300
Well, be great
if that were true.

626
00:59:25,302 --> 00:59:26,801
I think I was just an asshole.

627
00:59:31,274 --> 00:59:34,108
<i>Here. That's what you look like.</i>

628
00:59:35,478 --> 00:59:38,145
Human beings are the
religion of the angels.

629
00:59:38,147 --> 00:59:41,615
And that is an angel in exile.
What do you think?

630
01:01:27,149 --> 01:01:28,648
<i>Sally?</i>

631
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:53,936
Get out of my fucking bar!

632
01:02:02,311 --> 01:02:05,645
Get off!

633
01:02:09,683 --> 01:02:11,549
Get off!

634
01:02:11,551 --> 01:02:13,551
Hold on, Tom!

635
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:54,716
- Alice!

636
01:02:57,721 --> 01:02:59,953
Alice!

637
01:03:03,591 --> 01:03:05,290
Grab my blanket.

638
01:03:09,362 --> 01:03:11,562
It's okay.

639
01:03:13,532 --> 01:03:15,832
- Keep that over her.

640
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:17,567
It's okay, baby.

641
01:03:17,569 --> 01:03:19,335
Okay.

642
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,871
Grab underneath her.
Come on.

643
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,610
Help me bring her up.
Help me bring her up.

644
01:03:29,612 --> 01:03:31,311
Bring her up.
Okay.

645
01:03:38,019 --> 01:03:39,918
Let it snow.

646
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:45,255
'Cause then we can build a fort.

647
01:03:46,424 --> 01:03:48,657
Or a leaf.

648
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:53,460
Or a bird.
We can build a bird.

649
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:59,465
We can make a snowman.

650
01:04:02,736 --> 01:04:04,402
Or we could play the slinky one.

651
01:04:18,951 --> 01:04:21,952
I'm so sorry, buddy.

652
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:14,101
You know, back in the tavern,
they attacked at night.

653
01:05:14,103 --> 01:05:16,336
The head said this would happen.

654
01:05:16,338 --> 01:05:19,839
He also said they'd find new ways
of maintaining their numbers.

655
01:05:19,841 --> 01:05:21,874
You saw what happened
back there, right?

656
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,710
They're not just killing
anymore, they're recruiting.

657
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,345
The pulse is coming
from their mouths now.

658
01:05:27,347 --> 01:05:30,080
They don't need phones anymore.

659
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:01,841
Well, well, well.

660
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:11,116
<i>The President of the Internet
said you'd be coming this way.</i>

661
01:06:11,118 --> 01:06:14,452
And, well, here you are.

662
01:06:14,454 --> 01:06:16,954
- Who are you?
- Why don't you put your shotgun down, my friend?

663
01:06:16,956 --> 01:06:18,922
I'll be happy
to tell you who I am.

664
01:06:20,525 --> 01:06:22,892
I'm Ray Huizenga
from Groveland, mass.

665
01:06:22,894 --> 01:06:26,562
This young lady here, Denise link
from Haverhill, neighboring town.

666
01:06:26,564 --> 01:06:28,430
Meetcha.

667
01:06:28,432 --> 01:06:30,565
<i>But our names don't
actually matter anymore.</i>

668
01:06:30,567 --> 01:06:33,434
What matters... what
matters is what we do.

669
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:37,070
And what we do, hmm?
We kill phone freaks.

670
01:06:37,072 --> 01:06:39,671
Yeah, yeah, we kill them.

671
01:06:41,641 --> 01:06:42,773
Just like you.

672
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:46,876
<i>The second time in Nashua,</i>

673
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:49,078
<i>we used dynamite from
a construction site shed.</i>

674
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,880
<i>Ray knew how to rig the dynamite
from when he worked on a road crew.</i>

675
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:54,682
That's when we started
seeing those Kashwak no-fo signs.

676
01:06:54,684 --> 01:06:56,417
<i>Kashwak.
They're telling people</i>

677
01:06:56,419 --> 01:06:58,185
<i>it's a no-phone zone,
but that's a lie.</i>

678
01:06:58,187 --> 01:07:00,820
The area got an Indian
casino built there last year

679
01:07:00,822 --> 01:07:02,922
and finally put up
a cell phone tower.

680
01:07:02,924 --> 01:07:05,724
The phoners are trying to draw us
there in our dreams, but it's a trap.

681
01:07:05,726 --> 01:07:08,693
<i>Yeah, and the dreams started
coming after we blasted.</i>

682
01:07:08,695 --> 01:07:11,062
I mean, we blasted. That first
flock, we blasted them.

683
01:07:11,064 --> 01:07:13,544
You know, powerful dreams.
Powerful dreams, like...

684
01:07:13,569 --> 01:07:14,498
We've had them.

685
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,633
<i>Always that phoner. The
phoner in the red hoodie.</i>

686
01:07:16,635 --> 01:07:18,434
- <i>They call him the president of the Internet.</i>
- Yeah.

687
01:07:18,436 --> 01:07:20,002
Got to be taken down.
I mean down.

688
01:07:20,004 --> 01:07:22,070
Like, down, like...

689
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:24,739
like right there.

690
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,707
We've got to take him
all the way down.

691
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,476
You know what I'm saying?
You take him all the way down.

692
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:32,079
<i>If you kill him... you kill
him... you put him in here,</i>

693
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,147
<i>the rest will... they'll surrender.
They'll quit.</i>

694
01:07:34,149 --> 01:07:37,884
They'll stop.
Just... poof.

695
01:07:37,886 --> 01:07:39,886
<i>But it's not gonna be easy.
Know why?</i>

696
01:07:39,888 --> 01:07:42,255
<i>Know why? 'Cause they get
inside of people's minds.</i>

697
01:07:42,257 --> 01:07:43,789
They get inside
of people's minds.

698
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:45,257
They get inside your mind, Ray?

699
01:07:45,259 --> 01:07:48,193
No, nothing in my mind.
Because I stay up, hmm?

700
01:07:48,195 --> 01:07:50,161
<i>I've been awake, what, four,
five, six... six days now?</i>

701
01:07:50,163 --> 01:07:51,795
<i>- That's great.</i>
<i>- It's true.</i>

702
01:07:51,797 --> 01:07:53,696
She sleeps in there,
I'm out here guarding.

703
01:07:53,698 --> 01:07:55,931
I'll pace all night.
I'll be all over this park.

704
01:07:55,933 --> 01:07:58,333
- Mary had a little lamb. She's my Mary.
- Aw.

705
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,601
<i>- It's not my kid. Not my kid.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

706
01:08:00,603 --> 01:08:02,569
<i>But she's my Mary.
I'm looking after her.</i>

707
01:08:02,571 --> 01:08:04,904
That's great. Sounds like you
guys are in a good place.

708
01:08:04,906 --> 01:08:06,805
Oh, yeah.

709
01:08:06,807 --> 01:08:09,607
But you know what? We can resist
as long as we stay awake.

710
01:08:09,609 --> 01:08:13,110
Staying awake is key. We just
stay away from the flocks.

711
01:08:13,112 --> 01:08:15,245
How you plan on doing that?

712
01:08:15,247 --> 01:08:18,881
<i> Oh, we got ourselves a
canary in a coal mine, my friend.</i>

713
01:08:18,883 --> 01:08:22,851
Hey, Denise, you want to show them and I'll
finish cooking the burgers with your son?

714
01:08:25,622 --> 01:08:27,989
<i>My brother's doing
more to help me out now</i>

715
01:08:27,991 --> 01:08:30,157
<i>than he ever did
when he was human.</i>

716
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:32,726
I still hate
to see him like this.

717
01:08:33,862 --> 01:08:35,728
- He's a phoner?
- Yup.

718
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:38,363
<i>Yeah, he's like a little calf</i>

719
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:41,132
that broke off from
the herd and got lost.

720
01:08:41,134 --> 01:08:43,067
On its own, he's nothing.

721
01:08:43,069 --> 01:08:46,203
He just sits here and waits for
them to come back and find it

722
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,704
or else he dies.

723
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,173
God, he hasn't been eating.

724
01:08:51,175 --> 01:08:53,074
Come on, don't do this to me.

725
01:08:53,076 --> 01:08:56,310
If a flock passes
within a mile or so,

726
01:08:56,312 --> 01:08:59,346
he starts coming to
and acting up.

727
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:02,148
The closer they are,
the crazier he gets.

728
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:04,216
That's why we got
him covered up.

729
01:09:04,218 --> 01:09:07,152
We don't want him showing them where
we are and bringing them down on us.

730
01:09:07,154 --> 01:09:10,688
<i>Come on, don't do this to me.</i>

731
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,226
Sometimes I think he can
still recognize my voice.

732
01:09:19,763 --> 01:09:22,864
- You think they can be rehabbed?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

733
01:09:22,866 --> 01:09:25,233
Are you coming home?
Are you coming home?

734
01:09:25,235 --> 01:09:27,635
- What the hell's going on?
- Are you coming home?

735
01:09:27,637 --> 01:09:30,104
I have no idea. He never
said anything before.

736
01:09:30,106 --> 01:09:32,106
<i>Are you coming home?
Are you coming home?</i>

737
01:09:32,108 --> 01:09:34,208
Are you coming home?
Are you coming home?

738
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:35,876
<i>I just want you to come home.</i>

739
01:09:35,878 --> 01:09:37,310
- That's Johnny's voice.
- No, it's not.

740
01:09:37,312 --> 01:09:39,245
<i>I just want you to come home.</i>

741
01:09:39,247 --> 01:09:41,013
<i>- Do not listen to that shit.</i>
- Are you coming home?

742
01:09:41,015 --> 01:09:43,215
You know that is not your son.

743
01:09:43,217 --> 01:09:45,417
- <i>Clay, no!</i>
- Hi, dad.

744
01:09:45,419 --> 01:09:48,820
<i> No! No! No!</i>

745
01:09:48,822 --> 01:09:50,855
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

746
01:09:50,857 --> 01:09:53,057
<i>- He was my brother.
- He saw us, that means they saw us.</i>

747
01:09:53,059 --> 01:09:54,992
He'll lead the rest of them to us.
Come on.

748
01:09:54,994 --> 01:09:56,793
<i>Hey, we all need to go now.</i>

749
01:09:56,795 --> 01:09:58,394
<i>- Come on.</i>
<i>- Everybody to the truck.</i>

750
01:09:58,396 --> 01:10:00,229
<i>Clay, come on.</i>

751
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:50,977
Why are we stopping, Ray?

752
01:11:33,254 --> 01:11:36,154
<i> No, it's too late for me. It's too
late for me because they're in my head.</i>

753
01:11:36,156 --> 01:11:38,756
At first it was in my dreams, but now
I'm seeing stuff when I'm awake.

754
01:11:38,758 --> 01:11:41,325
Things that aren't there.

755
01:11:41,327 --> 01:11:44,194
You haven't slept for a week.
Maybe you were hallucinating.

756
01:11:44,196 --> 01:11:46,162
I'm hallucinating because that
asshole in the red hoodie

757
01:11:46,164 --> 01:11:47,796
is putting thoughts in my mind.

758
01:11:47,798 --> 01:11:49,164
And what the Prez wants,
he's not gonna get

759
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:50,965
because you're
not gonna let him.

760
01:11:50,967 --> 01:11:53,133
They thought it was me,
but it wasn't me.

761
01:11:53,135 --> 01:11:54,968
It wasn't me, it's you.
He was wrong.

762
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:57,270
<i>You're the man, my artist.
You are it.</i>

763
01:11:57,272 --> 01:11:59,105
What's that around
your neck, Ray?

764
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:00,506
I don't like it that you're
holding on to your kid

765
01:12:00,508 --> 01:12:02,407
because your kid is done.
Your kid is done.

766
01:12:02,409 --> 01:12:04,842
You know it in your heart
that your kid is toast.

767
01:12:04,844 --> 01:12:06,543
- Your kid is toast.
- No, I don't.

768
01:12:06,545 --> 01:12:09,012
I don't know that.

769
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:13,516
Oh!

770
01:12:13,518 --> 01:12:16,118
Here. Here.

771
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:19,020
I'm passing the torch.
I'm passing it on to you.

772
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:24,191
When the time comes,
call the number on the slip.

773
01:12:24,193 --> 01:12:26,159
You'll know the time.
I hope you know the time.

774
01:12:26,161 --> 01:12:28,895
- What time is that, Ray?
- The end of the road time.

775
01:12:28,897 --> 01:12:31,497
The end of the road.
Mmm.

776
01:12:31,499 --> 01:12:35,067
No other options.

777
01:12:35,069 --> 01:12:38,904
Ray, what's that
around your neck?

778
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:46,276
- This, my friend, this is gonna...
- <i>Ray.</i>

779
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:48,344
This is gonna blow my mind. You
better step away, my friend.

780
01:12:48,346 --> 01:12:51,814
- Okay. Hold on.
- <i>Step away, Clay!</i>

781
01:13:58,913 --> 01:14:00,379
Stay here.
I'll be back.

782
01:14:00,381 --> 01:14:02,013
No, no, no, no.
I'm going with you.

783
01:14:02,015 --> 01:14:03,647
No, no, no.
Just stay with them.

784
01:14:03,649 --> 01:14:05,649
I've got to do this alone.

785
01:14:34,612 --> 01:14:36,411
Johnny!

786
01:14:38,314 --> 01:14:40,514
Sharon!

787
01:18:35,738 --> 01:18:37,204
Get off.

788
01:18:42,711 --> 01:18:44,410
Get off.

789
01:19:11,935 --> 01:19:13,668
Fucker!

790
01:19:51,839 --> 01:19:53,505
<i>Is that...?</i>

791
01:19:55,475 --> 01:19:57,308
Yeah.

792
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,587
So what you got there?

793
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:46,755
That?

794
01:20:46,757 --> 01:20:49,524
Ray gave that to me.

795
01:20:49,526 --> 01:20:52,260
Right before
he blew his head off.

796
01:20:52,262 --> 01:20:54,996
<i>He told me to call the
number when the time came.</i>

797
01:20:54,998 --> 01:20:57,031
When the time came?

798
01:20:57,033 --> 01:20:58,766
Uh-huh.

799
01:20:58,768 --> 01:21:00,901
When's that?

800
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:02,669
<i>Last stop.</i>

801
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:04,437
End of the line.

802
01:21:06,374 --> 01:21:07,973
That's what he said?

803
01:21:07,975 --> 01:21:10,008
<i>That's what he said.</i>

804
01:21:11,411 --> 01:21:13,377
<i>Hmm.</i>

805
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:16,713
Seemed like a reasonable man.

806
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:38,900
Did you know
there was a bomb in here?

807
01:21:38,902 --> 01:21:41,602
No, or I wouldn't
have ridden in it.

808
01:21:41,604 --> 01:21:45,672
So did Ray tell you
this thing was full of c-4?

809
01:21:45,674 --> 01:21:48,374
There's enough plastique in there to
blow up this whole fucking block.

810
01:21:48,376 --> 01:21:51,610
<i>- Oh, my god.</i>
- Here, this is Sharon's wagon.

811
01:21:51,612 --> 01:21:53,544
It's in the garage.

812
01:21:56,782 --> 01:21:58,982
I'm going to Kashwak.

813
01:21:58,984 --> 01:22:00,917
Are you out of your mind?

814
01:22:00,919 --> 01:22:03,586
Did you not hear
what Denise said?

815
01:22:03,588 --> 01:22:04,987
It's a trap.
We've been through this.

816
01:22:04,989 --> 01:22:06,688
Maybe.

817
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:08,589
Come on, man.

818
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:10,457
If you're going there,
you're not coming out.

819
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:13,026
It's a suicide mission.
You're gonna die.

820
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:15,528
I got to find my kid.

821
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,963
I got to know
one way or the other.

822
01:22:20,567 --> 01:22:22,733
Oh, god damn.

823
01:22:27,939 --> 01:22:29,605
Take this.

824
01:22:29,607 --> 01:22:31,940
I want you to spray
paint t, j and d

825
01:22:31,942 --> 01:22:33,508
for Tom, Jordan, and Denise

826
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:36,043
on the side of the road
every couple miles.

827
01:22:36,045 --> 01:22:37,644
If you go off-road,
dirt road,

828
01:22:37,646 --> 01:22:39,112
put it up on a tree.

829
01:22:39,114 --> 01:22:40,813
Always on the left-hand
side of the road

830
01:22:40,815 --> 01:22:42,781
'cause that's where
I'll be looking.

831
01:22:42,783 --> 01:22:44,449
Look, don't go.

832
01:22:44,451 --> 01:22:47,018
It's stupid.
You're gonna die.

833
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:48,586
Hey.

834
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:51,121
You remember the story
of Orpheus, buddy?

835
01:22:51,123 --> 01:22:54,524
Orpheus traveled
to the underworld

836
01:22:54,526 --> 01:22:58,126
to find his loved one,
bring them back to earth.

837
01:23:01,064 --> 01:23:03,064
You're not Orpheus.

838
01:23:03,066 --> 01:23:04,965
Take care of yourself, brother.

839
01:23:04,967 --> 01:23:06,099
Be right behind you.

840
01:23:06,101 --> 01:23:08,501
All right?

841
01:23:08,503 --> 01:23:09,735
Take care of Tom.

842
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,180
You know, you're about
the best friend

843
01:23:23,182 --> 01:23:25,582
anybody could ever have
at the end of the world.

844
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:27,984
Well, let's hope
it's not quite the end.

845
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:33,055
Good knowing you, Clay Riddell.

846
01:23:33,057 --> 01:23:35,824
Good to know you, Tom Mccourt.

847
01:23:43,967 --> 01:23:46,634
- Take care.

848
01:23:46,636 --> 01:23:48,802
<i>You better find us.</i>

849
01:23:50,071 --> 01:23:52,271
Sorry about your wife.

850
01:24:21,802 --> 01:24:24,269
- Kashwak, please!
- Pull over!

851
01:24:24,271 --> 01:24:26,771
- Please help us!
- Please help us! Please!

852
01:24:26,773 --> 01:24:28,706
Take us with you!

853
01:28:10,956 --> 01:28:14,457
<i>Hi, dad. Hi, dad.
Hi, dad. Hi, dad.</i>

854
01:28:14,459 --> 01:28:18,194
<i>- Hi, dad. Hi, dad.</i>
<i>- Johnny!</i>

855
01:28:18,196 --> 01:28:22,765
- <i>Johnny!
