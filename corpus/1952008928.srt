1
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,243
People also wondered

2
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,371
What is a rocker?

3
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:41,375
It's not battery and drugs.

4
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:44,670
Oh, no.

5
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,798
It is much more than that, buddy.

6
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,926
We have a good life.

7
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,011
Some love the money.

8
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,097
Some drugs.

9
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:59,393
Other sex, glamor, the struggle.

10
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,481
But it is always a rocker
different.

11
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,567
Why?

12
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,071
Because a real
rocker wants love.

14
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:53,488
My name is Archie, of Archivel.

15
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,867
I work for Lenny.

16
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:03,916
Let me give you an example that
Lenny's world is magical.

17
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,044
Two years ago, this property costing
1 million pounds.

18
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:10,172
Today: 5 million.

19
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,257
How did this happen?

20
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:17,471
attracting an opportunity for tax
foreign investment

21
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,599
London, my friend, is rapidly
becoming the financial capital

22
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,684
and the cultural world.

23
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,480
London is another world.

24
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:31,652
All the world struggle to get out alive.

25
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,197
I can not teach you how despellejar
cat,

26
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,325
but I can tell you many things
about the money that makes the difference.

27
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:43,539
As he said, going in one direction.
You need a lawyer.

28
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,667
We need a lawyer.

29
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,752
Good business.

30
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,923
These are the work permits,
cost 10.

31
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,094
First we have to take the radish
by the leaves. The same agent before.

32
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:01,265
I will tell you to develop the planes.
Thank you, counsel.

33
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:07,437
Do you have plans, you take
the attorney and got the runner.

34
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,649
I need your help, Daddy called.

35
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:14,820
We have to move fast and try
the ground.

36
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,948
We have to move fast and make
a little more.

37
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:22,119
It is always safer to invest in property,
but we must know how to do it,

38
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,204
because it is not easy money.

39
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,375
Because of the criminal record of these
types, it accomplishes what the bank can not

40
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,503
It is so called Mr. Lenny el
Wizard of money laundering and

41
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,631
false transfer of properties
London.

42
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,717
No. I am disappointed, guys.

43
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,802
Give me your hands.
And then it does

44
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:44,975
its transformation from black
magic. There are big problems.

45
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,229
Sorry, guys, do not get the plans.

46
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:53,400
That was an unpleasant surprise because
Lenny never happens to that.

47
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,485
You can not get the planes.

48
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,614
It is everything we do.
You can not get both?

49
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,699
What jodieron.

50
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,784
What do you mean by that can not
get the damn planes?

51
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,870
They owe me.

52
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:09,041
I get the building and you lose
your part.

53
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,126
And yet I am being magnanimous.

54
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,212
Find.

55
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,340
We had to find Lenny before
to end the month.

56
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:21,553
because the way he had. Carlile
to earn a living was very uncomfortable.

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,639
You have to find it.

58
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,809
What I do not know is that Lenny controls
counsel, judges and all.

59
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,938
Not cocheriza no work permit
until Lenny did not "move".

60
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,066
And as does the building, wants
your permission.

61
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,151
Hi, lawyer?

62
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,237
Yes.

63
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,322
Yes

64
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,450
I heard who got the money.

65
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:47,621
Yes, he was very generous, Lenny.
Sure. Now it resolves the plane.

66
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,250
Already done.
Good.

67
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,005
What is the problem, Archie?

68
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,133
That was a bit strong.

69
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,304
I mean, I come from the same
place than you and you seem more violent.

70
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,475
In the same place that I? ¿Quieres
sound a damn immigrant?

71
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:14,731
I do not download. They need a
bit of fear or will be against me.

72
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,860
I have to teach them a lesson,
Did not it?

73
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,906
Here is an example of how it operates Lenny.

74
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,457
Today is the big day for Lenny.

75
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,586
There is a great opportunity, a new
Russian billionaire wants contacts

76
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,671
Lenny buildings.

77
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:42,801
He wants permission to work for
a property.

78
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:48,098
Lenny took the step to the front, insurance
take the deal with Russian.

79
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,184
Nice to see you.

80
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,228
Take a seat.

81
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,482
Excuse the rush, but I have a day
busy.

82
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,360
Sit down.

83
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:05,115
I can see that we are very similar.

84
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,952
We want things done.

85
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,080
How much is going to cost me?
First let me clarify exactly

86
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,209
how you can benefit
this business.

87
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:21,465
Without me, I would have to wait 5
to 10 years to get permission to work.

88
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:25,636
Second, the British Law
A minute.

89
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,514
How much?

90
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,060
7 million euros.

91
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:42,319
I hope to have the assurance that I
awarded in 6 months and without bureaucracy.

92
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,697
Deal, it as fact.

93
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,284
A drink?

94
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,083
This painting is very nice, Yuri.

95
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,088
This painting has brought me just Luckily,
Lenny.

96
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,216
It is my painting of good luck.

97
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,094
He likes?

98
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:12,474
take it for a while. You may be
given luck.

99
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,643
Oh, no, could not.

100
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:20,899
Do not refuse, I insist. Take it
to their home and when I returned

101
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,778
I have given the license.

102
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,326
I thought you were drinking vodka.
The whiskey is the new vodka.

103
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,622
Did not with me?
Do not drink.

104
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,004
Health.
Health.

105
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,223
Are you okay?

106
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,768
You're a little red.

107
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,898
Give me some water.

108
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:05,736
He tried to poison the very bloody.

109
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:09,907
Leave it, give me the bottle.
Okay, Lenny.

110
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,035
That man is a billionaire.

111
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:17,331
Well, let me tell you something.

112
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:22,419
We have a great opportunity here.

113
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,547
What is it? ¿Dónde is the famous
smile of Archie?

114
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,718
I do not want to see you suffer. Are crazy
by change.

115
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,803
They do not respect the old school.

116
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,974
Oh, my God, there is no school like
old and I'm the damn director.

117
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:40,646
That's why he came to me. ¿Entendiste?

118
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,608
Yes, I understood.

119
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,530
You're sure of what to paint?

120
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:55,452
It's the best. Not so welcome to lose,
they need it now.

121
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,871
I want this to Cusack.

122
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,957
Call the accountant and tell him to wipe
money.

123
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:04,127
If you want to understand Yuri contacts
Lenny, you have to do

124
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:09,341
with cash and for that
you need your personal accountant,

125
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:14,513
the very talented creative financial
Stella.

126
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:19,768
Always get the accounts? Why
looking for you in this pitiful that fat

127
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:23,313
sweating like crazy.

128
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:29,152
You, my love, you're a good
peculiar.

129
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,281
Come on, you look better smiling.

130
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,366
I do not feel like smiling.

131
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:39,580
My accountant of 30 years met
at a gay lawyer.

132
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,708
In the midst of our case.

133
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:48,088
The greatest conveniences become
inconvenience.

134
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,178
Yes, here it is.

135
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,220
This is it.

136
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,348
You're sure he is not gay?

137
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,519
But what the Russian did not know was that
his accountant grew weary of life secure,

138
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:07,733
emotion and seeks nothing in places
appropriate.

139
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,861
Welcome to SPIL.

140
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:15,407
This is the home of organized crime.

141
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:22,331
So if you get 5
¿entiendes, Bob? Do not save anything.

142
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,416
What are you talking about?

143
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,544
Bertie had drugs.

144
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,423
I was smoking throughout.

145
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,800
Okay, guys.

146
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:34,843
What to do?

147
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,514
Are vagueando as ever?

148
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,892
Fuck you.

149
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:55,697
But in the world of crime, always
there are coincidences.

150
00:10:55,864 --> 00:11:01,954
And the men who need it are the
same as Lenny has at his command.

151
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,039
Who is the girl?

152
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:08,210
You know the girl who manages
accounts?

153
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:12,381
Ah, yes, of the accounts safe.

154
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:18,470
Well, he wants to do a job.

155
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:26,979
Normally it would reject, but I think
I'm not in a position to do so.

156
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,023
I am inside.

157
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:48,876
At home had these, but for fishing.

158
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,004
From where I come to you that they call
human ingenuity.

159
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:56,550
Are what they call art where
next?

160
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,345
You do know how to entertain.

161
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,473
He also knows how to get there late.

162
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,394
Please do not arrive late.

163
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,114
I have a job that may interest you.
Say?

164
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:23,285
There are two accounts of 7 million euros

165
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,413
we must protect.

166
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,042
The details are here.

167
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,712
¿Algo more?

168
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,840
Yes. I do not want me to be retaliation.

169
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,761
You can strikeouts an eye.

170
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:45,516
Only one eye punches, nothing more.

171
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:51,021
So do not release, only
poncho an eye.

172
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,694
Cute shoes.

173
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,780
Thank you.

174
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:05,035
You can buy a few equals in a
couple of days.

175
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,292
The rock star, Johnny Quit, is
disappeared.

176
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:18,549
It is believed that he died yesterday at
the fall of a yacht that possibly belong to

177
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,553
A prominent tycoon fashion.

178
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,890
Sorry, I do not know what to say.

179
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,769
Yes, I bet it took a few.

180
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:40,237
Do not mention it again another time.
ZDE agreement, Arch?

181
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:48,912
Tell the lawyer who ceases to
fuck with the damn ball and that.

182
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,043
Okay, great, lawyer.

183
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,172
He has learned the lesson well.

184
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,257
Ashley Cougar.

185
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,927
Go to talk with Lenny.

186
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:09,641
You know Jackie?
No, Archie. Please do not say anything.

187
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:14,855
Do not worry, Ash, is very good
friend of mine.

188
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,940
Y is a member.

189
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:21,111
Hey, sweet talk ¿quieres
a while with the lawyer?

190
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,781
Only if a case "weak".

191
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,453
What you mean by that?

192
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,582
We do not pay much attention.

193
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,794
Ven.

194
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,923
Here you go, plans.

195
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,093
When you're on board with Lenny, he
likes big move.

196
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,179
You want a cigar?

197
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:51,350
I would love to.
Love at first row

198
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:55,354
with a new car on the road.

199
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,691
The skill lies in knowing Lenny
when hit low.

200
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,777
Bonita fosforera.

201
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:05,656
Costa 8 billion and paid.

202
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,204
You know what?
Tell me, Lenny.

203
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:16,375
Everything lies in the details.

204
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,503
There's also a good business there.

205
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,132
Look at Lenny, plays with everything.

206
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:29,930
Only paid 100 pounds by the fosforera
and makes the lawyer want to do.

207
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,015
I do not forget that.

208
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,101
First, what is most important.

209
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:38,272
The best thing about Lenny is that whenever
goes one step further.

210
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,400
You leave that.
Now you only need a lawyer

211
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,528
a few hours on the track,
so what

212
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:49,741
We stay in touch.
I am calling for the morning.

213
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:54,955
And then, the shot from the left.
Cuídalo, Jackie.

214
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:58,083
Lenny, you forgot your fosforera.

215
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,087
I would not say it is mine.

216
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:06,300
Have your name.
"Advocate"

217
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:11,638
Nothing is to prevent Lenny make the
big business in Russian.

218
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,724
I knew that he would like the fosforera.

219
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,809
It was a nice touch, do not they?

220
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:19,980
Yes, Jackie is a good girl. Dale
another drink.

221
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,023
Yes.

222
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,065
You're quite right.

223
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:27,279
I am not going to give his preferred
painting if I would not want to do business.

224
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:32,492
Yes, I removed the pedestal and put him in
the wall.

225
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,663
Yes, it seems Archie, painting

226
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,791
Archie

227
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,877
Archie, I have stolen.

228
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,922
What? Hello?

229
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:49,176
I said I stole.

230
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,261
Yes, I do not know when.

231
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:55,641
The painting, which gave me Yuri.

232
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,145
Okay.

233
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:07,945
Archie, this is not good. It is his painting
preferred.

234
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:11,573
His painting of luck.

235
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,201
Yes, robbed.

236
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:17,329
Come here and to bring the troops.

237
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:19,414
Yes.

238
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,457
Oh, shit.

239
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:25,671
It is in cases like this that what
Lenny gets to want what you want

240
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,968
Lenny gets mad and
Archie comes to the rescue.

241
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,391
Where was, Lenny?

242
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:44,273
Let's stop throwing stones.

243
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:48,610
Archie, abofetéalo, Mandal back
to school because he did not resist this.

244
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:53,824
Resolve this. Recover the painting.
Bring me a body.

245
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:57,703
Because I'm going to bed.

246
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,294
Ban, if you ask a question so
mierdera like that again,

247
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,379
Danny is going to slap you.

248
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,507
I am sorry, Archie. I just wanted to take
initiative.

249
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,927
Danny, abofetéalo.

250
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:19,892
With the right, Danny. As it should be.

251
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:24,062
No, no and no. Do it as it should, with
the back of his right hand.

252
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:28,817
Leave it already, Archie.
Abofetéalo.

253
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,197
Oh, damn.

254
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,660
Pay attention.

255
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:43,665
Learn how to slap well, nobody te
resist.

256
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:49,087
The whole world will open as a source
full of words.

257
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,173
There is no need for excessive violence.

258
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,344
transport you back to your childhood.

259
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:58,472
The past is in your hands.

260
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,600
Look, I think that again is in
the school.

261
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,685
He did not go to school, Archie.

262
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:07,856
You want me to also slapped you?

263
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:10,984
Well, if the slaps are not working,

264
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:15,155
what you pay cut or,
but keep the receipt.

265
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:19,159
Let's go find the painting.

266
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,967
Hello.

267
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,009
Hello.
Hello.

268
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:40,180
Put luggage in the car, lock
the door and leave.

269
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,223
I listened.

270
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,436
Leave the keys, dense round, look
at the head and smile.

271
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,565
Well, Are a robbery?

272
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,650
Yes, it is a robbery.

273
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,735
Move.

274
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,655
Thank you.

275
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:03,704
That was easy.
As I thought about it.

276
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,048
Yes.

277
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,595
Yes, well.

278
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:40,199
How it started this?
You have to remove the emergency.

279
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,873
Now get out.

280
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:11,897
Any electrician was able to do a
four years.

281
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:19,238
Welcome to the new Bourish, sir. Wantoo.

282
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,323
Here I also have something for you,
Mrs. Baxter.

283
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,451
What elegant!

284
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:32,751
If this seems heavy, imagine if
what counts.

285
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,878
It seems that did not need as many eyes
strikeouts.

286
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:39,049
I would have liked, but from the point
professional standpoint,

287
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,719
I do not seem natural.

288
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,515
Until next time.

289
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:50,060
Maybe.

290
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:05,868
This place has been waiting for
4 years.

291
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:16,086
The area covers all this and become
in one of my permanent residences.

292
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,925
Excuse me, sir.

293
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,889
What is it?

294
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,099
stolen at the counters.

295
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,185
We lost 7 million.

296
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,270
They know who we are?

297
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:35,355
It's not like in the old continent.

298
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,441
There are only out cowboys and Indians.

299
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,526
We do not have time to game.

300
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:43,405
There are people waiting.

301
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:48,911
Pick up to the counter
and looking for more money.

302
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:52,164
Victor, Victor.

303
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:59,671
Let there be no problems this time.

304
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,637
Hey, Archie.
Speak, Lord.

305
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,679
I have pasta for Lenny.

306
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,765
¿Todo?

307
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:12,893
Yes and the thing is hot

308
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,978
so you better come and get it before
I burn.

309
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,064
I'm going to SPIL.

310
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:20,943
Wait, I got another call.

311
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,363
¿Lenny? Archie, the Russian
did not come with the money.

312
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,534
Do not worry, the lawyer may
wait. I have good news.

313
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,662
It is your pasta.

314
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:34,790
Everything?
This is what I said.

315
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:36,875
Where the removed?
No idea, I do not want to know.

316
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:41,046
Listen, all we have
to do is get the permit.

317
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:44,174
Yes, sure to succeed.

318
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,260
Listen, I got another call.

319
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:49,388
Hello.
All my people are waiting, Lenny.

320
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:50,430
I can not fail.

321
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:54,601
Who said you would? It is only a
backlog, a lawyer.

322
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:59,231
Well, call me soon.
Yes, of course.

323
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,985
Look at Tanks.

324
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,754
Hey, Arch.

325
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:25,883
¿Quieres some tickets?
No, I'm looking for Tanks

326
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:30,179
You know you do not like to see.

327
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,267
Look at that street.

328
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:39,438
Tanks owns the tickets for the
organization west of London.

329
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:43,609
He knows most of the street themselves
street.

330
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:47,779
Tanks world is fortified
disguised as information.

331
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,865
Hello.
Hello.

332
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:51,950
What do you do?
I need to talk.

333
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:56,246
You must be in trouble.
Enter.

334
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,550
I love this.

335
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,890
Look at that picture.

336
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:18,644
The sound is exquisite.

337
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,360
Sorry, Archie, ¿quieres tickets?
I do not want tickets.

338
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:30,531
I am looking for
a painting, a classical painting.

339
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:34,535
We took her home for Lenny.

340
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:38,872
I am going to leave a breakthrough.

341
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:44,086
We have only a couple of hours before
it is known.

342
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:46,630
Yes?

343
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,299
Here it is.

344
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:54,513
For years there had been an informer
very well hidden.

345
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,934
And our boy from the grass stalks.

346
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,812
Well, tell me.

347
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:04,940
What's new on the streets?

348
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:08,819
Please, Frank. Again, no.

349
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,239
Sorry, partner, you're not so
important.

350
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,324
But what the situation is getting worse

351
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:17,452
everybody knows that
the dirty rat

352
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,581
lurking and waiting time of the attack.

353
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,709
Good evening, gentlemen.

354
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:25,794
Beautiful hat, beautiful.

355
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,922
What the hell you?

356
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:32,551
Gentlemen, was angry.

357
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:40,392
I have to apologize for the flaws
my sister.

358
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,520
It has extremely long arms and a
neck scandalously short.

359
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:48,192
This is why we wear a coat
Versache.

360
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:52,905
This is fashion.
I're interrupting.

361
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,990
Whatever. Christmas is always
around the corner.

362
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:57,075
Whenever you're in the same stupidity.

363
00:26:57,242 --> 00:27:02,289
Leave the sillies, tell us the price
and then leave.

364
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:06,043
Hold on now, gentlemen.

365
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:10,631
Lord, we have many good things
tonight.

366
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13,759
Journals very, very rich.

367
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:18,972
The drogatas, as would any
drogata, are not trustworthy.

368
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:21,058
The reality does not belong to them.

369
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:24,186
Not because I do not believe
him, but because they are drugged.

370
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:27,105
Satisfied?

371
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,399
A huge rock in the middle of the road
can not seem peculiar

372
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:32,819
a regular drogata.

373
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:37,741
The film is set in the
darkness.

374
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:41,495
In the dark of Siberia.

375
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:53,590
And we could all be there,
to the menacing wolf.

376
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,510
Hey, Arch

377
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,595
Come here, son.

378
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:02,099
You two, lárguense.

379
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:14,152
My legal paperwork
mysteriously disappeared

380
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:16,780
Hola

381
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:24,079
Hola

382
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,877
I see you brought your dog with you

383
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:33,005
That's very unkind

384
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:35,090
You might want to be careful

385
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:38,260
Bite
Really?

386
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,432
I am afraid that is fairly quiet

387
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,517
I do not know why

388
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,603
So it's best

389
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,397
How well

390
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:53,859
Let ¿Dónde is?

391
00:28:54,026 --> 00:28:58,489
You can not smell it?
No, I can not

392
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:08,457
Look at that, we could be a team

393
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:11,585
Did not you like that?

394
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:12,628
By the way

395
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:16,798
This is yours. Buy a
new pair of shoes or something

396
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,884
Yes?

397
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:22,930
Did not you bloody friendly?

398
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:26,475
Good evening, dear

399
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:31,480
They say they are only two days

400
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:35,567
On the day you buy and you sell

401
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:38,695
Well, I agree with my
Vegas that sounds correct

402
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:39,738
What you gonna do?

403
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,824
Beauty is a cruel mistress

404
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,994
I remember that phrase
Whatever

405
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:50,040
We worship more?
No thanks

406
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:54,336
You know I like you

407
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,421
I like the way you are

408
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,507
Always thinking about business

409
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:03,136
Very competent
That Did not pay me?

410
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:07,641
Tell me about your husband

411
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:12,062
My husband is a lawyer
I heard it is very good at what he does

412
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:16,191
Maybe I can get
a job. Dime

413
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:20,779
What to do for fun?

414
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:26,660
I am offending in any way?

415
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,745
Like you said I am a professional

416
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:31,874
And you are my employer and
so long as

417
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,002
Why be offended?

418
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,087
You see, Hector?

419
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:39,173
That's what I'm talking

420
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,258
This is what I like about this place

421
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,301
They understand the hierarchy

422
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:44,386
You do your job, I do mine

423
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:46,471
And we all get along

424
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:49,600
We are talking about business again

425
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,685
We have bigger problems

426
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:54,813
To make the story short

427
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,899
I need 7 million euros

428
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,984
lost in the books

429
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:03,155
Look, I'm the best at what I do

430
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:06,283
I can certainly get
a portion of that money but

431
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,454
I can not even hide
7 billion of taxes

432
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:12,539
But if you're so good

433
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:16,084
Diablo. Let me think

434
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:20,506
There are always options

435
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,593
Thanks

436
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,778
Come on, boy

437
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:47,157
Rejoice
Why not tomorrow night?

438
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,077
That's OK tomorrow night?

439
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:53,205
So tonight it is time to have fun

440
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:56,333
And we have a feast
planned for you, my partner

441
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,461
We must relax tensions

442
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:02,589
We have the most sexy twins

443
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:05,717
Probably escorts
most expensive in history

444
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:12,349
They have the night off from the Russians
and the Greeks only by us

445
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:18,230
OK, I see that you do not encourage

446
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:22,985
There is not
grateful, it's just that

447
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,529
What? What is it?

448
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:29,700
I do not understand
Come on, Bobby. That is not fair

449
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:33,871
I do not understand anything coming from you

450
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:36,415
Okay

451
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:40,752
Bob, you're my best man

452
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:47,885
This is not what I have always wanted

453
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:52,764
I refer to this

454
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:56,226
Yes?

455
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:14,661
Bloody bastard!

456
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:18,707
Look, you have offered
all as friends!

457
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:20,792
I told you not understand

458
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:24,963
What? Did not understand that you're a damn?

459
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,091
I could not wait to kill him

460
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:30,177
That you are

461
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:32,262
Goddamn!

462
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:35,390
In other words, which I did cagara
in the fucking pants!

463
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:39,561
I should have kept his mouth shut!
Yes, of course you should!

464
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:43,732
O have gone without bother with this!

465
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:47,903
You're just a kid, you do not know

466
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,447
Shit

467
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:10,843
I am so sorry

468
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:17,599
Sorry
No, I'm sorry

469
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:20,227
No, I'm sorry
No, I'm sorry

470
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:23,355
No, I am hell! Zest right?

471
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:25,440
I spent

472
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:29,611
And it was a damn surprise, Bob

473
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:32,781
By God!
Okay

474
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:39,663
Okay. Everything is fine

475
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:43,584
I feel like an idiot

476
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:51,508
I do not know what I was thinking

477
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:55,804
It is normal that I do not think

478
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,850
as you call it

479
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:04,396
You know there are not many like you

480
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,609
Probably you'll love

481
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:11,778
God!

482
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:20,704
What exactly?

483
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:24,750
want to do?

484
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:34,259
¿Quieres a drink?
No thanks

485
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:37,888
I do not at this time

486
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,940
Everything is very sophisticated

487
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,985
Details Scandinavian
English mixed with details

488
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:54,905
Nice touch

489
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,242
Look at that
How?

490
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:02,412
Century 19, of Amsterdam, master Bence

491
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,498
Is that true?
You know

492
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:08,669
I am not the man who look like

493
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,173
Go

494
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,224
You know why they call me Tank, no?

495
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:25,352
I guess because they're dirty
Think. Tank

496
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,023
Nothing comes out of the tank. Nothing

497
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:33,694
Apart from that, I have
a few questions

498
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:35,779
For this reason I came to see you

499
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:39,575
I think there's new news

500
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:42,494
Yes?

501
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:44,121
OK!

502
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:47,249
Let me tell you. You
take a few sips

503
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,334
I and a cup of tea

504
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:53,380
Their fate hangs by a thread

505
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:58,719
I do not have much time to lose

506
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:01,847
After that, I'm going to
make a question

507
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:02,890
Just one question

508
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,975
I get a name

509
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:07,060
And if the name
correctly, the sending home

510
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:10,189
with their wives and nothing happened here

511
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:12,274
If the name is wrong

512
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:14,359
will be food for fish

513
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:16,445
Are Americans

514
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:19,573
These fish are hungry bastards

515
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,701
Like most things
U.S. are dazzling

516
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:25,829
but still are implacable

517
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:28,749
Muéstrales

518
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:33,504
Okay, we are. Enjoy

519
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:51,897
These fish were Americans
introduced here in the 20s

520
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:55,025
A gift should I add

521
00:37:55,192 --> 00:38:00,030
It seems being
fun and did not want to go

522
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:01,281
You spent 50 years

523
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:04,409
They began to feed on other fish

524
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:07,538
The exterminated

525
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:11,792
After started eating each other

526
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,965
That suggests greed

527
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,968
It is blind

528
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:25,264
We do not know when to stop

529
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,809
That's why I am here

530
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:33,605
To continue to give war. Danny!

531
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:37,359
Do not let down so long

532
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:59,923
Sure. Already had enough. One name

533
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:09,057
The singer of the group. The Quittakers

534
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:12,186
It's covered in blood Did not?

535
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:14,271
How a dead man
can send to a party?

536
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:18,442
No, not dead. I know it is not dead
because it is celebrating with a few girls

537
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:21,570
It's as obsessed
Oh, please

538
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:24,698
Do not mess with me!

539
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:27,826
Please, you would never

540
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:31,997
I do not know, never lie to him,
never in life!

541
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:34,875
Let me go

542
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,006
I think

543
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:53,894
Double Identity
t you dare get in this

544
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:58,065
You know I think you have
an excellent staff

545
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:00,150
But it might be true

546
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:03,278
I thought you had died
as a cockroach!

547
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:07,449
That junkie has had
more funerals than anyone

548
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:12,996
and I say that the next
World War, nor will damage

549
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:19,962
Find this moron
used to be their manager

550
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:23,090
as it was called

551
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:25,175
Greek and Meny
Robert and Mickey

552
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:27,261
Yeah, whatever

553
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:30,389
Go see what you can find

554
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:31,431
Take care!

555
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:33,517
You're not listening to what I say

556
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:38,313
It is exactly
I need the damn dry ice!

557
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:39,773
My show does not work without it

558
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,859
Wait a second

559
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:44,987
If you'd asked me yesterday your dry ice

560
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:47,072
You have achieved the
more dry ice in the world

561
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,158
but I did not ask for dry ice

562
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:52,286
I asked two Johnny
Walker, Black Label

563
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,371
Y 4 girls

564
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:57,499
You Did not get those?

565
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:58,542
You did

566
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:01,670
I confess, but Mickey

567
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:03,755
You are the manager

568
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:05,841
I am the rock

569
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:10,012
You have the hat ¿por
what we did not get anything from it?

570
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:12,097
My hat is deep and full of magic

571
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:16,268
I have rabbits, handkerchiefs and
girls taking black label

572
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:21,481
I have cigarette machines,
all, until Marines

573
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:24,610
And yet the head gets more

574
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:25,652
Yes?

575
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:29,531
But there are no dry ice!

576
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,951
I understood

577
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:36,747
But tomorrow get dry ice

578
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,336
¿Viste this?
What?

579
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:45,464
The extraordinary Johnny
Quint fell off the boat

580
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:49,635
They say it is missing,
possibly dead

581
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:51,720
Our Johnny?
How many rock stars

582
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:54,848

583
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:57,976
What is the single fell out of bed

584
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,062
Not as dead as

585
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:01,104
Well?

586
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:04,233
I look as happy as a worm

587
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:05,275
Jill What Johnny is as dead?

588
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:09,446
If you are dead, this is
the third time this year

589
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:13,617
The rockers like him never die

590
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:18,121
They continue to cause pain to live

591
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:38,684
15 years before

592
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,898
Now listen to me, boy

593
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:45,941
Listen

594
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:49,069
I never lied to you, no
I'm your real father

595
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:50,112
You are a rejected

596
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,155
A mistake

597
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:53,240
A stone on the road

598
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:55,325
I never told by your mother
but is no longer with us

599
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:57,411
so we are just you and me

600
00:42:57,578 --> 00:42:59,496
And the following week
go back to school

601
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:03,667
The most expensive school of
this country, I must add

602
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,752
And then you you will be taken to a tour

603
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:06,795
And in the meantime

604
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:08,881
show a little gratitude

605
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:12,634
low and the damn music!

606
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:06,146
Go on, John.

607
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:11,443
I can not, Pete.

608
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,529
It hurts a lot.

609
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,825
Do not give your notes get well.

610
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:21,870
Do not understand.

611
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:26,041
Why not?
Because you are a pig street.

612
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:30,212
What you need is good education.
It's what you need.

613
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:32,297
But your dad does not give a shit,
Did not it?

614
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:37,511
So are you in the game, the game
your pathetic father.

615
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:42,558
Leave it, John. What is this, time
sermon?

616
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:45,853
Come on, Peter.

617
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:48,981
I am the sponsor.

618
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:54,027
Do not be surprised if you start a
regret.

619
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:58,907
But first let's drink.

620
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,664
My dad forced me to see "Benance"
every Sunday after church.

621
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:07,749
That is what they call ruin a
a son.

622
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:11,920
All those silly fools cowboys
with their weapons.

623
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:16,091
Everything was not bad, his songs also
I did laugh.

624
00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:18,177
But now answer something.

625
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:21,305
Have you ever got with you?

626
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:23,390
You know, ZTE touched inappropriately?

627
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:25,475
If you slept with me, do you want
to say.

628
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:29,646
In psychology, there is
a technical term for this situation.

629
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,732
Yes?

630
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:35,360
Tricolatus monstrous.

631
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:39,031
Your father was monstrous.

632
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:42,159
Hey, that's my drink.

633
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:43,202
Go to masturbarte.

634
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:46,705
Stop telling Peter.

635
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,586
You want to fight?

636
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:56,757
Te I will love you and your friends.

637
00:45:56,924 --> 00:46:00,677
Do not look like a pirate?

638
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:05,474
Well, goodbye, piérdanse, lárguense.

639
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:13,440
Way to go. Everything is in the eye.

640
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:17,110
Drug addicts are crap.

641
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:31,750
Hello.

642
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:34,294
I tried to stop him, but

643
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,380
Can not stop.

644
00:46:36,547 --> 00:46:39,508
I think he wants
I just want to talk.

645
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:42,636
Sorry, Mickey.

646
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:43,679

647
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:47,850
Do not worry, June.
Why do not you go to lunch something?

648
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:50,978
Come on, come together.

649
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:54,106
I am sorry to interrupt.

650
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:59,153

Leeshee, Laishee Leeshee.

651
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:13,250

652
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:17,880
Thank you.

653
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,259
We can help you?

654
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:27,431
Have a group called the Quit
ickers? We had.

655
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:37,399
And there are a singer named Johnny Quit.
There were.

656
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:42,070
I would like to see Mr. Quit.
I too would like,

657
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:45,199
there will be a bit difficult because
as newspapers,

658
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:48,327
the only songs that Mr. Quit
sing, hymns will be heavenly.

659
00:47:48,494 --> 00:47:52,498
Echaría a tear a tear for
all the fools who read the newspaper

660
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:55,626
and believe this lie.

661
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:58,754
You saw the body?

662
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:01,882
I saw broken, broken,
with the language in the jaw,

663
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:06,053
swinging as a yacht
true rocker?

664
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:10,474
No, Did not it? And nobody saw it.

665
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:13,352
Why is not dead.

666
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:17,523
It is alive and kicking somewhere

667
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:22,736
painting and has a very important
it does not belong to him.

668
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:27,991
Excuse me, What does that have to do
with us?

669
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:41,505
Who bought the painting?

670
00:48:41,672 --> 00:48:45,801
One name.
Johnny, Johnny Quit.

671
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:53,141
It is the singer of the group
Quit the Lickers.

672
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:57,145
How can a dead ve
bought a painting?

673
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:02,359
Not dead, not dead, I know that
it is not because I bought it.

674
00:49:02,526 --> 00:49:07,573
Son of a bitch. Bájenlo of there before
shoot him.

675
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:12,786
Please do not kill me, I will make what
want.

676
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:16,707
I do not know where he is.

677
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:24,173
We can talk?

678
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:33,640
Your kid is not dead, Did not it?

679
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,726
Do not you dare to call him "my boy. "

680
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:39,897
You know this maniac, is the
stepson of Boris.

681
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:43,025
He wants to be close to the art, Did not it?

682
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:46,153
No one dies damn cockroach.

683
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:50,324
That damn junkie has seen many deaths
and there are those who do not find it.

684
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:55,871
I'm telling you, the next war
world bear his name.

685
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:01,793
Go see if you can find the idiot
who was his manager

686
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:07,007
that is called Cleanfield Ricky
They call him Mickey.

687
00:50:07,174 --> 00:50:10,135
Yeah, whatever.

688
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:13,388
Find the idiot.

689
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:17,434
No, you're not listening to what I say.

690
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:20,562
I need drugs.

691
00:50:22,815 --> 00:50:23,690
Wait a second.

692
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:28,904
If you'd asked me yesterday
yesterday, you would have

693
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:32,032
the best in the world, but I do not
ask no dry ice.

694
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:37,246
I asked for two boxes of Jonnhy Walker,
black label.

695
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:40,374
And you get those, Did not it?

696
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:45,587
Yes, you did, I confess.
But Mickey, you're the manager.

697
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:47,673
I am the rock.

698
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,844
You got your hat, why not get
a little inside?

699
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,929
My hat is deep and is filled
magic.

700
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:58,809
I have rabbits, scarves and other tricks.

701
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:03,313
I have smoke machines, bubble,
everything.

702
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,317
And the hat is even deeper.

703
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:12,698
Well, there is no fucking drugs
Agreed.

704
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:15,826
I understand.

705
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:17,911
So tenlo morning.

706
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:21,915

00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:25,210
read this?
What?

708
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:29,381
The extraordinary Johnny Quit fell
a yacht, is missing

709
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:31,466
is believed to be dead.

710
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:33,552
Our Johnny?

711
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:36,680
How many rock stars calls
Johnny Quit know, Mickey?

712
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:39,808
The only thing that I think could fall es
spoon to prepare their drugs.

713
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:42,936
Not dead. Is no better than those
shoes you wear.

714
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:46,064
You must be living a happier
oyster in the collar of a fisherman.

715
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:48,150
June, ¿crees that John is dead?

716
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:51,278
If you are dead, as would be the third time.

717
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:55,574
The rockers never die like that.

718
00:51:56,658 --> 00:52:00,537
I am going to give problems.

719
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:19,848
Fifteen years before

720
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:27,773
Listen child, listen to me.

721
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,901
Let me married to your mother, do not
mean that I am your father true.

722
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:36,114
You're an outcast, an evil fairy in the
mirror that I inherited from your mother.

723
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:42,371
But it is not, we are alone you and me and
next week go back to school.

724
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:47,584
The most expensive school
in the country, as well.

725
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:54,383
Meanwhile, it shows a little
gratitude and not get that goddamn music.

726
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,978
Go on, John.

727
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:55,360
It hurts a lot.

728
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:59,656
Do not give your notes get well.

729
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:03,702
Do not understand.

730
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:07,873
Why not?
Because you are a pig street.

731
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:12,044
What you need is good education.
It's what you need.

732
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:14,129
But your dad does not give a shit,
Did not it?

733
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:19,343
So are you in the game, the game
your pathetic father.

734
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:24,389
Leave it, John. What is this, time
sermon?

735
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:27,684
Come on, Peter.

736
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:31,063
I am the sponsor.

737
00:54:33,065 --> 00:54:37,069
Do not be surprised if you start a
regret.

738
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:40,989
But first, I need a drink.

739
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:47,496
My dad forced me to see "Benance"
every Sunday after church.

740
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:51,667
That is what they call ruin a
a son.

741
00:54:51,834 --> 00:54:53,752
All those silly fools cowboys
with their weapons.

742
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:57,923
Everything was not bad, his songs also
I did laugh.

743
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,008
But now answer something.

744
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:03,136
Have you ever got with you?

745
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:05,222
You know, ZTE touched inappropriately?

746
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:08,350
If you slept with me, do you want
to say.

747
00:55:08,517 --> 00:55:11,478
In psychology there
a technical term for this situation.

748
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:13,564
Yes?

749
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:17,192
Tricolatus monstrous.

750
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:20,863
Your father was monstrous.

751
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:23,991
Hey, that's my drink.

752
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:26,076
Go to masturbarte.

753
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:29,580
Stop telling Peter.

754
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:33,375
¿Quieres fight?

755
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:37,921
Te I will love you and your friends.

756
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:41,717
Do not look like a pirate?

757
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:46,263
Well, goodbye, piérdanse, lárguense.

758
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:55,272
Way to go. Everything is in the eye.

759
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:58,942
Drug addicts are crap.

760
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:13,582
Hello.

761
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:16,126
I tried to stop him, but

762
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:18,212
Can not stop.

763
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:22,382
I think he wants
I just want to talk.

764
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:24,468
Sorry, Mickey.

765
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:29,681
Do not worry, June.
Why do not you go to lunch something?

766
00:56:29,848 --> 00:56:32,809
Come on, come together.

767
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:35,938
I am sorry to interrupt.

768
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:40,984
I call Lineshee?
Leeshee, Laishee Leeshee.

769
00:56:50,702 --> 00:56:54,790
appetite and exotic, like June.

770
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:58,669
Thank you.

771
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:04,091
We can help you?

772
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:09,346
Have a group called the Quit
Lickers? We had.

773
00:57:13,642 --> 00:57:18,772
And there are a singer named Johnny Quit?
Had.

774
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:24,945
I would like to see Mr. Quit.
I too would like,

775
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:27,030
there will be a bit difficult because
as newspapers,

776
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:30,159
the only songs that Mr. Quit
sing, hymns will be heavenly.

777
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:34,329
Echaría a tear a tear for
all the fools who read the newspaper

778
00:57:34,496 --> 00:57:37,457
and believe this lie.

779
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:40,586
You saw the body?

780
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:43,714
I saw broken, broken,
with the language in the jaw,

781
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:48,135
swinging as a yacht
true rocker?

782
00:57:49,094 --> 00:57:53,098
No, Did not it? And nobody saw it.

783
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:56,226
Why is not dead.

784
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:59,354
It is alive and kicking somewhere

785
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:03,525
painting and has a very important
it does not belong to him.

786
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:07,696
Excuse me, What does that have to do
with us?

787
00:58:07,863 --> 00:58:11,867
They have business licenses in
the jurisdictions that I control.

788
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:17,289
So if you want to be in the game,
do what I say.

789
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:22,294
I know what they are thinking now. I see
that there is not much you do not know.

790
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:25,714
Take it easy, kid.

791
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:37,935
You are going to instruct?

792
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:40,020
You who think we are?
Gangsters?

793
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:43,148
That's not my style.

794
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:47,653
Hágannos a favor before the
cold.

795
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:56,703
I lost everything.

796
00:58:56,870 --> 00:59:00,874
There was very compassionate not go to his
funeral, Zeh?

797
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:04,503
All were, except you.

798
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:12,094
The only person who did not want Lenny
see there was you.

799
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,472
What to say?

800
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:19,393
What the hell do you mean?

801
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:24,857
Leave him, we all know how much you wanted
to Bob.

802
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:29,862
What do you mean exactly
"Bob wanted to"?

803
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:37,035
Leave it, is stuffed with paperwork,
the case is closed.

804
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:51,300
It was assumed that

805
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:55,220
A call for you.

806
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:01,351
Someone lost the paperwork and today
want two.

807
01:00:01,518 --> 01:00:03,437
Pretty slick.
Yes, but do remember the next time

808
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:06,565
exactly what it says Lenny.

809
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:07,608
Understood?

810
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:10,652
Yes.
Good.

811
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:15,949
How do I get this number?

812
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:20,120
Can I get any number,
working with numbers, ¿recuerdas?

813
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:25,334
One point for the initiative and two if I
tell what you're thinking.

814
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:29,254
There are a party tonight.

815
01:01:30,149 --> 01:01:33,110
There is no problem
the wisky not resolved.

816
01:01:33,277 --> 01:01:36,238
I suppose you ask
by those here.

817
01:01:36,405 --> 01:01:39,366
assumed that you wanted to check
that everything was in order.

818
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:44,580
I was surprised that no
came a point in time.

819
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:47,708
But I accept that you must have
your own business.

820
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:51,879
I understand, and neither wanted to
put things ugly.

821
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:56,049
Which brings me to my
next point.

822
01:01:56,216 --> 01:02:00,220
Since my box the fate
is not hung on the wall

823
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:04,391
things we have been
so well.

824
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:08,562
I am not saying that is for you, poker
We have not even finished the business.

825
01:02:08,729 --> 01:02:12,232
But what I need there.

826
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,277
Yes.

827
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:25,245
Hey, you think that is causing
some problems.

828
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:27,331
Shut up, Archie.

829
01:02:27,498 --> 01:02:32,544
He spent something?
Nothing, just wants her damn box of luck.

830
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:37,758
Your table? It is curious that
You had to have seen his eyes.

831
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:44,681
You do not know what I'm annoyed.
It does not interest me what you want.

832
01:02:45,224 --> 01:02:51,313
That fucking bastard can expect
what they want. If I run this goddamn

833
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,484
If I vuleves to talk like that,
you cut the tongue!

834
01:02:55,651 --> 01:03:00,531
I am the boss of this city.
Understand? I!

835
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:04,868
And do not talk that when he
lifts everything becomes a finger.

836
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:10,749
Because I wanted to cut.
Understand, Archie, is not it?

837
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:16,964
Yes, I understand, yes.

838
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:20,509
Look at that.

839
01:03:20,676 --> 01:03:24,429
The daddy of Charley Quiz.

840
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:27,808
As left
control?

841
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:31,979
For anyone who knows?
I wish someone knew he was your father.

842
01:03:32,146 --> 01:03:35,107
What if he'd signed
'd known?

843
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:40,320
I know something. Better we give something
to this man.

844
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:45,534
Anything, something that can be
call shred of evidence,

845
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:51,165
If you want to find Johnny,
have to go see Cookain.

846
01:03:56,128 --> 01:04:00,215
Who are you?
My name Cookain.

847
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:05,345
Must be with the others.
No, we are alone.

848
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:09,016
Well, you better come.

849
01:04:11,768 --> 01:04:14,730
This will be difficult.

850
01:04:14,897 --> 01:04:20,152
Game, women, everything.
It will be a hot night.

851
01:04:21,153 --> 01:04:24,114
I think you'll find something
you like it.

852
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:27,409
Excuse me, guys.

853
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:34,541
Well, who is the man?

854
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:37,669
I guess you need your er.

855
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:42,466
You might want to do something
around.

856
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:55,395
What are you doing ray, stupid?

857
01:04:55,562 --> 01:04:57,481
Nothing bad, he had no plans
for tonight.

858
01:04:57,648 --> 01:04:59,566
And I did not want to stay
locked.

859
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:02,694
I thought we could celebrate.
You mind?

860
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:07,741
Sure! What happened is
between you and me.

861
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,164
Well, and it only happened because
were gonna go to jail.

862
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:19,086
If you tell someone what
step, to anyone

863
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:23,549
Good evening, gentlemen.
Good.

864
01:05:23,715 --> 01:05:28,178
They want something to drink?
Sure.

865
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:32,683
Remember.

866
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:42,901
Hello.

867
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:47,531
A drink?
Bailamos?

868
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:51,702
You're a dancer?
What if I am a dancer?

869
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:53,787
Look and will know.

870
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:59,084
My father was a dancer.
Coming into the blood.

871
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:09,344
Want to try?

872
01:06:09,595 --> 01:06:13,098
Sure, I want to dance.

873
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:26,361
Hi, I feel a little
competition.

874
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:33,785
No, it is my party.

875
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:39,625
I was told to take
care, you were dangerous.

876
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:44,880
I'm dangerous.

877
01:06:45,047 --> 01:06:48,258
Maintain the job.

878
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:53,222
Steady, I sucrase
of way.

879
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:57,392
The same time,
the same place,

880
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:00,521
the same money,

881
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:04,525
Is your friend?
Well, no.

882
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:07,820
It's a spectacle.

883
01:07:07,986 --> 01:07:10,948
How is security?
Same as before?

884
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:14,076
Except that they are not
counters mine.

885
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:16,161
Some heavy

886
01:07:16,328 --> 01:07:21,083
Apart from that, everything is
the same.

887
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:24,503
I want to go back?
Oh, yeah?

888
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:30,759
I am a criminal lawyer, and
I am also in good terms with everyone.

889
01:07:30,926 --> 01:07:36,390
And that includes the party?
You have a infirmante.

890
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:41,186
How is it called?
You have to pay for a secret.

891
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:45,357
That's not very nice,
right?

892
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:51,321
What is it?
But remember, I'm dangerous.

893
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:56,451
I want to know
's show.

894
01:08:01,165 --> 01:08:03,083
See that man sitting
on the couch?

895
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:06,211
Arvier Queen, no?

896
01:08:06,378 --> 01:08:09,339
It is very optimistic. We can
do a favor.

897
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:13,510
Damn, that want that?
It's a great lawyer.

898
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:19,308
Perhaps you know the informant.
Y might be interested.

899
01:08:31,403 --> 01:08:33,322
I go back to work?

900
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:36,575
Same as before.

901
01:08:39,745 --> 01:08:42,706
Oi you have a secret.
You seem to have more than one.

902
01:08:42,873 --> 01:08:47,920
I want to talk to you.
If you tell me who is the informant

903
01:08:48,086 --> 01:08:51,048
We can talk about what you
want.

904
01:08:51,215 --> 01:08:55,219
I think I should go to
verify.

905
01:08:55,385 --> 01:09:01,141
Wait, you wanted to hear
take all this into a big party.

906
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:05,145
I understand, Cookain.

907
01:09:09,983 --> 01:09:16,073
If you are an informant, you will have
their statements, questions.

908
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:19,201
That's a lot more
valuable.

909
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:21,286
How wise of these
other things?

910
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:23,914
What?

911
01:09:24,581 --> 01:09:27,167
I hear.

912
01:09:37,094 --> 01:09:42,057
I give and next week
dire you all about it.

913
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:49,273
What I need is
paperwork.

914
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:55,195
Look.

915
01:09:56,905 --> 01:09:58,824
Whoever that Russian?

916
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:00,909
Okay.

917
01:10:01,076 --> 01:10:02,995
What is it?
Call Archie. Tell him

918
01:10:03,162 --> 01:10:04,037
we have a problem.

919
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:06,123
How?
What would cost us if we close

920
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:07,166
tonight?

921
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:10,294
Eleven thousand three hundred
All right, fine.

922
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:14,548
Go up and see that
happening.

923
01:10:24,016 --> 01:10:26,977
What do think?
What do you think?

924
01:10:27,144 --> 01:10:30,105
We try to enter.
Get in line.

925
01:10:30,272 --> 01:10:32,191
Sign and costs money.

926
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:34,276
I know that costs money.

927
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:38,447
Lord Archie, could not close.
We have a concert.

928
01:10:38,614 --> 01:10:42,618
I know.
We have a man on stage.

929
01:10:42,784 --> 01:10:45,746
Find them. I understand, but
the club has to remain open.

930
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:47,831
you hear that?

931
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:48,874
Get in the row,
fools.

932
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:52,628
Look, but do not touch.

933
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:57,424
I gave, and you are a man
dead.

934
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:03,472
I have to leave the club
open.

935
01:11:03,639 --> 01:11:07,518
There are 400 people
here.

936
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:14,942
Leave this garbage. Look
as I am here.

937
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:18,070
finish here.
No way.

938
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:20,823
Oh, no.

939
01:11:32,835 --> 01:11:37,881
What happens now you rays?
Sort this out, you and me.

940
01:11:38,048 --> 01:11:41,802
I have to earn my
money.

941
01:12:37,483 --> 01:12:40,444
Look at this, man. Outside
there is a fucking revolution.

942
01:12:40,611 --> 01:12:46,867
Rays. If we want to keep
the license we have to look at Cookain.

943
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:57,127
We are together in the car, the
still, the wrecked, and they

944
01:12:57,294 --> 01:13:02,341
remove the money. Everything
is going to leave well.

945
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:06,512
Bob is our driver, and
I do not want to Bob here.

946
01:13:06,678 --> 01:13:12,267
What? Paul is our driver.
No driver are not complete.

947
01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:18,232
What happened between you and him?

948
01:13:20,234 --> 01:13:25,280
There's something about Bob that I think
you should know.

949
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:29,952
What? That is a bird?
How wise that?

950
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:34,665
Come on, everybody knows that it is
Suavecito. Only you ignore it.

951
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:38,836
That does not count here. Only
behaves as it should do so.

952
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:43,715
In which Ray talking about?
Let him go.

953
01:13:44,216 --> 01:13:46,134
This is crazy.

954
01:13:46,301 --> 01:13:49,263
I do not see what the problem is.
Last night should have been

955
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:52,391
last night. What consoles,
that's what friends do.

956
01:13:52,558 --> 01:13:57,062
well done. Not
talk over the matter.

957
01:13:58,814 --> 01:14:02,818
What do you mean? Do not tell him
to heads?

958
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:04,903
But you did?
Looks like you love

959
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:08,031
It is enough, right?

960
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:11,952
That ray is going on here?

961
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:14,288
I believe?
You're gay?

962
01:14:14,454 --> 01:14:18,458
No!
I'm not gay, understand?

963
01:14:24,882 --> 01:14:29,845
I just wonder if I wanted
to dance, is all.

964
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:34,850
And if you want to dance?

965
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:47,654
I think there is something that
should know about Bob.

966
01:14:47,821 --> 01:14:53,577
When your mother was wrong,
I was the whole arrangement.

967
01:14:54,077 --> 01:14:58,081
Because I did not, was not
his best friend, was Bob.

968
01:14:58,248 --> 01:15:03,295
Bob was the one who will assure
take care of that.

969
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:08,717
And Bob did the best we
could to bring her back.

970
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:13,722
Let me tell you something.

971
01:15:13,889 --> 01:15:17,893
If I bring her and that the UDIERE
price was that Bob is gay,

972
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:21,271
What would think.

973
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:27,236
Not you, but I think
it would be worthwhile.

974
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:33,534
I told them, that
have that face?

975
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:37,704
There were so funny
last week.

976
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:39,790
I need to talk to
Cookain.

977
01:15:39,957 --> 01:15:42,918
Come with me.

978
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:55,430
We need to know who is
Johnny Queen.

979
01:15:55,597 --> 01:15:58,559
It might be the first to
noticed,

980
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:02,729
Come on, you know that sae
who killed Johnny.

981
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:08,652
Come on, Cookain, who has been
here in the last 5 years.

982
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:14,199
God.

983
01:16:14,366 --> 01:16:16,285
Have the courage to go
sauna Johnny?

984
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:19,413
is an unpleasant place.

985
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:23,584
Be there and die. I
eu sound is not pretty.

986
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:27,754
It seems like that quisera
tell?

987
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:34,261
It's a terrible sound to hear a
man drowning in his own bathroom.

988
01:16:40,434 --> 01:16:43,395
Burn your body.

989
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:45,481
I've been there, I've
done that.

990
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:48,609
The eyes are here, and
the other does not.

991
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:52,779
Imagine all that in
a non-smoking cafe.

992
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:55,908
It is about protecting
others.

993
01:16:56,074 --> 01:17:00,078
What did this man is
what we call clouds.

994
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:02,164
And if you have some brain
is not carrying

995
01:17:02,331 --> 01:17:05,792
to be here for weeks.

996
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:14,593
Veran, Johnny, the addict,
now is the drug.

997
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:17,805
worth more dead than
alive.

998
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:21,433
Understand that good.

999
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:25,896
Mr Queen is not more
us.

1000
01:17:26,313 --> 01:17:30,901
He made a trip, but let me
a message.

1001
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:36,657
If the dead return, will be
the first to know.

1002
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:01,950
Victor brought me. And this?

1003
01:19:02,242 --> 01:19:04,161
Remains of a grenade.

1004
01:19:04,328 --> 01:19:06,246
I am one of those.
Mira.

1005
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:09,416
Wait a minute.

1006
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:15,631
How many of those Hermoso
got?

1007
01:19:15,797 --> 01:19:17,716
Many, there's one here

1008
01:19:17,883 --> 01:19:20,260
wire

1009
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:24,515
Mine is worse.
Show.

1010
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:31,104
From the streets of Grozny.

1011
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,741
I bring the table in two
days. I have it saved for

1012
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:46,912
you. He was in a place
sure.

1013
01:19:47,079 --> 01:19:51,041
And then Artie loses
table.

1014
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:56,296
Do not try to be funny but
I want to know if there is any

1015
01:19:56,463 --> 01:20:00,342
chance of getting the money.

1016
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:11,979
Where is Ray?
It seems that not impresinaste.

1017
01:20:15,232 --> 01:20:18,193
There is something wrong with
this immigrant. Do not trust him.

1018
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,407
There is something strange. Not as
I know, but something happens.

1019
01:20:23,574 --> 01:20:25,492
I can smell it.

1020
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:26,535
Lenny was the only one who knew.

1021
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:29,663
They were transporting
money

1022
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:30,706
The brain has no
nor the courage for that.

1023
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:34,877
It's a fighter, not very
powerful but it is.

1024
01:20:35,043 --> 01:20:38,005
Ona after can be conincidencia,
but two?

1025
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:41,133
And the picture, your picture
the fate?

1026
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,218
I think you are taking
by silly.

1027
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:46,513
Fixes a reunion.

1028
01:21:02,154 --> 01:21:05,991
Oh, God, you're a disaster.

1029
01:21:06,325 --> 01:21:09,286
There you go.

1030
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:16,668
No such right?
It's a rhetorical question, no?

1031
01:21:18,837 --> 01:21:23,842
A bottle of water, please,
and an absorbent.

1032
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:38,315
You do not want you to know that
happened?

1033
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:06,093
I know what happened.

1034
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,318
You go to eat?
I see it sorted.

1035
01:22:23,485 --> 01:22:26,738
You got here late.

1036
01:22:52,681 --> 01:22:56,268
Take a few precautions.

1037
01:22:56,852 --> 01:22:59,313
Sure.

1038
01:23:15,621 --> 01:23:18,999
It was your job, no?

1039
01:23:32,304 --> 01:23:36,183
What are these facts
guys?

1040
01:23:37,518 --> 01:23:40,479
Do not you realize.
Darme account?

1041
01:23:40,646 --> 01:23:44,650
No, I realized that
had weapons?

1042
01:23:44,817 --> 01:23:50,030
What were dangerous criminals
war with weapons?

1043
01:23:58,372 --> 01:24:00,833
Damn!

1044
01:24:29,653 --> 01:24:32,614
you know something? I will leave this
dirty clothes here under the table

1045
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:35,409
for you.

1046
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,541
Damn!

1047
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:46,170
Watch out!

1048
01:24:46,336 --> 01:24:48,964
damn it!

1049
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:11,195
Get out of here!

1050
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:14,740
this is still alive!

1051
01:25:35,344 --> 01:25:37,971
Come on.

1052
01:26:19,138 --> 01:26:21,974
Wait, damn!

1053
01:28:14,878 --> 01:28:16,797
Goodbye, dear.

1054
01:28:16,964 --> 01:28:21,051
You are too dangerous
for me.

1055
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:27,224
Need help?
No, I'm fine.

1056
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:31,395
She is the great
leagues, right?

1057
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:35,774
I hope that we will not
bother.

1058
01:28:49,288 --> 01:28:51,206
I'm not interested if
very difficult.

1059
01:28:51,373 --> 01:28:54,334
We were going to deliver,
this was the deal.

1060
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:57,462
Hey, counselor.

1061
01:28:57,629 --> 01:28:59,548
Counselor!

1062
01:28:59,715 --> 01:29:03,719
before taking off?
Show me your phone!

1063
01:29:03,886 --> 01:29:05,804
You should not be here.

1064
01:29:05,971 --> 01:29:09,975
I am where I want to
because this is my city, not yours.

1065
01:29:10,142 --> 01:29:15,189
Despite what you and your
buddy immigrant might think.

1066
01:29:15,355 --> 01:29:17,274
And what happens?

1067
01:29:17,441 --> 01:29:20,194
Come here.

1068
01:29:21,612 --> 01:29:24,573
I can not do it. You're
too many mistakes.

1069
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:27,701
You're almost not going
this city.

1070
01:29:27,868 --> 01:29:28,744
I was told that I do not
give permission to build.

1071
01:29:28,911 --> 01:29:32,915
Do not leave me with that.
Miro by my window and I see 20 mil

1072
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:36,043
buildings that could not be
to build.

1073
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:39,171
No. I gave you a deadline for the
construction of these buildings?

1074
01:29:39,338 --> 01:29:44,593
No, darling. It was some time ago,
too long ago.

1075
01:29:45,594 --> 01:29:48,555
Whenever you have imported the
money, counselor, always.

1076
01:29:48,722 --> 01:29:54,812
So you do what you have to do.
This time I can not. Do not understand?

1077
01:29:54,978 --> 01:30:00,025
Do not treat you happen
so goddamn piece of garbage.

1078
01:30:00,192 --> 01:30:02,110
O ahogaré you on your shit.

1079
01:30:02,277 --> 01:30:06,281
I feel, right?
Do not think there's a price to

1080
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:07,324
pay for all these
gifts?

1081
01:30:07,491 --> 01:30:12,496
cars, travel,
tennis courts, swimming pools?

1082
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:14,623
I am the master of that.

1083
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:19,837
And now my mood is fragile
and can have serious consequences.

1084
01:30:20,003 --> 01:30:22,965
So you do it!

1085
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:42,276
Pedro, come back here.

1086
01:30:46,071 --> 01:30:49,032
Where are you going to think
that table?

1087
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:54,580
You know that the requested. I have
to deliver it.

1088
01:30:55,455 --> 01:31:00,544
The streets are revolts
looking for this box.

1089
01:31:01,712 --> 01:31:05,924
No. I've asked.
Do not deliver.

1090
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:08,844
You know that.
No, why?

1091
01:31:09,011 --> 01:31:11,972
Meet me in the park
in two minutes.

1092
01:31:12,139 --> 01:31:14,057
Tendre that table in a
couple of days.

1093
01:31:14,224 --> 01:31:17,186
You can trust me.

1094
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:21,356
It's a small favor and may
be sure that I will.

1095
01:31:21,523 --> 01:31:24,485
Nole like to annoy his
enemies, no?

1096
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:27,613
You can not walk well
all the time.

1097
01:31:27,779 --> 01:31:30,741
Nobody understands it, no
works well.

1098
01:31:30,908 --> 01:31:33,869
It's because I want what
I had.

1099
01:31:34,036 --> 01:31:37,873
We do not want us
bother.

1100
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:44,379
Victor, please, come
with us.

1101
01:31:51,762 --> 01:31:56,975
You see this package
Geeny Kin above the piano?

1102
01:31:58,018 --> 01:31:58,894
Yes.

1103
01:31:59,061 --> 01:32:04,149
Everything You Need to Know
of life is there.

1104
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,321
And we're going to do?

1105
01:32:09,488 --> 01:32:13,951
Every time I'm on the verge
to pay,

1106
01:32:14,701 --> 01:32:18,664
something dishonest going on.

1107
01:32:18,872 --> 01:32:20,791
will not know anything about that,
right?

1108
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:23,919
It is not just about your
personality.

1109
01:32:24,086 --> 01:32:26,004
There are also allusions
to greatness

1110
01:32:26,171 --> 01:32:30,175
The dome, refers to the
stature of the Kings

1111
01:32:30,342 --> 01:32:33,303
that is a divine signal.

1112
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:38,517
You suggested that the cigars are
your true and loyal friends.

1113
01:32:38,684 --> 01:32:40,602
And this is a lie.

1114
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:43,730
Sorry, these are trying to
say something?

1115
01:32:43,897 --> 01:32:48,026
No deal, I'm saying
something.

1116
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:55,200
Your other personality is trying
to call your attention to another point

1117
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:56,243
the discussion.

1118
01:32:56,410 --> 01:33:01,456
Writings in black and white represent
I amuerte signal.

1119
01:33:01,623 --> 01:33:05,627
Because in truth they are trying
to kill you.

1120
01:33:05,794 --> 01:33:08,755
And that's the truth.

1121
01:33:08,922 --> 01:33:13,427
I think I forgot to talk,
damn rude.

1122
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:20,225
I think you forgot where you are,
bloody immigrant!

1123
01:33:20,392 --> 01:33:23,353
Beauty is one of the
way that attracts you to death.

1124
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,482
And I'm addicted to it.

1125
01:33:26,648 --> 01:33:31,737
This and my land is my show,
I turn this city

1126
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:50,464
It starts sweet and ends
bitter.

1127
01:33:50,631 --> 01:33:53,592
And start bitter
and sweet.

1128
01:33:53,759 --> 01:33:59,848
I gotta go. I have a reunion
with the counselor, your counselor.

1129
01:34:00,015 --> 01:34:02,976
This is your ninth hole.

1130
01:34:03,143 --> 01:34:07,147
It's a long way to
get to your car.

1131
01:34:07,314 --> 01:34:13,278
get there at dawn, in time
devolvemrme to my table in luck.

1132
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:17,533
I want him back, you hear me?

1133
01:34:18,784 --> 01:34:21,495
Yes, yes.

1134
01:34:21,912 --> 01:34:27,000
I need to change.
I can not go out like that.

1135
01:34:28,168 --> 01:34:32,381
That's why you and I
let drugs.

1136
01:34:33,382 --> 01:34:38,220
And that's why no
I can repay that table.

1137
01:34:45,894 --> 01:34:51,525
Now, please ask.
You are very special, sr Johnny Quid.

1138
01:35:19,261 --> 01:35:23,765
Tell me you, Brody.
Drink something.

1139
01:35:24,475 --> 01:35:26,393
And who wrong with the paperwork?

1140
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:30,564
I'm busy tonight.
On Monday, all right.

1141
01:35:30,731 --> 01:35:33,692
Letting roles in the
reception, to your name.

1142
01:35:33,859 --> 01:35:34,735
You can pick it.

1143
01:35:34,902 --> 01:35:39,031
Well, then you vere
on Monday.

1144
01:35:45,329 --> 01:35:48,290
You got guts.

1145
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,418
That damn you'll
slap.

1146
01:35:51,585 --> 01:35:55,589
Well, let's pick up the
people and your boyfriend.

1147
01:35:55,756 --> 01:36:00,761
And let me in the Rina. I am going
to sleep.

1148
01:36:02,012 --> 01:36:04,723
Can I go?

1149
01:36:09,311 --> 01:36:14,441
To bring people to my
place I have to say yes.

1150
01:36:15,567 --> 01:36:17,486
John, are good.

1151
01:36:17,653 --> 01:36:20,989
Just what you need.

1152
01:36:23,909 --> 01:36:27,913
Do not bother, I am a
good friend.

1153
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:31,542
You know, I can help.

1154
01:36:32,251 --> 01:36:35,963
Sure, if your I
allows.

1155
01:36:38,507 --> 01:36:41,468
Come on, John, you know.

1156
01:36:41,635 --> 01:36:45,764
We are your fans. Te
continue.

1157
01:36:46,849 --> 01:36:49,810
RockanRolla '

1158
01:36:49,977 --> 01:36:54,606
Get out! Get your stuff
and larguense.

1159
01:36:58,318 --> 01:37:02,322
What is this?
Sitting? They are fools?

1160
01:37:02,489 --> 01:37:06,118
It is a demonstration of

1161
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:09,621
Where the hell have found
to these addicts?

1162
01:37:09,788 --> 01:37:13,000
Come with me now.

1163
01:37:21,258 --> 01:37:23,177
It's the last time I let you
bring fools well.

1164
01:37:23,343 --> 01:37:26,305
Next time, these alone.

1165
01:37:26,472 --> 01:37:31,518
Sorry, I just thought I
would like some company.

1166
01:37:31,685 --> 01:37:35,689
I'm dead. Sounds like you?
Which means that the dead not

1167
01:37:35,856 --> 01:37:37,774
they like the company.

1168
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:41,945
Let's get him out.
Yes, I will tell you that they leave.

1169
01:37:42,112 --> 01:37:46,116
Yes, and not to bring back
addicts sucks.

1170
01:37:46,283 --> 01:37:49,411
Get him out now.

1171
01:37:57,753 --> 01:38:01,757
Fortunately you do not follow.

1172
01:38:02,966 --> 01:38:06,553
Pete, where is the box?

1173
01:38:11,308 --> 01:38:18,065
Since we arrived. That is what will we do?
Show our treasure to friends.

1174
01:38:25,906 --> 01:38:32,538
Gentlemen, we are going to enter the
wonderful world of the paintings.

1175
01:38:33,205 --> 01:38:35,123
Come on, let it.

1176
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:38,252
One moment, sir. There is something
you should know this table.

1177
01:38:38,418 --> 01:38:41,797
Tell me soon enough.

1178
01:38:42,589 --> 01:38:45,551
It is a very unusual box and
expensive, Lord.

1179
01:38:45,717 --> 01:38:48,303
Really?

1180
01:38:48,846 --> 01:38:52,850
Come on, I do not like the theater.
Good evening, gentlemen.

1181
01:38:53,016 --> 01:38:55,894
My pleasure.

1182
01:39:01,358 --> 01:39:04,319
Tell me, I am a bit rushed.

1183
01:39:04,486 --> 01:39:07,447
I'm in the hospital.
Want your table.

1184
01:39:07,614 --> 01:39:12,327
But I have not been able to achieve this.

1185
01:39:12,828 --> 01:39:16,790
Well, then acabalo.
Who is?

1186
01:39:30,554 --> 01:39:34,892
When you leave, I want
the table.

1187
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:39,813
Well, Cookain.

1188
01:39:42,024 --> 01:39:44,985
Tell me.
I'm me.

1189
01:39:45,152 --> 01:39:47,905
Who is me?

1190
01:39:50,365 --> 01:39:53,952
Who do you want?
You.

1191
01:39:55,579 --> 01:39:58,916
Well, come on then.

1192
01:40:25,818 --> 01:40:30,864
Come on, what these ends
doing and come here for.

1193
01:40:31,031 --> 01:40:35,536
Are you of the time
we've been here.

1194
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:44,419
Who the hell is Sidney Cho?

1195
01:40:44,586 --> 01:40:47,548
Sidney Cho is an alias,
idiot.

1196
01:40:47,714 --> 01:40:50,676
Never use the real one.

1197
01:40:50,843 --> 01:40:53,804
Look, call me later, I
busy, all right?

1198
01:40:53,971 --> 01:40:56,431
Okay.

1199
01:40:58,142 --> 01:41:02,354
where I learned the word
alias?

1200
01:41:04,398 --> 01:41:07,359
Look, all dressed.

1201
01:41:07,526 --> 01:41:10,362
I gotta go.

1202
01:41:10,654 --> 01:41:16,618
I suppose you have a lot of things that
do during the week.

1203
01:41:18,996 --> 01:41:23,959
I call you later.
I have something for you.

1204
01:41:25,252 --> 01:41:30,883
assumed that you would like, so
you like the pictures.

1205
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:40,517
You like it?
You have an excellent taste.

1206
01:41:49,234 --> 01:41:50,110
What happened?

1207
01:41:50,277 --> 01:41:54,615
I broke my leg in
four locations.

1208
01:41:55,491 --> 01:41:58,452
That damn left me lame
for life.

1209
01:41:58,619 --> 01:42:03,499
And you want to do?
Well, you can not pay.

1210
01:42:05,918 --> 01:42:09,922
I'm very badly hurt.
I will do it for you, do not worry.

1211
01:42:10,088 --> 01:42:13,050
I think I can do it
better.

1212
01:42:13,217 --> 01:42:17,221
Someone is stealing the money of
the Russians.

1213
01:42:17,387 --> 01:42:21,391
Who?
You know, and you do not like it.

1214
01:42:21,558 --> 01:42:25,687
I'm not playing, Archie. Whoever

1215
01:42:27,815 --> 01:42:31,318
Mambo Bob and another.

1216
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:39,595
And we call,
Johnny?

1217
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:43,390
Sorry, no Johnny
this.

1218
01:43:43,932 --> 01:43:49,062
But it Pipa, said that
those in trouble, guys.

1219
01:43:50,189 --> 01:43:53,150
Well, this quiequiera
speaking you give this message to Johnny.

1220
01:43:53,317 --> 01:43:58,363
Tell him that his dad and his crew
gangsters to visit us.

1221
01:43:58,530 --> 01:44:01,492
We closed several clubs, and
us close more unless the

1222
01:44:01,658 --> 01:44:05,287
sr Quid return with him.

1223
01:44:07,915 --> 01:44:10,876
Why do so to speak
Pipa?

1224
01:44:11,043 --> 01:44:12,961
They are worse than I thought.

1225
01:44:13,128 --> 01:44:17,132
Come back, Johnny, go back
home.

1226
01:44:17,299 --> 01:44:23,055
Johnny can come back quietly,
but may have some problems

1227
01:44:24,598 --> 01:44:27,351
with Pipa.

1228
01:44:29,812 --> 01:44:35,192
Now if you excuse me talk
Pete with anything else.

1229
01:45:58,442 --> 01:46:01,945
Disculpennos a moment.

1230
01:46:05,741 --> 01:46:10,496
Always come back a bit
afternoon, right?

1231
01:46:15,125 --> 01:46:18,086
He wants to go down the stairs
or by the elevator, sr Coke?

1232
01:46:18,253 --> 01:46:21,465
Artie, come here.

1233
01:46:26,595 --> 01:46:30,974
You've been bebieno.
No, sir Coke.

1234
01:46:31,809 --> 01:46:36,563
Think before you drink before
I'm crazy.

1235
01:46:41,193 --> 01:46:44,154
Archie, some guys
want company.

1236
01:46:44,321 --> 01:46:47,282
Yes, it is pronoto.

1237
01:46:47,449 --> 01:46:49,910
Wait.

1238
01:46:57,876 --> 01:46:58,752
Who is it?

1239
01:46:58,919 --> 01:47:02,297
Hey, we are.
Come.

1240
01:47:05,175 --> 01:47:10,222
Looks like we have visitors,
vere hopes that they want.

1241
01:47:10,389 --> 01:47:15,394
Wait, I entered another call.
God, this job!

1242
01:47:15,602 --> 01:47:20,649
Archie, you have a kid.
Or what's left of him.

1243
01:47:20,816 --> 01:47:26,446
You might want to do the
role of pope at a later time.

1244
01:47:27,072 --> 01:47:31,535
Yuri, I do not like, nor
trust her.

1245
01:47:36,457 --> 01:47:39,209
Your what?

1246
01:47:45,841 --> 01:47:48,802
Yes, sorry. But even so
I do not like.

1247
01:47:48,969 --> 01:47:52,973
It does not interest me what you like,
I'm in charge.

1248
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:57,144
But your last girl we cost
20 million.

1249
01:47:57,311 --> 01:47:59,229
Nobody knows how much we cost
this.

1250
01:47:59,396 --> 01:48:02,483
Victor chooses.

1251
01:48:07,738 --> 01:48:10,574
Can I come?

1252
01:48:10,866 --> 01:48:16,705
Excuse me come by surprise,
but I have something for you.

1253
01:48:17,122 --> 01:48:20,083
A token of my appreciation.

1254
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:23,212
For this is?
Please do not insult you.

1255
01:48:23,378 --> 01:48:29,468
But I like more than what
you think. And not just want your services.

1256
01:48:29,635 --> 01:48:34,598
It's just a sample of
As you appreciate it.

1257
01:48:34,848 --> 01:48:39,686
I wanted to ask you something
personally.

1258
01:48:45,275 --> 01:48:48,237
you marry me?

1259
01:48:50,489 --> 01:48:54,493
Well, I think it needs to
a couple of days.

1260
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:57,621
To think about it.

1261
01:48:57,788 --> 01:49:00,874
Yes, of course.

1262
01:49:06,130 --> 01:49:09,716
What happens, I'm busy.

1263
01:49:11,343 --> 01:49:16,557
A very pretty picture.
Since when have you got?

1264
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:21,186
years ago. You like it?

1265
01:49:22,813 --> 01:49:26,900
Beauty is a lady
cold, right?

1266
01:49:31,155 --> 01:49:35,242
Victor, please, come
with us.

1267
01:49:37,411 --> 01:49:40,664
Give me my gloves.

1268
01:49:45,752 --> 01:49:48,714
Spot. As
in the old days.

1269
01:49:48,881 --> 01:49:52,885
What about today? A mayhem?
Another issue?

1270
01:49:53,051 --> 01:49:58,265
You will not greet Johnny?
Do not play, Johnny.

1271
01:50:00,350 --> 01:50:04,938
Lights a little upset.
Still working?

1272
01:50:05,564 --> 01:50:11,278
Do not you feel good to be a lawyer.
What do you, John?

1273
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:18,076
Mirense, guys. How scary.
This is what makes 4 years of absence.

1274
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:25,375
And worry so much about the money makes
a man who becomes murky.

1275
01:50:27,461 --> 01:50:32,508
I have no idea that goes through your
head, thinking that these dirt.

1276
01:50:32,674 --> 01:50:36,178
Fifteen years earlier.

1277
01:50:43,101 --> 01:50:45,938
Hi, Archie.

1278
01:50:46,230 --> 01:50:50,609
Hey, Johnny, look!
What these big!

1279
01:50:52,486 --> 01:50:56,490
Come into the courtyard, the guys
are there.

1280
01:50:56,657 --> 01:50:59,993
I can not, come on.

1281
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:07,000
Raise your hands!
Give me that, go to the car.

1282
01:51:15,425 --> 01:51:21,014
Here you have kids, for
who have never seen anything.

1283
01:51:27,938 --> 01:51:33,193
Dress as we find you,
and without many problems.

1284
01:51:40,450 --> 01:51:44,663
The handsome Bob, Mambo,
Morty,

1285
01:51:48,792 --> 01:51:51,753
I bet you already have a
squad formed.

1286
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:57,801
I can see them doing their job,
destroying people's lives.

1287
01:51:58,177 --> 01:52:01,930
Shut up and will not hurt.

1288
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:06,351
Dress, is the famous Archie stupid.

1289
01:52:06,518 --> 01:52:11,356
Shut up, or tematare myself,
damn stupid.

1290
01:52:12,774 --> 01:52:17,529
Do not remember, Archie? Since
I'm dead!

1291
01:52:17,988 --> 01:52:20,365
Sal.

1292
01:52:21,116 --> 01:52:24,369
Take him.
Daddy!

1293
01:52:25,287 --> 01:52:28,165
Good wheels!

1294
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:31,376
Excuse porlo of the
table.

1295
01:52:31,543 --> 01:52:36,006
I needed the money for
some things.

1296
01:52:36,757 --> 01:52:40,761
Had you been more generous,
nothing would have happened.

1297
01:52:40,928 --> 01:52:44,932
I wanted to get clean when the soul
back to see us.

1298
01:52:45,098 --> 01:52:48,060
What are you, boy?

1299
01:52:48,227 --> 01:52:51,855
If you are not a poison?

1300
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:58,487
Your father could not look at you.
Not for pleasure and I was jodio

1301
01:52:58,654 --> 01:53:00,572
I leave my pick
lospedazos.

1302
01:53:00,739 --> 01:53:03,700
But I was not enough
to you.

1303
01:53:03,867 --> 01:53:08,872
I had to put in your mouth
a bunch of pills.

1304
01:53:09,081 --> 01:53:15,170
And your mother all that he was staying
a hot bath and a cold knife.

1305
01:53:15,337 --> 01:53:19,967
Why? Because you are a poison,
Johnny.

1306
01:53:20,551 --> 01:53:23,387
That's why.

1307
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:28,725
What can I say? I am an addict,
I like the crack.

1308
01:53:28,892 --> 01:53:31,854
you should never have put your
money in that school.

1309
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:34,982
Archie, get him out of here.

1310
01:53:35,149 --> 01:53:39,653
I will, but let it
watch the wheels.

1311
01:53:42,447 --> 01:53:46,451
It's a reunion!
I love meetings.

1312
01:53:46,618 --> 01:53:52,458
Look at them. Mambo, the handsome
Bob, all the old faces.

1313
01:53:54,960 --> 01:54:00,466
And everything was going so well.
Except for Archie.

1314
01:54:02,259 --> 01:54:05,596
But ruined the day.

1315
01:54:06,430 --> 01:54:09,391
I was going to tell a story
on you, Daddy.

1316
01:54:09,558 --> 01:54:13,645
I was going to tell you as your

1317
01:54:15,814 --> 01:54:18,775
Quiet, quiet.

1318
01:54:19,985 --> 01:54:22,946
Give me that.

1319
01:54:23,113 --> 01:54:26,074
I was not one of your best
shot, right?

1320
01:54:26,241 --> 01:54:29,203
If you wanted to kill debian
being announced earlier.

1321
01:54:29,369 --> 01:54:33,582
As six inches above.
Come here.

1322
01:54:34,583 --> 01:54:39,546
Get rid of him, understand?
Get rid of him!

1323
01:54:45,010 --> 01:54:49,014
You do not know cuantosproblemas
've caused.

1324
01:54:49,181 --> 01:54:55,395
But you should know that kills
slowly, if not you tell me where

1325
01:54:58,565 --> 01:55:03,195
Archie, in my jacket.
Look what I got.

1326
01:55:13,163 --> 01:55:15,874
Who says?

1327
01:55:24,633 --> 01:55:29,096
Do not want to know what they
said.

1328
01:55:30,889 --> 01:55:36,145
If I think of the law,
can not be very flexible.

1329
01:55:37,146 --> 01:55:42,192
Because every time someone
viola, in front of judges.

1330
01:55:42,359 --> 01:55:44,278
A secret letter.

1331
01:55:44,444 --> 01:55:49,491
We need the collaboration and
efficiency of an informant.

1332
01:55:49,658 --> 01:55:52,619
And if that informant offered
adequate information,

1333
01:55:52,786 --> 01:55:56,999
then it will be Magic
released.

1334
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,961
The removal of jail free
charges.

1335
01:56:01,128 --> 01:56:04,089
And it comes with a very good
alibi.

1336
01:56:04,256 --> 01:56:09,303
If you help us find these people,
can help you.

1337
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:15,809
And you can turn into a bloody
guardian angel for the underworld.

1338
01:56:17,811 --> 01:56:18,687
Trust us.

1339
01:56:18,854 --> 01:56:21,815
They have evidence of many
things that were

1340
01:56:21,982 --> 01:56:27,070
in a bilingual
containing a statement secret.

1341
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:32,242
Your statement is in the
road.

1342
01:56:32,409 --> 01:56:35,370
Of course I use many
things.

1343
01:56:35,537 --> 01:56:40,584
An angel like you, Johnny.
If you do not you go to jail.

1344
01:56:40,751 --> 01:56:45,798
I've seen these charges to end
men for 20 years.

1345
01:56:45,964 --> 01:56:49,551
Who is this Sydney Cho?

1346
01:56:50,135 --> 01:56:51,011
Nothing to do with you.

1347
01:56:51,178 --> 01:56:55,182
Why not Alexander?
I like Sydney.

1348
01:56:55,349 --> 01:56:59,353
What is wrong?
Sounds like the name of an actor.

1349
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:03,524
It's free to go, sr
Sidney Cho.

1350
01:57:03,690 --> 01:57:05,609
I lay a trap,
Archie.

1351
01:57:05,776 --> 01:57:09,863
You're a damned dirty
Sydney.

1352
01:57:10,989 --> 01:57:14,243
In truth, you are.

1353
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:18,122
Quitenle that. Get him out.

1354
01:57:18,288 --> 01:57:20,207
I need your help, partner.

1355
01:57:20,374 --> 01:57:24,378
Nothing will happen if we
together.

1356
01:57:24,545 --> 01:57:27,506
because we will load the
body.

1357
01:57:27,673 --> 01:57:29,591
This is a very
heavy.

1358
01:57:29,758 --> 01:57:33,762
Within two minutes, I
could lead to the bridges.

1359
01:57:33,929 --> 01:57:39,393
Danny there thrown Trigger,
three times to be sure.

1360
01:57:45,399 --> 01:57:48,360
They should not have
killed, friends.

1361
01:57:48,527 --> 01:57:51,488
There will be witnesses.

1362
01:57:51,655 --> 01:57:55,284
After you pull the body.

1363
01:57:58,954 --> 01:58:02,958
use 6 gallons of oil
to hide.

1364
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:07,129
I can imagine letting
what follows.

1365
01:58:07,296 --> 01:58:12,801
But then the Danny
kill, porqeu knows that you know.

1366
01:58:13,552 --> 01:58:16,305
So, shoot.

1367
01:58:37,534 --> 01:58:40,496
Quick, give me the gun.

1368
01:58:40,662 --> 01:58:43,624
Hurry, hurry.

1369
01:58:43,791 --> 01:58:48,378
Quick, before they continue
thinking.

1370
01:58:59,431 --> 01:59:02,392
We need help.

1371
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:09,983
Get on your hands.

1372
01:59:19,243 --> 01:59:22,830
We must go, not Johnny?

1373
01:59:30,712 --> 01:59:32,631
We made a deal.

1374
01:59:32,798 --> 01:59:36,426
Knights, ending up with.

1375
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:44,101
Malcolm, 10 years.

1376
01:59:44,268 --> 01:59:49,606
Look at this paper, here this
the place and time.

1377
01:59:52,609 --> 01:59:56,864
Give him 15 years to Freisa Nesch.

1378
01:59:57,823 --> 02:00:01,827
Six years ago he wanted
finish with you, damn.

1379
02:00:01,994 --> 02:00:06,748
As a kid is ready, give him
three years.

1380
02:00:07,207 --> 02:00:10,794
The Jimaguas, 14 years.

1381
02:00:12,421 --> 02:00:15,382
The Jimaguas, 14 years.

1382
02:00:15,549 --> 02:00:18,510
Archie, is as loyal as
a dog.

1383
02:00:18,677 --> 02:00:20,596
this is becoming a bit
ambitious.

1384
02:00:20,762 --> 02:00:24,099
4 years for Archie.

1385
02:00:24,933 --> 02:00:25,809
Then I come.

1386
02:00:25,976 --> 02:00:29,354
Archie 4 long years.

1387
02:00:41,617 --> 02:00:45,496
There is no spring
winter.

1388
02:00:45,788 --> 02:00:48,749
There is no life without death.

1389
02:00:48,916 --> 02:00:56,048
And there is no drug that has not gone to
stop to the lungs of the young Johnny.

1390
02:00:56,215 --> 02:00:59,843
Goodbye, sir Sidney Cho.

1391
02:01:03,514 --> 02:01:08,143
It seems you were quite right,
Johnny.

1392
02:01:10,813 --> 02:01:13,774
You feel better.

1393
02:01:13,941 --> 02:01:17,444
I was until I saw you.

1394
02:01:18,111 --> 02:01:22,866
Still, I'm clean.
Only these are cursed.

1395
02:01:25,410 --> 02:01:29,748
Well, finally here.
Welcome home.

1396
02:01:31,667 --> 02:01:33,585
Give us your money, Arch.

1397
02:01:33,752 --> 02:01:36,713
You can do better.

1398
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:39,842
Johnny came out of prison.

1399
02:01:40,008 --> 02:01:44,012
What, you gonna give me coffee?

1400
02:01:44,179 --> 02:01:47,641
Goodbye, cruel world.

1401
02:01:49,393 --> 02:01:54,439
A small gift from Arch,
Johnny, for your wall.

1402
02:01:54,606 --> 02:01:57,568
Do you count this
stories.

1403
02:01:57,734 --> 02:02:00,696
That must have been expensive.

1404
02:02:00,863 --> 02:02:05,492
Actually it cost much
to the Russians.

1405
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:11,123
You are going to return to the music?
I wanted to relax a little.

1406
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:17,379
You are going to come with me?
I think you should be careful.

1407
02:02:17,546 --> 02:02:21,383
Because SERE like you, man.

1408
02:02:22,759 --> 02:02:27,097
I will make Rock and Roll of truth.

1409
02:02:36,315 --> 02:02:38,233
Johnny, Archie and the clan
wild again in

1410
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:41,904
The real Rock and Roll
