Hi!

30
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,735
If it isn't my favorite sister.

31
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:53,608
Well, I'm your older sister,
but I'll take it.

32
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:55,175
So you're down there already?

33
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:56,611
And in the Christmas spirit,
I see.

34
00:02:56,654 --> 00:03:00,049
Yeah, I just walked in.

35
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,412
- How does the place look?
- Good.

36
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,835
The same. A little dusty.

37
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,229
Look.

38
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:08,797
Can't believe I didn't get
down here once last year.

39
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,929
Oh, really? Wow.

40
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:14,019
It's been probably a couple
of years since I've been there.

41
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:16,239
Really?

42
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:18,023
Kind of bittersweet, huh?

43
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,939
I'm not sure I can taste
the sweet part of this.

44
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:23,725
Come on, Margs. Come on.
We talked about this.

45
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:25,988
It's the right thing to do.
Is it?

46
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:28,991
Yes. It's too expensive to keep.

47
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,862
Well, if Tom would just
pull his weight...

48
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:33,038
Hey, come on, now. Come on.

49
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,842
It's the season of the year
to be charitable.

50
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:36,999
Besides, we've already made
this decision, right?

51
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,827
I know, but then I got down here

52
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,006
and this place is filled
with so many memories.

53
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:46,748
Well, I'll be there in
a couple of days.

54
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,098
At least we'll be able
to say goodbye together.

55
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:53,798
- Yeah.
- And cheer up! It's Christmas.

56
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,803
Okay.

57
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:01,284
- Bye.
- Bye.

58
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:34,448
"It was then
that Caroline realized"

59
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,102
that it didn't matter
if her house was big or small

60
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,887
or not much of a house at all.

61
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,802
A home is more than
bricks and blocks

62
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,543
and windows and locks.

63
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:46,155
A home is more than a bed
or where you rest your head.

64
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:48,331
They say that home
is where the heart is,

65
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,028
and Caroline
knew that to be true.

66
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:52,335
But what she didn't realize

67
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,164
"is that your home
is within you."

68
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:01,388
Thank you all so much
for coming.

69
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:05,305
It's such a pleasure to read
in a place that I love so much,

70
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:09,657
and in a place that I call home.

71
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,268
I'm going to be sticking around
for a little bit

72
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,315
if anybody would like to get
a copy of their book signed.

73
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:25,194
Hey, Jackie. Thanks again.

74
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,544
Are you kidding me?
You're really getting good.

75
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:29,720
- Think so?
- Yeah, I know so.

76
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:32,810
Did you see those kids faces?
They loved it.

77
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,377
You know,
you pull in more customers

78
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,094
than most of the other authors
I have in here.

79
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,860
It's the local draw,
but it did feel nice.

80
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:41,384
Great message, too.

81
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:42,733
Mm. I wish I believed it.

82
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:45,388
Shh. Your fans.

83
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,912
Yeah, right.

84
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:50,175
Hey, what's going on?

85
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:53,048
You look like you saw a ghost.
N-Nothing.

86
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:54,242
I'll tell you about it later.

87
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:55,790
You better.

88
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,053
In the meantime,
your adoring public awaits.

89
00:05:58,096 --> 00:05:59,620
Mm.

90
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:01,186
Hi, guys. What's your name?

91
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,101
Do you want me
to sign this for you?

92
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:04,886
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

93
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,067
Is your family here yet?

94
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,288
No, Meredith, Jeff, and Ace
get in on Thursday.

95
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:20,423
- What about Tom?
- Mr. Reliable?

96
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,425
He's probably
in the Caribbean somewhere.

97
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,427
Good for him.

98
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:27,909
He's supposed to come, but
I'll believe it when I see it.

99
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:31,695
He'll settle down someday.
Or maybe he won't.

100
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:35,220
So what's your plan
while you're here?

101
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,744
Oh...

102
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:39,355
This is actually
our last Christmas here.

103
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,574
We have to sell the house.

104
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,793
- What?
- Yeah.

105
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:45,187
How long have
we known about this?

106
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,147
A few months now, but it didn't
seem final until I got here.

107
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:52,412
Meredith and Tom hired a realtor
who evidently has a buyer

108
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,718
that wants to close
before the end of the year,

109
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,199
sight unseen.
So what does that mean?

110
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,723
You won't
come down here anymore?

111
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:02,596
- I guess not.
- How do you feel about that?

112
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,554
Terrible.

113
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:05,879
I mean, it makes sense
with Mom and Dad gone,

114
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:09,037
but the Cape is part of me.

115
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,606
Oh, Margot, I'm so sorry.

116
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,061
Well, if this is
your last Christmas,

117
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:15,783
then you better
make it a good one.

118
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:17,456
See, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

119
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,135
I want to make this
the most special Christmas ever.

120
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:21,702
That's the spirit.

121
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:24,139
And then maybe I can convince
Tom and Meredith

122
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:26,663
that this place is so great,
they shouldn't sell.

123
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,056
How likely is that?

124
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,624
At this point, not very.

125
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:37,587
- Ahh.
- You need to take that?

126
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:40,372
- No, that's my agent.
- Then answer it.

127
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,027
No, she's just calling to see
if I have any new pages.

128
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,159
And I take it you don't.

129
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,335
No.

130
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:48,313
I've been feeling
pretty stuck the last few weeks.

131
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,382
My mind's been on other stuff.

132
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:53,081
Well, that's understandable.

133
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:57,389
Hey, I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

134
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,479
I hope you're right.

135
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,744
Christian.

136
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:46,341
Hey, can I help you something?

137
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:47,821
Yeah, this gallery.

138
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:49,605
I haven't seen it before.
Is it new?

139
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,215
Yeah, we just opened.

140
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,845
Let me know if you have
any other questions.

141
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:56,743
I was just looking at
these beautiful paintings.

142
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:59,267
They capture
the feel of the Cape so well.

143
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,660
Who's the artist?

144
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,444
It's a local artist, actually.

145
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:06,361
I think his name
is Christian something?

146
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:08,189
- Christian?
- Yeah.

147
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:11,366
Do you know him?

148
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:15,892
I... We were k...

149
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,938
- Christian?
- Yeah.

150
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:19,853
I am Christian, the artist.

151
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,464
I just... I don't
like to lead with that.

152
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:25,423
I don't want to taint
people's opinions of the work.

153
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:29,340
Christian, it's Margot.

154
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:31,299
Bradford.

155
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,431
I know. I'm so sorry,
I'm messing with you,

156
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,085
I saw you at your book reading.

157
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,392
What? You...?

158
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,916
I thought I recognized you.
Yeah.

159
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,136
Wow, how long has it been?

160
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,268
It must be 20 years.

161
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:48,446
My gosh,
you look exactly the same

162
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,927
Taller.

163
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:52,363
Yeah.

164
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,365
- And you're...
- Not a ponytailed tomboy?

165
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:57,064
Hardly.

166
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,066
Wow.

167
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:01,111
The last time I saw you
was right before

168
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,765
your family moved to Michigan.

169
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:06,900
Yeah, that's right.
Grand Rapids. You remember.

170
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,858
Of course I did. Yeah.

171
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:11,252
Wow.

172
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:14,211
So are you here now
for good or...?

173
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:15,647
Uh, for now.

174
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,214
Yeah, after Michigan,

175
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:20,087
my dad got transferred
to Sydney, Australia.

176
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,045
- You're kidding.
- No, it was great.

177
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:24,439
We spent about 10 years
Down Under

178
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:28,008
and then we went to Europe,

179
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:29,836
studied there
for a couple of years,

180
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,361
traveled around a lot, and
landed back here on the Cape.

181
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:36,364
- Wow.
- How about you?

182
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:39,106
I live in Boston.
I have since college.

183
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:41,325
Seems very boring
compared to your world travels.

184
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:44,372
And you write children's books.
That's not boring at all.

185
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,635
Well, I guess that's true.

186
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:48,332
How's the family?

187
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:51,292
Oh... they're good.

188
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:54,686
Yeah, my mom and dad died
a few years back.

189
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,387
My mom from cancer and my dad
from a broken heart.

190
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,954
Yeah, they say that happens.

191
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:02,694
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:05,262
I remember them well.
They were great people.

193
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:06,873
Thanks.

194
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,353
So are you here alone or...?

195
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:11,094
- Yeah, it's just me.
- Oh.

196
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:13,618
My sister and her family
and hopefully my brother

197
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:15,248
are coming next week
to celebrate Christmas.

198
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:16,708
Oh, like the good old days.

199
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,275
Yeah.

200
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:25,979
It is so great to see
all of your artwork.

201
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:28,677
You always were
such an incredible artist.

202
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,376
Yeah, I guess it just
kind of stayed with me.

203
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,987
It sure did.

204
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:42,256
It was such a nice surprise
running into you.

205
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:45,389
Yeah, it was
a wonderful surprise.

206
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:47,783
Come back in anytime.

207
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,960
- Bye.
- Bye.

208
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:53,006
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

209
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,011
Oh, you, uh... you've
got to really push it.

210
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:01,057
It gets stuck.

211
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:03,668

00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,405
- Fancy seeing you here.
- Oh, not really.

235
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:14,190
There's only a couple
of coffee shops in town.

236
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,236
Do you wanna join me?

237
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,455
Sure.

238
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:19,891
Um...

239
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:22,329
you sit and I'll
grab you a coffee.

240
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:24,853
Thanks.

241
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:27,029
Oh, regular coffee,

242
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,988
or are you like
a sophisticated, urban author

243
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,685
that only drinks lattes now?

244
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:33,905
Regular coffee,
black, strong, unadulterated.

245
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:37,083
Okay. I remember that
decisive quality about you.

246
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:38,693
Can I get another coffee,
please?

247
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:50,574
It is so weird seeing you.

248
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:51,836
Good weird or bad weird?

249
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,664
Good weird.

250
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,320
Yeah, I feel like
I know you so well,

251
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,496
but I missed
the whole growing-up part,

252
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,846
and I'm just wondering
if you're the same guy.

253
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,502
- I'm the same guy.
- Just with facial hair.

254
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:07,635
Yeah.

255
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:10,681
So I woke up this morning
and something occurred to me.

256
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:13,162
- What was that?
- Well...

257
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:15,469
this is actually our last
Christmas on the Cape.

258
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:17,558
- You're kidding.
- I wish I was.

259
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:21,170
We have to sell the house. Why?

260
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:23,279
Well, my siblings don't want
to keep it up anymore,

261
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:27,089
and I don't have enough money
to buy the other two out.

262
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,657
- It's far too common a scenario.
- But I was wondering

263
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,443
if maybe I could commission you
to paint a picture of our house.

264
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:34,986
I want to give it to my sister
for Christmas.

265
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,794
I think she would love it.

266
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:39,797
Sorry, you can't commission me.

267
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,582
Oh, why, are you booked?

268
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:47,979
- I don't do commissioned work.
- Oh, okay.

269
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:50,634
But I will make you a deal.

270
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:52,767
What kind of deal?

271
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:58,033
Do you remember years ago,
I drew a portrait of you?

272
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,382
Yeah, I still have it.

273
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,776
You do?

274
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:05,345
Okay, well,
I will paint your house

275
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:08,130
if you'll let me draw you again.

276
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,697
I don't think a picture of me

277
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,134
would warrant a place
on your gallery wall.

278
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:15,746
I disagree.

279
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,314
Really, you'll paint
a picture of our house?

280
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,838
Yeah. I'd be honored.

281
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:23,189
Okay, you have a deal.

282
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:26,322
Great. How long do I have?

283
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:30,196
- Until Friday, Christmas Eve.
- Oh. Oh, okay.

284
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,850
My sister and her family
get in on Thursday.

285
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,504
Is that enough time?

286
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,071
Uh, it's going to be tight.

287
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,727
I'd have to come over
every day to work on it.

288
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,164
- Okay.
- That works for you?

289
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,949
Yeah, that'd be great,
catching up.

290
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,647
And what will you be doing?

291
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,562
Oh, I will be busy

292
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:50,477
providing you
with snacks and drinks

293
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,087
and anything else
you might need.

294
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,697
Yeah, that'll be helpful.

295
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,177
And I'll be decorating the house

296
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:57,223
and getting ready for
the Christmas Eve feast.

297
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:59,050
That sounds nice.

298
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:02,184
Well, unfortunately, my motives
aren't quite so selfless.

299
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:03,664
I'm hoping to make it so special

300
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,666
that my sister
reconsiders selling.

301
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:09,322
Gotcha.

302
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:13,282
- So I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah. Bright and early.

303
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:15,850
- Thanks for the coffee.
- You're welcome.

304
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,954
Hey, Jackie.

305
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:01,317
I'm kind of in
Christmas overload.

306
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:03,174
What time are you done
with work?

307
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:15,535
Mm. I so needed this.

308
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:18,146
So, any progress
on the new book?

309
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,626
Uh... no.

310
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:21,323
I've been too distracted.

311
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:22,977
What's it going to be about?

312
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,737
I'm thinking it's going to have
a Christmas theme.

313
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,676
So you haven't
even started it yet?

314
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,461
Well, uh... no.

315
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,854
But I ran into
a Christmas angel this morning

316
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:32,508
and it sparked an idea.

317
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:34,771
A Christmas angel, huh?

318
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,860
Do you remember
Christian Williams?

319
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:38,471
Of course I do.

320
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:40,560
He just opened up
the new gallery right next door.

321
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:43,563
He's who I thought I saw the
other day at the book signing.

322
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:45,956
He's your Christmas angel?

323
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,829
He's painting our house for me,
for my sister.

324
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,502
It's going to be
the best Christmas present.

325
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:52,006
You're kidding me.

326
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,487
And he's not even charging.

327
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,140
What...

328
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:58,969
Oh, you guys had
a little something, right?

329
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:04,105
Oh, no. Come on.
We were just kids.

330
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:05,846
But he was my first kiss.

331
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:08,065
Well, now.

332
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:10,546
Any rekindled feelings there?

333
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,940
I don't know. Maybe.

334
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:14,811
He's ridiculously cute.

335
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:16,291
It probably won't even matter.

336
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,858
In all likelihood,
I won't be spending

337
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:20,774
very much time down here
in the future anyway.

338
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:22,689
I believe in angels, you know.

339
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,473
Please.

340
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,345
We're getting way
too ahead of ourselves.

341
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,956
A girl can dream, can't she?

342
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,523
Oh,

343
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:33,134
I had such a crush
on him when we were kids.

344
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:36,311
I think I cried for a week
when he left.

345
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,793
Well, just be careful.

346
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,534
Rumor is, he's got a reputation.

347
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:44,363
Reputation for what?

348
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,930
It's just what
people say about him.

349
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,497
Be careful, you hear me?

350
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,978
Oh, thanks, Mom.

351
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:05,487
- Good morning, sunshine.
- Hi.

352
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:07,620
I... I fell asleep on the couch.

353
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:09,578
Good thing you had
your Santa hat on.

354
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:14,714
- It was for inspiration.
- Ah.

355
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:16,846
Come in.
I'll put on some coffee,

356
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,022
I actually brought you some.

357
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,285
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

358
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:24,027
And I brought you
a breakfast sandwich.

359
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:26,639
Gosh, thank you so much.
The house doesn't have any food.

360
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,051
I haven't had a chance
to go to the store yet.

361
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:31,948
- Yeah, I figured.
- What time is it?

362
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:35,996
- 7:00.
- You do start early.

363
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,346
Yeah, I've always been
a bit of an early riser.

364
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,455
I like to walk on the beach
first thing in the morning.

365
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,784
Best time of day.

366
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:44,221
- Have you been already?
- Yep.

367
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:45,938
Maybe I'll take you with me
one of these mornings.

368
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:48,356
Yeah.

369
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:51,054
Oh, wow.

370
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:53,361
You have a fake Christmas tree?

371
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:54,754
Yeah.

372
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:57,626
Like, in the box. It's...

373
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,542
That's not not going to do.

374
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:02,370
Of course it will do.

375
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:05,547
I mean, not if you're trying
to impress anyone.

376
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:08,115
What are you talking about?
It's completely practical.

377
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:10,117
You set it up
and then when Christmas is over,

378
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,312
you stuff it back in the box and
you're good to go for next year.

379
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:13,729
It's what we've always done.

380
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:17,037
Okay. Suit yourself.

381
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,778
Are you getting self-righteous
right now

382
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:20,562
about a Christmas tree?

383
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:24,087
I'm just saying, it's...
you know.

384
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:25,848
I don't have time
to go get a real tree anyway.

385
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:28,527
Okay, well,
I'd better to get to work.

386
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,181
I wanted to see the house
in the morning light.

387
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:34,054
- Thank you for the coffee.
- You're welcome.

388
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,280
Mm.

389
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,403
Hmm.

390
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,101
Painter's block?

391
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:25,409
- Something like that.
- I can relate.

392
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:28,978
Blank canvas is probably
as intimidating as a blank page.

393
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,720
I actually can't get over how
big the red beech has gotten.

394
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:34,418
I remember being like
half the size.

395
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:37,857
Yeah, it's my favorite tree.

396
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,641
Secret fort in the cedar bushes?

397
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,512
Still there.

398
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:45,212
Hmm.

399
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:47,277
Listen, I know you said you
wanted a painting of the house,

400
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:48,998
but...

401
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,739
as I was sitting there,
I started thinking,

402
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:55,570
is it really the house
or is it this?

403
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,008
I hadn't considered that.

404
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,663
What is your absolute
favorite memory of this place?

405
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:42,008
My favorite memories
are down on the beach.

406
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:43,705
I thought so.

407
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:46,316
But without the house, no beach.

408
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,057
Exactly.

409
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:49,885
C'mere.

410
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:59,547
Okay. Here, sit down.

411
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,157
This is what I'm saying.

412
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:06,859
You see, it is this view
framed in by the porch.

413
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:09,209
It's special.

414
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:11,385
You're so right.

415
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:13,126
"Home is more than
bricks and blocks"

416
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:15,258
and windows and locks.

417
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:20,220
"A home is more than a bed or
where you rest your head."

418
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:23,571
Somebody very wise
once wrote that.

419
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:28,228
"Your home is within you."

420
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:29,708
I'm gonna
bring my stuff up here.

421
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:34,713
Hey, so how did you get into

422
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:38,586
writing children's books,
anyway?

423
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:40,196
I don't know.

424
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:46,899
I guess I've always loved the
way that children see the world.

425
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:50,250
Naive,
but inquisitive and honest.

426
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,034
That makes sense.

427
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:53,969
Plus, reading's always been
such an escape for me.

428
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:56,082
Anne of Green Gables, right?

429
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,779
I can't believe you
remember that.

430
00:28:57,823 --> 00:29:00,608
Yeah, I have that book
upstairs in my room.

431
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:02,479
- No way.
- Yeah.

432
00:29:02,523 --> 00:29:04,612
That's the book that
made me want to be an author.

433
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,092
Not that my children's books

434
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:07,876
hold a candle
to Lucy Maud Montgomery,

435
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,793
but least I can give back
a little bit.

436
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,142
Here, let me help you.

437
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,928
Oh, thanks.

438
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:17,886
So do you want kids
of your own one day?

439
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,280
Yeah, if the right person
comes along.

440
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:21,716
- Hmm.
- You?

441
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,979
Definitely,
as long as they're boys.

442
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:27,417
No, I'm kidding.

443
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:29,482
I've been meaning to ask,
where are you living now?

444
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,267
I actually got a little place
down by the water.

445
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,815
- Oh.
- Next to a lighthouse

446
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:34,990
that you might remember.

447
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:37,732
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

448
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,647
Is it just you, or...?

449
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,870
It is just me, but I do have
a special lady in my life.

450
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:47,437
- Oh.
- Yeah, her name's Maggie.

451
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:51,050
- What's she like?
- Well, she's got brown hair.

452
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:55,315
She's about 80 pounds
and she drools a lot.

453
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:59,406
- She sounds lovely.
- Maggie is my chocolate lab.

454
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:01,234
I was in a relationship
not too long ago,

455
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:03,714
but we wanted different things.

456
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:05,629
Is that why you moved back?

457
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:07,346
I'd rather not talk about it,
if that's okay.

458
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,504
Just... old relationships
are super boring.

459
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:13,420
Yeah, you're right.

460
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:15,161
Hey, do you remember
when we were kids

461
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:18,468
and you gave me
that little compass?

462
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:19,861
Of course.

463
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:21,230
I was just about to
move to Michigan,

464
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:23,256
and you told me that
I could use it

465
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:25,040
to find my way back home.

466
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:27,347
Exactly.

467
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,957
I guess it worked.

468
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,080
I guess it did.

469
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:54,956
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I was cutting this thing down.

470
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,480
- Christian!
- What you think? Is it too tall?

471
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:58,873
If it is, I can trim the bottom.

472
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,962
I told you I didn't need
a real tree.

473
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,616
Yeah, and I think you do,

474
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:04,072
because Christmas is not
the time for practicality.

475
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,662
It's the time for authenticity,

476
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,404
especially if you want to
impress your siblings.

477
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,319
- I don't know what to say.
- Say "thank you."

478
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:12,800
Thank you.

479
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:15,890
You're welcome. Come on,
let me help you set it up.

480
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,718
I cannot believe this.

481
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,982
It was just sitting there,
begging to be cut down.

482
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:25,117
Okay, how's that?
Is it straight?

483
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,770
Hang on. Uh, nope.

484
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,772
- No?
- This way.

485
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:29,924
Okay, right there.
Tighten that up.

486
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,037
Okay.

487
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,429
Got it.

488
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:36,955
- Oh.
- Wow.

489
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,478
Thanks.

490
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,306
Tell me again
why practical is bad?

491
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:41,785
Oh, come on.

492
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:43,526
You got to admit,

493
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,225
a real tree
is way more Christmas-y.

494
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:47,748
Can't beat that smell.

495
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:50,446
It does smell wonderful.

496
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,622
It'll make a difference,
even if it only

497
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:56,931
elevates your Christmas spirit
a degree or two.

498
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,021
It was very thoughtful of you.
I really appreciate it.

499
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:03,198
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

500
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:28,310
Hey, sis!

501
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:29,766
I'm just unloading
the car from the grocery store

502
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,289
I'm making Grandma's pot roast
for dinner.

503
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:33,141
Alright.

504
00:33:33,185 --> 00:33:34,684
I guess we sort of have to have
the pot roast, don't we?

505
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,120
Of course you have
to make the pot roast.

506
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:38,407
We always make the pot roast.

507
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,887
Alright, well,
we'll be down there

508
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,758
sometime around noon
day after tomorrow,

509
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:43,804
so hopefully we'll be there
in time for dinner.

510
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:46,247
Cool, I was thinking we could
just have Chinese that night.

511
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:49,114
Oh, that sounds great.
Anything else you need?

512
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:53,814
- Mm, some wine.
- I'm on it.

513
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:56,338
Hey, do you remember
Christian Williams?

514
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:59,776
Oh, my gosh, wow. Course.

515
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,951
You two were inseparable.

516
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:03,258
- He's here.
- What?

517
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:05,043
Yeah, it's kind of a long story.

518
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,150
I'll tell you all
about it later.

519
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:08,872
No, no, no. Margot, spill it.

520
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,223
Jeez, I bet he grew up
to be incredibly hot.

521
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:12,572
Times ten.

522
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:14,878
Margot!

523
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:16,762
Alright, I got to go.
I'll talk to you later.

524
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:18,665
- Margot...
- Bye!

525
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:22,016
Don't... did you
just hang up on me?

526
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,974
You did, didn't you?

527
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:25,585
You're unbelievable.

528
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,636
- Hey.
- Hi.

529
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,203
How long you been
standing there?

530
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:04,249
Not long. How's it going?

531
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:07,077
Oh, no, you don't get to see
until it's done.

532
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:09,732
- Come on.
- No, stop. Uh-uh.

533
00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:12,431
Okay, well,
I could use some help

534
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:15,085
decorating that gorgeous
Christmas tree you brought me.

535
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:16,609
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

536
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:18,611
You want to take
a break and give me a hand?

537
00:36:18,654 --> 00:36:20,178
Sure.

538
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,745
We've got about
an hour until sunset.

539
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:24,182
I don't wanna miss that light.

540
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,488
- Okay.
- Okay.

541
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,887
Oh, hey, it's starting
to look pretty good.

542
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,845
Yeah, we still have
a long way to go.

543
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:39,719
Yeah.

544
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:43,810
Oh. I know this girl.

545
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:45,725
No. No, no!
Give me that. Give me that.

546
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:48,815
Oh, come on.

547
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,338
You were adorable.

548
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:57,258
So are you going
to help me or what?

549
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:58,781
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

550
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:01,044
- Okay.
- Okay, what do you need?

551
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,872
- Hand me the box.
- Box.

552
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:15,668

oh, Christmas tree ♪

553
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:19,889

00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:01,801
Yeah. You got it?

560
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:03,933
Thank you.

I made us some hot chocolate.

566
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:34,224
Oh.

567
00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:36,749
Ooh, that is good. Thank you.

568
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,664
Well, thank you
for all of your help.

569
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:40,448
I could not have
done this without you.

570
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:42,363
It's my pleasure.

571
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:44,974
Sorry I didn't leave you
very much time to paint.

572
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:47,063
That's okay.
I'm making mental notes.

573
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:49,327
I'll get back to it tomorrow.

574
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,896
You know,
seeing the place like this,

575
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,986
I have no idea
how I'm going to let it go.

576
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,379
Do you have to let it go?

577
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:00,468
Yeah, I don't really
have a choice.

578
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:03,558
My siblings want to sell it,
particularly my brother,

579
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:07,257
- But you don't want to sell.
- Are you kidding? No.

580
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:10,565
Well, it sounds like you
might have some thinking to do.

581
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:13,220
Yeah, I guess you're right.

582
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:15,048
You have been
so incredibly helpful.

583
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:17,833
Can I take you
to dinner tonight?

584
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,531
Ahh...

585
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:25,275
I'm... I'm sorry, I can't,
but maybe some other time.

586
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,365
Okay, sure.

587
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,193
But I will be back tomorrow
to paint.

588
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:33,109
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

589
00:39:33,153 --> 00:39:34,850
I should work on my book anyway.

590
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:36,983
It's not going to write itself.

591
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:39,028
Yeah.

592
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,905
Here you go. Thank you.

593
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:47,254
Um.

594
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:48,777
I'll see you tomorrow.

595
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,621
Oh, and please don't look
at the painting yet,

596
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:52,302
'cause it's not ready.

597
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:54,435
Promise?

598
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:55,828
I promise.

599
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:58,787
Okay. Have a nice night.

600
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,662
Margot, sweetheart,
where have you been?

601
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:48,924
Hey, Judith.

602
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,883
Sorry, I go away
for the holidays.

603
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:53,973
Holidays, schmalidays.
Where are my pages?

604
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,454
Publishing waits for no one.
I know.

605
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:58,412
I promise I'll have
something brilliant for you

606
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,979
in the next few days.

607
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:01,371
Mm, okay, doll.

608
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:02,938
Where do you go again
every year?

609
00:41:02,982 --> 00:41:04,331
Nantucket?

610
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:08,378
- Cape Cod.
- Right.

611
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:10,337
That's... that's actually
one of the things

612
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,295
that I wanted to
talk to you about.

613
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:13,732
What do you need?

614
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:15,603
I was wondering
if it might be possible

615
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:18,258
to get an advance
on my next book.

616
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:20,826
I've decided I want to buy
my family's Cape house

617
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:23,655
and my brother and sister
don't really want to sell it,

618
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:26,266
and some extra money
could help me figure it all out.

619
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:30,226
Honey, you know I'd love
to negotiate in advance for you,

620
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,881
but...
The sales on your last book

621
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:35,188
weren't quite what
the publisher expected.

622
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:37,103
I'm really not sure
I can get approval

623
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:38,757
for something like that.

624
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,280
I can barely get advances on

625
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:41,760
our established
children's authors.

626
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,588
Right.

627
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:46,852
I guess I'll just reason
with my unreasonable siblings.

628
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,960
Do you know, we've come here
every year since I was a kid?

629
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:52,858
Hmm. Sounds darling.

630
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:54,555
How could they want
to sell this place?

631
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,991
What, dear?

632
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:57,689
Nothing.

633
00:41:57,732 --> 00:42:01,606
So what's your next book?
How far into it are you?

634
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:05,044
Oh, about halfway.

635
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:09,048
Um, it's about a...
family tree at Christmas.

636
00:42:09,091 --> 00:42:11,050
Mmm.

637
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:13,594
Why don't you write another book
because your character Caroline?

638
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:15,576
People love a series.

639
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,752
Or I could do that.

640
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:20,494
I'm sorry I can't get you
that advanced, Margot.

641
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,237
Maybe if you or a little more
well-known internationally.

642
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,282
Let's try to get you there,
okay, doll?

643
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:27,980
Okay.

644
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:30,852
Hey, merry Christmas.
You too, kiddo.

645
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,283
Good morning.

646
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:11,782
Is everything okay?
What time is it?

647
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:14,156
Oh, yeah, everything's okay.
It's early.

648
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,768
Do you want to go for that
walk on the beach with me?

649
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:18,813
Wow, you are a morning person,
aren't you?

650
00:43:18,857 --> 00:43:22,774
Yeah. Coffee?

651
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:24,950
Plus, I want to
show you something.

652
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:27,474
Go get dressed.
I'll meet you out front.

653
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:39,007
I've never seen it like this.

654
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:42,663
Something about it, right?

655
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:44,360
Magical.

656
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:51,324
We get so caught up in our busy
lives and our cellphones,

657
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:54,849
we forget to stop and take in
where we are.

658
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:57,722
I think this might be
my favorite place on Earth.

659
00:43:57,765 --> 00:44:00,681
Me too. It's why I came back.

660
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:03,597
Maggie! Come here.

661
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,599
Come here.

662
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,862
Hi. What's up?

663
00:44:10,473 --> 00:44:12,060
What are you going to do
if you have to sell the house?

664
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:14,129
I don't know,

665
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:16,262
but I think it's
going to break my heart.

666
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:24,400
Do you remember when we used to
dig up quahogs under the dock?

667
00:44:26,315 --> 00:44:28,515
Do you remember when we carved
our initials under there?

668
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,539
I'll race you.

669
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:34,541
Oh, like the good old days.

670
00:44:34,584 --> 00:44:36,021
- On three?
- Mm-hmm.

671
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:37,675
Okay.

672
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:39,285
- One.
- Uh-huh.

673
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:41,156
Two.

674
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:47,728
You're such a cheater!

675
00:44:47,772 --> 00:44:50,470
Maggie, come on!

676
00:44:53,212 --> 00:44:54,735
Do you see it?

677
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:57,042
- No.
- Ahh.

678
00:44:57,085 --> 00:45:00,306
Oh, hey, here it is.

679
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:01,916
Wow.

680
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:06,442
So many years have gone by.

681
00:45:06,486 --> 00:45:08,096
It's still there.

682
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:12,057
Yeah.

683
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:18,977
We should probably get going.

684
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,066
Why, what's the rush?

685
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,679
My family's coming,

686
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,726
and you need
to finish your painting,

687
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:32,077
and I don't want to hurt you
when I leave.

688
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,645
Yeah. Right.

689
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:42,827
Maggie, c'mon.

690
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,415
Hey, how's it going?

691
00:46:06,459 --> 00:46:08,374
Uh, pretty good.

692
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:11,725
Do you want some tea?

693
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,032
No, thank you.

694
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:16,140
Listen, I'm going to take the
painting home with me tonight

695
00:46:16,164 --> 00:46:18,819
and then work on
the finishing touches there.

696
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:21,822
Oh, okay.

697
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:23,781
Do you think you're
going to be done in time?

698
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:27,741
Yeah, absolutely.

699
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,178
But you won't be
coming by tomorrow?

700
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:34,922
Uh, no, I think you should
probably be with your family.

701
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:37,490
Let them know how you feel
about selling the house.

702
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:40,623
- Yeah, sure.
- I don't wanna be in the way.

703
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,712
Plus, it'll ruin the surprise.

704
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:47,456
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess you're right.

705
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,850
Yeah, but...

706
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:54,855
you could call me or text me
and let me know how it's going.

707
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:57,815
Okay, I'll do that.

708
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:01,427
Okay.

709
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,212
So I guess I'll see you
Christmas Eve?

710
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:07,259
Yeah, I'll see you
Christmas Eve.

711
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,480
Don't look at it.

712
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:44,296
- Hey!
- Hi!

713
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:47,212
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

714
00:47:47,255 --> 00:47:49,475
- How was the drive?
- Not too bad.

715
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:51,390
So how are you? You look great.

716
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:52,695
I'm so glad you're here.

717
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:54,088
- Hey, Margot.
- Hey, Jeff. Hey!

718
00:47:54,132 --> 00:47:55,655
Hi, Aunt Margot!

719
00:47:55,698 --> 00:47:57,439
I'm so glad you could make it!

720
00:47:57,483 --> 00:48:00,442
I'm going to go check out
the fort in the cedar bush.

721
00:48:00,486 --> 00:48:03,010
- Can you believe this wind?
- Oh, my gosh.

722
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:40,613
What is it?

723
00:48:40,656 --> 00:48:43,442
Uh... deja vu.

724
00:48:43,485 --> 00:48:46,532
Christian and I were that
exact same age when we...

725
00:48:46,575 --> 00:48:47,968
Have you seen him?

726
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:49,883
Yeah.

727
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,319
Well?

728
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:53,495
Enough already. Spill it!

729
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:56,368
- Not right now.
- Come on.

730
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:59,545
- Hey, Ace, honey!
- What?

731
00:48:59,588 --> 00:49:01,242
Come on, let's wait till
we unpack, okay?

732
00:49:01,286 --> 00:49:03,288
Aw, Mom!

733
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:05,812
Come on.

734
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:07,640
Don't worry. I got these.

735
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:15,300
Whoa.

736
00:49:15,343 --> 00:49:19,173
- Margot, you did all this?
- Yep.

737
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:22,785
It's mostly our old decorations
mixed in with a few new ones.

738
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:25,353
Yeah, and all the poinsettias
on Cape Cod.

739
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:27,225
It looks really wonderful.

740
00:49:27,268 --> 00:49:29,923
Boy, if
Mom and Dad could see this.

741
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,492
Oh, Grandma's Santas!
I always loved these.

742
00:49:33,535 --> 00:49:35,059
What's the big deal?

743
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:37,191
Well, Grandma Mary
used to collect Santas,

744
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:40,934
and then she passed them down
to our mom, your grandma, Angie.

745
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,024
Oh, we should continue
that tradition.

746
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:47,636
Whoa. Am I in the wrong place?
Is this the North Pole?

747
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,508
- Very funny.
- Lame joke, Dad.

748
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:51,814
Looks great, Margot.
Nice job, really.

749
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:53,425
Thanks.
Your rooms are all set up,

750
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:54,619
if you want to
take your luggage up.

751
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:56,819
Alright, thanks.

752
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:59,997
You've become quite
the hostess, haven't you?

753
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,042
Just trying to make
a good impression.

754
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:05,002
Oh, I've been meaning to
read your last book.

755
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:07,308
We've just been so busy
with Ace's hockey.

756
00:50:07,352 --> 00:50:08,720
Oh, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

757
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:11,486
- Is something burning?
- The cookies!

758
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:16,535
No, no, no, no, no!

759
00:50:16,578 --> 00:50:18,493
Ahh!

760
00:50:18,537 --> 00:50:21,235
- Everything okay?
- I burned the cookies!

761
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:22,628
Don't worry about it.

762
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:24,978
No, I want everything
to be perfect.

763
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,589
Everything's great.

764
00:50:27,633 --> 00:50:29,635
You okay? You seem off.

765
00:50:31,593 --> 00:50:32,768
Yeah, everything's fine.

766
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:34,640
I just...

767
00:50:34,683 --> 00:50:36,598
I'll tell you about it later.
It's okay.

768
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:38,687
You go up, get settled.

769
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:40,733
Okay, well, don't worry
about the cookies.

770
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:42,213
I like mine
a little crunchy anyway.

771
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:43,736
Me, too.

772
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:52,092
Have you heard
anything from Tom?

773
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,789
No, nothing.

774
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:57,967
He's supposed to arrive
tomorrow, but who knows?

775
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:01,754
But forget about him.
Tell me about Christian.

776
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:04,409
I haven't heard
that name in years.

777
00:51:04,452 --> 00:51:06,367
Boy, did you
have a crush on him.

778
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:09,066
- Was it that obvious?
- Obvious?

779
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,459
The whole town knew it.
Oh, get out of here.

780
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:13,113
So what's he doing now?

781
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:15,463
He's an artist. He just
opened a gallery in town.

782
00:51:15,507 --> 00:51:17,074
Wow.

783
00:51:17,117 --> 00:51:19,685
Is he single?

784
00:51:19,728 --> 00:51:21,687
Yeah.

785
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,515
So...

786
00:51:23,558 --> 00:51:25,647
what are you waiting for?

787
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:27,301
It's not that simple.

788
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:29,825
We were just kids.
You can't relive the past.

789
00:51:29,869 --> 00:51:32,176
Why not?

790
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,962
Oh, must be the Chinese food.

791
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:41,359
- Hong Kong Cafe.
- Hi, thank you.

792
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:44,666
Thanks. Have a good night.

793
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:46,059
Dinner is here!

794
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,897
This looks great, Margot.

795
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,942
- It's really good.
- Yeah, this is awesome.

796
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:02,423
I slaved.

797
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:04,512
Here, I'll pass that
down to you.

798
00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:07,689
I'd like to make a toast.

799
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:11,432
- Ooh, okay.
- Okay.

800
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:13,782
I would like to propose
a toast to Margot,

801
00:52:13,826 --> 00:52:15,523
for putting this all together

802
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:19,788
and making our last Christmas
here so special.

803
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:22,269
This is really a great tribute
to Mom and Dad.

804
00:52:22,313 --> 00:52:23,662
To Margot!

805
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:24,924
- To Margot.
- To Margot.

806
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:27,796
Cheers.

807
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,716
Margs, what is it?

808
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:40,524
I came here knowing that
this would be our last Christmas

809
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:44,422
at this house
and here on the Cape.

810
00:52:44,465 --> 00:52:47,729
But after I got here and saw
how final all this was,

811
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:51,124
I realized how much I really
don't want to sell this house.

812
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,126
Margot.

813
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:57,783
We have so many memories here.
I don't want to let that go.

814
00:52:57,826 --> 00:53:01,265
Well, Jeff,
you want to chime in?

815
00:53:01,308 --> 00:53:05,182
It's not really my place.

816
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:07,401
I thought you knew
this was for the best.

817
00:53:07,445 --> 00:53:09,098
Is it though?

818
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,538
Margs, we could
really use the money.

819
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:17,672
I mean, we have college
to think about.

820
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:21,241
Right, but it's not just
about the money for me.

821
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:24,636
This place will fall apart
if no one's here to maintain it.

822
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:27,726
Who's going to take care of it
when you go back to Boston?

823
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:30,207
I don't know. I haven't got
that far in my thinking yet.

824
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,314
Well, it sounds like you haven't

825
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:32,905
thought this through at all,

826
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:34,994
that you're just basing it
on emotion.

827
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:36,952
And what's wrong with that?

828
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:40,608
It's too expensive to keep.
The property taxes alone.

829
00:53:40,652 --> 00:53:44,264
I mean, look, the realtor
already has a buyer lined up.

830
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:47,441
All we have to do
is sign the papers.

831
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:50,792
I love this house and
I don't want to sell it.

832
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:53,012
Margot.

833
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:54,753
We already lost Mom and Dad.

834
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:57,712
How can you let
this place go too?

835
00:53:57,756 --> 00:53:59,758
Of course I miss Mom and Dad,

836
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:02,674
but I was really hoping not to
have this kind of conversation.

837
00:54:02,717 --> 00:54:07,026
Avoiding a conversation is not
the way to solve a problem.

838
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:08,941
Okay, think practically.

839
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:12,031
Both Tom and I believe that this
is the best thing for all of us.

840
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:13,380
You know what?

841
00:54:13,424 --> 00:54:15,295
Christmas isn't the time
for practicality.

842
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:17,689
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going for a walk.

Margot?

859
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:23,771
Hey.

860
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,426
Oh, honey.

861
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,036
Come on in.

862
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:41,441
Hey, you still awake?

863
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:43,443
Yeah.

864
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:44,966
What you reading?

865
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,794
Aunty Margot's book.

866
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:50,929
Cool. What do you think?

867
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:53,148
Why was she so upset
tonight at dinner?

868
00:57:01,635 --> 00:57:05,334
She loves this house
and doesn't want to sell it.

869
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:08,033
Do you want to sell it?

870
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:11,471
Well, it's not really up to me.

871
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:15,257
It's up to your mother
and her siblings.

872
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:18,086
I don't have to go
to college, Dad.

873
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,958
I want to keep the house, too.

874
00:57:24,005 --> 00:57:25,592
Did you read all the way
to the end of the book?

875
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:27,182
Yeah.

876
00:57:27,226 --> 00:57:28,749
Read me
the last couple of pages.

877
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:32,797
"A home is more than
bricks and blocks"

878
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,016
and windows and locks.

879
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,758
A home is more than a bed
or where you rest your head.

880
00:57:39,934 --> 00:57:41,588
They say that home
is where the heart is,

881
00:57:41,632 --> 00:57:43,503
and Caroline knew
that to be true.

882
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:48,595
"What she didn't realize is
that your home is within you."

883
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:51,468
And what does that mean to you?

884
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:53,078
I guess that no matter
where you go,

885
00:57:53,121 --> 00:57:54,688
you take your home with you?

886
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:57,256
That's right.

887
00:57:57,299 --> 00:58:01,390
We'll always have the memories
of this place in our hearts,

888
00:58:01,434 --> 00:58:03,088
and we'll always
have each other,

889
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:05,394
no matter where we go,

890
00:58:05,438 --> 00:58:07,396
especially at Christmas time.

891
00:58:10,095 --> 00:58:14,055
I still don't want to
sell the house, Dad.

892
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:17,537
I know.

893
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:19,147
You get some sleep.

894
00:58:26,894 --> 00:58:30,202
- Good night, champ.
- Good night, Dad.

895
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:45,739
- Hey.
- Hey.

896
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:49,613
Can we talk?

897
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:51,310
Sure.

898
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,273
Why don't you sit down?

899
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,327
- So I...
- Look...

900
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:11,809
I shouldn't have
run out on you like that.

901
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:13,724
I did a lot of thinking
while you were gone.

902
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:16,422
No, no, no.

903
00:59:16,465 --> 00:59:18,598
You were right.

904
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:21,819
I've decided to
agree to sell the house.

905
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:23,734
It's the practical thing to do.

906
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:25,649
What?

907
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:27,868
It's just a house.

908
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:30,436
It's not my family.
You are my family.

909
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:34,179
That's right, we are,
and we love you.

910
00:59:34,222 --> 00:59:36,007
We can have Christmas anywhere.

911
00:59:39,793 --> 00:59:42,013
But why the sudden change?

912
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:49,411
I think that the House

913
00:59:49,455 --> 00:59:53,241
helped me to feel connected
to Mom and Dad,

914
00:59:53,285 --> 00:59:54,765
but you can't relive the past.

915
00:59:54,808 --> 00:59:56,767
I know that now.

916
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:00,858
You can remember it fondly,

917
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:03,774
but you can't relive it.

918
01:00:03,817 --> 01:00:05,471
Well, you have us,

919
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:07,604
and we're your
connection to Mom and Dad

920
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:10,215
and all the amazing memories
that we have.

921
01:00:14,306 --> 01:00:16,177
I'm just having a hard time
letting go.

922
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:21,008
It's totally understandable.

923
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:22,836
But I'll be okay.

924
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:30,278
Well, while you were gone,
I read your book "Homesick,"

925
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:35,675
and you talk about a home
not defining you,

926
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,416
that your home is within you.

927
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:44,989
I guess it's hard to practice
what you preach sometimes.

928
01:00:45,032 --> 01:00:47,513
You have given us
such an amazing

929
01:00:47,556 --> 01:00:51,865
Christmas gift this year,
just making it all so special.

930
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:57,958
Hey, let's...
Let's not spoil it, okay?

931
01:00:58,002 --> 01:01:00,439
Okay.

932
01:01:00,482 --> 01:01:03,268
In my head, I know you're right.

933
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:06,140
It's just my heart, you know?

934
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:10,971
Yeah, I know.

935
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:13,931
I want you to have that money
for Ace and his college

936
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:15,236
and for your family.

937
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,499
It's important.

938
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:25,072
I'm going to head off to bed.
It's been a long day.

939
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:27,814
Okay, sleep tight.

940
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:31,122
Love you, sis. I love you, too.

- Oh!
- Oh, big five!

960
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:51,088
One, two, three, four... ohh!

961
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:52,872
- On Vienna? Ace?
- Yes!

962
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,787
How did you do it? Alright.

963
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,049
- So good.
- $2,000.

964
01:03:56,093 --> 01:03:57,746
You got me. I'm out.

965
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:02,751
You did it! Alright, your turn.

966
01:04:09,715 --> 01:04:11,673
- Hi.
- Hi, is Margot here?

967
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:14,024
- I'm...
- Christian Williams.

968
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:17,592
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- I remember you.

969
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:18,898
- Come on in.
- Thanks,

970
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:20,291
Margot.

971
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:24,164
Hey.

972
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:25,794
I brought you guys
some Christmas cookies

973
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:27,124
from that new bakery in town.

974
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:29,082
- Oh, thank you.
- Best on the Cape.

975
01:04:29,126 --> 01:04:31,998
So nice of you.

976
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:33,870
Thanks.

977
01:04:36,437 --> 01:04:39,005
Ace, why don't you you come
help me get lunch organized?

978
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:47,579
So it's, uh, it's all done.

979
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:51,104
I think you're really
gonna like it.

980
01:04:51,148 --> 01:04:53,846
Thank you. Really.

981
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,543
So how'd dinner go last night?

982
01:04:55,587 --> 01:04:58,503
Did you get her to agree
not to sell the house?

983
01:04:58,546 --> 01:05:03,073
I changed my mind. I decided
I'm going to let them sell it.

984
01:05:03,116 --> 01:05:07,164
- Really?
- Yeah. I was being selfish.

985
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,750
They could use the money,
and I was just

986
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:10,297
holding on to old memories.

987
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:12,386
Surprised to hear you say that.

988
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:15,476
I think reality finally set in.

989
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,478
Hey, did I...

990
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:20,960
do something to upset you,
because you seem angry with me.

991
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,441
No.

992
01:05:23,484 --> 01:05:25,443
Margot.

993
01:05:25,486 --> 01:05:27,314
Talk to me.

994
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,369
What?

995
01:05:38,412 --> 01:05:41,111
- I saw you.
- You saw me what?

996
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:43,940
Last night, at the restaurant,
I saw you.

997
01:05:43,983 --> 01:05:45,419
That.

998
01:05:45,463 --> 01:05:47,639
And I mean,
I have no right to be mad.

999
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:49,617
It's your life, you've traveled
all over the world,

1000
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:51,686
and it would be naive to think
that you and I

1001
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:53,384
could even possibly...

1002
01:05:53,427 --> 01:05:55,864
I mean, what we had was
when we were kids.

1003
01:05:55,908 --> 01:05:57,214
- It's so long ago.
- Margot.

1004
01:05:57,257 --> 01:05:58,955
And it's none of my business.

1005
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:01,392
It's just that
I was caught by surprise

1006
01:06:01,435 --> 01:06:02,959
- and I was hurt.
- Margot!

1007
01:06:03,002 --> 01:06:05,396
- But I'm fine.
- Margot, that was my sister.

1008
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:10,444
- What?
- Yeah, that was my sister.

1009
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:13,186
She's in town for a few days
before Christmas.

1010
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:16,233
She leaves for New York
to see her fiance today.

1011
01:06:16,276 --> 01:06:18,757
Oh.

1012
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,586
I feel like an idiot.

1013
01:06:21,629 --> 01:06:26,417
Listen, there is no
other woman in my life,

1014
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:30,116
and ever since I saw you
a few days ago at the bookstore,

1015
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,033
I haven't been able to think
about anybody but you.

1016
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:36,253
- Really?
- Really.

1017
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:39,734
But it is kind of cute.

1018
01:06:39,778 --> 01:06:42,128
- What?
- You were jealous.

1019
01:06:42,172 --> 01:06:43,956
Yeah.

1020
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,479
That means you care.

1021
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:49,353
- I do.
- Yeah.

1022
01:06:51,572 --> 01:06:53,487
- Christian.
- Hmm?

1023
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:56,186
Would you like to
join us for dinner tonight?

1024
01:06:56,229 --> 01:06:58,057
We're going to
the Christmas stroll after.

1025
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:01,060
I would love to.

1026
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:02,496
Did I interrupt something?

1027
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:05,064
Kinda.

1028
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:06,587
Okay, we'll see you later then.

1029
01:07:06,631 --> 01:07:08,850
Okay, what time should I be
back for dinner?

1030
01:07:08,894 --> 01:07:12,941
- 5:00.
- Yeah, 5:00 is great.

1031
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:15,509
Okay. Thank you for the invite.

1032
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:20,012
Are you sure you want me
to come back for dinner?

1033
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,995
- Yes, absolutely.
- Okay.

1034
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,128
I just have to take care
of a few things.

1035
01:07:25,171 --> 01:07:27,695
- Okay.
- Okay.

1036
01:07:27,739 --> 01:07:30,785
And I am really sorry
for the misunderstanding.

1037
01:07:30,829 --> 01:07:32,613
I never meant to hurt you.

1038
01:07:32,657 --> 01:07:36,965
No, I'm the one who should be
apologizing to you.

1039
01:07:37,009 --> 01:07:39,055
I'm not normally like this,
I swear.

1040
01:07:39,098 --> 01:07:41,666
I just... I have
a lot going on right now.

1041
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:45,104
I know.
I hope you like the painting.

1042
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:23,142
Oh, wow.

1043
01:09:06,751 --> 01:09:08,709
Hi, you've reached Judith!

1044
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:12,191
Unlike most people, I still
listen to voice messages,

1045
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:14,062
so why don't you leave me one?

1046
01:09:15,716 --> 01:09:17,283
Hey, Judith, it's Margot.

1047
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:19,503
You mentioned that I needed

1048
01:09:19,546 --> 01:09:22,419
some more international
recognition as an author.

1049
01:09:22,462 --> 01:09:25,291
I'm not saying it's a done deal,
but I might have the opportunity

1050
01:09:25,335 --> 01:09:28,164
to have Christian Williams
illustrate my next book.

1051
01:09:28,207 --> 01:09:29,750
I was just wondering
what that would mean

1052
01:09:29,774 --> 01:09:31,428
in terms of an advance.

1053
01:09:31,471 --> 01:09:33,256
Thanks.

1054
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:35,258
Oh, and merry Christmas.

1055
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,546
I can't believe you guys
are leaving tomorrow.

1056
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:45,006
I know.

1057
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,747
Jeff's parents
are dying to see Ace.

1058
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:49,446
I bet. He's the best.

1059
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:52,449
Hey, thanks for
making this so special.

1060
01:09:52,492 --> 01:09:55,060
Let's enjoy our last night here
as a family, though, okay?

1061
01:09:55,103 --> 01:09:56,757
Deal.

1062
01:09:56,801 --> 01:09:59,891
It's been so great
hanging out with you.

1063
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,632
We shouldn't let it go
so long next time.

1064
01:10:01,675 --> 01:10:03,677
- Yeah.
- Once we sell the house,

1065
01:10:03,721 --> 01:10:05,742
I'll be able to afford to come
visit you more in Boston.

1066
01:10:05,766 --> 01:10:08,073
That'd be great.

1067
01:10:08,116 --> 01:10:12,338
So... what was going on
with you and Christian?

1068
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:15,298
Well, nothing. I just made
a total idiot of myself.

1069
01:10:15,341 --> 01:10:16,864
- How?
- Well...

1070
01:10:16,908 --> 01:10:19,171
I saw him out last night
with another woman.

1071
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,652
Turns out, it was a sister.
Oh boy.

1072
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:24,220
- And you thought...
- Yeah.

1073
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:26,134
You're such a drama queen.

1074
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:36,057
- Hi.
- Hi.

1075
01:10:36,101 --> 01:10:37,407
- Come in.
- Merry Christmas.

1076
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:39,887
- Merry Christmas.
- I brought you guys wine.

1077
01:10:39,931 --> 01:10:43,891
Oh, awesome. Wow.

1078
01:10:43,935 --> 01:10:44,999
I'm going to go
let this baby breathe.

1079
01:10:45,023 --> 01:10:47,678
Okay.

1080
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:49,549
Do you want to take
off your coat?

1081
01:10:49,593 --> 01:10:51,377
Yes, please.

1082
01:10:55,686 --> 01:10:59,559
Wow. You look amazing.

1083
01:10:59,603 --> 01:11:01,474
You don't look too bad yourself.

1084
01:11:01,518 --> 01:11:03,911
- Thanks.
- Come on.

1085
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:10,894
Christian, it's a pleasure
having you here.

1086
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:13,269
Oh, thank you.
This all looks delicious.

1087
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:14,724
Margot really stepped up
to the plate this year

1088
01:11:14,748 --> 01:11:16,446
with all the cooking
and decorating.

1089
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:18,622
Hello!

1090
01:11:18,665 --> 01:11:20,580
- Tom!
- Whoa!

1091
01:11:20,624 --> 01:11:22,669
Merry Christmas!

1092
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:24,105
Oh, my gosh!

1093
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:25,803
We didn't think you were coming!

1094
01:11:25,846 --> 01:11:27,370
I couldn't not show up

1095
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:29,328
on our last Christmas
in this house.

1096
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:31,722
Come on, Uncle Tom.
Dinner's getting cold.

1097
01:11:31,765 --> 01:11:33,985
- Whoa.
- Merry Christmas, Tom.

1098
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:36,335
Merry Christmas, everyone.

1099
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:39,469
- Hey, I know this pot roast.
- Mm-hmm.

1100
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:41,253
Let me do the honors.

1101
01:11:47,433 --> 01:11:49,957
It's so good to see you, Tom.

1102
01:11:50,001 --> 01:11:52,830
I can't believe all you've
done to this place.

1103
01:11:52,873 --> 01:11:54,503
I haven't seen the house
look this Christmas-y

1104
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:56,137
since we were kids.

1105
01:11:56,181 --> 01:11:58,096
I can't believe you came.

1106
01:11:58,139 --> 01:12:01,360
Wow.
My reputation's that bad, huh?

1107
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:03,406
I'm just glad to see you.

1108
01:12:03,449 --> 01:12:05,451
Well, I canceled the last leg
of my trip

1109
01:12:05,495 --> 01:12:06,689
and hopped on a flight standby.

1110
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:08,193
I would have called,

1111
01:12:08,236 --> 01:12:10,761
but I thought a surprise
would be more fun.

1112
01:12:10,804 --> 01:12:13,851
Yeah, it was a great surprise.

1113
01:12:13,894 --> 01:12:17,724
Christian,
what a blast from the past.

1114
01:12:17,768 --> 01:12:21,380
I think the last time I saw you,

1115
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:24,078
Margot was all gaga,
chasing you around.

1116
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:26,342
I was not gaga.

1117
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:31,259
What was that old
Paul Anka song, "Puppy Love."

1118
01:12:31,303 --> 01:12:33,392
Stop it.

1119
01:12:33,436 --> 01:12:37,962
No, it's been really
nice getting reacquainted.

1120
01:12:38,005 --> 01:12:40,399
Oh, so I brought the papers
from the realtor

1121
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:42,314
for everyone to sign
for the house.

1122
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,839
- We can deal with that later.
- Excuse me for a moment.

1123
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:50,017
Uh, what'd I say?

1124
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:53,456
She's just taking it harder
than the rest of us.

1125
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:56,894
- Hmm.
- Is she okay?

1126
01:12:56,937 --> 01:12:58,591
I don't know.

1127
01:12:59,984 --> 01:13:02,465
So, Christian,

1128
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:04,075
how long have you
been back on the Cape?

1129
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:05,946
A couple of months.

1130
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:08,427
Is it the same as you remember?

1131
01:13:08,471 --> 01:13:13,954
With age comes perspective,
so I have to say it's better.

1132
01:13:18,785 --> 01:13:21,135
I just wanted to say
that this has been

1133
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:22,485
one of the best Christmases

1134
01:13:22,528 --> 01:13:26,880
that I've had
in a really long time.

1135
01:13:26,924 --> 01:13:28,621
Ever since Mom and Dad died,

1136
01:13:28,665 --> 01:13:32,756
I got so focused on my career
and then this house

1137
01:13:32,799 --> 01:13:36,412
that I didn't take any time
to focus on all of you,

1138
01:13:36,455 --> 01:13:39,023
my family.

1139
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:40,851
I came back here
and I ran into Christian

1140
01:13:40,894 --> 01:13:43,027
and found out
that he was an artist.

1141
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:46,160
Well, actually, you've been
an artist your whole life,

1142
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:48,511
ever since we were kids.

1143
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:53,341
But it turns out that
you're quite the famous artist.

1144
01:13:53,385 --> 01:13:54,778
But of course, you being you,

1145
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:57,737
you didn't say anything
about that.

1146
01:13:57,781 --> 01:13:59,609
Anyway,

1147
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:03,351
I had Christian paint you
a Christmas present, Meredith.

1148
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:08,922
Wow.

1149
01:14:08,966 --> 01:14:12,230
Wow!

1150
01:14:12,273 --> 01:14:15,494
- It's beautiful, Christian.
- That's... that's incredible.

1151
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:18,715
I want you to know I'm okay
with selling the house.

1152
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:20,780
I wasn't initially, but I'll
sign whatever paperwork

1153
01:14:20,804 --> 01:14:23,415
you need me to sign
before you go.

1154
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,566
I just wanted you
to have something

1155
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:26,462
to remember the place by.

1156
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:28,333
It's so lovely.

1157
01:14:30,422 --> 01:14:32,990
Really. Thank you, Margot.

1158
01:14:33,033 --> 01:14:35,775
But I really feel like you
should keep the painting.

1159
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:40,171
Absolutely not. It's yours.

1160
01:14:40,214 --> 01:14:41,955
Margs,

1161
01:14:41,999 --> 01:14:44,088
I had no idea
he didn't want to sell,

1162
01:14:44,131 --> 01:14:47,657
but I'm glad
you're okay with it.

1163
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,137
Me, too.

1164
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:55,316
Okay, so I know
I haven't been around much,

1165
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,582
but I'm going to make it
my Christmas promise

1166
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:02,367
to try and make you guys
more of a priority.

1167
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:04,412
You better.

1168
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:07,957
Who's ready for
the Christmas stroll?

1169
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:10,375
- Yeah!
- Yes, let's roll.

♪ Hail the heavenly

1181
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:07,345
You know, you really
are quite the artist.

1182
01:16:07,388 --> 01:16:09,652
And you are quite the writer.

1183
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:11,523
No, I mean it.

1184
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,265
Even before I knew it was you,
I was drawn to your work.

1185
01:16:14,308 --> 01:16:16,441
And then Jacklyn said
that you had a reputation

1186
01:16:16,484 --> 01:16:20,053
and I was worried you were
a ladies man, a Casanova.

1187
01:16:20,097 --> 01:16:21,489
Hardly.

1188
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:23,753
But that does explain a lot.

1189
01:16:23,796 --> 01:16:25,208
Well, then I looked you up
and it turns out

1190
01:16:25,232 --> 01:16:27,017
that you do have a reputation...

1191
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:29,236
A worldwide reputation.

1192
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,369
- You didn't know that?
- Mnh-mnh.

1193
01:16:31,412 --> 01:16:34,372
Not before last night.
You're kidding.

1194
01:16:34,415 --> 01:16:36,635
I thought that's why you
wanted me to paint your house.

1195
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:38,724
No, I wanted you
to paint the house

1196
01:16:38,768 --> 01:16:42,946
because I like your work
and I kind of like you.

1197
01:16:45,862 --> 01:16:50,736
- Where are we going?
- Come with me.

1198
01:16:52,085 --> 01:16:53,957
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1199
01:17:01,486 --> 01:17:02,855
The carolers were
really good this year.

1200
01:17:02,879 --> 01:17:04,707
They were.

1201
01:17:06,839 --> 01:17:08,798
What are we doing?

1202
01:17:08,841 --> 01:17:11,975
Oh, well, it is time to make
good on your end of the bargain.

1203
01:17:12,018 --> 01:17:14,238
- What?
- Oh, I want to draw you again.

1204
01:17:14,281 --> 01:17:17,371
I don't know what to do.
I feel so awkward.

1205
01:17:17,415 --> 01:17:20,810
No, you're just going
to sit right over here.

1206
01:17:20,853 --> 01:17:23,160
Yep. Perfect. Down there.

1207
01:17:23,203 --> 01:17:26,642
And then talk to me.

1208
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:29,645
- I look a mess.
- No, you look beautiful.

1209
01:17:36,129 --> 01:17:38,392
This is so uncomfortable.

1210
01:17:38,436 --> 01:17:40,786
No, this is perfect.

1211
01:17:42,614 --> 01:17:44,616
Tell me a story.

1212
01:18:39,018 --> 01:18:41,368
Tilt your chin
just a little bit up.

1213
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,025
Can I look yet?

1214
01:18:46,069 --> 01:18:47,592
It's almost done.

1215
01:18:47,635 --> 01:18:49,768
Ugh, the anticipation
is killing me.

1216
01:18:49,812 --> 01:18:51,944
Patience.

1217
01:18:55,992 --> 01:18:58,124
- Oh, one sec.
- Yeah, go ahead.

1218
01:18:58,168 --> 01:18:59,691
Hi, Judith.

1219
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,955
- Margot, it's Judith.
- I know.

1220
01:19:02,999 --> 01:19:04,870
Who else is working
at 9:00 on Christmas Eve?

1221
01:19:04,914 --> 01:19:07,525
- It's my agent.
- Oh, okay.

1222
01:19:07,568 --> 01:19:10,484
I got your message
and I ran your idea about

1223
01:19:10,528 --> 01:19:12,660
Christian Williams
illustrating your new book

1224
01:19:12,704 --> 01:19:14,184
up the flagpole.

1225
01:19:14,227 --> 01:19:16,969
- And?
- The publishers love it.

1226
01:19:17,013 --> 01:19:19,624
Christian's global fan base
could mean big business for us.

1227
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:21,495
It's a whole different audience.

1228
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:24,107
Wow, that's fantastic.

1229
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:30,026
And they're willing to offer
you a six-figure advance.

1230
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:32,942
What? That's incredible.

1231
01:19:32,985 --> 01:19:36,641
I figured that was news worth
sharing on Christmas Eve.

1232
01:19:36,684 --> 01:19:39,600
Is it ever?
W... Thank you, Judith.

1233
01:19:39,644 --> 01:19:41,994
We'll sort out the details
after the holidays.

1234
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:44,344
Yes, of course, yeah.

1235
01:19:44,388 --> 01:19:47,652
That is one heck
of a Christmas gift.

1236
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:52,048
- Merry Christmas, doll.
- Merry Christmas.

1237
01:19:52,091 --> 01:19:53,832
What?

1238
01:19:53,876 --> 01:19:56,835
Come on, now the anticipation
is killing me.

1239
01:19:56,879 --> 01:19:58,682
I think I have a way of
buying out my siblings

1240
01:19:58,706 --> 01:20:00,012
and keeping the house.

1241
01:20:00,056 --> 01:20:02,232
How?

1242
01:20:02,275 --> 01:20:06,149
Oh, my gosh.
This is unbelievable.

1243
01:20:06,192 --> 01:20:08,020
Um...

1244
01:20:08,064 --> 01:20:09,630
Christian, that was my agent.

1245
01:20:09,674 --> 01:20:11,632
Yeah, I know. You said that.
What did she say?

1246
01:20:11,676 --> 01:20:14,113
I sort of bounced
the idea off of her

1247
01:20:14,157 --> 01:20:19,684
about the possibility of you
illustrating my next book.

1248
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:22,992
I see.

1249
01:20:23,035 --> 01:20:24,796
And she just told me that
the publishing company

1250
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,343
loves that idea

1251
01:20:26,386 --> 01:20:29,389
and they'd be willing
to give me... us...

1252
01:20:29,433 --> 01:20:31,739
They'd be willing to give us
a big advance.

1253
01:20:36,353 --> 01:20:38,398
If you're interested, of course.

1254
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,011
I don't know, uh...

1255
01:20:42,054 --> 01:20:45,362
I've never illustrated
a children's book before.

1256
01:20:45,405 --> 01:20:48,756
I know, but you're going to be
amazing. I know it.

1257
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,672
It's...

1258
01:20:51,716 --> 01:20:54,458
That's beautiful.

1259
01:20:54,501 --> 01:20:58,331
Yeah, do you think
I have the chops?

1260
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:00,812
You definitely have the chops.

1261
01:21:03,032 --> 01:21:04,860
And...

1262
01:21:07,297 --> 01:21:10,648
I'd be honored to illustrate
your children's book with you.

1263
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:16,088
- Really?
- Really.

1264
01:21:16,132 --> 01:21:18,961
- Really?
- Really.

1265
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:21,267
- Oh.
- Thank you.

1266
01:21:21,311 --> 01:21:25,054
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1267
01:21:25,097 --> 01:21:27,317
You've no idea
how much this means to me.

1268
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,754
Oh, I think I have an inkling.

1269
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,884
This has been
the most wonderful Christmas,

1270
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:15,582
but I have one more gift
for both of you.

1271
01:22:15,626 --> 01:22:17,933
No more gifts.
You've given us enough already.

1272
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:19,760
You sure have.

1273
01:22:19,804 --> 01:22:23,939
This has been the perfect
goodbye to this place.

1274
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:26,985
And now I don't have to leave
Harbour Island anymore

1275
01:22:27,029 --> 01:22:29,292
when it's freezing cold up here.

1276
01:22:29,335 --> 01:22:32,512
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1277
01:22:32,556 --> 01:22:34,906
- Hey, am I too late?
- No, no, no.

1278
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:38,040
I just gave them their presents.
Come in.

1279
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,607
Open them up! Open them up!
Margs.

1280
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:43,871
What's going on?
Open your present.

1281
01:22:49,877 --> 01:22:51,662
I want to buy the house.

1282
01:22:51,705 --> 01:22:56,145
I'll give both of you full
market value for your third.

1283
01:22:56,188 --> 01:22:58,277
Christian and I just got

1284
01:22:58,321 --> 01:23:00,453
quite a lucrative deal
for a new children's book,

1285
01:23:00,497 --> 01:23:02,542
which I'll write
and he'll illustrate.

1286
01:23:02,586 --> 01:23:04,588
It's called "The Family Tree,"

1287
01:23:04,631 --> 01:23:07,199
and it's about
a giant red beech tree

1288
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:11,203
that grows in the yard
of a very special Cape Cod home.

1289
01:23:11,247 --> 01:23:14,337
The tree, in its quiet wisdom,
is the guiding force

1290
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:18,167
for the generations of family
that live in this house.

1291
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:22,171
My Christmas wish
is that you'll allow me

1292
01:23:22,214 --> 01:23:25,870
to be the steward of this place
and keep it in the family

1293
01:23:25,913 --> 01:23:29,917
because we, this family,
are what make a house a home.

1294
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:34,661
Jeez. Wow.

1295
01:23:36,707 --> 01:23:38,796
Does this mean we're
keeping the house, Dad?

1296
01:23:38,839 --> 01:23:40,469
It means Auntie Margot's
keeping the house,

1297
01:23:40,493 --> 01:23:42,930
but I'll bet
she'll let us visit.

1298
01:23:42,974 --> 01:23:45,977
Anytime you want.

1299
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,500
So is that a yes?

1300
01:23:47,544 --> 01:23:49,372
- Yes!
- Yes!

1301
01:23:54,246 --> 01:23:55,943
You better come back
next year, Tom.

1302
01:23:55,987 --> 01:24:00,383
I wouldn't miss it.
Hey, I'm proud of you, sis.

1303
01:24:00,426 --> 01:24:02,863
You made it happen,
and nothing makes me happier

1304
01:24:02,907 --> 01:24:05,127
than keeping
this house in the family.

1305
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:07,433
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

1306
01:24:12,003 --> 01:24:15,398
See you, Tom.

1307
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:17,182
You better take good care
of this house.

1308
01:24:17,226 --> 01:24:20,707
- You hear me?
- I will. You know I will.

1309
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:22,946
Well, actually, go ahead
and trash it. It's yours now.

1310
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:24,929
No, it's still all of ours.

1311
01:24:24,972 --> 01:24:27,627
I'm just paying
the mortgage now.

1312
01:24:27,671 --> 01:24:29,325
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1313
01:24:29,368 --> 01:24:32,023
Thanks, Margot.
That was wonderful.

1314
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,764
Happy New Year, Aunt Margot.

1315
01:24:33,807 --> 01:24:35,046
I'm glad you're
keeping the house.

1316
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,550
Me, too.

1317
01:24:37,594 --> 01:24:39,770
- Nice to meet you, Christian.
- See you.

1318
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:45,036
Drive safe, guys.

1319
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,082
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

1320
01:24:51,651 --> 01:24:53,740
C'mere,
I have something for you.

1321
01:24:53,784 --> 01:24:56,178
- What, why?
- 'Cause it's Christmas.

1322
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:58,441
No, you've given me
so much already.

1323
01:24:58,484 --> 01:25:00,530
Come on.

1324
01:25:11,715 --> 01:25:16,676
- What is this?
- Just sit.

1325
01:25:23,379 --> 01:25:25,163
Merry Christmas.

1326
01:25:27,992 --> 01:25:29,559
You kept it,
after all this time?

1327
01:25:29,602 --> 01:25:31,343
Of course I did.

1328
01:25:31,387 --> 01:25:34,781
And it led me home,
just like you said it would.

1329
01:25:38,785 --> 01:25:40,787
