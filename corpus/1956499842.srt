<font color="#80ff80"><b>Encoded by HD3D</b></font>

2
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,904
Two rooms.

3
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,614
You only have two customers.

4
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,032
Slow season.

5
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,992
Well, how do you make a living?

6
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,744
Low overhead.

7
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,412
Occasional opportunity.

8
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:06,872
The "occasional opportunity"?

9
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,832
You know, where
you’re standing,

10
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,043
that’s for employees only.

11
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,836
Oh.

12
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,921
Pardon.

13
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,008
Bad neighborhood.

14
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,134
Yeah, it must be.

15
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,386
Shotgun and...

16
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,932
whatever you’ve
got underneath your shirt.

17
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:35,985
All right.

18
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,499
You guys took your time
circling around...

19
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,126
Yeah, we had to drive
about half a mile

20
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,168
send your picture,

21
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:57,131
you know,
get confirmation.

22
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,257
Internet sucks.

23
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,634
Should have come in.
Got free Wi-Fi.

24
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,149
How long you had this place?

25
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,525
About a year.

26
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,193
Friend of mine
left it to me.

27
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,237
What we hear,
you don’t have any friends.

28
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,073
Not anymore.

29
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,700
Standing still for a year,

30
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,744
you had to know that
was gonna be too long.

31
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,498
I had obligations, and...

32
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,003
you get tired.

33
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,713
That’s something you
should have thought about

34
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,049
in the first place.

35
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,342
You know the story?

36
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,344
We don’t give a shit
about the story.

37
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,679
We hear lots of stories.

38
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:49,016
See, he’s not gonna
appreciate it, but you might.

39
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:56,023
A short one, yeah, sure.

40
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,524
Buy you a beer.

41
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,359
You can cut me off
if you get bored.

42
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,488
Me and Franco...

43
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,982
Hey.

44
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,734
On the way,
inside an hour.

45
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,446
Okay.

46
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,530
Hey, you good?

47
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,742
You know anything
about rice cookers?

48
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,826
What?

49
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,162
They come in a travel size.

50
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,663
Think it’s over-priced, though.

51
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,458
What? You want me to do some
research on rice cookers?

52
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,835
Sure.

53
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,756
You know what?
Nah, I’ll do my own research.

54
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,591
You know what?
Tell me what you find out.

55
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,344
Jesus, you need to get laid.

56
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,845
Who says I don’t get laid?

57
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,602
Hey, Dad.

58
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,728
Hey.

59
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,355
What do you know
about rice cookers?

60
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,398
Not much.

61
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,858
I’m thinking about getting one.

62
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,151
Why?

63
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,363
I travel a lot.
I eat a lot of rice.

64
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,906
Is rice expensive?

65
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,408
Almost never.

66
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,492
So...

67
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,578
You’re smart.

68
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,330
You’re a smart young woman.

69
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,832
Something only
a dad would say.

70
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,792
Well, I’m sure.

71
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,586
I’m sure you U Penn
would disagree, right?

72
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,839
Grades are fine
and I got the check.

73
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,007
Thank you.

74
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,050
Didn’t seem like much.

75
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,970
Tuition’s covered and
I work at the lab a few nights.

76
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,346
Should you be working?

77
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,015
I mean, shouldn’t you
be focused on...

78
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,474
Mom worked through college.

79
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,144
She’d have wanted it to
be easier for you.

80
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,354
I’d rather it wasn’t
too easy, you know?

81
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,648
True.

82
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,777
I don’t know what
your schedule is like,

83
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,488
but I’ve got a
break coming up.

84
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:14,948
Yeah, yeah.

85
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:18,577
Um... yeah, uh-huh.

86
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:22,664
Yeah, right.

87
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,167
Look, I know...

88
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,628
What did I do, Dad?
Why can’t I see you?

89
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,256
No, you didn’t do anything.

90
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,507
Five years.

91
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,011
It’s been five years.

92
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,098
Someday I’m gonna tell
you the reason

93
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,516
and you’ll wish I hadn’t.

94
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:46,396
Jesus! What am I supposed
to do with that?

95
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,108
This isn’t normal!
The money--

96
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,027
The money’s what
I’ve got right now.

97
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,452
Look, I’ve gotta get
back to work.

98
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,164
I love you.

99
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,543
I love you too, Dad.

100
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,024
All right, I’ll buy you
the fuckin’ rice cooker.

101
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,026
Rifle on the other side
of the hot zone.

102
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,530
Two UFOs sitting in a car.

103
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,157
Well, maybe the object.

104
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,159
Without an advance security,
I don’t know.

105
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,410
Maybe police?

106
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,954
No. No, the police
have been managed.

107
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,247
It is definitely
not the police.

108
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,832
-You sure?
-No, no.

109
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,542
I’m an asshole
who hasn’t kept you alive

110
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,793
and safe for 10 years.

111
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,211
Right down this plate.

112
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,590
78AJUG.

113
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,258
78AUG.

114
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,886
78AJUG.

115
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,762
Take this fuckin’ seriously.

116
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,640
What the fuck...

117
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:46,558
What?

118
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,101
Call me back.

119
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,201
Hey!

120
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,663
Two is better than one, honey.

121
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,957
Do I make her...
Do I make you nervous?

122
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,626
No, baby, not at all.

123
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,628
No one’s nervous.

124
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,922
Just thought you might want
a little taste of home.

125
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,555
How you end up down here?

126
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,348
There’s a story there.

127
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,683
Story’s not as sad
as you’re thinking.

128
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,977
Not as different from mine
as you’re thinking.

129
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,603
Which is why I can’t
have you come up here

130
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,146
and make me fall
in love with you.

131
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:17,899
Go.

132
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,754
It’s unlocked!

133
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,471
Okay if I turn on a light?

134
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,723
No.

135
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,725
Okay.

136
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,275
Hey.

137
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,445
Walk over to that window.

138
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,541
Take off your top.

139
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,353
Anything under the skirt?

140
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,905
That’s good.

141
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:47,989
Now open the blinds.

142
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,955
It’s a blue Skoda.
See it?

143
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,087
They’re gone, baby.

144
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,971
You know them?

145
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,306
Keep looking out the window.

146
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,559
They cops?

147
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,895
-No.
-How do you know?

148
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,898
I just gave the mean
one a blow job.

149
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,234
That makes them not a cop?

150
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,568
He paid.

151
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,155
They have guns?

152
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,448
I didn’t see.

153
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,283
They’re the type that might?

154
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,743
Yeah.

155
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,457
Are you jerking off?

156
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:42,377
Maybe.

157
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,716
The roof across the street,
the one with the construction.

158
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,967
You see it?

159
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,261
Yeah.

160
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,138
Can you get up there?

161
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,848
Yeah, but it’s empty.
It’s an empty building.

162
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,808
Nah, my friend’s up there.
He’s working late.

163
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,393
Close the blinds.

164
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,645
Put your clothes back on.

165
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,148
So you really don’t wanna fuck?

166
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,067
No, not since
my daughter was 14.

167
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,694
You have a phone?

168
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,071
-Here.
-All right.

169
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,866
I want you to go up on the roof
and say hello to Mr. Sanchez.

170
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,785
Whatever he wants, it’s on me.

171
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,537
Like a joke?

172
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,706
Yeah.
Yeah, like a joke.

173
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,376
After, you can have the rest.

174
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,296
Okay.

175
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,716
Thank you.

176
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,343
Bye.

177
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,109
Blue Skoda.
It’s a rental.

178
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,028
Got a couple names, but
they won’t mean shit to you

179
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,447
because they don’t
mean shit to me.

180
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,532
-American?
-Out of Miami.

181
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,494
You got a bad feeling about
this, get the fuck out.

182
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,412
I leave without knowing what
the fuck is going on,

183
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,414
then I don’t know what
the fuck is going on.

184
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,959
-Who else is down here?
-What do you mean?

185
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,878
Other tradesmen.
Who’s active here?

186
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,713
Well, shit. You know,
let me check Facebook.

187
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,048
None of yours?

188
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,591
You know I would
have mentioned it.

189
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,426
Would you?

190
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,178
Probably not,
but I’m telling you...

191
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,101
Hello?

192
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,687
Let me say hello to my friend.

193
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,398
It’s for you.

194
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,651
No way.
No way you saw me.

195
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,153
I recognized your
puke green MSR.

196
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,533
You supposed to do me before
or after I take the shot?

197
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,076
Kind of a moot point now.

198
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,748
Come on, Sanchez.

199
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,088
Tits at the window was a
good fuckin’ move, man.

200
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,632
But I’m always
improving on you.

201
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,843
You don’t think I’d shoot you
right through her?

202
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,639
I’m the one person in the
world that knows you won’t.

203
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,683
One chance. Come over.
I’ll buy you a beer.

204
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,351
Nah. I don’t drink, Viejo.

205
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,449
Shit, Viejo.
You shoulda took the shot.

206
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,870
She’s dead anyway.

207
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,539
But you always did leave
the dirty work for me.

208
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,172
Nah... not like that, Viejo.

209
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,052
So what now?

210
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,345
Window maybe?

211
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,557
You go for the door?

212
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,850
I got all day while you
move the dresser.

213
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,489
Start running, you
double-dealing fuck.

214
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,407
From what? You?

215
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,117
You can’t make a decision
about a fuckin’ rice cooker.

216
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,702
Well, that’s why you
tipped the target

217
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,121
and sold them Sanchez
to double on me?

218
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,624
You’re the target,
you asshole.

219
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:57,882
Who?

220
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,717
I never ask. You know that.

221
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,927
It was money.

222
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,553
And you’re past
your sell-by date.

223
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,764
You don’t fuck anymore,
you don’t drink,

224
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,516
I would have walked away.

225
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,643
You should have
let me walk away.

226
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,353
You try and then a
year or two later,

227
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,232
the pangs of conscience get
worse and worse and worse.

228
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:17,151
You know it, and then you
go off and tell someone!

229
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:21,030
Yeah? Yeah? Well, you shoulda
taken a chance, Dean, now, now--

230
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,573
Now, now, now what?

231
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:23,908
If you make it outta
that room,

232
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,368
you’d better
fuckin’ ghost.

233
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,036
Because the day
you’re spotted,

234
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,872
someone goes to U Penn
to the Ridgeman Dorms.

235
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,290
And then God
knows what’s gonna--

236
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,502
Fuck you!
Fuck you, Dean!

237
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,797
Fuck you!

238
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,016
Dad...

239
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,309
Hey.

240
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:32,310
I’m sorry.

241
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,603
Oh, don’t apologize.

242
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,189
You have nothing
to apologize for.

243
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,280
You grew up so well,
I just figured being around

244
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,784
would’ve fucked things up.

245
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,911
But maybe I fucked
up anyway, yeah.

246
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,251
Maybe there’s just
no right answer, no.

247
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,337
I know you love me.

248
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,339
I know you’re doing your best.

249
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:07,386
I am. I did.
I am doing my best.

250
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,980
I just, um...

251
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,235
I just want us to be good.

252
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,239
We’re great, Dad.

253
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:30,701
Okay, then.

254
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,706
Okay, Dad, goodnight.

255
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,874
Goodnight.

256
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,742
Tell me it’s done.

257
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,452
Yes, sir.

258
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,288
You all right? I know
the two of you had history.

259
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:00,875
Oh, that was years ago,
not that it wasn’t weird.

260
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,710
Someday you’ll do the
same to me, right?

261
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,378
Not if you’re smarter
than he was.

262
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,130
Should be a red Renault.

263
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,465
Up on blocks?

264
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,091
No one steals a stripped car.

265
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,509
Payment is in the shifter box.

266
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:53,552
Problem?

267
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:54,762
No, they’re here.

268
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,264
Hey, man, you sure
about this shit?

269
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:59,433
I got GIA certificates.
Don’t worry.

270
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,060
What... what are
GIA certificates?

271
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,813
It means the diamonds
are legit.

272
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,273
It’s how the client
wanted to pay.

273
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,900
The guy in Panama is set
to convert them for you.

274
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,278
Killing this phone now.
Talk to you in a month.

275
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,638
Hands, fuckface!

276
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,060
Yeah.

277
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,701
Hey.

278
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,494
Hey, come on, man.
Stripping a stripped car?

279
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,079
Doesn’t make sense.

280
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,166
Ah, fuck!

281
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:07,752
Try me.

282
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,086
-All right.
-You fuckin’ angry?

283
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,925
And I believe
he intended to shoot you.

284
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,802
Looked that way, didn’t it?

285
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:54,840
Who gave me up?

286
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:06,018
All right, that’s good.
It’s a good sign.

287
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,104
Yeah?

288
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,522
If you were gonna dump me
on the side of the road,

289
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,524
you’d tell me, right?

290
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,441
Unless...

291
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,318
You can shut up now.

292
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:18,280
Oh, shit. I see.

293
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,991
It’s G-Man’s snitch and
he doesn’t trust you.

294
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,897
Hey, man, seriously, man.

295
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,525
How long we been
working together, man?

296
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,694
You still can’t speak
decent fuckin’ Spanish?

297
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,947
I know enough to know
when I’m being rat-fucked.

298
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,282
Hey, I don’t give
a shit which one of you

299
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,659
I make a deal with, all right?

300
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,797
Oh, motherfucker!
That was a good one!

301
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:18,841
You want me to shut
the fuck up, buddy?

302
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,551
You’re gonna have to
hit me harder than that.

303
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,386
That’s just turning me on.

304
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:38,694
Jesus, Miguel...

305
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,784
Miguel... you’re just
encouraging him!

306
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,453
It’s a long fucking
ride, you know.

307
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,579
It keeps me awake.

308
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,331
Oh, yeah?
Long ride to where?

309
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,167
Huh?

310
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,798
Where we going?

311
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,029
Look, the diamonds
are worth 250.

312
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,447
First one of you
kills the other,

313
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,366
I’ll bump it another 250.

314
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,494
That’s 375 more than
either of you is expecting.

315
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,164
You know I’m good for it.

316
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,503
I got it.

317
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:42,258
Oh, shit, look.
He’s thinking about it.

318
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,593
You better act fast. Your man,
he’s thinking about it.

319
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:49,932
’Cause he’s gonna trust a greasy
piece of shit like you, hmm?

320
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,100
Oh!

321
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,107
What the fuck are
you doing, man?

322
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,358
Hey, man, come on.

323
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,527
This making you
fuckin’ feel better? Relax.

324
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,863
Fuckin’ relax.

325
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,323
I’m relaxed.

326
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:08,367
Hey, you know what?
G-Man is trying to figure out

327
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,952
how to fuckin’ shoot you
from the back seat...

328
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,162
Just pull over, man.
Let me break his jaw.

329
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,372
It’s just words, man.

330
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,832
What the fuck you
care about words?

331
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,504
Pull over. Let me break
his fuckin’ jaw!

332
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:23,799
500! 500! 500!
Just get this shit movin’!

333
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,134
Just get--

334
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,365
What?

335
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:54,246
Now we’re riding around
with a dead fuckin’ body, man.

336
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,332
It’s not the first time.

337
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,416
Pull over. We’ll throw
him in the trunk.

338
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,417
Clean up a little.

339
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,604
Quit fucking with me.

340
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:29,031
Seriously, how much money
have we made together?

341
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,659
Not this much, man.
Not all at once.

342
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:33,077
Fuck you, man, fuck you.

343
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,412
Exactly. That’s what
I’m afraid of, man.

344
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:36,872
Exactly that.

345
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,462
So, what?
What’s the plan here?

346
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,922
You just gonna drive
around all night?

347
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,886
This car doesn’t
run outta gas?

348
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,143
You know what?
It’s okay, man.

349
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:01,188
Just empty your fuckin’ gun
and it’s fine. It’s fine.

350
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,566
Empty?

351
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,776
You fucking kidding me?

352
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,325
I’m not fucking
kidding you, motherfucker!

353
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:21,458
You know we’re
through after this.

354
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,378
Yeah, Lance, I fuckin’ know.

355
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,220
No.

356
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,722
I’ll fuckin’ shoot you, Lance.

357
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,306
-You’re gonna anyway.
-No, I’m not.

358
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,433
Then unload your gun.

359
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,809
I’m not fuckin’ doing that.
You crazy?

360
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,228
’Cause I can trust you,
but you can’t trust me?

361
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,938
Well, you shot the
fucking guy, man--

362
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,650
Because he was getting
in our heads!

363
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,068
He got us here!

364
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,449
Well, Lance...

365
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:56,744
Here we are.

366
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,831
Partner?

367
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:05,252
Yeah.

368
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:09,590
Here we are.

369
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:15,929
Okay, man.

370
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,115
Fuck!

371
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:10,901
That’s it.

372
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,171
Tell me you’re not
gonna run, partner?

373
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,595
Not while I got the diamonds!

374
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,364
Sorry, Miguel.

375
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:13,732
Agh!

376
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,085
Open the kit.
See what we got.

377
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,295
Not a lot.

378
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:37,130
Well, do what you can.

379
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,590
We gotta figure out a story.

380
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,385
What happened?

381
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:43,971
It...

382
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,393
...got a little messy.

383
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:50,727
Oh, Lance.

384
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,231
Oh, we’re okay, we’re okay.

385
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:57,609
He shot me.

386
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,531
Not through and through, is it?

387
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,074
The bullet come out
the other side?

388
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:04,992
Is there a hole?

389
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:06,076
No.

390
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,685
Right on the money, huh?

391
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,980
My man was right on the money.

392
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:39,234
And all it cost was
a little part of my soul,

393
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,944
the part I wasn’t using.

394
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,283
Miguel was bad,
bad as me...

395
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,995
but I shouldn’t
have shot him.

396
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:53,415
You killed him for me.

397
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,713
He didn’t give me a choice.

398
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:04,009
But if I’m being honest,
I knew he wouldn’t.

399
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:09,181
Even if he knew why,
I needed it all.

400
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,766
I think I would
have been better if I--

401
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,017
No.

402
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,312
Nothing is better than this.

403
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,567
Yeah? Yeah?

404
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:30,577
Listen to me, Arana’s
meeting us at Hotel del Franco

405
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,454
with a new passport
and papers.

406
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,415
Get you on the plane to Bonn.

407
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:38,460
I come by with a
new passport in a week,

408
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,170
new identities
for both of us.

409
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,091
Then...

410
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:46,259
Then?

411
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,431
It’s fucking happening.

412
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:55,477
A year, but
it’s happening.

413
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,822
There’s no way she could
have followed me here.

414
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:11,618
Puta! I’m not going to kill you!
I love you!

415
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,120
Fucking love you!

416
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,886
Arana gets the biggest diamond.
That’s his payment. Got it?

417
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,680
We are doing this together.

418
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:32,764
Please!

419
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:33,974
I’ll meet you at the hotel.

420
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,063
Hey, Ericson!

421
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:42,065
You think being a
cop protects you?

422
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,527
You think being
an American protects you?

423
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:48,613
You fucked my woman!

424
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,282
I’m gonna fucking kill you!

425
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,255
Go. Go!

426
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:31,364
Come out...

427
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,049
Street. One night.

428
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,387
I’m supposed to ask for ID
and a credit card.

429
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:12,479
Okay.

430
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:35,502
If you need anything...

431
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:36,836
You here all night?

432
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,090
I was gonna say, "Dial 00."
Yes, I am.

433
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:45,029
Bourbon and tequila
and bourbon.

434
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:47,699
And beer.

435
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,952
Tequila and beer.

436
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,290
Thought you were the clerk.

437
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,836
Clerk, bartender,

438
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,880
security guard, owner.

439
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,507
Owner? What happened to Franco?

440
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:06,384
You know Franco?

441
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,469
No. I read the sign.

442
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,888
I won this place
in a poker game.

443
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:12,515
Really?

444
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:16,686
It was a long game and it turns
out it’s not worth that much.

445
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:26,904
Is that why you do
everything yourself?

446
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:29,115
I have people during the day.
At night, though...

447
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:30,575
You like the quiet?

448
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,869
I don’t get
much sleep anyway.

449
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:33,870
Bad dreams?

450
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,038
What makes you say that?

451
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,125
Everyone has bad dreams.

452
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:46,090
That’s not your real answer.

453
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:47,675
That’s what you came up
with right after

454
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:50,094
you wished you hadn’t
asked the question.

455
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:52,221
You talk to all your hotel
guests like this?

456
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,940
You know a man named Arana?

457
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,822
Spanish for "spider", right?

458
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:12,033
I don’t know him. I’m supposed
to be meeting him here.

459
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,285
Meeting a guy named Arana?

460
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,787
Nothing good can come of that.

461
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:19,040
You mean, a woman like me
meeting a guy named Arana?

462
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,125
Well, I think you’ve met some
Aranas in your time,

463
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:23,211
probably some Snakes
and Lobos too.

464
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,796
What makes you say that?

465
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:29,008
Just... the way you drink,
how nervous you are...

466
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,137
How nervous you’re not.

467
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:40,645
Franco’s dead, isn’t he?

468
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,233
The back of your neck,
that scar’s from a knife.

469
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:48,027
The one on your hand,
that’s from a bullet.

470
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:51,072
Maybe I had one
really bad day.

471
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,783
You have the eyes and
the hands of a violent man.

472
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,787
I know, because
I know violent men.

473
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,289
So the questions are...

474
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:02,667
did Franco die by
your hand and why?

475
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:08,339
And does a violent man
really think

476
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:11,134
he’s gonna find peace
behind a hotel desk?

477
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:14,929
What are the answers?

478
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,015
Those aren’t my questions.

479
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:27,775
I’ll bill your room.

480
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:58,181
Your business is
worse than mine.

481
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:01,350
It’s all about the quality,
not the quantity.

482
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:04,270
Does it get lonely wandering
around that empty hotel?

483
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,691
I see people walk in,
take one look around

484
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:10,568
and walk right back out.

485
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,153
Maybe I’m turning them away.

486
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,154
Mm.

487
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:16,199
Me too.

488
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:19,076
Only tonight, this guy wanted
to fall in love with me.

489
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,454
There’s always that danger.

490
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:22,872
Seen Gigi?

491
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:24,290
Not for a few hours.

492
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,502
She must have
gone home, then.

493
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,672
Guess I’ll do the same.

494
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:38,513
You know, I see
you almost every night

495
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,640
and steal your cigarettes.

496
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,642
You never once asked me
to throw you one.

497
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:46,187
And you never once asked me
how I ended up down here.

498
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,065
You never asked me either.

499
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:50,525
That’s what we like
about each other.

500
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:26,579
So what’s the pitch?

501
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:30,249
The pitch?

502
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:34,170
I’m not delusional enough
to think you find me
irresistible.

503
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,254
No.

504
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,883
You’re a man who understands
the mechanics of this world,

505
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,593
but not its appetites.

506
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,888
It has got me this far.

507
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,598
Would you walk out
of here tonight?

508
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,516
Where would I be walking to?

509
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,977
Would you?
For the right reason?

510
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:51,520
What’s a right
reason look like?

511
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:54,065
When you played
cards with Franco

512
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,983
and he put the deed
down to this place,

513
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,652
what gave it value to you?

514
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,028
Money, pleasure?

515
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:00,488
So we’re not
discussing reasons.

516
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:01,739
We’re negotiating payment.

517
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,199
Would you prefer a cause?

518
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:04,992
You don’t strike me
as a cause.

519
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:10,790
More of a rabbit hole.

520
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:11,958
A rabbit hole.

521
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:13,584
I fall into you
knowing full well

522
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:15,586
there’s going to be
a hard landing.

523
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:21,258
I’m getting out of a
difficult situation,

524
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:22,718
becoming a new person,

525
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,138
a person I thought
I would have been by now.

526
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:28,474
Arana is giving you
a new identity,

527
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:31,102
way out of the city?
The country?

528
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,145
It has to be quickly, tonight.

529
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:34,897
Because you’re using
someone else’s money.

530
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,316
-I don’t see it that way.
-But someone does.

531
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:39,777
You’re right.

532
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,779
I’ve known Aranas and Snakes.

533
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,531
I know how to handle them.

534
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,491
But they don’t know
that at first.

535
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:48,244
At first, it’s easier
to have someone like me around

536
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:50,079
to deal with
the Snakes and Aranas.

537
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:53,708
But you couldn’t have planned
for that, for me being here.

538
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,127
A plan is just an action
that you sit and contemplate

539
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,004
for so long that it
becomes complicated.

540
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,923
I’d rather move from
opportunity to opportunity.

541
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:06,512
I saw your knuckles,
your scars.

542
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,598
And I recognized
an opportunity,

543
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:11,058
same as you saw in me.

544
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,189
I’m not the guy
you think I am.

545
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:18,733
You don’t want to be,
but you are.

546
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,609
If I could go,
I would, but I can’t.

547
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,529
Can’t or won’t?

548
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,906
You think I’d say no to you
if I had the choice?

549
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,033
Well, it seems like you are.

550
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:28,492
It really is can’t.

551
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:32,496
Though I don’t like my chances
with you... or her.

552
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,263
She’ll kill me.

553
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,641
And me, if she smells
your perfume.

554
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:55,269
Behind the staircase, there’s
an exit out into the alley.

555
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,812
I have to go back
to my room first.

556
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:58,397
For money you
don’t think is hers?

557
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,692
It’s worth way
more than this hotel,

558
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:03,569
way more than
what Franco died for.

559
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:31,680
That’s not gonna make
me move any faster!

560
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:38,062
All right, all right.

561
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:42,900
I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

562
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,318
Don’t shoot, don’t shoot,
please.

563
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,570
-Oso!
-Sorry. Don’t shoot.

564
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:56,622
I’m sorry.

565
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:07,258
This was Franco’s place.

566
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,637
Yeah, he sold it to me.

567
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:16,934
When was that?

568
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:21,564
Uh, about a week
before he disappeared.

569
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,608
You got proof?

570
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:26,152
You need it?

571
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,450
Do you know who I am?

572
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:37,037
Not specifically,
but you are a type.

573
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:41,125
I am a type.

574
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,376
Are you a type, too?

575
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,045
Yeah, the kind that doesn’t
want to get shot.

576
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:48,924
Good, because the
whores may like you,

577
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:50,134
but they answer to me.

578
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:54,180
A girl came in traveling light,

579
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,473
probably offered to fuck you
not to tell me she’s here.

580
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:58,601
Well, now I wish she would
have shown up a little later.

581
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:04,148
Yeah, Room 27, up
the stairs on the left.

582
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:07,276
She in?

583
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,736
I don’t know.
I was in my office.

584
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,905
You know, I don’t have
all the answers.

585
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,807
Ola?

586
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:40,601
Um... Ola?

587
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,426
You could have given her
any key, any goddamn room.

588
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,428
The one with your
suitcase in it.

589
00:59:16,512 --> 00:59:18,055
She’ll sit and wait a while.

590
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,473
Buys you time
to get out of here.

591
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,183
She’ll hunt me down
and kill me.

592
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:23,227
I don’t think so.

593
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,479
You don’t either.

594
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,232
You think you can talk
your way out of this,

595
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,608
probably have before.

596
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:33,404
Now the questions are,
should you?

597
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,155
And is your friend worth
more to you than

598
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:36,573
whatever you stole
from her?

599
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,994
They’re not my questions,
of course.

600
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:50,170
You might want to go out
through the alley

601
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,089
and come back in through
the front.

602
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,508
For appearances sake.

603
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,446
Mm.

604
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:30,502
Salud.

605
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:53,150
You fuck her?

606
01:00:57,196 --> 01:00:59,281
Either way, she’s going
to say that you did.

607
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:00,657
And then?

608
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,534
We already killed
her lover tonight.

609
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:14,630
So here we are.

610
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:30,813
I wouldn’t be
sitting there too long.

611
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,689
I was thinking the same thing.

612
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,028
You think that thumb trick
would work a second time?

613
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,782
Think it’s the only trick
I know?

614
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:54,002
Love.

615
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:01,176
Whatever she thinks
will make it stop.

616
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:24,199
I wasn’t waiting to start.

617
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:57,900
Of course.

618
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,611
You don’t
mean shit to her.

619
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:01,695
You get that, right?

620
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,323
Not to her.
To you, though.

621
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:06,700
Do you think you can run
far enough, fast enough?

622
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,285
I think I’m pretty light
on my feet.

623
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:10,621
Not with her hanging
onto your fucking legs!

624
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:11,872
What’s the offer?

625
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:15,167
What do you want?

626
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,668
You just made an argument
for killing you.

627
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:19,463
Don’t ask me what you
think your fucking
goddamned life is worth.

628
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:23,592
She took jewelry,
maybe $100,000 in cash,

629
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:25,260
hidden here
somewhere for sure.

630
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:27,012
Shoot her and it’s
all fucking yours.

631
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,514
I don’t have
anything against her.

632
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:29,973
You don’t have
anything against me either.

633
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:35,270
I kind of don’t like you.

634
01:03:35,354 --> 01:03:36,980
And I did enjoy fucking her.

635
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:44,071
Just kill this
fucking bitch so we can
walk out of here, please.

636
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:53,705
You picked the wrong
one this time.

637
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:54,998
He’s not a killer.

638
01:03:58,377 --> 01:03:59,211
She’s right.

639
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:01,046
Bullshit!

640
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:02,381
Because you were looking
at the scars,

641
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:03,882
not at the man who
lost the taste for it.

642
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:05,759
Now get your purse and
get out of here!

643
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,678
-And then what?
-She gets a head start.

644
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:09,137
And you get what she
stole from me?

645
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:10,556
Maybe.
Back up!

646
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:11,848
-Fuck, no!
-Fuck, yes!

647
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:12,808
No! Fuck, no!

648
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:14,643
-Fuck you!
-Fuck, no!

649
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:30,826
You fucking bitch!

650
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,083
You bitch.

651
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,628
I assumed you had
a gun in your purse.

652
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:25,797
I did. I just got
to the knife first.

653
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:28,675
We need to get rid of the body.
Bring my car around back.

654
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:30,177
Clean up the blood
the best you can.

655
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,928
And then roll her up
in the bedspread.

656
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:33,055
Okay.

657
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:34,431
First, though, the money
and the jewelry.

658
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:36,475
It goes in the safe until
after she’s outta here

659
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,727
so you don’t get the idea
to leave me with this.

660
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:40,729
And after?

661
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,230
I don’t take money
I didn’t earn.

662
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,734
I know it sounds
unlikely but...

663
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,155
You’re just gonna
have to wait and see.

664
01:05:54,076 --> 01:05:54,951
And the rest?

665
01:05:56,495 --> 01:05:58,121
That’s all.

666
01:05:58,205 --> 01:05:59,915
Except for what you were
gonna pay Arana in your bra

667
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,876
on your left breast where
you kept me from touching you.

668
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,254
I mean, I’d love to
go looking for it.

669
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:07,923
But now’s not the time, is it?

670
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,527
You might want to clean
yourself up a little too.

671
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:18,827
Two rooms.

672
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:20,579
You only have two customers.

673
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:21,872
Slow season.

674
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,832
How do you make a living?

675
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:26,543
Low overhead.
Occasional opportunity.

676
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,003
The "occasional opportunity".

677
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:30,380
You know, where you’re standing,
that’s for employees only.

678
01:07:30,464 --> 01:07:32,048
Oh. Pardon.

679
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,594
Bad neighborhood.

680
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:36,928
Yeah, it must be.

681
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:39,222
Shotgun and whatever you
got underneath your shirt.

682
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:44,227
All right.

683
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:50,358
You guys took your time
circling around...

684
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:52,235
Yeah. We had to drive
about half a mile

685
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,237
to send your picture,
get confirmation.

686
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:55,363
Internet sucks.

687
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,741
Should’ve come in.
Got free Wi-Fi.

688
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:08,084
How long have
you had this place?

689
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,085
About a year.

690
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:10,712
A friend of mine
left it to me.

691
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,589
Well, we hear you
don’t have any friends.

692
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:13,507
Not anymore.

693
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,634
Standing still for a year,

694
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:18,303
you had to know that
was gonna be too long.

695
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:20,347
I had obligations, and...

696
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:24,768
you get tired.

697
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,603
That something you
could’ve thought about

698
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:28,939
in the first place.

699
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:31,066
You know the story?

700
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:34,611
Nah, we don’t give a shit
about the story.

701
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,112
We hear lots of stories.

702
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:38,782
See, he’s not gonna appreciate
it, but you might.

703
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,869
A short one?
Yeah, sure.

704
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,539
I’ll buy you a beer.

705
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:47,541
You can cut me off if
you get bored.

706
01:08:49,835 --> 01:08:51,378
Me and Franco...

707
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:53,255
-Franco like this place?
-Yeah.

708
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:55,131
This is him.

709
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:56,550
He had a different
name before.

710
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,426
He changed it after
he bought this place.

711
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,719
Cheaper than buying a new sign.

712
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:03,431
Actually, a lot
more expensive.

713
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,725
See, me and Franco
used to be you and you.

714
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,603
I guess I was you because
Franco wasn’t an asshole.

715
01:09:08,687 --> 01:09:10,897
The organization
found us doing PMC work.

716
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:11,982
PMC?

717
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:14,067
Private Military Contractors,

718
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,570
mercenaries,
ex-Rangers, ex-Seals.

719
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,071
Which were you?

720
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,698
Franco was a Ranger.

721
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:23,660
I was a... truck driver.

722
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,620
Saved his life,
more by accident

723
01:09:25,704 --> 01:09:26,955
than anything else,
if I’m being honest.

724
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:29,040
He took me under his wing.

725
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:30,959
You know, you’re not helping me
keep this story short.

726
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:35,463
Our people hired
you and Franco?

727
01:09:35,547 --> 01:09:36,882
Is it okay if I
fix myself a drink?

728
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:38,383
Please do.

729
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,886
Turned out we were working for
them and didn’t even know it.

730
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:42,846
Cameroon.

731
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:50,186
I learned why they called
them "blood diamonds".

732
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:55,150
Franco was a genius
at that shit.

733
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,610
How to track people down,

734
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:57,986
when to kill them,
when to let...

735
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,989
What did the
organization tell you?

736
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,407
That you stole money.

737
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:07,412
That would be part of
the cautionary tale.

738
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:12,959
So after Cameroon,
Franco and I are sent

739
01:10:13,043 --> 01:10:14,711
all over the world
taking care of shit.

740
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,171
Ah! That’s me and him.

741
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,548
Right.

742
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:23,136
Seven years ago, Mexican Border
Patrol seizes the shipment.

743
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,097
Me and Franco were sent
south with a bag of money.

744
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:27,474
Cops tried to haggle for more.

745
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,143
So the organization says,
"Teach ’em a lesson!

746
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,187
Burn the shipment!
Bring back the money!"

747
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:35,690
Which was good and well.
Nothing new.

748
01:10:39,945 --> 01:10:42,822
Except it was
a shipment of girls,

749
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,824
Eleven, ten.

750
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:48,370
Nine years old.

751
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:54,334
Yeah, so...

752
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:57,671
Aw, this is bullshit.

753
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:02,425
Now why the fuck would
I make up a story like this?

754
01:11:02,509 --> 01:11:03,510
So I wouldn’t kill you.

755
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,888
Jesus Christ!
You are fucking dim.

756
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:08,431
I was you, remember?

757
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:12,352
I heard plenty of stories,
worse stories!

758
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:14,938
It’s all secondhand.
It’s abstract to you.

759
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:18,191
It’s not staring at a cage
full of little girls

760
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,526
and know...

761
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:25,907
light them on fire,
or never go home.

762
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:32,956
So you kept the money
and bolted?

763
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,958
And cut the girls loose.

764
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,252
Any one of the three things
was enough to get us killed.

765
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,379
But my feeling is
setting the girls loose

766
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:40,714
was what really
pissed them off

767
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,716
because then they had
to send someone else

768
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:45,719
to hunt them down
and round them up.

769
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,429
And do what we didn’t.

770
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:52,475
Someone with a tolerance for
that kind of heinous shit.

771
01:11:54,436 --> 01:11:56,312
Maybe even an appetite for it.

772
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,736
So they died anyway?

773
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:05,655
All of that was for nothin’.

774
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:08,950
Didn’t seem like it at the time,
not for Franco, especially.

775
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:12,454
He took one of the girls.

776
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:18,585
No, you assholes,
not like that!

777
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:21,046
A switch flipped,
rolled him back past

778
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:23,506
working for the organization,
back past the merc shit

779
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:26,259
in Cameroon, back to the guy
he imagined he’d be

780
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,595
when he signed up to
fight for his country!

781
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,599
He wanted to be a good guy,
a decent guy.

782
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,642
Bought this place,
bought a new identity.

783
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:40,482
He raised that girl
like a daughter.

784
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:55,288
This guy’s fuckin’ dead.

785
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,582
Yeah, I poisoned him.
We’re almost to that part.

786
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:00,043
Relax.

787
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,795
If I’d been able to pull
that trick twice

788
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,254
we wouldn’t
still be talking.

789
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:05,882
Let’s just do this, man.

790
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,717
/You want to hear
the end, don’t you?

791
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:09,469
I mean the thought of
walking out of here

792
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:11,179
and never having
got to the point?

793
01:13:21,106 --> 01:13:23,316
Franco and the girl?

794
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:27,612
His daughter for all
intents and purposes!

795
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:28,947
And just like
any other daughter,

796
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,991
she turned 17 and decides
that she hates him.

797
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:35,703
Gets involved with some asshole,
convinces her to mule E.

798
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:38,289
Doesn’t even make it out of town
before she’s picked up

799
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:41,501
by this tag team local
policia and federal agent,

800
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:44,003
Miguel Garcia
and Lance Ericson.

801
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,552
What happens next
is anybody’s guess.

802
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:57,809
Suffice it to say
the pills disappear.

803
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:02,480
Then the girl’s body
turns up in a field...

804
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:09,320
naked, tortured...

805
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,993
cut into pieces!

806
01:14:34,888 --> 01:14:37,307
So what do you think Franco,
hardcore soldier,

807
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,601
mercenary, professional killer
like your own bad selves,

808
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:41,603
what do you think
he does next?

809
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,229
He goes after the motherfuckers.

810
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:45,023
Goes after the motherfuckers!

811
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,567
So insane with grief,
he forgets every lesson

812
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,486
he ever taught me about
patience, about stealth.

813
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:57,619
And I didn’t stop him.

814
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:01,831
I didn’t stop Franco.

815
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:04,959
Just like I didn’t stop...

816
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,150
He’s an unguided missile.

817
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,159
And these cops don’t
exist in a vacuum.

818
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:40,286
They’re on the payroll
of a very bad woman...

819
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,459
A woman who doesn’t
give a shit about

820
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:49,671
anybody’s adopted daughter,
his boss,

821
01:15:49,754 --> 01:15:51,005
who also happens to be dead

822
01:15:51,089 --> 01:15:53,383
rolled up in
a bedspread upstairs!

823
01:16:03,434 --> 01:16:05,019
So that’s why you
been here a year?

824
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:06,312
Yeah.

825
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:07,981
Getting even for your
dumb ass friend fucking up

826
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:10,108
getting even for his
dumb ass not-even-daughter?

827
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,986
I take it back, man.

828
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,321
That is the saddest fuckin’
story I’ve ever heard.

829
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:19,951
I’m not surprised
you see it that way.

830
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:25,873
You cut it close,
settling accounts

831
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:27,292
right before we found you.

832
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:30,211
I let you find me.

833
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:35,633
You wanna die?

834
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:45,977
Well, let’s just say
I’ve had a good meal,

835
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,770
and I’m
not hungry anymore.

836
01:16:49,314 --> 01:16:52,567
And because the money won’t
do me any good anymore,

837
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,902
there’s a safe in my office.

838
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,612
Cash, jewelry,

839
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,408
plus about $250,000
in diamonds.

840
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,414
This is the combination.

841
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,793
You should have listened
to your own story.

842
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:14,339
That’s not enough
to buy us off.

843
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:16,716
-It’s not even close.
-I know.

844
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:19,344
It’s motivation for the person
I’ve really been talking to.

845
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:43,451
You had to hear
the fucking story, huh?

846
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:44,410
Let’s go!

847
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:38,464
Ah!

848
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:27,847
Woo!

849
01:20:19,941 --> 01:20:21,317
Come on.

850
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:01,292
Almost worth seeing what you
think you can do with that.

851
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:04,670
But I been trying to
get the fuck outta here

852
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:06,130
for the last half hour.

853
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:28,569
In my day, a professional
wouldn’t use a strange gun

854
01:22:28,653 --> 01:22:29,904
without checking it first.

855
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:35,660
Let’s go get your stuff.

856
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:48,714
You’re Arana.

857
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,218
I used a cutout to deal
with your girlfriend,

858
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,178
but, yeah, pretty much.

859
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:57,598
Bad news is, I don’t have
a new identity for you.

860
01:22:57,682 --> 01:23:00,976
Good news is, with her dead,
you don’t need one.

861
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:02,228
You couldn’t have known.

862
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:04,230
Not everything.

863
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:08,442
You leading her to me
was definitely Plan B.

864
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:14,240
Plan A was her and
Lance killed each other.

865
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:16,575
And maybe me.

866
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:20,162
I would have felt
badly about that.

867
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:21,580
Not badly enough.

868
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:22,665
No.

869
01:23:30,381 --> 01:23:32,091
Took them out of Cameroon.

870
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:34,677
Never felt right
about spending them.

871
01:23:36,721 --> 01:23:38,222
And those two out there?

872
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:39,890
Bought me some time
before their people

873
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:41,434
send the next pair
looking for me.

874
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,228
I hate to cut this short,

875
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:46,480
but I have a few last things
to do before I go.

876
01:23:47,982 --> 01:23:48,983
Go where?

877
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:40,075
What if I’d killed Sanchez?

878
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:44,830
There was a Plan C.

879
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,584
I didn’t kill those girls.

880
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:51,295
I couldn’t.

881
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:55,674
You didn’t stop it.

882
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:56,759
No.

883
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:01,806
I didn’t.

884
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:20,950
I haven’t been right since.

885
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:22,868
I haven’t been able
to look at my daughter.

886
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,789
You want me to say I’m sorry?

887
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:28,874
You want me to say anything
other than fuck you?

888
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:30,709
Oh, well, you don’t
have the right.

889
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:32,503
No, I don’t.

890
01:25:34,672 --> 01:25:35,840
The guy you hired me through,

891
01:25:35,923 --> 01:25:37,716
when he finds out
that Sanchez is dead,

892
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,385
he’s gonna go
after my daughter.

893
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:52,523
Her number’s in there.

894
01:25:53,607 --> 01:25:55,651
It’s the only number in there.

895
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:56,944
That’s not my problem.

896
01:25:57,945 --> 01:26:00,155
You set this in motion!

897
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:01,866
What do you expect me to do?

898
01:26:06,245 --> 01:26:07,621
What you seem to do best.

899
01:26:09,582 --> 01:26:10,666
Just think of something.

900
01:26:49,496 --> 01:26:51,040
Oh, for Christ’s sake.

901
01:26:52,164 --> 01:27:07,264
