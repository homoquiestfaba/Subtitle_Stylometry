Oh, no.

about this.

you hated responsibility.

Hey, penguin!
I thought of that long ago.

1081

I'm just choosing the best way
to go about it.

how I wipe out your kin,

Then just move away from the house,
as far as you can.

from the antenna!

Okay, that's it!
Time to beat it!

1099
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,483
If you hit the cage from the inside,
it shrinks.

1100
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:26,517
But maybe if you give it a good wallop
from the outside,

1101
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,315
it will break up, or grow in size...

1102
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:30,855
so that I can get out.

So I'm not afraid of heights.

1106

I'll just climb a bit higher,
to make sure, and then I'll jump.

Huh?

1241
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:42,258
B-But...

1242
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:43,664
you can talk?

1243
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:47,705
Why didn't you say anything
before now, dummy?

1244
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,103
Ah!

1245
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:54,978
Well, before, the gingerbreads
used to be good.

1246
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,309
Ah!

1247
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:03,222
Sir!

1248
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:04,549
Home, at last!

1249
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:08,819
Sir, I'm so glad you survived!

1250
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:09,621
Captain!

1251
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:10,353
Wait!

1252
01:18:10,553 --> 01:18:12,032
Oh, my captain!

1253
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:14,326
Oh, my benevolent dictator...

1254
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:17,697
Oh, my hero. My captain...
Duckmus!

1255
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:23,303
A toast to my son, the sun duck!

1256
01:18:23,499 --> 01:18:25,001
Here, here!

1257
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:29,672
And a toast to Duckmus, my friend and
comrade-in-arms,

1258
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:35,220
whose daughter I am graciously
allowing to befriend my son.

1259
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:36,014
Thank you.

1260
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:40,319
Although what's actually happened is
that I am graciously allowing your son

1261
01:18:40,516 --> 01:18:42,894
to befriend my daughter.

1262
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:46,259
I have also decreed that the happy
chums shall live together

1263
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:50,368
in our flock, as honored Mandarins.

1264
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,266
And I decree that the happy couple

1265
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:56,601
will live in our flock
as honored mallards.

1266
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:59,506
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not going to happen.

1267
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:04,750
I'm trying to eat some cake, here!

1268
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:05,509
Oy!

1269
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:08,382
You can't eat cake
until the happy chums are here.

1270
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:15,691
Oh, well, Longway said I could
just go ahead and eat it.

1271
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:18,364
Because they took off there...

1272
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:22,300
to Hawaii.

1273
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,610
Oh, then, it shouldn't take long
to find them.

1274
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,440
They're still here on the island.

1275
01:19:35,638 --> 01:19:37,481
What's wrong with you?

1276
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:39,583
You need to check your gas mask
for a leak.

1277
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,779
I think some poison gas got
into your brain or something.

1278
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:43,978
Penguin!

1279
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:47,050
Don't make me declare war
on you again.

1280
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,423
Because I'll do it.
I will bring the fury of a...
