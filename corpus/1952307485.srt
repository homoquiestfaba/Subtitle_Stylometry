1
00:00:31,723 --> 00:00:33,782
New York city.

2
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,922
The central crossroad
of the city.

3
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:42,660
People have believed
this since long.

4
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,628
Living life a new way.

5
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:47,806
People from all over the world..

6
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:50,534
..come here by the means
of plane, ship, train.

7
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,977
They leave behind their family..

8
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:55,773
..friends and nation.

9
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:59,782
Their motive is to earn
a lot of money.

10
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:05,690
Our story is also about
such people..

11
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,059
..in a city where
dreams turn real.

12
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,390
They fight their troubles
with great grit.

13
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:15,329
And they try to forget their
troubles on Holi.

14
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:20,297
Holi, a colourful festival
of lndia.

15
00:01:45,497 --> 00:01:49,263
This is Meera, A financial
consultant in Wallstreet.

16
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:53,662
ln search of harmony, she leaves
behind a successful..

17
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:58,868
..but stressful life. She's a
yoga teacher by profession.

18
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:02,370
Life has definitely gifted
her with luxury.

19
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:04,716
But she hasn't been gifted
with a child yet..

20
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:07,444
..the biggest happiness
of a woman.

21
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,458
This is Dev, Meera's
charming husband.

22
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,329
The publisher of
a very successful..

23
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,363
..magazine, American home.

24
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:23,234
He in the pursuit of
making a journal..

25
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:25,199
..which is away from
profit earning.

26
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:27,429
Yet, close to his heart.

27
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:31,201
This unsuccessful newspaper
is named, lndian Voice.

28
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:35,643
For which, he invested all the
money he had earned till date.

29
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,777
Megan, Meera's, college friend.

30
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,752
She has a God's gift.

31
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:45,982
She can resolve problems in
others' life by tarot cards.

32
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:50,717
But cannot resolve
her, own problems.

33
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,666
Hey, sweetheart!

34
00:02:57,168 --> 00:03:00,103
l was going to call you,
in a few moments!

35
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,738
What did they say?

36
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:03,174
As usual..

37
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:06,243
They need to conduct some tests
and only then can they infer.

38
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:08,546
Oh honey! Don't worry about it.

39
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,046
But you need to talk
to Dev about it.

40
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:13,251
Meg, l don't want to talk about
this, right now, love.

41
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:15,046
So, we're meeting for lunch
today, aren't we?

42
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:16,447
Don't be late!

43
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:18,886
Okay, l'll reach on time.
See you later!

44
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:25,797
You've spoken to the
printer, right?

45
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:28,764
How many times have l
answered this. Yes!

46
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,800
And their answer remains the
same. They wouldn't wait!

47
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:35,473
Dev, Dev!

48
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:38,243
This makes the money, right?

49
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,311
But this, lndian Voice doesn't.

50
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:42,413
lt's a simple thing, Dev.

51
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,307
But l can't stop this. Our
community needs a forum and..

52
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:51,411
..this is the only way. -Yes.
But it's a waste of money.

53
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:00,326
Dev, look at me.

54
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:05,499
There's one more thing. l just
got a call from the bank.

55
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,972
They've said that you've got
                time to repay the 4$ lakhs..

56
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:10,597
..by Monday. -l know it!

57
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:14,234
Dev, they'll stop all this.

58
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:18,179
They'll put an end to all
this. To all this!

59
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:20,041
l'm worried about you.

60
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,584
About your magazine, and
trust me, even your..

61
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:26,383
..newspaper. But what can we do?

62
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:31,284
See, l'm going to meet
a very big investor.

63
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:32,830
And l'll find a way out of this.

64
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,795
l've done this, earlier as well.

65
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:37,502
l just need some time,
nothing more.

66
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:40,070
Yes, l can give some time.

67
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:42,732
That's my girl.

68
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,270
Two weeks, not more.

69
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,021
Oh, this will be so nice, lsha.

70
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:07,589
Yes, tomorrow night.
Yes, tomorrow night.

71
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:13,003
Yes, you can definitely get
Cooky along with you. Of course!

72
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:17,903
Hello! Hello!

73
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:40,288
Yes, sir. Sorry, the phone
got disconnected.

74
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,961
Ofcourse! Well, timing is
very important for this.

75
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:50,770
Yes, that'll be great. Okay!

76
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,595
Thanks for the card.

77
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:25,332
ls there room for one
more, in there?

78
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:02,875
My dress! Be careful, my dress.

79
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,950
This is my favourite dress.
-l'll get a new one..

80
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,618
..for you, queen. -Promise
me first!

81
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,846
l promise you! -Then
l won't need this.

82
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:14,624
You look better without this.

83
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:19,221
lt won't be so good in front
of the guests, l guess!

84
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:34,978
Don't even think of receiving
the call. -Please. -No!

85
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:38,445
lt's very important. Very
important. -Dev!

86
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,685
Hello. Hey, Jee.

87
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:45,755
What did they say?

88
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,919
Operators. -What did they say?

89
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,800
Look, lsha, is going to come
to the party tomorrow.

90
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,232
l'll talk it all out then.

91
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:01,501
l don't believe this!

92
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:04,808
But l don't think, Jee, that
it'll be of any use.

93
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:09,237
l hadn't told anybody about
this since years.

94
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,480
Well, look, l'll call
you tomorrow. Okay?

95
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,653
Keep this. You can talk over
the phone, all night.

96
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,924
Baby! -Happy? -Please, please,
give me a chance.

97
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:24,221
No work related topics at home,
Dev. You know this well.

98
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:27,963
And yes, by the way, happy
birthday, love!

99
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,066
Meera!

100
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:41,778
O heart! lt's difficult
to survive here.

101
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:47,177
Be careful. Beware. This is
Mumbai -New York, my dear.

102
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,448
Vikraman, Vikraman, Vikraman.
This is Vani, Meera's sister.

103
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:54,522
Since the time, Vani started
worrying about others.

104
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:57,420
Since then, God has
taken a long leave.

105
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:00,194
This is Shekhar, Vani's husband.

106
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,190
He's always troubled
with Vani's nature.

107
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,033
Are you having any problem, son?

108
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,931
What? -l'm asking whether
you're comfortable?

109
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:13,805
Yes. -You don't want to go to
the bathroom, right? -No!

110
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:16,511
He'll tell you whenever
he wants to go.

111
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:20,141
Or do you want to go?

112
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:23,182
No. -lf you want to, then
let me know now.

113
00:09:24,555 --> 00:09:25,715
Okay.

114
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:29,423
You're unnecessarily
pestering him, Vani.

115
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:34,156
Now, will he piss
on your command?

116
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,560
We even have to arrange
for his food.

117
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,330
Lui, Lui!

118
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:47,970
What happened? -What's next!?
-You forgot the lines again?

119
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:49,981
Sorry. -l don't have
so much of time.

120
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:51,981
C'mon, let's do it again. -Okay,
focus, focus. lt'll be fine.

121
00:09:52,616 --> 00:09:55,346
This is Javed. Meera's
filmmaker friend.

122
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:59,653
He has been trying to make his
first film, since, 10 yrs now.

123
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,585
Jennifer, a struggling actress,
who loves Javed.

124
00:10:04,762 --> 00:10:08,562
But Javed, still doesn't know
what role she plays in his life.

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,436
A girlfriend, an actress or..

126
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:19,038
Lui, Lui, answer me.

127
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:23,536
lt was good! -Not feeling
satiated. -lt was good!

128
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:25,082
What's happening? -There
can be no better takes.

129
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,877
My head's aching.
-Just a minute.

130
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:29,684
Hello, Larry! What's up, friend?

131
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,681
Yes, l'm fine. Did
you talk to them?

132
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:36,418
Oh! What a news!

133
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:39,525
l'll just take 5 minutes. l'll
call you back in twenty minutes.

134
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:43,728
Okay? -l'm losing the mood.

135
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:46,166
l was taking an audition.
-Go to hell, idiot!

136
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,267
You felt bad!

137
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,937
Don't pester him!

138
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,773
Now will you tell him that..

139
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:55,906
l have to tell him, Shekhar.

140
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,581
You know, it created a problem
in school. -What problem, Vani?

141
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:03,012
You won't understand.
Don't you know..

142
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:06,646
..how they treat foreign
children? -He's not a foreigner.

143
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:09,185
He's an American who's
taken birth here.

144
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:13,459
Did l do something wrong?
-No, son. lt's not you.

145
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:17,223
l don't know what l'm
going to tell your..

146
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:21,029
..to your brother-in-law,
magazine. What's his name? Kohli!

147
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:24,335
His name is Dev, Shekhar.
-Okay! -Dev!

148
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:26,566
Okay, shall we leave?

149
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:29,202
Everything comes onto me.

150
00:11:31,615 --> 00:11:33,276
Darling, we've tried everything.

151
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,914
There's some problem. lt can
be anything. Fibroids..

152
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,958
..endometriosis, l don't know.
lt can be anything.

153
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:42,548
Did you go to the doctor?

154
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:46,251
No, ofcourse not! l would've
told you. God!

155
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,395
Hey!

156
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:53,034
Come here!

157
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,739
Come here! Come here, come here!

158
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,673
lt can even be stress.
l don't know!

159
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:08,350
Jee told me about
this. -Oh great!

160
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:11,615
So, now you discuss our problems
with your girlfriend.

161
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:13,290
She's not my girlfriend.
-Yes, l know.

162
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,914
She's just a friend. -Please.

163
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:17,754
l don't want to argue
with you, Dev. Okay?

164
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:28,027
Hello. Hey, hi, Bhavna!

165
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,509
How can l sleep knowing
that you're going..

166
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:33,543
..to ruin my lawn tomorrow.

167
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:36,773
Yes, she's here.

168
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:44,110
Bhavna. -As, l, the organiser
of your holy celebrations.

169
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,212
l require a little
bit more respect.

170
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:49,089
So how many guests do
you have coming?

171
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,958
Twelve-fifteen people. Yeah!

172
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:54,593
Everybody will reach
by today evening.

173
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:57,223
Oh listen! l'm bringing
the whole gang.

174
00:12:57,835 --> 00:13:01,396
Thanks a ton, dear! Take care!
l'll talk to you later, bye!

175
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,975
Sit in the car! Sit in the car!

176
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:11,948
Listen to mummy. Hey, pacify
my mom anyhow. Okay?

177
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:15,843
Children, don't pester your
grand mom. -Okay, dad!

178
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,554
Okay! l love you!

179
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:21,217
lf you mess up this time,
then watch out!

180
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:22,960
l promise that l wouldn't
do anything.

181
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,584
You must go and meet your mom.

182
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,458
What will l tell them, there?
-l need to attend meetings.

183
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:29,692
How do l leave my
business? Look..

184
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,461
..l'll come. lt's just a matter
of few days. Okay?

185
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,497
Okay? -Alright!

186
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:38,899
See you then!

187
00:13:45,182 --> 00:13:47,742
Hey Rich! -How are you, friend?

188
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,385
Bye!

189
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:58,259
Have you gone nuts? You shouldn't
get divorced before elections.

190
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:01,131
People give preference
to married men.

191
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:05,031
And you mustn't do
this. Yes. Yes.

192
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:09,302
No, no. Wait, wait. Certain
things need to be cleared.

193
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:11,700
That's all your problem.
So, deal with it.

194
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:14,643
Money is mine and l won't
invest them on a loser.

195
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:16,904
Now, meet Dr. Nimesh.

196
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:18,841
He lives in his own world.

197
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,118
lf someone can be the president
of the male chauvinist club..

198
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:24,710
..lt's Dr. Nimesh.

199
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:29,992
Sujata, Nimesh's wife.

200
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:33,121
She's trying her best
to save the marriage.

201
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,698
Blindfolding Nimesh's
foolishness.

202
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:39,327
The same sari? -Didn't you like
it? Should l go and change?

203
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,900
No, what can we do. Let's
go! -C'mon, let's leave!

204
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,240
This bag is so heavy.
-Else we'll be later.

205
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,705
l've got everything
that you asked for.

206
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,403
Preeti, what's this? Your back
is completely bare. -l know!

207
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,111
Doesn't my figure look good?

208
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:53,043
Truly, she's looking sexy.
-Thank you! -You're welcome.

209
00:14:53,284 --> 00:14:55,980
l'll go and change the sari if
you say. l'll just take a minute.

210
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:58,748
No, you're looking
fine. Don't worry!

211
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:07,589
Hey guys! You're back?
-No, it's our spirit.

212
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:13,236
Did you get everything? -Yes..
-Kamala got everything, right?

213
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:16,573
Hey, don't l ever get anything?
-l know, darling.

214
00:15:16,907 --> 00:15:19,102
Hey.

215
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:22,837
Where did it go? -Just
at the right place.

216
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,948
Excuse me, just let me
have a look once.

217
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:29,285
Not now, l'm very busy.

218
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,288
What is it? We don't have time.

219
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:36,321
Where did it go? -l'm not
finding that again.

220
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:43,395
Baby!

221
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:49,005
Dev!

222
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,906
What is this? -This!

223
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:55,045
Looks like a pregnancy test kit.

224
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:58,342
l know what this is. What
is it doing in the bag?

225
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:02,319
You just have to check. -We've
talked it out already.

226
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,650
You can just check once. Just
check! -We've talked it out.

227
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:16,054
Kamala! -Yes. -Wear that nice
American dress of yours.

228
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,929
Change sooner. Guests are
coming. Put this inside and..

229
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:26,810
Go and..

230
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:47,356
Hey, monkey! You've grown
up to be so big.

231
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:50,097
You'be become so big. You
took so much time. -Hi!

232
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:52,662
Hello, Shekhar. How are you?

233
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:55,702
l'm growing old. -Nonsense,
brother-in-law.

234
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,034
This is your twenty-first year.

235
00:16:58,242 --> 00:16:59,943
You're the perfect,
sister-in-law. -lsn't it?

236
00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:01,476
You made my day!
-Where's sister?

237
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:06,981
Oh my God! How are you?

238
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:10,016
Where's the bathroom?
-Sure, sure.

239
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:12,949
Take a left from inside. -Okay!

240
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,621
How are you?

241
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:19,089
Can l smoke at yoga teacher's
place? -Of course!

242
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:22,427
Yoga teacher, herself smokes.
-Let it be, anyone for tea?

243
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:25,126
Why not? -Okay, coming up!

244
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:31,802
Thanks.

245
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:34,802
Quite a big house!

246
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:38,404
Like a palace. -Thank you.

247
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:42,245
Seems like your magazine
is doing well. -Well..

248
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:45,384
..circulation is increasing.
-Great!

249
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,290
And tell me about yourself.
How's it going?

250
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,824
By God's grace.

251
00:17:57,968 --> 00:18:00,835
Jennifer, will you make it fast?

252
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,500
Jen!

253
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:09,901
Jen, you're inside since
an hour. Can we go now?

254
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:14,113
Jen, l'll wait for your
downstairs, okay?

255
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,147
Give me some answer.

256
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:23,014
Larry, tell me! -Javed. -Jen,
l'm waiting downstairs.

257
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:25,124
Okay.

258
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:28,522
This is a great news. -But
there's one more thing.

259
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,265
What's it? -That girl.

260
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:34,594
Which girl? -l'm talking
about Jennifer.

261
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:36,836
What about, Jennifer?

262
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,837
l didn't want to tell you this.
But you should part with her.

263
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:45,037
l mean, at least till
this movie ends.

264
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:48,007
You're telling me this,
after so many days.

265
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:50,051
Larry, you introduced me to her.

266
00:18:50,153 --> 00:18:53,645
Yes, l know. She had an
affair with Robbie.

267
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:57,486
Who, Robbie? -That same Robbie,
our financial Robbie.

268
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:02,727
Oh man! -Now, do you understand?

269
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,869
Are you listening? -Yes, l

Now handle it further.
-Larry, l know it.

00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:18,742
Okay, l'll handle everything.
You don't have to worry.

272
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:30,253
Take this, sister. -Thank you.

273
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:34,595
So, you're liking it, right?

274
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:39,068
Yeah, it takes time to
adjust but it's nice.

275
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,161
You find it just okay? Meera.

276
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:47,266
This is such a big house. What
better can happen? -You're right.

277
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:53,545
Meera.

278

280
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:05,159
Dev, your tea is becoming
cold, love.

281
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:10,834
Sister, there are so many
things. l mean, handling business..

282
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:13,368
..commuting. l really don't
want to talk about it.

283
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:17,803
Maybe, you need a child. -No,
not baby talk, no. -Meera.

284
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:21,809
lt's been so many years
of your marriage.

285
00:20:23,113 --> 00:20:25,638

Greetings, sister. -Greetings!
-And she is our..

Now will you please do me

293
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,934
Wear something good.

294
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,569
This is fine, sister.
-No, no, it's not.

295
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:47,538
Please, go and change. Please!

00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:49,265

297
00:20:51,475 --> 00:20:54,410
Okay, wear something else.
Don't wear pants.

298
00:20:54,511 --> 00:20:56,445
Okay? -Greetings.

299
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,442
She's very sweet,
isn't she? -Yes.

300
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:02,107
And you.. -What are the ladies
talking? -Come, come.

301
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:05,415
Where is my tea, sweetheart? -l
have kept it on the counter. -Ok.

302
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,524
By the way, Vikram was getting
bored so l engaged him..

303
00:21:07,624 --> 00:21:09,760
..with the computer. -You
did the right thing.

304
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,961
He doesn't talk much.

305
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,189
Anyways, what's more interesting
to a teenager than porn-surfing?

306
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,998
Vikram doesn't so all that.

307
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,403
Of course! He doesn't so that.
-Yeah. -l'll take the tea.

308
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:22,097
You'll are fine. Enjoy, alright!

309
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,610
He was just saying it, don't take
it seriously. Yes, but Vikram..

310
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,940
..doesn't so all that. -Of
course not, Vikram is a good boy.

311
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:38,052
Come, Preeti.

312
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:40,919
Oh! We finally reached. -We're
not all that late.

313
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:43,317
Hello, doctor. How are you? -l'm

314
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,996
Very well. Very well. Oh! Who

315
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,332
She is my wife, Sujata.

316
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,230
Now, do l know the secret behind
your success? Lovely meeting you!

317
00:21:51,702 --> 00:21:54,193
And this is, Preeti,
my sister-in-law.

318
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:56,931
Same here. Pleasure, pleasure.
-Thank you. She's tomorrow's star.

319
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,143
Oh! Great people amongst

320
00:22:00,243 --> 00:22:03,313
..my brother-in-law, Shekhar.
Hi -Hello! Hello -Hi!

321
00:22:03,413 --> 00:22:04,648
How are you doing?

322
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:06,113
Hi, Shekhar. l'm Dr. Nimesh.

323
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:09,444
Oh, so you're a doctor? -Yes,
doctor of politics.

324
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:12,289
When he's not running the
clinic, he runs the city.

325
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:13,857
He's got the habit of kidding.

326
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,051
Well, the ladies are in the
kitchen, if you please to go..

327
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:18,855
..Oh! Just like an lndian party.

328
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:22,420
Men out and women in the
kitchen. -You're taunting, now.

329
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,158
So, Nimesh, welcome home!

330
00:22:25,268 --> 00:22:27,862
Hi! l'm Sujata. Dr.
Nimesh's wife.

331
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,663
Oh! Hi, nice to meet you.

332
00:22:30,774 --> 00:22:34,210
..younger sister.-Oh! sisters,

333
00:22:34,344 --> 00:22:37,541
Hi, Vani, Sujata. -Nice meeting
you. -Nice meeting you, too.

334
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,844
You people look so different,
unlike sisters. We're different.

335
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:43,279
l'm from a town and she's
a Bombay chick.

336
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:46,556
Bombay chick? -She's my sister
but behaves like a mom.

337
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,421
Oh! This happens always.
My sister's the same.

338
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,710
What's happening here?

339
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:23,154
Oh! l was just checking my
e-mail? -E-mail? -Yes.

340
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,252
And this popped up by itself!

341
00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:28,626
Wear your belt. -Look,
l'm being honest.

342
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:31,428
This popped up by itself. l
didn't do a thing. Look!

343
00:23:31,568 --> 00:23:34,867
Ok, relax! Relax! You'll get
a heart attack, relax!

344
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,268
Did l scare you? l'm
sorry, l'm sorry!

345
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:44,677
l'm Preeti. Nice to meet you.

346
00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:47,213
Vikram! -Vikram.

347
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:50,318
Nice to meet you.
-l need to go.

348
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:55,515
Meera.

349
00:23:58,128 --> 00:23:59,891
Hey, Megan. -Dev!

350
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,599
You were supposed to come in the
morning! -This is my morning.

351
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:05,634
Megan, God! lt's good to see you.
-Hello, my love. -You made it!

352
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:08,860
How are you? -Hey, handsome!

353
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:11,832
How are you? -How am
l? l'll tell you.

354
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:14,067
Maybe l'll lose my
job on Monday.

355
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:17,078
l haven't been on a date since
a year and my cat has left.

356
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:19,214
And the rest..

357
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,949
Are you drunk? -l'm fine.

358
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:24,919
Well, Megan, this is Geetanjali.

359
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:27,216
We call her Jee, Megan.

360
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:30,492
Hi! -This is Meera. -l've
heard a lot about you.

361
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:31,616
You've met Meera already.

362
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:35,255
Meera, your house is really
pretty like Taj Mahal.

363
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,534
Oh! l've got something for
you. Where did l keep it?

364
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:41,900
Oh! Here it is!

365
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,671
Seems like you made it.

366
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,305
Thank you!

367
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:47,844
Wow, thank you so much.

368
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,703
lsn't it beautiful, Meg?

369
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,441
Yes, it's beautiful. Wow!

370
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,746
Can we go inside? Thanks!

371
00:24:56,186 --> 00:25:00,213
Like you've been made..

372
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:03,121
..for me. -So here
you are! -Hi!

373
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:05,956
Oh my God! Congratulations,
Javed!

374
00:25:06,096 --> 00:25:07,825
Finally, your efforts
bore fruit.

375
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,864
Dev, how are you? -Very well.

376
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,729
Did you start your job? -Yes.

377
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:14,971
l'll introduce you to the
ladies. This is Geetanjali.

378
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:19,667
She works with me. -l'm his
slave. -This is my sister, Vani.

379
00:25:20,777 --> 00:25:23,245
He's a great friend of
mine. -Mr. Hollywood?

380
00:25:23,346 --> 00:25:27,077
Yeah, he's going to start
off with his first film.

381
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:31,883
C'mon, talk about it. This is
your first film after 10 yrs.

382
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:34,616
lt's such a great news. -This
is the beautiful? -Jennifer.

383
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:37,318
Hi, Jennifer. -How are you
doing? -She's so beautiful.

384
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,960
Are you an actress?
-Yes, she is.

385
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,088
She's a very good actress. -ls
she the heroine in your film?

386
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:47,693
Well, l've found something good..
-No, l'm just a girlfriend.

387
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:52,667
Oh! Well.. -That's great!

388
00:25:52,776 --> 00:25:56,007
Lucky guy! You're really
a lucky guy!

389
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,756
Good times! Good times!

390
00:26:12,896 --> 00:26:17,663
Good times!

391
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:21,134
Good times!

392
00:26:21,237 --> 00:26:25,333
Life's like this.

393
00:26:36,453 --> 00:26:37,647
Laugh a little.

394
00:26:37,787 --> 00:26:40,881
C'mon, there's only some time
left. lsha will reach anytime.

395
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,289
l'm sorry. l'm a little tensed
since a few days.

396
00:26:44,427 --> 00:26:46,054
Tell me, who's not?

397
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,464
By the way, do l look tensed?

398
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:51,524
Don't seem to.

399
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:57,038
l'm not talking about work. You
know about my personal life.

400
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,102
lt's going to be a year,
now. -l know.

401
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:02,176
l'm ill-fated since childhood.

402
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:03,813
Maybe, l'm goin through all this
because l broke that guy's..

403
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,972
..heart in third standard.

404
00:27:30,907 --> 00:27:34,638
Come here! -What happened?
-Check that out.

405
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:38,178
She's getting on him for
a promotion, isn't it?

406
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:42,582
No, l promise. lt's nothing like
that. They're just good friends.

407
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:46,917
Maybe, they don't hold anything
now but this is how it starts.

408
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,758
Okay, then, l'll keep an
eye on them, henceforth.

409
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,460
Hey!

410
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,131
Now, let's go inside and talk.

411
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,060
Did you tell her?

412
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,132
She runs my house and supported
me throughout.

413
00:28:07,243 --> 00:28:09,677
You're just bothered about your
magazine and everybody's support.

414
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,179
Blah, blah, blah!

415
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,850
Tell her everything, Dev!

416
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,043
You're lucky that you
got her. -l know!

417
00:28:16,386 --> 00:28:19,685
But her sister seems to be
different. -Don't bother that!

418
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,595
Have you seen Javed?
-He must be around.

419
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,896
Do you know about tarot cards?

420
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,803
Since how many years have
you been reading them?

421
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:43,307
lt's been long. -Sorry,
l'm Jennifer.

422
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,176
Megan. You've come with Javed.
-Yes, with him and you?

423
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:53,515
With my cards. Jennifer tell me
one thing, should l take this off?

424
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,353
Yes, even l felt so.

425
00:28:58,428 --> 00:29:01,591
Oh God! l'm having a bad
mood today. l mean..

426
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,529
..l didn't want to come here.

427
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,598
l just came to support
him and he's missing.

428
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:09,136
Javed is like this.

429
00:29:11,074 --> 00:29:13,838
Should l tell you something
about yourself? -Why not?

430
00:29:14,344 --> 00:29:16,744
l'm afraid but, sure.

431
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,904
lt's better than sitting idle.

432
00:29:26,189 --> 00:29:27,747
What are you doing, now?

433
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,717
Did l scare you? -No, stop this!

434
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:33,658
Okay. -Please!

435
00:29:34,531 --> 00:29:37,728
You know what? l know these
American guys well.

436
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:40,831
What do you think of them?

437
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:44,373
l've heard that these people
take drugs, party every night..

438
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:47,237
..and enjoy with girls.

439
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,179
Well, how did you get
to know about this?

440
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,880
This is what happens
in American TV.

441
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,074
l know everything. -This
means that you..

442
00:29:54,384 --> 00:29:56,375
..have rid..

443
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:59,478
..big elephants and your
dad deals with it.

444
00:29:59,622 --> 00:30:03,718
No, how did you come across
this? -By our TV.

445
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,985
Do you have a girlfriend? -No!

446
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:10,297
l don't have a girlfriend.

447
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,793
So, you're a virgin? -What!? No!

448
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,202
Why are you asking? -Have
you ever kissed a girl?

449
00:30:17,307 --> 00:30:20,037
l've done it many times.
-Oh, okay! -Vikram!

450
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:25,009
Well, what have you got to
do with it? -Fine, sorry.

451
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,211
Mom's calling. -Okay!

452
00:30:34,557 --> 00:30:36,320
So you're a big filmmaker?

453
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:41,490
Well, won't call it big but
then yes, l make films.

454
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,866
How many films have you
made till date? -Well..

455
00:30:46,002 --> 00:30:47,936
This will be my first film.

456
00:30:48,037 --> 00:30:50,173
And he's made some
documentaries.. -Two of them!

457
00:30:50,273 --> 00:30:52,104
They're really good,
brother-in-law.

458
00:30:52,242 --> 00:30:54,472
How many years have you
spent doing this?

459
00:30:56,246 --> 00:30:59,374
10 yrs. -Oh, 10 yrs?

460
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,178
This is one thing l don't
understand about this field!

461
00:31:02,518 --> 00:31:06,113
We make furniture and if l take
10 yrs to make a table, then..

462
00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:09,020
..my family will die
out of starvation.

463
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:13,322
Well, l'm lucky not to have a
family. So, no one remains hungry.

464
00:31:14,097 --> 00:31:17,123
By the way, making a film
will be really difficult.

465
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:20,168
Much difficult that making
tables. -Agreed!

466
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,067
Nothing's difficult!

467
00:31:22,572 --> 00:31:25,132
10 yrs is too much
to make a film.

468
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:28,033
Are you making a Mughal-E-Azam,
brother?

469
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,972
lt's just a matter of money,
nothing more is needed!

470
00:31:31,114 --> 00:31:34,106
So are you an actress? -Yes,
a struggling actress.

471
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,014
Yes, l've learnt acting
from Loyalo Marimon.

472
00:31:37,153 --> 00:31:38,814
Sorry, what?

473
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:41,891
University, darling. She's
talking about university.

474
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:43,826
Oh, university! Even l
wanted to join one.

475
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:47,885
l was telling him if l could
join next year.. -This is good.

476
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:51,133
Absolutely, you must go.
l think it's great!

477
00:31:51,234 --> 00:31:52,535
l think it's a bad idea.

478
00:31:52,635 --> 00:31:53,932
What will you do there?
-What will she do?

479
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,903
What will she do in a university
-She's got everything.

480
00:31:57,407 --> 00:31:59,773
And even after having everything,
she wants to join college.

481
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,344
Of course! This is
her own choice.

482
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:05,680
ls it? This choice is a
stupid feminism talk.

483
00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:08,979
Feminism and choice, how
do you connect them?

484
00:32:10,453 --> 00:32:14,787
And this is Vikram.
Say hi, Vikram.

485
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:19,655
l have to go.

486
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:23,793
And that was Vikram, ladies
and gentleman.

487
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,828
What's going on? -Who? -No, no.

488
00:32:28,938 --> 00:32:31,532
Who? What are you talking
about? -She!

489
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:35,373
She's just a friend, nothing
more. -Really?

490
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:39,072
Don't you like her? -As far as
l know, she's an actress.

491
00:32:39,182 --> 00:32:41,150
And she's working in my film.

492
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,079
And till then, you're taking
advantage as a director.

493
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,983
Then what? Should l introduce
her to my mom?

494
00:32:46,122 --> 00:32:47,557
lf she collapses
due to shock..

495
00:32:47,657 --> 00:32:49,591
..then there's no
question of marriage.

496
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,056
Yes, but you like her..

497
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:59,458
Hey, Jennifer, are you alright?
-ls your health fine?

498
00:33:02,305 --> 00:33:05,797
What's wrong? -Can l go to the
bathroom, please? -Of course!

499
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,878
l'll come along. -You sit. l'll
take her. Come, come, my dear.

500
00:33:10,012 --> 00:33:11,138
What happened?

501
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:15,575
Don't know what's wrong!
-Not bad, Preeti!

502
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:18,052
Wow! Anything more?

503
00:33:18,588 --> 00:33:21,921
l have seen your past, your
karmic relations..

504
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:27,261
..now let's see your future.
-Yes, yes. -Okay.

505
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:31,190
The mortality card. -Mortality?

506
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:33,996
lt's good, don't worry!

507
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,234
lt's feeling good. What
are you applying?

508
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:42,344
lt's very easy. A little
turmeric in mustard oil..

509
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:45,937
..and salt to boil it and you'll
be healed in two hours.

510
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:48,778
Wow! Very good!

511
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:52,886
The same pain, again? -Yes,
it's better now.

512
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,620
We should keep someone
like her as well.

513
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,686
What happened? Why is
your face swollen?

514
00:34:00,797 --> 00:34:05,166
You know, Preeti, is
troubling Vikram.

515
00:34:05,701 --> 00:34:07,293
You've started off again.

516
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,738
Why do you hate everybody?

517
00:34:09,872 --> 00:34:11,305
Preeti, you're doing great!

518
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:14,308
Really? l mean.. it
feels so good.

519
00:34:14,444 --> 00:34:17,936
i came here and now Javed's
giving me a role in his film.

520
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:22,848
You too? Wow! -l feel so
happy! -When is my turn?

521
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:25,413
You keep this, please?

522
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:27,757
Preeti, what are you doing?
We're in a party!

523
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,417
But this is your business.

524
00:34:30,593 --> 00:34:32,254
Please!

525
00:34:32,562 --> 00:34:35,531
Preeti, do give your film's
premier passes.

526
00:34:35,665 --> 00:34:37,690
Okay. -That would
be enough for me.

527
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:40,735
Thanks, thank you so much.
-You're very welcome. -Bye! -Bye!

528
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:44,006
Look, Shekhar, l'm not like you.

529
00:34:44,106 --> 00:34:46,404
How can l deny something
happening in front of my eyes?

530
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,912
Did you get your pressure
checked?

531
00:34:50,012 --> 00:34:52,139
Can't you even answer
me straight?

532
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,405
Tell me, Shekhar!

533
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,619
Just a minute. -No, no. Why
are you making me sin?

534
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,880
Else l'll sin. Keep this!

535
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:00,613
Thank you. Go! -Wow!

536
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:06,617
Vani, you need rest
and l think..

537
00:35:06,762 --> 00:35:09,128
..even we should hire
someone like this?

538
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,569
This, Hasan sir, how did he..

539
00:35:13,703 --> 00:35:16,570
Don't ask anything. This man's
very important for my magazine.

540
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:19,903
No, you were supposed to invite
family, Dev! -Understand!

541
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,168
Dev!

542
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,934
lshata!

543
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,680
lt's such a pleasure!
-Well, Dev!

544
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:27,448
This is my friend, Cooky.

545
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,417
l was just telling her that we
would enjoy with some friends.

546
00:35:31,521 --> 00:35:35,218
Her shopping and make-up
consumed a lot of time.

547
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:37,519
lsn't she beautiful? -Yeah.
-lt's that when..

548
00:35:37,627 --> 00:35:42,223
..she came out dressed, l
couldn't believe my eyes.

549
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,795
Who is this, lovely lady?

550
00:35:46,035 --> 00:35:48,094
lsha, my wife, Meera.

551
00:35:48,337 --> 00:35:51,135
Hi! -Oh, is she your
wife? -l'm Cooky!

552
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,300
What a lovely name!
What a lovely name!

553
00:35:55,077 --> 00:35:56,312
When you said
that there's going..

554
00:35:56,412 --> 00:35:58,346
..to be an lndian
party at your place.

555
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,348
Then, l thought that there'll
be campfire and songs.

556
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:03,584
Don't get me wrong.

557
00:36:03,686 --> 00:36:08,248
l can see that you've build a
great home and earned a lot.

558
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:11,155
Mrs, Me and lshata will
have a business talk.

559
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:14,593
Why don't you take Cooky inside
and introduce her to others.

560
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,393
Why not? Cooky, come
along with me.

561
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:20,298
l love lndians.

562
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:22,428
How strange, isn't it?

563
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:23,806
And lndian food
is beyond words.

564
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:25,999
Really? Come tell
me more about it.

565
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,042
No, no, no. l won't speak now.

566
00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:30,313
Jennifer, wait, listen to me.
-Leave me alone, Javed. -

567
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:32,482
Don't close the door. Listen!

568
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:35,608
Don't ask me anything, selfish!

569
00:36:36,352 --> 00:36:38,616
You think that l'm around you
because l want to work..

570
00:36:38,721 --> 00:36:42,122
..in your film. This is not true!
You don't have a film, Javed.

571
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:44,726
You don't have a film. You're
constantly, constantly..

572
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,695
..making a fool out of others.

573
00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:47,730
You don't possess the talent
that you talk of.

574
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,332
You keep lying!

575
00:36:49,432 --> 00:36:52,230
You keep telling people that you
have a big film. Don't l know..

576
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,895
..the truth. l've known you
since long. -What are you saying?

577
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:59,441
What do you know? -You think
you're a great director, is it?

578
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:02,639
How do you behave with me?

579
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:06,043
And l just wished good for you
that all your dreams came true.

580
00:37:06,148 --> 00:37:07,809
That you become a
great director.

581
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:10,385
But you don't wish
good for me. You..

582
00:37:10,486 --> 00:37:11,787
..you're selfish. -But
what have l done?

583
00:37:11,887 --> 00:37:13,821
l care for you and your dreams.

584
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:16,049
l wanted to support you.

585
00:37:17,126 --> 00:37:19,617
What? So, you were pretending
to support me?

586
00:37:19,762 --> 00:37:22,788
l used to pretend because l
didn't want to disappoint you.

587
00:37:22,898 --> 00:37:25,162
l just want honesty from you,
that, you remain honest.

588
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:27,069
l don't want you to pretend
as if you're my..

589
00:37:27,169 --> 00:37:28,659
..girlfriend and supporting me.

590
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:30,840
What has happened to you? l've
done so much for you.

591
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,275
What is it that you're
expecting from me?

592
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,775
Look, don't hide from me.

593
00:37:35,011 --> 00:37:35,943
What's the matter?

594
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,105
l want you to understand the
responsibility of a father!

595
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:43,376
What do you mean? -l'm pregnant.

596
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:56,463
Look, l knew that this would
be your reaction.

597
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:58,226
No!

598
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,268
lsha, this is Geetanjali Singh.

599
00:38:03,372 --> 00:38:05,897
She's also going to be present
in our meeting, today.

600
00:38:06,008 --> 00:38:08,875
Oh! l thought that we would
talk alone, today.

601
00:38:08,978 --> 00:38:11,037
But when a beautiful..

602
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,149
..flower is present, then
there are no hassles.

603
00:38:14,517 --> 00:38:17,884
l'm the company's chief operating
officer and l've done my BA.

604
00:38:17,987 --> 00:38:19,352
And my MBA from Harvard.

605
00:38:19,488 --> 00:38:22,924
Oh, l'm sorry darling. Don't
feel bad! -Relax.

606
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:25,960
l was joking. She got irritated.

607
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,756
Personally, l love Las Vegas.

608
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:32,766
lt's fun there but
l always lose.

609
00:38:32,868 --> 00:38:34,631
l'm never able to save money.

610
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,035
l always return rich from there.

611
00:38:38,174 --> 00:38:40,472
Then, maybe, l don't
know how to play.

612
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:43,936
l've been there a few times.
Feels good! -Have you been? -Yes.

613
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,311
Yes, there are good restaurants.

614
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,316
Good clubs also.
-Yes, very true.

615
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:53,286
Whenever l visit lndia, l go to
Kashmir, it's a beautiful place.

616
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:56,014
l love lndia. -l think
America's better.

617
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:58,217
lt's the most beautiful
place in the world.

618
00:38:58,561 --> 00:39:01,394
l love lndia but l just wish it
had been as beautiful as America.

619
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,623
l think you must visit lndia.

620
00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:06,327
You must be proud to be
an lndian. -Well..

621
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,436
What will l do there?

622
00:39:07,536 --> 00:39:11,233
l heard that some ltalian
was asked to rule lndia..

623
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,308
..and he had refused it. -Yes.

624
00:39:13,442 --> 00:39:16,969
What happened? -Nothing, Vani.

625
00:39:17,446 --> 00:39:20,210
Excuse me, please. -Where
are you going, then?

626
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,878
l would want to go to the
bathroom, if you permit!

627
00:39:25,955 --> 00:39:27,513
lf you feel scared, can
l come along too?

628
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,784
lf you come along, then l
shall be scared for sure.

629
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:34,488
Truly, l think lndia's views
has become so modern..

630
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,861
..that it is ready to accept a
lady foreigner as a leader.

631
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,195
Rightly said, even l'm
impressed with this.

632
00:39:40,302 --> 00:39:42,099
And how many nations had an
lndian prime minister?

633
00:39:42,204 --> 00:39:44,934
l've never heard anything
more stupid than this.

634
00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:48,910
C'mon, your nation has a
population of 100 crores.

635
00:39:49,044 --> 00:39:51,308
But, you can't appoint
a good leader.

636
00:39:51,447 --> 00:39:53,540
But he is an lndian, Nimesh.

637
00:39:53,649 --> 00:39:56,948
And maybe you're too
conservative regarding this.

638
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:02,051
You do a thing..

639
00:40:02,224 --> 00:40:05,387
..go and make me a cup of tea.

640
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,125
So are you..

641
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,824
So you stay in Vegas.
What do you do there?

642
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:14,925
l entertain people.

643
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,231
What kind of entertainment?

644
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:19,466
l love being entertained,
anywhere..

645
00:40:19,575 --> 00:40:21,270
..anytime. Everyone
gets entertained.

646
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,207
With such funds..

647
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:26,245
..we can gets new stuff.
Exclusive stories..

648
00:40:26,348 --> 00:40:29,112
..nice glossy paper,
layout, everything.

649
00:40:29,518 --> 00:40:32,510
Our circulation will increase,
you know? -Yes.

650
00:40:32,655 --> 00:40:35,055
Your ideas seem to be good.

651
00:40:35,191 --> 00:40:37,386
And you need twenty lakhs
for your next edition.

652
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:39,721
And later, twenty more lakhs.

653
00:40:39,862 --> 00:40:41,420
For your next edition.
-Well, maybe..

654
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,225
..we won't need the
extra twenty lakhs.

655
00:40:43,499 --> 00:40:46,525
Right? -Listen to me, whether
you need it or not..

656
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:48,864
..but l'm concerned
about my interest.

657
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:53,499
Well, you've got a point.
You've got a point.

658
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:55,542
l'm just worried
about one thing.

659
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,401
This..

660
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,574
You call this the lndian Voice.

661
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,612
l mean, nobody will..

662
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,585
..buy this easily. Well,
this is just our..

663
00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:08,246
..community's voice.

664
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,459
Shall l tell you something? l've
come to do business here.

665
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,290
Not charity or something,
do you get me, partner?

666
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:18,231
Stopping this publication is
not a big deal, Mr. lsha!

667
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,197
Then we can think about it.

668
00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:29,903
Shekhar, is your stomach
alright? -Yes, dear.

669
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,770
How many times have l told you
to drink water after food?

670
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:36,248
Can you please leave me alone?
-l'm tensed about you, Shekhar.

671
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:37,943
About you and your stomach.

672
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:39,547
l know it.

673
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:43,288
l know that you're worried
but can l shit in peace?

674
00:41:43,425 --> 00:41:44,517
Please!

675
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,698
So, lsha. What do you say?

676
00:41:56,071 --> 00:41:57,834
lt's a deal.

677
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:01,477
Thank you so much, lsha.

678
00:42:01,577 --> 00:42:04,137
Congratulations!
-You too, young lady.

679
00:42:04,713 --> 00:42:06,840
Thank you, thank you. Well..

680
00:42:06,949 --> 00:42:10,009
Cheers to that! -Oh, definitely!

681
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,720
Wait a minute, Cooky. You don't
sleep with these men, do you?

682
00:42:13,856 --> 00:42:16,222
Oh, not at all, darling.

683
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:17,484
l thought.

684
00:42:17,626 --> 00:42:21,255
Know what? Bobby has bought
me my new Mercedes.

685
00:42:21,397 --> 00:42:23,991
And my job is to
sit on his lap..

686
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:26,124
..and do a few movements.

687
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:28,930
Even l like it a lot.

688
00:42:29,038 --> 00:42:30,699
He's so crazy, isn't he?

689
00:42:30,973 --> 00:42:32,600
Where are we stuck?

690
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,802
You've worn such a
beautiful curtain.

691
00:42:35,911 --> 00:42:37,173
Curtain?

692
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:40,043
She's never seen such clothes.
-What is she wearing to speak so.

693
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,843
Don't know from where Meera
gets such girls.

694
00:42:41,984 --> 00:42:46,045
They're speaking some different
language. -Yes, it is different.

695
00:42:46,388 --> 00:42:48,913
Her head is full of nonsense.

696
00:42:50,793 --> 00:42:53,091
lt's a different language. -Yes,
yes, l'll just show it to you.

697
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:56,096
Just wait. -Sister, where are
you going? -Wow, Meera, wow!

698
00:42:56,198 --> 00:43:00,191
What guests you've invited!
-Cooky! -Shut up!

699
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:03,469
Meera, l know that your
lifestyle is very modern.

700
00:43:03,672 --> 00:43:05,936
But why have you invited
her? l mean..

701
00:43:06,075 --> 00:43:07,476
What sort of people are
these? -But what?

702
00:43:07,576 --> 00:43:10,443
Do whatever you want to with
your life. lt's yours!

703
00:43:10,612 --> 00:43:12,842
But, sister. Sister!

704
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,881
lt's her. -What? -Cooky!

705
00:43:16,285 --> 00:43:19,015
But what has Cooky done?
-Don't you know, Cooky?

706
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:21,957
She told me that she
takes 4000$..

707
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,285
..for one night.

708
00:43:26,662 --> 00:43:28,960
Are you alright? -Yes, l'm
fine. Take this wine.

709
00:43:29,298 --> 00:43:32,131
Okay, l remembered
some work. Bye!

710
00:43:37,106 --> 00:43:38,334
Dev!

711
00:43:40,843 --> 00:43:43,112
How many times have l told you
not to smoke in the house?

712
00:43:43,212 --> 00:43:45,180
Oh, l'm really sorry.

713
00:43:45,714 --> 00:43:47,483
Here. -Listen, don't flatter me.

714
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,652
l don't like these business
meetings at home.

715
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,413
We've finished with our meeting.

716
00:43:51,653 --> 00:43:52,745
lt's done!

717
00:43:52,888 --> 00:43:56,051
And you've got a prostitute in
my house and l don't like that!

718
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:57,317
Meera!

719
00:43:59,728 --> 00:44:00,922
Well..

720
00:44:02,731 --> 00:44:04,722
l can't wait here anymore.

721
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,032
Sorry, Mr. lsha. -lsha!

722
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,506
There's definitely some
misunderstanding.

723
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,336
Please! -Dev!

724
00:44:13,976 --> 00:44:15,739
You offered great hospitality.

725
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,102
C'mon, Cooky. We're leaving!

726
00:44:18,414 --> 00:44:20,211
You'll have to leave!

727
00:44:20,382 --> 00:44:23,510
l've never enjoyed
so much before.

728
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:25,983
lt was a great pleasure
to meet you all.

729
00:44:26,355 --> 00:44:27,823
Greetings! -Oh stop it!

730
00:44:27,923 --> 00:44:29,925
Oh, sit down. Please sit.

731
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:32,161
l'll get away. -Let
me get up. -No, no!

732
00:44:32,261 --> 00:44:34,024
l'm an expert.

733
00:44:34,763 --> 00:44:36,594
lt was great meeting you all.

734
00:44:49,745 --> 00:44:51,042
Well..

735
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,747
We've other ways left.
Let's ask Nimesh.

736
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,984
l'll not ask for
a loan from him.

737
00:44:57,419 --> 00:44:58,716
ls there any other choice?

738
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:03,349
C'mon! Let's go inside.

739
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,124
And, yes..

740
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,121
..don't say anything to Meera.

741
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,103
Everything's become a mess.

742
00:45:17,106 --> 00:45:18,903
Don't know whom to blame.

743
00:45:19,108 --> 00:45:20,666
On the newspaper..

744
00:45:20,976 --> 00:45:23,968
..on Meera or my fate.

745
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,577
lt's good that we didn't
get lsha's money.

746
00:45:32,254 --> 00:45:34,051
What are you trying to say?

747
00:45:35,424 --> 00:45:37,449
l'm doing all this with
a fore thought.

748
00:45:37,726 --> 00:45:40,194
Newspaper, for me,
is not only a..

749
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,058
..medium of earning money.

750
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:46,193
Without the newspaper..

751
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,530
..everything will make no sense.

752
00:45:52,407 --> 00:45:55,103
lf you need any reference or..

753
00:45:55,244 --> 00:45:58,577
..anything. l'm there!

754
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:00,039
Okay!

755
00:46:08,757 --> 00:46:12,193
Dev, let me remind you that we
have guests at home today.

756
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,596
So, if you're done with
your business talks.

757
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:16,789
Then we can go in and
attend to the guests.

758
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,896
l'm sorry.

759
00:46:50,399 --> 00:46:53,391
Keep your mouth shut, it's
an important call.

760
00:46:55,304 --> 00:46:57,067
lt's his baby's call.

761
00:46:57,739 --> 00:46:59,900
Hey, baby. What's up?
How are you doing?

762
00:47:00,576 --> 00:47:02,009
What did you say?

763
00:47:02,244 --> 00:47:05,270
No, l'm at home.
l'm in the tub..

764
00:47:05,414 --> 00:47:06,506
l swear on you.

765
00:47:08,317 --> 00:47:11,445
lt's just the TV making
noise, nothing else.

766
00:47:12,921 --> 00:47:15,947
That's nothing just that the
soap slips out of my hand.

767
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,886
No, no. l'll just
take bath and..

768
00:47:20,062 --> 00:47:23,259
..l'll talk to you till my
heart's content, isn't it baby?

769
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:27,427
Yeah, honey. l love you
too. Alright! Bye!

770
00:47:29,571 --> 00:47:32,199
Good!

771
00:47:40,182 --> 00:47:42,151
Hey!

772
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:44,446
Bloody, he's shooting me.

773
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,553
All of you get inside. l'll
get hold of him. Go!

774
00:47:48,056 --> 00:47:50,684
What are you waiting
for? Go inside!

775
00:47:51,393 --> 00:47:52,690
l'll kill him!

776
00:47:54,896 --> 00:47:55,998
Hey Dev!

777
00:47:56,098 --> 00:47:59,329
Where did you send Cooky?
l just saw her going.

778
00:48:00,068 --> 00:48:02,905
He had to reach somewhere.
lsha also had some work.

779
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,563
So..

780
00:48:05,374 --> 00:48:07,843
Are you okay? -Kamala, please
get a glass of water.

781
00:48:07,943 --> 00:48:09,501
Yes, l have one near
me. Take it!

782
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,172
Take it!

783
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,882
You won't take it because
l served it?

784
00:48:21,723 --> 00:48:25,318
l've always been made to feel
that because l'm a Muslim.

785
00:48:27,162 --> 00:48:28,891
Look, Javed, let me tell
you one thing clearly.

786
00:48:28,997 --> 00:48:31,022
l don't drink water
from a person who..

787
00:48:31,266 --> 00:48:33,700
ls a Muslim! -You shouldn't be
saying this. -No, no, no.

788
00:48:33,902 --> 00:48:35,995
lt's okay. Let her speak
out. She can.

789
00:48:37,172 --> 00:48:40,005
l'm sorry, man. -lt's alright!

790
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:43,039
lt's a big, happy family.

791
00:48:47,582 --> 00:48:49,914
Okay, hello everyone.

792
00:48:51,286 --> 00:48:53,948
Has anybody died?
-Brother-in-law!

793
00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:56,387
Dev, your toilet flush
is not working.

794
00:48:56,692 --> 00:48:57,920
No, it's okay, l'll mend it.

795
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,996
You'll need a rod for it. -No,
it's okay. l'll mend it.

796
00:49:02,698 --> 00:49:04,757
Anybody can need it.

797
00:49:04,933 --> 00:49:07,936
There are so many guests. -l
don't know where l'll get rod but..

798
00:49:08,036 --> 00:49:10,664
..l'll find it and fix it.
-Okay, he'll fix it.

799
00:49:10,806 --> 00:49:12,637
l saw a hardware shop
while coming..

800
00:49:12,774 --> 00:49:14,742
..l'll get it. Anyways,
l want to go out.

801
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:17,401
There's a store 4 blocks ahead
of 25th avenue, to the left.

802
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,139
Oh excellent! So, doctor, why
don't you go along with him?

803
00:49:20,682 --> 00:49:23,652
He's not an infant to seek
some help from me. -C'mon!

804
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,379
l think, even you should go.

805
00:49:25,687 --> 00:49:27,823
Look! -Alright!

806
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,390
The ladies don't want
me to stay here.

807
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,253
Even l'll have a ride. -Meera!

808
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,795
Will you do me a favour?

809
00:49:33,895 --> 00:49:35,530
Just take care of
Jennifer after l leave.

810
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,497
l hope she doesn't have to
tackle religious issues.

811
00:49:39,501 --> 00:49:41,059
Did you say anything?

812
00:49:44,172 --> 00:49:45,469
l'm sorry, Javed.

813
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,410
Okay, let's do a thing..

814
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:50,808
Let's all take a drink. C'mon,
hurry up! Come, come!

815
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,377
Richard!

816
00:50:02,157 --> 00:50:04,455
Why are you distracting me?
Let me think, let me think!

817
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:06,854
How does it make a difference
whether someone's a Muslim..

818
00:50:06,995 --> 00:50:08,792
..or not. -What's wrong
in being a Muslim?

819
00:50:08,897 --> 00:50:11,195
l don't see any problem.
Why are we arguing?

820
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,426
Why do you get so upset when
there's a talk about Muslims?

821
00:50:13,535 --> 00:50:15,469
Because l'm a Muslim.
-l know that, l do!

822
00:50:15,604 --> 00:50:16,730
Good, then why are you
talking about it?

823
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:18,135
Forget all this. Let's
find the rod!

824
00:50:18,273 --> 00:50:20,976
Go and listen to what they're
talking. -No, l won't go. -Go!

825
00:50:21,076 --> 00:50:22,703
l don't have the energy
to make you understand.

826
00:50:22,844 --> 00:50:23,979
lt's such a silly thing.

827
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,114
l was giving her water and
she refused to take it.

828
00:50:26,214 --> 00:50:28,944
l had seen that, Javed. -l'm
not ill. -l know you, Javed!

829
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:31,814
But there are many old people
like Vani, who are old-school.

830
00:50:31,953 --> 00:50:33,488
Right. -And there's
no cure to this.

831
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:36,191
lf there's some grave
problem in America.

832
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:38,350
lt's the issue of terrorism.

833
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,191
What? -l'm a filmmaker,
not a terrorist.

834
00:50:42,764 --> 00:50:44,061
Not why are you yelling at me?

835
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,031
When did l say that you're not
a filmmaker but a terrorist?

836
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,369
l'm just trying
to make you understand.

837
00:50:47,469 --> 00:50:48,670
Now forget this argument!

838
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:51,330
And let's leave this place!
-Here, l got it!

839
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,840
ls this the one? Check
out! -Here, take it!

840
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,468
C'mon, let's go!

841
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:57,177
You offend me, friend.

842
00:50:57,312 --> 00:50:58,836
Why? What did l say?

843
00:50:59,314 --> 00:51:01,805
You very well know to twist
tales. There's politics..

844
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:04,152
..behind all this. Whether
it's bush.. -You're right!

845
00:51:04,252 --> 00:51:06,355
Had Bush or America not steeped
on our.. -No, no!

846
00:51:06,455 --> 00:51:07,547
There would've been no problem.
-You're not getting me.

847
00:51:07,656 --> 00:51:09,224
There would've been no
terrorist. -Look, behind this..

848
00:51:09,324 --> 00:51:10,882
..there's a big hand. lt's
a chance for Bush..

849
00:51:10,992 --> 00:51:13,222
..to trespass Middle-East.
-Should l pay?

850
00:51:13,328 --> 00:51:14,693
No, l have it! Thank
you. Thank you!

851
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,354
When did l say that you don't
have. -Thanks for asking, friend.

852
00:51:17,499 --> 00:51:19,296
Just a second. Come here!

853
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:22,232
l need to ask you something.
-What's up?

854
00:51:22,337 --> 00:51:25,738
Do you have any ld? -Yes, sure.
l'll show it to you.

855
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,531
Why do you need an lD?

856
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,745
Because, after hearing
you people speak..

857
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:31,574
..l had a doubt, so..

858
00:51:31,746 --> 00:51:33,348
l need you lD! -Look!

859
00:51:33,448 --> 00:51:34,950
l won't show you my lD!

860
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,452
You're forcing me. Don't
compel me to..

861
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,521
Show me you lD! -No, no.

862
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:41,790
C'mon, right away! -No!

863
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,327
Move back! What are you doing?
-You can't do this to me.

864
00:51:45,427 --> 00:51:48,363
Look, l'm the member of the
Chamber of Commerce.

865
00:51:48,463 --> 00:51:50,124
Dr. Nimesh! -Yes.

866
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,962
l'm sorry. l beg your pardon.
l'm very shameful.

867
00:51:53,168 --> 00:51:55,659
l'm so sorry. -Begs for pardon
after embarrassing.

868
00:51:57,772 --> 00:51:59,637
l was just doing my
work. -l know!

869
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:03,575
An African blaming an Asian.

870
00:52:04,613 --> 00:52:05,773
Well..

871
00:52:11,987 --> 00:52:13,181
You're my bodyguard!

872
00:52:13,889 --> 00:52:15,791
l'm enjoying with girls
in the Jacuzzi.

873
00:52:15,891 --> 00:52:17,722
And that fellow shoots my film.

874
00:52:17,893 --> 00:52:19,986
Were you whiling away
time there? Tell me!

875
00:52:20,228 --> 00:52:22,719
Go, right away. And get
me that tape here.

876
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:25,595
What are you doing?

877
00:52:25,734 --> 00:52:27,769
The both of you, get lost
from here. Bitch!

878
00:52:27,869 --> 00:52:29,359
Get lost!

879
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,434
Ladies and Gentlemen!

880
00:52:33,575 --> 00:52:37,112
On this beautiful evening, we're
going to present to you..

881
00:52:37,212 --> 00:52:38,613
.. an amazing person.

882
00:52:38,713 --> 00:52:40,115
A poet and a singer who has..

883
00:52:40,215 --> 00:52:42,417
..fans not only in lndia
and Pakistan.

884
00:52:42,517 --> 00:52:45,420
But in the whole wide world.
-Presenting to you..

885
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,855
..Ustad Guler Hassan.

886
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,623
Wow! -Thank you, thank you!

887
00:52:48,723 --> 00:52:50,091
Thank you!

888
00:52:50,191 --> 00:52:52,056
Thank you for coming as well!

889
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,685
The consequence of
desire is alcohol.

890
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:56,921
Here l come.

891
00:52:57,065 --> 00:52:59,499
l came here to rejoice
the moment.

892
00:52:59,701 --> 00:53:00,902
But it turned out
to be absurd.

893
00:53:01,002 --> 00:53:03,271
Wow! -Amazing!

894
00:53:03,371 --> 00:53:05,340
lt's a great honour to
perform for you, sir.

895
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,032
lt's our pleasure.

896
00:53:07,242 --> 00:53:09,478
Listen, for a minute. Will
anybody click a picture?

897
00:53:09,578 --> 00:53:11,443
Even me! -Come, for sure!

898
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:13,815
There's beauty..

899
00:53:13,915 --> 00:53:16,918
There's an evening.. -Oh l'm
so sorry. -There's a story.

900
00:53:17,018 --> 00:53:20,155
Oh! What youthfulness!

901
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,958
Youthfulness, wow!
Wow! -A photo?

902
00:53:23,058 --> 00:53:23,922
Say cheese!

903
00:53:29,364 --> 00:53:30,888
l think..

904
00:53:31,866 --> 00:53:33,595
We shouldn't tell anybody
about what happened..

905
00:53:33,735 --> 00:53:35,828
..tonight, in the party.

906
00:53:36,805 --> 00:53:38,067
Okay!

907
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,838
l'm sorry. l..

908
00:53:48,249 --> 00:53:49,580
l feel like laughing..

909
00:53:50,885 --> 00:53:52,750
Now do l realise that..

910
00:53:52,988 --> 00:53:55,286
..l spent my entire life
in a fit of rage.

911
00:53:55,557 --> 00:53:56,819
lt often happens with people.

912
00:53:56,925 --> 00:53:58,256
We misunderstand anger
to be strength.

913
00:53:58,393 --> 00:53:59,655
This is the biggest mistake!

914
00:53:59,794 --> 00:54:01,284
ln this way, we get
rid of our duties..

915
00:54:01,396 --> 00:54:04,092
..and keep blaming others.

916
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:05,993
l..

917
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,866
..will become a father
in a few months.

918
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:10,764
What?

919
00:54:11,106 --> 00:54:12,300
Who is it?

920
00:54:13,308 --> 00:54:15,401
With my Jennifer.

921
00:54:15,644 --> 00:54:16,975
Tomorrow is the festival
of Holi.

922
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,881
l will celebrate every
feeling of my life.

923
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:21,881
That every feeling
which l lived.

924
00:54:22,117 --> 00:54:24,779
Happiness, sorrow, beauty,
everything!

925
00:54:24,953 --> 00:54:27,717
And Mr. Nimesh, l really want..

926
00:54:27,956 --> 00:54:29,947
..that you be with
me in all this.

927
00:54:44,005 --> 00:54:45,472
Where is the tape?

928
00:54:47,008 --> 00:54:48,737
Tell me fast, where is the tape?

929
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:54,148
lt is with you.

930
00:54:59,821 --> 00:55:01,389
So, you're here!

931
00:55:01,489 --> 00:55:03,286
Let me see, what
you're watching!

932
00:55:04,626 --> 00:55:06,061
No! -Give it to me!

933
00:55:06,161 --> 00:55:07,651
lt'll break! -lt'll break!

934
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:15,996
You're very cute!

935
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,141
What?

936
00:55:30,251 --> 00:55:32,310
You want to know about me?

937
00:55:32,721 --> 00:55:34,018
Why?

938
00:55:34,355 --> 00:55:36,016
Okay, l'll tell you.

939
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:39,826
ln my school, l'm..

940
00:55:40,061 --> 00:55:43,292
..the only Asian in my class.

941
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:46,960
They've named me..

942
00:55:47,736 --> 00:55:49,203
..the brown bag!

943
00:55:50,538 --> 00:55:53,575
Body's glow!

944
00:55:53,675 --> 00:55:55,944
lustrous hair!

945
00:55:56,044 --> 00:55:57,807
Colourful lips.

946
00:55:58,413 --> 00:56:01,348
Magical eyes!

947
00:56:01,449 --> 00:56:02,575
Sujata!

948
00:56:03,184 --> 00:56:05,778
l love this music. -l know!

949
00:56:06,287 --> 00:56:07,982
Make me another drink, please!

950
00:56:08,089 --> 00:56:10,182
Not now, a little later.

951
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,259
lt's just a matter
of two minutes.

952
00:56:13,294 --> 00:56:14,529
Go and make it for yourself!

953
00:56:14,629 --> 00:56:18,133
Even the moon envies
your presence.

954
00:56:18,233 --> 00:56:21,396
Body's glow!

955
00:56:23,772 --> 00:56:27,108
Body's glow!

956
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:29,472
lustrous hair!

957
00:56:30,311 --> 00:56:31,869
Do you have a friend?

958
00:56:32,714 --> 00:56:36,707
Everybody hates the
brown-skinned.

959
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,187
But..

960
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,889
But there's a girl in my class.

961
00:56:44,259 --> 00:56:46,750
She's very popular.

962
00:56:46,895 --> 00:56:49,295
She wanted to go out with me.

963
00:56:49,764 --> 00:56:52,934
Good, so did you people go out?

964
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:57,038
The fragrant ambience,
thirsty water

965
00:56:57,138 --> 00:56:59,129
The rivers and ocean.

966
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,264
There you are!

967
00:57:00,508 --> 00:57:02,203
Hi! -Do you need some ice?

968
00:57:02,343 --> 00:57:03,867
No, this is fine. lt's okay!

969
00:57:04,012 --> 00:57:05,809
Sure? -Yes, l'm very sure.

970
00:57:06,681 --> 00:57:08,205
lt is to be enjoyed sip by sip.

971
00:57:10,151 --> 00:57:12,984
You wanted to tell me
something, right?

972
00:57:13,488 --> 00:57:14,750
Yes.

973
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,288
There's a problem.

974
00:57:20,929 --> 00:57:23,397
But, when l reached there.

975
00:57:24,265 --> 00:57:26,324
The whole class was there.

976
00:57:26,868 --> 00:57:28,893
Everybody made fun of me.

977
00:57:29,671 --> 00:57:31,298
C'mon, forget all that!

978
00:57:31,472 --> 00:57:33,906
Be strong now, be strong!

979
00:57:34,108 --> 00:57:37,043
You should always remain happy.
Everybody wants to befriend..

980
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:44,380
lustrous, body's glow,
lustrous hair.

981
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:06,534
The fragrant nights.

982
00:58:06,908 --> 00:58:09,240
The heavy breaths.

983
00:58:09,344 --> 00:58:12,006
Passionate eyes. -lt's
very urgent.

984
00:58:14,048 --> 00:58:15,572
My business..

985
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,415
And the most important thing..

986
00:58:17,919 --> 00:58:19,819
..everything is at stake.

987
00:58:20,321 --> 00:58:22,152
l want you to..

988
00:58:22,924 --> 00:58:24,016
..take off your T-shirt.

989
00:58:25,994 --> 00:58:28,830
Game of love.

990
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:31,366
Precious dream

991
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,169
Game of love.

992
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:36,965
Precious dream

993
00:58:38,172 --> 00:58:40,663
There's sense in your talk.
You do a thing..

994
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,777
..l'll give you money,
my own money.

995
00:58:42,877 --> 00:58:45,710
For your magazine. Handle it
however you want to. l don't care.

996
00:58:46,247 --> 00:58:48,613
But, you've got to do something
for me before that.

997
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:53,016
You have to give me a column in
your newspaper, lndian Voice.

998
00:58:56,557 --> 00:58:58,582
Colourful lips.

999
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,693
Magical eyes. -What happened?

1000
00:59:01,963 --> 00:59:03,430
Take it off!

1001
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:06,498
So, deal?

1002
00:59:10,805 --> 00:59:12,238
Can l tell you something?

1003
00:59:12,473 --> 00:59:14,168
Let it be, as of now.

1004
00:59:14,876 --> 00:59:16,434
Really?

1005
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,581
Body's glow.

1006
00:59:21,716 --> 00:59:25,208
Body's glow, lustrous hair.
-Vikram, take it off, l said!

1007
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,955
Body's glow!

1008
00:59:27,055 --> 00:59:29,691
Lustrous hair.

1009
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:32,694
Body's glow.

1010
00:59:32,794 --> 00:59:35,592
Lustrous hair.

1011
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,626
Shekhar! Shekhar!

1012
00:59:41,736 --> 00:59:44,000
Shekhar! Shekhar!

1013
00:59:44,172 --> 00:59:46,868
Please call the police!
-What happened, sister?

1014
00:59:49,744 --> 00:59:52,146
That girl, that girl, Preeti..

1015
00:59:52,246 --> 00:59:55,147
She was raping Vikram.
-What are you saying?

1016
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,085
What have you done, Preeti?

1017
00:59:57,185 --> 00:59:59,244
Now, what will these
people think of us?

1018
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,218
l felt pity for him. l mean..

1019
01:00:01,322 --> 01:00:03,449
l was just trying to get him
out of the shell. -Shut up!

1020
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:05,388
When did you start taking
up the responsibility..

1021
01:00:05,526 --> 01:00:07,221
..of getting a teenager
out of his shell?

1022
01:00:07,362 --> 01:00:10,160
Have we imparted this
culture to you?

1023
01:00:10,298 --> 01:00:12,562
You and your culture. Why
should l try and be you?

1024
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:14,862
Don't even try! You can never
be like me. -l won't ever be!

1025
01:00:15,003 --> 01:00:17,494
l won't ever get married to
a guy who will control my..

1026
01:00:17,638 --> 01:00:18,969
..thoughts speech and dominate
my principles.

1027
01:00:19,107 --> 01:00:20,904
l won't ever be like you!

1028
01:00:27,982 --> 01:00:30,917
l'm sorry! Sorry!

1029
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:33,014
lt's alright, sweetheart!

1030
01:00:33,154 --> 01:00:36,715
Please, please! Leave me alone.

1031
01:00:36,858 --> 01:00:38,985
Okay! -Leave me alone!
-lt's alright!

1032
01:00:40,962 --> 01:00:42,862
lt's okay, it's okay.

1033
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,327
l haven't done anything.

1034
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,790
Who said that you're at fault!?

1035
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:50,768
l didn't come here
to tell you that.

1036
01:00:50,872 --> 01:00:54,000
l just came here to tell you
that we all love you.

1037
01:00:54,342 --> 01:00:55,900
You know that, Vikram,
don't you?

1038
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,709
Just remember that!

1039
01:01:11,059 --> 01:01:12,959
Will you'll have something?
Should l bring something?

1040
01:01:13,928 --> 01:01:16,021
No, let's wait till
tomorrow morning.

1041
01:01:16,197 --> 01:01:19,064
The ambience will change,
brother-in-law. -No!

1042
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,304
Preeti is not a teenager.

1043
01:01:26,874 --> 01:01:29,707
Vani, take this. Everything's
alright, Vani.

1044
01:01:29,844 --> 01:01:31,175
What is alright, Shekhar?

1045
01:01:31,379 --> 01:01:33,279
You think he'll be able
to forget this?

1046
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,915
He'll forget it very soon.

1047
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,253
Detective sees mom in underwear.
This is normal!

1048
01:01:39,353 --> 01:01:41,651
lt must be fine with
foreigners like you!

1049
01:01:41,956 --> 01:01:43,753
But we lndians are not
like this. Understand?

1050
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:46,556
Our culture, values
and tradition..

1051
01:01:46,694 --> 01:01:48,730
..is very different. -Look,
l regret all that happened.

1052
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,531
l'm very sorry for
all that happened.

1053
01:01:50,631 --> 01:01:53,327
Why are you regretting it?
You didn't so anything.

1054
01:01:53,768 --> 01:01:55,827
Javed! -What? -Hey guys!

1055
01:01:56,237 --> 01:02:00,071
Nothing happened. lt's
alright, okay?

1056
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:04,233
Excuse me, please! -Will you
hold my drink? -Give it to me!

1057
01:02:09,417 --> 01:02:12,682
Okay, l'll get something
for you people.

1058
01:02:16,757 --> 01:02:21,194
Look, l apologise for all that
happened. l'm really sorry!

1059
01:02:21,729 --> 01:02:24,220
Will anybody tell me
why she is crying?

1060
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,464
Vikram will be fine,
don't worry!

1061
01:03:04,839 --> 01:03:07,000
l'm not worried about Vikram!

1062
01:03:08,643 --> 01:03:12,636
l'm worried about his
anxious mother.

1063
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,648
We wanted a child since years.

1064
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:26,453
ln this run, we had
a lot of troubles.

1065
01:03:27,228 --> 01:03:30,288
Finally, Vikram was born.

1066
01:03:31,332 --> 01:03:34,426
A weak child, very weak.

1067
01:03:36,137 --> 01:03:39,766
We had to keep him in
incubator for days.

1068
01:03:42,176 --> 01:03:45,543
She was scared! -Maybe
she's still scared.

1069
01:04:04,865 --> 01:04:06,389
You're very nice!

1070
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,900
Don't worry, l'll be alright.

1071
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:17,266
Then, shall we go inside?
Yeah? -Okay!

1072
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:22,275
C'mon! Come! -Thank you.
-You're welcome!

1073
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:26,180
Meera, l'm so sorry.

1074
01:04:26,387 --> 01:04:30,323
l spoilt your party. -No, you
didn't spoil my party.

1075
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:33,253
Yeah, but l would want
to say something.

1076
01:04:33,628 --> 01:04:36,153
None of us, will ever
forget the party.

1077
01:04:36,264 --> 01:04:40,200
Even l think so. -Let's refresh
the ambience, okay?

1078
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,302
l've got a confession.

1079
01:04:43,237 --> 01:04:45,171
Tonight, all that happened
with Vikram..

1080
01:04:45,439 --> 01:04:47,373
..had happened with me too.

1081
01:04:47,775 --> 01:04:50,505
Many years ago. -Dev!

1082
01:04:50,878 --> 01:04:52,146
C'mon! -No!

1083
01:04:52,246 --> 01:04:54,882
But if you people don't wish
to hear. Then l'll stay put.

1084
01:04:54,982 --> 01:04:56,951
No, no, we want to listen to it.

1085
01:04:57,051 --> 01:05:00,454
Maybe even Meera will confess
something after you.

1086
01:05:00,554 --> 01:05:02,749
Why not?! We all will share
talks which has been..

1087
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,415
..a secret till date.
-Wait, wait!

1088
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:07,050
You're saying so much even
after all this. C'mon Dev!

1089
01:05:07,295 --> 01:05:09,497
Comply to it! -l know, l know,
let's play truth and dare!

1090
01:05:09,597 --> 01:05:12,967
Oh! That's a good idea. Let's
play truth and dare! -Yes!

1091
01:05:13,067 --> 01:05:15,297
So.. -l won't play.

1092
01:05:15,503 --> 01:05:18,961
No, we will play. -Right! -That
is the spirit, brother-in-law.

1093
01:05:19,106 --> 01:05:23,338
This is so dangerous! -We will
play as well. -We, too.

1094
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:28,449
You didn't even ask me. -l
will play too. -Good girl!

1095
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:31,712
Somebody will rotate the bottle
so that all of us get a chance!

1096
01:05:32,019 --> 01:05:35,716
No, no, you will start.
We're dying to listen!

1097
01:05:35,856 --> 01:05:37,619
Okay. -Please! -Okay!

1098
01:05:38,492 --> 01:05:40,153
l was 15 years old..

1099
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:44,520
We used to live in a middle
class colony in Delhi and there..

1100
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:47,629
..used to be a very beautiful
girl in my neighbourhood.

1101
01:05:48,202 --> 01:05:52,139
All the kids used to like
her a lot and one day.

1102
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:55,209
One day, she asked me to
play a game with her.

1103
01:05:55,309 --> 01:05:57,709
lt was a kissing game.

1104
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,446
And l won the kiss.

1105
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,712
And she taught me how to kiss.

1106
01:06:06,454 --> 01:06:10,117
l'm not preaching
philosophy but..

1107
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:15,123
Don't you think such
experiences..

1108
01:06:16,364 --> 01:06:18,229
..will enhance Vikram's
confidence.

1109
01:06:18,532 --> 01:06:21,365
Yes, Dev, it was a
good one for you!

1110
01:06:21,469 --> 01:06:24,666
The first kiss of yours! -Well,
it wasn't my first kiss.

1111
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:29,744
lt wasn't his first kiss! -Let's
end his chance now, please.

1112
01:06:29,844 --> 01:06:31,445
Now, someone else turn
the bottle please.

1113
01:06:31,545 --> 01:06:34,115
l don't want to speak all night.
-Okay, turn the bottle.

1114
01:06:34,215 --> 01:06:36,775
Okay, turn the bottle.
-Let's see who's next.

1115
01:06:39,186 --> 01:06:41,620
Okay, Dr. Nimesh.

1116
01:06:41,822 --> 01:06:45,553
No, no, not me! -No,
it's facing you.

1117
01:06:45,693 --> 01:06:47,320
lt's alright. Speak it out!

1118
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:48,829
Alright, if you say so.

1119
01:06:48,929 --> 01:06:50,260
This dates back when
l was a student..

1120
01:06:50,398 --> 01:06:51,592
..in the Atlanta
medical college.

1121
01:06:51,699 --> 01:06:54,429
So, it's a pretty old incident.
-Oh! Thank you.

1122
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:58,768
Anyway, there was a professor
in my neighbourhood.

1123
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:02,366
He was old but his wife was
young and beautiful.

1124
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,977
She was as beautiful as an
angel. l'm telling you, man.

1125
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,671
l just found reason to
visit their place.

1126
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,681
You know, l just barged in.

1127
01:07:11,252 --> 01:07:14,588
l started feeling that his
wife started loving me.

1128
01:07:14,688 --> 01:07:18,359
The lust was mutual. -Alright!

1129
01:07:18,459 --> 01:07:20,927
One night, the professor
went out. So l..

1130
01:07:21,095 --> 01:07:22,460
..wore my best shirt.

1131
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:24,996
l mean, that was the sole
clean one that l had.

1132
01:07:25,132 --> 01:07:28,568
l went straight to their house.
Knocked and went inside.

1133
01:07:28,736 --> 01:07:31,500
Before l could make out,
l was in the bedroom.

1134
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:35,805
l felt that my life was blessed!
-Okay, okay. -What?

1135
01:07:36,043 --> 01:07:39,638
So, you got all that you went
for. Next! -Wait, listen to me.

1136
01:07:39,814 --> 01:07:43,409
We were in the bed in each
other's arms and suddenly..

1137
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:47,984
..the door opened and the
old professor was back.

1138
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:51,826
Oh yeah! -He was climbing up
the stairs and any moment..

1139
01:07:51,926 --> 01:07:53,928
..could've reached the room.
-Did you go under the bed?

1140
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:57,865
How do you know? Were you there?
-No, no, l was just guessing.

1141
01:07:57,965 --> 01:08:01,401
l hid under the bed and the
story doesn't end here.

1142
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:04,964
That old professor wasn't
back for some work..

1143
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,440
The both of them, were,
engrossed for hours.

1144
01:08:08,642 --> 01:08:11,770
We were under the bed,
the whole night.

1145
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:15,208
Oh! Doctor, we feel
so bad for you.

1146
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:19,011
lt was a horrible experience for
me. Anyway, my turn's over.

1147
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:24,584
Oh! Sujata! -Okay.

1148
01:08:24,758 --> 01:08:26,282
lt is that..

1149
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:28,655
lt dates back to. -Wait, wait.

1150
01:08:28,863 --> 01:08:31,696
You don't have any secret.
-What's that? Let her speak!

1151
01:08:31,832 --> 01:08:33,857
C'mon, Sujata, we're listening.

1152
01:08:33,968 --> 01:08:36,904
No, it's alright. l don't have
any secrets. -Oh, c'mon!

1153
01:08:37,004 --> 01:08:39,837
No, no. -See, she doesn't
have any secrets.

1154
01:08:40,007 --> 01:08:42,032
Okay, let's turn it again.

1155
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:47,342
Who's it? Who's it?

1156
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,617
Okay, l'll tell you.

1157
01:08:53,888 --> 01:08:56,652
l never got anybody's love.

1158
01:08:57,291 --> 01:09:01,819
l tried my level best
to cope up with men.

1159
01:09:03,163 --> 01:09:06,030
But l could never make
it. Don't know why!

1160
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,198
l thought l chose the wrong men.

1161
01:09:09,403 --> 01:09:11,405
Then l thought, maybe..

1162
01:09:11,505 --> 01:09:14,531
..the men l chose had
problems in them.

1163
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,813
Oh! So she prefers girls. -No!

1164
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:25,184
Now, who's turn is it?

1165
01:09:30,491 --> 01:09:34,484
Meera! -Oh no! -lt's
be fun, now!

1166
01:09:41,535 --> 01:09:43,298
Well, l don't know whether..

1167
01:09:43,904 --> 01:09:45,701
..it's a secret or confession.

1168
01:09:51,845 --> 01:09:55,178
Dev and me are trying
for a kid since long.

1169
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:58,785
Meera! -Dev, let her speak.

1170
01:10:00,454 --> 01:10:03,116
And l started worrying.

1171
01:10:03,257 --> 01:10:05,384
Because it was already a year..

1172
01:10:05,559 --> 01:10:07,424
..which is enough to conceive.

1173
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,494
And l felt that..

1174
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:13,861
..there must be some problem
in my family. That's why l..

1175
01:10:15,536 --> 01:10:16,833
But l don't know.

1176
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:20,299
l don't think that..

1177
01:10:21,308 --> 01:10:23,071
..l..

1178
01:10:23,877 --> 01:10:28,507
Doctors said that. -Doctors? So
you consulted the doctors?

1179
01:10:29,049 --> 01:10:30,311
Yes, l did.

1180
01:10:31,619 --> 01:10:34,110
They will conduct a few
more tests and..

1181
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:39,155
This is silly! l shouldn't
have started off..

1182
01:10:39,293 --> 01:10:42,353
Who's turn is it next? -Take
this! -C'mon guys!

1183
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:48,393
Thanks, brother-in-law. -Just a
minute. My sari, lt's fine.

1184
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:58,605
lt's Shekhar's turn.

1185
01:10:58,946 --> 01:11:01,414
l want to confess something.

1186
01:11:03,117 --> 01:11:07,520
lt's been twenty-four years
of our marriage.

1187
01:11:08,322 --> 01:11:13,191
We shifted to our bungalow after
6 yrs of our marriage.

1188
01:11:14,361 --> 01:11:16,022
But l lost my job.

1189
01:11:17,831 --> 01:11:20,891
l tried my best to
get a new job.

1190
01:11:21,135 --> 01:11:24,366
But l didn't get one.. -You
were depressed and..

1191
01:11:24,605 --> 01:11:27,597
Vani, let me tell.

1192
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:34,241
Suddenly, my father fell
ill in the village.

1193
01:11:35,282 --> 01:11:38,183
And he was in need of money.

1194
01:11:38,786 --> 01:11:43,246
We didn't have money. We shifted
to a smaller house but..

1195
01:11:44,825 --> 01:11:47,760
Our cash and..

1196
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:52,030
and gold were robbed.

1197
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,328
You know!

1198
01:11:59,506 --> 01:12:00,996
Vani..

1199
01:12:03,343 --> 01:12:05,811
l had stolen everything.

1200
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:11,343
And l sold everything. l sold
everything for money, Vani.

1201
01:12:13,721 --> 01:12:15,188
l'm ashamed!

1202
01:12:17,391 --> 01:12:18,619
l'm sorry, Vani.

1203
01:12:20,194 --> 01:12:22,526
l will complete Shekhar's story.

1204
01:12:24,565 --> 01:12:26,294
He lost his job.

1205
01:12:26,834 --> 01:12:28,927
And he got addicted to alcohol.

1206
01:12:30,237 --> 01:12:33,001
l used to do all his work.

1207
01:12:34,842 --> 01:12:37,538
Because, he had the male ego.

1208
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:42,574
l used to get tired and broken.

1209
01:12:44,118 --> 01:12:46,348
Nobody, knew what tomorrow
held for us.

1210
01:12:47,187 --> 01:12:48,916
Then..

1211
01:12:51,692 --> 01:12:54,820
One day, l got to know
that l'm pregnant.

1212
01:12:55,095 --> 01:12:58,622
What are you saying?

1213
01:12:59,867 --> 01:13:01,357
You lied to me!

1214
01:13:02,469 --> 01:13:04,164
l always wanted a child.

1215
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:07,868
l always wanted a child.
You're a killer, Vani.

1216
01:13:08,742 --> 01:13:12,610
l spent my life with a killer.

1217
01:13:13,113 --> 01:13:16,514
Vani! -Shekhar! -You're
a killer and..

1218
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:22,615
..l spent all these years with
a killer. -Shekhar! -No, Vani.

1219
01:13:37,271 --> 01:13:41,731
l didn't want to do this but
what could l do? What?

1220
01:13:43,811 --> 01:13:47,440
Guys, this is enough for today.

1221
01:13:47,581 --> 01:13:51,642
l'll escort you to your
respective bedrooms. Come along!

1222
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,949
Come! Come!

1223
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,690
What a party it was!

1224
01:14:12,139 --> 01:14:14,130
ln this party..

1225
01:14:14,608 --> 01:14:17,600
..l experienced a lot
of weird things.

1226
01:14:22,182 --> 01:14:25,174
l shouldn't have said all this
in front of everybody.

1227
01:14:26,353 --> 01:14:30,414
l'm sorry baby, l don't know what
came over me! -Hey, forget it!

1228
01:14:36,797 --> 01:14:39,857
Anyways, this is not the
right time for a baby.

1229
01:14:45,873 --> 01:14:46,965
What?

1230
01:14:48,408 --> 01:14:50,603
We have a problem, Meera.

1231
01:14:53,981 --> 01:14:55,676
Can l say something?

1232
01:14:57,017 --> 01:14:59,247
We should get married.

1233
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,987
Every man does this.

1234
01:15:04,491 --> 01:15:05,856
Shekhar!

1235
01:15:10,364 --> 01:15:12,298
l used to pity you..

1236
01:15:13,367 --> 01:15:15,528
..but l realised your
identity today.

1237
01:15:16,536 --> 01:15:18,936
Today, l realised that
you're a monster.

1238
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:26,346
l wanted to tell you everything!
-Our relation is over!

1239
01:15:29,917 --> 01:15:32,647
Now, tell me, what's
that secret?

1240
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:37,124
Which you wanted to confess
in front of everybody.

1241
01:15:37,224 --> 01:15:39,784
That was nothing special.
l was just..

1242
01:15:39,927 --> 01:15:42,691
l just wanted to confess
like everybody and..

1243
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:45,289
So, you don't have
any secret? -No!

1244
01:15:45,599 --> 01:15:48,659
Nothing that you
want to tell me?

1245
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:53,339
l told you that there's nothing.

1246
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:58,302
Leave me, please.
l'm very tired!

1247
01:15:58,545 --> 01:16:01,309
ls it? -Please! -Alright!

1248
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:09,985
Everything will part. This
house, magazine..

1249
01:16:11,024 --> 01:16:12,582
Everything!

1250
01:16:14,828 --> 01:16:16,386
And you know what?

1251
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:19,859
lt doesn't make a
difference to me!

1252
01:16:23,637 --> 01:16:25,696
l just want to know.

1253
01:16:27,274 --> 01:16:29,469
Whether it makes a
difference to you?

1254
01:16:35,582 --> 01:16:36,947
You know my answer.

1255
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:39,579
You're sure about
marriage, right?

1256
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:42,448
Because l won't force you.
-Don't speak like that!

1257
01:16:43,657 --> 01:16:46,854
Just promise me that you'll
be with me, forever.

1258
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:10,876
l don't want to create a scene
at your sister's place.

1259
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,986
But l want to take a
divorce from you.

1260
01:18:33,066 --> 01:18:34,693
Where's the tape?

1261
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:39,204
lt's with you.

1262
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:56,178
l want to meet Rich.
-No, he won't.

1263
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:59,524
He would want to meet me.

1264
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:07,266
Will l get it back?
-Yes or maybe not.

1265
01:19:07,968 --> 01:19:10,266
Because l'll return
it with interest.

1266
01:19:12,739 --> 01:19:14,639
Think about it once, please.

1267
01:19:17,744 --> 01:19:21,009
Take her away, and..

1268
01:19:21,314 --> 01:19:24,374
..show her the way out.
-No, l'll go myself.

1269
01:19:29,422 --> 01:19:32,118
Do you know when will they
play Holi, tomorrow?

1270
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:36,061
Holi, shit! No!

1271
01:19:36,763 --> 01:19:38,390
Today, there has been so
much of drama, today.

1272
01:19:38,498 --> 01:19:40,989
We may have it tomorrow,
as well.

1273
01:19:41,134 --> 01:19:44,297
That's why, l'm going
off to sleep.

1274
01:19:44,638 --> 01:19:47,129
Are you feeling sleepy?
-Yes, definitely.

1275
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:51,467
