Are you alright?

535
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:21,456
Just a hangover from a bachelor
party last night. Oh, what a party.

536
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:24,381
By the end of the evening,
the groom was a verbal dyslexic.

537
00:41:24,543 --> 00:41:25,677
[polite laughter]

538
00:41:28,741 --> 00:41:30,311
Thank you Mr. Boggs.

539
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:33,094
- Thank you for your help.
- Oh, anytime Mrs. Lopez.

540
00:41:42,478 --> 00:41:43,782
An A Tina?

541
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:47,939
Don, you can't make an F into a C.

542
00:41:48,581 --> 00:41:51,100
An F has to either be an A or a B.

543
00:41:52,378 --> 00:41:53,982
Then why not a B?

544
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,923
Because the A was
easier to make.

545
00:41:58,462 --> 00:41:59,997
You never said thank you.

546
00:42:02,221 --> 00:42:05,370
- I didn't want an A.
- Then maybe you should just keep the F.

547
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:13,072
Hey...

548
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:16,081
I'm sorry okay?

549
00:42:19,264 --> 00:42:21,599
We have a bigger problem
than your F, Don.

550
00:42:22,772 --> 00:42:23,772
What?

551
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,835
I think I'm pregnant.

552
00:42:42,348 --> 00:42:43,782
Then we'll get married.

553
00:42:46,129 --> 00:42:48,266
I want you to marry me
because you love me.

554
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:50,723
Not because I'm pregnant.

555
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,085
I love you Tina.

Still thinking about that race today?

602
00:45:40,965 --> 00:45:42,366
I wanted to win today.

603
00:45:43,647 --> 00:45:45,131
I could use the money...

604
00:45:45,687 --> 00:45:47,273
now that Tina's pregnant.

605
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:48,372
Pregnant?

00:45:49,419 --> 00:45:50,419
Yeah.

00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:52,169
I'm gonna marry her next month.

608
00:45:52,552 --> 00:45:54,382
Do you know for sure, she's pregnant?

609
00:45:55,196 --> 00:45:56,831
She went to Dr. Garcia’s, yesterday.

610
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,726
I called her from the track,
and she is pregnant.

[phone rings] 
Hello.

612
00:46:15,285 --> 00:46:16,285
Hi Emilio.

613
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:19,122
Hey, compadre. How's it going?

00:46:19,147 --> 00:46:20,147
Fine Emilio.

615
00:46:21,287 --> 00:46:22,938
Is it true that my
son has to get married?

616
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:25,467
No. But you didn't hear it here.

617
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:26,658
Okay?

618
00:46:27,364 --> 00:46:30,102
- I need you to come by the house now.
- You saved me.

619
00:46:30,576 --> 00:46:32,111
I was just going to mow the lawn.

620
00:46:32,653 --> 00:46:33,653
Thanks Emilio.

621
00:46:33,678 --> 00:46:35,129
Have a cold one ready.

622
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:42,379
Son...

623
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:45,639
sit down.

624
00:46:51,348 --> 00:46:52,837
You don't have to
get married Don.

625
00:46:53,837 --> 00:46:55,163
We are not having an abortion.

626
00:46:55,734 --> 00:46:56,902
Tina's not pregnant.

627
00:46:58,814 --> 00:47:00,015
Yes she is Dad.

628
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:01,589
She told me.

629
00:47:02,203 --> 00:47:03,886
Tina is not telling
you the truth Don.

630
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:06,349
No.

631
00:47:07,147 --> 00:47:08,315
You're lying to me.

632
00:47:08,723 --> 00:47:10,322
Because you don't want me to marry her.

633
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:11,839
Marry her if you want Don.

634
00:47:12,097 --> 00:47:13,228
But she's not pregnant.

635
00:47:13,253 --> 00:47:15,346
- That's a lie.
- I am not a liar.

636
00:47:24,987 --> 00:47:26,923
[knocking]

637
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:38,091
Don.

638
00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:43,065
I missed you so.

639
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:47,253
I've missed you too, Tina.

640
00:47:54,097 --> 00:47:55,899
Let's drive to Reno and
get married tonight.

641
00:47:59,729 --> 00:48:01,031
Are you really pregnant?

642
00:48:03,403 --> 00:48:04,733
Why do you ask me that?

643
00:48:06,413 --> 00:48:07,886
I told you I was.

644
00:48:12,785 --> 00:48:14,254
Just wanted to see you tell me.

645
00:48:16,606 --> 00:48:18,146
Tonight's fine with me.

646
00:48:24,506 --> 00:48:25,978
[knocking]

647
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:28,917
Let's not answer.

648
00:48:35,422 --> 00:48:37,146
[knocking]

649
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,243
What are you doing here?

650
00:48:42,554 --> 00:48:46,775
I wanted to come by and make sure you
understood, you're no longer pregnant.

651
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,362
Why did you lie to me?

652
00:48:51,966 --> 00:48:53,001
Excuse me.

653
00:49:00,768 --> 00:49:02,470
I didn't want to lose you.

654
00:49:03,299 --> 00:49:04,968
You won't keep me
by lying to me.

655
00:49:07,032 --> 00:49:08,777
I won't keep you anyway.

656
00:49:09,753 --> 00:49:12,088
My parents don't want me
to see you anymore, Don.

657
00:49:14,593 --> 00:49:16,710
They'd have to accept you,
if I was pregnant.

658
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,047
I was pregnant.

659
00:49:20,228 --> 00:49:22,597
But I, had a miscarriage.

660
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:30,541
Tina...

661
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,458
I love you.

662
00:49:35,304 --> 00:49:37,280
Don't worry about your parents.

663
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:40,876
Then marry me.

664
00:49:43,401 --> 00:49:44,401
I will.

665
00:49:45,131 --> 00:49:46,565
But, not now.

666
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:54,301
Now, is the only chance we have.

667
00:49:55,964 --> 00:49:57,602
My parents will see to that.

668
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:07,984
Your parents will say I'm okay,
once I make some money.

669
00:50:10,668 --> 00:50:12,597
They won't change their minds, Don.

670
00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:19,488
A year from now, we'll be married.

671
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,627
What can your parents, or
anybody else, do about it?

672
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,507
If you really loved me,
you'd marry me now.

673
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:32,601
If you really loved me, you'd wait a year.

674
00:50:48,863 --> 00:50:49,957
Tell you what...

675
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:55,862
six months.

676
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,793
We'll be married in six months.

677
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:04,132
Okay Frank. I'll take care of it tomorrow.

678
00:51:20,272 --> 00:51:21,272
Dad.

679
00:51:27,434 --> 00:51:28,566
I'm sorry.

680
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,154
That's okay son.

681
00:51:33,977 --> 00:51:35,479
I've been there before.

682
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,190
I'm going to the store.

683
00:51:39,882 --> 00:51:40,983
You want to come?

684
00:51:41,792 --> 00:51:42,792
No.

685
00:51:44,963 --> 00:51:47,361
I'm gonna try to, fix that oil leak.

686
00:51:50,283 --> 00:51:51,283
Okay.

687
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:53,025
See you later.

688
00:52:03,485 --> 00:52:05,056
Stay away from my daughter.

689
00:52:06,631 --> 00:52:07,936
Don't you want her to be happy?

690
00:52:09,371 --> 00:52:10,600
I'm warning you.

691
00:52:11,372 --> 00:52:12,450
I'm warning you.

692
00:52:20,145 --> 00:52:22,934
[school bell rings]

693
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:29,857
Tina.

694
00:52:32,987 --> 00:52:34,024
Hi Don.

695
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:35,049
[short car horn]

696
00:52:57,093 --> 00:52:59,791
Race Announcer: 105 degrees
here in the Lodi Cycle Bowl,

697
00:52:59,816 --> 00:53:02,116
as the forward team comes pounding
out of the fourth turn.

698
00:53:02,171 --> 00:53:05,978
On the inside, is Don Castro. Wide to
the outside is number 67, Stan Morris.

699
00:53:06,003 --> 00:53:07,675
It's Castro with engine problems.

700
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,591
Castro, up at the top end, over two
runs, can transfer to the main.

701
00:53:11,616 --> 00:53:12,694
Castro's got problems.

702
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:16,156
Working on the outside now,
number 67 Morris, with the win.

703
00:53:16,181 --> 00:53:21,892
In the second spot, it's Don Castro.
Followed by number 76, Mark Butler.

704
00:53:21,917 --> 00:53:26,725
Then number 20 Scott Eichelbaugh,
number 31 John Eichelbaugh.

705
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:31,410
But, Castro on the number 11, makes the
transfer spot, with a blown top end.

706
00:53:31,506 --> 00:53:33,254
Don Castro, lucky finish.

707
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:37,333
Question is, now, can Castro repair that
bike, in time to get back to the main?

708
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:39,039
Last chance qualifier coming up.

709
00:53:52,384 --> 00:53:53,493
What do you think?

710
